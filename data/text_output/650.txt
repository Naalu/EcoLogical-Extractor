Research Review
Can Restoration Management Improve 
Habitat for Insect Pollinators in Ponderosa 
Pine Forests of the American Southwest?
Susan E. Nyoka
Abstract
In addition to their critical role in food crop production, pollinators keep natural plant communities healthy by assisting 
with plant reproduction. Currently, forest conditions in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of the Intermountain 
West appear to be unfavorable for most insect pollinators. In an effort to reduce fire hazards and regain forest health in 
these forested landscapes, overstory thinning and prescribed burning are increasingly being applied. These treatments 
also have the potential to improve habitat for pollinating taxa. In this article, I focus on the potential effects of forest thin-
ning, prescribed burning, and the accompanying incidental introduction of non-native species, as well as the potential 
impacts of herbivory by wild and domestic ungulates, on plant-pollinator interactions at sites undergoing restoration 
treatments. Lastly, I make management recommendations regarding how to mindfully conduct forest restoration for the 
benefit of insect pollinator assemblages despite the current lack of data.

T
he pollination of flowering plants 
is one of the countless services 
insects contribute to healthy ecosys-
tem function. It has been estimated 
that at least 70% of flowering plant 
species worldwide are dependent on 
animal vectors such as insects for 
reproduction (Axelrod 1960, NRC 
2007). Insect pollinator abundance 
and species richness are strongly cor-
related with cover of floral resources 
(Haddad and Baum 1999, Potts et al. 
2003b, Kleintjes et al. 2004, Campbell 
et al. 2007) and plant species diversity 
(Fontaine et al. 2006, Ghazoul 2006). 
Yet the presence of floral resources 
alone will not insure occupancy of 
pollinators in a given habitat.
The availability of nesting sites or 
materials may be equally as impor-
tant as foraging resources to solitary 
bees (Horn and Hanula 2004, Potts 
et al. 2005). For example, the wool 
carder bee, Callanthidium illustre, pol-
linates Palmer’s penstemon (Penste-
mon palmeri) while foraging for pollen 
and nectar (Alcock 1977), but also 
require the presence of plants such 
as buckwheat (Eriogonum spp.) from 
which they collect plant hairs for 
nest cell construction (Gordon 1984, 
Michener 2000). Additional habitat 
features important to insect pollina-
tors include the presence of host plants 
(Haddad and Baum 1999, Loyola and 
Martins 2008), level of light intensity 
(Herrera 1997, Waltz and Coving-
ton 2004), and an abundance of dead 
wood (Campbell et al. 2007) and leaf 
litter (Lassau et al. 2005), as well as 
overall structural complexity (Potts et 
al. 2006, Loyola and Martins 2008).
Currently, 
restoration-related 
research on invertebrate groups in the 
American Southwest has focused on 
“forest pests” such as bark beetles (Ips 
spp.) and other non-pollinating insect 
taxa (e.g., Villa-Castillo and Wagner 
2002, Chen et al. 2006), though there 
have been a limited number of stud-
ies of restoration effects on butterfly 
assemblages (Waltz and Covington 
2001, 2004, Meyer and Sisk 2001). 
This article will focus on the potential 
effects of restoration treatments (over-
story thinning and prescribed burn-
ing) to plant-pollinator interactions 
including impacts from the incidental 
introduction of non-native species and 
herbivory by wild and domestic ungu-
lates at sites undergoing restoration 
treatments. I also suggest management 
approaches for mindfully conducting 
forest restoration that should benefit 
both pollinator assemblages and the 
forests they inhabit.
Pollinators in 
Southwest Forests
Compared to other vegetation types 
such as southwestern deserts, forested 
systems support a relatively low diver-
sity of insect pollinators. The predomi-
nant overstory trees in southwestern 
pine forests are ponderosa pine and 
Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii), 
both of which are wind pollinated, 
as are the numerous graminoids that 

September 2010  Ecological Restoration  28:3    •  281
comprise a large proportion of under-
story cover. Although total forb and 
shrub cover may be surpassed by that 
of graminoids in this ecosystem, forbs 
and shrubs are integral components 
of understory diversity in ponderosa 
pine forests (Rasmussen 1941, Cooper 
1960). Abundant information exists 
on the flowering species typically 
encountered in ponderosa pine forests 
across the Southwest (Ecological Res-
toration Institute [ERI], unpub. data). 
More than 100 understory species 
have been recorded at remote relict 
reference sites (never harvested and 
frequently burned) in ponderosa pine 
forests within Grand Canyon National 
Park (Gildar et al. 2004), including 
many genera that are typically insect 
pollinated.
Based on plant species lists from ERI 
research sites, published pollination 
studies, and what is known of insect-
pollination syndromes, some general 
statements can be made regarding 
potential pollinators of plant species 
likely to inhabit restored forest mead-
ows and glades. Bees are the principal 
pollinators in most ecosystems and 
are likely to be an important compo-
nent of the pollinator fauna in restored 
ponderosa pine forests. Although non-
native honeybees (Apis mellifera) are 
critical to the pollination of a majority 
of food crops, the ecological signifi-
cance of bees in natural communities 
lies in their important role in polli-
nating native plants, which is primar-
ily accomplished by native species, 
including bumblebees (Bombus spp.) 
and a wide variety of solitary and 
semisocial species (Neff and Simpson 
1993). In contrast to other pollinators, 
bees depend exclusively on pollen and 
nectar for food during both adult and 
larval stages and preferentially forage 
on plants that provide both, such as 
composites (Asteraceae) and many 
types of legumes (Fabaceae) (Proc-
tor et al. 1996). Legumes account for 
approximately 25% of the understory 
biomass of remnant (intact) openings 
in ponderosa pine forests (Laugh-
lin et al. 2006) and include genera 
such as lupine (Lupinus), milkvetch 
(Astragalus), trefoil (Lotus), and locust 
(Robinia). Other plant families are 
also mainly or entirely pollinated by 
bees (Proctor et al. 1996), includ-
ing mints (Lamiaceae) and figworts 
(Scrophulariaceae) such as beard-
tongue (Penstemon) and locoweed 
(Oxytropis). Although many bee spe-
cies are polylectic (collect pollen from 
multiple plant species), there may be 
some obligate plant-pollinator rela-
tionships in ponderosa pine forests as 
well. For example, Andrena astragali 
(Andrenidae) and Diadasia species 
(Anthophoridae) are pollen specialists 
on death camas (Zigadenus, Liliaceae) 
(Moldenke and Neff 1974, Moldenke 
1976) and globemallow (Sphaeralcea, 
Malvaceae) (Linsley and MacSwain 
1958), respectively.
Butterflies preferentially forage on 
species with tubular bright pink or 
red flowers and plentiful nectar and 
may pollinate understory species such 
as catchfly (Silene, Caryophyllaceae), 
honeysuckle (Lonicera, Caprifolia-
ceae), and phlox (Phlox, Polemonia-
ceae) (Proctor et al. 1996, Levin and 
Kerster 1968). Butterfly pollination 
of cryptantha (Cryptantha, Boragina-
ceae) and milkweed (Asclepias, Ascle-
piadaceae) has also been documented 
(Casper 1983, Fishbein and Venable 
1996). Moth-pollinated plants such 
as evening primrose (Oenothera) share 
similar features with butterfly flowers, 
but open at night and are generally 
paler in color.
Flies tend to be generalist pollina-
tors, preferentially foraging on open, 
bowl-shaped flowers or short-tubed 
members of the Asteraceae and are 
less efficient pollinators than bees, 
since they are generally less hairy and 
collect pollen passively while forag-
ing on nectar. Flies compensate for 
lower efficiency with higher visitation 
rates (Kearns 1992, Kearns and Inouye 
1994) and may be important pollina-
tors of some understory species such 
as Lewis flax (Linum lewisii), sand-
mat (Chamaesyce, Euphorbiaceae), and 
buckwheat (Eriogonum, Polygonaceae) 
(Kearns and Inouye 1994, Ehrenfeld 
1979, O’Brien 1980). Flies also have 
been found to contribute substantially 
to the pollination of some lilies (Lili-
aceae), such as death camas (Zigade-
nus) and mariposa lily (Calochortus) 
(Tepedino 1989, Dilley et al. 2000).
Beetles are relatively ineffective pol-
linators, yet they remain an important 
group owing to their sheer abundance 
on flowers. A study of soft-winged 
flower beetles (Melyridae, subfamily 
Dasytinae) in western North America 
suggests that species in this group con-
tribute to the pollination of numerous 
plant genera common to ponderosa 
pine forests, including forbs such 
as cinquefoil (Potentilla, Rosaceae), 
yarrow (Achillea, Asteraceae), and flea-
bane (Erigeron, Asteraceae), as well as 
several shrubs, including rose (Rosa, 
Rosaceae), currant (Ribes, Grossularia-
ceae), buckbrush (Ceanothus, Rham-
naceae), and snakeweed (Gutierrezia, 
Asteraceae) (Mawdsley 2003).
Current Forest Conditions
Historically, the diversity and biomass 
of understory species was greater than 
what is found in contemporary pon-
derosa pine forests of northern Ari-
zona (Arnold 1950, Cooper 1960). 
Beginning in the early 1900s, a com-
bination of widespread fire exclusion 
and climatic conditions favoring the 
establishment of prodigious amounts 
of pine regeneration (Mast et al. 1999, 
Moore et al. 2006) has resulted in for-
ests characterized by dense stands of 
small-diameter trees, a closed canopy, 
and an herbaceous layer depauperate 
in terms of both cover and species 
richness (Covington et al. 1997).
Implementation of ecological res-
toration treatments has the poten-
tial to do greater or lesser good, and 
conditions could not be much worse 
for insect pollinators than at present: 
little light reaches the forest floor, and 
floral resources are scarce and widely 
scattered. Forest conditions through-
out the Southwest are such that the 
number, extent, and severity of wild-
fires have been increasing in recent 
decades (Allen et al. 2002, Westerling 
et al. 2006). Although there may be 

282  •

short-term risks to pollinator assem-
blages associated with thinning and 
prescribed burning, the probable out-
come of continued fire suppression 
is an increase in catastrophic, stand-
replacing wildfires (Covington and 
Moore 1994, Covington et al. 1997), 
such as the Rodeo-Chediski fire, 
which burned nearly 188,000 ha in 
Arizona in 2002. Research investigat-
ing the impacts of wildfire on pollinat-
ing insects is scarce, but high-intensity 
fires will likely result in extensive areas 
of powdery soil substrates unsuitable 
for ground-nesting bees, and widely 
scattered patches of floral resources 
dominated by low-reward annual 
species (at least in the short term).
Potential Impacts 
of Restoration
As restoration treatments are more 
widely applied to ponderosa pine for-
ests, it is increasingly important to 
understand how restoration impacts 
the abundance, diversity, and ecol-
ogy of native pollinator assemblages. 
Overstory thinning and prescribed 
burning can increase nest site avail-
ability, insolation levels (a measure of 
solar radiation received in one spot 
over time), and the abundance and 
diversity of flowering plant resources 
(nectar, pollen, nest materials, and 
associated insect prey), resulting in 
improved habitat for most pollinating 
insects. Benefits to pollinators result-
ing from restoration treatments rely on 
several factors including whether thin-
ning or burning is applied, or both, 
the season when restoration activi-
ties are conducted, the amount and 
type of thinning, methods of dealing 
with the resulting slash, burn intensity 
and frequency, and the scale at which 
treatments are applied.
Overstory thinning increases canopy 
gaps, facilitating an increase in under-
story plant cover and diversity and in 
the amount of light reaching the forest 
floor—conditions that should be ben-
eficial to most insect pollinators. How-
ever, thinning with heavy machinery 
can disturb and compact the litter/soil 
profile in ways that adversely affect 
solitary bees, approximately 75% 
of which are ground-nesting species 
(Cane and Tepedino 2001). Diptera, 
litter-dwelling Coleoptera, and hiber-
nating Lepidoptera also utilize the 
litter/soil profile for egg-laying and 
cover. Evening primrose (Oenothera), 
for instance, is a common understory 
forb primarily pollinated by hawk-
moths (Sphingidae) (Raven 1979), 
whose larvae pupate in the ground 
(Borror et al. 1976) and may be dam-
aged by ground-disturbing restoration 
activities.
Fire can impact insect pollinators 
directly through fire-related mortality. 
Immature stages of ground-nesting 
bees may be killed, depending on the 
intensity of the fire and depth of the 
nest cells. Butterflies are also vulner-
able, since caterpillars and chrysalids 
are exposed on aboveground plant 
parts. Shifts in floral and nesting 
resource availability and alteration of 
niche diversity are among the indirect 
effects of burning (Hermann et al. 
1998, Potts et al. 2003a, Campbell et 
al. 2007, Swengel 2001, Ferrenberg 
et al. 2006).
Prescribed burning consumes litter, 
duff, and coarse woody debris uti-
lized by nonmigratory Lepidoptera, 
ground-dwelling Coleoptera, and 
bumblebee queens for food, shelter, 
and nesting (Stephen et al. 1969, 
Shepherd et al. 2003), while simul-
taneously increasing the amount of 
bare soil to the benefit of ground-
nesting solitary bees such as Callan-
thidium and Melissodes. For example, 
in Mediterranean Aleppo pine (Pinus 
halepensis) forests regenerating after 
fire, the abundance of ground-nesting 
bees was highest in freshly burned sites 
with the greatest amount of exposed 
ground, while stem-nesting bee abun-
dance was highest approximately ten 
years postfire, when vegetation became 
dominated by pithy-stemmed shrubs 
(Potts et al. 2005).
Scale of Treatments
Spatial distribution of required 
resources is also a factor structur-
ing pollinator assemblages (Steffan-
Dewenter et al. 2002), since foraging 
resources and nesting sites and materi-
als must be available within the flight 
distance of individual species in order 
for them to colonize habitat undergo-
ing restoration. Maximum foraging 
ranges for solitary bees are estimated 
to be between 150 and 600 meters 
(Gathmann and Tscharntke 2002), 
whereas bumblebees and honeybees 
are long-distance fliers, foraging up 
to several kilometers from their nests 
(Heinrich 1979, Visscher and Seeley 
1982).
Since solitary bees don’t fly as far as 
honeybees and bumblebees, they may 
be more profoundly affected by local-
ized changes in floral resources than 
social bees (Ne’eman and Dafni 1999, 
Gathmann and Tscharntke 2002). 
For example, in a study of pollina-
tor activity five to seven years post-
burn in a Mediterranean scrubland, 
small- to medium-bodied solitary 
bees were almost absent from burned 
areas, whereas larger-bodied bumble-
bees, with their ability to fly longer 
distances, were able to access burned 
areas from surrounding unburned 
habitat (Ne’eman et al. 2000). Highly 
specialized solitary bees that gather 
pollen from a limited number of 
closely related plant species may be 
an exception to this pattern (Arneson 
et al. 2004), though they tend to rep-
resent a relatively small proportion of 
the bee pollinators in forested systems 
(Moldenke 1979).
Non-native Plant Species
Overstory thinning and prescribed 
fire, as well as associated activities such 
as skidding (the process of dragging 
felled timber out of the forest with 
heavy machinery), slash pile burning, 
and construction of staging areas for 
log decks and helicopter pads, can pro-
mote the spread of non-native species 
(Griffis et al. 2001, Sieg et al. 2003, 

September 2010  Ecological Restoration  28:3    •  283
Korb et al. 2004, Dodson and Fiedler 
2006), potentially disrupting pollina-
tion webs (Brown et al. 2002, Traveset 
and Richardson 2006).
Non-native plant species may nega-
tively impact pollinator populations 
by replacing host plants or preferred 
floral resources. Cheatgrass (Bromus 
tectorum), for example, is a non-native 
that responds particularly well to dis-
turbances such as those created by 
restoration treatments and offers no 
floral rewards for pollinators (Craw-
ford et al. 2001, Keeley and McGinnis 
2007). The phenology of non-native 
plant species may also differ from that 
of native plants, with the result that 
increasing dominance of non-natives 
may reduce resource availability for 
pollinators whose flight season differs 
from the blooming period of a plant 
invader (Nyoka 2004, Fleishman et al. 
2005). Many solitary bees, for exam-
ple, are highly seasonal, timing their 
emergence to coincide with peak flow-
ering of particular native food plants 
(Westrich 1996).
On the other hand, incidental 
occurrences of non-native species 
may support pollinator populations 
by enhancing floral resource land-
scapes, serving as a “bridge” between 
the blooming seasons of native plants, 
thereby extending the productivity 
of a site (Cane and Tepedino 2001, 
Graves and Shapiro 2002, Bjerknes 
et al. 2007, Tepedino et al. 2008) and 
supplementing the diet of pollinators 
critical to native plants (Petanidou and 
Ellis 1996). Populations of non-native 
species such as dalmation toadflax 
(Linaria dalmatica), common mul-
lein (Verbascum thapsus), and thistles 
(Cirsium spp.), all of which commonly 
invade restoration sites after treatment 
(Dodson and Fiedler 2006, Abella 
and Covington 2004), may provide 
the only substantial sources of pollen 
and nectar for insect pollinators in 
ponderosa pine forests undergoing 
initial restoration treatments, though 
cover decreases over time as the native 
understory recovers. For example, a 
study in northern Arizona reported 
that exotic cover (initially at 13% 
following treatment) was reduced by 
half within six years (Stoddard et al. 
2010).
Herbivory
Livestock grazing is a ubiquitous man-
agement practice affecting the major-
ity of federal lands in the western 
United States. Wild ungulate grazers 
can significantly impact native under-
story vegetation as well. Shrubs and 
forbs comprise as much as 40%–50% 
of the diet of elk (Cervus elaphus), 
mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and 
domestic range cattle (Currie et al. 
1977, Holechek et al. 1982, Sando-
val et al. 2005), potentially placing 
them in direct competition with pol-
linators for these resources. In addi-
tion, grazing pressures by “native” 
ungulates are currently much higher 
than in historic times. Populations 
of Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus ela-
phus nelsonii), which were introduced 
into the region in the early 1900s to 
replace the extirpated Merriam’s elk 
(C. e. merriami), have achieved record 
highs in northern Arizona (Ballard et 
al. 2000), and the current distribution 
of the species is nearly double that of 
its historic range in Arizona and New 
Mexico (Truett 1996).
Mammalian herbivores impact 
pollinators through consumption of 
floral structures, which may result in 
a reduction of available food resources 
and host plants. For example, several 
bee families (Andrenidae, Apidae, 
Colletidae, and Halictidae) have been 
observed attending flowers of Fendler’s 
ceanothus (Ceanothus fendleri), a 
common understory shrub in pon-
derosa pine forests (Huffman et al. 
2009). Browsing limits flower pro-
duction in this species (Huffman and 
Moore 2003), thus reducing pollen 
and nectar availability for insects. 
Although browsing may release apical 
dominance in some understory forbs 
such as scarlet gilia (Ipomopsis aggre-
gata) (Paige and Whitham 1987), 
resulting in increased flower produc-
tion, if secondarily produced inflores-
cences are also browsed, as has been 
observed in thickleaf beardtongue 
(Penstemon pachyphyllus) at ERI 
research sites (pers. obs.), these floral 
resources are unavailable to pollina-
tors. Existing nests and potential nest 
sites for ground-nesting bees may also 
be destroyed through trampling or soil 
compaction by large vertebrate grazers 
(Sugden 1985, Gess and Gess 1993, 
Kearns and Inouye 1997).
Restoration Options 
to Consider
Our current understanding of pollina-
tor communities in ponderosa pine 
forests is extremely limited; we do not 
even know the identity of the principal 
“players.” Owing to the pressing need 
to reduce hazardous fuel loads in pon-
derosa pine forests of the Southwest, 
land managers must choose among 
treatment options that may variously 
affect insect pollinators, despite the 
lack of data. I recommend the fol-
lowing as a guide in making choices 
among restoration treatment schemes 
with the greatest cost-benefit ratio 
for insect pollinators and the forests 
they inhabit. While the management 
guidelines outlined in this paper are 
tailored to address forest health issues 
specific to ponderosa pine forests, they 
may be applicable to other forested 
systems as well.
Forest restoration efforts should focus 
on creating openings. Since an open 
park-like forest structure and a diverse 
understory assemblage were charac-
teristic of pre-European-settlement 
ponderosa pine forests of the South-
west (Cooper 1960, Covington and 
Moore 1994), it is likely that most 
insects associated with this ecosys-
tem are adapted to those conditions 
and will benefit from restoration 
that mimics historic forest structure. 
Increased cover and diversity of under-
story plants resulting from restora-
tion treatments should translate into 
greater availability of pollen, nectar, 
host plants (Griffis et al. 2001, Waltz 
and Covington 2001), and insect prey, 
such as aphids, which are consumed by 
larval Diptera and Coleoptera (Borror 
et al. 1976, Niemelä et al. 1993).

Bumblebees are the primary pollina-
tors of silvery lupine (Lupinus argen-
teus) (Gori 1989) and may benefit 
directly from restoration, since treated 
areas support significantly higher 
lupine cover values than untreated 
controls (ERI unpub. data). Solitary 
bee species known to pollinate pen-
stemons (Osmia, Xylocopa, and various 
anthophorids) (Crosswhite and Cross-
white 1966, Wilson et al. 2004) may 
also benefit from restoration treat-
ments. Sunset Crater beardtongue 
(Penstemon clutei) (Goodwin 1984, 
Crisp 1996), Palmer’s penstemon, and 
thickleaf beardtongue (P. pachyphyllus) 
(pers. obs.), for example, respond to 
fire with vigorous population growth 
and abundant reproduction.
Current conditions in untreated 
ponderosa pine forests are such that 
floral resource patches are widely 
scattered, which may restrict access 
to pollinators with extensive flight 
distances such as honeybees and 
bumblebees (Steffan-Dewenter and 
Tscharntke 1999, Gathmann and 
Tscharntke 2002, Greenleaf et al. 
2007). Increased cover of understory 
plants should translate into larger food 
resource patches with greater connec-
tivity—conditions supportive of a 
greater diversity of pollinators, since 
interpatch distance will be less of an 
impediment to insects with modest 
foraging ranges, which includes most 
solitary bee species. Butterflies are also 
likely to benefit from having patches 
of nectar and host plants closer to 
one another. Adult Lepidoptera lay 
a greater proportion of eggs near 
nectar sources (Murphy et al. 1984), 
so reproduction may be highest where 
nectar sources overlap with larval habi-
tat. For example, legumes are the larval 
host plant of numerous gossamer wing 
butterfly species (Lycaenidae) inhabit-
ing ponderosa pine forests of northern 
Arizona (Waltz and Covington 2004). 
The floral morphology of pea flowers 
renders the nectar inaccessible to adult 
butterflies, so alternate sources must 
be available for them to feed on.
Both light intensity and tempera-
ture are greater in restored ponderosa 
pine forest (Meyer et al. 2001). Since 
pollinating insects use sunlight for 
thermoregulation and preferentially 
forage in sunlit areas, an open canopy 
that allows more light to reach the 
forest floor should favor interpatch 
colonization over time (Haddad and 
Baum 1999). Meyer and Sisk (2001) 
found that Lepidoptera in treated 
ponderosa pine forests responded 
with earlier flight times and increased 
flight duration. In this same system, 
Waltz and Covington (2004) reported 
a two- to threefold increase in but-
terfly abundance and diversity one 
to two years after treatment, a result 
they attributed to increased solar inso-
lation in treated sites. It should be 
noted that the presence of adult but-
terflies does not necessarily indicate 
successful colonization. Thus while 
increased insolation should promote 
dispersal of insect pollinators, recov-
ery of a robust understory will ensure 
long-term habitation by butterflies 
and other pollinating insects.
Schedule burns during the mobile stage 
of most pollinators or establish a rotation 
scheme for prescribed burns, varying both 
season and frequency. Seasonal timing 
of initial restoration burning may not 
be important, since pollinators rarely 
use closed-canopy forests (Niwa et al. 
2001) such as those currently found 
throughout the Southwest. However, 
as fire is reintroduced as a tool for 
maintaining forest health, the season-
ality of prescribed burns could affect 
colonization of treated areas by insect 
pollinators. Studies of arthropods in 
other systems (prairies: Panzer 1988, 
southeastern savannas and flatwoods: 
Hall and Schweitzer 1992) suggest 
that many arthropods will either sur-
vive or recolonize best after fire if the 
burn is conducted during the grow-
ing season when most species have 
a mobile phase. However, summer 
burns are currently not feasible in pon-
derosa pine forests owing to manage-
ment constraints on resources (staff 
are focused on fighting wildfires) and 
concerns regarding risk of escape when 
attempting to burn the unnaturally 
heavy fuel loads present at most sites. 
Prescribed burns could eventually 
be allowed in the natural fire season 
( June–September) after restoration 
of forest structure and reduction of 
fuel loads, but that day is probably a 
long way off. Given current fire restric-
tions and the absence of research on 
summer burning, it may be beneficial 
to rotate the season of subsequent pre-
scribed burns (spring, winter, fall) in 
order to mitigate potential impacts to 
pollinator populations.
Determining an optimal fire fre-
quency that would support insect pol-
linators could take decades, a luxury 
we don’t have, given the current state 
of southwestern forests. In any case, 
there is no one-size-fits-all prescrip-
tion for all species (Villa-Castillo and 
Wagner 2002, Chen et al. 2006). 
Therefore, the greatest invertebrate 
diversity is likely to be maintained in a 
heterogeneous landscape with a variety 
of disturbance levels, including both 
untreated and severely burned sites. 
Once fire has been introduced to a site 
and plant-pollinator populations have 
begun to reestablish, light-intensity 
burns that incorporate unburned refu-
gia for pollinating insects and native 
plant propagules should encourage 
recolonization of treated areas.
Minimize soil disturbance during 
restoration activities to avoid damage 
to ground-nesting species. The use of 
mechanized equipment for thinning 
and piling slash can cause soil com-
paction, while subsequent pile burn-
ing alters soil texture and destroys the 
litter layer, creating islands of powdery, 
sterile soil. Conducting thinning treat-
ments over a winter snowpack could 
reduce or eliminate soil disturbance 
and compaction. Alternatively, adverse 
effects may be minimized by confining 
logging traffic to a limited network of 
defined skid trails or restricting soil 
disturbance activities to early and late 
in the year when insects are nonmo-
tile (Williamson and Neilsen 2000, 
Niwa et al. 2001). Employing either 
a hand- or machine-harvesting system 
(as opposed to whole-tree) for restora-
tion thinning can also help minimize 
disturbance to the soil profile (Korb 

September 2010  Ecological Restoration  28:3    •  285
et al. 2007). Methods of dealing with 
resulting slash also differ in the level 
of soil disturbance they create. For 
example, lop-and-scatter methods that 
leave cut stems in place may be a better 
choice than piling and burning slash.
Leave enough coarse woody debris 
for pollinator nest sites and other habi-
tat needs. Wood-nesting bees may be 
affected by restoration treatments that 
reduce the amount of dead wood at a 
site. Except for carpenter bees (Xylo-
copa) and perhaps a few other taxa, 
bees such as Osmia that nest in wood 
are nonburrowing and dependent pri-
marily on holes in snags, stumps, and 
downed logs that have been excavated 
and vacated by beetles (Arnett 1960, 
Krombein 1967). Some bumble-
bees, such as Bombus huntii, utilize 
abandoned cavities in snags previ-
ously excavated by birds (pers. obs.). 
Forestry practices that retain dead or 
dying trees or result in an increase 
in coarse woody debris may benefit 
wood-nesting bees, along with flower-
visiting beetle and fly species, some of 
whom are dependent on dead or dying 
trees for some stage of their life cycle 
(Borror et al. 1976, Reemer 2005). 
Habitat for wood-nesting Hymenop-
tera can be created by drilling holes 
of different diameters in standing and 
down dead wood to speed the process 
of pollinator occupancy at restored 
sites.
Without prior knowledge of the 
pollinator assemblage typical of 
healthy ponderosa pine forests, it is 
impossible to predict optimal amounts 
of coarse woody debris (CWD) to 
support insect pollinators. However, 
a practical starting point would be to 
follow the suggestions put forth by 
Brown and colleagues (2003), who 
integrated information on historic 
forest structure and various other 
data to identify an optimum range 
of CWD that provides an acceptable 
risk of fire hazard while providing ben-
efits to soil and wildlife. In warm dry 
forests such as ponderosa pine, favor-
able amounts of CWD range between 
11 and 45 tons per hectare, which 
includes both standing and down 
wood. Since desirable quantities of 
CWD vary greatly by wildlife species, 
a strategy for encouraging a diversity 
of wildlife may be to manage for a 
wide range of CWD across the land-
scape. Although the needs of insect 
pollinators are not directly addressed 
by Brown, providing both down and 
standing CWD for other wildlife 
should concurrently serve insect pol-
linators that utilize wood as a food or 
nesting resource.
Conduct restoration treatments at a 
scale that will promote colonization of 
insect pollinators within treated areas. 
When selecting sites for restoration, 
consideration of both the distance 
from potential sources of pollinators 
and the size of treated areas in relation 
to the flight range of insect pollinators 
should facilitate colonization by pol-
linating insects. When possible, initial 
entry into a site should be located 
close to source areas such as meadows 
that may support resident pollinator 
populations owing to their relatively 
high plant diversity and cover. In a 
study monitoring the response of but-
terfly communities to prescribed fire 
in a watershed of the central Great 
Basin, for example, burn units were 
larger than the home ranges of many 
butterfly species (7–17 ha), yet the 
burn units did not differ from con-
trols in community composition and 
species richness (2–18 months post 
burn), possibly because treated areas 
were located in a matrix of untreated 
habitat supporting resident popula-
tions of butterflies (Fleishman 2000).
Similarly, Waltz and Covington 
(2004) reported a sharp increase in 
butterfly richness and abundance in 
an Arizona ponderosa pine forest only 
one year after thinning and burning, 
despite a lack of significant differences 
in host and nectar plant availability 
between restored and control units. In 
this case, two forested units (19 ha and 
64 ha) that had been treated one year 
prior to initiation of the study were 
located within 0.8 km of the treated 
units where surveys were conducted. 
Both host and nectar plants were avail-
able in these units (ERI unpub. data), 
and butterfly species may also have 
colonized the area after treatment, 
thereby serving as source populations 
for the more recently treated areas.
Prevent the introduction and spread of 
invasive species. Although the applica-
tion of restoration treatments increases 
the risk of non-native invasion, a 
course of “no action” seems even less 
desirable, since untreated forests are 
increasingly at risk for intense, stand-
replacing wildfires, which can signifi-
cantly increase the diversity and abun-
dance of non-native species (Griffis et 
al. 2001). Management activities that 
minimize the introduction and disper-
sal of non-native plants and increase 
native floral species should also pro-
mote healthy pollinator communi-
ties (Niwa et al. 2001). Therefore, less 
intense, single-disturbance treatments 
(burn-only, thin-only), incremental 
treatments, or longer burn intervals 
may be preferred in some applica-
tions (Allen et al. 2002, Laughlin et al. 
2006). Amelioration of slash pile scars 
with amendments of native seeds and 
living soil can also reduce non-native 
plant cover and promote regeneration 
of treated sites by native species (Korb 
et al. 2004).
Protect restored sites from wild and 
domestic herbivores following treatments. 
Open glades in ponderosa pine forests 
are resource “islands” for pollinating 
fauna, since they tend to support high 
concentrations of understory forbs; yet 
these same areas are preferred forage 
sites for cattle (Smith 1967). Addi-
tionally, areas undergoing prescribed 
burning may receive increased grazing 
pressure from ungulates (cattle, sheep, 
elk, and deer), owing to the increased 
nutritional value (Harris and Coving-
ton 1983) and cover (Patton 1974) of 
understory plants.
Studies have demonstrated that 
protection from grazing increases 
cover of understory species (Arnold 
1950, Rosenstock 1996) and that 
ungrazed vegetation can support a 
greater abundance of insects than 
grazed areas (Rambo and Faeth 1999, 
Huffman et al. 2009). Since ungulate 
herbivores may constrain understory 

286  •

development and simultaneously 
adversely affect pollinating fauna, pro-
tection of plant communities from 
grazing after restoration treatments 
should support full recovery of both 
plant and pollinator assemblages. 
Manipulation of water sources and 
natural impediments (for example, 
thinning debris) may be effective for 
controlling herbivory (Severson and 
Medina 1983). Since grazing effects 
to native plant communities may vary 
depending on animal density and dis-
tribution, season of grazing, commu-
nity characteristics, and other factors 
(Milchunas 2006, Loeser et al. 2007), 
studies that manipulate these factors 
and monitor impacts to plant-polli-
nator interactions would contribute 
valuable information to land managers 
as they seek to restore ecosystem func-
tion in treated forests.
Final Thoughts and a 
Call for Research
Among the primary stated goals of 
restoration is to improve ecosystem 
function such that the restored system 
“contains a characteristic assemblage 
of the species that occur in the ref-
erence ecosystem” and the “physical 
environment .  .  . is capable of sus-
taining reproducing populations 
of the species necessary for its con-
tinued stability” (SER 2004). Cur-
rently, forest restoration efforts in the 
American Southwest are focused on 
the reestablishment of historic forest 
structure and understory plant assem-
blages, although research has shown 
that this approach will not necessar-
ily restore occupancy by animal spe-
cies (Handel 1997), including native 
arthropods (Short and Negrón 2003). 
As restoration practices become more 
widely applied to forested systems of 
the Southwest, a shift in focus toward 
community interactions and ecosys-
tem function is imperative to ensure 
the long-term sustainability and pro-
ductivity of understory plant assem-
blages and the wildlife species that 
depend on them.
While no combination of forest res-
toration treatments will be beneficial 
to all species, overstory thinning and 
prescribed burning have the potential 
to substantially increase habitat suit-
ability for pollinating insect taxa. Res-
toration treatments have been shown 
to increase both species diversity and 
abundance of some invertebrates in 
ponderosa pine forests, including but-
terflies (Waltz and Covington 2001) 
and ground-dwelling beetles (Villa-
Castillo and Wagner 2002, Chen et 
al. 2006), but further studies that spe-
cifically assess the effects of treatments 
on insect pollinator assemblages are 
needed.
In the absence of baseline data on 
pollinating insect taxa in ponderosa 
pine forests, the information presented 
in this research review can help guide 
land managers to make decisions that 
may minimize impacts on pollinating 
insect fauna. This is not a long-term 
solution, however. Research is needed 
to answer basic questions regarding 
the identities and specific habitat 
needs of the primary pollinating insect 
taxa. Standardized protocols for sam-
pling pollinator fauna are currently 
being developed at the USGS Patux-
ent Wildlife Research Center and the 
USDA Logan Native Bee Laboratory 
and implemented in selected national 
parks and research sites in the West. 
Adapting these methods to collect pre- 
and post-treatment data at proposed 
restoration sites could substantially 
contribute to these ends and lead to 
better future management practices.
For example, the study by Waltz 
and Covington (2004), which assessed 
the effects of restoration treatments 
on butterfly assemblages at a land-
scape-scale in Grand Canyon-Para-
shant National Monument, could be 
expanded to include other pollina-
tors such as bees and flies. Another 
study that could serve as a model is by 
Campbell and others (2007), which 
assessed the effects of prescribed fire 
and mechanical shrub control on 
floral-visiting insects in a southeast-
ern forest system. The Ecological 
Restoration Institute (www.eri.nau 
.edu/joomla/) has conducted long-
term studies of ecosystem response to 
restoration at sites in ponderosa pine 
forests throughout northern Arizona. 
These sites would be ideal for future 
studies to begin to address important 
questions related to plant-pollinator 
relationships in this ecosystem. Ulti-
mately, monitoring the response of 
insect pollinators to overstory thin-
ning and prescribed burning can serve 
as an “acid test” (Bradshaw 1987) for 
our understanding of the ecology of 
ponderosa pine forests and provide a 
guidepost for measuring the success of 
restoration treatments in sustaining a 
critical ecosystem service.
