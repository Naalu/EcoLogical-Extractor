Abstract 
 
We examined tradeoffs between managing for fire resilience versus economic objectives 
for a large scale (240,000 ha) federal collaborative forest restoration project in the southwestern 
United States—the Four Forest Restoration Initiative—created to improve fire resilience in fire-
adapted ponderosa pine forests that have experienced a century of fire exclusion. However, 
scaling up forest restoration to substantially change fuels and future fire behavior over large areas 
is constrained by marginal economic returns from harvested materials. We simulated a range of 
forest management scenarios and varied the objectives to select areas within those scenarios 
based on the potential to generate revenue (sale of harvested logs) or improve fire resiliency 
(reduce crown fire). We found that maximizing fire resiliency cost $44 per ha for the first 9,000 ha 
treated. By contrast, maximizing revenue generated an average of $552 per hectare treated for 
the same treated area. We identified a scenario that blended financial and resiliency objectives 
such that revenue could be generated while improving fire resiliency nearly as well as the optimal 
scenario. These results revealed tradeoffs among and within project areas for the two objectives 
and demonstrated that a relatively simple optimization algorithm could be incorporated into the 
collaborative restoration planning process to understand and communicate tradeoffs between 
financial and fire resiliency objectives.

Introduction
The dry pine ecosystem in the western United States covers over 12.6 million 
acres (Baker 2015) and is a critically important source of wood products, 
water, biodiversity, and recreation (Noss et al. 2006). Numerous studies 
have documented the structural transition of these forests in the last century 
and the effects on fire regimes and ecological resiliency (Merschel et al. 
2018; Moore et al. 2004) and biodiversity (Laughlin et al. 2006; Metlen 
and Fiedler 2006). Landscapes that historically burned with frequent low-
intensity fire are now experiencing high-severity wildfires more frequently, 
catalyzed by climate change (Abatzoglou and Williams 2016; Rocca et al. 
2014; Schoennagel et al. 2017; Westerling 2016; Westerling et al. 2006), 
spatial homogenization of fuels from past fires (Hessburg et al. 2019), and 
historic management practices (Covington and Moore 1994; Spies et al. 
2014). These patterns suggest that the current fire trajectory under changing 
climate will lead to large type conversions and extirpation of the dry forest 
ecosystem (Kerns et al. 2020). U.S. federal land management agencies have 
responded with large scale collaborative restoration initiatives to improve 
ecological resiliency and support economic interests of forest-dependent 
communities (GAO 2015; USDA FS 2012, 2015b, 2020). The U.S. Forest 
Service, together with the National Park Service and the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs, manage 70 percent of all western forests (Westerling 2016) and are 
funded to treat about 800,000 ha with a combination of mechanical thinning, 
mastication, pile burning, and prescribed fire. These activities are effective at 
reducing high-severity fire, potentially improving long-term carbon storage 
(Dore et al. 2010; Finkral and Evans 2008), sustaining resilient biodiversity 
(Laughlin et al. 2006; Metlen and Fiedler 2006; Mitchell et al. 2006), and 
protecting communities from adverse fire impacts (Kalies and Yocom Kent 
2016). 
Dry forest restoration programs in the United States face substantial tradeoffs 
among multiple economic and ecological goals on landscapes valued for 
a wide range of ecosystem services. In particular, achieving fire resiliency 
objectives requires costly removal of small diameter trees and woody debris 
that contribute to severe fire behavior but reduces the economic viability 
and scale of the programs (Ager et al. 2017; Chung et al. 2012). Economic 
objectives are best optimized by harvesting of larger diameter trees and 
allocating treatments to stands with higher commercial volume, which 
ensures that projects are economically viable to contractors. Finding the 
balance that maximizes the economic opportunity for contractors while 
creating large fire resilient landscapes is a key to creating and sustaining fire 
resilient forests and the federal restoration programs that bring about the 
required management activities.

Tradeoffs among economics, fire resiliency, biodiversity, and ecosystem 
services are widespread in forest management systems (Kline and Mazzotta 
2012; Triviño et al. 2017) and have been extensively studied with multi-
objective planning and optimization models (Christensen et al. 2009; 
Foresta et al. 2016; Hof and Joyce 1992; Mazziotta et al. 2017; Peterson et 
al. 2003; Schroder et al. 2016; Schröter et al. 2014). In general, tradeoffs 
from forest management occur over both space and time, are nonlinear and 
scale dependent, and involve both negative and positive aspects of forest 
management. While tradeoffs in fire adapted systems mostly concern how 
management can reduce losses from wildfire disturbances (Schroder et al. 
2016), in boreal systems the concern is the negative impacts of logging on 
biodiversity and other ecosystem services (Triviño et al. 2017). Tradeoffs 
among multiple conflicting objectives are common in forest management 
systems and can be compensated by diversifying management to include a 
wider array of harvesting practices (Pohjanmies et al. 2019; Triviño et al. 
2017). Nonlinearity means that the steepness of the tradeoff among variables 
can be affected by the level of the production of each of the other objectives 
and is central to the idea of production frontiers. 
Despite the many studies on tradeoffs and examples of multi-objective 
planning and optimization in forestry, application to the problem of dry forest 
restoration is limited to a few studies (Ager et al. 2017; Kennedy et al. 2008; 
Lehmkuhl et al. 2007; Schroder et al. 2016), and field application in the U.S. 
Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) programs is 
nonexistent. To advance knowledge about tradeoffs in ecological restoration 
and the application of multi-objective decision support tools, we examined 
economic and fire resiliency tradeoffs on the largest ongoing CFLRP located 
in the southwestern United States, the Four Forest Restoration Initiative 
(4FRI). We applied a heuristic spatial optimization model (Ager et al. 2019) 
to build a restoration plan that balanced economics with fire resiliency 
objectives, and mapped priority planning areas and treatment units within 
them. The modeling framework and implementation is substantially less 
complex than other mathematical optimization approaches in the forestry 
literature, and its wider application to restoration planning has the potential to 
help advance the goals of forest restoration on fire prone public lands in the 
western United States and elsewhere.

Methods
The 4FRI project is a 970,000 ha landscape level restoration project 
funded in 2010 under the CFLRP (fig. 1).  4FRI is one of 23 CFLRP 
projects intended to “encourage the collaborative, science-based ecosystem

restoration of priority forest landscapes” (Butler et al. 2015; USDA FS 
2015a) and serves as a demonstration for effective restoration techniques 
and forest product utilization (Schultz et al. 2012). The study area contains 
155,000 ha of treatments that were included in the first landscape scale 
environmental impact statement for 4FRI that had a decision signed in 
2014 (USDA FS SW 2014). Stakeholders and a Forest Service planning 
team worked together for 4 years to incorporate multiple values into a 
comprehensive restoration plan. An economic viability assessment was 
not included in the planning process primarily because it was not required 
for planning under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA 1969). 
The 4FRI Stakeholder Group, including Forest Service staff, developed 
broad goals to achieve landscape-scale forest restoration, meeting multiple 
ecological objectives, while providing appropriately scaled, sustainable 
forest products to strengthen local economies. The stakeholder group has 
long recognized the need to strategically incorporate the multiple ecological 
values, including beneficial fire use, with community infrastructure and 
protection values across landscapes. However, working at landscape scales 
in the 4FRI project has highlighted the need to incorporate industry capacity 
and economic feasibility into strategic landscape planning—a concept not 
limited to northern Arizona (Blignaut et al. 2014; Iftekhar et al. 2017). 
For this study we analyzed the western portion of the larger 4FRI planning 
area that was selected for the 1st phase of analysis (fig. 1). This first 
environmental impact statement project area covers approximately 240,000 
ha located on the Williams and Tusayan districts of the Kaibab National 
Forest (NF) and on the Flagstaff and Mogollon Rim districts of the Coconino 
NF. We analyzed 155,000 ha (65 percent) that are available for mechanical 
treatments according to forest plans. Excluded areas include special 
management designations (wilderness, research natural areas, inventoried 
roadless areas, and experimental forest), areas included in previous projects, 
areas located on non-Forest Service administered lands, or areas that were 
designated to receive a nonmechanical thinning treatment (i.e., prescribed fire 
only). 
The study area is dominated by ponderosa pine forests (Pinus ponderosa 
Laws.) at elevations ranging from 1,767 to 2,800 m including a mix of 
oak (Quercus spp.), juniper (Juniperus spp.) and pinyon pine (Pinus edulis 
Engelm.) with infrequent individuals or small groups of aspen (Populus 
tremuloides Michx.), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), 
white fir (Abies concolor (Gordon & Glend.) Lindl. Ex Hildebr.), and 
blue spruce (Picea pungens Engelm.). Historically, ponderosa pine forests 
consisted of open park-line stands (Covington and Moore 1994), but current 
forest stands within the project area are more continuous, are more even-
aged, and have higher densities with fewer nonforested openings than 
historical reference conditions (USDA FS 2014). 
Historically, forest management in the 4FRI footprint was consistent with

broader FS management. Selective harvest of larger trees primarily started 
with the railroad infrastructure built in the 1880s. This continued until 
1990; harvests were sometimes followed by planting and or precommercial 
thinning. In the last 30 years, however, forests have been managed primarily 
to thin small trees to reduce the risk of uncharacteristic fire effects and 
restoration goals, either through timber sales for material over 12.7 cm in 
diameter or through precommercial thinning of smaller diameter material. 
The use of fire varied across the national forests in the Southwest; on the 
Coconino and Kaibab NFs, fires were largely suppressed until the 1990s, 
with scattered pile and broadcast burning associated with harvesting 
activities. In the last 25 years, the use of prescribed fire has steadily increased 
each year (USDA Forest Service 2020). Wildfires managed to meet forest 
plan objectives have been utilized over the last 20 years on the Kaibab NF 
and the last 10 years on the Coconino NF. The two NFs harvest 156,000 m3 
per year (USDA Forest Service 2017) on average and burn approximately 
24,000 ha per year (12,500 ha in the wildland urban interface (WUI) and 
14,000 ha outside the WUI). 
After preliminary discussions with stakeholders and 4FRI planning staff we 
selected two treatment objectives for analysis: 1) ecological, as measured as 
the relative potential for crown fire activity between untreated and treated 
stands (i.e. the efficacy of treatments to reduce potential passive and active 
crown fire); and 2) economic, measured as the total net value of treatments. 
The ecological indicator was developed by a small group of stakeholders 
and was intended as a surrogate for a number of linked ecological values 
including wildlife habitat for both the Mexican Spotted Owl (Strix 
occidentalis lucida) and pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana). 
Reduction in crown fire confers a number of other benefits to ecological 
conditions, and also paves the way for wildfires to be managed to meet 
forest plan objectives on a large-scale and prescribed fire to further build 
and maintain forest resiliency (Barros et al. 2018). The net value resulting 
from treatments was included as a priority since private entities that conduct 
harvesting operations are more inclined to bid on timber sales and implement 
the treatments proportional to financial incentives. Economic benefits such 
as avoided suppression costs are tangible, but not relevant in this specific 
prioritization since the purchaser of the contract to conduct the treatments is 
not compensated for anything other than wood products. 
We obtained stand polygon and inventory data from the Coconino and 
Kaibab NF data libraries, which included 11,788 stands. Stand polygons in 
the forest inventory data were delineated with aerial photos into areas based 
on similar characteristics such as vegetation type, slope, aspect, tree density, 
species composition, and management history. Stands varied in area from 4 
to 80 ha. Approximately 34 percent of the ponderosa pine forest type within 
the study area had inventory data obtained within the last 5 years. Forest 
inventory estimates contained the number of trees per hectare by species 
and diameter at breast height (d.b.h., 1.37 m). Diameter was measured to the 
nearest 0.25 cm. Inventory data for the remaining stands were imputed using

a most similar neighbor process (Crookston et al. 2002) as implemented in 
the FS vegetation analysis system. 
Calculating Potential Crown Fire 
The potential for crown fire behavior was determined for each pixel using 
the fire simulation program FlamMap (Brittain 2015). We assessed both 
“passive” and “active” crown fire as indicators of high-severity effects. 
Passive crown fire is when the crowns of individual trees or small groups of 
trees burn without spreading to the adjacent forest canopy. Active crown fire 
is when the fire spreads through the canopy fuels but is dependent on the heat 
of surface fire for continued spread (Scott and Reinhardt 2001). Weather and 
fuel moisture conditions for the fire modeling were obtained based on the 
2010 Schultz Fire that burned with mixed and high severity over about 6,000 
ha within the 4FRI footprint. This fire represented potential fire behavior in 
a typical peak fire season, and weather conditions were based on the day the 
fire started (table 1). Fuel models were then calibrated to create fire behavior 
outputs representing the fire behavior observed in the Schultz Fire. Gridded 
30-m FlamMap outputs (30 m) for crown fire, and surface fire, were used to 
attribute the stand polygons based on the majority count of the observed fire 
behavior. 
To measure the potential for treatments to reduce the likelihood of crown 
fire we modeled silvicultural treatments and post-treatment wildfire behavior 
for each stand using the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS), Central Rockies 
Variant (Dixon 2002). FVS is a distance-independent, individual-tree model, 
where stands are the basic unit of management, and model projections 
are dependent on interactions among trees within stands (Dixon 2002). 
The model is widely used in research and empirically for a range of stand 
modeling priorities (Crookston and Havis 2002; Havis and Crookston 2008;

to preserve the contrast in potential fire behavior.

Keyser and Keyser 2017). FVS-Fire and Fuels Extension (FFE) (Rebain et al. 
2010) outputs for surface and crown fuels data were then used to adjust the 
fuel models for rerunning FlamMap to produce post-treatment fire behavior 
under the same conditions run previously (Schultz Fire). The difference 
between pre- and post-treatment active crown fire was then calculated to 
determine treatment effectiveness to reduce crown fire hazard. This variable 
is hereafter referenced as Delta (Δ) Active Crown Fire. (fig. 2a; Appendix A, 
fig. A1).
Financial Analysis 
We simulated treatment prescriptions in FVS to generate a list of harvested 
trees by species and d.b.h. The list of harvested trees echoes the information 
in the inventory plot to the outputs. A total of 34 unique FVS models were 
developed to mimic the individual treatment designs as they were proposed 
in the 4FRI 1st environmental impact statement analysis. Some prescriptions 
were two-stage and first simulated a thinning across the entire stand followed 
Figure 2—Restoration objective input variables used in the prioritization analysis: (a) change in active crown fire from pre- and 
post-treatment conditions, and (b) net value obtained from merchantable ponderosa pine as described in the financial analysis 
section. Note that only stands that were eligible for mechanical treatment were considered in prioritization. Stands that would 
receive either a burn-only treatment or a grassland restoration treatment were omitted from the prioritization process.

by a second stage that modeled group selection for regeneration openings 
in prescriptions developed to emulate a “patchy, clumpy” ponderosa pine 
structure. The outputs from these two-stage thinning prescriptions were 
averaged using an 85 percent and a 15 percent weighting. The harvested trees 
were then processed using the economics extension and custom FVS scripts 
to calculate the potential revenue from restoration treatments. 
To estimate the net value of harvested material, we used a residual value 
appraisal approach (Ager et al. 2017) where harvest and transportation costs 
are subtracted from the projected revenue from the logs at the mill. The net 
value of treatments is shown in figure 2b and was calculated as:
Net value = log pond value – (harvesting cost 
                    + hauling cost + ancillary costs)	
 [1]
The log pond value was the amount a mill will pay for a log delivered to 
the mill location. The FVS economics extension was then used to convert 
harvested trees into 5-m logs and sum their value based on log price data 
(table 2, fig. 3c). Note that only ponderosa pine was valued in this analysis.
The harvesting cost included the cost associated with moving merchantable 
logs from the stump onto a logging truck and moving nonmerchantable 
material to a landing site. Harvesting costs were calculated based on tree 
size class consistent with previous studies (Rainville et al. 2008; Rummer 
2008) (fig. 3a). Table 3 shows the values used to estimate the cost to move 
harvested material from stump to logging truck. 
The hauling cost estimated the cost to move merchantable volume from 
the harvest landing to the nearest wood processing facility. Hauling cost 
calculations used the estimated travel time to the nearest mill and the number 
of truckloads of merchantable timber in the project area. Hauling cost was 
estimated using the following formula:
Hauling cost = travel time × cost per hour 
                         × merchantable volume per truck

Travel time was measured in hours at a cost of $85 per hour and included 
to and from the mill (round-trip). It should be noted that only merchantable 
ponderosa pine was accounted for in the haul cost (fig. 3b). A value of 17 m3 
was assumed for the merchantable volume per truck load. Travel time to the 
nearest mill was estimated using the cost distance function in ArcGIS Spatial 
Analyst (ESRI 2013). A digital map of roads on the national forests within 
the study area was obtained from the 4FRI project data library. Both road 
layers were converted to a 30 x 30 m pixel raster and reclassified based on 
FS road maintenance level designation (1–5). The time to traverse each pixel 
was estimated using travel speed assumptions in table 4. Each stand was 
attributed with the minimum travel time using ArcGIS zonal statistics (fig. 4)
Ancillary costs including planning and road construction were not included 
in the analysis. Road maintenance costs, based on discussions with the 
economics planning team, were set at $1.00 per merchantable cubic meter 
and added to all stands to cover these costs. Estimation of additional 
treatment costs could be further refined by incorporating the cost to process 
and/or remove biomass material left on site. It should be noted that all stands 
that were designated as receiving a burn-only prescription or a grassland 
restoration treatment were not included in this FVS modeling effort.  
Spatial Prioritization Model
We used ForSys (formerly the Landscape Treatment Designer) (Ager et 
al. 2016) to examine a range of scenarios that maximized either financial, 
ecological, or a mix of objectives. ForSys is similar to Marxan with Zones 
(Watts et al. 2009), although we incorporated many features specific to 
prioritizing forest management rather than designing conservation reserves. 
A scenario in our case is a priority sequence of project areas (n = 40) with 
treated area (1,000 ha) identified among the candidate stands in each one. 
Thus, the program replicates actual restoration planning where landscapes 
are partitioned into smaller project areas to meet logistical constraints related 
to implementing treatments. These 40 project areas would treat a total of

by changing the priority weights for selecting treatment units (from 0 to 
3) in all combinations in a linear objective function. Eliminating duplicate 
weightings (e.g., 1-1, 2-2, 3-3) resulted in nine unique weight combinations

(scenarios). For each scenario the optimum project areas were identified and 
sequenced using a relatively simple neighborhood search algorithm (Feo and 
Resende 1995) (Appendix A, fig. A2). The algorithm tests each stand in the 
landscape as a potential centroid to build a project area by searching around 
that centroid for stands that are available to treat, meaning that some level of 
biomass or sawtimber is produced. The search distance is increased until the 
treatment area constraint (1,000 ha) is reached and the total objective value 
for that project area is stored in memory. The algorithm then moves to the 
nearest polygon that has yet to be included in a project area and repeats the 
process among the remaining unselected polygons. The process repeats until 
the specified number of project areas and treatment units within them have 
been identified. 
The objective value is calculated as:

stands), Nij is the contribution to priority i in stand j if treated, and A is the 
area of the jth treated stand. Wi is a weighting coefficient that can be used to 
weight one priority versus another.
We report results from all nine scenarios but focus on two specific benchmark 
scenarios: (1) maximize revenue, and (2) reduce crown fire, and a third 
scenario that is a balance between the two. To simplify comparison among 
the two priorities, we standardized the outputs by calculating the percentage 
that each stand potentially contributed to the total possible in the study area.

Results
Maps of the change in potential active crown fire and the net value from 
treatments are shown in figures 2a and 2b, respectively. The results showed 
that 98 percent of the treatable area could be effectively treated to reduce 
active crown fire (ACF) under the assumed weather conditions. By contrast, 
the area that generated positive net value from treatments was limited to 33 
percent of the treatable area (51,208 ha) (fig. 5). High net value areas were 
clustered in stands along the I-40 corridor in the northwest part of the study 
area due to the impact of haul cost in net value calculations (fig. 3b). 
Optimizing the two priorities generated a substantially different spatial 
distribution of project areas and treatment units (fig. 6). Prioritizing ACF 
generated a priority sequence that was distributed throughout the study area 
(fig. 6a), whereas optimal projects for revenue were clustered along the I-40 
corridor between Flagstaff and Williams (fig. 6b). The impact of haul cost, 
as noted above, likely contributed significantly to this result. The balanced 
scenario prioritized about half of the top 10 projects near the I-40 corridor 
but showed less clustering than the revenue scenario (fig. 6c).

For each project area we used the outputs to plot production frontiers 
(PFs, fig. 7) to illustrate priority tradeoffs. Results showed that prioritizing 
reduction in ACF negatively impacted potential net value (green dot, fig. 7). 
Similarly, maximizing net revenue showed a negative tradeoff in terms of 
treating areas with ACF (purple dot, fig. 7). The range in net value from all 
nine scenarios was -$68,612 to $661,272 while the range in reduction of ACF 
among the nine scenarios was less than 1 percent. Prioritizing even the third

best project in terms of net value in an effort to reduce ACF at 1.3 percent 
resulted in a significant opportunity cost (ca. $269,694). This results from 
the scarcity of stands that have the potential to produce positive net value. 
The location of optimal project areas changed substantially when different 
restoration objectives were prioritized (fig. 7, right panel).
Contrasting the two benchmark scenarios with the balanced scenario for a 
5-year plan of work treating roughly 45,000 ha (fig. 8, dashed vertical line), 
optimizing net value resulted in a 31 percent reduction in ACF (fig. 8a) while 
generating $12,529,345 in revenue (fig. 8b). The balanced optimization

scenario reduced ACF 45 percent while generating $5,676,058 in revenue. 
Alternatively, optimizing the reduction in ACF decreased ACF by 48 percent 
but required $2,020,548 in additional subsidies. An additional 17 percent of 
the total ACF that is treatable would be reduced in the ACF scenario versus 
the net value optimized scenario. However, that reduction would come at an 
opportunity cost of $10.5 million (fig. 8). 
At increasing scales of implementation, the analysis suggested that 
prioritizing projects based on net revenue could generate increasing positive 
revenues for 58,810 ha of treatment (54 x 1,000 ha projects) (fig. 8b), after 
which the availability of stands with positive value has been exhausted 
leading to diminishing returns. By contrast, a scenario where projects are 
prioritized to reduce ACF would require additional subsidies after the first 
four projects (fig. 8). Even in the balanced scenario, 33 percent of the first 40 
projects resulted in unprofitable solutions, and unprofitable solutions started 
showing up after 7 projects.
When we compare the top 40 restoration projects identified in our scenarios 
(based on objectives) with planned restoration projects as part of 4FRI, we 
showed that there are opportunities to better optimize net value and reduction 
in ACF (fig. 9). In particular, the “best” project provides opportunities to 
balance both net value and a reduction in ACF that exceed progress towards 
these restoration objectives in comparison to any proposed 4FRI project, and 
many perform better than the economic optimization scenarios. The majority 
of proposed projects, however, are clustered near or even below the 40th 
best project identified in the modeling. We expect the priorities to shift as 
users change the input variables or weights. ACF was used as a restoration 
surrogate here, and it is important to note that some of these proposed 4FRI 
projects were chosen based on different prioritization criteria, including 
wildland urban interface or watershed health, than the ACF indicator 
analyzed here.

The longer the curve, the more opportunities there are on the landscape to change

Discussion
Collaborative forest landscape restoration programs on western United 
States public lands face substantial challenges to sustain the pace and scale 
of treatments under current budgets and economic conditions. Given that 
financial constraints are a major factor that limit wider implementation of 
forest restoration activities in the western United States, and elsewhere 
(Aronson and Alexander 2013), the modeling demonstrated in this study has 
the potential to improve the current ad hoc treatment prioritization methods 
that use GIS overlays and various scoring templates. Our methods have been 
demonstrated on other landscapes in the United States (Ager et al. 2017) and 
elsewhere (Alcasena et al. 2018; Salis et al. 2016) to identify optimal project 
areas and examine financial and ecological tradeoffs among management 
objectives (Ager et al. 2010; Ager et al. 2016). Heretofore, optimization tools 
to study tradeoffs and prioritize landscapes have not been available as routine 
planning tools to guide Forest Service restoration investments, although 
various experimental systems that exceed the technical capacity of planning 
teams have been demonstrated (Schroder et al. 2016). Thus, decisions about 
restoration priorities have been made without a complete picture of the 
financial cost to emphasize one restoration objective versus another. 
We found that reducing crown fire and restoring fire resiliency in the 
southwestern U.S. study area can be accomplished with positive net revenue 
for a substantial area of treatments. Among the three scenarios, treating about 
44,000 ha and optimizing net value resulted in a 29 percent reduction in 
ACF (fig. 8a) and generated $12,150,525 in revenue (fig. 8b). By contrast, 
the balanced scenario reduced ACF substantially more (by a third to 41 
percent), while generating less revenue ($5,759,525) but still showing a 
net return. Finally, optimizing ACF reduced crown fire area by 44 percent, 
a marginal increase from the balanced scenario, but required $2,295,907 
in investment. The results confirm that restoring expansive southwestern 
U.S. ponderosa pine forests to improve fire resiliency can pose significant 
financial challenges as in other restoration environments (Allen et al. 2002), 
but underscores that projecting revenue from harvested wood as part of the 
restoration planning ultimately improves the likelihood that projects will 
be implemented (i.e., contractors bid on the sale). Indeed, a portion of that 
revenue can be designated to fund restoration activities in locations where 
forest and fuel management do not generate a net positive value (Deal et al. 
2012; USDA FS 2012). 
Our economic analysis is consistent with earlier studies that demonstrated 
the financial challenge of forest restoration in the southwestern region 
and elsewhere in the western United States, and that subsidies will be 
required to scale up treatments (Barbour et al. 2008; Beck Group 2015; 
Rainville et al. 2008). More importantly, our large case study showed the 
importance of prioritization in the planning phase to develop scenarios that 

USDA Forest Service RMRS GTR-423. 2021. 
19
are economically viable. The prioritization process is important at multiple 
scales; both the location of the project area and the stands selected within 
them determine financial and ecological outcomes. The relative importance 
of prioritization at these different scales in terms of achieving restoration 
outcomes over the long run has not been investigated. 
The results of our study were used by the 4FRI implementation team to guide 
a 5-year plan of work in terms of the location of project areas and stands to 
treat within them. We are unaware of similar case studies on federal lands 
where the application of forest optimization models (Schroder et al. 2016) 
led to implementation decisions about priority landscapes for treatments. 
More importantly, the application of our model as part of the collaborative 
planning process cultivated a keen interest in further studies to add ecological 
indicators and performance measures. The modeling can also be widely 
extended to optimize the spatial implementation of natural and prescribed 
fire to address the fire deficit (Minas and Hearne 2016) and growing backlog 
of areas that are in need of fire treatments (Ager et al. 2013; Alcasena et al. 
2018; Chung et al. 2013). These experiments can be conducted as part of 
prioritizing treatments on the additional 560 thousand ha in the 4FRI project 
once the final environmental impact statement is completed. 
This work along with many other studies contributes to achieving long-term 
social and ecological goals for U.S. national forest restoration programs 
and collaborative efforts such as the National Cohesive Wildland Fire 
Management Strategy and Shared Stewardship (USDA FS 2014, 2018). 
Our framework could be expanded to other CFLRP project areas and other 
landscape restoration initiatives, including the USDA Forest Service and 
Natural Resources Conservation Service Joint Chiefs’ Landscape Restoration 
Partnership. Spatial decision support tools beyond ad hoc GIS overlays and 
various scoring methods are largely lacking for the design of viable projects 
where the specific wood products mix generated from restoration activities 
(i.e., log size, species, value) is modeled over a simulated implementation. 
Moreover, the analysis contributes to the broader collaborative aspects of 
the CFLRP, which were funded specifically to build trust among private and 
public entities (Schultz et al. 2012). 
Decision support tools presented in this study can build transparency among 
federal land managers and stakeholders by illustrating tradeoffs among 
social and economic objectives, as described in our previous work (Ager 
et al. 2017). Furthermore, it is an opportunity to include stakeholders in 
the planning process (Butler et al. 2015) rather than a body to review the 
decision and respective rationale. Although there is extensive research on 
the application of decision support to forest management issues (Nobre 
et al. 2016), most are concerned with regulated forests, and very few if 
any studies meet the needs of applied restoration planners in terms of 
applicability to either short- or long-term planning problems. For instance, 
spatial optimization has been applied to a wide range of forest management 
goals, including designing wildlife habitat reserves, locating fuel breaks, 
suppression activities, and harvest scheduling (Baskent et al. 2000; Borges 
et al. 2014; Rönnqvist et al. 2015; Schroder et al. 2016). However, the level 
of analytical support, especially for mathematical programming and heuristic

20
approaches (Hof and Bevers 2002; Rönnqvist et al. 2015), is not available 
to restoration planners within the CFLRP process, and it is in general scarce 
at all administrative levels of planning in the Forest Service and other U.S. 
federal land management agencies. 
The need for scenario planning frameworks to address federal forest 
restoration issues is unprecedented in an era of climate change and the 
growing scale of natural disturbances such as wildfire. Scenario planning 
is a systematic approach to think creatively about possible complex and 
uncertain futures (Peterson et al. 2003; Spies et al. 2017; Star et al. 2016), 
rather than focusing on the accurate prediction of a single outcome. Although 
in its current form we did not analyze uncertainties associated with predicted 
outcomes, the model does provide the ability to examine many alternative 
outcome responses to different restoration priorities. Our model can be 
readily applied to participatory scenario planning exercises where research 
scientists, managers, policymakers, and other stakeholders explore and 
test scenarios in an iterative process. In this way the system functions as 
a multicriteria platform to explore landscape management scenarios that 
are optimized in terms of where and how to achieve different outcomes 
and outputs at different administrative scales. At present, national decision 
support models do not exist to examine alternative scenarios to allocate the 
approximately $1 billion annual investment in forest and fuel management 
activities to the 10 regions and 154 U.S. national forests. In prior work we 
demonstrated application of the model at much larger scales (western United 
States) to understand production frontiers and tradeoffs among agency-wide 
targets and management goals (Ager et al. 2019) and assessed near-term 
progress towards nationally identified priorities and targets. 
A particularly promising expansion of our work is to support the new 
FS emphases on cross-boundary management to increase the scale of 
active forest management (USDA FS 2018). Our planning model here 
can potentially have widespread application for coprioritizing investment 
decisions as outlined in the shared stewardship memorandums of 
understanding (MOU) (USDA FS 1999). Specifically, these call for “new 
mapping and decision tools to locate treatments where they can do the most 
good, thereby protecting communities, watersheds, and economies where 
the risks are greatest” (USDA FS 2019). The core idea in this initiative is 
to expand land treatments across boundaries to reduce the scale mismatch 
between wildfire risk and the current forest management footprint (Ager et 
al. 2015). However, the process will require spatial planning to coprioritize 
projects, meaning that respective federal and state assessments on land 
conditions (threats and opportunities) will require a multicriteria approach 
(Diaz-Balteiro and Romero 2008) to integrate the respective priorities 
identified in agency and state assessments and understand tradeoffs. This has 
been completed in the State of New Mexico as part of the State Forest Action 
Plan (Day et al. 2021; New Mexico State Forestry 2020). Assessments of 
cross-boundary risk (Ager et al. 2018) can be integrated into this process and 
used as a management priority to target forest treatments where wildfires are 
predicted to spread across federal and state boundaries.

Conclusions
We developed and applied a spatial forest planning model that can 
be used to improve the efficiency of collaborative and other planning 
efforts on U.S, public forests. The model can also be used to support the 
coprioritization efforts as part of the Forest Service Shared Stewardship 
initiative (USDA FS 2018) where boundary-spanning projects are being 
designed and implemented to expand the scale of treatments. The model 
is substantially less complex than typical spatial forest planning models, 
while providing adequate functionality for prioritizing restoration objectives 
and understanding multicriteria tradeoffs. In the current application we 
demonstrated the model to prioritize both an economic and an ecological 
objective for a large restoration project in the southwestern United States 
where forest management is constrained by low economic value of forest 
materials removed as part of restoration activities. 
We examined a large number of scenarios that optimized ecological or 
economic objectives, plus we identified a scenario that adequately satisfied 
both objectives, thus ensuring the financial viability of the project. The 
methods also allowed comparison of proposed projects within scenarios to 
enable more optimal solutions and better understand the efficiency associated 
with current planning. The approach, therefore, has widespread application 
as part of collaborative forest landscape restoration on federal forests in the 
United States or where similar economic conditions prevent wider scale 
application of restoration activities. 
Most importantly, such a modeling approach will be crucial as a scenario 
planning tool to enlarge the footprint of forest management activities 
and thus address the growing threat of wildfire across the West. Shared 
stewardship activities with interagency coprioritization will be necessary to 
identify scenarios that meet the respective interests of multiple landowners 
and stakeholders. Here, our model provides quantitative tradeoffs and clear 
production frontiers at multiple scales to help improve transparency in the 
multi-owner forest planning environment.

Appendix A. Additional Modeling Details
Figure A1—Illustration of how delta active crown fire was calculated from Forest Vegetation Simulator (Dixon 2002) outputs 
where stands receive silvicultural treatments (thinning, mastication and underburning) and post-treatment wildfire behavior is 
compared with stands that receive no treatments.  Potential crown fire behavior was estimated with FlamMap (Brittain 2015). 
See text for more details.

Figure A2—Decision logic for the optimization model used to locate project areas. The algorithm tests each stand as the 
seed location for a project, and absorbs adjacent stands until a total area treated constraint is met. The model identifies the 
aggregate of polygons that maximize the restoration objective and the polygons that require treatment. In the current study, 
polygons were defined as stands, treatment thresholds were measured by potential flame length, activity constraint was the 
total treatment allowance per project of 1000 ha, and restoration priorities were: 1) maximize revenue, 2) reduce crown fire, 
and 3) a balance between the two.  Figure taken from Ager et al. (2013).
