SOUTHWESTERN DROUGHT AND LANDSCAPE-SCALE VEGETATION DIEBACK: THE 1950s AND NOW

Drought in the Southwestern U.S. during the 1950s caused substantial dieback of woody and herbaceous vegetation 
across the region. Similar regional vegetation mortality is occurring due to the ongoing drought in the Southwest.  This 
presentation will describe, compare, and contrast vegetation dieback in the Jemez Mountains during the 1950s and today.  
Topics addressed include:  1) reconstruction of 1950s forest and woodland dieback from aerial photos, dating of dead 
wood, and historic documents;  2) the differing demographic effects of these two droughts upon local populations of piñon 
(Pinus edulis);  and 3) effects of the current drought upon tree-growth and herbaceous vegetation, determined through 
long-term measurements of dendrometer growth bands on ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and piñon trees and 3 km 
of vegetation transects.  These results highlight the magnitude, rapidity, and complexity of drought-induced vegetation 
dieback, and provide an analog for potential nonlinear impacts of climate change to global ecosystems. 
 
 
REGIONAL AND LOCAL PATTERNS OF BARK BEETLE INDUCED TREE MORTALITY ON THE COLORADO 
PLATEAU

We investigated patterns of bark beetle infestation across the Colorado Plateau in response to the recent drought, using 
both regional aerial survey data, and local ground-based field data.  Aerial surveys in ponderosa and pinyon-juniper 
ecosystems from 2000 to 2003 showed up to ten-fold increases in area affected from year to year. Mortality was more 
widespread in Arizona compared to Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico.  Generally, beetles were found to attack more 
stressed forest habitats, including cinder cones, south facing slopes, and ponderosa / PJ transition zones. Over time, as 
these infestations grew in size, they moved from these marginal areas into less stressed sites. By the summer of 2003, 
some populations of ponderosa or pinyon pine had been entirely decimated by bark beetles. In field sites of pinyon-juniper 
in northern Arizona which have been continuously monitored for up to six years, initial bark beetle attack was patchy and 
appeared to be heavily localized; later mortality was widespread and affected predominantly pinyons. However, tree 
mortality was spatially variable and adjacent sites often experienced large differences in pinyon mortality, often 
attributable to environmental differences in habitat. Preliminary analysis of both aerial and field data from 2003 suggests 
that the potential for increased attack rates in coming years is still high, and that bark beetle populations may continue to 
increase despite near normal precipitation in 2003. 
 
  
HOLOCENE VEGETATION & FOREST FIRE REGIMES IN SUBALPINE & MIXED CONIFER FORESTS, SOUTHERN

We have produced several Holocene-length and longer records of vegetation and fire for high elevation sites in the 
southern Rocky Mountains and Jemez Mountains of Colorado and New Mexico.  Our elevational transect of sites includes 
locations at the alpine – treeline boundary, within the engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) – subalpine fir (Abies 
lasiocarpa) forest, the mixed conifer forest, and the oak (Quercus) – pine (Pinus) woodland.  Each forest type possesses 
a characteristic forest fire regime.  Our high-resolution fire history records are determined from fine interval sediment 
sampling and charcoal particle analysis.  For most sites, especially those in and near the spruce – fir forest, extreme 
“peakedness” is apparent in the charcoal record, each peak corresponding to stand-replacing fires within the watershed.  
Preliminary fire event frequency calculations are on the order of 150 – 200 years.  Two upper treeline sites have the 
smallest deposition rates of charcoal, which may be due to their open nature and significant portions of the drainage basin 
above treeline that contributes less charcoal to the record when burned.  Lower elevation mixed conifer sites show 
significantly higher charcoal concentrations throughout the Holocene (one to two orders of magnitude) than at the spruce 
– fir sites.  The pattern of charcoal record “peakedness” is less prominent at the mixed conifer sites, where surface fires 
may have been more common, although the stand-replacing regime becomes more pronounced in the late Holocene.  
Periods of highest fire event frequency occur from ca. 1,000 to 2,000 and ca. 9,000 to 12,000 calendar years ago.  The 
most significant changes in the fire record occur within sediments deposited in the late 19th and early 20th century, when 
charcoal is essentially absent.  There is no analog to this phenomenon in the earlier record.  This period corresponds to 
initiation of widespread cattle and sheep grazing in the region, and the initiation of the fire suppression period.  Major

shifts in the pollen record occur contemporaneously with these important environmental changes, including an increase in 
oak at many sites within the mixed conifer forest.

Throughout the American West conflicts between pumas and humans have increased. A study was initiated during 2002 
in northern Arizona to obtain basic information about puma ecology in the Flagstaff and Walnut Canyon areas. One of the 
study’s primary objectives was to describe and analyze puma movements and habitat use, especially relative to human 
features.  Topographic roughness is thought to be important to puma hunting success and may affect puma selection of 
den sites.  Rough terrain facilitates ambush predation and may provide increased security for cubs from adult pumas.  
Rough terrain may also provide pumas security while near humans and affect the frequency and nature of human-puma 
interactions.  We developed an index of surface roughness to analyze spatial relations among topography, ecological 
resources and puma activity.  Using geographic information systems (GIS) and global positioning technology (GPS) we 
anticipate that the results of this analysis will provide for a greater understanding of how and why cougars use the 
physical geography in northern Arizona.

The western yellow -billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus occidentalis) is often found in riparian habitats consisting mostly 
of dense cottonwood-willow, mixed broadleaf and scrub vegetation. Human-induced actions have resulted in a decline of 
riparian yellow -billed cuckoo habitat throughout the state of Arizona. We developed a predictive suitability model and 
compiled a coarse level distribution of potential yellow -billed cuckoo habitat for the state of Arizona. Field observations of 
bird locations, census surveys and gross vegetation composition and structural parameters were entered into a 
geographic information system (GIS). These data, along with GAP vegetation data, were used to develop the coarse level 
potential distribution for the species. YBCU potential habitat suitability indices were calculated based on vegetation type, 
patch size, and elevation. Using GIS technology, the suitability model attempts to predict optimal, suitable, marginal, and 
unsuitable potential YBCU habitat for the state of Arizona. Model results indicate that approximately 80% of all potential 
habitat is optimal yellow-billed cuckoo habitat. The number of observed YBCU occurrences and vegetation characteristics 
observed in survey patches were significantly related to potential yellow -billed cuckoo habitat suitability. Additional 
research may further refine and validate the suitability model to provide a greater understanding of potential yellow -billed 
cuckoo habitat in Arizona.

Southwestern ponderosa pine forests have been altered over the last century due to management practices such as fire 
suppression, overgrazing, and unsustainable logging practices.  Long-term permanent plots offer one of the most 
promising avenues of quantifying these changes over time.  Here we use the Hill plots, a series of permanent plots 
established in 1912 on five sites in northern Arizona, to describe changes in the understory and overstory vegetation.  
Herbaceous and shrub vegetation on the plots were mapped periodically between 1912 and 1941.  We remeasured all 
plots in 2002 and, for this preliminary analysis, digitized the maps of a subset of the plots from one site (Black Springs) in 
1914, 1941, and 2002.  We analyzed the total basal cover and the proportion of basal cover attributable to functional 
groups (forb, legume, C3 graminoid, C4 graminoid).  Total basal cover declined by more than half between 1914 and 
2002 (from 12.4 to 5.7%); most of this decline occurred between 1914 and 1941.  Forbs and legumes declined in 
importance while graminoids exhibited little directional change.  We also measured the overstory structure (tree age, size, 
density) around the plots at present and reconstructed the overstory in 1914 and 1941.  Tree density increased by an 
order of magnitude (39.7 trees/ha in 1914; 410.1 trees/ha at present); similar changes were also noted in quadratic mean 
diameter, basal area, and Reineke’s stand density index.  Changes in understory cover were associated with increasing 
overstory.  These results indicate that historical community structure on these plots differs significantly from that found at 

 
25 
present and further suggest that the tremendous increase in tree density has redirected successional pathways and 
processes.  While these plots do not represent reference conditions sinc e the herbaceous vegetation in 1912 was 
recovering from previous overgrazing, they do provide valuable insight to guide restoration of the understory community in 
these forests.  Further analysis will consider additional sites and will examined the dynamics of individual species.  
Protection of these and other permanent plots should be a management priority.

During the summer of 2002, mortality levels of Colorado pinyon (Pinus edulis) throughout northern Arizona and New 
Mexico increased dramatically.  For instance, one study in northern New Mexico indicated that 71.5 percent of the 
pinyons, greater than 10 feet tall, had died by August of 2002.  Similar surveys in the San Francisco Peaks area of 
northern Arizona recorded up to 90 percent mortality of pinyon.  We have evaluated monthly precipitation data from this 
region in an attempt to determine the thresholds of drought levels that can induce mortality to this species.  We found that 
the five-month period that preceded the emergence of bark beetles, January to May of 2002, was marked by excessive 
drought.  Two weather stations in the pinyon-juniper zone at Los Alamos, New Mexico, recorded 0.86 inches and 1.07 
inches for this time period.  A weather station in Flagstaff, Arizona, recorded 1.22 inches for the same time period.  This 
corresponds to approximately 0.21 inches per month, or 2.52 inches per year.  We hypothesize that this level of drought is 
sufficient to predispose pinyon to massive attack by bark beetles.  Secondary to the effects of short-term precipitation 
deficiencies, drought-induced mortality is also influenced by other factors, such as tree density, long-term drought 
conditions, elevational gradients, and microtopography.

Grand Canyon National Park is known as a natural park, one of the seven wonders of the world and a World Heritage 
Site.  Yet, behind the scenery lies human history dating back 10,000 years and a human story that stretches back to the 
creation of many of the aboriginal peoples of the Colorado Plateau.  Despite the age old vision of the  canyon and its 
formations as a static landscape, the pressures of today’s management are ever present.  A bathroom here, a trail there, 
a new building somewhere else.  Typically, cultural res ources are brought into the picture only as part of the compliance 
process, after the decisions have been made.  As we enter the 21st century, we are attempting to use cultural resource 
information as part of the planning process, rather than a necessary evil of compliance at the end of the development 
process.  Through good resource inventory and up front tribal consultation, we are attempting to use cultural resources to 
shape management actions.  We will use examples from current planning efforts, in particular the Colorado River 
Management Plan, the Backcountry Management Plan and the Fire Ecosystem Landscape Analysis, to discuss ways in 
which cultural resource information is being used to help guide alternatives development and management plans.  With 
the openness of park managers, we have been able to be part of the planning and research development teams, gaining 
early involvement in the processes and ensuring that good resource information is incorporated into the process.  Cultural 
resources research has proven invaluable in many cases, providing a platform for resource based management rarely 
seen at Grand Canyon.

There are multiple concepts for the conservation of species from single-species to habitat-based approaches, including 
population genetics. In this paper we take a habitat-genetics approach in order to synthesize multiple conservation 
concepts. Habitats based on naturally hybridizing host plants represent diversity hotspots, biogeographic crossroads, and 
zones of transition. Furthermore, by considering the genetic diversity of the habitat, a rich habitat mosaic w ith multiple 
species over multiple trophic levels will be conserved, resulting in the conservation of evolutionary and ecological 
processes. The model system of naturally hybridizing cottonwoods (Populus angustifolia x P. fremontii) in western North 
America illustrates how many conservation approaches can be synthesized into an efficient conservation strategy. We 
tested the general hypothesis that arthropod alpha and beta diversity are correlated with cottonwood genetic diversity 
from local to regional scales. In both common garden experiments and field surveys in hybrid zones, leaf-modifying 

 
26 
arthropod richness was greater on either the F1 or backcross hybrid cross-types than pure Fremont cottonwoods. Also, 
community composition was different between these three classes of cottonwoods at all scales. Within a river system 
cottonwood hybrid zones had the greatest richness, and community composition was different between the two parental 
zones and the hybrid zone, thus demonstrating a hierarchical concentration of diversity. Since natural cottonwood hybrids 
had the greatest genetic diversity and arthropod diversity, habitat genetics can be an important and efficient conservation 
tool synthesizing multiple conservation strategies.

Regression analysis of data collected from 1988-1995 in the  Flagstaff area showed that the percentages of ponderosa 
pine with cones in mid-summer explained 49% of variation in the turkey poult:hen ratio a year in advance (r = .70, P < 
0.03). The positive correlation between the two variables broke down from 1996 – 2001 after northern Arizona 
experienced a severe drought in 1996. Possible explanations for the loss of correlation between the two variables 
included reproduction failure by turkey hens in 1996 and a lack of nonproductive yearling hens the following year, driving 
the observed poult:hen ratio up after a year of low mast production. In other years after the drought of 1996, pinions and 
junipers produced abundant mast that persisted on the ground for over a year. Persistent mast from these species and 
Gambel oak could have masked variation in mast production by ponderosa pine and/or density dependent factors 
operating within a relatively high population of turkeys may have affected reproduction more than the abundant food 
supply from 1997 – 2001.

In recent years, the southwestern United States has entered into a prolonged drought that has included two years (1996 
and 2002) of extreme drought conditions.  Drought can have severe negative consequences for animal fitness, but the 
magnitude and predictability of those effects is still unclear.  Here, we gather together data sets from several recent multi-
year studies of reproductive success in southwestern passerine birds and examine the relationship between interannual 
variation in rainfall patterns and bird reproductive output.

In Fall 2001, the ground-breaking Missing Linkages report identified 232 wildlife linkages in California 
(http://scwildlands.org/). South Coast Wildlands Project immediately spearheaded an effort to prioritize, protect, and 
restore linkages in the South Coast Ecoregion. We first forged a partnership with 15 federal and state agencies, 
conservation NGOs, universities, and county and transportation planning agencies. By partnering from the start (rather 
than developing a plan on our own and asking others to “unite under us”), we garnered spectacular support from all 
sectors and are making rapid progress. With our partners, we (1) prioritized 15 linkages (out of 69 linkages in the 
ecoregion) on the basis of irreplaceability (size & quality of core areas served) and vulnerability; (2) held a workshop to 
identify 12 to 20 focal species per linkage; and (3) researched the needs of focal species, obtained high-resolution GIS 
data, and conducted field visits to develop a linkage design. This fall we will (4) present the design at a second workshop 
at which our partners volunteer to procure easements, acquire land, change zoning, restore habitat, or mitigate 
transportation projects. Our collaborative, science-based approach provides a template for creating a green infrastructure 
in even the most human-dominated landscapes. 
 
 
RESPONSE OF SOIL BIOTA IN AN UNGRAZED SEMI-ARID GRASSLAND TO THE INVASION OF THE EXOTIC

Bromus tectorum is an exotic annual grass that currently dominates many western U.S. semi-arid ecosystems.  In 1995, 
Bromus invaded two types of never grazed (by domestic livestock) and unburned perennial bunchgrass communities in 
SE Utah, USA.  This study compared the soil food web structure of the two native grassland associations (Stipa (S) and 
Hilaria (H)), with and without Bromus.  Perennial grass and total vascular plant cover were higher in S than H plots, while 
quantities of ground litter was similar.  Lower trophic levels were more abundant in H plots, whereas S plots had more 
abundant higher trophic levels.  Plant litter was 2.2x higher in Hilaria/Bromus (HB) than H plots, and 2.8x higher in 
Stipa/Bromus (SB) than S plots.  Soil biota in HB generally responded to the Bromus invasion in an opposite manner than 

 
27 
SB.  Active bacteria decreased in H vs HB, while increasing in S vs SB.  Dead plant-infecting fungi decreased in H vs HB 
and increased in S vs SB.  Soil and live plant-infecting fungi were the exception, as they increased in both types of 
invaded plots relative to uninvaded plots.  Most higher trophic level organisms increased in HB relative to H, while 
decreasing in SB relative to S.  These results illustrate that 1) soil food web structure can vary widely within what would 
generally be considered one vegetation type (semi-arid grassland), depending on plant species composition within that 
type; and 2) addition of a common resource can evoke disparate responses from individual food web compartments, 
depending on their original structure, indicating structure of these soil food webs appears to be controlled by both plant 
inputs and internal dynamics between trophic levels. We also will explore whether or not alterations in soil food webs 
impact the success of native grasses.

Grasslands are relatively rare on the Colorado Plateau.  In SE Utah, grasslands are restricted to soils deeper than 1 m, 
and most soils in the Colorado Plateau region are shallower than that. In addition, many former grasslands have been 
converted to almost monotypic stands of sagebrush as a result of livestock grazing. Canyonlands National Park contains 
a 150 ha grassland that has never been grazed. Plants, biological soil crusts, and nutrients were first documented in this 
grassland in 1964. For the past 8 years (beginning in 1996) we have conducted spring and fall surveys in this grassland. 
This grassland consists of distinct patches dominated either by Stipa hymenoides and Stipa comata (both C3 grasses) or 
dominated by Hilaria jamesii (a C4 grass).  During this time, we have looked at the dy namics of the vascular plant 
vegetation, biological soil crusts, P cycling, N cycling, and soil food webs in these two patch types. In addition, a 1995 
invasion of the exotic annual grass Bromus tectorum into some of the Hilaria patches has allowed us to w atch how plants, 
soil crusts, and nutrients respond to invasion and the implications for conservation of this community. We will present the 
results of our 8 year study, discuss how things have changed since 1964, and how invasion has altered the trajectory of 
this ecosystem. 
 
 
EFFECTS OF THINNING ON DWARF MISTLETOE SHOOT GROWTH IN PONDEROSA PINE STANDS

Effects of host tree vigor and physiological condition on dwarf mistletoe development are poorly understood. Using the 
obligate heterotroph Arceuthobium vaginatum var. cryptopodum (Viscaceae) and its host Pinus ponderosa, we 
investigated how reduced competition with forest thinning influenced shoot development after experimental removal of 
aerial shoots from intact endophytic systems in a northern Arizona forest. Trees in a thinned site were paired with controls 
(n=19) based on tree size and dwarf mistletoe rating. We removed dwarf mistletoe shoots in April, before the onset of the 
growing season.  Shoot regrowth in the thinned stand was significantly greater that in the control stand. Trees in the 
thinned stand had significantly higher xylem predawn water potentials in mid-summer and light-saturated net 
photosynthetic rates in spring and summer.  These findings support the hypothesis that increased resource uptake by 
host trees stimulates increased dwarf mistletoe shoot performance. 
 
 
LANDSCAPE LEGACIES:  PREDATORS, PREY, AND ALDO LEOPOLD ON THE KAIBAB PLATEAU

A central paradigm in wildlife ecology is that predation is a good thing for prey species:  predation limits the population of 
the prey, and keeps the prey from overpopulating and devastating the ecosystem.  Aldo Leopold advocated this appealing 
idea using the classic story of the Kaibab deer herd as an illustration.  In more recent times, Leopold has been taken to 
task for inventing some of the story -- in reality, data are simply too sparse to support or refute the classic story.  We used 
aspen demography data to test the Leopold deer irruption story, as aspen recruitment is sensitive to browsing pressure 
from both livestock and wildlife.  If this classic story was true, then high browsing pressure from deer should have resulted 
in few aspen stems regenerating successfully between 1918 and 1928.  If aspen demography showed a normal rate of 
aspen recruitment for this period (relative to earlier and later periods), the story of severe habitat degradation would be 
refuted.  Similarly, if the estimates of >200,000 heads of livestock in the 1880s were accurate, then we would also expect 
few if any aspen stems to have regenerated between 1880 and 1890.  We also investigated other regional and landscape-
level factors that may simultaneously influence aspen recruitment, particularly changing climate and fire regimes.  The 
age distribution of aspen from more than 200 plots in the Kaibab National Forest showed:  1) some aspen are more than 
200 years old; 2) aspen recruitment rose dramatically in the 1880s and 1890s (coincident with cessation of regular fires on 
the Plateau), 3) very little aspen recruitment in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1950s, and 4) abundant aspen recruitment in the 
1970s and 1980s.  Aspen demography cannot directly prove the predator/prey idea, but the pattern was indeed consistent 
with Leopold’s view of the role of predators in regulating prey populations and sustaining healthy ecosystems.

PREDICTING THE POTENTIAL COVER, COMPOSITION, AND FUNCTION OF BIOLOGICAL SOIL CRUSTS IN

Biological soil crusts are a common soil surface community in semi-arid lands that perform numerous important 
ecosystem services. To determine if the potential biological soil crust cover and composition could be predicted for a large 
area based upon geology and precipitation geographic information systems (GIS) data layers, we sampled 109 relatively 
undisturbed sites in Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument.  We found that a model of moderately high mean 
accuracy and precision, 67% and plus or minus 10% respectively, for cover of five crust types (light cyanobacterial, dark 
cyanobacterial, moss, lichen, and moss + lichen) could be achieved using classification and regression tree (CART) 
models and a parsimonious set of predictor variables. The R2 values for the five models were 0.44, 0.53, 0.56, 0.66, and 
0.46. We also attempted to determine the relationship between chlorophyll a (a proxy for cyanobacterial biomass) and the 
slake test (a measure of soil aggregate stability). We found three major patterns: 1) On sandy  non-calcareous soils, 
cyanobacterial biomass appears to be the primary warm season soil stabilizer (R2 values up to 0.90), 2) The relationship 
between chlorophyll and soil stability differed greatly between major soil types, and 3) During an extreme drought year the 
relationship between chlorophyll a and soil stability was considerably weaker. Data layers generated in this fashion may 
allow land managers to better evaluate rangeland health by comparing the modeled potential soil crust condition of a site 
with its actual condition.

One of the fundamental determinants of  ecosystem pattern and function on the Colorado Plateau and other semiarid 
environments is plant-available water.  However, few studies evaluate plant-available water directly and how the water-
balance directly affects plant-available water.  The presentation covers several areas related to these topics:  (1) how 
does soil water and plant-available water vary spatially and temporally, both horizontally and vertically, for wet vs. dry 
years, and snow - vs. rain-dominated months, (2) how does plant water potential vary prior to and during tree mortality, (3) 
what aspects of the water budget require further investigation to improve our understanding of plant-available water (e.g., 
interception; evaporation vs. transpiration)?  Long-term observations from the Pajarito Plateau in northern New Mexico 
allow insights into these topics. 
 
 
HISTORICAL ECOLOGY AND LAND MANAGEMENT ON THE COLORADO PLATEAU: THE TALES TREES TELL

The Colorado Plateau is a region both rich in and shaped by a multitude of histories: geological, c ultural, and natural.  
Renowned for its spectacular geological and vibrant cultural histories, the Plateau’s natural history is no less complex nor 
varied, nor less intriguing to reconstruct.  Historical ecology is the study of environments and ecological conditions over 
the past several centuries to millennia, using natural archives such as tree rings, packrat middens, sediment deposits, and 
pollen to reconstruct plant communities, disturbance regimes, and climate changes.  And, increasingly, historical ec ology 
is a critical component in contemporary management of National Forests, Parks, and other public lands in the West.  
Grazing, logging, and fire suppression have disrupted natural processes and led, in many instances, to unsustainable 
conditions in ecosystem structure or function.  A central use of historical ecology is to provide models of longer-term 
ecosystem behavior that can be used as baseline data for ecological restoration efforts. In this talk, I focus on ways in 
which researchers reconstruct natural histories and how such data are applied to management of contemporary 
ecosystems.  I concentrate on use of tree-ring data to reconstruct forest and fire histories on the Colorado Plateau and the 
Front Range of Colorado.  I also will describe drought history from tree-rings, with the message that the recent drought is 
not the worst the Southwest has seen in recent centuries.

Large and intense wildfires have struck the western half of the White Mountain Apache Reservation in east-central 
Arizona in 1996, 2000, 2002, and 2003.  Past wildfires have accelerated erosion of some springs, which are critical 
ecological and cultural resources for the Tribe because of the importance of spring water in sustaining life.  While earlier 
rehabilitation plans did not focus on springs, more recent ones have prioritized the assessment and rehabilitation of 
springs.  With support from the rehabilitation plan for the Rodeo-Chediski fire, we have photographed and assessed 32 
springs on the west side of the Reservation within the area affected by that enormous wildfire.  At each spring, we have 
recorded basic, qualitative indicators of the physical, vegetative, and hydrologic conditions of the springs.  These 

 
29 
indicators were compared to the geologic and topographic positions of the springs within the landscape.  Long-term 
records of changes in the physical condition of the springs are generally not available.  Instead, the project has relied on 
interviews with elders, forestry technicians, boundary fence workers, and other community members who had personal 
knowledge of specific sites.  Results of the assessments have shown that many formerly lush springs currently lack 
surface flow and wetland vegetation, while many others with surface flow and key wetland species have shown evidence 
of downcutting.  At springs that appeared unhealthy and unstable, treatments have been planned and implemented, 
including fencing around the head of the spring and placing riffle formations to inhibit downcutting.  The cultural and 
ecological significance of springs demands that tribal staff with a variety of skills be consulted when proposing treatments.  
The unique settings and treatment needs of many of the sites have required preparing customized treatment plans to 
obtain funding through various Tribal and Federal programs.  The results of this effort will be used to build a long-term 
record of spring conditions and to evaluate the responses of springs both to wildfires and to post-fire rehabilitation 
treatments.

After fire or restoration, natural understory regeneration is often sparse, limited to few species and dominated by weeds. 
Sowing seed is the common method for grass re-establishment, but in arid pine communities, grasses often fail to 
establish from seed.  Genetically appropriate locally obtained seed is in short supply.  Alternatives to direct seeding are to 
transplant wildlings (plants or divisions of plants) or container-grown seedlings. The purpose of this study is to compare 
the effectiveness of using seeds, seedlings, and wildlings for re-vegetation following restoration in southwestern 
ponderosa pine forests, to evaluate methods for propagating and transplanting native grasses, and to evaluate the need 
for removal of weedy competition during site preparation for planting operations.  By selecting propagules with highest 
survival and establishment and following best site preparation options, we can maximize successful regeneration of 
grasses from locally obtained native seed.  Objectives are to compare regeneration success of two grasses, Muttongrass 
(Poa fendleriana) and Junegrass (Koeleria macrantha) in competition-free and competitive situations following direct 
seedling, transplanting two sizes of wildlings (small and large) and planting two sizes of containerized seedlings (plugs 
and books).  All propagule types were planted in two different research areas: a restored ponderosa pine area that had 
been invaded by Dalmatian toadflax (Linaria dalmatica), and, in an area raked free of built-up pine needles beneath 
mature ponderosa pines.  Analysis of variance of eight-month survival and establishment indicate significant differences in 
survival, establishment, reproduction and plant size by propagule type.  In the mature pine stand, seed was least 
successful for both grass species, with low germination and nearly complete seedling mortality.  Percentage of Poa 
propagules flowering and mean number of seed stalks also differ by propagule type.  Neither seeds nor plugs produced 
flowers; books and small wildlings produced flowers and seed; large wildlings had the highest percentage of flowering and 
mean number of seed stalks.  Results in the restored area indicate greater establishment of all propagule types in 
competition-free vs. competition plots.  Survival of seed in the restored area is most successful.  Initial seed germination 
of 8% (Poa) and 3% (Koeleria) has been followed by high seedling mortality (50% Poa) and (63% Koeleria).  First-year 
results for both research areas and management implications will be presented and discussed.

The endangered Southwestern Willow Flycatcher (Empidonax traillii extimus ) is a neotropical migrant that breeds in 
riparian systems throughout the southwestern United States. Although the subject of intensive study, little is known about 
home range sizes, movement patterns, and habitat requirements of individuals within the breeding season.  However, 
understanding movement patterns and habitat use are critical for the sound management and recovery of this endangered 
species.  To explore these issues, we used radio-telemetry methods to track 11 male flycatchers at Roosevelt Lake, 
Arizona, from May through July 2003.  We found home range sizes varied from 0.1 to 8.24 hectares using a 95% fixed 
kernel contour. While variation among individuals was noted, home range size and mean distances moved fluctuated 
according to time of year/breeding cycle. Home ranges were smallest for birds paired with nests and largest for birds pre- 
and post-breeding.  Long-distance movements were observed for four birds, moving distances greater than 800m. Two of 
these birds were unpaired, and the other two were possibly showing post-breeding movements. Habitat used was 
consistently within the riparian flood plain, and was primarily limited to the mature riparian patches associated with 
flycatcher breeding.  Although this first year study has provided great insight into the movement patterns and habitat use 
of adult male flycatchers, further research is needed on the seasonal and individual variability of these important 
measures.

PHYLOGEOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS OF ‘INSULAR MOUNTAINTOP’ AND ‘MAINLAND’ POPULATIONS OF THE LONG-
TAILED VOLE, Microtus longicaudis , ON THE COLORADO PLATEAU

The long-tailed vole, Microtus longicaudus , is common in montane regions throughout most of western North America.  
On the Colorado Plateau, this species occurs as insular populations at high elevations.  This type of distribution makes 
the species ideal for phylogeographic studies and permitted us to address new questions focusing on the importance of 
the Colorado River as a dispersal barrier and the genetic affinities and length of isolation of M. longicaudus  populations of 
the interior Colorado Plateau.  MtDNA cytochrome b sequence variation was compared among individuals representing 
five insular ranges of the Colorado Plateau – the Abajo, LaSal, Henry, and Chuska Mts., and Boulder Mountain of the 
Aquarius Plateau.   Our analyses include traditional phylogenetic approaches (parsimony and likelihood) as well as nested 
clade analysis, which attempts to uncover genetic and geographic structuring at the intraspecific level.  We included 
additional cyt b sequences from a study by Conroy and Cook (2000).  Our findings support previous documentation of a 
major east-west phylogeographic break equivalent in genetic distance to other sister species pairs in this genus.  This 
break occurs between populations southeast of the Colorado River (eastern Arizona, Colorado, Wyoming and New 
Mexico) and all other western populations (California, Idaho, and Wyoming), a northwest clade Alaska, British Columbia, 
Oregon, and Washington) and an Alaskan island clade.  We find further evidence that supports a differentiation of a 
‘southern Rockies’ clade and a distinct ‘southwest island’ clade, consisting of populations from the New Mexico / Arizona 
highlands and the Abajo and LaSal Mts. of southwestern Utah.  Voles from te LaSal Mts. have haplotypes shared by both 
the ‘southern Rockies’ clade and the ‘southwest island’ clade, indicating that gene flow still occurs or occurred recently 
between this range and the San Juan Mts. of southwestern Colorado.  Populations of M. longicaudus north and west of 
the Colorado River (Boulder and Henry Mts.) share two haplotypes, form a well-supported subclade with populations from 
the Kaibab plateau, and are closely related to the Northwest clade.  These results are supported by other molecular 
studies of montane mammals.

The recent increase in frequency of extreme ecological events such as droughts, insect outbreaks, and fires has focused 
interest on the potential “legacy effects” of these disturbances.  An unexplored pathway of impact is via changes  in the 
quantity and hemical quality of litter inputs following tree mortality.  We examined needle litter inputs of individuals of three 
coniferous species – Pinus Ponderosa, Pinus edulis, and Juniperus monosperma, which died or survived following the 
severe drought in northern Arizona during the hydrologic year of 2001/2002.  Initial measurements show that needle litter 
from dead piñon pines (Pinus edulis) at their lower ecotone has 35% higher nitrogen concentration [N] than that from 
living trees at the same site.  We will present data for litter [N] and phosphorus concentrations, and litter mass inputs, of 
drought-killed and living trees for the three conifer species.  We hypothesize that the initial pulse of N from trees killed by 
drought will be quickly immobilized into microbial biomass, and then into soil organic matter, but that N losses may 
increase in the absence of plant root uptake.  A combination of field measurements of N transformations, including 
denitrification losses, and simulations using the CENTURY biogeochemistry model, will be used to examine the dynamics 
of soil N following episodic N inputs associated with tree mortality.     
 
 
THE EFFECTS OF DROUGHT ON THE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF YELLOW-RUMPED WARBLERS NESTING IN 
ASPEN AND PONDEROSA PINE FOREST IN NORTHERN ARIZONA

Migratory birds are known to be more abundant in northern Arizona aspen stands than in the widespread ponderosa pine 
forest, particularly during the drought year of 1998.  In 2002 we began to follow the reproductive success of yellow -
rumped warblers (Dendroica coronata) to determine whether birds in aspen stands were producing more young than their 
pine nesting conspecifics.  By continuing the study in 2003 we are able to assess some of the effects of the drought on 
the reproductive success of this insectivorous species.  Our hypothesis was that aspen might serve as a refugia during 
drought years and might provide a buffer to population decline during severe drought conditions.  This did not appear to 
be the case.  Yellow -rumped warblers (YRWA) had an overall success rate of 16% (n=25).  YRWA in aspen were not 
more likely to fledge young than those in pine in 2002.  However, in 2003, overall success for YRWA was 41% (n=34), 
though birds nesting in aspen still were not more likely to fledge young than in pine.  Thus, during 2002 and 2003 it 
appears that weather conditions have a larger influence on reproductive success of YRWA than does habitat.

LATE PLEISTOCENE LIFE ON THE COLORADO PLATEAU: FAUNAL AND FLORAL EVIDENCE FROM THE 
NATIONAL PARKS, ARIZONA AND UTAH

The Colorado Plateau is renowned for its mountains, mesas, and c anyons. Extremes of topography (1500 m to 3400 m 
elevation) have dictated the mosaic structure of the modern and past biotic communities. The Colorado Plateau provides 
a wealth of data about the Pleistocene, even though lake, wetland, or marsh deposits are rare, and rock shelters and 
caves are randomly distributed across the region. Biotic remains typically lost to decay, such as feces, hair, and flesh, are 
preserved in these unique taphonomic settings. Dry localities also provide a detailed vegetation record preserved in fossil 
packrat middens and have produced a paleoclimate record spanning the past 50 ka yr.  Faunal and floral data allow 
insight into the biotic response to the end of the Wisconsinan Glaciation and the beginning of the Holocene. 14C analysis 
of dung samples of extinct species such as Shasta ground sloth (Nothrotheriops shastensis), mammoth (Mammuthus), 
Harrington’s mountain goat (Oreamnos harringtoni), shrubox (Euceratherium collinum) and bison (Bison) has yielded 
detail on the last occurrence of these taxa.  Extirpation of Oreamnos harringtoni , Mammuthus, Euceratherium collinum, 
and Nothrotheriops shastensis occurred between 11.8 and 11.0 ka 14C yr BP (13.9-12.8 ka cal yr BP) on the Colorado 
Plateau. Assembly of the modern plant communities and ascendance of dominant plant species on the Colorado Plateau 
are often a recent phenomenon. Pollen and packrat midden data demonstrate that today’s ponderosa pine (Pinus 
ponderosa) forests were occupied by mixed conifers (P. flexilis, Abies concolor, and Picea engelmannii) until as late at 12 
ka 14C yr BP (14 ka cal yr BP), and ponderosa pine did not arrive until after 10 ka 14C yr BP (11.5 ka cal yr BP).  
Likewise, Colorado pinyon (P. edulis) today a common co-dominant with Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) across 
mid-elevations, was apparently restricted to central New Mexico during the Pleistocene, and only migrated into its present 
distribution over the past 7-2 ka yr. However, new midden data suggests that Pleistocene pinyon distribution is still poorly 
understood, as newly analyzed middens from north of the Grand Canyon and in Canyonlands National Park contain 
pinyon fossils dating to 23 ka and 32 ka 14C yr BP, respectively.

.Accelerator Mass Spectrometer (AMS) radiocarbon dating of plant macrofossils from packrat (Neotoma spp.) middens 
verifies past localities of trees and shrubs of western North America such as creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) and pinyon 
pines (Pinus monophylla, P. edulis).  These records document the late Wisconsinan ranges of these species and their 
subsequent Holocene migrations into their current ranges.  Creosote bush grew in the lower Colorado River Valley during 
the late Wisconsinan (Isotope Stage 2). Starting around 13,000 calendar years ago, it migrated northward and upslope 
into its present range.  The migration rate from Creosote's most likely late Wisconsinan range can be modeled to have 
averaged about 10 m/Calendar year (10 km/1000 years).  By 7000 calendar years ago it had spread upslope to above its 
current elevational limits in the Mojave Desert.  Despite evidence of cooling late Holocene climates from isotope and tree-
ring proxies, it then continued to migrate northward. Three northerly populations in the northern Mojave, Grand Canyon, 
and Verde Valley did not arrive until around 4000, 2600, and 2000 years ago.  Its migration lagged well behind other 
desert thermophiles further suggesting that migrational distance played a key role in its rate of dispersal.  Single-needle 
pinyon (Pinus monophylla) migrated northward from the Mojave Desert into the Great Basin arriving near its current 
northeastern limit as early as 8000 years ago. It migrated more slowly in the western Great Basin where it reached its 
northwestern limit only within the last 1500 years.  Colorado pinyon (Pinus edulis) migrated from near its current southern 
boundary northward, reaching the eastern Grand Canyon about 12,600 years ago.  It is not recorded from central Utah 
until after 9000 years ago. It moved northward at an average rate of around 100 m/year, arriving at some northerly and 
easterly stands only within the last 500 years.  These results suggest that it may still be in the process of migrating and 
have implications for management efforts to slow pinyon "invasion".  These migrational histories reflect a combination of 
dispersal limitations and periodically favorable climates.  But the long migration times required, and super-elevational 
distributions during the warm middle Holocene, suggest that the primary factor slowing their response was migrational 
distance. These results have implications for vegetational effects of the expected climate warming of the next century.  
The observed differential migration rates over short upslope distances versus long latitudinal distances, and between 
early and late successional plant species, suggest that these data may be of great use in modeling the dynamics of 
differential vegetational response to future severe climatic warming.

GEOGRAPHIC AND CLIMATIC LIMITS OF PINYON PINE NEEDLE ANATOMICAL VARIANTS ON THE COLORADO

Needles of pinyon pines on the Colorado Plateau can be classified into three distinct anatomical types based upon needle 
fascicle number, needle width, and the number of stomatal rows and resin canals.  The two-needled variety, Pinus edulis 
(Colorado Pinyon) is usually accepted as a valid species that is easily distinguished from P. monophylla (Singleleaf 
Pinyon) by having a two needles in each fascicle rather than only one.  This easy dichotomy breaks down in regions 
between populations, where trees usually have a variable needle number.  A single-needle variant of uncertain taxonomic 
affiliation, Arizona Singleleaf  Pinyon, abundant along the Mogollon Rim and within the Grand Canyon, has been 
classified as P. edulis var. fallax Little; P. monophylla subsp. fallax (Little) Zavarin; and P. californiarum subsp. fallax 
(Little) Bailey.  These anatomical results show that individual needles of P. monophylla are distinct, but P. edulis and 
Arizona Singleleaf Pinyon are identical in the features measured except for needle number.  P. monophylla needles are 
1.15 to 1.80 mm in diameter when dried, contain 2-8 resin ducts, and 17-32 stomatal lines.  P. edulis and Arizona 
Singleleaf Pinyon needles are 0.80 to 1.25 mm in diameter when dried, contain 1-4 resin ducts, and 8-16 stomatal lines.  
Other studies have suggested that trees with a mixture of needle types produce comparatively more single needles during 
dry periods.  This raises the possibility (yet untested) that a P. edulis tree could be mistaken for one of the single needle 
types if grown in a dry environment, or vice-versa.  These pinyon types are distributed in regions characterized by three 
distinct modes of precipitation seasonality.  P. monophylla is found in areas with a peak in precipitation from December 
through March.  P. edulis and Arizona Singleleaf Pinyon are found in areas with a precipitation peak during July and 
August.  Arizona Singleleaf Pinyon is unique in growing in areas typified by a severe early summer dry period during May 
and June.  Spatial analysis of the relationships between precipitation seasonality and geographic ranges further support 
the statistical significance of these patterns, implying causality.  Maps of the distributions of these pines may be found at:

Multiple pathways of succession were evident following 4 large wildfires during the last decade on the Mesa Verde cuesta 
in southwestern Colorado.  Fires in 1989, 1996, and two fires in 2000 burned 7 vegetation types  and covered a mosaic of 
19th and 20th century fires.    Pre-fire vegetation structure had the greatest influence on successional patterns due to it’s 
affect on fire severity and residual vegetation.  Succession following stand-replacing fires in old-growth piñon-juniper 
woodlands began with an annual forb stage; in contrast, adjacent vegetation communities supported perennial shrubs that 
re-sprouted immediately post-fire. Carduus nutans (musk thistle) and Cirsium arvense (Canada thistle) and other 
invasives grew prolifically only  in burned piñon-juniper woodlands.  In the 1989 fire, these species persisted at least 13 
years.   By year 2 in the 1996 fire, Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) was present at 5% of the sample points; by year 3 it 
grew to 25 %.  By year 7, cheatgrass was found at 85 % of the sample points.  We tested if the tendency to support these 
invasive species was correlated with soil chemical or physical properties. The density of invasive species was positively 
correlated with soil P (r= 0.3, p<.05), negatively correlated with pH (r= -0.3, p<.01), positively correlated with conductivity 
(r= 0.4, p<.01), and is not correlated with soil texture properties or total nitrogen.  These preliminary data suggest that the 
nature of native residual species (hence competition from native plants) and changes in soil chemistry combine to 
influence the invasibility of selected plant communities after fires.

Bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare) is an exotic species that has invaded ecosystems worldwide. Invaded sites in Northern 
Arizona include areas that have been burned, slash piles and roadsides. Bull thistle is generally regarded as a transient 
species and, therefore, it should become absent from areas once a site has recovered from a disturbance.  However, bull 
thistle seems to persist on sites in northern Arizona for several years following a disturbance.  There is some evidence 
that buried bull thistle seeds can remain viable for several years, which might explain the persistence of bull thistle.  We 
initiated this study to investigate the effects of prescribe burning and litter removal on the persistence of bull thistle in 
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests. The number of plants and percent germination of buried seed at the end of the 
growing season in 2002 was evaluated on 5X5 meter plots following prescribed burning or litter removal (using hand 
tools) that occurred in the fall of 2001, and these results were compared to control (no disturbance treatment) plots.   

 
33 
The severe drought during the spring and summer of 2002 affected all adult plants equally across treatments with few 
plants surviving.  However, seedlings appeared in the in the fall of 2002 following the summer rains, with a greater 
number of seedlings in the removal plots compared to the burned and the control plots.  The percent germination of seeds 
that we buried prior to the burning or removal treatments was the lowest in the burned plots (20%), but there was no 
difference in percent germination of buried seed retrieved from the control and removal plots (50% germination). These 
results indicate that greater bare ground contributes to bull thistle persistence, but that heat from fire can negate the 
advantage of exposed mineral soil to persistence of bull thistle. One management implication of these results is that fuel 
reduction programs in ponderosa pine forests on the Colorado Plateau that include thinning, but not burning, may 
contribute to the spread of bull thistle.

Determining Euramerican-induced changes in forests is critical for understanding past and present forest ecosystems and 
therefore for developing well-founded forest management practices.  Unfortunately, detailed understanding of past forest 
conditions is limited by the paucity of extensive historical data.  Recently, in the archives of Grand Canyon National Park 
(GCNP) we discovered field datasheets from a 1935 vegetation study conducted by the National Park Service's Branch of 
Forestry (BOF).  This dataset appears to be the earliest extensive database on forest structure and composition for 
anywhere in the Southwest.  We compared these 1935 data to recent data from Ponderosa Pine Forest in GCNP.  Our 
objectives were to (1) examine changes in forest composition and structure since 1935 and (2) infer earlier changes 
dating from the beginning of Euramerican influence (circa 1880).  Our preliminary analysis of 72 BOF plots of 0.2 ac (0.08 
ha) and 104 recent plots of 0.25 ac (0.1 ha) suggests that, from 1935 to recent samples, total basal area (less minor 
species) decreased by 35% from 174 to 113 ft2/ac (40 to 26 m2/ha; p < 0.0001). There were also shifts in diameter class 
structure, including a statistically non-significant trend of an increase in the density of conifers (less minor species) in the 
4-11.9" dbh class from 48 to 64 trees/ac (119 to 158 trees/ha).  In contrast, the density of large diameter (=24" dbh) 
conifers (mostly ponderosa pine) decreased by nearly 45% from 14.4 to 8.0 trees/ac (36 to 20 trees/ha; p < 0.001).   
Our inferences suggest that, from 1880 to 1935, total basal area decreased slightly, density of small conifers increased 
greatly, and density of large diameter conifers decreased slightly.  In order to further clarify ecosystem trends, re-
measurement of the 1935 BOF plots is a high priority.  Nevertheless, findings from our preliminary analysis appear to 
have major implications for the management of Ponderosa Pine Forest in GCNP and other areas of the Southwest.  In 
particular, the dramatic decrease in large trees since 1935 suggests that large trees are at risk in these forests and, 
therefore, procedures to reduce their mortality should be incorporated into forest management plans.

The Mixed Conifer Forest of the Southwest is poorly understood, especially with regard to changes resulting from 
Euramerican influence.  Unfortunately, the absence of historic data sets makes it difficult to document such changes.   
Recently, in the archives of Grand Canyon National Park (GCNP) we discovered field datasheets from a 1935 vegetation 
study conducted by the National Park Service's Branch of Forestry (BOF).  This dataset appears to be the earliest 
extensive database on forest structure and composition for anywhere in the Southwest, albeit BOF data on the Mixed 
Conifer Forest are sparse.  We compared these 1935 data to recent data from Mixed Conifer Forest in GCNP.  Our 
objectives were to (1) examine changes in forest composition and structure since 1935 and (2) infer earlier changes 
dating from the beginning of Euramerican influence (circa 1880).  Our preliminary analysis of 12 BOF plots of 0.2 ac (0.08 
ha) and 48 recent plots of 0.25 ac (0.1 ha) suggests that, from 1935 to recent samples, total basal area decreased about 
50% from 356 to 177 ft2/ac (82 to 41 m2/ha; p < 0.0001).  The small sample size and high variability of 1935 BOF plots 
preclude documenting more specific changes, but statistically non-significant trends in the data suggest that the density of 
conifers in the 4-11.9" dbh class decreased (from 156 to 90 trees/ac; 385 to 222 trees/ha).  This trend was especially 
evident in white fir, followed by Douglas fir and spruce.  Our inferences suggest that, from 1880 to 1935, total basal area 
increased greatly, as did density of small conifers.  Greater understanding of Mixed Conifer Forest dynamics will require 
relocating and resampling the 1935 BOF plots.  Nevertheless, our preliminary analysis suggests important implications for 
the management of Mixed Conifer Forest in GCNP and other areas of the Southwest.  In particular, the dramatic changes 
indicated above, along with great landscape diversity, suggest that the Mixed Conifer Forest may require the most 
complicated restoration strategies of any coniferous forest ecosystem in the Southwest.

Transition ecosystems can be especially  sensitive to environmental changes; however, the lack of extensive historical 
data makes it difficult to document long-term changes in these ecosystems.  Recently, in the archives of Grand Canyon 
National Park (GCNP) we discovered field datasheets from a 1935 vegetation study conducted by the National Park 
Service's Bureau of Forestry (BOF).  This dataset appears to be one of the most robust early databases on Southwestern 
forests.  We compared these data to recent data from Ponderosa Pine – Mixed Conifer Transition Forest in GCNP.  Our 
objectives were to (1) examine changes in forest composition and structure since 1935 and (2) infer earlier changes 
dating from the beginning of Euramerican influence (circa 1880).  Our preliminary analysis of 95 BOF plots of 0.2 ac (0.08 
ha) and 38 recent plots of 0.25 ac (0.1 ha) suggests that, from 1935 to recent samples, total basal area (less minor 
species) decreased from 247 to 213 ft2/ac (57 to 49 m2/ha; p = 0.05) as quaking aspen decreased from 52 to 17 ft2/ac 
(12 to 4 m2/ha; p < 0.0001).  There also were shifts in diameter class structure and species composition.  The density of 
conifers (less minor species) in the 4-11.9" (10-30 cm) dbh class increas ed 105% from 60 to 123 trees/ac (148 to 304 
trees/ha; p < 0.0001), with white fir accounting for nearly three-fourths of the increase (30 to 76 trees/ac; 74 to 188 
trees/ha; p <0.01).  In contrast, very large diameter (=36"; 91 cm) conifers (mostly ponderosa pine) decreased nearly 85% 
from 3.0 to 0.5 trees/ac (7.4 to 1.2 trees/ha; p < 0.01).  Our inferences suggest that, from 1880 to 1935, total basal area 
changed little, density of small conifers increased greatly, and density of large diameter conifers changed little.  In order to 
further clarify ecosystem trends, re-measurement of the 1935 BOF plots is a high priority.  Nevertheless, findings from our 
preliminary analysis appear to have major implications for the management of Ponderosa Pine – Mixed Conifer Transition 
Forest in GCNP and other areas of the Southwest.  In particular, the trend toward mixed conifer characteristics suggests 
that the persistence of this transition forest in its historic location is at risk.

Southwest ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests have become dense with small young trees, herbaceous 
productivity has declined, and forest floor fuels have accumulated.  Crown fire danger has increased, prompting increased 
awareness and commitment to restore conditions to presettlement (pre-1870) tree density.  We studied landscape scale 
habitat selection of female mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) from 1997 through 2002 in a partially restored ponderosa 
pine forest in northwest Arizona.  We compared proportion of female mule deer locations to availability of 3 treatment 
stages and 5 vegetation types and found some consistent trends.  Treated mixed ponderosa-deciduous forest and 
meadows within treated areas were selected most often.  With vegetation types pooled, treated areas were selected 4 of 
6 years and transition areas were used more than available 3 of 5 years.  Conversely, current condition vegetation types 
were not used as expected 4 of 6 years.  Greater than 80% of female mule deer locations were in treated areas < 2.5 
years old.  Tradeoffs between enhanced forage availability and decreased bed and hiding cover may simultaneously 
influence female mule deer use of restoration treated forest.  Leaving additional patches of dense hiding cover may 
increase use of treated area by female mule deer.

Increasingly the natural world has been viewed as a complex, adaptive system in which the interaction of driving variables 
has far more importance than the isolated effects of independent factors. Here I present the hierarchical process by which 
the complexity of large dynamic landscapes is distilled down to a defensible experimental design, and the initial results of 
manipulative landscape level studies of the interaction of driving processes including climate, fire, and grazing. Studies 
contrast the ecological effects of native and exotic herbivores with the reintroduction of cattle following 10 years of rest 
producing significant increases in the richness and biomass of many taxa. Interactions between native and exotic 
herbivores including cattle and prairie dogs appear to lead to greater ecosystem richness than the presence of either 
species by itself indicating that simplistic views of grazing versus ecosystem health, of cattle versus prairie dogs, are 
largely irrelevant to conserving rangeland ecosystems. In addition to producing results that are more relevant to 
answering landscape level conservation questions and more rigorous tests of ecological theory, the need for large-scale 
manipulative studies also demands new ways of conducting science. The results of the studies presented here highlight 
the importance of collaboration between local communities and scientists as essential for conducting research at scales 
relevant for conservation and management.

Direct seeding is commonly used to establish herbaceous vegetation following wildlife or restoration activities. The supply 
of native seed is primarily through the private sector, where the increase in demand for native seed is outweighing the 
supply. The relatively sudden shift in policy regarding use of native seed in combination with the lack of supply is raising 
concerns about the quality of native seed being supplied by  native seed nurseries. This presentation summarizes results 
of a survey of 20 commercial native seed growers and distributors throughout the west, and these results are discussed in 
relation to a provenance study of 15 sources of five native grasses. Ten of the sources were collected throughout Arizona 
and five sources of these same species were purchased from private nurseries. In the survey, questions regarding 
policies and practices were asked along with questions regarding opinions about the entire process of growing, selling, or 
purchasing of native seed. The survey revealed a wide variety of practices that can result in variable quality of seed being 
sold. One problem revealed by the survey is a general lack of genetic control regarding collection of seed for 
redistribution. This lack of genetic cons ideration has important implications given the results of the provenance study that 
indicate genetic differences exist among native grass seed sources.  These differences varied among the different 
species, but indicate the use of native but non-local seed sources may have important ecological implications for the long-
term success of restoration and rehabilitation projects.

Past forest management has altered ecosystem structure and function in unanticipated ways. Fire suppression efforts 
have resulted in forest physiognomy and fuel loads that increase the likelihood of catastrophic disturbance events, 
including wildland fire. To reduce the threat and impact of altered fire regimes and catastrophic fire, land managers and 
scientists are more aggressively recommending the implementation of forest treatment projects on larger landscapes. 
However, these treatments often focus on reducing fire hazard with little consideration given to the effects of fire 
management on wildlife and other sensitive ecosystem attributes at multiple scales. Because large-scale treatments can 
facilitate complex shifts in community structure and organization, managers require a more tractable means of monitoring 
sensitive ecosystem components (i.e., using avian assemblages) at scales ranging from the forest stand up to very large 
landscapes. For ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in northern Arizona, we applied classification and regression 
tree analysis to model forest structure and avian species occurrence on a landscape over 800,000 ha in extent. 
Additionally, we coupled digital representations of forest structure with extensive avian and vegetation sampling efforts on 
three sites totaling 2100 ha. For these sites, we used an information-theoretic approach to model the density and 
probability of occurrence of avian species sensitive to forest change. To delineate the forest mosaic and avian response 
surfaces, we applied multivariate boundary analysis techniques. We then compared patterns of predicted occurrence for 
different avian species and groups at the different scales. Land managers have not previously considered the 
relationships between forest structure and avian assemblages in this multi-scale context. This research will assess the 
correspondence that exists among empirically-based models of community structure at scales relevant to forest 
management and conservation decisions in northern Arizona.

This project is to develop as a management tool, a data base for cataloging and querying information about plant species 
that are important for multiple values and uses.  The data base, Plant Information Network II (PIN II), is a prototype 
development to include current information on species taxonomic (nomenclature and naming), geographic (county 
distributions and elevation ranges), biologic (flowering dates, habit, life cycles, and reproduction), ecological (vegetation 
communities, edaphic information, functional relationships, and population dynamics), and economic (revegetation, 
erosion, and weedy values , and wildlife and livestock values) descriptors for plant species in Utah and Colorado.  
Specifically, the project is concentrating on species found in areas administered by the BLM Field Offices of the four units 

 
36 
of the National Landscape Conservation Sy stem, Colorado Canyons National Conservation Area, Gunnison Gorge 
National Conservation Area, Canyons of the Ancients National Monument, and Grand Staircase-Escalante National 
Monument.  The PIN II database includes approximately 3,100 species from Colorado (CO) and 2900 from Utah (UT).  
For each of these species, a broad range of taxonomic (nomenclature and naming), geographic (county distributions 
within the two states and elevation distributions), and biologic (flowering dates, habit, life cycles, and reproduction) 
information is recorded.   For a subset of species that are considered more important because of management, 
conservation, or uses other characteristic information is also included.  These include ecological (vegetation communities, 
edaphic information, functional relationships, and population dynamics), and economic (revegetation, erosion, and weedy 
values, and wildlife and livestock values) descriptors exists. Approximately 190 descriptors have been recorded for each 
species, including 9 county distributions and 100 values and characteristics.  Using boolean logic, key words and equals 
and and/ors, the PIN II data can be readily queried to recall and compare the stored descriptor information about the 
species, as well as combinations of species.  For the initial plant species the data base will include (1) species list 
available for the NLCS units including (2) sensitive plants (threatened and endangered species, rare plants, etc.), (3) 
invasive, weedy, and noxious species, and (4) species useful or desired for rehabilitation and restoration projects, (5) and 
other species known to occur in the management areas.

Ponderosa pine forest ecosystem restoration is a growing management emphasis in the Southwest to address >120 
years of change in forest structure, decreased forest health, and increased potential for disease and wildfire.  Restoration 
treatments replicating presettlement (ca. 1870) tree densities may reduce existing tree density 98%, and are detrimental 
to canopy -dependent wildlife such as the tassel-eared squirrel (Sciurus aberti ).  These treatments are of particular 
concern when applied at the landscape scale.  We examined squirrel population dynamics in north-central Arizona, from 
1999-2002, to gain insights into relationships to landscape-scale habitat composition.  We conducted our study at 9 280-
ha sites along a gradient of ratio of optimum to marginal patch area (ROMPA) composed of varying proportions of high 
quality, unlogged “optimum” and intensively thinned “marginal” habitats.  ROMPA at our sites ranged from 4.6 to 99.2%.  
Density on optimum sampling plots (n =12) averaged 0.42 squirrels/ha (±0.02 SE), and 0.16 squirrels/ha (±0.01) on 
marginal plots (n =13).  Mean recruitment varied among years, ranging from 0.05 to 1.92 juveniles/female, and was 
related to winter- spring (November-May) precipitation.  Recruitment averaged 0.12 juveniles/ha (±0.02) on optimum (n = 
10) and 0.03 juveniles/ha  (±0.01) on marginal plots (n = 8).  Mean study site annual survival rate averaged 0.49 (±0.05).  
We employed stepwise multiple regression to assess relationships between patch- (8 variables) and landscape-scale (26 
variables) habitat to squirrel populations.  For all 7 significant regression models, 1 patch-scale and 1 landscape-scale 
parameter each were added, pointing to a joint influence on squirrel populations.  Of the patch-scale variables, number of 
interlocking canopy trees was added to the models most often, while ROMPA was the landscape-scale variable added in 
5 of 7 models.  Recruitment and survival optimum plots were inversely related to the number of small, sapling-sized trees.  
Nonlinear thresholds in squirrel density occurred at 35-42% ROMPA, and at 24-35% ROMPA for recruitment.  Squirrel 
density and recruitment are optimized under restoration scenarios that commit approximately one third of the landscape 
each to high quality meso-reserves (in which small trees may be thinned), matrix prescriptions with aggregated retention 
of structural attributes important to squirrels (e.g., interlocking canopy trees), and reference condition-based restoration 
prescriptions.

Life history of G. cypha in the Colorado River Basin is mostly enigmatic, and interrelationships among subpopulations are 
virtually unknown. Lack of an historic baseline further complicates understanding of present-day patterns, and causal 
relationships between physical and biological parameters are merely the source of speculation. The most pressing 
questions pertain to genetic distinctiveness of local populations in the Colorado River Basin, the interrelationships among 
these populations, and how the sum can be adaptively managed in a perturbed environment. The objectives of this 
ongoing study are therefore to (a) infer interrelationships among populations of G. cypha within the basin, (b) to identify, if 
possible, genetically distinct units, and (c) to derive a management strategy for this endangered species. In this 
presentation, we deal with issue (a) through an assessment of genetic interrelationships among 9 populations based on 
amplification and sequencing of 1,820 base pairs from four rapidly evolving mitochondrial (mt) DNA markers (ATPase 8 & 
6, ND2, and D-loop). Analyses revealed low levels of genetic variation, both within and among populations. While this is 
surprising, given the number of specimens and amount of sequence data generated, it is congruent with findings in other 
big river fish from the Colorado River basin. Our basin-wide assessment of genetic diversity in Flannelmouth Sucker 
(Catostomous latipinnis) also revealed similar patterns of low genetic diversity. Potential causes for such low genetic 
diversity and implications for management and recovery are discussed.

The Arizona Black Rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis cerberus) was originally described as a variant of Caudisona lucifer by 
Coues in 1875. In 1949, Klauber subsumed it as a subspecies of the Crotalus viridis complex, where it remained 
taxonomically stable for 53 years. In 2002, Douglas et al. elevated C. viridis cerberus to specific status, based upon an 
extensive molecular phylogeny of the entire C. viridis complex. Crotalus cerberus  ranges from chaparral (circa 1000 
meters asl) to pine forest (circa 3000 meters asl), and is frequently found on isolated mountains (i.e., “sky islands”) in 
southern and eastern Arizona. It is the only species of rattlesnake endemic to Arizona (its range extends slightly into 
extreme western New Mexico), and it could justifiably be considered the state rattlesnake of Arizona. Given the variety of 
habitats occupied by this species, and its potential for isolation, an evaluation of its molecular biodiversity is warranted. 
This was accomplished by sequencing 840 base pairs of the mtDNA ATPase 8 and 6 genes sampled from 60 specimens 
collected range-wide. The tree was rooted with Agkistrodon and subsequently explored using Bayesian analy sis. Crotalus 
cerberus is divided into four clades: a western/ north-central Arizona clade encompasses the southern aspect of the 
Colorado Plateau. A central Arizona clade is localized in along the breakdown of the Mogollon Rim (i.e., the old Plateau 
margin). A third clade extends southward into the southern sky islands. A fourth clade, basal to these, includes only 
individuals from western New Mexico. This suggests that evolution of C. cerberus, and thus the entire C. viridis complex, 
was clearly along a s outhern trajectory from east-to-west, with the Gila River drainage serving as the probable westward 
conduit.

Gould’s turkey (Meleagris gallopavo mexicana) were extirpated from Arizona in the early 1900s.   In 1983 and 1987, 9 and 
12 Gould’s turkeys respectively, were released in the Huachuca Mountains in southeastern Arizona.  Since that time, the 
population has grown, and Arizona Game and Fish Department aspires to trans plant Gould’s turkeys into several other 
isolated (i.e., sky island) mountain ranges in southeastern Arizona to restore this species to native range.  Gould’s turkeys 
are thought to be the largest subspecies of turkeys in North America.  We captured Gould’s turkeys in the Huachuca 
Mountains during winters from 1998 through 2002.  Upon capture, birds were weighed, beard length and tarsometatarsus 
length were measured, and number of tail feathers was determined.  Measurements were also taken from Gould’s turkeys 
captured in Sonora, Mexico in 1994 and 1997, and from Merriam’s turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo merriami ) captured in 
northern Arizona from 1987 through 1997.  We compared characteristics among populations and also to those from 
published reports of other subspecies.  In general, adult Gould’s turkeys from the Huachuca Mountains, Arizona were 
heavier than those from Sonora, Mexico and than Merriam’s turkeys from northern Arizona.  When compared to other 
turkey subspecies, certain populations of Gould’s turkeys, including the population in the Huachuca Mountains, were 
heavier.  Tarsometatarsus length did not differ between Gould’s turkeys captured in the Huachuca Mountains and those 
captured in Sonora, Mexico, but measurements were longer than those reported for Merriam’s turkeys.  Adult male 
Gould’s turkeys in the Huachuca Mountains had longer beards than Gould’s turkeys captured in Sonora, Mexico and 
Merriam’s turkeys from northern Arizona.  Gould’s  turkeys in the Huachuca Mountains had an average of 17 tail feathers, 
fewer than previously observed for the subspecies.  Evidence suggests that certain populations of Gould’s turkeys are 
overall larger than other turkey subspecies.  It is possible that the larger Gould’s turkey subspecies is better adapted to 
native range.

Knowledge of the abundance, distribution, and breeding site characteristics of the Southwestern Willow Flycatcher 
(Empidonax traillii extimus ) are necessary for the conservation and management of this endangered riparian obligate 
specie.  Using data from survey efforts across the Southwest, we have compiled the known number of Southwestern 
Willow Flycatcher breeding sites and territories from 1993 to 2002. The number of known Southwestern Willow Flycatcher 
territories has increased from 111 to 986 over this period. Likewise, the number of known sites has increased from 30 to 
211.  Small breeding sites (those with 5 or fewer territories) account for 82% of all territories. There are only 2 known 
breeding sites with more than 50 territories.  Approximately half of the territories are in breeding sites composed of greater 

 
38 
than 90% native plants, and the other half are in sites with a greater than 10% exotic tree and /or shrub component.  
Approximately 90% of all territories are in breeding sites primarily composed of willow (Salix spp.), saltcedar (Tamarix 
spp.), or boxelder (Acer negundo).  However, only one breeding site (Cliff-Gila Valley, NM) is dominated by boxelder.  The 
states of Arizona, California, and New Mexico account for almost 90% of known territories, while Colorado, Nevada, and 
Utah account for the remainder.  There are no data available for the status of Southwestern Willow Flycatcher breeding 
sites or territories in Texas or northern Mexico.  
 
 
RETHINKING AVIAN RESPONSE TO TAMARISK: POSITIVE USE OF INTERMEDIATE LEVELS OF TAMARISK

Riparian ecosystems in the southwest provide critical habitat for avian communities.  Many of the river systems  in the 
west, including The Lower Colorado River, have been radically altered in the past century due to river regulation, 
agriculture, and the invasion of the exotic salt cedar/tamarisk (Tamarix sp.).  Our long-term research on neotropical 
migrant birds along the Colorado River has shown that in general 2x more birds are associated with native habitat than 
non-native habitat.  In this study, we examined at a finer scale the abundance and diversity of avian communities at a 
matrix of different percentages of native and non-native habitat at Bill Williams National Wildlife Refuge in southwestern 
Arizona.  Three major patterns emerged from this study.  1. Percent Tamarisk was the best vegetation predictor of avian 
abundance when compared to vertical foliage density and canopy cover.   2. Avian abundance in relation to percent 
tamarisk in the habitat varied between different groups of birds.  Overall species abundance was highest at intermediate 
levels of tamarisk (40-60%) suggesting a threshold.  Resident species showed a linear response to tamarisk with a slight 
increase in abundance at low levels of tamarisk.  Species that only breed in this system had the highest abundances at 
intermediate levels of tamarisk, while responding negatively to high and low tamarisk levels.  Neotropical migrant birds 
showed no difference in abundance at intermediate levels of tamarisk and habitat with no tamarisk (100% native).  3.  In a 
tamarisk-dominated habitat, the greatest increase in bird abundance in all categories of avian species occurred when 
small amounts of native vegetation were added as a component of the habitat.  Current land management goals include 
restoration of tamarisk-dominated habitat, and this is often undertaken through costly large-scale re-vegetation projects.  
The results of our study suggest that a cost-effective way to rehabilitate larger monoculture tamarisk stands and to 
positively benefit avian abundance and diversity, is by adding relatively low levels of native vegetation (~20-40%).  Further 
research is needed along other riparian systems in the west to determine if the response of  birds to tamarisk habitat is 
similar to that of the Lower Colorado River.  
 
 
THE EFFECTS OF Bromus tectorum INVASION ON SOIL CARBON STORAGE IN SEMI-ARID GRASSLANDS

Bromus tectorum is the most widespread invasive plant species in the United States, yet there is limited information about 
its effects on ecosystem productivity or carbon balance.  These could have significant consequences on regional carbon 
cycling. In southern Utah, Bromus tectorum, a C3 annual, has often replaced grasslands of Hilaria jamesii, a C4 perennial.   
Because of the short growing season of Bromus and its low carbon–to-nitrogen ratio (an indicator of litter quality), inputs 
of organic carbon into the soil of invaded grasslands are potentially both quantitatively and qualitatively different than soils 
in native grasslands.  This change in inputs could impact long-term soil carbon storage, with cascading effects on nutrient 
cycling, plant productivity, and soil trophic level interactions. To compare the soil organic carbon on disturbed and 
undisturbed soils, we collected soil cores to a depth of 70 cm in 1) uninvaded Hilaria grasslands, 2) completely-invaded 
Bromus grasslands, and 3) partially-invaded Hilaria-Bromus grasslands.  This allows a comparison of both organic carbon 
contents in the soil and the carbon isotope ratio of the soil carbon.  Preliminary results show that Bromus invaded soils are 
isotopically 13C lighter, reflecting contribution of organic carbon from the invasive grass.  Changes in the stable isotope 
ratio (d13C) of the soil organic matter will allow us to partition the relative carbon inputs of each grass species to total soil 
carbon.  Early results  have not shown significant differences in amount of carbon stored in invaded versus non-invaded 
sites.

Many riparian ecosystems on the Colorado Plateau are being threatened by the invasion of tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) and 
Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia).  Detailed mapping and monitoring of these species are invaluable for setting 
priorities for rapid response control and restoration efforts.  In this paper, we describe a new mapping methodology that 

 
39 
was field tested in Hackberry Canyon, Utah.  We found this method highly effective for early detection of small populations 
and detailed data collection, such as percent basal cover and average height, for specific species of interest.  However, 
when tamarisk stands became large (>0.5 ha), our methodology began losing precision and remote sensing techniques 
may work better for broad-scale surveys and land reclamation projects. Using high resolution aerial photography and GIS 
technology, we estimate that Hackberry Canyon has approximately 34.8 ha of riparian habitat that is susceptible to 
tamarisk and Russian olive invasion.  Of this area, tamarisk occupies 2.5 ha (6.9%) and Russian olive 0.1 ha (0.3%) along 
the Hackberry Creek corridor.  We conclude from this study that the tamarisk and Russian olive invasion is not only 
flourishing in Hackberry Canyon, but is far from reaching its potential distribution and cover.

Federal land managers increasingly rely on the Limits of Acceptable Change (LAC) concept instead of carrying capacity 
limitations to manage impacts to natural resources from visitors and other agents of resource degradation.  The LAC 
model allows land managers to establish explicit standards for resource condition, which must then be monitored to 
ensure that resource conditions stay within acceptable condition.  According to this approach, if monitoring reveals that 
LACs are being exceeded, specific management actions are triggered to bring resource conditions back in line with the 
established standards.  One issue that has never been satisfactorily addressed with regards to the LAC approach 
concerns the applicability of LACs to non-renewable resources such as archaeological sites.  How can land managers 
establish LAC’s for resources which do not regenerate after damage has occurred and for which any loss is generally 
considered to be unacceptable?  This paper summarizes a theoretical framework and monitoring approach developed for 
the Flagstaff Area National Monuments that is specifically applicable to archaeological resources but which may be useful 
for managing other non-renewable resources as well.  We also explore some of the philosophical dilemmas that 
accompany implementation of this approach and discuss the value of resource monitoring in general as a tool for effective 
resource management.

The USGS Southwest Biological Science Center, Colorado Plateau Field Station in Flagstaff, Arizona is developing the 
second generation gap analysis in Arizona.  As part of the Southwest Regional Gap Analysis Project, the Arizona team is 
cooperating with teams from Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah to produce consistent and seamless land cover, 
potential animal habitat, and land status maps.  The second generation project is mapping most land cover types using 
remotely sensed imagery, field data, and ancillary environmental data as input within a biophysical modeling approach.  
The land cover classification is based on Ecological Systems,  developed by NatureServe to express natural groupings of 
National Vegetation Classification associations across the landscape. The biophysical approach uses classification trees 
to model the Ecological Systems.  This method takes advantage of associations between vegetation types and ecological 
factors such as elevation, spectral reflectance, climate, and geology.  Extensive field observations on the occurrence of 
Ecological Systems have been collected and are spatially intersected with all of the ecological factors.  The factors which 
are the independent variables in the classification trees are compared to the dependent variable, the Ecological Systems 
determined in the field.  Rules of vegetation occurrence are derived from the classification trees   These rules are then 
implemented in a GIS to produce a land cover map.  Special classes such as agriculture, urban, and riparian areas 
require a different mapping approach.  Preliminary results in northeastern Arizona will be discussed.

Soil stability, hydrologic functioning, and biotic integrity are increasingly recognized as significant indicators of rangeland 
conditions.  Since 1999, staff of the BLM Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument (GSENM) have conducted a 
systematic survey of upland and wetland areas across the monument to determine current range conditions and identify 
vegetation types and locations that warrant special management attention.  Upland range surveys were conducted using 
18 indicators following the protocol of Interpreting Indicators of Rangeland Health versions 2.0 and 3.0.  Wetland areas 
were assessed for proper functioning condition using standard BLM methods.  We found that only 4-5% of upland sites on 
GSENM had “non-functioning” (moderate to extreme departure from expected conditions) soil, hydrologic, or biotic 
conditions.  Of these same sites, 21-27% were “functioning at risk” (moderate departure from expected) and 67-75% were 
adequately functioning (no to slight departure from expected).  Sagebrush grasslands had the highest percentage of non-

 
40 
functioning (10-13%) or functioning at risk (34-47%) sites for soil, hydrologic, and biotic integrity.  Blackbrush and desert 
shrub communities had 0-3% sites non-functioning and 17-30% functioning at risk.  Pinyon-juniper woodlands had less 
than 1% of sites non-functioning and 11-13% functioning at risk.  Seedings had comparable rates of non-functioning and 
functioning at risk sites as sagebrush grasslands.  Of the 18 indicators assessed at each site, soil surface resistance to 
erosion, composition of vegetative functional/structural groups, and biological soil crusts consistently had lower ratings 
than other indicators.  For lotic wetland systems, we found that 6% of stream reaches were non-functioning and 57% were 
functioning at risk.  Likewise, 18% of lentic wetland sites were non-functioning and 48% were functioning at risk.  Our 
results suggest that most of the upland areas of GSENM are in good functioning condition, but nearly 25% of our range 
sites are at risk of degradation or shif ts in vegetative state.  These latter sites should be considered high priority for 
additional monitoring or management attention.  Wetland areas are at higher risk of degradation than upland sites and 
have been especially impacted by invasion of exotic shrubs, loss of vegetative cover, and dewatering. 
 
 
GENETIC EFFECTS ON NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY IN POPULUS FORESTS AT A GEOGRAPHIC SCALE

Linkages between genetics and nutrient cycling have been found in ecosystems as divergent as a tropical Meterosideros 
forests of Hawaiian, a temperate oak forest of the southeastern U.S., and U.S. inter-mountain riparian forests dominated 
by cottonwoods (Populus).  However, it is unknown if the effects of plant genetic diversity scale up to multiple systems 
since, to date, research has only been conducted in a single contiguous ecosystems. We compared how nitrogen (N) 
availability trends documented in one hybrid system (Weber River, Utah) scale up to two other systems dominated by 
hybrids of the same parental cottonwood species (Indian Creek, UT and Blue River, AZ) spanning a geographic distance 
of  more than1000 km.  We used mixed-bed ion exchange resin (IER) bags incubated in situ over two, six-month periods 
to assess soil N availability under canopies of trees representing a hybrid gradient in genetic composition from one parent 
taxa (P. fremontii) to another (P. angustifolia) in each of these river systems.  Our results support earlier patterns found 
along the Weber River using a different in situ method for assessing N availability and suggest that the apparent effects of 
cottonwood hybridization on N cycling processes are consistent across diverse geographical areas. Nitrogen availability 
was highest under P. fremontii , and was progressively lower under F1 hybrids, backcross hybrids and P. angustifolia. 
This trend is consistent with increasing leaf tannin concentrations, a genetically controlled trait with known effects on 
nitrogen cycling. Our research has three major implications: 1) Ecosystem function can be predictably affected by even 
the finest scales of biodiversity (genetics) across a broad range of environmental conditions. 2) Since gene flow through a 
hybridization complex is sufficient to alter nutrient cycling, we must acknowledge that taxonomic similarity for dominant 
plant species does not imply similarity in function on an ecosystem scale. 3) Restoration attempts and land management 
activities in cottonwood gallery forests should incorporate high genetic diversity, or run the risk of simplifying ecosystems 
through homogenizing pathways for nutrient cycling, and removing potential evolutionary pathways and feedbacks 
between plant litter quality and fitness.

The fossil and sub-fossil plant macrofossils and pollen grains found in packrat middens can serve as an important proxy 
for climate and vegetation change in the arid southwestern US.  A new application for packrat midden research is the use 
of middens to help in understanding how humans have had a part in impacting the landscape.  This work examines a 
series of 22 middens from Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, spanning from 14,850 years old to present.  At least 16 
of the middens are dated as younger than 1,000 years, giving this project extra detail during the periods just prior to, and 
following the introduction of domesticated grazing animals. By comparing the vegetation in middens from before domestic 
sheep and cattle graz ing was introduced, and after, it can be seen how this anthropogenic practice has had an effect on 
the native plant communities of the area.  This study incorporates not only middens in time series before and after 
grazing, but is the first study to also compare temporal changes in grazed areas and un-grazed relict mesas.   Presence 
of certain key plant species, such as natives like winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata), buffaloberry (Shepherdia 
rotundifolia), and needle and thread grass (Hespertostipa comata ssp. comata) in middens from un-grazed times and 
areas, and exotics like Russian thistle (Salsola ssp.) and cheat grass (Bromus techtorum) from grazed times and areas, 
indicates that grazing has had an effect on the composition  of the native plant communities.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal abundance and species composition significantly affect herbaceous plant communities by 
changing competitive outcomes between individual species.  The goal of this study was to determine how arbuscular 
mycorrhizal fungi affect competitive interactions between plants and whether these competitive effects change within a 
1000 m elevation gradient.  We grew four grasses native to the forests of the Northern Arizona’s San Francisco Peaks 
(Blepharoneuron tricholepis, Elymus elymoides , Festuca arizonica, and Muhlenbergia montana) for 17 weeks in soil from 
high elevation (3559-2880 m), low elevation (2860-2440 m), or a non-mycorrhizal control.  Each grass was grown by itself 
and in competition with each of the other grasses.  We compared root dry weight, shoot dry weight, total dry weight, 
root/shoot ratios, and shoot N and P content across mycorrhizal treatments and competitive combinations.  M. montana 
was the only species that had a higher average biomass in the low elevation treatment than the high elevation treatment.  
Average total weight of M. montana was 0.4491 g in the low elevation treatment, but only 0.3375 g in the high elevation 
treatment.  Average root, shoot, and total weights in all three other species were between 16% and 46% higher in the high 
elevation treatment than the low elevation treatment.  Average total weight of E. elymoides, F. arizonica, and M. montana 
decreased by between 2% and 24% when grown in competition with another species.  However, average total weight of 
B. tricholepis increased from 0.3671 g when grown by itself to 0.4200 g when grown in competition.  There are broader 
ecological implications to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi altering the competitive balance between species.  By changing the 
size or nutrient content of shoots, arbuscular mycorrhizae could modify the value of that plant for wildlife.   Arbuscular 
mycorrhizal fungal communities can influence how quickly plant communities adapt to new environmental conditions, an 
important consideration in light of the effects of global climate change on plant species distributions.

Wildfires in the last decade have affected thousands of acres of Pinus edulis- Juniperus osteosperma (piñon-juniper) 
woodlands on the Colorado Plateau, and are a pressing management challenge throughout the region. We reconstructed 
fire history on Mesa Verde using piñon age structures from 11 sites and piñon-juniper size structures at 37 sites.  The 
maximum piñon age was used to establish minimum time-since-fire and the s patial extent of past fires was mapped from 
stand ages using Emerge color infra-red imagery (1 m resolution).  An important shift in climate and fire occurrence 
occurred in the 1990s.  Previously, average annual precipitation was 45 cm and piñon-juniper woodlands were structurally 
heterogenous. Exponential or gaussian size distributions characterized old-growth stands with dense piñon understory; 
normal size distributions characterized low density stands. Very old trees (400+ years) were common, and the fire rotation 
period was estimated at 400 years.  Historic fire maps and records documented that 7,442 ha of the total 53,870 ha 
cuesta (13.8%)  burned between 1934 and 1995.  The period since 1995, however, has been marked by severe and 
prolonged drought which combined with heavy fuels and frequent lightning has resulted in 5 large wildfires.  In these 
recent fires, a total 15,838 ha (29.4 % of the cuesta) burned, of which 3,579 ha was old-growth piñon-juniper woodland. 
Fire and resource managers face difficult choices between fuel reduction strategies that would reduce wildfire hazard but 
also would significantly alter the integrity of the woodland, and preservation of the few old-growth piñon-juniper woodlands 
that still remain on the Colorado Plateau.

The adoption of the National Vegetation Classification System by the Ecological Society of America and many federal 
land management agencies has provided both a much needed standard hierarchical framework and a renewed interest in 
classifying vegetation at a fine-scale, association level.  This system emphasizes current vegetation rather than potential 
vegetation and thus should be of more immediate use to land managers.  We initiated a study of ponderosa pine (Pinus 
ponderosa) understory plant communities at a site 16 kilometers north of Parks, AZ during the 2002 drought year.  
Canopy cover data with species level resolution was gathered from 164 50-m transects using Daubenmire (1959) 
techniques.  Cluster analysis of this data set yielded seven putative associations.  Three of these associations were 
dominated by mountain muhly (Muhlenbergia montanum), one by Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica), two by blue grama 
(Bouteloua gracilis), and one by squirreltail (Elymus elymoides ).  In the future, these putative associations will be 
compared to a similar analysis from a good monsoon year (2003) as well as from a similar site 50 miles south of Flagstaff, 
AZ.

One of the paradigms of exotics species management is that roads provide a pathway for exotic plant species invasion 
into less frequently disturbed areas.  Yet few studies have been conducted which compare roadside and forest interior 
exotic plant communities.  In 2002 such a study was conducted by a census of 58 0.8 ha plots for the presence/absence 
of exotic plant species at a study site 16 kilometers north of Parks, AZ in a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) understory 
plant community.  Roadside plots were significantly richer in exotic species than interior plots, p = 0.0029.  Roadside plots 
had a mean of 3.5 species/plot versus a mean of 1.9 for interior plots.  A total of 10 exotic species were found in  both 
interior and roadside plots.  Nine of the 10 species were the same with prostrate knotweed (Polygonum aviculare) found 
only in roadside plots and Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis) only in interior plots.  These results could be interpreted as 
supporting the initial hypothesis.  Alternatively since the total exotic species richness pool is similar, the increased 
richness of roads ide plots may simply reflect a higher frequency of soil disturbance and/or increased frequency of exotic 
species propagule dispersal.

Mycorrhizal fungi play a key role in plant community and ecosystem processes and it is important to understand how 
climate changes affect these symbionts.   We examined the effects of recent droughts in northern Arizona on the 
ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with pinyon pine by comparing trees surviving in low and high mortality sites.  Surviving 
trees from high mortality sites had 50% lower ectomycorrhizal colonization, reduced diversity of fungal associates, and a 
significantly different fungal community than trees from low mortality sites.  We observed a strong correlation between 
trunk growth and ectomycorrhizal colonization (r2 = 0.73) and validated the resulting regression model with independent 
data.  This relationship suggests that tree rings can be used to reconstruct past and predict future ectomycorrhizal 
colonization.  Bioassay studies demonstrate that reduc tion in fungal symbionts as a consequence of tree mortality leads to 
50% higher seedling mortality rates, and reduced mycorrhizal colonization and growth of surviving seedlings.  Overall, our 
findings suggest that drought is accompanied by both qualitative and quantitative changes in ectomycorrhizal fungal 
dynamics that could have important impacts on the health of surviving trees and the ability of the seedlings of dominant 
trees to re-establish in high mortality sites.

This study aims to identify geographic factors leading to high levels of drought-related mortality and canopy dieback in 
cottonwood (Populus sp.) stands throughout the Colorado Plateau region and southern Rocky Mountains.  Surveys of tree 
stands were taken during the summer and fall of 2003 to study differential mortality and dieback levels at 3 spatial scales: 
across the elevational and latitudinal gradient of the southern Rocky Mountains, within 3 parallel Arizona watersheds, and 
at the individual stand level.  In the Rocky Mountain Pacific drainage, trees growing in hybrid zones were found to be 
much healthier than both high- and low- elevation pure species.  Competition with an invasive species, tamarisk (Tamarix 
sp.) is exacerbating the effect of drought on Fremont cottonwood (P. fremontii).  Differing levels of dieback may indicate a 
future shift in the distribution & genetic structure of these forests, which could have cascading effects upon riparian 
ecosystems.

Specific land uses, such as off-road vehicle (OHV) use or livestock grazing and trampling of riparian zones can affect 
amphibian populations by altering habitat quality as well as through direct interactions (e.g., crushing of individuals by 
vehicles or livestock).  Activities that affect reproductive success can yield a population size structure that differs from an 
area without that activity.  Trampling of eggs by cattle or OHVs may result in fewer metamorphs available for recruitment 
into the adult population.  We are surveying populations in different parts of Salt Creek Cañon, Canyonlands National 

 
43 
Park and areas in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument where recent changes in management could affect 
reproductive success of toads.  We predicted that more metamorphs would enter populations with fewer disturbances of 
eggs and tadpoles; size structure would show more small toads.  Results of surveys and pitfall traps from 2000-2002 will 
be presented. 
 
 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AMPHIBIAN RESEARCH AND MONITORING INITIATIVE ON THE COLORADO

The Department of Interior’s Amphibian Research and Monitoring Initiative (ARMI) initiated a Colorado Plateau Mid-Level 
Survey Area (MLSA) beginning in 2001 centered on Canyonlands National Park and incorporating adjacent Glen Canyon 
NRA and BLM lands to make a coherent Canyonlands MLSA (CANY).  NPS Inventory & Monitoring support has allowed 
us to include Arches and Capitol Reef National Parks, and Natural Bridges National Monument.  Surveys will be 
conducted on a rotating cycle, reporting the proportion of available habitat patches that are occupied (PAO) for each 
amphibian species.  Emphasis of protocol-development has included selection of areas that 1) will allow us to draw 
inferences about amphibian condition throughout the MLSA (i.e., sites are selected in a probabilistic fashion); 2) can be 
visited at least twice in a survey period to meet PAO assumptions; and 3) have some chance of actually containing 
amphibian habitat.  Methods have included surveying entire Hydrologic Units (HU) within CANY, or 1km2 plots within the 
HUs, or surveying 500m segments of drainages.  All areas surveyed were selected at random.  A major difficulty in 
developing an amphibian monitoring program in this arid environment is the lack of definitive criteria to identify amphibian 
habitat; we are trying to fill this gap.  The requirement of  multiple visits (at least two) to each potential habitat patch is 
difficult to accomplish in rugged topography.  The uncertainty of finding potential habitat in a given randomly selected area 
also increases the cost per useable habitat patch, and since many of the features that define amphibian habitat are too 
small to be detected by remote sensors, it is very difficult to reduce this uncertainty by using GIS.  The most effective 
solution to these problems is to inventory the entire MLSA, then randomly select from known habitat patches for 
monitoring.  This costs more initially, but may be cost-effective compared to the alternatives in full implementation of the 
monitoring program.  There may be some potential in evaluating low-elevation, high-resolution aerial photography for 
habitat features, and training a GIS to recognize aggregates of features that are likely to be amphibian habitat. 
 
 
DIFFERENCES IN ANT COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AT TWO SITES IN GRAND STAIRCASE-ESCALANTE NATIONAL

Ants can be important ecosystem drivers, and community dynamics of ants can play a role in ecosystem response to 
disturbances and environmental stress.  At The Gulch and Steep Creek, in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National 
Monument, ant community composition was determined in each year from 1999 through 2003; samples were collected 
only in fall 1999, in spring and fall in other years.  Specimens were classified to morphospecies, and later identified to 
genus and assigned to functional groups.  Morphospecies with numerical dominance differed at the two sites, and at the 
same site over time.  There were significant positive and negative relationships between some species pairs at the sites, 
but intensity, and even direction of interactions differed between sites.  Relative importance of inherent site differences, 
drought, and recent changes in management of the two sites in ant community dynamics will be discussed.

Invertebrates represent all trophic levels above primary producers, performing many of ecosystem functions, and thus 
provide a large pool from which to draw potential indicator taxa to monitor ecosystem condition.  However, before they 
can be used as indicators, we must know which taxa are present, how they function in particular ecosystems, and how 
they respond to natural and anthropogenic disturbances.  In July 1998, part of the road in Salt Creek cañon was closed, 
providing an opportunity to document riparian ecosystem response to elimination of vehicle perturbations.  Since the 
closure, southeastern Utah has received significantly less precipitation than normal, overlaying the natural stress of 
drought on potential recovery from anthropogenic disturbance.  Over 30,000 invertebrates have been collected to date; 
about 6000 samples have been sorted to order, with ants and beetles identified to genus or family/subfamily, respectively.  
Differences in the invertebrate communities are evident at the order level between cañon segments (open road, closed 
road and no road), and between months and years.  Open road and closed road communities are more similar, and show 
similar fluctuation patterns, while the no road site communities had different proportions of each order, and fluctuations in 
abundance differed from open road and closed road patterns.

Rocky Mountain Research Station (RMRS) is a part of the USDA Forest Service.  RMRS is charged with the scientific 
study of forest ecosystem structure, functions, their response to disturbance and proper management and use. RWU-
4302 is a particular unit within RMRS organized to study the effects of wild fires on forested riparian ecosystems, fishery, 
hydrology, geomorphology, and vegetation.  These are all characteristics that are overlooked when an individual first sees 
a raging wildfire fire on the television screen; then the individual is worried about their effects on people and homes.  
Because of such public misconception, the Forest Service and especially its research arm have problems of 
communicating research results and their significance to the public.  The barrier exists because of the complexity of the 
scientific aspect of the research outcomes.  This poster will explain the studies performed by RWU-4302 using simple 
terms, pictures, past results, and future studies to place an emphasis on the importance of communicating results to the 
public. A fire poses enormous threats to the environment, resources, and the public.  The public is uniformed about most 
of these threats.  This poster w ill explain in a communicative manner the effects of a wild fire on the environment, 
resources, and the public.

As part of the Forest Ecosystem Restoration Analysis (ForestERA) project, we have developed a spatial decision support 
system (SDSS) for ranking and comparing alternative forest treatment plans according to a set of user preferences. The 
aim of this effort is to provide managers with the data and tools necessary to make use of the increasing volume of quality 
ecological information, so that forest restoration problems can be addressed at spatial scales broader than project level.  
We have developed a flexible framework for addressing multiple questions regarding the implementation of treatments, 
including forest restoration prescriptions, at the landscape scale.  Our SDSS is linked to a collection of integrated models 
that predict the cumulative effects of various treatment configurations on wildlife distributions, fire hazard, and other 
parameters relevant to fire and forest ecology.  It is constructed so that stakeholders can define objectives and apply 
criteria for designing and prioritizing forest treatments and explore the tradeoffs between alternative management 
strategies.  We outline this multi-criteria decision-making process with a demonstration of our spatial tools across several 
million acres of ponderosa pine dominated fores ts in northern Arizona.  (More information on the ForestERA project can

The United States Geological Survey-Colorado Plateau Field Station has collaborated with National Park Service, Bureau 
of Reclamation, and NatureServe, to describe vegetation associations for Wupatki National Monument and to develop a 
map of these associations or groups of associations.  This project, along with concurrent vegetation mapping and 
description projects in Sunset Crater and Walnut Canyon NM, are the first in northern Arizona to incorporate vegetation 
classification within the National Vegetation Classification System (NVCS).  The Federal Geographic Data Committee 
(FGDC) has accepted the NVCS as a national standard and its implementation on the national and regional level is being 
enacted mainly through NatureServe and the Ecological Society of America. The intention of the NVCS is to provide a 
framework for vegetation description such that the composition and structure of vegetation is consistently described 
across the land regardless of administrative or management type.   We describe in the presentation the procedures 
followed to identify and describe vegetation as well as to develop map units within the NVCS framework at Wupatki NM. 
Half of the 27 vegetation associations described at Wupatki NM are new to the NVCS.  These vegetation association 
distributions and characteristics are incorporated into the NatureServe Explorer database which documents known 
information on vegetation associations and alliances and is available on-line. Our data provide a baseline for these newly 
described vegetation types and will help to determine the extent of these communities regionally and locally.

Invasive s altcedar (Tamarix spp.) species threaten the ecological integrity of many riparian areas throughout the 
southwestern United States, and land managers have attempted to remove tamarisk from affected systems for decades.  
Two widespread methods for killing saltcedar are cutting or burning followed by herbicide application, yet the impacts of 
these methods on native vegetation and on site recovery are poorly understood.  We conducted a retrospective analysis 
of sites in California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah and New Mexico to determine the current vegetation community in saltcedar-
infested areas that were treated between 1-15 years ago using 1) cut-stump with herbicide, 2) burning followed by 
herbicide application, and 3) a no treatment control.  The results of this  study are compared to management goals for the 
Tamarix control projects to determine whether management objectives are being met.  In the past weed control efforts 
have focused on killing the target organism, but the void created by removing a species has  sometimes been filled by the 
same organism or by yet another exotic plant.  To avoid these undesirable consequences, there is a growing awareness 
that exotic plant management should occur within the context of promoting healthy ecosystems.  This study provides 
some crucial first steps in developing management programs for tamarisk by 1) evaluating the long-term effects of two 
tamarisk control methods and 2) allowing land managers to better choose a method for removing saltcedar that also 
promotes a return to the desired riparian ecosystem condition.

Agencies and individuals responsible for resource management decisions of many types have varying perspectives about 
hydroclimatic variability and opportunities for using forecasts to improve decision outcomes. Improper interpretation of 
forecasts is widespread and many individuals find it difficult to place forecasts in an appropriate regional historical context. 
In addition, the lack of readily accessible quantitative assessments of past forecast performance limits confidence in 
available forecast products. Further, researchers find it difficult to engage decision makers in detailed discussions about 
using forecasts to improve risk management when the discussions refer only to abstract notions of natural variability, 
prediction uncertainty, and forecast quality.  In response, we have developed an interactive forecast assessment tool 
accessible over the Internet that can be customized by individual users. The tool provides tutorials for guiding forecast 
interpretation, including quizzes that allow users to test their forecast interpretation skills. Users can efficiently monitor the 
time evolution of forecasts and subsequent observations. They can also monitor recent and historical observations for 
selected regions, communicated using terminology consistent with available forecast products. The tool also allows users 
to evaluate forecast performance for the regions, seasons, forecast lead times, and performance criteria relevant to their 
specific decision making situations. Using consistent product format, the evaluation component allows individuals to use 
results at the level they are capable of understanding, while offering opportunity to shift to more sophisticated criteria.   
Input from potential users, from a variety of resource management sectors, was instrumental in determining the webtool 
design.  Initial ideas and feedback on the webtool were solicited through workshops, interviews, online surveys, and 
interaction with a cadre of voluntary webtool beta-testers.  In its present form, the webtool can be considered a research 
‘product’. However, it is also the basis for an ongoing research ‘process’, whereby new forthcoming forecast products may 
be more readily understood and used by decision makers, and researchers can engage decision makers in concrete 
discussions about risk management processes and the value of forecasts.  Our experience in creating the online forecast 
assessment tool highlights several issues associated with development of nontraditional research products. Design and 
implementation of commercial quality websites is fundamentally different than producing traditional research products. 
Websites that incorporate interactive analyses and frequent data updates require highly specialized technical personnel 
and timeframes that can be difficult to accommodate in many federally funded projects. The long-term sustainability of 
webtools developed in a university research setting is an open question. Webtool components may not be easily 
transferable to agencies, and website maintenance requires ongoing commitment. Regardless, from the perspective of 
decision makers, such products may be more useful than traditional products.

Expectations for hydroclimatic research are evolving as changes in the contract between science and society require 
researchers to provide “usable science” that can improve resource management policies and practices. For many 
decision makers, benefits from hydroclimatic research have been slow to materialize, in part due to difficulties in 
accessing and interpreting scientific research products, uncertainty about how to effectively incorporate new information 
into decision processes, and the slow transition of research products from experimental to operational status.  The 
diversity of decision makers presents a challenge for providing advanced data and information.  Some have technical 

 
46 
capabilities and operational flexibility capable of readily exploiting new information and products, while others have fewer 
resources and are less likely to change their decision processes without clear demonstration of benefits.  We also 
encountered perceptions that taxpayer-funded hydroclimatic research would be used to their detriment rather than their 
benefit. For example, ranchers in the U.S. Southwest expressed fears that research results and products would be used 
exclusively by agencies to exert more control over their operations.  These issues have been addressed within a highly 
integrated stakeholder-driven research process, the Climate Assessment for the Southwest (CLIMAS), one of five 
Regional Integrated Science and Assessment (RISA) projects funded by NOAA’s Office of Global Programs. We highlight 
our iterative process of working with stakeholders and adapting our research activities to mitigate traditional inequities in 
the scope, communication, and accessibility of hydroclimatic research results.  One significant product is our interactive 
forecast assessment tool, accessible over the Internet (http://hydis6.hwr.arizona.edu/ForecastEvaluationTool/). The tool 
provides tutorials for guiding forecast interpretation; allows users to monitor the time evolution of forecasts and recent and 
historical observations; and allows users to evaluate forecast performance for the regions, seasons, forecast lead times, 
and performance criteria relevant to their specific decision making situations. Using consistent product formats, the 
evaluation component allows individuals to use results at the level they are capable of understanding, while offering 
opportunity to shift to more sophisticated criteria.  Our experience highlights several issues associated with development 
of nontraditional research products that are fundamentally different than traditional research products or even many 
decision support tools. In particular, the long-term sustainability of knowledge development tools is an open question 
because their components may not be easily transferable to agencies, and website maintenance requires ongoing 
commitment. Regardless, from the perspective of decision makers, such products may be more useful than traditional 
products.

Fundamental changes are occurring in the Colorado Plateau economy  compared to 3 decades ago.  Analysis of the 
region’s 31 counties in 4 states reveal growth in total employment from 1970-2000 of 225%: nearly 3 times the US rate 
and faster than growth in the Census Mountain Division and combined Four Corners States.  Disaggregation of 
employment changes reveals struc tural shifts.  Use of Location Quotient and Mix-Share analysis provide windows into the 
trends developing on the Plateau in how people utilize the landscape.  Groupings of employment totals and changes into 
resource-based jobs, manufacturing, and services highlight important modifications occurring in the region’s economic 
structure.  The Colorado Plateau’s socio-economic characteristics were first documented in Charting the Colorado Plateau 
(Grand Canyon Trust, 1996).  New data now available for 1970-2000 trace the economic characteristics that both define 
the Plateau and identify the dramatic changes facing the region.  Additional analysis of the 31 counties incorporating the 
natural boundaries of the Colorado Plateau focus here on employment as a measurement of structure and change.  
Resource managers, politicians and citizens of the Colorado Plateau will gain from this study a deeper understanding of 
the economic characteristics and changes occurring in this region.  The analysis contributes to a growing literature that 
recognizes the Colorado Plateau as a region of importance: what the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s Center for 
the Study of Rural America calls a region acting as a  “forerunner” for regional thinking and initiatives.

This study analyzes the socioeconomic impacts of amenity-driven markets in the remote, intermountain western U.S.  
Northern Arizona and its Grand Canyon region are used to develop a theoretical model which describes the 
socioeconomic influences that result from Intermountain West regions possessing many natural amenities and a low level 
of development.  These aesthetic and remote qualities are attracting newcomers and tourists to the region, increasing the 
local cost of living, and increasing the overall quantity (employment and output) of regional economies.  At the same time, 
these regions are experiencing decreases in real wages, decreases in the percentage of retained tourism expenditures, 
and an overall decrease in the quality of the economy.  Socioeconomic data were compiled for five, high-amenity regions 
in the Intermountain West that had a previous dependency on timber production and products, but currently have service-
dominated industries.  Tw o of the regions analyzed, Flagstaff, AZ and Durango, CO, are part of the Colorado Plateau.  
The data indicate that these regions are experiencing increases in population, industrial output, and cost of living that are 
accelerating much faster than national averages.  The data also indicate that average wages per job are lower than 
national averages and poverty percentages are higher than national averages which contribute to a declining quality of 
economy.  Regional economic development theory and examples of Intermountain West communities further advanced in 
tourism development are also analyzed with the purpose of implying future economic trends for northern Arizona and 
other rural, Intermountain West tourist communities.

Public-private partnerships have been considered an effective organizational form in ecosystem management for their 
potential to adapt institutional functions to varying spatial and temporal scales, changing public knowledge and attitudes, 
and adaptive management learning characteristics of restoration efforts.  Despite their promise, the full potential of public-
private partnerships remains conceptually ill-defined and elusive in practice.  To better realize the value of partnerships to 
forest ecological restoration, research was conducted to identify and evaluate approaches to effective public-private 
partnerships.  The final results and implications of this research are presented.  A comprehensive review of the public-
private partnership and related literature yielded concepts, theories, and partnership examples.  Partnership examples 
representing the diversity of partnership arrangements were the subjects of case study analyses to assess the structure, 
function, and process of public-private partnerships to restore Ponderosa pine ecosystems the Southwest.  The 
information from the literature review and case studies was used to develop a multiple attribute decision analysis 
procedure for designing partnership arrangements in forest restoration.  The procedure had a sample of partnership 
participants respond to an interactive instrument built from variables identified qualitatively.  These variables (e.g., 
organizational leadership, commitment of organizational resources) were presented in multi-value problems addressed by 
respondents, then decomposed into discrete decision attributes by the researcher, subsequently enabling respondents to 
better evaluate the importance of each attribute to resource management decisions.  The results were importance 
rankings of partnership attributes based on perceived probability of occurrence.  Salient attributes (e.g., transactional 
leadership, collaborative learning) were the basis of the public-private partnership guidelines presented.  The implications 
of guidelines for Ponderosa pine forest restoration are discussed.

Recent fire effects and fuel load research at Wupatki and Walnut Canyon National Monuments have focused on 
assessing levels of threats and direct impacts from wild fire on archeological sites. At Wupatki, a post-fire monitoring 
project documented 44 previously recorded fieldhouses, multi-room pueblos and artifact scatters that were burned over 
during a lighting caused fire in 2002. At Walnut Canyon, systematic fuel load assessments on more than 300 
archeological sites in the past two years have ranked sites according to their risk potential for fire impacts. The wide range 
of fire effects and threats documented at Wupatki and Walnut Canyon points to the overwhelming need for active fuels 
management, distinguishing fire from other passively managed natural site formation processes. It is not coincidental that 
our fire effects monitoring has come at a time of high profile state and federal programs to address broad-scale forest fire 
issues; the Walnut Canyon project was directly funded by a federal initiative to evaluate and treat fire threats near urban 
areas. With the flame front approaching from federal and state agencies to quickly treat overgrown Arizona forests on a 
massive scale, the Flagstaff Area National Monuments is equipped to operate more in protection mode than prevention 
mode. Historically, managing fire on archeological sites has been limited to protecting sites immediately before and during 
prescribed fire activity. The large-scale nature of recent fire suppression efforts in Arizona is also driving the need to 
prioritize management of fires on archeological sites as many sites are in danger of impacts from suppression activities. 
We suggest that fire impacts and threats need to be treated as an archeological site preservation issue well ahead of fuel 
load treatments, prescribed fires and catastrophic wildfire,  especially for those sites that are the primary resources 
(architectural sites) for which Wupatki and Walnut Canyon National Monuments were created. Park managers can 
accomplish this task through projects that are implemented as part of a Ruins Preservation Plan, an Archeological Site 
Monitoring Plan and a Cultural Resource Management Plan.

Fire effects in mechanically restored, pinyon-juniper woodlands were evaluated during a three-year study to assess 
prescribed burning as a tool to maintain savanna structure.  Periodic fire disturbance of these mechanically thinned 
woodlands is a necessary component of longer term maintenance of both open stand structure and associated grassy 
ground cover.  An optimal initial fire entry would cull tree seedling reproduction, reduce woody sub-shrub dominance, 
improve nutrient availability, and enhance herbaceous cover and productivity. Evaluating the effects of fire in these 
restored woodlands can also provide insights into the role of fire disturbance in defining the distribution and composition of 
woodland communities.  Our results suggest that prescribed fire can be used to cull non-rhizomatous woody seedlings, 
and thus maintain open stand structure, however avoidance of excessive burn intensity and associated negative impacts 
on the recovering herbaceous understory is critical to long term success.

Zooarchaeological assemblages from central Utah provide insights into wildlife populations during the Holocene. Rich 
faunal assemblages from deep sites such as Cowboy Cave and Aspen Shelter as well as more modest data from open 
sites in Capitol Reef National Park and neighboring Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument offer intriguing, 
culturally filtered glimpses into patterns of wildlife exploitation in the past as well as abundance and distribution of prey 
species.  Temporal patterning in artiodactyl abundance in archaeofaunal assemblages demand explanation and may 
suggest human hunters played an important role in reducing artiodactyl populations in the Holocene. Paleofaunal data 
obtained through archaeological excavation and subsequent analysis complement paleontological and Neotoma midden 
research and provide an additional tool for conservation biologists as they seek to understand long term trends in animal 
populations and associations.

When the National Park Service was created in 1916, the foundation of its mission was defined by legislation as the 
following: to conserve natural and cultural resources. Lands targeted for creation as National Parks and Monuments 
include  unique landforms and their associated flora and fauna, or irreplaceable cultural resources, such as prehistoric 
and historic sites. In setting aside these lands for protection and preservation, the language used in the enabling 
legislations of certain NPS units often overlooked the past and present uses of these same resources by Native American 
peoples. In addition to being stewards of cultural and natural resources, the National Park Service is also responsible for 
understanding and supporting the cultural traditions of modern Native peoples. This includes focusing on the fact that for 
Native people “cultural resources” includes plants and animals, not just prehistoric and historic structures. This 
presentation will examine how the Flagstaff Area National Monuments have begun to incorporate Native perspectives into 
management strategies in an effort to address Native requests to access and use resources within these monuments. 
Examples include current projects being undertaken to support traditional lifeways of indigenous peoples, such as plant 
collecting and access to sites for religious purposes. In addition, we will discuss possible avenues for creating more 
inclusive, and culturally appropriate Park Service land management in the future.

The Southwest Biological Science Center’s Colorado Plateau Field Station (USGS/BRD), in cooperation with the National 
Park Service, conducted a 3-year project to inventory breeding birds in 12 selected parks, in 5 states, on and near the 
Colorado Plateau.  The goals of this inventory were to: 1) document the presence/absence of bird species, and their 
distribution and abundance, in areas and habitats that were historically under-sampled or not sampled, 2) identify 
important habitats, 3) identify bird species of special concern, which could become part of future “vital signs” monitoring. 
The park units targeted were those that lacked baseline information on breeding and non-breeding birds’ 
presence/absence, distribution and abundance in various habitats.  Inventory methods were determined by the size of the 
park; small parks were surveyed using area searches; larger parks required sampling: VCP point counts were conducted 
at randomly selected sampling points stratified by habitat, non-random point counts were established to survey specific 
habitats that covered enough area to accommodate independent point counts.  These avian inventories documented an 
average of 89% of the species occurring in the parks.  They also allowed for the identification of bird species and habitats 
of management concern and most in need of conservation.  These habitats and their associated bird species are 
appropriate “vital signs” for biological monitoring in the Parks. Results of this inventory highlight the need for designing 
future avian monitoring programs that are conducted at multiple spatial and temporal scales.  
 
 
A NEW PROTOCOL FOR RAPID ASSESSMENT OF COLORADO PLATEAU STREAM-RIPARIAN ECOSYSTEMS

Stream-riparian ecosystems are among the most productive, biologically diverse and threatened habitats in arid regions, 
including the Colorado Plateau.  Standardized protocols for assessing health of these ecosystems are needed for 
monitoring and restoration, but most existing methods focus on few components of the ecosystem or rely upon subjective 
judgment of ecosystem health.  More problematic, there are no assessment protocols that focus specifically on the lower-
elevation tributaries of the Colorado Plateau.  We present a new integrated, multi-resource method for rapid assessment 
of the functional condition of riparian and associated aquatic habitats (Rapid Stream-Riparian Assessment, or RSRA), 

 
49 
involving > quantitative evaluation of 4-8 variables in each of 6 ecological categories: water quality, fluvial geomorphology, 
aquatic and fish habitat, vegetation composition and structure (including the relative dominance of exotic species), 
terrestrial wildlife habitat, and human impacts; however, the latter factor is not included in the overall evaluation of riparian 
health.  We recommend identification and assessment of reference, or control, sites, and scaling local assessment scores 
against reference conditions.  To improve the assessment we recommend three regional synoptic analyses: 1) human 
land use history (including administrative history and management objectives); 2) hydrogeology and water quality; and 3) 
biological analysis of stream-riparian ecosystem diversity, composition, and sensitive species distribution.  Our protocol is 
designed for streams and small-to-medium-sized rivers in the semi-arid southwest, but with slight modification is likely 
applicable to many temperate regions.  Our RSRA is more rigorous, repeatable, and less subjective than other protocols 
used, and is efficient, cost effective and highly informative.

Spatial information (remotely sensing data and GIS), field data, and spatial statistical modeling are currently used to 
assess landscape-scale-ecosystems at Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument (GSENM), Utah; Rocky Mountain 
National Park (ROMO), Colorado; Theodore Roosevelt National Park (THRO), North Dakota; and Cerro Grande Fire Site, 
Los Alamos, New Mexico. Each of the four sites represents a complex landscape of plant diversity and covers an area of 
about 1.92 million ha for GSENM, 107,200 ha for ROMO, 28,510 ha for THRO, and 19,000 ha for Cerro Grande.  Key 
biological parameters can be estimated using multi-scale sampling with multi-phase design to provide unbiased estimates 
of vegetation and soil characteristics. We ev aluated the vulnerability of various habitats to invasion by exotic plants over 
the entire GSENM, ROMO, THRO, and Cerro Grande sites.  This poster will provide updated examples on cryptobiotic 
crust cover, invasive plants, and environmental variables related to the landscapes of the GSENM, ROMO, THRO, and 
Cerro Grande sites. A multi-phase sampling design (i.e., double sampling) and nested multi-scale plots design were used 
to collect field data for the four sites.  For modeling large-scale and small-scale variability to predict the distribution, 
presence, and pattern of cryptobiotic crust cover, invasive plants, and soil characteristics, we integrated remotely sensed 
data, GIS, field data, and spatial statistics.  These models are based on trend surface analysis and stepwise regression.  
In this poster, will show results of trend surface models that describe the large-scale spatial variability?  Models with small 
variance were selected.  In addition, the residuals from the trend surface model were then modeled using regression 
classification trees (RTC).  The final surfaces were obtained by combining the trend surface model with the RTC s.  Our  
research program is using these new tools for forecasting the landscape-scale at different levels. In addition, these new 
models and spatial maps can be used for better resource management for such large areas like the GSENM.

CENSUS OF WELSH'S MILKWEED (Asclepias welshii), A FEDERALLY THREATENED SPECIES, AT CORAL PINK

Welsh's milkweed (Asclepias welshii Holmgren & Holmgren) is a rhizomatous perennial forb endemic to shifting sand 
dunes in southern Utah and northern Arizona, where it is currently known from nine extant populations.  Due to concerns 
about population size, limited global distribution, and impacts from off-highway vehicles (OHVs), Welsh's milkweed was 
listed as Threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 1987.  The largest known population is found at Coral Pink 
Sand Dunes (CPSD) on lands managed for recreation and scenic values by the state of Utah and Bureau of Land 
Management.   The population of Welsh's milkweed at CPSD was estimated at 12,500 stems in 1992.  In 2002, we 
conducted a follow -up census at CPSD to assess population trends, map subpopulations, determine demographic 
patterns, and provide a baseline and direction for future studies.  Each subpopulation was mapped with a GPS unit and 
data were collected on several population parameters, such as degree of herbivory, vegetative cover, presence of 
livestock or OHV activity, and total number of stems according to age class and reproductive categories.  We counted 
71,012 stems in 635 s ubpopulations covering approximately 3300 acres, representing a significant increase in number of 
stems at CPSD compared to previous studies.  This increase may be an artifact of improved sampling or may reflect 
compensatory growth of vegetative plants following trampling.  Over 85% of the stems and 94% of the subpopulations 
were found in areas with less than 50% vegetative cover, supporting previous hypotheses that Welsh's milkweed is 
negatively impacted by dense vegetation.  We found that 47% of the plants in exclosures closed to OHVs produced 
flowers or fruits, while only 24% of plants in areas open to OHV activity were reproductive.  Our findings suggest that OHV 
activity may be increasing the total number of stems and causing a shift in reproductive effort from sexual to vegetative, 
which may have long-term negative impacts on genetic diversity in the population.

The past decade has been drier than average in the southwestern United States and has included two years (1996 and 
2002) of extreme drought conditions.  To complement ground-based efforts to document impacts to the region’s 
ecosystems, we analyzed a 12 year record of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) obtained by the AVHRR 
instrument onboard NOAA satellites.  The NDVI time series revealed temporal variation in grasslands, savanna, and 
forests, with patterns in grasslands being most closely coupled to precipitation variation and most strongly correlated with 
ground-based measurements. The large spatial scale (1 km2) of the NDVI did not allow resolution of small areas of tree 
mortality, but did detect more widespread effects of drought and bark beetle impacts to forests.  We used a simple model 
for light use efficiency to provide a coarse estimate of drought-related reduction in primary productivity of different 
ecosystems on the southern Colorado Plateau.

California Condors lived in the Grand Canyon ecoregion for thousands of years before the 1900s.  The last remaining 
condor in Arizona was observed south of the Grand Canyon in 1924, after which condors existed only in the state of 
California.  A landmark event occurred in 1996: a group of California Condors were released just north of the Grand 
Canyon in an effort to reestablish a population of condors in Arizona.  Fortuitously, many have chosen to frequent the 
canyon during the spring and summer, and condor sightings are common during these times of year.  2003 marks the 
most exciting thus far for the condor program in Arizona.  Condors have an excellent chance of successfully raising a 
chick in the wild this year—something that has not happened in North America since 1984 and has not happened for over 
100 years in Arizona.  Condors do not begin breeding until 6-7 years of age, and rarely are successful in raising a chick 
until their second or third breeding attempt.  Until recently, all the condors in Arizona were too young to breed, however in 
2002, two condor pairs nested near the South Rim of the Grand Canyon for the first time.  Although those nesting 
attempts failed, the 2003 season is the most promising season yet.  Entering the 2003 breeding season, biologists 
observed three nesting pairs in the Grand Canyon and one nesting pair in the newly established Vermilion Cliffs National 
Monument.  Three of the four nests subsequently failed by mid-May. At this writing, park biologists are 100% certain the 
Salt Creek nest in Grand Canyon National Park has a chick. Although not visible because of nest site location, the 
parent’s behavior has and continues to exemplify a pair raising a chick.  Fledging will indeed be a rare event.  Three 
condor chicks in California last year were within two weeks of fledging when all three suddenly died.  Causes of mortality 
included lead and copper poisoning, trash ingestion and emaciation.  Threats to Arizona condors continue to be lead 
poisoning, human-condor interactions, the upcoming hunting season on park boundaries and the risk of contracting West 
Nile Virus.

Habitat fragmentation has been targeted as one of the most serious threats to biological diversity worldwide and in areas 
with increasing urbanization, fragmentation is virtually inevitable.  In northern Arizona, development in the past twenty 
years has increased and significant development is proposed adjacent to Grand Canyon National Park (GCNP).  This 
development has the potential to impact much of the native vegetation and wildlife habitats.  This habitat loss, in 
conjunction with high levels of local endemism of native species, may lead to "hot-spots" of endangerment and extinction 
in the region. Grand Canyon National Park is conducting a radio telemetry study of mountain lions in and around the 
developed zones of the North and South Rims of Grand Canyon National Park in conjunction with continued non-invasive 
DNA sampling.  Lions will be radio-collared and tracked using GPS telemetry technology and movement data will be 
linked to GIS-based models of landscape fragmentation, roads, and habitat types in and around the park that is 
frequented by large numbers of the visiting public.  These analyses will allow us to identify habitat linkages and wildlife 
movement corridors critical to the survival of mountain lions and other large mammals moving between the park and 
adjacent USFS, Tribal and BLM lands. The project will complement studies already underway for non-invasive DNA 
sampling of lions within the park boundaries (test efficacy of non-invasive sampling methods). Overall, this work will add to 
ecoregional efforts and assessment of mountain lions and large mammal viability in zones heavily impacted by human 
presence and result in important outreach data for wildlife conservation efforts in the region.

The tragedy of the commons frequently plays out in the form of livestock grazing on the public lands of the western U.S.  
Long-term livestock grazing on desert grasslands is often cited in examples of over-utilized resources, but few alternatives 
have been adequately tested.  To contrast the effects of alternative grazing regimes on plant communities, primary 
productivity, and soil properties we implemented a replicated study of four treatments: 1) low -intensity, long-duration 
grazing rotations; 2) high-intensity, short-duration rotations (Holistic Resource Management-style grazing); 3) very high 
impact, short duration grazing (to simulate herd-impact); and 4) livestock exclosure.  We found plant diversity to be 
relatively insensitive to these treatments, while primary productivity and soil properties were more greatly affected.  
Primary productivity showed a 30% increase with short-duration grazing, however this response was lessened by 
repeated grazing.  Very high impact grazing had an 80% increase on soil compaction and increased available nitrogen by 
30%.  Alternative livestock grazing practices create trade-offs in ecological responses that can only be assessed in light of 
management goals.  We conclude by setting this ecological study in the larger context of a holistic assessment of 
ecosystem health that incorporates socio-economic realities.

Mesa Verde National Park and adjacent areas of southwestern Colorado have experienced a significant level of Pinus 
edulis (piñon) mortality in recent years due to several causes including effects of regional drought. Before 1995, the 
average annual precipitation at Mesa Verde National Park was 40.3 cm.  Since 1995, annual precipitation has averaged 
34 cm, with precipitation in some years far below the average.  The drought and subsequent outbreaks of Ips 
paraconfusus  (piñon bark beetle) and other insects have caused a conspicuous die-off of piñon, with the potential to 
significantly alter the age structure of piñon–juniper woodlands of Mesa Verde.  This paper reports on preliminary efforts 
to utilize moderate resolution (30 meter) Landsat imagery, in conjunction with high resolution (1 meter) Emerge CIR 
imagery, to evaluate the spatial extent of the mortality.  Image differencing techniques were applied to a time series of 
NDVI images between 1997 and 2003.  Changes in vegetative crown cover were identified over this time span.  High 
resolution Emerge imagery was used to identify training areas of piñon mortality in 2002 through visual interpretation.  
These training areas and causes of mortality were verified through limited ground observations.  A supervised 
classification approach and GIS modeling techniques were used to further examine mortality and identify the extent of the 
Ips infestation.  Field data in 2003 are compared with data from 1984 in a long term study area east of MVNP.  Recent 
mortality is significantly greater than in 1984 and is shifted from the 10-25 cm diameter class (where 50 % of the mortality 
occurred in 1984) to larger size classes.  In this pilot study, we test the efficacy of these techniques for mapping and 
monitoring piñon mortality and the Ips outbreak.

There are indications that forest insect populations have been influenced by recent climate trends.  A multitude of species 
is incurring outbreaks in high elevation and high latitude forests.  In many cases these outbreaks have been more 
extensive and severe than previously observed, further north or at higher elevations than previously seen for that species, 
or of species that were previously unknown or innocuous.  There have been nearly synchronous outbreaks of spruce 
beetle throughout the Southwest and the Pacific Northwest.  An aphid species known to incur outbreaks only in maritime 
climates has incurred 5 outbreaks in Southwestern high elevation forests.  Low tree vigor caused by excessive forest 
density and several years of drought is the likely primary cause of contemporary bark beetle outbreaks in pine forests, but 
is not sufficient to explain either the plethora of insect outbreaks in the higher elevation sites or the extent and severity of 
the beetle outbreaks.  Analysis of non-urban high-elevation data from NCDC indicates that mean annual temperature 
above 2100 m has increased about 1°C since 1940.  This seemingly small increase in temperature has dramatically 
altered the seasonality of temperature limits associated with insect populations.  Winter is warmer and shorter.  Spring is 
warmer and less frosty.  The frost-free period has increased more than 50 days, and while 15-20 days with frost could be 
expected in May in the 1940’s, only 2-8 days have occurred each May since 1990.  At McNary, Arizona, extreme winter 
cold temperatures used to reach –22 to -31°C, but have not fallen below -17°C since 1990.  Winter and spring 
precipitation has also decreased.  The longer frost-free period and warmer spring temperatures are sufficient to produce 
additional generations of damaging insects, especially in Ips species, tip moths and early-season aphids.  Extreme winter 
low temperatures are inadequate to limit many high elevation bark beetle populations.  Outbreaks of autumn- and winter-
feeding Geometrids and aphids are probably related to prolonged autumns and failure to reach limiting winter 

 
52 
temperatures.  Warm late winter and spring temperatures before the dry winds of May that are typical of the Colorado 
Plateau have undoubtedly contributed to drought-related bark beetle outbreaks.  Insect population dynamics that have 
changed with warmer temperature regimes are not likely to be reestablished once the drought ends.  Insect population 
dynamics are sensitive to small changes in climate, and, with wildfire, may cause rapid changes to forest vegetation 
character and population dynamics.

We have estimated the age of petroglyphs by measuring repatination of the glyph using a portable XRF instrument to 
determine the amount of Mn and Fe in excess of that in the base rock that had accumulated on the pecked surface. Many 
previous investigators have noted the buildup of heavy metals, particularly Mn and Fe in desert varnish (DV), the dark 
coating that forms on rock surfaces in arid climates. We have accumulated DV data from a number of locations where the 
land surface, hence the DV, has been dated by radiometric techniques. These data provided a calibration curve of Age vs. 
Accumulation of Mn + Fe against which petroglyph measurements of unknown age could be compared. The technique is 
totally non-destructive and quick (two minutes per measurement). The PXRF is carried to the field and the measurement 
unit held gently against the glyph. The technique is simple in concept and execution: (1) Measure the Mn + Fe on the 
petroglyph (for best accuracy obtain averages of multiple measurements at different places on the glyph), (2) Subtract the 
Mn + Fe concentration in the base rock by measuring rock of the same type that has no DV, (3) Read the Age from the 
calibration curve. The corrections for the texture of the surface and self -absorption by the DV layer are intrinsic within 
each measurement.  A survey of glyphs at locations near Pahranagat Valley, NV, and at the Ivins, UT, Land Hill site 
produced ages from 1,000 to 4,000 years. The absolute accuracy of the technique may be about " 50% and will improve 
as additional cosmogenic age determinations of rock falls are added to our database. The relative accuracy between 
measurements at a site is considerably better.  The ability of archaeologists to date petroglyphs is limited to stylistic 
considerations, overlap of pecking and the rare occurrence of glyphs at sites that can be dated by other means. Earlier 
methods based upon cation ratio and 14C dating of carbon particulates underneath the DV have been discounted. 
Without chronologic ages, petroglyphs cannot be assigned to specific past cultures or understood in a temporal context. 
This method promises to revolutionize our knowledge of earlier residents of the land and when they created the 
petroglyphs.  This research was supported in part by the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Lower

EFFECTS OF PONDEROSA PINE FOREST RESTORATION ON MERRIAM'S TURKEY USE OF HISTORICAL ROOST 
SITES IN NORTHERN ARIZONA

Ecological restoration of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in the southwestern United States is a relatively new, 
adaptive management practice that potentially alters wildlife habitat during and immediately after restoration treatments.  
To determine whether restoration treatments affected Merriam¡¦s turkey (Meleagris gallopavo merriami ) roost selection, 
we relocated 89 of 120 turkey roost sites that had been mapped originally in 1985 in the ponderosa pine forest of the 
Unikaret Mountains of northern Arizona.  We then compared current turkey use and roost characteristics at historical roost 
sites in stands that had been recently treated with tree thinning and prescribed burning, to sites either located in 1) 
untreated stands >800m from a treated area or 2) untreated areas adjacent (<800m) to treated areas.  In 2002, 23 of the 
89 sites were still in use and in 2003, 13 were still in use.  There was no significant difference in the number of roost sites 
still in use among treated, adjacent, and untreated control areas.   We also searched each area for new roosts, and found 
no difference among treatments in the number of new roosts located/search time. Turkeys used roosts on north-northeast 
facing sites with a mean slope of 18%.  Roost trees averaged 70.1 cm diameter at 1.37 m and 22 m in height.  All roost 
trees were live ponderosa pine, with over-mature and co-dominant crowns.  Mean height to the lowest branch was 3.6 m.  
These roost charac teristics were not different from roosts used in 1985 before treatment.  Finally, we tested whether the 
DBH or basal area of trees at historical roost sites no longer in use were significantly different from that of new or currently 
used historical roosts.  We found no significant difference, suggesting that changes in these parameters were not 
responsible for the change in roost use over time.   These results indicate that the thinning and burning associated with 
the ecological restoration treatments undertaken on these plots did not negatively impact turkey use or roost site 
characteristics.  One important caveat of this study is that forest treatments in this area have been conducted on areas 
with relatively little slope, while most turkey roosts were located on slopes.  How forest treatments on slopes may affect 
turkey roost use remains an important question.

AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES ON THE COLORADO PLATEAU: EFFECTS UPON MYCORRHIZAL INOCULUM 
POTENTIAL AND SPORE POPULATION

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) form symbiotic associations within the roots of most crop plants. These associations 
often improve water relations and enhance nutrient uptake to the host plant. The goal of this study was to compare the 
effects of traditional Native American farming practices with conventional high-input farming practices and their effects 
upon mycorrhizal inoculum potential (MIP) and AMF spore populations of the Colorado Plateau. Soils were collected from 
sites managed with high-input conventional practices, low -input Native American practices, and non-managed wild lands. 
It was predicted that the MIP would be reduced under high and low-input agricultural practices as compared to non-
managed wild lands. Results show that MIP of high-input cornfields was in fact lower (P= .02) than adjacent non-managed 
wild lands.  Furthermore, the MIP of Native American cornfields was also significantly lower (P= .006) than adjacent non-
managed wild lands. It was also hypothesized that crop history and duration of crop management would have a significant 
effect upon the MIP of conventional agriculture fields.  Results show that increased duration of management increases a 
crops susceptibility to changes in MIP for corn (P= .02) and alfalfa (P=. 01) rotations among high input conventionally 
managed fields. However, when spore populations are analyzed the overall pattern is reversed. Spore abundance 
increases under high input farming practices when compared to non-managed wild lands (P=0.001). Further analysis 
shows that this increase is found in corn fields alone and not alfalfa fields (P=0.007) and that the increase is due to the 
presence of small diameter spores and not large diameter spores (P=0.005). These data show that 1) High and low -input 
agriculture management practices reduce the MIP of soils from their native vegetation state, and 2) Spore abundance can 
increase under high input agriculture practices 3) Spore abundance does not increase under low input agricultural 
practices but stays the same as surrounding natural vegetation that is not under cultivation. Effects upon crop productivity 
are not yet fully understood.  However, some studies have shown that proliferation of small diameter spores can reduce 
crop production.

Recorded encounters between humans and pumas have been increasing throughout the western contiguous U.S., as 
have puma-caused human injuries and deaths.  We developed a conceptual model of interactions between humans and 
pumas to aid the design of a study in the Flagstaff uplands of Arizona, USA, and to appraise the scope and strength of 
existing related research.  The model represents contact and resulting human injuries as the outcome of 2 processes: (1) 
the frequency of encounter between humans and pumas, and (2), given an encounter, the probability that it will turn 
injurious to a human.  Conceptually, different suites of factors govern these 2 phenomena.  The model representing 
frequency of encounter includes 15 putative explanatory variables, 7 of which relate directly to pumas.  The model 
representing probability of injury also includes 15 explanatory variables, 7 of which pertain directly to pumas.  The 
remaining variables in both models relate directly or indirectly to human presence or behavior.  Of the 44 identified 
relations among these variables, 6 have been w ell-studied and an additional 18 have been subject to some level of 
systematic analysis.  The remaining 20 relations, including many plausibly critical ones, are currently informed only by 
speculation, anecdote, or deduction.  Much research yet needs to be done before the level and nature of contact between 
humans and pumas can be adequately explained and predicted.  Moreover, much of this additional research needs to 
address human behavior and factors related to distributions and numbers of humans.  Of the uninvestigated factors with 
plausibly major effects, habituation of cougars promises to be the most difficult to study.  Otherwise, numbers and 
distributions of human facilities (including roads and trails), puma population sizes, human behavior, and human 
knowledge of pumas are potentially important explanatory factors amenable to inquiry.  We argue that all of these putative 
effects should be considered before reaching conclusions about the “causes” of human-puma encounters and puma-
caused human injuries, whether for a region or a given study area.

Neotropical migrant birds make habitat selection choices during migration, but little is known about the influence  of tree 
phenology on stopover foraging behavior. Shifting tree phenology (e.g., flowering and leaf -flush) during spring migration 
presents migrant birds with an assortment of foraging opportunities. We experimentally tested whether the flow ering 
condition of honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) might act as a proximate cue to migrating birds during spring stopover, 
by examining the relationship between tree phenology, arthropod community composition, and bird foraging behavior at 
Cibola National Wildlife Refuge (NWR).  Natural paired trees of high and low flowering condition were observed to 

 
54 
examine differences in migrating bird prey attack rate, length of stay, and visit rate. To control for likely autocorrelation 
between leafing and flowering condition, we experimentally removed flowers and paired them to neighboring controls to 
further examine differences in prey attack rate, length of stay, and visit rate. Arthropod data were sampled from known 
Neotropical migrant foraging microhabitats and concomitantly compared to the birds’ foraging behaviors.  Five patterns 
emerged: 1) Neotropical migrant bird stopping over during spring migration at Cibola NWR coincided with peak honey 
mesquite leafing and flowering.  In addition, when compared to other trees in the environment, honey mesquite trees were 
chosen as preferred foraging sites.  2) All neotropical migrant birds that we examined showed a preference to forage in 
honey mesquite trees with significantly greater amounts of leaf cover and flowers. 3) Paired field experiments 
demonstrated that birds more often visited, and foraged longer in trees with greater numbers of flowers.  4) Neotropical 
migrant birds attacked more prey on trees of higher than average flowering, both in paired experiments and during 
random observations.  And, 5) Arthropod community composition differed by flowering condition with insect abundance 
and richness being greater on honey mesquite trees with greater numbers of flowers.  Our results indicate that flowering 
honey mesquite trees serve as proximate cues that allow neotropical migrating birds to better exploit arthropod prey.  
Flowering mesquite trees are thus attractive microhabitats that could maximize refueling requirements, and resource 
managers should take this into account when planning proposed re-vegetation projects along the Colorado River corridor.

This talk will present data and conclusions from 30 years of research on the functional organization of the grazing food 
web in the Serengeti Ecosystem, Tanzania.  The grazing fauna is dominated by wildebeest, which make up about 60% of 
the biomass and number over 1.3 million individuals.  This species is migratory (or nomadic, following spatially 
unpredictable rainfall) along with plain's zebra and eland. Ungulate diversity is, however, due to 20 other species which 
occur as resident herds throughout the ecosystem.  Data will be presented on how the ungulates interact with the 
herbaceous layer and the soil ecosystem.  None of these trophic-nutritional systems can be understand in isolation 
because of the high degree of interdependence.

Landscape connectivity has been defined as the degree to which a landscape facilitates or impedes movement of 
organisms among resource patches.  Despite much attention to the concept of landscape connectivity as an important 
factor in maintaining gene flow across large areas, few studies have attempted to validate models of connectivity with 
measures of genetic differentiation among subpopulations connected by dispersal.  We studied the effects of landscape 
connectivity on genetic structuring of puma (Puma concolor) populations in a heterogeneous landscape using 16 
microsatellite markers.  We obtained approximately 550 DNA samples from hunter-killed pumas in Arizona, Colorado, 
New Mexico and Utah, and delineated subpopulations based on kill locations.  We examined genetic structuring 
throughout the study area with respect to 1) geographic distance between subpopulations and 2) a simple, a priori model 
of "effective resistance,” which incorporated information on inter-population connectivity using mapped puma habitat.  The 
landscape connectivity model better predicted rates of gene flow among subpopulations than did geographic distance 
alone (Mantel regressions, R2 = 0.47, p << 0.01 for genetic distance vs. geographic distance, R2 = 0.73, p << 0.01 for 
genetic distance vs. effective resistance).  Analyses of puma genotype data using neighbor joining trees, NMDS 
ordinations, and Bayesian clustering techniques consistently indicate splits between northern and southern populations 
coinciding with gaps in puma habitat.  Southern subpopulations exhibited greater numbers of alleles than did those to the 
north, consistent with recent hypotheses of a Pleistocene extinction of North American pumas, followed by recolonization 
via Central America.

Grasslands once dominated central North America, but have undergone radical and rapid changes in the past century.  
The USGS Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center, Snake River Field Station (SRFS) developed the 
PRAIRIEMAP project in response to growing concern among scientists and resource managers over significant declines 
in grassland ecosystems and the wildlife species that depend on them for their survival.  PRAIRIEMAP is a web-based 
GIS database containing spatial information for the region encompassing the historical extent of prairie grasslands.  State 
and federal agencies, the primary entities responsible for the management of prairie grasslands, need this information to 
develop proactive management strategies to prevent prairie-grassland wildlife species from being listed as Threatened or 
Endangered Species, or to develop appropriate responses if listing does occur.  Spatial data are an important component 

 
55 
in documenting current habitat and other environmental conditions, which can be used to identify areas that hav e 
undergone significant changes in land cover and to identify underlying causes.  Spatial data will also be a critical 
component guiding the decision processes for restoration of habitat in the Great Plains.  As such, the PRAIRIEMAP 
database will facilitate analyses of large-scale and range-wide factors that may be causing declines in grassland habitat 
and populations of grassland-obligate species.  For the short, mixed, and tall-grass regions of west-central North America, 
spatial data currently are limited in the extent of coverage, not readily accessible, or may not be available in digital format.  
Collecting, documenting, and making common datasets available for subsequent analyses are critical components in the 
management of grassland habitats.  Therefore, development of a reliable spatial database carries multiple benefits for 
land and wildlife management. The project consists of three ongoing components: (1) identify relevant spatial data, (2) 
assemble, document, and archive spatial data on a computer server, and (3) develop and maintain the project web site 
(http://prairiemap.wr.usgs.gov) for query and transfer of GIS data to managers and researchers.  PRAIRIEMAP contains 
spatial for both Colorado and New Mexico, such as prairie dog colony locations, f ire perimeters, and grazing allotments 
and therefore has potential for direction application to research being conducted on the Colorado Plateau.

A diverse  array of bees serves as the principal pollinators in most terrestrial ecosystems.  Despite their importance much 
remains to be learned about bees, particularly at the community level.  What factors influence the composition of a bee 
community in a desert landscape where resources are often sparse and unpredictable from year to year?  How do serious 
drought conditions affect bee populations dependent on floral resources for their survival?  In an effort to answer these 
questions and document the bees of an unknown and remote landscape, we have surveyed extensively throughout Grand 
Staircase Escalante National  Monument for the last four years.  In this vast and habitat-rich area we have discovered 
over 530 species in more than 50 genera, the second most diverse bee fauna sampled to date.  Among the bees 
documented are a number of new species, and several range extensions for bees not previously recorded from Utah.  
Bee distributions are very patchy on this landscape.   Communities of high elevations tend to be more similar to each 
other than to adjacent low elevation communities, suggesting that elevational gradients play a large role in bee community 
dynamics. Interannual variability of bee populations seems largely tied to water availability and, consequently, to flowering 
resource predictability. Several heavily visited plant species have shown considerable variability in the number of bees 
they support.  Pollination visitation rates to Chrysothamnus (rabbitbrush) in 2000, a relatively dry year for the region, were 
twice rates in 2001, a year when other flowering plants bloomed in greater abundance.  Finally, several species have 
experienced significant declines, possibly as a result of drought conditions and slow recolonization rates.  Bumblebees 
(Bombus) in an isolated montane area experienced precipitous declines in abundance over the course of three years with 
a reduction in species richness from six species to one.

Previous investigators (Hereford et al, 2002) have postulated there have been three climate regimes in the Colorado 
Plateau during the 20th Century: 1905-1941, 1942-1977, and 1978-1998.  Changes in the ability of four rivers in the 
Colorado Plateau (USA) to transport sediment were investigated using the time series of Sediment Transport Capacity 
Index (STCI) which represents the variation of the ability of a river to transport sediment.  The four rivers are the Rio 
Puerco near Bernardo, NM; Paria River at Lees Ferry, AZ; Sevier River at Hatch, UT; and the Little Colorado at Woodruff, 
AZ.  The index is calibrated to measured sediment concentrations.  The STCI time series graphs suggest there was a 
change in the c limate about 1941 and there is a high probability a change in the climate also occurred in 1923.  The 
situation for the postulated change in 1977 is not clear.  There do appear to be changes between the dry 1942-1977 
period and the wet 1978-1998 period but these are not the same in each of the four rivers.  The STCI time series for the 
Sevier River had the expected pattern because the STCI increased nearly to the pre-1942 values from lower 1942-1977 
values.  The average STCI for the Little Colorado River increased but not nearly as much as suggested by the change in 
precipitation.  The STCI for the Paria River essentially did not change.  The change in STCI expected based on the 
change in precipitation, and changes in the time series of STCI in the other three  rivers, did not occur in the Rio Puerco.  
The STCI of the Rio Puerco decreased significantly between the 1942-1997 period and the 1978-1998 period.

Colorado Plateau landscapes are characterized by spatially distinct patterns in vegetation.  Ecologists recognize that 
strong spatial patterns in vegetation generally are attributable to topoedaphic heterogeneity and/or disturbance history.  
Where soil-generated patterns are predominant, mechanistic links between soil characteristics and vegetation patterns 
often remain poorly understood.  In part this is a consequence of the effort and expense involved in detailed plant-soil 
studies.  But it is increasingly apparent that many traditional measures of nutrient “availability” may inadequately describe 
the dynamic nature of the plant-soil environment and thus fail to reveal sought-after relationships.  We investigated soil 
traits responsible for spatial patterns of  Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) invasion in undisturbed grasslands of Canyonlands 
National Park.  Field experiments were conducted at 17 sites representing a wide range of soil characteristics and pre-
treatment Bromus abundances.  Standard physical and chemical soil measures, ion-exchange resin capsules, and ion-
exchange resin bags were used to describe spatial and seasonal variations in the soil environment.  Bromus performance 
measures included establishment rates, seasonal relative growth rates, and whole-season biomass production.  The 
greatest among-soil variation in Bromus performance occurred during winter, when relative growth rates were inversely 
related to pH buffer capacity (acid-neutralizing potential).  Biogeochemical principles, growth-rate measurements, in situ 
resin bags, and leaf -tissue analyses support the hypothesis that this soil gradient represents a gradient in P dynamics for 
Bromus.  In calcareous soils, a seasonal increase in the dissolution of P-sorbing carbonate compounds (and a 
corresponding increase in P bioavailability) theoretically occurs in winter when cold-moist soil conditions favor the reaction 
of soil CO2 and H2O to generate carbonic acid, H2CO3.  The occurrence of this phenomenon (and corresponding 
nutritional benefits) should vary spatially in relation to pH buffer capacity.  Insights gained from this study have 
implications for our ability to understand and predict spatial patterns of exotic species’ invasions in arid landscapes.

Three previous reports of microgeographic variation of glycerate dehydrogenase (Gly) frequencies in piñon, Pinus edulis, 
established the hypothesis that Gly frequencies contribute to adaptation to heterogeneous environments, specifically to 
variation in soil moisture. In each of these studies, the frequency of the Gly-3 allele or of Gly-33 homozygotes was higher 
on dry sites than on nearby moist sites. Here we attempt to extend these observations by testing the hypothesis that Gly 
frequencies respond to soil moisture variation on a range-wide scale. Gly frequencies were surveyed in eleven natural 
populations, and the frequency of the Gly-2 allele varied from 0.35 to 0.73 among the sample sites. Elevation varied from 
1,650 to 3,100 m, and summer precipitation, defined as precipitation from April through August, varied from 13.7 to 26.4 
cm. The soil types at the collection sites were schist, quaternary volcanic, or a mixture of shale and sandstone. Logistic 
regression revealed that Gly frequencies did not respond to either elevation or soil type, but were related to summer 
precipitation (P < .01).  The correlation between summer precipitation and the frequenc y of the Gly-2 allele was r = 0.92 
(P < .001). Thus, the patterns of differentiation on microgeographic scales are consistent with greater differentiation on a 
range-wide scale.

The San Miguel River is one of the few remaining rivers in Colorado that is free of major dams or diversions.  The San 
Miguel and its tributaries support diverse native riparian communities but are being invaded by tamarisk, (Tamarix 
ramosissima, Tamarix chinensis and hybrids) and Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia).  The Nature Conservancy plans 
to remove all of the exotic riparian vegetation in the million acre watershed between 2002 and 2005.  In order to monitor 
the aquatic and riparian arthropod communities during the tamarisk removal, I will use a Before-After-Control-Impact 
(BACI) design to test the hypothesis that riparian and aquatic arthropod abundance and diversity are greater in native and 
restored riparian forest and stream reaches that run through native forest than in adjacent forest dominated by exotic 
vegetation.  The aquatic invertebrate sampling generally follow s the Environmental Protection Agency’s Rapid 
Bioassessment Protocol with 10 semi-quantitative kick net samples and 3-quantitative fixed area samples (30 x 30 cm) 
collected along a 100 meter reach of stream.  In June 2003, aquatic invertebrates were collected in native and tamarisk 
dominated reaches of Broad Canyon Creek, a small perennial tributary to the San Miguel.  Aquatic samples were 
collected again from the native and cleared sites (formerly tamarisk sites) approximately one month after tamarisk 
removal.  At this meeting I will present preliminary results of Simpson’s diversity and overall aquatic insect abundance.

Although drought frequency and severity are predicted to increase, the consequences of these changes are largely 
unknown.  We examined the impact of two severe droughts on the dominant tree species of a major vegetation type in the 
US, the pinyon-juniper woodland.  Pinyon mortality was 30X greater than juniper mortality, resulting in shifts in species 
dominance such that stands now resemble those found 400m lower in elevation.  Sites that suffered high mortality during 
the first drought also suffered high mortality during the second drought, demonstrating that subsequent droughts reinforce 
patterns established in earlier droughts.  Mortality of mature trees was  2-5X greater than juveniles, a pattern associated 
with facilitation and the cost of reproduction. The selective loss of reproductive pinyons and their associated mutualisms 
ensures that these vegetation shifts will be long-term.  Because ~1000 species are associated with pinyon, the shift in 
dominance of these woodlands will have community and ecosystem consequences.   
 
 
AN EVALUATION OF MULE DEER HARVEST ESTIMATES ON THE NORTH KAIBAB IN ARIZONA

We compared mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) harvest estimates from Arizona Game Management Unit (Unit) 12A 
obtained from a mandatory hunter checking station with those from a voluntary hunter questionnaire mailed, on average, 
to 2,543 permit holders annually to determine what differences existed between the data sets. The Arizona Game and 
Fish Department has traditionally used mail surveys and a mandatory check station to estimate deer harvest and hunter 
participation on the North Kaibab (Unit 12A).  Biases are known to exist in both methods.  Previous analyses have shown 
that the mail questionnaire results in harvest overestimates of about 10 percent assuming that all successful hunters 
check out at the check station. However, we have observed that this assumption is not accurate, as an undetermined 
number of hunters do not comply.  We examined data from 1990-2002 to document if reporting biases remained similar.  
The 13-year mean mule deer harvest as estimated from the mandatory check station was 1,078 (SE = 234.17).  During 
the same period, the mean mail survey estimate was 1,230 (SE = 262.97).  Harvest estimates differed between 
mandatory check and mail survey estimates (t = 4.961, P = 0.001), however a significant (P = 0.001) linear relationship 
existed between the two estimates (Y = 19.212 + 1.122 X) that explained a substantial proportion of the variation (r2 = 
0.998).  Using both sampling approaches to derive harvests estimates are probably unnecessary.

Arid and semiarid grasslands across the world provide important ecosystem services to society; thus the need to develop 
management strategies that promote ecological and economic sustainability for maintaining ecosystem health of these 
rangelands ecosystems. Scientific information is certainly not lacking, but its contribution to management is often 
overshadowed by raging debates over public values.  Uncertainties over climate, fire frequencies, encroaching 
woodlands, and changing societal patterns in land use, confound the issue even more, leaving managers perplexed as to 
how to best manage these ecosystems.  The recent popularity of collaborative groups across the West reflect the 
increasing concern to address societal goals and ecological concerns  in tandem, but whether these are effective in 
implementing sustainable goals is also in question. Here we present a framework for assessing, evaluating, and 
monitoring the outcomes of management strategies at an ecosystem level, particularly those derived from a collaborative 
approach to rangeland management. Through the use of a range of indicators, the Holistic Ecosystem Health Indicator 
(HEHI) framework integrates multiple ecological and sociological criteria to quantify their responses through time.  A key 
innovative aspect of this framework is that the interactions that define sustainable use of the land, such as land use, 
regulations, collaborative decision-making and social perceptions of the landscape, are quantified and monitored as well.  
To demonstrate the  utility of this framework on a site-specific basis, we have been working with a local collaborative land 
management group, the Diablo Trust, located southeast of Flagstaff, AZ. Scientific literature, management objectives and 
collaborator input has helped inform the selection of appropriate indicators to be used in the framework. The primary 
result of efforts to date has been the selection of key indicators, including: soil quality, vegetation, watershed health, 
primary productivity, erosion, wildlife, demographics, economic viability, access to services, community strength, land 
distribution, land use, public awareness and perspectives, social capital, and implementation of regulations. These will be 
presented in detail. This framework will allow managers and stakeholders to integrate scientific information to aid in 
defining and prioritizing adaptive management strategies,  facilitate communication among stakeholders, and assess 
progress towards their goals.

Through a grant from the National Commission on Sustainable Forestry, we are documenting the range of understory 
plant composition changes which have occurred over the last 150 years in ponderosa forests and pinyon-juniper 
woodlands in the Four Corners states. We are focusing on sites with long cultural histories including: Canyon de Chelley, 
Jemez Mountains, Mesa Verde, Chaco Canyon, and the San Francisco Peaks-Sunset Crater area. Using tree ring and 
fire scar data, packrat middens, pollen and repeat photography, we are attempting to define the diverse elements of the 
"reference envelope" which can serve as guidelines in restoration efforts. Our preliminary results suggest that: 1) post-
1850 fire histories were much more varied than commonly assumed, due to cultural land use factors; 2) understory 
species richness appears to have declined at many of these sites, including species which provided important non-timber 
forest products to Hispanic-, Anglo- and Native-American communities nearby; 3) some of these changes can be 
attributed to land use treatments rather than to climate change. The implications for forest users and managers will be 
discussed.

Interpreting the archaeological record can be aided by an understanding of the physical landscape and changes to the 
physical landscape, particularly as they are related to inferences of past climate.  Recent alluvial stratigraphy and 
archaeological research along the Walnut Canyon drainage and adjacent areas is providing important new data and initial 
interpretations in this respect.  Alluvial stratigraphy and landform evolution research in Walnut Canyon and nearby 
localities is starting to provide a framework for interpreting Holocene landscape changes in the Ponderosa pine forests of 
the Mogollon Rim.  Main stem streams like Walnut Creek, as well as small-scale alluvial fans and intermediate-scale 
drainages, appear to contain a fairly complete record of Holocene alluviation.  Alluvial fans record a period of rather rapid 
sedimentation between about 10,000 and 8,000 years ago, slower sedimentation rates between about 8,000 and 4,000 
years ago and increased sedimentation in the last 500 years.  The highest alluvial terrace of Walnut Canyon drainage 
dates between 8000 BP and 4500 BP.  The surface stabilized after about 4000 BP until sometime after about AD 1250.  
Also, at least two other intermediate-scale drainages record alluviation between about 7000 BP and 4000 BP.   
Paleoclimate data indicates that the middle Holocene, between ca. 7000 and 4500 BP, was relatively warm and dry on the 
Colorado Plateau.  Stratigraphic evidence of alluviation in the Walnut Canyon area during the middle Holocene suggests 
that aggradation, rather than dissection, was occurring in some alluvial contexts. Emerging understanding of Holocene 
alluvial landscapes can be placed in a better cultural context due to recent archaeological survey by the National Park 
Service in new lands added to Walnut Canyon National Monument in 1996.  Survey of ca. 1500 acres in new lands areas 
resulted in the documentation of a surprisingly high number, compared to what was known from previous research, of 
Archaic period (ca. 9000 – 2000 BP) site components and projectile points.  This data allows an initial description of 
Archaic period settlement pattern spatial and temporal distribution along the Walnut Canyon drainage.  Spatial and 
temporal trends in Archaic period settlement can then be compared to the results of alluvial stratigraphy research and 
resulting inferences of landscape and climatic change.  This comparison in turn leads to a preliminary discussion of the 
impact of landscape and climate change on Archaic populations along the Walnut Canyon drainage. 
 
 
TAPESTRIES IN STONE: UNDERSTANDING CLIFF PALACE ARCHITECTURE

Work at Cliff Palace over the past several years has served as a template/case study for revisiting sites that were 
excavated very early during the 20th century, prior to the development of behavior-oriented archeology.  The work links 
integrated tabular data bases with a graphics package designed to collect data addressing two models developed as part 
of the Archeological Site Conservation Program at Mesa Verde National Park.  The hierarchical social interaction model 
explores the relationship between architectural spaces and constructs at various social levels ranging from household 
units up through dual divisions of the village, potentially moieties.  Reconsideration of the architecture in alcove sites 
requires identifying households and how many are present.  Comparative studies at Mesa Verde suggests that larger 
social groups seem to link between 18 and 25 households, and that the largest residential sites like Cliff Palace seem to 
have about 150 enclosed rooms plus a variety of open spaces.  We also developed a model focusing on how building 
materials of stone, mud and wood are procured, modified, and combined during wall construction.  The model discusses 
ways that construction episodes can be isolated in the field and presents parameters for identifying individual mason’s 

 
59 
signatures.  The ultimate goal is to evaluate whether and how professional builders might have augmented building 
construction done by household units.

Oak Creek in Central Arizona has historically contained one of the largest populations of narrow -headed garter snake 
(Thamnophis rufipunctatus ) in the United States. However, after surveys for narrow -headed garter snakes in Oak Creek 
by Rosen and Schwalbe in 1985 and 1986, it was estimated that the creek contained fewer than 1000 sub-adults and 
adults. The first subsequent systematic surveys for narrow -headed garter snakes were conducted in Oak Creek between 
1999 and 2001. Based on these surveys, I will discuss the current distribution and abundance of narrow -headed garter 
snakes in Oak Creek, and compare data from earlier surveys to evaluate long-term population trends. Garter snake prey 
distribution and use, including the mixed roles of non-native fish, and habitat use by the snakes were also studied. Lastly, 
I will discuss current collaborative management efforts for narrow -headed garter snakes in Oak Creek.

During a severe drought we studied the effects of plant mortality on the community composition and stand structure within 
and across three vegetation zones along an elevational gradient.  We studied patterns of mortality in Juniper grassland, 
Pinyon-Juniper woodland and Ponderosa forest, and found that plant death can significantly structure vegetation 
communities.  Three major patterns emerged.  1. Trees of different sizes are affected differentially by drought.  For some 
species, we estimate that trees of the smallest size classes had as much as a 50% greater probability of dying than trees 
in the largest size classes.  This differential mortality altered the stand structure within community types.  2.  Through the 
use of Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS), we found that the structure of plant communities differed both 
between vegetation types as well as along a mortality gradient within vegetation types.  3.  Mortality affects plant 
communities by causing shifts in community structure.  Vector-fitting analysis of ordination plots suggests that as plant 
assemblages re-organize after a mortality event, novel communities may emerge.  We conclude that mortality should be 
considered an important factor in the structuring of plant communities, especially within the context of global warming.

Because of the proposed harvest of eagle nestlings by Native Americans from sites within national monuments and 
national parks on the Colorado Plateau, and the current effort by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to determine 
the population status of Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos ) throughout their range, I initiated a study to determine the 
nesting  density, productivity, and nest success of Golden Eagles in Grand Canyon National Park (GCNP) and 
surrounding natural areas.  The study objectives include: (1) contributing to the national effort of assessing the population 
status of Golden Eagles, and (2) developing a baseline of information for areas most likely affected by future harvests of 
eagles.  I began nest surveys in GCNP and Vermilion Cliffs National Monument in spring 2002.  However, the majority of 
surveying will occur in 2003 and 2004.  Planned survey -areas include: GCNP, Grand Canyon-Parashant National 
Monument, Vermilion Cliffs National Monument, and Mesa Verde National Park.  Additionally, I plan to supplement current 
surveying and monitoring efforts at Glen Canyon National Recreational Area, and possibly Wupatki National Monument.  I 
will discuss the survey methods and preliminary results from the completed fieldwork.

The Ponderosa pine forest ecosystem in northern Arizona is widely considered in poor health due to grazing, logging and 
a century of fire suppression.  Forest restoration is a systematic undertaking to recreate a  fully functioning ecosystem.  At 
the same time America’s expectations for public forests is slowly changing to one that includes fire as a healthy, periodic 
event in the ecosystem.  However, the wildland-urban interface is expanding rapidly and making effective forest 
management difficult (Bradshaw 1987; Bailey 1991; Cook 1997).  For instance prescribed burning is an emerging, 
important tool for forest managers that highlights the inherent conflict between a fully functioning ecosystem and the 
human desire for safety, clean air, predictability and the maintenance of an ideal (i.e. what a forest “should look like”).  
This investigation assumed that to successfully elicit public support for restoration and prescribed burns, and to clearly 
define their own roles, managers and policy-makers need to understand the values, preferences, and attitudes of 
residents in the interface (Cortner 1991).  This is a report on the attitudes, perceptions and knowledge of full and part time 
residents in northern Arizona who live in the Ponderosa pine ecosystem.

During the summer, spotted bats (Euderma maculatum) forage in subalpine meadows on the Kaibab Plateau in northern 
Arizona.  These spotted bats forage in areas located 1900 m above and 43 km from their known maternity roosts in the 
Grand Canyon.  From 2001 to 2002, we investigated our hypothesis that summertime spotted bat foraging activity on the 
Kaibab Plateau relates to prey availability on the plateau.  We collected guano from all spotted bats captured in mist nets.  
We used ultraviolet light traps  to measure changes in relative insect abundance and species composition from May to 
August in meadows where spotted bats foraged.  We compared insect abundance and species composition to prey 
insects visually identified in guano collected from spotted bats during the same period.  In both years, the insect order 
Lepidoptera visually accounted for 95 to 100% of spotted bat guano contents.  In 2001, the family Sphingidae was the 
most frequently captured Lepidopteran family during spotted bat presence on the plateau.  In 2002, the family Noctuidae 
was the most frequently captured Lepidopteran family during spotted bat presence on the plateau.  In 2002, we also 
analyzed d13C and d15N stable isotope signatures of the bats and the available prey.  The d13C and d15N signature of 
spotted bat guano did not differ from 3 moth families: Noctuidae, Geometridae, and Lasiocampidae (p > 0.01).  The 
signatures of moth families Arctiidae and Sphingidae differed significantly from the signature of spotted bat guano (p < 
0.01).  Our results indicated that spotted bats preyed most heavily on noctuid, geometrid, and lasiocampid moths.  
Noctuid and sphingid moths feed on forbs and grasses that are found in the subalpine meadows of the plateau.  The 
degree to which spotted bats in northern Arizona depend on the meadows of the Kaibab Plateau remains unknown, but 
conifer encroachment in subalpine meadows may negatively affect available foraging areas and prey for spotted bats on 
the plateau. 
 
 
CONSERVING AND MANAGING MOUNTAIN LIONS IN A CHANGING SOCIOCULTURAL LANDSCAPE

The conservation and management of mountain lions (Puma concolor) has become one of the most complex and 
controversial issues in modern wildlife management. Scientific understanding of the species remains nascent due to the 
inherent difficulty and expense of studying this elusive and solitary creature and the lack of accurate and reliable scientific 
information on the size and vigor of their populations. Moreover, mountain lion management is principally dictated by 
traditional attitudes and local politics even when scientific information is available. As the only top carnivore sustaining 
viable populations across the western U.S., mountain lions are an ideal focal species for efforts to conserve native 
ecosystems and biodiversity at the landscape level. Indeed, the mountain lions’ extensive distribution, its adaptability to a 
wide array of habitats, and its superior predatory ability may afford the species a more important ecological role than any 
other top predator in the western hemisphere. However, despite compelling evidence of the ecological significance of 
mountain lions for maintaining ecosystem integrity and s tability, mounting public appreciation of mountain lions opposition 
to some management practices, and the lack of sound population data, the management of mountain lions remains driven 
largely by a philosophy that emphasizes the utility of mountain lions to humans. Efforts to conserve mountain lions will 
become increasingly complicated and divisive because of escalating human immigration, development and activity in 
mountain lion habitat. Creating and implementing a landscape level conservation approach is essential to sustaining 
viable mountain lion populations and ecosystems. Importantly, to be effective such efforts must be considerate of and 
adaptive to a changing sociopolitical landscape. In this light, this presentation will review trends in public attitudes towards 
mountain lions and their management and synthesize recommendations for their conservation.

Traditionally the Sonsela Sandstone has been considered a single bed within the Petrified Forest Member of the Chinle 
Formation.  Recent stratigraphic work by researchers from Petrified Forest National Park, Northern Arizona University, 
and the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science has shown that the Sonsela actually represents a unique 
depositional package containing much more strata then previously recognized, and should be elevated to member status.  
As a result, many more fossil vertebrate localities are located within the Sonsela Member than previously realized, greatly 
expanding the faunal assemblage known from this unit.  Comprehension of this fauna is critical to understanding faunal 
changes at the Carnian-Norian boundary.  Existing, as well as new sites, have produced what appears to be a transitional 
fauna of traditionally Carnian and Norian vertebrates including phytosaurs, aetosaurs, and other archosauromorphs.

Impacts on the endangered Southwestern Willow Flycatcher from the 2002 drought varied across their range from no 
discernable impact at some sites, to near catastrophic reproductive failure at others.  One of the most heavily impacted 
sites known was at Roosevelt Lake, a central Arizona population that we have studied for over 8 years.  An estimated 296 
adults present at Roosevelt Lake in 2002 produced only 6 known young, with a 97% reduction (0.07) in average seasonal 
fecundity (mean fledglings per female).  Many flycatchers did not even attempt to breed.  This compares with an average 
seasonal fecundity of 1.96 and with most adults attempting to nest.  In 2003, the population of flycatchers at Roosevelt 
Lake dropped by 20%.  However, the decrease may have been much greater without the presence of a surplus population 
of relatively young, non-territorial "floater" individuals that appear to have reduced the impacts of the drought on the 
population.  In addition, the 2003 breeding season was a productive year, and the flycatchers may well recover in another 
few years.  We will discuss the effects of the 2002 drought, the after-effects seen in 2003, and biological and conservation 
lessons that can be drawn from documenting the effects of the drought. 
 
 
ANALYSIS OF BEETLE ASEMBLAGES ALONG A VEHICLE DISTURBANCE GRADIENT IN SALT CREEK CANYON, 
CANYONLANDS NATIONAL PARK, UT

Salt Creek Canyon in Canyonlands National Park (CANY) is the only perennial riparian zone in CANY. Historically, Salt 
Creek has been used as a road by off-road vehicles. Portions of the stream have been closed recently. This divides Salt 
Creek Canyon into three regions: No Road (NR), where vehicle use ended in 1964, Closed Road (CL), where vehicle use 
ended in 1998, and Road Open (RO), where vehicle use continues. Since 2000, these regions have been the subject of 
an Earthwatch-funded study surveying the invertebrate community of Salt Creek. The goal is to establish monitoring 
methods to evaluate the effects of vehicle disturbance on the Salt Creek Ecosystem. In this portion of the study, beetles 
collected during the 2000 field season were analyzed. Beetles have been identified to family, and classified into 
morphospecies; ninety morphospecies have been recognized. Based on an examination of the functional roles of each 
family, it appears that the beetle community of Salt Creek as a whole is not dominated by any functional group. Also, the 
different levels of vehicular disturbance are not associated with dominance by any families of beetles. In contrast, when 
the taxonomic resolution was increased for some groups, patterns did emerge, For example, within the Scarabaeidae, 
Trichioryhssemus riparius is absent from the NR region and is primarily found (62/65) in the CL region. In contrast, 
another scarab, Dichelonyx, is found primarily (41/46) in the NR region. While members of the Chrysomelidae were 
generally distributed, members of the subfamily Eumolpinae were restricted to the two trapping sites adjoining the RO and 
CL regions. As a member of the Psammodiini, T. riparius  is thought to be a detritivore. When combined with the other 
dominant detritivores, the Tenebrionidae, it appears that detritivorous beetles are more abundant in the RO and CL 
regions: only 5/40 tenebrionid specimens were collected in the NR region, whereas 18/40 and 17/40 were collected in the 
CL and RO regions, respectively. When examined at the family level, other broad functional groups such as carnivores, 
herbivores, and omnivores, do not appear to be concentrated in any specific region of the study area. Taken together, 
these results suggest that family-level analysis of the beetle community is inadequate to elucidate effects of disturbance 
on patterns and processes in Salt Creek, and that greater taxonomic resolution is needed to understand and monitor the 
effects of off-road vehicle use.

As part of the National Park Service Inventory and Monitoring initiative, eight national parks and monuments on the 
northern Colorado Plateau were surveyed for herpetofauna during 2001. Using GIS, habitats within the parks were 
stratified according to elevation, slope and aspect, and random points were selected across this stratification. One-hectare 
plots at these points were surveyed for the presence of herpetofauna, and habitat data were collected. In addition to these 
time-area constrained and habitat specific searches, searches not constrained by time, area, or habitat were carried out 
throughout the parks. Localities of previous herpetofauna observations were also visited. The objectives for this project 
were to a) generate a species list for each national park, b) to determine distribution and habitat use of species present, 
and c) to compare effectiveness of survey methods. Comparisons in total observations, catch per unit effort and seasonal 
variation between constrained and non-constrained methods will be presented, along with GIS findings and a summary of 
species encountered. The results of this inventory will direct future survey  and monitoring efforts within the Colorado 
Plateau.

As of May 1, 2001, data collected using Global Position System (GPS) Units no longer required differential correction, 
given that  the user is content with a small error. Oderwald and Boucher (2003) showed that when collecting point data, 
differential correction is no longer necessary, because point data uses the average of a collection of points, which proved 
to be highly accurate. However, when collecting area data, Oderwald and Boucher (2003) suggested the application of a 
formula in order to calculate potential error. However, the authors of this study suggest that for areas larger than one 
thousand hectares, differential correction becomes irrelevant, given the extensive size of the area.  They also affirm that 
uncorrected GPS area data is more accurate and more precise in calculating area than traditional collected area data. For 
the purpose of this study, two large watersheds, Bar M and Woods Canyon, found within the Beaver Creek Experimental 
Watershed in North Central Arizona, were recorded with a handheld GPS unit. The computed area of each watershed 
was then compared to area calculated by hand using traditional methods.

The Imperiled Species Work Group of the Colorado Plateau Chapter of the Society for Conservation Biology (SCB) was 
founded in 2002 to help native animals and plants that are in danger or at risk of disappearing f rom the Colorado Plateau 
Region. Its goals are to heighten public understanding of the plight of imperiled species, and to enhance efforts on their 
behalf by natural resource agencies, landowners, wildlife advocacy groups, environmental organizations, and others. The 
Work Group seeks to increase regional awareness and activity to protect and restore natural biodiversity.  Our current 
project is to produce an attractive, provocative guidebook that will alert the public and policy makers to the full spectrum of 
endangered and vulnerable wildlife in “our own backyard,” and offer concrete suggestions and strategies for conservation. 
The guidebook will cover all taxonomic groups and will include descriptive profiles for each imperiled species, field 
observations and natural history notes, vignettes or anecdotes, original illustrations and other artwork, photographs, 
regional and North American range maps, habitat requirements and threats, species conservation and legal status, and 
practical suggestions, strategies, and ideas for conservation and recovery. Initial project activities included development 
and expert review of candidate lists of regionally imperiled amphibians, birds, fishes, invertebrates, mammals, reptiles, 
and vascular and non-vascular plants. The project tests the ability of a SCB chapter to utilize its base of expertise on a 
voluntary basis on behalf of biodiversity conservation. Strengths and weaknesses of the guidebook process will be 
discussed.  We encourage expanded participation by SCB members and others whose hearts are with the wild animals 
and plants of the Colorado Plateau.

Changes in the structure and composition of western forests due to fire suppression, grazing, and timber harvest, have 
resulted in increased threat of catastrophic wildfires and a general reduction in the health of these forests.  Large-scale 
treatments designed to reduce the threat of catastrophic wildfire and restore ecosystem health are now being proposed in 
many locations across the Colorado Plateau.  However, the effects of restoration treatments on biodiversity, have not 
been well-studied, leading to concern over implementation of treatments across large landscapes.  Thus, there is a need 
for new methodologies linking management to the relationship between biodiversity and forest structure.  Moreover, a 
comprehensive approach to assessing the potential effects of large-scale treatments on wildlife is needed to help monitor 
and protect species of concern.  The Forest Ecosystem Restoration Analysis (ForestERA) Project is creating remotely-
sensed data layers of forest structure and composition, researching the effects of different treatments on forest structure, 
and collaborating with researchers studying the relationships between forest structure and the distribution and abundance 
of selected wildlife taxa.  Using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and specialized coverages, we are able to make 
general predictions about the effects of different types and placements of treatments on a variety of species in ponderosa 
pine forests in northern Arizona, including Mexican Spotted Owl, Northern Goshawk, Tassel-eared Squirrel, and many 
others.  The response of these species to associated changes in forest structure can be characterized across large 
landscapes.  By considering a range of treatment options, ForestERA tools will better allow managers to produce 
predictive models of forest change that may be overlaid with taxonomic distributions, inhabited areas, and other spatial 
data.  Furthermore, ForestERA products will allow managers to assess larger patterns of biodiversity when undertaking 
the prioritization and placement of forest restoration treatments in the region. 
 
 
COUGARS IN THE WEST: PREDATION AND MANAGEMENT 
 
QUIGLEY, HOWARD 
Beringia South, Kelly, Wyoming, 83011 
 
Some interests and concerns related to cougars (Puma concolor) have gained recent attention, including cougar/human 
interactions, cougar/wolf interactions, and cougars as landscape conservation species. However, much of the professional 
and general interest in the species – both historically and at present – is driven by a quest to characterize and understand 
cougar-prey relations and to develop effective management. Management of cougars can take a variety of forms, from full 
“control and elimination” to full protection. Although fully protected from hunting in federal lands like national parks and 
some wildlife refuges, most cougar populations are managed under state and provincial jurisdiction. Management status 
under these entities ranges from trophy to vermin and is driven by a variety of influences, including traditional interest in 
sport hunting, local and regional societal mores, and property damage control. Recent testing and fine-tuning of harvest 
strategies have had mixed results but are providing additional insights into effects of different harvest strategies on 
cougars. Our understanding of cougar-prey relations is derived from few rigorous studies and a variety of short-term and 
incomplete datasets that cumulatively indicate this predator is inextricably tied to deer and elk populations in the West. 
Prey vulnerability is related to age and health, although naïve prey can also be an important issue for managers, 
especially as it influences ungulate reintroduction efforts. Cougar predation of domestic animals can also be an important 
issue for wildlife managers, land owners, and pet owners. Reduction of such depredation has generally been dealt with 
through removal of “problem” cougars. However, long-term solutions are more likely to center on reducing the availability 
of vulnerable domestic stock in rural areas and the creation of “zero-tolerance” zones in suburban areas. Cougars present 
some especially difficult challenges for researchers and managers due to their secretive nature and their potential for 
conflict with humans. However, new technologies and new commitments to maintaining intact, functioning ecosystems will 
add to our ability to understand cougar predation and manage populations for a variety of objectives. 
 
 
DO BLM SOIL STABILITY INDICATORS CORRELATE WITH MYCORRHIZAL INOCULUM AND PLANT

The Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) protocol for managing grazing includes evaluating the health of grazing 
allotments.  One attribute assessed by the BLM is site and soil stability that estimates the degree of soil erosion using 
several qualitative indicators.  Soil loss disrupts ecosystem functioning because soil nutrients and biological activity are 
concentrated in the top few centimeters of soil.  Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) form a mutualistic association with 
plants.  These fungi transfer phosphorus and other nutrients to the plant in return for carbon from the plant host.  Due to 
the complex interactions between plant host and AMF species, the fungi can increase the growth rates of some plants and 

 
64 
suppress the growth of other plants.  The BLM indicators for soil stability need to predict potential soil loss before AMF are 
negatively affected because AMF are vital to the health of rangelands.  However, the ecological implications of the BLM 
soil stability ratings have not been tested.  In this study, we address whether soils rated as having poor, moderate or high 
soil stability correlate with mycorrhizal inoculum potential (MIP) and plant establishment.  We hypothesize: 1) soil stability 
ratings correlate with MIP, 2) soil stability ratings correlate with the survival and establishment of both naturally 
regenerating seedlings and planted seedlings for AMF-dependent plant species.   We recently initiated a greenhouse 
bioassay to determine the MIP of soils collected from Grand Staircase – Escalante National Monument (GSENM) that 
span a range of soil stability ratings.  The second and third years of this project will determine the strength of the 
correlation between sites rated as having poor, moderate, or high soil stability with MIP and plant establishment.  We will 
also research the interactions between weedy and native plant hosts, AMF, and soil stability ratings. The studies planned 
for years two and three will address the potential need to mitigate for AMF inoculum loss by reintroducing fungi.

Successful conservation and management of ecosystems requires an understanding of the mechanisms determining 
community assembly.  Classic laboratory and field experiments have clearly demonstrated the local incidence of negative 
interspecific interactions such as predation and competition, but interpretation of evidence of competitive structure at the 
scale of species communities has been controversial.  In this study we seek to explicitly quantify patterns of community 
assembly at the landscape scale by examining patterns of species co-occurrence in a single, contiguous terrestrial 
ecosystem.  The Ponderosa Pine forest ecosystem of the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park is relatively 
homogeneous and historically unmodified and supports at least ten, extant species of native carnivores.  Using a 
Geographic Information System (GIS) database, we selected twenty sites to randomly sample carnivore species presence 
across the landscape while minimizing variation in habitat variables, such as elevation and forest cover.  Sites were 
sampled during the summer of 2003 using a suite of passive wildlife monitoring techniques, including hair snags, 
remotely-triggered cameras, scat and track surveys.  A Monte Carlo null model analysis of resulting species detections 
will determine whether carnivore species co-occur less frequently than  would be expected by chance, and pairs of 
species with limited coexistence will be identified and compared with respect to diet, morphology, and behavior.  The 
results of this research will inform community assembly theory by providing an explicit test of competitive structure at the 
landscape scale and identify local distributional relationships among carnivore species in Grand Canyon National Park.  
Quantifying co-occurrence patterns in unfragmented habitat will also provide a baseline for assessing carnivore species 
distributions and habitat suitability in more complex, modified ecosystems.

Dalmation toadflax (Linaria dalmatica) is an invasive, noxious weed found throughout the northeastern and western 
United States, and western Canada, invading disturbed sites and degrading wildlife forage and reducing native vegetative 
cover, competing with rare plant species, and reducing land value. This is the first study measuring the spread of 
dalmation toadflax in Arizona ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) after a severe wildfire.  We monitored the growth and 
reproductive potential of dalmation toadflax in relation to burn severity for two years after the Leroux Fire (2001) near 
Flagstaff, AZ.  Sixteen monitoring classes were created (4 plant density classes X 4 burn severity levels), with a total of 
331 plots.  We hypothesized that growth and reproduction of dalmation toadflax would increase with increasing burn 
severity and toadflax plant density.  First year results (2002) showed that toadflax plants in high and moderate burn 
severity areas had the highest average number of flowering stalks and percent cover at all density classes.  Second year 
results (2003) showed that the moderate and high burn severity areas had the greatest increase in percent cover, stem 
density, and flowering stalks in all density classes.  Low severity and unburned plots showed less change at all density 
classes than the moderate and high burn classes.  These results indicate that growth and reproduction of dalmation 
toadflax are closely linked to burn severity, and that fire is a strong vector for spread of this species.  We will model 
toadflax response to enable land managers to identify potential problem areas after a wildfire occurs or before a

Preserving prehistoric architectural resources has at best been a vexing problem for cultural resource managers in 
federal, state, and tribal agencies.  Resource managers are frustrated with the lack of development in methods, 
techniques, and theory as to how (and often why) to preserve these resources.  To many, ruins preservation is largely 

 
65 
synonymous with ruins stabilization.  This mind set is reinforced by a legacy of past preservation treatments focused 
solely on preserving the form and outline of rare architectural sites in dozens of cultural parks in the Southwest.  While the 
public has largely benefited from this treatment approach, resource professionals, scholars, and those closely affiliated 
with these sites recognize that valuable information and cultural values have been compromised or, at worst, destroyed by 
invasive preservation methods.  Due to this loss, many agencies are rethinking their preservation strategies and 
techniques.  The proper management of these types of resources calls for new standards to be developed.  National Park 
Service Archeologists at Wupatki and Walnut Canyon National Monuments have developed a ruins preservation plan and 
implementation guidelines as a tool to assist in designing and developing approaches to ruins preservation that is 
designed to preserve the scientific and cultural integrity of these resources.  The plan and guidelines outline the 
development of a comprehensive preservation program incorporating site monitoring, resource use, and various 
preservation techniques to insure long-term preservation of the scientific and cultural values of these rare and 
irreplaceable resources.

The ponderosa pine partnership was established in 1992 to develop innovative and effective approaches for restoring the 
second-growth ponderosa pine forests that dominate a 70,000-ha landscape in southwestern Colorado.  The first step in 
developing specific restoration goals and methods was to determine the historical range of variability (HRV) in forest 
structure and disturbance regimes.  Local field research revealed that fire intervals (scars on > 25% of recorders within a 
100-ha area) ranged from 5-47 years and median fire intervals were 12-30 years during the reference period (early 1700s 
– late 1800s).  Mean canopy tree density ranged from 37-59 stems/ha during the reference period.  Stand densities in 
1990 were 178-338 stems/ha and most stands had not burned in many decades.  Initial restoration treatments, conducted 
from 1995-1999, entailed mechanical thinning of predominantly smaller-diameter trees to reduce tree densities to ca. 100 
stems/ha, combined with one or two prescribed fires. Quantitative monitoring, implemented as an integral part of the 
restoration treatment, has shown that the treated stands still depart from HRV with respect to tree density and size.  
However, the treated stands have been set on a trajectory towards HRV: they are now less vulnerable to high-severity 
wildfire and insect outbreaks than they were before treatment, and cover and diversity of formerly suppressed herbaceous 
plants have increased significantly.

Since the 1950s, resource managers and sportsmen’s groups have installed thousands of wildlife water developments in 
arid regions of the western United States.  Despite the considerable effort dedicated to building and maintaining wildlife 
waters, their ecological effects have received little study.  Recently, critics have speculated that wildlife waters are of 
questionable value and may in fact be detrimental.  Hypothesized problems include: limited value to game species; 
negligible benefits to nongame wildlife; increased predation rates resulting from expanded distributions of mammalian 
predators and predation events at water sites; deterioration of animal health resulting from poor water quality, exposure to 
water-borne pathogens and water-associated disease vectors; direct wildlife mortality (drowning); overutilization of forage 
resources near wildlife waters; and impacts to native insect pollinators from colonization of previously unwatered areas by 
Africanized honeybees (Apis mellifera scutellata).  In 1999, the Arizona Game and Fish Department, Yuma Proving 
Ground Conservation Program, and Kofa National Wildlife Refuge initiated a 10-year research effort on wildlife waters in 
southwest Arizona.  Here we report on the first phase of our research, along with pertinent findings from other recent 
studies of wildlife waters.  Overall, the results do not support purported negative impacts.  To the contrary, wildlife waters 
are used by and appear to benefit a wide variety of wildlife, particularly nongame species.  Water developments are an 
important management tool in the face of ongoing drought and human-caused loss or degradation of natural water 
sources.

Pinyon-Juniper woodlands comprise 35.5% of lands on the Colorado Plateau managed by the Bureau of Land 
Management (BLM).  For the last fifty -seven years BLM has conducted over 725 pinyon-juniper removal and revegetation 
treatments encompassing 1,450,000 acres constituting 16% of all pinyon-juniper on BLM lands.  The goal of our project is 
to develop a relational database (Oracle) and geographic information systems (GIS) database to assess all of the relevant 
ecological and management information associated with these treatments.  This inventory will provide the basis for 
understanding the long-term efficacy of the treatments and ecological implications.  We envision the combined databases 

 
66 
being used in a variety of ways, including providing managers and researchers with the ability to perform online queries 
and data analyses.  We’ve identified over 150 variables associated with each treatment that can be used in combination 
with multiple GIS data layers (elevation, land ownership, allotments, hydrology, soils, digital orthophotographs, roads, 
county boundaries, PLSS, etc.) that have also been collected. We will present data on spatial and temporal patterns of 
treatment distribution and methods.

Throughout the United States, the wildland-urban interface is expanding and many areas that were relatively isolated are 
becoming increasingly less so.  These factors contribute to the documented increase of human/ mountain lion encounters 
across the Western part of the country including Northern Arizona.  There are also many plans to restore forest 
 ecosystems in Arizona and there is little documentation on what effect that will have on mountain lion populations.  
Possible outcomes include increased mountain lion populations, more frequent sightings due to thinned forests, or 
mountain lion migration to canyon corridors and/or relatively remote forests with an increase in localized population 
density.  Each scenario increases the chance of human/ mountain lion conflict.  Therefore, in the summer of 2003 we 
surveyed, by mail, residents in the Arizona Ponderosa pine ecosystem on how they perceive nature and mountain lions to 
gain a better understanding of the kinds of conflict and issues that may emerge.  This survey will help devise useful 
management plans and reveal necessary information regarding the sociological aspect of mountain lion management.  
Results from our analysis and recommendations for future action will be presented.

We hypothesized that diffuse knapweed (Centaurea diffusa) germination and seedling growth respond positively to fire in 
ponderosa pine forests.  We are the first to address this hypothesis in pine forests of the Southwestern US.  With an 
increase in the size and number of high severity wildfires in the Southwest, we believe diffuse knapweed may increase 
leading to reduced forage and land values, and major ecosystem changes.  We used both controlled ex situ pot 
experiments and field comparisons. We obtained intact soil cores from two forest conditions, severely burned and 
unburned, from the Coconino National Forest, near Flagstaff, Arizona.  We planted knapweed seeds in pots with severely 
burned and unburned soil, and allowed native plant competitors to grow in half, and clipped competition in the other half.  
Preliminary measurements showed larger plants in both severely burned treatments, with the largest plants in the clipped 
competition treatment.  For the field experiment, we planted knapweed seeds in sealed nylon packets in four forest 
conditions: severely burned, moderately burned, unburned with litter removed, and unburned with litter intact.  Mean 
germination rate was highest (61.3%) under the severely burned condition than the other conditions: 44.4% in the 
unburned with litter intact, 45.2% in unburned with litter removed, and 49.3% in the moderately burned condition.  Overall, 
these preliminary results sugges t that severe fire may promote germination and seedling success of diffuse knapweed in 
northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests.

Large crown fires are increasing in number and size in the ponderosa pine forests of the Colorado Plateau.  Stand-
destroying crown fires were exceedingly rare in the pre-settlement era, and it is not clear what  the fate of these burned 
areas will be in the near term after recent fires.  We sampled the regenerational response of stand-destroying fires that 
burned in southwestern ponderosa pine forests during the 1940s, 50s, and 60s.   Preliminary research results indicate a 
variety of regenerational responses.  At s ome sites, ponderosa pine regeneration was robust.  At other sites, burned 
areas have been captured for some decades by other vegetational types, such as oak or grass, and ponderosa pine 
regeneration has been negligible thus far.

Fossil Creek is a stream in north-central Arizona that is fed by Fossil Springs.  Fossil Creek is a key tributary of the Verde 
River.  Flow from Fossil Springs is characterized by high concentrations of calcium carbonate – which leads to the 
formation of natural travertine dams in the creek.  Flow in the creek has been altered for almost 90 years, die to a 
hydropower facility (diversion dame, flime, power plants, channels, tunnels, etc.), which was constructred in the early 
1900’s and presently produces nearly 4.2 MW.  The facility manager has committed to decommissioning, beginning in 
early 2005, with a return of the full 43 cfs Fossil Springs base flow to Fossil Creek.  There are several major issues related 
to decommissioning and restoration in the watershed and stream corridor areas.  Of concern to many parties is the future 
of the Fossil Springs diversion dam, sited approximately 1000 ft downstream of Fossil Springs.  Additionally, due to the 
near complete siltation of the reservoir area between the dam and Fossil Springs, the Fossil Springs riparian ecosystem 
has expanded over the last 90 years to encompass a sediment wedge upstream from the dam.  Dam management 
scenarios have been identified that range from no action to complete removal.  The Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission, or FERC, as part of its preparation of an Environmental Assessment (EA), sought to identify the 
hydrological, hydraulic and sedimentation impacts related to these scenarios.  We considered a project reachg of 
approximately 0.25 miles – that portion of the Fossil Creek drainage in the immediate vicinity fo the Fossil Springs dam.  
As part of our study, we prepared hydrologic (HEC-1/HEC-HMS), hydraulic (HEC-6/HEC-RAS) and sediment transport 
(HEC-6) models to evaluate probable impacts of the different scenarios.  Though the results are approximate, we were 
able to develop forecasts of the system respone to return to base flow and to seasonally significant flows, as well as to 
infrequent high-magnitude storm flows.

Mountain lion management in Arizona is not based on sound scientific data nor are the environmental impacts of lion 
hunting understood or considered in the establishment of annual lion hunting orders adopted by the Arizona Game and 
Fish Commission. Data will be presented documenting deficiencies in the mountain lion management program 
administered by the Arizona Game and Fish Department. Though no western state has developed an enlightened or 
progressive lion management strategy, comparisons will be drawn between Arizona and other western states to further 
demonstrate inadequacies in Arizona's management approach. Furthermore, I will explore the root causes - political, 
organizational, legal, and economic - of the failings of the Commission and Department in their management of Arizona's 
lions from the perspective of an animal advocacy organization. Finally, solutions to improve wildlife, including lion, 
management will be offered which would, if implemented, provide all Arizonans an equal voice in wildlife management 
decision-making as contemplated by the public trust doctrine.

The annual invasive grass Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) now dominates nearly 2.9 million acres of BLM land in the Great 
Basin and threatens millions more. When present, cheatgrass promotes frequent fires, which increases cheatgrass 
dominance, leading to ever more extensive fires–a cheatgrass-wildfire cycle is born. Conversion of native rangelands to 
cheatgrass stands has resulted in lost biodiversity, increased erosion, reduced water infiltration, altered biogeochemical 
cycles, and, ominously, accelerated invasion of secondary perennial weeds that may ultimately be an even greater threat 
to native systems. The key to restoration of these lands is thought by many researchers to be in altering the competitive 
relationships between cheatgrass and desirable perennials during establishment. In particular, it is thought that reducing 
soil resources, especially nitrogen, may disproportionately affect annual weeds, reducing their impacts on perennial 
establishment. In this talk I will first give an review of the biological foundations of the strategy of nitrogen immobilization. I 
will then summarize some empirical results from our research group that suggests that temporary nutrient immobilization 
may be a valuable tool (though not a magic bullet) in restoration. Lastly I will present an overview of a large multi-
institution, multi-state project designed to address these (and other) issues Great Basin–wide.

Despite the fact that semiarid woodlands occupy a large proportion of the Colorado Plateau, very little is known about 
fundamental ecosystem processes in these woodlands, such as those involved with nitrogen (N) cycling.  We examined N 
pools and fluxes under pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) and one-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma) as well as in 
intercanopy spaces along a three-million-year soil chronosequence in northern Arizona.  We expected that N would 
accumulate in the soil with ecosystem development, differences in soil N content among the three canopy types would 
lessen with time, and the d15N signature of both soils and foliage would become more depleted with soil age.  Interspace 
total soil N increased roughly seven-fold from 24 g m-2 at the youngest site (1,000 y) to 184 g m-2 at the oldest site.  Total 
soil N was consistently higher under tree canopies than in the interspaces across the chronosequence, with the largest 
differences among canopy types at the youngest site.  Microbial biomass-N under pinyon and juniper canopies increased 
consistently from 5 to 25 g m-2 across the chronosequence, while interspace microbial biomass N increased from 2.5 to 
19 g m-2 at the second oldest site (750,000 y) and then declined to 16 g m-2 at the oldest site.  Contrary to our 
predictions, both total soil d15N and foliar d15N of the two dominant tree species became more enriched across the 
chronosequence, suggesting an increased rate of N loss with soil age.  Two potential pathways leading to enrichment of 
both soil and foliar d15N are: 1) increased rates of nitrate (NO3-) leaching with soil age, and 2) increased rates of 
denitrification with soil age.  This research provides some of the first information on ecosystem function Stephen C. Hart 
and ecosystem development in these widespread plant communities, and should aid in their management.

Sediments overlying Triassic rock exposed in back hoe trenches demonstrate erosional effects during the Holocene on a 
large prehistoric chert procurement site in the Canyonlands area northwest of Monticello, Utah.  Erosion and 
sedimentation linked to vegetation loss during historic time have produced dramatic changes in recent sediments, 
damaged surface artifact context, and adversely affected site integrity.  Erosion in mid-Holocene may also have removed 
surface horizons of Pleistocene soils.  Paleoenvironmental reconstructions based on pollen analysis from late Pleistocene 
and Holocene soils will help link these sediment distribution patterns to climate change and land use in the study area. 
 
 
NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IN THE HOMOGEOCENE - SISYPHUS ALL OVER AGAIN? 
 
SIMBERLOFF, DANIEL  
University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 
 
In an age when the earth's biota is being homogenized, there is a sense that, ultimately, it will be futile to try to prevent 
introduced species from dominating the landscape, because the forces arrayed against us  (trade, travel, and public 
apathy) are simply too great.  This pessimism is unwarranted.  Despite insufficient resources, technologies to deal with 
the problem have improved, and there are many success stories.  The larger problem is sociopolitical.  The public is 
increasingly aware that introduced species are a global phenomenon and not just a series of individual horror tales.  It is 
important to heighten this awareness and, in the political arena, to transform it into public policies that allow technology to 
succeed on a large enough scale.  The biggest single step towards this goal would be establishment of a federal entity 
whose sole purpose is to oversee and coordinate management of all introduced species.  However, even with an ideal 
policy framework and management structure, new introduced species will always arrive, establish, and require 
management.  In that sense, the task is Sisyphean.  Nevertheless, other management problems that require ongoing   
intervention are viewed as successful; introduced species management can fall in this category.  An analogy with public 
health is instructive.

The spread of pinyon pine and juniper trees in the past century has been well documented.  This increase in tree density 
has been attributed to many factors and has had a negative effect on understory species and erosion rates.  An 
Ecological Restoration Institute project at Mount Trumbull, Arizona is seeking to improve health in these ecosystems by 
thinning to a level consistent with pre-settlement (ca. 1870) pinyon-juniper ecosystems.  However, since pinyon and 
juniper trees often grow inconsistently and physical characteristics vary based on site conditions, it is difficult to 
differentiate between a pre-1870 and post-1870 tree.  Using data collected in the summer of 2002, I created a simple 
illustrated guide to distinguish five maturity classes of pinyon pine and Utah juniper trees.  In addition, I tested the 
applicability of these guidelines for differentiating age classes at two sites near Flagstaff, Arizona.

ECOLOGICAL DISCOURSE AND DEMOCRATIC PROCESS: TOWARDS A STRONGER SOCIAL CONTRACT FOR

The discipline of Conservation Biology emerged in the 1980’s from a scientific community concerned by rapid declines in 
the diversity of life on Earth.  In the past twenty years, conservation biologists have managed some impressive 
successes, but overall trends toward ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss have been little altered.  Meanwhile, 
environmental organizations and the concerned citizens that form them are increasingly vilified by public leaders, and the 
influence of the conservation community in public affairs has declined considerably.  In part, this is due to the increasing 
complexity of ecological understanding, which has placed conservation scientists at the margins of mainstream public 
debate about environmental issues.  The increasingly technical nature of ecological analysis and modeling has excluded 
the public from meaningful participation at the very time that scientific understanding is developing to a level capable of 
guiding public policy.  Regaining the salience of conservation in a pluralistic society facing ever more competition and 
conflict over increasingly scarce resources, such as water and energy, will require meaningful public discourse that is 
informed by our improving scientific understanding and increasingly powerful tools for analysis and visualization.  Drawing 
on several examples from the Colorado Plateau, I will explore possibilities for building a broader and therefore stronger 
coalition for conservation, via increased public participation in science and an elevated level of public discourse.  
Scientists have a critical role to play in this effort to build a new social contract for conservation, but success depends on 
our ability to work effectively with a diverse array of other engaged citizens.

The earliest archaeological investigations on the Colorado Plateau took place in southeastern Utah and other areas of the 
Four Corners region before the turn of the Twentieth Century.  The excavators approached their work with incite, avarice, 
and unlimited energy.  They mowed down archaeological sites like Dakota wheat.  A century later, the question remained: 
What, if anything, may be left of the remains of the Basketmakers, the foundational cultures of the Anasazi Tradition? This 
paper presents the results of ongoing archaeological research by the Colorado Plateau Agricultural Origins Project 
(CPAO) on the Colorado Plateau's earliest farmers, the Basketmaker II groups, which now appear to date as early as 
4,000 BP. For the past several years, CPAO has worked at a suite of classic rockshelters in the canyons of the Great 
Comb Ridge in southeastern Utah.  Archaeologists largely ignored this exceptional suite of rockshelters for nearly seven 
decades, because the sites were thought to have been thoroughly looted and "excavated" in the decades across the turn 
of the twentieth century. CPAO has developed a process for rapid assessment of the extent of archaeological looting and 
disturbance on fragile and rare rockshelter sites.  For these southeastern Utah rockshelters, the assessment news is both 
good (much more matrix remains in situ than most thought) and bad (most sites look like the aftermath of B-52 strikes).  
Trends in Basketmaker development revealed by CPAO research include much earlier onset of food production in the 
northern Southwest than previously thought, a clear developmental sequence for storage technology.

Previous study has documented the rarity of the northern leopard frog (Rana pipens) in the Glen Canyon – Grand Canyon 
region, with only one known population below Glen Canyon Dam, and historic localities for the species now inundated by 
Lake Powell.  The leopard frog population downstream from the dam has dwindled to very low numbers since it was 
initially discovered.  The marsh vegetation at the site has become very dense – possibly related to the operation of Glen 
Canyon Dam – and this may be an important factor in the decline of this leopard frog population.  Surveys at Glen Canyon 
National Recreation Area over the past 10 years have found leopard frogs at nine different side canyon locations off of 
Lake Powell, in addition to the population below the dam.  We describe the aquatic habitat at these sites, and provide a 
preliminary analysis of population fragmentation caused by the formation of Lake Powell.  The side canyons are 
effectively isolated, which raises concerns over the long-term persistence of these populations. 
 
 
ARCHAEOLGOICAL SURVEY OF NEW LAND ACQUIRED BY WALNUT CANYON NATIONAL MONUMENT,

Between October 2001 and May 2002, the Navajo Nation Archaeology Department completed an archaeological survey 
of approximately 1750 acres of land that were added to Walnut Canyon National Monument in 1996, as well as land 

 
70 
adjacent to the Monument entrance road. The primary purpose of the survey was to document all cultural resources in the 
new lands and road corridor, to allow park administrators to monitor impacts and implement preservation plans for the 
resources. A secondary goal was to compare site types and land use/settlement patterns in the new lands with those 
documented by a survey of the main Monument area in 1985. All cultural resources greater than 50 years old were fully 
recorded, and more recent cultural remains were briefly documented to monitor modern activity in the area. Our 
comprehensive survey documented high site densities, both within the canyon and on the rim north of the canyon. The 
project documented 210 sites that range in age from early Archaic to the mid twentieth century; 202 of these sites have 
one or more components related to Native American use of the area and 21 components derive from Anglo-American or 
other historic groups. Density and distribution of sites representing the Sinagua culture were similar to those documented 
by the previous survey, and two Sinagua Forts were fully documented in addition to numerous small field house sites. A 
major contribution of this project was the discovery of more than 15 sites that date to the Archaic period, a temporal 
interval poorly represented in the archaeological record for this area. Historic resources documented by the survey 
included the Santa Fe Dam, built within the canyon in a failed effort to control water, and numerous camps that may relate 
to logging or tourism.

Springs, seeps and natural ponds in arid regions like the southern Colorado Plateau are important as critical water and 
food resources, and as point sources of biodiversity and bioproductivity. Despite their significance, hydrology and biology 
of these natural water sources had not been systematically inventoried. We describe the ecological characteristics of 
more than 300 springs on and adjacent to the southern Colorado Plateau, including the Arizona Strip, the South Rim of 
Grand Canyon, the Mogollon Rim, and the San Francisco Peaks. Springs from 0-1800 meters elevation commonly have 
100- to 1000-fold higher productivity than the adjacent uplands, a pattern that is strongly nonlinear in its relationship with 
elevation. Plant and invertebrate diversity is commonly 2- to 10-fold higher and species density is 100- to 600-fold higher 
at springs for these taxa. Landsnail, butterfly and bird diversity is dramatically greater at springs. Rates of plant and 
landsnail endemism are also high at springs, particularly in paleorefugia.  Springs are isolated islands of habitat in a sea 
of arid lands, with steep ecological gradients between spring environments and surrounding lands. The intermediate 
disturbance hypothesis applies to edge environments at springs where many species live.  In the context of island 
biogeography the ‘source continents’ for these spring “islands” are ghost continents. Specifically, source areas for many 
springs were present in the Pleistocene, when the climate was less arid and species at springs were more widespread. 
Thus, today we see a high instance of spring-restricted species. As a result, springs are essential to these species’ 
continued survival. More than 90 percent of springs in low relief terrain have been modified by human activities, but 
additional inventory is needed in high relief terrain. Some species are restricted to certain geomorphic habitats at springs 
and are heavily impacted when these habitats are degraded. To assist managers in recovering impacted areas, we are 
generating a predictive model of spring vegetation based on the distribution of plants at protected springs in Grand 
Canyon National Park. During the surveys we found many new species records for northern Arizona in particular, and 
some new records for the State of Arizona. 
 
 
MOTH RESISTANCE NEGATIVELY AFFECTS SURVIVORSHIP OF PINYON PINE DURING RECORD LEVEL

Few studies have demonstrated a metabolic cost of resistance associated with the defense against herbivore attack.  We 
examined the cost of defense shown by mature Pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) to the keystone herbivore Dioryctria albovitella, 
a stem-and-cone boring moth, during a record level drought.  Trees in three populations were distinguished as moth 
resistant or moth susceptible based on architecture and the mortality status of each tree was classified along twenty 50M 
transects. We found that genetically moth resistant trees that have outperformed susceptible trees for over 20 years of 
study, have now suffered about 3 times greater mortality during the current drought.  Two strong patterns emerged. 1) 
Initially in the high mortality areas moth resistant trees dominated the stand 3 to 1 over moth susceptible trees. 2) During 
the 2002 drought 60% of resistant trees died, while only 20% of susceptible trees died resulting in a post mortality stand 
density of approximately 1 to 1. Further investigation reviled the cost of  resistance during extreme drought conditions may 
have both direct and indirect mechanisms facilitating high levels of mortality in the resistant trees. We found that moth 
resistance trees produced an average of 33% more resin than moth susceptible trees (direct).  Also, moth resistant trees 
support 4.5X more understory shrub vegetation than moth susceptible trees (indirect).  The results of this study suggest 
that under drought conditions resistance to a non-lethal herbivore can have negative consequences.  However, the results 
also suggest that the increased mortality of resistant trees may have a positive influence leading to the overall stability of 
the population through creation of a balanced polymorphism. Also discussed are possible community level implications.

In the summer of 2002 Northern Arizona experienced high plant mortality coinciding with a record drought.  We 
investigated the effects of this drought on the dominant plant species found along an elevational gradient in Northern 
Arizona.  Many predictions call for increased drought in the Southwest, which may cause large shifts in plant distributions.  
We investigated the hypothesis that the current drought was being expressed on the landscape through varying modes of 
mortality previously described in the literature.  The results of our study show: 1) dominant plants from diverse habitat 
types experienced significant mortality, indicating that the effects of drought were widespread, and 2) specific patterns of 
mortality differed among dominants consistent with environmental stress along an elevational gradient.  Although all of 
these dominant plants showed local patterns of high mortality approaching 100%, across the landscape some species 
were more susceptible to drought-induced mortality than others.  We predict that these differential patterns of mortality are 
extremely important, and that the degree of impacts of this drought on biodiversity will vary in their respected 
communities.  These results are important because, the communities in our study represent some of the largest 
vegetation types in the Western United States.  In the light of future predictions of global climate change, our study has far 
reaching implications on how these plant communities might be expected to respond across their respective ranges to 
increased drought intensity. 
 
 
POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS OF HOLOCENE CLIMATE VARATION FOR THE EXTENT, SEVERITY AND DURATION 
OF THE CURRENT DROUGHT

Arid and semi-arid ecosystems are highly sensitive to climate change.  The extensive die off by many species presently 
occurring across the Colorado Plateau and the Great Basin are evidence of this sensitivity.  The better our understanding 
of the relationships between Holocene climate change and associated vegetation dynamics, the better will be our 
understanding of not only present changes, but also future changes.  These relationships are illustrated with data 
available for the Great Basin, evidence demonstrating millennial-scale climate cycles operating over the Holocene.  Most 
prominent in the literature are climate cycles of 1450 to 1500 years with a variation of + 500 years.  Evidence for these 
cycles comes from many sources.  One of the most detailed of these is the information provided be the variation in the ice 
rafting of sorted terrestrial materials into the North Atlantic by ice bergs.  As paleoecological evidence accumulates for the 
Great Basin, and the resolution of patterns of vegetation and climate change improves, similar patterns of variation 
corresponding with more global level records like variation in ice rafting are becoming evident.  This evidence shows the 
occurrence of several major droughts that generally coincide with major periods of reduced ice rafting of debris into the 
North Atlantic.  This same ice rafting evidence appears to indicate that we are in the beginnings of a period of drought that 
represents a repeat of similar periods in the past.  Each of the droughts associated the previous periods of particularly low 
levels of ice rafting lasted from 300 to 700 years.  If the long-term drought cycle evident in the past is again repeating, the 
changes we are no observing are only the beginning with more to come.  More investigation is needed to document this 
possibility, but the potential seriousness of its implications seems to indicate the necessity.

As land managers and interested community members tackle the problems of invasive nonnative plant species on their 
lands of concern, the occurrence data generated must be organized, analyzed, and archived to support management 
activities. Inventory, monitoring, and even early detection/warning of invasive non-native species requires distribution 
data, along with information on the site of occurrence and treatments applied. The US Geological Survey and The Nature 
Conservancy (TNC) are collaborating on a project to develop a set of procedures and computer applications to enable 
Cooperative Weed Management Areas (CWMAs) to manage and share field-collected data. The project is built on the 
existing Southwest Exotic Plant Mapping Program (SWEMP) and is designed so that CWMA members can: 1) use 
standardized procedures and tools to manage and share invasive non-native plant data within the CWMA; 2) have access 
to maps of invasive non-native plant occurrences and associated biophysical, political, and land use data layers within the 
CWMA; and 3) contribute to the regional perspective of the distribution and magnitude of invasive non-native plant 
occurrences.  Two CWMAs in southwestern Arizona, King of Arizona and Borderlands, along with partners in Mexico, 
serve as the model area for the development, testing, and implementation of the procedures and computer tools. We are 

 
72 
modifying a database manager, initially developed by TNC in Oregon in cooperation with the Bureau of Land 
Management, for use by the CWMA members in the Southwest to receive field-collected data using the NAWMA data 
collection standards as core fields. The desktop data manager is integrated with a regional server that periodically 
compiles the individual member databases into a CWMA dataset. In addition, the contributions are added to the regional 
SWEMP dataset, w hich can be queried on the web. SWEMP also provides interactive maps of infestations in the 
Southwest on the web.

When John Muir visited this area in 1906 he found it rich in archeological sites and artifacts of previous cultures.  Petrified 
Forest National Monument was set aside later that year to preserve and protect both the cultural and natural heritage.  
Since that  time researchers and park staff have worked to unlock the stories of the many people who have called this 
home.  Early research concentrated on inventorying and dating site localities in the park.  Later efforts centered on 
recovery of information from damaged and eroding sites, petroglyph interpretation, and solar calendars.  Today park 
managers struggle with a variety of natural and human caused threats to these resources.    
 
 
LINKING SCIENCE TO DECISION MAKING: COLLABORATIVE APPROACHES AVOID COMMON PITFALLS  
 
TURNER, CHRISTINE1, Richard Zirbes 2 
1U.S. Geological Survey, MS 939, Denver Federal Center, Lakewood, CO 80225, cturner@usgs.gov ; 2U.S. Geological 
Survey, MS 516, Denver Federal Center, Lakewood, CO 80225, rjzirbes@usgs.gov   
 
The need for sound science in decision making is more urgent than ever, but there are many pitfalls to incorporating 
scientific knowledge into the decision making process.  All too commonly, scientists and technicians attempt to determine 
science requirements for decision support efforts without fully understanding the decision context and the specific needs 
of the resource manager.  Similarly, decision makers typically have difficulty expressing their management needs in 
scientif ic contexts.  The resulting gap between science user and science provider has led to frustration for both parties.  
The problem is that neither party can frame the appropriate science questions in isolation.  Taking a collaborative 
approach to framing the science questions for decision support efforts —in which scientists, technicians, and decision 
makers collectively define the science issues—can greatly improve the decision linkage and help to better frame the 
integrated science questions that must be addressed to enable decision making. Different ideas concerning the 
timeliness of scientific results also inhibit the incorporation of science into resource management plans.  Resource 
managers are often asked to incorporate science into their plans, but scientists are reluctant to commit to specific 
recommendations before conclusive studies have been made.  Adaptive management overcomes this barrier, if the 
scientist can be encouraged to share preliminary results, with the understanding (by all parties) that f ew, if any, scientific 
conclusions are without inherent uncertainty.   Adaptive management accommodates this uncertainty and allows for 
"course corrections" as new research modifies or refines the earlier conclusions.  If resource managers and scientists 
view science in a new way, the gap between decision making and science can be bridged.  Science often can not provide 
precise answers, but can be a definer of limits in ecosystems and can help to evaluate potential tradeoffs among possible 
plans of action.  For adaptive management to work successfully, we need to build capacity among resource managers 
and scientists to work in collaborative environments.  Governmental and academic institutions are recognizing this and 
are changing to accommodate this new way of managing resources.

Fire scars have been used extensively to understand the historical role of fire in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) 
ecosystems. However, the sampling methods and interpretation of fire scar data have been criticized as statistically 
invalid, biased, and leading to exaggerated fire frequency estimates (e.g., Johnson and Gutsell [1994], Baker and Ehle 
[2001]). We tested alternative sampling schemes by comparing “targeted” sampling, random sampling, and grid-based 
sampling to a comprehensive measurement and mapping of all fire-scarred trees in 1-km2 of Northern Arizona 
University’s Centennial Forest. We collected fire-scarred partial cross-sections from nearly 1,500 trees in 2002. Using 
sample sets stochastically generated from the comprehensive data, we are contrasting the effects of different sampling 
methods. Preliminary results suggest that “targeted” sampling did not result in the collection of the finest individual tree 
samples in the study area, but the composite fire history (fire frequency, variability, seasonality, and spatial extent) varies 
very little between sampling schemes. Quantification of the differences in sampling approaches will not resolve all the 
limitations of fire-scar methods, since scarred trees are inherently point-sources of data. But measurement of sampling 
uncertainty will reduce the scope of “uncertainty” in interpretation of fire regime statistics.

We examined foraging ecology of spring and fall migrant warblers in native and introduced vegetation habitat patches 
along the Lower Colorado River corridor.  Study areas were located on the Rio Hardy and Rio Colorado rivers in Sonora, 
Mexico, Cibola and Bill Williams National Wildlife Refuges in Arizona.  From our census and mist-net capture data, we 
found that warbler species' arrival and departure dates were more predictable during the spring migration period. Plant 
species abundance and phenology patterns dramatically influenced location of warbler foraging.  Preliminary analysis of 
foliage invertebrate samples revealed significant differences, among tree species and particularly between native and 
introduced plant species.  Hence, access to different tree species in a vegetation patch (e.g. mesquite, which had the 
highest invertebrate numbers in our fall samples) may be important to foraging migrants.  We found that warbler species 
partitioned foraging habitat in similar manners during both migration periods, preferring native over introduced vegetation.  
Lucys Warblers preferred the highest vegetation strata, while Yellow Warblers occurred primarily in the middle foliage 
regions.  Orange-crowned Warblers were observed most often in the lower third of the vertical vegetation strata, while 
Black-throated Grey, Wilson's, Nashville and MacGillivray's  Warblers all preferred the lowest vegetation strata.  We 
found a threshold of native plant species composition that appears to influence migrating warbler abundance within 
differing vegetation patches.  It thus appears that vegetation species, structure, phenology, abundance, and insect prey 
base all appear to play a role in structuring migrating warbler foraging patterns along the lower Colorado River corridor.

We examined the distribution of irrigated land, riparian vegetation, streams and drainages, mosquito vectors and bird 
distribution patterns throughout the State of Arizona.  We weighted each factor and then created a Geographic 
Information System (GIS) model that predicted a weighted risk of West Nile Virus occurring in that region of the state.  We 
further refined the model to examine the more susceptible corvid species throughout Arizona.  All GIS data layers were 
then combined with human population patterns throughout Arizona and regions of the state were assigned a risk potential 
ranging from one to five.  To further refine our model, we also examined foraging ecology of spring and fall migrant 
warblers in native and introduced vegetation habitat patches along the Lower Colorado River corridor, in an effort to 
predict future risks of West Nile Virus infections.  Study areas were located on the Rio Hardy and Rio Colorado rivers in 
Sonora, Mexico, Cibola and Bill Williams National Wildlife Refuges in Arizona.  From our census and mist-net capture 
data, we found that warbler species' arrival and departure dates differed among species, but were more predictable during 
the spring migration period. Plant species abundance and phenology patterns dramatically influenced location of warbler 
foraging.  Hence, vector access to different bird species in a vegetation patch may be important factor in future West Nile 
Virus transmission to foraging migrant birds in Arizona.  We found that warbler species partitioned foraging habitat in 
similar manners during both migration periods, preferring native over introduced vegetation, and thus potentially impacting 
WNV prevalences . Lucy's Warblers preferred the highest vegetation strata, while Yellow Warblers occurred primarily in 
the middle foliage regions.  Orange-crowned Warblers were observed most often in the lower third of the vertical 
vegetation strata, while Black-throated Grey, Wilson's, Nashville and MacGillivray's Warblers all preferred the lowest 
vegetation strata.  It thus appears that vegetation species, structure, phenology, abundance, and responses to insect prey 
base all appear to potentially play a role in determining micro-site influences on migrating warbler susceptibility to WNV 
infection along the lower Colorado River corridor.

The LANDFIRE project is a joint effort between USDA Forest Service and Department of the Interior for characterizing 
fuel conditions and fire regimes and for helping to evaluate fire hazard status.  Accurate mapping of regional patterns of 
vegetation type and structure are important to LANDFIRE, and the derived vegetation data layers are required for a 
variety of fuel and fire behavior modeling applications.  Within LANDFIRE, a pilot study is being conducted in central Utah 
(including the western portion of the Colorado Plateau) to determine the feas ibility of mapping western US vegetation 
communities at 30 m resolution by integrating satellite-derived imagery (three phenologically distinct dates), digital 
elevation model data, biophysical settings information, and field information.   Data from a total of 6180 field plots were 
made available for the pilot region from the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) and Utah State University.  In a 
preliminary analysis using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus data and digital elevation model data, an overall 

 
74 
accuracy of approximately 60% (stratified by land form) was achieved for mapping 28 forest and rangeland types using 
decision tree analysis.  While certain vegetation types proved problematic for mapping purposes, it was found that many 
of the dominant types of forest communities, such as pinyon-juniper and spruce-fir, can be mapped with reasonably high 
levels of accuracies.  Regional data sets of percent canopy density (sub-pixel density) of forest, shrub, and herbaceous 
cover (correlation coefficient of 89, 60, and 55% respectively), and average top canopy height of forest, shrub, and 
herbaceous cover (correlation  coefficient of 73, 50, 20% respectively) are also being developed. Further investigations 
are focusing on refining and improving the mapping process.  Following successful completion of vegetation mapping in 
the pilot area, plans are to develop a wall-to-wall coverage of existing vegetation types and structure variables throughout 
the western United States.  Thus, while the preliminary data sets  that are being developed only cover the western edge of 
the Colorado Plateau, plans are to develop comparable data sets across the entire region.  These data sets will be made 
available to all interested groups. 
 
 
ARIZONA BISON GENETICS ANALYSIS: VERIFYING ORIGINS

Recent issues concerning genetic purity of bison (Bison bison) in Arizona prompted investigations to determine if cattle 
genes were present with Arizona bison herds.  Hunter-harvested bison provided blood and tissue samples from herds 
managed by the Arizona Game and Fish Department.  Mitochondrial DNA haplotypes and 12 nuclear microsatellite loci 
were examined for 21 bison samples from the House Rock Valley (11) and Raymond Ranch (10) herds.  Twenty of the 21 
animals had domestic cattle mitochondrial DNA haplotypes and 8 of 21 animals had nuclear markers (3 markers of 12 
tested) consistent with those observed from cattle.  Although the number of bison in North America totals over 300,000, 
fewer than 10,000 animals comprise herds with no domestic cattle genetics.   Nevertheless, compared to other public and 
private hybrid bison herds, the high levels of detected cattle genes in these Arizona bison herds are striking.

We used s tochastic population modeling and Monte Carlo simulations to describe population responses to varying levels 
of fecundity and mortality based on published data from Arizona and other populations of turkeys.  Our modeling indicated 
that adult female turkey survival has the largest potential to affect turkey population levels in Arizona.  Improved adult 
female turkey survival has a greater effect than increased nesting by yearling female turkeys, but yearling female nest 
was the demographic parameter with the greatest potential for improvement in Arizona populations.  Even moderate 
levels of improvement in yearling nest rates results in substantial increases in simulated turkey populations.  Gender 
ratios skewed towards males in the population has the potential to negatively impact turkey populations.  Current harvest 
rates on all segments of the population do not suggest that Arizona's turkey populations are being overexploited.  To 
effect population increases, efforts to influence yearling female nesting propensity is likely to be most effective in 
increasing population growth.

Rare native fishes are often propagated at hatcheries and reared in ponds or fiberglass tanks for later stocking into 
streams with depleted populations.  Fish unaccustomed to moving water may experience increased stress, downstream 
displacement, or high predation mortality when released into lotic environments.  We compared the swimming 
performance of captive fish held in non-moving water, captive fish exercised in flowing water, and wild fish captured from 
a stream, to evaluate the effects of exercise conditioning and holding environment on swimming performance.  Swimming 
performance of flannelmouth sucker (Catostomus latipinnis), bonytail chub (Gila elegans ),  razorback sucker (Xyrauchen 
texanus), and spikedace (Meda fulgida) held in non-moving water increased by 10, 15, 26, and 40% respectively after 
exercise conditioning in flowing water (10 – 100 cm/s) for as little as 10 days.  Exercising fish reared in non-moving water 
may improve swimming performance and increase success of recovery programs for stream-dwelling fishes.

We are developing a National Vegetation Classification (NVC) alliance-level, digital inventory map of vegetation for the 
Colorado River ecosystem (CRE) in Arizona using a combination of computer classification and visual analysis of airborne 
multispectral imagery, ground verification, and GIS mapping and accuracy assessments.  The primary purpose of this 
project is to develop a GIS-based vegetation base map that (1) permits implementation of statistically sound, robust 
sampling for ground-based monitoring of terrestrial biologic resources within the CRE, and (2) provides a template for 
future, and possibly retrospective, change-detection studies of riparian-zone vegetation relative to operations of the Glen 
Canyon Dam and to climatic variables. A secondary objective is to produce a database that meets National Park Service 
and Federal Geographic Data Committee vegetation mapping standards, that will supplement associated mapping and 
monitoring programs that are being initiated by the Grand Canyon National Park and the Glen Canyon Recreational Area.  
Our approach in producing this vegetation map database consists of multiple, iterative phases of computer and visual 
classification, ground verification, classifier modification, and inventory revision, with map accuracies of 80%.  Progression 
through the mapping iterations will involve fewer and smaller areas within the CRE that do not yet meet out targeted map 
accuracy.  This mapping process is now at its halfway point incorporating revised training alliances and ground truth data.  
Factors adversely affecting classification accuracy include high-reflectance saturation in the near-infrared-band imagery, 
resulting in some confusion among a few vegetation species, and intrinsic spectral similarities in certain vegetation 
species at our visible and near-infrared wavelengths.  The latter factor is most evident in wetland species that have 
similarly high chlorophyll contents and that occur on saturated or partly inundated substrates.  If these issues cannot be 
resolved, mapping of some vegetation units may warrant a coarser scale (NVC) assignment (e.g., formation vs. alliance) 
in order to achieve national mapping standards.

Ecophysiological studies of plant water uptake on the Colorado Plateau have been restricted to short-term measurements 
of water–use for several days following pulse events, or occasional diurnal measurements through a growing season. 
While studies of this nature have proved extremely useful in understanding the differential short-term responses of 
species and life form groupings, they lack a longer-term temporal resolution of plant responses to drought and moisture 
pulses throughout an entire growing season. Sap-flow studies have the potential to provide continuous monitoring of 
whole plant responses to moisture pulses throughout the year, as well as scaling fluxes to the canopy -scale. Here we 
present preliminary results from a sap-flow study of Pinyon Pine (Pinus edulis) and Utah Juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) 
conducted near Canyonlands National Park, Utah. Using Granier-type heat dissipation probes, sap flux was measured 
continuously from May 2003. Sap flux showed a pronounced seasonal pattern with the highest rates early in the growing 
season declining to very low rates as the soil dried. Typically J. osteosperma exhibited lower sap flux  than P. edulis. In 
addition, J. osteosperma appeared to be less responsive to summer precipitation events than P. edulis. This study forms 
part of a larger effort at the University of Utah to understand plant responses to moisture and precipitation pulses in arid 
land ecosystems.

Wildlife-habitat relationship models are employed routinely in guiding land management decisions.  Understanding and 
identifying potential sources of error is imperative to providing managers with the highest quality models.  We developed 
an evaluative criteria to 1) identify potential sources of error in model datasets, and 2) select the best habitat models.  
Using a competing models framework, we modeled habitat using classification tree and logistic regression models for 
eight songbird species on the Pinaleños Mountains, southeastern Arizona.  A three-year dataset (1993-1995) of bird 
survey points, habitat information derived from literature, and landscape-scale variables were used to develop models.  
Models were verified using a one-year dataset (2002) of bird survey points.  GIS information were considered of the 
highest quality with the best elevation model (for deriving elevation, slope and aspect), vegetation land cover (overall 
accuracy = 71.2%), and maps of springs and streams used.  Sample sizes in the model-building dataset were considered 
small (= 30 samples for presence and absence) and verification data were collected during the 2002 drought.  Although 
none of the species’ models attained 80% accuracy, most yielded overall accuracy values better than chance and were 
comparable to other studies using similar habitat variables.  Low predictive success of these models was probably due to 
a combination of inappropriate study design, small sample size, environmental stochasticity in the verification dataset, and 
lack of fine-scale GIS information.  Although use of these models in guiding management decisions is considered limited,

the criteria developed provides a systematic framework for evaluating data quality for modeling wildlife-habitat 
relationships.  We recommend using a method, which includes elements identified here, f or evaluating model datasets for 
the potential errors and to potentially reduce error propagation.  This approach will ultimately provide land managers with 
higher quality wildlife-habitat relationship models.

The Gap Analysis Program (GAP) is an ambitious nationwide effort to evaluate the conservation status of plant 
communities and vertebrate species.  Vegetation land cover, vertebrate-habitat distributions, and land stewardship are 
mapped to conduct the GAP analysis.  In the southwest, state projects in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada and 
Utah are collaborating to conduct a second generation GAP analysis, which will cover the entire region.  For modeling 
vertebrate-habitat distributions, each state group is responsible for identifying potential habitat correlates for all vertebrate 
species known to breed or winter predominantly within a given state.  Landscape-scale variables used in developing 
vertebrate-habitat distribution models include vegetation land cover, elevation, aspect, slope, distance to water and 
distance to anthropogenic areas.  Within Arizona, predicted habitat variables for vertebrate species are via an exhaustive 
literature review of peer-reviewed journal articles, Ph.D. dissertation and M.S. thesis research, government documents, 
natural history accounts, and species’ checklists.  We present an evaluation of the types of information used to identify 
habitat variables for the 68 bird species assigned to the Arizona group.  Vertebrate-habitat distribution models are based 
primarily upon qualitative information, and are developed at the landscape-scale.  GAP models will synthesize available 
habitat information for vertebrate species, provide baseline species -habitat distribution maps, and illuminate areas of 
future research on species’ habitat requirements.  For GAP vertebrate-habitat distribution models to be usef ul in a 
conservation or management context, end-users must recognize the scale and scope of these models, as well as the 
weaknesses and strengths of the GAP approach.

Maps of forest structural parameters in multiple scales are spatial data foundations for landscape analysis of forest 
ecosystem aimed to aid the decision-making in forest management.  Remote sensing imagery and a variety of ground 
measurements are the major data sources available for construction of the maps.  Using existing ground datasets from 
multiple sources and remote sensed imagery with multiple spatial resolutions, ForestERA research team has mapped 4 
million acre tree composition, total basal area, tree density and canopy cover over the ponderosa-dominated area in 
northern Arizona (10 to 90 meters spatial resolutions).  This poster presents the resultant maps and techniques that have 
been used to build these structural layers. Two practical data analysis techniques “using ground plot measurements in 
varying-sized groups for accuracy assessment” and “deriving regional forest structural layers from DOQ ” will be focuses 
of this poster.  These two methods are developed in this research project particularly for constructing forest structural 
maps to fit the requirement of landscape ecological analysis when numbers of ground samplers are insufficient, or 
distribution of ground data are poor for the purpose of spatial modeling.

Recent increases in tree mortality following the bark beetle epidemic of 2002 in northern Arizona have raised concerns 
about future outbreaks and effects of forest management on tree resistance to bark beetles.  We hypothesize greater 
susceptibility of trees to bark beetle attack in unmanaged compared with managed forest stands.  We collected data 
during summer of 2003 to compare water stress and oleoresin production of ponderosa pines among three forest 
conditions in the Coconino National Forest near Flagstaff, AZ that represent different levels of operational forest 
management.  The three forest conditions are: unmanaged (no thinning or prescribed burning), thinned, and thinned + 
prescribed burned (n = 4 stands per condition).  We measured predawn leaf xylem water potential during the dry season 
on ten trees in each replication of the three forest conditions.  Unmanaged stands had significantly more negative 
predawn water potential than thinned and thinned + burned stands, indicating greater water stress in the unmanaged 
stands.  Prescribed burning had no apparent effect on predawn water potential in the thinned stands.  No significant 
differences occurred among forest conditions for tree resin flow in July.  Flights of pine engraver beetles (Ips pini ) and 

 
77 
western pine beetles (Dendroctonus brevicomis) occurred throughout June and July in 2003 and preliminary evidence 
suggests greater abundance of western pine beetles in unmanaged stands.   Measurements of tree survival following 
mass attack by western pine beetle induced by pheromone baits and relationships between local-scale tree-to-tree 
competition and tree water stress and resin flow are underway. 
 
 
OBSIDIAN SOURCING AND HYDRATION: WHO BROKE THE GLASS ON THE STAIRCASE?

Obsidian is not a common lithic material type within the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument or the surrounding 
area.  Obsidian is usually found at only a small percentage of the sites within this area, and then it is usually restricted to a 
flake or two per site.  Local cryptocrystallines and quartzites are the predominant lithic materials used for tool production.  
This study was initiated as a result of sourcing questions; did the obsidian found at what were apparently Formative sites 
come from sources south of the Colorado River, and did the obsidian found at what appeared to be late prehistoric 
(Paiute) sites come from the Great Basin?  As the study progressed, obsidian hydration was utilized as a dating technique 
that would help, in conjunction with the source analysis, to assign affiliation to certain archaeological sites.  The results 
may indicate that most obsidian found in area sites is an indicator of Late Prehistoric peoples.  This research will also help 
to distinguish multiple components at sites that may at first appear to be cohesive, single component sites.  Besides 
helping to answer a variety of archaeological questions, this research has management implications as well.  Land 
Managers need to know what kinds of resources are present on the lands they administer, and determination of site age, 
affiliation, and complexity will add to this knowledge base.  Such knowledge will also aid consultation with interested 
Native American groups.  And, as interpretation becomes more of a focal point for land management agencies, this 
information can be used to present a more complete picture of past life ways and land use practices.
