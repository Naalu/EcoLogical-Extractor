ABSTRACT 
 
 
Ponderosa pine forests in the Mt. Logan Wilderness on the Arizona Strip have become 
dense with young trees and highly susceptible to catastrophic wildfire due to exclusion of the natural 
frequent-fire regime and the effects of livestock grazing and logging associated with Euro-American 
land use practices.  As part of a broader regional ecological restoration study, the Mt. Logan 
Wilderness was sampled for fire scarred trees, vegetation, and fuels between 1995 and 1997.  
Reconstructed fire histories show that fires recurred about every 5-6 years prior to settlement, with 
larger fires burning every 9-12  years.  Frequent fires ceased after 1869-1879 in the Mt. Logan 
Wilderness, coincident with the time of Euro-American settlement, beginning a fire-free period that 
has lasted up to the present except for a few fires in the 1930’s.  Current forests are dense, ranging 
from approximately 700 to 3,000 trees/ha, and dominated by small trees.  At both unthinned and 
thinned sites on basalt soils within the wilderness, tree canopy cover is over 50% and tree basal area 
is high, 39-40 m2/ha.  Understory cover and species diversity are generally low, but slightly higher on 
cinder soils where shrubs form an important understory community and where tree density is 
somewhat reduced.  Living and dead fuels, including plants, woody debris, and the forest floor , will 
easily support high-intensity wildfires.  In contrast, the presettlement forest was relatively open, with 
tree densities ranging from approximately 80-100 trees/ha and basal areas ranging from 10-15 m2/ha, 
dominated by large ponderosa pine trees.  In ecological terms, prospects are good for restoring the 
Mt. Logan Wilderness to emulate the ecological structure and fire disturbance regime of the 
presettlement reference condition.  The current forest is similar to nearby ecosystems where 
thinning, burning, and fuel treatments are being implemented.  However, ecological information is 
only one component contributing to the debate over appropriate management values and practices in 
wilderness areas on public lands. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Over the last century, western ponderosa pine forests have undergone deleterious changes 
due to human-initiated disruption of the natural structural and disturbance patterns under which 
these ecosystems evolved.  Land use practices introduced by Euro-American settlers, including heavy 
livestock grazing, harvesting of old trees, and suppression of surface fires, have led to dense forests 
composed primarily of small, young trees, with greatly reduced herbaceous and shrub productivity.  
Many ponderosa pine forests are not sustainable in their degraded current conditions:  densely 
growing trees are increasingly susceptible to infestation by insect and disease pathogens and deep 
forest floors and extensive horizontal and vertical continuity of fuels now support stand-replacing 
wildfires (Cooper 1960, Covington et al. 1994, Kolb et al. 1994). 
The effort to restore ecosystem health in southwestern forests is a multidisciplinary endeavor 
aimed at averting catastrophic ecological change and restoring ecosystem conditions characteristic of 
the evolutionary environment (Covington et al. 1995).  The Mt. Trumbull Resource Conservation 
Area, managed by the Bureau of Land Management, is the largest operational restoration site in the 
Southwest.  In cooperation with Northern Arizona University (NAU) and the Arizona Game and 
Fish Department, the Arizona Strip District of the BLM has undertaken adaptive ecosystem

restoration of southwestern ponderosa pine ecosystems to their pre Euro-American settlement 
conditions:  open forest stands dominated by large, old trees above a rich, diverse understory of 
native grasses and wildflowers, maintained by frequent, low-intensity fires.  Beginning in 1995, 
researchers with the NAU Ecological Restoration Program have established a broad series of studies 
to measure and monitor ecological conditions within the Mt. Trumbull project area.   
The Mt. Logan and Mt. Trumbull wilderness areas are the southern and northern borders, 
respectively, of the restoration project area.  Although these wilderness areas are presently managed 
primarily for their natural qualities and wilderness character, forests within their boundaries have 
been affected by the past land use practices.  While ecological restoration practices may be 
particularly valuable to recover natural values in wilderness and park lands, wilderness management 
regulations and philosophy often appear incompatible with active restorative work.  Within the 
broader Mt. Trumbull restoration project, several lines of research are addressing the role of 
ecological restoration in wilderness.  First, the current and presettlement conditions of ecosystem 
structure and fire disturbance regime have been measured.  This report documents these conditions 
for the ponderosa forest areas of the Mt. Logan Wilderness.  Second, social perceptions of Mt. Logan 
Wilderness restoration are being assessed in a local survey (M. DeMillion, M. Lee, and W.W. 
Covington, personal communication, 1998).  Finally, potential restoration treatments which may be 
suitable for wilderness are being tested in nearby areas (A. Kaufmann and W.W. Covington, personal 
communication, 1998). 
 
 
METHODS 
STUDY AREA 
The Mt. Logan Wilderness is located in the Uinkaret Mountains on the Arizona Strip, north 
of the Colorado River and west of the Kaibab Plateau (latitude 36°20’N, longitude 113°12’W).  The 
study area, comprising the ponderosa pine forest in the northern and northeastern edge of the 
wilderness, is shown in Figure 1.  Mt. Logan is the highest peak (2,398 m).  Other prominent peaks 
are Petty Knoll (2,295 m) and Slide Mountain (2,307 m).  The lowest elevation in the forested study 
area was 2079 m.  Soils are derived from volcanic substrates; soils are described under “Analysis 
Areas” below.  Annual precipitation at Mt. Trumbull (elevation 2,448 m, approximately 6.8 km NE 
of Mt. Logan) averaged 50.59 cm between 1977 and 1997; precipitation averaged slightly less, 48.21 
cm/year, between 1975 and 1997 at Nixon Spring (elevation 1,982 m, approximately 6 km NE of Mt. 
Logan).  Most precipitation occurs in winter and during the summer monsoon; spring and fall are 
relatively dry.  Vegetation communities in the study area include ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)--
Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) forest.  Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) and pinyon (Pinus edulis) 
occur sporadically within the pine-oak forest; these species dominate the south-facing slopes.  New 
Mexican locust (Robinia neomexicana) and a number of shrub species are also interspersed in the pine-
oak forest, especially on cinder soils.  Scientific names and authors of all species are listed in 
Appendix A.  English-metric conversions are given in Appendix B. 
 
Prehistory and history of the Arizona Strip, including the study area, are reviewed in Altschul and 
Fairley (1989).   Although much of the Arizona Strip has had only limited archeological survey, 
evidence of Native American presence dates back to the early Archaic period (beginning 
approximately 8000 years Before Present [B.P.]).  The Strip was populated throughout the Formative 
period (approximately 1800 B.P. through 1250 A.D.);the later portion (Pueblo II period, 1000-1150 
A.D.) was characterized by the construction of large, multiroom pueblos, extensive agriculture

including corn and lowland cotton cultivation, and broad trade networks.  Upland areas, 
such as the study area, may have been utilized primarily in the warm season.  However, much of the 
Mt. Trumbull region may have been low enough in elevation for year-round occupancy (Altschul and 
Fairley 1989:136).  Most sites on the Arizona Strip were abandoned in the thirteeenth century.  A

number of possible reasons, ranging from environmental to social factors, have been suggested to 
explain the change in settlement patterns.  Southern Paiutes were present on the Arizona Strip at 
least by 1285 A.D. and possibly earlier (Altschul and Fairley 1989:144,147).  Ethnographic studies of 
land use practices by Southern Paiute bands suggest that upland areas were occupied primarily in 
summer and fall for hunting and gathering of pinyon seeds, berries, and other resources, together 
with limited seasonal cultivation of corn and squash; “intimate knowledge of plant resources” 
permitted successful planning of harvest schedules and sites (Altschul and Fairley 1989:149).   
The first Europeans on the Arizona Strip were the Spanish members of the Domínguez-
Escalante expedition seeking a route to California in 1776 (Altshul and Fairley 1989).  The Strip 
remained unpopulated by Euro-Americans until the 1850’s, except for other brief traverses by 
Spanish, Mexican, and American travelers.  However, Southern Paiute bands were affected as early as 
the beginning of the nineteenth century by European diseases and raiding by other Native American 
and Euro-American groups.  Euro-American settlers, members of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints (Mormons), arrived in southern Utah in 1854 and began to explore the Arizona 
Strip region.  Permanent Euro-American settlements on the Strip were first established in 1862 
(Short Creek) and 1863 (Pipe Springs).  However, hostility between the Mormons and a Paiute-
Navajo alliance kept Euro-American influences away from the Mt. Trumbull region until the conflict 
was resolved in 1870 (Altshul and Fairley 1989).  Meanwhile, expeditions led by Major John Wesley 
Powell in 1869 and 1871 were instrumental in bringing the Grand Canyon region to the attention of 
the American public for the first time (Stegner 1954). 
Euro-American settlement of much of the Arizona Strip, including Mt. Trumbull, began in 
1870.  Several ranches were established around Mt. Logan at Oak Spring and Whitmore [Big] Spring 
by 1872 (Altschul and Fairley 1989:187).  Much of the Strip was overgrazed in the 1870’s, a dry 
period, leading to severe degradation of grasslands (Altschul and Fairley 1989:192).  To provide 
timber for construction of a Mormon temple in St. George, Utah, timber harvesting began in the Mt. 
Trumbull forests around 1872.  Sawmills were erected in 1872 and the “Temple Trail” to St. George 
was built in 1874 (Altschul and Fairley 1989).  A sawmill was built north of Mt. Logan in 1890 (BLM 
1990:3) and commercial logging continued in the Mt. Trumbull region until the mid-twentieth 
century.  The Mt. Trumbull forest was included in the Dixie (later Kaibab) Forest Reserve, although 
many lands were released for homesteading after 1916.  In 1974, the Forest Service lands in the Mt. 
Trumbull region were transferred to the Bureau of Land Management (Public Land Order 5413) and 
a thinning treatment was initiated by the BLM on Mt. Logan.  Mt. Logan and Mt. Trumbull were 
designated wilderness areas under the Arizona Wilderness Act on August 28, 1984 (BLM 1990:4). 
Current management of the Mt. Logan Wilderness follows the 1964 Wilderness Act 
guidelines to maintain “a natural ecological landscape essentially free from man-induced contrast” 
(BLM 1990:5).  Regulations include prohibitions on natural resource extraction (except for hunting 
and allotted livestock grazing) and require a minimum-tool management approach (BLM 1990).  
Prescribed fire has been applied since 1994 to reduce unnaturally hazardous fuel loads. 
 
ANALYSIS AREAS 
A total of 34 plots, covering approximately 310 ha, was established in the ponderosa pine 
forest of the Mt. Logan Wilderness between 1995 and 1997 (Figure 1).  The forest covers two main 
soil types: (1) the basalt-derived soils of the Mt. Logan rim and (2) the cinder soils of Petty Knoll and 
Slide Mountain.  Complete soil survey information is not available (Soil Conservation Service 1974), 
but the wilderness management plan authors (BLM 1990) inferred from incomplete data that the 
basalt soils were probably Siesta very cobbly clay loam and the cinder soils were probably Wukoki 

MOUNT LOGAN FOREST 
6 
Variant--Lomaki Cold Variant complex.  Plots on the two soil types, 23 on basalt soils and 11 on 
cinders, were analyzed separately.  Within the basalt soil type, over 100 ha were heavily thinned 
around 1974 (BLM 1990).  The 12 thinned plots and the 11 unthinned plots were analyzed 
separately.  Representative scenes from the analysis areas are shown in Appendix C. 
 
Throughout the analysis, comparisons were drawn between (1) soil types (cinder soils vs. 
basalt [unthinned] soils); and (2) past management history (thinned vs. unthinned, basalt soils only).  
These categories and the plot numbers in each are summarized in Table 1. 
 
The data for the Mt. Logan Wilderness have been summarized and presented here to 
support other research projects related to wilderness restoration issues, as described above.  
However, sample sizes for the Mt. Logan Wilderness analysis are low, probably contributing to 
relatively high variability and some anomalous results (e.g., see the discussion of stumps in the 
diameter distribution results below).

FIRE SCAR SAMPLING 
FIELD METHODS  
 
Partial cross-sections of catfaces (fire-scarred injuries on the lower boles of trees) were 
collected from living trees, snags, and downed logs across the study sites.  Each site was thoroughly 
checked for fire scars and the trees which appeared to record the oldest and/or greatest number of 
fires were selected for sampling.   

MOUNT LOGAN FOREST

LABORATORY METHODS 
 
 
Fire-scarred samples were mounted, surfaced, and crossdated (Stokes and Smiley 1968).  All 
dates were independently checked by another dendrochronologist.  Ring widths of all samples were 
also measured and dating was checked with the COFECHA program (Grissino-Mayer and Holmes 
1993).  Some samples collected from dead trees could not be initially crossdated.  These samples 
were measured as floating chronologies and dated with the assistance of COFECHA output; dates 
were then confirmed visually on the samples.   
 
Fire scars were dated to the year and season of occurrence depending on the position of the 
fire lesion within the annual ring.  Seasonal categories were assigned following the procedure of 
Baisan and Swetnam (1990): EE (early earlywood), ME (middle earlywood), LE (late earlywood), L 
(latewood), and D (dormant).  Dormant scars are generally considered to represent early season fires 
in the Southwest. Phenological data exist for ponderosa pine in southern Arizona, permitting 
calendar dates to be assigned to these within-ring positions (Baisan and Swetnam 1990).  Because we 
do not have this information for the Mt. Trumbull region, fires were divided only into “spring” (D + 
EE) and “summer” (ME + LE + L) groups.  
 
Fire history data were analyzed with the FHX2 software (Grissino-Mayer 1995).  Analysis at 
each site began with the first year with an adequate sample depth (Grissino-Mayer et al. 1994), 
defined as the first fire year with at least three recording trees at each site.  “Recording” trees are 
those with open fire scars or other injuries (e.g., lightning scars, bark peels), leaving them susceptible 
to repeated scarring by fire (Swetnam and Baisan 1996).   The disruption of the presettlement fire 
regime, identified by the cessation of frequent fires, was evident at all sites.  A number of 
postsettlement fires were also recorded, however.   Fire return intervals were analyzed statistically in 
two different sub-categories.  First, all fire years, even those represented by a single scar, were 
considered.  Second, only those fire years were included in which 25% or more of the recording 
samples were scarred.  The 25%-scarred category reflects ‘widespread’ fires which were probably 
larger in area and possibly more intense (Grissino-Mayer 1995).  An intermediate 10%-scarred 
category was not included because the sample sizes were not >> 10 per site.  The statistical analysis 
of fire return intervals includes several measures of central tendency:  the mean fire interval (MFI, 
average number of years between fires), the median, and the Weibull median probability interval 
(WMPI).  The latter statistic is a central measure in the Weibull distribution, used to model 
asymmetric fire interval distributions and to express fire return intervals in probabilistic terms 
(Grissino-Mayer et al. 1994, Swetnam and Baisan 1996).  Since fire return intervals are rarely 
normally distributed, the WMPI is preferred over the MFI, although the values are often numerically 
similar.  
 
Temporal homogeneity in fire return intervals and percentage of scarring was examined by 
dividing the fire record prior to recent fire exclusion in half at each study site. There was no evidence 
of changing climate (D’Arrigo and Jacoby 1991, Meko et al. 1995) or other ecological factor in the 
pre-exclusion period which would provide an alternative date for testing temporal change.  The all-
scar, 10%-scar, and 25%-scar distributions in these temporally distinct periods were tested for 
significantly different means (t-test), variances (F-test), and distributions (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).  
Alpha level for all tests was 0.05.  In addition, the spatial homogeneity of fires in adjacent study sites 
was investigated by testing the synchroneity of fire years (chi-square test, 2 X 2 and 2 X 1 
contingency tables [Grissino-Mayer 1995]). Additional information on fire research procedures is 
presented by Swetnam and Baisan (1996) and Grissino-Mayer (1995).

ECOSYSTEM MEASUREMENT AND MONITORING PLOTS 
FIELD METHODS 
Permanent plots were used to measure current conditions of vegetation and fuels, and to 
collect dendroecological data for reconstruction of past forest structure.  A plot design adapted from 
the National Park Service’s Fire Monitoring protocol (NPS 1992, Reeberg 1995) was selected for 
consistent data collection across the Mt. Trumbull project area as well as at related sites.  The plot 
design was chosen for the following reasons:  (1) integrated and comprehensive plot design 
incorporating well-established measurement procedures for overstory and understory vegetation, 
forest floor and woody debris, and photo documentation; (2) the large plot size (0.1 ha) is 
appropriate for capturing presettlement tree groups in southwestern ponderosa pine (White 1985); 
(3) suitability of the plot system for future re-measurements in ongoing monitoring of treatment and 
control areas; (4) support for the protocol within the Interior Department land management 
agencies, including training (e.g., RX-80 “Preburn inventory techniques” course) and software.  
Adaptations to the Fire Monitoring protocol are noted below. 
 
Plot origins were located from a systematic 300 meter grid placed over the sampling site 
(Figure 1).  This procedure is different from the random sampling specified in the NPS (1992) 
guidelines.  Gridpoints were located in the field by pace and compass (plots 1 and 2) or by taping and 
compass (all other plots) from mapped reference points, such as road junctions or section corners.  
Every gridpoint that fell within the suitable ponderosa pine forest type was used as a plot origin.  
When a gridpoint fell in an unsuitable location (e.g., road, meadow, or archeological site), the points 
50 m N, E, W, and S were checked for suitability.  If none were acceptable, the gridpoint was 
discarded.  Suitable forest type (equivalent to the NPS [1992] “monitoring type”) was defined as at 
least 10% ponderosa pine forest cover in 1870 based on the presence of presettlement-era trees, 
snags, stumps, or logs.  In mixed species stands, ponderosa pine must have been a dominant tree in 
the stand with old individuals (or remnants) present.  This intentionally broad definition included 
ponderosa pine types ranging from the pinyon-juniper interface to mixed conifer forests.   
 
 Plots were 50 X 20 m (0.1ha) with permanent markers to serve as a long-term monitoring 
unit.  Rebar stakes and rock cairns marked the center (origin) and the four outer corners to ensure 
identical setup in subsequent surveys.  Plots were oriented with the 50 m sides parallel to the slope 
azimuth (i.e., uphill-downhill) to maximize sampling of variability along the elevational gradient and 
to permit correction of the plot area for slope. 
 
Plots were divided into four quadrants   All trees greater than 15 cm diameter at breast 
height (dbh) were measured on the entire plot (1000 m2).   Trees between 2.5-15 cm dbh  were 
measured on quadrant one (250 m2).  Each tree over 2.5 cm dbh was tagged with an aluminum label 
at breast height and the following data was recorded: diameter at breast height, crown code 
(dominant, co-dominant, intermediate or sub-canopy), damage, and condition class (1. live; 2. 
declining; 3. recent snag; 4. loose bark snag; 5. clean snag; 6. snag broken above breast height; 7. snag 
broken below breast height; 8. downed dead tree; and 9. cut stump).  The condition class categories 
were derived from snag decomposition studies (Maser et al. 1979, Thomas et al. 1979) and were an 
expansion upon the “live/dead” categories in the NPS (1992) protocol.  All living and dead trees 
potentially old and/or large enough to have become established prior to Euro-American settlement 
(circa 1870) were identified as potentially presettlement trees in the field.  Ponderosa pines with dbh 
> 37.5 cm or ponderosa of any size with yellowed bark (White 1985), as well as all oaks, junipers, and 
pinyon trees > 17 cm (Barger and Ffolliott 1972) were considered potentially presettlement trees.  All 
living potentially presettlement trees and 10% of all post-settlement live trees were cored for

determination of age and past size.  The presettlement identification and coring procedures were 
additions to the NPS (1992) protocol. 
Seedling trees, those below 2.5 cm dbh, were tallied by species, condition, and height class in 
a 10 X 5 m area of quadrant one.  Species, condition and height codes (1. < 15 cm; 2. 15.1-30; 3. 
30.1-60; 4. 60.1-100; 5. 100.1 cm-2 m; 6. 2.001-3; 7. 3.001-4; 8. 4.001-5; 9. 5.001-6; 10. 6.001-7; 11. 
7.001-8; 12. 8.001-9; and 13. 9.001+ m) were recorded for each seedling.   
Herbaceous plants and brush were measured along two 50-m point intercept transects along 
the outer 50 m sides of each plot.  Species, species height and substrate (e.g., soil, litter, rock) were 
recorded every 30 cm, for a total of 166 points per transect and 332 points per plot.  A 5-m swath 
around each transect was surveyed after the point intercept measurements to note additional species 
not encountered on the transects.  If the plot was located in a brushy area (e.g., sagebrush), a belt 
transect was created by widening the herbaceous transect to 1 m and tallying all shrubs, living and 
dead, by maturity state (seedling, resprout, mature). 
Canopy cover measured by vertical projection was recorded at each of the 332 point 
intercept locations along the herbaceous transects.  The measurement of canopy cover was an 
addition to the NPS (1992) protocol.  Forest floor and woody debris were measured along four 50-ft. 
planar intersect transects (Brown 1974) originating in random directions every 10 m.  Woody debris 
was recorded by size/timelag classes:  1, 10, 100, and 1000-hour (sound and rotten) fuels.  Litter and 
duff were measured every five feet along each transect.  Eight photopoints were established at each 
plot from the corners and quarter-corners.  A board showing the plot number and photo position 
was included in each photograph.  Finally, at each plot a reference presettlement tree was  tagged 
near ground level with the distance and bearing to the plot origin in case the rebar markers were lost 
or difficult to find after time. 
LABORATORY METHODS 
 
Plot areas were corrected for slope.  Sample collections of plants were brought back to 
NAU, unknown species were identified, and representatives of all species were mounted on 
herbarium sheets and prepared for storage.  Mounted specimens were provided to the BLM AZ Strip 
District and to the NAU Deaver Herbarium.  Tree increment cores were surfaced and crossdated 
(Stokes and Smiley 1968) with local tree-ring chronologies.  Rings were counted on cores which 
could not be crossdated, especially younger trees.  Additional years to the center were estimated with 
a pith locator (concentric circles matched to the curvature and density of the inner rings) for cores 
which missed the pith.  Fuels loadings were calculated from the planar transect data using methods in 
Brown (1974) and constants from Sackett (1980). 
Presettlement forest structure was reconstructed in 1870, the year in which Euro-American 
land use practices were introduced to the Mt. Logan area and an approximate date for the cessation 
of frequent, low-intensity fires in the region (range 1869-1879, see below and P.Z. Fulé and others, 
unpublished data).  Reconstruction of forest structure at an earlier date would have presented greater 
uncertainty because the frequent fires during this era probably consumed much rotten woody 
material.  
 
The field determination of presettlement or postsettlement tree status was confirmed or 
rejected using the age data.  For each cored presettlement tree, the radial growth increment from 
1870 to collection date was measured on the core and the exclusion year diameter calculated.   
Species-specific equations developed by Myers (1963) and Hann (1976) in the Southwest were used 
to estimate bark thickness and to predict dbh based on the inside-bark diameter of stumps.  Site-

MOUNT LOGAN FOREST 
10 
specific regressions were developed from the data set to predict diameter at breast height (dbh) from 
diameter at stump height (dsh, coring height) for all species.   
 
The year of death of presettlement snags and logs was estimated based on tree diameter and 
condition class.  Dead trees representing the range of condition classes are being crossdated in this 
and other companion studies in northern Arizona.   At the Gus Pearson Natural Area, all dead wood 
classified in the field as ‘presettlement’ based on size and decay was of presettlement origin (Mast et 
al., in press).  However, direct determination of death date was precluded by sapwood rot on almost 
all of those samples.  The harvest date for large stumps (dsh ≥ 40 cm) was assumed to be 1890, 
corresponding to the historic timber cutting period in the Mt. Trumbull area (Altschul and Fairley 
1989), and the date for smaller stumps was assumed to be 1974, corresponding to more recent 
thinning under Forest Service and BLM management (BLM 1990). 
 
Rates of snagfall and movement through tree decay condition classes were summarized by 
Rogers et al. (1984).  They combined data from Cunningham et al. (1980) and Avery et al. (1976) to 
calibrate for northern Arizona the tree decomposition model developed by Thomas et al. (1979).  
Because of high variability among substrates and environmental conditions, as well as the extremely 
long time span required for research, the dynamics of tree decomposition are poorly understood 
(Harmon et al. 1985) and mathematical models based on observed decomposition classes are likely to 
be highly imprecise.  To assess the effect of such variability on the presettlement forest 
reconstruction, we carried out a sensitivity analysis by using three different decomposition rate 
percentiles, 25%, 50%, and 75%, to examine the effect of slower or faster decomposition on the 
estimates of death date and ecosystem structure at the date of fire exclusion.  Presettlement forest 
structure based on each of the three percentiles were calculated to determine the relative effect of 
model imprecision. 
 
To determine the presettlement diameter of dead trees, growth estimates for the period from 
fire exclusion to death date were subtracted from the measured diameter, adjusted for the loss of 
bark where appropriate.  Site-specific predictive regression relationships between diameter and basal 
area increment were developed for presettlement ponderosa pine, Gambel oak, and pinyon trees, 
where an adequate sample size was collected.  For Utah juniper, published diameter-dependent 
growth regression equations were applied to determine presettlement diameter (Barger and Ffolliott 
1972).  
 
A potential source of error in this reconstruction approach is missing presettlement-era 
woody material, which would lead to an underestimate of presettlement forest density.  Fire 
consumption of wood was controlled as much as possible by selecting the year of the last widespread 
fires in the Mt. Trumbull region as the reconstruction year (although later fires also occurred in parts 
of the study area, as described below).  Complete decomposition of resinous woody material in the 
absence of fire is likely to take longer than the fire exclusion period due to the very slow 
decomposition rate in arid southwestern forests (Jenny et al. 1949, Hart et al. 1992).  Because small-
diameter pines rot quickly (Harmon et al. 1985, Arno et al. 1995), it could be argued that small trees 
or even doghair thickets which were alive in the settlement year but died soon thereafter would be 
missed.  However, there is no evidence in historical accounts, photographs (see 1870 illustration of 
Mt. Trumbull in Powell [1961:288]), or early inventories for the existence of numerous small trees in 
presettlement northern Arizona--quite the contrary (Cooper 1960).  Nor does it seem likely that such 
thickets could have become established under frequent fire regimes (White 1985).  Finally, there is no 
reason to believe that such trees would have died in high numbers following fire exclusion, especially 
in light of the remarkable persistence of small trees in stressed postsettlement doghair thickets 
(Schubert 1974, Avery et al. 1976, White 1985).  The possible underestimation of some small 

MOUNT LOGAN FOREST 
11 
presettlement trees that left no trace cannot be dismissed but such trees are unlikely to have formed a 
substantial component of presettlement forest structure. 
 
 
 
RESULTS 
 
FIRE HISTORY 
The fire history data for the Mt. Logan Wilderness is summarized in Table 2.  A total of 200 
fire scars were dated from 32 sample trees, within the periods of adequate sampling depth for the 
wilderness study sites.  These periods ranged from 312 to 365 years, with the earliest fire date in 1632 
and the ending fire history year in 1996.  Additional fires were dated prior to the beginning year in 
each site, but were not included in the statistical analysis due to limited sample depth.

Each fire-scarred sample appears as a horizontal line in the fire charts shown for each study 
site in Figure 2.  The vertical bars mark the occurrence of fire scars, with the bottom composite axis 
of each chart indicating the fire years.  A number of fires were recorded in consecutive years, 
especially in the Mt. Logan study site where fires occurred every year between 1732 and 1735.  These 
fires were probably relatively small, however, scarring only one or two sample trees.  The Mt. Logan 
study site is long and thin, delineated by the wilderness border and the rim of the mountain (Figure 
1), making it likely that presettlement fires under prevailing winds would have often burned to the 
NE out of the wilderness.  In contrast, the more compact areas included in the Petty Knoll and Slide 
Mountain study sites show more evidence of large-scale fires crossing each site.  For example, fires 
scarred most of the samples across the Petty Knoll site in 1670, 1686, 1703, and 1782.  These sites 
also recorded fewer consecutive-year fires.

Fires burned frequently in the Mt. Logan Wilderness until frequent fire regimes were disrupted 
between 1869 and 1879 (Table 2, Figure 2), coinciding with Euro-American settlement of the Mt. 
Trumbull area (Altschul and Fairley 1989).   Presettlement fire return intervals (WMPI) ranged from 
4.5 to 6 years, including all scars, and about twice as long—10 to 12 years—including only fires 
scarring 25% or more of the sample trees (Table 2).  The mean fire interval (MFI) and WMPI values 
were similar, indicating that the fire interval distributions were not highly skewed.  The minimum 
time between fires was one year at all sites (up to 3-4 years for the 25%-scarred distributions) and the 
maximum fire-free periods were 11-32 years (26-32 years for the 25%-scarred distributions).  The 32-
year period between 1703 and 1735 at Slide Mountain was the longest presettlement period without 
any evidence of fire at any of the sites.   
 
Table 3.   Presettlement fire return intervals (years) at the study sites.  Statistical analysis was carried out in 
two categories: (1) all fire years, including those represented by a single fire scar; and (2) fire years in 
which 25% or more of the recording sample trees were scarred.   The period of analysis at each site covered 
the beginning date through the fire disruption date, as noted in Table 1.

No statistically significant temporal changes in the presettlement fire regimes were found at 
any site.  Some evidence of spatial differences in fire interval distributions, as well as synchroneity 
between adjacent sites was observed, but the sample sizes were small and different tests gave 
contradictory results.  Therefore, analysis of spatial patterns will be deferred until complete fire 
history data are available. 
 
Fires occurred predominantly in the summer, accounting for 52% to 76% of the fire years 
(Table 4).  However, the season could not be determined on approximately 1/3 to 1/2 of the fire 
scars, usually because of narrow rings or decay in the scarred area.

No fires were recorded after 1869 at the Petty Knoll site (although the sample size was only 
2 recording trees), but postsettlement fires occurred at the other sites.  The Mt. Logan site had fires 
in 1936 (scarring two of five samples) and 1989 (one of two samples).  At Slide Mountain, fire was 
recorded in 1896 (one of eight samples) and 1934 (four of nine samples, in the NW portion of the 
site).   
 
CONTEMPORARY FOREST CONDITIONS 
CONTEMPORARY HERBACEOUS COMPOSITION AND DENSITY 
Substrate cover along the herbaceous transects is presented in Figure 3.  Plant material 
accounted for only 8% of the ground cover, while about 70% was litter.  Bare mineral soil, wood, 
rock and duff were also present, representing the remaining 18%-20% ground cover. Comparing 
substrate frequency across soil types, cinder soils had the highest plant cover, at 16%.  Basalt soils 
had only 7% plant cover.  The lowest plant cover was found in the thinned plots on basalt soils, with 
only 2% cover.

Differences in plant species diversity (Table 2) parallel those in substrate cover, above, with 
highest diversity found on cinder soil plots and lowest diversity found on thinned basalt soils plots.  
Plant frequency was relatively low:  the 20 most frequent plants in each analysis area are listed in 
Tables 3.  Sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) was one of the most frequent plants, found on around 2% 
of the landscape.  Higher frequencies of plants occurred on the cinder plots and a larger proportion 
were shrub species, including Amelancheir utahensis, Artemesia tridentata, Ptelia trifoliata, Ribes cereum, Rhus 
trilobata, Ceanothus spp., Quercus turbinella, and Arctostapholus pungens.  Approximately 10% of the cinder 
landscape was covered by these shrubs.  In contrast, only 2.5% of the basalt landscape was covered 
by shrub species and less than 1% shrub cover was found on thinned basalt plots. 
Native plant species were predominant in the understory but several species of the most 
frequent taxonomic groups were exotics (Bromus tectorum, Poa pratensis, Verbascum thapsus, and some 
species of Agropyron.).  The cinder plots supported the highest percentage of native plant cover 
(94%).  Unthinned basalt plots had 81% native plant cover and thinned basalt plots had 77% native 
plant cover.  A complete species list, by family, is provided in Appendix A.

CONTEMPORARY FOREST OVERSTORY STRUCTURE 
 
Current forest conditions were dense, with a mean of 1,411 trees/ha in the Mt. Logan 
Wilderness.  About 90% of the trees were ponderosa pine and about 7% were Gambel oak.  Basal 
area is dominated by ponderosa pine.  However, differences in forest structure were observed 
between the basalt and cinder soils.  Forest density on basalt soils averaged 2790 trees/ha while 
density on cinder soils averaged only 696 trees/ha (Table 7) and almost twice as much ponderosa 
pine basal area occurred on basalt soil plots as on cinder plots (Table 8).  The proportions of pines 

MOUNT LOGAN FOREST 
 17
and oaks also differed:  while 98% of all basal area on basalt soils was ponderosa pine, only 85% of 
the total basal area on cinder soils was ponderosa pine.  Gambel oak was a more prominent 
component in the cinder soil stands, comprising 22% of the trees per hectare and 11% of the basal 
area.

Thinned and unthinned plots difffered greatly in tree density.  The thinned plots had 800 
trees/ha while the unthinned plots had 2790 trees/ha (Table 9).  The thinned plots also had a higher 
proportion and absolute density of Gambel oak.  However, the total basal area from thinned and 
unthinned plots was almost identical (Table 10) and strongly dominated by ponderosa pine 
(approximately 92% of the basal area).   Although approximately 15 m2/ha of basal area was 
removed from the thinned plots around 1974 (BLM 1990), based on the cross-sectional area of 
stumps measured on the plots, growth of the residual trees has replaced this basal area over the past 
23 years.

Diameter distributions are presented below for trees found on cinder soils (Figure 4), 
unthinned basalt soils (Figure 5) and thinned basalt soils (Figure 6).   The distributions of living trees 
show that 80% were less than 25 cm dbh.   Gambel oak made up a large proportion of the smaller 
trees, but few large oaks or other non-ponderosa tree species were encountered.  Several large living 
ponderosa pine trees were found (maximum tree diameter was 112 cm), but many of the largest trees 
had been cut:  7.5 stumps/ha greater than 90 cm were found (maximum stump diameter was 112 
cm).   Snag distributions were dominated by Gambel oak in the smaller size classes, making up more 
than 50% of all snags less than 20 cm, but almost all larger snags and downed dead trees were 
ponderosa pine.  The largest non-ponderosa snag was less than 80 cm in diameter while the largest 
ponderosa pine snag was 147 cm.  Distributions of cut stumps reflect the thinning of small trees on 
the thinned basalt plots (Figure 6) as well as past harvest of large-diameter ponderosa pine trees.  By 
chance, no stumps larger than 30 cm were encountered on the unthinned basalt plots (Figure 5), even 
though this area had been commercially harvested in the past.  The absence of stumps appears to 
have been due to the variability associated with the small sample size (n = 11 plots).

TREE REGENERATION 
Tree regeneration data are  summarized in Table 11.  Gambel oak had the highest 
regeneration densities, but only on cinder soils.  Oak densities declined sharply with succeeding 
height classes.  Ponderosa pine was less abundant but seedling densities declined more slowly with 
increasing height.  The density and diversity of size classes and species in regeneration was greatest 
on the cinder soil plots and least on the thinned basalt soil plots.

CANOPY COVER 
Canopy cover averaged 53% on all plots sampled in the Mt. Logan Wilderness (Table 12).  
Cinder soils had the lowest canopy cover, corresponding to the lower tree densities found on cinder 
soils.  There was no difference in canopy cover between thinned and unthinned plots on basalt soils.

FUELS—COARSE WOODY DEBRIS AND FOREST FLOOR BIOMASS 
Average total fuel loadings were 48.67 metric tons/ha on all wilderness plots (Tables 13 and 
14).  Approximately half of the fuel loading was woody debris; the remainder was forest floor 

MOUNT LOGAN FOREST 
 24
material.  The highest fuel loads occurred on the cinder soil plots, due to the high loading of large 
sound fuels.  However, these fuels were also highly variable (coefficient of variation = 305%).  On 
basalt soils, the thinned plots had nearly twice the fuel loading of the unthinned plots, primarily due 
to higher large woody fuels.  These woody fuels appear to consist mainly of the thinned tree stems 
(P.Z. Fulé, personal observation 1995).

PRESETTLEMENT FOREST STRUCTURE 
PRESETTLEMENT RECONSTRUCTION 
Reconstructed forest density (Table 15) and basal area (Table 16) were substantially lower 
than current forest values.  Density of ponderosa pine increased by at least an order of magnitude 
since 1870, although increases for other species were less marked.  Current conditions for New 
Mexican locust are included, but no locusts old enough to be of presettlement origin were found on 
the sampling plots and no estimate of presettlement locust conditions was made (see also Fulé et al. 
1997).  Ponderosa pine was the predominant tree species at all sites, making up the smallest 
proportion of tree density on the cinder soil plots (58%) and the highest proportion on the 
unthinned basalt soil plots (72%).  However, due 
to the larger size of the ponderosa pine trees, the 

MOUNT LOGAN FOREST 
 25
species comprised 93-97% of basal area at all sites.  The results reported in Tables 15 and 16 were 
based on the assumption that dead trees moved at the 50th percentile rate through the condition 
classes of the snag decomposition model.  The sensitivity analysis carried out by altering the 
decomposition rate percentile from 25% to 75% led to a 1%-16% change in reconstructed density 
(highest difference on the cinder soils) but only 1%-3% changes in reconstructed basal area.

DIAMETER DISTRIBUTION 
 
Ponderosa pine trees followed a relatively unimodal, normal diameter distribution in 1870 
(Figure 8), in contrast to the strongly skewed distribution dominated by smaller trees in the current 
forest (Figures 4-6).  Gambel oak trees made up the majority of the smaller size classes.

AGE DISTRIBUTION 
The age distributions of living presettlement trees are shown in Figure 9.  These distributions 
are not the 1870 age patterns, because mortality, tree harvest, and rot have removed many or most of 
the trees which were alive in 1870.  Usually the oldest trees have either died of natural causes or were 
preferentially harvested because of their larger size.  Current sampling of living presettlement-era 
trees therefore results in a truncated age distribution.  Complete dendrochronological dating of all 
dead as well as living trees would be required to estimate the age distribution present in 1870 (see 
Mast et al., in press).  The distributions in Figure 9 are identical to the older portion of the current 
age distributions (Figure 7), except that the old trees can be more clearly distinguished on the y-axis 
due to the lower presettlement tree density.

DISCUSSION 
 
PRESETTLEMENT FOREST CONDITIONS 
 
 
Prior to Euro-American settlement, fires burned frequently across the Mt. Logan landscape 
and forest structures were relatively open and dominated by large trees.  Tree densities were within 
the range of approximately 50  to 150 trees/ha found in other reconstruction studies in pine-oak 
forests (Covington and Moore 1994a, Fulé et al. 1997) and in the range of 7 to 116 ponderosa 
pines/ha reported in early forest inventories and other studies in northern Arizona (see Covington 
and Moore 1994b for comparison).   Oaks were dominant in the smaller diameter size classes at all 
three analysis areas (Figure 8); Fulé et al. (1997) suggested that the survival of many of these oak trees 
might be an artifact of fire exclusion.  Oaks probably maintained large numbers of sprouts which 
were repeatedly thinned by fire and replaced with further sprouting.  Had frequent fires continued 
past the 1869-1879 period, many of the small trees with center dates close to that time (Figure 9) 
would probably have been killed.   
 
Understory plants were evidently sufficiently abundant to carry presettlement fires, but the 
cover and species composition of herbaceous plants and shrubs cannot be estimated with the same 
precision as the tree structure and fire regime.   Brown 
et 
al. 
(1974) 
related 
herbaceous 

MOUNT LOGAN FOREST

production to overstory basal area on basalt soils at Beaver Creek, Arizona; their model suggests that 
the range of average presettlement basal areas on the Mt. Logan sites would produce only about 60-
120 kg/ha of herbaceous plants.  However, this model and most other contemporary approaches 
have been based on data collected under twentieth century conditions, usually in forests where trees 
have been deliberately spaced apart.   In the clumpy presettlement forest, gaps between tree clumps 
would have supported much higher production.  At the Gus Pearson Natural Area, near Flagstaff, 
restored forest plots produced 200-350 kg/ha of grasses and forbs within 2 years of treatment, 
compared to a control area with  70 kg/ha (Covington et al. 1997 and unpublished data). 
After fire exclusion, the sprouting capability of oak appears to have given the species an 
advantage in establishment (Figure 7).  Pines were dependent on seed propagation, requiring a more 
specific combination of climate conditions (Savage et al. 1997), and pine seed-producing trees may 
have also been greatly reduced by early logging (Fulé et al. 1997).  These factors probably contributed 
to the lag in pine regeneration between 1870 until the early twentieth century (Figure 7). 
 
 
CURRENT FOREST CONDITIONS IN THE MT. LOGAN WILDERNESS 
 
 
Fire has been excluded from most of the ponderosa pine forests of the Mt. Logan 
Wilderness since 1869-1879.  For the broader data set from the Mt. Trumbull region, 1869 or 1870 
are the average dates of fire regime disruption (P.Z. Fulé and others, unpublished data), matching the 
1870 date of increased resource utilization by Euro-American Mormon settlers (Altschul and Fairley 
1989).  The only widespread postsettlement fires occurred in the 1930’s, when the majority of trees 
found in the current forest were still very young (Figure 7).  The 1934 and 1936 fires may have 
thinned some trees but apparently did not cause large-scale mortality or substantially check the 
increase in tree density during the twentieth century.  The pattern of relatively abrupt fire exclusion, 
followed by occasional postsettlement fires, is typical of southwestern ponderosa pine forests 
(Swetnam and Baisan 1996). 
 
The range of current conditions in the Mt. Logan Wilderness is similar to that of many 
ponderosa pine forests in northern Arizona.  The overstory on basalt soils, with nearly 2,800 
trees/ha, is approximately as dense as the unmanaged Gus Pearson Natural Area near Flagstaff 
(3,098 trees/ha; Covington 1997).  The sites are similar not only in density, but also in the mix of 
scattered large presettlement trees surrounded by dense, “doghair” thickets of postsettlement pines.  
In the thinned area on basalt soils, the average tree density of approximately 800 trees/ha is close to 
the Arizona statewide average of 776 trees/ha, calculated by Garrett et al. in 1985.  Plots on cinder 
soils were nearly as dense, close to 700 trees/ha, but had a substantially higher component of non-
ponderosa species, especially Gambel oak.  Tree density was least variable on the thinned sites 
(coefficient of variation = 28%), as expected given the management intervention to create a uniform 
overstory structure.  The unthinned basalt and cinder areas had coefficients of variation in tree 
density of 83% and 85%, respectively.   
 
The thinning carried out on about half of the basalt soil area around 1974 had many 
ecological impacts on the forest.  Approximately 15 m2/ha of tree basal area and nearly 1,200 
trees/ha were removed, changing the dense “doghair” forest to an evenly-spaced tree pattern (see 
Appendix C for contrasting photographs).  Growth of the residual trees has been rapid, essentially 
replacing the thinned basal area within 23 years.  The average tree size (quadratic mean diameter), 
however, is nearly twice as large in the thinned area:  25.5 cm vs. 13.1 cm.  Canopy cover is also 
approximately equal between the thinned and unthinned sites; although the 56%-57% canopy cover 
may not appear to be high, it is actually typical of 
dense southwestern ponderosa pine stands when 

MOUNT LOGAN FOREST

measured by vertical projection, a technique which precisely accounts for small gaps in the tree 
crowns (see data from Grand Canyon National Park, ERP 1998).  Understory cover and diversity are 
low throughout the basalt plots, but especially in the thinned area, where plant cover was 2% and 
species diversity averaged only 2.3 species/plot.  Overall, the thinning appears to have been highly 
successful in monopolizing the site resources for tree growth, at the expense of herbaceous plants.  
An ecological restoration thinning treatment, in contrast, would have retained fewer trees and 
matched the clumpy presettlement tree pattern (Covington et al. 1997), leaving open areas for 
understory growth and diversity.  Trees would grow even more rapidly under a restoration thinning, 
but the lower tree density, clumped distribution, and fire control of future regeneration would keep 
crown closure and canopy fuels relatively low, precluding crownfire. 
 
Understory plants on the cinder soil sites have about twice the cover and species diversity of 
the basalt sites.  Shrubs made up 9 of the 20 most frequent species, possibly reflecting a competitive 
advantage for deeper-rooted shrubs over grasses and forbs in the well-drained cinders.  Many of the 
shrubs, such as Ribes, Quercus, and Ceanothus, are particularly desirable food sources for animals and 
humans.  Dry cinder sites in the Mt. Trumbull region and elsewhere in northern Arizona seem to be 
the least affected by the disruption of frequent fires, sometimes with little or no evidence of 
postsettlement tree population irruptions (e.g., the Sunset Crater volcanic field near Flagstaff).  
However, in the Mt. Logan Wilderness, fires occurred nearly as frequently in the cinder soil area as in 
the basalt soil area, where the finer soils may have been better-suited for herbaceous production.  It 
is not clear whether grasses and forbs were in fact more prevalent on the cinders prior to the 
introduction of heavy livestock grazing, or whether the more scattered shrub, herbaceous, and woody 
fuels found today are similar to presettlement fuels, with the dry conditions and steep slopes of the 
cinder hills helping to maintain active fire behavior. 
 
Living and dead fuels are not excessive for contemporary southwestern ponderosa pine 
forests (Sackett 1979) but on the basalt sites they are clearly sufficient in quantity and continuity to 
support high-intensity crownfire even in average fire seasons.  Trees are more patchily distributed on 
the cinder sites, but crownfire remains a concern, especially in the denser forests along the lower 
slopes of Petty Knoll and Slide Mountain. 
 
 
ECOLOGICAL ISSUES RELATED TO RESTORATION OF THE MT. LOGAN WILDERNESS 
 
Any unique aspects to restoration in the Mt. Logan will most likely center around social 
decisions regarding the value of management intervention for restorative purposes and the 
appropriate methods for carrying out treatments.  In ecological terms, conditions within the 
wilderness area are similar to those of non-wilderness ponderosa forests in the Mt. Trumbull region.  
Appropriate restoration treatments would also be similar:  thinning of postsettlement trees to 
emulate the density and spatial patterns of the presettlement forest, fuel treatments around the bases 
of presettlement trees, reintroduction of fire in prescription following the pattern of the 
presettlement fire regime, and ongoing monitoring to track changes and make adjustments as needed 
(Covington et al. 1997).  If natural understory regeneration were inadequate, for example, seeding or 
planting alternatives could be tried. 
 
Only a few living presettlement trees per ha remain in the Mt. Logan Wilderness, and many 
appear to suffer from reduced vigor, underscoring the need for rapid intervention even in the 
absence of catastrophic fire.  These residual trees would form the foundation for developing the 
restored forest structure.  Understory plants are very sparse, especially on the basalt soils, but are 
mostly comprised of native species.   Highly stressed old trees and relatively unproductive 
herbaceous plants under similar circumstances in 
the Gus Pearson Natural Area, near Flagstaff, 

MOUNT LOGAN FOREST 
 31
have shown a rapid respond to restoration treatments (Covington et al. 1997).  Fire is currently being 
re-introduced to the Mt. Logan Wilderness through prescribed burning over the past several years.  
Accumulated fuels have been raked from presettlement tree boles prior to burning.  These fires will 
probably contribute to reducing fire hazard, modest improvements in understory condition, and 
possibly thinning some postsettlement trees.  However, the effectiveness of a fire-only treatment is 
highly limited because the great majority of dense young trees will not be killed under prescribed 
burning conditions (Sackett et al. 1996). 
 
The effectiveness of restoration treatments can be affected by the presence of exotic species 
and the absence of extirpated ones.  In the plant community, exotics include naturalized species 
which appear to be relatively innocuous with respect to natural ecosystem function, such as the 
perennial grasses Poa pratensis and Bomus inermis.  However, two other well-established exotics, 
Verbascum thapsus and Bromus tectorum, are aggressive pioneer species which may make native 
revegetation more difficult.  The ability of Bromus tectorum to thrive in a frequent fire regime may 
make this species particularly difficult to control.  On the other, as ecosystems are returned to more 
natural conditions it may be the case that native perennials will demonstrate a high degree of 
resilience.  In the animal community, some species may have been extirpated, especially top 
predators.  Two “semi-native” species, the Abert squirrel (Sciurus aberti) and the Merriam turkey 
(Meleagris gallopavo), are common in much of northern Arizona but were introduced to the Mt. 
Trumbull region in 1971-75 and 1961, respectively (BLM 1990).  The roles of these introduced 
species as well as of native species which are isolated in the “sky island” forest environment of Mt. 
Trumbull will be of interest as research continues (M. Elson, personal communication, 1998). 
 
Human uses of the Mt. Logan forest are limited under wilderness management guidelines.  
However, as more is learned about past human influences, possibly including resource management 
practices such as burning or wildland plant cultivation by Paiute and other residents, the role of 
modern humans may need to be re-examined (T. Alcoze, personal communication, 1998). 
 
Many of the central ecological issues related to restoration of the Mt. Logan forests in 
particular, and southwestern ponderosa pine ecosystems in general, are quite straightforward.  The 
relatively short period of anthropogenic ecosystem degradation, the ability to precisely determine 
many key components of presettlement forest structure and disturbance regimes, and the broad 
ecological knowledge, research, and experience developed over more than a century of testing and 
observing treatments such as thinning and burning give scientists and managers powerful tools with 
which to design restoration treatments. Putting restoration treatments into practice, however, will 
only be achieved if society perceives real benefits (Higgs 1997).  The data assembled in this report are 
necessary for informing decisions about resource management, but they are only one component in a 
broader debate over the appropriate goals and methods for managing this wilderness area on public 
lands.

APPENDIX C:  MT. LOGAN ANALYSIS AREAS 
 
Plot 1341 on cinder soils north of Petty Knoll in 1997.  The forest is relatively open, with many 
shrubs in the understory.  Fuels are variable with occasional large woody debris. 
 
Plot 786 on basalt soils near the peak of Mt. Logan in 1996.  Dense young ponderosa pine trees 
dominate the forest.  There are few remaining presettlement trees, such as the tree in the right rear of 
the scene; many have recently died.  Understory productivity is extremely low.

Plot mtrc-01 on basalt soils near the peak of Mt. Logan in 1995.  The plot falls in the area 
thinned around 1974.  Residual trees have grown rapidly and basal area is approximately equal to that 
of the adjacent unthinned stands.  Understory productivity is extremely low.
