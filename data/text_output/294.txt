To the editor:  
Thank you for the recent article, "United front needed on Flagstaff forest thinning 
projects." I have been examining such appeals by various groups for a couple of years. I 
have concluded the main objective of some groups is to stop all commercial logging, and 
do it by whatever means are required. It is sad to see a group seem to cooperate until late 
in the process, then back out to their original position.  
It is obvious that imposing a size limit on trees to be cut is not really healthy for the 
forests. It is also obvious that limits reduce the value of the logging. Your references to 
the excellent work by Dr. Covington are appreciated. Anyone can claim science is on 
their side. Few can prove it by careful experiments.
