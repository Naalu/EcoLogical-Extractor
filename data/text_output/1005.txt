Carbon, Harvest Yields, and Residues from
Restoration in a Mixed Forest on California’s
Coast Range
John-Pascal Berrill and Han-Sup Han
We simulated growth and yield over a century of restoration activities in a mixed evergreen conifer stand in northern California. Our goal was to compare ecosystem
products and services, namely carbon storage, harvest yields, and residue production, among restoration-oriented silvicultural prescriptions promoting conifer dominance.
We compared individual-tree selection and group selection with replanting conifers after clearcutting and “no harvest” scenarios. Ignoring risk of wildﬁre or forest health
problems, we found that the crowded, untreated stand stored the most carbon per acre in live trees. Among the scenarios involving harvesting, high-density individual-tree
selection had the greatest carbon storage because the higher density afforded high levels of production and storage of carbon in live trees. Conversion toward conifer
dominance was rapid when conifers were replanted after clearcutting or low-density individual-tree selection (preferentially removing hardwood while releasing existing
and planted conifers). Group selection had high harvest yields. Implementing group selection and managing the forested matrix between openings gave a steadier ﬂow
of sawlogs and residues; however, less carbon was being stored per acre in live trees growing vigorously within and between openings. Implementing an assortment
of these prescriptions would provide an ongoing supply of logs and residues around which processing infrastructure and markets could develop.

P
rojections of forest growth and yield can be used to estimate
forest residue yields and carbon sequestration and storage
services (Bettinger et al. 2009). Estimates of the available
supply of forest-harvesting residues, over time and space, underpin
investment in infrastructure such as biomass energy plants (Hall
2002). Projections of carbon storage in live trees and long-lived
wood products are needed to sell carbon offsets (Malmsheimer et al.
2011). Diversiﬁcation of income from forest products and ecosys-
tem services can buffer against downturns in log markets. Additional
income streams might give landowners more ﬂexibility to manage
their forests for outcomes other than short-term yield of merchant-
able sawlogs. Projections of forest growth and yield under different
silvicultural regimes make us aware of differences and any tradeoffs
between forest products and services among forests with different
structure and composition (Weiskittel et al. 2011).
The upland forests on warmer and drier parts of California’s
Coast Range were logged throughout the 1900s and left to regener-
ate naturally with hardwood and conifer. Once dominated by large
conifers, these mixed evergreen conifer forests now have an over-
abundance of hardwoods (Supplemental Figure S1).
Most com-
mon are tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiﬂorus [Hook. & Arn.] Ma-
nos et al.) seedlings and stump sprouts mixed with coast Douglas-ﬁr
(Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii [Mirb.] Franco). Competition
from tanoak can have a profound impact on growth of Douglas-ﬁr
(Harrington and Tappeiner 2009). Current ownership patterns and
forest management practices include industrial forestry companies
harvesting and planting conifers and using herbicide to control
hardwoods, not-for-proﬁt owners engaged in partial harvesting and
underplanting with conifers, and many small unmanaged private
holdings.
Crowded young forests on drier sites along the Coast Range are
ﬁre-prone and vulnerable to insects and disease. Tree crowns rise as
competition intensiﬁes, impacting tree vigor and presumably the
ability to defend against insects and disease or respond to release
(Oliver and Larson 1996). Dying trees with high crowns may not
intensify ﬁre behavior, but their numerous small crowns do contrib-
ute to high canopy bulk densities. Dead trees that fall contribute to
surface fuels that drive ﬁre behavior (Sugihara 2006). Tanoak stems
are usually killed by heat from ﬁres, but resprout from root systems
that survive wildﬁre (Sugihara 2006). Larger conifers have thicker

bark that may protect them during all but the most destructive
wildﬁres (Agee 1996). However, crowding in unmanaged forests
restricts tree size development.
Treatments that reduce stand density are expected to mitigate
extreme ﬁre behavior. However, their beneﬁts will change over time
as trees grow and become more ﬁre resistant, harvest residues decay
and alter the rate of spread of ground ﬁre, and regeneration develops
into fuel ladders that might allow ﬁre to move from the ground into
the forest canopy and be more destructive. Cutting all but the largest
most vigorous tanoak (important for wildlife habitat and forage) to
relieve crowding and replanting with the faster-growing merchant-
able conifers Douglas-ﬁr and coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens
[D Don] Endl.) have the potential to enhance overall forest health
and productivity (Tappeiner et al. 2007, Berrill and O’Hara 2014,
2016). Management focused on restoring conifer dominance can be
considered “forest rehabilitation” deﬁned by Lamb and Gilmour
(2003, p. 14) as “re-establishing the productivity and some, but not
necessarily all, of the plant and animal species originally present.”
Removal and utilization of forest harvest residues should make use
of carbon otherwise released to the atmosphere when residues decay,
while reducing surface fuel loading to mitigate the risk of wildﬁre
that kills trees storing carbon (Jain et al. 2012). However, residues
modify the forest ﬂoor environment through mulch effects that can
enhance seedling development (Harrington et al. 2013), and residue
removal may impact long-term productivity on some sites (Achat
et al. 2015), although this is less likely on California’s fertile soils
(Powers et al. 2005).
Residues include materials leftover from timber harvest such as
branches and culled pieces of stemwood, as well as small-diameter
trees and species that are not economically feasible to harvest due to
low market values. Costs of harvesting and hauling residues can be
high and lack of markets causes these types of materials to be left on
harvested sites instead of being used (Han et al. 2004, Kizha et al.
2015). Recent studies show that a stump-to-truck cost of residue
recovery operations was around $30/bone dry ton (BDT) not in-
cluding hauling materials to a power plant (Harrill and Han 2010,
Bisson et al. 2016). By adding hauling cost, the total cost of residue
harvest and transportation often exceeds local biomass market values
(i.e., up to $50/BDT) in northern California. In situations where
residues are not used, the current practices of residue management
include “scatter on site and let decay,” “pile and burn,” “broadcast
burn,” or “mastication.” It costs $300–800/acre to manage residues
after clearcut harvest in industrial timberlands (Mike Alcorn, pers.
comm., Green Diamond Resource Company, Jan. 10, 2016), and
residue burning can negatively impact air quality.
Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to 1990 levels state-
wide by the year 2020 is the primary objective of the California
Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32). Forest rehabilita-
tion projects along the Coast Range of northern California should
further that objective by enhancing carbon sequestration and stor-
age in healthy, resilient, ﬁre-resistant, productive, conifer-domi-
nated forests. In theory, forest rehabilitation projects provide GHG
emission reduction beneﬁts via the following:
1.
timber harvesting to produce long-lived solidwood products
that store carbon instead of letting trees in crowded stands die
and release carbon to the atmosphere via decay, and
2.
restoring higher rates of forest growth and carbon sequestra-
tion by returning species composition to the more productive
historical conditions under which fast-growing conifers
dominated.
AB 32 requires that projects demonstrate GHG emission reductions
that are real, permanent, quantiﬁable, veriﬁable, and enforceable by
the state board. Installation of permanent monitoring plots allows
for GHG emission reductions to be veriﬁed after postharvest plot
data are collected repeatedly over time. These data can be used to
validate projections of stand development and carbon sequestration
from growth models. In the absence of long-term data sets, forest
growth and yield models allow us to compare different forest man-
agement prescriptions in terms of harvest yields, residue production,
and carbon storage over extended periods, albeit with some uncer-
tainty (Melson et al. 2011).
The goal of this simulation study was to quantify ecosystem
products and services derived from different approaches to convert-
ing unmanaged naturally regenerated forests into productive coni-
fer-dominated forests. Our speciﬁc objectives were to examine the
inﬂuence of stand density and silvicultural regeneration method on
species composition, forest growth and yield, residue production,
and carbon storage in live trees and sawn timber, and how these
changed over time. Prescriptions were designed to reestablish coni-
fer dominance by preferentially cutting hardwoods and replanting
merchantable conifers after clearcutting or partial harvesting. We
also developed “no harvest” scenarios that may reveal the beneﬁts of
culling hardwood with herbicide without any conifer harvest (avoid-
ing operational and permitting costs associated with timber harvest-
ing), and a no-treatment benchmark against which to compare all
other treatments.
Methods
Growth and Yield Modeling
To generate estimates of basal area (BA) development, harvest
yields and residue production, carbon in live biomass and sawn
timber, and total carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) net gain, we
used FORSEE (Build_26, released February 2015) to model stand
growth, yield, and carbon. FORSEE is approved for growth and
yield modeling in carbon offset projects by the California Air Re-
sources Board.1 Pure and mixed stands of species native to Califor-
nia’s Coast Range can be modeled in a variety of even-aged and
multiaged stand structures. The individual-tree model restricts
growth of trees and regeneration according to a competition factor
based on canopy cover from trees with crowns of similar or higher
stature. We used stand data representative of unmanaged stands on
poorer sites throughout the Coast Range (mixed conifer-hardwood,
dominated by tanoak and Douglas-ﬁr) and relatively low site class
(Douglas-ﬁr site index 114 ft at base age 50 years) to represent the
pretreatment condition (FORSEE Stand DR3D_41). Stand BA
was 209 ft2 acre1, comprising 1,083 trees per acre (tpa) including
75 ft2 acre1 BA of conifer numbering 70 tpa (hardwood outnum-
bered conifer by 14:1). Average tree size (quadratic mean) was
13.8 in. dbh for conifers and 5 in. dbh for hardwoods. Stand density
index (SDI) for all species combined was 454 or 76% of the maxi-
mum SDI for Douglas-ﬁr (Reineke 1933).
We simulated eight forest management scenarios, including two
without harvesting, one clearcut scenario, and ﬁve multiaged man-
agement scenarios. The multiaged treatments designed to favor co-
nifer over hardwood were modeled through a series of different
FORSEE harvest routine settings at intervals of 20 years (Supple-
mental Table S2). Individual-tree selection (IS) was implemented
Forest Science • February 2017

through a series of different harvests (each followed by underplant-
ing of redwood and Douglas-ﬁr in equal numbers) until a balanced
uneven-aged condition with ﬁve age classes (cohorts) was reached.
At each partial harvest, low-density IS reduced BA to 80 ft2 acre1
(including at least 5 ft2 acre1 hardwood) and high-density IS re-
duced BA to 120 ft2 acre1 (including at least 10 ft2 acre1 hard-
wood). Group selection (GS) involved creating a series of openings
(up to 2.5 ac each, per California law, covering 20% of the forest
area) which were modeled as miniature even-aged stands, regener-
ated with redwood and Douglas-ﬁr, and thinned repeatedly every 20
years to control stand density over the 100-year modeling period.
For example, immediately after partial harvesting in year 40, 20% of
the forest area had new GS openings (age 0 years), 20% of the area
had openings with 20-year-old regeneration, 20% of the area had
openings with 40-year-old regeneration, and the remaining 40% of
the area was “matrix” of forested area surrounding the GS openings.
The matrix was left untreated under the GS prescription and mod-
eled under the “let grow” (no cut) prescription. Alternatively, GS
was combined with IS (GS  IS) for which the matrix received
partial harvesting every 20 years and was modeled as either low-den-
sity or high-density IS with a 20-year cutting cycle to coincide with
thinning operations in regenerated GS openings and new GS open-
ings being created over 20% of the area every 20 years (gradually
replacing the matrix with GS openings) (Supplemental Figure S2).
The “clearcut and replant conifer” (CC) prescription involved the
same series of treatments that were applied in a GS opening. Chem-
ical control of hardwoods in the “chemical only” treatment was
simulated in FORSEE by thinning to leave 5 ft2 acre1 hardwood
without cutting any conifer and then growing the (now conifer-
dominated) residual stand for 100 years.
The following assumptions were made with respect to modeling
harvesting and regeneration with FORSEE: harvest treatments were
applied at the beginning of 5-year modeling time steps; sprout re-
generation was set to zero to reﬂect planned application of herbi-
cides to unwanted hardwood; planted redwood and Douglas-ﬁr
seedlings were introduced into model runs after each selection har-
vest, but were only introduced into GS openings after they were
created, not after subsequent precommercial or commercial thin-
ning operations. FORSEE harvest routine settings are provided in
Supplemental Table S3. Without information on how to model
enhanced growth of edge trees adjacent to GS openings or reduced
growth of regeneration near edges of GS openings, we assumed that
these effects offset each other in GS and GS  IS prescriptions and
modeled the 2.5-acre GS openings as even-aged stands.
Carbon Calculations
Cubic stemwood volume per acre predicted using FORSEE was
converted to pounds by applying a factor of 26.77 for conifer
(mainly Douglas-ﬁr) and 30.14 for hardwoods (mainly tanoak)
(California Air Resources Board 2014). Pounds were converted to
metric tons using a factor of 0.000453592 and CO2e using a factor
of 1.8333, ignoring possible but unknown variations in wood den-
sity and carbon fraction between prescriptions (Jones and O’Hara
2012). Mass of the stemwood component was converted to total
aboveground biomass according to tree size using the stemwood
biomass ratio equations of Jenkins et al. (2003) for conifer 


1.8055/(dbh

and
hardwood

e(0.3065  5.424/(dbh  2.54)]. Metric tons per acre of CO2e
stored aboveground in live trees was averaged for each 20-year pe-
riod between harvest treatments (e.g., at time 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20
years) throughout the 100-year modeling period.
Regional mill efﬁciency data for north coastal California soft-
woods (0.675) was applied to CO2e in cubic harvested stemwood
volumes (giving 67.5% wood products and 32.5% sawmill resi-
dues). The wood product volume was adjusted (0.97) to reﬂect
the regional recovery rate of 97% in long-lived solidwood lumber
products.2
Biomass and Residue Production
Harvest yields predicted in units of cubic stemwood volume were
converted to BDTs for hardwoods and conifers. The difference
between stemwood mass and total aboveground biomass was desig-
nated harvest residue mass. Our calculations did not deduct any
biomass that may have been lost to decay or other damage. Keeping
residue mass identiﬁed as “conifer residues” or “hardwood residues”
allowed us to sum residues for each group separately or combined in
various harvesting and residue production scenarios. We calculated
residue production from conventional harvest systems extracting
logs and whole-tree harvesting with and without markets for conifer
and hardwood logs and residues. BDTs of residues per acre were
calculated for each 20-year harvest entry and summed over the
100-year modeling period.
Results
Stand BA Development
BA development differed between the eight prescriptions
(Figure 1). Modeling the “let grow” (no cut) prescription using the
FORSEE “default mortality” rate resulted in unrealistically high
stand density (predicted to change from the initial conditions of
1,083 tpa and 209 ft2 acre1 BA to 987 tpa and 541 ft2 acre1 BA
after 100 years). Therefore, the mortality rate was set to “maximum
mortality” to better model the elevated rate of competition-induced
mortality expected among hardwood and conifer in the untreated
stand. This resulted in 885 tpa and 497 ft2 acre1 BA (comprising
50% conifer BA) after 100 years without treatment. Chemical con-
trol of hardwoods reduced stand BA, releasing residual conifer trees
in the stand that eventually attained 316 ft2 acre1 BA (83% conifer
BA) after 100 years without further treatment. Clearcutting and
replanting conifers involved repeated thinning that reduced BA but
promoted rapid tree-size development in the even-aged conifer
stand.
Under multiaged management, new GS openings progressively
reduced BA of the original stand. At the same time, planted conifer
regeneration within these openings was thinned every 20 years and
developed rapidly. Overall this led to a gradual decline in stand BA
over the 100-year modeling period as residual trees were replaced
periodically by young conifers. Over time, stand BA remained ap-
proximately constant under high-density and low-density IS, com-
prising approximately 94% conifer BA after 100 years. Combined
GS  IS resulted in heavy BA reductions, but subsequent growth
was rapid among residual trees within the matrix and conifers
planted in GS openings and underplanted throughout the managed
matrix. Between years 80 and 100, BA development was the same
for all treatments involving GS because the forest area had become
completely covered by GS openings regenerated with conifers.
Harvest Yields
Combined GS  IS did not rival the high initial yield of clearcut-
ting, but provisioned the steadiest ﬂow of logs over the 100-year
130
Forest Science • February 2017

modeling period (Table 1). Early yields were lowest under high-den-
sity IS, where 92% of total sawlog yields came in years 40, 60, and
80 combined. High-density IS required retention of 120 ft2 acre1
BA, which only afforded a light initial cutting (year 0) to harvest
hardwood and no merchantable conifer. Low-density IS allowed for
some conifer harvest in conjunction with the removal of unwanted
hardwoods in year 0. Conifer wood production remained low for
decades after clearcutting or in GS openings until regeneration
could be commercially thinned. However, high yields from period-
ically creating new GS openings in the dense unmanaged GS matrix
led to the highest total harvest yield over the 100-year modeling
period.
Carbon in Live Trees and Wood Products
Under every prescription, carbon stored aboveground in live
trees had increased over the 100-year modeling period (assuming no
ﬁres or outbreaks of insects or disease). The “no cut” prescription
was predicted to have the greatest 100-year average carbon stock in
live trees. Among the seven prescriptions involving some form of
management to reduce crowding, the “chemical only” prescription
had the greatest 100-year average carbon stock in live trees. Among
the six prescriptions that involved harvesting, high-density IS
stored the most carbon, whereas combined GS and low-density IS
stored the least carbon in live trees over the 100-year modeling
period (Table 2). Harvesting and storage of carbon in conifer lum-
ber varied over time among rehabilitation prescriptions, but overall
the 100-year harvest totals were similar (Table 3).
The sum of CO2e stored in live trees and long-lived wood prod-
ucts is indicative of overall carbon storage under each prescription.
On a per acre basis, the no-cut prescription was predicted to have the
greatest total CO2e over the 100-year modeling period (Table 4).
Combining GS and low-density IS gave the least carbon storage.
Clearcutting and replanting conifer and low-density IS only gave
relatively modest carbon storage. High-density IS supported the
greatest total CO2e among prescriptions involving some form of
management by maintaining relatively high stand density and there-
fore high stand growth and yield. GS also had high carbon storage
attributed to high yields of long-lived solidwood products coming
from GS openings, rapid growth of young conifers planted within
GS openings, and rising stand density and production in the un-
managed matrix until it had all been cut and replaced with planted
conifers after 80 years. The decision to thin within GS openings
every 20 years favored tree-size development over stand production
and carbon stored in live trees and wood products. Forest manage-
ment in the Coast Range often entails harvesting enough merchant-
able conifers to defray costs and making obligatory concomitant
reductions in hardwood BA in accordance with California Forest
Practice Rules. This can result in low stand density and, subse-
quently, low production. The “common practice-aboveground car-
bon mean” regional baseline for carbon stored in live trees for this
site class III North Coast conifer forest is currently set at 205.15
metric tons acre1 CO2e.3 Our modeling indicated that the chem-
ical only and no-cut treatments had greater CO2e than the common
practice baseline, signifying a “net carbon gain” as a result of imple-
menting these prescriptions. All rehabilitation prescriptions involv-
ing harvesting had lower CO2e than the common practice baseline
(Table 4).
Biomass and Residue Production
In northern California, the conventional approach to harvesting
on the steep slopes and variable terrain characteristic of these forests
involves a mixture of cable and ground-based logging to bring logs
to small landings spaced along narrow forest roads. Hardwood logs
are sometimes extracted and piled on the landing for burning or use
as ﬁrewood or biomass energy. The focus of harvesting is on the
extraction of merchantable conifer logs. Under this system, conifer
and hardwood residues such as branches and tops remain scattered
across the site or may be piled. When we simulated applying this
harvest system at 20-year intervals, GS gave the greatest total yield of
conifer log biomass. Similar yield from GS combined with high-
density IS was more evenly distributed among harvest events (Figure
2A). The supply of conifer log biomass from an acre managed under
each prescription was greatest initially after clearcutting and zero
under high-density IS (only hardwoods were cut in the ﬁrst entry).
The supply of conifer log biomass increased progressively at each
harvest entry under most prescriptions and remained elevated after
Figure 1.

80 years once regenerated GS openings completely replaced the
original forest. Because harvest residues remained in the forest, and
hardwood logs may or may not have been used; the only residues
guaranteed to be coming from this system were conifer sawmill
residues (Figure 2B). The multiaged prescriptions generated more
residues in later years, whereas the even-aged prescription generated
the most conifer mill residues in association with clearcutting in year
0. If markets were developed for hardwood logs, the total log supply
(conifer  hardwood logs) would be greatest under GS but steadiest
under low-density IS or GS  IS (Figure 2C), whereas GS gave the
steadiest supply of hardwood log biomass (Figure 2D).
Alternatively, if we applied whole-tree harvesting, slash compris-
ing branches and tops of the cut trees would accumulate at the
landing and could be used or burned. We simulated this option,
assuming that conifer logs were dispatched to sawmills, which
would leave conifer slash and hardwood logs and slash available for
utilization as harvest residues (Figure 2E). Under this scenario, low-
density IS and GS  IS generated a steady supply of harvest residues,
whereas production of residues from GS steadily increased and to-
taled the most residues produced over a 100-year modeling period.
If conifer slash did not have a market, an operator could still perform
whole-tree harvesting but only dispatch hardwood logs and slash to

market (Figure 2F). Supply of hardwood logs and slash was greatest
with GS over the ﬁrst 100 years, but after this time conversion to
conifer dominance would be complete and hardwood yields would
be negligible. Conversion to conifer dominance was immediate after
clearcutting and replanting with conifer. The conversion proceeded
quickly with GS  IS or low-density IS and slowly with GS or
high-density IS. If new markets developed for hardwood logs
(e.g., sawtimber or veneer), then whole-tree harvesting would
have at least three product lines: conifer logs (Figure 2A), hard-
wood logs (Figure 2D), and residues comprising either conifer-
hardwood slash (Figure 2G) or hardwood slash alone (Figure
2H) if no market existed for conifer slash. Biomass of conifer
slash comprised 51–70% of total whole-tree harvest residues,
with its share and amount of the total residue stream increasing
as hardwoods were progressively replaced by conifers under the
various rehabilitation treatments.
Discussion
The wide-ranging rehabilitation prescriptions were designed to
represent realistic options for improvement of crowded, hardwood-
dominated Coast Range forests. Harvesting and replanting conifers
is compatible with timber production objectives and promoting
development of old-growth forest structure by regenerating new
cohorts of conifers and enhancing forest productivity, health, and
resilience (Berrill et al. 2013). Retention levels (low and high
density) were calculated using the upper limit of stand density for
Douglas-ﬁr (Reineke 1933) and the principles of stand density man-
agement described by Long (1985) and later applied to uneven-aged
stands by Long and Daniel (1990) and Shaw (2000). The decision
to select upper limits of 30 and 50% relative density for low- and
high-density management zones was supported by simulation stud-
ies (Berrill and O’Hara 2009), indicating that these represented
lower and higher levels of stand density that should allow for ade-
quate site occupancy, cubic (carbon) and board foot volume pro-
duction, and regeneration vigor. High-density IS surpassed low-
density IS in terms of carbon stored in live trees (Table 2), but to a
lesser extent in total CO2e (Table 4) because total conifer harvest
yields (Table 1) and carbon stored in wood (Table 3) were roughly
equivalent. Upfront payments for ecosystem services such as carbon
storage in live trees and wood products might allow landowners to
forego greater near-term harvest revenues (i.e., from clearcutting or
low-density IS or GS  IS) and implement high-density prescrip-
tions with equivalent long-term harvest yields plus greater revenues
from carbon. Implementing an assortment of different rehabilita-
tion treatments across the landscape would not generate as much
carbon revenue as implementing only high-density prescriptions
but would generate a steadier, sustained yield of sawlogs and resi-
dues to underpin investment in processing infrastructure. Failure
among most of our prescriptions to meet or exceed the common
practice baseline of 205.15 metric tons acre1 CO2e suggested
that this value, which also applies to highly productive coast
redwood forests, may not be appropriate for this site class and
forest type.
Our projections assumed no wildﬁre or other catastrophic dis-
turbances. This may not be realistic, especially in crowded stands.
Harvesting reduces crowding, and harvest residues and unwanted
nonmerchantable trees could be extracted using whole-tree harvest-
ing or treated using various fuels treatments to reduce risk or the
impact of wildﬁre (Stephens et al. 2009, Jain et al. 2012). Treatment
or extraction of harvest residues can be integrated into harvesting
systems (Vitorelo et al. 2011, Harrill and Han 2012) and offers
positive beneﬁts without notable impacts to other ecosystem values
(Stephens et al. 2012). In the absence of harvesting, we calculated
that SDI attained 600, the biological maximum for Douglas-ﬁr
(Reineke 1933), after only 20 years of the 100-year modeling pe-
riod. This was after modeling growth using the maximum mortality
rate adjustment in FORSEE, which does not account for sudden
oak death (Phytophthora ramorum) that is killing tanoak throughout
the region (Rizzo and Garbelotto 2003, Ramage et al. 2012). Higher
densities have been measured in old-growth mixed evergreen conifer
stands with components of coast redwood, Douglas-ﬁr, and tanoak
for which BA ranged from 525 to 700 ft2/acre and SDI ranged from
590 to 770 (Berrill et al. 2013), but we are not aware of such high
densities measured in second-growth Douglas-ﬁr/tanoak stands.
We therefore expect insect damage and disease to result in acceler-
ated tree mortality and associated increases in surface fuel loads in
the absence of harvesting (Oliver and Larson 1996). Reducing stand
density through chemical control of hardwoods does not constitute
harvesting and offered favorable carbon net gain (Table 4) at low
cost. Frill and spot spray treatments are inexpensive (Howe 2012)
and alone can be implemented without preparing a (costly) timber
harvest plan in accordance with California Forest Practice Rules.
The dead-standing hardwoods break down gradually and are re-
placed by conifers with thicker bark that is more resistant to ﬁre
(Valachovic et al. 2011, Ramage et al. 2012).
We recommend implementing all of the rehabilitation treat-
ments side-by-side to create opportunities for monitoring of
growth, yield, and carbon. These data could be used to validate
forest growth and yield models, or, if needed, reparameterize these
models or develop the next generation of growth models that better
predict carbon sequestration in carbon offset projects prescribing
uneven-aged management for forest restoration. We recommend
validation of regeneration growth models across gradients of under-
story light and belowground competition known to affect conifer
growth rates (Devine and Harrington 2008, O’Hara and Berrill
2010) because regeneration is an important component of sustained
yield in multiaged stands (O’Hara 2014) and structural diversity in
restored mixed evergreen conifer stands (Berrill et al. 2013). We also
recommend analysis of risk of carbon loss from wildﬁre under
each rehabilitation prescription using real fuels data to model ﬁre
behavior (Reinhardt and Dickinson 2010). This will help forest
owners and managers understand the tradeoffs between product
yields, ecosystem services, and wildﬁre risks and prescribe the ap-
propriate combination of treatments for their ownership and man-
agement objectives.
