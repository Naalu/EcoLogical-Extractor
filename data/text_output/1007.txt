STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING MOISTURE 
CONTENT IN FOREST RESIDUES  
AT THE HARVEST SITE 
A. R. Kizha,  H-S Han,  J. Paulson,  A. Koirala 
ABSTRACT. The moisture content (MC) of biomass derived from forest residues can pose a challenge to biomass utilization. 
It plays a significant role in determining the cost of transportation and subsequent market price. Additionally, emerging 
biomass conversion technologies, such as gasification, torrefaction, and briquetting, have very narrow specifications for 
the MC (e.g., <15%) in their feedstocks. The goal of this study was to develop strategies for reducing moisture content by 
evaluating different arrangement patterns of forest residues and its effect on MC reduction at the harvest site. The study 
compared four different arrangement patterns including criss-cross, teepees, traditional piling (processor piled), and scat-
tered residues in three different timber harvest units in northern California. Two of the arrangement patterns (criss-cross 
and processor piled) were also covered with a plastic cover. Samples were collected from each treatment using a transect 
method and were recorded for 12 months. There was an overall drop of MC from 52% (freshly cut) to 12% between all 
arrangements over the study period. The cost of construction per pile, averaged $37, $41, and $48 for teepees, criss-cross, 
and processor piles, respectively. Even though, there was no significant difference in MC reduction between piles (except 
scattered), each pile arrangement of forest residues directly affected biomass feedstock operations, logistics, and costs.

oisture content (MC) in forest residues dic-
tates several features of the feedstock includ-
ing 
transportation, 
market 
price, 
and 
utilization (Kofman and Kent 2007; Ochoa, 
2012). Woody biomass feedstock with less MC is higher 
priced. Letting wood dry for up to a year is economically 
beneficial for the biomass producer, provided that the feed-
stock is priced in terms of MC at delivery. Low MC in 
woody biomass increases the net energy conversion effi-
ciency (Roise et al. 2013). Studies showed that energy effi-
ciency of feedstock had improved by 1% for each 1% drop 
in MC above 50% and 0.5% for each 1% reduction in MC 
below 40% (Liang et al., 1996; Kim and Murphy, 2013). 
Studies in Europe have shown that storing forest residues for 
eight months can reduce the MC up to 25% and increase the 
heating value up to 4 KWh kg-1, thereby having an economic 
gain of $9-$15/bone dry ton (Erber et al., 2014). 
In the transportation phase, reducing MC allows for an 
increased amount of wood per truck load. Biomass opera-
tions contractors in western United States are usually paid 
on a bone dry ton (BDT) basis for the delivered product to 
an energy plant. Moreover, emerging biomass conversion 
technologies, such as biochar, torrefaction, and briquetting, 
can potentially enhance the economic value of the forest res-
idues; however, these technologies require low MC (e.g., 
<15%) for their feedstocks. 
FACTORS AFFECTING MOISTURE REDUCTION  
IN FOREST RESIDUE PILES 
There have been several studies done on MC associated 
with forest residues throughout the globe. Models have been 
developed to forecast MC variation under both controlled 
and in field conditions (Gautam et al., 2012; Ochoa, 2012). 
Research topic also includes the economic evaluation of the 
storage process, of which drying rates were emphasized 
(Roise et al., 2013; Erber et al., 2014). Yet another focus was 
on quantifying the drying rates using different strategies to 
reduce MC reduction, such as debarking, covering the pile, 
and comminution (Gigler et al., 2000; Filbakk et al., 2011a; 
Nurmi and Lehtimäki, 2011). Generally, favorable storing 
conditions are sunny, elevated, open, and wind-accessible 
locations (Erber et al., 2014). Walker (2006) identified seven 
key factors that affect the rate of MC reduction: 
• Relative humidity: Lower relative humidity promotes 
increased drying rate. 
• Temperature: High temperature has a positive effect 
on the moisture removal.

• Air flow: Sufficient air flow circulation on the wood 
surface helps to remove the humid air, which can then 
be replaced by drier air. 
• Moisture gradient: As the steepness of the moisture 
gradient between the wood and atmosphere increases, 
MC decreases, and diffusion rate increases, thereby in-
creasing the rate of flow of water through the wood. 
• Species: Normally, conifers dry faster than hard-
woods. 
• Initial MC of the sample. 
• Diameter: Wood with larger diameters requires more 
time to dry to a given MC, given the same atmospheric 
conditions, in comparison to wood with smaller diam-
eters. 
This study investigated the effect of arrangement patterns 
(different types of pile structures) on moisture content (MC) 
reduction during storage of forest residues at the harvesting 
site. The primary objective of this study was to assess the 
variation in MC related to the different arrangement patterns 
and storage period (i.e., time after trees were piled). The next 
objective was to understand the influence of various weather 
parameters on the forest residue drying. The study also 
looked into the operational cost of constructing these piles 
as a part of the timber harvest. 
METHODOLOGY 
STUDY SITE 
The study was conducted on three similar timber harvest 
units in Humboldt County, California (fig. 1). The timber 
harvest units were located approximately 1.6 km apart. The 
sites were about 500 to 730 m above mean sea-level with 
terrain slope up to 111% (48°). According to the Köppen 
classification, the climate of the study area was characterized 
as being Csb (Coastal Mediterranean climate), mild with a 
cool and dry summer. Summers are cool and dry, averaging 
29°C, and winters are cool and wet, averaging 8°C. On av-
erage, the region receives 1,200 mm of rain annually, mostly 
from December through April (WRRC, 2015). 
OUTLINE OF THE EXPERIMENT:  
PILE BUILDING AND SAMPLING 
The materials used to construct the forest residue piles 
were composed of processed (delimbed) and unprocessed 
tree tops, broken logs, and non-merchantable whole tree of 
coast 
redwood 
(Sequoia 
sempervirens), 
Douglas-fir 
(Pseudotsuga menziessii), western hemlock (Tsuga hetero-
phylla), and tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus). 
The trees were harvested during July of 2014. The piles 
were created in August, then stored for 11 months until July 
2015. Sampling was conducted every month prior to and af-
ter the installation of the experimental piles. The locations of 
the piles were designed as to ensure they were on the road 
side and received minimal shade throughout the day. 
The four different arrangement patterns of forest residue 
piles were (fig. 2): 
1. Teepees: The conventional way of piling forest residues 
in the region. These piles were composed of all forest res-
idues including tree-tops, chunks, branches, broken logs, 
and small-diameter trees. 
2. Processor pile (stacked pile): Uniformly arranged piles 
created by the processor with the butt-ends placed to-
gether during timber production operations. They were 
composed of delimbed tree-tops generated from pro-
cessing. Occasionally, broken logs and small diameter 
trees were also included. 
3. Criss-cross: This pile type was designed exclusively for 
the study purpose. A loader constructed the pile by laying 
the materials of each layer 90° to the one below, with the 
intention of maximizing airflow. The platforms were 
raised from the ground to allow an increased amount of 
air flow and minimize water stagnation beneath them dur-
ing a rainstorm event. The materials were predominantly 
processed (delimbed) tree-tops, broken logs and stems of 
non-merchantable species. 
4. Scattered: These were forest residues left at the harvest 
units where trees were felled and not brought to the land-
ing during the primary transportation (stump to landing). 
The materials were mostly broken logs, small diameter 
trees, and stems of non-merchantable species. 
An additional treatment, involved covering two piles 
(processor and criss-cross) entirely with plastic sheets to 
evaluate the effect of curtailing water flow during storm

piles in Humboldt County, California.

event. The plastic cover used was “all-weather polyeth-
ylene” sheets with an area of 6 × 30 m (weighed 26 kg). All 
arrangement patterns were replicated at least once (except 
for covered piles) in all the three units. 
 SAMPLING THE PILES FOR MOISTURE CONTENT 
Nine trees were felled prior to the harvest in order to de-
termine the initial MC. The trees represented all the four spe-
cies and had a diameter at breast height (dbh) ranging from 
13 to 28 cm. Samples were taken every 1 m across the hori-
zontal axis of the main stem. 
 The transect sampling method was used for collecting 
samples from the pile (fig. 3). Sampling points of the piles 
were designed such that they represented the geometric 
shape of the pile and allowed access to the point of sampling, 
without affecting the conditions of storage (Kizha and Han, 
2017). Transects were designated using timber marking 
paint and/or by hanging flagging tape in specific orientation 
at equal intervals during the construction of the stack pile. 
Materials that fell on the transect were then systematically 
selected based on the required number of samples for each 
class (e.g., diameter class, tree species, etc.) (Filbakk et al., 
2011a). For the rest of the study, the samples were collected 
from the same section of the pile. Selected wood pieces were 
cut with a chainsaw at the point of the intersection to expose 
the complete diameter to extract the wood discs (Gautam 
et al., 2012). The remaining materials that were not sampled 
were left undisturbed for future sampling. This approach en-
sured that continuous sampling was possible in natural in-
field conditions, while considering various geometries of the 
sample piles (fig. 3) (Kizha and Han, 2017). Since it was not 
physically possible to collect a sample from the middle of

some piles, sampling was carried out by cutting access points 
into the pile arrangement. Safety of the personnel operating 
the chainsaw was given utmost priority during sample col-
lection.  
Sample discs were taken every month between the 15th to 
20th at 12:00 h to 14:30 h. Sampling was not conducted on 
rainy days or days following rain fall. Wood discs were cut 
from branches of the selected wood piece with a thickness 
ranging from 2 to 5 cm by using a gasoline-powered chain 
saw (Stihl MS 290). The samples were cut at least one foot 
away from the end of the branch because wood picks up and 
loses moisture very rapidly through the end grain; a phenom-
enon known as edge effect (Reeb and Milota, 1999; Erber 
et al., 2014). Once a sample was taken from a particular 
wood piece, it was then excluded from sampling for the re-
mainder of the study. The following data were recorded dur-
ing sample collection: two diameter classes (less than and 
greater than 7.5 cm), species (hardwood and conifer), sam-
pling location (interior and exterior of pile), parts of the stem 
(small-end, middle, and large-end), and forest residue pile 
type (criss-cross, teepees, processor pile, scattered, covered 
criss-cross, and covered processor pile). For this study, the 
cut-off for diameter for the wood was 25.4 cm (10 in.) be-
cause all materials above could be potentially chipped for 
higher quality feedstock. All materials less than 25.4 cm 
(minimal diameter materials) will have to be sent to a grinder 
as a part of comminution because they could clog at the 
mouth of the chipper. 
OVEN DRYING 
Along with disc extraction, three moisture content read-
ings (one from the center and two along radii) were initially 
taken for every selected wood piece using a Delmhorst BD-
2100. However, for further MC measurements disc extrac-
tion and oven drying were used exclusively. 
The wood discs collected were initially weighed on site 
right after extraction. Later at the laboratory, the diameter 
was measured using a caliper and MC assessment proce-
dures were carried out by the oven dry method according 
ASTM standard D 2016 (ASTM, 1988). The samples were 
dried at 103°C for three days and then re-weighed. The dif-
ference in weight was the amount of water present in the 
sample. Depending on the tree species, extractives can rep-
resent a small share of this weight. Needles and twigs hold 
more extractives than stem wood (Erber et al., 2014). All 
weight measurements were recorded on an oven dry basis. 
WEATHER CONDITIONS 
The Little River weather station (Lat. 48°45.667’ N, 
Long. 91°37.683’W) located about 2 km away recorded 
daily weather data, such as ambient temperature (°C), rela-
tive air humidity (%), wind speed (km/h), wind direction (°), 
insolation and precipitation (mm) throughout the storage pe-
riod (Filbakk et al., 2011b; Kim and Murphy, 2013). The 
data was collected on an hourly basis, then averaged on a 
monthly basis to match with the timing of the MC sampling. 
COST OF CONSTRUCTING PILES 
Different forest harvesting machines were utilized for 
pile construction. While teepees and criss-cross piles were 
constructed with the loader, the processor piles were created 
during sawlog processing by the processor. The delay-free 
cycle times were calculated with detailed time study using 
standard work study techniques (Olsen et al., 1998). Ele-
mental time-motion data were recorded by a centi-minute 
stop watch. The cost and productivity was analyzed only for 
the pile construction phase and did not involve other timber 
harvesting components (table 1). Purchase prices, salvage 
values, and all other necessary information for the standard 
machine rate calculations were obtained from the timberland 
company which owned and operated the equipment (table 2). 
Diesel price was set at $1 L-1, which reflected local market 
prices during the study. Hourly machine costs in dollars per 
scheduled machine hour ($ SMH-1) were calculated using 
standard machine rate calculation methods (Miyata, 1980). 
All machineries were assumed to have 10-year economic life 
and worked 2200 scheduled machine hours (SMHs) year-1 
with a utilization set at 80%. Joint products allocation 
method was used to estimate the cost of constructing the pro-
cessor piles, as forest residues were a byproduct of the tim-
ber processing (Hudson et al., 1990; Kizha and Han 2016). 
The cost of pile construction was estimated as a product 
of the average machine hours required to construct a pile and 
hourly operating cost. 
ANALYSIS OF THE DATA 
Analysis of variance tests were carried out using the Gen-
eral Linear Model in IBM SPSS Statistical Software 2. The 
datasets were initially screened for outliers followed by 
which the null hypotheses of no significant difference in MC 
was tested for different storage periods (months) and pile ar-
rangements. Difference within the diameter class (2.5-
7.5 cm and greater than 7.5 cm) and species (hardwood and 
conifers) were tested using t-tests. Paired t-tests were used 
to test significance between MC values taken with the mois-
ture meter and the oven drying method. The experimental 
designs for all the models were full factorial design, with 
MC as the dependent variables for each. 
The data for each model was tested for normality and ho-
mogeneity of variance before conducting the analysis of var-
iance. Any significant differences in the analysis were

analyzed using post-hoc tests. Scheffe’s test was preferred 
because most of the sample populations were not similar in 
size. 
Two regression models were developed for predicting 
MC. Multivariate linear regression was performed in R Sta-
tistical package to analyze the effect of different independent 
variables, such as diameter of materials, species, type of pile, 
and number of months after initial harvesting, on MC of 
piles (R Core Team, 2016). Among these variables, type of 
pile, species, and number of months after initial harvesting 
were categorical variables. R automatically coded these var-
iables as dummy variables during regression analysis. The 
second regression analysis used monthly weather parameters 
(average temperature, average relative humidity, average 
wind speed, and total precipitation) as independent varia-
bles, along with other previous variables used for the former 
regression. However, the parameter storage month was 
dropped in this regression models to remove multicollinear-
ity with monthly weather parameters. A third model was de-
veloped for estimating factors that influenced the cost of pile 
construction based on the loader and processor’s delay-free 
cycle time (table 1). 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The study focused on evaluating drying rates of forest res-
idue in different arrangement patterns. More than 2,800 discs 
were collected from 13 piles over the 12 months of sampling. 
The average initial MC content of the freshly felled trees 
were 52% (ranging from 46% to 62%). The diameter of the 
discs sampled ranged from 2.5 to 39.4 cm, with an average 
of 11.7 cm. The thickness of the discs ranged from 2.5 to 
3.8 cm. The length of the forest residue from which the wood 
pieces were collected averaged 7.3 m and had a large-end 
diameter of 15.2 cm. The average dimensions (height × 
width × length) for the criss-cross and processor piles were 
2.5 × 8.2 × 11.3 and 2.1 × 6.7 × 9.8 m, respectively. The 
teepees were generally larger in size, with heights up to 
10.7 m. The average dimensions (height × diameter) were 
6.5 × 17 m (table 3, fig. 2). 
Initial t-test results on the MC data obtained from the 
oven-drying method and moisture meter (for the first three 
months) showed that the values were significantly different 
(p<0.001). MC measurements using moisture meters were 
not as reliable as the disc extraction techniques because 
moisture can vary greatly depending on where the measure-
ment was taken. Even if the chainsaw resulted in minor re-
duction in MC due to the heat generated during sawing, disc 
extraction is still regarded as an accurate method for MC 
measurements. Therefore, the oven drying method was 
adopted for the rest of the sampling. 
Wood discs were collected from different parts of the 
stem (small-end, middle, and large-end) in order to under-
stand the variability in MC across the length. ANOVA re-
sults indicated that there was no significant difference 
between stem parts (p=0.902), suggesting that the wood disc 
taken from any part of a particular stem would represent the 
whole stem. However, it should be noted for this study that 
the small-end and large-end discs were cut one foot from the 
exposed part. It is known that the MC tends to be higher in 
the middle of the wood piece compared to the exposed ends 
(Visser et al., 2014).   
FACTORS AFFECTING CHANGES IN MOISTURE CONTENT 
OF FOREST RESIDUE PILES 
In this study, the drop was more drastic ranging from 52% 
(fresh wood) to 12% averaged across all pile types, which 
can be attributed to the dry weather conditions during the 
study period (fig. 4). Erber et al. (2012) observed a MC re-
duction from 50% to 32% while drying a Scots pine stem 
wood pile over a 14-month period. Other studies showed 
varying results from 10% to 30% drop (Hakkila, 1962; 
Golser et al., 2005; Nurmi and Hillebrand, 2007; Röser et al., 
2011).  
MC was modeled to understand the relationship between 
MC and other variables such as diameter of the wood piece, 
month/time since harvest, species, and forest residue pile 
structures. The results are presented in several sections with 
the intention of examining each. 
Arrangement Pattern 
The monthly moisture content for each pile was consid-
ered to be the average of the MC for the wood disks collected 
from different transects. Largely, there were no significant 
differences in MC between the various pile structure in dif-
ferent units (p=0.310). However, the processor pile of Unit 3 
had a significant difference from the rest (p=0.001) during 
the initial months. Later investigations showed that the par-
ticular pile was located on the edge of the unit and was 
shaded by neighboring trees during later parts of the day. 
There were no significant differences in MC between the 
arrangement patterns, except for scattered (p=0.231). The in-
creased drying rates for scattered can be explained due to 
more surface area being exposed to the elements, compared

to the other pile structures. The wood materials collected 
from the interior of the pile tended to have lower moisture 
content than the ones toward the outside. These results are 
consistent to those obtained in other studies (Casal et al., 
2010). 
Storage Period 
The average MC for the forest residues prior to pile con-
struction was 33% (ranging from 12% to 76%). This was ap-
proximately a 19% drop from the time trees were felled to 
the pile construction (after one month). The MC losses due 
to storage were highest in the beginning of the storage period 
(July and August 2014) (fig. 4). Once a tree is felled, green 
wood loses moisture quickly as it loses free water. In this 
study another reason for the high drying rate was the high 
temperature during these initial months. Gradually, equilib-
rium of the MC reduction is attained with the temperature 
and relative humidity. Thereafter the rate of drying is re-
duced (Gautam et al., 2012). 
ANOVA results showed that there was a significant dif-
ference in the MC between the months (p<0.001). Post-hoc 
tests revealed that the differences were between each season 
(sub-group). No significant difference existed within the 
sub-groups, which suggests that the average MC of the forest 
residues dropped during the period of storage (fig. 4). July 
and August 2014 (Month 1 and 2) could be placed under one 
sub-group having the highest loss in MC (from 52% to 33%). 
Free water from the freshly felled trees was likely lost in this 
season. October through March would be another sub-group 
with no significant difference in moisture loss, between the 
months. In this sub-group the wood materials had attained 
equilibrium with the surrounding environment. May to June 
2015 showed the next drop in MC, which could be attributed 
to the high temperature during the period. These three stor-
age period sub-groups were significantly different from each 
other (p<0.001). 
Species 
Both models developed for factoring MC showed that di-
ameter was a contributing factor. There was significant dif-
ference between the species (p<0.001). Gautam et al. (2012) 
explained this as the difference between the chemical com-
position and anatomical structure for hardwood and soft-
wood species. Hardwood species having 25% to 40% 
hemicellulose, as opposed to 20% to 30% in conifers, tend 
to bond more with water because hemicellulose is the most 
hygroscopic component of cell wall. Furthermore, the cell 
walls of hardwoods generally have more potential bonding 
sites for water than conifers. 
Diameter of Wood Piece 
T-tests showed that there was a significant difference be-
tween the two groups (p=0.028) in MC between the two di-
ameter class: 2.5 to 7.5 cm and 7.5 to 25.4 cm. Larger-sized 
wood (average of 28%) tends to hold more water when com-
pared to smaller wood pieces (average of 24%). Visser et al. 
(2014) explained the reason for the faster drying rate in two 
parts: the smaller wood piece has a larger surface area to 
mass ratio and a reduced distance between the log center and 
its surface, which meant water potentially traveled less in or-
der to evaporate. 
Covering the Piles 
Unlike other studies that showed a decrease in MC for the 
covered pile (Erber et al., 2014), no significant reduction was 
observed in MC reduction between the covered and uncov-
ered piles at the end of study frame. Röser et al. (2011) also

rates between covered and uncovered piles for certain por-
tion of their study. The potential reason in this study might 
be a) the exceptional dry season during the period, which 
dropped MC across all arrangement patterns; and b) a single 
replicate might not have been able to capture the variation. 
Weather Parameters 
Target variables to predict MC were limited to those that 
are closely related, among which the local weather condi-
tions plays a prominent role. The weather data was averaged 
for each month, as MC sampling was done on a monthly ba-
sis. As month (variable) was highly correlated with weather 
data, two models were built using each separately. Results 
showed all parameter included in the “month” models had a 
better coefficient of determination than the model including 
weather did (R2=0.38 and 0.26, respectively). The month 
models’ higher correlation could be attributed to averaging 
weather parameter over the month. All contributing varia-
bles for both models were significant (p<0.001), except for 
total monthly precipitation (for weather model). 
Cost of Pile Construction 
On an average, it took a loader 18 and 16 min (with a 
range of 5 to 32 and 6 to 31 min) to construct criss-cross and 
teepees at a cost of $41 and $37, respectively. Teepees, 
which used all forest residue within the stand, largely left the 
harvested unit more cleared than criss-cross, as the latter 
only used tree tops. The loader also had difficulty in han-
dling criss-cross piles during future activities (such as com-
minution), due to wood pieces tangling between layers. The 
processor pile was built on an average of 21 min by the pro-
cessor and at a cost of $48. The forest residues was assumed 
to have a “free ride” up to the landing along with the mer-
chantable sawlogs, therefore the cost only represents the cost 
of pile construction. 
There was no cost incurred with the scattered treatment 
during the harvesting operation. However, collection of 
these forest residues will require machine re-entry, which 
can significantly increase the cost of storage, compared to 
the rest. From a managerial point of view, these forest resi-
dues left at the harvested unit can pose increased fire risk. 
Forest residue accumulation also minimizes the area availa-
ble for re-planting (Michael Alcorn, Green Diamond Com-
pany, personal communication, 15 June 2014). 
In general, the cost of pile construction depended on a 
various factors, including the amount of forest residues 
available, the spread of forest residues within the unit, dis-
tance to the road, slope, and accessibility to the site. The re-
gression model developed to analyze the influential factors 
on the delay-free cycle time (productive machine hours) 
showed that number of pieces handled and unit (dummy var-
iable) as significant contribution factors for the loader. For 
the processor piles, the number of processed pieces, species, 
and diameter were the prominent contributors to cost (ta-
ble 4). The regression model predicted more variance for the 
processor compared to loader.  
It took a three crew half a day to cover three piles. Tee-
pees were too large and unsafe to cover. Additionally, forest 
piles were only covered for piles which were meant to be 
comminuted for higher valued end products. 
PILE ARRANGEMENTS AND ITS IMPACT  
ON FOREST MANAGEMENT 
Storage of the forest residue for up to a year prior to uti-
lization has been proven to be economical (Erber et al., 
2016). Storage reduces MC, thereby increasing the value of 
the forest residues. In this study, there was an average reduc-
tion in MC from 52% (fresh cut) to 12% (July, 2015). Be-
cause the secondary transportation component of the 
biomass feedstock accounts for almost half of the total pro-
duction costs (McDonald et al., 2001; Kizha et al., 2015), 
this practice ensures that the maximum amount of material 
can be transported per load (Ronnqvist et al., 1998; McDon-
ald et al., 2001). However, storage of the material will tie up 
capital costs and take up land area for replanting (Filbakk et 
al., 2011b). For this region, a three-month storage period 
would be recommended, as the wood material loses free wa-
ter during this phase. The harvesting season also influences 
MC retention. For example, wood harvested during winter 
operation (rainy season) would have minimal water loss 
compared to harvest in dry summer months. 
As there was no significant difference in MC between the 
arrangement patterns, other forest management benefits as-
sociated with the different arrangement patterns were evalu-
ated. Criss-cross and processor piles had minimal amounts 
of inorganic contamination (such as soil and rock particles) 
compared to teepees and scattered arrangement. Therefore,

they could be potentially chipped, rather than ground, to pro-
duce evenly sized feedstocks which is higher quality and can 
be utilized in a biomass conversion technology such as gas-
ification, torrefaction, and briquetting. The teepees, on the 
other hand, had a large variation of material sizes, ranging 
from foliage to unmerchentable whole trees and chunks. 
This could only be ground because separating the tops and 
stem wood from them would make the operation economi-
cally infeasible. The soil contaminations were also very high 
for the teepee piles. These piles were comparatively easier 
to burn when compared to scattered forest residues and also 
reduced the risk of forest fire spill outs during burning ses-
sions. Furthermore, piled forest residues can be more effi-
ciently burned under adverse weather conditions, thereby 
reducing the quantity of smoke emitted. Lastly, piled forest 
residues can be burned (for disposal) with fewer staff present 
(Wright et al., 2010). Teepees also tended to clean the har-
vest sites better than the rest as a part of site preparation for 
replanting. This was because the teepees collected all the for-
est residues from the vicinity, while the processor and the 
criss-cross piles only took the tree-tops. 
CONCLUSION 
The effect of storage on the MC of forest residue piled 
under natural climatic conditions prevalent in the Pacific 
North coast for 11 months (excluding one month prior to pil-
ing) showed that the MC of forest residues decreased with 
storage time. The highest drying rate was observed for the 
initial months of storing and as time passed the drying rate 
was in equilibrium with the atmospheric conditions. There 
was no significant difference in MC reduction between three 
of the four arrangement patterns (criss-cross, processor pile, 
and teepees). However, these three were different from scat-
tered treatment.
