Summary
1. Mycorrhizae form a critical link between above-ground plants and the soil system by
inﬂuencing plant nutrition, nutrient cycling and soil structure. Understanding how
mycorrhizae respond to disturbances may lead to important advances in interpreting
above-ground plant recovery.
2. The inoculum potential for arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) and ectomycorrhizal
(EM) fungi was investigated in thinned-only, thinned and prescribed burned (both
restoration treatments) and unthinned and unburned control stands in northern Arizona
ponderosa pine forests. The relationships between mycorrhizal fungal propagule
densities and plant community and soil properties were quantiﬁed.
3. The relative amount of infective propagules of AM fungi was signiﬁcantly higher in
samples collected from both restoration treatments than their paired controls
(unthinned and unburned stands). In contrast, the same restoration treatments had no
signiﬁcant effect on the relative amount of infective propagules of EM fungi.
4. The relative amount of infective propagules of AM fungi was signiﬁcantly positively
correlated with graminoid cover and herbaceous understorey species richness and
negatively correlated with overstorey tree canopy cover and litter cover.
5. Synthesis and applications. These results indicate that population densities of AM
fungi can rapidly increase following restoration treatments in northern Arizona pon-
derosa pine forests. This has important implications for restoring the herbaceous under-
storey of these forests because most understorey plants depend on AM associations for
normal growth. These results also can be applied to other ecosystems that are in a state
of restoration or where the role of ﬁre is just beginning to be understood.
Key-words: disturbance, ecological restoration, ecosystem function, ectomycorrhizae,
succession.

Introduction
Prior to Euro-American settlement in the 1880s, pon-
derosa pine Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws. forests in
the American south-west were characterized by herba-
ceous understoreys dominated by grasses intermixed
with large trees (Cooper 1960). Low-intensity grass-fuelled
ﬁres every 2–20 years played a major role in determining
the structure, composition and stability of these ecosystems
(Fulé, Covington & Moore 1997). Euro-American settlers
drastically changed these forest ecosystems through
heavy livestock grazing, intensive logging of old-growth
trees and ﬁre suppression. Today these forests are often
characterized by a large number of small trees with
closed canopies, deep deposits of dead organic material
on soil surfaces, and little herbaceous understorey.
Efforts are currently underway to reverse structural
and functional ecosystem changes caused by historical
land management practices. The aim is to restore eco-
system diversity by returning ponderosa pine forests to
a more open savanna-like structure and reintegrating
the natural disturbance regime of ﬁre (Covington &
Moore 1994). Tree thinning and prescribed burning are
two major components of this restoration effort.
A major objective for ponderosa pine forest restora-
tion is to increase herbaceous understorey diversity

and production to levels that emulate reference condi-
tions (Covington et al. 1997). Mycorrhizae are a criti-
cal link between above-ground plants and the soil
system, playing an important role in plant nutrition,
nutrient cycling and the development of soil structure
(Allen 1991; Smith & Read 1997). Many tree species
are highly dependent on ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi
(Mikola 1970) and most herbaceous plants are associ-
ated with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi (Smith,
Charvat & Jacobson 1998). Consequently, numerous
researchers have suggested a relationship between the
recovery time of disturbed ecosystems and the abund-
ance of infective propagules of mycorrhizal fungi (Reeves
et al. 1979; Allen & Allen 1980; Bentivenga & Hetrick
1991; Noyd, Pﬂeger & Russelle 1995; Gange, Lindsay
& Ellis 1999). In addition, Perry et al. (1989) refer to
the strong link between plants and the soil biota as the
‘bootstrapping hypothesis’. This hypothesis suggests
that through close mutual interactions some ecosystems
are able literally to pull themselves up by their own ‘boot-
straps’, thus creating conditions to allow the system to
persist over time (Perry et al. 1989). These authors showed
that mycorrhizae helped facilitate succession following
natural wildﬁres, where different species of plants formed
mutualistic relationships with the same fungi through-
out succession in forests in the north-western USA.
Other studies suggest that the role of mycorrhizae in
facilitating succession may be dependent on the nutri-
ent status of soil (Allen & Allen 1990). Because ponde-
rosa pines are strongly EM and many of the native
understorey grasses and forbs are strongly AM, we pre-
dicted that densities of AM fungal propagules should
increase and EM fungal propagules should decrease in
response to restoration thinning and prescribed burn-
ing in ponderosa pine forests. The speciﬁc objectives of
this study were to: (i) quantify the effect of restoration
thinning, and thinning and prescribed burning, on AM
and EM fungal propagule densities; and (ii) assess the
relationships between mycorrhizal fungal propagule
densities and plant community and soil properties.

This research was conducted at two sites: the Fort
Valley Experimental Forest and adjacent areas near
Flagstaff, Arizona (hereafter referred to as Fort Valley),
and the Mt Trumbull Resource Conservation Area
north-west of Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona
(hereafter referred to as Mt Trumbull), USA. Two
experimental blocks were established during the sum-
mer of 1998 at Fort Valley and four experimental
blocks were established during the summer of 1999 at
Mt Trumbull. Treatment stands, each c. 16 ha, were
randomly assigned within each block. Treatments at
Fort Valley were (i) no thinning or burning (control)
and (ii) thinning to a low level of replacement trees
based upon pre-settlement tree densities. Thinning
treatments at Fort Valley received prescribed burning
treatments following the sampling for this study during
the summer of 2001. Treatments at Mt Trumbull were
randomly assigned the same two treatments with the
addition of prescribed burning to thinning. Speciﬁc details
of the thinning treatments at Fort Valley are outlined
in Fulé et al. (2001a) and speciﬁc details of the thinning
treatments at Mt Trumbull are outlined in Fulé et al.
(2001b). Twenty systematically located permanent
plots were located in each stand at Fort Valley and Mt
Trumbull. At each of these permanent plots we sampled
herbaceous understorey and overstorey tree composition
and abundance, fuel loads and tree canopy cover.
  
At Fort Valley, soil samples were randomly taken from
10 of the 20 systematically placed plots along a 50-m
transect within each of the four stands (2 blocks × 2
treatments) in late May 1999, 6 months after thinning,
and again in May 2000, 18 months after thinning. At
Mt Trumbull soil samples were randomly taken from
10 of the 20 systematically placed plots along a 50-m
transect within each of the eight stands (4 blocks × 2
treatments) in late June 2000, 5 months after thinning
and 3 months after burning. Two samples 20 m along
each transect (one for the AM bioassay and one for the
EM bioassay) were taken and placed immediately into
4 × 20-cm diameter deep Conetainers (Stuewe and
Sons Inc., Corvallis, Oregon USA) for bait-plant bio-
assays (Brundrett & Abbott 1994). Soils were collected
to a depth of 15 cm using a hand trowel. We took
samples to this depth because AM fungal propagule
densities are generally highest in the surface 15 cm
(Smith & Walker 1981). A third sample was taken at the
same location for soil chemical analyses. This sample
was frozen until it was analysed.

At Fort Valley, we recorded pre-treatment data for the
herbaceous understorey, overstorey tree composition
and abundance, fuel loads and tree canopy cover in
1998. Post-thinning treatment data were collected in
1999 and 2000. These data were not signiﬁcantly differ-
ent between the 2 years; therefore, only post-treatment
data from 2000 is presented because it is further
along the restoration trajectory. At Mt Trumbull, we
recorded pre-treatment data for the herbaceous under-
storey, overstorey tree composition and abundance,
fuel loads and tree canopy cover in 1999. Post-treatment
data was collected in 2000.
We surveyed the herbaceous and shrub understorey
community along the same 50-m transects where soil
samples were collected for AM and EM bioassays and
soil chemical analyses. Every 30 cm along the 50-m
transect, for a total of 166 points, substrate (plant, litter,
soil, wood, rock) was recorded. If the substrate was
a plant, the species was identiﬁed and its height was

recorded. We determined plant cover by dividing the
number of plant hits by 166 points for each transect.
Overstorey tree data were collected in 400-m2 circular
plots centred on each plot centre. Tree species and
diameter at breast height (d.b.h., 1·37 m) were recorded
for all live and dead trees greater than 1·37 m in height.
In addition, at the same 30-cm intervals along the
50-m transect, tree canopy cover and ﬁre severity in areas
treated with prescribed burning were recorded. We
determined tree canopy cover by recording the pres-
ence or absence of a tree canopy from a vertical pro-
jection. Fire severity was determined based upon
descriptions in the Western Regional Fire Monitoring
Handbook (National Park Service 1992). Areas with
charred litter, duff (the fermentation and humus layers
of the forest ﬂoor) and wood were recorded as lightly
burned areas, areas with litter mostly consumed, duff
deeply burned and wood recognizable were recorded as
moderately burned areas, and areas with litter and duff
consumed leaving white ash and soil often reddish were
recorded as severely burned. We used a 15-m planar
transect located in a random direction from the plot
centre to measure forest ﬂoor litter and duff depths.
Every 1·5 m, litter and duff were recorded following
guidelines outlined in Brown (1974).

Bait-plant bioassays are designed to detect all types of
viable mycorrhizal fungal propagules including spores,
fragments of mycorrhizal roots and extraradical
hyphae. This method quantiﬁes total mycorrhizal
fungi more accurately than direct counts of sporocarps,
spores or colonized root lengths (Brundrett & Abbott
1994; Johnson, O’Dell & Bledsoe 1999). We used a corn
Zea mays L. bioassay to determine the relative amount of
infective propagules of AM fungi and a ponderosa pine
bioassay to determine the relative amount of infective
propagules of EM fungi. Corn is mycotrophic with
many species of AM fungi and grows rapidly and uni-
formly; these advantages outweigh the disadvantage
of not using a native host-plant (Johnson, O’Dell &
Bledsoe 1999). Plants were placed in a greenhouse and
watered every 3 days until they were harvested at
6 weeks. Because pine seedlings grow more slowly than
corn seedlings, pine seedlings were harvested at
12 weeks to determine inoculum potential. Roots were
carefully washed free from the soil and weighed. Fol-
lowing mycorrhizal analysis, roots were oven-dried at
70 °C for 24 h and then reweighed. Shoot lengths and
dry root and shoot weights were also measured. Corn
roots were prepared for AM analysis by cutting roots
into 2·5-cm segments, taking a random subsample of
the cut roots of a known mass, clearing roots in 5%
potassium hydroxide, and then staining with trypan
blue in lactoglycerin (Koske & Gemma 1990). The
gridline intersect method using a dissecting microscope
was used to measure the proportion of root length
containing AM fungal structures: arbuscules, vesicles,
coils, internal mycorrhizal hyphae and external mycor-
rhizal hyphae (Giovannetti & Mosse 1980). We meas-
ured pine roots for fungal propagule density through
direct examination using a dissecting microscope to
quantify the proportion of root tips colonized with EM
fungi (Gehring & Whitham 1991). Root tips were
classiﬁed either as a living or dead EM tip or a living or
dead non-mycorrhizal tip. Different morphological
types and colours were also recorded.

Soil samples from each transect were analysed for pH,
total N, total P and organic C at the Bilby Research Soil
Analysis Laboratory, Flagstaff, Arizona, USA. Soil
pH was determined in a 1 : 1 slurry by pH meter. Total
N and P were measured using a Kjeldahl digestion of
the soil material followed with the analysis of N and P
by automated colorimetry using a Technicon auto-
analyser (Pulse Instrumentation, Saskatoon, SK, Canada)
(Parkinson & Allen 1975). Organic C was determined
by loss on ignition. Samples were heated in crucibles
for 24 h in a mufﬂe furnace at 425 °C and organic mat-
ter was estimated from net weight loss.

Multivariate analysis of variance () repeated
measures was used to determine the effects of thinning-
only on mycorrhizal propagule densities for data col-
lected in 1999 and 2000, with time and treatment as the
two main variables in the analysis. We used analysis of
variance () for a randomized block design in SPSS
version 8 (SAS Institute 1997) to determine the effect
of thinning-only and thinning and prescribed burning
on vegetation, soil properties and the proportion of AM
fungal structures for the 2000 data.  was also used
to determine the effect of thinning and prescribed
burning on mycorrhizal propagule densities. Signiﬁcance
for analysis of variance tests was accepted at alpha =
0·05. The Shapiro–Wilks test was used to test data for
normality and Leven’s test was used to test for homo-
geneity of the variance (Milliken & Johnson 1984).
Root infection data were angular transformed prior to
analysis. Herbaceous plant abundance, graminoid cover
and soil properties were square-root transformed to
improve normality and homoscedasticity assumptions
(Zar 1984). Multiple regression was used to determine
the relationship between infectivity and plant and com-
munity properties. Simple correlation analysis was used
to determine the relationship between root infectivity
and bait plant characteristics (length and weight).

and site characteristics at the Fort Valley study site
(1998) or at the Mt Trumbull study site (1999) (Tables 1
and 2). Following thinning treatments, there were sig-
niﬁcantly less trees per hectare and tree canopy cover in
the thinned-only and thinned and prescribed burned
units than their respective controls (Tables 1 and 2). At
the Fort Valley study site, there were approximately 182
trees ha−1 in the thinned-only units and 1426 trees ha−1
in the paired controls. At the Mt Trumbull study site,
there were approximately 336 trees ha−1 in thinned and
prescribed burn units compared with 2193 trees ha−1 in
the paired controls. Although the average herbaceous
cover tended to be higher in treated units than in con-
trol units, the differences were not signiﬁcant (Table 1).
The herbaceous plant communities in the experimental
units at Fort Valley were dominated by graminoids
followed by non-legume forbs, legumes and woody
shrubs. Similar abundance patterns were present at Mt
Trumbull except there were more legumes than non-
legume forbs. Sedges Carex spp. dominated the herba-
ceous cover for both study sites along with C3 (a plant
that produces a three-carbon molecule during photo-
synthesis) grasses, including squirreltail Elymus
elymoides (Raﬁnesque) Swezey and muttongrass Poa
fendleriana (Steudel) Vasey. Mountain muhley Muh-
lenbergia montana (Nuttall) Hitchcock was the only
abundant C4 (a plant that produces a four-carbon
molecule during photosynthesis) grass in the experimental
units at Fort Valley and it was consistently less common
than the abundant C3 grasses. There were no abundant
C4 grasses in the experimental units at Mt Trumbull.
Approximately 21% of the area remained unburned
following prescribed burning at Mt Trumbull (Table 3).
Of the area that burned, approximately 20% was lightly
burned, 38% moderately burned and 21% severely
burned. There were no signiﬁcant differences between
soil properties in the treated and control units
(Table 4). However, at both sites organic C and total N
levels appeared to be higher in both treated units in
comparison with their paired controls, and total P
was slightly higher in the thinned and prescribed
burned units at Mt Trumbull than their controls,

Mycorrhizal fungi colonized all bait-plants and colo-
nization levels were inﬂuenced by restoration treat-
ments at both sites. At Fort Valley infective propagule
densities of AM fungi were signiﬁcantly higher in the
thinned units than their paired controls for both study
years (Tables 5 and 6). Infective propagule densities of
AM fungi at Mt Trumbull were signiﬁcantly higher in
soils from the thinned and prescribed burned units in
comparison with their paired controls (F = 39·13,
P = 0·008; Table 7). Corn bioassay plants grown in the
Fort Valley thinned-only soils had signiﬁcantly more
vesicles and less hyphae than corn grown in their paired
control soils (F = 2·1601, P = 0·05; F = 5·4437, P =

between the relative proportion of AM fungal struct-
ures in the Mt Trumbull thinned and prescribed burned
soils and their controls (Fig. 1b). Unlike the AM
fungi, there was no signiﬁcant difference in the rel-
ative amount of infective propagules of EM fungi in
samples collected from treated units in comparison
with their controls for 1999 and 2000 at Fort Valley

(Tables 5 and 6) or at Mt Trumbull in 2000 (F = 1·077,
P = 0·3394; Table 7). Sparsely branched bifurcated tips
were the dominant EM morphotype for all stands.
AM colonization of the corn bait plants was not
correlated with corn shoot weight or corn root weight
(r2 = −0·037 and r = 0·031, P = 0·05). EM colonization
of the pine bait plants was not correlated with pine
shoot weight (r2 = 0·11, P = 0·74) but was positively
correlated with pine root weight (r2 = 0·28, P = 0·04).
For all 14 study units combined, about 85% of the
variance of AM infectivity was explained by graminoid
cover (square-root cover) and tree canopy cover
(F = 13·12, P = 0·0009; Table 8). In contrast, for all
study units combined, trees per hectare, tree canopy
cover or litter cover did not explain the variance of EM
infectivity (F = 0·101, P = 0·9573; Table 8).
Discussion
During the ﬁrst 2 years, restoration treatments had no
signiﬁcant effect on the overall cover of herbaceous
AM plants, even though plant cover did increase in the
restoration treatments. AM abundance was highly cor-
related with grass cover and therefore areas with higher
grass cover (restoration treatments) also had higher
propagule densities of AM fungi. Contrary to our
expectations, restoration treatments did not change
EM propagule densities, illustrating that even though
their host-plant density was signiﬁcantly reduced, EM
fungi are able to maintain viable propagules for at least
2 years following thinning and 1 year following thin-
ning and prescribed burning. Other studies have shown
variable affects of tree thinning on EM fungal densities,
depending on the disturbance intensity. For example,
clear-cutting a Douglas-ﬁr Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.)
Franco forest in western Montana signiﬁcantly reduced
the number of EM roots and affected adjacent uncut
stands for at least 7·6 m into the stand (Harvey, Jurgensen
& Larsen 1980). In contrast, pre-disturbance popu-
lation densities of EM fungi were maintained for
2 years after clear-cutting an aspen Populus tremuloides
Michaux stand (Visser, Maynard & Danielson 1998).
Prescribed ﬁre also has varied effects on EM fungi,
ranging from dramatic reductions in propagule den-
sities and diversity after intense wildﬁres (Visser 1995)
to no signiﬁcant changes (Baar et al. 1999). A study
of a low intensity wildﬁre showed little change in
EM fungal composition or densities (Jonsson et al. 1999).
This study suggested that if the organic layer, where
EM mycelia are concentrated, remains largely un-
damaged, then ﬁre would have little or no impact on
EM fungi. This explanation may account for the lack
of changes in EM fungal propagule densities to restora-
tion thinning and thinning and prescribed burning in
this study, or there may have been a shift in the source
of inoculum or species composition that we were unable
to detect. Some studies have detected spores and

sclerotia as the dominant inoculum-types following
burning and there is a shift at a high taxonomic level
from basidiomycetes to ascomycetes post-ﬁre (Baar et al.
1999; Grogan, Baar & Bruns 2000).
In contrast to EM fungi, AM fungi responded rap-
idly to restoration treatments in northern Arizona pine
forests. Propagule densities of AM fungi signiﬁcantly
increased by an average of 20% in thinned-only and in
thinned and burned units compared with control units.
Two main processes control population densities of
mycorrhizal fungi following disturbance: immigration
of new propagules from nearby areas and survival
and spread of residual propagules (Warner, Allen &
MacMahon 1987). Rapid colonization of AM fungi has
been illustrated in other studies. Gould, Hendrix &
Ferriss (1996) found that AM propagule densities
increased signiﬁcantly within 9 months of mining
reclamation and increased 10-fold the following spring
after seeding. Similarly, Johnson & McGraw (1988)
found that taconite tailings that were initially devoid of
AM fungi were colonized within weeks of reclamation
seeding. It was hypothesized that spores were trans-
ferred to the reclaimed tailings by both biotic (animals)
and abiotic (wind and water) vectors (Johnson &
McGraw 1988).
In the present study, it is likely that AM fungi spread
from pre-existing mycorrhizal hyphae in living and
dead plant roots. These live and dead root systems and
their mutualistic mycorrhizal associations represent
the mechanism for the bootstrapping hypothesis (Perry
et al. 1989). The persistence of these associations under
unrestored conditions (dense, closed forest canopies
and high fuel loads) and their ability to respond rapidly
to tree removal and prescribed ﬁre suggests that AM
associations may facilitate succession of this commu-
nity to its previous dominance of herbaceous AM
hosts. A study by Kovacic, St John & Dyer (1984)
found that AM hosts and AM fungal abundance were
signiﬁcantly higher in mountain pine beetle Dendroc-
tonus ponderosae Hopk.-killed ponderosa pine stands
than under live ponderosa pine stands in northern
Colorado. While mountain pine beetle outbreaks can
be of epidemic proportions, their outcome in reducing
live tree stand densities promotes changes in below-
ground AM fungal densities and above-ground herba-
ceous production. Other studies in different ecosystems
have also shown changes in AM propagule densities
with changes in tree densities. A successional study of
AM propagule densities across a grassland to forest
chronosequence showed AM inoculum potential
increased with increasing grass cover and decreased in
later successional sites with EM trees (Johnson et al.
1991). Similarly, a study by Benjamin, Anderson &
Liberta (1989) illustrated that herbaceous plants had
lower AM colonization as tree density and shading
increased, possibly because these plants had insufﬁ-
cient photosynthetic capability to support AM infection.
Soil disturbance has been reported to reduce AM
propagule densities generally due to the destruction of
the hyphal network during the break-up of the soil
macrostructure (Reeves et al. 1979; Fairchild & Miller
1988). Consequently, one might predict that propagule
densities should decrease following tree thinning, due
to soil disturbance from mechanized logging equip-
ment. This effect was not observed in our study, which
indicates that either soil disturbance was not severe
enough to have destroyed AM fungal propagules, that
the sites were rapidly colonized by AM fungal spores
and residual hyphae, or that the bioassay method may
have missed any reduction. Because sunlight and
photosynthetic capacity is greater in thinned stands,
herbaceous host root densities probably increased with
tree removal, which in turn would allow the herbaceous
plant community to support more hyphae. Rives et al.
(1980) also found no reduction in population densities
of AM fungi following soil disturbance. It has been
suggested that AM propagule densities in seasonal
grasslands may be relatively tolerant of disturbance
because their AM fungal communities produce high
densities of perennating spores (Jasper, Abbott &
Robson 1991).
Prescribed ﬁre has variable effects on AM propagule
densities, ranging from decreased AM propagule
densities (Klopatek, Debano & Klopatek 1988; Dhillion
& Anderson 1993), to no change (Anderson & Menges
1997; Rashid et al. 1997) to increases in AM propagule
densities (Bentivenga & Hetrick 1991). Similar to soil
disturbance, the effect of prescribed ﬁre on AM prop-
agules is highly dependent on the disturbance intensity.
Because ﬁre intensity can span three orders of magni-
tude (Pyne, Andrews & Laven 1996), soil is not heated
uniformly during prescribed burns and therefore soil
samples from burned areas are likely to contain highly
variable levels of AM fungi, making the assessment of
ﬁre on AM fungi difﬁcult. In our study, similar vari-
ance in the inoculum potential of soils from thinned-
only and thinned-burned units suggests that these
forests were not signiﬁcantly affected by prescribed
ﬁres, which were mostly low-intensity burns of short dura-
tion. Approximately 40% of the Mt Trumbull study
area was lightly burned or remained unburned follow-
ing prescribed ﬁre and approximately 38% was only
moderately burned. At the Fort Valley study site, a
stand that was treated with thinning and a low-intensity
burn of short duration showed a 22% increase in AM
propagule densities similar to the increases found at
Mt Trumbull (J. E. Korb, unpublished data). In con-
trast, high-intensity burns of long duration in slash pile
burning at the Fort Valley study site signiﬁcantly
reduced AM propagule densities by 98% (Korb 2001).
Simulated laboratory ﬁres have shown that heating
ﬁeld soil above 80 °C almost completely eliminates AM
fungi (Pattinson et al. 1999). Understanding the max-
imum soil temperature and duration that AM fungi
can withstand at different soil depths will be crucial to
understanding the effects of prescribed ﬁre on AM
fungi propagule densities in south-western ponderosa
pine forest restoration.

Some evidence suggests that ponderosa pine under-
storey communities prior to the mid-1880s were domi-
nated by warm-season (C4) grasses, which are often
strongly mycotrophic (Cooper 1960; Pearson, Mann &
Howard 1971; Wilson & Hartnett 1998). However,
current ponderosa pine forests are dominated by species
that often form no mycorrhizal associations (e.g. Carex
geophila) or C3 grasses that are often weakly myco-
trophic (Wilson & Hartnett 1998). These forests will
probably continue to lack productive understorey
communities, unless treatments are implemented that
favour herbaceous host-plants and AM fungi by reduc-
ing tree canopy cover and litter cover. Noyd, Pﬂeger &
Russelle (1995) demonstrated that strongly myco-
trophic C4 grasses big bluestem Andropogon gerardii
Vitman and little bluestem Schizachyrium scoparium
(Michaux) Nash were unable to grow or survive as
seedlings in soil where AM fungi were eliminated, but
establishment of the C3 grass Canada wild rye Elymus
canadensis L. was unaffected by AM fungi availability.
Similarly, Hetrick et al. (1994) found that C4 grasses
were competitively superior to C3 grasses when grown
in the presence of AM fungi, but C3 grasses were com-
petitively superior in soils without AM fungi. As a
result, one can predict that increased populations of
AM fungi in the thinned-only and thinned and pre-
scribed burned restoration stands may assist in the
replacement of weakly mycotrophic species by strongly
mycotrophic species, thereby increasing C4 grass cover
and leading to the maintenance of mycorrhizal-
compatible species (Francis & Read 1994; Johnson 1998).
Enhancing AM propagules does not always result in
a favourable community, as shown in a study by
Marler, Zabinski & Callaway (1999) where AM fungi
enhanced the competitive superiority of spotted knap-
weed Centaurea maculosa Lam. over a native bunch-
grass. In addition, our results suggest that restoration
thinning may have caused a shift in the species com-
position of the AM fungal community at the Fort Valley
study site, where taxa that form abundant vesicles
increased in the thinned treatments, while they did not
increase at the Mt Trumbull study site even though the
proportion of vesicles in the controls at these two sites
were similar. These changes in AM species may directly
inﬂuence above-ground plant community composition
and structure because taxa of AM fungi differ greatly
in their effects on plant ﬁtness. Speciﬁcally, species of
the Gigasporaceae family do not form vesicles and
therefore an increase in vesicles could suggest a reduc-
tion in AM species of this taxon or an increase in other
species that do readily form vesicles. Future studies of
AM in ponderosa pine restoration areas will require
analysis of the species composition of the fungal com-
munities to determine if a shift in the fungal com-
munity is occurring in response to restoration treatments,
and whether these shifts impact the plant community
composition.
Recent research in a variety of environments has
shown that mycorrhizal interactions may be important
determinants of plant diversity, ecosystem variability
and productivity (van der Heijden et al. 1998a,b;
Hartnett & Wilson 1999; Klironomos et al. 2000).
Host-plant species composition inﬂuences AM fungal
species composition (Johnson, Tilman & Wedin 1992;
Bever et al. 1996; Eom, Hartnett & Wilson 2000),
which provides evidence for current feedback models
between soil communities and plant community struc-
ture (Bever, Westover & Antonovics 1997). Future
studies of ponderosa pine restoration treatment areas
are needed to more fully understand responses of AM
fungal communities and assess feedback between AM
fungal and plant communities. Our results indicate that
AM propagule densities respond rapidly to thinning
and prescribed burning in south-western ponderosa
pine restoration treatments. This has important implica-
tions for land managers trying to restore the herbaceous
understorey of these forests because most understorey
plants depend upon AM associations for normal growth.
