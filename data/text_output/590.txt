Summary
1. More than a century of forest management, including ﬁre exclusion, livestock grazing
and tree harvesting, may have affected forest structure and composition in south-western
USA. Dendroecological techniques were used to reconstruct an 1876 baseline against
which modern conditions could be compared. We assessed the magnitude of changes on
the San Francisco Peaks in ﬁve distinct forest types: ponderosa, mixed conifer, aspen,
spruce–ﬁr and bristlecone.
2. We established a systematic grid of 135 plots, each 0·1 ha in size, over a 1117-m
altitudinal band.
3. In the contemporary forest, density was greatest in spruce–ﬁr and least in bristlecone
whereas basal area was greatest in spruce–ﬁr and lowest in ponderosa. In 1876, all forest
types had signiﬁcantly lower densities and basal areas.
4. The period since 1876 was associated with increased forest density, a shift in species
composition as a result of invasion of shade-tolerant conifers, and a trend for mesic
species to migrate to lower altitudes. Changes were least evident in the highest altitude
forests. Climate and human-caused and natural biotic disturbance factors probably all
played a role in forest change, but we argue that the most prominent factor was probably
exclusion of the thinning effect of ﬁre, especially on ﬁre-susceptible mesic species.
5. Synthesis and applications. Mesic species have encroached to lower altitudes and
forest density has increased since 1876. These changes have created to conditions opposite
to those suitable for warmer, drier future climates that will display increased ﬁre risk,
setting the stage for sudden and severe change. Management is complex because of
heavy fuel loading, administrative constraints and high public visibility. However, ‘sky
island’ landscapes such as the Peaks represent protected ecosystems of great importance
in arid regions. Testing of wildland ﬁre use and other management interventions to restore
composition and fuel structures more resilient to warmer climate should proceed.

Introduction
Patterns of recent (20th century) forest change vary with
forest type (Bekker & Taylor 2001; Whitlock, Shafer
& Marlon 2003). In the south-western USA, the role
of surface ﬁre regimes and the effects of ﬁre exclusion
associated with Euro-American settlement have been well
studied in low altitude forests (c. 2000–2600 m a.s.l.)
dominated by ponderosa pine and mixed conifers
(scientiﬁc names of species are given in Table 1). In these
areas, ﬁre exclusion beginning in the late 19th century,
accompanied by grazing and tree cutting, has resulted
in high tree density, fuel accumulations and increased
risk of crown ﬁre (Cooper 1960; Covington et al. 1994;
Swetnam & Baisan 2003). High altitude forests (> 2600 m
a.s.l.) comprise only about 3% of Arizona forests (O’Brien
2002) but are ecologically critical sites for landscape
diversity (Dahms & Geils 1997). The role of ﬁre and the
effects of ﬁre exclusion have not been well studied in
these rare forests.

Forest change on a 
gradient after ﬁre 
exclusion

Forest changes associated with ﬁre exclusion vary
widely between forest types. Because ponderosa and
some mixed conifer stands have estimated ﬁre return
intervals of 2–12 years and 4–25 years, respectively
(Wolf & Mast 1998; Swetnam & Baisan 2003), struc-
ture and composition have been dramatically altered
as a result of ﬁre exclusion (Covington et al. 1994; Fulé
et al. 2002). Shade-tolerant mesic trees that would be
most readily killed by ﬁre are able to survive below the
existing canopy. In contrast, overall aspen cover may
be declining (Loope & Gruell 1973; Johnson 1994;
Renkin & Despain 1996; Kay 1997; Ripple & Larsen
2000) as most sprouting occurs vegetatively following
large disturbances. Finally, because mesic spruce–ﬁr
forests experience naturally long ﬁre intervals, estimated
at 70–400 years (Aplet, Laven & Smith 1988; White &
Vankat 1993; Grissino-Mayer, Baisan & Swetnam 1995;
Fulé et al. 2003), it is possible that a century of ﬁre
exclusion has not had as large an impact as in lower
altitude forests (Romme 1982). Little is known about
bristlecone forests (Schubert & Rietveld 1970; Baker
1992).
Predictions for increased global temperatures may
threaten the sustainability of high-altitude forests
(Malcolm et al. 2002). Because of changes in forest
composition, structure and fuel loading, these forests
may be relatively severely impacted by increased
temperatures, drought and ﬁre (Flannigan, Stocks &
Wotton 2000). Rapid changes in climate may result
in certain species being incapable of surviving in
their present locations (Loehle 2000; Shafer, Bartlein
& Thompson 2001).
The San Francisco Peaks (hereafter Peaks) in north-
ern Arizona, USA, reach 3855 m a.s.l. and comprise a
unique environment that represents all of the impor-
tant high-altitude forest types of south-western USA.
Forests of ponderosa pine, aspen and bristlecone
pine are dominated by a single species (Table 1). Co-
dominant species exist in mixed conifer forests (Douglas-
ﬁr and limber pine) and in Engelmann spruce–subalpine
ﬁr forests (an endemic south-western USA variety, cork-
bark ﬁr). Fire was nearly completely excluded after the
1870s as a result of livestock grazing and ﬁre suppression
practices introduced by European settlers (Dieterich
1980; Heinlein 1996), with minimal areas burnt since
then (P.Z. Fulé, unpublished data). In 1984, a large por-
tion of the Peaks was set aside as a designated Wilderness
Area.
The objectives of this study were to compare current
and reconstructed historical forest structure over the
Peaks altitudinal gradient to address the following
questions. (i) How has forest structure changed within
each forest type since Euro-American settlement? After
approximately 124 years of ﬁre exclusion, we hypothe-
sized that forests adapted to frequent surface ﬁre would
be the most altered, while high-altitude forests, adapted
to an infrequent ﬁre regime, would show minimal change.
(ii) Has forest composition shifted over the landscape? Fire-
susceptible mesic species populations, with characteristics
such as thin bark, low crown base height and low resist-
ance to scorch, were considered likely to have been held
in check by frequent ﬁres at low altitude. We expected
to ﬁnd downward encroachment of such species in the
altitudinal gradient in the absence of ﬁre. (iii) Finally,
how can these data be applied to the management and
conservation of these rare habitats?
Materials and methods

We sampled 3500 ha on the south face of the Peaks
within the Coconino National Forest, north of Flagstaff,
Arizona, USA. Study plots were within or directly
adjacent to the Kachina Peaks Wilderness Area.
Past sheep and cattle grazing occurred at all altitudes
but timber harvesting only occurred up to roughly
2700 m. Study plot altitudes ranged from 2442 m to
3559 m. Plots were measured from the year 2000 until
2003. Weather from the Fort Valley weather station
(www.wrcc.dri.edu), located approximately 5 km south-
west of the study site, was summarized from 1909 to
2001. Mean January temperatures were 5·2 °C maximum
and −12·3 °C minimum. Mean July temperatures were
26·7 °C maximum and 7·1 °C minimum. Mean annual
precipitation was 56·9 cm. The Fort Valley weather
data are applicable only to the lower altitudes of our
study. The cooler conditions at higher altitudes may be
inferred from measurements taken at weather stations
established by Pearson (1920) in 1917 and 1918 in the
Table 1. Tree species found on study plots. White ﬁr Abies concolor (Gordon & Glendinning) Hoopes. and Gambel oak Quercus
gambelii Nutt. were found sparsely in the study area but were not encountered on sampling plots. We called the low-altitude white
pine Pinus ﬂexilis following Mitton, Kreiser & Latta (2000) but there is uncertainty about the presence of Pinus strobiformus or
a zone of hybridization between P. ﬂexilis and P. strobiformus on the San Francisco Peaks

following forest types on the Peaks: ponderosa pine
(2043–2530 m), Douglas-ﬁr (2530–2896 m), Engelmann
spruce (2896–3506 m) and alpine (above 3506 m). Mean
annual temperatures ranged from 5·8 °C in ponderosa,
5·4 °C in Douglas-ﬁr, 3·1 °C in Engelmann spruce and
−0·05 °C in alpine zones.
In this study, we stratiﬁed forest types into ﬁve
categories: ponderosa, mixed conifer, aspen, spruce–ﬁr
and bristlecone. Henceforth, these terms will be used to
indicate the forest type. To minimize confusion between
forest type names and the names of species, individual
tree species will be referred to by genus (and species for
Pinus) for the remainder of the paper (Table 1).

To measure forest structure and composition propor-
tional to occurrence over the landscape, 135 sample
plots were located on a systematic grid 300 m north–
south and 300 m or 600 m east–west, with greater
sampling density along the prevailing altitude gradient,
north–south. The grid spacing was designed to assess
forest structure at a large spatial scale. If a grid point
fell in a non-forested location, we checked 50 m to the
north, east, south and west to locate a substitute plot.
Only if all those locations were also non-forested was
the grid point eliminated from assessment. The 500-ha
Leroux Fire burned over part of the study area in 2001,
but we had already collected ground data before the
ﬁre (Cocke, Fulé & Crouse 2005) in all but nine plots.
These nine plots had surface ﬁre and mortality was low,
although the density of recently dead trees was slightly
higher here than overall across the Peaks.
Sampling plots, modiﬁed from the National Park
Service’s ﬁre monitoring protocol (NPS 2003), were
0·1 ha (20 × 50 m) in size and were orientated with the
50-m sides uphill–downhill. All trees were tagged and
tree measurements included species, diameter at breast
height (d.b.h.), height, crown base height and tree con-
dition. Trees larger than 15 cm d.b.h. were measured
on the entire plot; trees between 2·5 and 15 cm d.b.h.
were measured on a 0·025-ha subplot. Trees smaller
than 2·5 cm d.b.h. (regeneration) were tallied by species
and height class on a 50-m2 subplot.
Increment cores were taken at 40 cm above ground
level for all trees that were considered to have estab-
lished before the time of ﬁre exclusion and for 10% of
trees that had established after this period. Conifers
with d.b.h. 37 cm, aspens with d.b.h. 20 cm and
ponderosa pine trees of any size with yellowed bark
were likely to pre-date ﬁre exclusion (Mast et al. 1999).
Origin date was corrected later in the laboratory using
age data.
Along the 50-m sidelines of the plot, canopy cover
was recorded with a vertical densiometer (Ganey &
Block 1994); in 2000 this was measured every 30 cm,
and in 2001–03 it was measured every 3 m. Forest ﬂoor
and woody debris were measured along four 15·24-m
planar intersect transects (Brown 1974) located every
10 m along the plot centreline. Transect directions
were randomly chosen. Litter and duff depths were
measured every 1·52 m along each transect, and woody
debris was measured by time-lag classes (equivalent to
diameter categories; Anderson 1982) of 1 h, 10 h, 100 h
and 1000 h along each transect. Fuel loadings were
calculated from the planar transect data (Brown 1974;
Sackett 1980).
 
Tree increment cores were surfaced and visually cross-
dated (Stokes & Smiley 1968; Graybill 1987). Rings
were counted on cores that could not be cross-dated.
Past forest structure was reconstructed for the year
1876, the time of disruption of the frequent ﬁre regime
(Dieterich 1980; Heinlein 1996), following methods
described in detail by Fulé et al. (2002) and summarized
here: (i) the tree diameter in 1876 was reconstructed for
all living trees by subtracting the radial growth measured
on increment cores since ﬁre exclusion; (ii) for dead trees,
the date of death was estimated based on tree condition
class using diameter-dependent snag decomposition rates
(Thomas et al. 1979; Rogers et al. 1984) or historical
harvesting dates for stumps; (iii) decomposition rates
were calculated for average conditions (the 50th percentile
tree) as well as for fast decomposition (25th percentile)
and slow decomposition (75th percentile) in order to
assess the sensitivity of reconstruction results to decom-
position rate; and (iv) to estimate growth between the
ﬁre exclusion date and death date, we developed local
species-speciﬁc growth relationships between tree diameter
and basal area increment (r 2 for the growth models ranged
from 0·38 to 0·92, depending on the species).
We used Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus
(ETM+) imagery from 6 June 2000 to develop a forest
type map to assess whether our plots adequately
represented the landscape. A supervised classiﬁcation
using a minimum distance algorithm was undertaken
with ERDAS Imagine (Atlanta, GA). Sampling plot
data were used as training sites for the classiﬁcation
process where species labels were based on importance
values (Taylor 2000) calculated as the sum of the relative
frequency (density) and relative abundance (basal area).
Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics and
correlation–regression to explore relationships between
variables. Differences in structural characteristics on
the same plots over time were compared with paired
t-tests after data were transformed using the equation
X′ = log(X + 1) (Zar 1984) to meet assumptions of
normality and equality of variance for parametric tests.
The alpha level for all analyses was 0·05.
Results
The ground plot distribution was a faithful represen-
tation of the landscape. According to the classiﬁed
imagery, ponderosa was the predominant forest type
on the landscape, with roughly 30·1% of the study area.

This was followed closely by aspen (29·5%), then mixed
conifer (18·3%), bristlecone (12·5%) and spruce–ﬁr (9·6%).
The ﬁeld plots were distributed similarly (Table 2):
31·1% of the ﬁeld plots were dominated by aspen, followed
by ponderosa (22·2%), mixed conifer (22·2%), bristlecone
(17·0%) and spruce–ﬁr (7·4%). Thus the largest discrep-
ancy between ﬁeld plot sampling and landscape forest
types was < 8%.
Average altitudes ranged from ponderosa (2605 m)
to bristlecone (3288 m). Slopes increased at higher
altitudes, with ponderosa averaging 15·9% slope to
bristlecone averaging 53·3%. Altitude and slope were
highly positively correlated (Pearson, r = 0·75, P = 0·00).
Most plots (45·9%) had a southerly aspect (Table 2).
Most tree species occurred in all forest types, although
one species clearly dominated in both density (trees per
hectare) and basal area in most forest types. For example,
in ponderosa, 87% of the density and 88% of the basal
area were composed of P. ponderosa. Compositional
mixing was highest in mixed conifer, where Populus was
22% of the density and 19% of the basal area. Picea
also comprised a large percentage of the density in
bristlecone (31%), although Picea trees were relatively
small, making up only 14% of the basal area in this
forest type.
Overall, density was greatest in spruce–ﬁr and least
in bristlecone (Table 3). Basal area was also highest in
spruce–ﬁr but lowest in ponderosa because of the large
number of small diameter trees. The highest percentage
canopy cover was in mixed conifer followed by aspen;
the lowest was bristlecone (Table 4). Litter depths
ranged from an average of 0·73 cm in bristlecone to
1·62 cm in ponderosa. Duff was lowest in bristlecone
(1·79 cm) but highest in spruce–ﬁr (4·32 cm). Total
woody debris was quite variable by forest type, ranging
from 62 to 132 Mg ha−1 (Table 5).
Regeneration density ranged from highest in aspen
(2580 stems ha−1, mostly Populus) to lowest in bristlecone
(301·5 stems ha−1, mostly P. aristata; Table 6). These
two species followed the same trend regardless of forest
type, with Populus regenerating the most (775 stems ha−1)
and P. aristata the least (25 stems ha−1). Total regenera-
tion was highest for all species in the height class less

than 30 cm, ranging from 127 stems ha−1 in bristlecone
to 1766 stems ha−1 in aspen. Densities were lowest for
all stems taller than 2 m. No stems in this height class
occurred in bristlecone or spruce–ﬁr, and other values
were 72 stems ha−1 for mixed conifer, 35 stems ha−1 for
ponderosa and 44 stems ha−1 for aspen. All stems in
the aspen type greater than 2 m were either P. ﬂexilis or
Pseudotsuga. Therefore, although Populus sprouts made
up the highest density of all species, all were smaller
than 2 m.
Age distributions were calculated in 20-year intervals
by species (Fig. 1). Pinus aristata trees have been
steadily establishing for the last 400 years. The spruce–
ﬁr (Picea and Abies) and mixed conifer species (Pseu-
dotsuga and P. ﬂexilis) also experienced continuous
establishment. In contrast, Populus experienced a large
increase around 1880 followed by a decline; few have
established since the 1940s. Pinus ponderosa experienced
a large increase in establishment around the 1920s and
1940s.
All forest types had signiﬁcantly lower densities and
basal areas in 1876 than in 2000 (paired t-test, P = 0·0001;
Tables 7 & 8). Tree densities in 1876 ranged from 61·7
trees ha−1 in ponderosa to 283·9 trees ha−1 in bristlecone.
Basal areas ranged from 7·3 m2 ha−1 in aspen to 27·3 m2
ha−1 in bristlecone. Density increases were largest in
ponderosa (1073%) and lowest in bristlecone (92%).
However, changes in basal area were greatest in aspen
(456%) and lowest in bristlecone (69%) (Table 8). Several
species now occur in forest types in which they previously
did not occur. In the 1876 forest, Abies, P. aristata, Picea
and P. ﬂexilis were absent from the ponderosa type and
P. ponderosa was absent from bristlecone and spruce–
ﬁr types. By 2000, P. ponderosa was still absent from
bristlecone and spruce–ﬁr types but Abies was the only
species absent from ponderosa. By matching 1876 and
modern distributions with plot altitudes, we found
that P. aristata had descended by 150 m, Picea by 400 m,
P. ﬂexilis by 25 m and Pseudotsuga by 55 m. In 1876
P. ponderosa’s upper limit was 3029 m, but currently the

upper limit for this species is 2860 m. In contrast, Abies
and P. ﬂexilis are currently found 200 and 156 m higher,
respectively, than in 1876.
Discussion
Potential sources of error in the 1876 stand recon-
struction include loss of evidence, variability between
species in time to reach coring height and the use of
decomposition models. Loss of evidence would be
largest if a ﬁre had occurred in the study site after the
reconstruction date. Fire scars and age data collected in
a companion study show that almost no ﬁres occurred
in the study site after 1880 (P.Z. Fulé, unpublished data).
Loss of evidence could also occur if small trees decayed
completely, which could occur within a 124-year period.
However, the methods we applied on the Peaks have been
tested in other northern Arizona forests. Mast et al.
(1999) showed that old tree material could be reliably
dated to pre/post-1876 status in the ﬁeld. Moore et al.
(2004) compared historical tree records (1909) to recon-
structed ponderosa density, ﬁnding that roughly 3 trees
ha−1 were lost in the reconstruction, most probably as a
result of decay. Fulé et al. (2003) compared reconstructed
forest structure, including ponderosa, Douglas-ﬁr, cork-
bark ﬁr and Engelmann spruce, to data from a detailed
survey conducted by Lang & Stewart (1910) on the North
Rim of Grand Canyon. Tree density in the 1910 survey
data averaged within 5–9% of the reconstructed data
and no species exceeded a 25% difference.
Establishment year uncertainty exists because of a
lack of knowledge of time to reach coring height and
how this varies between species. On the Peaks, Heinlein
(1996) found that ponderosa ranged from 11 to 17 years
to attain a 40-cm height, whereas limber pine took as long
as 25 years to reach the same height. To compensate
for uncertainty, we grouped trees into 20-year intervals
and assessed data as the age at coring height and not by
year of establishment.
Generalized decomposition equations also add un-
certainly to the reconstruction model, leading us to carry
out a sensitivity analysis using three different decom-
position rate percentiles, 25%, 50% and 75%. Changes in
stand densities in the ﬁve forest types ranged from 1·3%
to 16·6% between the 25th and 50th percentiles. Differ-
ences were between 7·0% and 14% between the 50th and
75th percentile. Changes in basal area ranged from 0·1%
to 21·2% between the 25th and 50th percentiles. Differ-
ences were between 10·8% and 22·6% between the 50th
and 75th percentiles. Aspen and spruce–ﬁr forest types
were the most sensitive (Table 9). While the variability
associated with the reconstruction is substantial, covering

an approximate range of −20% to +20%, this variability
is still substantially less than the overall increase in tree
density and basal area between the 1870s and today:
range 69% to > 1000%.
Between 1876 and the present, changes in tree density
and basal area were lowest in higher altitude forests.
Changes in the bristlecone type were lower than all other
forest types on the Peaks. This type also has minimal
fuel loadings. Bristlecone pine has a high ﬁre tolerance
rating (USDA 2004; http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/
index.html, accessed 4 June 2005) but was classiﬁed in
the ‘no predictable ﬁres’ group by Keeley & Zedler (1998).
Mature P. aristata trees on the Peaks may have survived
ﬁres over the last several centuries, as current forests
are characterized by large and old trees, several with
multiple ﬁre scars (P.Z. Fulé, unpublished data). While
Baker (1992) determined that bristlecone in Colorado
established primarily following ﬁre, we found continuous
establishment of P. aristata for more than 400 years,
even at the plot level. Preliminary ﬁre regime data from
bristlecone pine on the study area indicated evidence of
both surface and small patches of stand replacing ﬁre
(P.Z. Fulé, unpublished data).
Density changes in the spruce–ﬁr type were also low
compared with lower altitude forests. Because Abies and
Picea are relatively ﬁre-susceptible, ages of old trees
may indicate ﬁre-free intervals. From the ages of trees
on the Peaks, it appears that a stand-replacing ﬁre
has not occurred for at least 200 years in most of the
spruce–ﬁr type. These forests had high duff and coarse
woody debris accumulation. Litter depths and ﬁne woody
fuel loadings were low, which could be the result of
a compact litter layer under these short-needled
species (Burns & Honkala 1990) and retention of dead
branches (Brown & Bevins 1986).
Mid-altitude forests had moderate structural changes.
The mixed conifer type had moderate density increase
and relatively low increase in basal area. The aspen type
showed large density increases, but mostly from conifers.
More than 84% of dead trees within aspen types were
actually Populus, underscoring the decline of the aspen
forest type.
Ponderosa types of forest changed the most in density.
Current ponderosa types on the Peaks have high densities
but low basal areas, indicating establishment of many
small trees. Ponderosa establishment was low but continu-
ous until around 1880, when establishment escalated,
similar to patterns in nearby stands (Mast et al. 1999).
Meadow invasion has occurred in many lower altitude
parks in the south-western USA (Dyer & Moffett
1999). Plots where oldest trees established after 1920 on
the Peaks were along dry grassland meadows.
The whole landscape is affected by forest change, even
though the degree of change has varied among forest
types. Because changes were lowest in high altitude forests
where ﬁre frequency was historically lower (Wolf &
Mast 1998), ﬁre exclusion has probably had less impact
on these areas (Romme 1982) although even limited
effects might be ecologically meaningful (Taylor 2000).
Fulé et al. (2003) found that ﬁre years in higher altitudes
were also ﬁre years in lower altitudes, as many ignitions
in lower forests were carried upslope. In cedar groves,
Habeck (1985) found that although stands that experi-
ence ﬁre infrequently may have had few direct effects of
ﬁre exclusion, these forests were often adjacent to forest
types that had been highly affected by exclusion, creating
more fuel continuity. White & Vankat (1993) noted that
the continuity of dense stands in a high-altitude forest
could lead to larger ﬁres, perhaps creating landscapes
with less patch diversity. Grissino-Mayer, Baisan &
Swetnam (1995) suggested that the mixed conifer type
acted as a buffer around the spruce–ﬁr type.
Climate change also causes forest change (Shafer,
Bartlein & Thompson 2001) and can interact with ﬁre
exclusion effects. Past climatic events have strong
relationships with regional ﬁre years in south-western
USA (Swetnam & Baisan 2003). The role of climate
change in the 20th century on the Peaks is not entirely
clear. Salzer’s (2000) dendroclimatological reconstruction
from the Peaks found that periods in the early and late
20th century were relatively wet, but Biondi (1999) observed
no trend in 20th century weather records from Fort Valley,
at the base of the Peaks. While it may not be possible to
disentangle the past inﬂuences of climate from those of
ﬁre exclusion, the predicted future climate is likely to
pose a sharply different environment with negative
effects on current forest conditions, as described below.
We observed a shift in species composition, resulting
in greater dominance by mesic species at lower altitudes
compared with 1876. Certain species were able to
survive where establishment was previously prevented,
most probably by the historical surface ﬁre regime. In
1876 Abies, P. aristata, Picea and P. ﬂexilis did not exist
within the ponderosa type, while in 2000 all of these
species except Abies occurred there. Shade-tolerant
conifers also increased in mid-altitude forests. Not
only have P. ﬂexilis and Pseudotsuga become more
dominant in the mixed conifer type, but the aspen types
are also being invaded by conifers, consistent with
numerous studies that have suggested that aspen cover
is declining in the west. Johnson (1994) estimated that

aspen stands declined by 46% in a 24-year period in
New Mexico and Arizona. Because Populus regener-
ates best following disturbances (Dahms & Geils 1997)
and poorly without disturbances (Andrejak & Barnes
1969), ﬁre exclusion has probably had a negative impact
on these stands. On the other hand, high numbers of elk
Cervus elaphus may decimate any regeneration (Bartos,
Brown & Booth 1994; Kay 1997; Ripple & Larsen 2000;
Hessl & Graumlich 2002). Age data showed that within
50 years of ﬁre exclusion, Populus establishment severely
decreased and invasion of conifers occurred. Most estab-
lishment of Populus on the Peaks occurred before 1920.
Overstorey mortality may result in more sprouting
(Bartos, Brown & Booth 1994; Bailey & Whitham 2002),
although areas of most re-growth may receive heavier
elk browsing.
Climate interacts with disturbance, inﬂuencing how
and when forests burn (Turner et al. 1994; Swetnam &
Baisan 2003). Many studies suggest that global temper-
atures will increase (Hanson & Weltzin 2000; Flannigan,
Stocks & Wotton 2000), leading to increases in ﬁre
frequency and severity because of more extreme temper-
ature days, increased drought (Hanson & Weltzin 2000)
and longer ﬁre seasons (Flannigan, Stocks & Wotton
2000).
Climate changes combined with ﬁre exclusion have
major implications for south-western USA forests.
Increased temperatures cause lower altitudes to become
too dry to support some species (Shafer, Bartlein &
Thompson 2001), which may migrate to higher altitudes
if natural and/or human-aided migration rates are fast
enough (Malcolm et al. 2002). High-altitude forests,
which usually retain higher moisture content (Pearson
1920), will become drier and more likely to burn. Without
ﬁre exclusion, mesic species would probably not have
migrated down in altitude and would not be as suscept-
ible to increased ﬁre. However, because species have
moved down in altitude, ﬁre threatens more forest types
and their dependant species. Rapid climate change may
already be difﬁcult for plant communities to cope with
(Shafer, Bartlein & Thompson 2001; Malcolm et al.
2002) and, coupled with the results of ﬁre exclusion,
will potentially lead to substantial shifts in vegetation.
Ecosystem management on the Peaks is done in the
context of the 1964 Wilderness Act’s mandate for
protected lands to be ‘untrammeled by man’. However,
many wilderness areas, including the Kachina Peaks,
were designated in recent decades after sustained mani-
pulation through ﬁre exclusion, grazing and logging
by humans. Prior to Euro-American settlement, altera-
tions by indigenous people occurred for thousands of
years (Pyne 1982). But in south-western USA forests
that were remote from intensive Native American use,
such as the Peaks, the recent changes in forest structure
and process are much faster and broader in spatial scale
(Allen 2002). Fire exclusion on the Peaks is associated
with compositional shifts that may increase stand
homogeneity and in turn could increase susceptibility
to ﬁre and other disturbance agents such as pathogens.
Management in wilderness areas should be orientated
towards certain key objectives. One objective may be to
minimize management, maximizing the characteristics
that Cole (2001) referred to as ‘wildness’. Under this option,
larger ﬁres are likely to spread through all forest types in
the next few decades but aspen could still decline as a
result of herbivory (Kay 1997; Bailey & Whitham 2002).
These effects may seem negative in the short term but
eventually will result in lands that are in a ‘wild’ state.
An alternate objective might be to manage for
‘naturalness’ (Cole 2001) by restoring and maintaining,
to the extent possible, forest structures, composition
and disturbance regimes similar to historical patterns.
Several studies throughout the south-western USA have
examined ponderosa pine and lower mixed conifer
forest restoration through combinations of thinning
and burning (Covington et al. 1997; Lynch, Romme &
Floyd 2000; Fulé et al. 2002). There is also evidence
that relatively severe prescribed burning without thinning
could also serve restorative goals in some circumstances
(Miller & Urban 2000; Fulé et al. 2004). If the lower
altitude forests were targeted for restoration manage-
ment, reestablishment of open forest and meadows could
mitigate the size and intensity at which high-severity
burns could enter higher altitudes, maintaining a pattern
of stand-replacing ﬁres in the aspen and spruce–ﬁr similar
to historical patterns.
Merriam (1890) used the Peaks’ forests to illustrate
the relationship between latitudinal and altitudinal clim-
ate patterns, explaining the post-glacial ‘distribution
of life in North America’ as the result of the Holocene
mixing of northern (boreal) and southern (Sonoran)
taxa. The concept of climatically regulated ‘life zones’
was readily accepted by ecologists but it took longer to
recognize the critical role of disturbance. Now that a
brief 130-year period of ﬁre exclusion and other human-
caused factors has led to substantial changes in forest
structure, especially at lower altitudes, and future climate
appears likely to turn favourable for increased ﬁre activity,
Merriam’s (1890: pp. 23–24) observation regarding post-
glacial migration takes on new urgency: ‘when the
physiographic conditions of a region are in a process of
change, those forms of life which are sufﬁciently plastic
to adapt themselves to the rapidly changing conditions
survive, while those which cannot so adapt themselves
become extinct’.
