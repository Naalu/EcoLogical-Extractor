ABSTRACT: The highly threatened limestone prairies of Pennsylvania, USA, will be lost from the
landscape entirely unless they are soon protected and restored. Several studies have demonstrated that
seed banks can be useful in the restoration of native plant communities. Jfnative prairie propagules are
still present in the soil of an early successional forest, which was once prairie according to aerial
photographs from 1949 and 1971, then it may be possible to remove the invading woody plants and
utilize the seed bank for limestone prairie seedling recruitment. The soil seed bank ofa limestone prairie
in central Pennsylvania was analyzed by extracting soil cores from the current prairie, the edge of the
prairie, and the surrounding forest. The seedling emergence method was used to germinate seeds for
species identification. Although viable seeds of 12 native prairie species were present in soil samples
from within the limestone prairie, only 9 and 4 native prairie species were present in the edge and
surrounding forest soils, respectively. Thus, the richness of prairie propagules in the soil seed bank
declined since the onset of woody plant invasion. Moreover, no viable seeds ofBouteloua curtipendu/a
(Michx.) Torr., the dominant grass of limestone prairies, were detected, even within the prairie.
Therefore, the soil seed bank of limestone prairies in Pennsylvania cannot be expected to contribute
significantly to seedling recruitment during restoration efforts. As a rule of thumb, if the dominant or
co-dominant plant species in a community does not generate a large andlor long-lived seed bank, then
recruitment from the seed bank is not a viable method for ecological restoration.
Falta de Propagulos Nativos en un Banco de Semillas de una Pradera de Piedra
Caliza en Pennsylvania, USA: Esperanzas Imitiles de un Rol en la Restauracion
Ecologica.
RESUMEN: Las altamente amenazadas praderas de piedra caliza de Pennsylvania, USA, se perderan
enteramente a menos que sean protegidas y restauradas. Muchos estudios han demostrado que los
bancos de semillas pueden se utiles en la restauraci6n de comunidades de plantas nativas. Si los
propagulos nativos de la pradera, aun estan presentes en el suelo de una sere inicial de un bosque, que
inicialmente fuera una pradera de acuerdo a fotos aereas de 1949 y 1971, entonces podria ser posible
sacar las plantas leiiosas invasoras y utilizar el banco de semilias para reclutar plantulas de pradera de
piedra caliza. EI banco de semillas de la pradera de piedra caliza en Pennsylvania central fue analizado
extrayendo capas de suelo de la pradera actual, el limite de la pradera y el bosque que la rodea. EI
metodo de emergencia de la plantula fue utilizado para la gerrninaci6n de las semillas y su identificaci6n
especifica. Aunque semillas viables de 12 especies nativas de la pradera estuvieron presentes en las
muestras de suelo dentro de la pradera de piedra caliza, s6109 y 4 especies nativas estuvieron presentes
en el borde y en el suelo del bosque que la rodean, respectivamente. Por 10 tanto, la riqueza de los
propagulos en el banco de semillas del suelo declin6 desde el inicio de la invasi6n de las plantas leiiosas.
De becho, no se encontraron semillas viables de Bouteloua curtipendula (Michx.) Torr., la especie de
pasto dominante en las praderas de piedra caliza, aun dentro de la pradera. Por 10 tanto no se puede
esperar que
el banco de semillas de las praderas de piedra caliza en Pennsylvania contribuya
significativamente al reclutamiento de plantulas durante los esfuerzos de restauraci6n. Como regia, si
la especie dominante 0 co-dominante en una comunidad vegetal no genera bancos de semillas grandes
ylo de larga vida, el reclutamiento de ese banco no sera un metodo viable para la restauraci6n ecol6gica.

INTRODUCTION
The use of soil seed banks in ecological
restoration has interested ecologists for
over a decade (van der Valk and Pederson
1989, Putwain and Gillham 1990, Bakker
et al. 1991, Rosburg et al. 1994, Hutchings
and Booth 1996, Davies and Waite 1998).
Seed banks have potential for use in resto-
ration because they contain a large pool of
potential propagules (Barbour et al. 1987)
that may constitute a "relic" of previous
site vegetation (Chippindale and Milton
1934). Indeed, "the undisturbed seed bank
remains as a decaying artifact and an eco-
logical testament to the changes that have
occurred in the local vegetation" (Davies
and Waite 1998). Using seeds already
present in the soil at a restoration site would
be ideal, but how do seed banks change
after one vegetation type is replaced by
another?

are less suitable for the establishment and
growth of woody plants. The prairie per-
sists on a south-facing slope surrounded
by second-growth woodlands and agricul-
tural fields . A canopy ofJuglans nigra L.,
Prunus serotina Ehrh., Pinus strobus L.,
and Crataegus L. spp. dominates the sur-
rounding forest, and the forest understory
consists of typical woodland herbs and a
mix of "old-field"-type vegetation.
To determine the recent extent ofthis prai-
rie before woody plant invasion, I obtained
repeat aerial photographs of the site every
decade from the 1940s to the 1990s from
the Pennsylvania Geological Survey. I rec-
tified the photos in Arc/Info using geo-
referenced points from the current Digital
Orthophoto Quarter Quadrangle. It was
clear that this prairie has undergone rapid
woody invas ion since 1949, and the pho-
tos showed where prairie has been replaced
by the advancing woody flora (Figure 1).
In 1949, open areas dominated the proper-
ty and were probably managed as pasture.
European grasses such as Dactylis glom-
erata L. and Festuca elatior L. dominate
most of the current open areas except for
a small (0.1 ha) patch on the western side
of the property where the prairie flora has
persisted (Figure 1).
Seed Bank and Vegetation Sampling
I sampled soil in three areas: (1) the cur-
rent prairie; (2) an edge area defined as a
lOom-wide shrubby zone dominated by
Eleagnus umbel/ata Thunb., Lonicera
morrowii A.Gray, and Crataegus L. spp .,
between the prairie and forest ; and (3) the
forested area that in 1949 was open grass-
land (Figure 1). In late April 2001, before
most seeds received germination cues, I
collected stratified-random samples with-
in the three vegetation types. Three soil
cores were extracted and combined from
20 sampling locations randomly chosen
from each ofthe three areas (60 total cores
from each vegetation type) . Each soil core,
extracted with a soil core tube, was 10 cm
deep with a diameter of 2.5 ern. A total
volume of 3042 ern" of soil was sampled
from each ofthe three areas. I sampled the
extant vegetation using 0.25-m2 plots lo-
cated where the soil cores were extracted
(20 plots per area). A tally of all species
.160

present was done for each plot.
I used the seedling emergence method to
identify the seed bank species composi-
tion, following Ter Heerdt et al. (1996).
Soil cores were sieved and spread thinly
over sterile mineral soil in flats (25.4 ern x
50.8 ern) within a glasshouse at University
Park, Pennsylvania, in early summer 200 1.
A thin layer of sand lay between the sam-
ple and the soil. Flats were watered daily
and glasshouse temperatures ranged be-
tween 20°C and 30°C. Flats were arranged
randomly on glasshouse benches and all
flats received full exposure to the sun . All
seedlings were grown (and transplanted if
necessary) until identified and counted.
Seedlings were identified to species using
keys found in Kummer (1951), Priwer et
a!. (1980), and Stuckey (1981). Control
flats illuminated species that were deter-
mined to be glasshouse contaminants (e.g.,
Cyperus brevifolioides Thieret & Dela-
houssaye), and these species were exclud-
ed from the data set. Soil samples were
stirred after 1 month to encourage further
germination, and the experiment was ter-
minated after three months when no more
seedlings emerged.
I determined compositional similarity of
seed banks and extant vegetation across
the sampled habitats by the unweighted
pair-groups method using arithmetic aver-
ages (UPGMA) (Gauch 1995, McCune
and Grace 2002), following Hanlon et a!.
(1998). Presence/absence data was used to
define community matrices and Euclidean
distance was chosen as the dissimilarity
coefficient. The cluster analysis was ac-
complished in PC-ORD (McCune and
Mefford 1999), which produced a dendro-
gram that grouped similar floras close to-
gether.
RESUlIS AND DISCUSSION
Seed Bank Composition
Totals of 35 and 76 species were detected
in the seed bank and in the extant vegeta-
tion, respectively (Table 1). Similar obser-
vations in other studies (Chippindale and
Milton 1934, Lippert and Hopkins 1950,
Platt 1975, Abrams 1988), weedy species
were among the largest component of the
prairie seed bank. Of the 35 species de-
tected in the seed bank, at most 5 (Anem-
one cylindrica A.Gray, Danthonia spicata
[L.] P.Beauv. ex Roem. & Schult., Eupato-
rium altissimum L., Panicum oligosanthes
Schult., andPenstemon hirsutus [L.] Willd.)
could be considered nonweedy native prai-
rie plants. The most dominant species
(found in > 25% of the samples) in the
prairie and edge seed bank were the weedy
species Verbascum thapsus L., Aster pilo-
sus Willd. , and Daucus carota L. (Table
1). The only native species that were found
in the seed bank that were not detected in
the vegetation samples were Erigeron an-
nuus (L.) Pers ., E. philadelphicus L., An-
dropogon virginicus L., and Euthamia gr-
aminifolia (L.) Nutt. (Table 1), which
produce abundant seeds and were com-
mon in nearby fields.
Many native species were detected in both
the extant vegetation and the seed bank.
Anemone cylindrica, Aster pilosus, Dan-
thonia spicata, Eupat orium altissimum,
Panicum oligosanthes, Penstemon hirsu-
tus, andSolidagojuncea Aiton were found
in both the prairie and edge vegetation and
seed banks. However, no dominant or rare
prairie species were detected in the forest
seed bank. Thus, the richness of prairie
propagules in the soil seed bank declined
since the onset of woody plant invasion.
The seed bank floras are compositionally
very different than the extant vegetation
(Figure 2). The majority (76%) of the taxa
present in the extant vegetation were not
detected in the seed bank. Native lime-
stone prairie species found in the vegeta-
tion that were not detected in the seed
bank include Anemone virginiana L., Apo-
cynum cannabinum L., Asclepias viridi-
flora Raf., Aster urophyl/us Lind!. in DC.,
Bouteloua curtipendula, Carex bushii
Mack., Galium pilosum Aiton, Unum sul-
catum Riddell, Monardafistulosa L.,Pani-
cum acuminatum Sw., and Sisyrin chium
montanum Greene.
These results generally concur with other
studies that have demonstrated that most
grassland species do not form persistent
seed banks (Coffin and Lauenroth 1989,
Milberg 1995, Hutchings and Booth 1996,
Davies and Waite 1998, Dzwonko and
