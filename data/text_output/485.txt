Mixed conifer forests of western North America are challenging for ﬁre management, as historical ﬁre
regimes were highly variable in severity, timing, and spatial extent. Complex ﬁre histories combined with
site factors and other disturbances, such insect outbreaks, led to great variation in understory plant com-
munities, and management activities inﬂuence future dynamics of both overstory and understory com-
munities. This variation needs to be considered as part of ecosystem-scale efforts to inﬂuence future
ﬁres and restore the composition and structure of mixed conifer forests. We undertook a systematic
review of published studies evaluating effects of tree cutting and ﬁre on understory vegetation in western
North American mixed conifer forests. Forty-one studies, published in 50 articles, met inclusion criteria
and encompassed projects in seven states in the USA and British Columbia in Canada. Total understory
plant abundance (cover, biomass, or density) commonly declined in the short term within 4 years after
treatment. This may result from damage to plants during tree cutting operations or ﬁre, heavy loadings
of slash, little change or even expansion of tree canopies after low-intensity treatments, herbivory, or
drought. In contrast, all 7 studies measuring understories longer than 5 years since treatment reported
increases in understory metrics. Treatments in these long-term studies also persistently decreased tree
canopy cover. Most or all native species endured (even if reduced in abundance) through cutting opera-
tions or ﬁre. A model of understory response has emerged that treatments generally do not eliminate spe-
cies, and often beneﬁt species absent or uncommon in untreated forest. Groups of native species (e.g.,
Epilobium spp.) appear ﬁre-dependent, because they are uncommon or absent in unburned mixed conifer
forests and after tree cutting alone. Cutting and prescribed ﬁre applied together resulted in the greatest
invasion of non-native plants, but non-native cover was minimal compared to native cover. Few studies
examined inﬂuences of intensity of tree cutting or severity of prescribed ﬁre, but overstory–understory
relationships suggest that treatments must substantially reduce overstory density from maximum values
(which can exceed 3000 stems ha1 and 80 m2 ha1 basal area) and tree canopy cover to <30–50% cover
to elicit appreciable responses from the forest understory. Few studies examined understory dynamics
after wildﬁre relative to unburned forest, and further work is warranted because wildﬁre is a likely even-
tual outcome of passive management in these forests. Across a broad region from the southwestern Uni-
ted States into Canada, prescribed ﬁre and tree cutting consistently increased disturbance-promoted
native species in the short term and total understory abundance in the long term. Active management
using tree cutting and ﬁre will likely beneﬁt both biodiversity conservation and ﬁre management in cur-
rent mixed conifer forests.

1. Introduction
Conserving forest biodiversity and maintaining ecosystem ser-
vices is challenging forest managers globally (Honnay et al.,
2002; Hart and Chen, 2006; Paillet et al., 2010). Meeting this chal-
lenge beneﬁts from a comprehensive understanding of the effects
of a range of forest management activities – including passive
management – on ecosystem components (Metlen et al., 2004;
North et al., 2007; Kalies et al., 2010). Understory plant communi-
ties are a critical forest component containing a major proportion
of forest species diversity and providing numerous ecosystem
functions that can both affect and be affected by forest manage-
ment activities (Roberts, 2004; Gilliam, 2007; Barbier et al.,
2008). Tree cutting and ﬁre are two of the main management activ-
ities affecting forest understory dynamics (Selmants and Knight,
2003; Ares et al., 2010; Halpern and Lutz, 2013). For example,
different methods of tree cutting can differentially inﬂuence
understories, and a particular cutting method could affect plant
cover differently than it affects species richness (Dodson et al.,
2007; Kreyling et al., 2008; Knapp et al., 2013). Similarly, plant
groups, such as native and non-native species, could respond dif-
ferently to management activities (Abella and Covington, 2004;
Sutherland and Nelson, 2010; Fiedler et al., 2013). The imprint of
major events in forests on understory plant communities can be
long-lived, such as persistent effects to plant diversity from Roman
clearing of French forests 2000 years ago (Dambrine et al., 2007).
Undesirable legacies of forest practices might be avoided if we
have a foundation of clear insights on impacts to understory
communities.
To help provide such a foundation, systematic reviews are
emerging tools for evaluating evidence for ecological questions,
including effects of forest management activities (e.g., Rosenvald
and Lõhmus, 2008; Verschuyl et al., 2011; Duguid and Ashton,
2013). Systematic reviews are complementary to traditional narra-
tive reviews, but differ by having reproducible methods for locat-
ing literature, criteria for including or excluding studies, and an
evaluation of evidence from reproducibly synthesized primary
data (Pullin and Stewart, 2006). Systematic reviews and statistical
meta-analyses are not synonymous: data gathered by a systematic
review can be analyzed with or without a statistical meta-analysis,
and meta-analysis can be applied to numerous data sets other than
those assembled through a systematic review (Koricheva et al.,
2013).
Here, we conducted a systematic review of the effects of tree
cutting and ﬁre on understory vegetation in mixed conifer forests
of interior western North America. Mixed conifer forests are con-
sidered among North America’s most difﬁcult for ﬁre management,
and conservation of these forests is currently of keen interest
(Agee, 1993; Klenner et al., 2008; Jain et al., 2012). Contemporary
conditions of mixed conifer forests differ from those before or dur-
ing initial Euro-American settlement (Parsons and DeBenedetti,
1979; Covington et al., 1994; Minnich et al., 1995; Reynolds
et al., 2013). Major changes to ﬁre regimes, tree structure and com-
position, forest ﬂoor and light conditions, climate, and introduction
of livestock and exotic species may all inﬂuence understory vege-
tation (Battaglia and Shepperd, 2007; Knapp et al., 2013). Except
for rare forests such as those with natural ﬁre regimes continued
through the 1900s (mostly in Mexico; Minnich et al., 2000) or with
managed active ﬁre programs (e.g., Sequoia/Kings Canyon National
Parks; Webster and Halpern, 2010), the key evolutionary process of
low- and mixed-severity ﬁre has been excluded after settlement
(Heinlein et al., 2005; Baker et al., 2007; Falk et al., 2011). Fuel
loads accrued during the 1900s support severe, stand-replacing ﬁre
regimes in many areas (Freeman et al., 2007; Crotteau et al., 2013;
Fornwalt and Kaufmann, 2014). Tree density and basal area have
increased on average by orders of magnitude, now often exceeding
1000 trees ha1 and 30–80 m2 ha1 basal area (Cocke et al., 2005;
North et al., 2007; Fulé et al., 2009). Tree composition has generally
shifted toward an increased proportion of species with low ﬁre tol-
erance and higher shade tolerance, at the expense of ﬁre-tolerant
species such as Pinus ponderosa (ponderosa pine; Barbour et al.,
2002; Vankat, 2011; Abella et al., 2012). Concomitant with
increased tree density, light reaching the forest ﬂoor has decreased,
while O horizons have thickened (Bigelow and North, 2012;
Lydersen et al., 2013). Stocking levels of livestock (primarily cattle
and sheep) peaked in the mid-1800s or early 1900s among regions,
with likely profound but poorly understood impacts (Riggs et al.,
2000). A suite of non-native species, ranging from tree pests to
plants, can dramatically inﬂuence mixed conifer forests at local
to regional scales (Hessburg and Agee, 2003).
Associated with these land use and forest structural changes,
examples of repeat-photography studies and historical records

have frequently revealed dramatic changes in understory vegeta-
tion since the early Euro-American settlement period. In early set-
tlement photos of Rocky Mountain mixed conifer forests in Idaho
and Montana, Gruell (1983) showed examples 50–100 years later
of herbaceous understories of Lupinus spp. or Pseudoroegneria spi-
cata (bluebunch wheatgrass) largely disappearing under expanded
tree canopy; reduced shrub understories such as of Shepherdia
canadensis (buffaloberry); and shifts in shrub dominance such as
to Cercocarpus ledifolius (mountain mahogany). Striking aspects of
the geographically extensive photos included abundant evidence
of disturbance (predominately ﬁre, timber cutting, and livestock)
in the late 1800s/early 1900s which related to mosaics of different
understories, and numerous pathways of vegetation change in the
1900s, but generally signiﬁcant expansion of conifer trees and
reduced herbaceous plants and shrubs (Gruell, 1983). In analyzing
historical inventories from 1897–1902 in California mixed conifer
forest reserves, McKelvey and Johnston (1992) concluded that
understories were sparse at that time (even though overstories
remained open and dominated by large, old trees) owing to
drought in the late 1800s, intensive livestock grazing, and severe
burning by sheepherders. Subsequent exclusion of nearly all ﬁre
corresponded with pervasive tree recruitment, resulting in contin-
ued limiting of understory plant growth (McKelvey and Johnston,
1992). Overall conclusions from these, and other studies in mixed
conifer forests (e.g., Kaufmann et al., 1998; Gruell, 2001; Taylor,
2004), indicate that: (i) understory plant cover has generally
decreased during the past 100 years, likely linked with increased
tree density and supported by negative relationships between tree
abundance and understory vegetation (Larson and Wolters, 1983);
(ii) grazing, ﬁre exclusion, different climatic conditions (from the
1800s to today), and other factors (e.g., air pollution) have likely
interacted to change composition or abundance of understory
plants in ways not well understood; and (iii) it is difﬁcult to ascer-
tain speciﬁc past reference conditions for these understories, sug-
gesting opportunity for developing reference information based
on how contemporary vegetation responds to disturbance to help
guide future forest management efforts.
The primary question of our systematic review was: How do
tree cutting and ﬁre inﬂuence understory vegetation in western
North American mixed conifer forests? We had ﬁve speciﬁc ques-
tions, each with anticipated outcomes:
(1) Do tree cutting, managed ﬁre (prescribed or wildland ﬁre
use), tree cutting + managed ﬁre, and wildﬁre have differ-
ent effects on total understory plant abundance (cover,
biomass, density, or other reported measures) and species
richness? We anticipated that relative treatment effects
would increase in the order: managed ﬁre < cutting < cut-
ting + managed
ﬁre < wildﬁre.
Our
rationale
was
that,
owing to negative relationships between overstory tree
abundance
and
understory
vegetation
in
undisturbed
mixed conifer forests (Larson and Wolters, 1983), treat-
ments should represent a gradient of decreasing overstory
correlated with increasing understory vegetation. Note
that we purposely refer to wildﬁre as a ‘treatment’ in this
paper, because wildﬁre often is an eventual ‘de facto’
treatment implemented via passive management in these
forests (Stark et al., 2006; Knapp et al., 2012; Crotteau
et al., 2013).
(2) Are understory metrics such as plant cover and species rich-
ness related to time since tree cutting or time since ﬁre? We
expected that short/moderate time durations after treat-
ment would have the greatest difference with controls,
because longer post-treatment durations (decades) could
exhibit tree canopy ingrowth or re-accumulation of O hori-
zons (Stephens et al., 2012).
(3) Do responses to these disturbances vary among plant groups
(growth forms and native/non-native species groups)? We
anticipated that shrub, forb, and graminoid growth forms
overall would respond similarly to treatment, because all
these growth forms had evolved in often-disturbed mixed
conifer forest and each has mechanisms for persisting in
disturbed forest (Bradley et al., 1992). For example, many
species of each growth form readily resprout if top-killed
and also form soil seed banks to endure through or colonize
after disturbance (Abella and Springer, 2012). Although non-
native plants do not always require disturbance to become
established, disturbance often facilitates their establishment
and expansion (McGlone and Egan, 2009). Thus, we evalu-
ated the expectation that non-native plants would exhibit
stronger relative responses than native plants to distur-
bance, at least in the short term.
(4) Do understory responses to tree cutting and ﬁre differ
between moist and dry mixed conifer forest? Relative
responses in moist versus dry forest were difﬁcult to fore-
cast, owing to potential counteracting differences between
the forest types. For example, dry soil could limit response
in dry mixed conifer, yet dense tree canopy from higher tree
productivity in moister forest could reduce understories
(North et al., 2005), potentially creating similar understory
response to treatment between these forest types.
(5) How do understory responses vary with intensity of tree
cutting (e.g., proportion of trees removed) or severity of ﬁre?
We
forecasted
that
understory
plant
measures
would
increase with intensity of cutting and severity of ﬁre,
because overstory limitations imposed on the understory
would be alleviated through tree mortality (Fornwalt and
Kaufmann, 2014).
2. Study area and forest description
Mixed conifer forests frequently occupy elevations between
those supporting lower-elevation P. ponderosa or Pinus jeffreyi
(Jeffrey pine) forests and higher-elevation forests such as pure
Abies concolor (white ﬁr) or subalpine including Picea-Abies
(spruce-ﬁr) among different regions supporting mixed conifer for-
ests (Battaglia and Shepperd, 2007). Minimum elevation required
to support mixed conifer forests generally decreases from southern
to northern latitudes (Klenner et al., 2008). Major physiographic
regions occupied by mixed conifer forests include the inland Paciﬁc
Coast (e.g., Klamath and Sierra Nevada Mountains), Intermountain
Region, and Rocky Mountains (Fig. 1). Inland mixed conifer forests
occupy parts of northern Mexico, over 17 million ha in the western
United States (Schoennagel and Nelson, 2011), and 4 million ha in
southwestern Canada (British Columbia Ministry of Forests, 2010).
Local topography inﬂuences mixed conifer distribution within cli-
mate regions and elevation zones, with mixed conifer often inhab-
iting drainages or north aspects in areas otherwise supporting drier
forest. Precipitation in mixed conifer forests usually is about 30–
100 cm annually but can exceed 100 cm mainly in the western
Sierra Nevada, Klamath, and other mountains closest to the Paciﬁc
coast (Appendix A). Snow is common, often providing an important
source of early growing season moisture. Summers characteristi-
cally are dry, excepting areas receiving late-summer monsoonal
storms. Tree species vary by region, with dominants commonly
including P. ponderosa, A. concolor, Pseudotsuga menziesii (Doug-
las-ﬁr), and Pinus lambertiana (sugar pine). Historical forest struc-
ture generally was characterized by mostly (>50%) open areas
without tree canopy and interspersed clumps and individuals of
trees (Hagmann et al., 2013; Reynolds et al., 2013). Tree densities
historically ranged from ca. tens to hundreds per hectare among
regions and sites within regions (North et al., 2007; Fulé et al.,
S.R. Abella, J.D. Springer / Forest Ecology and Management 335 (2015) 281–299
283

2009; Reynolds et al., 2013). Physiognomy of understories cur-
rently varies broadly from shrubby, grassy, or forb-dominated, to
sparsely vegetated with extensive O horizons (Gruell, 1983;
Fites-Kaufman et al., 2007).
Mixed conifer forests are dynamic and shaped by disturbance,
with long-term evolutionary development providing a baseline
for comparing characteristics of present forest (Covington et al.,
1994). Anderson et al. (2008), for instance, reported temporal
development of mixed conifer forest in the Jemez Mountains,
New Mexico: Picea parkland inhabited the area 14,000 years ago
after the glacial period, P. ponderosa colonized by ca. 11,500 years
ago during a warmer climate, and with increased moisture by
6400 years ago, mixed conifer forest arose resembling present tree
composition (P. menziesii, A. concolor, P. ponderosa, and others).
Charcoal inﬂux sharply increased after 4600 years ago, suggesting
a long history of ﬁre, and consistent with a more recent tree-
ring-derived
ﬁre
interval
of
35 years
from
1624
to
1902
(Anderson et al., 2008). Many mixed-conifer forests sustained ﬁres
at least as frequent (often <10-year return intervals) as those in P.
ponderosa forests, but longer return intervals (including longer
than 50 years) could occur in moister forest or where topography
limited ﬁre spread, and during climatic periods unfavorable to ﬁre
spread. Mixed-severity ﬁre regimes, consisting mostly of low-
intensity surface ﬁre punctuated by more severe surface ﬁre or
patches of crown ﬁre (Fulé et al., 2003), have been broadly reported
in mixed conifer forests from Mexico (Minnich et al., 2000) through
the U.S. to Canada (Heyerdahl et al., 2012). Seasonality of ﬁre var-
ied from spring/summer (Fulé et al., 2003) to predominately late
summer or fall (Taylor, 2004). In addition to ﬁre, periodic
windthrow, insect/disease outbreaks, and extreme climatic events
created spatial and temporal heterogeneity via patch creation from
individual tree death to larger areas hectares in size (Veblen et al.,
2012). These disturbances likely created different biophysical ﬁl-
ters to understory vegetation, both within stands and landscapes,

and through time on the same site (Keith et al., 2010; Lydersen
et al., 2013).
Few deﬁnitions exist of mixed conifer forest (also described as
mixed evergreen) in the literature, with one of the few provided
by Reynolds et al. (2013) speciﬁc to the Southwest: forest occupy-
ing elevations between 1525 and 3050 m, sustaining relatively
frequent (<35 year ﬁre-return interval) surface ﬁre including some
mixed-severity effects, and containing species mixtures of shade-
intolerant P. ponderosa and shade-tolerant P. menziesii or A. concol-
or depending on seral stage. Throughout the range of mixed conifer
forest in western North America, tree species present, ﬁre regimes,
and elevations inhabited vary among regions (Agee, 1993; Fites-
Kaufman et al., 2007; Jain et al., 2012). We deﬁne mixed conifer
forest as: mixtures of two or more conifer tree species at interme-
diate elevation (above lower forests such as P. ponderosa forest but
below higher forests such as Picea–Abies) that occupy inland conti-
nental locations generally of semi-arid climate in western North
America. We consider only stands with two or more conifer species
sharing overstory dominance to be mixed conifer, which excludes
stands such as pure overstory P. ponderosa invaded by other coni-
fers in the understory. In our study, we include both dry and moist
mixed conifer, as well as forest with some Populus tremuloides
(quaking aspen), but not pure Populus forest. Reynolds et al.
(2013) distinguished dry mixed conifer as having mean ﬁre inter-
vals of <35 years (and >35 years for moist) and occupying south
aspects or other dry topographic positions. Dry versus moist types
are usually differentiated on a relative basis on regional (e.g., cli-
matically moister versus drier regions) or within-landscape (e.g.,
opposing north versus south aspects) scales (Jain et al., 2012).
3. Methods
3.1. Data collection
We systematically obtained literature addressing our study
questions by searching literature databases, screening articles for
meeting inclusion criteria, and preparing a database including each
study’s ﬁndings. In April 2014, we searched for articles in the fol-
lowing databases: AGRICOLA, Agris, Academic Search Complete,
BioOne, ProQuest (including Biological Sciences, Environmental
Science, GeoRef, and Zoological Record), Web of Science, Forest Sci-
ence Database (CABdirect), Treesearch, and GoogleScholar. We
used the following search words and their combinations for article
titles and key words: forest, mixed conifer, coniferous, evergreen,
understory, understorey, plants, vegetation, forb, shrub, grass, col-
onization, indicator species, seed, revegetation, species richness,
diversity, regeneration, recruitment, composition, succession, tree,
overstory, cutting, felling, thinning, removal, silviculture, shelter-
wood, harvest, timber, density, fuel, reduction, treatment, manage-
ment, restoration, burning, ﬁre, and wildﬁre. We also examined the
reference list of each located article for other pertinent articles.
We screened the 128 relevant articles located by this search for
their suitability for inclusion in the systematic analysis by requir-
ing that studies meet all of the following criteria. First, studies
must be in western North American mixed conifer forest, following
our deﬁnition. Second, they must present primary, quantitative
data on response of an understory species or community to tree
cutting or ﬁre. Third, studies must provide a benchmark (pre-treat-
ment condition, untreated/unburned condition, or both) against
which to compare effects of tree cutting or ﬁre. By making these
relative comparisons of treatment effects within studies, potential
differences in vegetation measurement methods, climatic time
periods in which data were collected, or other factors that can con-
found comparisons among studies should be minimized within
studies. Fourth, for studies of wildﬁres, they must also have
included areas not subject to post-ﬁre rehabilitation treatments
such as seeding or fertilization. This criterion is important because
post-ﬁre treatments can impact species composition by both
directly introducing new species and inﬂuencing the course of nat-
ural recovery (Crane et al., 1983; Peppin et al., 2010). If wildﬁre
studies included areas receiving post-ﬁre rehabilitation treatments
and those that did not, we only included data from sites not receiv-
ing post-ﬁre treatments. Fifth, studies must be published, either as
journal articles, conference proceedings, government serial publi-
cations, book chapters, or books.
3.2. Data analysis
We created a database from quantitative results presented for
any available understory measure in articles. The main measures
presented were plant cover and species richness, but some papers
reported biomass, plant density, shrub survival or vigor, and soil
seed bank density and species richness. Completeness of vegeta-
tion data varied, with some studies providing community compo-
sition
(species
present
and
their
relative
abundance)
or
components of the community (e.g., shrub cover only). Accord-
ingly, we used every study available for each of our study questions
independently, with some studies presenting comprehensive com-
munity data used for nearly all questions and other studies used
only for questions related to speciﬁc community components.
We calculated a total ‘abundance’ measure, derived from cover
whenever it was presented or from biomass or density, and a ‘rich-
ness’ measure, based on species density per sampling unit. When
multi-scale species richness estimates were presented (e.g., species
m2 and species 1000 m2), we averaged richness across scales but
noted any differences in response to treatment among spatial
scales. We used the longest-term data presented in a study, and
except for analyses to evaluate treatment intensity or burn sever-
ity, we averaged data across different intensities of a treatment
type (e.g., different levels of thinning) in the infrequent cases
where different intensities were presented.
From extracted data for both understory abundance and rich-
ness, we calculated a ratio of treatment:control or after:before
treatment. For studies with both pre-treatment data and controls,
we ﬁrst calculated the after:before ratio then used that to calculate
the treatment:control ratio. Some papers presented data as relative
differences (such as percent change from pre- to post-treatment),
which could result in negative ratios. Additionally, some studies
had zeros as denominators (e.g., if controls had zero plants), pre-
cluding calculation of ratios. In these cases, we simply calculated
the raw difference between after/before or treated/control values.
We considered conducting a formal statistical meta-analysis,
but the available data had several features that limited meta-
analysis. Presentation of relative differences (resulting in negative
values) or presence of zeros in some studies, together with many
papers not reporting a measure of variability or being unreplicated,
complicated calculation of meta-analytical statistics (Harrison,
2011). It is noteworthy, but not uncommon, that some of the most
ecologically insightful studies in our data set did not meet require-
ments for calculation of standard meta-analysis statistics, such as
Knapp et al.’s (2013) remeasurement of 79-year-old silvicultural
treatments installed in 1929. Another signiﬁcant issue was that,
for several of our questions, approximately equal proportions of
decreases and increases were reported across studies. Analyzing
an average or median effect size in this situation represented an
effect size (i.e., zero or no change) rarely or never actually occur-
ring in the literature.
We adopted a hybrid approach to data analysis by using a
combination of effect sizes (after:before or treatment:control
ratios) as appropriate, ranking relative responses to treatments,
and categorizing understory responses to treatment as relative

285

increase (ratios >1, or raw difference >0), no change (ratios = 1 or
difference = 0), or decrease (ratios <1, difference <0). For Question
1 (relative inﬂuences of treatments on total understory plant abun-
dance and species richness), we ranked relative responses of an
understory measure among treatments within a study (e.g., +++
signiﬁed the greatest increase among treatments in a study where
an understory measure increased in all three treatments) and as
increase (+) or decrease () if only one treatment was evaluated
in a study. For Question 2 (inﬂuence of time since treatment), we
regressed time since treatment with treatment : control ratio of
total plant abundance and species richness. For Question 3
(responses among plant groups), we categorized responses of
growth forms (shrub, forb, graminoid) as increase or decrease to
each treatment type (‘no change’ did not occur). We compiled
relative responses to treatment (in the same way as for Question
1) of non-native plants, because most studies that evaluated

non-natives applied treatments factorially to enable relative
ranking. No studies were identiﬁed that evaluated Question 4
(treatment effects in moist versus dry mixed conifer), but we did
assess potential relationships between long-term average precipi-
tation of a study area and understory response to treatment for
studies that provided precipitation data. For Question 5 (inﬂuence
of treatment intensity or ﬁre severity), we calculated the number
of studies in which the greatest response to treatment was in high
or low treatment intensity or burn severity. We designated the
cutting treatment that removed the most tree basal area to be most
intensive, and we used the classiﬁcation of severity presented in
papers for managed ﬁres (hereafter referred to as prescribed,
because no wildland ﬁre use ﬁres were reported) and wildﬁres (if
low, moderate, and high severity were all presented, we used
low and high). We summarized quality of evidence for each study
by tabulating metrics of study design (collection of pre-treatment
data, inclusion of unmanipulated controls, site replication, and rep-
lication across some type of environmental gradient such as soil
parent material or burn severity for wildﬁre) and duration of data
collection after treatment.
4. Results
4.1. Description of the literature
The systematic literature search identiﬁed 41 published studies,
reported in 50 articles (some studies were reported in >1 article),
which met inclusion criteria for quantitatively evaluating inﬂu-
ences of tree cutting and ﬁre on understory vegetation in western
mixed conifer forests (Table 1). Most articles were published
recently: 78% (39 of 50 articles) in the 2000s, 6% (3 articles) in
the 1990s, 4% (2 articles) each in the 1980s and 1970s, and 8% (4
articles) in the 1960s. Four studies, reported in 10 articles, were
from four of the network of sites in the U.S. Fire and Fire Surrogate
Study initiated in the early and mid-2000s (Table 1).
Studies covered a broad geographic area, being conducted in
one Canadian province (British Columbia, 5 studies, 12% of 41 stud-
ies) and seven states in the U.S.: Arizona (4 studies, 10%), New
Mexico (2, 5%), California (16, 39%), Oregon (4, 10%), Washington
(4, 10%), Montana (5, 12%), and Idaho (1, 2%). No studies were
identiﬁed from Mexico, although mixed conifer forests occur there.
Regions in which several studies were conducted included the Col-
orado Plateau in the Southwest, Sierra Nevada Mountains, Cascade
Mountains, Blue Mountains, northern Rocky Mountains, and inte-
rior British Columbia. Estimates of annual precipitation in study
areas were provided for 79% of studies and were commonly
40–80 cm yr1, with some study areas inland, but nearest the
coast, reporting >100 cm yr1 of precipitation (Appendix A). Spe-
cies richness and identity of dominant tree species were diverse
among studies. Overstory dominants commonly included P. pon-
derosa, Pseudotsuga menziesi, A. concolor, P. jeffreyi, P. lambertiana,
Calocedrus decurrens (incense cedar), Picea engelmannii (Engelmann
spruce), and nine others. About half (43%) of studies reported
average ﬁre intervals for their study areas before ﬁre exclusion in
1900. Fire was common in study areas, with intervals often
<10 years and usually <30 years. Longer intervals averaging 40–
75 years were reported in some study areas.
Dominant understory growth form (shrub, forb, graminoid, or
forbs and graminoids combined into an herbaceous category), in
the pre-treatment or control plant community, was identiﬁed in
46% of studies by providing cover or biomass across growth forms.
Seven (37%) of these 19 studies reported that shrubs were most
dominant, 11 (58%) that herbaceous understories predominated,
and 1 (5%) study reported equal shrub and herbaceous abundance.
Appendix B provides photographs from a range of studies illustrat-
ing understory condition.
Treatments evaluated were diverse and implemented for
numerous objectives, such as patch cutting to create openings for
wildlife (Patton, 1976), silvicultural improvement (e.g., Knapp
et al., 2013), timber harvest (e.g., Steele and Beaufait, 1969), resto-
ration of frequent ﬁre in a national park context (Webster and
Halpern, 2010), and hazardous fuel reduction (e.g., Mason et al.,
2009; Chiono et al., 2012). Twelve studies (29%) examined some
variation alone of tree cutting (e.g., patch cutting, tree thinning),
13 (31%) examined prescribed ﬁre alone, 10 (24%) evaluated com-
posite or factorially applied cut + burn treatments, and 6 (14%)
studies included wildﬁres.
4.2. Study designs and quality of evidence
Nearly half (43%) of studies had both pre-treatment data and
controls, with about the same percentage having only controls
and the remainder before/after designs (Appendix A). Most studies
(71%) included replicated treated sites. No study replicated sites
across any type of stratiﬁed environmental gradient such as eleva-
tion or soil parent material, but three studies of wildﬁres stratiﬁed
by burn severity (Stark et al., 2006; Donato et al., 2009; Crotteau
et al., 2013). The time since treatment that measurements were
made ranged from <1 year to P10 years (Thill et al., 1983;
Chiono et al., 2012; Lochhead and Comeau, 2012; Crotteau et al.,
2013), including the longest-term studies of 19 (Battles et al.,
2001), 20 (Webster and Halpern, 2010), and 79 (Knapp et al.,
2013) years after treatment. Most studies (63%) were of short
duration, measuring response a maximum of three years post-
treatment.
4.3. Evidence for responses to treatments
4.3.1. Question 1 (relative inﬂuences of treatments on total understory
plant abundance and species richness)
Cutting and
prescribed ﬁre
applied individually similarly
increased understory plant abundance (usually measured as cover)
or species richness in about half of studies (Fig. 2). Applying cutting
and prescribed ﬁre together typically resulted in decreased plant
abundance, but increased species richness.
4.3.2. Question 2 (inﬂuence of time since treatment)
The longest-term studies usually found increases in total under-
story plant measures after cutting or prescribed ﬁre (Fig. 3). The
ﬁve longest-term (8 to 19 years after treatment) studies of cutting
(that included total plant measures) all reported increases in total
plant abundance, and seven of the eight studies (87%) P4 years in
duration found increases. In comparison, only 2 of 10 studies (20%)
with durations <4 years reported increases. For prescribed ﬁre, the
two longest-term studies (6 and 20 years) reported the greatest
increase in total plant abundance. There were fewer data points
for cutting and prescribed ﬁre applied together, and no study
exceeded 4 years in duration.
Species richness was measured in fewer long-term cutting stud-
ies than was plant abundance, but the greatest relative increase
also was reported in the longest-term study of 19 years (Fig. 3).
Although the two longest-term (6 and 20 years) studies of pre-
scribed ﬁre reported the 2nd and 3rd greatest increase in richness,
the greatest increase occurred in a study two years post-ﬁre. Nev-
ertheless, only a third of nine studies 64 years in duration reported
increased richness. After cutting + prescribed ﬁre, the two shortest-
term studies (both of 1 year) both reported declines in richness,
whereas four of ﬁve studies of P2 years reported increases.
Other long-term studies evaluating speciﬁc components of the
plant community illustrated post-treatment dynamics. Chiono

287

et al. (2012) found that the oldest fuel treatments (cut + prescribed
ﬁre) 8–15 years old exhibited the highest shrub cover (16%) rela-
tive to controls (7%), compared to younger treatments 2–7 years
old in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Knapp et al. (2013) reported
that shrub cover was reduced from 29% before selection cutting
in 1929 to 15% after treatment, rebounded to near pre-treatment
levels by two years after treatment in 1931, and declined to 3%
at 79 years after cutting in 2008. Similarly, herbaceous species
richness averaged 1.5 species/4 m2 in 1929 before cutting, declined
to 1.0 species later that summer after cutting but doubled two
years after cutting, and again declined to 1.0 species/4 m2 in
2008. Tree density by 2008 was more than twice that (739
compared to 315 trees ha1) before cutting in 1929, and repeat
photographs depicted a shift from forest ﬂoors dominated by shrub
cover to thick O horizons (Appendix B5). Ten years after wildﬁre,
Crotteau et al. (2013) reported that shrub cover was 2–8 times
greater across burn severities compared to unburned forest. Simi-
larly, Lochhead and Comeau (2012) found that graminoid and
shrub cover were about 1.4 times greater than controls at 15 years
after selective cutting in British Columbia. Collectively, results of
these studies supported those of the long-term studies evaluating
total community measures in ﬁnding that understory measures
were increased on older treatments, though Knapp et al. (2013)
suggested limits to treatment longevity associated with tree
canopy inﬁlling.
4.3.3. Question 3 (responses among plant groups)
Forbs and graminoids increased more frequently in abundance
than did shrubs across cutting, prescribed ﬁre, and combined
cutting + ﬁre treatments (Fig. 4a–c). Shrub abundance usually
decreased after treatments, a trend particularly evident after com-
bined cutting + ﬁre, where seven of eight (13%) studies reported
that shrubs declined. Fewer studies measured species richness
than measured cover, and no conclusive trends in richness
emerged, except that forb richness may increase more frequently
after treatment than other plant groups. Results were mixed after
wildﬁres: half of studies reported decreases in shrub cover while
half reported increases (Fig. 4d).
Frequency and magnitude of increase in non-native plant
abundance (which was exclusively reported as cover) was least
after cutting, intermediate after prescribed ﬁre, and greatest after
cutting + prescribed ﬁre (Fig. 5). Non-native species richness
increased after all treatments, and most vigorously when cutting
and prescribed ﬁre were both applied, in all studies measuring
non-native richness. Despite these increases, non-natives com-
prised only small portions of total plant cover and richness. For
example, non-native cover six years after prescribed ﬁre was 1%
(compared to 49% native) in mixed conifer forest in Grand Canyon
National Park of Arizona (Huisinga et al., 2005), also 1% (compared
to 12% native) one year after cutting + prescribed ﬁre in the Sierra
Nevada Mountains of California (Collins et al., 2007), and 10%
(compared to 58% native and 4% non-native cover in the control)
three years after cutting + ﬁre in the University of Montana Lubr-
echt Experimental Forest (Dodson and Fiedler, 2006). Thus, native
species largely constituted the total plant abundance and richness
measures and corresponding responses to treatments (Fig. 2). It is
noteworthy that few non-native plant data are available for
wildﬁre to compare with cutting and prescribed ﬁre.
4.3.4. Question 4 (treatment effects in moist versus dry mixed conifer)
No studies compared response to treatment between moist and
dry mixed conifer forest. Effect sizes for total plant abundance after
cutting (r2 = 0.04, n = 18) and prescribed ﬁre (r2 = 0.01, n = 13) were
not closely related to average long-term precipitation in study
areas, indicating little relationship between response to treatment
and average precipitation in this data set. Similarly, there was little
relationship between effect sizes for species richness and average
long-term precipitation of study areas for cutting (r2 = 0.11,
n = 10) or prescribed ﬁre (r2 = 0.00, n = 12).
4.3.5. Question 5 (inﬂuence of treatment intensity or ﬁre severity)
Results were mixed for the few studies comparing cutting
intensity (Fig. 6). For prescribed ﬁre and wildﬁre, high-severity
burning generally (4 of 5 studies) displayed greater increase in
total plant abundance and richness than did low-severity burning.
5. Discussion
Consistency of available evidence with our a priori expectations
varied among our ﬁve speciﬁc questions and among understory
metrics. Increasing plant abundance did not occur along the
expected gradient of prescribed ﬁre < cutting < cutting + prescribed
ﬁre (less information was available for wildﬁre). About the
same proportion of cutting and prescribed ﬁre studies reported
increases,
and
cutting + ﬁre
together

in
decreases, but as will be discussed, these were short-term results.
Cutting + prescribed ﬁre did induce the largest increase in species
richness, but increases occurred less frequently after prescribed
ﬁre alone than after cutting alone. Time since treatment was
related to understory response, but contrary to our expectation,
the longest-term studies reported the greatest increases, with the
exception of a 79-year study likely exceeding treatment longevity
in the absence of ﬁre (Knapp et al., 2013). Although each plant

increased compared to shrubs. This differed from our expectation
of similar responses among growth forms, although variability
among studies was high. Consistent with our expectation, non-
native plants increased more frequently after treatment than did
natives, but it is noteworthy that non-native plants were sparse
after treatments compared to native species. Insufﬁcient evidence
existed to compare response of moist and dry mixed conifer
understories. Few studies compared intensities of cutting or
severities of ﬁre, and results were mixed for response of plant
abundance to cutting, but increases were generally greatest after
higher severity than lower severity ﬁre.
In interpreting ﬁndings, some key points explored in the follow-
ing sections include short- versus long-term dynamics in post-
treatment understories; factors such as amount of tree canopy
cover removed, treatment implementation operations, slash, and
grazing potentially inﬂuencing understory response in both the
short and long term; a possible tradeoff in short-term decrease of
understory abundance (total community cover or biomass) with
enhancements of disturbance-promoted native species; condition
of the pre-treatment plant community (including soil seed banks)
and often a century of ﬁre exclusion as a factor in post-treatment
response; and treatment strategies requiring further experimenta-
tion, such as delaying prescribed ﬁre following tree cutting. It is
also noteworthy that none of the 41 studies had a goal to ‘restore
the understory’. Rather, project goals included reducing fuels,
meeting silvicultural objectives (e.g., timber harvest, sanitation
cuts), or promoting forage availability to livestock and wildlife.
Thus, a potential criticism of the studies – that reference conditions
(before disruption of disturbance regimes beginning in the middle-
1800s) for understories of mixed conifer forests are poorly under-
stood – is not applicable, because study goals were to assess effects
of manipulating tree structure and ﬁre on understory vegetation
and not to ‘restore’ the understory. Even when tree cutting or ﬁre
reduced total understory abundance in the short term, there was
no evidence that these treatments eliminated species within study
areas. On the contrary, there was evidence that treatments mini-
mally
inﬂuenced or
increased
native species
uncommon in
untreated forests, including some state-listed endemic species
(Harrod and Halpern, 2009), and all 7 long-term studies exceeding
5 years post-treatment reported increases in total plant abundance
and species richness. Collectively, published literature suggests a
model of understory response to cutting and ﬁre that often
includes short-term declines but long-term increases, and particu-
lar beneﬁts to disturbance-promoted native understory species. It
is possible that these species had been reduced by ﬁre exclusion
and concurrent tree canopy closure during the past century.
5.1. Time since treatment and long-term studies
Declines in understory vegetation (especially in abundance)
relative to pre-treatment or controls were commonly reported
for the ﬁrst few years after treatment, but most longer term studies
exceeding 4 years after treatment reported increases in understory
Fig. 3. Relationship between time since treatment and response of total understory plant abundance (cover, biomass, or density) and species richness among treatments in
mixed conifer forests of western North America. Treatment : control ratios exceeding 1.0 (above broken horizontal lines) indicate that treatments increased understory
measures. Note how the longest-term studies, exceeding 6 years post-treatment, usually found that treatments increased understory measures. Coefﬁcients of determination
(r2) are given when they exceeded 0.10 (note for [d], the high r2 largely results from the single long-term study).

vegetation. In examining the 7 longest-term studies which all
found increases in plant cover or richness, the studies included 5
cutting and 2 prescribed ﬁre studies, were widely distributed geo-
graphically from the Southwest to British Columbia, and included
several different assemblages of overstory trees and understories
dominated by shrubs or herbaceous vegetation. In addition to
being long term, the main commonality among these studies was
that substantial reduction in overstory tree abundance was
achieved and the reduction persisted. Two cutting studies in Ari-
zona had no residual trees in patch cuts up to 1 ha in size
(Patton, 1976; Ffolliott and Gottfried, 1989), and Huisinga et al.
(2005), also in Arizona, had 30% tree canopy cover after prescribed
ﬁre compared to 63% in unburned areas. Nineteen years after a
shelterwood cut in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California, basal
area was 10 m2 ha1 compared to 80 m2 ha1 in controls (Battles
et al., 2001). Also in the Sierra Nevada, Webster and Halpern
(2010) found that prescribed ﬁre reduced tree density by 60%,
and density in burned areas remained proportionally lower than
unburned areas for their 20-year study. Similarly, density was
reduced by 56% in Siegel and DeSante (2003) in the Sierra Nevada,
and basal area by 33% in Lochhead and Comeau (2012) in British
Columbia 15 years after selection cutting.
Annual variation in weather during post-treatment periods
could inﬂuence response to treatment in both the short and long
term, but this is difﬁcult to evaluate because few studies exceeding
four years in duration measured multiple post-treatment years.
Webster and Halpern (2010) was one of the few studies to do so,
ﬁnding that cover increased slightly 2 and 5 years after prescribed
burning but did not differ signiﬁcantly from controls until 10 years
post-ﬁre. The years post-ﬁre corresponded with different calendar
years depending on when different sites were burned, complicat-
ing relating vegetation dynamics with weather patterns. Other
long-term studies gathered post-treatment measurements in years
of below average (Huisinga et al., 2005) or near average precipita-
tion (Thill et al., 1983).
5.2. Short-term declines: importance of time, overstory, slash, plant
damage, and herbivory
Numerous
factors
could
relate
to
why
most
short-term
(<4 years) studies found declines in understory plant abundance
after treatments. In the two shortest-term studies of 0.5 years,
for example, cutting or prescribed ﬁre was implemented in fall
and the post-treatment measurement occurred the following
spring or early summer, so warm-season plants in particular may
not have had opportunity to initiate growth (Bêche et al., 2005;
Cram et al., 2007). It should be noted, however, that primary goals

abundance after prescribed ﬁre in one study (Collins et al., 2007). Number of studies

of these studies were to evaluate short-term treatment effects on
stream chemistry (Bêche et al., 2005) or soil erosion (Cram et al.,
2007), not on understory vegetation. Moreover, temporal photos
in follow-up by Cram et al. (2007) suggested increasing amounts
of understory cover (Appendix B1).
Treatments that do not appreciably reduce overstory tree can-
opy cover may not substantially change the understory. The four
ﬁre and ﬁre surrogate studies – all of which reported short-term
declines in understory abundance – noted that reductions in over-
story cover were often relatively subtle, post-treatment overstory
cover was likely greater than in historical forests, and relatively
dense post-treatment overstories may have limited understory
growth (e.g., Metlen et al., 2004; Dodson et al., 2008). Prescriptions
were not tailored speciﬁcally to promote understories, as the pri-
mary objective of these studies was to modify fuel conditions such
that 80% of dominant or co-dominant trees in the post-treatment
forest would survive wildﬁre modeled under 80th percentile
weather conditions (McIver et al., 2013). Some authors of other
studies, such as Mason et al. (2009), also suspected that minimal
treatment effects on the overstory tempered understory response
within one or more of their treatment units.
Relationships depicted in regression equations between over-
story tree abundance and understory measures in untreated mixed
conifer forests may provide a framework for estimating overstory
reductions needed to stimulate understory vegetation (Larson
and Wolters, 1983; Page et al., 2005). For example, in Rocky Moun-
tain mixed conifer forests of Colorado, Mitchell and Bartling (1991)
reported that understory biomass averaged 535 g m2 when tree
canopy cover was 11–40%, but when tree cover exceeded 60%,
understory biomass was reduced by 84% to only 86 g m2. In Idaho
Abies grandis (grand ﬁr)–P. menziesii forest, understory biomass
exceeded 1000 kg ha1 only up to 40% tree canopy cover (Pyke
and Zamora, 1982). Similarly, Hedrick et al. (1968) found that
understory production was lowered by over half when tree canopy
cover exceeded 40% in the Blue Mountains of Oregon. A doubling of
tree basal area from 11.5 m2 ha1 to 23 m2 ha1 also approxi-
mately halved understory biomass in the White Mountains of
Arizona (Thill et al., 1983). While speciﬁc quantities vary among
regions and likely with soil properties within regions, <40–50% tree
canopy cover is apparently a threshold above which understory
production is minimal. Moreover, treatments need to reduce tree
cover down to roughly 20–30% to achieve vigorous understory pro-
duction based on these overstory-understory relationships (Larson
and Wolters, 1983). Similarly, reductions in basal area down to
<20 m2 ha1,
and
commonly
8–15 m2 ha1,
are
apparently
approximate thresholds for understory abundance (Thill et al.,
1983; Battles et al., 2001; Lochhead and Comeau, 2012).
Residual slash following tree cutting may play a major, but
poorly understood, role in post-treatment understory dynamics.
Slash can decrease understory vegetation by burying plants
(Metlen et al., 2004), or through other mechanisms such as immo-
bilization of soil nutrients in carbon-enriched soil (Perry et al.,
2010). These negative impacts, at least at the heavy loadings of
slash resulting from contemporary densely treed forests, appar-
ently outweigh any positive effects like creation of shaded micro-
sites. Slash can persist for some time: Munger and Westveld
(1931) noted that slash scattered in Oregon dry conifer forest
remained largely intact for 7 years and partially broke up by
15 years, with piled slash largely intact longer than 15 years.
How slash was handled was not always speciﬁed in papers of our
systematic review, and methods of treating slash rarely tested. At
least ﬁve studies scattered slash (e.g., Metlen et al., 2004; Metlen
and Fiedler, 2006; Collins et al., 2007; Cram et al., 2007; Dodson
et al., 2008) and others moved it off site (Ffolliott and Gottfried,
1989). Among studies examining slash handling methods, Mason
et al. (2009) found that piling slash correlated with lower site-level
understory biomass than did scattering slash. Two studies found
that burning slash (either scattered, Steele and Beaufait (1969),
or chipped slash, Walker et al. (2012)) reduced plant cover more
than simply leaving the scattered or chipped slash.
Studies focused on effects of slash on understory vegetation in
other western forests have mainly reported that slash negatively
impacts understories and provide comparisons of treatment
options that may be applicable to mixed conifer forests. In thinned
New Mexico pinyon-juniper woodlands, Brockway et al. (2002)
reported that plant abundance was greatest when slash was moved
off site, compared to scattering slash or leaving it around cut trees.
Similarly, in thinned Sierra Nevada P. ponderosa forest, Kane et al.
(2010) found that plant cover increased most after removing slash
compared to mastication or mastication + ﬁre. In Arizona P. ponder-
osa (Korb et al., 2004) and Colorado Pinus contorta (lodgepole pine)
forest (Fornwalt and Rhoades, 2011), burning piled slash sterilized
soil and essentially eliminated plant cover in areas that had been
underneath piles. Collectively, these observations suggest that
slash (and associated slash treatments) can temper understory
response to tree cutting and may be related to reductions in under-
story vegetation reported in some short-term studies of this
review. While in some cases it may be practical to move slash off
site, such as moving slash to cover decommissioned roads or skid
trails, transporting slash off site is usually impractical, necessitat-
ing that slash be left or treated on site (Jones, 1974). Deciding

signiﬁes greatest overstory reduction) or severity of ﬁre in mixed conifer forests of
western North America. For example, for (a), two studies found that shrub
abundance was highest in the most intensive cutting treatment, while one study
found that shrub abundance was highest in a low-intensity cutting treatment.

whether to leave slash untreated on site, or to choose among can-
didate treatments for slash (e.g., broadcast burning, pile burning,
mastication), represents tradeoffs among balancing ﬁre hazard,
economic costs, limiting insect/disease potential that can be exac-
erbated through concentrating dead wood, and aesthetics (Seidel
and Cochran, 1981; Kreye et al., 2014). Further research that com-
pares inﬂuences of slash treatment methods on vegetation in the
short and long term in mixed conifer forest is warranted.
Tree cutting operations and ﬁre can damage or kill plants,
requiring time for them to recover, especially in the short growing
season typifying mixed conifer forests (Metlen et al., 2004).
Depending on how and when (e.g., summer versus over snow
cover) tree cutting operations are implemented, soil disturbance
can be substantial. Young et al. (1967) reported that 39% of the
ground was disturbed in some way by a sanitation cut, and 62%
was disturbed on steep slopes when thinning trees using heavy
machinery (Cram et al., 2007). Machinery, as well as felling trees
by hand coupled with slash treatments, can damage or kill
aboveground plant parts or disturb root systems belowground
(Page-Dumroese et al., 1991). Similarly, ﬁre can damage or kill
plants, especially if they are a primary fuel (Kauffman and
Martin, 1990). Bedunah et al. (1999), for example, reported that
62% of Purshia tridentata (antelope bitterbrush) shrubs were killed
by even low-severity ﬁre in a Montana mixed conifer forest. If
extant vegetation, including root systems, is appreciably damaged
by treatment operations and without rapid recruitment from soil
seed banks or off-site seed sources, reduced understory vegetation
for one or more growing seasons following treatment may not be
surprising.
Based on the few studies that examined herbivory after treat-
ment, combined with herbivory exclusion research in mixed coni-
fer forests, herbivory (or lack thereof) may have inﬂuenced
understory responses. In one of the few studies in our review both
evaluating herbivory and ﬁnding short-term increases in plant
cover, Mason et al. (2009) concluded that incidence of grazing
was low, with no more than 15% of individual forbs and grasses
displaying evidence of grazing. Two studies evaluating grazing in
mixed conifer forests that had already been cut or burned reported
major inﬂuences of grazing on plant abundance and composition.
Kosco and Bartolome (1983) found that ungrazed Sierra Nevada
clearcuts had 3 times the plant cover of clearcuts grazed by cattle
and deer. Similarly, Riggs et al. (2000) found that understory bio-
mass in cut and burned Oregon mixed conifer forest ungrazed for
27–30 years was double that of grazed areas. Species richness, on
the other hand, often has been little affected or increased by
grazing, usually through positive responses of annuals and other
short-lived species (Riggs et al., 2000). More extensive research
in P. ponderosa forests has supported these ﬁndings: when appre-
ciable herbivores are present, plant abundance can be substantially
reduced, individual species can decrease or increase in response to
herbivory (Clary, 1975; Huffman et al., 2009), and plant richness
often is less inﬂuenced or increases depending on the forest over-
story (Bakker and Moore, 2007). Particularly in mixed conifer for-
est containing P. tremuloides, a tree whose recruitment is limited
by browsing, herbivory could also inﬂuence post-treatment under-
story dynamics via effects mediated through tree structure (Coop
et al., 2014). Where possible, overlaying herbivory treatments
(including excluding large herbivores) with tree cutting and ﬁre
may augment insight into understory dynamics.
5.3. Pre-treatment vegetation and soil seed banks
Pre-treatment condition of the plant community is likely a
major variable inﬂuencing post-treatment condition. Persistence
and priority effects, or species present initially being difﬁcult to
displace, appear strong in western coniferous forests (Kreyling
et al., 2008; McGlone et al., 2012; Halpern and Lutz, 2013). This
does not necessarily preclude new species from becoming estab-
lished, but rather that species present initially persist through
treatment even if their abundance is reduced (Dodson et al.,
2007). Mechanisms including resprouting and tight links between
soil seed banks and aboveground composition, promote species
persistence (Lyon and Stickney, 1976; Fischer and Clayton, 1983;
Bradley et al., 1992). The cutting + prescribed ﬁre treatment in this
review suggests species persistence, because plant abundance was
usually reduced immediately after treatment, but species richness
(driven by persistence with smaller components of new species)
was typically maintained or increased (Fig. 3c and f).
Interestingly, in one of the few studies to directly correlate
pre-
and
post-treatment
vegetation
within
individual
plots,
Dodson et al. (2008) reported that difference between pre- and
post-treatment understory cover and richness was negatively
related to pre-treatment levels. In other words, plots with the least
pre-treatment
understory
plant
cover
or
richness
generally
increased the most after treatment (in some cases nearly equaliz-
ing out pre-existing differences), leading to the conclusion that
treatments beneﬁt the least vegetated areas the most (Dodson
et al., 2008). This warrants assessment in other mixed conifer for-
ests, because a different expectation could be that areas with the
least pre-treatment vegetation respond the least, owing to sparse
seed production, depleted soil seed banks, and low potential for
vegetative propagation such as sprouting (Bossuyt and Hermy,
2001). Determining whether there is a critical amount of under-
story vegetation needed before treatment to produce a large
response, or whether convergence occurs after treatment, may
help explain variation in post-treatment dynamics. Moreover, bet-
ter understanding which species are ‘persisters’ or ‘colonizers’ –
likely a function of relative importance of aboveground vegetation
and soil seed banks – may be useful for forecasting treatment inﬂu-
ences given an initial assemblage of species (c.f. Dodson et al.,
2007).
Studies that relate soil seed bank composition to aboveground
vegetation, including before and after disturbance, can aid under-
standing plant community maintenance and recruitment mecha-
nisms (Archibold, 1989; Stark et al., 2006; Abella et al., 2007).
Further work is needed for detailed understanding of the role of
seed banks in understory response to treatments (e.g., estimates
of what proportion of the seed bank germinates following distur-
bance, or is lost to disturbance), and several studies have provided
a baseline by quantifying soil seed bank composition in untreated
mixed conifer forest. Overall conclusions from these studies sug-
gest that soil seed banks in mixed conifer forests are usually not
large (typically 61000 seeds m2 for the upper 5 cm of mineral
soil), but they can be species-rich (30 to >80 species) and contain
native perennials and shorter-lived species often associated with
disturbance (Strickler and Edgerton, 1976; Kramer and Johnson,
1987; Stark et al., 2006; Abella and Springer, 2012). Compared to
many other ecosystems, a unique feature of soil seed banks of
mixed conifer forests is that they often contain appreciable
amounts of native perennial species. For instance, native perenni-
als constituted 75% (of 78) of taxa in soil seed banks of mixed coni-
fer forests in Idaho (Kramer and Johnson, 1987) and 79% (of 39
taxa) in Nevada (Abella and Springer, 2012). Some of the dominant
perennials, such as Ceanothus velutinus (snowbrush ceanothus) in
Kramer and Johnson (1987), include species thought to be ﬁre-
stimulated (Conard and Radosevich, 1982; Weatherspoon, 1988).
Some of the shorter-lived species dominant in mixed conifer seed
banks, such as the annuals Chamerion angustifolium ssp. angustifo-
lium (ﬁreweed) and Epilobium ciliatum (fringed willowherb), are
also stimulated by ﬁre or disturbance to overstory or forest ﬂoor
(Stark et al., 2006). These studies have further reported that >85%
of taxa in soil seed banks were native (Kramer and Johnson,
292
S.R. Abella, J.D. Springer / Forest Ecology and Management 335 (2015) 281–299

1987; Stark et al., 2006; Abella and Springer, 2012). Collectively,
ﬁndings suggest that: (i) the relatively small size of soil seed banks
in mixed conifer forests may partly account for the typical lack of
rapid increase in post-treatment vegetation; (ii) native species
including perennials in the seed bank suggest longer term under-
story recruitment potential after treatments; and (iii) low amounts
of non-native species in seed banks may relate to the observed low
abundance of non-natives after treatments.
5.4. Comparing cutting and prescribed ﬁre, including disturbance-
promoted species
Tree cutting and prescribed ﬁre had similar overall inﬂuence on
total understory cover and richness. If burns are sufﬁciently severe
to reduce tree density, prescribed ﬁre and cutting may not be that
dissimilar in their inﬂuence on ecosystem properties affecting
understory vegetation (Ma et al., 2010; Fulé et al., 2012; North
et al., 2012). Both can expose mineral soil, via burning O horizons
or during cutting operations (Cram et al., 2007; Laughlin and Fulé,
2008). Both also usually at least temporarily decrease total ecosys-
tem nutrient pools (e.g., Clayton and Kennedy, 1985), but plant-
available nutrients can increase (Gundale et al., 2006).
Species composition may represent the greatest potential for
inﬂuences of cutting and prescribed ﬁre to diverge, such as through
germination cues. Some understory species of mixed conifer
forests,
including
Ceanothus
integerrimus
(deerbrush)
that
is
stimulated by heat (Kauffman and Martin, 1991) and Penstemon
spp. stimulated by smoke (Abella et al., 2007), may be favored by
ﬁre. Six studies reported groups of native species abundant after
prescribed ﬁre or cutting + ﬁre that are apparently ﬁre-dependent,
because the species were infrequent or absent in unburned forest,
including after tree cutting alone (Lyon, 1966; Huisinga et al.,
2005; Stark et al., 2006; Dodson et al., 2007; Knapp et al., 2007;
Dodson and Peterson, 2010). These ﬁre-stimulated groups were
mainly forbs and included species such as: perennial forbs C.
angustifolium (ﬁreweed), Claytonia perfoliata (miner’s lettuce), Epil-
obium glaberrimum (glaucus willowherb), Pseudognaphalium canes-
cens (Wright’s cudweed), and Lotus crassifolius (big deervetch); and
the annual forbs Epilobium brachycarpum (tall annual willowherb),
Gayophytum diffusum (spreading groundsmoke), and Cryptantha
simulans (pinewoods cryptantha). It is possible that these species
were once more common (at least ephemerally) in ﬁre-prone his-
torical forests.
Applying both cutting and prescribed ﬁre resulted in the
greatest invasion of non-native plants, but even in this treatment,
non-native cover was low (Dodson and Fiedler, 2006; Collins et al.,
2007; Dodson et al., 2008). Fiedler et al. (2013) hypothesized
potential pathways of post-treatment non-native plant dynamics,
including scenarios such as slight increases after treatment then
declines through time, versus increases and persistence in the trea-
ted forest. Non-native dynamics may partly depend on identity of
the invader, where perseverance of some species appears low (e.g.,
Verbascum thapsus [common mullein]), compared to high for spe-
cies such as Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass, Fiedler et al., 2013).
While non-natives are usually not prevalent in mixed conifer for-
ests, non-native plants generally have increased in western North
America (Keeley, 2006; Abella and Fornwalt, 2014). This increases
chance that some will become established in mixed conifer forest,
combined
with
expanding
wildland-urban
interfaces
likely
increasing opportunities for seed transport. Moreover, with rein-
troducing open stand structures and ﬁre, sustainability of the cur-
rent low invasion status of mixed conifer forests could be uncertain
(Keeley, 2006). It should be noted, however, that untreated forest
that burns in stand-replacing wildﬁre can become heavily invaded
over time (McGlone and Egan, 2009). These observations suggest
that: (1) monitoring non-native plant dynamics is warranted, (2)
consideration could be given to proactively treating incipient infes-
tations of priority species as a precautionary approach, and (3)
non-native abundance after severe wildﬁre is likely an appropriate
benchmark against which to compare non-native abundance after
tree cutting and prescribed ﬁre treatments (Abella, 2014).
5.5. Wildﬁre
Few studies of post-wildﬁre dynamics have been conducted in
mixed conifer forests, and few of these met our inclusion criteria.
The main unmet criterion was including either pre-ﬁre data (difﬁ-
cult for unplanned events such as wildﬁres) or comparisons to
unburned areas. Some studies not meeting inclusion criteria com-
pared ﬁre severities within a burned area, but this does not provide
insight into actual effect of burning (relative to no burning), which
was the focus of our analysis. We suggest that wherever possible,
studies of wildﬁres include unburned areas for comparison that
also can be monitored through time. On large wildﬁres exceeding
tens of thousands of hectares, unburned areas may not exist
nearby, yet measuring unburned areas as close as possible would
represent unburned forest now extant on the landscape.
Some preliminary expectations for wildﬁre effects developed
from extant research of wildﬁre inﬂuences on mixed conifer
understories include reductions in shrub soil seed banks (Stark
et al., 2006; Knapp et al., 2012), variable responses of shrub cover
which might hinge on the pre-ﬁre shrub community (Donato et al.,
2009; Knapp et al., 2012; Crotteau et al., 2013; Walker et al., 2013),
increased total species richness and forb abundance (Donato et al.,
2009; Walker et al., 2013), and contingency of effects upon ﬁre
severity likely partly mediated through overstory tree mortality
(Stark et al., 2006; Crotteau et al., 2013). Research also suggests
probable increases in understory native plant cover and richness
after severe burning where tree overstories are mostly or com-
pletely removed (Newland and DeLuca, 2000; Laughlin and Fulé,
2008; Fornwalt and Kaufmann, 2014). Stand-replacing ﬁres, where
in
formerly
frequent-ﬁre
forest
containing
old
trees,
are
catastrophic from a forest ecosystem perspective, but may create
species-rich understory communities for at least decades (Abella
and Fornwalt, 2014).
5.6. Is active revegetation warranted?
Short-term reductions in vegetation cover after treatment or
reductions in certain species after wildﬁre may invoke consider-
ation of seeding or planting nursery-grown plants to attempt
actively accelerating plant establishment (Peppin et al., 2010). It
should be noted that actively augmenting seeds or plants is only
effective if plant propagules are actually limiting to plant establish-
ment (Turnbull et al., 2000). If other factors, such as drought, over-
story density, or herbivory are limiting, active revegetation is
unlikely to have much inﬂuence. Seeding after wildﬁre in western
forests has been controversial, partly from using non-native plants
(or exotic genetics); it often is unclear if seeding is needed or inter-
feres with natural recovery; and it can be expensive and prone to
failure (Peppin et al., 2010). Using native seed can reduce some
of this concern, but better understanding long-term understory
dynamics (to evaluate if seeding is even necessary) and manipulat-
ing other factors such as slash or grazing to understand their
effects on plant establishment after tree cutting or ﬁre would be
warranted. Another consideration, little discussed, is the possibil-
ity of identifying uncommon native species, such as those poten-
tially associated with ﬁre (or, conversely, vulnerable to severe
ﬁre in the case of wildﬁre), and focusing any active revegetation
treatments on those species. Seeding has facilitated native plant
establishment on discrete disturbances such as sterilized soil of
burned slash piles (Korb et al., 2004; Fornwalt and Rhoades,

2011). Planting greenhouse-grown plants has effectively revege-
tated decommissioned forest roads, skid trails, landings, and
post-tree thinning areas, where plant survival has exceeded 70%
(Page and Bork, 2005; Abella and Springer, 2009). Using nursery-
grown plants to create vegetated patches, which then can produce
seed themselves, can be a more reliable revegetation strategy than
attempting seeding across large areas. There may be a place for
active revegetation in mixed conifer forest management, such as
for areas severely disturbed by treatment operations, but possible
disadvantages (including cost) need to be balanced against other
strategies for promoting understories, including managing herbiv-
ory, treating slash, and controlling non-native plants.
5.7. Conclusion
Two of the most important factors in understory dynamics after
tree cutting and ﬁre in mixed conifer forests were time since treat-
ment and speciﬁc operational aspects of treatments (e.g., whether
cutting and ﬁre were applied together, and amount of forest over-
story removed). Understory measures often declined for the ﬁrst
few years after treatment, but subsequently increased if forest
overstories had been reduced to well below 40–50% canopy cover.
There are often ﬁre-stimulated native species in the understory
ﬂora that are uncommon in long-unburned mixed conifer forests
and after tree cutting alone, but that are stimulated by prescribed
burns or wildﬁres. Non-native plants were generally sparse and
subordinate in abundance to native species in both untreated for-
est and after cutting and prescribed ﬁre, but long-term monitoring
and precautionary non-native plant control warrant consideration
if maintaining this status quo is a management goal. Based on our
review of existing literature, further research needs include: (i)
assessing effects of speciﬁc components of treatment operations
(e.g., cutting intensity and residual spatial arrangements of trees,
methods of slash treatment, grazing management) and their inter-
action on understory trajectories; (ii) comparing responses in
moist versus dry mixed conifer forest; (iii) evaluating long-term
similarities and differences between tree cutting and prescribed
ﬁre regimes and their combination; (iv) further identifying groups
of native species beneﬁting from treatments or sensitive to treat-
ment alternatives; (v) determining feasibility of forecasting treat-
ment effects based on the initial plant community including seed
bank composition; and (vi) more thoroughly understanding inﬂu-
ences of wildﬁres. For operational monitoring of projects, early
monitoring is important to detect an initial surge in disturbance-
promoted species (both native and non-native). However, the
delayed increase in total understory plant cover and richness
indicated that monitoring for at least 4 years after treatment is
necessary to accurately appraise longer term trajectories of
post-treatment understories. Monitoring both total understory
measures and management-priority groups of species (e.g., ﬁre-
stimulated ﬂora, or shrubs for browse) is useful for identifying
whether further management (e.g., non-native species control)
can provide competitive advantages to desired species groups.
We conclude that native understory species, even if temporarily
reduced in abundance, persist through tree cutting and prescribed
ﬁre and have beneﬁted from these treatments after 5 years
post-treatment, as long as forest overstories remain open.
