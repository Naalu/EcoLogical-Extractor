ABSTRACT
Reintroduction of Þre and thinning have been suggested as the main practices to regain
forest health in northern Arizona ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Lawson) forests. Criteria
for assessing the impact of such management practices in the forest are based on benchmark
reconstructed conditions resembling pre-European forest stand structure and on the enhancement of
tree vigor. A range of forest conditions currently exists including stands that have been unmanaged,
thinned only, thinned plus prescribed burned and burned by wildÞre. A surrogate taxon was used to
assessforestconditionundercriteriaofmaintaininghabitatfornativespeciesoperatingatthesoillevel.
We assessed changes occurring in ground beetle assemblages at the stand scale as related to changes
that had occurred in forest stands previously treated with the above treatments. A pitfall-trapping
scheme was deployed during the summer months of 1998, 1999, and 2000. A total of 4,452 specimens
was caught representing 15 genera and 20 species of ground beetles. We found that species diversity
increased as the level of disturbance increased. The indicator species assemblage found on the wildÞre
treatment was represented by species in the genera Amara and Harpalus that are characteristic of
dry-open habitats. Unmanaged stands generally had the lowest diversity and the assemblage was
dominated by the species Synuchus dubius (Leconte). The thinned only stands did not signiÞcantly
vary from unmanaged stands in species assemblage. Cyclotrachelus constrictus (Say) was indicative of

unmanaged and thinned only stands without a shift toward an open-area dominant assemblage as
occurred in the stands burned by wildÞre.

PONDEROSA PINE (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex. Lawson)
forests in northern Arizona are considered to be in
poor forest health because interruption of natural pro-
cesses such as Þre and grazing have generated over-
crowded stands with stagnated trees, impaired nutri-
ent cycling and reduced tree vigor (Covington et al.
1997, Feeney et al. 1998). Consequences of maintain-
ing ponderosa pine forests in such a condition include
a high risk of catastrophic stand replacing Þres (Cov-
ington et al. 1997), bark beetle outbreaks (Goyer et al.
1998), and low understory plant diversity (Covington
and Moore 1994).
Reintroduction of Þre and thinning has been sug-
gested as the main practice to regain forest health in
northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests. Criteria for
assessing forest health in restoration projects in north-
ern Arizona have been based on benchmark recon-
structed conditions resembling pre-European forest
stand structure (Fule´ et al. 1997, Mast et al. 1999) and
enhancement of tree vigor (Kolb et al. 1998). How-
ever, the effects of reintroduction of Þre and thinning
on biodiversity components have never been evalu-
ated at the scale these disturbances commonly occur.
Ehrlich (1996) suggested that one of the goals of forest
management, including Þre management, should be to
maximize the preservation of native species. Also,
Niemela¨ (1999) proposed that thinning techniques
should be properly applied to maintain biodiversity.
However, a full understanding of how forest man-
agement practices can be improved to preserve native
species is limited by the overwhelming effort required
to assess total species richness and interactions in a
given area and evaluate disturbance effect across
structural and functional biodiversity components
(Noss 1990). Niemela¨ (1999) proposed that new tim-
ber harvesting methods should promote ecosystem
recovery using surrogate taxa for evaluating the suc-
cess of applied techniques. Several taxa of insects have
been used as suitable indicators of biodiversity and
environmental change because of their abundance,
diversity, ubiquitous occurrence and importance in

ecosystem function (Samways 1994). Insects may re-
ßect changes in ecosystem processes by integrating
time and landscape factors, in a way physical and
chemical indicators cannot (Danks 1992).
The study we report here is part of a multi-disci-
plinary research program currently being conducted
in northern Arizona to determine stand treatment
inßuences on forest health (STIFH), based on se-
lected ecological indicators (Bailey et al. 2000). We
used the ground beetle guild to determine its potential
use as a bioindicator of ecosystem recovery in north-
ern Arizona ponderosa pine forests. We chose this
guild because it has been proven to be sensitive to
changes due to Þre, logging or a combination thereof
in some forest ecosystems (Lenski 1982, Richardson
and Holliday 1982, Jennings et al. 1986, Niemela¨ et al.
1993). Also, the ground beetle guild is an important
componentofthesoilmicro-fauna(Thiele1977,Lovei
and Sunderland 1996). We contend that changes in
assemblages should reßect changes occurring at the
soillevelafterdisturbanceatbothspatialandtemporal
scales. Despite documented limitations of estimating
ground beetle assemblages through conventional pit-
fall trapping (Spence and Niemela¨ 1994) this method
is still reliable for determining ground beetle activity
density as long as it is carried out under similar con-
ditions across environments (Dufre´ne and Legendre
1997).
The hypothesis we tested is that differences in stand
conditions indicated by criteria of tree-size, overstory
density,understorycoverandamountofwoodydebris
would be related to changes in ground beetle species
assemblages. The objectives of this study were to ex-
perimentally evaluate changes occurring in ground
beetle assemblages as related to changes occurring in
forest stands at several levels of disturbance, and to
determine speciÞc indicator species or assemblages
for each experimental forest.
Materials and Methods
This study was conducted in the ponderosa pine-
bunchgrass plant association on the Mogollon Plateau
within the Coconino National Forest at elevations
from 2,150 to 2,500 m (USDA Forest Service 1997).
The dominant overstory species is Pinus ponderosa
with a small component of gambel oak (Quercus gam-
belii Nutt.). The understory vegetation is character-
ized by Festuca arizonica (Vasey) and several other
graminoids and forbs as described in GrifÞs et al.
(2001).
The recent history of forest management and dis-
turbance along with fairly reliable management pre-
scription records allowed us to consider a spectrum of
disturbance gradients existing on the Coconino Na-
tionalForestforstandsthatwerelargeenoughtomeet
our size criteria. Any prospective stand must have had
a fairly homogeneous condition on 20Ð40 ha. Alloca-
tion of potential stands was done according to the
following criteria. Unmanaged stands: black-barked
ponderosa pine dominated stands having not received
a density altering treatment within the last 30 yr, such
that the stands have 90% crown closure and relative
density 70% (and thus are actively self-thinning).
The density of large, yellow-barked ponderosa pine
(64 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) in these
stands does not exceed 10 trees/ha. Thinned stands:
stands of mature, even-aged ponderosa pine that have
had 30% of their basal area removed between 1987
and 1993, at least 50% of which came from diameter
classes 30 cm (“pulpwood” size). The density of large,
yellow-barkedponderosapine(64cmdbh)doesnot
exceed 10 trees/ha. Thinned and broadcast burned
stands: similar to thinned stands, but also received a
broadcast burn treatment within 3Ð4 yr of thinning
(1988Ð1996). Overstory survival to date after the
broadcast burn is 90%. WildÞre stands: similar to
thinned and broadcast burned but with perhaps as
great as 20 trees/ha of large yellow-barked ponderosa
pine) in which 90% of the basal area was killed
and/or consumed by wildÞre since 1996.
Experimental Design. Hundreds of potential stands
were identiÞed in 1997 and 1998 for inclusion in the
study. Moderate slope and relatively similar elevation
were site factors considered for the initial selection of
stands. These criteria helped us to avoid possible bias
in selecting sites because management prescriptions
and burned stands were not uniformly scattered
across the Mogollon Plateau. From these stands, we
created a matrix of stand characteristics associated
with each. Next, we narrowed the selection parame-
ters to reÞne homogeneity within treatments to obtain
10 representative stands per treatment. From the 40
stands initially selected, 16 stands were randomly se-
lected to create a completely randomized experimen-
tal design with four treatments and four replicates.
Stand Structure Data. Stands in the Þnal selection
were further measured through 3Ð10, systematically
located 0.04-ha (20 by 20-m) square plots. Stand entry
point was selected based on ease of identiÞcation on
a map. Plot number one was located at a speciÞed
distance and direction from the entry point to have it
at least 50 m from the stand edge. All other plots were
located on a grid based on plot number 1, and sepa-
rated by 200 m and also at least 50 m from any stand
edge. Stands smaller than 33 ha were sampled with a
150-m grid. Standard forestry mensuration techniques
were used for diameter, height, and crown measure-
ments of overstory trees. Saplings, seedlings, dead
trees and snags were mapped and measured. Downed
woody debris was tallied by counting the number of
wood sticks on each speciÞed category that inter-
cepted a tape from north to south. Litter depth was
measured inserting a ruler every 1.5 m, up to 15 m
along east and west boundary of the plot.
Understory Vegetation Data. Two people searched
for plants in a plot for a total of 11 min. After each
survey period, individual species were given a subjec-
tive “evenness” category based on the abundance and
distribution of the species within the plot. All plants
were identiÞed to species. Unknown plant species
were identiÞed at the Deaver Herbarium, Northern
Arizona University. Each species was categorized as
“native or exotic” according to McDougall (1973).

VILLA-CASTILLO AND WAGNER: GROUND BEETLE ASSEMBLAGE AS INDICATOR

Details of methods and results of the understory veg-
etation component are reported in GrifÞs et al. (2001).
Ground Beetle Sampling. Ground beetle sampling
using pitfall traps was conducted during the summer
months of June, July and August of years 1998, 1999,
and 2000. A trap consisted of two plastic cups (11 cm
diameter by 8 cm deep) stacked and buried ßush to
ground level. The upper cup was used for servicing
while the bottom cup remained in place to reduce
local soil disturbance between collection dates. In the
1998 sampling period, traps were covered by a plastic
plate supported by three nails, leaving a space of 3
cm between cover and ground level. Traps were left
open for a period of 8Ð12 d and closed during non-
sampling periods. Samples were collected four times
in 1998. Traps damaged by wildlife were replaced as
soon as we discovered the damage. We modiÞed our
trapping scheme for 1999 and 2000. The bottom of the
servicing cup was removed and glued with a 3-mm
fabric mesh to diminish predation of small specimens.
Traps were left uncovered and camoußaged with
wood sticks for a period of 3 d for three sampling
periods during the growing season of 1999 and 2000.
Water with a few drops of detergent was used as a
collecting ßuid. Lemieux and Lindgren (1999) found
no differences in pitfall trap efÞciency when they
tested different substances as preservatives.
To minimize a potential edge effect, pitfall traps
were installed in the center of each stand in 1998 and
1999. Ten traps were located in a circular fashion 20
m apart. In 2000, pitfall trapping was carried out on a
transect composed of three permanent plots within
each stand. Distance between plots was either 150 or
200 m. Three traps were placed 5 m apart in a center-
row within each selected plot.
Ground beetle specimens were taken to the lab for
preservation and preparation of museum vouchers.
IdentiÞcation was based on LindrothÕs (1969) descrip-
tions. Specimens were determined by taxonomist Carl
Olson and Kip Will from the University of Arizona and
David Kavanaugh from the California Academy of
Sciences. Nomenclature used was following Bousquet
and Larochelle (1993).
Statistical Analyses. Analyses of variance were per-
formed for slope and elevation and for each of the
stand variables as well, to test the hypothesis of no
difference among treatments. Sequential Bonferroni
adjustment was applied to maintain the level of sig-
niÞcance (  0.05) on multiple one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) tests performed from the same
experimental unit (Rice 1989).
Before running any statistical analyses to test dif-
ferences on insect abundance, captures from individ-
ual traps were pooled per sampling date to have one
value of species per date per year representing the
coarse scale reported in this study. Also, since the
actual trapping window in 1998 was 10 d on average,
as compared with three trap-days in both 1999 and
2000, the number resulting from each pooled sampling
date in 1998 was divided by ten, the multiplied by
three to standardize the number of insect caught and
give a Þgure representing three days of trapping across
sampling years. Also, a rarefaction analysis was per-
formed using the procedure described by Krebs
(1989) to estimate the expected average number of
species from a less intensive sampled area.
Factorial ANOVA with no interaction was per-
formedforeachofthegroundbeetlespeciesthatwere
common to three years to test the null hypothesis of
no difference on mean abundance of insects among
years and treatments (SAS Institute 1996).
The Shannon-Weaver Diversity Index and the
Simpson Dominance Index were calculated for each
experimental stand with the program provided in
Brower et al. (1998). The Shannon-Weaver Index was
calculated with evenness included and the Simpson
Index was used to determine the strength of species
numerical abundance within each assemblage. We
took the mean and standard deviation values from the
four replicates within each treatment to summarize
ground beetle response to treatments according to
those indices. Relative abundance within treatments
was calculated for species that were common to the
three sampled years. The mean relative abundance of
four replicates per treatment per year was calculated,
and then we averaged the years to obtain one mean
value per treatment.
Multiple response permutation analyses (MRPP)
for each sampled year plus with data pooled for years
1999 and 2000 were performed. Before pooling the
1999 and 2000 data sets the relationship between these
two matrices was explored to determine similarity.
Because data from these two years came from the
same sampling units, the Mantel procedure was used
to test the null hypothesis of no relationship between
the two distance matrices (McCune and Mefford
1995).
This analysis was particularly relevant because even
though data matrices for 1999 and 2000 came from the
same sample units, the sampling scheme differed be-
tween years. We hypothesized that sampling plots in
a transect within the stand would identify different
assemblages than sampling a circle in the center of the
stand. The Mantel test was performed with the pro-
gram PC-ORD, using SorensenÕs distance measure.
This option was appropriate due to the heterogeneity
of numbers in the data sets. The Mantel test statistic
(r) was evaluated with the t-distribution with inÞnite
degrees of freedom (McCune and Mefford 1997).
The nonparametric MRPP analysis was used to per-
form statistical comparisons among groups having spe-
cies assemblage as the multiple response variable,
without requiring that the normality assumption had
been met (Zimmerman et al. 1985). This method was
appropriate in this study because there were a priori
groups arranged in an experimental fashion suitable
for multiple-response comparisons, but initial at-
tempts to do statistical tests through Multivariate
ANOVA failed the normality assumption. The MRPP
analysis was performed with the statistical software
PC-ORD (McCune and Mefford 1995). The squared
Euclidean distance option on the MRPP settings was
used, along with a grouping factor that accounts for
degrees of freedom, to perform a hypothesis test func-

tionally identical to a 2-sample t-test (Zimmerman et
al. 1985). This test was performed under the null
hypothesis of no difference in species assemblage
among treatments. The test statistic is:
T  - S,
where (delta)  weighted mean within-group dis-
tance,   mean under the null hypothesis, and S, 
standard deviation under the null hypothesis. The P
value associated with T is determined by numerical
integration of the Pearson type III distribution.
Individual tests for all pair-wise comparisons were
performed to detect signiÞcant effects on all possible
combinations. However, because six pair-wise tests
were simultaneously performed we applied the se-
quential Bonferroni adjustment to the obtained P val-
ues. We did this adjustment to maintain a “table-wide”
  0.10 and to increase the power of detecting er-
roneously rejected null hypotheses (Rice 1989).
Indicator species value analysis (referred to as “in-
dicator value” hereafter) by the Dufre´ne and Leg-
endre (1997) method was used to determine the spe-
ciÞc contribution of each species to the assemblages.
The Indicator Value was considered as a complement
of the MRPP analysis because the latter procedure
only detects differences among treatments based on
entire assemblages without knowing the speciÞc con-
tribution of individual species to such assemblages.
Data from pooled traps and dates were used as in the
MRPP analysis to determine the Indicator Value of
species per stand per year. The indicator value is
expressed as a percentage of perfect indication and it
is integrated by combining values of speciÞc speciesÕ
relative abundance and relative frequency. Indicator
Species Value analyses were performed with the sta-
tistical software PC-ORD (McCune and Mefford
1997). The grouping factor was the speciÞc experi-
mental treatment with four replicates each. The sta-
tistical signiÞcance of the maximum Indicator Value
calculated was tested by a Monte Carlo method. The
null hypothesis was that the maximum Indicator Value
is not larger than would be expected by chance ( 
0.05).
Results
The ANOVA performed for slope and elevation
showed that treatments were not signiÞcantly differ-
ent. These results suggest that initial stand selection
was not systematically biased toward any treatment
andchangesingroundbeetlecommunityareprobably
due toy differences on treatments. The ANOVA per-
formed for each out of 12 stand variables showed that
treatments were signiÞcantly different when charac-
terized by overstory tree data such as stand relative
index, diameter at breast height, and basal area. Treat-
ments were also signiÞcantly different when charac-
terized by native and exotic forbs and native grami-
noids. Treatments were not signiÞcantly different on
seedlings, exotic graminoids, litter depth and woody
debris (Table 1).
A total of 4,451 individuals was caught during the
three sampled years, representing 15 genera and 20
species. However, 2,595 was the total number of spec-
imens for the three sampled years used in further
analyses of variance because of the correction applied
to 1998 captures to standardize it to three trapping
days (Table 2).
The results of ANOVA to evaluate differences on
species across years and treatments indicate that
abundance of Cyclotrachelus constrictus (Say), Ago-
num placidum (Say), Amara spp., Rhadine spp., Snyu-
chus dubius (LeConte), and Hapalus spp. was not
signiÞcantly different among sampling years and sig-
niÞcantly different among treatments. The species
Amara quensli (Scho¨nerr) was signiÞcantly different
among years and treatments, whereas Carabus taeda-

tus agassii (Le Conte) was not signiÞcantly different
among years and treatments (Table 3).
The results of the rarefaction analysis indicated that
with a subsample of 3 d representing 216 sampling
hours as compared with the 960 h sampled in 1998, we
should expect to have an average of 9  1.41 species.
The actual collection numbers from the less intensive
sampling surpassed the expected because 16 species
were collected in 1999 and 15 species in 2000 (Table
2). Therefore, we considered that three trap-days in
each of the June, July and August summer months was
adequate to sample ground beetle assemblages.
The lowest species richness was recorded in un-
managed and thinned stands. Species richness was
higher on thinned and burned and wildÞre burned
stands (Table 4). Individual abundance was generally
high on both unmanaged and thinned stands. How-
ever, the higher abundance on unmanaged and
thinned treatments was accounted for by the species
Synuchus dubius that was overwhelmingly dominant
on these stands (Fig. 1) The tremendous dominance
of this species is expressed by the low Shannon Di-
versity value along with the high Simpson dominance
index,ascomparedwiththinnedandburnedandwild-
Þre burned values (Table 4). Although S. dubius was
relatively abundant in thinned and burned treatment
(Fig. 2A), the presence of other species resulted in
higher Shannon diversity and lower Simpson domi-
nanceindices.WildÞreburnedstandsresultedinsome
of the highest Shannon diversity values. In this treat-
ment, the mean highest relative abundance was at-
tained by species in the genus Harpalus rather than S.
dubius as observed in the other three treatments (Fig.
2B).
Results from the Mantel test indicated that distance
matrices for 1999 and 2000 had a positive relationship
(r0.355,t3.82,P	0.001).Consequently,wewere
able to analyze ground beetle assemblages for 1998,
1999, and 2000 individually, as well as the combined
data set for years 1999 and 2000.
We posed the null hypothesis that ground beetle
assemblages sampled from different experimental
stands would be similar. A hypothesis test summary is
shown in Table 5.
Assemblages of wildÞre burned stands were con-
sistently different from unmanaged and thinned as-
semblages.Assemblagesfromunmanagedandthinned
stands were in general not different, except for 2000.
However, a lack of signiÞcance for the pooled 1999Ð
2000 data suggests that both types of stands tend to
have similar assemblages. Assemblages from unman-
aged and thinned and burned treatments were not
different in any of the three sampled years, though the
rejection cutoff was only marginal in 1999. However,
differences were evident for the 1999Ð2000 pooled
years. Statistical differences in this comparison were
due to an increased within-group agreement (R 
0.45) that improved the lower R existing for 2000. A
similar effect was found when we compared thinned
and thinned and burned. Low R in 1999 yielded no
statistical difference between groups. However, the
higher R in 2000 contributed to improve the low R in
1999, yielding signiÞcant differences for 1999Ð2000
pooled. Interestingly, when we compared thinned and
burned and wildÞre burned treatments, differences in
1999 were marginally not signiÞcant as compared with
other years. The lack of signiÞcance was further over-
come, when we analyzed 1999Ð2000 pooled years.
Pooled years again increased the within group (R)
agreement, contributing to signiÞcantly different re-
sults.
Results from MRPP revealed a within-stand distri-
bution pattern of ground beetle assemblage fairly con-
sistent across sampled years. This pattern is also con-
Table 2.

sistent for most species when analyzed individually
(Table 3), however, the thinned plus broadcast
burned stands tended to be more sensitive to sampling
intensity than the other three treatments, as year-to-
year changes in within group agreement were more
pronounced when using a bigger (pooled) sample.
These changes reßected the necessity of Þner scale
sampling to detect factors associated with ground bee-
tle assemblages particularly in prescribed burned
stands.
Results of the Monte Carlo test of signiÞcance for
maximum Indicator Value are summarized in Table 6.
Species that had a statistically signiÞcant indicator
value in both 1998 and 1999 were Amara farcta, Amara
quensli, Amara spp, Harpalus spp, S. dubius, and Seri-
coda bembidioides (Kirby). In 2000, the indicator
value analysis showed that A. farcta, Amara spp. and S.
bembidioides were no longer indicator species. S. du-
bius, Amara quensli and Harpalus spp. were signiÞcant

indicator species as in the two previous years. In con-
trast, Cyclotrachelus constrictus, Rhadine spp. and Ago-
num placidum are species that were present on our
samples since 1998 but they were not signiÞcant in-
dicator species until the 2000 sampling year. Also,
Bembidion rupicola (Kirby) was present in our sam-
ples since 1999 but it was a signiÞcant indicator species
only in 2000.
The percentage of perfect indication of indicator
species across treatments is shown in Table 7. The
unmanaged treatment was entirely indicated by the
species S. dubius since other species present on this
treatment resulted in zero indicator value. Thinned
stands were also indicated by the species S. dubius,
although C. constrictus had a low percent of indication
in 1998 and 1999. Thinned and burned stands were
mainly indicated by C. constrictus followed by Cym-
indis arizonensis (Schaffer), Rhadine spp., S. dubius
and marginally by two Amara species. The wildÞre
burned treatment was consistently indicated by Har-
palus spp. and A. quensli. WildÞre indicator species in
two sampling years included A. farcta, A. placidum and
S. bembidioides. Rhadine spp. and B. rupicola indicated
wildÞre burned in one sampling year.

Carabus taedatus agassii, although present in all
sampling years, was not a signiÞcant indicator species
in any speciÞc year. Furthermore, this species resulted
in an indicator value highly similar when compared
withindicatorvaluesgeneratedbyrandomizedgroups
in the Monte Carlo test (Table 6).
Discussion
This study was initiated with the hypothesis that
northern Arizona ponderosa pine stands that have
received different levels of disturbance would have
different ground beetle species assemblages. Our re-
sults indicate that differences found in most common
ground beetle species were attributed to treatment.
Although no difference was detected in most common
species among sampling years (Table 3), there was no
consistency when we use Shannon Diversity Index
(Table 4). The aggregation of one species with low
abundance changed substantially diversity estimates.
Therefore, we used a nonparametric method to eval-
uate differences on species assemblages attributed to
treatments. The coarse-scale sampling deployed on
the studied stands rendered ground beetle assem-
blages representative of each experimental treatment
that were respectively characterized by tree size,
overstory stand density and understory plant cover
parameters (Table 2).
Unmanaged stands that are characterized as having
higher stand relative index, higher basal area, low
mean tree diameter (Table 2) had low ground beetle
species richness and diversity (Table 4). The ground
beetle assemblage of unmanaged stands was strongly
dominated by S. dubius (Fig. 1A). Thinned stands that
were on average less dense and had trees with higher
mean diameter had ground beetle assemblages similar
to those of unmanaged stands (Fig. 1B) with the same
indicator species (Table 7).
GrifÞs et al. (2001) reported very little difference in
understory plant diversity and abundance between
unmanaged stands and the stands that were thinned
only. Niemela¨ et al. (1993) found that clear-cutting
initially reduced the abundance of the forest gener-
alist species Calathus ingratus (Dejean) and Pterosti-
chus hematophus (Dejean). A recovery in abundance
of these generalist species was attributed to favorable
environmental conditions of the regenerating site
when the canopy closed after 17 yr. Beaudry et al.
(1997) found the generalist species Synuchus impunc-
tatus (Say) was initially affected by clear-cutting but
quickly recovered from disturbance. In our study, al-
though we did not record changes in ground beetle
assemblages immediately after disturbance occurred,
the similarity in S. dubius abundance between unman-
aged and thinned stands suggested that any initial
detrimental effect from logging was masked by the
time we initiated our study (4Ð10 yr since distur-
bance). Our results also suggest that S. dubius may be
functioning as a forest generalist species in northern
Arizona ponderosa pine because both overstory and
understory species abundance clearly reßect the con-
ditions this species prefers.
In contrast, stands that were thinned to a similar
intensity, but with a prescribed burn applied 3Ð4 yr
after thinning had a signiÞcantly different ground bee-
tle assemblage (Table 7). In general, higher abun-
dance of understory plants in broadcast burned stands
as reported by GrifÞs et al. (2001) seems to be asso-
ciated with a more diverse ground beetle assemblage.
The broadcast burn applied to previously thinned
stands apparently provided habitat for other species,
including Cyclotrachelus ( Evarthrus Leconte) con-
strictus that was the only species consistently found on
thinned plus prescribed burned stands and not found
in either unmanaged or in wildÞre burned stands (Ta-
ble 7). Considering a natural Þre frequency of 2Ð10 yr
in southwest ponderosa pine (Weaver 1951, Coving-
ton and Moore 1994), we believe C. constrictus rep-
resents the type of ground beetle species that may
have evolved under the inßuence of the low intensity
Þre regime estimated for northern Arizona ponderosa
pine forests. The group Evarthrus (which is often
treated as a genus), although widely present in the
United States, has been poorly studied (Lindroth
1969). Harris and Withcomb (1974) reported four
species of Evarthrus commonly occurring in mixed
Table 7.

VILLA-CASTILLO AND WAGNER: GROUND BEETLE ASSEMBLAGE AS INDICATOR
249

conifer and hardwood forests in Florida. These au-
thors reported that three species of Evarthrus were
abundant on forest sites that were excluded from Þre
for 10 yr, whereas the same species were not collected
from sites annually burned. Greenberg and Thomas
(1995) found four Cyclotrachelus species in stands of
the sand pine (Pinus clausa Vasey ex Sarg.) scrub
ecosystem of Florida that were subjected to different
disturbance events including prescribed Þre 5Ð7 yr
before ground beetle sampling. Although these two
reports are not conclusive regarding patterns of Cy-
clotrachelus (Evarthrus) response to either Þre or log-
ging, these results support our Þndings in northern
Arizona. Thus, we consider C. constrictus as a forest
specialist species consistently responding to changes
in forest ecosystems due to low-intensity Þre as mim-
icked by prescribed burning.
The greatest change to ground beetle species as-
semblages found in our study was due to catastrophic
Þre. WildÞre burned stands, that before the Þre event
had similar tree-size and density conditions to the
other stands we sampled, not only had the highest
ground beetle species richness (Table 3), but species
assemblages (Fig. 2B) and indicator species (Table 7)
that were substantially different from the other three
stand conditions. Changes in ground beetle assem-
blages associated with forest Þre have been previously
documented, however, reports that estimate experi-
mentally the effect of disturbances are scarce. Friend
(1994) indicated that only Carabidae showed a con-
sistent response to Þre as compared with other Co-
leoptera families when relatively large stands (20 ha)
were burned under low to moderate Þre intensity.
This author found lower ground beetle abundance in
the short term after Þre, but in the long-term seasonal
factors compensated for any Þre-related effect. Hol-
liday (1984, 1991, 1992) found that ground beetle
diversity increased with time since Þre.
Estimation of Þre- or logging-related effects on
ground beetle community structure through conven-
tional diversity indices may be misinterpreted if sites
with different productivity levels are compared (Du-
fre´ne and Legendre 1997) or the ecological function
of species is not considered (Hurlbert 1971, Spence
and Niemela¨ 1994). Our study was initiated 2 yr after
the wildÞre stands were burned. Considering ground
beetle species richness alone, our results suggest that
this disturbance level enhanced ground beetle diver-
sityinarelativelyshorttime.However,groundbeetles
in the genus Amara and speciÞcally the species A.
farcta and A. quensli that are of high indicator value for
wildÞre stands are species commonly reported as in-
habitants of dry-open areas (Lindroth 1969). Also, the
genus Harpalus has previously been recognized as a
characteristic inhabitant of dry open-areas (Lindroth
1969, Thiele 1977, Niemela¨ et al. 1993, Beaudry et al.
1997). Consequently, the ground beetle species as-
semblage that serves as an indicator of wildÞre burned
stands corresponds to a community structure repre-
sentative of open-dry areas. Interestingly, this indica-
tor assemblage consistently reßected the vegetation
cover that still dominates the landscape 2Ð4 yr after
wildÞrewithnoindicationofforestregenerationsofar
(Table 1). GrifÞs et al. (2001) found the highest un-
derstory plant diversity in wildÞre stands.
Changes in ground beetle assemblages due to cat-
astrophic Þre may help us to understand changes in
ground beetle assemblages in cases where prescribed
Þre is used as a management tool. For instance, S.
bembidioides which is a species previously docu-
mented as strongly attracted by Þre (Dajoz 1998), was
totally absent on thinned plus burned stands, whereas
in wildÞre burned stands it was present with very low
abundance (Fig. 2). Because the prescribed burning
on our stands could have been applied up to 7 yr
before our Þrst ground beetle sampling, it is possible
that some other Þre adapted species had already dis-
appearedfromthestandduetolackofsuitablehabitat.
Dajoz(1998)reportedthatgroundbeetleassemblages
from burned sites in Yosemite National Park were
strongly dominated by S. bembidioides and Sericoda
bogemanni (Gyllenhall) 1 yr after Þre. Three years
after Þre the same Þre-adapted species were seldom
recorded. Other species that we caught exclusively
from wildÞre stands are A. placidum and B. rupicola.
Both species have previously been associated with
forest Þre events.
The pattern we found for the species C. taedatus
aggassi was unique. This species did not result in sig-
niÞcant indicator value throughout our study because
it occurred in all treatments. However, it was present
in relatively low abundance in both unmanaged and
thinnedtreatments,ascomparedwiththeoverwhelm-
ing dominance of S. dubius (Fig 1). It is probable that
strong predacious habits, as previously reported for
some Carabus species, contributed to determine site
preference due to prey availability (Loreau 1988).
Ingham and Samways (1996) reported that arthropod
predators seem to select habitat based on food avail-
ability rather than on speciÞc site conditions.
The apparent pattern found from low to high spe-
cies diversity as the level of disturbance increases may
be explained under the disturbance and perturbation
hypothesis. There is evidence indicating that distur-
bance is an important factor in enhancing diversity of
species on a given site because disturbance generates
new resources for colonists and prevents competi-
tively dominant species from monopolizing resources
(references in Price 1997). Consequently, there ap-
pears to be a number of species in the ground beetle
community structure that are adapted to changes gen-
erated by disturbance in northern Arizona ponderosa
pine forests. The Þre regime in this forest type has
been documented to occur on a rather regular basis.
There may be suitable conditions for open-area spe-
cies to temporarily colonize open patches including
pyrophilous species. In the meantime, stand condi-
tions and ground beetle assemblages should return to
previous undisturbed conditions until the next Þre
event triggers another wave of changes in what should
be a mosaic of forest conditions in the southwestern
ponderosa pine forest ecosystem. Under current con-
ditions, we assume there are refugia where recoloniz-
ing beetles reside. However, the ability of some or-

ganisms to recolonize a disturbed site is strongly
affected by size of managed stands, distance between
refugia and disturbed sites and amount of coarse
woody debris (Niemela¨ 1999). More research is
needed to decipher the range of conditions required
for ground beetle species moving among spatial and
temporal forest patches.
