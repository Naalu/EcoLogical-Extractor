Although hazardous fuels reduction projects are being implemented widely in dry forests of the wes-
tern United States, information concerning ecological responses of pinyon-juniper woodlands to fuels
treatments is minimal. In this study we used a randomized block experimental design to investigate
effects of fuels treatments on understory responses at a pinyon-juniper woodland site in northern
Arizona. Treatment alternatives replicated (n = 12) on 1-ha units across the 760-ha site were thinning
from below (Thin), prescribed burning, (Burn), thinning followed by prescribed burning (Thin + Burn),
and untreated controls (Control). We measured cover of vascular plant species, biological soil crust,
and forest ﬂoor substrate prior to treatment and one year, 2 years, and ﬁve years post-treatment. After
ﬁve years, Thin and Thin + Burn plots showed statistically similar total plant cover but both showed
signiﬁcantly greater cover than Burn and Control plots. Cover increases on Thin + Burn plots were dri-
ven mainly by annual forb and nonnative species groups. Graminoid species with the C4 photosynthetic
pathway showed signiﬁcantly greater cover in all treatment groups compared with Control plots.
Burning alone tended to reduce shrub cover whereas thinning alone tended to increase shrub cover.
We found no signiﬁcant effects of treatment on cover of biological soil crust or bare soil. Regression
analysis showed signiﬁcant negative relationships between total understory plant cover and overstory
canopy cover on burned and unburned plots. We found no signiﬁcant effect of treatment on species
richness over the measurement period. We observed 124 taxa in total, and mean richness ranged from
31.8 to 36.8 species per 500 m2 in 2011. Similar to results for plant cover, we found signiﬁcantly
greater numbers of annual forb species in Thin + Burn compared with Control plots and signiﬁcantly
greater numbers of nonnative species in Thin + Burn compared with all other treatment groups. Permu-
tational multivariate analysis of variance showed no signiﬁcant differences in overall plant community
composition among treatments. These results indicate that fuel reduction treatments on woodland sites
may not dramatically affect understory abundance or composition within ﬁve years. Although treat-
ments did not signiﬁcantly differ in cover of biological soil crust or bare soil – indicators of ecosystem
function – our results showed that thinning treatments followed by prescribed ﬁre led to increases in
cover of nonnative plant species.

1. Introduction
Hazardous fuels reduction projects with the primary goal of
reducing
potential
for
uncontrollable
wildﬁre
are
being
implemented widely in dry forests of the western United States
(Schoennagel
et
al.,
2009;
Schoennagel
and
Nelson,
2011).
Although information concerning ecological responses to fuels
reduction
treatments
is
becoming
increasingly
available
for
frequent-ﬁre forest types, such as ponderosas pine and dry
mixed-conifer (Schwilk et al., 2009), data are lacking from other
major ecosystems, such as pinyon-juniper woodlands, that are
being treated but may have infrequent natural ﬁre regimes (Scho-
ennagel and Nelson, 2011). Anthropogenic disruption of historical
natural ﬁre regimes in frequent-ﬁre forest types has led to in-
creases in tree density, canopy fuel loading, ladder fuels, and woo-
dy surface fuels (Covington et al., 1994; Agee and Skinner, 2005).
Typical fuels treatments are designed to manage these aspects of
the fuel complex. Hazardous fuels reduction is achieved by
decreasing densities of smaller trees and tree crown density, often
through mechanical thinning, and reducing woody surface fuels
through broadcast burning, piling and burning, or mastication
(Agee and Skinner, 2005). In addition to reducing uncharacteristic
crown ﬁre, such treatments can affect numerous other ecological
processes and functions (Kimmins, 1987; Whelan, 1995). For

example, opening forest canopies and implementing low-intensity
burning can modify microclimate and increase availability of vari-
ous resources utilized by understory plants. These effects can in
turn result in increased cover and species richness of understory
communities (Laughlin et al., 2006; Moore et al., 2006; Schwilk
et al., 2009). Where fuels reduction approaches diminish occur-
rence of uncharacteristic ﬁre behavior, reestablish stand structural
patterns, and promote establishment and growth of native plants,
application of such treatments may be consistent with ecological
restoration and conservation goals (Brown et al., 2004). However,
much more uncertainty exists with respect to implementation of
fuels treatments in infrequent-ﬁre types where historical land uses
may not have meaningfully altered disturbance regimes or affected
stand structural conditions (Romme et al., 2003; Brown et al.,
2004; Schoennagel et al., 2004).
Pinyon-juniper ecosystems occur on approximately 22.5 million
hectares and are common across the semiarid western US
(Springﬁeld, 1976; Powell et al., 1994). Although these systems
are highly variable in terms of species composition, structure,
and natural disturbance processes, some generalizations may be
made that are relevant to ﬁre management, conservation, and eco-
logical restoration. For example, Romme et al., (2009) described
natural structural conditions ranging from open savannas, with
scattered trees occurring in a matrix of mainly grasses and herba-
ceous vegetation, to persistent woodlands dominated by trees.
These structural conditions may be found across the geographic
distribution of the pinyon-juniper type, although structure and
natural disturbance processes are coupled with local site charac-
teristics such as soils and climate. It is widely understood that
pinyon and juniper trees have increased in density on savannas
and wooded shrublands as well as expanded into grasslands and
shrublands since the late 19th century, probably as a result of cli-
mate and anthropogenic changes in natural disturbance regimes
(Miller et al., 2008). On these sites, goals related to hazardous fuels
reduction, conservation of natural patterns, and ecological restora-
tion may be in agreement. In contrast, persistent pinyon-juniper
woodlands are thought to be infrequent ﬁre systems that may have
experienced fewer structural changes as a result of historical land
use (Romme et al., 2003; Baker and Shinneman, 2004; Floyd et al.,
2004; Huffman et al., 2008a). Persistent woodlands occur where
local site conditions and climate limit production of ﬁne fuels
and favor tree growth (Romme et al., 2009). Undisturbed woodland
stands may be relatively dense and exhibit all-aged tree size struc-
ture with sparse understories (Floyd et al., 2003; Huffman et al.,
2012). Surface fuels are typically discontinuous and ﬁre events
may result in torching of individual trees and small groups or,
under more extreme conditions, become wind-driven crown
ﬁres that result in high severity patches covering larger spatial ex-
tents (Floyd et al., 2004, 2008; Huffman et al., 2008a). Because
infrequent, high-severity ﬁres may be within the natural range of
variability for persistent pinyon-juniper woodlands, resource man-
agers may be faced with difﬁcult decisions that require weighing
tradeoffs between conservation of ecological integrity and wildﬁre
mitigation. This is particularly common in wildland-urban inter-
face areas where conservation of natural patterns of forest struc-
ture may run at odds with protection of human communities and
cultural resources (Dombeck et al. 2004). For example, Huffman
et al. (2009) showed that thinning from below followed by broad-
cast burning in Pinus edulis – Juniperus osteosperma woodlands in
Arizona effectively reduced stand density and crown fuel load
compared with burning alone and untreated control plots. How-
ever, thinning from below resulted in alteration of tree diameter
distributions, which likely represented novel structural conditions
outside
the
natural
range
of
variability
for
this
ecosystem
(Huffman et al., 2009). In addition to attributes of overstory
structure, other indicators of ecological integrity and function in
semiarid and arid systems include dynamics of invasive species,
biological soil crusts, and bare soil (Whitford et al., 1998; Pyke
et al., 2002; Bowker et al., 2008).
Until recently, research concerning ecological responses of pin-
yon-juniper systems to overstory manipulation has been focused
on intensive treatments such as fuelwood cutting, complete tree
removal for range improvement, and grassland restoration. Studies
conducted in woodlands of the southwestern US generally indicate
an
increase
in
herbage
production
following
tree
removal;
however, soils and climatic conditions may limit the response
(O’Rourke and Ogden, 1969; Clary, 1971; Clary and Jameson,
1981; Loftin, 1999). Similarly, more recent studies have reported
substantial increases in understory grass cover after heavy thin-
ning applied to restore pinyon-juniper savanna conditions (Jacobs
and Gatewood, 1999; Brockway et al., 2002). In these systems such
treatments seem particularly effective at encouraging understory
production if slash and woody debris is lopped and scattered
across soil surfaces (Hastings et al., 2003; Stoddard et al., 2008).
Owen et al. (2009) observed higher plant cover and species rich-
ness on plots where thinning slash was masticated compared with
plots where slash was piled and burned. Similarly Ross et al. (2012)
reported higher plant cover on plots where young trees were
thinned and slash was either masticated or piled and burned
compared with untreated control plots. Few studies have exam-
ined responses to less intensive approaches, such as hazardous
fuels reduction, that are designed to leave a greater amount of
stand structure intact in persistent pinyon-juniper woodlands.
In this study, we report understory plant community responses
ﬁve years after implementation of a completely randomized and
replicated fuels reduction experiment at a P. edulis – J. osteosperma
site in Arizona. Treatment alternatives implemented were thinning
from below, thinning followed by prescribed burning, burning
alone, and untreated controls. Thinning slash was lopped and scat-
ted under all thinning alternatives. Our main research questions in
this study were the following: (1) Do understory cover and species
richness differ between fuels reduction approaches? (2) Do treat-
ments affect establishment and spread of invasive nonnative
plants? (3) Do treatments affect understory community composi-
tion? In addition to these questions, we evaluated differences in
cover of biological soil crusts and bare soil as indicators of ecosys-
tem integrity and function. Answers to these questions provide
information to help woodland managers in weighing tradeoffs be-
tween commonly applied hazardous fuels reduction prescriptions.
2. Methods
2.1. Study site
We conducted the experiment on a 760-ha site (latitude
360102400
to 355904300, longitude 1121105500
to 1120703800)
located on the Tusayan Ranger District of the Kaibab National For-
est in northern Arizona (Fig. 1). The northern boundary of the site
divides US Forest Service land from Grand Canyon National Park.
The town of Tusayan Arizona is approximately 3.5 km to the south-
east, and there are several private properties near the site. In 2004,
the Tusayan Ranger District issued a Proposed Action statement
describing the Topeka Wildland-Urban Interface Fuels Reduction
Project (‘‘Topeka Project’’) that was to be implemented at the study
site. The purpose of the project was to reduce ﬁre risk in the wild-
land-urban interface zone, which was deﬁned as ‘‘any area on the
forest that is within one-half to one mile of private property, or any
other area that could carry a wildﬁre into a position where it
threatens private property of high value areas such as Grand
Canyon National Park’’. The actions proposed, mainly thinning of
small trees and application of prescribed ﬁre, were intended to

reduce existing forest fuels and open up the forest canopy. More
speciﬁcally, objectives of the project included the following: (1)
improve forest health; (2) break up fuel continuity, reduce ladder
fuels, and decrease other live and dead fuels in the project area
to reduce the threat of wildﬁre to the forest, the Tusayan commu-
nity, and Grand Canyon National Park; (3) improve wildlife habitat
diversity and forage conditions; (4) reintroduce ﬁre as a process for
improving and maintaining ecosystem health; and (5) prevent
introduction of new noxious weeds and the expansion of existing
noxious weed populations. In 2004, prior to implementation of
the Topeka Project, we installed an experiment to evaluate ecolog-
ical responses to the proposed fuels treatments (Huffman et al.,
2009).
The elevation at the site is approximately 2034 m and topogra-
phy is relatively ﬂat on upland microsites with slopes averaging
about 7%. Mean annual precipitation (1976–2012) of the area is
408 mm and falls bi-modally with peaks in winter and late sum-
mer (WRCC 2012). Over the study period (2004–2011), annual
precipitation averaged 321 mm, 79% of the long-term average.
Average minimum and maximum temperatures are 0.2 C and
17.5 C, respectively. Soils at the site are classiﬁed as typic Hap-
lustalfs of gravelly loam texture, derived from Kaibab limestone
parent material (USDA 1991). The biotic community is classiﬁed
as Great Basin pinyon-juniper woodland (Brown 1994). The
overstory was dominated by pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) and Utah
juniper (Juniperus osteosperma). A previous ﬁre history reconstruc-
tion at the site suggested that conditions correspond to the persis-
tent woodland type described by Romme et al. (2009) with little
evidence of either surface ﬁre or extensive stand-replacing ﬁre
having occurred for several centuries (Huffman et al., 2008). Pon-
derosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) trees were present on low-lying
microsites and shrub-form Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) was
scattered throughout the site but both species were only a minor
component on sample plots in our study. Livestock have not been
present on the site since 1996 (Huffman et al. 2008a).
2.2. Experimental design
In order to evaluate understory responses to alternative fuels
reduction approaches, we established a completely randomized
block experiment. Six experimental blocks were identiﬁed based
on location within the site, slope position, and woodland stand
delineations done by US Forest Service staff (Fig. 1). Within each
block, eight experimental treatment units were randomly se-
lected from a systematic grid (200  200 m) of points generated
in a geographic information system (N = 48 units). Treatment
units were one-hectare (100  100 m) in size, and one 0.04-ha
circular sample plot was established at the approximate center
of each treatment unit. Treatment units were randomly assigned
one of four possible treatments: (1) no treatment (Control); (2)
tree thinning from below (Thin); (3) prescribed ﬁre only (Burn);
and
(4)
thinning
followed
by
prescribed
ﬁre
(Thin + Burn).
Experimental treatments were formulated to examine responses
both to the separate fuels treatment components of thinning
and prescribed ﬁre as well as the combined activities proposed
for the Topeka Project. The full area of each 1-ha unit was
treated according to its random assignment. The resulting exper-
imental design yielded two replicates per treatment, per block
(n = 12).
Thinning prescriptions implemented on the experimental units
were formulated to emulate those of the Topeka Project. Within
the thinned treatment units, pinyon pine trees 625.4 cm diameter
at root collar (drc), junipers 630 cm drc, and ponderosa pine trees
622.9 cm at breast height (1.37 m above soil surface) were cut. All
Gambel oak stems as well as tree seedlings (individuals <1.37 m
height) and shrubs were retained. Topeka Project guidelines

also required some smaller trees to be retained for spacing
requirements; however, we did not include a tree spacing aspect
in our experimental prescriptions. Boles and crowns of thinned
trees were lopped and loosely scattered. Thinning was completed
in 2005. Prescribed burning of the burned treatment units was
completed using hand ignition with drip torches in September,
2006. Relative humidity, daytime temperatures, and wind speeds
during the burn were 20–60%, 10–30 C, and <16 km h1, respec-
tively. Surface fuels were discontinuous, and thus ﬁre did not
readily spread along the forest ﬂoor. Mean pretreatment and post-
treatment surface fuel loadings are reported by Huffman et al.
(2009). Hand crews targeted fuel ‘‘jackpots’’ (logs, slash accumula-
tions, and patches of deeper forest ﬂoor) for ignition. Mean tree
densities in Thin, Burn, and Thin + Burn were reduced from 820,
910, and 1008 trees ha1, respectively at pretreatment, to 198,
693, and 204 trees ha1, respectively, post-treatment (Huffman
et al., 2009). Neither the study area nor the treatment units were
seeded.
2.3. Field measurements
We sampled cover of understory vegetation in May–June in
2004 (pretreatment), 2007 (one year post-treatment), and 2008
(two years post-treatment), and 2011 (ﬁve years post-treatment).
At each of the plots within treatment units, we established one
permanent 50-m transect. Transects were aligned perpendicular
to the general slope of each plot and end points were marked with
pieces of steel rebar driven into the soil. Along each transect, we
sampled understory species richness in a 500-m2 (10  50 m belt
transect. Complete species lists of all vascular plants and trees
<1.37 m in height were collected. Cover of vascular plants, sub-
strate, biological soil crust, and overstory canopy was measured
in ten 1-m2 (0.5  2 m) quadrats systematically located at 5-m
intervals. Foliar cover by species (%) and substrate cover (%) were
visually estimated and recorded for each quadrat. Substrate was
categorized as coarse wood (pieces >7.6 cm in diameter), plant lit-
ter, mineral soil, rock (>2.54 cm diameter), or scat. Quadrat cover of
tree boles and stumps was also recorded. Cover of biological soil
crust was measured using 625-cm2 frames systematically located
within the larger sample quadrats. Each frame was subdivided into
25 cells and crust presence was recorded at each cell intersection
(16 points). Overstory tree cover was measured using a spherical
densitometer held level at 40 cm above the soil surface in the cen-
ter of each quadrat. Plant nomenclature was veriﬁed using the
Tropicos (2012). Nativity of species was determined using the
USDA Plants Database (USDA 2009).
2.4. Data analysis
Plant, substrate, biological soil crust, and overstory canopy cov-
er values from quadrats were averaged for each plot. Species rich-
ness at each plot was simply the number of unique species found
within belt transects. Pretreatment (2004) effects of treatment
group on total plant cover and species richness were tested using
blocked one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). No signiﬁcant pre-
treatment effects were found (see Results). Post-treatment effects
on total understory plant cover were analyzed using blocked re-
peated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Total cover was
transformed (square-root) in order to meet ANOVA assumptions
for normality and equal variance. As signiﬁcant treatment  time
interactions were found, we tested for treatment effects within
each year. Tukey’s honestly signiﬁcant difference (HSD) post-hoc
multiple comparisons test was used to test for differences among
treatment groups. In addition, we tested post-treatment (2011)
treatment effects on total native, total nonnative cover and
richness, and functional group (e.g., forb, cactus, graminoid, shrub,
etc.) cover and richness using one-way ANOVA. When signiﬁcant
treatment effects were found, we used Tukey’s multiple compari-
son tests to compare individual treatment means. For data that
did not meet ANOVA assumptions of equal variance and normal
distribution, Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric tests were used to
examine treatment effects. When results were signiﬁcant, Mann–
Whitney tests were used to make pairwise treatment comparisons.
All tests were conducted at a = 0.05 using SAS JMP (ver. 9) software
(SAS Inc., 2004).
Relationships between plant variables and overstory canopy
cover and forest ﬂoor characteristics were tested using Pearson
correlation analyses for normally distributed data and Spearman
rho for non-normally distributed data. Relationships between
plant community cover and overstory canopy cover were further
investigated using simple linear regression. Plant cover data were
transformed using the natural log to stabilize variance as indicated
by examination of residual plots.
Pretreatment and ﬁnal (2011) community composition were
analyzed using permutational MANOVA (PERMANOVA; Anderson,
2001), with Bray-Curtis dissimilarity distance measure (Faith
et al., 1987). P-values were calculated by permuting observations
9999 times. The test for a time  treatment interaction was as-
sessed by calculating the multivariate dissimilarity (Bray-Curtis
distance) between 2004 and 2011 for each treatment unit. This
calculation produced a univariate response variable that we
analyzed using a Kruskal–Wallis test and post-hoc Wilcoxon
2-sample tests for pairwise comparisons. PERMANOVA analyses
were conducted using PC-ORD (Ver. 5.10) software (McCune and
Mefford, 2006).
3. Results
3.1. Plant cover
We found no signiﬁcant differences among treatment groups in
pretreatment total understory plant cover (Fig. 2). Pretreatment
cover ranged from 3.0% to 4.1% across groups.

Post-treatment, repeated measures analysis showed signiﬁcant
(P < 0.05) effects of treatment, time, and treatment x time interac-
tions for total plant cover (Fig. 2). Post-hoc comparisons of group
means within years showed signiﬁcantly higher cover in the Thin
treatment than in the untreated Control plots in 2007 (one year
after treatment implementation). Thin + Burn and Burn treatments
were statistically similar to one another as well as Thin and un-
treated Control plots in 2007 (Fig. 2). Two years post-treatment
(2008), plant cover was statistically similar (P > 0.05) in all
treatment groups. Five years post-treatment (2011), Thin and
Thin + Burn plots showed statistically similar total plant cover,
both of which were signiﬁcantly higher than Burn and untreated
Control plots (Fig. 2). Compared with pretreatment conditions, to-
tal cover had increased by 34% and 78% on Thin and Thin + Burn
plots, respectively, by 2011 whereas Control and Burn plots had
decreased 5% and 9%, respectively. Biological soil crust cover and
bare
soil
cover
were
statistically
similar
(P > 0.05)
across
treatments both before as well as after treatment (Fig. 3).
Cover by plant functional group in 2011 showed similar
patterns to total plant cover (Table 1). For example, cover of native
plants was signiﬁcantly higher (P < 0.05) in Thin than Burn plots,
with no other signiﬁcant treatment differences found. Annual forbs
were signiﬁcantly higher (P < 0.05) in Thin + Burn than the un-
treated Control plots. Graminoid species with the C4 photosyn-
thetic
pathway
showed
signiﬁcantly
greater
cover
in
all
treatment groups than Control, with treatment–control differences
ranging from two- to ﬁvefold (Table 1). Shrub cover was signiﬁ-
cantly higher (P < 0.05) in Thin than Burn plots by a factor of ﬁve,
with no other signiﬁcant differences among treatments. Nonnative
plant cover in Thin + Burn plots was signiﬁcantly greater than all
other treatment groups and an order of magnitude greater than
untreated Control and Thin plots (Table 1).
Correlation analysis showed signiﬁcant negative relationships
(P < 0.05) between total understory plant cover and litter cover
as well as overstory canopy cover in 2011 (Table 2). We found no
signiﬁcant relationship between understory cover and bare ground
cover or coarse woody debris cover. Regression analysis showed
that canopy cover explained 33% and 43% of the variation in under-
story cover for unburned and burned plots, respectively, (Fig. 4).
3.2. Species richness and frequency
There were no differences (P > 0.05) among treatments in spe-
cies richness in 2004 (pretreatment). Similarly, we found no effect
of treatment on richness over the ﬁve-year period after treatments
were implemented. Mean species richness ranged from 25.2 to
27.0 species 500 m2 in 2004, 25.8–29.4 in 2007, 29.2–32.6 in
2008, and 31.8–36.8 in 2011. Over the course of the study and

across all plots, we observed 124 species in total (see Appendix A).
Analysis of richness by plant functional group in 2011 showed sig-
niﬁcantly greater numbers of annual forbs (P < 0.05) in Thin + Burn
compared with Control plots (Table 1). In addition, we found sig-
niﬁcantly greater richness of nonnative species in Thin + Burn
compared with all other treatment groups. We detected three non-
native species in 2004 prior to treatments and 11 species in 2011,
ﬁve years after treatment implementation (Appendix A). Nonna-
tive species included annual/biennial forbs Ceratocephala testicula-
ta, Erysimum repandum, and Lactuca serriola; the perennial forb
Taraxacum ofﬁcinale; and the annual grass Bromus tectorum. We
found no differences among treatments (P > 0.05) in mean value
of Simpson’s diversity index before or after treatment implementa-
tion (Table 1).
Species community composition based on frequency was simi-
lar among treatments in 2004 (P > 0.05). Similarly, there were no
signiﬁcant differences in plant community composition among
treatments in 2011. Seventy-one percent of the species observed
in 2011 were present in 2004, prior to treatment. In 2011, the most
commonly occurring species (P20% frequency) were forbs and
grasses, with few woody plants represented (Table 3).
4. Discussion
Results of this study indicated that alternative hazardous fuels
reduction treatments in southwestern P. edulis – J. osteosperma
woodlands had differential effects on understory plant community
characteristics. These differences were clearest for plant cover vari-
ables. Both Thin and Thin + Burn treatments showed signiﬁcantly
greater total cover than either Control or Burn plots ﬁve years after
treatment implementation. These responses likely reﬂected differ-
ences in residual tree density between the treatments. For exam-
ple, in previous work on these plots, Huffman et al., (2009) found
that both Thin and Thin + Burn reduced pinyon and juniper tree
densities (trees ha1) and basal area (m2 ha1) to levels signiﬁ-
cantly lower than those of both Burn and Control treatments.
Although we did not directly examine plant physiological re-
sponses, microclimate, or soil processes, other research has shown
that thinning overstory pinyon and juniper trees can enhance con-
ditions for growth and reproduction of understory plants by
increasing light availability, reducing interception of precipitation,
and reducing competition for soil moisture and nutrients (Everett
and Sharrow, 1985; Bates et al., 2000; Brockway et al., 2002). In
our study, regression analysis of total understory cover versus
overstory canopy cover supported these general patterns and
showed a signiﬁcant negative relationship (Fig. 3). Although the
relationships we found were not strong (R2 = 0.33–0.43), the shape
of the functions suggested increasing effects at relatively low can-
opy cover values. Similarly, Pieper (1990) used a 2nd-order rela-
tionship to characterize understory biomass – overstory cover
relationships in pinyon-juniper woodlands of New Mexico. Re-
sponses to canopy cover values ranging from 80% to 60% were rel-
atively minor, whereas the slope of the biomass – overstory
function became much steeper between 0% and 40% canopy cover
(Pieper 1990). In our study, more than half of the Burn treatment
plots had overstory cover values greater than 35% in 2011
(Fig. 3), suggesting that burning alone failed to reduce stand den-
sity to levels low enough to signiﬁcantly affect understory cover.
The plant functional group that tended to increase as a result of
all fuels treatments was the C4 grasses.
Total cover on Thin plots one year post-treatment increased and
was signiﬁcantly higher than that of Thin + Burn plots, which ap-
peared to decrease compared to pretreatment conditions. Both
alone and in conjunction with thinning, prescribed ﬁre initially de-
pressed understory cover, although these effects did not persist for
more than one year (Fig. 2). Other research has indicated that
understory response to prescribed ﬁre in pinyon-juniper systems
is dependent on pre-ﬁre community composition, fuel loading,
and ﬁre intensity (Bunting, 1987; Everett, 1987; Perry, 1993).
Low intensity ﬁre can mineralize nutrients contained in litter and
slash and enhance conditions for plant growth (DeBano et al.,
1987; Covington et al., 1991). However, soil heating increases with
fuel loading, fuel consumption, and ﬁre residence time, which can

result in plant mortality as well as changes in abundance and
composition of soil biota (Haskins and Gehring, 2004; Owen
et al., 2009). This in turn may increase recovery time for native
plant communities and allow opportunity for ruderal and invasive
species to establish (Haskins and Gehring, 2004, Korb et al. 2004).
In our study, we found rapid gains in plant cover on Burn and
Thin + Burn plots after 2007 (Fig. 2). Using data from Huffman
et al. (2009), we estimate that thinning added approximately
4.5 Mg ha1 of surface fuels across all timelag classes combined,
and burning resulted in about 30% fuel consumption on Thin +
Burn plots. Increases in understory cover on Burn and Thin + Burn
plots, thus, may have resulted from relatively moderate fuel
loading and consumption as well as discontinuous fuel distribution
and minimal ﬁre spread.
Increases in plant cover on Thin + Burn plots were in part
driven by establishment of ruderal species, particularly annual
forbs and nonnatives (Table 1). Although nonnative cover ap-
peared to increase in all treatment groups after implementation,
we found that nonnative cover on Thin + Burn plots was greater
than that of Controls by an order of magnitude. In 2011, we de-
tected eight species in addition to the three species found in
2004. This suggests that nonnatives are invading the study site,
possibly as a result of the hazardous fuels reduction activities
associated with the Topeka Project outside of our experimental
units. One species detected pretreatment that expanded popula-
tions post-treatment was Bromus tectorum. Other studies have
shown increases in B. tectorum after pinyon and juniper tree re-
moval, combined with various methods of slash treatment includ-
ing mastication and slash pile burning (Owen et al., 2009; Ross
et al., 2012). This species is especially prevalent in the Great Basin
and with understory dominance can form a continuous ﬁne fuel
layer that has the potential to increase ﬁre frequency, which in
turn may alter native plant community structure (Knapp, 1996;
Brooks et al., 2004). Soil disturbance associated with thinning,
along with prescribed ﬁre, can increase availability of resources
that may be exploited by invasive nonnatives on woodland sites
where initial cover of slower-growing native species is low
(Beckstead and Augspurger, 2004).

Cover of biological soil crust and bare soil was not affected by
fuels treatments (Fig. 3). In arid systems, biological soil crusts in-
crease stability of soils, inﬂuence soil hydrological processes, and
increase soil fertility (Belnap and Lange, 2003). As such, Bowker
et al. (2008) suggested using biological soil crust cover and diver-
sity, in concert with information concerning other ecological attri-
butes, as indicators of ecosystem function and for prioritizing
conservation efforts. Similarly, bare soil cover is considered a stan-
dard indicator of rangeland health due to its relationships with soil
stability and hydrologic function (Whitford et al., 1998; Pyke et al.,
2002). A trend of decreasing biological soil crust cover and increas-
ing bare soil cover from 2004 to 2011 in our study, coupled with a
lack of signiﬁcant treatment effects, suggests that changes in these
indicators were likely driven by climatic variation such as interan-
nual precipitation.
Although total plant cover on Thin and Thin + Burn treatments
increased 34–78% above pretreatment levels by 2011 (Fig. 2), cover
remained relatively low (<6%) ﬁve years after treatment imple-
mentation. Understory cover on these plots may be still considered
sparse as compared with other pinyon-juniper systems in the
Southwest. For example, Jacobs and Gatewood, (1999) reported in-
creases of 241–773% in total herbaceous cover three years after
thinning and slash mulching was applied to plots on a pinyon-juni-
per savanna in New Mexico. Initial cover ranged about 10–35% and
woody species were apparently not important on the site (Jacobs
and Gatewood, 1999). Similarly, Brockway et al., (2002) reported

graminoid cover increases of 150–250% on thinned pinyon-juniper
savanna plots where initial cover ranged about 9–12%. Limited
understory response after overstory removal has been reported
for other pinyon-juniper woodland sites in Arizona (O’Rourke
and Ogden, 1969; Clary, 1971; Huffman et al., 2008b). Factors con-
straining responses include treatment intensity, soil conditions,
initial plant cover, climatic patterns, and individual species’ life
history characteristics (Jameson and Dodd, 1969; Clary, 1971;
Vaitkus and Eddleman, 1987; Pieper, 1995). At our study site, soils
were primarily classiﬁed as Alﬁsols and described as high in poten-
tial for revegetation (USDA, 1991). However, initial cover values
were relatively low (Fig. 2) with Bouteloua gracilis and Poa fendleri-
ana – species that may be slow to respond to selective thinning and
prescribed ﬁre (Pieper, 1990, Vose and White, 1991) – being among
the most common understory species both before and ﬁve years
after treatment implementation (Table 3). In addition, annual pre-
cipitation during post-treatment measurement years was 12–67%
below the long-term average for the area (Fig. 5). Forty percent less
precipitation fell in 2011 than the long-term average (WRCC 2012).
Total species richness did not differ among treatments ﬁve
years after implementation but numbers of annual forb species
and nonnative species were signiﬁcantly higher on Thin + Burn
plots than Controls. This indicates that increases in cover of these
functional groups were in part driven by an increase in number
of species. This was in contrast with patterns observed for the C4
grasses, which showed an increase in cover without a correspond-
ing gain in richness. Overall, treatments had minor effects on
community composition. This likely reﬂects the dominance of
long-lived species in pretreatment communities (Table 3) and the
relatively slow response time that may be associated with under-
story communities in these woodland systems (Bates et al. 2005).
5. Implications and conclusions
Results from our study indicated that hazardous fuels reduction
treatments in southwestern P. edulis – J. osteosperma may effec-
tively reduce canopy fuels (Huffman et al. 2009) but may not dra-
matically affect understory abundance or composition within ﬁve
years. Treatments studied included thinning from below and appli-
cation of hand-ignited prescribed ﬁre. Treatments that included
tree thinning resulted in signiﬁcant increases in understory cover,
which were mainly driven by gains in annual forbs, warm season
(C4) grasses, and nonnative species. However, increases ﬁve years
after implementation were less than 80%, and total understory
plant cover remained less than 6% at the woodland site we studied.
Further, such treatments may not have strong effects on functional
attributes such as soil stability or hydrological processes as indi-
cated by no signiﬁcant differences in cover of biological soil crust
and bare soil among treatments. Managers that desire to reduce
hazardous fuels while simultaneously conserving structural integ-
rity and minimizing impacts to the function of these systems
should consider utilizing thinning treatments that emulate struc-
tural patterns that result from natural disturbance (Huffman
et al., 2012). However, our results indicated that thinning treat-
ments followed by prescribed ﬁre may lead to rapid increases in
nonnative species cover. This may be of particular concern where
populations of Bromus tectorum occur. Increases in community
dominance by this species may substantially alter ecological
function of infrequent-ﬁre systems.
