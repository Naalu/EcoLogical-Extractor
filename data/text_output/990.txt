Executive Summary 
This report was prepared at the request of Blue Lake Rancheria Tribe.  The purpose of this study was to 
assess the amount of woody biomass that would potentially be available to fuel a biomass energy plant 
at the Rancheria.  A quantitative approach was taken to assess the amount of economically available 
forest biomass in Humboldt County as well as the biomass potentially available from wood processing 
facilities.   
Based on an analysis of FIA data, we found that there are 172 million bone dry tons (BDT) of biomass 
contained in above ground tree biomass in stems greater than 1 inch in diameter at breast height (dbh) 
on timberlands in Humboldt County.  There are two ways in which this biomass is likely to be harvested 
from forests primarily for utilization in biomass energy plants.  On National Forest lands, integrated 
harvesting for fuel reduction thinning is likely to be used.  On private lands, biomass recovery following 
saw timber harvest is more likely to be used.  Given recent harvest levels and economic conditions, 
currently available technology, and a number of ecological and operational constraints, we estimate that 
the total amount of biomass that could be used for energy production is approximately 303,000 BDT per 
year. 
However, the amount of forest biomass that would be available at Blue Lake Rancheria will depend on 
the price that the Rancheria is willing to pay for biomass.  Taking into account stump-to-truck costs and 
transportation costs, it should possible to obtain up to 88,000 BDT per year of forest biomass at a cost of 
$50 per BDT.  It should be noted that cost estimates can change significantly based on varying stand and 
work conditions as well as changes in transportation costs.  The main report explores the sensitivity of 
this estimate to changes in the underlying costs. 
Mill residue generated during the process of converting timber into lumber provides a second potential 
source of feedstock for an energy plant.  Given recent harvest levels and the amount of residue that 
California mills produce per unit of timber processed, we estimate that about 408,000 BDT per year of 
mill residues will be produced in Humboldt County.   Unlike forest residues, much of which is currently 
not being utilized, mill residues are currently being utilized by other local industries including biomass 
energy plants, soil manufacturers, and landscaping companies.  Local mills typically receive $40-45 per 
BDT for these residues.  This price does not include the cost of transportation. 
There are three local bioenergy plants which have a combined generating capacity of 58 MW and an 
estimated biomass demand of 508,000 BDT per year.  These plants currently obtain feedstock not only 
from local mills and forests, but also from outside of the local area.  The average delivered price for 
feedstock is approximately $50 per BDT.  
The Blue Lake Rancheria Tribe has recently purchased a 175 kilowatt ClearGen distributed generation 
fuel cell system and may expand its generating capacity in the future.  The projected demand for 
biomass is not expected to exceed 5 BDT per day or 1,825 BDT per year.  Given the 88,000 BDT of woody 
biomass per year that is likely to be available from forests, the ratio of realistically and economically 
available biomass to the projected annual fuel use is approximately 48:1.  This ratio exceeds the 
common benchmark of 2.0:1.

Introduction 
This report was prepared at the request of Blue Lake Rancheria Tribe.  The purpose of this study is to 
assess the feasibility of operating a distributed generation biomass fueled energy plant at the Rancheria.  
The plant may eventually require up to 5 bone dry tons (BDT) of biomass/day.  A quantitative approach 
was taken to assess the amount available forest biomass in Humboldt County as well as the biomass 
potentially available from wood processing facilities.  The report includes descriptions and locations of 
potentially available biomass feedstock in Humboldt County.  Forestland ownerships and general 
management objectives and policies within ownerships are presented in order to assess the likelihood 
that biomass harvesting is a potential source for future feedstock supplies.  In addition, biomass 
harvesting operational costs and logistics were gathered to determine cost effective strategies for 
securing feedstock supply.  We also survey the current industry demographics of biomass power 
facilities in Humboldt County.  The assessment includes a description of feedstock demands of current 
biomass facilities and energy output. Finally, we assess the risk factors associated with procuring 
biomass fuel from forests.  
2. Available Woody Biomass Resource in Humboldt County 
This section provides estimates of 1) the total woody biomass on timberlands in Humboldt County, 2) 
the annual amount of woody biomass feedstock likely to be available from public forest lands, 3) the 
annual amount of woody biomass feedstock likely to be available from private forest lands, 4) the 
annual amount of woody biomass feedstock likely to be available from Tribal forest lands, 5) the annual 
woody biomass feedstock likely to be available as residues from wood processing plants 6) the annual 
woody biomass feedstock likely to be available from agricultural and urban sources.   
The estimates of biomass availability reported in this section are derived from a number of sources.  
Those sources frequently used different sampling methods, reporting methods, reporting units, and 
conversion factors and there are often differences in reported values between sources.  There will be 
inconsistencies when the same methods applied to different samples.  Consequently, the numbers 
reported here should be treated as estimates. 
2.1 Woody Biomass on Forest Lands in Humboldt County 
The U.S. Forests Service’s Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program collects data on forest conditions 
throughout the United States.  The data can be used to estimate on-site woody biomass.  The 
information presented in this section was derived from the Forest Inventory Data Online, EVALIDator, 
and FIA DataMart tools available on the FIA website (http://www.fia.fs.fed.us/tools-data/default.asp).  
The report relies on the most recently available data for Humboldt County, which was collected in 2011.  
According to the latest figures, there are 172 million bone dry tons (BDT) of biomass contained in above 
ground tree biomass in stems greater than 1 inch in diameter at breast height dbh on timberlands in 
Humboldt county (Table 1).   
The FIA subdivides forestland into a number of categories (Table 2).  First, it is divided based on whether 
it is reserved or non-reserved.  Reserved forestland includes areas on public lands such as wilderness 
areas and national parks that are not open to timber harvesting.  The non-reserved forestland is 
theoretically open to timber harvests.  However, it is probably not economically feasible or ecologically

sensible to harvest in areas with very low productivity.  Consequently, the database identifies 
timberland as areas that are both legally open to harvest and are capable of producing at least 20 cubic 
feet of wood per acre per year.  
The distribution of biomass on timberlands in the county is roughly proportional to the distribution of 
timberland area (table 3).  Approximately 18% of the timberlands and 22% of the total biomass on 
timberlands is located on Forest Service Land.  Approximately 78% of the timberlands and 74% of the 
biomass on timberlands is located on private land.  Although the FIA data suggest that BLM lands 
account for 3.0% of the timberland area and 2.8% of the biomass on timberlands in Humboldt County, 
most of the BLM lands are managed as reserves (e.g. the King Range National Conservation Area and 
Headwaters Forest Reserve).  While harvests designed to facilitate ecological restoration do occasionally 
occur on BLM land (Chris Heppe, 2011), this analysis assumes that they will not be a significant source of 
biomass feedstock.

2.2 Procurement from Public Land 
The proportion of the total standing biomass that would actually be available for a biomass power 
project depends on technical, economic, and social constraints.  Some of the biomass will not be 
accessible because of inability to access and/or process it with current technology.  For example, it may 
not be feasible to harvest biomass on steep slopes.  Other biomass could be accessed using available 
technology, but it would not be economically feasible to do so.  For example, it may be too far from a 
road or too dispersed throughout the harvest unit.  Finally, some biomass projects may be technically 
accessible and economically viable, but are unlikely to be socially acceptable.  For example, it may be 
unacceptable to harvest biomass from late successional (i.e. old) forest stands.  Assessments of biomass 
availability in other regions have used a variety of filters to address these constraints and determine the 
amount of realistically available biomass (Morgan 2009). 
In Humboldt County the constraints are likely to be different on public and private land.  This can be 
seen in the amount of timber that has historically been harvested from public and private land1 (Figure 
1).  Between 1997 and 2010, 2% of the timber harvested in Humboldt County was harvested from the 
Six Rivers National Forest.  However, 18% of the County’s timberlands (i.e., non-reserved forestlands) 
are on the Forest.  A similar pattern of disproportionally low harvesting on public lands is seen at the 
state level: in 2006 13% of the volume harvested in California was sourced from National Forests, while 
51% of the timberlands in California are on National Forests (Morgan et al. 2012).  The reasons for this 
pattern are complex, but the consequence is straightforward: biomass yields from public land will be 
lower than biomass yields from private land. 
 
 
                                                           
1 The harvest on private lands was determined from California Board of Equalization (2011, 2012) timber harvest 
statistics.  The harvest on Six Rivers National Forest were determined from the U.S. Forest Service’s Periodic 
Timber Sale Accomplishment Reports (PSTAR), 1997-2012.

Forest and private lands in Humboldt County (1997-2011). 
 
On public forest land biomass harvesting has typically occurred to promote specific environmental 
benefits and enhance forest health.  Social constraints probably preclude extensive use of other types of 
harvesting (e.g., the biomass recovery projects that are carried out on private land).  In an example of a 
type of harvesting that is designed to enhance forest health, the USFS in northern California has utilized 
an integrated harvesting method to remove sawlogs and biomass as a means of reducing hazardous 
fuels.  In a recent stewardship project on the Klamath National Forest, harvesting for biomass was 
limited to trees with a dbh of 3.0-9.9 on land with slopes <35% (Mark Anderson, 2012).  While not 
specified in the stewardship agreement, projects generally occur relatively close to existing roads.  
Consequently, we screened out areas greater than 0.5 miles from a road.  Approximately 1.1 million BDT 
of biomass is currently available on 98,129 acres on National Forest timber land that meets these 
constraints (Table 4).  This is approximately 12 BDT per acre of land that has a potential to be treated. 
Unfortunately, for reasons that will be explained in the section 3, hazardous fuels reduction projects are 
expensive to implement.  Consequently, we believe that the annual availability of biomass from the 
national forest will depend on how much federal funding is available for forest health projects more 
than it will depend on market conditions or how much biomass is available. At the moment there are a 
number of programs that might make Forest Service lands a feasible source of biomass.  For example, 
there is a 2013 U.S. Forest Service supported Hazardous Fuels Woody Biomass Utilization Grant 
Program.  However, over the long term, this source of woody biomass would be susceptible to changes 
in federal funding priorities and policies.

While the Six Rivers National Forest has received funding in the past and is likely to receive additional 
funding for these types of projects, the number of acres treated is relatively small.  In 2010 the Six Rivers 
National Forest used mechanical treatments for hazardous fuels reduction projects on 1,482 acres.  In 
2011, 962 acres were treated (Six Rivers National Forest).  If we assume an average of 1,200 acre treated 
per year and an average harvest level of 12 BDT per acre, then one can expect approximately 14,000 
BDT per year from this source.  While a larger harvest level could probably be sustained, this harvest 
level is consistent with current federal policy and management practices.

2.3 Procurement from Private Land 
On commercial timberlands in Humboldt County, biomass recovery projects are being used as an 
alternative to pile burning for site preparation (Alcorn 2012).  Biomass recovery projects involve 
removing forest residues (e.g. limbs, tops, slash, and small diameter trees) after saw-timber harvesting is 
completed on a site.  As with the National Forest, the amount of biomass actually available for biomass 
energy projects on private forest lands depends on a number of factors including technical, economic, 
and ecological constraints.  
O’Neil and Lipke (2009) used the analogy of a biomass bucket.  When a harvest occurs, the biomass 
bucket is full.  In their study, which included a diversity of stand types and harvest methods in eastern 
Washington, they found that 50% of the harvested biomass was sent to wood processing facilities (e.g., 
sawmills).  Of the remaining 50%, some biomass was left on site to sustain ecological function.  
Consequently, accessible biomass accounted for 30-35% of the total harvest.  However, it was only 
economically feasible to recover about 20% of the total as biomass feedstock.   
As an example, consider a piece of land on which 100 BDT per acre is cut.  One would expect 50 BDT per 
acre to be removed and sold as timber for processing into lumber.  It would be economically, 
technically, and ecologically feasible to remove another 20 BDT per acre as biomass.  The remaining 30 
BDT per acre would remain on site.  Thus, recoverable biomass is equivalent to about 40% of the 
amount of biomass being removed as timber.  In addition to the material that could be recovered 
directly from the forest, around 60% of the biomass that is sent to the mill will end up as mill residue 
(see section 2.5).  This would contribute another 30 BDT that could potentially be used as fuel for energy 
production.

The amount of potentially available biomass from biomass recovery projects was estimated using the 
following procedure.  First, data on timber harvest volumes for Humboldt County was obtained from the 
California Board of Equalization (2011, 2012).  Second, we converted the harvest volume from thousand 
board feet (mbf) to cubic meters assuming 6.76 m3 per mbf (Spelter 2002). Third, we converted from 
cubic meters to bone dry kilograms based on a specific gravity of 0.43 (Table 5).  The specific gravity of 
species harvested in California ranged from 0.33 to 0.51 (Forest Products Laboratory 2010).  Each 
individual species’ specific gravity was weighted by the proportion of the harvest in California that is 
attributable to that species (Morgan et al. 2012).  The weighted average specific gravity for species 
harvested in California was 0.43. Fourth, we converted from kilograms to (short) tons.  Finally, we 
assumed that the amount of recoverable biomass would be 40% of the amount of timber that had been 
harvested (Table 6). 
The amount of timber harvested in Humboldt County has declined over the past 20 years.  This is 
apparent in the trend in average annual harvest over the last 20, 10 and 5 years. The lowest annual 
harvest over the last 20 years occurred in 2009, the worst year of the great recession.  It has increased 
since then and economic projections suggest the demand for timber should continue to increase as the 
economy continues to recover (Campbell Group 2013).  Consequently, it is relatively conservative to use 
the average harvest over the last five years to project the annual amount of biomass that is potentially 
available for a biomass plant.  Thus, one could expect to have access to up to 272,000 BDT per year of 
material from biomass recovery projects in Humboldt County.  If the rate of timber harvesting returns to 
prerecession levels, one would expect a higher amount of potentially available biomass.

Only a limited amount of this material is currently being used in biomass projects.  However, given a 
market demand, additional material would be relatively easily available.  Furthermore, since this 
material comes from private land and has been harvested under approved timber harvest plans in the 
past, it is unlikely that changes in state or federal policy will affect the basic availability of this source of 
biomass.  Consequently, this is the likely to be the largest source of currently unutilized material in 
Humboldt County.

2.4 Procurement from Tribal Land 
For the purposes of this report tribal land is reservation or Rancheria land.  It does not include fee land 
owned by various tribal entities.  To the extent that fee lands are forested and managed for timber, they 
are included in the “Private Land” category.  For example, the 22,000 acre of land recently purchased by 
the Yurok Tribe from Green Diamond is treated as Private Land. 
The major tribal entity that manages timberland on reservation land is the Hoopa Valley Tribal Forestry 
Department.  This organization is responsible for managing 81,019 acres of forested trust reservation 
land (SmartWood Program, 2000).  Of this total area, 52,943 are classified as commercial timberlands.  
The remaining lands are reserved because of cultural, wildlife, geologic reasons.  The annual allowable 
cut on the timberlands is 10,356 mbf.  Assuming that the biomass on this land could be harvested in a 
manner similar to private land, the land has the potential of producing approximately 17,000 BDT of 
biomass per year. 
2.5 Procurement from Primary Wood Processing Facilities 
Another potentially significant source of woody biomass is wood residue generated by sawmills.  There 
are 6 major operational mills in Humboldt County (Figure 2)2.  Residual material is generated as a result 
of the primary production in the mills.  Changes in federal or state policies are unlikely to impact the 
availability of this supply.  Changes in economic conditions that drive the demand for lumber will have 
secondary effects on the supply of residual material.  Furthermore, over longer time periods the volume 
of residuals produced per thousand board feet of lumber is declining as technological advances make 
plants more efficient.  For example, in 2000 mills produced 1.104 BDT of residue per thousand board 
feet of lumber produced compared to 1.020 in 2006 (Morgan et al. 2012). 
Morgan et al. (2012) reported the results of a census of California mills conducted in 2006.  Among other 
information, the census gathered data on volumes and uses of mill residue. They found that about 60% 
of the wood fiber (including bark) processed by primary forest products plants ends up as mill residue.  
This is equivalent to producing 1.02 BDT of residues per thousand board feet of lumber produced.  
During 2006, California produced 2.7 million bone dry tons of residual materials (Table 7).  Morgan et al. 
(2012) do not provide county level data.  However, about 1,068,000 BDT of biomass were harvested in 
Humboldt County for lumber in 2006 (Table 6), so we estimate that about 641,000 BDT of residual 
material were produced.  Both timber harvest levels and sawmill capacity in the county have declined 
since that time and we estimate that less would be available today.  Assuming that 60% of the biomass 
that enters the mills ends up as residues and that the amount of wood harvested in Humboldt county is 
equal to the amount of wood processed in mills in Humboldt County, then the average production of 
mill residue between 2007 and 2011 has been approximately 408,000 BDT per year. 
 
 
                                                           
2 In addition to these larger mills, there may be a number of smaller mills in operation.  For example, Almquist 
lumber operates a small sawmill that produces small batches of lumber.  No attempt was made to assess the 
productive capacity of these mills.  However, since our estimate of mill residue is based on timber harvest levels in 
Humboldt County, their production of residue material is accounted for in our analysis.

One can roughly estimate the amount of residual material produced by individual mills based on their 
relative production capacities4.  The production capacities of operating sawmills were derived from 
Spelter et al. (2009).  With two exceptions, the figures are based on production capacity in 2009.  The 
Britt Lumber sawmill was temporarily out of operation in 2009, so its current production capacity was 
assumed to be the same as its 2007 value.  No information was available for Mad River Lumber. Residual 
factors from Morgan (2012) were applied to get estimates of the residue production (Table 8).  Based on 
these assumptions, the total amount of residual material generated in Humboldt County is 
approximately 720,000 BDT per year.  It should be noted, however, that the vast majority of this 
material is currently being utilized in some way (see section 4.1).

have been converted to BDT.

2.6 Procurement from Urban and Agricultural Sources 
Humboldt County is extensively forested and has a well-developed forest products sector which 
produces sufficient biomass to fuel the plant under consideration.  Both the urban areas and the non-
ranching agricultural sector are relatively small.  Unlike in the Central Valley, there is not a large orchard 
industry which would generate significant amounts of woody biomass.  Given these facts, it was 
assumed that urban and agricultural sources would provide minimal amounts of biomass.  No attempt 
was made to quantify the exact magnitude of these sources. 
3 Cost of Procuring Biomass 
This section examines the cost of procuring biomass from forest lands. In the next section we will look at 
the prices being paid for biomass at local biomass power plants as well as the prices being received by 
sawmills for various sawmill residue.   
The cost of procuring biomass from the forest can be broken into the onsite cost associated with getting 
the biomass from the stump onto a truck and the travel cost associated with getting the biomass from 
the processing/loading site to the ultimate site of utilization.  The material that will be produced from 
the forest is assumed to be hog fuel (ground sub-merchantable trees and logging slash). 
3.1 Stump-to-truck Costs 
The costs associated with the harvesting, collection, and processing of biomass were estimated based on 
a number of studies conducted over several years in forests in Northern California and Southern Oregon.  
Researchers at Humboldt State University’s Forest Operations Laboratory have assessed costs 

5/15/13 
Blue Lake Biomass Availability:Final Report 
14 
associated with biomass harvest operations using two basic methods.  First, they have conducted expert 
opinion surveys to identify costs associated with typical fuel reduction thinning projects.  Second, they 
have used time and motion studies to assess actual costs associated with specific projects.  We 
summarize information from both types of studies below.  In this study, it was assumed that forest 
residues would come from either: 
• 
Integrated harvesting for fuel reduction thinning (i.e. biomass and sawlog harvesting for 
fuel management) 
• 
Biomass recovery (i.e. collecting forest residues after saw-timber operations) 
Integrated Harvesting:  
Integrated harvesting for fuel reduction thinning is more expensive than biomass recovery and has 
typically been used on public lands.  As noted above, it has been used by the Forest Service to reduce 
hazardous fuels and enhance forest health.  Based on past and on-ongoing research conducted by the 
Forest Operations Laboratory at Humboldt State University (e.g., Coltrin 2013, Han et al 2010, Viorelo et 
al. 2011), we estimate that stump-to-truck costs for this type of operation are likely to range from $40 to 
$60/BDT.  These studies have looked at a variety of projects utilizing different equipment configurations 
and harvest conditions likely to be encountered in the forests of Northern California.  It should be noted 
that the costs assessed and reported in these studies (and in most studies of this type) do not include 
any allowance for overhead or profit for the operator.  In section 6 we estimate the amount of biomass 
that would be available from this type of operation at low ($40/BDT), medium ($50/BDT), and high 
($60/BDT) costs.   
Biomass Recovery: 
Biomass recovery is utilized on private lands and is the cheaper method of procurement.   Cost 
estimates for this type of operation vary based on stand and work conditions.  Based on past and on-
ongoing research conducted by the Forest Operations Laboratory at Humboldt State University (e.g., 
Bisson et al. 2013, Harrill and Han 2010, Harrill and Han 2012) we estimate that stump-to-truck costs for 
biomass recovery operations are likely to range from $20 to $40/BDT. As with the integrated harvesting 
studies, these studies have examined a variety of equipment configurations and harvest conditions.  In 
section 6 we estimate the amount of biomass that would be available from this type of operation at low 
($20/BDT), medium ($30/BDT), and high ($40/BDT) costs. 
3.2 Transportation Costs 
The cost of transporting biomass depends on the travel time. Travel time, in turn, depends on travel 
speed and distance traveled.  Travel speed on various road types in was derived from a number of 
studies of recent studies of biomass operations in the California and Oregon (Table 9).  Bisson et al. 
(2013) calculated that the cost per BDT per hour for chip vans was $6-7 based on a project in which a 42 
foot chip trailer was used to transport biomass from a central grinding location to a biomass utilization 
plant.

3.3 Allowance for Indirect Costs 
While the figures presented in this analysis do not explicitly take into account indirect costs such as 
overhead, mobilization and profit allowances for the logging company5, we did investigate what an 
appropriate allowance should be.  In order to estimate an allowance for indirect costs, we conducted a 
literature review to determine an appropriate estimate for such costs in forest operations.  In a review 
of fuel reduction treatments, Rummer identified several critical gaps in the understanding of operations 
costs.  These included insufficient data on business overhead, repair and maintenance reserves, and 
estimates of the cost of risk.  Hartsough (2003) assumed 10% overhead when evaluating a thinning 
project designed to promote late seral structure in a forest in north eastern California.  In a survey of 
logging contractors in the Eastern United States conducted annually between 1995 and 2005, Stuart et 
al. (2007) found that overhead accounted for 2-3% of the logging cost per ton. Insurance accounted for 
another 3-4%.  Lynch (2001) determined that 7% of the total costs for fuel reduction treatments in 
Colorado were administrative overhead.  According to the financial information company Sageworks, 
Inc., profit margins in the logging sector between 2006 and 2012 have averaged 1.8% and ranged 
between 0.28% and 4.69% (Biery 2012).  Consequently, we estimate that including indirect costs would 
add 10-15% to the cost of producing biomass.  If these costs were taken into account, it would shift the 
cost procurement curve slightly to the right (see figure 5).  Thus, somewhat less biomass would be 
available at a given price than is reported here. 
3.4 Cost of Biomass Material 
The calculations above represent the costs associated with producing hog fuel.  They do not include any 
revenue for the landowner.  Stumpage price is the value that individual landowners receive for forest 
products “on the stump”.  It depends on factors such as the distance to a mill, operational 
characteristics of the unit being harvested, and characteristics of the trees being harvested (e.g., species 
and size).  Stumpage value represents the difference between what a mill is willing to pay for delivered 
wood and the costs associated with harvesting and transported that wood to the mill.  Stumpage value 
                                                           
5 We have also not taken into account the costs associated with planning for a harvest (e.g., developing a timber 
harvest plan).  In the case of private lands it can be assumed that these costs will be covered by the revenue from 
the actual sale of timber.  In the case of public lands additional resources would need to be allocated to get the 
sale through the NEPA process. 
 

5/15/13 
Blue Lake Biomass Availability:Final Report 
16 
can be thought of as a residual value – it is the residue that remains after all other costs have been taken 
into account. 
The California Board of Equalization publishes semi-annual harvest values for a range of forest products 
that are used to calculate yield taxes.  These prices are roughly equivalent to stumpage prices.   The 
assigned harvest value for woods-produced fuel chips is $0.00 per BDT.  That is, it is assumed that the 
landowner receives no money for the sale of fuel chips.  This is consistent with the idea that fuel wood 
will be harvested and sold either 1) to offset the cost of providing an environmental benefit (hazardous 
fuel reductions) or 2) as an alternative to pile burning.  Thus, we assume that the cost of the biomass 
itself will be negligible. 
4 Prices Paid for Biomass Fuel 
The previous section analyzed the costs of procuring biomass from the standpoint of biomass producers.  
In this section we analyze the prices that are currently being paid for biomass and project the price 
forward for five years.   
4.1 Price of Sawmill Residue 
Estimated prices for sawmill residues were obtained from local wood processing companies.  The prices 
reported here represent prices at the mill and do not include transportation.  Representatives of 
Schmidbauer Lumber and Humboldt Redwood Company quoted $40-45/BDT for mill residues 
(Steinbuck, 2013).  It was noted that exact pricing would depend on quantities demanded and whether a 
long term contract was in place.  The representative from Schmidbauer said that they made little 
distinction between residue types.  The representative from Humboldt Redwood Company noted that 
sawdust tended to command a higher price ($50-60/BDT) because of its use in soil manufacturing 
operations.  Prices for sawdust can be particularly high on a seasonal basis depending on the level of 
production in the mill and the demand from soil manufacturers.   
The representative from California Redwood Company was willing to give a more detailed price 
breakdown and explanation of where the product is currently being used (Table 10).  California 
Redwood Company uses some of its residues to fuel its drying kiln.  Others are sold on either long term 
contract or into the open market.  For example, the company has long-term contracts to supply sawdust 
to Fox Farm and a mix of residues to DG Fairhaven.  When the existing local biomass power plants are 
operational, supply is limited.  In recent years California Redwood has not been able to provide the 
contracted quantities of biomass to DG Fairhaven.  However, when a power plant shuts down 
operations, it can be a challenge to find markets for the available residues.   
4.2 Price Paid for Biomass at Local Biomass Power Plants 
The price paid for biomass feedstock in Humboldt County tends to be higher than statewide prices.  The 
current average mill gate price paid for woody biomass used for power production in Humboldt County 
is approximately $50 per BDT delivered (Bob Marino, 2012).  According to public presentations given by 
Bob Marino, the average price over the last several years has ranged from a high of $60 per BDT (in 
2008) to a low of $40 per BDT (in 2010). This includes not only feedstock sourced from local areas (e.g., 

5/15/13 
Blue Lake Biomass Availability:Final Report 
17 
mill residues as well chips and whole logs directly from forests), but also shipments of feedstock from 
outside of the immediate area.

Lane 2013).

4.3 Five Year Price Forecast 
In order to forecast the potential price over the next 5 years, we assumed an inflation rate of 2%.  This 
assumption is based on the average inflation rate, over the last 10 years, of the Producer Price Index for 
finished goods less food and energy. We also provide an inflation adjustment for the low and high prices 
seen in recent years (figure 3).   
Figure 3. Projected mill gate price for woody biomass. 
 
                                                           
6 This value seems rather high.  It was based on a California Redwood Company’s reported sales price of $20-
22/green ton and a reported moisture content of 70%.  Humboldt Redwood Company estimated the moisture 
content of their sawdust at 50-60%.  If the moisture content at California Redwood Company is actually 60% rather 
than 70%, then the cost would be $50-55 per BDT.  Both companies use water cooled saws, so one would expect 
relatively high moisture content in the sawdust.

5 Spatial Distribution of Biomass Resource & Procurement Area Relative to 
Project Site 
The spatial distribution of forest land ownership was derived from the Humboldt County GIS database.  
It records not only the ownership status (public, private, tribal) but also the zoning and primary land use 
of assessor parcels in the county.  This data was used to classify the land in Humboldt County into the 
following classes: 
• 
National Forest 
• 
Tribal Lands 
• 
Timber Production Zone (TPZ) 
• 
Grazing/Timber 
• 
Other lands 
For the purposes of the spatial analysis, the following assumptions were made.  First, it was assumed 
that productive timberlands were evenly distributed throughout each ownership.7  Second, it was 
assumed that timber harvesting on private lands would occur only on lands whose primary use was 
timber production.   
The potential biomass procurement area was determined based on round trip travel time to and from 
Blue Lake Rancheria (Figure 4).  Travel distances were derived from 2012 Tiger line/shapefiles, which 
contains a road network and road types for Humboldt County (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012).  GIS tools 
were used to analyze the travel times necessary to get from points along roads to Blue Lake Rancheria.  
Travel time was converted into travel cost classes (Table 11).

7 Because of the data structure of the Humboldt County GIS database, some of the areas that are in a given 
ownership class are not actually forested.  This is most apparent in two cases.  In the least expensive cost zone, 
there are small areas of Tribal lands and National Forest Lands.  In part, these areas represent the Blue Lake 
Rancheria and the Forest Service’s former nursery near McKinleyville.  
8 Travel cost for this zone assumed to be $60.

Summary of Total Realistically and Economically Available Fuel 
The cost of harvesting on each type of ownership and the cost of transporting the fuel from the field to 
Blue Lake Rancheria was taken into account to estimate the cumulative amount of biomass that would 
be available at total costs ranging from $10 per BDT up to $120 per BDT (Table 12, Figure 5).  We took 
into account low, medium and high costs for each ownership type.  For private ownerships, where it was 
assumed that biomass recovery would be used (see section 3.1), costs were assumed to be $20/BDT, 
$30/BDT, or $40/BDT.  For National Forest land, where it was assumed that integrated harvesting would 
be used, costs were assumed to be $40/BDT, $50/BDT, or $60/BDT. 
The Blue Lake Rancheria Tribe has recently purchased a 175 kilowatt ClearGen distributed generation 
fuel cell system.  However, they may expand their generating capacity in the future.  Their projected 
demand for biomass is not expected to exceed 5 BDT per day or 1,825 BDT per year (Jana Ganion, 2012).  
If one assumes medium stump-to-truck costs, at a cost of $50 for on-site processing and transportation 
to Blue Lake, one would be able to access 88,000 BDT of woody biomass per.  The ratio of realistically 
and economically available biomass to the projected annual fuel use is approximately 48:1.  This ratio 
exceeds the common benchmark of 2.0:1.

6 Risk Assessment 
In this section we offer a risk assessment of future biomass fuel supply.  In particular, we assess the 
potential impacts of local, state and federal policy changes; address the competitive dynamics for 
biomass resource supply; assess the likelihood that additional fuel types will become available in the 
near future; and assess the changes that transportation costs could have on the cost of biomass.  
6.1 Local, State, and Federal Policy & Management 
Increased utilization of forest biomass and installation of additional biomass capacity in Humboldt 
County is consistent with local, state, and national energy policy goals (Table 13).  Biomass provides a 
local, renewable source of energy that has the potential to be part of a distributed energy generation 
system that reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Given the array of policies that are currently in place, 
there is strong support for biomass energy in Humboldt County.  This support may translate into funding 
opportunities that would make a small scale energy project more economically attractive.  Funding 
could potentially be used for capital investment, research and development to deploy new technology, 
or funds for hazardous fuels reduction projects – especially in the wildland urban interface. 
However, there are some long-term risks.  First, as was noted in section 3, hazardous fuels reduction 
projects are generally expensive to undertake.  Although biomass fuels from such projects (i.e., the 
biomass coming from the National Forest) is not the major component of the biomass resource 
identified in this report, never-the-less decreases in funding for forest health projects could reduce the 
amount of biomass available at a given price.

Energy (Redwood

The Redwood Coast Energy Authority is a joint powers association 
representing seven municipalities in Humboldt County whose 
purpose is to develop and implement sustainable energy initiatives 
that reduce energy demand, increase energy efficiency, and advance 
the use of clear, efficient, and renewable resources available in the 
region. 
Second, biomass energy has been promoted not only because it is a renewable resource, but also 
because it is believed to have positive climactic benefits.  While it is widely agreed that biomass is a 
renewable resource, the net climactic benefits of using biomass energy have been debated (e.g., 
Manomet Center for Conservation Sciences 2010).   A decision to permit a proposed biomass project in 
Placer County California was recently appealed by the Center for Biological Diversity on basis that 
project developers had incorrectly assessed it greenhouse gas emissions (Moran, 2013).  The Manomet 
study notes that the atmospheric greenhouse gas implications of using biomass fuel vary depending on 
the characteristics of the technology used, the technology it replaces, and the biophysical and forest 
management characteristics of the forests from which the biomass is harvested.  While it seems likely 
that the types of projects analyzed in this report could lead to a net decrease in greenhouse gas 
emissions, it is beyond the scope of this report to offer a definitive assessment of the carbon dynamics 
of biomass utilization in Humboldt County. 
6.2 Supply & Demand for Woody Biomass 
As of March 1 2013, the county had three operating or potentially operational biomass plants (Table 14).  
These plants have a combined capacity of 58 MW.  Conventional plants consume about 1 BDT per 
MWhr.  The plants have the potential to consume in excess of 507,000 BDT per year.  They may provide 
a competitive challenge for biomass material, especially mill residue because they 1) are closer to 
primary processing facilities, 2) in some cases they have long term supply contracts with sawmills, and 3) 
they demand larger quantities of biomass, which makes them more attractive markets. It is also worth 
noting that the currently shuttered Eel River Plant, which closed in October 2012, cited an inability to 
secure stable supplies of wood waste as one of the reasons for shutting down its operations.   

5/15/13

Table 14. Location and biomass demand of existing biomass energy plants in Humboldt County. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This points to another source of risk – lack of biomass supply.  The supply projected in this report is 
predicated on having healthy levels of timber harvesting and processing occurring in the county.  In 
January of 2013 California Redwood Company shut down the second shift at its Korbel plant and laid off 
45 employees.  Layoff notices have gone out to the remaining employees and more layoffs are possible 
this spring.  The Korbel plant has the second largest production capacity of any plant in the county.  If it 
shuts down completely, this will result in a significant decline in the amount of biomass produced as 
sawmill residue.   
Plant closures and/or temporary shutdowns will also lead to a lower level of timber harvesting.  This is 
important because it is much more cost efficient to remove biomass as part of a timber harvest than as 
part of a fuel reduction thinning (see section 3.1). While regional timber markets do seem to be 
improving and the harvest level is above the historic low of 2009, harvesting may not return to 
prerecession levels. 
Future demand for biomass is uncertain.  According to RePower Humboldt, biomass energy was 
responsible for 25% of the electric production in Humboldt County in 2010 (Schatz Energy Research 
Center, 2012). The report suggested that biomass could provide up to 58% of the total primary energy 
needs by 2030.  It projected that as much as 225 MW could be produced.  The additional capacity would 
primarily come from timber harvest byproducts.  The report identifies biomass as a key player in a 
sustainable energy future.  This could be either a boon or a hindrance to operating a plant on the 
Rancheria.  On the one hand, a larger demand for forest based biomass could lead to efficiencies of 
scale.  On the other hand, increased demand for biomass could also drive up the price. 
6.3 Additional Fuel Types 
Given Humboldt County’s rural character and relative isolation from the rest of the state, it is unlikely 
that additional biomass fuel types will become available in the near future. 
6.4 Changes in Transportation Costs 
Changes in transportation costs are most likely to be associated with changes in the price of fuel.  Fuel is 
used not only for transportation from the forest to the biomass energy facility, but also to get wood 
from the stump to the truck.  Consequently, transportation costs changes will be correlated with 
changes in the stump-to-truck costs.  Harrill et al. (2009) found that a 20% change in the price of diesel

resulting in a 6.3% change in the total costs (stump-to-truck and hauling) associated with a woody 
biomass project in Northern California.   
We investigated historic fuel costs in order to assess the level of variability likely to be seen in biomass 
availability.  Between January 2007 and December 2012, average weekly retail prices for mid-grade gas 
across California was $3.47 per gal (California Energy Commission, 2013).  It ranged from 53% of the 5-
year average ($1.87 per gallon) to a high of 137% of average ($4.77 per gallon).  It was assumed that 
long term diesel prices would track gasoline prices.  Based on the assumption that a 20% change in fuel 
prices would result in a 6.3% change in total system costs, we projected the effect of a 40% increase or 
40% decrease in the cost of fuel (Figure 6).   All else being equal, a 40% increase in fuel prices would 
decrease the amount of biomass available at a price of $50 per ton from 88,000 BDT per year to 45,000 
BDT per year.  A 40% decrease in fuel prices would increase the amount of biomass available at a price 
of $50 per ton from 88,000 BDT per year to 173,000 BDT per year.  In both cases the ratio of realistically 
and economically available biomass to the projected annual fuel use would exceed the common 
benchmark of 2.0:1.

7 Summary  
There are approximately 172 million BDT of biomass on timberlands in Humboldt County.  We assume 
that there are two primary methods by which biomass will be harvested from forest lands: integrated 
harvesting for fuel reduction thinning and biomass recovery following timber harvest operations.  We 
estimate that the total amount of biomass that could be used for energy production is approximately 
303,000 BDT per year.  This figure assumes 14,000 BDT per year from Forest Service lands through 
integrated harvesting for fuel reduction; 272,000 BDT per year from biomass recovery projects on 
private land; and 17,000 BDT per year from biomass recovery projects on Tribal lands.  
 In addition to biomass from forest lands, we estimate that the county can produce 408,000 BDT of 
sawmill residuals based on recent harvest levels and mill capacities.  Almost all mill residuals are 
currently being used.  Potential biomass feedstock that comes directly from the forest is largely 
untapped.  We estimate that at a direct cost of $50 per ton, there are potentially 88,000 BDT tons per 
year that could be transported from local forests to Blue Lake Rancheria.
