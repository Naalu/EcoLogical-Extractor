Permanent Inventory Plots in Northern Arizona
Ponderosa Pine Forests

Abstract
A network of permanent plots established between 1909
and 1913 (the Woolsey plots) contains the oldest mea-
sured data in northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests.
These forest inventory data offer a unique opportunity to
reconstruct pre-settlement reference conditions, as well as
detect and quantify changes in southwestern forest struc-
ture and composition. However, the selection of plot loca-
tions in the early 1900s followed a subjective nonrandom
approach. To assess the applicability, or inference space,
of results obtained from these historical plots, we com-
pared their environmental characteristics (terrestrial eco-
system unit [TEU, based on a U.S. Forest Service (USFS)
ecological classiﬁcation system], site index, elevation,
insolation index, and soil parent material) as well as con-
temporary forest structure (trees per hectare, basal area,
and quadratic mean diameter) with two large inventory
samples: USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis (FSFIA)
and Arizona State Land Department Continuous Forest
Inventory (AZCFI). Analytical methods included multi-
variate permutation tests, ratios of variance, and Kolmo-
gorov–Smirnov two-sample tests. Results indicated that
the Woolsey plots (1) were neither historically nor con-
temporarily
representative
of
the
entire
study
area
because of environmental and current forest structural dif-
ferences with respect to the FSFIA and AZCFI and (2)
may be considered historically representative of their cor-
responding TEUs. Our study supports the use of TEUs
for deﬁning the applicability of information obtained from
the Woolsey plots.

Introduction
Reference conditions, the characteristics of an ecosystem
prior to Euro-American and Hispanic settlement (pre-
settlement), play an important role in guiding ecological
restoration activities in the southwestern United States
(Kaufmann et al. 1994; Moore et al. 1999; Swetnam et al.
1999; Egan & Howell 2001; Friederici 2003). Many studies
have been conducted to reconstruct pre-settlement ﬁre
regimes prior to the beginning of settlement in this region
(1870s–1890s) based on ﬁre scar and forest structural
and dendrochronological evidence (e.g., Swetnam 1990;
Covington & Moore 1994; Fule´ et al. 1997, 2002; Mast
et al. 1999; Moore et al. 1999; Swetnam et al. 1999; Groven
et al. 2002). Still, the Southwest is characterized by a great
diversity of landscapes and ecosystems (Morgan et al.
1994; White & Walker 1997; Landres et al. 1999), whereas
the number and type of sites amenable to pre-settlement
reconstruction are limited.
One such set of sites in Arizona and New Mexico dates
back to the early days of the U.S. Forest Service (USFS).
The oldest permanent forest inventory system in the
Southwest was established by the USFS Southwestern
Forest and Range Experiment Station beginning in 1909.
These plots, known locally as the Woolsey plots, were part
of a silvicultural experiment concerning regeneration and
volume accretion of southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus
ponderosa var. scopulorum P. & C. Lawson) after initial
timber harvests (Woolsey 1912; Pearson 1923, 1933;
Krauch 1926; Moore et al. 2004).
The wealth of contemporary and historical data associ-
ated with the Woolsey plots provides unique opportunities
for assessing reference conditions as well as changes that
have occurred in southwestern ponderosa pine forest
ecosystems since plot establishment (Moore et al. 2004).
Speciﬁcally, these plots offer a complementary approach
to traditional methods for establishing pre-settlement eco-
system structure and/or process. Traditional methods have
relied on currently available evidence of live and dead
trees, which is particularly problematic when reconstruct-
ing populations of small trees or applying techniques over
long periods of time (often >100 years; Johnson et al.
1994). Historical plots can reduce such uncertainty by pro-
viding actual historical inventory data as well as shorten-
ing the reconstruction time span (White & Walker 1997).
Other early forest inventories, such as those originally
established by T. T. Munger in 1910, have proven vital in

understanding old-growth forest structure and patterns of
mortality in the Paciﬁc Northwest (Duncan 2004).
However, the concept of randomization was not pro-
posed by Sir Ronald Fisher (1925) until after the Wool-
sey plots were established, and therefore, selection of
Woolsey plot locations was conducted in a nonrandom
fashion. Subjective plot selection, together with the small
sample size of this rare dataset, raises questions about
the inference space with regard to the larger, heteroge-
neous landscape of ponderosa pine forests in northern
Arizona.
Assessing representativeness in ecological studies may
be strengthened by jointly analyzing relevant variables
from independent datasets through multivariate techni-
ques (Sætersdal & Birks 1993). Large, representative
inventories conducted independently of the sample of
interest may be assumed to supply environmental and
contemporary forest structure information for the popula-
tion from which that sample was taken (Couteron et al.
2003). Two large inventories in Arizona provide important
information about environment and forest condition: the
USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis (FSFIA) and the
Arizona State Land Department Continuous Forest In-
ventory (AZCFI). The FSFIA program in northern Arizona
is conducted by the USFS Interior West Forest Inventory
and Analysis Program on both public and private lands,
whereas the AZCFI is conducted by the Arizona State
Lands Department (ASLD) on State lands.
Assessing representativeness may prove challenging
after years of intense and diverse land use (Covington &
Moore 1994; Fule´ et al. 1997; Allen et al. 1998, 2002).
Nevertheless, ecological classiﬁcation systems (Bailey
1996; Pregitzer et al. 2001) may help us recreate the distri-
bution of ecosystems in pre-settlement landscapes (Bell
et al. 1997), thus adding an important piece of information
to the assessment of this region’s historical range of
variability (Morgan et al. 1994; Allen et al. 1998, 2002;
Landres et al. 1999). An ecological classiﬁcation system is
a method of assigning areas of land to map units charac-
terized by common factors such as soils, climate, topogra-
phy, and potential vegetation (Cleland et al. 1997; Kerns
et al. 2003). For practical purposes, these units may be
assumed to remain constant at spatial scales comprising
an ecoregion over roughly one century. It is important to
emphasize that these classiﬁcations are based on the con-
cept of potential or climax vegetation, even though at
certain points in time units may be occupied by other
vegetation successional stages caused by disturbances
(Demarchi 1996). For example, the Terrestrial Ecosystem
Survey (the ecosystem classiﬁcation system used by the
USFS Southwestern Region [region 3]) classiﬁes the land-
scape into ecological units based on climate, topography,
soils, and vegetation at a mapping scale of 1:24,000 (USDA
1986; Miller et al. 1994; Ganey & Benoit 2002). Therefore,
these classiﬁcation systems provide an appealing means of
identifying inherent environmental and potential vegeta-
tion similarities among areas regardless of their current
vegetation structure and composition (Archambault et al.
1990; Palik et al. 2000; Goebel et al. 2001; Abella 2005).
Deﬁning the forestlands to which information from the
Woolsey plots can be applied is a priority because of the
unique opportunities these data offer. For instance, we are
interested in assessing the ecological pre-settlement simi-
larities between target areas and sites used to derive re-
ference conditions for guiding restoration management.
However, historical forest structural data available on
the Woolsey plots are missing on other areas. Neverthe-
less, as mentioned above, environmental conditions may
be assumed to have either remained constant or changed
equally across this ecoregion over the period that has
elapsed since plot establishment. Thus, assessing environ-
mental as well as contemporary forest structural similari-
ties between the Woolsey plots and other populations is
essential to understanding the environmental and man-
agement inﬂuences under which forest structure has
developed on these historical plots as well as on nearby
populations (Mackey et al. 1988; Neyland et al. 2000). This
information would, in turn, allow us to assess applicability
of results obtained from the Woolsey plots to those popu-
lations. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to (1)
develop a framework for assessing representativeness of
historical forest inventory plots and (2) implement this
framework on a series of forest inventory plots in northern
Arizona. Speciﬁcally, we hypothesize that the forest struc-
ture on the Woolsey plots would be similar to, and thus
representative of, other ponderosa pine forests with simi-
lar environmental conditions and management regimes.
Methods
Study Area
The spatial extent of the three forest inventories used in
this study is shown in Figure 1, which overlap within the
Coconino Plateau Coniferous Forest and the San Fran-
cisco Peaks Coniferous Forest ecological subsections of
the National Hierarchical Framework of Ecological Units
(Cleland et al. 1997; W. Robbie 2005, USFS, personal
communication). These ecological subsections have simi-
lar (but not identical) subregional climatic regimes, geo-
morphic processes, surﬁcial geology, and lithology. The
Woolsey plots were composed of either pure ponderosa
pine or ponderosa pine/Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii
Nutt.). The majority of FSFIA and AZCFI plots were
pure ponderosa pine (69.2 and 78.6%, respectively), where-
as the Woolsey plots were evenly divided between pure
ponderosa pine and ponderosa pine/Gambel oak. All plots
were used regardless of the presence of Gambel oak. To
match the overstory composition of the Woolsey plots,
FSFIA and AZCFI plots from the upper- and lower-
elevation ecotones (adjacent to pin˜on/juniper and mixed-
conifer forests) were not included. Under these geographical
and compositional limitations, 14 Woolsey, 58 FSFIA, and
98 AZCFI plots were selected and compared.

Analytical Framework
When both environmental characteristics and contempo-
rary forest structure of the Woolsey sample were typical
of the population of interest, that sample would be consid-
ered representative both historically and contemporarily.
In cases where both were atypical, the sample would be
considered unrepresentative at both points in time. If typi-
cal environment and atypical forest structure were found,
samples would be considered historically representative,
and the contemporary differences in forest structure attri-
buted to the inﬂuence of different management regimes.
Finally, in cases where atypical environment and typical
forest structure characterized the sample, we would specu-
late that contemporary representativeness resulted from
management practices that have counteracted environ-
mental inﬂuences.
Data Collection
Remeasurement of subplots (1.01 ha) within the original
Woolsey permanent plots took place between 1997 and
2003 and included all trees at least 1.37 m in height
(Moore et al. 2004). The FSFIA plots were made up of
four clustered subplots equivalent to one plot of 0.1667 ha
in size (O’Brien 2002; Van Deusen 2004) and included
measurements on trees at least 2.54 cm diameter. The last
periodic inventory of FSFIA plots in Arizona occurred
from 1995 to 1999 (O‘Brien 2002), and data were available
online through the National FIA Data Base System
(http://www.ﬁa.fs.fed.us/tools-data/data). The AZCFI plots
(0.0404-ha circular plots) were last measured between
1990 and 1994 (K. Pajkos 2005, ASLD, personal commu-
nication). The following variables from those inventories
were used in this study: elevation, site index (SI), terres-
trial ecosystem unit (TEU), and live tree diameter at
breast height (dbh; 1.37 m). Trees per hectare (TPH),
basal area per hectare (BA), quadratic mean diameter
(QMD), and frequency of dbh classes per hectare (dbh
distributions) were calculated from each of the three
forest inventories and used to characterize overstory
forest structure. Because of lack of information about
small-diameter trees (<13.97 cm) on AZCFI plots, per
hectare estimates were computed for trees less than 15 cm
(TPH0–15, BA0–15, and QMD0–15) and greater than or equal
to 15 cm (TPH151, BA151, and QMD151) so that AZCFI
plots could be compared directly with FSFIA and Woolsey
plots. All measures of forest structure reported in this study
represent estimates for ponderosa pine greater than or
equal to 2.54 cm dbh. Gambel oak were not included in the
estimation of forest structure because measurement and
reporting of tree diameters for this species were not consis-
tent across inventories. Thus, comparisons in this study
involve only ponderosa pine, the dominant tree species at
all sites being examined.
Analyses
To compare environmental and forest structural data from
the three inventories across the entire study area, we
applied a distance-based multivariate nonparametric per-
mutation method (Anderson 2001; McArdle & Anderson
2001). This method may be classiﬁed as a permutation test
and does not rely on the traditional assumptions for linear
models. We used the program DISTLM, version 5, to carry
out calculations. Euclidean distances standardized by the
range of each variable were used as a measure of dissimilar-
ity between plots (Legendre & Legendre 1998). We con-
ducted permutation tests with inventory (FSFIA, AZCFI,
or Woolsey) as the factor. We performed separate tests
for small-dbh trees (TPH0–15, BA0–15, and QMD0–15), large-
dbh trees (TPH151, BA151, and QMD151), and environ-
mental variables (elevation, SI100, and TEU).
We evaluated equality of variances using the ratio of
sample variances (s2
1=s2
2; Ott & Longnecker 2001) for
TPH0–15, TPH151, BA0–15, BA151, QMD0–15, QMD151,
elevation, and SI100. We used the Kolmogorov–Smirnov
two-sample test to compare distributions of elevation,
SI100,
TPH0–15,
TPH151,
BA0–15,
BA151,
QMD0–15,
QMD151, and dbh distributions for the three forest inven-
tories. The dbh distributions for each inventory were plot-
ted for visual inspection.

Additionally, we constructed a discriminant plot to
examine the effect of environment and forest structure on
the three inventories (Brown & Wicker 2000). For this
analysis, we used the CANPLOT version 1.3 macro
(Friendly 2003) developed for the statistical software
package SAS 8.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., 2000). Forest inven-
tory (FSFIA, AZCFI, or Woolsey) was used as the group-
ing variable, whereas three discriminator variables were
chosen to account for either environment (SI100 and
TEU) or forest structure (BA151).
We carried out additional comparisons between inven-
tories within TEUs where Woolsey plots were located.
For this purpose, we used multivariate permutation tests
to examine small-dbh trees (TPH0–15, BA0–15, and QMD0–15)
and large-dbh trees (TPH151, BA151, and QMD151). We
examined s2
1=s2
2 within each TEU with regard to the forest
structural variables listed above. We also plotted dbh dis-
tributions and applied Kolmogorov–Smirnov two-sample
tests within each TEU.
The Woolsey plots are represented in three TEUs: 551,
582, and 585. All three TEUs are dominated by ponderosa
pine. TEU 551 is characterized by both ponderosa pine
and Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica), whereas 582 and
585 typically contain Gambel oak. TEU 551 has relatively
deep soils derived from mixed igneous and alluvium, and
soils in 582 and 585 developed from residuum, basalts, and
cinders. The primary difference between 582 and 585 is
that the latter has generally shallower soils. These three
TEUs account for 112,902 ha, which represents approxi-
mately 17% of the study area. Some AZCFI plots also fall
into TEUs 582 and 585, but none are found in 551 due to
lack of ASLD ownership in that TEU. To compare forest
structural conditions within similar environments, we used
FSFIA and AZCFI plots located in TEUs 551, 582, and
585. The number of plots within each TEU is as follows:
(1) TEU 551: 3 Woolsey, 2 FSFIA, and no AZCFI; (2)
TEU 582: 5 Woolsey, 9 FSFIA, and 28 AZCFI; and (3)
TEU 585: 6 Woolsey, 9 FSFIA, and 5 AZCFI.
We set the probability of type I error (a) at 0.05 for all
tests in this study, except where multiple contrasts be-
tween each inventory were carried out. In the latter
situation, we used a Bonferroni correction (a ¼ 0.0167;
Ott & Longnecker 2001).
Results
Analysis across the Entire Study Area
Table 1 displays the results from the multivariate permuta-
tion tests that compared environment and contemporary
forest structure among inventories. Forest density means
for Woolsey tended to be greater than FSFIA and AZCFI
(Fig. 2). No clear differences in mean tree size were found.
The environment between FSFIA and AZCFI was signiﬁ-
cantly different (p ¼ 0.0074).
Sample variances for Woolsey were generally not differ-
ent from the other two inventories, although exceptions
occurred. FSFIA and Woolsey sample variances were sig-
niﬁcantly different for TPH0–15 and QMD0–15, resulting in
s2
1=s2
2 of 0.21 and 0.03, respectively. AZCFI and Woolsey
sample variances were signiﬁcantly different for QMD151,
resulting in s2
1=s2
2 of 0.21. FSFIA and AZCFI sample vari-
ances were signiﬁcantly different for TPH151, QMD151,
and elevation with s2
1=s2
2 of 0.51, 0.51, and 3.03, respectively.
Mean elevation of Woolsey (2,242 m) was greater than
that of FSFIA (2,180 m) and AZCFI (2,182 m). Woolsey
also had lower mean SI100 (19.5 m) than FSFIA (21.3 m)
and AZCFI (23.6 m). Examination of environmental and
forest structural distributions (Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests)
revealed
environmental
and
structural
differences
between the Woolsey and the other two inventories for
elevation, BA, and dbh distribution (Table 2). Statisti-
cally signiﬁcant differences were also noted between
AZCFI and Woolsey for SI100.
The average 5-cm dbh distributions for all inventories
exhibited a reverse exponential trend (Fig. 3). The average
Woolsey dbh distribution showed more TPH for most
dbh classes than the other inventories. The Kolmogorov–
Smirnov two-sample tests indicated differences between
Woolsey and FSFIA for distributions including all dbh as
well as dbh less than 15 cm and also marginal differences
between Woolsey and AZCFI for distributions including
dbh 15 cm and greater (Table 2).
Discriminant analysis indicated that differences be-
tween the three inventories were driven by both environ-
ment and forest structure (Fig. 4). FSFIA and AZCFI
shared similar space in the canonical discriminant struc-
ture plot, but Woolsey was located to the right of the cen-
ters of the other two inventories and also appeared more
variable. All analyses indicated dissimilarity between
FSFIA and AZCFI with respect to Woolsey.
Analysis of Environmentally Similar Plots
(within the Same TEU)
No statistically signiﬁcant differences in forest structure
were noted between the Woolsey and the other two inven-
tories; however, practical differences were present for
TPH0–15, TPH151, BA0–15, and BA151 in all three TEUs
(Fig. 5). Differences in TPH151 and BA151 were relatively
small, but Woolsey was still consistently denser. QMD0–15
and QMD151 showed little differences between Woolsey

means and either FSFIA or AZCFI means except in TEU
551 where the Woolsey mean for QMD0–15 was 8.1 cm
greater than the mean for FSFIA. Although not statisti-
cally tested in this study, there appeared to be clear differ-
ences in forest structure by TEU. When comparing means
for a single inventory across the three TEUs, TPH0–15,
BA0–15, TPH151, and BA151 tended to be highest in 585,
moderate in 582, and lowest in 551 (Fig. 5). In TEU 551,
mean QMD151 was the highest, whereas QMD0–15 was
the lowest of these three TEUs.
Based on the comparison of sample variances within
each TEU, the three inventories are relatively similar,
with the exception of QMD. For TEU 551, ratios were
generally close to 1.0, with the exception of TPH0–15,
BA0–15, and QMD0–15 s2
1=s2
2, which could not be calculated
due to the lack of trees smaller than 15 cm dbh in the
three FSFIA plots. For TEU 582, FSFIA sample variance
was signiﬁcantly larger than Woolsey in terms of QMD0–15
(s2
1=s2
2 ¼ 0.04). For TEU 585, FSFIA sample variances
were signiﬁcantly larger than those found for Woolsey
plots in terms of QMD0–15 and QMD151 with s2
1=s2
2 of 0.02
and 0.13, respectively. No statistically signiﬁcant differen-
ces were found between AZCFI and Woolsey, except for
TPH151 in TEU 582 with s2
1=s2
2 equal to 0.21.
Average 5-cm dbh distributions in the same TEU
(Fig. 3) showed that most differences between the Wool-
sey and the other two inventories occurred in the smaller-
diameter classes (<15 cm dbh). The Kolmogorov–Smirnov
two-sample tests also showed signiﬁcant statistical differ-
ences in these small–tree diameter distributions (Table 2).
Discussion
In our speciﬁc case, environmental and forest structural
data showed lack of representativeness of the Woolsey
plots with respect to both FSFIA and AZCFI inventories
across the entire study area. Our results indicate that the
Woolsey plots have atypical environmental conditions and
current forest structure and, therefore, cannot be consid-
ered representative of either historical or contemporary
conditions of the population encompassing the entire area
analyzed in this study.
However, given that TEUs intrinsically represent areas
of similar environmental conditions, we can presume that
the Woolsey plots may be deemed historically representa-
tive of forested lands within the three TEUs to which
these plots belong. In addition, comparison of the three
contemporary inventories for trees greater than or equal

to 15 cm dbh within the same TEU shows that the Woolsey
plots have moderately higher tree frequency and basal
area, especially for trees greater than or equal to 40 cm
dbh. Although these differences indicate lack of contem-
porary representativeness, land use history may help
explain this phenomenon. The Woolsey plots experienced
initial selection harvests between 1894 and 1913 similar to
the surrounding ponderosa pine forests (Pearson 1923).
However, these historical plots were subsequently either
unharvested or thinned more lightly than other forested
lands outside those plots. This difference in management
is a plausible explanation for the higher large-tree densi-
ties currently observed on the Woolsey plots (Sa´nchez
Meador 2006).
Differences in within-TEU forest structure between the
Woolsey plots and the other two inventories were also
found in small-diameter trees (<15 cm), further indicating
lack of contemporary representativeness of the Woolsey
plots. However, it is feasible that these differences resulted
from an artifact caused by livestock grazing in the early
1900s (Foster et al. 2003) on and off the Woolsey plots. The
Woolsey plots were fenced at establishment, causing re-
duced browsing and trampling damage from livestock. This
reduced grazing pressure likely increased seedling height
growth and survival rates (Hill 1917) and may have been
enough to promote the contemporary denser small-tree
conditions on the Woolsey plots (Bakker 2005; Bakker &
Moore 2007). Thus, information gathered or reconstructed
from the Woolsey plots may be considered representative
of its corresponding TEU until plot establishment (1909–
1913), when distinct harvesting and grazing schemes began
on and off these plots.

Differences in sample design further challenge inter-
preting the results from this study. Plots of different sizes
are expected to capture a dissimilar portion of the in-
herent forest variability. A single AZCFI plot covering
0.0404 ha or even the combined FSFIA subplots of
0.1667 ha are unlikely to consistently include openings,
small-diameter thickets, and old-growth clumps. How-
ever, a 1.01-ha Woolsey plot may encompass all these
components several times over. As expected, the effect
of plot size was reﬂected in greater sample variances
observed for both FSFIA and AZCFI plots. Nevertheless,
the relatively large, representative samples for FSFIA and
AZCFI inventories still likely allow for an accurate and
precise estimation of the population characteristics.
Assessment of pre-settlement forest conditions as well
as ecosystem change since Euro-American settlement are
important in guiding restoration management in south-
western ponderosa pine forests. However, because the
Woolsey plots are only represented on a limited number
of TEUs, it would be important to assess how results from
these plots might be applied to other TEUs that were
not represented. For instance, mapping units could be
grouped based on common characteristics correlated with
forest structure (i.e., soil depth, parent material, and SI).
Developing coefﬁcients to modify estimates of historical
structure based on ecological classiﬁcations could prove
useful as well. Although the degree to which results from
the Woolsey plots apply to other similar TEUs is yet to be
assessed, information obtained from similar ecological
units should be preferred for assessing changes over time
and applying restoration treatments. Finally, in relation to
temporal trends, information gathered or reconstructed
from these plots may be considered representative of its
corresponding TEU until plot establishment, when fenc-
ing and distinct harvesting schemes began. From that
point forward, the effect of those different management
approaches would have to be successfully modeled to
claim representativeness even within the same TEU.
Thus, the use of ecological classiﬁcation systems should be
tempered by knowledge of human activity at the site of
interest and in the surrounding ecosystems.
Successful ecosystem restoration will depend on adapt-
ing pre-settlement reference-condition information into
management prescriptions that also pursue other objectives
such as wildlife, range, recreation, and timber. However,
translating results from historical forest plots into forest
management prescriptions may face additional challenges
because forestry operations are often applied to stands
whose boundaries may not match ecological classiﬁcation
delineations.

Assessing Representativeness of Inventory Plots

Implications for Practice
d Historical permanent plot data can provide unique
opportunities to reconstruct pre-settlement reference
conditions, as well as detect and quantify changes in
vegetation structure and composition on a site.
d However, plot data collected from the early 1900s
were often located subjectively, and therefore, the
practitioner should determine the representativeness
of historical data before using it to guide manage-
ment or restoration activities.
d Regional forest inventories offer an excellent tool for
determining the applicability of reference conditions
developed at one site to another.
d The application of information derived from historical
forest inventory plots can be guided by ecological clas-
siﬁcation systems, such as the TEUs in the Southwest.
d To use information pertaining to historical conditions
at one site to inform restoration objectives or prescrip-
tions at another, careful consideration of management
history is needed because contemporary structural dif-
ferences between sites may be due to land use history
rather than ecological characteristics.
