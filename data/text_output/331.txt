Comparing Classiﬁcation Systems for Ponderosa
Pine Snags in Northern Arizona
Justin D. Waskiewicz, Peter Z. Fule´, and Paul Beier
The degree to which snag classiﬁcation systems predict actual snag “age” (time since tree death) is rarely known. We used dendrochronology to determine
the death dates of 79 large (more than 40 cm dbh, more than 3 m in height) ponderosa pine snags in northern Arizona and compared the snag ages to those
predicted by a commonly used simulation model and to ﬁve classiﬁcation systems. The methods are limited to trees for which intact tree-ring samples could
be extracted, but the data provided evidence of some snags standing for long periods (to 141 years) and correlation of snag traits with age. The simulation
model underestimated snag age in the ﬁrst three categories. Mean ages of snags in the last category were estimated accurately but with low precision.
Comparison of snag ages to their classiﬁcation in ﬁve systems showed that bole breakage was unrelated to snag age, that limb loss occurs at divergent rates
between individual trees, and that wood decay does not necessarily proceed sequentially. A system based on the attrition of bark from snag boles proved useful
for distinguishing snags by physical traits, but different classiﬁcation systems may be needed to meet speciﬁc needs for assessing past forest structure and wildlife
habitat.

T
rees that remain standing after death are called snags. Snags
have long been of interest to forest managers as ﬁre hazards
and estimators of past mortality (Pearson 1939). The im-
portant role of snags in forest ecology has been the subject of in-
creasing study since the 1970s (Neitro et al. 1985). In the ponderosa
pine forests of northern Arizona, cavity nesting species may consti-
tute over one-third of total bird diversity in ponderosa pine forests,
and their populations are signiﬁcantly correlated with snag densities
(Morrison et al. 1987). Individual snags in the same stand, even of
the same species and size, differ in terms of wood quality, bark and
limb retention, and bole integrity. Different characteristics support
different ecological roles. For example, soft (rotten) snags are heavily
used for nesting and foraging (Thomas et al. 1979, Cunningham et
al. 1980, Raphael and White 1984), and hard (fresh) snags are used
by bark gleaners and some stronger-billed primary cavity nesters (Man-
nan et al. 1980). The attributes of a snag population thus determine
what wildlife species it is capable of supporting. Snag characteristics also
can be important for diverse management issues such as ﬁre hazard
(rottenwoodismoreeasilyignited),publicsafety(snagsfallingonroads
or campgrounds), or developing guidelines for forest restoration
(Holden et al. 2006). Large-diameter snags tend to persist longer than
smaller snags (Keen 1929, 1955, Chambers and Mast 2005).
Many snag characteristics roughly correlate with snag age.
Snags lose needles, twigs, branches, bark, and, eventually, sec-
tions of bole over time. A number of systems have been devised to
classify snags by their level of decay, based on observations of
bark cover, twig and limb retention, wood quality, or some com-
bination (e.g., Keen [1955], Scott [1978], Cline et al. [1980],
Raphael and White [1984], Horton and Mannan [1988],
Boucher et al. [1999]). The categories of such classiﬁcation sys-
tems are designed to reﬂect important stages in the deterioration
of a typical snag over time. To the extent that a system’s category
sequence correlates with snag age, it can be used to estimate past
mortality events as well as predict future habitat quality (Neitro
et al. 1985). A system developed by Thomas et al. (1979), de-
scribed more fully later in this article, has been particularly in-
ﬂuential in the Southwest because it was incorporated into re-
source management guidelines and a commonly used ecological
simulation model (Ecosim; Rogers et al. [1984]).
Despite the importance of understanding how long snags have
been standing, the relationship between snag characteristics and age
has been quantiﬁed rarely. In the Southwest, short-term (less than
30 years) snag dynamics after bark beetle kill (Keen 1955) or wildﬁre
(Chambers and Mast 2005, Holden et al. 2006, Passovoy and Fule´
2006) have been assessed with longitudinal studies, but longer pre-
dictions are based on unevaluated estimates because of the difﬁculty
of tracking snags for decades to centuries. We applied dendrochro-
nological techniques to determine exact death dates of large pon-
derosa pine snags. Our objectives were to (1) compare snag age
predictions from a commonly used simulation model with actual
ages, (2) assess the accuracy and precision of the Thomas et al.
(1979) and four other systems, and (3) draw inferences about indi-
vidual and stand-level snag dynamics by examining the current de-
mographics and age distribution.

ABSTRACT

(latitude 36°22N and longitude 113°7W). Elevations ranged from
about 2,000 to 2,300 m, with volcanic soils. Two remote automated
weather stations (RAWS) are in the area: precipitation averaged 430
mm annually between 1992 and 2005 (Nixon Flats RAWS) and
326 mm annually between 1985 and 2005 (Mount Logan RAWS).
The area experienced frequent surface ﬁres before about 1870, when
grazing, logging, and ﬁre suppression altered the natural structure
and disturbance regime, leading to the high tree densities and fuel
loads now typical of southwestern forests (Moore et al. 1999).
In 1999 we measured the diameter and height of all snags that
were 40 cm or more dbh and 3 m in height on six 36-ha plots
distributed across the Mount Trumbull forest. Fallen trees were not
sampled. We chose trees larger than 40 cm dbh because they are of
high management value for wildlife habitat (Thomas et al. 1979,
Raphael and Morrison 1987, Rabe et al. 1998) and represent a
minimum size for old-growth forest structure (Mast et al. 1999). A
single observer assigned each snag to one category in each of ﬁve
classiﬁcation systems (Table 1):
1.
Thomas et al. (1979) developed a nine-stage classiﬁcation sys-
tem for the Blue Mountains of Oregon. The system covers
changes from live tree to stump. It has been cited frequently
and was reproduced in a textbook (Hunter 1990). The Na-
tional Park Service uses the Thomas system, with slight mod-
iﬁcation, to describe trees in its ﬁre monitoring protocol
(USDI National Park Service 2001, 95). These modiﬁcations
designate Thomas’s class 6 (“broken”) as “broken above breast
height,” and Thomas’s class 7 (“decayed”) as “broken below
breast height.” Because no snags less than 3 m in height were
measured in this study, we assigned no snags to classes greater
than 6. From here onward, when a condition class is men-
tioned without referring to a speciﬁc classiﬁcation system, the
Thomas et al. (1979) system is assumed.
2.
The decay system is based on a number of features, described in
Table 1. It is purposely ﬂexible and subjective. We created it
based on the systems of Keen (1955), Thomas et al. (1979),
and Raphael and Morrison (1987) and on personal observa-
tions in southwestern ponderosa pine forests.
3.
Bark is exposed to weathering all around a snag’s bole. The
percentage of bark cover remaining on a snag is commonly
used as an indicator of both age and potential wildlife use
(Dahms 1949, Scott 1978, Cunningham et al. 1980). Follow-
ing Dahms (1949) for ponderosa pine in the Paciﬁc North-
west, the idea is that bark loss does not begin until bark cover
is ﬁrst breached, possibly several years after tree death, and that
the last scraps of bark may remain long after the vast majority
is gone. Therefore, the bark classiﬁcation system classiﬁes 0
and 100% loss separately, because they may represent more
important stages than any arbitrary divisions between them.
4.
Limbs are an obvious indicator of decay, because their diame-
ter and, therefore, their resistance to breakage increases toward
the bole. It should take more time for increasingly larger limbs
to soften and break.
5.
Wood was expected to rot progressively from the outside of a
snag inward (Cline et al. 1980) at a rate of radial penetration
unaffected by snag size (Basham and Belyea 1960). We chose
the divisions of wood classes 1–4 based on personal observa-
tions of ponderosa pine decay. We added class 5 to include
those snags that, although obviously advanced in age, did not
appear to be softening. Cunningham et al. (1980) called these
“hard snags” and attributed their resistance to high pitch con-
tent. We added class 6 to include snags that have been charred
by ﬁre (Boucher et al.’s [1999] “type III” snags). Classes 4, 5,
and 6 are not necessarily sequential.
We attempted to extract an increment core from each snag and,
for successful extractions, cored a similar-sized live tree in close
proximity (Scott 1978). To ensure that cores captured the last year
of each snag’s life, we sampled from wood still covered by bark,
bearing bark beetle galleries (indicating the surface nearest the cam-
bium), or otherwise identiﬁable as the outermost extent of the tree’s
growth (Stokes and Smiley 1968). We cross-dated cores using pre-
viously established tree-ring chronologies and by comparison to
adjacent live tree cores (Stokes and Smiley 1968). We measured
tree-ring widths and used the program COFECHA (Grissino-
Mayer and Holmes 1993) for quality control of cross-dating. We
assigned death dates to snags as the last year of growth recorded in
the core and we calculated snag ages by subtracting the death date
from the year of sample collection, 1999.
We produced death date estimates for Mount Trumbull snags
using Ecosim equations (Rogers et al. 1984). Rogers et al. (1984)
presented snag change rates to describe the movement from one
snag class to the next, using the Thomas et al. (1979) system. For
example, 20% of the snags in condition class 3 were projected to
move to condition class 4 annually. To determine when the “aver-
age” or 50th percentile tree had moved to the next class, we solved
the interest rate equation Vn  V0 (1  i)n where V0 is the initial
quantity (100%), Vn is the quantity at year n, and i is the rate.
Setting Vn to 0.5 (50%) and i to 0.20, solving for n gives ln Vn 
ln V0 /ln(1  0.2)  3.8 years. The decay rates were diameter

independent, except for movement into the ﬁnal snag condition
class. Calculations were made for the 50th percentile or “average”
tree, as well as the 25th and 75th percentile, representing rapidly
changing and slowly changing conditions, respectively. Predicted
snag ages were compared with the quartiles (25, 50, and 75%) of the
measured snag ages in each class. The percentiles and quartiles es-
sentially are the same thing, viz., dividing a continuous population
at the breakpoints of 25, 50, and 75%. For clarity, we used “percen-
tile,” to describe the solution of the snag equations, versus “quar-
tile,” to describe dividing the measured population of snag ages.
Results and Discussion
Population Characteristics
We recorded data on 198 dead trees in the six plots. Of these, we
successfully extracted cores from 125 (63% of snags) and conﬁrmed
79 death dates (40% of snags; 63% of cores). The dated subset of
snags did not signiﬁcantly differ in size from the larger sample as a
whole (61.2 cm dbh versus 61.7 cm dbh, P  0.786; 15.2 m in
height versus 13.6 m in height, P  0.064; independent samples
t-test). There were, however, signiﬁcantly fewer (29% versus 38%;
P  0.001; chi-square test) broken snags in the dated subset (a likely
reason for the slight difference in average height).
Failure to obtain death date data for any individual snag was a
function of two factors: inability to extract a core, usually because of
excessive rot, and inability to successfully cross-date the core, usually
because of ring complacency. Higher-category snags were less likely
to be cored successfully, with cores extracted from 84, 74, 56, and
47% of snags in categories 3–6, respectively. No such trend oc-
curred for successful cross-dating across the categories, although
cross-dating did differ among the categories (59, 55, 93, and 64%).
The net result was that categories 3 and 5 were overrepresented in
the subsample of snag ages, whereas category 6 was underrepre-
sented. Each dated snag in category 3 represented 2 in the full
sample, each category 4 represented 2.5, each category 5 represented
2, and each category 6 represented 3.3.
Older and broken snags are more likely to be rotten (McClelland
and Frissel 1975) and therefore were less likely to be cored success-
fully. Sample bias against snags on more moist sites is a possibility,
because such snags would be more likely to be rotten (bias against
successful core extraction) and also more likely to display compla-
cent rings (bias against successful cross-dating).
Distribution
Dated snags ranged in age from 1 to 141 years old, averaging 36
years (Figure 1). The age distribution showed a gradual decline in
number across decadal age class, with no outstanding peaks or val-
leys apparent. The extreme age reached by some snags and the rel-
ative ﬂatness of the age distribution suggest that ponderosa pine
snags decay very slowly, and, at least in the absence of ﬁre, some may
persist for up to 150 years. The distribution was inﬂuenced by both
previous mortality (snag recruitment) and by the snag fall rate; it is
impossible to estimate the share of inﬂuence between those two
factors. Past management practices, including harvesting, which
might have captured potential mortality, and snag cutting have
undoubtedly affected the snag population distribution. Given also
that mortality of large ponderosa pine over the last 100 years has
more likely risen than fallen (Biondi 1996, Mast et al. 1999), it is
possible that the degree of negative slope in the age distribution owes
as much to increasing trends in recruitment and decreasing trends in
removal as to natural snag attrition.
Snag Age Prediction
Comparing predicted versus actual snag ages, estimated death
dates for the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles in each category were
all later calendar dates (i.e., younger snag age dates) than the actual
ﬁrst, second, and third age quartiles for snags in categories 3–5
(Table 2). For category 6, we predicted a range of death dates cov-
ering the range of category 6 snag diameters. The second and third
age quartiles of category 6 snags ﬁt within the ranges predicted by
the model’s corresponding percentiles.

On a snag-by-snag basis, the disparity between model-predicted
death dates and actual death dates was large and negative for cate-
gories 3–5 in all percentiles (Table 3). The model consistently over-
estimated snag death dates (underestimated snag age) in these
categories—not one estimated death date was earlier than an actual
death date. In category 6, estimated death dates fell on both sides of
actual dates, and the average disparity between the two for the 50th
percentile estimates was relatively near zero (8.4 years). However,
the SD of the disparities is large (26.5 years)—the model’s 50th
percentile death date estimation may be accurate over a large num-
ber but is very imprecise. Using the 25th percentile, the model
tended to underestimate category 6 death dates and to overestimate
them using the 75th percentile. Although the estimates of category
6 death dates using the 50th percentile averaged similar to the actual
death date average, there was no correlation between actual death
dates per tree and the estimates (R2  0.02). The net quality of our
predictions of death date based on the Thomas classiﬁcation system
ranged from accurate (4-year average difference) but very impre-
cise (46.8-year SD) when using the 25th percentile (where under-
estimation of category 6 death dates compensated for overestima-
tion of other death dates) to inaccurate (29-year average differ-
ence) and imprecise (29.9-year SD) when using the 75th percentile.
Given high imprecision, the model would be of little use to
estimate the death date of individual trees. At least at Mount Trum-
bull, large unbroken ponderosa pine snags change more slowly than
the model predicts, and large broken ones are less likely to be as old
as the model presupposes. The model is more suitable for estimating
mortality patterns over large study areas, using many snags, at least
if the ratio of broken and unbroken snags is similar to that at Mount
Trumbull. A number of forest reconstruction studies in northern
Arizona have used the Rogers et al. (1984) model in this way (e.g.,
Covington and Moore [1994] and Moore et al. [2004]).
Comparing Classiﬁcation Systems
The average age of snags in each category of all of the systems
typically increased with advancing categories, except for several “re-
versals” in the last category (Table 4). This result conforms to ex-
pectations because the classiﬁcation systems were designed to mirror
typical decay patterns. The increasing ranges associated with con-
secutive categories were an inevitable result from the difference be-
tween fast- and slow-deteriorating snags. This is bound to happen in
any system, but an ideal system would be based on characteristics
that change at a similar and low rate in all trees, thus minimizing the
overlap of age ranges between categories. Median within-category
ages typically were lower than means and range centers, implying
skewed distributions, with snags tending to be clustered toward the
younger end of category ranges. The number of snags classiﬁed into
each category varied between categories with no consistent pattern
across systems.
We compared snag classiﬁcation based on the following criteria.
A good classiﬁcation system should be (1) applicable and appropri-
ate, with categories that represent sequential and typical conditions;
(2) precise, with minimal age variability within categories; and (3)
objective, with minimal overlap and quantiﬁable bounds between
categories. No perfect system exists, but some are better than others.
Snags classiﬁed by Thomas et al.’s (1979) system generally con-
formed to the expected pattern. Mean and median ages both in-
creased from category 3 to 4 to 5, but the average age for category 6
snags was lower than for category 5 and not signiﬁcantly different
from that of the whole sample (P  0.86, two-sample t-test). Each

category of the Thomas system included a large range of snag ages,
with considerable overlap among the ranges of nearby categories.
The oldest snags in category 3, for example, were much older than
the youngest snags in category 4 and 6. The range of ages for cate-
gory 6 snags covered almost the whole range of all snag ages, and the
category included the largest number of snags. Category 4 also in-
cluded a wide range of snag ages, and contained more snags than
either adjacent category.
The most variable category, based on tree breakage (category 6),
may not be related to age at all. Some snags are broken even before
death, others are not broken until much later. Once a snag enters
category 6, no matter what its condition besides breakage, it remains
in that category until destroyed. Therefore, a large number of snags
accumulate in category 6 because it represents a common character-
istic, although not necessarily a sequential step in snag development.
Broken snags were more likely to be decayed: among broken snags,
8% were recent, 39% had loose bark, and 53% were clean. It can not
be determined whether this is because older snags are more likely to
break or because broken snags are less likely to fall (Neitro et al.
1985) and, therefore, more likely to get older. Breakage is an impor-
tant characteristic in describing the snag resource, because it is so
common and is related to bird use (McClelland and Frissel 1975,
Cunningham et al. 1980), but it is not helpful in estimating snag
age. Thomas et al.’s (1979) system was the least precise of those
examined in this study, with the highest average SD and some of the
broadest age ranges in its categories. The system is relatively objec-
tive, however, with little overlap between the characteristics of ad-
jacent categories and little room for differences in observer
interpretation.
Other classiﬁcation systems showed advantages and disadvan-
tages relative to the Thomas system. The decay system was more
consistent in conforming to the pattern of increasing snag age with
increasing category and the larger number of categories with lower
SDs (except for category 6) made the system a more precise estima-
tor of snag age. The decay system was more subject to the individual
observer’s interpretation of terms such as “larger” branches,
“mostly” loosened, or “very” soft—it may not be consistently ap-
plied among multiple observers. Furthermore, because classiﬁcation
is based on more than one characteristic, it may be of limited use in
predicting future snag properties (each category represents a number
of possible combinations of characteristics).
The bark system was the most precise and had the lowest average
SD of all the systems examined in this study. In the bark classiﬁca-
tion system, snags in category 3 (50–75% bark remaining) were of
younger average age than snags in the previous category, and the age
range was a nested subset of the previous category range. Likewise,
the range of snag ages in category 4 is a nested subset of the range of
category 5, while the age averages of the two categories barely differ.
Therefore, bark class 3 essentially was redundant to class 2, and class
4 was redundant to class 5. This may be because the 25% divisions
between categories were chosen for convenience, rather than biolog-
ical meaning. The low number of snags classiﬁed in categories 2 and
3 probably indicate that snags pass through these relatively
quickly—i.e., they lose the ﬁrst half of their bark faster than the last
half.
Limb category 5 snags averaged younger than the previous cate-
gory and had a median age younger than the previous two categories.
All Limb category 5 snags were broken—it is possible that breakage
rather than age caused the loss of the largest limbs, explaining the
category’s younger mean age. Otherwise, increasing Limb categories
represented generally older snags, but the Limb system had the most
age range overlap between categories; the youngest snags in the
highest Limb categories were not much older than the youngest in
the lowest categories. The oldest of all snags still retained secondary
branches, whereas snags a ﬁfth as old had already lost all their limbs.
This indicates a very wide disparity between the fastest-decaying and

slowest-decaying snags with respect to limb loss. Some snags may
lose all of their limbs in as little as 25 years, while branches may never
be lost in other snags. Limb characteristics, unlike bark, may be too
individualized to the tree—dependent on wood strength, crown
characteristics, and exposure more than time since death—to make
a good surrogate for age.
Wood categories were of relatively little value in determining
snag age. Ponderosa pine snags do not seem to follow an incremental
progression from sound wood to rotten, as shown by the near ab-
sence of snags in categories 2 and 3. Wood category 1 snags were
clearly younger than those in categories 4 and 5 and the age ranges of
categories 4 and 5 were very similar. Categories 4, 5, and 6 were not
designed to represent sequential stages in snag development. They
probably represent alternative fates for snags that depend more on
the individual wood properties and microsite history of the tree than
on time and exposure. Data from the Gila Wilderness in New Mex-
ico suggest that charred trees might persist longer than uncharred
trees (Holden et al. 2006).
Improving Snag Age Estimation
Because there are diverse reasons for classifying snags, it is not
possible to recommend a single classiﬁcation system. However, the
results of this study can be applied to suggest ways to improve
estimation methods at least in terms of the age structure of snag
populations.
Bark appears to be the best single characteristic for predicting
snag age. All trees have relatively uniform bark coverage while alive,
in contrast to considerable variation in the amount and sizes of
limbs. Bark retention also lends itself more readily to quantiﬁcation
by percent, although appropriate percent thresholds for different
categories may be hard to determine.
The Thomas et al. (1979) classiﬁcation system commonly used
in the Southwestern ponderosa pine can be improved with some
modiﬁcations: (1) category “broken above breast height” (category
6) is poorly linked to age, and breakage can be recorded separately if
it is of interest; (2) the category “recent” (category 3) is too subjective
and broad, as evidenced by the extreme age of 39 years—a snag that
still retained ﬁne twigs— and this category should include only
those snags that retain 100% of their bark; (3) “loose bark” (category
4) is too broad and it should be divided into two parts corresponding
to the progression of bark loss. A modiﬁed four-category system
would include: (1) 100% bark, (2) bark loose and more than 50%
remaining, (3) bark loose and less than 50% remaining, and (4)
“clean.” This system has steadily rising mean and median ages for its
categories, with relatively low SDs (Table 5). One anomalous snag
in category 2 had an age of 70 years, 31 years (79%) more than the
next oldest in that category. If this outlier is excluded, the modiﬁed
system is the most precise of those examined here and has the most
consistent increases in age in succeeding categories.
Finally, snag age data can be applied to infer the dynamics of
movement between categories. An estimate of snag dynamics can be
made from the demographic cross-section of the snag population at
Mount Trumbull. Using a “snapshot” age distribution to estimate
dynamics depends on the stability of the age distribution over time.
Fire and insects can create large cohorts of snags episodically, so the
ratios among current age classes are a result of past recruitment
pulses interacting with deterioration patterns in complex ways
(Johnson et al. 1994). However, the snag population at Mount
Trumbull has some advantages for modeling. The very wide range
of the snag age distribution covers over a century of potential re-
cruitment years; therefore, it should include evidence of recruitment
pulses that would have affected demographics. However, there does
not appear to be evidence of such pulses, because the distribution is
quite smooth. Thus, the category ratios in any given age class should
fairly represent how the corresponding snag cohort stratiﬁed out
over time.
We used the proportion of snags occurring in each of the four
high-accuracy categories (Table 5) in six age classes to model stand-
level snag dynamics. The age classes were 1–5 years, 6–15 years,
16–30 years, 31–50 years, 51–80 years, and 81 years. The in-
creasing span of each age class maintained a high number of snags
per class, permitting a smoother curve. For each category, we calcu-
lated the proportion of snags in each age class and then corrected
density to account for biases in the dated subset. The estimated
number of snags in each category-age combination were used to
calculate the proportion of each category per age class, connecting
the midpoints with a smooth curve (Figure 2) that shows the ap-
proximate percentage of remaining snags expected in each category
at a given time. For example, of the snags that died in 1999 and are
still standing in 2029, 1% still would be in category 1, 35% would
be in category 2, 50% would be in category 3, and 14% would be in
category 4. It is also possible to estimate the range and average age of
transition between categories. The category 1 and 2 curves cross at
about 15 years, category 2 and 3 curves cross at about 27 years, and
category 3 and 4 curves cross at about 47 years. These points repre-
sent the ages at which successive categories become dominant dur-
ing a cohort’s development and the average point at which snags
move from one category to the next.
Bearing in mind the variability already discussed, Figure 2 pro-
vides a scenario for snag change at Mount Trumbull: snags typically
retain all their bark for about 10–20 years. It takes 5–20 additional
years for the ﬁrst half of bark to fall off and 15–30 additional years
for the remainder to fall off. After 30–70 years, snags are clean of
bark.
Large ponderosa pine snags at Mount Trumbull can last for a
longtime—perhaps up to 150 years in the absence of ﬁre. This may
well be typical across the Southwest, where dry climate and ﬁre
suppression have likely enabled snag populations to reach large and

historically unprecedented levels (Boucher et al. 1999, Ganey
1999). The bark-based modiﬁcation to the Thomas et al. (1979)
classiﬁcation system developed here and its application to snag dy-
namics modeling provides a quick and relatively objective means to
assess current snag age, estimate future stand snag demographics,
and predict the development of individual ponderosa pine snags at
sites similar to Mount Trumbull. It is important to be able to do
this, because fuel reduction treatments across the Southwest would
be improved by reliable information on historical reference condi-
tions (Moore et al. 1999) and estimation of potential treatment
impacts on wildlife habitat (Tiedemann et al. 2000, Wagner et al.
2000, Block et al. 2001).
