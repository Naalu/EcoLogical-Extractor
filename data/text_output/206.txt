Abstract
Ponderosa pine forest restoration consists of thinning trees
and reintroducing prescribed fire to reduce unnaturally
high tree densities and fuel loads to restore ecosystem
structure and function. A current issue in ponderosa pine
restoration is what to do with the large quantity of slash
that is created from thinning dense forest stands. Slash
piling burning is currently the preferred method of slash
removal because it allows land managers to burn large
quantities of slash in a more controlled environment in
comparison with broadcast burning slash. However burn-
ing slash piles is known to have adverse effects such as soil
sterilization and exotic species establishment. This study
investigated the effects of slash pile burning on soil biotic
and chemical variables and early herbaceous succession on
burned slash pile areas. Slash piles were created following
tree thinning in two adjacent approximately 20-ha ponder-
osa pine (Pinus ponderosa) restoration treatments in the
Coconino National Forest near Flagstaff, Arizona. We
selected 30 burned slash pile areas and sampled across a
gradient of the burned piles for arbuscular mycorrhizal
(AM) propagule densities, the soil seed bank, and soil
chemical properties. In addition, we established five 1-m2
plots in each burned pile to quantify the effect of living soil
(AM inoculum) and seeding amendments on early
herbaceous succession in burned slash pile areas. The five
treatments consisted of a control (no treatment), living soil
(AM inoculum) amendment, sterilized soil (no AM
inoculum) amendment, seed amendment, and a seed/soil
(AM inoculum) amendment. Slash pile burning nearly
eliminated populations of viable seeds and AM propagules
and altered soil chemical properties. Amending scars with
native seeds increased the cover of native forbs and
grasses. Furthermore adding both seed and living soil more
than doubled total native plant cover and decreased
ruderal and exotic plant cover. These results indicate that
seed/soil amendments that increase native forbs and
grasses may enhance the rate of succession in burned slash
pile areas by allowing these species to outcompete exotic
and ruderal species also establishing at the site through
natural regeneration.
Key words: arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, disturbance,

Introduction
Efforts are currently underway in southwestern Pinus pon-
derosa Dougl. ex Laws. (ponderosa pine) stands to reverse
structural and functional ecosystem changes caused by
historical land management practices. Southwestern pon-
derosa pine forests before Euro-American settlement were
characterized by large old growth trees intermixed with
grassy meadows. Low-intensity fires carried by grassy
understories reoccurred every 220 years in southwestern
ponderosa pine ecosystems and played a major role in
determining the structure, composition, and stability of
these ecosystems (Cooper 1960). These frequent, low-
intensity fires, along with grass competition, restricted
ponderosa pine from regenerating and maintained the
open, park-like structure of presettlement ponderosa pine
stands. Heavy livestock grazing, intensive logging of old
growth trees, and fire suppression by Euro-American
settlement resulted in dense forests consisting of numerous
small trees along with other structural and functional
changes to the ecosystem (Covington et al. 1997). Ponder-
osa pine restoration aims to restore ecosystem diversity and
function by returning ponderosa pine forests to a more open
savannah-like structure and reintegrating the natural distur-
bance regime of fire (Covington & Moore 1994). Two major
components of this restoration effort include tree thinning
and prescribed burning. One current dilemma in forest
restoration is the disposal of slash (tree crowns, bole tips,
and small boles) because often in ponderosa pine restor-
ation treatments, large quantities of small-diameter trees
need to be removed before reintegrating fire back into the
ecosystem. Land managers commonly gather unmarketable
small-diameter trees and slash into large piles near roads

and burn them under appropriate weather conditions. Land
managers favor this method of slash removal because piles
can be safely burned under a broad range of weather
conditions (Hardy 1996).
Although slash pile scars only cover a small (approxi-
mately <1.0) percent of forest ecosystems, they are proble-
matic because they may assist the spread and establishment
of undesirable non-native and ruderal plants into the forest
interior following thinning (Dickinson & Kirkpatrick 1987).
Despite ample anecdotal evidence of detrimental effects of
slash pile scars, very few quantitative studies have assessed
these effects, and no quantitative studies have been con-
ducted to determine the methods of ameliorating them. It is
crucial to have a thorough understanding of the effects of
slash pile burning within restoration treatment areas to
determine whether this activity conflicts with restoration
goals and what methods are most effective in ameliorating
slash pile scars created during restoration treatments.
We hypothesized that severely burned slash pile scars
would have significantly reduced propagule densities of
plants and arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) fungi as well as
altered soil properties. Therefore we hypothesized that seed
and soil amendments containing viable AM propagules
would increase the establishment of native plants in
severely burned slash pile scars. Mycorrhizae form a critical
link between aboveground plants and the soil system, play-
ing an important role in plant nutrition, nutrient cycling,
and the development of soil structure (Allen 1991; Smith &
Read 1997). Numerous researchers have suggested a rela-
tionship between the recovery time of disturbed ecosystems
and the abundance of infective propagules of mycorrhizal
fungi (Allen & Allen 1980; Noyd et al. 1995; Gange et al.
1999). The severity of a disturbance can greatly influence
the abundance of AM fungi in the soil and therefore its role
in succession. Studies have shown that in severely burned
areas AM fungi colonization (Schenck et al. 1975; Pattinson
et al. 1999) and spore density and richness are reduced
(Dhillon et al. 1988; Gibson & Hetrick 1988). When AM
propagule densities are reduced the benefits of AM fungi to
host plants are not immediately available to mycotrophic
seedlings or mature plants. A recent study by Korb et al.
(2003) showed that AM densities increase following restora-
tion thinning treatments in ponderosa pine forests, which
suggests that historically, AM fungi may have played an
important role in the herbaceous community structure and
function before Euro-American settlement.
The specific objectives of this study were to: (1) deter-
mine the effect of slash pile burning on densities of viable
plant and AM fungal propagules and soil properties; and
(2) determine the effect of amelioration treatments on
herbaceous
plant
establishment
within
burned
slash
pile scars. We found that burning slash eradicates plant
and AM fungal propagules and alters soil properties and
that amending fire scars with native seed in conjunction
with living soil increases the re-establishment of native
herbaceous plant species richness and cover in comparison
with other amendment treatments.
Methods
Experimental Site and Design
This research was conducted in 2000 and 2001 on the
Coconino National Forest near Flagstaff, AZ, U.S.A.
(N 35 160 0000, W 111 440 0000) as part of a larger experimental
study investigating the effects of restoration thinning and
burning in ponderosa pine stands. Our study sites were at
2,250 m elevation in two adjacent approximately 16 ha
units that were thinned in the winter of 19992000. Piles
of slash created during tree thinning were burned in
February 2000. Over 50 slash piles (averaging 9 m in
diameter and 34 m tall) were created from the thinning
treatments (Fig. 1). Estimated total fuel mass consumed
for each slash pile averaged between 1.4 and 3.2 metric
tons (Hardy 1996). For this research we chose 30 slash
piles with similar total fuel mass to minimize variation
in fire severity among piles.
Before thinning and prescribed burning, the vegetation
at the study site consisted of pure ponderosa pine stands,
with few large trees intermixed with numerous small trees
(1162 Â± 141.4 trees/ha).
The
perennial
grasses
Elymus
elymoides (Rafinesque) Swezey (squirreltail), Muhlenbergia
montana Nuttall (mountain muhly), and numerous forbs
dominated the understory. Soils are moderately well-
drained clays and clay loams derived from basalt and
are classified as fine, montmorillonitic Typic Argiboroll
(Terrestrial Ecosystems Survey of the Coconino National
Forests 1995). The A horizon extends only 10cm deep and
the remaining soil profile extends 114152 cm deep before
reaching the fractured basalt bedrock (Overby 2001 USFS
soil scientist, personal communication). Precipitation occurs
as snowfall and rain during the winter, a pronounced
drought in May and June, and frequent monsoon rains in
July and August. Average summer precipitation is 20.8cm.
Daily mean temperatures range from 5 to 17 C throughout
the year (Sackett 1980).

diameter and 34 m tall) researched in this study before burning.

Fire Intensity Gradient
Boundaries of slash pile scars were clearly identified by
white ash, charred, blackened soil, and no vegetation.
Transects were established in a NS direction across the
boundaries of each of the 30 slash pile scars, with 3 m
extending inside and 3 m outside the scar. We assumed
that sampling points along these transects at 3 m inside
the scar, 1.5 m inside the scar, scar edge, and 3 m outside
the scar represent a fire intensity gradient, with the hottest
soil temperatures 3 m inside the scar and coolest 3 m out-
side the scar.
Mycorrhizae Field and Laboratory Methodology.
One soil
sample was collected from each point along all 30 slash
pile transects in May 2000 and May 2001 (3 and 15 months
after burning). We were unable to collect soil samples
before burning for these same points because the exact
location of piled slash was unknown before slash piling.
Therefore 10 random samples were taken in the general
vicinity of the slash piles to provide a background AM
inoculum measurement before burning for the study area
using the same methodology (Korb et al. 2003). Soils were
collected to a depth of 15 cm using a hand trowel and
immediately placed into 4 cm diameter 320 cm deep Con-
etainers (Stuewe and Sons, Inc., Corvallis, OR, U.S.A.).
We used a Zea mays L. (corn) bait-plant bioassay to
determine the relative amount of infective propagules of
AM fungi in our soil samples. Corn is mycotrophic with
many species of AM fungi and grows rapidly and uni-
formly; these advantages outweigh the disadvantage of
not using a native host plant (Johnson et al. 1999). Bait-
plant bioassays are designed to detect all types of viable
mycorrhizal fungal propagules including spores, fragments
of mycorrhizal roots, and extraradical hyphae and there-
fore more accurately quantify total densities of AM fungal
propagules than direct counts of sporocarps, spores, or
colonized root lengths (Brundrett & Abbott 1994). Corn
seeds were sown in freshly collected soils and the plants
were maintained in a greenhouse for 6 weeks. Corn roots
were cut into 2.5-cm segments and subsamples were
cleared in 5% KOH and stained with Trypan blue in
lactoglycerin (Koske & Gemma 1990). Proportion of root
length containing AM fungal structures (arbuscules, vesi-
cles, coils, and hyphae) was measured by the gridline inter-
sect method using a dissecting microscope which gives a
relative amount of infective AM propagules (Giovannetti
& Mosse 1980).
Soil Seed Bank Field and Laboratory Methodology.
In May
2000, one soil sample was collected from each point along
all 30 slash pile transects (n 5 4) using a 5 cm diameter
metal core to a depth of 5 cm to determine the viable soil
seed bank. These sampling point locations were the same
for the mycorrhizae soil cores. We assessed populations of
viable seeds by placing each individual soil core on top of
2 cm of sterilized soil in a 11 3 11cm plastic container in
an unheated greenhouse (1830  C). Containers were
watered daily using an automatic mist system. Over a
4-month period, plant seedlings that emerged were identi-
fied to species, counted, and removed. Seed bank data
were analyzed by averaging both individual species and
the total number of seedlings per transect and converting
this number to the number of seeds/m2. Seeds/m2 is the
common standardized unit used in seed bank studies.
Containers of sterilized soil were also maintained without
living soil cores to determine if there was any greenhouse
contamination.
Soil Chemical Field and Laboratory Methodology.
In May
2000, soil samples for chemical analyses were collected to a
depth of 10 cm using a hand trowel 3 m inside the scar, at
the scar edge, and 3 m outside the scar along all 30 slash
pile transects. In October 2001, soil samples were collected
10 m outside the scar in addition to the other sampling
locations to quantify KCl-extractable ammonium nitrogen
(NH4-N) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N). Soil chemical
properties were analyzed at the Bilby Research Soil Ana-
lysis Laboratory (Flagstaff, AZ, U.S.A.). Soil pH was
determined in a 1 : 1 slurry using a pH meter. Total N
and P were measured following Kjeldahl digestion by
automated colorimetry using a Technicon auto-analyzer
(Technicon Instruments Corp., Tarrytown, NY, U.S.A.)
(Parkinson & Allen 1975). Available NH4-N and NO3-N
were determined from KCl extracts of freshly collected
soil by automated colorimetry using a Technicon auto-
analyzer (Parkinson & Allen 1975). Organic C was deter-
mined by loss on ignition, samples were heated to 425 C
for 24 hr and organic matter was estimated from mass loss.
Amelioration Experiment
Five 1-m2 (0.53 2 m) plots were located horizontally within
each slash pile scar (at least 1 m from the scar edge and at
least 1 m from each other) so that each plot would have a
similar underlying fire gradient intensity. Each plot was
randomly assigned one of five treatments: (1) no treatment
(control); (2) living soil amendment (containing micro-
organisms, AM fungi, and plant propagules); (3) sterilized
soil amendment (no propagules); (4) seed amendment
(11.2 g of native seeds); or (5) seed/soil amendment. No
seed/sterilized soil amendment was applied and therefore
inferences regarding the biotic soil component on plant
establishment are limited to this study. Topsoil that had
recently been stockpiled from road construction 1 km from
the experimental site was used for the soil amendments. A
previous study showed high densities of viable AM pro-
pagules in this soil (Korb et al. 2001). Soil taken from the
same location was steam sterilized for 48 hr to create the
sterilized soil amendment without living organisms but with
similar chemical and physical properties as the living soil
amendment. Similarities of chemical properties were veri-
fied between the sterilized soil and the living soil amend-
ment after sterilization (Korb, unpublished data). In June
2000, second, third, and fifth treatments had 20,000 cm3

of living or sterilized soil layered onto each 1-m2 plot,
resulting in an average amendment depth of 2 cm. When
the amendment soil was collected, 20 soil cores were
sampled to quantify populations of viable seeds using the
procedures described previously.
In May 2001 (15 months after burning and 11 months
after soil amendments were added) 15-cm deep soil sam-
ples were collected from the experimental plots in each
slash pile scar to quantify AM propagule densities using
bait-plant bioassays. We used bait-plant bioassays instead
of harvesting individual plants to determine AM coloniza-
tion levels because we were also interested in quantifying
the long-term success of plant establishment in these
amendment plots. In addition, these amendments are
being used as restoration treatments to establish native
plants and prevent the establishment of non-native species
in slash pile scars. Therefore harvesting native plants to
quantify AM propagule densities would be counterintui-
tive to this goal even though it would be a more direct
assessment of AM colonization for our individual treat-
ments. In October 2001 soil samples were also collected to
a depth of 10 cm from the control, soil amendment, and
seed/soil amendment to quantify KCl-extractable NH4-N
and NO3-N (Table 1).
Seed amendments consisted of a mixture of 19 species of
native grasses and forbs that were abundant in the extant
vegetation surrounding the slash pile scars. Seeds were
purchased from the nearest possible regional source
(Colorado Native Seed in Salida, CO, U.S.A.). Purity of
the seed was verified in greenhouse and field trials. Fourth
and fifth treatments were sown with 8.4 g of grass seed and
2.8 g of forb seed per 1-m2 plot. Seeds were sown in early
July 2000 (5 months after burning) to coincide with the
monsoon rains in late summer and mimic treatments that
could be implemented by land managers (i.e., no supple-
mental water). In September 2000 and 2001 (7 and 19
months after the piles were burned) seedlings and mature
plants in all the plots were identified and counted. In
addition the cover of each plant species was determined
using the ocular estimate method to the nearest 0.1%. The
phenological stage (e.g., rosette, flower, or seed) and plant
height was also recorded.
Statistical Analysis
Repeated
measures multivariate
analysis
of variance
(MANOVA) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used.
The ShapiroWilk test was used to test data for normality,
and Levenâs test was used to test for homogeneity of the
variance (Zar 1984). Before analysis, some data were
transformed to improve normality and homoscedasticity
assumptions (Zar 1984). Root colonization data were arc-
sine square-root transformed, soil seed bank densities and
some individual plant species variables were log(x 1 1)
transformed, and soil properties were square-root trans-
formed. Tukeyâs honestly significant difference test was
used to make multiple comparisons of means following a
significant result. All analyses were performed using SPSS
version 8 (SPSS 1998).
Results
Fire Intensity Gradient
Three and 15 months after burning, corn bait-plants grown
in soils collected from inside the slash pile scars had sig-
nificantly lower AM colonization than those grown in soils
collected from the scar edges and 3 m outside the scars
(Fig. 2). Infective propagule densities of AM fungi were
also significantly reduced at the scar edges in comparison
with 3 m outside the scars. Between 3 and 15 months after
burning, there was a significant increase in AM propagule
densities at the scar edge and 3 m outside the scar but not
in the interior of the slash pile scar (Fig. 2).
In 2000, there were significantly more viable seeds 3 m
outside the scars than 3 m inside the scars or at the scar
edges (Fig. 3). Most viable seeds were from exotic or rud-
eral species (native species that prefer disturbed, high-
nutrient habitats) (Grime 1977). Three meters outside
the scar, the exotic seed bank was dominated by Verbas-
cum thapsus L. (mullein), an early successional species of
disturbed habitats, with a mean of 368 seeds/m2. Linaria
dalmatica (L.) P. Mill. (dalmation toadflax) accounted for
the remaining exotic seed bank with 45 seeds/m2. Laenne-
cia schiedeana (Less.) Nesom (pineland marshtail) and
Erigeron divergens Torrey & Gray (spreading fleabane)
were the dominant ruderal species, and Carex spp. and
Muhlenbergia montana were the dominant native species
in the seed bank.
Differences in soil chemical properties were evident
across the fire intensity gradient. Soil pH was significantly
higher 3 m inside the scars in comparison with the scar
edges and 3 m outside the scars (Fig. 4a). In contrast,
total N and organic C were significantly higher 3 m outside
the scars in comparison with the scar edges and 3 m inside
the scars (Fig. 4b & 4c). There was no significant difference

in total P across the transects (Fig. 4d). KCl-extractable
NH4-N and NO3-N were significantly higher 3 m inside
the scar in comparison with the scar edge and 10 m outside
the scar edge (Table 1).
Amelioration Experiment
Soils collected from control plots and plots amended with
sterilized soil had significantly lower densities of infective
AM propagules than soils from plots amended with both
seed and soil 15 months after burning and 11 months after
soil amendments were added to the slash pile scars (Fig. 5).
There was no significant difference in KCl-extractable soil
NH4-N or NO3-N between the control, sterilized soil
amendment, and seed/soil amendment plots (mean values
were 9.7 mg/kg NH4-N and 14.1 mg/kg NO3-N).
The live soil amendment contained an average of 256
viable seeds/m2, with Carex spp. the most abundant species
and M. montana, V. thapsus, and L. schiedeana also com-
mon. During the first growing season in 2000 (7 months
after burning and 2 months after seeding) only seeded
forbs and grass species became established, and there was
no natural regeneration of ruderals or exotics. Forb and
graminoid cover was significantly higher in the seed/soil
amendments than the seed amendments (Fig. 6a & 6b).
During the second growing season in 2001, native forb
and graminoid cover was significantly higher in the seed-
amended plots than in the control, sterilized soil or soil
amended plots but lower than plots amended with both
seed and soil (Figs. 6a & 6b, 7a & 7b). There was no
significant difference in exotic plant cover between any
of the amendment treatments, but the seed/soil amend-
ments had the lowest exotic cover (Fig. 6c). The most
abundant exotic species was V. thapsus. Other exotic spe-
cies included Cirsium vulgare (Savi) Tenore (bull thistle),
Amaranthus albus L. (amaranth), and L. dalmatica. Rud-
eral species had significantly higher cover in the control,
sterile soil amendment, and soil amended plots than those
amended with both seed and soil (Fig. 6d). The most
abundant ruderal species was L. schiedeana, an early
colonizing biennial cudweed.
Seventeen species flowered the second growing season.
Elymus elymoides was the most abundant flowering spe-
cies followed by Heliomeris multiflora Nuttall (showy
goldeneye), Muhlenbergia wrightii Vasey (spike muhly),
and Bouteloua gracilis Humboldt (blue grama). The seed/
soil amendments had the highest total number of flowering
individuals (41) followed by the seed amendments (27),
soil amendments (17), sterile soil amendments (8), and
the controls (6). Three exotic species flowered in the
control, sterilized soil, or soil amendments: V. thapsus,
L. dalmatica, and A. albus.
Five of the seeded species did not germinate in any of
the plots either growing season and four species only
germinated during the second growing season (Table 2).
Native grass cover was significantly higher for seeded
B. gracilis, E. elymoides, and M. wrightii in plots amended
with live soil and seed than seed-only plots for 2000 and
2001 (Table2). Similarly native forb cover was signifi-

Discussion
Slash pile burning leaves persistent scars on the land and
therefore may conflict with managersâ goals for Pinus
ponderosa stands. We found that slash pile scars have
significantly altered soil properties and virtually no viable
plant seeds and AM propagules remain. In contrast, a
preburn reference study measuring viable plant seeds and
AM propagules in the same study area showed an average
of 1,176 seeds/m2 and an average AM colonization of
33.2% (Korb et al. 2003). Both of these studies corrobo-
rate that the absence of viable plant seed and AM propa-
gules is the result of slash pile burning. Other studies also
report the loss of seed banks (Hassan & West 1986; Odion
& Davis 2000) and viable AM propagules (Klopatek et al.
1988; Berch et al. 1993) after intense fire. Combustion of
the litter and duff horizon along with soil heating during
slash burning is most likely responsible for the low number
of viable seeds (Moore & Wein 1977) and AM propagules
in the scars that we studied. Maximum soil surface tem-
peratures are usually 500700  C during heavy slash burns
in chaparral (Rundel 1983), and temperatures at 10 cm and
22 cm depth in mineral soil can reach over 250 and 100 C,
respectively, in pine (Roberts 1965). Within one growing
season, populations of viable AM fungal propagules were
recovering at the scar edge but not in the center of the
scar. This corroborates with other studies that show
neutral or positive responses of AM activity after low-
intensity fires where AM hyphae most likely survive in
roots of nearby plants (Rashid et al. 1997) or as propagules
deeper in the soil profile where soil heating is not severe
(Pattinson et al. 1999; Korb et al. 2001).

Slash Pile Burning Effects in Restoration Areas

Slash pile burning also altered soil chemistry. Ele-
vated soil pH within the scars was likely due to the
hydrolysis of base cation oxides that are abundant in
ash after severe burns (Fuller et al. 1955; Ballard 2000).
Organic C and total soil N were significantly lower
inside the scars, suggesting that the intense fire volati-
lized C and N compounds (Klemmedson 1976; Weast
1988). Studies have shown that although burning may
reduce total soil N immediately after a fire, NH4-N
often increases because of pyrolysis of forest floor
material, and within a year NO3-N also increases due
to nitrification of the NH4-N pulse, which is consistent
with our study findings (Covington et al. 1991; Ellingson
et al. 2000). Unlike N and organic C, total soil P showed
no significant response to slash pile burning. Because
9498% of soil P is located in the mineral soil layers
and not in the litter layer, P is not as sensitive to severe
burning
as
N
(Neary
et
al.
1999).
Soil
chemistry
changes, which affect nutrient availability, can influence
post-disturbance vegetation. In particular ruderal and
non-native species can often outcompete native species
in high-nutrient environments.
Slash pile construction using heavy mechanized equip-
ment can often be very detrimental to soil physical proper-
ties. Soil physical parameters were not measured in slash
pile-constructed areas; however, a study throughout the
entire restoration treatment area showed no significant
soil compaction associated with tree-thinning treatments
(Korb, unpublished data). Areas of moderate and severe
soil profile disturbance were noted in areas surrounding
slash pile areas due to slash pile construction (Korb,
unpublished data).
Slash pile scars are problematic because they often
remain unvegetated (Covington et al. 1991) or become
colonized by exotic (frequently invasive) plant species
(Dickinson & Kirkpatrick 1987). Consequently we were
interested
in
identifying
restoration
treatments
that
would encourage the establishment of native plants and
discourage colonization by exotic plants. Our amelioration
experiment indicates that the addition of both living soil
and native seed generated the highest species richness and
abundance of native plants and the lowest species richness
and abundance of exotic and ruderal plants. Direct seeding
on ash resulted in lower native species richness and less

than half the native plant cover compared with plots
amended with both seed and living soil. Also exotic plant
cover was significantly lower in plots receiving dual seed
and soil amendments compared with those receiving only
seeds. Areas amended with living soil and seed were more
closely related to adjacent areas that had low-severity
burns than the other amendment treatments including
seed only. On average native plant cover in our living
soil and seed-amended plots in 2001 was 11.9% cover,
which is similar to native plant cover outside the slash
piles (11.2%) in areas that received tree thinning and a
low-severity burn (restoration treatment), which repre-
sents an artificial target for native plant cover (Korb,
unpublished data). Conversely areas within the slash pile
scar with no soil or seed amendment (control) had on
average less than 0.01% native plant cover.
Plant community composition is clearly impacted by the
presence and function of AM symbioses (van der Heijden
et al. 1998; Hartnett & Wilson 1999; Klironomos 2002).
Consequently reintroduction of AM fungi in the living soil
amendment may have facilitated the success of the seed/
soil treatments. Propagule densities of AM fungi were
higher in the seed/soil treatment than in any of the other
treatments. However, because we did not specifically con-
trol for AM fungi in this study, this conclusion needs
further verification through future research. Other studies
have found that AM fungi can promote the establishment
of native plant cover in disturbed habitats (Gange et al.
1990; Smith et al. 1998) and that AM fungal propagule
densities remain low in severely disturbed soil environ-
ments unless efforts are made to restore them (Rives
et al. 1980; Gould et al. 1996). Other biotic soil com-
ponents such as bacteria and actinomycetes may have
played a role in facilitating plant establishment.
Abiotic properties of the soil amendment may have also
facilitated successful establishment of native plants by gen-
erating an environment that is more conducive to seed
germination and recruitment. In our experiment adding
2 cm of topsoil probably ameliorated water infiltration,
soilgas exchange, microclimate, and microtopography
compared with bare ash (Chambers et al. 1990; Chambers
2000).
Management Recommendations and Conclusion
Biotic and abiotic changes that occurred in the burned
slash pile areas for our study are consistent with research
in different forest types that have quantified changes in
severely burned areas (DeBano et al. 1979; Dickinson &
Kirkpatrick 1987; Moreno & Oechel 1991). This consis-
tency in biotic and abiotic changes, regardless of forest
type, implies that our findings are relevant to other forest
community types where slash pile burning, which results in
severely burned areas, is part of forest management.
If slash pile burn areas are either qualitatively or quantita-
tively assessed to be severely burned, amelioration tech-
niques to minimize non-native plant establishment need to
be implemented regardless of the forest community type.
At a minimum, severely burned slash pile areas need to
have seed amendments. If AM fungi play an important role
in plant establishment for a particular forest community
type, then soil amendments are also recommended. These
recommendations are not to be confused with severely
burned areas from prescribed or natural fire. Some forest
and woodland types in the western U.S. have evolved with
high-intensity fires (e.g., lodgepole pine and chaparral), and
these areas generally revegetate on their own because their
native species are highly adapted to severe fires and many
depend on severe fires for regeneration.
Our results show that burning slash piles generate scars
with increased susceptibility to invasion by exotic plant
species. Generally the most opportune time to control or
reduce exotic species is during early spread before large
densities or large areas are occupied (Byers et al. 2002).
Because anecdotal evidence suggests that slash pile scars
have long-term negative effects, we recommend that land
managers minimize burning large piles of slash in any
forest treatments. Management decisions about slash
removal need to weigh the feasibility of alternative slash

amendment 1-m2 plot (19 months after burning and 15 months
following soil/seed amendment). (b) Numerous grass and forb species

removal techniques against financial constraints and recog-
nize that trade-offs exist between alternative restoration
decisions (e.g., local soil effects versus economic impacts).
If slash pile burning is the only realistic management
option for safely reducing large amounts of fuel in restor-
ation treatments, we recommend that slash be piled and
burned on existing roads to minimize ecological impacts.
We also recommend that severely burned slash pile scars
are treated with seed and soil amendments within the first
growing season after burning to increase the rate of native
plant establishment and discourage the invasion of exotic
species. In addition native seeds of species common in the
area should be used from a local source to minimize
genetic contamination from seeding amendments, and
soil should also be taken from the local vicinity.
Some ecological restoration treatments, particularly a
few forest restoration activities, result in severe environ-
mental disturbances that need restoration treatments
themselves (e.g., slash piles, landing areas, and roads).
Because these forest restoration treatments are ecologic-
ally based, the first priority of these treatments should be
to minimize or eliminate the need to restore areas within
the treatment area because of restoration activities. If
restoration-caused disturbance is deemed necessary to
complete the treatment, restoration researchers, however,
need to understand how to rehabilitate or restore these
areas so that by trying to restore forest health we do not
create new restoration problems (e.g., the establishment of
exotic species).
