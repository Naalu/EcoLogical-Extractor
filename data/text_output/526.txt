Abstract
Ecological restoration treatments are widely applied in southwestern ponderosa pine forests to convert them to an open canopy
structure similar to that found at the time of Euro-American settlement. An experiment was initiated in northern Arizona in
1994 to evaluate long-term ecosystem responses to 3 restoration treatments: 1) thinning from below (thinning), 2) thinning from
below plus forest ﬂoor manipulation with periodic prescribed burning (composite), and 3) an untreated control. Results focus on
total herbaceous and functional-group standing crop response to these restoration treatments. Pretreatment data were collected
in 1992 and posttreatment responses were measured from 1994 through 2004. Total herbaceous standing crop was signiﬁcantly
higher on the 2 treated areas than on the control over the entire posttreatment period, but did not differ between the thinning
and composite treatments. Plant functional groups responded differently to treatments and to drought. In general, the graminoid
standing crop responded within several years after the initial treatments and continued to increase through time, until a series of
severe droughts reduced standing crop to pretreatment levels. C3 graminoids dominated the standing-crop response, of which
bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus elymoides (Raf.) Swezey ssp. elymoides) was the primary contributor. C4 graminoids had
a minimal response to restoration treatments, possibly because they were less abundant before the experiment began or because
they were adversely affected by autumn burning. Legumes and forbs exhibited a 4–5 year lag before responding to the thinning
and composite treatments. Annual and biennial plants showed a large biomass increase approximately 5 years after
implementation of the composite treatment. The restoration goal of optimizing herbaceous standing crop must be weighed
against the competing goals of increasing the abundance of speciﬁc functional groups, increasing biodiversity or rare plants,
and managing invasive plant species.
Resumen
Los tratamientos de restauracio´n ecolo´gica son ampliamente aplicados en los bosques de ‘‘Ponderosa pine’’ del sudoeste para
convertirlos en una estructura de cobertura abierta similar a la que se encontro´ en el tiempo de la colonizacio´n Euroamericana.
En 1994, en el norte de Arizona, se inicio un experimento para evaluar las respuestas a largo lazo del ecosistema a tres
tratamientos de restauracio´n: 1) aclareo desde abajo (aclareo); 2) Aclareo desde abajo mas manipulacio´n del piso del bosque con
fuego prescrito perio´dico (compuesto) y 3) control sin tratar. Los resultados se enfocaron en la respuesta de la biomasa total
herba´cea y de grupos funcionales a estos tratamientos de restauracio´n. Los datos pre-tratamiento fueron colectados en 1992 y
las respuestas post-tratamientos fueron medidas de 1994 a 2004. Durante todo el periodo post-tratamiento la biomasa total
herba´cea de las dos a´reas tratadas fue signiﬁcativamente mayor que la del a´rea control, pero no diﬁrio´ entre los tratamientos de
aclareo y compuesto. Los grupos funcionales de plantas respondieron diferente a los tratamientos y la sequı´a. En general, la
biomasa de las gramı´neas respondio´ varios an˜os despue´s de iniciar los tratamientos, incrementa´ndose continuamente a trave´s del
tiempo hasta que una serie de severas sequı´as redujo la biomasa a los niveles presentes antes de aplicar los tratamientos. Las
gramı´neas C3 dominaron la respuesta de la biomasa, de las cuales el ‘‘Bottlebrush squirreltail’’ (Elymus elymoides (Raf.) Swezey
ssp. elymoides) fue el principal contribuyente. Las gramı´neas C4 tuvieron una mı´nima respuesta a los tratamientos de
restauracio´n, posiblemente porque ellas fueron menos abundantes antes de que el experimento comenzara´ o porque ellas fueron
afectadas adversamente por la quema de oton˜o. Las leguminosas y hierbas mostraron un retrazo de 4-5 an˜os para responder
a los tratamientos de aclareo y compuesto. Aproximadamente 5 an˜os despue´s de implementar el tratamiento compuesto las
plantas anuales y bianuales mostraron un gran aumento de la biomasa. La meta de restauracio´n de optimizar la biomasa
herba´cea debe ser ponderada contra las metas de incrementar la abundancia de grupos funcionales especı´ﬁcos, aumentando la
biodiversidad o las plantas raras y manejar las especies vegetales invasoras.

INTRODUCTION
Prior to Euro-American settlement, southwestern ponderosa
pine (Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson var. scopulorum
Engelm.) forests were characterized by a productive, grass-
dominated understory and a temporary accumulation of litter
and woody debris that supported low-intensity surface ﬁres
every 2–20 years (Pyne et al. 1996; Swetnam and Baisan 1996,
2003). Euro-American settlement greatly altered these forests
at the beginning of the 20th century by introducing large num-
bers of domestic livestock, removing many large-diameter trees
through high-grade logging practices, and disrupting the
natural ﬁre regime (Pearson 1910; Weaver 1951; Moore et al.
1999). These factors, combined with favorable climatic con-
ditions, resulted in the establishment of massive amounts of
pine regeneration in the early 1900s (Arnold 1950; Weaver
1951; Cooper 1960; Savage and Swetnam 1990; Savage et al.
1996).
Historically, many sites in northern Arizona were described
as a matrix of grass-dominated meadows interspersed with
stands of pine (Pearson 1950; Cooper 1960). However, con-
temporary southwestern ponderosa pine forests have a closed
overstory canopy with a few fragmented, remnant grass open-
ings intermixed (Covington and Moore 1994; Covington et al.
1997). These remnant grass patches may hold only a fraction
of their presettlement plant richness and diversity.
Resource management and conservation practices are chal-
lenging in these mixed woody-herbaceous systems (House et al.
2003). The ratio of woody to herbaceous plants is very dynamic
and can change at decadal time scales (Archer 1996), especially
in response to ﬁre, herbivory, and climate. In response to
concerns about forest ecosystem health and large crown ﬁres
in southwestern ponderosa pine forests, land managers and
the scientiﬁc community in the Southwest have begun using
ecological restoration thinning treatments to convert dense,
closed-canopy ponderosa pine stands back to more open-stand
structures. Many of these treatments and management plans
also call for regularly scheduled prescribed ﬁres, in hopes of
simulating the frequent ﬁre regime that was common in these
systems in presettlement times (Agee 1993; Covington et al.
1997; Moore et al. 1999; Wienk et al. 2004). Both overstory
tree thinning and prescribed burning can have mixed results on
the herbaceous understory, depending upon thinning level and
ﬁre intensity, frequency, and season (Covington et al. 1997;
Tiedemann et al. 2000; Wienk et al. 2004).
This study is part of a larger project initiated to restore
a reasonable approximation of the presettlement ponderosa
pine ecosystem and to determine the attributes that characterize
the health of that system (Covington et al. 1997; Kaye et al.
2005). Three treatments—thinning from below (thinning res-
toration treatment), thinning from below with forest ﬂoor
manipulation and periodic prescribed burning (composite
restoration treatment), and no treatment (control)—were
applied at the study site. Both restoration treatments return
the overstory to the approximate stand structure (size, density,
age distributions) of presettlement forests. The composite
restoration treatment also restores the approximate fuel depth
and ﬁre characteristics of presettlement forests in the area
(Covington et al. 1997).
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the
responses of the herbaceous community to the thinning and
composite restoration treatments. Here we describe the effects
of tree thinning and thinning plus prescribed burning on
aboveground herbaceous standing crop by treatment and by
plant functional group. Aboveground herbaceous standing crop
was measured in 1992 (pretreatment) and another 7 times from
1994–2004 (posttreatment). Treatment differences were as-
sessed with respect to total standing crop and the relative
contributions of C3 graminoid, C4 graminoid, legume, non-
leguminous perennial forb, and nonleguminous annual–biennial
forb functional groups.
METHODS
Study Site
This study was conducted at the Gus Pearson Natural Area
(GPNA), located approximately 10 km northwest of Flagstaff,
Arizona in the Fort Valley Experimental Forest, Coconino
National Forest (lat 358169000, long 1118459000). The approx-
imately 4.3-ha study site ranges from 2 195 to 2 255 m in
elevation, and much of the area has ﬂat to gently rolling
topography with some southwesterly and northwesterly as-
pects. Soils are derived from Tertiary basalt ﬂows and cinders,
and are classiﬁed as a Brolliar stony clay loam, and a complex
of ﬁne, smectitic Typic Argiborolls and Mollic Eutroboralfs
(Kerns et al. 2003).
The average annual temperature is 7.58C. Average annual
precipitation is approximately 57 cm, and follows a bimodal,
monsoonal precipitation pattern with approximately half of the
precipitation occurring as rain in July and August and half as
snow in the winter (Savage et al. 1996). Drought was common
during this study, with 2002 being especially severe (Fig. 1).
Weather data were obtained from the Fort Valley Experi-
mental Station weather records (USDA, Forest Service Rocky
Mountain Research Station 2005), supplemented by data from
the Flagstaff airport (NOAA 2005) when data were missing
from Fort Valley.
The study area was fenced to exclude domestic ungulates in
1950, and so has been ungrazed by livestock for more than 50
years (Olberding 2000). In 1992, a 2.4-m electriﬁed fence was
constructed to exclude wild ungulates from GPNA. Some trees
were removed from GPNA in 1894, but it did not receive
commercial harvest after that time (Avery et al. 1976). The last
major ﬁre in the vicinity prior to this experiment occurred in
1876 (Dietrich 1980).
Ponderosa pine is the only overstory species on the study
site. The understory is dominated by native perennial grami-
noid species, including Festuca arizonica Vasey (Arizona
fescue),
Elymus
elymoides
(Raf.)
Swezey
ssp.
elymoides
(bottlebrush
squirreltail),
Muhlenbergia
montana
(Nutt.)
A. S. Hitchc. (mountain muhly), Poa fendleriana (Steud.) Vasey
(muttongrass), and Carex geophila Mackenzie (White Moun-
tain sedge). Dominant native perennial forb species include
Vicia americana Muhl. Ex. Willd. (American vetch), Senecio
actinella Greene (Flagstaff ragwort), Houstonia wrightii Gray
(pygmy bluet), Astragalus rusbyi Greene (Rusby’s milkvetch),
Lupinus argenteus Pursh (silvery lupine), Antennaria parvifolia
Nutt. (small-leaf pussytoes), Solidago velutina DC. (threenerve

goldenrod), Achillea millefolium L. var. occidentalis DC.
(western yarrow), and Cirsium wheeleri (Gray) Petrak (Wheel-
er’s thistle). Common native annuals include Muhlenbergia
minutissima (Steud.) Swallen (annual muhly; a grass), Lupinus
kingii S. Wats. (King’s lupine; a legume), and forbs such as
Laennecia schiedeana (Less.) Cronq. (pineland marshtail),
Chenopodium graveolens Willd. (fetid goosefoot), Conyza
canadensis (L.) Cronq. (Canadian horseweed), and Helianthus
annuus L. (common sunﬂower). Common native biennial forbs
are Erigeron ﬂagellaris Gray (trailing ﬂeabane) and Erigeron
divergens Torr. & Gray (spreading ﬂeabane). Six exotic species
have been recorded on the study site, with the 2 dominants
being the perennial graminoid Poa pratensis L. (Kentucky
bluegrass) and the biennial forb Verbascum thapsus L. (com-
mon mullein). The only shrub on the study site is Ceanothus
fendleri Gray (Fendler’s ceanothus).
Experimental Design
In 1992, 15 treatment plots, each approximately 0.2–0.3 ha in
size, were established and assigned to one of 3 treatments
(control, thinning restoration, and composite restoration treat-
ments). Treatment plots have also been referred to as whole
plots (sensu Covington et al. 1997). The 5 control treatment
plots were located nonrandomly on one side of the study site,
and the thinning and composite treatment plots were assigned
randomly. This design was necessary so that the fuel break
created by the treated plots would protect the historical
buildings of the adjacent Fort Valley Experimental Station.
Each treatment plot contained 4 patch types: presettlement
tree groups, thinned postsettlement tree groups, unthinned
postsettlement trees, and remnant grass openings. One circular
subplot, with a radius of 2.5 m, was established within each of
the 4 patch types per treatment plot. In total, 55 subplots were
established: 4 per treatment plot in the thinning treatment
(n ¼ 20) and composite treatment (n ¼ 20), and 3 per treat-
ment plot in the control (n ¼ 15, controls did not contain
thinned patches). Subplots represent the range of patch types
and illustrate the wide range of conditions sampled within
treatment plots. Herbaceous data were scaled to the treatment-
plot level (n ¼ 15) by weighting the herbaceous standing crop
on each subplot by the proportion of the treatment plot area
occupied by the patch type in which the subplot was located
(see Standing-Crop Data Collection below). Detailed results on
patch-level effects can be found in Casey (2004) and Laughlin
et al. (2006).
The thinning and composite treatments were thinned from
below (i.e., postsettlement trees that were overtopped or in
lower crown positions were removed in varying proportions;
Nyland 1996) in the fall of 1993, retaining all presettlement
trees (. 40.6 cm diameter at breast height [dbh]) and leaving
approximately 3 replacement postsettlement trees for every
dead presettlement tree or stump (Fule´ et al. 1997; Mast et al.
1999). Presettlement and postsettlement tree group structure
was determined through dendrochronological reconstructions
(Mast et al. 1999). The thinning and composite treatments
removed approximately 2 200 trees per hectare (Covington
et al. 1997; Fig. 2), including most of the trees that established
after 1876 (deﬁned as postsettlement). All slash was removed by
hand, and all presettlement coarse woody debris was retained.
In the composite treatment, the forest ﬂoor was manipulated
by raking the litter layer aside, removing accumulated forest
ﬂoor duff, and returning the current (approximately 3-year)
litter layer to the site. To simulate the presettlement condition
of a grass-dominated understory that carried frequent ﬁre,
approximately 670 kgha1 of herbaceous vegetation from
Hart Prairie (4.8 km to the north) was harvested in late
September 1994 and scattered across the plots (Covington
et al. 1997); this supplementation occurred only in 1994. The
composite treatment received an initial prescribed burn in
1994, and additional prescribed burns in 1998 and 2002. All
burns were conducted in October, after data collection was
completed for that year. Fire history records indicate that most
presettlement ﬁres in northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests
occurred in April through early July (Baisan and Swetnam
1990). Therefore, although ﬁne-fuels loads mimic presettle-
ment herbaceous fuels, the season of burn is not similar to
presettlement ﬁre regimes. Contemporary forest fuel loads and
conditions often restrict prescribed burns to the fall. Fire
intensity was low for all ﬁres, with average ﬂame lengths of
15 cm and soil surface temperatures of 2408C.
See Covington et al. (1997) and subsequent publications for
a more detailed account of experimental design, thinning and
prescribed burn characteristics, treatment protocol, and effects
on other ecosystem components (Feeney et al. 1998; Kolb et al.
1998; Kaye and Hart 1998a, 1998b; Kaye et al. 1999; Mast
et al. 1999; Skov et al. 2004; Boyle et al. 2005; Kaye et al. 2005).
Standing-Crop Data Collection
Herbaceous standing-crop data were collected in 1992 (pre-
treatment), 1994, 1995, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2002, and 2004.
Field sampling occurred during a 2-week period near mid-
September, which is the time of peak aboveground production
and ﬂowering for major understory species in northern Arizona
(Clary 1975). Each year, we sampled 2 1-m2 (0.5 3 2.0 m)
Figure 1. Annual precipitation during the study (1992–2004) as percent
departure from the long-term (51-year) average. Annual totals included

quadrats per circular subplot. All live herbaceous vegetation
rooted in the quadrats was clipped to ground level (approxi-
mately 2-cm stubble height). Quadrats were arranged in
a wagon-wheel conﬁguration around the center of the circular
subplot and clipping was rotated each year so that the identical
area was not sampled (clipped) for at least 4 years.
Clipped vegetation was separated by species in the ﬁeld and
later regrouped into functional groups. The functional groups
differed among years as methods were reﬁned. In 1992, standing
crop was separated into graminoid and forb functional groups.
From 1994 to 2004, herbaceous vegetation was divided into
C3 graminoids (grasses and sedges), C4 graminoids, legumes,
nonleguminous perennial forbs, and nonleguminous annual–
biennial forbs.
Samples were oven-dried at 708C for 24–48 hours and
weighed to the nearest 0.01 g. Data from the 2 quadrats per sub-
plot were averaged together to yield a single value for each func-
tional group on each of the 55 subplots each year. Herbaceous
data were then scaled to the treatment-plot level (n ¼ 15).
Statistical Analyses
Standing-crop data were scaled to the treatment-plot level (n ¼ 5
per treatment) and analyzed in total and for each functional
group. Testing for normality and homogeneity of variances
concluded that data were not normally distributed, so they
were ln(x) transformed prior to analysis; annual–biennial forb
standing crop was ln(x þ 1) transformed to account for zeros.
Treatment effects were compared in 1992 (pretreatment) using
a 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Posttreatment standing-
crop data (1994–2004) were analyzed using repeated measures
multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) with Greenhouse-
Geisser adjustments to account for autocorrelation (Moser et al.
1990). Signiﬁcant treatment effects in the MANOVA were
followed by analyses comparing treatments within each year
using 1-way ANOVA and Tukey’s honestly signiﬁcant difference
(HSD) post hoc multiple comparisons tests. Signiﬁcant interac-
tions indicated that treatments differed temporally (signiﬁcant
differences among treatments in interannual variability in
standing crop over time). All tests were conducted at a ¼ 0.05
using JMP-IN software (version 5.1.2; SAS 2004).
We also calculated the proportion that each functional group
represented of the total herbaceous standing crop by treatment
from 1994–2004. These proportions were compared between
treatments using the likelihood ratio contingency test (G2).
RESULTS
Total Herbaceous Standing Crop
After treatment, total standing crop differed signiﬁcantly among
treatments (F ¼ 8.6, P ¼ 0.005) and over time (F ¼ 27.0,

P , 0.001) (Fig. 3). The treatment 3 time (time since treat-
ment) interaction was also signiﬁcant (F ¼ 3.0, P ¼ 0.015).
One-way ANOVA indicated that total standing crop differed
marginally among treatments 1 growing season after thinning
from below (1994: F ¼ 3.5, P ¼ 0.06), and differed signiﬁ-
cantly among treatments in all subsequent years (all F . 6.3, all
P , 0.02). In particular, total standing crop was higher in both
treated areas than in the control, but it never differed between
the thinning and composite treatments (Fig. 3).
Graminoid Standing Crop
After treatment, graminoid standing crop differed among
treatments (F ¼ 11.3, P ¼ 0.001) and over time (F ¼ 13.4,
P , 0.0001), and the treatment 3 time interaction was also
signiﬁcant (F ¼ 2.4, P ¼ 0.04). Graminoid standing crop was
signiﬁcantly higher in treated than in control plots in every
posttreatment year, but never differed between the thinning
and composite treatments.
Graminoids were separated into C3 and C4 graminoids in
the years 1994–2004. C3 graminoids had a greater response to
treatment than did C4 graminoids (Figs. 4a, 4b, and 5). C3
graminoid standing crop differed by treatment and over time,
and the treatment 3 time interaction was marginally signiﬁ-
cant. C3 graminoid standing crop differed between the treated
areas and the control in every posttreatment year, but did not
differ between thinning and composite treatments (Fig. 4a).
C4 graminoid standing crop did not differ among treatments,
times, or with the treatment 3 time interaction (Fig. 4b).
Forb Standing Crop
Forb standing crop differed by treatment (F ¼ 4.2, P ¼ 0.04)
and time (F ¼ 42.0, P , 0.0001), and there was a signiﬁcant
treatment 3 time interaction (F ¼ 2.4, P ¼ 0.03). Forb stand-
ing crop did not differ among the 3 treatments from 1994 to
1996 (all F less than 2.5, all P . 0.1), but did differ from 1998–
2004 (all F . 5.5, all P , 0.02). Forb standing crop never
differed between thinning and composite treatments.
Legumes and annual–biennial forbs had a greater response to
treatments than did nonleguminous perennial forbs (Figs. 4c–
4e). Legume standing crop differed by treatment, by time, and
there was a marginally signiﬁcant treatment 3 time interaction.
Legume standing crop in the 2 treated areas differed from the
control in every year from 1996–2004 (Fig. 4c). Legume standing
crop peaked in 1999, which was 1 year after the 1998 prescribed
burn, then declined. Legumes were higher in the composite than
in the thinning treatment throughout the study period, though
this difference was not statistically signiﬁcant. Perennial forb
standing crop did not differ by treatment, or time, and there was
not a signiﬁcant treatment 3 time interaction (Fig. 4d).
Annual–biennial forb standing crop differed by treatment
and by time, and there was a treatment 3 time interaction.
Annual–biennial forb standing crop was greater in the com-
posite treatment than in the thinning treatment or control from
1999–2004 (Fig. 4e). This functional group peaked in 1999,
following the second prescribed burn, and then declined.
Proportions of Functional Groups
In 1994, proportions of functional groups differed between
treatments (G2 ¼ 25.5, P ¼ 0.0013); the thinning and com-
posite treatments differed from the control (both P , 0.05),
but did not differ from each other (P ¼ 0.37). In 2004,
proportions of functional groups differed between treatments
(G2 ¼ 72.0, P , 0.0001). In contrast to 1994, however, the
thinning and composite treatments differed from the control
and from each other.
In 1994, 1 year after thinning but prior to any prescribed
burn, C3 graminoids represented 43% of the total herbaceous
standing crop in the control, 58% in the thinning, and 67% in
the composite treatment (Fig. 5). These proportions varied over
time, with a noted decrease around 1999, but the C3 graminoid
functional group remained dominant in all treatments in 2004
(51%, 60%, and 75% in the control, thinning, and composite
treatments, respectively).
In 1994, C4 graminoids represented less than 12% in the
control and thinning treatments, and 6% in the composite treat-
ment (Fig. 5). Again, these proportions varied over time, with
a noted decrease around 1999. In 2004, C4 graminoids repre-
sented 13% of the total herbaceous standing crop in the control,
26% in the thinning, and 5% in the composite treatment.
Perennial forbs comprised the largest proportion of the forb
functional group and were 42%, 22%, and 17% of the total
herbaceous standing crop in the control, thinning, and compos-
ite treatments, respectively, in 1994 (Fig. 5). By, 2004, this group
was 35%, 9%, and 4% in the control, thinning, and composite
treatments, respectively. Legumes represented 3%, 8%, and
10% of the total standing crop in the control, thinning, and com-
posite treatments, respectively, in 1994 (Fig. 5). These propor-
tions varied over time, but by 2004, the legumes accounted for
less than 1%, 5%, and 8% of the total standing crop in the
control, thinning, and composite treatments, respectively.
Annual and biennial forbs were negligible in 1994 in the
control and represented less than 1% of the total standing crop
in both the thinning and composite treatments (Fig. 5). In 1999,
annual–biennial forbs were 1% and 2% in the control and
thinning treatment, respectively, but 20% in the composite
treatment. In 2004, annual–biennial forbs continued to account
for less than 1% of the total standing crop in the control and

thinning treatments, but represented 7% of the total standing
crop in the composite treatment.
DISCUSSION
The thinning and composite restoration treatments increased
total herbaceous standing crop signiﬁcantly over the control.
Total herbaceous standing crop in the thinning and composite
restoration treatments signiﬁcantly increased just 2 years after
thinning and reached a maximum (approximately 5-fold over
the control) in 1998 and 1999. This immediate response in
herbaceous standing crop was because of the C3 graminoid
component of the understory. Forbs responded later, 5 to 6
years after the initial thinning and prescribed burning. Pre-
cipitation and drought patterns greatly inﬂuenced herbaceous
standing crop (see Drought Effects below).

Thinning Effects
Herbaceous C3 graminoids and legumes demonstrated an
immediate response to thinning. Our results are consistent
with other overstory–understory studies in ponderosa pine
forests and pine–oak woodlands that demonstrate that high
overstory canopy cover results in low herbaceous production
(Arnold 1950), and that rapid recovery of understory plant
biomass can be obtained by basal area reduction (Thompson
and Gartner 1971; Ffolliott and Clary 1982; Uresk and
Severson 1989; McPherson and Weltzin 1998; Wienk et al.
2004). Increased light availability, resulting from tree thinning,
was likely the main factor stimulating increased herbaceous
standing crop (McLaughlin 1978; Riegel et al. 1995; Naumberg
et al. 2001), in addition to higher nitrogen and water
availability (Riegel et al. 1995; Kaye et al. 2005).
C3 graminoid standing crop responded quickly to overstory
thinning, but C4 graminoid standing crop responded only
slightly to thinning even 11 years after treatment. These results
are inconsistent with reports of greater C4 graminoid response
following overstory canopy removal (Thompson and Gartner
1971; McPherson and Weltzin 1998). This apparent discrep-
ancy might reﬂect differential responses among individual plant
species within each functional group. In our study, for example,
the native perennial bottlebrush squirreltail (a C3 graminoid),
dominated the initial herbaceous standing crop response to
thinning (Casey 2004; Laughlin et al. 2006). Squirreltail can
colonize sites quickly and it performs well in a variety of light
conditions (Vose and White 1991; Jones 1998; Naumberg
and DeWald 1999; Naumberg et al. 2001).
Unique functional-group responses compared to other in-
vestigations may also reﬂect the existence of different initial
conditions. For example, the initial proportion of C4 grami-
noids in our experiment was low (, 12% of total standing crop
in 1994) relative to C3 graminoids in all treatments. In contrast,
the study by McPherson and Weltzin (1998) was conducted in
southern Arizona, where C4 grass species dominate (. 90% of
total herbaceous biomass at experiment initiation) and C3 grass
species are sparse. Although little is known about the impor-
tance of graminoid functional groups in presettlement forests, it
is possible that C4 graminoids, which are shade-intolerant, have
been locally extirpated beneath the dense canopies of treed
plots (Kerns et al. 2001, 2003). If so, these extinctions would
have occurred many years before we initiated this experiment.
Despite the overall poor response of C4 graminoids, we did
observe a gradual increase in the proportion of C4 graminoids
in the thinning treatment over the 11-year period (Fig. 5).
Mountain muhly, which drove this response (Casey 2004;
Laughlin et al. 2006), has been shown to increase its biomass
with increasing light availability (Naumburg and DeWald
1999; Naumburg et al. 2001).
Fire Effects
The severity of ﬁre effects on the understory is dependent upon
a number of factors, including the frequency, intensity, and
season of burning, as well as species composition and abiotic
factors. Research has generally shown that understory pro-
duction increases following low-intensity prescribed burns in
ponderosa pine forests, though increases are often species
speciﬁc (Harris and Covington 1983; Andariese and Covington
1986; Vose and White 1991; Wienk et al. 2004).
In this study, effects of low-intensity autumn prescribed
burns on herbaceous standing crop were confounded with
overstory canopy reduction and manipulation of the forest ﬂoor
prior to the ﬁrst prescribed burn. However, ﬁre may have been
a major contributor to some of the functional group changes.
C4 graminoids (particularly mountain muhly) did not increase
in the composite treatment, suggesting that some aspect of the
periodic burning (season, frequency, intensity, etc.) was detri-
mental to this functional group. Other studies have also shown
a decrease in C4 grasses with fall prescribed burns. Gaines et al.
(1958) found a 10% decrease in mountain muhly in ponderosa
pine forests 1 year after autumn prescribed burns in eastern
Arizona. Haisley (1984) found that mountain muhly produc-
tion signiﬁcantly decreased in aspen and ponderosa pine forests
of northern Arizona after October prescribed burns.
The increase in C3 graminoids (speciﬁcally bottlebrush
squirreltail), legumes, and annual–biennial forbs in the more

disturbed environment of the composite treatment was not
surprising. Low-intensity ﬁre creates conditions suitable for
early successional species by increasing bare ground for
germination sites, increasing short-term nutrient availability,
and removing dominant competitors (Denslow 1983; Collins
and Gibson 1990; Whelan 1995; Crawford et al. 2001).
Bottlebrush squirreltail is an early and rapid colonizer of
disturbed sites (Jones 1998) and generally increases following
low-intensity fall burns (Young and Miller 1985).
Legumes showed a delay in response to restoration treat-
ments for the ﬁrst 4 years, and then increased substantially in
1998 in both treated areas, suggesting that both restoration
treatments affected legume production. Legumes are common
in ﬁre-dependent communities (Leach and Givnish 1996), and
are known colonizers and increasers following ﬁre. In the
southeastern United States, frequently burned sites were re-
ported to have a higher frequency, density, and diversity of
legumes than did unburned sites (Hendricks and Boring 1999).
Annual and biennial forbs had a delayed response to
treatment, similar to that observed in legumes and perennial
forbs, and then showed a standing-crop increase in 1998 in
both treatments. However, the largest increase occurred in
1999, 1 year after the second prescribed burn, when annual and
biennial forb standing crop was signiﬁcantly higher in the
composite treatment than in the thinning treatment or control.
By 2002, standing crop of this functional group had returned to
earlier levels. Note that precipitation was near normal or above
average during the ﬁrst 5–6 years and then below average
during the last 5 years. It is not surprising to ﬁnd more annuals
and biennials in a disturbed environment that includes frequent
surface ﬁres that consume most of the surface litter, leaving
a suitable environment for the establishment of ruderal species.
Common mullein, an exotic biennial, drove the annual–
biennial standing crop response (Casey 2004). The dominant
native annual and biennial forbs were pineland marshtail and
2 species of ﬂeabane. Mullein and pineland marshtail seeds are
commonly found in the soil seed bank of ponderosa pine forests
in northern Arizona following thinning or burning treatments
(Korb et al. 2004, 2005).
The intent of the original study was to mimic the frequency,
intensity, and season of burning of the natural ﬁre regime for
the study area (Covington et al. 1997). Fire history records
indicate that prior to Euro-American settlement of the region,
most ﬁres in the ponderosa pine forests of northern Arizona
(and in the Southwest in general) occurred in the spring and
early summer (April through early July) (Baisan and Swetnam
1990). Spring or early summer ﬁres may suppress C3 graminoid
and enhance C4 graminoid functional-group responses to
a greater extent than those that occurred in response to October
burning in this investigation. However, it is currently unsafe to
conduct a prescribed burn under the weather and fuels
conditions that exist in many areas of northern Arizona
between April and early July.
In addition to ﬁre effects, the composite treatment un-
derwent extensive forest ﬂoor manipulation before the ﬁrst
burn, including raking to remove the litter layer and the
addition of mown hay from a nearby prairie. These activities
may have had additional effects on the understory, which were
not examined or controlled for in this study. Raking may have
affected total standing crop and species composition by
affecting the soil seed bank in the O horizon of the composite
treatment (Korb et al. 2004, 2005). Although it is theoretically
possible to introduce plant species by the addition of mown
prairie hay, our plant surveys have not revealed any new species
over the years (Casey 2004). This procedure has not been
observed to result in any plant introductions in the northern
Great Plains (Bakker et al. 2003). If forest ﬂoor manipulation
activities are to become an integral process in restoration, they
should be examined as separate treatments in future studies to
determine their unique impacts.
Drought Effects
Precipitation and drought appear to be the primary forcing
factors in total herbaceous standing crop in our study. Drought
was common, especially during the last 5 years (Fig. 1), and
severe, particularly in 2002, when precipitation was 75%
below average.
These droughts reduced herbaceous standing
crop to levels that were similar to 1992 and 1994. C4
graminoids were not as greatly affected by the drought as
were the other functional groups. McPherson and Weltzin
(1998) also report the recovery of C4 species the second year
after overstory canopy removal, even with below-average
precipitation. The greater water-use efﬁciency of C4 plants
likely explains their ability to thrive under drought-stressed
conditions (Waller and Lewis 1979; Ehleringer and Monson
1993). We suspect that when normal precipitation resumes in
northern Arizona, total standing crop in both treated areas will
eventually exceed the maximum experienced in 1998.
CONCLUSIONS AND
MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS
The herbaceous understory should be a prime focus of land
managers involved with forest restoration and conservation
biology activities in southwestern ponderosa pine forests. A
productive and diverse understory protects soil from erosion,
creates forage and cover for livestock and wildlife, provides
fuels for surface ﬁres, and is the repository for much of the
plant biodiversity in these ecosystems. Successful restoration
projects should seek to enhance the recovery of native
herbaceous species.
These results demonstrate that restoration treatments that
reduce dominance of the overstory canopy increase total
herbaceous standing crop of the understory in ponderosa pine
forests of northern Arizona. A long-term perspective is required
to assess treatment responses as evidenced by the unique
temporal responses among plant functional groups and the
disproportionate impact of severe drought on C3 compared to
C4 graminoid plant functional groups during the 11-year
investigation. Graminoid standing crop responded within sev-
eral years of the initial treatments and increased over time until
a severe drought reduced standing crop to levels near those
present when the experiment began. C3 graminoids, particularly
bottlebrush squirreltail, dominated this standing-crop response.
C4 graminoids, on the other hand, showed a minimal response
to restoration treatments. The limited response of C4 grami-
noids to restoration treatment may reﬂect their limited abun-
dance at the time of pretreatment. The abundance of this
functional group may have been suppressed because of its
142
Rangeland Ecology & Management

inability to grow and reproduce under dense tree shade.
However, it also appears that C4 graminoids were adversely
affected by autumn burning. Legumes and forbs showed
a signiﬁcant 4–5-year lag before responding to the thinning or
composite treatments. There was a large pulse in annual and
biennial forbs approximately 5 years after experiment initiation,
driven primarily by common mullein, an exotic biennial. The
restoration goal of optimizing herbaceous standing crop must be
weighed against the competing goals of increasing the abun-
dance of speciﬁc functional groups, increasing biodiversity or
rare plants, and managing invasive plant species.
