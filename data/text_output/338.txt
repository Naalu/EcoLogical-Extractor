Abstract. The effect of repeated prescribed burning on 
long term growth of Pinus ponderosa in northern Ari- 
zona was examined. Fire treatments for hazard reduction 
were initiated in 1976, and growth was evaluated in 1988 
for fire rotations of 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 years. 
Dendroecological analysis shows that there were only 
small changes in tree growth (compared to controls) in the 
first few years after the initial fire treatment despite large 
fuel reductions and thinning, and that annual precipita- 
tion was positively correlated with growth. Moderate 
changes in growth relative to that of control trees were 
apparent after 1984. The 1-, 2-, 8-, and 10-year treatments 
had lower growth than controls after this date, while 4- 
and 6-year treatments had slightly higher growth. Al- 
though additional data are needed to determine long term 
growth effects in the longer fire rotations, a fire treatment 
interval of 4 to 6 years appears lo provide adequate fuel 
reduction without reducing long term growth in South- 
western P. ponderosa forests.

Introduction 
Fire is being increasingly used as a management tool 
in both commercial and protecled forest areas (Martin 
and Dell 1978, Sacketl 1980, Sandberg 1980, Hunt and 
Simpson 1985). Prescribed fires can reduce fuel load- 
ing, thereby reducing the probability of subsequent high 
intensity fires (Wagle and Eakle 1979, Covington and 
Sackett 1990, Ffolliott and Guertin 1990, Agee 1993). 
The damaging effects of fire on trees through crown, 
stem, and fine root damage (Wyant et al1983, Ryan and 
Reinhardt 1988, Peterson and Arbaugh 1989, Ryan and 
Steele 1989, Ryan and Frandsen 1991, Peterson et a1 
1991, Swezy and Agee 1991) must be balanced against 
the potential benefits of thinning and nutrient release on 
growth (Covington and Sacketl 1986, 1992; Harris and 
Covington 1983, Reinhardt and Ryan 1988, Sutherland 
and Covington 1987, Oliver and Larson 1990, Sutherland 
et a1 1991). 
Most previous research on the effects of fire on 
conifers has focused on the relationship between physi- 
cal injury and tree survival (Lynch 1959, Methven 
1971, Dieterich 1979, Peterson and Arbaugh 1986, 
Wyant et a1 1985, Ryan and Reinhardt 1988, Ryan et 
a1 1988, Peterson and Arbaugh 1989). Several studies 
have examined the effect of prescribed burning on 
conifer growth, although the results vary widely. Inves- 
tigators have found increases (Morris and Mowat 1958, 
Van Sickle and Hickman 1959, Cooper 1960, Weaver 
1967, Wyant et a1 1983, Reinhardt and Ryan 1988), 
decreases (Wooldridge and Weaver 1965, McCormick 
1976, Landsberg et al. 1984, Johansen and Wade 1987, 
Sutherland 1989, Cochran and Hopkins 1991), or no 
change (McCormick 1976, Waldrop and van Lear 1984, 
Hunt and Simpson 1985) in growth after wildfire or 
prescribed burning treatments in different forest types. 
Most of the studies cited above address short term 
changes in fuel reduction (Sackett 1980, Sandberg 
1980), tree survival, and other site conditions after fire. 
There is little information on the long term effects of 
prescribed burning (Reinhardt and Ryan 1988) or wild- 
fie (Peterson and Ryan 1986, Peterson et a1 1991) on 
growth and productivity. If prescribed burning is to be 
used as a management tool in forests, then information 
on long term growth of the residual stand is needed. 
Data on stand growth as well as fuel reduction must be 
evaluated in ordcr to determine the effectiveness of 
prescribed burning programs. In this study, we evaluate 
the impact of prescribed burning on Pinus ponderosa 
growth in northern Arizona over an 11-year period. 
Specifically we quantify the effect of burns repeated at 
different intervals over time. This will assist in iden- 
tifying an optimal schedule for future prescribed bum 
treatments in this forest type.

Methods 
Study Sites 
The study was conducted in the Chimney Spring 
unit of the Fort Valley Experimental Forest, in the 
Coconino National Forest. This 36-ha unit is located 
11 krn northwest of Flagstaff, Arizona, USA, at 35'16' 
north, 11 1'45' west. The study site is on a southwest- 
facing slope (< 10% throughout), 9 km south of the San 
Francisco Mountains, at a mean elevation of 2260 m. 
Soils are primarily Brolliar stony clay loam, derived 
from volcanic cinders and basalt parent material 
(Meurisse 1971). Climate is cool and dry with mean 
annual precipitation of 55 cm. 
The Chimney Spring unit is virtually undisturbed 
by timber cutting. The last known fire at the site 
occurred in 1876, although the area burned every few 
years prior to European-American settlement (Dieterich 
1980, Dieterich and Swenam 1984). Intensive cattle 
grazing after 1876 prevented tree establishment in the 
area (Harrington and Sackett 1992) until forest reserves 
were created and grazing was reduced about 1910. 
Most of the mature trees that occupy the Chimney 
Spring site today regenerated from the heavy seed 
crops of 1914 and 1919. This unit is the site of a long 
term study designed to determine burning techniques 
adequate to provide continuous fire hazard abatement 
(Sackett 1980). 
The study is comprised of 21 1.1-ha plots, which 
are contiguous with one another. Treatment plots were 
randomly assigned among the 21 plots in 1976 prior to 
the first prescribed fire, which was applied to all plots 
except controls. There are 3 "replications" for plots 
burned at 1-, 2-, 4-. 6-, 8-, and 10-year intervals, 
including 3 unburned plots as "controls" (Table 1). 
These treatment plot designations are to be maintained 
indefinitely. 
Stand structure prior to the start of the study in 1976 
consisted of only one tree species, P. ponderosa, with 
primarily even-aged groups of trees of varying size. 
Mean basal area was 39.7 m2/ha, and mean stem 
density was 4620 stemsha (Table 2). The high stem 
density was comprised primarily of small trees, with 
densities of 970 stemsha for trees 4 . 4  m tall and 2730 
stemsha for trees 1.5-10 cm dbh (Sackett 1980). There 
was considerable variation in basal area and stem 
density among treatment plots prior to prescribed 
burning, although there were no significant differences 
among plots. 
Fuel Loading and Prescribed Fire Treatments 
Bum treatments were conducted on the plots in 
autumn at the appropriate time intervals. Lightning- 
caused fires normally occur in this area between May 
through July when there is substantial atmospheric 
convective activity with lightning, and fuels are dry 
enough to bum. Prescribed fires in autumn generally 
have lower rates of spread and flame lengths than in 
the summer and are less likely to become uncontrolled, 
which is an important management consideration for 
this site. Potential for crown kill in trees is consider- 
ably less in autumn than in late spring and summer 
because buds of P. ponderosa are set and more resistant 
to heating. 
The unit had 33.8 tonnesfha of dead surface and 
ground fuel 12.5 cm in diameter, and 16.0 tonnesha of 
woody fuel >2.5 cm in diameter. The first prescribed 
bum treatments were conducted in November 1976 on 
18 of the plots (with 3 unburned control plots). Rates 
of spread averaged 1.5-2.0 mfmin, and flame lengths 
in litter fuels rarely exceeded 50 cm. Fuel 12.5 cm in 
diameter was reduced to 12.6 tonnesha (63%), with 
greatest reduction in needles and duff. Mineral soil 
was exposed on 16% of the area. Large woody fuel 
(2.5-7.5 cm diameter) was reduced to 4.9 tonnesha 
(54%). Sixty-four percent of all dead organic material 
on the site was consumed by the fire. Many small trees 
(<5 cm dbh) in thickets were killed, resulting in a 
Table 1. Prescribed fire applications over time are indicated (X) for each treatment.

reduction in stem density (Table 2). Very few larger 
trees were killed. Further details of fuel loading and 
burn treatments are found in Sackett (1980). 
Rates-of-spread and fuel consumption varied for 
the subsequent burn treatments, although rate-of-spread 
was usually less than 2 m/min and flame length rarely 
exceeded 50 cm (details of individual fire characteris- 
tics are on file with S. Sackett, USDA Forest Service, 
Riverside, California). The fires removed primarily 
needles and small woody fuel on the surface, and 
mineral soil was not normally exposed. The fires rarely 
killed trees >10 cm dbh. Fire behavior was most 
extreme and fuel reductions greatest (normally all fuels 
accumulated since the last fire) in the 4-year rotations; 
some of the trees in the 4-year rotations were scorched 
in the lower crown. The number of burns that had been 
conducted at the time of sampling (July 1988) is as 
follows for the various treatments (Table 1): control 
(none), 1-year (12), 2-year (6), 4-year (3), 6-year (2), 
8-year (2), 10-year (2). 
Sampling and Measurements 
We used dendroecological methods to evaluate the 
effect of periodic burning on long term tree growth. 
Trees were sampled in each of the 21 plots (7 treat- 
ments, 3 "replicates" per treatment) previously de- 
scribed. 
Transects (10 m wide) were established 
through the center of each plot, and trees were sampled 
starting at one end of the transect. The first 20 trees 
located along the transect that fit the sampling criteria 
were selected to represent growth on each plot. In 
order to be included in the sample, trees were required 
to be codominant or dominant Pinusponderosa > 10 cm 
dbh with no major crown or stem defects (unrelated to 
fire).

Dbh was measured in the field for all sample trees. 
Two cores were extracted with an increment borer from 
the cross-slope sides of each sample tree at breast 
height (1.4 m). Cores were stored in paper straws for 
transport to the laboratory. Current stand structure 
(basal area, stem density) was determined by measur- 
ing dbh for stems >1.4 m tall within five 0.02-ha 
quadrats in each plot. 
Tree cores were mounted in wooden blocks and 
sanded until individual tracheids were visible under the 
microscope. Cores were crossdated (by accurately 
associating each ring with a specific calendar year) 
visually (Stokes and Smiley 1968, Fritts 1976, Swetnam 
et al. 1985) and with the program COFECHA (Holmes 
1983). Ring width was measured to the nearest 0.01 
mm with an incremental measuring machine interfaced 
with a digital encoder and microcomputer to record 
measurements (Robinson and Evans 1980). 
Analysis 
Current stem density and basal area were assessed 
by combining data for all plots within a treatment (data 
for each treatment are based on fifteen 0.02-ha quadrats 
[5 quadrats in each of 3 plots]). Stem density and basal 
area data are also available from 1976, just prior to the 
initiation of prescribed fire treatments. Differences 
among treatments in basal area and total stem density 
were determined with analysis of variance and the 
Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) multiple comparison 
test. Significant differences were identified at the =.05 
level. 
Ring width measurements were used to calculate 
annual basal area increments (BAI) for all tree cores. 
The time series of BAI for individual trees were used 
for all subsequent analyses. Growth trends for the

stem density are indicated by different letters within columns.

different treatments were initially compared visually. 
BAI was plotted over time (1949 to 1987) for all trees 
within each treatment (number of observations ranges 
from 58 to 60 per treatment). BAI was expressed as 
an index for each tree for each year in order to have 
a relative measure of growth that was comparable 
among trees of different sizes and ages: 
BAI, 
BAI index = = 
BMlu 
where BAI, is BAI in year i for tree x, and BAIlu is 
mean BAI for tree x for the period 1949-1987. Mean 
BAI index was calculated and plotted for each treat- 
ment. Differences in growth between fire treatment 
trees and control trees were calculated as:

where B A I @ ~ ~ ,

control trees in a given year. Time series of differences 
between treatment and control tree growth were plotted 
and compared to determine the effects of fire treatments 
on long term growth. Differences in growth between 
different time periods were compared with ANOVA and 
the SNK test. 
Results and Discussion 
Stand and Sample Characteristics 
Current stand basal area is lower than controls for 
all fire treatments except the 1-year treatment (Table 
2); the SNK test indicates these differences 'are not 
significant at a=.05, although ANOVA indicates a 
significant difference among treatments (F=2.21, 
prob.>F=.05) 
Current total stem density is higher 
(although not always significantly) in control plots than 
in all treatments except the 4-year treatment. Most of 
the differences in stem density among treatments are 
accounted for by differences in the number of stems 
4 0  cm dbh; there are few differences among treat- 
ments for stems >20 cm dbh. Only 3 trees >60 cm dbh 
were sampled in any of the stand structure quadrats at 
the study site. 
Current stem densities are approximately 40% of 
stem density in 1976 prior to the initiation of fire 
treatments (Table 2); this proportion is remarkably 
consistent among treatments and controls, although 
absolute numbers vary. Most of the reduction in stem 
density on treatment plots occurred in stems <5 cm dbh 
after the first fire (Sackett 1980, Sackett unpublished 
data), although the large decrease in stem density on

control plots indicates there may have been additional 
mortality due to competition and other non-pyrogenic 
causes. Basal area has remained relatively constant or 
increased over time in both treatment and control trees. 
Characteristics of sample trees are relatively homo- 
geneous across all treatments (Table 3). Mean dbh has 
a narrow range of only 28.8 to 34.4 cm, and tree age 
at dbh is also uniform across all treatments. The 
uniformity of size and age minimizes the possibility 
that between-treatment variation in tree growth is 
caused by differences in sample tree characteristics. 
Effects of Prescribed Fire Treatments on Tree Growth 
There was a substantial decrease in growth in all 
treatments (including controls) in 1977, the year after 
the first prescribed burn treatment. Precipitation was 
extremely low in this year (Figure 1, U.S. Department 
of Agriculture weather data for Fort Valley Experimen- 
tal Forest). Pinus ponderosa growth is positively 
correlated with soil moisture at most locations in 
western North America (Fritts 1974, Peterson and 
Arbaugh 1988, Peterson et al. 1991), so it is logical that 
growth tracks precipitation patterns to some extent.

Unfortunately the occurrence of low precipitation the 
year after the first fire treatment makes it difficult to 
differentiate the initial effect of fire from that of 
climate. The occurrence of a large growth decrease in 
both treatment and control trees in 1977 (Figures 2-4) 
suggests that climate was the dominant factor affecting 
growth immediately after the fire. In fact, growth 
patterns of treatment and control trees (Figures 2-4) are 
clearly correlated with precipitation patterns (Figure 1) 
until about 1984. 
Crown scorch and cambial injury to trees 110 cm 
dbh were minimal (Sackett 1980), so reduced photo- 
synthesis or translocation are unlikely causes of the 
growth decrease. Previous studies have shown that 
prescribed burning can damage the fine roots of pinus 
ponderosa, causing decreased postfire survival (Swezy 
and Agee 1991) and growth (Grier 1989). However, 
mineral soil exposure was minimal on all fires (maxi-

mum of 16% after the first fire treatment), so root 
damage is unlikely. Standard deviations of BAI growth 
are higher in the fire treatments than in the controls 
during 1977-1978, which indicates variation in indi- 
vidual tree growth response to the fire (Biondi et al. 
1992). Standard deviations are similar LO those of 
controls thereafter, which suggests that subsequent 
fires had little influence on the variation in growth 
response within treatments. 
Growth expressed as time series of BAI index 
values (see Equation 1) is displayed in Figures 2-4 for 
fire treatment and control trees. It can be seen that 
interannual growth patterns of treatment and control 
trees are similar over time, with only small differences 
between treatment and control trees after the initiation 
of fire treatments in 1976. Only data for 1949- 1987 are 
shown in the figures because growth prior to this time 
was predominantly juvenile growth characterized by a 
steady increase in BAI. 
Figure 3. Time series of BAI index for 4-year and 6-year fire 
rotation treatment trees and control trees. 
Plots of BAI index values (Figures 2-4) make it 
difficult to discern fire treatment impacts after 1976 
because of variation throughout the time series. An 
alternative approach of assessing growth patterns is to 
more closely examine "difference from control" (see 
Equation 2) for each of the fire treatments (Figure 5). 
This analysis shows that all fie treatment groups have 
negative values (that is, growth was less than in control 
trees) in 1977 and 1978, which suggests a possible 
effect of the initial fire beyond the growth decrease 
caused by low precipitation (Figure 1). Difference 
from control was mostly positive (that is, growth was 
greater than in control trees) for all treatments from 
1980 through 1983. 
After 1984, difference from 
control remained mostly positive for 4-year and 6-year 
fire treatments but was negative for 1-year, 2-year, 8- 
year, and 10-year treatments. 
It is unclear why there was a similar decrease in 
growth for several of the treatments. The effect of fire 
in 1984 could be related to some of the decreases if 
there were damage to fine roots (Grier 1989, Swezy

and Agee 1991) or changes in site fertility gandsberg 
et al. 1984, Cochran and Hopkins 1991). However, the 
4-year treatment was burned in 1984 as well, but did 
not have a decrease in growth. 
Statistical analysis shows that differences in BAI 
growth among fire treatments are marginally signifi- 
cant for the entire 1 1-year period (1977-1987) after the 
first prescribed fire (Table 4). Graphical presentation 
of the data appears to indicate that postfire growth was 
greater in the 4- and 6-year burns than in unburned 
control stands and other fire treatments (Figure 5), 
although this contrast in growth was not manifested 
until 8 years after the initial prescribed fire. ANOVA 
results confirm differences among treatments in growth 
after 1984 (Table 4), although the SNK test suggests 
that only the 4-year fire treatment differs significantly 
(a=.05) from other treatments. A combination of 
graphical and statistical results indicate that growth 
after 1984 was clearly greater for the 4-year treatment 
than other treatments; growth was also greater for the 
6-year treatment, but differences cannot be stated as 
confidently. 
A postfire growth increase might be expected as a 
result of thinning (Reinhardt and Ryan 1988, Oliver 
and Larson 1990, Peterson et al. 1991, Sutherland et al. 
1991). Stem density in 4-year and 6-year treatments 
in 1988 was 40% of pre-fire density in 1976 qable 2). 
Other fire treatments had similar percentage (but dif- 
ferent absolute) decreases in stem density, but appeared 
to have growth decreases after 1984 (Fiigure 5). Analy- 
sis of thinning impacts is confounded somewhat by 
differences in absolute stem densities between treat- 
ment and control plots. Although thinning may be 
partly related to the different growth patterns, the 
relationship between stem density and long term growth 
is not consistent. 
Previous studies of the effects of fire in Pinus 
ponderosa forests of Arizona have documented a trans- 
fer of nutrients from the forest floor to the mineral soil 
(Covington and Sackett 1984, 1990, 1992). Transfers 
of nitrogen are especially large, and increased nitrogen 
in the mineral soil can be measured several years after 
fire (Harris and Covington 1983, Covington and Sackett 
1986). Increased concentrations of inorganic nitrogen, 
primarily NH,-N, greatly enhance short-term soil fer- 
tility at the study site (Covington and Sackett 1990, 
1992). However, the relative impact of postfire nutrient 
availability on tree growth is difficult to determine. 
Perhaps burning at 4- and 6-year intervals produces a 
combination of soil fertility, soil moisture (Covington 
and Sackett 1990), and reduced understory competition 
that is more favorable (or less detrimental) for tree 
growth conditions associated with other burning inter- 
vals. 
It is unclear why different growth patterns among 
treatments were not manifested until after 1984 (Figure 
5). Four of the treatments were burned in this year, 
including 3 treatments with growth decreases (I-, 2-, 
and %year) and 1 without decreases (4-year). One of 
the treatments not burned in 1984 (10-year) also had 
growth decreases. The response of Pinus ponderosa 
growth to fire is apparently complex, despite the fact 
that the sample appears to be relatively homogeneous 
and the study site contains little variation in slope, 
aspect, and soils. 
A better understanding of the 
possible interactive effects of fire and climate may be

- The Effects of Repeated Prescribed Burning on Pinus ponderosa Growth - 
critical for interpreting long term tree growth trends. 
Studies of the effects of prescribed fire on P. ponderosa 
growth in Oregon have suggested that repeated fire can 
reduce long term site productivity and tree growth 
(Landsberg et al. 1984, Cochran and Hopkins 1991), 
although the studies were conducted on low fertility 
ash and pumice soils. There may be some factors 
related to soil properties or other environmental fea- 
tures not considered in this study, such as fine root 
damage (Grier 1989, Swezy and Agee 1991, Agee 
1993), that account for a substantial portion of the 
variation in growth over time (Biondi et al. 1992). 
Despite the lack of direct causation between fire 
and tree growth response, there are some general 
inferences that can be made. The use of prescribed fire 
at intervals of 4 to 6 years in Pinus ponderosa forests 
in Arizona appears to effectively reduce fuels without 
detrimental impacts on tree growth. More frequent or 
less frequent fires could result in reduced long term 
growth. In addition, fires that were conducted at 4- and 
6-year intervals at the Chimney Spring study site 
provided better fuel consumption than fires at other 
intervals-perhaps 
because of a more continuous 
fuelbed-without producing fireline intensities or flame 
lengths that would injure trees (Harrington and Sackett 
1990, Sackett unpublished data). 
Previous studies in this region have demonstrated 
that periodic use of prescribed fire can effectively 
reduce fuel accumulation and wildfire hazard (Ffolliott 
and Guertin 1990, Harrington and Sacktt 1990). If 
prescribed fire is used in Southwestern Pinus pon- 
derosa forests at intervals of 4 to 6 years, then it should 
be possible to attain the multiple management objec- 
tives of reducing fuels, eliminating understory vegeta- 
tion, and maintaining adequate growth rates in the 
forest overstory. Longer term analysis of data from our 
study site and other locations is needed to provide a 
stronger basis for recommending appropriate intervals 
for prescribed burning in P. ponderosa forests.
