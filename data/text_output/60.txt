ABSTRACT 
Sutherland, E.K., Covington, W.W. and Andariese, S., 1991. A model of ponderosa pine growth re- 
sponse to prescribed burning. For. Ecol. Manage., 44:16 l-173. 
Our objective was to model the radial growth response of individual ponderosa pines to prescribed 
burning in northern Arizona. We sampled 188 trees from two study areas, which were burned in 1976. 
Within each study area, control and burned trees were of similar age, vigor, height, and competition 
index. At Chimney Spring, trees were older, less vigorous, and taller and had a higher competition 
index than at Brannigan. For each tree, periodic basal area increment (PBA1) was calculated for the 
years 1974-1984. To determine which variable would best model growth, post-fire growth (1977- 
1984 ) was correlated with the 3 year average of previous growth, crown ratio, competition index, and 
diameter. 
Post-fire growth response was modeled using stepwise multiple linear regression as a function of 
previous growth and indicator variables for treatment, treatment-site interaction, climatic variation, 
and treatment-year interaction. Independent variables of the final model included previous growth, 
climatic variation, and treatment-year interaction (r2= 0.72). Model coefficients indicated that fire 
affected growth significantly and negatively for 2 years, and then burned trees grew similarly to con- 
trol trees. Differences in management history at the two sites did not affect growth after fire. We 
propose a linear aggregate model of variables controlling radial growth response of southwestern pon- 
derosa pines to fire. 
INTRODUCTION 
Use of fire as a management tool is gaining increased importance in both 
wildland and managed forests. Fires are prescribed primarily to reduce fuel 
loading and hence the probability of uncontrolled, catastrophic fires, but they 
are also advocated to promote nutrient release and thinning. Determining the 
effect of prescribed fire on tree growth and productivity is important to man- 
agers and researchers alike. 
Many environmental and treatment-related factors can affect growth re-

sponse, and not surprisingly, studies of wild and prescribed fire effects on 
ponderosa pine growth have yielded contradictory results (Morris and 
Mowat, 1958; Lynch, 1959; Van Sickle and Hickmann, 1959; Wooldridge and 
Weaver, 1965; Pearson et al., 1972; Wyant et al., 1983; Landsberg et al., 1984); 
the response depended on how much damage the trees sustained or how their 
environment was affected. 
The objective of this study was to delineate the factors that can affect growth 
response to prescribe fired, develop a mathematical model for predicting 
growth response to prescribed burning, and derive parameter estimates for 
southwestern ponderosa pine. (The resulting model is specific for ponderosa 
pine growing on basalt soil in the Flagstaff, Arizona, area. ) 
STUDY AREA HISTORIES AND CHARACTERISTICS 
The two study areas, Chimney Spring and Brannigan Flat, are located 9 km 
apart, within the interior ponderosa pine type (Eyre, 1980) north of Flags- 
taff, Arizona. The stands are essentially monotypic. Both areas were pre- 
scribed burned in 1976 and have control plots within 500 m of burned areas. 
Soils are stony clay loams derived from volcanic cinders and basalt (Meu- 
risse, 1971 ), and both areas are nearly flat (0-5% slope). The climate is cool 
and dry (Schubert, 1974). 
Chimney Spring is a unit of the Forth Valley Experimental Forest, l 0 km 
north of Flagstaff, at about 2270 m elevation. The overstory consists of un- 
even-aged ponderosa pine in groups (White, 1985 ). Dense thickets of young 
trees, less than or approximately equal to 70 years of age, occupy what were 
previously open areas between groups of mature trees. Chimney Spring has 
never been logged; however, it was grazed until 1926 (Pearson, 1933 ). Before 
Anglo-American settlement, Chimney Spring burned every 2-3 years, and the 
last fire occurred in 1876 (Dieterich, 1980). Chimney Spring has been the 
site of a prescribed fire research experiment since 1976; overall research de- 
sign and objectives as well as fuel and burning conditions have been described 
by Sackett (1980) and Covington and Sackett (1986). 
Brannigan Flat is more representative of managed ponderosa pine forests 
in northern Arizona. It lies within the Coconino National Forest, at about 
2220 m elevation. Silvicultural records (Flagstaff District Ranger Office, Co- 
conino National Forest, N. Highway 89, Flagstaff, AZ, 86004) indicate that 
Brannigan Flat was partially harvested in 1908, 1952, and 1971. The stand 
consists of pole-sized timber with an overstory of mature sawtimber growing 
in clumps. Brannigan Flat was precommercially thinned in 1974 (trees of less 
than l 0 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) were cut ), and the slash lopped 
and scattered. No records were available concerning the date of burning or 
burning conditions. 

PONDEROSA PINE GROWTH RESPONSE TO BURNING

METHODS 
Chimney Spring was sampled in autumn 1984 and 1985, and Brannigan 
Flat in autumn 1985. At both sites, subject trees were selected along a belt 
transect 20 m wide, but transect length varied. All transects ran southeast to 
northwest. At Chimney Spring, the study plots were 1 ha in size ( 100 m each 
side) and we sampled two control and two once-burned plots. No plot was 
more than 500 m distant from any other plot, and transects were 70 m long. 
An unsampled buffer zone 12 m wide was established inside plot perimeters 
to avoid effects from adjacent treatments. When there were insufficient trees 
to sample in the transect itself, subject trees were chosen near the transect, 
but not in the buffer zone (this occurred no more than five times per plot). 
At Brannigan Flat, a control area (150 m× 150 m) had been established 
before the fire. Both belt transects were 100 m long and had a 30 m buffer 
zone and the burned transect began 30 m north of the control area fireline. 
Three diameter classes of trees were sampled: 20.3-30.5 cm DBH, more 
than 30.5-40.6 cm DBH and more than 40.6 cm DBH. On each transect, 50 
trees in the size classes less than 40.6 cm DBH were numbered and chosen as 
a preliminary set. Only trees which met the following criteria were sampled: 
single bole (no forked trees ), normal-appearing crown ( no deformities indic- 
ative of disease or damage), no unusually heavy branching patterns, no visi- 
ble insect or mistletoe infestation, and no apparent fire or lightning scars. 
From these 50 trees, 15 subject trees in the smaller size classes were selected 
randomly. Trees of more than 40.6 cm DBH were relatively rare, and vir- 
tually all trees on the plots that fit the criteria were selected (minimum 15 ). 
At each site, at least 45 trees were sampled in each treatment ( 188 for the 
entire study). 
Data measured and recorded on each tree included DBH, total tree height 
to base of crown (crown base was defined as the height of the lowest green 
foliage), estimated competition from other ponderosa pines, and radial 
growth. Increment ones (two per tree) were taken at breast height 180 o from 
each other if possible, and if not (e.g. a branch or branch scar was in the way ), 
at least 90 o from each other. 
To estimate competition around subject trees, DBH of all trees that were 
sighted within a 2.3 m 2 ha- 1 basal area factor wedge prism was measured with 
a diameter tape. Because fire-caused thinning occured, we also measured DBH 
of trees that died from the fire to estimate a thinning index as well as pre-burn 
competition. 
Increment cores were prepared and crossdated using techniques described 
by Stokes and Smiley ( 1968 ). Growth rings were measured to 0.01 mm (Ro- 
binson and Evans, 1980). 
The expression of growth used in this study is periodic basal area increment 
(PBAI (cm2); Avery and Burkhart, 1983). Annual PBAI estimates were de- 

164 
E.K. SUTHERLAND ET AL. 
rived from the raw ring widths of a given year's growth using the average of 
two cores per tree, and the tree's diameter during any known year. 
A dimensionless index of competition was calculated for each tree. Simi- 
larly, a thinning index was also calculated for the burned, dead trees around 
each subject tree, to quantify fire-related thinning. Competing trees were de- 
fined as those trees sighted in the prism within a distance of 40 times the 
subject tree diameter (Sutherland, 1989 ). Competition before the fire on the 
burned plots was estimated by adding to the data the diameters of trees that 
died from fire. The index used was 
n 
( ~D/)/Di 
(1) 
j=l 
where Di is the diameter of subject tree for i trees, and Dj is the diameter of 
the jth competing tree. 
Descriptive statistics (range, mean and standard deviation) were calcu- 
lated for tree heights, crown ratios (crown length/tree height), tree ages (es- 
timated to within 5 years), and competition indices. Distribution of these 
tree descriptors were compared using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) two- 
sample test (Gibbons, 1976, p. 250). 
In a series of simple linear regressions we correlated competition index, 
thinning index, crown ratio, diameter, previous growth, and growth since fire 
to determine which variable was most strongly correlated with growth since 
fire, to determine the relationships among variables, and to assess 
multicollinearity. 
The data were tested for constancy of error variance over all observations 
and were natural logarithm-transformed where necessary (Neter et al., 1985, 
p. 615). 
We used binary indicator variables to account for other potential sources 
of variation in post-fire growth. Climatic variation contributes significantly 
to growth variance in southwestern ponderosa pine (Fritts, 1976); we ac- 
counted for climatic variation effects with seven binary indicator variables 
(for each year since burning). We also used binary indicators for treatment 
effects, treatment-site interactions (treatment response caused by site differ- 
ences), and treatment-year interactions (treatment response associated with 
time since burning). 
We used one-half of the data set to develop models and reserved the other 
half to validate them, by assigning alternate trees to each set. The multiple 
linear regressions were performed with the development data set using a step- 
wise search procedure (P<0.05, F to include; Neter et al., 1985, pp. 430- 
431 ). 
The regression coefficients were applied to the validation data set to predict 
growth each year after burning and the ratio of predicted residual mean square

to observed residual mean square was assessed for difference from perfect 
agreement (a ratio of 1.0). 
RESU LTS 
Statistics describing tree heights, crown ratios, estimated tree age, and di- 
ameters for both sizes are given in Table 1. Distributions of all descriptive 
variables (tree height, crown ratio, tree age, and competition index) are sim- 
ilar for burned and unburned plots, within sites (Dmax < D, P< 0.05 ). HOW- 
ever, in comparing the descriptors between sites, there are differences in all 
distributions (Dmax>D, P> 0.05). The data indicate that compared with 
Chimney Spring, trees at Brannigan were shorter, had larger crown ratios, 
were younger, and had lower competition indices. 
Correlations between the quantitative variables are given in Table 2. Pre- 
vious growth was most strongly correlated with growth since fire, and was also 
significantly correlated with all other variables. 
Not surprisingly, previous growth, competition index, crown ratio, and DBH 
were all significantly correlated with each other. All correlations were positive 
except for those related to competition indices. Crown ratio (vigor) and com- 
petition index were inversely and significantly related to each other; more 
vigorous trees grew in relatively less dense stands. Diameter was positively 
correlated with crown ratio and negatively with competition index; small trees 
with low crown ratios were in relatively dense stands, whereas large trees with 
high crown ratios had relatively less competition. Correlations between growth

and diameter indicate that as tree size increased, growth before and after 
burning increased; large trees had relatively larger PBAI. 
Thinning index was not significantly related to post-fire growth. Perhaps 
the fires did not cause enough thinning to affect post-fire growth, or the thin- 
ning offset damage from fire, resulting in no apparent overall effect. How- 
ever, as there was no statistically significant relationship between fire-caused 
thinning and growth, thinning index was not included in any further analysis. 
Of the other variables, previous growth, competition index, and crown ra- 
tio were significantly correlated with change in competition as a result of 
burning. The positive relationship between competition index and thinning 
index was reasonable; trees in dense stands are often suppressed and weak, 
and may be more susceptible to fatal damage from fire. Harrington (1987) 
found that smaller trees, the usual occupants of dense stands of southwestern 
ponderosa pine, were more susceptible to death from burning than larger, 
more open-grown trees. This may, in fact, partially explain why there was no 
relationship between thinning index and post-fire growth; the small trees that 
died were probably not effective competitors with the subject trees. Because 
there was no difference between lowest green foliage height distributions in 
control and burned trees at Chimney Spring or at Brannigan Flat (Ornax < D, 
P> 0.05 ), foliage loss was not considered as a potential variable. Similarly, 
thinning index was not included as an independent variable as there was not 
a significant relationship between this index and growth after burning. Crown 
ratio, competition index, and DBH were significantly correlated with pre- 
vious growth, so, to avoid inferential problems associated with multicolli- 
nearity, we did not consider them in the model. 
Using only the development data set, the dependent variable was individ- 
ual tree In (post-fire growth ) of each year since burning, and the initial inde- 
pendent variable was previous growth. Stepwise addition of variables re- 
suited in the following model (from the development data set only ):

where PFG is post-fire growth, PRG is previous growth, Y 1 is year I after fire 
( 1977 )...Y7 is year 7 after fire ( 1983 ), TY is treatment-year interaction, and 
the intercept, flo, took into account year 8 ( 1984); variables with an asterisk 
indicate significant t-values for the coefficients (P< 0.05 ). Inclusion of treat- 
ment and treatment-site interactions did not add to explicable variance. 
Significant autocorrelation (r~=0.567, Durbin-Watson statistic 0.865, 
P< 0.05 ) implied an important relationship between growth of one year and 
the following year, effectively reducing the model degrees of freedom. We es- 
timated the effective degrees of freedom (N') as 
N'=N(l-rl)/(l+rl) 
(Mitchell et al., 1966) where N= 88 trees X 8 years = 704 and N'= 194. The 
F-value of the final model was 118.952 (P<0.001). Overall, the model ex- 
plained 72% of total growth variance since burning (adjusted multiple 
r2=0.722). 
Some of the coefficients associated with sets of variables (years and treat- 
ment-year interactions) did not have significant t-values, but were not 
dropped from the equation. These coefficients represented categories which 
were being compared with each other to assess for differential effects (Nie et 
al., 1975), and because significant autocorrelation existed, and the years 
themselves could not be considered separately (Neter et al., 1985, pp. 444- 
448). 
Signs of the estimated coefficients were as expected; the relationship be- 
tween In (PRG) and In (PFG) was positive. Signs of the years-since-burning 
coefficients fluctuated, as might be expected, with climatic variation. Annual 
precipitation and temperature for Flagstaff for the hydrologic years ( 1 Octo- 
ber-30 September) 1977-1984 (National Oceanographic and Atmospheric 
Administration, 1984) are plotted in Fig. 1. Water availability limits ponde- 
rosa pine growth (Fritts, 1976, pp. 240-241 ), and we would expect low growth 
during drought years (low precipitation, often with high temperatures ). The 
coefficient for year 1 after burning (1977) was relatively large and negative; 
although temperature was below average, precipitation was far below aver- 
age. Years 3 and 4 (1979 and 1980) had significant, positive coefficients, 
when years were cool and wet. 
Over the entire time period, there was no significant treatment effect, but 
treatment-year interactions indicated that growth responded to treatment with 
time. The treatment-year interaction was significant and negative for 2 years

immediately after fire. No other treatment-year interaction coefficients were 
significant, but they gradually became less negative and varied around zero. 
This growth response to burning is illustrated in Fig. 2. For the first three 

PONDEROSA PINE GROWTH RESPONSE TO BURNING 
169 
years after the fires (1977-1979), coefficients were negative, but less nega- 
tive with each succeeding year. By year 4 (1980), the values had apparently 
stabilized, and varied around zero. Autocorrelation in the series effectively 
smoothed this curve; without it, the year 1 (1977) value would probably be 
more negative, and one or more values after year 4 (1980) might be positive. 
However, the curve as it is and the t-values of the coefficients show that there 
were early, negative effects of burning on ponderosa pine growth, but these 
effects were short lived (only 3 years). Reinhardt and Ryan (1988 ) found a 
similar response in prescribed-burned Larix occidentalis, where negative ef- 
fects lasted only 1 year and growth significantly increased for 4 years. 
This model validated well. The residual mean square of the equation was 
0.1243. The mean square of values of the validation data set minus values 
predicted from the model was 0.1290. These mean squares have a ratio very 
close to one (1.04), which means that the model adequately predicted the 
validation data set (Snee, 1977). 
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
The strong and positive relationship between previous growth and post-fire 
growth suggests that factors affecting tree growth rate before the fire contin- 
ued to affect post-fire growth; trees that grew well before the fire grew well 
after the fire. Trees that grew well had fewer competitors, were large, and had 
high crown ratios. 
Management history did not affect growth response to burning (indicated 
by non-significant contribution of site-treatment interaction to explained 
variance ). The two study areas had different management histories: Chimney 
Spring was protected from logging and grazing, whereas Brannigan Flat was 
grazed continually since settlement, logged several times, and thinned before 
burning. In this case, differences in management history resulted in different 
competition levels, and the correlation analysis indicated an inverse relation- 
ship between post-fire growth and competition. Chimney Spring had signifi- 
cantly higher competition levels than Brannigan Flat. The fact that site-treat- 
ment interaction is not an important contributor to growth variance implied 
that, in this case, management history itself is not an important factor in de- 
termining growth response to burning. Thus, the important difference be- 
tween the study areas was stand density, and not thinning history. 
The results from the model suggest that there was a significant decrease in 
growth of burned trees for 2 years at both study areas (Fig. 2). After that, 
burned-tree growth stabilized and was similar to that of control trees. There 
were no significant positive growth effects on burned trees in the 8 years after 
fire. Similarly, Chambers et al. ( 1986 ) noted that, in general, conifer growth 
recovery after burning occurred within 2-3 years. 
What fire-related factor(s) were responsible for the observed growth re-

sponse? Increased stem growth proportional to fire-related thinning in pon- 
derosa pine has been noted by Morris and Mowat (1958), Lynch (1959), 
Van Sickle and Hickman (1959), and Pearson et al. (1972). In our study, 
however, stand density was high, and little thinning occurred; Schubert ( 1971 ) 
noted that under high stand density conditions, southwestern ponderosa pine 
responds slowly to thinning. 
Other studies have found foliage loss to be an important determinant of 
growth response to burning. Pearson et al. ( 1972 ) found that, after an Ari- 
zona wildfire, trees with less than 60% foliage exhibited increased growth. 
Alternatively, Wyant et al. ( 1983 ) attributed an increase in shoot growth to 
removal of lower, less efficient foliage, and improved photosynthetic effi- 
ciency. We inferred from lowest green foliage height comparison that there 
was probably no significant foliage loss after the fire at our sites, so foliage 
loss was not a likely contributing factor to decreased growth. 
The effect of cambial damage on growth of burned ponderosa pine trees 
has not been studied, but could reasonably contribute to decreased growth 
after burning. Mortality has been related to severe bole burning in ponderosa 
pine (Lynch, 1959; Wyant et al., 1986). Ryan et al. (1988) found that the 
number of dead cambium samples in Pseudotsuga menziesii trees was the most 
important predictor of mortality after prescribed burning. In our initial sam- 
piing, trees with fire scars or bark sloughing were excluded from the sample, 
which eliminated the most severely damaged trees. The correlation analysis 
showed a positive relationship between post-fire annual growth and diameter. 
This result could have occurred because larger trees generally have thicker 
bark, and bark insulates cambium from heat. Cambial damage probably oc- 
curred to smaller trees. 
Trees may have experienced root damage from the fires. The fire at Chim- 
ney Spring was observed to be of low intensity but of localized long duration; 
some deep organic debris smoldered for 2-3 days (Sackett, 1980). Low heat- 
ing over a long period of time could kill shallow roots (Hare, 1961 ). Cham- 
bers et al. (1986) noted that these roots, usually fine feeder roots, should 
quickly regenerate in a healthy tree, during favorable environmental condi- 
tions. Notably, the year after the fire in this study (1977) was an extreme 
drought year. These conditions would not have favored quick root recovery. 
No factor that we could measure appeared to be responsible for the ob- 
served lower basal area growth for the first few years after burning. In fact, 
improved nutrient relations (Harris and Covington, 1983; Covington and 
Sackett, 1986; Ryan and Covington, 1986) and water availability (Haase, 
1986 ) should have contributed positively to growth. However, where fire did 
cause cambial and root damage, nutrient and water uptake could have been 
inhibited (especially under drought conditions ), and trees may have directed 
available photosynthates to repair, not new cambial growth. Of all woody tis- 
sue, cambium has the lowest priority for photosynthate allocation (Waring, 

PONDEROSA PINE GROWTH RESPONSE TO BURNING 
17 1 
1983). Four years after the fire, nutrient levels were similar to those before 
the fire, so perhaps when damage was repaired, the cambium could not ben- 
efit from the nutrient pulse. In any case, growth was more limited by negative 
factors than promoting factors for the first years after the fire. 
Our study areas were burned with a single prescribed fire after a century of 
fire exclusion; response to burning may be different following repeated fires. 
There should be less fuel, particularly by the third fire, as the first fire may 
produce even more fuel than existed before the initial fire (Sackett, 1980). 
Thinning from fire should decrease with each successive fire, as weak individ- 
uals die. If nutrient release continues to occur with repeated burns, as indi- 
cated by Covington and Sackett ( 1986 ), then stem growth may increase. A 
study of growth in areas repeatedly burned should clarify these questions. 
The results of this study are clear, although the mechanisms causing them 
are not yet conclusively resolved. Although we attempted to eliminate and 
account for factors related and unrelated to fire that affect growth, we found 
that there were important potential fire-related factors, that, 8 years after the 
fire, we could not directly measure or relate to growth (for example, foliage 
loss, change nutrient relations, and root damage). From literature cited ear- 
lier in this paper, and our results, we propose the following linear aggregate 
model for southwestern ponderosa pine growth response to fire in the ith year 
of n years since burning: 
PFGi = PC+ CD + RD+ FL+TI+ 8N+ 8W+Yi +TY, 
where PFG is post-fire growth, PC is the previous condition, CD is cambial 
damage, RD is root damage, FL is foliage loss, TI is thinning, 8N is change in 
nutrient availability, 8W is change in water availability, Y is an indicator for 
year since burning, to account for climatic variability, and TY is an indicator 
for treatment-year interaction, to account for response and recovery. Coeffi- 
cients would indicate the proportional post-fire growth limitation of given 
variables. The signs of the coefficients are predictable. Sign of the previous 
condition coefficient could be positive or negative, root and cambial damage 
would always be negative, foliage loss could be negative or positive, nutrient 
and water availability losses would probably be positive, and sign of the year 
coefficient would depend on climate for that year. 
Studies of growth response to fire (or indeed, any environmental distur- 
bance) must delineate and factor out the general and site-specific variables 
related and unrelated to treatment than can affect tree growth. Only then can 
fire effects be quantified, and appropriate fire management programs 
implemented.
