Introduction
This guide was developed specifically for use by schools, teachers, and project leaders
involved with ecological monitoring of Collaborative Forest Restoration Program
projects. It was designed to provide background information, lessons and activities that
relate directly to monitoring goals. It can also be used by other educators interested in
teaching students about ecological concepts relevant to the Southwest.
Monitoring Forest Restoration Projects
Southwest forests have changed dramatically in the last century. As people have reduced
the number and frequency of fires in the forest, many changes have occurred, including
increased density of small trees, changes in species composition, more continuous tree
canopies, and the encroachment of trees into meadows. Many of these changes increase
the risk of high-intensity wildfires as well as having other
ecological effects. The Collaborative Forest Restoration
Program (CFRP) was created to bring communities, agencies,
environmental groups, and micro-enterprises together to
design projects that can restore forest conditions.
Monitoring is an essential part of the Collaborative Forest
Restoration Program because it provides reliable feedback on
the effects of a project. Monitoring involves repeated
measurements over time to determine if actions have caused
expected or unexpected changes. As opposed to casual
observation, monitoring is designed to help identify changes
and determine whether these changes are due to our actions.
The information gained from monitoring can help forest
managers, scientists, and practitioners learn more about how their projects are working
and to adapt treatments or plans along the way so that they better meet project goals.
The multiparty process is used because it allows a more diverse group of people to have a
say in whether or not a project is having the desired effects. For more information on the
multiparty monitoring process, see CFRP Monitoring Handbook 1.
Involving Schools and Youth in Monitoring
The Collaborative Forest Restoration Program also calls for projects to involve young
people in some aspect of restoration. Many projects do this by incorporating youth into
monitoring efforts. Involving youth in monitoring provides an excellent opportunity for
“hands-on,”“minds-on” learning, helps develop local stewardship, and plants a seed for
long-term involvement and interest in the health of local ecosystems. Through
Multiparty Monitoring
involves diverse groups of
people—individuals, schools,
community groups, agencies,
and local, regional or
national organizations—in
assessing changes that
come from a project.

monitoring, youth can learn many aspects of science, including basic forest ecology,
observation and measurement skills, problem solving, and how people are currently
influencing the forests where they live. These concepts are part of national and state
standards for science literacy. Such literacy includes not just the understanding of
scientific concepts, but also the role of science in society. Involving students in the
monitoring of CFRP projects is an excellent way to achieve both.
What This Guide Is Intended to Do
This guide was developed specifically for use by schools, teachers, and project leaders
involved with ecological monitoring of Collaborative Forest Restoration Program
projects. It was designed to provide background information, lessons and activities that
relate directly to monitoring goals. It can also be used by any educators interested in
teaching students about ecological concepts relevant to the Southwest. There are many
other relevant resources for educators, particularly the FireWorks curriculum developed
by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Project Learning Tree Environmental Education
Activity Guide from the American Forest Foundation, and the Bosque Education Guide,
produced by the Rio Grande Nature Center. A list of these and other references and
educational resources are included in Appendix 2.
This guide provides background information and classroom and field activities that
educators may use with students or youth crews involved in restoration projects. By
involving young people in resource management issues, this guide seeks to increase
students’ understanding of the following:
•
Basic principles of forest restoration
•
Physical science of forest fires in ponderosa pine forests
•
The diversity of plants and animals within an ecosystem
•
Natural changes in ecosystems over time
•
How people in the past have influenced the ecosystems where they live
•
How people are currently trying to influence the ecosystems where they live
•
The importance of monitoring any restoration or management effort
•
Scientific principles of observation, measurement and evaluation
This guide is organized according to the monitoring goals and indicators of many CFRP
projects. An introductory section provides background on these goals. A subsequent
section provides activities for the classroom and field. The first several activities provide
students with background information and concepts necessary to understand monitoring
goals and data. Subsequent activities allow students to gather and interpret data related
to monitoring of a specific project. There are also four appendices:
•
Appendix 1 gives short activities that can be added to field trips to improve
student observation skills
•
Appendix 2 provides a list of references and educational resources 
•
Appendix 3 gives a glossary of terms used throughout the text
•
Appendix 4 provides links between activities and educational standards

Integrating School Activities and the CFRP Project
When getting started, teachers, project managers, and others involved with a CFRP
project should meet a few times in order to coordinate what will be monitored, when,
and by whom. This will help teachers to plan appropriate activities and the timing of
their delivery. It also will be helpful for teachers to review CFRP Monitoring Handbook
4, which provides in-depth information about ecological goals and methods to monitor
CFRP projects.
Many teachers have difficulty arranging student field trips for more than 1-2 days per
year. It should be possible for teachers and CFRP project managers to choose activities
that correspond with monitoring goals so that classroom exercises can precede field days.
Field trips with a school classroom or education days with a youth crew require advanced
preparation and planning. Some things to think about, and sometimes budget for,
include:
•
Give informational letters to parents prior to any field trip, including items
that students will need to bring with them on the day of the trip. This may
include sunscreen, hats, long pants and long sleeves, appropriate shoes, and
plenty of water. Most youth crews will be accustomed to bringing these
items with them each day.
•
Arrange transportation to and from the site. Make sure to allow adequate
time for travel.
•
Arrange for sack lunches from the school for all students, or have youth
crews bring their lunch.
•
Send out and collect permission slips prior to a school field trip. Bring
emergency contacts for students on the field trip.
•
Visit the site before bringing any youth to the field so that teachers and
others are familiar with the site.
•
Prepare all lessons and activities in advance and make adequate copies of
any worksheets that may be needed.
•
Purchase or collect all equipment that will be used for monitoring and any
additional supplies that are required for educational activities.
•
Make sure youth understand proper behavior and treatment of the forest
before and during the field trip.
Basic Terms & Concepts
There are many terms and concepts that may be new to educators and students alike.
Some of these terms are described in the margins of the text. Many other terms are
provided in the glossary in Appendix 3 of this guide.

Forest Restoration
Background
CFRP projects are currently underway in ponderosa pine
forests, pinyon- juniper woodlands, and bosque systems of
New Mexico. These projects can have many goals, depending
on the ecosystem and the partners involved in a project. Some
goals are specifically oriented toward restoration of forest
ecosystems. Other projects seek to reduce the risk of fire
hazard to human communities.
In ponderosa pine forests, a primary goal is to reduce the
threat of crown fire, the type of intensely hot fire that moves
rapidly through the tree tops and causes widespread tree
mortality. An equally important goal is to return low-
intensity surface fires to these forests. In pinyon-juniper
woodlands, most projects focus on reducing the threat of fire
to homes and communities. In bosque woodlands, project
goals often include removing many non-native species or re-
creating historic flood patterns. A summary of common
forest types is provided in the table below and in the following
pages.
Ponderosa Pine Forests
Historically, ponderosa pine forests were often comprised of
clumps of trees interspersed with small openings or meadows.
Since the late 1800s these forests have changed dramatically in
the Southwest. Typical ecosystem changes include:
•
Decreased cover of grasses and wildflowers 
•
Shifts in wildlife diversity 
•
Increased densities of small trees 
•
Decreased numbers of old and large trees 
•
Increased old-growth tree mortality rates due to competition from thickets of
small trees 
•
Increased threats of large-scale insect attacks on trees 
•
Change from low-intensity ground fires to increasingly large, high-intensity
“crown” fires 
•
Increasing threats to property and human lives  
Surface fires typically occur
at the ground level of a
forest, burning needles,
fallen branches, and other
fuels on the forest floor.
Surface fires are especially
important to restoration
because they help reduce
conditions such as dense
ground fuels and excess
young trees that can
eventually lead to crown
fires.

Ecological restoration is the
process of returning more
natural conditions to
ecosystems that have been
damaged by human
activities.

Most people agree that these changes are due to drastic changes in land use and land
management, particularly fire suppression. Starting in the early 1900s, many small
ponderosa pine trees germinated and survived, partly because of the lack of surface fires to
thin excess seedlings and partly because of the removal of competition from grass due to
overgrazing. As these trees have grown, they have created dense
thickets of small trees that typically have little plant cover on the
ground. These changes have in turn affected wildlife and fire
regimes. Instead of surface fires, most ponderosa pine forests now
burn in intense crown fires, which can kill many trees over
thousands of acres. While there is no single prescription for every
site needing restoration, virtually all ponderosa pine restoration
projects involve some tree thinning and reintroduction of surface
fires.
Pinyon-Juniper Woodlands
Pinyon pine and juniper woodlands appear to be changing rapidly
in the Southwest in recent decades. Scientists do not understand
to what extent this is due to natural causes, such as local climate
variability, or to human activities, such as grazing and the
suppression of wildfire. The history of fire in pinyon-juniper
woodlands is also not well understood. However, many people
now live in areas of dense pinyon-juniper woodlands that pose a
serious fire hazard to homes and villages. People are therefore
treating pinyon-juniper woodlands in areas that could threaten
human communities. Treatments usually involve reducing tree
densities by thinning in order to reduce this risk of destructive fire.
Riparian Communities
Southwestern riparian communities have been changed by human activities over a long
period of time. Much of the Rio Grande valley has been inhabited by indigenous people
for more than a millennium, and Hispanic uses, including livestock grazing, have been
important for centuries. In New Mexico, a riparian community is often called a bosque, a
Spanish word for woodlands. Some ecosystem changes seen in riparian communities
include:
•
Lowered water table
•
Soil erosion and unstable river banks
•
Increased numbers of non-native plant species
•
Decreased numbers of native plant species, especially cottonwood trees
•
Increased number of jacks, levies, and other flood-control structures that
straighten the river
•
Reduced flooding over the banks of the river
•
Increased fire hazard
•
Reduced soil moisture
A riparian community, or
bosque, refers to ecosystems
located along streams and
rivers and often includes
trees such as cottonwoods
and willows.

Non-native plants are those
that come from a different
ecosystem than where they
are currently growing.

Traditional approaches to restoration are not useful for riparian community restoration in
New Mexico. Typical restoration involves referring to sites that have been and continue to
be relatively free from recent human disturbances. Because all riparian areas in New
Mexico have been influenced by humans for many centuries, there are no such relatively
unchanged sites. However, most lowland riparian communities were probably mosaics of
the following:
•
Areas of young cottonwood, willow, and native olive trees
•
Forests with mature cottonwood trees
•
Wet meadows, open marshes, ponds, and grasslands
Because there are no relatively natural bosques to use as models, restoration of these
systems frequently involves efforts to restore natural processes. For example, a natural cycle
of flooding over river banks allows cottonwood seeds to germinate. But restoring natural
water flows is very difficult. A more practical restoration approach is the removal of non-
native trees, such as Russian olives. This reduces the threat of fires, which can be
devastating to native tree populations in the bosque.

Restoration Goals
A restoration goal is a general summary of the desired state a project is trying to achieve.
Most CFRP projects are trying to address one or more of the following goals:
1.
Change fire regimes
2.
Preserve old and large trees
3.
Enhance native plant populations and reduce invasive,
non-native plant populations
4.
Conserve wildlife populations and habitats
5.
Conserve soil resources
6.
Conserve and protect riparian communities
Monitoring goals usually relate to the overall restoration goals of a project. Table 2 and
the text that follows list each of these goals and curricular activities that will give students
a broader understanding of concepts that relate to these goals.
Goal 1: Change fire regimes
A primary goal of restoration in ponderosa pine forests is to reduce the threat
of crown fire. An equally important goal of restoration is to re-establish low-
intensity surface fires that burn across the forest floor. These surface fires are
important because they help maintain a lower level of ground fuels and fewer
excess small diameter trees. Without reintroduction of these surface fires, many
of the positive ecological changes brought about by various treatments will be
short-lived. Low-intensity fire can be returned through prescribed burning or
allowing natural fires to burn when circumstances allow this. In riparian
communities and pinyon-juniper woodlands near towns, no such return of
fires is needed. The following activities will provide students with a better
understanding of fire ecology in ponderosa pine forests.

Goal 2: Preserve old and large trees
Old and large trees have significant ecological value for many reasons. Due to
logging, overgrazing, and fire suppression, large old trees are no longer
common in southwestern forests, so it is important to preserve those that do
exist. Large trees, both living and dead, are important for wildlife. In addition,
tree rings of old ponderosa pine trees are important for scientists to understand
fire history, changes in climate, and other aspects of ecosystems. The following
activities will provide students with a better understanding of old and large
trees:

Goal 3: Enhance native plant populations and reduce invasive,
non-native plant populations
Native grasses and forbs are an important part of Southwestern ecosystems.
These plants make up the understory and contribute much of the biological
diversity in forests. Understory plants provide food and cover for fungi, insects,
birds and butterflies, mammals and other organisms. They also help protect
soil from erosion and provide forage for grazing animals.
Understory plants also play an important role in carrying fires in ponderosa
pine forests. When grasses are dry and abundant, they enable low-intensity
fires to burn across the forest floor. Without enough understory, fires will not
spread and will be unable to perform their natural functions.
Some plants are not native to an area and can take over large parts of the
understory, displacing native species. Invasive, non-native plants can have
negative effects on an ecosystem because they compete with native plants for
space, light, water, and nutrients. They also can change the timing and role of
fire in a system. The threat of fire from non-native species is particularly
significant in riparian communities. In these systems, dense thickets of Russian
olive and salt cedar (also called tamarisk) can lead to high intensity fires that
are not natural to the system. Salt cedar, in particular, can thrive after a fire,

Goal 4: Conserve wildlife habitat and populations
There are two kinds of goals for wildlife as part of ecosystem restoration,
depending on the type of project. If a project is specifically designed to restore
habitat for wildlife, the goal is to create conditions that support native animals.
For projects that do not specifically set out to restore wildlife habitat, the goal is
to minimize negative impacts on wildlife.
Monitoring either of these goals is difficult because many animals hide from
humans or are difficult to identify. To monitor wildlife it is often necessary to
rely on more indirect indicators and measures. These can include “wildlife
indicators” or “habitat conditions.” Wildlife indicators are animal species, such
as birds and butterflies, that can help show changes in an ecosystem that may
affect other species.
Habitat conditions help to show if an area is good for wildlife. A habitat refers
to the place where an animal is usually found and includes food, water, shelter,
and nesting conditions that an animal needs to survive. Some animals rely on
dense forest habitat, while others need open areas, and many need a variety of
these conditions to survive. Smaller animals may use a very small area as
habitat. A beetle may rely on only a small clump of plants for its habitat. In
contrast, a mountain lion may have a habitat of a hundred square miles or
more.
Large trees are important to many different kinds of animals, including
goshawks, songbirds, wild turkeys, woodpeckers, and bats. When large trees die
and remain standing, they are called snags. Snags are important to cavity-
nesting birds, such as northern flickers, house wrens, and mountain bluebirds,
which rely on these trees for nesting.
Two owls in the Southwest are closely associated with old-growth forests of
ponderosa pine. Old-growth forests are patches of forest where old and large
trees are found along with trees of other sizes and ages. Both the flammulated
owl and the spotted owl tend to spend most of their time in forests with old
and large trees. These owls rely on large trees as perches while searching for
food. They also use large trees to nest high off the ground.
When trees are grouped in clumps, they can provide important habitat for
squirrels, bear, turkey, deer, and elk. Other habitat conditions important to
wildlife include understory plants for food and cover and woody trees, such as
oaks and junipers, that provide large amounts of food for many animals. In
addition, some dead wood on the ground provides habitat for small mammals,
including those that store seeds from trees on the ground.
Some animals also need open areas for their habitat. For example, mountain
and western bluebirds and spotted towhees are more common in open
ponderosa pine forests than in dense forests where fires have been suppressed
for many years. The bosque provides many different habitats that are
important to wildlife and contains the greatest diversity of plants, birds, and
animals of any Southwest ecosystem.

Goal 5: Conserve soil resources
Soils are the foundation of any ecosystem and are an essential part of ecosystem
health. Soils can easily be damaged when they are exposed to high-intensity fires or
when heavy equipment moves large amounts of soil or packs it down hard. Damaged
soils can take a long time to recover. When soils are damaged, they are more likely to
be invaded by non-native plants. The soil also becomes less favorable for tree seedlings
to establish, and water is less likely to soak into the soil, which can lead to erosion.
Soil actually refers to much more than “bare dirt.” There are many components and
functions of soil. For example, many organisms live in soil, including fungi and
bacteria which help to free up nutrients so that they are in a more useable form for
plants. Soil also stores seeds of many plants and provides homes for many
invertebrates and small mammals. The following activities will help students better
understand the role of soil in an ecosystem:
•
Who Lives Here?
•
Compaction Action
Goal 6: Conserve and protect riparian communities
Riparian communities are shady areas of trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants that grow
along streams and rivers. They currently occupy less than one percent of the arid
Southwest, but they have the greatest diversity of plants, birds and animals. Bosques
provide habitat for many threatened or endangered species, yet these systems are among
the most threatened in the Southwest. Threats include higher risk of destructive fires;
lowered water table; impacts from overgrazing; invasion by non-native plants including
salt cedar (tamarisk), Russian olive, and Siberian elm; and clearing for development.
The following activities will help students better understand riparian communities.

A
fundamental part of ecological restoration is to understand the
natural or historical conditions of the system that is being restored.
Scientists need to uncover what a forest looked like or behaved like in
the past, before the system was damaged or changed. Scientists often use
these past conditions, called “reference conditions,” as targets for restoration
activities in the present.
In this activity, students will learn about different tools to determine
reference conditions, and will apply these tools to specific case studies. They
will gather information about past conditions of an ecosystem and will work
in teams to describe reference conditions. They will apply this knowledge to a
restoration site and discuss what actions might be needed to restore a site.
This is a classroom activity that can also involve some library research. It can
be adapted to a particular CFRP project as well.
Objectives
Students will use data gathering and analysis skills to determine reference
conditions for a restoration site. Students will learn about different kinds of
information that scientists can use and apply to understanding a system.
They will learn about the tools available to determine past conditions of an
ecosystem and how to apply these in determining appropriate restoration
goals.
Relevant Monitoring Goals 
change fire regimes, preserve old and large trees, enhance native
plants/reduce non-native plants, conserve and protect riparian communities
Relevant Monitoring Indicators 
density and size of living and dead trees, seedling density, extent of canopy
closure, height from ground to base of tree crowns, amount of surface fuel,
understory cover, landscape openings

16
Background
Researchers use a variety of tools to investigate past ecological conditions. Some
are biological and some are cultural. Examples of biological evidence include tree
rings and pack rat middens. Examples of cultural data include old photographs
and documents such as diaries and logs of early explorers.
Sometimes people have been influencing an ecosystem for so long that physical
evidence – whether biological or cultural – does not exist to show its natural
state. In these cases, scientists have to apply what they know from research to
estimate historical conditions for a system or site. At other times, changes in an
ecosystem are recent enough that scientists can reconstruct what the system was
like with a much greater degree of accuracy. Some methods that help to estimate
past ecological conditions include:
•
Ethnobotanical evidence, such as oral histories; anthropological literature
about native peoples’ uses of plants for food or medicine; and analysis of
materials used to make baskets, clothing, food bags, etc.
•
Written records, including the logs and diaries from explorers, military
expeditions, trappers, missionaries, and merchants
•
Census data, including population and land surveys
•
Reports from early scientific expeditions
•
Old maps and photographs
•
Old aerial photographs
•
Physical evidence from the ecosystem being studied, such as tree ring
data, fire scars, and pack rat middens
While scientists use a combination of all these forms of information to try to
determine past ecological conditions for a system, restoration is sometimes called
an “imperfect science,” because there are possibilities for inaccuracy in reports,
exaggeration in diaries, or natural variations in a landscape that a single
photograph or document cannot capture. In addition, all ecosystems naturally
change with time so there is no single set of conditions that existed in the past.
More likely, any ecosystem had a natural range of variation in conditions, so that,
for example, some ponderosa pine forests were more densely populated with
trees, while others were open areas scattered with old, large pines.
Materials:
•
Photocopies of student investigator cards
•
Completed packets for student investigations, including worksheets
•
Accompanying CD with photographs for Dendrochronologist and
Environmental Historian

17
Preparation 
You will need to prepare materials for student investigations in advance. To do
this, cut out enough “student investigator cards” (provided on page 19) so that
each group of students can receive one of the four cards. These can be
photocopied and cut out from the worksheet that follows this activity. You will
also need to prepare student investigation packets. You will need one of each of
these. If you have a large class, you may want to make two of each so that all
students will be able to interpret materials. For student investigations as the
Dendrochronologist and the Environmental Historian, it is best to make colored
photocopies or print-outs from the CD that accompanies this curriculum and to
use the student investigation text only as a reference.
If your class is particularly interested in determining reference conditions for the
CFRP monitoring site, you may want to gather additional materials that students
can interpret, or plan a trip to a local library or to some of New Mexico’s larger
archives, such as at the University of New Mexico.
Procedure
1.
Introduce the topic of restoration by asking students to describe in sketches
and words the CFRP project site they are monitoring. If students have not
previously visited a site, ask them to sketch and describe in words a forest
that they are familiar with. Have them use as much detail as they can,
including names of plants and animals, existence of meadows or forests, and
so on.
2.
Next ask students to list all the ways they can think of that their families use
the forest and its products. Examples of uses might include for picnics and
hiking, for gathering fuelwood, hunting wild turkeys, collecting pinyon nuts,
cutting small trees for latillas, or gathering medicinal plants for grandparents.
3.
Explain that student drawings or lists of family uses are similar to what
scientists sometimes draw upon to determine the conditions of ecosystems
100 or more years ago. Ask students to give the pros and cons for using this
information as a reference for restoring the forest. (Pros include
documentation of many of the plants and animals that existed in the forest;
Cons include limited spatial references, possible mis-identification of plant
species, or exaggerated perceptions of explorers as they moved from flat and
open plains to a forested, mountainous region.)
4.
Ask students to think about other kinds of evidence scientists might use to
determine past conditions of an ecosystem. Introduce the term reference
condition, and explain the importance of this in restoration efforts.

18
5.
Next explain to students that they will break into groups of “investigators.”
Students will examine evidence from an ethnobotanist, military expedition,
environmental historian, or restoration ecologist.
6.
Pass out student investigation cards to each of the students. Have students
arrange themselves into like groups (so that all the military expeditions, all
the ethnobotanists, all the historians, and all the restoration ecologists are
working together in like groups).
7.
Give each group their respective packet of materials that they will use to
analyze and determine reference conditions.
8.
Tell students that they have 10 minutes to analyze the material they are given
and to list what kinds of data they kind find from their sources. They should
record data on their investigator’s worksheet.
9.
After 10 minutes, ask each team to present their findings to the class as a
whole. On a classroom board, flip chart, or overhead projector, record these
findings as students present them.
10. When each group is finished presenting their findings, ask students to look at
the findings as a whole and to identify commonalities from the different
sources of data.
11. Ask students to create a list of reference conditions that they feel fairly
certain might have represented the site 100-150 years ago.
12. Ask students how they would apply these conditions to the forest they
described earlier. What changes would need to be made to the site in order
for it to look like it did 100-150 years ago?
13. Points of discussion:
•
What are some of the pros and cons in using different types of data to
determine reference conditions?
•
If you are trying to restore a forest today, how would you use these types
of data in deciding how to manage the forest?
•
Can any of these types of information be used in monitoring a particular
site? Discuss how they might be used and any limitations of the
information in monitoring.

Student Investigations
Ethnobotanist1: 
You are an ethnobotanist, studying the Native American uses of grasses for basket
making. This is some of the information you have found:
Grasses were important to many Native American tribes for food, thatch for houses,
arrows, and coiled baskets. According to interviews, at least 20 California Indian tribes
use one type of bunch grass called deergrass to make baskets, which are used as bread
molds, dishes for eating, acorn flour-sifting baskets, storage baskets, gifts, and grass seed
collecting baskets. Many of these baskets are still woven and used today. In order to make
baskets, weavers needed large amounts of deergrass. For example, to make some of the
larger baskets, weavers might require as many as 3,000 or more flower stalks for a single
basket.
Deergrass historically had a wide distribution in open areas, and required fire to
maintain. Historic records show that many California Indians managed grasses by setting
prescribed fires. This helped regenerate the grasses and eliminate grasshoppers. Though it
mostly grew in open prairies, there is also evidence that two mountain tribes, the Foothill
Yokuts and Western Mono, used local supplies of this grass in their baskets. One field
researcher recorded that the grass also grew in the mountains at elevations of 5,000 feet
in the year 1900. Deergrass commonly grew along with shrubs and small trees and in
ponderosa pine forests. When shrubs or ponderosa pine trees were “encroaching” into
deergrass collection sites, many tribes would burn these grasslands to maintain deergrass
colonies and eliminate ponderosa pine trees. Burning could occur every 2-5 years,
depending on conditions at each site.
1All information comes from M. Kat Anderson’s article, “The Ethnobotany of Deergrass, Muhlenbergia rigens
(Poaceae): Its Uses and Fire Management by California Indian Tribes.” Published in Economic Botany 50(4):
409-422. 1996. Though ideally we would have provided ethnobotanic information from Southwest plants
species and native uses, this information has not been published for New Mexico’s native people. If students
are interested in documenting local information of a similar nature, they may conduct interviews and oral
histories with local people, and use this information to try to determine past conditions of an area.

Student Investigations
Military Expedition:
You are part of a military expedition, and have recorded the following in your journal:
September 8, 1858: “We come to a glorious forest of lofty pines,
through which we traveled 10 miles. The country was beautifully
undulating, and although we usually associate the idea of barrenness
with the pine regions, it is not so in this instance; every foot being
covered with the finest grass, and beautiful broad grassy vales
extending in every direction. The forest was perfectly o pen and
unencumbered with brush wood, so that traveling was excellent.”
September 21, 1858: “A vast forest of gigantic pine, intersected
frequently by extensive aspen glades, sprinkled all over the mountain
meadows and wide savannahs, filled with the richest grasses, were
traversed by our party for many days.”
May 5, 1882: “The trees are large and noble of aspect and stand
widely apart, except in the highest part of the plateau where spruces
predominate. Instead of dense thickets where we are shut in by
impenetrable foliage, we can look far beyond and see the tree
trunks vanishing away like an infinite colonnade. The ground is
unobstructed and inviting. There is a constant succession of parks and
glades—dreamy avenues of grass and flowers winding between
sylvan walls, or spreading out in broad o pen meadows…The way here
is as pleasing as before, for it is beneath the pines standing at
intervals varying from 50 to 100 feet, and upon a soil that is smooth,
firm, and free from undergrowth.”

Understanding Forest Fires
A similar activity is found in Project Learning Tree, pages 311-315.
T
he way forests burn depends on many things: the structure of the
forest, local weather conditions (whether it is dry or relatively wet),
wind speed, and other factors. Because people have suppressed
surface fires in ponderosa pine forests for many years, these forests are now
more vulnerable to crown fires. One of the goals of many restoration projects
is to minimize the likelihood of such crown fires. This can be achieved
through different methods, depending on the existing structure of the forest.
In this activity, students learn the three elements of a fire triangle and the
terms used to describe a forest fire. They apply this knowledge in the
construction of felt board models of surface and crown fires. They interpret
what they have learned in relation to restoration efforts to reduce the risk of
crown fires in ponderosa pine systems.
Objectives
Students will be able to identify the three components fire needs to burn,
understand conditions that cause fire risk and spread, and describe the
characteristics of crown and surface fires.
Relevant Monitoring Goals 
Change fire regimes, preserve old and large trees, enhance native
plants/reduce non-native plants
Relevant Monitoring Indicators 
Density and size of living and dead trees, seedling density, extent of canopy
closure, height from ground to base of tree crowns, amount of surface fuel,
understory cover, landscape openings

26
Materials
•
Chalkboard or dry erase board with marker
•
String or thick yarn approximately 10 feet in length
•
Construction paper or notecards
•
Felt board - cardboard, felt in different colors, scissors
•
Copies of worksheet
Preparation 
You will need to prepare materials for the fire risk and felt board activities in
advance. At the end of this activity, there are sample scenarios that can be
photocopied and cut for the fire risk activity. Or you may wish to use some of
these scenarios and create others more appropriate to your field site. For the felt
board, you will need a piece of corrugated cardboard or other hard backdrop.
Cover this with the background: use a big sheet of blue felt for a sky, use brown
felt for the ground. It is good to create some amount of hills or slopes for higher
grades. Sample patterns are provided at the end of this activity that can be copied
and traced onto felt of different colors. Or, if you are planning to use the Tree ID
activity, you could have students create felt cut-outs as an extension of that
activity. Students really enjoy placing the lightning bolt onto the felt board, so
make sure to cut one of these out, too.
Procedure
1.
Introduce the lesson by asking what students think about forest fires. Ask
students to say if they think fires are “good,”“bad,” or “sometimes good and
sometimes bad.” Have them explain their thinking for each of these
categories.
2.
Ask students for feedback about how fires start (Look for natural fires -
through lightning; human-caused - campfires, cigarette butts, burning
debris, sparks from ATVs or other vehicles, etc.). Explain that these are
sources of ignition and are needed to provide heat to start a fire.
3.
Ask students what three things a fire
needs to burn: have them generate a list
of as many things they can think of and
categorize them according to the three
elements of the fire triangle:
fuel
heat
oxygen

27
4.
Have students think about a “perfect day” for a forest fire using the triangle:
• Oxygen (windy days - fire season in spring, direction of wind, hills)
• Heat (when is fire season, do fires usually burn most in the day or night)
• Fuels (wet versus dry, size of fuels)
Ask students to think about what a fire manager (someone who manages
fires on public lands) can control? Can they control oxygen? (no). Can they
control heat? (no). Can they control fuels (yes). Explain that for this reason,
many restoration projects focus on fuels in order to change fire behavior so it
is less risky.
5.
To apply this knowledge, have student play a game. Each student will take a
piece of paper from a bag and decide if the scenario on their paper is a low,
moderate, or high fire risk. To play the game:
•
Place a yellow card marked LOW and a red card marked HIGH at either
end of a 10-foot long string.
•
Have each student pick one paper with a scenario from a bag.
•
Have each student decide the fire risk (standing by the low end or high
end or in the middle) for their scenario
•
Have students read their scenarios to the class and explain why they chose
the level of fire risk. (You can make scenarios increasingly complicated
depending on the age of the students.)
6.
Next introduce how fires are described:
•
Fire intensity (how hot it burns)
•
Fire severity (how much it kills)
•
Rate of spread
Discuss what factors might affect fire intensity, fire severity, and rate of
spread, using the fire triangle to discuss each of these factors.
7.
Bring out the felt board and explain to students that they are going to use the
felt board to model different kinds of fires. Discuss how the felt pieces
represent different aspects of the forest, and have students identify what each
color and shape of felt represents (for example, ponderosa pine trees, oak
shrubs, grasses, and fire).
8.
Ask the class who has heard of a surface fire. If someone has heard of it, ask
them to explain what they think it means. Next ask who has heard of a crown
fire, and ask them to explain what it means.
9.
Have 2 students volunteer to use the felt pieces to create conditions that
would support a surface fire.

28
10. Have 1 student volunteer to place the lightning bolt on the felt board to start
the fire.
11. Have another student volunteer to show how the fire might spread. Have the
class evaluate the fire spread as the student places fire pieces onto the felt
board. Have the class decide whether the felt board model would indeed
remain a surface fire, or if they think it might become a crown fire. Look for
presence of ladder fuels, many connecting tree canopies, or dense fuels on
slopes. Also look for enough ground fuels (such as grasses and shrubs) to
carry a fire across the surface. Have students use the words fire intensity, fire
severity, and rate of spread to describe the fire modeled. If appropriate, have
2 more students adjust the felt board so that it would support a surface fire.
12. Discuss how a surface fire might be beneficial to the forest. (Nutrient
cycling/provide nutrients for plants, killing small trees that would create an
over-crowded forest, reducing fuels, reducing fire risk to nearby homes,
provide new areas for grass growth, lower fire severity and fire intensity less
damaging to old and large trees, fire spreads quickly and is less damaging to
soils).
13. Next, have 2 students volunteer to use the felt pieces to create conditions that
would support a crown fire.
14. Have 1 student volunteer to place the lightning bolt on the felt board to start
the fire.
15. Have another student volunteer to show how the fire might spread. Have the
class evaluate the fire spread as the student places fire pieces onto the felt
board.
16. Have the class evaluate whether the felt board model would likely lead to a
crown fire. Look for presence of ladder fuels, tightly grouped tree crowns, or
dense fuels on slopes. Have students use the words fire intensity, fire severity,
and rate of spread to describe the fire modeled. If appropriate, have 2 more
students adjust the felt board so that it would support a crown fire.
17. Discuss the effects a crown fire might have on the forest. (Can kill large and
old trees, can be high fire intensity (so damages soils), can be high fire
severity (so can be catastrophic - burning everything), can trap wildlife and
kill them, can create openings (creating meadows).
18. Ask class what people think about forest fires again. Compare answers to
beginning of class.
19. Evaluation: Have students complete the accompanying worksheet, and/or
have them re-create drawings that model surface and crown fires and write
accompanying explanations.

S
ometimes restoration projects seek to return more natural fire
intensities and intervals to forests. Surface fires were a natural
component of many western forests in the past. In order to recreate
conditions that will support surface fires, some restoration projects remove
trees from the forest. This “thinning” of the forest to different densities of
trees helps create patterns of burning that maximize the number of trees that
remain standing in the forest after a fire.
In this activity, students will use models to understand fire behavior under
different variables. They use matches to model trees and a matrix of matches
to model a forest. They compare fire behavior on different slopes and with
different arrangements of trees. They interpret what they have learned in
relation to monitoring indicators for changing fire regimes.
NOTE
This activity involves fire. You will want to work in a very safe
laboratory setting or outdoors. If working outdoors, select a
location that is far from any vegetation, wood chips, cars,
buildings, or other fuels. (An empty parking lot can work
well.) Make sure plenty of water is available to put a fire out.
You may need to have teachers’ aides, a CFRP project partner,
or volunteers assist with this activity.
Objectives 
Given a physical model of a forest stand, students can describe effects of
slope, tree density, and ground fuels on fire spread. Students can describe
these effects using the terms surface, crown, and ground fire.
Relevant Monitoring Goals

Relevant Monitoring Indicators
density and size of living and dead trees, seedling density, extent of canopy

Materials
•
4 matchstick forest kits (1/4” thick masonite with drilled holes evenly spaced
across; box of strike-anywhere large kitchen matches)
•
1 long bolt, 1 short bolt with nuts and washers
•
4 nails
•
4 burning trays (tin pie pans work well for this)
•
fire extinguisher
Procedure
1.
Set up the class with four student teams. Explain that this activity is similar
to research done by chemists and physicists. Results from research like this
are used by foresters, firefighters, and ecologists.
2.
Explain that each team will set up different experiments, but the whole class
will observe every fire. So, in effect, the student teams are setting up
demonstrations for the whole class.
3.
Review safety procedures in the laboratory.
4.
Give each student team a matchstick forest model set with 50-100 matches.
Ask students to insert a match in every hole of the forest model, tips pointing
UP.
5.
Set these “matchstick forests” in burning trays on a heat-resistant surface. If
you don’t have laboratory facilities, one really good surface to use is a trash-
can lid filled with sand.
6.
Assign a demonstration to each of the four student teams:
1) a level forest;
2) a forest with a 20-degree slope (use the nut and short bolt to create the
slope);
3) a forest with a 40-degree slope (use the nut and long bolt). Have a fire
extinguisher and water nearby.
7.
Explain to students that the individual matches represent trees that have
flammable crowns like the ponderosa pine trees. In this demonstration,
students will observe how slope and tree density affect fire spread through
tree crowns. Before lighting any matches, ask students for their hypothesis
(guess) about how the fires will differ.

37
8.
Have a student light a fire for each of the demonstrations:
1) light the flat “forest” along one edge and observe;
2) light the TOP row of matches of the 20-degree slope forest;
3) light the BOTTOM row of the second 20-degree forest;
4) light the bottom row of the 40-degree forest. After each demonstration,
ask the students what they observe and what this means in terms of the
fire triangle and forest restoration. Have the students answer the
following questions:
A. How does the steepness of a hillside affect a fire’s spread?
B.
How well do fires burn downhill?
C. How does slope affect fire spread? Use the fire triangle to explain
(Heat travels upward, so the matches and trees uphill from a fire
receive more heat than those below and are easier to ignite.)
9.
Ask students to remove whatever remains of the matches from each board.
They can use the nails to poke burned matches out if necessary.
10. Explain that the arrangement of “trees” in the matchstick forest
demonstrations just completed resemble very dense forests. Ask students to
arrange the forests so that they resemble possible prescriptions for ponderosa
pine according to the following demonstrations: 1) creating defensible space
at the edge of a community with moderate (20-degree) slopes; 2) creating a
mosaic of tree clumps and open areas with 15-20 trees total on flat ground;
3) creating a forest of 35 trees on a steep (40-degree) slope to reduce the risk
of fire spread; 4) creating a forest of 25 trees on moderate (20-degree) slope
to reduce the risk of fire spread. Or ask students to alter their forest models
so that they change one variable at a time to determine effects of slope, wind,
or tree density on fire behavior.
11. Have students light each of these matchstick forest demonstrations and
observe what happens. Discuss how well each team solved the problem they
were given and what could have been done differently.
12. Ask students to compare the model forests in this experiment to real forests.
What is similar? What is different? 

38
13. Applications to monitoring sites:
•
Have students discuss what conditions are present in the site they are
monitoring, and what might happen in this forest if there was a fire.
•
Have students look on a project site map and find areas that they think
would be susceptible to a crown fire.
•
The next time students are collecting monitoring data in the field, have
them identify areas in the forest that they think might be susceptible to a
crown fire.
•
This activity could be done when collecting baseline data and then
repeated after the forest is thinned. Students could then compare areas at
risk of crown fire before and after the project is treated.

A
ll forests contain woody fuels, such as dead and down logs, beds of
pine needles, low branches of live trees, and dense thickets of small
trees. Although these fuels are a natural part of any forest, high levels
of such fuels can carry a fire from the ground into the tops of trees, leading
to a crown fire. Forests where fire has been suppressed for many years might
contain high levels of these fuels. Restored forests should contain low levels
of these fuels. When large amounts of woody fuels exist, they must be
removed from the forest before a surface fire can be safely reintroduced to a
forest.
In this activity, students will experiment with the flammability of different
fuel recipes in a laboratory or safe outdoor setting. They interpret what they
have learned in relation to monitoring indicators for changing fire regimes.
NOTE
This activity involves fire. You will want to work in a very safe
laboratory setting or outdoors. If working outdoors, select a
location that is far from any vegetation, wood chips, cars,
buildings, or other fuels. (An empty parking lot can work
well.) Make sure plenty of water is available to put a fire out.
You may need to have teachers’ aides, a CFRP project partner,
or volunteers assist with this activity.
Objectives 
Students will select fuels of different flammability and arrange them so they
are most likely to burn. Students will describe their observations and how
they relate to the restoration objectives of creating conditions that support
low-intensity surface fires.

Procedure
1.
Review the Fire Triangle with students (from Activity 2): Discuss what three
things are necessary for a fire to burn and draw the fire triangle on the
board.
2.
Explain that five teams of students will be trying to start small fires in the
aluminum pie tins with a certain fuel mixture. They must come up with a
strategy to get as much of their fuel as possible to burn within 15 minutes.
(You may want to reduce this time if using a small amount of fuel for each
experiment.)
3.
Divide the students into five teams. Give each team a fuel recipe, the fuels
they need for this recipe, an aluminum pie pan, a small bucket of water, and
7 matches. (Seven is all they get.) You could also have the students review
each of the recipes and create hypotheses for how well they think each of the
fuels will burn.
4.
Review safety procedures and rules for this activity. These rules should
include:
a. Each team must work together
b. The whole team is responsible for safety. If any student is injured, the
experiment stops.
c. All fires must be built within the pie tin on the designated surface
(laboratory fire-resistant tables; pavement or gravel away from cars,
buildings, or vegetation).
d. Each team must stick to its recipe. No other fuels may be added.
e. Each team gets only 7 matches. No more may be used.
f. Each team MUST use a 2-minute group planning session before lighting
any matches. They can arrange the fuels in the pie tin any way they wish.
This should be agreed upon before any matches are lit.
5.
Go outside or into a very safe laboratory setting where students will burn the
fuels.
6.
Have the students create a plan (during the 2+ minute planning session) for
how they will arrange their fuels.
7.
After 2 minutes, tell students they may begin lighting their fires.
8.
After 15 minutes, stop the activity.
9.
As a class, take a “tour” of each fuel site. Discuss how successful each fire was
and why it did or did not burn well.

44
10. Discussion Points:
•
Green fuels have more moisture than dry fuels unless it has recently
rained. Moisture affects the Fire Triangle in two ways: 1) the moisture has
to evaporate before you can heat the fuel to an ignition point (about 600
degrees Fahrenheit). If fuels are really wet, the water also keeps oxygen
from getting to the fuel.
•
Green fuels usually contain a high percentage of water by weight. So green
fuels may be difficult to light. Dry fuels can contain as low as 3% water by
weight.
•
When green fuels burn, they may produce more heat than a dry fuel. This
is because green fuels contain oils and other “volatile” compounds that
break down once the material is dead (and therefore are not present in
dry/dead fuels).
•
Large branches are harder to light than smaller ones. Small branches and
needles have more surface area that is exposed to oxygen and to the heat
of the match than larger pieces. This is called “surface-area-to-volume
ratio.” As this number increases, fires burn more readily.
•
Plants are a mixture of flammable materials (carbon compounds that
combine readily with oxygen in the presence of heat) and inflammable
materials (such as silicon). Charred wood has had much of its carbon
burned off, especially from the surface of the fuel, so it is harder to light.
•
Ask the students what factors other than fuel influenced how well their
fuels burned. What strategies did they use to get the fires to burn?
11. Applications to monitoring:
•
Ask students to think about the site they are monitoring and discuss the
fuels present. (Or discuss this the next time students go to the field site.)
•
Talk about the prescription called for in the site they are monitoring, and
how this will affect the amount of fuels on the ground.
•
Discuss the types of fuels and their relative flammability.
•
Discuss whether these conditions would support a continuous, low-
intensity ground fire.
•
If monitoring surface fuels, discuss any data gathered and how this relates
to the goal of creating conditions to support a continuous, low-intensity
ground fire.

T
ree rings provide important background information for forest
restoration. Tree rings can help determine the age of a tree or a group
of trees. When scientists know the age of groups of trees in the forest,
they can determine what forests looked like in the past. When scientists can
determine what a forest looked like 100 or 200 years ago in a particular
location, they can set goals for restoring this same area today.
Fire scars on tree rings can show whether a tree has survived a fire, or many
fires, when and how often these fires occurred. From this information,
scientists can set goals for restoring fire to forests.
In this activity, students learn about growth rings and how fire scars form on
trees. They use dendrochronology to describe the history of ponderosa pine
forests over the past several hundred years. They learn that restoration
requires understanding what historical forests were like, and they learn how
tree rings and fire scars can help to determine these historic conditions.
Objectives 
Students learn to describe how tree growth rings are formed. When given a
cross-section of a tree trunk (or a photographed cross-section), students can
estimate the tree’s age and determine how many fires have scarred the tree.
Students will be able to calculate the average interval between fire scars. They
will apply this knowledge in determining reference conditions for
restoration.
Relevant Monitoring Goals

Background 
Dendrochronology is the study of tree rings to determine approximate dates of
past climatic and other environmental events. The study of tree rings can help
scientists understand historic conditions of a forest. Scientists sometimes study
tree rings by examining tree cookies, or the cross-section of trees, which are
usually cut from dead trees and stumps. The tree rings on these cookies can give
information about climate, such as periods of drought (represented by more
narrow tree rings) or periods of higher rainfall (represented by wider tree rings).
Fire scars can give clues as to the frequency and types of fires that may have been
present in different types of forests in the past.
Fire scars are made on trees by surface fires that are not severe enough to kill the
tree. A fire scar is formed when part of a tree’s cambium is killed by the heat of a
fire. If the cambium is damaged only part-way around the tree, the tree often
survives. In the years after a fire, new wood forms at the edge of the damaged
area. Year after year, new rings are formed that gradually curl over the edges of
the damaged area. This new growth begins to cover up the fire scar. Fire scar
samples usually show fire scars on one side of the sample, where the fire scorched
through the bark and burned the cambium.
Historians recognize two important
sources of fire prior to European
American settlement of North America.
Most fires were started by natural
lightning, but some also were started by
Native Americans. It is clear that crown
fires were rare in ponderosa pine forests.
The Ancient Tree picture for this
activity (page 99) shows a ponderosa
pine tree that survived many fires and
lived for nearly 600 years. It is unlikely
that there was a crown fire in the
location of this tree for these six
centuries.

edge).  These are available from the FireWorks CD and a subset are available on the CFRP

Preparation
These activities are most easily done with real cross-sections of trees (also called
tree cookies). These may be available from the Forest Service or from the
Laboratory of Tree Ring Research at the University of Arizona. If it is possible, try
to obtain tree cookies from trees with a known history and location. You will
need trees or portions of trees that contain fire scars to complete this activity. If
no tree cookies are available with fire scars, you can use color copies of
photographed cross-sections, which are available on Fireworks CD (see Appendix
2), or by downloading this curriculum’s supplementary materials from the
website: www.fs.fed.us/r3/spf/crfp/monitoring or requesting a CFRP Monitoring
Curriculum CD. This activity works well if students work in pairs or groups of 3
people (at most), so you will need the appropriate number of photographs for
your class size.
Procedure
1.
Introduce the topic to students by explaining to them that they will be
dendrochronologists for the day. Ask students to break down the word
dendrochronology to see if they can figure out its meaning. (Dendro = tree;
chrono = events in a time series; logy = the study of). Explain to students
that the study of tree rings can help scientists understand historic conditions
in the forest. Tree rings can give information about climate, such as periods
of drought or periods of higher rainfall. Tree cookies with fire scars can give
clues as to the frequency and types of fires that may have been present in
different types of forests in the past.
2.
Have students examine the growth rings on the Ancient Tree picture. The
tree in the Ancient Tree photo was nearly 600 years old when it died. Look at
the scars that form little notches along the blackened edge of the Ancient
Tree. The scars on this tree were made by surface fires. Because this tree lived
for nearly 600 years, and was only burned by surface fires in that time, we
can determine that no crown fires occurred where the tree was located for
nearly 6 centuries, between the early 1300s and 1919.

48
3.
Explain fire scars to the students: Fire scars are made on trees by surface fires
that are not severe enough to kill the tree. A fire scar is formed when part of
a tree’s cambium is killed by the heat of a fire. If the cambium is damaged
only part-way around the tree, the tree often survives. In the years after a fire,
new wood forms at the edge of the damaged area. Year after year, new rings
are formed that gradually curl over the edges of the damaged area. This new
growth begins to cover up the fire scar.
4.
Explain that students are going to describe the fire history of a tree. Break
students into pairs or groups of 3. If available, pass a fire-scarred ponderosa
pine cookie to each group of students. (Use photos if no cookies are
available.) Pass out hand lenses to students. Warning: If students are working
with hand lenses in direct sunlight or near sunny windows, be alert for
students trying to light fires with the hand lenses. Also distribute straight
pins, Dendrochronology Detectives worksheets, and calculators.
5.
Explain that students are going to be counting the rings of trees to determine
the age of the tree (if the pith in the middle of the tree is present), and the
number of years between each fire. Tell students they may keep track of tree
ring counts by sticking pins into the wood (or photo) or by using a light
pencil. They may not use ink in any form. Note: When students are counting
tree rings, sometimes they will be unable to see a section clearly or to tell if
there are one or two rings in a particular area. Explain to the students that
when they can’t count clearly, that they just estimate one ring. Then when
they record the number, they should use the greater-than (>) sign, to denote
that there are probably more rings on the cookie. Explain to students that
this is a conservative estimate of the age or intervals between years.
6.
Have students complete the Dendrochronology Detectives worksheet using
their tree cookie or photo. Give students 15-30 minutes to study their tree
cookies and complete their worksheets. If needed, remind students how to
calculate averages. To calculate the average interval between fires, students
will add up the numbers of years between each fire scar and divide by the
total number of fires.
7.
When students have completed their worksheets, have each student share
their data. Ask them to determine an average interval of fire for ponderosa
pine forests based on the entire class’s data.
8.
Discussion questions:
•
What does the tree ring data tell us about fire intervals in ponderosa pine
forests?
•
Can we learn anything from fire scars about crown fire? Were there any
crown fires in the area of each student’s tree? How do they know? [The
answer should be that a crown fire was very unlikely because a crown fire
would have killed the tree. They know this because the tree survived its
fires.]

49
•
Did the students find a particular time period (if they were able to age the
tree) when fires become less frequent? Why might fires have been less
frequent? [Fire suppression was extensive in the 1920s and 1930s. This
was from actively putting out fires, and also from an increase in grazing,
which led to a decrease in fine vegetation (fuels) to carry a fire.
•
Why might some students have found poor growth after a fire, while
other students found good growth? [Poor growth is likely to occur after a
fire if the fire killed many of the tree’s needles, or if the fire scorched
much of the cambium. Rapid growth after fire may be caused by
decreased competition from other vegetation for moisture and nutrients,
or by an increase in soil nutrients from burned vegetation.]
•
How might tree ring data be used for restoration of a particular forest?
[Restoration requires the understanding of reference conditions that give
information about what a forest used to look like and how it used to
function. Historic fire intervals give information about how the forest
used to function. Fire intervals from tree cookies can help to estimate
how often a surface fire burned in the area where the tree grew. This
information can be used to re-establish conditions in forests today so that
surface fires may safely burn at similar intervals.]
Possible Extensions
Extension 1.
Students often ask why some of the wood in a tree cookie is dark, while other
parts of the cookie are lighter. The dark wood usually marks areas that are filled
with sap, or “pitch.” Wood containing this pitch can develop for many reasons,
including:
1. The outer wood (xylem or sapwood) is often lighter in color than the
inner wood (heartwood). Xylem transports water and minerals in all
plants, including trees. Xylem does not transport sap, which would
give it the darker color. As trees age, cells in the inner sapwood die
and become heartwood. The tree can fill the spaces in the heartwood
with sap, giving it the darker color. Though the heartwood cells are
not living, they provide support to the tree throughout the tree’s
lifespan.

50

Have students compare the two cross-sections of trees and identify the locations
of xylem, sapwood, and heartwood.
2. If a tree is wounded, it often deposits pitch around the wound. The
pitch prevents fungi, which lead to decay of the wounded area, from
spreading too far into the tree. The wounds are caused by many
things, including scrapes from other trees, rubbing by animals, bark
beetles, and fire. The pitch forms irregular, dark shapes around the
wounds. Have students look at their tree cookies (or photos) for
evidence of these wounds. (Fire scars are one example.)
Extension 2.
Since tree rings are windows into the past, have students compare the following
dates in history with the growth rings on their tree cookies. (This extension
works only if students can age the trees and the trees are sufficiently old.)
1) railroads built, 1875
2) mining boom, 1880s
3) increase in grazing, 1880s to 1890s
4) increase in fire suppression, 1920s and 1930s
Have students mark each of these dates with a straight pin and paper. Also have
them note if the tree growth changed before or after these dates in any noticeable
way. Ask students to explain the relationship between these events and the effects
in the forest in terms of a) fire history; b) timber usage; and c) ability of
ponderosa pine seedlings to regenerate.

S
urface fires have been suppressed from ponderosa pine forests for many
years. When cool surface fires are returned to a restored forest, they
may have effects that in the short term seem harmful but in the long
run have positive effects for the health of the forest. For example, young trees
may be killed or grasses and flowers may burn to the ground.
In some cases, fire burns through a forest that has not been restored. When
this happens, the forest may burn so severely that few trees remain standing.
These forests may take many years to recover. Early signs of recovery may
include fire-adapted plants that cover the bare ground, re-sprouting of trees
from stumps, or birds that find food and/or nest in dead, standing trees.
This is an activity specifically designed for projects that plan to reintroduce
fire to their restoration site or that may be restoring an area previously
burned by wildfire. The activity requires a site burned by prescribed fire or
wildfire. If the CFRP project site has not been burned yet, it may be still be
worthwhile to conduct this activity at a nearby burned area.
Objectives 
In a recently burned area, students can find plants, animals, and animal sign,
and use them to infer characteristics of the fire and fire ecosystem.
Relevant Monitoring Goals
change fire regimes, preserve old and large trees, enhance native
plants/reduce non-native plants
Relevant Monitoring Indicators 
density and size of living and dead trees, seedling density, extent of canopy
closure, height from ground to base of tree crowns, amount of surface fuel,
understory cover, landscape openings
Materials
•
Paper and pencil
•
Photocopies of worksheet
•
Clipboards or hard writing surface
•
Optional: field guides for trees, shrubs, birds, mammals, scat

54
Procedure
1. Introduce the lesson by telling students they will be going into the field to
observe effects of a recent fire. Give a bit of history on the fire. If possible,
have a professional fire manager, forester, ecologist, and/or project partner
present for this trip to share information and background on the project site.
2. Review safety guidelines, such as working in pairs, always being within
eyesight of an adult, etc. Also review guidelines for working in the forest, such
as using quiet voices, leaving all objects where they are found, returning rocks
and logs to their original location, treating all objects in the forest with
respect, observing but not disturbing wildlife, etc.
3. Depending on time limitations and group dynamics, this activity can work
well with two variations:
•
Variation 1: Break students into 2-person teams. Assign 2 items from the
scavenger hunt to each team. Give them approximately 10 minutes to find
their items. Then have each team present their items to the class as a whole
and explain what they’ve learned. This works particularly well with groups
that are independent and interested in exploration.
•
Variation 2: Break students into 2-person teams. Give each team the entire
scavenger hunt and have the team identify each item. Then have each team
present 2 items that they think are unique or interesting to the entire class.
4. Discussion Points:
•
Ask the students to evaluate the burned area: did many trees die? Was
there much regrowth of understory plants? Are there many trees
resprouting? Did they find much sign of wildlife? Ask students to
categorize positive and negative effects on the forest. Review the
importance of snags for cavity-nesting birds (see “preserve wildlife and
habitat goal” for more information).
•
In the classroom, have students sketch, draw, paint, or write about what
they learned and their perspectives on fire.
•
If doing this activity at a different site from the monitoring site, ask
students to think about the site they are monitoring and discuss the
effects a fire might have at that site.

I
n recent years, populations of many native animals have declined in part
due to changes in forest conditions, such as fire suppression or removal
of old, large trees from the forest. Restoration projects that protect old
and large trees, preserve large snags, promote meadows, and support grass
and wildflowers will also help to bring back native wildlife that depend on
these conditions for their survival.
In this activity, students identify ways plants and animals depend on trees for
survival. This is ideally a field activity, but can also be done in a schoolyard
where there are a few trees. It is also an activity that can be assigned for
students to do at home, or in an area where they can make repeated
observations of the same tree. This is an activity that provides important
observation skills that are useful when recording photo points for
monitoring. It also provides background information for monitoring
wildlife conditions, such as tree size, snags, understory cover, and landscape
openings.
Objectives  
Using observation skills, students will learn that forests provide many
different habitats for diverse animals.
Relevant Monitoring Goals  
Conserve wildlife populations and habitats
Relevant Monitoring Indicators 
landscape openings, bird abundance, butterfly abundance, plant community
structure, density and size of living and dead trees, understory plant species
composition, understory cover
Materials

Clipboards or hard writing surface
•
Optional: field guides for trees, shrubs, birds, mammals
•
Optional: binoculars, hand lenses

58
Procedure
•
Introduce the lesson by telling students they will be observing a tree to see
which animals may rely on it for food, shelter, nesting, or in some other way.
Explain that these observation skills are important when monitoring,
particularly when recording data related to photo points.
•
Have students bring a pencil, paper, and clipboard or notebook into the field.
You may also want to bring field guides and/or binoculars or hand lenses for
students to share.
•
Prior to going into the field, discuss with students the importance of being
quiet and still so that they can observe as many different kinds of animals as
possible.
•
Students can work in pairs or small teams to observe a tree. They should
look for holes in the bark of trees, chewed plants or bark, animal scat, animal
tracks, nests, seed caches, invertebrates beneath leaves and needles, and so on.
•
Have students record what they see and hear. Have them identify plants,
animals, scat, and other signs of wildlife that they find. Hand lenses can be
used for looking at smaller invertebrates. Binoculars can be used for
observing birds or mammals higher up. Have students draw what they see.
•
Have students organize their observations and present them to the other
groups. This can be done in the field so that other students can observe what
each group found, or back in the classroom.
•
Discuss how the restoration project may affect wildlife habitat: Will it
provide new habitats?  Will it preserve existing habitats?  Will it provide a
greater diversity of habitats than before?  Are there wildlife corridors created
within the project?
•
Discuss the indicators students are monitoring for the CFRP project: which
of these indicators provide information about habitat conditions for wildlife?

59
Possible Extension
Many animals require trees and plants of different “height classes,” such as
grasses, shrubs, and trees. Look around the site and record if these types are
present in the following table:
Is this an excellent, good, fair, or poor site for wildlife habitat based on the height
classes present?  ___________________
Wildlife also require many different kinds of plants for food. Look at the
different species of plants (grasses, forbs, shrubs, trees), and record how many
you can find according to the following table:
Is this an excellent, good, fair, or poor site for wildlife habitat based on the

ne goal of restoration is to reduce the numbers of non-native plants
and animals that occur in the forest. A second, related goal is to
protect and increase native plants, so that their numbers and
patterns resemble historic forests. This activity will help students learn to
identify some of the native trees and shrubs common to southwest forests.
This is ideally a field activity, but it can also be adapted to the classroom. As
a field activity, this is a good introduction to basic skills students will need to
collect monitoring data for density and size of live and dead trees, understory
cover, and understory plant species composition.
Objectives  
Students will learn basic skills that can be used to identify common trees and
plants. They will learn basic characteristics of plants and will be introduced
to using field guides to identify plants.
Relevant Monitoring Goals  
change fire regimes, preserve old and large trees, conserve wildlife
populations and habitats, conserve and protect riparian communities
Materials
•
300-foot tape measure, 50-foot tape measure, pin flags, metal stakes or
rebar (two for each transect line)
•
Paper and pencil
•
Clipboards or hard writing surface
•
Field guides for trees, shrubs, and wildflowers

62
Procedure
1.
Introduce the lesson by explaining that
students will learn some of the basic
observations necessary to identify
common plants.
2.
Take students into the field and have them
establish large plots on transects. To do
this, follow the instructions in Handbook
4, or in the box at right.
3.
In the first plot, have students refer to
their field guides to determine the number
of different trees, shrubs, grasses, and
forbs located within the plot. (If adapting
to the classroom, bring in specimens of
different trees, shrubs, grasses, and forbs
that students can identify. These should
be species they can find in the project
area. Students can begin by classifying
each plant as a tree, shrub, grass, or forb,
and then continue with the remaining
steps.)
4.
Next have students identify each tree and
shrub by species. They can use field
guides to do this.
5.
Optional: have students identify grasses
and forbs to family, genus, or species.
Many grasses are difficult or impossible to
identify to species without flowers and a
microscope or hand lens, so you may want
to have students use broader systems of
classification for these plant types. You
may want to contact a local botanist to
teach identification skills or to talk to the
class about what different species of plants
can tell us about an ecosystem.
6.
If combining this lesson with a day of gathering monitoring data, have
students use their newly gained skills to determine the “density and size of
trees,”“seedling density,”“understory cover,” and/or “understory plant species
composition.”
Setting Up Transects:
1. Randomly locate the first transect
by throwing a stick over your
shoulder, and starting the transect
where this stick lands.
2. At the beginning of the transect
point, walk in a straight line with
the tape measure in hand, until
you have walked 300 feet.
3. Put transect markers at 0 feet and
300 feet.
4. Lay the tape measure on the
ground for the full 300 feet.
Establishing Plots on Transects:
1. Walk to the 50 foot mark of the
transect.
2. Run a second tape measure
perpendicular to the transect for
15-feet on each side of the
transect line (30 feet total).
3. Mark each end of the 30 feet with
a pin flag.
4. Walk another 30 feet (to the 80
foot mark of the transect), and
repeat steps 2-3. The four pin
flags will mark the corners of the
first plot.
5. Establish plots at 50, 100, 150,
200, 250, and 300 feet, for a total
of 6 plots.

63
Possible Extension: 
Determining Tree Size Structure
Ponderosa pine forests used to have trees of all ages. Tree size
structure tells us how many trees there are of different sizes.
Every forest type has a characteristic tree size structure that was
typical of natural conditions. The structure would change
somewhat with changing conditions, such as climate or
disturbances like fire, but would tend toward that typical
structure with time.
Ponderosa pine forests, for example, typically had trees in all age
classes. In other words, there were young, middle-aged, and
mature trees. Trees can grow at different rates, and tree size isn’t
always a reflection of tree age. But for ponderosa pines in the Southwest before
human activities changed forest structure so dramatically, there was a good
relationship between age and size.
Restoration projects can learn what the current tree size structure of the site is,
and use the knowledge of what the past natural structure was to help set
restoration targets. Forests that have a size structure similar to the historic
conditions of that forest are more resilient to disturbances than those that are far
from their natural state.
In many ponderosa pine forests today, there are many small trees and few large
trees. Thinning should return the structure of the forest so that it more closely
resembles its historical distribution. Graphs are useful visual aids in
understanding forest structure. Graphs charted before tree thinning will have
many more trees at the left side of the graph, in the smaller size categories. The
graph of tree size after thinning should have fewer seedlings and saplings and
more trees in the larger size category.
One measure of restoration success involves a comparison of the graphs of trees
size before and after thinning treatments. This extension allows students to
analyze data they have gathered for the indicator “Density and size of trees.” It
requires that students have already collected data, or that they collect this data as
part of their training in monitoring methods. Details of how to collect data are
found in Handbook 4.
Objectives 
Students will learn historic and current forest structures in ponderosa pine
forests. They will learn to analyze data by organizing data into categories and
graphing the data.

•
Photocopies of data sheets for Density and Size of Trees
•
Photocopies of graph or blank graph paper
Preparation
You will want to organize data sheets prior to this activity, so that only the
“Density and Size of Trees” data sheet is used. Make copies of the data sheet.
Don’t have students work with originals. You may also need to modify the
sample table and graphs if there were other species of trees in the project area, or
if there are many more trees (usually in a pre-treatment site) than will fit on the
sample graphs.
Procedure
1.
Introduce the lesson by telling students they will be analyzing data they have
already collected in the field.
2.
Explain that tree size structure tells us how many trees there are of different
sizes, and discuss tree size structure common to the type of forest you are
working in. Tell the students that they will use the data they collected by
measuring trees in plots to determine the tree size structure of the project
area.
3.
Explain that they will do this by graphing the number of seedlings, saplings,
and adult trees.
4.
Have students create a hypothesis for what they think they will find. (Will
they find all ages, a single age class, or some other combination?)
5.
Break students into groups of 2-3 students.
6.
Pass out copies of data sheets that they completed in the field. Have students
organize this data into a spreadsheet on a computer or use photocopies of
the table below. Students can make tally marks as they sort through the data.
7.
Have students use the data they have compiled to make a graph of the
number of seedlings, saplings, and adult trees of ponderosa pine trees.
Students should use the graph below or create their own on graph paper or
on a spreadsheet.

65
8.
Have students repeat step 6 for pinyon and then juniper trees (or other
species that were in the project area).
9.
Next, have students make graphs with the total numbers of seedlings,
saplings, and adult trees for all species combined.
10. Have students compare their graphs. Make sure that graphs are correct.
(They should all be identical if using the same data.)
11. Ask students to describe the shape of their graph. Does it form a specific
curve or line?  What does the graph tell them about each species?
Additional Discussion Points
•
Have students think back to when they collected data in the forest. Have
them recollect things they learned about the size of different trees. Ask
students whether tree size is always an accurate estimate of tree age. Have
students explain why or why not.
•
In historic ponderosa pine forests, many of the small trees would have been
removed by light fires. There may also have been “bumps” in numbers in the
larger size classes, since ponderosa pine sometimes regenerated in groups
when climate conditions were favorable at various times in the past. The
graph for these forests might therefore have had few trees on the left side of
the graph, and bumps in the curves for larger size classes. The curve formed
for this forest would not be very steep.
In contemporary forests, fires have been suppressed and there are many more
seedlings, saplings, and small adult trees. This makes a steep curve starting
high up on the left hand side. This kind of curve represents a forest with a
high vulnerability to destructive fire.
Ask students whether their graphs look like this now?  If so, ask them how
they think restoration might make the size curve more nearly resemble the
historic forest. Or, if the treatment has already been completed, have
students compare graphs from data sets before and after the treatment.
•
Ask students what effects the current size structure might have on fire?  On
wildlife?

What’s Growing Up?
R
estoration often seeks to change the structure of the forest, for
example by altering the number, age, and arrangement of plants and
trees. This change in structure helps support the reintroduction of
fire and also provides more favorable conditions for native plants and
animals. Such restoration principles often incorporate both theory and
scientific evidence. One such principle is that changing the amount and
arrangement of canopy cover will result in changes in understory plant cover.
For example, scientists believe that in areas where there is a decreased canopy
cover, more light will reach the ground, and the understory plant cover
should increase. Evidence supports this assumption, but there are also cases
where this relationship might not occur. For example, understory plant
cover might not increase because the soil is damaged in some way or non-
native species may outcompete native plants.
In this activity, students compare data between understory plant cover and
canopy cover to test a principle of ecological restoration and plant
competition. Students will examine the principle that if canopies are more
open, more plants will grow on the ground. They also will discuss other
factors that affect understory plant growth. This activity can be done in the
classroom after field data has been collected.
Objectives
Using basic map-making techniques, students will analyze monitoring data
to determine the relationship between canopy cover and understory plant
cover. They will be able to explain the implications of this for forest
restoration projects.
Relevant Monitoring Goals  
Change fire regimes, enhance native plants/reduce non-native plants,
conserve wildlife populations and habitats
Relevant Monitoring Indicators 
canopy cover, understory plant species composition, understory cover

70
Background
One of the goals of restoration in ponderosa pine is to reduce the number of tree
crowns that are touching, so that rather than having a fairly dense and
continuous canopy of trees, there are areas with grassy openings and areas with
tree cover. This has at least two purposes: one is to reduce the threat of crown
fires and the second is to create more openings where a greater diversity of
understory plants can grow. Reducing the threat of crown fires is part of
restoring a more natural fire regime to ponderosa pine forests, in other words,
creating conditions that can support frequent surface fires. Creating more
openings where understory plants can grow is important for many reasons,
including creating conditions that can support a surface fire (the ground
vegetation enables surface fires to spread); increasing overall biodiversity in the
forest; and creating habitat conditions necessary for many wildlife species.
There is much historical data, from photographs, diaries, and biological evidence,
that supports the existence of large openings with thick understory plant cover.
By restoring natural canopy cover, restoration will not only achieve the benefits
related to changing fire regimes, but also will allow more sunlight to reach the
ground, decrease competition for water, and thus allow more species of
understory plants to grow. More understory plants can support more animals
and ultimately restore the biodiversity in the ecosystem. In this activity, students
can compare monitoring data on canopy cover and understory plant cover to see
if these relationships bear out in the project area.
Materials
•
Acetate (overhead) sheets
•
Acetate (overhead) markers in various colors
•
Copies of completed data sheets for canopy cover (data sheet G)
•
Copies of completed data sheets for understory cover (data sheet K)
Preparation
To complete this activity, you will need completed copies of data sheets. This
means that someone should have collected monitoring data at least once. If you
do not have this data, you can collect it on a field trip following the methods
described in Handbook 4, pages 31-32 (for canopy cover) and pages 44-45 (for
understory cover).
Procedure
1.
Introduce the lesson by telling students they will be analyzing data they have
already collected in the field.
2.
Ask students what basic elements plants need to grow (sunlight, water,
nutrients). Ask students to explain what factors might negatively affect plant
growth (competition for these resources, too much or too little of any one of
these resources).

71
3.
Explain that the students are going to create maps that will allow them to
examine the relationship between canopy cover and understory plant cover.
Tell them that they will look to see if areas where there is high canopy cover
(where the forest is fairly dense), have higher or lower understory plant cover
(where plant cover on the ground is thick or sparse.)  Ask students to
generate a hypothesis about what they think they will find. Write this
hypothesis on a board or overhead projector.
4.
Break students into groups of 2-4. Give each student several sheets of
acetate, markers, and photocopies of completed data sheets.
5.
Tell students they will create two maps that they will overlay on top of each
other. One map will show canopy cover. The second map will show
understory plant cover.
6.
Ask students to create a key (or legend) for each of the maps they will create.
One possible key would be to have different shades of warm colors (yellows,
oranges, reds) for different ranges of canopy cover, and then to use cool
colors (blues and greens) for different ranges of understory plant cover.
7.
Have students use a sheet of acetate (clear plastic) to draw a grid of transects
and small plots that represent the arrangement of data they collected. They
can do this in black. (Students can refer to Handbook 4 methods, pages 33-
34 (for canopy cover) and pages 44-45 (for understory cover) if they do not
remember how the transects and plots were arranged.)
8.
Using this first sheet of transects and plots, have students create a map of the
canopy cover, using their key (legend) and data sheets.
9.
Next have students create a map of understory plant cover, using their key
(legend) and data sheets.
10. Have students overlay the canopy cover and understory plant cover maps on
top of the grid of transects and plots to look for patterns.
11. Discussion Points:
•
What patterns do they see on the maps?
•
From what they can observe, was their hypothesis correct?  Have them
explain why or why not.
•
Was their hypothesis correct across the whole project area, or only in
certain spots?  Have students explain why this might be.
•
Do they anticipate a change in this relationship after the project is
completed?  What would the differences be?
•
What other factors might affect the understory plant cover either before
or after a project is completed?  (Possible answers include grazing effects;
soil compaction from vehicles, equipment or cattle; drought; and low soil
nutrients)

72
Possible Extension
Many students and teachers are interested in technology and its applications.
The process of making maps on acetate and overlaying them is common to many
projects that want to examine relationships between different variables. This
technique, while very simple, is the basic foundation of GIS (Geographic
Information Systems), which combines different types of spatial data (such as the
spatial arrangement of different ranges in canopy cover along transects and the
spatial arrangement of different ranges in understory cover along these same
transects). GIS combines these different forms of data into one single map. The
overlay process thus mimics the GIS system in a low-tech way. If someone
associated with the CFRP project (such as a local Forest Service district or other
land management agency) has access to GIS technology, you might be able to get
someone to visit the classroom and discuss the applications of this technology,
such as creating one single map that represents the same information they
created in three layers.

Compaction Action
Two similar activities are found in Project Learning Tree, pages 256-257.
S
oil is an often overlooked, yet essential, part of the forest. Healthy soil
provides a good home for large burrowing animals, earthworms, and
microbes and fungi that help decompose dead wood and needles and
help plants absorb nutrients and water. Healthy soil is also soft and porous
enough to allow rainwater to easily reach tree roots. Restoration projects
should be careful not to harm the soil and its ability to absorb rainfall or
provide habitat for animals and microbes.
In this activity, students will look at the effects of equipment or roads on soil.
This is ideally a field activity, but can also be done in a schoolyard where
there is soil of different conditions.
Objectives
Students will learn how roads and equipment impact soil. They will
understand the importance of soil for plants and microorganisms.
Relevant Monitoring Goals  
conserve soil resources
Relevant Monitoring Indicators 
soil compaction, understory cover
Materials
•
6-30 tin (soup) cans with tops and bottoms removed (all tin cans should
be the same size)
•
Water
•
6 or more watches with a second hand or timers
•
Calculators
•
Clipboards or hard writing surface
•
Copies of data sheet
•
Optional: hand lenses, plant identification guides, invertebrate
identification guides

74
Preparation
It may be helpful to visit the site for this activity in advance to identify locations
for each of the six groups. This is not essential, however. It may also be helpful
to prepare data sheets (on page 77) that students can use to record information.
You may also want to prepare small cards or pieces of paper with a description of
each of the six sites.
Procedure
1. Introduce the lesson by telling students they will be looking at the effects of
heavy equipment and roads on soil, plants, and microorganisms.
2.
Explain that six teams of students will be looking at soil compaction by
measuring the rate that water percolates into the soil at different sites. (You
may want to change these sites to better fit the specifics of your project area.)
The sites are as follows:
•
An area beneath trees where there are needles and leaves where no
vehicles have driven
•
An open area between trees where no vehicles have driven
•
An area beneath trees where there are needles and leaves and where
equipment or vehicles have driven
•
An open area where equipment or vehicles have driven
•
An area at the side of a road
•
An area in the middle of a road
3.
Have students create hypotheses for which areas will have the greatest soil
compaction and have them explain why.
4.
Divide the students into six teams. Assign each team to one of the six sites
and have students complete the following exercise:
b.
Go to the site and record what the ground looks like. Make a sketch of
the vegetation that may be growing in the area and use terms such as:
grasses, forbs, litter, and bare soil to describe the site. Optional: use field
guides to identify plants growing on this site.
c.
Take the tin can and twist it into the ground so that it is about 1 inch
below ground (enough so that water will not leak out the bottom). For
cans with grooves in the middle of the can (many soup or vegetable cans
have these), the students can put the can into the ground just to the top
of the first groove.
d.
Fill the tin can with water.
e.
Record how long it takes for the water to penetrate the soil in the table at
the end of this activity. (For compact soils or soils with heavy clays, it
may take 5-15 minutes or more for water to completely filter.)

75
f.
Repeat this 4 more times at the same site. Spread the measurements out
by about 5 feet. (Students can do all trials at the same time if there are
enough cans and timers.)
g.
Add up each of these times and divide the total time by 5 to get the
average.
h.
While still at the area, use a hand lens to look for any microorganisms
that may be living in the soil. Turn over leaves, needles, and logs to see if
there are any invertebrates at the site. Record this as part of the site
description. Make sure to return logs to their original position, and
cover soil with litter again. Optional: use field guides to identify any
organisms found.
5.
Have each group present their findings to the class as a whole.
6.
Rank each area from fastest to slowest to percolate the soil. Were the
students’ hypotheses correct?
7.
Discuss how restoration projects might positively and/or negatively impact
soil based on these findings. Some discussion points might include:
•
Were there different kinds of plants growing at the site?  Were any of
these plant species exotic (non-native)?
•
Think of three things that might lead to soil compaction at a site.
•
Did anyone observe gullies from rain or other types of erosion? 
•
What effect might compacted soil have on the forest?  How would it
affect plants and animals?  How might it affect trees?
•
You might also discuss how performing repeated measurements affects
the accuracy of data.
8.
Discuss how data from monitoring bare soil and understory cover might
provide information related to soil compaction.

76
Possible Extension: 
Soil Erosion
In preparation for this extension, you will want to talk to your CFRP project partners to discuss
the location of the activity. Have students walk transects within or next to the monitoring site,
depending on what your project partners decide, using the following procedure:
• Have students randomly locate the beginning of the first transect by tossing a stick over their
shoulder.
• Have students lay out a 100-foot transect.
• Every 10 feet on the transect, have students describe the soil according to the table below
(Refer to Handbook 4, Understory Cover, for details on monitoring percent cover in an
area.)
• Students should record the soil condition on a data sheet at the end of this activity.
• Have students repeat this exercise with 6 additional transects, evenly spaced and parallel to
the first transect. Transects should be spaced every 100 feet.
• In the field or back in the class, have students analyze the data they collected. What percent
of the site sampled was in excellent condition?  What percent in good condition?  Fair?
Poor?
• Have the students create a diagram of the soil conditions at the site. Discuss areas where soil
conditions were excellent or poor. Have students suggest possible causes of these conditions.
• Overall, is the soil at this site excellent, good, fair, or poor?  
A. Soil intact with at
least 75% covering of
litter or understory
cover
Excellent 
B. Soil intact with 50-
75% covering of litter
or understory cover

Poor 
C. Soil mostly intact,
but more than 50%

at a case of
how forest
restoration
might affect

VVooccaabbuullaarryy: 
native species

endangered species
For the Birds
B
y design, restoration causes changes to the physical environment of a
forest. These changes can affect different species of wildlife in
different ways. A more open forest, with more patchy meadows, will
provide a better habitat for the many native species that are adapted to the
historic forest structure. The bright Western bluebird is one example of a
species that thrives in restored forests.
The big changes that accompany forest restoration may cause some
temporary unwanted impacts on wildlife. For example, restoration may
allow brown-headed cowbirds to take advantage of other birds while there
are newly created patch edges. In this activity, students will learn about the
potential for effects of forest restoration on cowbirds and other bird species.
This activity involves data from the “landscape openings” indicator in
Handbook 4, with possible classroom and field extensions.
Objectives  
Students will learn how forest restoration projects may have short term
negative effects. They will learn some of the biology of the brown-headed
cowbird and will understand the role of a brood parasite in forest ecology.
They will also learn that care must be taken to minimize short-term
unfavorable impacts of forest restoration.
Relevant Monitoring Goals 
conserve wildlife populations and habitats
Relevant Monitoring Indicators 
bird abundance and species composition, landscape openings
Background
Brown-headed cowbirds thrive near forest edges, where they can have access
to the nests of other birds. Cowbirds are brood parasites, which means that
they use other bird species to help them reproduce. Cowbirds do this by
laying their eggs in other bird species’ nests and letting these other birds raise
and feed their nestlings. They accomplish this by watching the nests of other

82
birds. When the adults fly away from the nest, the female cowbird
quickly lays an egg in the existing nest. Female cowbirds need to be
quick to avoid detection from the other birds. They can lay their eggs in
10-30 seconds. Once eggs are laid in one nest, the female cowbird
continues to lay eggs in other nests within the forest. One female can lay
20-40 eggs over 4-6 weeks.
Baby cowbirds also hatch very quickly, in 11-12 days. This is typically
faster than the other bird species. Baby cowbirds are also usually larger
than the species whose nests they occupy. The baby cowbirds can then
push eggs or babies of other species out of the nest so that the adult
birds will only feed and raise the cowbird.
Some of the host birds have evolved defenses against the cowbird. Some
of these birds push the cowbird eggs out of the nest. Others puncture
the egg. Still others pick up the eggs in their beaks and drop them away from the nest.
Other birds do not have any adaptation to the cowbird. These species of bird will raise
the cowbirds.
The process of restoring patches of forest, which have boundaries and create edges in the
forest, will provide more edge-habitats that will make other species of birds’ nests more
accessible to the cowbird. As more of the landscape is restored, there will be fewer edges
between forest patches. In the long-run, restoration across the landscape will allow the
native wildlife species, which are adapted to more natural structures of the forest, to
thrive.
Materials
•
Acetate (overhead or clear plastic) sheets, approximately 8.5 x 11 inches in size
•
Overhead writing markers in different colors, one of these should be brown
•
Photocopies of completed data sheets from the “landscape opening” method (data
sheet B in Handbook 4) from before and after treatments (if available). Or
photocopies of blank data sheets if monitoring data has not yet been collected.
•
Optional: Field guide for North American birds for students to identify brown-
headed cowbird and other bird species
•
Optional: “Winged Migration” video or DVD; photocopies of completed data sheets
from the bird abundance and species composition” method (data sheet C in
Handbook 4).
Preparation  
This activity will require students to have already collected data on “landscape openings”
as part of the monitoring project. Ideally, students will have collected, or have access to,
pre- and post-treatment data. If students have not collected this data, then this can be a
two-part activity, with the first component being a field activity, and the second part
being an analysis on data in the classroom or field. Students can also make a
hypothetical map of post-treatment data based on what the project calls for in its
treatment. For this latter option, you may need to talk to the project manager or Forest
Service personnel help with analysis of the project prescription.
Two brown-headed
cowbird eggs “snuck” 
into another bird 
species’ nest.

83
Procedure:
1.
Introduce the lesson by explaining that students are going to evaluate potential
effects of forest restoration on wildlife species. They will do this by creating maps of
landscape openings and edges in the forest restoration project area. They will use
these maps to evaluate the length of edges before the project began and the length of
edges created by the project. They will interpret this information in the context of
the potential effects the restoration project might have on both the cowbird, which
thrives on forest edges, and the other bird species the cowbird affects.
2.
Ask students to define a parasite. Ask them to make an educated guess as to what a
brood parasite might be. Ask students to come up with reasons why a brood parasite
might have evolved, and what other birds might do to adapt to a brood parasite.
3.
Explain that students will collect data on landscape openings in the project area. (If
students have already collected data, then they will skip this step.)  They will do this
by following the method in Handbook 4, page 25, for landscape openings.
4.
Students should mark the location of the following features along transects:
•
Project boundaries (B)
•
Roads (R)
•
Openings or meadows (OM)
•
Forest types (pinyon/juniper (PJ), ponderosa pine (PP))
•
Streams, riparian areas, or wetlands areas (W)
•
Seedling and sapling thickets (SST)
•
Oak thickets (O)
Students can create their own symbols if they want, or they may use the letter
abbreviations to mark each boundary.
5.
Using the data collected in Step 3 or in a previous monitoring site visit, students
should re-create the transects on a sheet of acetate (clear plastic). Break students into
groups and have them map the landscape features onto the acetate. They should
make these maps to scale so that they can tell how many feet each area encompasses.
They can use any color except brown for the symbols on the transects.
6.
Give each group a second sheet of acetate. Have them trace the boundaries of each
vegetation type. So, for example, they should draw a line around meadow areas,
pinyon-juniper woodlands, or wetland boundaries.
7.
Next have students place a third sheet of acetate over the first two. With a brown
marker, have students trace the outline of any landscape feature that creates an edge.
So, for example, project boundaries, roads, openings or meadows, or changes in
forest types all create edges.

84
8.
Have students calculate the total number of feet of edge that are created by the
project.
9.
If the project has already been treated, and students have collected pre- and post-
treatment data, have them repeat steps 3-8 with post-treatment data.
10. Have students compare the extent of edges, represented by feet, that are present in
the restoration area before and after the project.
11. Based on students’ findings from this activity, discuss how restoration projects might
positively and/or negatively impact bird species. Some discussion points might
include:
•
Does the project increase the length of edges in the forest?
•
How will an increase in edges affect bird species?  How will it affect the brown-
headed cowbird?  How will it affect other bird species?
•
Ask students to investigate whether there are any threatened or endangered
species that might nest in the area. Ask students whether the cowbird might
affect this species. (Remind students that cowbirds generally are parasitic only
on nests of birds that are smaller than the cowbird.)  Discuss how brood
parasitism may affect threatened or endangered species more than other native
bird species.
•
Are there ways that projects might be designed to minimize negative effects?
What might those be?  Optional: have students re-design the project treatment
so that it minimizes edge effects. Have students discuss the pros and cons of
alternative treatments in terms of fire or other wildlife considerations.
•
Remind students that brown-headed cowbirds are native birds, just like many
other bird species that live in the forest. Have students compare the parasitic
behavior of the cowbird to the predatory behavior of a hawk or eagle. What are
some of the human/emotional responses students have to the cowbird’s
behavior?  How is the cowbird’s behavior similar or different to the behavior of a
hawk?  To the bald eagle?
Possible Extensions
Extension 1: The video “Winged Migration” documents a newly-hatched
cowbird at work. The film shows this baby rolling the other eggs out of the
nest, demonstrating the behavior of a brood parasite. This documentation is in
the first segment of the film. You could show the clip as part of the discussion
or show more of the film to discuss the importance of habitats to both
migrating and resident birds, and how restoration projects might impact these
different species.
Extension 2: Take students into the field and walk the edges created by the
forest restoration project. Have them look for nests of any kind in trees. Or, if
monitoring bird species composition, have students look at the number of
species in the project area, and discuss how many of these species may have
nests that could be affected by cowbirds.

Bosque Boogie
T
his is a classroom activity that can be done indoors or outside in the
schoolyard. In this activity, students will create models of the bosque
system and will experiment with the germination of cottonwood
seedlings under different flooding patterns. Note: There is an excellent
modeling activity in The Bosque Education Guide, pages 162-189 that models
the bosque in the past, present and future and incorporates models of
cottonwood regeneration.
Many forests and other natural communities evolved with disturbances such
as fire and flooding. Cottonwood bosques along rivers were one of these
communities. Periodic flooding cleared away leaves and other debris and wet
the surface of sandy soils so that cottonwood seeds could germinate. Many
human activities, such as dam building and diversion of water for agriculture,
have changed the flooding patterns on rivers. Restoration of cottonwood
bosques may require artificial flooding, in order to re-create conditions that
will allow new cottonwood seedlings to grow.
Objectives  
Students will learn about historic and current flooding regimes in the bosque
woodland. They will understand the conditions required for cottonwood
seedlings to germinate, and will be able to apply this knowledge to issues of
restoration along the Rio Grande.
Relevant Monitoring Goals  
conserve and protect riparian communities
Relevant Monitoring Indicators 
density and size of live trees, seedling density, classification of plant

86
Materials
•
4 large rectangular tubs, approximately 24” square and 10” deep
•
Sandy soil
•
Small trowel
•
Colored paper to represent houses, agricultural fields, levees
•
Cottonwood seeds
•
Water
Preparation
There are a number of ways to create the bosque models that will be used for this activity.
One simple way is to use plastic washtubs that can be filled with sand and “flooded” to
varying degrees. You will want to fill the plastic tubs in advance with sandy soil.
Procedure
1. Introduce the lesson by telling students they will be creating models of the Rio Grande
to understand the conditions cottonwood trees need to germinate.
2. Start out with one plastic tub filled with sand. Have students create a general model
of what the Rio Grande looks like today. If students have visited the project site, have
them make a model of this area. Have students incorporate the following items into
the model. The river, tributaries, sand bars, and ditches can be made by digging
channels into the sand with a small trowel.
•
The Rio Grande
•
Any relevant tributaries
•
Sand bars
•
Any irrigation ditches
•
Levees
•
Agricultural fields
•
Houses
•
Locations of monitoring transects and plots
3.
Give students a pre-determined number of cottonwood seeds (at least 30 seeds total).
Explain that cottonwood seeds are dispersed by the wind.
4.
Have students blow the seeds onto the model and see where they land.

87
5.
Next have students determine how many of these seeds could actually germinate and
survive. (Seeds that land in the river, tributaries, irrigation ditches, levees, houses, or
agricultural ditches would not germinate and survive.)
6.
Ask students to calculate the percentage of seeds that could germinate. (For example,
if 3 seeds landed in the floodplain of the river, and 30 seeds were thrown, then 3/30
or 10% of seeds could germinate.)
7.
Discuss what other factors might affect whether these seeds will germinate. Explain
that cottonwoods need bare soil, wet soil, and sunlight in order to germinate. Have
students look at the model to see if this would reduce further the number of seeds
that can germinate.
8.
Introduce the concept of overbank flooding. Explain that before major changes were
made to the Rio Grande (through the creation of irrigation ditches, levies, jetty jacks,
and other water diversions), the banks of the river would flood. Tell students that
cottonwoods are adapted to this flooding regime, and that they rely on flooding for
germination. Explain that overbank flooding provided at least two purposes: 1) it
moved shrubs, cattails and other riparian vegetation downstream, thereby creating
open spaces where cottonwood seeds could germinate; 2) it provided soil that was
wet enough for the cottonwood seeds to germinate.
9.
Explain that human influences have affected the timing and extent of flooding in the
bosque. Break students into 3 groups and give them the remaining three tubs filled
with sand and 30 seeds per group. Tell them that they will each be testing the
number of seeds that germinate under different flooding regimes:
a.
Flooding Regime 1: Overbank flooding (represented by complete flooding of the
sandbox so that sand is completely saturated)
b.
Flooding Regime 2: High water table (represented by moist sand that is not
completely saturated)
c.
Flooding Regime 3: Controlled water flow. No flooding. Reduced water table.
(represented by dry sand)
10. Have students create hypotheses for which flooding regime will have the greatest
germination of cottonwood seeds and have them explain their thinking for these
hypotheses.
11. Have each student take an equal number of cottonwood seeds (a total of 30 per
group). As in Step 4, have students blow the seeds into the sand box.

88
12. Leave the seeds in a sunny window or area where there is good, natural light for
approximately 12 hours (the length of time cottonwood seeds are supposed to need
to germinate).
13. After 12 or more hours, check the sand box to see how many seeds germinated under
each flood regime.
14. As in Step 6, ask each group to calculate the percentage of seeds that germinated
under each flooding condition.
15. Ask students from each group to present their findings to the class as a whole.
Request that students give explanations that relate to cottonwoods’ needs for
germination (bare soil, sunlight, and wet soil).
16. Were the students’ hypotheses correct?  Have students explain why or why not.
17. Discuss how restoration projects might positively and/or negatively impact
cottonwood germination. Some discussion points might include:
•
Does the project remove non-native plants and create openings that provide bare
soil?
•
Does the project create openings that allow full sunlight to hit the ground?
•
Will cottonwoods germinate in areas that are not flooded (such as areas that
receive rainfall only)?
•
Are there any plans in the project to re-create overbank flooding within the
bosque?  If so are there other conditions present (bare soil, ample sunlight) so
that cottonwoods could germinate?
•
If the project re-creates overbank flooding once, will this be enough to maintain
the cottonwood forest over time?  What other factors will affect this?  (Human
uses of water, continued flooding, other plant species that grow into open spaces)

What’s in a Watershed?
Adapted from The Streamkeeper’s Field Guide, pages 18-42  
M
ost restoration projects are located in a patch of forest that is part
of a much larger watershed. Ideally, many restoration projects will
collectively contribute to overall restoration across the landscape.
Yet restoration activities in a small area still can impact water, soil, plants and
animals far downstream from where these actions take place. This activity
combines scientific concepts of watersheds and watershed health with human
influences that affect these. It is designed to be a research activity so that
students learn to gather information from a variety of sources and investigate
questions. It provides information on a broad scale that can encompass a
CFRP restoration project.
Objectives 
Students will learn some basic characteristics of their watershed. They will
learn to delineate a watershed on a topographic map, and will gain
experience in gathering information from diverse sources.
Relevant Monitoring Goals  
Enhance native plants/reduce non-native plants, conserve wildlife
populations and habitats, conserve soil resources, conserve and protect
riparian communities
Relevant Monitoring Indicators  
understory plant species composition, bird species and abundance, butterfly
species and abundance, classification of plant community structure
Materials
•
USGS topographic map
•
Copies of worksheet
•
Optional: plant identification guides, animal identification guides

90
Preparation   
You will need to obtain a topographic map that encompasses your watershed. To do so,
you may contact a local office of the U.S. Geological Survey, or visit the website:
terraserver-usa.com to download a free map. (Or you may have students do this as part
of the activity.)  You may want to look at these maps in advance to determine if you will
study an entire watershed or a sub-watershed. If your class is monitoring part of the Rio
Grande bosque, you may want to identify a sub-watershed, since the Rio Grande
watershed is so large (see box at left).
You also may want to talk to CFRP project partners, especially agency personnel, about
sources of information that students may access. Some good sources of local and
regional information on watersheds are listed in Appendix 2.
Procedure
1.
Introduce the concept of a watershed.
2.
Explain that students will be identifying their
watershed and will be researching the characteristics
of this watershed in order to better understand how
restoration actions fit into a larger landscape.
3.
Have students identify the watershed that contains
the location of the restoration project they are
monitoring. They can do this by visiting
www.epa.gov/surf/ or by physically examining a
topographic map.
4.
If physically examining a topographic map, either
provide students with a map, or have them obtain a
map from one of several sources (the New Mexico USGS District and www.terra-
usa.com are two good sources listed in Appendix 2).
5.
Explain that the contour lines on the topographic map represent different elevations
of land. Have them identify familiar locations on the map and determine the
elevations of these places from contour lines.
The Rio Grande 
Watershed covers 
a vast area, including:
•
Parts of Colorado, 
New Mexico, and 
Texas states in 
the U.S.
•
Parts of Chihuahua,
Coahuila, Nuevo Leon,
Tamaulipas, and
Durango states in
Mexico

91
6.
To delineate the watershed, have students follow these steps:
a.
Identify the location of the CFRP project on the map
b.
Next, find the lowest elevation point near this location on the map. (Generally, it
will be the base of a stream or another body of water. For bosque projects, it will
the Rio Grande itself.)
c.
Trace this body of water from its mouth to its tributaries.
d.
At intervals of 1/4 inch to 1 inch (depending on size of watershed), draw lines
perpendicular to the stream or river out to the highest point (the contour line
that shows the highest elevation). Mark these points with dots.
e.
Repeat steps C and D for each tributary.
f.
When each tributary is finished, connect all the dots, with a dotted line that runs
perpendicular to contour lines. This is the watershed boundary.
g.
Make sure that the boundaries make sense.
7.
Once the watershed has been delineated, it will be possible for students to answer
some of the questions on the worksheet following this exercise under the “watershed
overview” section.
8.
You may either have students complete this section of the worksheet only and
conclude the lesson, or have them continue to identify information about the
watershed over the course of several days or as homework.

92
Possible Extension:
After completing the worksheet in that follows this activity, take students out to
investigate the watershed. There are many resources that can help with this, including
the Bosque Education Guide, New Mexico Watershed Watch, and the Streamkeeper’s
Field Guide (see Appendix 2). Watershed investigations can include indicators of stream
health, such as macroinvertebrates, stream channelization, bank stability, and structural
diversity of vegetation.

APPENDIX 1
Other Fun Things to Do
The following are general observations or short activities that students can make when in
the field. These can be folded into any of the above activities, or blended into days when
students are collecting monitoring data.
Behold, the bark beetle.
Bark beetles can affect both pinyon and ponderosa pine trees. If you are working in an
area with either of these tree species, you can look for signs of the beetles. One sign is
dead trees, with orange needles still on the branches. Actual signs of beetles can include a
yellowish, warty looking sap encrusted on the bark of infested trees, or sawdust material at
the edges of holes, particularly in wood that is already on the ground. For trees already on
the ground, you can also lift off bark and sometimes see grooves left in the wood by the
bark beetles. You might discuss how bark beetles are a natural part of forests, and that
they serve important ecological roles. Resources for information about bark beetles are
provided in Appendix 2.
Browsing for butterflies.  
Some animal species respond very quickly to restoration actions. These are called wildlife
indicators. One example of a wildlife indicator is butterflies, which respond to changes in
light (by creating openings in the forest) or changes in air temperatures (altered by
changes in tree structure and other vegetation changes). Butterflies also can respond to an
increase in understory plant cover and understory species composition. You can have
students observe the number and diversity of butterflies by using the monitoring method
in Handbook 4, page 27. Or you can simply have groups of students sit quietly in
different microhabitats (open areas, shady areas, areas with many different plants, areas
with only a few plants, areas along roads, areas near water, etc.) for 15 minutes or more,
and have them draw or describe the types of butterflies they observe in this time frame.
Students can then compare the diversity of species they find in these areas.
Counting the rings.  
In many project areas, there will be stumps of ponderosa pine or other trees that have
been cut as part of the project or in the past. Have students study these stumps. They can
count rings on these trees to estimate the age of the tree when it was cut; they can look for
variations in tree ring width and try to determine what might have caused these
variations; and they can look for fire scars or beetle infestations. While some trees are easy
to observe, others are too roughly cut to make observations with any detail. Sometimes
sanding the tree stump with rough sand paper can help increase visibility of tree rings. If
you think you might want to have students make these observations, carry some rough
grain sandpaper and a hand lens (or two) with you.

98
Sightings on snags.  
Snags – or dead, standing trees – are important for many species of wildlife. Bacteria and
fungi feed on bark, causing it to decay. Many insects feed on the decaying bark. Several
species of bird, such as sapsuckers or woodpeckers, then feed on these insects. Have
students look for signs of beetles and the birds that feed on them. Remind students that
snags do provide habitat for many animals and to treat each snag carefully. They can pull
off small pieces of bark to make observations (making sure to leave most of the snag
intact. Rows of small holes generally signal that sapsuckers have been at work on the tree.
Snags are also important for cavity-nesting birds. These birds rely on the rotted wood to
make cavities (holes) where they lay their eggs and nest. Some of these birds include
northern flickers, house wrens, and mountain bluebirds. Have students look for these
birds or signs of them. If you are in the field during the breeding season, have students
look quietly for birds from a distance and be careful not to disturb any nesting areas. A
field guide may help to identify nests or birds themselves. In addition, look for bird use
along older lightning scars in the bark, and dead portions of living trees.
Sniffing for butterscotch.  
The sap of ponderosa pine trees is particularly fragrant in the spring and fall months,
when sap is moving up and down the tree in greater abundance. Some say the sap smells
like butterscotch. Students can smell the sap by sticking their nose into the open areas, or
cracks, of ponderosa pine bark. Ask students what it smells like to them.
Where am I?  
Many monitoring projects use GPS (Global Positioning System) to mark the locations of
transects and photopoints. Students often ask where the information comes from within
the GPS. The simplest explanation is the GPS gathers information from different satellites
to determine a location or position. Another, more technical way, to explain this is that
the GPS “triangulates” information from different satellites. So that students better
understand this, you can have three students form a triangle, standing about 20 feet apart
from each other. Have a fourth student stand anywhere inside the triangle formed by the
three students. Give each of the three triangle-forming students a compass, and ask them
to determine the compass direction between where the middle student stands and where
the triangle-students are standing. Then have students draw this on paper. Each of the
three compass bearings should point to the same direction: to the location of the fourth
student. Explain that this is the same concept used by GPS. The GPS unit gets different
readings (the compass bearings of the example) for a particular position (the fourth
student in the example), and that these give a location in space.

APPENDIX 3
Glossary
Glossary terms have been adapted from a variety of sources, including FireWorks
Curriculum and Handbook 4: Monitoring Ecological Effects of CFRP Projects.
Adaptation: Something about an organism that helps it survive and reproduce; an aspect
of its form, function, or behavior that helps it out-compete other organisms.
Adult Tree: For ponderosa pine, trees with a diameter of 5 inches or larger can be
considered adult trees. For juniper or pinyon, trees that are taller than 4.5 feet can be
considered adult trees.
Aquifer: An area of land that contains water. Most aquifers are below ground, generally
flowing through a layer of rock or soil. People can often access water from aquifers
through wells.
Alpine meadow: An open area, primarily of grasses and forbs, located in the higher
zones of mountains.
Bark: The tissue that covers stems, branches, and roots of a tree or shrub.
Biodiversity. Variety of living organisms. See diversity.
Bosque: A Spanish word for woods. In the Southwest, bosque refers to the cottonwood
forests that line the banks of the Rio Grande and other major waterways.
Botanist: A person who studies plants.
Brood parasite: An organism that uses other species to help them reproduce and rear
their young.
Cambium: A thin layer of tissue, located between the bark and the central wood of a
tree, where all plant growth occurs.
Canopy cover: The area in a forest covered by tree crowns, measured as the percentage
of horizontal cover of the ground that the canopy covers.
Cavity: A hole or hollow place, usually used to refer to a hole in a tree that is used by
animals for nesting.
Cavity nester: An animal that uses holes in trees for raising young. Common cavity-
nesting birds include northern flickers, house wrens, and mountain bluebirds.

104
Charred fuels: Fuel that is partly burnt. Usually part of the fuel is blackened.
Combustion: The process of burning, which requires fuel, oxygen, and heat.
Community (Ecological): All of the living organisms that occupy and influence a certain
habitat.
Community (Sociological): All the people who reside in one physical area, or who share
the same ideas and interests across physical space.
Competition: When two or more organisms seek an environmental resource that may be
in short supply.
Composition: A list of all the species that live in an area.
Cone: The physical structure that stores seeds of coniferous plants.
Contour lines: Lines on a topographic map that represent areas that have the same

usually expressed as a percentage. Also, the cover of the ground by dead plants and
plant parts, usually called litter.
Crown: The uppermost leafy portion of a tree.
Crown fire: A fire that burns in the canopy of trees. Crown fires can begin as surface
fires and then move into the tops, or “crowns,” of trees. Then they move rapidly
from one crown to another, especially if the wind is strong. During a crown fire, the
wind sometimes carries burning branches far ahead of the fire. These “firebrands”
can start new fires. A spotting fire “leapfrogs” through the forest, so it can move very
fast, especially when it is windy.
Data: A set of observations collected through measurements. The word “data” is plural.
The singular form of data is “datum.”
Degraded: Reduced quality or condition.
Delineation: Marking the outline of something by drawing lines.

rings.
Density: The number of plants or animals in a given area. For example, tree density is
often measured in trees per acre.

include roads cut through forests, or boundaries set for a forest treatment. However,
the use of historical evidence helps create edges similar to those that existed in the
past.

106
Forester: A person who studies forests and is involved in forest management and use.

dead woody material from logs and branches, leaves of trees and shrubs, pine
needles, grasses, and other plants.
Fuel moisture: The amount of moisture in fuels, expressed as a percent of dry weight.
Fuel moisture influences flammability.
Germinate: This term comes from the Latin, germinare, which means “to sprout.” Seeds
germinate when they begin to grow. Initial signs of germination include the
production of a stem with one or two “seed leaves” called cotyledons.
Goal: A general summary of the desired state that a project is working to achieve. A
good goal meets the criteria of being visionary, relatively general, brief, and
measurable. A goal is typically less specific than an objective.
Ground cover: The cover that grasses, forbs, and other plants cast on the forest floor.
Ground cover also includes other materials on the ground, such as needles, leaf litter,
and rocks. Ground cover is usually expressed as a percentage.
Ground fire: After a surface fire burns through an area, patches of deep fuel may
continue smoldering. This is called a ground fire. Ground fires burn the fallen leaves
and small branches that have started to decay and become part of the soil. Ground
fires don’t move very fast and hardly make any flames. They can take days or even
weeks to burn themselves out.
Growth ring: The annual layer of growth in a tree. Also referred to as a tree ring.
Habitat: The place where an organism is usually found and includes food, water, shelter,
and nesting conditions that the organism needs to survive.
Heartwood: The central woody core of a tree trunk. Heartwood provides structural
support to the tree. It is made of dead xylem cells.

specific condition. A good indicator meets the criteria of being measurable, precise,
consistent, and sensitive to change.

107

trees that fill the space between the forest floor and tree crowns with flammable
material. Ladder fuels provide a “ladder” from the forest floor to the tops of trees.
Litter: The top layer of soil comprised of a variety of organic material such as dead
needles, twigs, branches, and dead grasses and forbs.
Model: An object made to represent something that exists, or a mathematical model that
helps explain hypothetical relationships.
Monitoring: The periodic collection and evaluation of data relative to stated project
goals, objectives, and activities.
Mortality: The number of deaths in a given time and place.
Multiparty: Involving members from a variety of backgrounds and perspectives.
Native species: A species of plant or animal that naturally occurs in a place.
Needle: A long, narrow specialized leaf, such as a pine needle.
Objective: A specific statement detailing the desired accomplishments or outcomes of a
project. If the project is well conceptualized and well designed, realization of a
project’s objectives should lead to the fulfillment of the project’s goals. A good
objective meets the criteria of being impact oriented, measurable, time limited,
specific, and practical. Objectives are more specific than goals.
Old-growth forest: Patches of forest where old and large trees are found along with trees
of other sizes and ages. A forest that has been undisturbed for a long time.
Overbank flooding: When water spreads out over the river banks and into adjacent
riparian areas. This occurs when there is more water in the river than the river
channel can hold.
Overgrazing: Grazing, usually by cattle or other domesticated animals, to the extent that
plants cannot easily grow and soil is degraded.
Oxygen: One of the most common gases in the Earth’s atmosphere. Oxygen is produced
through photosynthesis of plants and is used during combustion and respiration.
Pack rat middens: Areas where pack rats store quantities of plant material, seeds, and
other items. Remains from these middens can provide clues to forest history when
they are carbon-dated.
Parasite: An organism that obtains benefits in some way from another organism (the
host), usually by harming the other organism.
Phloem. The outer layer of cells produced by a woody plant’s cambium. Phloem cells
carry sugars and nutrients from the photosynthetic tissue in leaves to other parts of
the plant.

Prescription: A description of actions to be taken in order to achieve forest management
objectives.
Reference conditions: The natural or historical conditions of ecosystems that are being
restored.
Regeneration: The processes plants use to maintain and expand their populations over
time. Regeneration may be through sexual reproduction or vegetative propagation.
Restoration: The process of returning more natural conditions to ecosystems that have
been damaged by human activities.
Riparian community: A group of plant and animal species that are related to or grow
along the edges of streams, rivers, and other watercourses, including dry streambeds.
Sampling: Measuring a subset of individuals, households, trees, or other factors in a
population.
Sap: Liquid that circulates through a plant’s vascular system.
Sapling: A tree that is taller than 4.5 feet and has a diameter of less than 5 inches.
Sapwood: The outer woody part of a tree trunk, which surrounds the dead, woody
center (heartwood). Sapwood is another term for xylem, the cells that transport
water and nutrients from roots to leaves and branches.
Scat: Feces from animals, such as a bear or coyote.
Seedling: A young tree that has not reached sapling size.
Size class: A category for organizing trees into classes of seedlings, saplings, and adult
trees.
Slash: Debris, such as branches and needles, that remains on the ground after a thinning.
Slope: The steepness of a hillside.
Snag: A dead, standing tree. Snags provide important habitat for birds, small animals,
insects, and fungi. Living snags, where only part of the tree is dead, also provided
habitat and may have been the dominant source of snag habitat in a frequent-fire
forest.

109
Soil compaction: Soil that is compressed. When soil is compacted it generally loses its
porosity, making it difficult for gases to move, water to spread, and plants to grow.
Soil moisture: The amount of water held in soil pores.
Soil resources: All the components and functions of soil, including the minerals and
nutrients of soil, the organisms that live in soil, and seed stores.

ecosystem.
Surface area: The total area covering the outside (surfaces) of an object.
Surface fire: Fires that burn along the forest floor. Surface fires burn fallen leaves and
branches, and wildflowers and grasses on the forest floor. Surface fires also burn
bushes and small trees, but they do not burn the tops of grown trees. Surface fires
kill a tree only when they are hot enough to damage the roots or kill the growing cells
under the tree’s bark.
Thinning: The process of cutting some, but not all, trees in an area. The removal of
trees (usually small diameter) from a forested area according to a set prescription.
Threatened: A species with an uncertain chance of survival. Generally, a category
considered less “serious” than endangered because there are more individuals from a
threatened species that live in the wild (than individuals of endangered species).
Topographic map: A map that shows the natural features of a landscape, such as changes
in elevation.
Transect: An area, usually along a straight line, that is used for sampling and
measurements.
Treatment: The actions to achieve forest management objectives, usually according to a
prescription.
Tree cookie: A cross-section cutting of a tree, showing all growth rings and the inner
pith.
Tree ring: The annual layer of growth in a tree. Also referred to as a growth ring.

110
Understory: Plants that grow close to the ground in a forest. These include grasses,
forbs, and woody shrubs.
Volatile: Substances that evaporate readily at room temperature.
Volume: The amount of space an object occupies.
Watershed: An area that encompasses all drainages and catchments, bounded by ridges
that separate water flowing into rivers and basins from other water flows. The term
watershed is also used to refer generally to “drainage basins,” which can be smaller or
“sub” watersheds.
Water table: The layer of soil that is completely saturated with soil, usually some feet
beneath the soil surface.
Wildlife: Animals which are not tamed or domesticated.
Wildlife indicators: Animal species, such as birds and butterflies, that can help show
changes in an ecosystem.
Xylem: The inner layer of cells, produced by a woody plant’s cambium. Xylem is also
called sapwood, and transports water and nutrients from roots to leaves and
branches.
