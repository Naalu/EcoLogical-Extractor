Restoration at the Landscape Scale
Western Mogollon Plateau Adaptive Landscape Assessment
The Forest Ecosystem Restoration Analysis (ForestERA) platform is an interactive, GIS-based tool
that can be used by experts and non-experts to prioritize areas for treatment, assign management
options, and explore the predicted effects of management actions, all on a landscape scale.
Collaboration
A diverse group of stakeholders worked together 
to identify and prioritize landscape features at 
risk from catastrophic fire and preferred 
management actions to reduce the fire threat.

Science
The ForestERA platform uses the best 
available science, allowing experts and 
non-experts to explore current 
conditions and predicted effects 
together. Workshop participants used 
high-quality data layers to identify risks 
and values across the landscape.

Prioritization
The group produced maps showing areas of greatest 
priority for restoration, recommended treatment intensity, 
and level of agreement among stakeholders. These maps 
have been used in national forest planning and in the 
creation of the Flagstaff Area Community Wildfire 
Protection Plan.
