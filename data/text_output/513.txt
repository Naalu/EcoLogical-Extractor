Broader-Scale Monitoring Workshops
The U.S. Forest Service’s (USFS) 2012 Planning Rule directs its Regional
Ofﬁces to develop a broader-scale monitoring strategy that can inform forest
management. The goal of broader-scale monitoring is to look across multiple
forests, incorporate common USFS forest plan questions, and provide
opportunities for coordination with partners. To assist in supporting the
development of a broader-scale monitoring framework, ERI is conducting a
series of four workshops this spring across the USFS Rocky Mountain Region
(Region 2) and the Southwestern Region (Region 3).
 
Planners, monitoring specialists and data managers from federal and state
natural resource management agencies, tribes, local governments, non-
government organizations, and academic institutions are participating in the

workshops to share existing efforts, identify gaps and data needs, and develop
strategies for landscape-scale monitoring for forest planning purposes. The
workshop outcomes will be shared widely to aid other USFS regions in
developing similar processes to more effectively and collaboratively collect and
assess resource information and make management decisions.

Restoration Institutes (SWERI) Broad-Scale Monitoring web page.

Ecologists evaluated reference conditions of an uncut ponderosa pine stand
representing a far end of the range of variability in terms of regionally unusual
environmental conditions. Researchers used a forest reconstruction model and
regression analysis to determine 1883 structural and spatial reference
conditions and compared those to the contemporary (2010) stand.

Restoration Institute, Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, AZ. 3 p.
 
The 2014 San Juan Fire burned through an area where ERI and the Apache-
Sitgreaves National Forests had recently implemented restoration treatments
as part of study. After the ﬁre, ERI ecologists found that the full restoration
treatment was the only one that rapidly shifted forest structure, diameter
distributions, and canopy fuels values to levels near or within the historical
reference conditions.

Rim, Northern Arizona, USA. ERI Fact Sheets. Ecological Restoration Institute,

Ecologists reconstructed ﬁre regime characteristics of a mixed-conifer forest on
the Black Mesa Ranger District of the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests.
They found that the historical ﬁre regime was one of high frequency, low-
severity ﬁres and that current conditions call for ecological restoration
treatments. These ﬁndings were in sharp contrast to a study based on Public
Land Survey records that presumed the area experienced historically high-
severity ﬁres.

This fact sheet summarizes results from a study that evaluated historical
reference conditions of an uncut ponderosa pine site that characterized
underrepresented forest conditions. Ecologists analyzed the site’s spatial
patterns to aid in developing restoration prescriptions and predicting future
stand development and management outcomes.

Institute, Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, AZ. 2 p.
A team of researchers compared restoration treatments in a warm/dry mixed-
conifer forest in southwestern Colorado to determine which treatment is most
effective in maintaining forest structure, function, and resiliency. Results
suggest that full restoration increases a forest’s ability to withstand
disturbances like drought, insect infestation, and high-severity ﬁre in the face of
a changing climate.

ERI ecologists found that ﬁve years after treatment in a Long-term Ecological
Assessment and Restoration Network (LEARN) research project, understory
cover was signiﬁcantly greater in units that received both tree thinning and
prescribed ﬁre, compared with the untreated control.

Research and Development
2016 Summer Field Season Outlook
By ERI R&D Staff
 
Resource Objective Wildﬁre Project 
There is increasing interest in managing natural ﬁre ignitions to achieve
restoration objectives across forest landscapes. In 2015, we studied 10 large
“resource objective” wildﬁres on the Coconino and Kaibab national forests and
examined speciﬁc attributes related to forest structure, function, and fuels. In
2016, we will expand this research and ﬁeld crews will collect data on several
additional ﬁres. Research questions will focus on ecological conditions within
areas that have experienced more than one resource objective wildﬁre.
 
Leroux Fire
The Leroux Fire on the San Francisco Peaks burned 1,240 acres of warm/dry
mixed conifer forest in 2001. In 2016, ERI crews will re-measure 24 sample
plots within the ﬁre to better understand how ﬁre severity and climate interact to
affect changes in species composition and vegetation structure. Information
from this work will be useful to land managers for planning post-ﬁre restoration
activities.   
 
Wallow Fire

This summer marks the ﬁfth anniversary of the Wallow Fire, the largest wildﬁre
ever recorded in Arizona.  ERI crews will be revisiting mixed-conifer monitoring
plots to record changes to the forest understory communities that have
occurred since the ﬁre. In addition, ERI will team up with entomologists from
Region 3 Forest Health Protection (U.S. Forest Service) researchers to study
post-ﬁre bark beetle outbreaks in the treated and untreated areas. Results of
these projects will be reported in 2017.
 
G.A. Pearson Natural Area, Ft. Valley Experimental Forest
The G.A. Pearson site on Fort Valley Experimental Forest just west of Flagstaff
is home to one of the oldest forest restoration studies in the Southwest. In
collaboration with Drs. Margaret Moore and Pete Fulé (NAU School of
Forestry), Dr. Keith Moser (USFS Rocky Mountain Research Station), and Dr.
Rob Strahan (New Mexico Highlands University), ERI staff and ﬁeld crews will
collect data to investigate 20-year, post-restoration treatment responses at the
site during the summer of 2016. This research is being support by a grant from
the Joint Fire Science Program.

Agency Outreach
By Bruce Greco, Director of Agency Outreach
   
The mild 2015/2016 winter season has enabled the Agency Outreach group
(AO) to continue ﬁeld visits with U.S. Forest Service (USFS) personnel on
several national forests in the Southwest. The AO group has focused on data
collection and analysis on several key USFS projects in the agency’s
Southwestern Region (Region 3). They also participate in on-going

Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration (CFLR) projects and provide
science support to restoration implementation efforts. A few projects include:
 
Escudillia West Restoration Project 
Springerville/Alpine Ranger District, Apache-Sitgreaves NF: ERI has completed
rapid assessment data collection by working with the forest personnel to
provide a rapid assessment study and report on a ~64,000-acre restoration
project. This project includes a variety of forest vegetative species ranging from
mixed-conifer to lower elevation woodland species.
 
Mixed Conifer LEARN Study Plots 
Mogollon Rim Ranger District, Coconino NF: Staff is working with ERI’s
Research and Development group to facilitate the implementation of a long-
term study that will provide information about treatment alternatives in Mexican
spotted owl (MSO) habitat in mixed-conifer ecosystems.
 
Tonto NF Forest Plan Revision
The AO group is providing an overview of ecological restoration concepts and a
historical overview of forested ecosystems on the Tonto NF to assist in their
forest plan revision process.
 
White Mountain Stewardship 10-Year Final Report
The ﬁnal report for the White Mountain Stewardship Project (WMSP), which
concluded in August 2014, is being compiled and is scheduled for release in
late summer 2016. Dr. Yeon Su Kim, NAU School of Forestry, compiled the
economic assessment of the contract, which included detailed economic data
and surveys with woods product companies associated with the WMSP.
 
USFS Southwestern Region Outreach 
The AO group has conducted rapid assessments and the installation of a
restoration demonstration unit on the Tres Piedras Ranger District, Carson NF;
installed a mixed-conifer restoration demonstration unit on the Safford Ranger
District, Coronado NF; conducted a rapid assessment analyzing MSO habitat
on the Bradshaw Ranger District, Prescott NF; and provided science support to
several forest land management plan revision processes.
