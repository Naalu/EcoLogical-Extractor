Abstract. 
Grazing of domestic livestock is the most pervasive and persistent hu­
man impact on the grasslands and shrublands of the Colorad o Plateau. Impacts on 
ecosystem function and biological diversity arc thought to be great, but few studies have 
attempted to characterize such effects and compare the impacts of altern ative livestock 
management practices. The dearth of pertinent, defensible information has contributed 
to the polarization of ranching and environmental interests, and has exacerbated what is 
one of the most contentious social issues in the southwestern USA. \VIc discuss the role 
of ecological science in deriving and disseminating information that will help focus and 
perhaps resolve the impasse ov er grazing impacts and other natural resource issues. 
Specifically,we describe results of ou r involvement in "management teams" that include 
ranchers, environmentali sts, public servants, and interested citizens, and how this col­
laborative process has helped shape an experimental research program that would be 
impos sible to execute without the involvement of divergent interests in the grazing 
fi J 

: debate. Claims of various interest groups are reformulated as testable hypotheses, and a 
research design is presented.

INTRODUCTION 
Grazing of domestic livestock is the most pervasive and persistent 
human impact on grasslands and shrublands of the arid Southwest 
(Fleischner 1994). The practice oflivestock grazing affects approximately 
70% of western states (Fleischner 1994), and 86% of the land surface in 
Arizona (Mayes and Archer 1982). Since the 1860's, the cattle industry 
has played a significant role in the social, cultural and political develop­
ment of Arizona (Schlegel 1992) and, along with other factors, it has 
'.' brought profound ecological change (Hastings and Turner 1965, Bahre 
1991). 
Today, the ubiquitous practice of cattle grazing in the arid West, in 
.' general, and Arizona, in particular, is an intensely contentious social issue 
(Dagget 1995). Widespread rangeland degradation has led public inter­
est groups to challenge traditional grazing practices and demand a policy 
.that will insure long-term productivity of public rangelands and the con­
servation of native biological diversity (e.g., Cooperrider and Wilcove 
·1995, Southwest Forest Alliance 1996). Meanwhile, ranchers facing weak­
,:,' .... ening markets and declining profits, have fiercely resisted cutbacks in 
•. .' '• .. grazing allotments, increased fees, and greater regulation (Hecox and Ack 
: 
1996). Polarization of the policy debate has led to an impasse among 
ranchers, environmentalists, and resource managers regarding appropri­
. ate management of public lands (Brown and McDonnell 1995, 
Cooperrider and Wilcove 1995). Continuing debate, court actions, and 
' 
'.. pending lawsuits may have profound impacts on ranching and the future 
" 
use of public lands in the Southwest. While it is clear that livestock graz­
ing will remain an important economic activity and land use on me Colo­
rado Plateau and throughout the region, it is also clear that grazing will be 
restricted or eliminated on some public lands. Which lands to graze, and 
how best to graze them, are pressing questions. How these questions are 
answered will greatly impact the ecological condition of the arid South­
:. : . 
west, as well as the future of one of the region's few significant food 
.i: production systems. 
A ROLE FOR SCIENCE 
Like many environmental issues, the grazing deb~te is so polarized 
that it often seems that there is little room for science. 
Positionsha~e 
been staked out for years, and scientific input often is reduced to apa- ··
radc of "expert witnesses" presenting opposing interpretations ofexist­
ing information. Yet many environmental issues rise to public 'promi­
nence precisely because existing scientific information is equivocal ~:ir i~~ 
adequate and, therefore, subject to misuse or misinterpretation (Ehrlich 
and Ehrlich 1996). Certainly there is no shortage of published 'research 
addressing many aspects of domestic livestock raising; however, 'much 
of this information fails to address directly the issues that have become .
pivotal to the grazing debate, namely the impacts of grazing on range­
land productivity and biological diversity. The impacts of domesticlive- .:
stock on arid rangeland productivity and biological diversity are thought ' 
to be great, but quantitative information comparing different grazing 
approaches is SCant. Furthermore, many studies comparing grazed and 
ungrazed areas have been criticized on methodological grounds because 
they rely on small exclosure areas for ungrazed sites (Bock et al. 1993), "
employ questionable photographic comparison techniques, or employ: 
unreplicated designs in field comparisons (Brown and Waller 1986» > 
Objective evaluation of the many conflicting statements regarding 
the impacts of overgrazing or the benefits of certain range management ".
techniques are further complicated by the failure of many advocates to 
clearly articulate specific claims and the response variables being discussed; 
Terms like "rangeland health," "biodiversity," "overgrazing," ,and , ~ 
"ovcrrest" can mask the specifics and make it tempting to drowrll~giti~ 
mate debate in arguments over vague generalities. The current grazing 
controversy, for example, often focuses on two distinct topics: ecosys­
tem productivity and biological diversity. Unfortunately, references to 
these very different issues are often confused and muddled in discussions 
of "range condition" or "ecosystem health. " 
For these reasons, we have initiated a study of ecological factorsthat 
we believe undergird much of the controversy over grazing practices in 
the Southwest. Our first objective is to identify the points of conflict that ' 
emerge from differing claims regarding the ecological impacts of live­
stock grazing. We believe that if scientists are to contribute to solving real 
environmental problems they must strive to understand the issues that' ' 
underlie and sustain conflict. By focusing research on these issues, we 
hope that it will be possible to engage a diverse group of landowners; 
public servants, and interested citizens to support and participate in .ef­

forts to improve our understanding of certain ecological factors that all 
agree are important determinants of environmental quality on arid range­
lands (fable 1). 
For the past three years we have participated in "management teams" 
- loosely organized groups of ranchers, environmentalists, agency offi­
, cials, and interested citizens who arc working collectively to improve 
management practices on private and public rangelands in Arizona. This 
,experience has helped us to develop a research program that addresses 
questions of import to land managers and is broadly understood and 
appreciated by people on different sides of the grazing debate. 
COMMON GROUND: 
SUSTAINABLE ECOSYSTEMS 
One idea that is shared almost universally is the importance of man­
' aging grassland ecosystems for long-term, sustainable use. While the  
concept of sustainabilityhas been widelyembraced (e.g., Goodland 1995),  
inadequate definition combined with frequent use has diluted its meaning  
substantially. Nevertheless, sustainability is a central concept in the graz­ 
ing debate and constitutes the common ground upon which any real  
, resolution of the issue is likely to be founded. Clearly, for any type of  
agriculture to persist it must be both economically and ecologically sus­ 
tainable (Crews ct al. 1991). Across much of the arid West, economics  
Table 1. Scientists, managers, landowners, and public interest groups often 
disagree on the role of science in land and resource management. Researchers 
attemptingto illuminatecontroversial issues should strive to understand the conflict 
and assess the potential contributions of new research before launching 
investigations. Our experiences suggest the following sequence of steps for 
developing research projects that address scientific issues underlying conflict. 
Steps for Turning Conflicting Claims Into Questions, and Then Into  
Testable Hypotheses:  
. , 
Study the controversy; understand the conflict.  
•  
Restate contradictory claims as questions or hypotheses. 
•  
Discuss questions/hypotheses with all parties. 
.  ' 
Get "buy-in" on research approach from the affected parties. If unsuc­
cessful, repeat previous step, or change the approach. 
•  
Design research through an open process, with opportunities for  
discussion and dialog.  
• ,  Initiate the study and guard scientific independence. 
•  
Maintain channels of communication and provide regular updates.

has tended to dictate what is achievable ecologically, rather than ecology 
dictating what is achievable economically. This has resulted in a short­
term perspective that sacrifices ecosystem sustainability for short-term 
economic viability. As ranchers struggle increasingly to stay afloat finan­
cially, it is increasingly evident that further ecological deterioration is unac­
ceptable to many. Moving to an ecological viewpoint, while remaining 
economically viable, is the challenge facing many ranchers and resource 
managers. WIllie economic analyses arc beyond the scope of this paper, 
it is important to note that ecological knowledge must be integrated with 
economic strategies if livestock grazing is La be truly sustainable. 
In this paper we focus on two important aspects of ecological 
sustainability: ecosystem productivity and biological diversity. Ecologi­
cal sustainability is concerned with the production of digestible plant 
material over the long term (decades to centuries), without significant 
external inputs, such as diverted water and fertilizers. Biological diversity 
reflects the ability of the land to support viable population of native 
species, from soil microorganisms to plants to the herbivores th~t con­
sume them. These two issues lie at the heart of the grazing debate. Does 
grazing reduce or enhance the productivity of rangelands? Is the diver­
sity of native organisms higher or lower on grazed lands? These are 'very 
different, though related questions, and the scientific approaches' for an­
swering them are also quite distinct. We are working with divers~nlan~ 
agement teams, on lands under active management, to investigate simul­
taneously these two aspects of ecosystem sustainability. 
ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO RANGELAND MANAGEMENT 
For the past 120 years, traditional cattle operations in Arizona have 
turned animals out onto large pastures for relatively long periods of time 
(Schlegel 1992). It is not unusual to see stocking densities of one animal 
per 100+ acres, with herds being moved between summer pastures ,at 
higher elevations and winter pastures in lower, desert grasslands. The 
result is relatively low grazing pressures over relatively long periods of 
time (Fig. 1). Stocking densities are manipulated in an attempt to maxi­
mize production without degrading range quality and the future ability 
of the system to produce forage. Hereafter, we will refer to this ap ~ 
proach as "traditional grazing." 
:; ' ." 
An alternative approach involves much higher stocking rates for rela­
tively short periods of time (Fig. 1). Grazing episodes are followed,by 
long periods of complete rest from the impacts of domesticated live­
stock, allowing time for the heavily impacted rangelands ro recover prior

Klopatek 1987, Belsky 1987, Belsky and Blumenthal 1997), and on the 
removal of livestock from rangelands (e.g., Bock et al. 1984, Brady et al, 
1989, Milchunas and Laucnroth 1993) fe~v studies have examined the 
'. , relative impacts of alternative strategies. This is unfortunate because the 
, '" . 
actual policy decisions made by land managers seldom involve the intro­
duction of livestock onto previously ungrazed lands, or the complete :' 
removal of livestock from current rangelands. Instead, development of 
sustainable grazing policy demands that ranchers and public lands man­
agers choose an appropriate management strategy and stocking level to:.. 
protect the integrity of the grazed ecosystem. The current project at':" : .: 
tempts to assist decision makers by providing information on grazing 
impacts on both ecosystem function and biological diversity, under alter­
native management strategies.

RESEARCH APPROACH 
Involvement with ranchers, anti-grazing activists, and management' , " 
teams has identified numerous conflicting claims regarding the ecological ," 
.' 
effects of grazing. Our first task was to turn these claims into clear ' 
questions that could be stated as testable hypotheses that are amenable to 
scientific inquiry. We include here three examples of the contradicting ,' 
claims and the approaches that we have taken in addressing them through 
field research. For illustrative purposes, we have presented direct quotes 
from two published sources that are widely cited by activists on opposite ' 
sides of the grazing controversy. 
' ' . i 
, " 
Question 1. Do rates of organic matter decomposition and related ' 
nutrient cyclingvary with grazing intensity?' , ,,) 
"In brittle environments...most dead plant material breaks 
down through slow oxidation and weathering.' Large accumu­
lations of unrecycled plant parts suppress plant growth and 
reduce uptake of those nutrients that-eventually do get below 
the soil" (Savory 1988). 
"Grazing disrupts the fundamental ecosystem functions of 
nutrient cycling and succession ....On me Colorado Plateau...a '" 
single footprint can bring a local nitrogen cycle almost to a 
halt" (Fleischner 1994). 
Approaches: 
1)  Decomposition: Undertake a 3-year grass decomposition experi- , 
rnent using litter bags and grass stems to compare rates .of de­
composition (mass loss), as well nitrogen and phosphorus release 
rates (both immobilization arid mineralization). 'Measure rates of . 
soil respiration across a gradient of grazing"intensity. 
' '. , 
.. 

2)  Nutrient availability: Over 3 years, measure the availability of im­
portant soil nutrients using buried anion and cation exchange resin 
bags, and analysis of leaf tissue nutrient concentrations and soil­
extractable nutrients. 
3)  Nitrogen fixation: Using the natural abundance of ISN, as well as 
acetylene reduction, determine whether grazed grasses suPPOrt more 
or less rhizospherc-associated nitrogen fixation than ungrazed 
grasses. 
Question 2. Do rates of water infil tration vary according to grazing 
intensity?

''Tools that break up a sealed or "capped" surface, or increase 
the soil's organic content and crumb structure, speed penetra­
tion. A loosened, rough surface or one covered by old, prone

ecosystems" (Fleischner 1994). 
Response variables and Sampling Design 
These examples illustrate an approach to research that is driven no
only by the scientific questions but also by the context of the debate ove
grazing impacts and the management of arid rangelands. We believe tha
this approach offers an opportunity for doing sound science that wil
help illuminate real land use issues. Table 2 lists me response variables tha
we are monitoring and provides a brief reference to the methods tha
we will employ. 
Our sampling design is based on the Modified-Whittaker plot,which

has been shown to capture spatial variability in grassland studies, and to 
more accurately estimate species richness (Stohlgren et al. 1995). The 
largest plot, 20m x SOm, contains subplots of differing sizes and varying 
amounts of replication (Fig. 2). The approach permits estimation of 
variance among subplots, providing a measure of spatial variability. Re­
cent studies suggest that the Modified-Whittaker approach also is effec­
tive. at detecting rare plants (Stohlgren et al. 1997) and the presence of 
exotic species. We have integrated measurements of a host of grazing 
response variables (Table 2) with the Modified-Whittaker design. 
For 
example, ion exchange bags, pitfall traps and sweep-net transects have 
been associated with vegetation subplots, permitting similar analytical 
. approaches for ecosystem variables, vegetation, and arthropod data when 
comparing the effects of different grazing treatments. In some cases, we 
employ additional plots and/or transects to increase replication and/or 
spatial independence of sample points. 
STUDY SITES 
We have begun work at three sites in Arizona to test productivity and 
biodiversity response variables (Fig. 3).

Located at 1520 m in the Sonoita Valley of SE Arizona, the vegeta­
: r . 
: ',! .' tion of the Post Canyon site is classified as Plains and Great Basin Grass­
-Iand (Brown 1994). The experimental design of the Post Canyon site 
differs from that of the Reed Lake and Ash Creek sites. At Post Canyon, 
the three land management treatments of interest converge at one point 
(Fig. 3) -
The Diamond C Ranch has been managing livestock accord­
ing to HRlvI principles since 1984; the Babocomori Ranch uses conven­
tional, low intensity livestock management practices; and the Appleton­
Whittell Audubon Research Ranch has excluded livestock from its pre­
mises since 1969. We have taken advantage of these three welles~b­
lished "treatments" by setting up Modified Whittaker plots, supplemented 
by stratified random samples on comparable land forms within 1 km of 
the convergence of the three ranches. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Environmental issues are often so polarized that there appears to be 
little room for objective scientific analysis. Yet few pressing environmen­
tal issues can be resolved without sufficient scientific understanding. The 
debate over grazing impacts and the proper use of public rangelands in 
the Southwest presents quite a "Catch 22" situation, with different inter­
ests advancing forceful arguments, each claiming that their position is 
based on sound science. Environmental scientists often find themselves 
called upon to bolster one side of the argument or the other, rather than 
doing what they are trained to do: identify important questions, design 
rigorous studies to address them, and analyze and interpret the results. If 
scientists wish to contribute to resolving real management issues, such as 
those posed by livestock grazing in the Southwest, they must understand 
(and target for research) the notions that underlie and sustain conflict, 
Developing an objective research approach that is broadly understood 
by all affected parties is a difficult task, but one that is essential tocon­
ducting relevant research that will be considered by decision makers. 
We have worked with ranchers, environmentalists, agency scientists, 
and interested citizens to identify appropriate scientific questions and d~­
sign approaches for field research. Exposure to a wide range of per­
spectives and interactions with many committed individuals have helped 
us develop a research effort that many agree is addressing key questions 
that are relevant to the future management of southwestern rangelands. 
While our geographic, taxonomic, and conceptual approaches are neces­
sarily focused on particular issues and locations, the interactive process, 
which continues as our field work progresses, provides an encouraging 
indication that the results (whatever the outcome) will be considered by 
ranchers, public officials, and involved citizens - those individuals whose 
opinions and actions will determine future grazing policy.
