When a wildfire burned the hillside 
above, this golf course acted as a fire­
line, protecting anumber of homes at 
the urban-wildland interface. But the 
homeown ers' good fortune may be 
short-lived if the smooth expanse of 
the greens and fairways becomes a

floods in the fire's aftermath.

Urban

ALocal 
Responsibility 
By Steve R. Plevel 
W
ildland fires are destroying 
more homes and threatening 
more urban areas 
in 
the 
United States every year. Much of this 
destruction happens because more 
peopl e are moving into the wildland­
urban interface. A pro blem once 
thought unique to Southern Califor­
nia is now recognized as a problem 
wherever "natural" vegetation is 
found next to the places people live 
and work. Only the frequency or ex­
tent of the problem varies with loca­
tion; the pro blem exists througho ut 
the country. 
Local government is ultimately re­
sponsible for pro tecting life and prop­
erty-for adopting policies to either 
prevent the occu rrence or reduce the 
community's vulnerability to the ef­
fects of a disaster. However, few poli­
cies specific to wildlan d-urban inter­
face fire have been adopted by local 
governmenrs. Why? What accounrs 
for the adoption ofwildland-urban in­
terface fire pol icy by loc-al govern­
ments-or its rejection?

fire in rhe wildland-urban interface. 
This intermingling of open space and 
development has occurred gradually 
and usually wirh lirtle knowledge of or 
concern for porenrial inreracrions and 
impacts. It is revealing that the 1973 
report from the National Commission 
on Fire Prevenrion and Conrrol dealt 
exclusively with structural fire, but a 
1987 followup workshop included 
wildland-urban inrerface fire as a major 
topic (FEMA 1987). 
Conrinuing encroachment into 
high-hazard areas results in more fires 
that threaten, damage, or destroy 
homes and businesses. The probabil­
ity of ignition increases, and protec­
tion is shifted from wildland resources 
to structures (National Commission 
n.d.). Although most fires within the 
wildland-urban interface are quickly 
suppressed with little or no loss of 
property or life, it does not take a 
huge fire to cause catastrophic losses 
(Davis and Marker 1987). The Octo­
ber 1991 Oakland-Berkeley Hills fire, 
for example, burned slightly more 
than 1,500 acres but killed 25 people 
and damaged or destroyed almost 
3,000 structures; total cost was esti­
mated at more than $1.5 billion 
(Oakland n.d.). Other states have also 
experienced 
disastrous 
wildland­
urban interface fires: Florida, Col­
orado, Michigan, Oregon (Ewert et al. 
1993), and most recently Texas (re­
ported in the Arizona Daily Star, Feb­
ruary 23, 1996). 
Southern California has long been 
the place where wildfires regularly de­
stroy homes. Numerous catastrophic 
fires-among them the 1959 Laurel 
Canyon fire, the 1961 BelAire fire, the 
1990 Painr fire, and the 1993 Orange 
County fires-have resulted in the loss 
of large amounts of property and 
sometimes lives. California has recog­
nized wildland-urban inrerface fire as a 
public policy problem and taken some 
steps to address it. After the 1991 Oak­
land-Berkeley Hills fire, California 
adopted the Bates Bill (California Gov­
ernment Code 
51175), which 
requires iden­
tifying 
very 
high fire hazard 
NEWYOFJ(l

case studies represented 
III every county 
and developing a model ordinance for 
use by local governmenr. 
Nationally, wildland-urban inter­
face fire has been recognized as a nat­
ural hazard and public policy problem, 
and the federal government includes 
fire in its definition of major disaster 
(Disaster Relief Act of 1974, PL 93­
288). Local governments, however, 
seem unaware of the problem except 
where, as in California, there have 
been recenr disastrous fires. Many parrs 
of the United States have not yet iden­
tified that they now have, or might 
have in the future, an interface fire 
problem. In these places development 
began in low-flammability vegetation 
but is now expanding into vegetation 
with a higher risk. 
An example is eastern Pima County, 
Arizona, which includes metropolitan 
Tucson. Settlement started in the 
saguaro-palo verde vegetation type, 
which very seldom has fires and gener­
ally does not carry fire because the 
groundcover is sparse. Urban develop­
rnent, however, has expanded into the 
chaparral and oak woodland types, 
which are fire-dependent systems that 
periodically have stand replacemenr or 
fuel-reducing fires. To date, however, 
there has never been a disastrous wild­
land-urban interface fire nor has a 
structure or life been lost in Pima 
County (Plevel 1996). 
Apathy or Action? 
To understand the lack of local ac­
tion, examples of policymaking were 
examined and compared with the liter­
ature. The literature review revealed 
that little had been written about wild­
land-urban interface policymaking, 
but some studies specifically addressed 
natural hazard policymaking. Three 
a spectrum of problem awareness and 
experience: the 1991 Oakland fire, the 
1993 Orange County fires, and East­
ern Pima County (Plevel 1996). Infor­
mation about the case studies came 
from unstructured inrerviews, meeting 
minutes, and reports. From this work a 
list ofeight factors that affect wildland­
urban interface policy consideration 
and adoption was developed. 
1.Acknowledging and understanding 
the problem. For a problem to get on 
the local policy agenda, there must be 
recognition that the problem exists­
and that it is a public policy problem 
(Petak and Atkisson 1982). When dis­
aster strikes, people expect the govern­
menr to quickly help return their lives 
to "normal" and offer assistance to re­
build and recover. They also believe 
that government should prevenr future 
occurrences 
(Petak and Atkisson 
1982). Wildland-urban inrerface fire is 
just one of the hazards that local gov­
ernmenr is expected to address. 
People who have not experienced a 
disaster, however, tend to deny that 
they may be threatened, and even 
where disaster has struck, residenrs 
tend to deny that it can recur. The case 
studies clearly show lack of acknowl­
edgmenr before a disastrous fire, plus 
lack of action even when there is a his­
tory of destructive fires (Plevel 1996). 
Denial that a fire problem exists, or 
denial of the seriousness of an ac­
knowledged problem, was cited as a 
roadblock to policymaking by people 
from all three case studies. Auf der 
Heide (1989) describes denial as the 
apathy factor. 
Even if acknowledgment and at 
least some understanding exist, Rossi 
et al. (1982) found that elected offi­
cials, like the general public, do not

needed. Several people, however, 
asked, "Will they?" The preference of 
local officials is that they set policy, 
plan, and implement while the state 
and federal governments pay the bills 
(Petak and Atkisson 1982). In fact, al­
though local officials have some au­
thority, they do not have complete au­
thority. Shannon (1991) describes the 
situation that faces most local govern­
ments: "... policy problems at the 
urban-forest interface cross boundaries 
of land ownership, overlap agency ju­
risdictions, implicate a nongeographi­
cally located polity, and thus challenge 
conventional institutions that regulate 
individual behavior and provide bene­
fits to categories of individuals." The 
paradox is that local government, 
which is least likely to see disaster man­
agement as a priority, is most likely to 
have the primary responsibility for that 
job (Auf der Heide 1989). 
4. Participation inpolicymaking. An­
derson (1984) identifies legislatures, 
the executive, administrative agencies, 
and the courts as the official policy-
makers, and interest groups, political 
parties, and individual citizens as par­
ticipants. Davis and Marker (1987) are 
mote specific about who is involved in 
wildland-urban interface fire policy, 
listing homeowners, fire protection 
agencies, local and regional planners, 
media and communication experts, in­
surance carriers, builders, contractors, 
architects, and training and motiva­
tional experts. 
Anderson (1984) points out that a 
vocal advocate who "touches a nerve" 
can prompt action, as Rachael Car­
son did with Silent Springand Ralph 
Nader did with Unsafe at Any Speed. 
This point is reinforced in the case 
studies (Plevel 1996). People inter­
viewed said that advocates were 
needed if the wildland-urban inter­
face fire problem were to be placed 
on the public policy agenda and kept 
there. As one official put it, "There 
must be a citizen outcry." Another 
person said, "There must be vocal 
citizens who keep the issue in front 
of the council." Two planning offi­
cials were looking for someone with 
"strong credentials"-an expert-to 
advocate action. Another person 
thought the expert should be non­
government. A nongovernment ad­
vocacy group was needed, according 
to still another. 
Mittler (1989) states that there is 
a small but growing body of litera­
ture indicating that only a few en­
thusiastic supporters can secure 
adoption and implementation of 
public policy. He highlights two of 
Wyler and Mann's (1983) factors as 
particularly relevant for keeping poli­
cies on the local agenda: first, that a 
small cadre of officials must lead the 
fight and, second, that the staff must 
be able and interested. He calls these 
people "issue champions." Rossi et 
al. (1982) found that people whose 
positions require it, such as planning 
and public works departments and 
elected officials, pay more attention 
to hazard mitigation. 
5. Timing: the window ofopportu­
nity. Immediately after a severe disas-
Journal of Forestry 
15 

rer there is a high level of public sup­
port for action to prevent future oc­
currence. This is aptly illustrated by 
the call by the citi zens of O range 
County for prev ention of future 
events and an increased ability to re­
spond (Plevel 1996 ). Most federal dis­
aster poli cy changes have occurred in 
the aftermath of a catastrophe (May 
and Willi ams 1986). Here is an exam­
ple of how fast the window of oppor­
tunity can close: on ly 15 to 20 per­
cent of the recommendations of the 
Oakland after Action Report (Oak­
land n.d.) have been implemented 
(Plevel 1996). However, in the rush to 
do something during th e emotional 
period right after a disaster, many im­
prudently drafted proposals may be 
advanced and even enacted int o law. 
Between disasters public interest in 
hazard-related legislati on drops, and 
thus legislative activity flags (Petak 
and Atkisson 1982). 
6. Who pays and how much. The 
cost s of disasters may be obvious or 
hidden. Obvious costs include imple­
meriting and maintaining emergency 
man agem ent activities, such as pre­
paredness, structural mitigation mea­
sures, response to the disaster, and re­
covery. Hidden costs might include the 
increased price of housing attributed to 
higher construction standards (Petak 
and Atkisson 1982). 
Who pays appears to be th e more 
important factor. Several authors 
have stated that policymakers much 
prefer distributive policies, such as 
structural miti gation and postdisaster 
recovery (Petak and Atkisson 1982; 
Rossi et al. 1982). These preferences 
shift the burden from the individual 
and the local community to th e state 
or national level, When funds can be 
obtained from othe r sources, local 
policymakers are somewhat mo re 
open to action. Such actio ns as disas­
ter relief, low-cost loans, and subsi­
dized insurance, however, encourage 
private risk taking. As Montague and 
Montague (1994) note, there is little 
incenti ve for fire protection planning 
and mitigation. Clary (1985 ) says 
that policymakers often gamble that 
a disaster will not happen rather than 
incur lon g-term preparedness cos ts, 
even if that means higher cos ts if dis­
aster does strike. 
Somewhat in contrast to these state­
ments, Clary (1985) reportS tha t nat­
ural hazard policies at all levels of gov­
ern ment are characterized by an in­
creasing emphasis on regul ation and 
other approaches to control or prevent 
hazard events. The natural hazard pol­
icy action he finds most f requently 
used by state and local government is 
regulation. 
7. Political influences. Poli tician s 
don't want to make decisions that will 
affect them whil e in office or harm 
their chance for reelection . Anderson 
( 1984) says that "po licy-making is 
'political,' it inv olves 'politics,' and 
there is no reason either ro resist or ro 
denigrate this conclusion .. ." Rossi et 
a!. (198 2) also find that at th e local

level, "...elected decision makers react 
first and foremost to the political fac­
tors extant in their community, and 
generally not to what they perceive to 
be the policy needs of the commu­
nity." The political impact on officials 
was cited by several people, including 
one elected official, as important 
(Plevel 1996) . One person described 
it as the "will to act." It appears that 
constituents' desires and the elected 
official's personal values are the pri­
mary influences. 
Anderson (I984) might have best 
summarized the political influences in 
his 
statement, 
" . . . the 
decision­
maker's values are probably the most 
direct and pervasive criteria for decid­
ing what to do." 
8. Threat ofliability and litigation. 
There was no evidence in the literature 
of governments' being sued over nat­
ural hazard disasters or mitigation ac­
tions. In support of the literature, most 
people interviewed thought that local 
government was not liable for the fire 
itself (Plevel 1996). Regardless, there 
seems to be a heightened concern by 
elected officials about liability and a 
fear of litigation-a concern that re­
quires government to appear to be 
doing everything possible to aid recov­
ery and, prevent further damage, and 
to do everything reasonable to prevent 
or mitigate future occurrences. 
Conclusions and Outlook 
People are becoming more aware of 
the wildland-urban interface fire 
problem, but they continue to deny 
its seriousness unless they have very 
recently been affected by a disastrous 
fire. Even recent victims, however, 
quickly shift their focus to other, more 
immediate issues-and given the in­
frequent and unpredictable nature of 
these disasters, other issues are bound 
to take priority. 
Over the past 10 to 15 years, some 
incremental improvement in address­
ing the interface fire problem seems to 
have occurred. For example, the Fed­
eral Emergency Management Agency 
has taken new action at the national 
level, and some states, such as Califor­
nia, have adopted more specific stan­
dards and requirements. In a time 
when people clamor for less govern­
ment intervention , however, local 
elected officials may have little inclina­
tion to do something. Besides, why act 
to prevent something you do not be­
lieve will happen again? 
If wildland-urban interface fire 
problems are to be addressed, "issue 
champions" at the local level-vocal 
and respected individuals both in­
side and outside government-will 
have to keep the wildland-urban in­
terface problem in the forefront. To 
increase their effectiveness, they may 
want to become an organized group 
and distribute educational materials. 
They need to be ready to take advan­
tage of opportunities, such as near 
misses or nearby disasters, to in­
crease awareness and understanding 
among citizens, agency officials, and 
elected officials . 
As the National Commission on 
Wildfire Disasters concluded, people 
must pay now, for preparedness and 
mitigation, or pay later, for response 
and recovery, if they want to live in the 
wildland-urban interface. mtl
