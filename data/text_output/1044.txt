The Ecological Restoration Institute 
The Ecological Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona University is a pioneer in researching, 
implementing, and monitoring ecological restoration of dry, frequent-fire forests in the Intermountain 
West. These forests have been significantly altered during the last century, with decreased ecological and 
recreational values, near-elimination of natural low-intensity fire regimes, and greatly increased risk of 
large-scale fires. The ERI is working with public agencies and other partners to restore these forests to 
a more ecologically healthy condition and trajectory—in the process helping to significantly reduce the 
threat of catastrophic wildfire and its effects on human, animal, and plant communities.

Executive Summary
Wildfires have increased in size, severity, and frequency in most western forests over the last three decades, as 
demonstrated by published literature and federal data summaries. Historically, fire was an ecological part of 
the landscape up until the late 1800s, when fire suppression became a common practice. Since 1950, 61% of 
the total area burned by wildfires occurred since the year 2000. The recent increase in fire frequency is due to 
historical fire suppression, human-caused fires, and the increase in global temperatures since 2000, where 17 
of the 18 warmest years have occurred since 2001. Fire severity changes are more complex and vary by region, 
and are increasing across many forested ecosystems. Large fires (>1,000 acres) and mega-fires (>100,000 acres) 
are becoming more prevalent, with an increasing area burning at high severity. In forests where fire exclusion 
has occurred, uncharacteristically high fuel loadings contribute to the increase in high-severity fires. Since 
2004, mega-fires began occurring on an annual basis. The average length of fire season has increased across the 
western US by 2.8 months.

This white paper summarizes the conclusions of a preponderance of the literature analyzing 
changes to wildfire season since 1950. It responds to a minority of critics that maintain changes in 
wildfire size, frequency, and severity are consistent with historical conditions.
• 
Wildfire across the western US has increased in size, frequency, and severity since the 1950s. 
These changes are closely linked with increases in temperature and an increased frequency and 
intensity of drought.
• 
Since 1985, more than 50% of the increase in the area burned by wildfire in the forests of the 
western United States has been attributed to human-caused climate change; most recently, 17 of 
the 18 warmest years have occurred globally since 2001.
• 
The annual area of wildfire burning at high severity has increased since the 1980s across much 
of the western and southwestern US, Sierra Nevada, and Southern Cascades. In the Southwest, 
large fires from 1984 to 2015 burned over 6 million acres of forests and woodlands, which equates 
to about 14% of these ecosystems (15% of this total area burned at high-severity).
• 
The average length of fire season (time from first fire start to last fire suppressed, in the calendar 
year) has increased across the western US by 2.8 months, and by 3.6 months in southwestern 
forests.  
• 
An increase in the pace and scale of forest treatments is necessary to mitigate for the increased 
wildfire activity across the West.

Wildfire Trends Across the Western US: Forest Fires Have Increased in Size, Severity, and Frequency Across Western Forests         3
Introduction
Wildfire is a natural disturbance and ecological process in forested ecosystems across the western United States. 
However, warmer temperatures, frequent droughts, and legacies of past land management are impacting western 
forests, leaving them at a higher risk for large, uncharacteristic wildfire that has dramatic impacts on ecosystems 
and nearby communities. Historical fire regimes were a mix of human and lightning-ignited fires, and no 
longer operate at the time and spatial scales they did historically. In many areas, this has resulted in an increased 
density of trees on the landscape, increased fuel availability, and less diverse understory vegetation communities 
(Allen et al. 2002).
Wildfire across the western US has increased in size, frequency, and severity since the 1950s. These changes are 
closely linked with increases in temperature and an increased frequency and intensity of drought (Peterson et al. 
2013). Historically, frequent low to moderate-severity fires dominated the fire regime in many western forests, 
maintaining low-density forests with larger trees (Allen et al. 2002). A history of fire exclusion, logging activity, 
grazing, and invasive species has led to an uncharacteristic build-up of forest fuels in many areas, increasing 
the susceptibility to large-scale, high-severity wildfire. The US has a history of fire suppression efforts that 
has exacerbated the problem by increasing the density of trees and fuel availability, and reduced the overall 
area burned by wildfires to levels that are below those that occurred before the beginning of the 20th century 
(McKelvey et al. 1996, Sugihara et al. 2006, Stephens et al. 2007).
The western US is also experiencing larger, more severe fires that are often near communities. In recent 
decades, the build-up of forest fuels, a warmer and drier climate, and expansion of the wildland-urban interface 
(WUI) into forested areas has changed western landscapes and increased wildfire hazard. Federal policy and 
management have primarily focused on fire suppression and more recently on fuels reduction on some federal 
lands. Forest restoration and fuels reduction projects have had positive ecological impacts; however, the pace and 
scale of forest treatments is not keeping up with heightened wildfire activity across the West.
Fire frequency – The number of fires for a particular location over a period of time. Fire frequency 
differs by region as a function of both lightning and human ignitions.
Fire size – Number of acres burned by a fire. 
Fire severity refers to the effects of a fire on the environment, focusing on the loss of vegetation and 
impacts on soils. 
• 
Low severity: <25 percent of overstory trees are killed, limited effects on soils
•  
Moderate severity: 25–75 percent of overstory trees killed and/or moderate effects on soils
•  
High severity: >75 percent of overstory trees killed and/or extensive mineral soil exposure

Fire Frequency
The frequency of large wildfires (>1,000 acres) and the annual area burned by wildfires in the western United 
States have both increased over the last several decades (Arno and Allison-Bunnell 2002, Stephens 2005, 
Westerling et al. 2006, Miller et al. 2009, Dennison et al. 2014, Singleton et al. 2019). Since 1950, there has 
been an increase in the average annual number of fires occurring, with 39% occurring 1950–1999 and 61% 
occurring since the year 2000 (NASA Recover; Figure 1). The more recent increase in fire frequency is likely 
linked to the increase in temperatures since 1985 (Westerling et al. 2006, Mueller et al. 2020), and 17 of the 18 
warmest years have occurred globally since 2001.
Forests across the western US have experienced a dramatic increase in the frequency of large fires since the 1970s, 
most dramatically across the forests of the Northwest (1,000%) and Northern Rocky Mountains (889%), forests 
in the Southwest (462%), Southern Rockies (274%), and Sierra Nevada (256%), in response to earlier spring 
snowmelt and a longer fire season (Westerling 2016). Over the past two decades, human ignitions account for 
11–50% of large wildfires across the interior West, but lighting-started wildfires are more common in mountainous 
regions of the western US where the largest fires occur (Balch et al. 2017, Nagy et al. 2018). Human-started fires 
are amplified in areas where climate and fuel conditions exist to promote large fires (Nagy et al. 2018).
Acres Burned and Average Fire Size
The annual number of acres burned is also increasing (Figure 2). In the last two decades, the average area burned 
has increased 1,266% in the Southwest, 331% in the Southern Rockies, 4,979% in the Northwest, 2,966% in the 
Northern Rockies, and 324% in the Sierra Nevada (Westerling 2016). Since 1985, more than 50% of the increase in 
the area burned by wildfire in the forests of the western United States has been attributed to human-caused climate 
change (Abatzoglou and Williams 2006, Mueller et al. 2020). The size of wildfires has also increased over time, with 
the largest fires occurring after 2004. Between 2004–2016 the number of annual large wildfires (>1,000 acres) and 
megafires >100,000 acres have increased over time (Figure 3). The Southern Rockies ponderosa pine landscape has 
experienced the most acres burned with more than 3 million (NASA Recover).

While this paper focuses on West-wide fire trend data, frequent-fire forests of the West historically 
experienced frequent low-severity fires that burned over large geographic areas prior to Euro-
American settlement. In other words, spatially massive fires are not necessarily a new phenomenon; 
perhaps two-thirds of southwestern forests burned in 1748 (Swetnam and Baisan 2003). However, 
the higher severity of modern fires is a new and troubling feature. Current forest conditions are 
outside the range of historical variability for these forests; the increased density of trees, less diverse 
understory, and high fuel loads contribute to the fire problem in the West, which is exacerbated by 
temperature and precipitation changes.
Climate change, specifically warming temperatures and altered precipitation, influence wildfire size and the 
flammability of forests and fuels. Fire-weather conditions also play a role where high temperatures, low relative 
humidity, high wind speed, and low precipitation can increase dryness and make vegetation easier to burn. 
Fire Severity
High-severity fire is defined when all or most of the vegetation is killed, including overstory trees, or it can 
be measured by soil burn severity. The western US has experienced an increase in the number of large fires 
with percentages of high-severity burned areas, and a larger amount of annual area burned. The annual area of 
wildfire burning at high severity has increased since the 1980s across much of the western and southwestern 
US, Sierra Nevada, and Southern Cascades (Littell et al. 2009, Miller et al. 2009, Dillon et al. 2011, Miller 
and Safford 2012, Singleton et al. 2019). Across the West, larger patches of high-severity fire have been more 
commonly observed, and are related to drought, vegetation type, and annual fire extent (Reilly et al. 2017). In 
the Southwest, increases in the area burned and area burned severely were observed since 2000 (Dillon et al. 
2011, Singleton et al. 2019, Mueller et al. 2020). An increase in the relative proportion of fire area burning at 
high severity has increased in the West, most notably in the Southern Rockies (Littell et al. 2009, Dillon et al. 
2011, Singleton et al. 2019). In southwestern forests, large fires from 1984 to 2015 burned over 6 million acres 
of forests and woodlands, which equates to about 14% of these ecosystems. At least 740,000 acres have burned 
at high severity (15% of total area burned) (Mueller et al. 2020)
Wildfire burn severity is scale dependent, and influenced by fire history, past management, accumulation of 
fuels, topography, and drier conditions. Spatial variation in burn severity reflects variation in both the intensity 
and duration of fire activity across the landscape. Across the West, topography and climate interact and 
influence fire extent and burn severity (Taylor and Skinner 2003, Dillon et al 2011). Topography affects the 
spatial distribution of fuels and local wind and weather patterns at a fine scale. The mosaic of severely burned, 
lightly burned, and unburned forest patches drives the future configuration of forest structure and succession 
(Turner et al. 1997).
Previous fires and prescribed burning can help limit the spread of fire on the same landscape. Yocom et al. 
(2019) found a pattern of previous large wildfire boundaries often aligning with a subsequent fire perimeter, 
limiting the spread of the subsequent fire. This indicates that in some cases, previous fires may act as fuel breaks 
or fuel treatments for up to five years, but their effectiveness diminishes over time. In a recent study, areas 
previously burned with low-severity prescribed fires burned at low severity again in consequent wildfire events 
(e.g., the Rim Fire in California); areas that had not burned recently or previously then burned at higher severity

during the next wildfire event. Areas that had prescribed burning applied as a management tool experienced lower 
severity fire in the previous burns and the subsequent re-burn (Harris and Taylor 2017). With fire suppression, the 
mosaic of past fires has been lost, and more of the landscape has conditions supporting high-severity fire.
Why are Wildfires Larger, More Frequent, and Severe?
Increases in the number of wildfires and area burned in most forested regions of the West are a result of dense 
forests with high fuel loads, rising temperatures, increased drought, longer fire seasons, below-average winter 
precipitation, and earlier spring snowmelt (Westerling et al. 2006, Dennison et al. 2014, Westerling 2016). Climate 
variables such as precipitation and temperature drive the regional water balance, which affects fire occurrence, 
spread, and severity through influences on fuel moisture and fuel abundance. The earlier onset of snowmelt 
increases the length of the fire season and reduces fuel moisture, which makes large portions of the landscape 
flammable for longer periods of time (Hoerling et al. 2013, Westerling et al. 2006).
Frequent-fire forests across the western US were historically highly variable with a mixture of tree densities and tree 
size classes, but were overall much more open than they are today (Knapp et al. 2013, Collins et al. 2015, Stephens 
et al. 2015, Levine et al. 2017). Historically, frequent low-severity fires dominated the fire regime in western dry 
forests, maintaining low density, more open forests with larger trees. Fire exclusion, logging activity, grazing, and 
management practices have promoted a build-up of fuels and high tree densities in many areas, increasing their 
susceptibility to large-scale, high-severity wildfire.
Discussion
Wildfire activity is predicted to increase in many forested areas across the western US over the next century, 
including an increase in fire frequency, size, and severity (Moritz et al. 2012, Yue et al. 2013, Abatzoglou and 
Williams 2016). These increases will impact many forested ecosystems and nearby communities. More than 40% 
(8.9 million acres) of the wildland-urban interface is predicted to experience moderate to large increases in the 
probability of wildfire in the next 20 years (Schoennagel et al. 2017).
Although wildfires naturally occur and play a long-term role in the health of these ecosystems, climate change will 
increase the frequency, extent, and severity of fires via increased temperatures and drought conditions predicted 
across western forests (US EPA 2019). Earlier spring snowpack melting due to rising temperatures and reduced 
winter snowpack result in decreased water availability during summer, which in turn contributes to an increased 
wildfire risk where drier and hotter conditions lead to fires starting more easily, burning hotter, and burning longer 
(Westerling et al. 2006, US EPA 2019).
The interaction of changes in climate, fire, drought, and other disturbances can transform forests and vegetation 
types. Wildfire activity is closely tied to temperature and drought over timescales of years to millennia (Westerling 
et al. 2006, Marlon et al. 2012). Forests in the Southwest show a clear trend of increasing fire severity over the last 
three decades since the mid-1980s (Littell et al. 2009, Dillon et al. 2011, Picotte et al. 2016, Singleton et al. 2019). 
The average length of fire season (time from first fire start to last fire suppressed, in the calendar year) has increased 
across the western US by 2.8 months, and by 3.6 months in southwestern forests (Westerling 2016). This is also 
linked to the spread of insects and disease, increased forest fuels, and impacts on wildlife and pollinators.

Restoration and hazardous fuels treatments reduce tree density and fuel loads, thus decreasing the risk of high-
severity fire on a site. Thinning, burning, and thinning plus burning treatments are being implemented to 
improve forest health, reduce crown fire hazard (fire that rapidly moves both on the ground surface and ignites 
treetop to treetop), and protect communities in the wildland-urban interface. These treatments increase the 
resilience of forests to uncharacteristic events so that they can recover from a disturbance such as wildfire. An 
increase in the pace and scale of forest treatments is necessary to mitigate for the increased wildfire activity 
across the West. Other potential strategies to prepare for future threats include promoting species that can 
survive fire and drought, and increasing the diversity of species and forest structure across the landscape.

About the ERI White Paper Series: Issues in Forest Restoration 
Ecological restoration is a practice that seeks to heal degraded ecosystems by reestablishing native species, 
structural characteristics, and ecological processes. The Society for Ecological Restoration International defines 
ecological restoration as “an intentional activity that initiates or accelerates the recovery of an ecosystem with 
respect to its health, integrity and sustainability… Restoration attempts to return an ecosystem to its historic 
trajectory” (Society for Ecological Restoration International 2004).
Throughout the dry forests of the western United States, most ponderosa pine forests have been degraded 
during the last 150 years. Many ponderosa pine areas are now dominated by dense thickets of small trees, and 
lack their once-diverse understory of grasses, sedges, and forbs. Forests in this condition are highly susceptible to 
damaging, stand-replacing fires and increased insect and disease epidemics. Restoration of these forests centers 
on reintroducing frequent, low-intensity surface fires—often after thinning dense stands—and reestablishing 
productive understory plant communities.
The Ecological Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona University is a pioneer in researching, implementing, 
and monitoring ecological restoration of dry, frequent-fire forests in the Intermountain West. By allowing natural 
processes, such as fire, to resume self-sustaining patterns, we hope to reestablish healthy forests that provide 
ecosystem services, wildlife habitat, and recreational opportunities.
The ERI Issues in Forest Restoration series provides overviews and policy recommendations derived from 
research and observations by the ERI and its partner organizations. While the ERI staff recognizes that every 
forest restoration is site specific, we feel that the information provided in the series may help decision-makers 
elsewhere.
This publication would not have been possible without funding from the USDA Forest Service. The views and 
conclusions contained in this document are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as representing 
the opinions or policies of the United States Government. Mention of trade names or commercial products does
