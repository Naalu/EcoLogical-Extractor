Restoration Beneﬁts of Re-Entry with Resource Objective
Wildﬁre 
A study published in Forest Ecology and Management by ERI researchers
tested whether restoration objectives in ponderosa pine forests were being met
incrementally by allowing repeated, low-severity wildﬁres to re-burn sites.
Findings showed that areas with two ﬁre entries were not noticeably different in
terms of forest structure and fuels from areas experiencing only one ﬁre.
Findings from this study suggest that managing for more moderate-severity
burning can help achieve some restoration objectives more quickly than using
repeated entries of low-severity ﬁre.
