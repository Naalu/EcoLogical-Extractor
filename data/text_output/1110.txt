Abstract.
Implementation of wildfire- and climate-adaptation strategies in seasonally dry
forests of western North America is impeded by numerous constraints and uncertainties. After
more than a century of resource and land use change, some question the need for proactive
management, particularly given novel social, ecological, and climatic conditions. To address
this question, we first provide a framework for assessing changes in landscape conditions and
fire regimes. Using this framework, we then evaluate evidence of change in contemporary con-
ditions relative to those maintained by active fire regimes, i.e., those uninterrupted by a century
or more of human-induced fire exclusion. The cumulative results of more than a century of
research document a persistent and substantial fire deficit and widespread alterations to

ecological structures and functions. These changes are not necessarily apparent at all spatial
scales or in all dimensions of fire regimes and forest and nonforest conditions. Nonetheless,
loss of the once abundant influence of low- and moderate-severity fires suggests that even the
least fire-prone ecosystems may be affected by alteration of the surrounding landscape and,
consequently, ecosystem functions. Vegetation spatial patterns in fire-excluded forested land-
scapes no longer reflect the heterogeneity maintained by interacting fires of active fire regimes.
Live and dead vegetation (surface and canopy fuels) is generally more abundant and continu-
ous than before European colonization. As a result, current conditions are more vulnerable to
the direct and indirect effects of seasonal and episodic increases in drought and fire, especially
under a rapidly warming climate. Long-term fire exclusion and contemporaneous social-
ecological influences continue to extensively modify seasonally dry forested landscapes. Man-
agement that realigns or adapts fire-excluded conditions to seasonal and episodic increases in
drought and fire can moderate ecosystem transitions as forests and human communities adapt
to changing climatic and disturbance regimes. As adaptation strategies are developed, evalu-
ated, and implemented, objective scientific evaluation of ongoing research and monitoring can
aid differentiation of warranted and unwarranted uncertainties.

INTRODUCTION
Social and ecological impacts of large and intense wild-
fires present enormous challenges to land and resource
managers of western North America (Franklin and Agee
2003, North et al. 2015, Moreira et al. 2020, Hessburg
et al. 2021). In the near term, wildfire frequency, area
burned, and area burned at high severity will likely con-
tinue to increase as the climate warms; however, despite
recent climatically driven increases in area burned, fire
deficits in seasonally dry forests remain high (reviewed by
Hessburg et al. 2021). After more than a century of fire
exclusion (Fig. 1), increased density, abundance, and con-
tinuity of live and dead vegetation interact with increased
seasonal warming and drying to drive wildfire severity
(Miller et al. 2009b, Steel et al. 2015, Parks et al. 2018,
Parks and Abatzoglou 2020). While modern wildfire
management suppresses most fire starts, those that exceed
suppression capacity account for the majority of burned
area, often during the most extreme fire weather (North
et al. 2015, Moreira et al. 2020). A paradigm shift that
recognizes wildfire and extreme fire weather as inevitable
and characteristic of seasonally dry forested ecosystems
may better foster fire- and climate-adapted forests and
human communities (Moreira et al. 2020).
Some restoration of low- and moderate-severity fire is
occurring (Parks et al. 2014, Stevens-Rumann et al.
2016, Walker et al. 2018a, Brown et al. 2019, Kane et al.
2019, Mueller et al. 2020). However, as described above,
current live and dead fuel loads and management
emphases diminish the likelihood of recapturing the
once extensive influence of low- and moderate-severity
fires. Departures from the successional patterns that
resulted from and supported active fire regimes (i.e.,
those uninterrupted by more than a century of human-
induced fire exclusion) have left many forests vulnerable
to the direct and indirect effects of seasonal and episodic
increases in drought and fire, especially under a warming
climate (Allen et al. 2002, Noss et al. 2006, Daniels
et al. 2011, Chavardes et al. 2018, Keane et al. 2018,
Stephens et al. 2018a, Bryant et al. 2019).
Fire regime changes also influence other pattern-
process interactions and ecosystem functions, including
primary productivity relations, carbon and nutrient
cycling, evapotranspiration and distributed hydrology,
and the movement and persistence of organisms (Turner
1989, Bowman et al. 2009). Thus, implementation of sci-
entifically credible adaptation strategies can
benefit
numerous social values, including quantity and quality of
water supply, stability of carbon stores, and air quality
(Stephens et al. 2020) as well as Indigenous fire steward-
ship and food security (Lake and Long 2014, Norgaard
2014, David et al. 2018, Sowerwine et al. 2019).
Proactive management informed by historical and con-
temporary forest and fire ecology can strengthen resis-
tance to disturbance and better align forest ecosystems
with rapidly changing climatic and disturbance regimes
(reviewed by Hessburg et al. 2021, Prichard et al. 2021).
Reducing the abundance and connectivity of fuels that
accumulated over more than a century of fire exclusion
can moderate ecosystem transitions and provide numer-
ous ecological and socioeconomic benefits (reviewed by
Prichard et al. 2021). Indigenous fire stewardship prac-
tices can inform active management that achieves shared
values to benefit tribes, local communities, and the
broader society when tribes contribute to leadership and
management of collaborative restoration partnerships
(Lake et al. 2018, Long and Lake 2018, Long et al. 2020).
Implementing adaptation strategies at scales sufficient
to alter contemporary disturbance regimes and recover
other ecosystem functions associated with widespread
low- and moderate-severity fires involves significantly
increasing active management of forested landscapes
(Spies et al. 2006, North et al. 2015, Stephens et al.
2016, Barros et al. 2017). Uncertainty, trade-offs, and
risks are inevitable components of both action and

or

ongoing
research, multi-party monitoring, and adaptive manage-
ment seek to address these components and build trust
in proactive management (reviewed by Hessburg et al.
2021, Prichard et al. 2021). While integral to the devel-
opment of knowledge, dissent in the scientific literature
can contribute to conflict, confusion, and lack of con-
sensus in stakeholders, e.g., environmental and conserva-
tion organizations and the general public (Maier and
Abrams 2018). When fostered by incomplete assessment
of the best available science (Esch et al. 2018), this lack
of consensus may unnecessarily delay development and
implementation of constructive new solutions and poli-
cies (reviewed by Hessburg et al. 2021).
To aid those engaged in designing, evaluating, and
implementing science-based adaptation options, we eval-
uate lingering uncertainties about the high-severity com-
ponent of historical and contemporary fire regimes (e.g.,
see Moritz et al. 2018). We first provide a framework for
objectively assessing change in the structure, composi-
tion, and fire regimes of seasonally dry, fire-excluded
forested landscapes. We then review key aspects of more
than a century of research and observations of changes
in forest conditions and fire regimes and the influence of
those changes on contemporary processes and functions.
We contrast the evidence of change with evidence sug-
gesting that management that reduces forest density to
mitigate high-severity disturbance lacks sound ecological
support. Over the past two decades, the ecological and
policy implications of these publications (e.g., Baker and
Ehle 2001, Williams and Baker 2012, DellaSala and
Hanson 2019) have garnered substantial attention and
fostered confusion about the best available science. To
aid evaluation of the relative merit of this body of
evidence
and
counter-evidence
to
contemporary
management, we also synthesize independent, peer-
reviewed evaluations of methodologies used in the
counter-evidence publications.
FRAMEWORK FOR EVALUATING CHANGE
Terms of reference
Forest types.—We focus on temperate forests of interior
western North America (Fig. 2). This biogeoclimatically
diverse region supports a wide range of forest types com-
posed of broadleaf and coniferous species. Dominant
species on the dry end of the gradient include ponderosa
and Jeffrey pine (Pinus ponderosa and P. jeffreyi) and
some oak species (Quercus spp.). As moisture increases
or fire frequency decreases, species with higher shade tol-
erance and lower drought and fire tolerance increasingly
dominate; these include Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga men-
ziesii); western larch (Larix occidentalis); sugar, western
white, and southwestern white pine (Pinus lambertiana,
P. monticola, and P. strobiformis); incense-cedar (Caloce-
drus decurrens); and grand and white fir (Abies grandis
and A. concolor). As mean annual temperatures decrease
with elevation or cold air drainage, forests are increas-
ingly dominated by lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta);
aspen (Populus tremuloides); red, silver, and subalpine fir
(Abies magnifica, A. amabilis, and A. lasiocarpa); moun-
tain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana); Engelmann spruce
(Picea engelmannii); or whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis).
Using Landfire (Rollins 2009) Biophysical Settings, we
classify these forest types as either cold, moist, or dry
(Fig. 2, Appendix S1). We exclude rainforests, coastal
forests, and Douglas-fir–western hemlock (Tsuga hetero-
phylla) forests of the Coast Ranges and the west slope of
the Cascade Mountain Range. These mesic and coastal

Across western North America, fire frequency decreased substantially following expansion of colonization by Euro-
peans, intensive livestock grazing, decimation of Indigenous populations and suppression of Indigenous burning in the late 19th
century. The combined record of fire occurrence from more than 800 forest and woodland sites, the largest network of tree-ring-
based fire-scar chronologies in the world, illustrates this regionwide decrease in fire frequency. Reprinted from Swetnam et al.

forests are typically associated with infrequent high-
severity fire; however, a growing body of research sug-
gests that low- to moderate-severity fire also likely
affected their resistance and resilience (Daniels and Gray
2006), particularly in drier portions of their range (Spies
et al. 2018b) and where Indigenous people commonly
burned the forest (Pellatt and Gedalof 2014, Hoffman
et al. 2017, 2019). Resilience is the capacity of an
ecosystem to recover its essential characteristics (includ-
ing taxonomic composition, structure, ecosystem func-
tion, and process rates) following a disturbance, whereas
resistance is the property of an ecosystem to remain
essentially unchanged when disturbed (Grimm and Wis-
sel 1997). Additionally, forest types dominated by
Douglas-fir, western hemlock, and western redcedar
(Thuja occidentalis) do occur in the interior east of the

Cascade crest, often mixed with the mesic or cold forest
species listed above.
Reference conditions.—The concept of “departure” neces-
sitates knowledge of past conditions and their variability,
often referred to as “reference conditions” or the historical
or natural “range of variation” (Morgan et al. 1994, Hess-
burg et al. 1999b, Swetnam et al. 1999, Keane et al. 2009).
Comparison of contemporary conditions with reference
conditions provides insight into the magnitude, rate, and
direction of change (Higgs et al. 2014). Timing of fire
exclusion (Fig. 1) varied widely, but commonly accompa-
nied disruption of Indigenous burning and expansion of
unregulated grazing of livestock by European settlers,
often many decades to more than a century prior to mech-
anized fire suppression, logging, and land development
(Marlon et al. 2012, Swetnam et al. 2016).
Reference baselines are commonly constrained to two
to four centuries prior to widespread colonization by
Europeans (ca. 1850). Climate and potential vegetation
patterns in this period were broadly similar to those of
the early 20th century, and data sources with high tem-
poral resolution, e.g., tree-rings and fire scars, can be
used to reconstruct environmental conditions for this
period (Morgan et al. 1994, Falk et al. 2011). Palaeoeco-
logical and archaeological evidence provide insight into
the influence of climate variation (Betancourt et al.
1990, Whitlock and Bartlein 1997, Beaty and Taylor
2009, Marlon et al. 2012, Swetnam et al. 2016, Bigio
et al. 2017) and Indigenous resource and fire use (Kaye
and Swetnam 1999, Klimaszewski-Patterson and Mens-
ing 2016, Roos et al. 2021) as drivers of change over
longer time frames. Areas with relatively intact forest
conditions or fire regimes (i.e., active fire regimes) pro-
vide insight into how historical forests and landscapes
might have operated under contemporary climate and
disturbance regimes (Stephens and Fule 2005, Collins
et al. 2009). Evaluation of landscape-level forest struc-
ture and composition with high spatial resolution, how-
ever, relies more heavily on conditions that existed in the
early to mid-20th century, the timeframe of the earliest
available aerial and oblique photos (Hessburg et al.
2000). Since no single approach addresses all relevant
scales of observation, multiple lines of independent cor-
roborating evidence are needed to quantify spatial and
temporal variation in reference conditions.
Multi-scale, multi-proxy records increase inference space
While individual methods are particularly well suited
for evaluating aspects of forest conditions and distur-
bance regimes at specific temporal and spatial scales
(Wiens et al. 2012, Morgan et al. 2014, Yocom Kent
2014), multi-proxy studies can compensate for limita-
tions in each data source (Swetnam et al. 1999, Daniels
et al. 2017). Incorporating several lines of evidence (e.g.,
multi-scale and multi-proxy studies, meta-analyses, or
simulation models) can increase confidence in results,
broaden inference space, clarify the existence and extent
of change, and provide insight into change mechanisms
(Whitlock et al. 2004, Taylor et al. 2016).
Multi-proxy, multi-scale research also reveals that,
when considered in isolation, lack of evidence of change
at any single scale of observation or in any single sam-
pled attribute may mislead interpretation of the degree
of ecosystem departures. For example, studies conducted
at plot or patch-scales may fail to capture variability of
vegetation conditions and fire severity across larger
landscapes (Marcoux et al. 2015). Thus, while change in
one or more aspect of a fire regime, e.g., percentage of
land affected by high-severity fire, may have occurred, it
may not be evident at all scales of observation. Similarly,
while the percentage of the land area affected by high-
severity fire may not have changed, spatial patterns of
high-severity fire may have (Collins et al. 2017). Reliance
on any one methodology or scale of observation is insuf-
ficient to understanding the scope of changes given the
multi-scale
complexities
of
climate–vegetation-
disturbance feedbacks and their influence on patterns
and processes (Falk et al. 2019).
Forest conditions exist at multiple spatial scales.—Spatial
patterns of vegetation reflect strong linkages between
biogeoclimatic conditions, disturbance and succession
processes, and plant physiology that vary over space and
time. Here, we consider the dominant factors operating
at three spatial scales (Fig. 3): broad (>10,000 ha), meso
(100 to 10,000 ha), and fine (<100 ha). Each scale of
observation is important to understanding vegetation
change, subsequent interactions with disturbance pro-
cesses (i.e., fire, drought, insects, and pathogens), and
potential future conditions (Keane et al. 2009, Wiens
et al. 2012, Hessburg et al. 2019). To assess whether for-
est vegetation conditions are trending away from a given
baseline, it is essential to consider changes at several spa-
tial scales and in cross-scale linkages (sensu Wu and
Loucks 1995).
At broad scales, forests exist within a patchwork of
nonforest physiognomic types, including herbland/grass-
land, shrubland, woodland or savannah, and bare
ground. Physiognomic types generally reflect the range
of temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, soil, and
geomorphic conditions to which they are best adapted.
However, overlapping disturbances occurring in rapid
succession, e.g., frequent fire, can override site potential,
leading to relatively stationary patches of nonforest on
forest-capable sites (Coppoletta et al. 2016, Prichard
et al. 2017, Coop et al. 2020, McCord et al. 2020).
At meso-scales, heterogeneous patterns of forest and
nonforest structures and compositions reflect the history
of interacting and overlapping disturbances combined
with succession and stand dynamics processes (Perry
et al. 2011, Hessburg et al. 2016, 2019) as well as biogeo-
climatic conditions, e.g., soil types (Winthers et al.
2005). The result is a mosaic of forest successional
patches that reside within the larger physiognomic

patchwork. As with physiognomic types, frequent distur-
bance can override site potential and inhibit succession
to closed-canopy forests or dominance by fire-intolerant
species (Agee 1996, 1998, Hessburg et al. 2005, North
et al. 2009, Stine et al. 2014).
At fine scales, physiological and anatomical traits of
tree, shrub, and herb species and interactions with soils
influence community structure and composition, canopy
and gap dynamics, variation in fuel load, and fire sever-
ity (North et al. 2002, Meyer et al. 2007, Reynolds et al.
2013, Strahan et al. 2016, Laughlin et al. 2017, Stevens
et al. 2020). These include traits that determine interac-
tions with fire for individual trees (e.g., bark thickness
and needle shape) and populations (e.g., reproduction
and germination strategies). Overlapping disturbances
also modify the imprint of previous events at fine spatial
scales (Hansen et al. 1991, Franklin and Van Pelt 2004).
Thus, in forests that burned frequently, variation in suc-
cessional stages typically occurred at very fine spatial
scales (<1 ha) resulting in a mosaic of individual trees,
clumps of trees, and openings, rather than patches or
stands (Franklin and Van Pelt 2004, Kaufmann et al.
2007, Larson and Churchill 2012, Churchill et al. 2013,
2017, Lydersen et al. 2013, Fry et al. 2014, Ng et al.
2020).
Fire regimes are multi-dimensional.—Multiple dimen-
sions of individual fires (Hessburg et al. 2021: Table 1)
interacting in a relatively persistent pattern over long
periods of time collectively comprise a holistic notion of
a fire regime (Agee 1996, Sugihara et al. 2018). Fire fre-
quency and severity are major drivers of ecological and
evolutionary response (Keeley 2012). However, limiting
definitions of fire regimes to the frequency and severity
that dominate a given area (e.g., frequent low-severity or
infrequent high-severity) oversimplifies ecological under-
standing of wildfire regimes, and impedes detection of
departures and projection of future conditions (Brown
et al. 2008, Collins et al. 2017). Multiple other aspects
of fire regimes (e.g., area burned, seasonality, spatial
complexity) must also be considered to understand the
natural variability of active fire regimes and evaluate
departures (Daniels et al. 2017).
Fire severity is often measured as the percentage mor-
tality of tree biomass (e.g., tree basal area or canopy
cover) after each fire event. Conventional definitions of
FIG. 3.
At broad (>10,000 ha), meso (100 to 10,000 ha), and fine (<100 ha) scales, spatial patterns of vegetation are influenced
by biogeoclimatic conditions, disturbance and succession processes, and plant physiology. Heterogeneity is evident at each spatial
scale and can influence the spread of disturbances (e.g., fire) and the movement of resources (e.g., water and sediment) as well as
species. Area shown is west of Fort Collins, Colorado, USA.

fire regimes (e.g., Agee 1996) generally reflect the cumu-
lative abundance of low- (<20%), moderate- (20–70%),
and high- (>70%) severity fire in individual fire events at
broad temporal and spatial scales. However, each of
these severity classes (as well as other commonly used
terms like mixed or variable severity), encompass a wide
range of potential ecological outcomes, i.e., the differ-
ence between outcomes at either end of the severity gra-
dient in each of these classes can be substantive.
Additionally, these severity classes do not consider spa-
tial patterns of fire severity; without them, however,
assessment of the ecological impacts of fire events is
incomplete (Miller and Quayle 2015, Collins et al. 2017,
Shive et al. 2018, Walker et al. 2019).
EVALUATING EVIDENCE OF CHANGE
The cumulative results of more than a century of
research and observation from numerous disciplines
document regional and subregional variation in histori-
cal and contemporary forest and fire ecology (Table 1).
Here, we focus on key elements from this vast body of
work to illustrate the magnitude of change in forested
landscapes. Comprehensive reviews of departures within
and among forest types and regions are available in
existing syntheses, meta-analyses, and regionwide studies
(Table 1).
We begin with a landscape evaluation of change in veg-
etation spatial patterns and fire regimes across 61 million
ha (Hann et al. 1997, 1998) that encompass the highest
concentration of cold and moist forest in the interior
western United States (Fig. 2). Landscape assessments
that evaluate a broad variety of attributes of fire regimes
and forest conditions can reduce the risk of oversimplify-
ing or misrepresenting spatiotemporal variability in fire
severity and forest conditions. The substantial departures
documented in this assessment underscore those docu-
mented in numerous other studies both within this region
and in predominantly warmer, drier ecoregions (Table 1).
We also consider changes in extent of nonforest, which
can reflect significant changes in disturbance processes
over space and time (Perry et al. 2011, Hessburg et al.
2016, 2019, Coop et al. 2020).
Next, we review evaluations of departures from
active fire regimes. As physical evidence of fire occur-
rence, fire scar records remain a primary means of
exploring historical fire ecology. Networks of fire-scar
studies emerging from the cumulative results of a cen-
tury of tree-ring studies enable insights into landscape
and climate controls on fire (Falk et al. 2011). Along
with
novel
research
designs
for
evaluating
den-
drochronological records of fire history (Farris et al.
2010, Tepley and Veblen 2015, Greene and Daniels
2017, Naficy 2017), landscape-level assessments and
simulation models encompassing multiple forest types
can address concerns that sampling bias of fire-scar
studies favors detection of low-severity fire regimes
(e.g., see arguments in Hessburg et al. 2007).
Throughout, we reference results of landscape succes-
sion and disturbance models, which provide an impor-
tant means of extrapolating geographically limited
historical data across large areas, over long time periods,
under diverse climatic conditions, and over a wide range
of fuel characteristics (Bradstock et al. 1998, Keane
et al. 2004, Barros et al. 2017). Simulation modeling
allows ecologists to integrate what is currently known to
evaluate hypotheses that enhance our collective under-
standing of fire and its distributed effects (Spies et al.
2017, Barros et al. 2018, Keane 2019). Landscape suc-
cession and disturbance models combine fire history and
biotic information about forest species as parameters
(Keane 2019, Loehman et al. 2020) to inform simula-
tions of past, present, and future landscape-wildfire
dynamics (Keane et al. 2004, He et al. 2008). Perhaps
most importantly, these models can inform and evaluate
management scenarios; they can be used to simulate
multiple future climate, management, and exotic species
scenarios that can then be compared with simulated his-
torical conditions under a consistent framework to eval-
uate risks, trade-offs, and uncertainties (Keane 2019).
Forest and nonforest conditions are significantly departed
The Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management
Project (hereafter, ICBEMP) documented widespread
forest expansion and densification between early (pri-
marily 1930s–1950s) and late (primarily 1990s) 20th cen-
tury (Hann et al. 1997, 1998, Hessburg et al. 2000,
2005). The ICBEMP encompassed the range of interior
forest
environments
distributed
across
Washington,
Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and northern California.
Using repeat photo-interpretation, standard aerial pho-
togrammetric methods, and a quantitatively representa-
tive sample (337 watersheds, mean area ˜10,000 ha), the
ICBEMP meso-scale assessment (Hessburg et al. 1999a,
2000, 2005, Hessburg and Agee 2003) evaluated change
in forest landscape patterns across the 20th century, and
the effects of those changes on fuel and fire regime con-
ditions. The results of this meso-scale assessment were
used to calibrate broadscale simulations of changes
across the entire ICBEMP area (Keane 1996, Hann
et al. 1997).
Both assessments (repeat photo-interpretation and
simulation modeling) found that high-severity distur-
bances at lower frequencies and low- and moderate-
severity disturbances at higher frequencies collectively
reduced total forested area and perpetuated relatively
widespread herbland/grassland, shrubland, woodland,
and, often, open-canopy forest, which tended to sup-
port high fire spread rates, low flame lengths, and low
fireline intensities under most fire weather conditions
(Keane 1996, Hann et al. 1997, Hessburg et al. 2016,
2019). By the late 20th century, dry, moist, and cold
forest landscapes had become more densely forested,
resulting in homogenization of previously diverse forest
and
nonforest

conditions,

vulnerability to contagious disturbances, and loss of
key habitats (Wisdom 2000, Raphael et al. 2001). These
changes were apparent despite extensive logging in the
mid to late 20th century and impacts of fire exclusion
evident by the 1930s in some areas. By the late 20th
century, the area likely to support fire regimes of low-
severity had been reduced by 53%, mixed-severity
remained roughly the same (although it shifted to sites
that supported low-severity fire regimes prior to fire
exclusion),
and
high-severity
had
nearly
doubled
(Fig. 4, Keane 1996).
In studies spanning western North America, the
extensive influence of frequent low- and moderate-
severity fires in maintaining open-canopy dry forests
and
woodlands
has
been
repeatedly
documented
(Table 1). Although not as prevalent, departures associ-
ated with the loss of low- to moderate-severity fire are
also documented in moist and cold forests. Examples
include lodgepole pine in the foothills of the Rocky
Mountains in Alberta (Amoroso et al. 2011) and in
cold-air drainages in the central Oregon Pumice Plateau
ecoregion (Heyerdahl et al. 2014, Hagmann et al. 2019);
mixed-conifer and subalpine forests in the Canadian
Cordillera (Marcoux et al. 2015, Chavardes and Daniels
2016, Rogeau et al. 2016) and southwestern United
States (Margolis and Malevich 2016, Johnson and Mar-
golis 2019); red fir forests in California’s Sierra Nevada
ecoregion (Meyer et al. 2019), and the ICBEMP study
area (Fig. 2) described above. As in the ICBEMP area
(Fig. 4), increased surface fuel loads and canopy con-
nectivity in mid-elevation forests likely influence the fre-
quency of crown fire spread into more mesic high-
elevation forests in the southwest as well (O’Connor
et al. 2014a).
Oblique and aerial imagery from the early 20th century
document abundant nonforest cover in dry, moist, and
cold forest landscapes. The William Osborne survey of
Oregon and Washington in the 1930-1940s (Fig. 5)
encompasses nearly 1,000 panoramas (120°) taken on rid-
getops and at fire lookouts, and the Geological Survey of
Canada systematically collected approximately 120,000
high-resolution oblique images from 1880 to 1950 across
the mountains of western Canada (Higgs et al. 2009; pho-
tos available online).28 As in the ICBEMP assessment,
repeat photography from other regions shows substantial
landscape change through expansion and densification of
forest and consequent reduction in open-canopy forest
and nonforest. Examples include high-elevation ecosys-
tems in the Pecos Wilderness, New Mexico (deBuys and
Allen
2015);
pine
and
mixed-conifer
forest
over
100,000 ha in northern Sierra Nevada, California (Lyder-
sen and Collins 2018); ponderosa pine in the Black Hills,
South Dakota (Grafe and Horsted 2002) and Colorado
Front Range (Fig. 6; Veblen and Lorenz 1991); and wide-
spread change across elevations in the Canadian Rocky
Mountains (Rhemtulla et al. 2011, Fortin et al. 2019,
Stockdale et al. 2019a, Trant et al. 2020).
From broad- to fine-scales (Fig. 3), the nonforest
patchwork influences landscape resilience and fire deliv-
ery to adjacent forest types. Flashy fuels, such as grami-
noids in grasslands, open-canopy forests, and sparse
woodlands, may readily spread fire to adjacent cover
types (Gartner et al. 2012, Conver et al. 2018, Prichard
et al. 2018). Moreover, flashy fuels are typically the first
to recover moisture content in the hours after sunset,
making them important to restricting the diurnal flow
of some wildfires (Simpson et al. 2016). Fine-scale tree-
less openings, highly variable in shape and abundance
(Figs. 5, 6), provided numerous functions, including
nutrient cycling and fostering biodiversity, in addition to
influencing the delivery of fire to adjacent areas (North
et al. 2005b, Larson and Churchill 2012, Churchill et al.
2017, Matonis and Binkley 2018, LeFevre et al. 2020).
Changes to spatial patterns of landscape and forest
structure (Figs. 5, 6) also influence aspects of the hydro-
logic cycle (e.g., evapotranspiration, soil water dynamics,
snow interception, snow water equivalent, and snow
melt timing), which can substantially reduce water avail-
able to downstream ecosystems (Boisrame et al. 2017b,
2019, Schneider et al. 2019, Singer et al. 2019, Ma et al.
2020, Rakhmatulina et al. 2021).
Multiple factors, including fire exclusion, have con-
tributed to a reduction of nonforest cover and expan-
sion of dry, moist, and cold closed-canopy forest since
the early 19th century (Hessburg and Agee 2003,
Chavardes et al. 2018, Eisenberg et al. 2019, Hessburg
et al. 2019, Stockdale et al. 2019a). While the depar-
tures described above may not be evident in all sam-
pled areas or at all spatial scales, the preponderance of
evidence demonstrates that the landscape surrounding
apparently unchanged ecosystems has very likely
changed even if a particular patch has not. In other
words, fuel loads and continuity may be higher than
historical levels for a landscape although not necessar-
ily for all patches in that landscape.
Fire regimes are significantly departed
One of the key findings to emerge from nearly every
tree-ring reconstruction of fire history is a widespread
reduction in fire frequency in the 20th century (Fig. 1)
compared to preceding centuries (Falk et al. 2011, Mar-
lon et al. 2012, Swetnam et al. 2016, Coogan et al.
2020). Paired tree-ring and sedimentary charcoal-based
fire histories from the same locations show 20th-century
decreases in fire occurrence that are unprecedented in
recent millennia (Allen et al. 2008, Beaty and Taylor
2009, Swetnam et al. 2009).
Frequent fire reduces the intensities and severities of
subsequent fires by maintaining tree densities and live
and dead fuel loads at levels below those that local site
productivity could readily support (Reynolds et al. 2013,
Stine et al. 2014, Safford and Stevens 2017, Addington

et al. 2018, Battaglia et al. 2018). Overlapping fires lim-
ited the spread of crown fire and other contagious pro-
cesses (e.g., insect outbreaks and disease epidemics,
Hessburg et al. 1994, 1999b) by reinforcing discontinuities
in canopy cover, species composition, tree size and age
classes, and surface fuel abundance (Roccaforte et al.
2008, Collins et al. 2009, Fule et al. 2012a, van Wagten-
donk et al. 2018b). Absence of frequent fire provides

on more productive sites (Merschel et al. 2014, Johnston

accumulate; and water available for forest growth decli-
nes (Wallin et al. 1996, Wimberly and Kennedy 2008,
Diggins et al. 2010). These conditions can foster large
and intense fires with effects that are not often observed
in simulated historical ranges (Hann et al. 1997, Keane
et al. 2009, 2018, Holsinger et al. 2014, Loehman et al.
2017, Haugo et al. 2019, Stockdale et al. 2019b). Corre-
spondingly, forest succession and disturbance modeling
projects lighter fuel loads and fewer high-intensity fires
when departures from active fire regimes are low (King
et al. 2008, Riggs et al. 2015).
Stands
and
landscapes with
relatively
intact
or
restored fire regimes (i.e., active fire regimes) provide
insight into how historical forests and landscapes oper-
ate
under
contemporary
climate
and
disturbance
regimes (Cortes Monta~no et al. 2012, Yocom Kent et al.
2017, Arizpe et al. 2021, Dewar et al. 2021, Murphy
et al. 2021; and sources in Prichard et al. 2021: Table 2).
Contemporary forests with relatively intact fire regimes
experienced the climate variations of the 19th and 20th
centuries, but do not exhibit changes in structure and
composition comparable to fire-excluded forests (Ste-
phens and Fule 2005, Lydersen and North 2012, Paw-
likowski et al. 2019). Similarly, forests with relatively
intact fire regimes have not experienced the increased
severity of disturbance events observed on comparable
areas affected by fire exclusion (Rivera-Huerta et al.
2016, Murphy et al. 2021).
Broader impacts of fire regime departures
Modern wildfire suppression extinguishes essentially
all fire starts except those that overwhelm fire suppres-
sion capacity and can only be extinguished when aided
by a significant change in the weather (North et al.
2015, Moreira et al. 2020). Despite increasing suppres-
sion efforts, both area burned and area severely burned
have increased as temperatures and widespread drought
accelerated near the end of the 20th century (Westerling
et al. 2006, Abatzoglou and Williams 2016, Parks and
Abatzoglou 2020). Nonetheless, burned area in most
forested ecosystems is still much lower than would be
expected based on fire–climate relationships (Stephens
et al. 2007, Fule et al. 2012b, Marlon et al. 2012, Mallek
et al. 2013, Parks et al. 2015, Taylor et al. 2016).
Contemporary fires burn in landscapes with greater
forest density and connectivity, surface fuel accumulation,
and proportion of small trees relative to larger, more fire-
resistant trees, all of which contribute to more severe fires
(Graham et al. 1999, 2004, Jain and Graham 2007). An
eight-fold increase in annual area burned at high-severity
occurred between 1985 and 2017 in western U.S. forests
(Parks and Abatzoglou 2020), and fuels (i.e., live and
dead vegetation) have been implicated as the primary dri-
ver of stand-replacing fire in most regions of the western
United States (Steel et al. 2015, Parks et al. 2018).
Departures from forest structures and compositions
maintained by active fire regimes also contributed to
uncharacteristically high levels and patterns of mortality
during recent severe droughts (Bentz et al. 2010, Fettig
et al. 2013, 2019, Stephens et al. 2018a). During those
same droughts, however, stands with lower live basal area
or density experienced lower tree mortality rates than
stands with higher basal area or density for a given mois-
ture regime, especially on drier sites (Rivera-Huerta et al.
2016, Young et al. 2017, Restaino et al. 2019).
High-severity fire is an essential component of many
forested landscapes, not only through the provision of
unique snag and complex early seral habitats (Swanson
et al. 2011), but also through its influence on numerous
other ecosystem functions, including nutrient and hydro-
logical cycles and the rate and abundance of debris flow
and sediment deposition (Bisson et al. 2003). However,
constraints imposed on the relative abundance and patch
sizes of high-severity fire by active fire regimes in dry,
moist, and cold forests are also critical to maintaining
the diverse and unique ecosystem characteristics of sea-
sonally dry forested landscapes (Fig. 4, Table 1). Given
widespread reductions in nonforest in the 20th century,
some conversion of forest to nonforest area may aid
recovery of ecosystem functions associated with active
fire regimes, as seen where wildland fire was restored
after nearly a century of fire exclusion (Boisrame et al.
2017a). Additionally, some cover type conversions are
inevitable as landscapes adjust to a warming climate,
perhaps particularly in southwestern North America
(Falk 2013, Loehman et al. 2018, Field et al. 2020).
Studies of contemporary fires demonstrate, however,
that high-severity fire is overrepresented in forests histor-
ically characterized by frequent low- to moderate-
severity fire regimes (Table 2). Increased frequency of
high-severity fire in these forest types is a concern for
many reasons, including the likelihood that areas burned
at high severity often reburn at high severity (Thompson
et al. 2007, Lydersen et al. 2017, Prichard et al. 2017,
Collins et al. 2018, Coop et al. 2020, Povak et al. 2020)
even after a century of fire exclusion and forest succes-
sion (Taylor et al. 2020). Spatial patterns of high-
severity fire in these forests are also a key departure of
contemporary fire regimes (Hessburg et al. 1999a, 2015,
2019, Fule et al. 2014, Reilly et al. 2017, Stevens et al.
2017). Even in forest types historically dominated by
infrequent high-severity fire, fire severity patterns have
likely changed given the suppression of most fire starts
and absence of fires spreading in from adjacent forest
and nonforest (Fig. 4; Perry et al. 2011, O’Connor et al.
2014, Johnson and Margolis 2019).
In landscapes historically dominated by frequent low-
and moderate-severity fires, increases in high-severity
fire are further reducing the abundance of large and old
fire- and drought-tolerant trees (Table 2). These once
prevalent trees, are currently rare and “endangered”
(Stephens et al. 2016, Miller and Safford 2017, Reilly
et al. 2018). Large and old fire- and drought-tolerant
trees were heavily logged in the 20th century (Hessburg
and Agee 2003, Brown and Cook 2006, Naficy et al.

2010), and populations have continued to decline due to
direct and indirect effects of drought stress, bark beetle
outbreaks, and wildfire (Bentz et al. 2010, Fettig et al.
2013, 2019, McIntyre et al. 2015, Lydersen et al. 2017,
Stephens et al. 2018a, Restaino et al. 2019, van Mant-
gem et al. 2020). Bark beetle outbreaks, accentuated by
high forest density that exacerbates drought stress and
facilitates infestation, continue to reduce average tree
size and age in ponderosa and Jeffrey pine forests as
bark beetles preferentially target larger individuals (Fet-
tig et al. 2019, cf. Hood et al. 2020).
Recent trends in high-severity fire effects may con-
tribute to further departures and present impediments to
forest regeneration due to limitations on seed dispersal
capacity and altered site conditions (Stevens-Rumann
et al. 2018, Davis et al. 2019, Stevens-Rumann and
Morgan 2019), particularly in the case of short interval
reburns (Stephens et al. 2018a, Coop et al. 2020). Con-
straints on tree regeneration may be an inevitable conse-
quence of a warming climate. Note, however, that
regeneration in semiarid forest–steppe ecotones exhib-
ited resilience to recent low-severity fires but not high-
severity fires (Harris and Taylor 2020). Additionally,
recent work shows that the biogeochemical impacts of
high-severity fires are much longer-lasting than previ-
ously assumed, leading to concern that increased high-
severity burning will negatively impact soil organic car-
bon and nutrient cycling (Dove et al. 2020).

EVALUATING EVIDENCE OF LACK OF CHANGE
In this section, we review publications that suggest the
preponderance of evidence misrepresents or overgeneral-
izes departures from active fire regimes. These publica-
tions then suggest that management actions aimed at
recapturing the influence of abundant low- and moderate-
severity fire lacks a sound ecological foundation. Over the
past two decades, independent research groups have eval-
uated the methods and inferences proposed by these pub-
lications and documented multiple weaknesses. Despite
demonstrated methodological biases and errors, new
papers employing those methods, or results and conclu-
sions derived from them, continue to pass peer review. To
aid evaluation of this body of counter-evidence, we apply
the same framework used above to evaluate evidence of
change in forest conditions and fire regimes. We also syn-
thesize peer-reviewed evaluations of the methods used in
counter-evidence publications.
Misrepresented historical forest conditions
Publications based on novel methods for estimating
historical forest density (Williams and Baker 2011) from
early land surveys conducted by the General Land
Office (GLO) have suggested that densities and fire
severities of dry forests were higher and more variable
than previously thought (Table 3). As described below,
limitations of both GLO data and the methods used
undermine this conclusion. Additionally, as Fule et al.
(2014) observed, existing research documented even
greater heterogeneity in historical forest conditions,
including higher densities, than was reconstructed from
GLO data. Conflating high-frequency, low-severity fire
regimes with homogeneity misrepresents the heterogene-
ity of those systems and disregards critical ecosystem
functions associated with fine-scale spatial patterns in
uneven-aged, predominantly open-canopy forests domi-
nated by mature and old trees (Table 1).
Valid methods exist for deriving density estimates
from spatial point patterns, such as GLO bearing trees
(Cogbill et al. 2018). However, the extremely low sam-
pling density of this national land survey limits reliable
estimates to the average forest density for a large area.
The typical spacing of 0.8 km between GLO survey
points and a maximum of two or four trees per point
yields a sample of, at most, eight trees per 260 ha.
Levine et al. (2017) documented roughly 50% accuracy
given a minimum of 50 GLO survey points (roughly
3,000 ha). Hanberry et al. (2011) documented accuracy
of 10% given GLO survey points in 10–20 townships
(90,000–180,000 ha) depending on the number of bear-
ing trees per point.
Thus, even when using independently validated meth-
ods, estimates of average density at such coarse spatial
scales mask substantial heterogeneity in forest conditions
at fine- and meso-scales. These records cover essentially
all of the western United States, however, and can provide
valuable insights into landscape change at coarse scales.
For example, Knight et al. (2020) reconstructed average
tree density for the floristically diverse Klamath Moun-
tains at township (roughly 9,320 ha) resolution and docu-
mented substantial departures from historical conditions,
including forest densification and loss of oak woodlands.
Williams and Baker (2011) proposed a method for
estimating average tree density for three and six pooled
GLO survey points (roughly 260 and 520 ha, respec-
tively). However, due to the lack of a correction factor
that accounts for the number of trees used to estimate
density at individual sampling points, methods devel-
oped by Williams and Baker (2011) overestimated tree
densities by 24–667% for contemporary stands with
known densities (Levine et al. 2017, 2019). Levine et al.
(2017, 2019) enabled independent evaluation of their
methods and data by archiving all GLO estimator code
and data on publicly accessible websites; data and code
supporting Williams and Baker (2011) are not similarly
accessible (Stephens et al. 2021). Independently vali-
dated methods for estimating tree density from point
data were shown to yield estimates that were less biased
(Levine et al. 2017) as well as more consistent with tree-
ring reconstructions and less than half as large (John-
ston et al. 2018) as those produced using Williams and
Baker (2011) methods.
Density estimates based on Williams and Baker (2011)
methods are also inconsistent with tree-ring reconstruc-
tions and early 20th-century timber inventory records
for areas where the data overlap (Tables 3–5). Counter-
evidence publications have suggested that tree-ring
reconstructions might overrepresent the historical influ-
ence of low- to moderate-severity fire (Table 4) and that
early timber inventories (which systematically sampled
10–20% of the area of relatively large landscapes) are
biased, inaccurate records of historical tree densities
(Table 3). Like all data sets, dendroecological recon-
structions and early timber inventories have limitations.
However, as described below and in Tables 3–5, indepen-
dent research groups have tested methodological con-
cerns about underrepresentation of high-severity fire
effects and the capacity of early timber inventories to
represent early 20th century forest conditions and shown
them to be unfounded. Dendrochronological reconstruc-
tions and early timber inventories demonstrate consis-
tency with each other and with other independent data
sources (Scholl and Taylor 2010, Stephens et al. 2015,
Hagmann et al. 2017, 2019).
When comparing study results, accounting for ecologi-
cally relevant differences in site conditions or methodolo-
gies is essential. However, counter-evidence publications
consistently
do
not
account
for
these
differences
(Tables 3–6). One of many such comparisons involves a
study of ponderosa pine on two 1-ha plots each of which
was intentionally selected because it contained >75 trees
per hectare >250 yr old (Morrow 1985). Baker and Han-
son (2017) compared average tree density in these two
selectively sampled hectares (Morrow 1985) with average

tree density for >50,000 ha of mixed-conifer forest from a
systematic sample of 20% of the area in an early timber
inventory (Hagmann et al. 2014). Williams and Baker
(2011) and Baker and Williams (2018) also compared
average tree density in these two selectively sampled hec-
tares (Morrow 1985) with average density estimated for
520 ha from GLO land survey data. Average tree density
in two selectively sampled 1-ha plots cannot credibly be
assumed to represent average densities for the substan-
tially larger areas in these comparisons, particularly given
abundant documentation of fine- and meso-scale varia-
tion in historical forest and landscape structure (Table 1).
The low sampling density and, hence, low spatial reso-
lution of GLO land survey data precludes analysis of the
spatial patterns that influence disturbance severity or
response to disturbance in forests and forested land-
scapes. Validated methods for deriving estimates of aver-
age tree density from GLO data may support conclusions
about changes in average tree density or composition at
broad spatial scales (e.g., Knight et al. 2020). However,
objective conclusions about lack of change in forest con-
ditions and fire regimes require additional lines of evi-
dence. Multi-scale analysis of forest conditions and fire
regimes (including spatial patterns in tree clumps, canopy
gaps, forest successional types, physiognomic types, and
stand-replacing fire) is essential to avoid misleading inter-
pretations of the degree of ecosystem departures.
Misrepresented fire regimes
Counter-evidence publications have also posited that
the high-severity component of contemporary wildfires
is consistent with historical fire regimes based on the
suggestions that high-severity fire was common histori-
cally (Tables 4 and 5) and modern wildfire severity is
overestimated
(Table 6).

compromised
by
methodological
errors
leading
to
underestimation of historical fire frequency, overestima-
tion of historical fire severity, and underestimation of
contemporary fire severity, as described in this section.
Additionally, without consideration of all dimensions of
a fire regime, one cannot objectively conclude that eco-
logically relevant departures have not occurred. For
example, while fire regimes may not differ in one dimen-
sion (e.g., abundance of high-severity fire), they may dif-
fer in other dimensions (e.g., size or complexity of
patches of high-severity fire). Similarly, while the domi-
nant fire severity class (e.g., moderate) may not have
changed for a given area, median percent mortality may
have (e.g., a shift from 30% to 70%).
Underestimated historical fire frequency.—Dendroeco-
logical methods for reconstructing spatial point patterns
of fire history have well-documented strengths and limi-
tations (Stokes and Dieterich 1980, Baisan and Swetnam
1990, Falk et al. 2011, Daniels et al. 2017). Fire scars
record low-severity (non-lethal) fire at a specific place
and time; however, absence of a scar on nearby trees
may indicate either that the area did not burn or that it
burned without scarring (i.e., absence of evidence is not
evidence of absence; Fig. 7c). A common approach to
overcoming this uncertainty is to composite fire scar
dates from multiple trees. As more trees are sampled, the
probability of detecting additional fires increases and
eventually plateaus (Falk and Swetnam 2003). As trees
are sampled across larger landscapes, the composite
mean fire interval (CMFI) may be reduced as more fire-
scar dates are found, especially in forests that historically
experienced numerous relatively small fires (Collins and
Stephens 2007). To avoid overestimating fire return
intervals based on point sampling, researchers recom-
mend (1) limiting compositing of fire dates to relatively
small areas where fuel and topographic conditions would
likely have resulted in generally uniform burning condi-
tions; (2) collecting numerous samples to saturate the list
of fire dates, reporting the point fire interval, and
demonstrating a sampling plateau (Falk and Swetnam
2003, Van Horne and Fule 2006); (3) using minimum

Unrecorded fires (fire did not scar the tree) may
contribute to underestimation, not overestimation, of
fire frequency and extent in frequent fire systems.
Probability of scarring decreased when intervals
between successive fires were short in areas burned by
up to four late 20th-century fires. Absence of scar
does not indicate absence of fire.

scarred trees biased MFI estimates. Targeted
sampling reconstructed fire parameters comparable

from independent 20th-century fire atlases.

sample depths to account for periods when fire records
may be missing; and (4) proportional filtering of fire
dates to distinguish smaller from larger fires (Swetnam
and Baisan 1996).
The efficacy of these methods has been repeatedly
demonstrated, often through direct testing of criticisms
raised in counter-evidence publications (Table 4). For
example, to evaluate Baker and Ehle (2001) assertions
that targeted sampling of high fire scar densities biases
MFI, Van Horne and Fule (2006) compared targeted,
random, and grid-based sampling of fire-scarred trees to
a census of all fire-scarred trees (n = 1,479) in a 1-km2
area. Given a minimum sample size of 50 trees (3%), all
methods accurately reproduced the mean fire interval of
the census of all fire-scarred trees. Farris et al. (2013)
also found a high degree of accuracy across multiple
sampling regimes. Similarly, Farris et al. (2010) tested
Baker and Ehle (2001) assertions that fire-scar histories
overestimated fire frequency by giving undue importance
to small fires. First, Farris et al. (2010) demonstrated
that spatially distributed fire-scar samples accurately
reconstructed the existing spatial and temporal record of
mapped fire events >100 ha that occurred from 1937 to
2000. Contrary to Baker and Ehle (2001) assertions, Far-
ris et al. (2010) found that fires <100 ha were more com-
mon in the record of mapped fire events than suggested
by
dendrochronological
reconstruction.
Fire-scar
records for hundreds of studies across western North
America are archived on publicly accessible databases
(Falk et al. 2011), which enables independent evaluation
of methods and inferences. Fire-scar data supporting
counter-evidence publications (Tables 4 and 5) are not
similarly accessible.
Compositing of fire-scar records has proven to be a
reliable, repeatable, and robust method (Heyerdahl et al.
2001, Fule et al. 2003, Taylor and Skinner 2003, Van
Horne and Fule 2006, Hessl et al. 2007, Farris et al.
2010, 2013, O’Connor et al. 2014a). However, counter-
evidence publications present and support the use of
alternative methods that are problematic to calculate and
biased (Table 4). For example, Kou and Baker (2006a)
proposed an “all-tree fire interval” (ATFI) metric that
includes a “scarring fraction” (SF, estimated fraction of
unscarred trees) to derive a “population mean fire
interval” (PMFI). Few studies have tried to estimate SF
(Kou and Baker 2006a); thus, few estimates of ATFI are
available (Baker 2017). Additionally, as acknowledged by
Kou and Baker (2006a: Accessory Publication), ATFI
will always be much longer than any MFI, even for non-
composited MFIs based on individual trees.
ATFI and SF are inaccurate indicators of historical
fire occurrence. ATFI and SF depend on the false
assumption that absence of scarring indicates absence of
fire (Table 4). Reconstructing SF for each fire in a his-
torical record is not feasible given that scarring can vary
considerably with variations in weather and live and
dead fuels between and within individual fires (Fig. 7a).
Studies that have estimated SF (cited in Baker 2017)
used data from recent fires that burned after a century
or more of fire exclusion (Fig. 1) and are, therefore, not
representative of historical fuel or fire behavior condi-
tions. Additionally, ATFI inflates mean fire intervals by
equating tree age with the period of fire regime analysis,
thereby including origin-to-first-scar and time-since-
last-fire intervals (Table 4, Fig. 7b). Abundant evidence
indicates that origin-to-first-scar intervals are not reli-
able indicators of fire-free intervals and should be omit-
ted from calculations of MFI (Table 4). Similarly, time-
since-last-fire intervals that overlap more than a century
of fire exclusion (Fig. 1) are not credible representations
of fire frequency in active fire regimes (Figs. 1, 7).
Overestimated historical fire severity.—The indicators of
high-severity fire events used in counter-evidence publi-
cations (e.g., average stand age, abundance of small trees,
and presence of shrub fields) are ambiguous given ample
viable alternative explanations for those conditions, as
described below and in Table 5. High tree regeneration
densities do not necessarily indicate prior fire events, a
concept well-documented by the densification that has
occurred in the absence of fire during the long 19th- to
21st-century period of fire exclusion (Hessburg and Agee
2003, Fule et al. 2014, Merschel et al. 2014, O’Connor
et al. 2017). Nonetheless, publications from Shinneman
and Baker (1997) to those based on Williams and Baker
(2011) use this metric to infer high-severity fire extent
(Table 5). Climatic drivers of regeneration are often dis-
associated with disturbance events (Brown and Wu

Substantial errors of method and interpretation invalidate
inferences about the historical extent of high-severity fire.
Inferences were based on (1) inappropriate assumptions
about the size and abundance of small trees given the
ambiguity of data describing small trees in the 1911
inventory, (2) averaging of values derived from different
areas and vegetation classifications, and (3) inappropriate
assumption that the presence of chaparral (common on
sites with thin soils and high solar radiation) indicates
high-severity fire.

Moreover, widespread livestock grazing promoted abun-
dant regeneration by exposing mineral soil, reducing
competition from grasses and herbs for resources (Rum-
mell 1951, McKelvey and Johnston 1992, Hessburg and
Agee 2003), and reducing fire spread by disrupting fuel
continuity (Savage and Swetnam 1990, Belsky 1992, Bel-
sky and Blumenthal 1997, Swetnam et al. 2016). Simi-
larly, while shrub fields may be a legacy of type
conversion after high-severity forest fires, other factors
also maintained shrubs and constrained forest develop-
ment, including frequent fire (Knapp et al. 2013, Guiter-
man et al. 2018), Indigenous resource management
(Marks-Block et al. 2021), and biophysical conditions,
e.g., thin soils and high solar radiation (Stephens et al.
2015). Thus, multi-proxy evidence and meta-analyses are
often needed to reconstruct site history and more credi-
bly evaluate changes to forest conditions.
Other methodological errors also contribute to overes-
timation of historical fire severity in counter-evidence
publications (Table 5). As described above, inferences
based on historical tree densities estimated from GLO
land survey data using Williams and Baker (2011) meth-
ods warrant reconsideration given methodological errors
documented by multiple independent research groups
(Table 3). Further, estimates of high-severity fire extent
in Hessburg et al. (2007) do not validate estimates based
on Williams and Baker (2011) methods because they are
not comparable (Spies et al. 2018b: 132–137), despite
assertions to the contrary (Table 5). Estimates of area
burned at high-severity using Williams and Baker (2011)
methods are derived from inferred tree mortality while
estimates derived from early aerial imagery (Hessburg
et al. 2007) reflect mortality of the dominant cover type
whether it be tree, shrub, or grass. Similarly, the use of
average stand-age in contemporary Forest Inventory and
Analysis (FIA) data by Odion et al. (2014) compromises
inferences about the historical extent of high-severity fire
due to the failure of this metric to account for the pres-
ence of older trees in the plot and the fact that tree age is
not a reliable indicator of high-severity fire (Stevens
et al. 2016).
Underestimated contemporary fire severity.—Estimates
of contemporary fire severity in counter-evidence publi-
cations are compromised by non-standard definitions of
high-severity fire and the capacity of the data to produce
credible estimates of high-severity fire (Table 6). Odion
and Hanson (2006) used data sets not designed to mea-
sure tree mortality (e.g., Burned Area Emergency
Response data sets, BAER), which precludes ecologi-
cally meaningful comparisons with studies that classify
fire severity as percentage of tree basal area or canopy
cover killed (Safford et al. 2008). Hanson et al. (2009)
used a higher severity threshold than recommended in
the literature cited in support of their methods (Miller
et al. 2009a), which yielded lower estimates of area
burned by high-severity fire and weakened inferences
based on comparisons with studies using the regionally
calibrated threshold (Spies et al. 2010). Hanson and
Odion (2014) suggested that previous assessments had

lation were those with minimum sample depth of five trees because of possible missing fire-scar records with fewer trees (i.e., the
period between 1501 and 1580). Middle panel shows point mean fire intervals (point MFI) using scar-to-scar intervals recorded on
all trees (27 total intervals). Bottom panel shows point MFI including origin-to-first scar (O-S) intervals on individual trees (45
total intervals). Including time-since-last fire intervals would further increase Point MFI. (c) An example of an unscarred tree of

the effects of prolonged fire exclusion on contemporary
fire regimes and forest conditions. Given that evidence
of change may not be apparent at all spatial scales or in
all aspects of forest conditions and fire regimes, the con-
clusion that pattern-process interactions in fire-excluded
forested landscapes have not departed from those char-
acterizing active fire regimes requires strong evidence
from multi-scale, multi-dimensional, multi-proxy evalua-
tions. As demonstrated in the multiple independent
assessments reviewed here (Tables 3–6), inferences sup-
ported by these counter-evidence publications are weak-
ened by multiple methodological errors and warrant
critical reevaluation. We conclude that these counter-
evidence publications do not meet minimum standards
for “best available science” to inform land and resource
management on public lands (Esch et al. 2018).
CONCLUSIONS AND MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS
Based on the strength of evidence, there can be little
doubt that the long-term deficit of abundant low- to
moderate-severity fire has contributed to modification
of seasonally dry forested landscapes across western
North America. The magnitude of change in fire regimes
and the resultant increases in forest density and fuel con-
nectivity have increased the vulnerability of many con-
temporary forests to seasonal and episodic increases in
drought and fire, exacerbated by rapid climate warming.
While some ecosystems within these landscapes have
been less directly altered by fire exclusion, they may be
indirectly affected by alteration of the surrounding land-
scape and consequent changes to ecosystem processes,
including disturbance and hydrological regimes. These
substantial departures as well as on-going wildfire exclu-
sion threaten numerous social and ecological values,
including quantity and quality of water supply, stability
of carbon stores, and air quality (Stephens et al. 2020),
as well as culturally important resources and food secu-
rity (Norgaard 2014, Sowerwine et al. 2019).
Long-term fire exclusion leads to the loss of informa-
tional (species life history traits) and material (biotic
and abiotic structures such as seeds and nutrients)
legacies (Johnstone et al. 2016) that may compromise
fire-dependent diversity and the capacity of forested
ecosystems to resist or recover after wildfires, especially
under climate change (Franklin et al. 2000, Reilly et al.
2019, Krawchuk et al. 2020). Among these legacies are
mature and old trees, in particular, open-canopy forests
of mature and old conifers and hardwoods, which pro-
vide unique ecosystem functions and which were once
substantially more prevalent (Spies et al. 2006, Kolb
et al. 2007, Long et al. 2015, Franklin et al. 2018, Long
et al. 2018, Hanberry and Dumroese 2020). As climate
continues to warm and burned area increases, early seral
habitat will likely be created in abundance. However,
recapturing the once extensive influence of the low- and
moderate-severity fires that shaped and maintained
these ecosystems for millennia requires a paradigm shift
from strategies favoring fire suppression to those favor-
ing fire-adapted forests and communities (reviewed by
Hessburg et al. 2021, Prichard et al. 2021).
Perpetuating
invalidated
methods
and
inferences
based on them fosters confusion and controversy, which
undermine scientific credibility and impede the develop-
ment of relevant and timely policy and management
options. For example, counter-evidence reviewed here
was used to support contentious conclusions in a meta-
analysis of the impacts of high-severity fire on California
Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis occidentalis; Lee 2018).
The authors of many of the studies included in that
meta-analysis subsequently demonstrated methodologi-
cal weaknesses in the meta-analysis that undermine
those conclusions (Jones et al. 2020a). Unwarranted
uncertainty about the use of high-severity burn areas by
California Spotted Owls (Jones et al. 2019, Peery et al.
2019) has detrimentally impacted the management of
this sensitive species (Stephens et al. 2019, Jones et al.
2020b). Objective scientific evaluation can aid in differ-
entiating warranted from unwarranted uncertainties and
enable timely paradigm shifts to policies and manage-
ment actions that favor fire- and climate-adapted forests
and human communities.
