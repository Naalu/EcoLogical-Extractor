Forest Patterns Following Wildland Fires Managed for Resource Benefit  
Differ from Reference Landscapes 
 
By Andrew Sánchez Meador and David Huffman 
Introduction 
When a wildfire ignites from natural causes such as lightning, forest managers may opt to allow the fire, 
or parts of it, to burn and manage the fire to accomplish various resource objectives, including ecological 
restoration. This practice of managing wildfires for resource objectives (hereafter, managed wildfire) may 
provide a suitable alternative or complement to mechanical forest restoration treatments. Measuring the 
effectiveness of managed fire has been limited by a lack of landscape-scale reference metrics and studies 
that compare fire outcomes to desired conditions. In this study, we compared and contrasted landscape 
patterns at different spatial extents, across both managed wildfire landscapes and functioning or restored 
ponderosa pine landscapes (hereafter, reference landscapes) in northern Arizona.  
 
To test the effectiveness of wildfires for restoring landscape patterns, we used Sentinel-2 satellite imagery 
to classify ponderosa pine forest canopy cover and then compared derived landscape metrics between 
wildfires and reference landscapes across a range of spatial extents. Reference landscapes included sites 
with minimal signs of anthropogenic fire exclusion (intact) and mechanically restored forests. These were 
compared to 16, predominately single-entry, managed wildfire sites. Restored forests were included in the 
reference group after they were found to be statistically similar in landscape patterns with the intact 
landscapes. We quantified the importance of a set of landscape metrics (Table 1) for distinguishing 
between managed wildfire and reference landscapes and explored management implications of the 
differences observed.  
 
Findings (see Table 2, page 3) 
• 
Single-entry managed wildfire patterns differed significantly from those of reference landscapes for 
nearly all metrics analyzed, and the two landscape types became increasingly different with 
increasing spatial extent (37–2,075 acres). 
• 
Managed wildfire patterns exhibited greater canopy cover, larger patch size, lower patch density, and 
more divergent shape complexity compared with reference landscapes. 
• 
Proportion of the landscape (% canopy cover), mean patch area, and normalized landscape shape 
index were the most informative metrics for separating managed wildfire and reference landscapes at 
extents smaller than 600 acres (Table 2, blue text). 
• 
Patch area and division index were the most informative for assessing comparisons at larger (up to 
2,075 acres) extents (Table 2, blue text). 
• 
Shape metrics were consistently less important across all scales, while edge density was the least 
important metric at extents greater than 600 acres. 
• 
Of the wildfires examined, only one had greater than 10% of its area classified as moderate burn 
severity, and only two of the wildfires studied had more than 1% of total area classified as high burn 
severity. The vast majority of areas experienced unburned/low or low burn severity conditions.

Conclusions 
This study is unique in that the reference landscapes provide a set of reference conditions for forest spatial 
patterns that may have dominated the frequent-fire pine landscapes prior to fire exclusion. Our findings 
indicated that wildfires managed to improve resource conditions were significantly different from 
reference landscapes in terms of several ecologically important landscape metrics. These predominately 
single-entry, low-severity wildfires maintained the original high tree densities and large contiguous 
canopies of today’s forests. Managed fires did little to restore patterns more typical of ecologically intact 
and restored forests. These findings align with other studies that report greater restoration effectiveness in 
areas where wildfire has burned with more moderate severity. More work is needed to help managers 
identify where, when, and how often wildfires may be managed to meet restoration objectives at 
landscape scales.
