aBstract
Recent reviews have brought into ques-
tion the effectiveness of post-fire seed-
ing in mitigating soil erosion and non-
native plant invasions, yet millions of 
dollars continue to be spent annually 
on post-fire seeding as a primary post-
fire rehabilitation response.  Overall 
policy development and implementa-
tion direction regarding post-fire reha-
bilitation treatments rests heavily on 
national- and regional-level natural re-
source managers.  We conducted per-
sonal interviews and telephone surveys 
with the population of national- and re-
gional-level natural resource managers 
(N = 6 and N = 17, respectively) in-
volved directly in post-fire seeding ac-
tivities on federally managed lands. 
We found that 71 % of the respondents 
felt that information on the long-term 
effects of seeding was not sufficient. 
Respondents’ perception about the ef-
fectiveness of seeding in curtailing 
spread of non-native species was 
mixed: 64 % felt seeding was very or 
somewhat effective and 36 % felt it was 
not effective at all.  Additional moni-
toring and research is needed that uti-
lizes cost-benefit analyses for areas 
where values at risk are high.  These 
analyses include whether or not to seed,

majority of information available on 
seeding comes from short-term studies 
(≤2 years).  Testimonies and recent re-
views demonstrate the need for review 
and refinement of current policy that in-
cludes stronger mandates and adequate 
funding for dedicated staff to conduct 
long-term monitoring spanning 5 years 
to 10 years.  Land managers and scien-
tists agree that there is a need for data 
on the long-term effectiveness of seed-
ing treatments as well as further inquiry 
regarding effectiveness of seeding in 
mitigating non-native species invasions. 
Stronger communication and collabora-

introdUction
The fire seasons of 2011 and 2012 in the 
United States were among the largest in United 
States history since 1960 (NIFC 2014).  Fol-
lowing these extreme fire events, land manag-
ers were tasked with making critical decisions 
about rehabilitation.  Climate-driven increases 
in large wildfire activity and longer wildfire 
seasons in the western United States (Wester-
ling et al. 2006, Littell et al. 2009) has brought 
values at risk and subsequent rehabilitation 
needs to the forefront of not only land manag-
ers, but also fire management policy-makers.  
Land management agencies in the United 
States, such as US Department of Agriculture 
Forest Service (USFS) and US Department of 
the Interior Bureau of Land Management 
(BLM), commonly prescribe seeding as an 
emergency watershed-rehabilitation measure 
to minimize threats of increased erosion and 
non-native species invasion, which often result 
from severe wildfire (Richards et al. 1998, Ro-
bichaud et al. 2000).  This rationale has led to 
post-fire seeding being one of the most widely 
used post-fire rehabilitation activities and one 
of the largest categories of Burned Area Emer-
gency Response (BAER) expenditures (Robi-
chaud et al. 2000, Peppin et al. 2011).

Since 2000, several reviews have brought 
into question the effectiveness and effects of 
post-fire seeding treatments (Robichaud et al. 
2000, Beyers 2004, Peppin et al. 2010, Peppin 
et al. 2011 ).  The reviews suggest that: 1) 
seeding has a low probability of success dur-
ing the first and second critical erosion years 
after fire (Robichaud et al. 2000); 2) success-
ful grass establishment displaces native plant 
regeneration (Robichaud et al. 2000, Beyers 
2004, Peppin et al. 2010); 3) seeded plots rare-
ly reduce erosion compared to unseeded plots 
(Peppin et al. 2010); and 4) seeding has limit-
ed effectiveness in curtailing non-native spe-
cies invasions (Peppin et al. 2010).  Thus, the 
disconnect between the continued use of seed-
ing as a post-fire rehabilitation measure and 
scientific evidence regarding its effectiveness 
is of concern.  
Overall policy development and imple-
mentation direction regarding post-fire reha-
bilitation treatments rests heavily on national- 
and regional-level natural resource managers.  
Decisions and implementation direction made 
at these levels critically affect post-fire reha-
bilitation measures prescribed at the local lev-
el.  As post-fire seeding continues as a primary 
tool to mitigate erosion and non-native plant 
invasion, it is important to understand percep-
tions of higher-level natural resource managers 
regarding the use of post-fire seeding treat-
ments.  To better understand current decisions 
on post-fire seeding and effectiveness in miti-
gating post-fire erosion and non-native inva-
sions, we administered in-person interviews 
and telephone surveys with national- and re-
gional-level managers.  Results from these in-
terviews and surveys are compared and con-
trasted with findings from recent reviews on 
post-fire seeding to determine gaps and incon-
sistencies in knowledge, practices, monitoring, 
and policy.  Identifying and understanding 
these inconsistencies will assist in pinpointing 
areas in post-fire management that require fur-
ther research and monitoring and may help en-
hance the efficiency and success of future post-
fire rehabilitation.
metHods
We conducted in-person interviews with a 
small group of fire management specialists 
(hereafter “key informants”) who were espe-
cially knowledgeable about post-fire seeding 
activities on federally managed lands at the na-
tional level.  Results from these exploratory 
interviews assisted in the development of a 
more structured study of regional resource 
managers.  
We administered a telephone survey to a 
larger group of regional resource managers 
and specialists with expertise in post-fire seed-
ing activities in forested ecosystems within 
federally managed lands across the western 
United States (hereafter “regional specialists”).  
We defined forested ecosystems as those domi-
nated by coniferous or deciduous trees occur-
ring at elevations above grasslands, pinyon-ju-
niper woodlands, or chaparral vegetation in the 
western United States (Peppin et al. 2010). 
Regional specialists responded based on their 
own experience and did not provide an official 
position of a particular agency.  
Key Informant Interviews
Through preliminary discussions with ex-
perts in the field and online searches, we iden-
tified key informant interviewees who were 
national-level natural resource managers di-
rectly involved in post-fire emergency re-
sponse activities.  We used key informant in-
terviews to better understand current post-fire 
seeding policies, objectives, and other post-fire 
seeding treatment issues.  
We conducted six key informant interviews 
with US Department of the Interior (USDI) na-
tional-level managers involved with Emergen-
cy Stabilization and Burn Area Recovery 
(ES&BAR) activities working for the BLM, 
Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Fish and Wild-
life Service (FWS), and the National Park Ser-
vice (NPS).  Due to a position vacancy at the 
time of the interviews, we administered a sur-
vey to the current Acting USFS National

phone interviews.
Telephone Survey with Regional Specialists
Based on contact information gathered 
from key informants, we established an ex-
haustive list of regional specialists (N = 29). 
The population contained regional specialists 
involved specifically in post-fire rehabilitation 
activities working for the USFS, BIA, BLM, 
FWS, and NPS.
To increase response rates, we sent a pre-
notification e-mail to all potential respon-
dents one week before the survey period.  We 
screened potential respondents first to verify 
that their organization was involved in post-
fire seeding in forested ecosystems and omit-
ted those participants who did not qualify 
(10).  After screening, the final survey popu-
lation consisted of 19 potential respondents.  
Of the 19 identified regional specialists who 
remained, we completed 17 telephone sur-
veys (89 % response rate [percentage of qual-
ified or eligible respondents completing the 
survey]).  Five respondents worked for the 
USFS and the remaining participants worked 
at various USDI agencies (Table 1).  
Based on information gained from key in-
formants, we developed a more focused set of 
survey questions administered to the larger 
group of regional specialists (30 seeding treat-
ment and 7 demographic questions).  Survey 
questions consisted of a variety of formats in-
cluding closed-ended, multiple response, and 
open-ended questions.  We designed contin-
gency questions (subsequent questions asked 
contingent on a particular response to the first 
question in a series) to further clarify answers 
given in a preceding closed-ended question. 
We designed all survey questions to allow for 
grouping and ranking results.  To validate the 
survey instrument, we pre-tested the survey 
and revised the content and format according-
ly.  We grouped seeding treatment questions 
into six categories: 1) evaluation and determi-
nation of the need for post-fire seeding; 2) 
implementation of post-fire seeding treat-
ments; 3) post-fire seeding success and effec-
tiveness; 4) monitoring of post-fire seeding 
treatments; 5) post-fire seeding treatment in-
formation availability and exchange; and 6) 
post-fire seeding policy.  
The average length of time to complete the 
survey ranged from 25 to 30 minutes.  Each in-
terview began with an introduction that 1) iden-
tified the interviewer; 2) explained the project 
and the purpose of the survey; 3) explained 
how the results would be used; and 4) guaran-
teed respondent confidentiality and anonymity.  
We summarized telephone survey respons-
es by calculating answer frequencies (the num-
ber following each percentage) and valid per-
centages (“Don’t know” or “Refused” respons-
es omitted).  Answer frequencies represent the 
total number of responses to an individual re-
sponse category for a question.  We calculated 
valid percentages by dividing the number for 
each response category by the total number of 
responses for that question.  Total number of 
responses to a question may be greater or less 
than that of the total number of respondents 
due to multiple response questions and pro-
grammed skips within the survey.

Need for Post-Fire Seeding
According to regional specialists, deciding 
to seed is most dependent on the values at risk, 
fire severity, and threat of non-native species. 
A majority (88 %, 14) of regional specialists 
reported natural regeneration as very effective 
(38 %, 6) or somewhat effective (50 %, 8) in 
achieving plant cover and reducing erosion (16 
total responses; Figure 1).  
Implementation of Post-Fire Seeding
Regional specialists stated that aerial seed-
ing is the most commonly used method to seed 
(60 %, 12) (20 total responses; Figure 2). 
When asked which method is most effective 
(three total responses), hand seeding and drill-
ing were deemed superior (67 %, 2 and 33 %, 
1, respectively).  
Over half (52 %, 11) of the regional spe-
cialists reported mulching as the treatment 
used most often in conjunction with post-fire 
seeding (21 total responses).  Mulching was 
also selected as one of the most effective meth-
ods used with seeding out of seven total re-
sponses (43 %, 3).
Out of 37 total responses, most regional 
specialists selected either natives (41 %, 15) or 
annual cereal grains (non-native agricultural 
species cultivated for the edible components of 
their seeds, such as wheat, barley, oats, or ce-
real rye; 22 %, 8) as the species typically seed-
ed.  At the same time, when asked what per-
centage of native and annual cereal grains is 
typically used in seed mixes, responses reflect-
ed a large range (10 % to 100 % and 5 % to 
80%, respectively).  Although native species 
cultivars (a cultivated variety of a native spe-
cies that has been deliberately selected for spe-
cific desirable characteristics), non-native spe-
cies, and sterile annual cereal grains (non-re-
productive annual grasses) were used less, the 
range used in the seed mixes was much small-
er (5 % to 25 %).
Post-Fire Seeding Success and Effectiveness
Over half (57 %, 8) of the resource special-
ists reported post-fire seeding as somewhat ef-
fective in mitigating non-native species inva-
sions, whereas more than one in three (36 %,
5) stated it is not very effective (14 total re-
sponses; Figure 3).  Regional specialists who 
answered “somewhat effective” explained their 
response further by stating that effectiveness 
of seeding to mitigate non-native species inva-
sion depends on the proximity of non-native 
species populations to the rehabilitation site 
and the competitive abilities of the non-native 
species present.  For those who answered that 
mitigating non-native species invasions was 
not very effective, elaboration of these re-

sponses included, “recent research results 
shows this,” “strong competitive abilities of 
non-natives,” and “the application method is 
unsuccessful.”  
Out of 17 total responses, regional special-
ists identified precipitation (47 %, 8) and cli-
mate (24 %, 4) as the main factors affecting 
seeding success.  Out of 15 total responses, re-
spondents reported that post-fire seeding treat-
ments mitigate soil erosion in less than one 
year (33 %, 5) or in one to two years (47 %, 7). 
Post-Fire Seeding Policy and Monitoring of 
Post-Fire Seeding Treatments
Out of 16 total responses, more than half 
(56 %, 9) of the regional specialists reported 
that monitoring was either always (31 %, 5) or 
often (25 %, 4) completed, whereas almost the 
same number of respondents (44 %, 7) said it 
was sometimes (31 %, 5) or hardly ever (13 %, 
2) achieved.  Those saying “hardly ever” ex-
plained that competing priorities, plus lack of 
time and dedicated staff, deters implementing 
a monitoring program.  This issue also reso-
nated among key informants who stated that 
lack of sufficient funding and personnel are 
major limitations in monitoring post-fire seed-
ing treatments.  Regional specialists further 
suggested that regular monitoring of the effec-
tiveness of post-fire seeding treatments would 
improve if a funded monitoring plan supported 
dedicated staff.  
Out of 16 total responses, the majority of 
regional specialists (81 %, 13) agreed that in-
formation available to evaluate short-term ben-
efits of post-fire seeding treatment is somewhat 
sufficient; however, more than two in three 
(71 %, 12) said availability of information to 
evaluate long-term benefits is not very (59 %, 
10) or not at all (12 %, 2) sufficient (17 total 
responses; Figure 4).  Comments revealed that 
increased monitoring to address long-term ef-
fects of seeding on native plant communities 
and seeding effectiveness in preventing non-
native species invasion is needed to assist land 
managers in making relevant post-fire seeding 
decisions.  Out of 16 total responses, most re-
gional specialists (63 %, 10) identified either 5 
years (38 %, 6) or 5 to 10 years (25 %, 4) as the 
ideal length of time to monitor a majority of 
post-fire seeding projects, while 19 % (3) stat-
ed that 3 years of monitoring, the current 
length of time funding is available to monitor 
treatments after fire, was adequate.

in mitigating post-fire erosion and non-native 
invasions.
Regional specialists’ decisions to seed 
based on values at risk, fire severity, and threat 
of non-native invasion is in line with current 
seeding policy (USDI and USDA 2006).  Re-
gional specialists commented that allowing the 
land to naturally regenerate may be just as ef-
fective as seeding for meeting rehabilitation 
objectives related to soil erosion.  Similarly, 
Peppin et al. (2010) found that over three-
quarters of the studies reviewed that evaluated 
seeded versus unseeded controls revealed that 
seeding was no more effective than the con-
trols in reducing erosion.  Given these find-
ings, it is surprising that land management 
agencies continue to seed rather than allow 
these areas to naturally regenerate.  These re-
sults imply that initial seeding assessments 
should be carefully considered and supported 
by evaluation of past practices, recent research 
findings, seeding success within the region, 
and land managers’ primary rehabilitation 
goals.
Implementation techniques for seeding can 
have a significant impact on its effectiveness.  
Regional specialists and the literature agree 
that aerial seeding is one of the most common-
ly used methods to seed after fire (Robichaud 
et al. 2000, Peppin et al. 2010).  Robichaud et 
al. (2000) found cost per unit area for aerial 
seeding considerably less than other rehabilita-
tion treatments, which may be the cause for the 
high use of this practice.  However, several 
studies note that aerial seeding effectiveness is 
highly variable (Barclay et al. 2004, Hunter et 
al. 2006, Wagenbrenner et al. 2006).  In agree-
ment with regional specialists, Monsen et al.
(2004) also identified hand seeding and drill-
ing as the most effective application tech-
niques.  Unfortunately, seeding by hand is both 
time and labor intensive and drill seeding is 
prohibited on steep slopes commonly found in 
forested ecosystems; for these reasons, neither 
are practical methods for treating large expans-
es of forested land.  Several post-fire treatment 
decision tools have been made available to 
land managers in recent years.  These tools 
make it possible to determine the most appro-
priate treatment methods including that of 
seeding, especially in areas where values at 
risk are high.  Cost-benefit analysis for which 
spreadsheets currently exist is a valuable tool 
for calculating post-fire treatment and cost ef-
fectiveness to values at risk (Calkin et al. 2007, 
Robichaud and Ashmun 2013).  Additional 
post-fire decision tools available include post-
fire burn severity mapping and predictive mod-
eling (Robichaud and Ashmun 2013).  Erosion 
Risk Management Tool (ERMiT) has been de-
veloped specifically for post-fire assessments 
and is used to estimate the probability of hill-
slope treatment success for seeding, erosion 
barriers, and dry agricultural straw mulch (Ro-
bichaud et al. 2007).  Regional specialists and 
the literature agree that mulching in conjunc-
tion with seeding is a more effective rehabili-
tation treatment.  Studies reviewed by Peppin 
et al . (2010) noted that seeding for erosion 
control is more effective when implemented in 
concert with other treatments such as log ero-
sion barriers, mulch, or biosolids (Meyer et al. 
2001, Earles et al. 2005, DeWolfe et al. 2008). 
In recent years, the use of agricultural straw, 
hydromulch, and wood shred or wood strand 
mulches as post-fire treatments has increased 
(Robichaud et al. 2013a).  Agricultural mulch 
has been established as an effective post-fire 
treatment while wood shred has been found to 
be similarly effective in reducing erosion (Ro-
bichaud et al. 2013b).  However, the high cost 
of mulch limits its application to small, high-
value areas (Robichaud et al. 2009).  In addi-
tion, some mulch materials, such as agricultur-
al straw, can be sources of undesirable weed 
seed (Kruse et al. 2004), exacerbating the in-
vasion of non-native species.  Thus, barriers to 
applying mulch, including high costs and po-
tential introducing weeds, indicate the need for 
further long-term research on the effectiveness 
of mulching.  Research would be further sup-
ported by utilizing cost-benefit analyses to ul-

timately assess the value of its application, es-
pecially when values at risk are high.  
Cost for seeding materials appears to play a 
role in selecting species for seed mixes used to 
rehabilitate burned areas.  Survey results cor-
roborate outcomes reported in Peppin et al.
(2011) that confirm an increasing trend of na-
tive species and non-native annual cereal grains 
use, with native species being seeded most. 
Although native and annual cereal grains are 
used more frequently, the large range used in 
seed mixes could reflect limited use due to high 
costs and inadequate supply (Beyers 2004, 
Peppin et al. 2011).  Compounding these fac-
tors is a lack of research on these species’ ef-
fectiveness and effects on plant communities 
over time (Beyers 2004, Peppin et al. 2011). 
Although determining a way to increase stock 
levels to reduce their cost may make for more 
consistent usage of these species, increased re-
search on the effectiveness of native and annual 
cereal grains and their long-term effects on 
plant communities is imperative as their incor-
poration into seed mixes continues.
At present, it is unclear whether post-fire 
seeding treatments are successful in meeting 
rehabilitation objectives related to mitigation 
of non-native species invasions.  Studies eval-
uating seeding treatment effectiveness in re-
ducing non-native invasions revealed variable 
results, similar to perceptions of regional spe-
cialists, with almost an equal proportion of 
studies reporting seeding treatments are either 
effective (54 %, 6) or ineffective (45 %, 5) 
(Peppin et al. 2010).  Studies that were suc-
cessful in excluding non-natives resulted from 
seeding treatments that yielded high ground 
cover (Barclay et al. 2004, Keeley 2004).  In-
effective treatments were often those that 
showed no difference in total ground cover on 
seeded versus unseeded sites (Sexton 1998, 
Hunter and Omi 2006, Stella et al. 2010). 
Based on survey results and recent review 
findings, seeding may be more successful at 
curtailing non-native invasions when seeded 
cover is high enough to crowd out non-natives.  
These diverging results, implicit in both the 
literature and from regional specialists, imply 
the need for further monitoring and research to 
fully understand post-fire seeding effects on 
non-native invasions.
Overall seeding success appears to be 
strongly driven by weather conditions within 
the treatment area.  According to regional spe-
cialists and corroborated with recent research 
(Peppin et al. 2010), effective reduction of ero-
sion within the first and second critical post-
fire year is largely dependent on amount and 
timing of precipitation events.  Peppin et al.
(2010) further suggest that seeding treatments 
may be a more successful rehabilitation activi-
ty in Mediterranean and marine regimes (Cali-
fornia and Pacific Northwest), which are less 
vulnerable to the high-intensity, short-duration 
rainfall events occurring shortly after severe 
wildfires as seen in temperate steppe regimes 
(Intermountain West and Rocky Mountains).  
A main goal of post-fire stabilization treat-
ments is to reduce soil erosion in the year im-
mediately following a fire (Robichaud et al. 
2000).  Regional specialists’ responses confirm 
that seeding treatments mitigate soil erosion 
within this timeframe.  In contrast, recent re-
view results indicate that seeding has a small 
probability of success in reducing erosion dur-
ing the first two years after a fire event (Peppin 
et al. 2010, Robichaud et al. 2000).  Peppin et 
al. (2010) found that evidence for seeding ef-
fectiveness drops substantially as study designs 
become more rigorous.  For example, of the 
papers reviewed with the highest quality of ev-
idence (articles containing data from replicated 
and randomized experiments and published in 
peer-reviewed journals), seeding appeared to 
be ineffective in reducing erosion.  Agency 
publications and monitoring reports reviewed 
typically fell into the lower quality of evidence 
categories and often suggested seeding as an 
effective treatment measure to reduce erosion. 
Discrepancies among regional specialists’ opin-
ions and literature results regarding soil erosion 
may reflect differences in data collection meth-
odologies among agencies and researchers.  
Considering these contradictions, it would be

beneficial for agencies to complete quantita-
tive, controlled, replicated long-term monitor-
ing to adequately assess seeding treatment ef-
fectiveness for soil erosion.  
Among agencies, current monitoring poli-
cy and inadequate funding is a major factor 
limiting proper assessment of post-fire seeding 
effectiveness.  Although the goals of post-fire 
watershed-rehabilitation for USDA and USDI 
agencies are similar, these agencies have 
slightly different policies regarding emergency 
stabilization and rehabilitation activities.  US 
Department of Interior ES&BAR differs slight-
ly from the USDA USFS BAER program in 
that ES&BAR policy places a stronger empha-
sis on longer-term rehabilitation and restora-
tion objectives (up to 3 years) while providing 
funding to meet those objectives (USDI 2004, 
2006). 
Seeding treatment performance and effects 
are strongly related to length of time post-fire 
(P. Robichaud and W. Elliot, USDA Forest 
Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, 
unpublished paper; Rough 2007).  Currently, 
monitoring completed by land managers and 
researchers alike is rarely carried out for long 
enough to determine overall effects and effec-
tiveness of seeding treatments; although, re-
search has begun to expand to include long-
term effects of treatments (Robichaud and 
Ashmun 2013).  Studies rarely yield data be-
yond two years (Peppin et al. 2010).  Peppin et 
al. (2010) stressed the need and importance of 
longer-term monitoring results, specifically 
those greater than five years, to assess effec-
tiveness and impacts of seeded species.  This 
strongly correlates with regional specialists’ 
views that long-term monitoring, ranging from 
5 to 10 years, will ultimately reveal results that 
will close the gap in the inconsistencies be-
tween managers’ perceptions and research.  In 
considering regional specialists’ testimonies 
that short-term monitoring, which is currently 
required and funded, isn’t always accom-
plished, fulfilling the need for longer-term 
monitoring may prove difficult.  If longer-term 
monitoring is a priority of the post-fire man-
agement program, as research and resource 
specialists suggest it should be, stronger man-
dates are necessary for monitoring implemen-
tation that includes funding to support dedicat-
ed staff beyond three years. 
In general, most indicators of seeding ef-
fectiveness in the literature reviews correlated 
with the regional specialists’ findings.  How-
ever, both the literature and regional special-
ists’ responses suggest that results are variable 
for whether seed mixes used in post-fire seed-
ing treatments are successful in meeting reha-
bilitation objectives related to mitigation of 
non-native species invasions.  In addition, sur-
vey results varied from the literature in seed-
ing effectiveness in mitigating soil erosion 
within the first year.  These findings clearly in-
dicate that additional monitoring and research, 
including cost-benefit analyses for areas where 
values at risk are high, are needed to adequate-
ly assess decisions to seed, seeding implemen-
tation methods and alternatives, seed composi-
tion, effects on non-native species invasions, 
and seeding effectiveness for soil erosion. 
These findings also suggest that current policy 
should be reviewed to incorporate stronger 
mandates for longer-term monitoring (beyond 
three years).
Understanding how current research com-
pares to land managers’ perspectives denotes 
the importance of continued interaction be-
tween researchers and land managers.  There 
is agreement among land managers and recent 
scientific reviews that there is insufficient in-
formation on long-term seeding treatment ef-
fectiveness and uncertainty about the effective-
ness of seeding mitigating non-native species 
invasions.  Adequate funding for both research 
and on-the-ground monitoring is necessary to 
explore the longer-term effectiveness and ef-
fects of post-fire treatments.  Stronger commu-
nication and collaboration between these two 
groups would allow researchers to develop 
well-replicated monitoring designs for areas 
that land managers consider to be high priority 
for intensive, quantitative, long-term research 
of post-fire treatments.
