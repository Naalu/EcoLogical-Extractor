Abstract
Disturbances and propagule pressure are
key mechanisms in plant community resistance to
invasion, as well as persistence of invasions. Few
studies, however, have experimentally tested the
interaction of these two mechanisms. We initiated a
study in a southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus
ponderosa Laws.)/bunch grass system to determine
the susceptibility of remnant native plant communi-
ties to cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) invasion, and
persistence of cheatgrass in invaded areas. We used a
2 9 2 factorial design consisting of two levels of
aboveground biomass removal and two levels of
reciprocal seeding. We seeded cheatgrass seeds in
native plots and a native seed mixture in cheatgrass
plots. Two biomass removal disturbances and sowing
seeds over 3 years did not reverse cheatgrass dom-
inance in invaded plots or native grass dominance in
non-invaded native plots. Our results suggest that
two factors dictated the persistence of the resident
communities. First, bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus
elymoides (Raf.) Swezey) was the dominant native
herbaceous species on the study site. This species is
typically a poor competitor with cheatgrass as a
seedling, but is a strong competitor when mature.
Second, differences in pretreatment levels of plant-
available soil nitrogen and phosphorus may have
favored the dominant species in each community.
Annual species typically require higher levels of
plant-available soil nutrients than perennial plants.
This trend was observed in the annual cheatgrass
community and perennial native community. Our
study shows that established plants and soil properties
can buffer the inﬂuences of disturbance and elevated
propagule pressure on cheatgrass invasion.

Introduction
Plant invasions can be triggered by the interac-
tion of different mechanisms including disturbance,
increased propagule pressure, climate, resource avail-
ability, and plant functional traits (Elton 1958; Hobbs
and Huenneke 1992; Lonsdale 1999; Mack et al.
2000). While disturbances and/or propagule pressure
are often considered principal drivers of invasion

(Von Holle and Simberloff 2005; Lambrinos 2006;
Eschtruth and Battles 2009), some native plant
communities remain resistant to nonnative plant
encroachment. Ecologists have proposed that inva-
sions are driven by ﬂuctuations in resource availabil-
ity that cause temporal and/or spatial variations in
niche availability regardless of the resource-liberating
mechanism (Stohlgren et al. 1999; Davis et al. 2000).
Thus, successful invasions require synchrony of
resource availability and presence of a nonnative
species capable of exploiting the resource (Tilman
2004). Furthermore, propagules of the nonnative
species must be present in sufﬁcient quantity to
capture resources to the detriment of the native
community.
Empirical experimental studies of community
invasibility in natural ecosystems are rare and results
are often inconsistent. Beckstead and Augspurger
(2004) demonstrated that competition with native
perennial grasses and a lack of soil disturbance were
important for resistance to cheatgrass (Bromus tecto-
rum L.) invasion in a Great Basin ecosystem, while
high nitrogen availability was the main factor in
sustaining cheatgrass dominance. Thomsen et al.
(2006), however, found that reduced competition
with established species had little inﬂuence on
perennial grass invasion in a California coastal
prairie. Instead, timing of precipitation and propagule
pressure were most important in overcoming invasion
resistance. Chambers et al. (2007) determined that the
most inﬂuential factors driving invasion in Great
Basin sagebrush communities varied depending on
elevation, but sites with the highest cover of perennial
grasses had the greatest resistance to invasion,
regardless of elevation.
Cheatgrass is an annual grass from the Mediter-
ranean Region that has invaded large expanses of the
western United States and is considered a strong
transformer species (sensu Richardson et al. 2000).
Cheatgrass typically invades semi-arid grass- and
shrublands where it often becomes the dominant
species (Mack 1981; Knapp 1996). Cheatgrass out-
competes many native perennial grass seedlings, but
performs worse when competing with mature native
plants (Booth et al. 2003a; Lowe et al. 2003;
Humphrey and Schupp 2004). Furthermore, cheat-
grass success is promoted by high soil nutrient levels,
particularly nitrate, which often increases in the soil
immediately after ﬁre (Link et al. 1995; Lowe et al.
2003; Beckstead and Augspurger 2004; Gundale
et al. 2008).
Cheatgrass is considered to be poorly adapted to
coniferous forests. Cheatgrass growth and fecundity
are limited by shade (Pierson et al. 1990). Low air
and soil temperatures cause reduced emergence and
survivorship (Pierson and Mack 1990b). Addition-
ally, disturbance to the extant understory is often
necessary for cheatgrass establishment (Pierson and
Mack 1990a). Recently, however, cheatgrass has
become increasingly prevalent in ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa Laws.) forests of the American
West (Crawford et al. 2001; Keeley and McGinnis
2007; Laughlin and Fule´ 2008; McGlone et al.
2009b). This prevalence is associated with recent
increases in ﬁre and anthropogenic disturbance in
ponderosa pine forests (Gildar et al. 2004; Keeley
2006; Fowler et al. 2008). In 2002–2003, a ponderosa
pine forest ecological restoration project in the
Uinkaret Mountains of northern Arizona became
heavily invaded by cheatgrass immediately following
a severe drought and wet autumn and winter (McG-
lone et al. 2009a). Cheatgrass populations expanded
from being a minor component of the vegetation to
becoming the dominant understory species over much
of the landscape. The invasion was, however, heter-
ogeneously distributed with many remnant areas of
intact
native
vegetation containing
little or
no
cheatgrass.
In 2004 we initiated an experiment in the Uinkaret
Mountains to determine the susceptibility of native-
dominated communities to nonnative plant invasion,
the persistence of recently established dominant
nonnative populations, and the role of disturbance
and elevated propagule pressure in shifting community
dominance. We promoted a cheatgrass invasion by
disturbing the native vegetation through aboveground
biomass removal, increasing cheatgrass seed avail-
ability, and a combination of these treatments. Above-
ground biomass removal has promoted cheatgrass
spread in the Great Basin (Beckstead and Augspurger
2004; Chambers et al. 2007), although cheatgrass
invasion can occur even without disturbance when
sufﬁcient seeds are available and climatic conditions
are conducive to cheatgrass growth (Belnap and
Phillips 2001; Evans et al. 2001). Additionally, we
attempted to reduce cheatgrass dominance through
similar manipulations of cheatgrass-dominated areas:
aboveground biomass removal of cheatgrass and
292

increased availability of native species seeds. Lastly,
we compared edaphic properties between adjacent
native- and cheatgrass-dominated areas to evaluate
whether soil nutrient content and structure varied
between community types. We hypothesized that (1)
disturbance
to
the
native-dominated
community
would reduce the community’s resistance to invasion,
particularly in presence of enhanced cheatgrass prop-
agule pressure, and (2) disturbance to the cheatgrass-
dominated community would reduce the community’s
resistance to encroachment by native species, with
enhanced native propagule pressure increasing native
species and cover.
Methods
Study site
Mt. Trumbull is in the Uinkaret Mountains in
northwestern Arizona (36220N, 11380W). The ele-
vation ranges from 2,000 to 2,250 m. Soils are
predominantly Inceptisols derived from basalt and
occasionally
volcanic
cinders
(Jorgensen
2004).
Annual precipitation averages 412 mm, but varied
from 276 to 831 mm during the four study years
(Fig. 1). Frontal storms generate snow and rain in
winter, accounting for approximately 50% of annual
average precipitation, and monsoonal thunderstorms
from July through August account for 21%. Winter
precipitation for 2004–2007 was below average,
while monsoonal rain was average or above average
during the study.
The study site is part of a landscape-scale ecolog-
ical restoration research project. The overstory was
thinned to emulate pre-1870 forest structure. Trees
extant before 1870 were retained including replace-
ment trees for remnant evidence of trees (i.e.—
stumps) that died in the interim. Merchantable timber
was removed from site, remaining slash was lopped
and scattered, and treated areas were broadcast
burned. Thinning was conducted from 1996 to 1999
and the slash and understory were burned from 1996
to 2001 (Fig. 2). After treatment, tree density aver-
aged 399 trees ha-1 and mean basal area averaged
18.9 m2 ha-1 (see Roccaforte et al. 2009 for further
details).
Overstory vegetation was dominated by ponderosa
pine and Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt.).
Additional tree species include New Mexico locust
(Robinia neomexicana Gray), pinyon pine (Pinus
edulis Engelm.), Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosper-
ma (Torr.) Little), and quaking aspen (Populus
tremuloides Michx.). Dominant shrubs include big
sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.), wax currant
(Ribes cereum Dougl.), and Utah serviceberry (Amel-
anchier
utahensis
Koehne).
Principal
perennial
grasses are muttongrass (Poa fendleriana (Steud.)
Vasey), bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus elymoides
(Raf.) Swezey), and western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum
smithii (Rydb.) A. Lo¨ve). There is a diverse commu-
nity of annual and perennial forbs. There were no
annual grasses detected except for nonnative annual
bromes, predominantly cheatgrass.

Experimental design
We established 10 blocks of 8 plots; each block
contained one replicate of each treatment in each
community type. Treatments were randomly assigned
to plots. Each replicate treatment plot was 2 9 2 m
with a 1-m buffer. Within each plot, ten randomly
located, 20- 9 50-cm subplots were sampled for a
total sampled area of 1 m2 per plot. Plots were
excluded from cattle grazing by a 4- 9 4-m exclosure
of three-strand barbed wire.
The blocks were established across a 2.5-km wide
cheatgrass-invaded area. Within each block the
elevation, aspect, slope, soil type, and time since
restoration treatment (thinning and prescribed burn-
ing) were the same. Time-since-treatment ranged
from 4 to 8 years. The eight plots were located within
a 100-m radius of the center of each block. The
criteria for native plot selection were: location within
20 m of a cheatgrass-dominated area, and having a
native perennial grass cover of[35% and cheatgrass
cover of B1% of the total plant cover within the plot.
Cheatgrass plots were within 20 m of a native plot
and had to have more cheatgrass cover than the cover
of all native species combined. Additionally, plots in
both native- and cheatgrass-dominated areas had to
show evidence of having been prescribed burned
(i.e.—charred wood). We randomly assigned treat-
ments within each block of each community type.
We used a 2 9 2 factorial experimental design with
two levels of aboveground biomass removal and two
levels of seeding. The biomass removal (clipped)
treatment removed all aboveground live biomass from
the plots at the onset of the experiment. The seeding
treatment consisted of adding bottlebrush squirreltail,
western wheatgrass, and silver lupine (Lupinus argen-
teus Pursh) seeds to cheatgrass-dominated plots and
cheatgrass seed to native-dominated plots. The 2 9 2
factorial design generated four treatment combinations
in each community type: (1) untreated control, (2)
clipped, (3) seeded, and (4) clipped and seeded.
Experimental treatments
We removed all aboveground vegetation from clipped
plots twice: in late summer 2004 after August
vegetation measurements and in late spring 2005,
before May vegetation measurements. Clippings were
timed
to
coincide
with
maximum
aboveground
biomass of native perennials (late summer 2004)
and cheatgrass
(May 2005). Additionally, most
cheatgrass plants were ﬂowering during the May
2005 clipping treatment. In the second clipping, no
species that we experimentally seeded were removed
from clipped and seeded plots in either community,
regardless of whether the plants were seedlings or
resprouted from root stock. All vegetation was clipped
at ground level and removed from the site.
We seeded three times: fall 2004, spring 2005 and
fall 2006. For native plots, we seeded 5 g of cheatgrass
seed per plot each time, a rate consistent with BLM
seeding practices of native species for the Mt Trumbull
Ecological Restoration project (Moore et al. 2003).
This equates to approximately 200 seeds m-2 per
seeding for a total of approximately 600 seeds m-2 for
the entire study. We collected seeds for the 2004 and
2005 seedings at Mt. Trumbull in July 2004. Seeds for
the 2006 seeding were collected at Mt. Trumbull in
July 2006. Cheatgrass seed germination averaged 92%
in lab germination trials at 25C. For cheatgrass plots
we seeded 5 g of native seed with equal amounts by
weight of bottlebrush squirreltail, western wheatgrass,
and silver lupine. This equated to an average of 65
bottlebrush squirreltail, 40 western wheatgrass, and 40
silver lupine seeds m-2 per seeding, for a total
of *435 seeds m-2 for the entire study. Germination
for bottlebrush squirreltail, western wheatgrass, and
silver lupine was 60, 38, and 24%, respectively, in
laboratory tests. Silver lupine seeds were scariﬁed
prior to seeding by abrading the seed coat for 5-s with
sandpaper (Baskin and Baskin 2001).
Vegetation measurements
Each sampling period we measured plant canopy
cover by species, cheatgrass density, species richness,
and cheatgrass frequency. We visually estimated
cover of all shrubs and herbaceous plants in each
20- 9 50-cm subplot. Percent cover was measured
using a 10- 9 10-cm template to estimate 1% of a
square meter, and was summed across the 10 subplots.
Total plant cover was calculated by summing total
cover over all species. Additionally, we counted the
number of individual cheatgrass plants in each subplot
and summed across the 10 subplots for a plot-level
total. Species richness was based on plot-level pres-
ence/absence. Cheatgrass frequency was calculated
on a scale of 0–10, equal to the number of subplots per
294

plot containing at least one cheatgrass plant. Plant
species were identiﬁed to species unless reliable ﬁeld
identiﬁcation was not possible; in such cases, plants
were identiﬁed to genus. Plant nomenclature and
nativity follows USDA-NRCS (2009).
We measured vegetation twice each year: in late
May when cheatgrass was at maximum aboveground
biomass and ﬂowering, and in late August when
many native plants were at maximum aboveground
biomass. Pretreatment measurements were made in
2004. Post-treatment measurements were made in
2005, 2006 and 2007. Individual cheatgrass plants
were counted in all subplots in all years except 2006.
In spring and summer 2007 we measured cover and
then harvested all above-ground biomass from the
subplots. We clipped biomass from half of the subplots
in May 2007 and the other half in August 2007. The
subplots clipped in May were excluded from the
August 2007 measurements. Biomass was sorted by
species, oven-dried at 70C for 2 days, and weighed.
Soil samples
We collected soil samples in late August 2004 at the
onset of the study and coincident with maximum
aboveground biomass of native perennials and initia-
tion of cheatgrass germination. We collected two soil
samples from each plot. One sample was tested for pH
immediately after collection using a Denver Instru-
ment UB-5 pH meter. The second sample was returned
to the laboratory for other analyses. For each sample,
soils were collected at four ﬁxed locations within the
1-m buffer zone between the plots and exclosure fences
to a depth of 10 cm using a 4-cm diameter soil corer.
The four core samples were composited for analysis,
sieved through a 2-mm sieve, and all coarse organic
material was removed. From each sample of the second
soil collection, a 10-g subsample was placed in 100 ml
of KCl solution and stored on ice for analysis of
nutrient concentration. Samples were analyzed for
nutrient concentration at the Colorado Plateau Analyt-
ical Laboratory at NAU following Sparks (1996).
Statistical analyses
Changes in plant community variables weretested using
repeated measures MANOVA. We visually assessed
multivariate normality (Q-Q plots of the residuals) and
tested for univariate normality (Shapiro–Wilk test) and
homogeneous variances (Levene’s test). Total richness
data and all cover data except cheatgrass cover consis-
tentlymet theassumptions.Foranalyseswithsigniﬁcant
year 9 treatment interactions, we tested for year
and treatment differences using Tukey’s HSD test.
Cheatgrass cover, frequency, and density data were
non-normal and transformations did not address non-
normality. For these variables we used Kruskal–Wallis
signed ranks tests. For analyses with signiﬁcant
year 9 treatment interactions, we tested for year and
treatment differences using a two-sample Wilcoxon
signed ranks test with a Bonferroni correction. For all
nonparametric analyses,median, 25, and75thpercentile
data are presented in place of mean and standard error.
The August sampling period occurred during the
cheatgrass germination period and thus incompletely
measured cheatgrass presence and cover. Therefore, we
only analyzed cheatgrass data from May. Because the
2005 data collection immediately followed the clipping
treatment, we excluded those data from all analyses,
although we present them graphically for descriptive
purposes.
For August 2007, only the ﬁve subplots not
clipped in May 2007 were measured. Richness data
for this sampling period was therefore on a 0.5 m2
scale. To determine the amount this underestimated
richness calculated at the 1 m2 scale used in all other
measurements, we used August 2004–2006 data to
generate species accumulation curves using Esti-
mateS software (Colwell 2006); this revealed that
75–86% of all species were captured by ﬁve subplots.
We compared soil nutrient concentrations between
community types using ANOVA. Most soil data
required either log or cube-root transformation to meet
ANOVA assumptions. Due to the number of soil
analyses conducted, we used a Bonferroni correction to
control for possible Type I errors. All analyses except
for the species accumulation curves were conducted
using JMP 8.0 software (SAS Institute 2008).

cover responded positively to the seeding and clip-
ping treatment, although cheatgrass cover remained
low (\4%) throughout the experiment (Fig. 3A).
Cheatgrass cover increased signiﬁcantly from pre-
treatment levels in 2004 only in the clipped and
seeded plots in 2006. The application of additional
seed signiﬁcantly increased the frequency of cheat-
grass in 2006, but this increase was no longer
detectable by 2007 (Fig. 3B). Cheatgrass frequency
signiﬁcantly decreased after 2004 in the clipped
treatment and was present on only three of the 10
plots by 2007. Cheatgrass density did not change
signiﬁcantly throughout the study (data not shown).
In general, nonnative species were uncommon in the
native-dominated community. Besides cheatgrass, the
only other nonnative species were prickly lettuce
(Lactuca serriola L.), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa
pratensis L.), tumblemustard (Sisymbrium altissimum
L.), and yellow salsify (Tragopogon dubius Scop.).
Of nonnative species other than cheatgrass, Kentucky
bluegrass had the highest cover (1.1%) on any one
plot.
We detected no treatment effect for total cover in
either the May or August measurements for the
native-dominated community (Fig. 4A, B). In both
sampling periods, there was a signiﬁcant year effect,
with total cover increasing from 2004 to 2006. In
May, cover returned to pretreatment levels by 2007,
while in August cover continued to increase. Total
cover consisted of almost entirely native species with
bottlebrush squirreltail accounting for 40–100% of
total cover in both May and August (Fig. 4C, D). In
both May and August there was a signiﬁcant
treatment effect for bottlebrush squirreltail cover,
with the clipped and seeded treatment resulting in
reduced cover. There was also a signiﬁcant year
effect for bottlebrush squirreltail cover in both May
and August, with greater cover after treatment than
pretreatment. There was no detectable treatment
effect on ﬁnal biomass in either sampling period in
2007.
Over the course of the study we detected 68
species in the native-dominated community, with 53
of them observed in May and 51 observed in August.
May species richness decreased by nearly half over
the course of the study, regardless of treatment
(Fig. 4E). By May 2007, plots averaged only four
species m-2. Nonnative species, typically cheatgrass,
accounted for an average of \1 species m-2. There
was a signiﬁcant time x treatment interaction for
August species richness (Fig. 4F). The clipped plots
had
a signiﬁcant reduction in
species
richness
between 2004 and 2007, while the seeded plots had
a signiﬁcant increase between the same years. The
consistent
annual
reduction
in
species
richness
observed in May did not occur in August. As in
May, an average of \1 nonnative species m-2
occurred; cheatgrass was most common; others were
purslane (Portulaca oleracea L.), yellow salsify, and
common mullein (Verbascum thapsis L.) The greatest
cover of nonnative species excluding cheatgrass on
any one plot was 1.8% for common mullein.
The inﬂuence of disturbance and native propagule
pressure on the persistence of cheatgrass
By the end of our study, cheatgrass continued to
dominate the invaded community regardless of treat-
ment for measurements in May. We detected a

signiﬁcant year by treatment interaction for cheatgrass
cover in May. The interaction was the result of the
clipped treatments and clipped and seeded treatments
in 2006 having signiﬁcantly lower cover than the
control and seeded treatments (Fig. 5A). By 2007,
cheatgrass cover remained lower in the two treatments
that included clipping, but variability was high and
differences were not signiﬁcant. Cheatgrass density
was not signiﬁcantly affected by treatments, but more
than doubled from 2004 to 2007 (Fig. 5B). Since
cheatgrass cover was roughly the same in 2004 and
2007, the cheatgrass population in 2007 consisted of
more numerous, but smaller plants.
In May, the treatment by year interaction was
signiﬁcant for total cover (Fig. 6A). The control and
seeded treatments showed a signiﬁcant increase from
2004 to 2006, with no signiﬁcant difference between
2004 and 2007. There was no signiﬁcant treatment
response in May of any year in the clipped or clipped
and seeded treatments. The trends in total cover were
similar
to
cheatgrass
cover,
since
cheatgrass
accounted for approximately 75% of all cover
throughout the study (Figs. 5A, 6A). There was no
signiﬁcant treatment effect for total cover in August,
but there was a signiﬁcant year effect, with total
cover increasing throughout the study (Fig. 6B).
Seeded species cover did not differ by treatment in
May and remained below 8% for all treatments and
years (Fig. 6C). In May of both 2004 and 2007,
seeded species cover accounted for approximately
7% of total species cover. In August, however, there
was a signiﬁcant annual increase in seeded species
cover regardless of treatment, suggesting that the
increased cover was driven by natural recruitment,

not our experimental seeding (Fig. 6D). There was no
detectable treatment effect for either May or August
biomass in 2007 (data not shown).
We observed a total of 75 species on the cheat-
grass plots over the course of the study, seven more
than on the native plots. In May, we observed 60
species on the cheatgrass plots including 10 nonna-
tive species and in August we observed a total of 62
species, again with 10 nonnative species. Cheatgrass
was the dominant nonnative species on all cheatgrass-
invaded plots, regardless of sampling season. In May,
maximum cover for the other nonnative species
ranged from 0.25% for black bindweed (Polygonum
convolvulus) to 8% for tumblemustard. In August,
nonnative species were typically rare with low cover
on the cheatgrass-dominated plots, although common
mullein cover on one plot was 15.75%. Treatment
and year signiﬁcantly affected total richness in May,
with richness in clipped, and clipped and seeded plots
having nearly double the number of species as in the
seeded and control in 2006 and 2007 (Fig. 6E). In
August,
species
richness
was
not
signiﬁcantly
affected by treatment, but varied signiﬁcantly over
time with all treatments increasing by 1–2 species
m-2 from 2004 to 2007 (Fig. 6F).
Soil properties
We detected three signiﬁcant differences in concen-
trations of soil nutrients between native- and cheat-
grass-dominated communities at the onset of the
study in 2004 (Table 1). Concentrations differed for
phosphate (PO4), total nitrogen (N) and nitrate (NO3).
Of these nutrients, NO3 differed the most, with
concentrations in cheatgrass-dominated soils two
times higher than in native-dominated soils. Soil
texture was similar in the two communities and
averaged approximately 66, 11, and 23% for sand,
silt, and clay, respectively.
Discussion
Both native- and cheatgrass-dominated communities
on Mt. Trumbull were resistant to shifts in species
dominance
despite
two
aboveground
biomass
removal disturbances and elevated seed availability
over the ﬁrst 3 years of the study. Given the
similarities in disturbance history, soil type and
texture, weather inﬂuences, and geography, as well
as the close proximity of the plots (20 m), we suspect
that resistance to encroachment by subordinate spe-
cies is due to post-invasion differences in the plant
communities, rather than pre-existing differences
among
native-
and
cheatgrass-dominated
plots.
Native-dominated communities were not only resis-
tant to cheatgrass encroachment; cheatgrass was
nearly extirpated from the plots by 2007 regardless
of treatment. In May 2007, cheatgrass-dominated
areas
returned
to
pretreatment
levels
for
most
parameters of community composition. Thus, clip-
ping had only short-term effects on cheatgrass-
dominated communities in May when cheatgrass
was at maximum aboveground biomass. The only
change in community dominance we detected was in
the cheatgrass-dominated community in August when
cheatgrass was germinating and contributed little
plant cover. By August 2007, bottlebrush squirreltail
cover was approximately equal to cheatgrass cover.
The resistance of the two communities to sustained
changes in composition may have been facilitated by

differences in soil nutrient concentrations. Total N,
NO3, and PO4 were higher in the cheatgrass-domi-
nated areas than in native-dominated areas. Lower
plant-available N and P in the native-dominated
community would favor the native perennial species
over annuals such as cheatgrass. While this scenario
is consistent with plant ecology theory, our data
cannot verify that soil nutrients were the driving
mechanism in limiting cheatgrass invasion or pro-
moting cheatgrass persistence.
Invasion resistance in the native-dominated
community
The clipping and seeding treatments in this study
were unsuccessful in inducing cheatgrass establish-
ment in the native-dominated community. Cheatgrass
seeding treatments resulted in an initial increase in
cheatgrass cover and frequency, but following this
initial pulse cheatgrass was actually less prevalent
in 2007 than before treatment in 2004. The initial
increase
in
cheatgrass
lends
some
support
for
hypothesis #1—disturbance to the native-dominated
community would reduce community resistance to
invasion, particularly in presence of elevated cheat-
grass propagule pressure. The predicted increase in
cheatgrass was, however, only transient.
While we did not expect our treatments to create a
complete shift in dominance from native species to
cheatgrass, the failure of increased disturbance and
propagule pressure to increase cheatgrass establish-
ment was unexpected. Disturbance and propagule
pressure are considered main drivers of invasion
(Elton 1958; Hobbs and Huenneke 1992; Williamson

1996). Recent ﬁeld research has supported this
theory, with propagule pressure often being more
important than disturbance in promoting invasion
(Von Holle and Simberloff 2005; Lambrinos 2006;
Eschtruth and Battles 2009).
Several factors may explain our inability to
experimentally induce cheatgrass establishment in
the native-dominated community. One factor that
may have regulated cheatgrass success during the
study is precipitation. Cheatgrass seedlings are highly
susceptible to mortality through desiccation (Pierson
and Mack 1990a). The last two winters of our study
had below-average precipitation that may have lim-
ited cheatgrass performance. Furthermore, the native
community on Mt. Trumbull was dominated by
bottlebrush squirreltail, a species that is considered
a strong competitor with cheatgrass. Bottlebrush
squirreltail and its congeneric relative, big squirreltail
(Elymus multisetus M.E. Jones), can limit cheatgrass
establishment and
spread (Booth et
al. 2003a;
Humphrey and Schupp 2004; Leger 2008). In a Great
Basin shrub-steppe study, areas with [15% bottle-
brush squirreltail cover almost completely excluded
cheatgrass (Booth et al. 2003a). Like cheatgrass,
bottlebrush squirreltail is physiologically active very
early in the growing season, which may explain its
ability to compete with cheatgrass (Jones 1998). The
effectiveness of bottlebrush squirreltail as a compet-
itor, however, seems to be dependent on plant life
stage, with mature plants being strong competitors
but seedlings unable to compete with cheatgrass
(Humphrey and Schupp 2004).
Lastly, lower levels of plant-available N and P in
soils of the native community may have favored
native perennials over cheatgrass. As an annual
species, cheatgrass generally has greater dependence
on plant-available soil nutrients for successful estab-
lishment and persistence than perennial species
(Marschner 1995). Past research has shown both soil
nutrient concentration and native species competition
to be important in regulating invasions (Link et al.
1995; Booth et al. 2003a; Chambers et al. 2007);
possibly their combined inﬂuences provided both
community resiliency and resistance to cheatgrass
invasion in our study.
Persistence of cheatgrass in the invaded
community
Cheatgrass cover in May was reduced by clipping in
2006, but the effect was transient and diminished in
2007. Furthermore, seeding with native species had
no signiﬁcant effect on any community characteristic
of the cheatgrass-dominated community. This result
gives limited support to hypothesis #2—disturbance
to
the
cheatgrass-dominated
community
would
reduce the community’s resistance to encroachment
by native species, with enhanced native propagule
pressure increasing native species cover. Speciﬁcally,
our results partially support the hypothesis that the

cheatgrass population would be reduced by distur-
bance, though only in the ﬁrst two growing seasons
after treatment. The results do not, however, support
the hypothesis that seeding treatments would promote
native species cover.
Cheatgrass has been highly persistent in many
ecosystems after invasion (Mack 1981; Brandt and
Rickard 1994; Knapp 1996). Numerous studies have
examined the possibility of reducing dominance of
cheatgrass, and other nonnative annual brome grasses,
by mowing, seeding, soil nutrient reduction through
carbon and other chemical amendments, and herbi-
cide application (Hull Jr. and Stewart 1948; Belnap
et al. 2003; Scoles et al. 2003; Davison and Smith
2007; Belnap and Sherrod 2009). While many
techniques have temporarily reduced cheatgrass pop-
ulations, most research suggests that long-term sup-
pression of cheatgrass requires actively reducing
cheatgrass and promoting perennial grasses, usually
through seeding (Hull Jr. and Stewart 1948; Cox and
Anderson 2004; Davison and Smith 2007). This
approach was ineffective during 3 years of seeding
and 4 years of measurements in our study. The failure
of the seeded species, bottlebrush squirreltail, silver
lupine, and western wheatgrass, to establish may be
due to inability as seedlings to compete with cheat-
grass (Hull Jr. 1963; Lowe et al. 2003; Humphrey and
Schupp 2004). The continued increase in seeded
species cover in August measurements, however,
suggests that the community dynamics may not be
resolved. Interestingly, the increase in seeded species
cover in August was independent of treatment,
suggesting that natural re-establishment of the species
contributed to their increased cover. While increases
in seeded species cover were not detected in May by
the end of the study, it is possible that continued
increases in late-season native cover may reach a level
that inhibits success of future cheatgrass generations.
One factor that may have contributed to the
persistence of cheatgrass was the higher plant-avail-
able soil N and P concentrations in the cheatgrass plots
compared to native plots prior to treatment. These
nutrients are important in regulating cheatgrass com-
petitive ability with native species (Dakheel et al.
1993; Booth et al. 2003b; Miller et al. 2006a; Belnap
and Sherrod 2009). Elevated soil N is often associated
with cheatgrass-dominated communities when com-
pared to native communities (Bolton Jr. et al. 1993;
Booth et al. 2003b; Belnap et al. 2005; Sperry et al.
2006). Higher levels of plant-available soil N in
association with cheatgrass tend to occur prior to and
during cheatgrass germination periods in late summer
and early autumn. As cheatgrass matures, soil N levels
reduce to levels detected in association with native
perennial species (Booth et al. 2003b). Most studies
examining cheatgrass—soil N relationships have been
conducted in the Great Basin Desert; little is known
about these relationships in mountain forests. In
addition to N, plant-available P often limits plant
productivity (Elser et al. 2007). Field research has
shown a positive relationship between plant-available
P and cheatgrass performance (Bashkin et al. 2003;
Belnap et al. 2003; Miller et al. 2006a, b). Miller et al.
(2006a) suggested that plant-available P was the
primary limitation to cheatgrass performance in a
southern Utah study. Additionally, cheatgrass may
increase labile P in invaded soils through rhizosphere
acidiﬁcation (Miller et al. 2006a, b). As with N,
however, little is known about the role of P in
regulating cheatgrass invasion in mountain forests.
This study cannot conﬁrm a causal relationship
between soil nutrients and species distribution and
further research is necessary to determine whether the
differences we observed in soil N and P regulated the
heterogeneous distribution of cheatgrass on Mt.
Trumbull. Nonetheless, our ﬁnding of an association
between cheatgrass and high levels of plant-available
soil N and P is consistent with other studies and
supports the theory that cheatgrass success is greatest
in patches with high plant-available soil N and P.
Conclusions
None of our hypotheses was fully supported by our
data. First, we proposed that disturbance via complete
clipping of aboveground biomass would increase
cheatgrass cover and abundance on native-dominated
plots, particularly in plots with an enhanced cheat-
grass seed bank. Instead, we found the native com-
munity on Mt. Trumbull was resistant to further
invasion regardless of treatment. This result suggests
that factors governing invasion of native communities
are complex and elevated disturbance and seed
availability may not always result in invasion. Second,
we proposed that disturbance to cheatgrass-dominated
plots would reduce cheatgrass populations, with
native seed amendments promoting native species

cover. Cheatgrass populations were only slightly
reduced by disturbance and native species failed to
establish, even after nearly 500 seeds m-2 were sown
over 3 years. The herbaceous understory at the study
site was dominated by two grass species at the end of
the study: bottlebrush squirreltail on native plots and
cheatgrass on cheatgrass plots. This pattern may be
the result of species-speciﬁc responses to spatial
variation in plant-available soil N and P at the study
site. We conclude that shifts in dominant herbaceous
communities at Mt. Trumbull could not be induced by
disturbance and elevated seed availability. Instead,
communities that were dominated by a single, highly
competitive species, regardless of the nativity of that
species, were resistant to changes in community
dominance.
