For more than a century ecosystems around the world have experienced an increase in the dominance of
woody species. While the drivers of woody plant proliferation are complex, interactions between climate
and land-use change are commonly invoked as primary contributing factors. In ponderosa pine forests of
western North America, substantial increases in tree densities are impacting overall forest health and
increasing the risk for severe wildﬁres and insect and disease outbreaks. Addressing this problem through
the use of ecological restoration projects is widely advocated. Our objective was to quantify understory
vegetation response ﬁve years after thinning and burning treatments in a southwestern ponderosa pine
forest. We remeasured plant species richness and cover on thinned + burned, burned only, and untreated
controls replicated four time in a BACI design. An untreated control (Untreated) was used for comparison
of two alternative restoration treatments (1) thinning followed by prescribed ﬁre (Thin + Burn) and (2)
prescribed ﬁre only (Burn-only). Understory species richness and total plant cover increased signiﬁcantly
in Thin + Burn compared to the Untreated and Burn-only treatments. Analysis of functional group com-
position revealed increases in species richness and cover was driven primarily by changes in annual–bi-
ennial forbs and graminoids. We then compared our results with those of three Long-term Ecological
Restoration and Assessment Network (LEARN) sites. We found total and native plant cover showed evi-
dence of a consistent response to Thin + Burn treatments across all sites. However, results suggest that
understory response to restoration treatments is under strong environmental control. As a consequence
the range of variability associated with understory responses should be expected to expand or contract
depending on where treatments are implemented. Overall our ﬁndings add to a growing body of litera-
ture that restoration treatments combining mechanical thinning and prescribed ﬁre are useful for
increasing native understory abundance and diversity.

1. Introduction
Increases in the abundance woody species into grasslands, for-
est openings, and savannahs is a global phenomenon that has
received much attention in recent decades (Archer, 1989, 1995;
Covington and Moore, 1994; Scheffer et al., 2001; Eldridge et al.,
2011). Increases in the density of woody plants has been docu-
mented in the Chaco region of Argentina (Cabral et al., 2003),
savannahs of Africa (Roques et al., 2001; Moleele et al., 2002),
woodlands of Australia (Burrows et al., 1990; Bowman et al.,
2001), and the arid and semiarid regions of North America (Van
Auken, 2000). These transitions have led to drastic changes in land-
scape cover causing both socioeconomic (Moleele et al., 2002;
Smit, 2004; Cabral et al., 2003) and environmental impacts
(D’Odorico et al., 2010; Ratajczak et al., 2012). While reversing this
trend represents an important challenge to scientists and natural
resource practitioners, understanding the impact of alternative
restoration techniques is required for making sound management
decisions.
It is recognized that in many cases these are native species that
were historically present at lower densities and are currently at
densities outside of their natural range of variability (Archer,
1995). For that reason natural (or historical) range of variability
concepts provide a relevant context within which to quantify key
structural and functional conditions that can be used as a reference
to guide restoration efforts, determine site potential, and evaluate
targets. Natural variability represents the range of spatial and tem-
poral conditions under which the ecological and evolutionary con-
ditions of a system are sustained (Landres et al., 1999; Moore et al.,
1999). Therefore quantifying the natural range of variability is not
only fundamental to restoring ecological integrity but instrumental

to assessing ecological changes and developing reference condi-
tions that can be used to guide restoration projects (Covington
et al., 1997; Landres et al., 1999; US Congress, 2003, Health
Forest Restoration Act).
In ponderosa pine forests of the Southwest, the natural range of
variability is widely accepted to represent conditions that existed
prior to large-scale Euro-American settlement (i.e. presettlement)
which
began
around
1870
(Larson
and
Churchill,
2012).
Historically, frequent, low-severity surface ﬁres were an integral
component of ecological function (Fulé et al., 1997). Empirical evi-
dence indicates that ﬁre maintained a heterogeneous overstory
structure characterized by individual trees and tree groups inter-
spersed within a mosaic of grass, forb, and shrub dominated open-
ings (Reynolds et al., 2013).
There is a general census that throughout their range, contem-
porary ponderosa pine forests exist outside of their natural range
of
variability
making
them
increasingly
susceptible
to
landscape-scale, high intensity wildﬁres. Early studies and histori-
cal accounts describe ponderosa pine forests as having open,
park-like stands consisting of large trees interspersed among open-
ings of a diverse and productive, grass-dominated understory
(Beale, 1858; Woolsey, 1911; Pearson, 1923; Weaver, 1943;
Cooper, 1960; White, 1985). These historical conditions were
maintained primarily by frequent, low-intensity surface ﬁres that
acted to regulate the competitive balance between overstory and
understory communities. Over the last 150+ years, a number of
factors including grazing, logging, and ﬁre suppression have com-
bined to favor pine establishment at the expense of understory
diversity and productivity. As a consequence contemporary forests
often contain uncharacteristically high tree densities with closed
canopies, lower light availability, and deeper forest ﬂoor litter
and duff layers (Covington and Moore, 1994; Johnson, 1994;
Vankat, 2011; Larson and Churchill, 2012). A major consequence
of this has been the degradation of understory integrity, including
declines in understory cover, productivity, and diversity. While
often overlooked, the understory plant community is an integral
component of structure and function in ponderosa pine ecosys-
tems, inﬂuencing nutrient turnover rates, watershed function,
wildlife habitat, and providing fuel for frequent surface ﬁres
(Allen et al., 2002; Kaye et al., 2005).
Management actions designed to mitigate these impacts are
increasingly being advocated across western North America.
Restoration objectives in ponderosa pine forests are commonly
developed within an evidence-based framework designed to
restore (1) overstory forest structure – age, size and spatial distri-
bution of trees – to within its historical range of variability and (2)
increase native understory plant cover and diversity (Fulé et al.,
1997; Mast et al., 1999; Moore et al., 1999; Dodson and Peterson,
2010). Prescriptions appropriate for meeting these objectives use
site-speciﬁc reference information to emulate key overstory char-
acteristics. These include structural and compositional information
obtained from both ‘‘legacy’’ and ‘‘latency’’ evidence (sensu White
and Walker, 1997). Legacy information pertains to evidence such
as remnant logs, stumps, and stags, while latency information is
gained through dendrochronological techniques (Mast et al.,
1999; Sánchez-Meador et al., 2010; Reynolds et al., 2013).
Alternative restoration techniques for meeting these objectives
include mechanical thinning, prescribed ﬁre, or a combination of
the two. Empirical studies assessing treatment success have shown
that a combination of mechanical thinning plus prescribed ﬁre is
most successful at meeting overstory restoration targets (Fulé
et al., 2005; Korb et al., 2012). It is assumed that these manage-
ment interventions restore the key feedback interactions between
pattern and process under which these forests evolved, enhance
ecological integrity, and increase resilience to disturbance (Fulé
et al., 1997; Roccaforte et al., 2015). Yet consensus on meeting
understory objectives remains mixed. For example, in a recent
meta-analysis of 12 national Fire and Fire Surrogate (FFS) sites,
Schwilk et al. (2009), found no consistent response of understory
plant communities to mechanical thinning and burning treat-
ments. A result that could be attributable to regional variation in
disturbance history, climate, and anthropogenic activities. For
example, in a recent study Ratajczak et al. (2012) found that across
13 grass-dominated ecosystems in North America, woody plant
encroachment had a greater impact on diversity at sites with
higher precipitation.
Although the natural range of variability in overstory structure
and composition is readily obtained by reconstructing presettle-
ment forest structure (Huffman et al., 2001), no such quantitative
method is currently available for the understory plant community.
Therefore, developing more speciﬁc restoration objectives for the
understory plant community represents an under developed and
challenging area of research (Laughlin et al., 2006).
Our current understanding of the range of understory variabil-
ity in terms of cover, species composition, and diversity in the
Southwest comes from studies using phytolith analysis, seed
banks, relict sites or remnant grass patches and long-term perma-
nent plots. Kerns et al. (2001) made comparisons between contem-
porary vegetation and surface soil phytolith assemblages to
understand
forest-grassland
vegetation
dynamics.
Total
above-ground understory community was composed of 70%
grasses and shrubs. Overall the dominant species were C3 grasses.
Korb et al. (2005) examined the viable soil seed bank across a dis-
turbance gradient. In general there was little correlation between
below ground seed bank composition and above ground species
composition. However sites that had received the lowest level of
disturbance were dominated by late successional graminoid spe-
cies. Gildar et al. (2004) examined understory reference conditions
by comparing two relict sites (burned) to a nearby forest within
which ﬁre had been excluded since 1879 (unburned) on the
North Rim of the Grand Canyon. Relict sites tended to have higher
species richness, and total herbaceous cover, including both forbs
and graminoids. While there was no difference in overstory charac-
teristics between sites, relict sites tended to be more production.
Few studies provide long term data following restoration treat-
ments; however this is valuable information for understanding
variability and community dynamics. In one of the longest running
restoration to date Laughlin et al. (2006) evaluated changes in rem-
nant grass openings which they considered representative of the
range of natural variability of herbaceous vegetation. Theses rem-
nant grass openings were dominated by C3 graminoids, followed
by C4 graminoids and legumes.
Collectively these studies provide information on a range of
understory responses; however, they either lack a consistent
response variable or the temporal resolution needed to accurately
quantify variability of understory conditions. Historical and repeat
photographs are an underutilized tool as well and can offer valu-
able insight into past vegetation structure, yet provide limited
quantitative information on herbaceous species abundance or dis-
tributions (Egan and Howell, 2001).
Understory response to restoration takes place over time and
monitoring over multiple years is required to determine changes
in understory communities following treatments. With adequate
temporal resolution, one approach to quantify a range of variability
for understory response would be to combine data from multiple
sites across a common ecosystem. A primary objective for under-
story plant response following ecological restoration treatments
is to increase cover and diversity of native vegetation. In this study
we evaluated whether this objective was met ﬁve years after alter-
native
restoration
treatments
in

Forest in east-central Arizona and part of Northern Arizona

University Ecological Restoration Institute’s Long-term Ecological
Assessment and Restoration Network (LEARN). We then compared
our results with those of three Long-term Ecological Restoration
and Assessment Network (LEARN) sites. Our second objective
was to compare the understory response patterns we observed
with those following similar treatments in this region and to
understand the degree to which responses are constrained by
site-level variation in precipitation. A better understand of the con-
sistency in understory response to these types of restoration treat-
ments will provide valuable information to land managers in this
region.
2. Methods
2.1. Study area
We conducted the experiment in the Mineral Ecosystem
Management Area (Mineral), in east-central Arizona (N34100,
W109380) on the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, approxi-
mately 30 km southeast of Show Low, AZ (Fig. 1). Mineral is part
of the Long-term Ecological Assessment and Restoration Network
(LEARN). The Ecological Restoration Institute (ERI) at Northern
Arizona University, in cooperation with various land management
agencies, established a series of sites within the LEARN to monitor
the effects of alternative forest restoration prescriptions using a
robust replicated study design. The LEARN represents a system of
restoration treatments using standardized methods of data collec-
tion ranging from pinyon-juniper to dry mixed-conifer forests.
Our study site at Mineral ranged in elevation from 2340 to
2580 m with an average slope of 7%. The site is primarily domi-
nated by ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson) although
it spans a gradient from a pinyon-juniper ecotone to the lower
reaches of a dry mixed conifer ecotone. The understory is domi-
nated by graminoid species, including Arizona fescue (Festuca
arizonica Vasey), mountain muhly (Muhlenbergia montana (Nutt.)
A.S. Hitch.), mutton grass (Poa fendleriana (Steud.) Vasey), and
White Mountain sedge (Carex geophila Mackenzie). Dominant
native forbs include alpine false spring parsley (Pseudocymopterus
montanus A. Gray), American vetch (Vicia americana Muhl. Ex.
Willd.), common yarrow (Achillea millefolium L.) groundcover milk-
vetch (Astragalus humistratus A. Gray), trailing ﬂeabane (Erigeron
ﬂagellaris (A. Gray), and Wright’s deervetch (Lotus wrightii A.
Gray). The dominant native shrub species include wax currant
(Ribes cereum Douglas) and Woods’ rose (Rosa woodsii Lindl.).
Soils are classiﬁed as a complex of Mollic Eutroboralfs, Lithic
Argiborolls, and Eutric Glossoboralfs, ﬁne to cobbly clay loam in
texture, derived from volcanic parent material (USDA Forest
Service 1987). Between 1984 and 2013, annual precipitation at
Greer, Arizona (elevation 2500 m, approximately 25 km southeast
of the study site) averaged 494 mm with an average minimum
temperature of 9.1 C in January and an average maximum tem-
perature of 24.3 C in July (Fig. 2; Greer NCDC COOP Station ID
023683 and Greer Remote Automated Weather Station (RAWS)
ID 020404, Western Regional Climate Center, www.wrcc.dri.edu).
Most precipitation occurs in winter as snowfall and during sum-
mer monsoon storms.
2.2. Experimental design and ﬁeld measurements
In 2002, we established four replicate blocks of three randomly
assigned treatment units, each unit approximately 13 ha in size
(see Roccaforte et al., 2015). Experimental blocks were located to
represent the range of elevations across which ponderosa pine for-
ests occur at our study site. An untreated control (Untreated) was
used for comparison of two alternative restoration treatments (1)
thinning followed by prescribed ﬁre (Thin + Burn) and (2) pre-
scribed ﬁre only (Burn-only). Thinning treatments were based on
a site-speciﬁc reconstruction of pre-ﬁre forest structure (1880)
Fig. 1. Mineral study site location in eastern Arizona in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest (upper left inset). Shown are three treatments and four experimental blocks
(EB) located on a 240-m elevation gradient, ranging between approximately 2340–2580 m.

using principles described by Roccaforte et al. (2015). Thinning
prescriptions retained all living conifers presumed to have estab-
lished before 1880 (i.e., presettlement), or >40 cm diameter at
breast
height
(dbh).
In
addition,
from
1.5
to
3
postsettlement-aged trees of similar species were retained as
replacement trees for each presettlement remnant (e.g., snags, logs
and stumps). The number of younger trees retained depended on
replacement
tree
size;
when
the
replacement
trees
were
<40.6 cm diameter at breast height (dbh), the higher retention
number was used within an 18-m radius of the given presettle-
ment remnant. Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt.) and quaking
aspen
(Populus
tremuloides
Michx.)
trees
were
not
thinned.
Thinning treatments were implemented between July of 2006
and February 2007. Prescribed burning was conducted by U.S.
Forest Service crews using strip head ﬁres in all treatment units
on 30 and 31 October and 1 November 2008 (Roccaforte et al.,
2015).
To evaluate understory responses to alternative restoration
treatments, twenty permanent 50-m transects were systematically
established on a 60-m grid in each of the twelve experimental
units. Transects were aligned parallel to the general slope, and
end points were marked with steel rebar. Transects formed the
centerline of 500-m2 (10  50 m) sampling belts. Within each belt,
we identiﬁed each plant species occurring in order to sample spe-
cies richness. We also visually estimated species cover within ﬁve
1-m2 quadrats (0.5  2 m) systematically located at 10-m intervals
along each transect. Plant cover estimates were based on percent
foliar cover by species. Plant nomenclature follows USDA NRCS
(2014), the PLANTS Database (http://plants.usda.gov). Species rich-
ness data were collected between 17 June and 11 August 2002
before treatment, and again between 26 July and 28 August
2013, ﬁve years after treatment implementation. Cover data were
collected in 2013 only.
2.3. Statistical analysis
We
calculated
a
number
of
univariate
and
multivariate
response metrics to examine understory community dynamics in
response to restoration treatments. All metrics were averaged
across plots at the treatment level (n = 4). Species richness was
based on the number of unique species present within each belt
transect. Community and functional group composition within
the belt transects were based on average number of occurrences
of each species and functional group. For quadrat data we
examined changes in community composition and functional
groups based on the average percent foliar cover of each species
and functional group.
Treatment effects on the herbaceous understory community
were tested using PERMANOVA in the PERMANOVA+ add-on (v.
1.0.3) to PRIMER (v.6.1.13). PERMANOVA (Anderson, 2001) relieves
the assumption of normally distributed data and can be applied
equivalently to univariate and multivariate ecological response
variables. The appropriate sums of squares are calculated from a
distance matrix that can be obtained using any distance measure
(Anderson, 2001). Bray-Curtis dissimilarity was used as the dis-
tance measure for multivariate comparisons of community compo-
sition
as
recommended
by
Faith
et
al.
(1987).
Euclidean
dissimilarity was used as the distance measure for all the univari-
ate comparisons (total understory cover, species richness, and
cover of each functional group).
To make comparisons of understory responses we quantiﬁed a
range of variability associated with understory responses to
restoration using three comparison LEARN sites located in pon-
derosa pine forests of northern Arizona; Fort Valley (FV), Mount
Trumbull (MT), and Grandview (GV) (Table 1). All three sites are
located across a gradient of precipitation and soil types, represent-
ing a broad range of ponderosa pine forest types with characteristic
differences in the contribution of species and functional groups to
understory cover and diversity (Table 1).
Effects of alternative restoration treatments at these sites have
been reported in separate publications (see Stoddard et al., 2011
for FV; McGlone et al., 2009 for MT; Fulé et al., 2005 for GV). We
focus on one restoration alternative that is consistent across all
of our LEARN sites: (1) thinning to emulate pre-ﬁre exclusion con-
ditions + a prescribed burn (Thin + Burn). We combined ﬁve year
post-treatment measurement data from FV, MT, and GV to quantify
the range of understory responses. We used the average value for
understory cover and richness data to bracket a range of responses
represented by the lowest and highest average value for each
understory variable across sites (Table 2; Roccaforte et al., 2015).
We also examine the ﬁve year post-treatment response of total
and native understory cover and richness using the natural log

3. Results
3.1. Responses at Mineral
3.1.1. Pre-treatment
Prior to treatments there were no detectable differences among
treatments in either total plant species richness or richness by
functional group (Table 3). Prior to treatment, a total of 172 species
were detected across experimental units. Pretreatment species
richness averaged 22.8 (per 500 m2) in Untreated, 24.7 in the
Burn-only units, and 25.4 in the Thin + Burn units (Table 3).
3.1.2. Post-treatment richness
Post-treatment sampling showed the total number of species
across all experimental units increased to 235. Average species
richness increased 33%, 36%, and 45% in Untreated, Burn-only,
and
Thin + Burn
treatment
units,
respectively
(Table
3).
Treatments signiﬁcantly affected total species richness in 2013.
Pairwise comparisons revealed signiﬁcantly higher species rich-
ness in Thin + Burn treatments compared to the Untreated and
Burn-only units (Table 3), which was driven primarily by an
increase in the number of forb species. Post-treatment results
showed signiﬁcant treatment effects on total forb functional group
richness (Table 3). Pairwise posterior comparisons of forb richness
showed signiﬁcant differences between Untreated, Burn-only, and
Thin + Burn treatments. Thin + Burn units were found to have the
highest number of forb species, followed by Burn-only and
Untreated units, respectively. This difference between treatments
in total forb richness was driven by an increase in annual–biennial
forb species across all units. We found no signiﬁcant treatment
effect for any other functional group.
Post-treatment results show signiﬁcant treatment effects for
both native and nonnative species richness. Native species richness
was signiﬁcantly greater in Thin + Burn treatments compared to
both
Burn-only
and
Untreated
treatments.
Burn-only
and
Untreated units showed no signiﬁcant differences in native species
richness. Average native species richness increased 41% in the
Thin + Burn treatments compared to 31% and 34% in Untreated
and Burn-only, respectively (Table 3).
Results for nonnative species richness were similar to those of
native richness.
Nonnative
species
richness
was
signiﬁcantly
higher
in
Thin + Burn
treatments
compared
to
both
Untreated
and
Burn-only treatments. We detected ten nonnative species prior
to treatment in 2002 and 18 species, post-treatment in 2013
(Appendix Table A1). Average nonnative richness accounted for
less than 8% of total species richness across all treatment units.
The
most
common
non-native
species
in
Burn-only
and
Thin + Burn units included common dandelion (Taraxacum ofﬁci-
nale F.H. Wigg), followed by common mullein (Verbascum thapsus
L.), and bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare ((Savi) Ten.).
3.1.3. Post-treatment cover
We found a signiﬁcant treatment effect on total plant cover
(Table 4). Pairwise comparisons showed signiﬁcantly greater plant
cover in Thin + Burn treatments when compared to the Untreated
and Burn only treatments. Differences between units in total cover
was due to increases in the cover of forb and graminoid functional
groups. Model results showed that treatment had a signiﬁcant
effect on both forb and graminoid cover (Table 4).

Total forb cover was signiﬁcantly higher in Thin + Burn relative
to Untreated units. While total forb cover was notably higher in
Thin + Burn relative to Burn-only treatments, this difference was
not found to be signiﬁcant. A difference in total forb cover can be
attributed to increases in annual–biennial forb cover which was
found to be signiﬁcantly greater in Thin + Burn when compared
to Burn-only and Untreated treatments. We found a treatment
effect on total graminoid cover which was found to be signiﬁcantly
greater in Thin + Burn treatments compared to Burn-only or
Untreated units.
Although native plant cover accounted for greater than 90% of
the total plant cover in all treatment units, we found no signiﬁcant
treatment effect on native plant cover. We did however ﬁnd a sig-
niﬁcant difference between treatments in nonnative plant cover.
Nonnative cover averaged 0.08%, 0.32%, and 0.97% in Untreated,
Burn-only, and Thin + Burn plots, respectively, and was found to
differ signiﬁcantly between Thin + Burn and Untreated treatments.
We acknowledge that these slight differences might not have bio-
logical signiﬁcance. No other difference was found between treat-
ments in nonnative plant cover.
3.2. Comparison with LEARN sites
3.2.1. Species richness
We found species richness increased in Thin + Burn units rela-
tive to Untreated units at two of the three comparison LEARN sites.
Pretreatment species richness values at Mineral were within the
range of response values observed post-treatment across the com-
parison LEARN sites. The increase in species richness values in
Thin + Burn
units
at
Mineral
exceeded
those
observed
in
Thin + Burn
units
at
the
LEARN
comparison
sites
(Fig.
3).
Including results from Mineral, average species richness values
have increased in response to Thin + Burn treatments at three of
the four LEARN sites.
3.2.2. Cover
In contrast to species richness we did ﬁnd evidence for a consis-
tent understory response for total and native plant cover following
Thin + Burn treatments (Fig. 4). Total plant cover ﬁve years
post-treatment for the comparison LEARN sites ranged from an
average of 7.2% at FV to 13.1% at MT in Thin + Burn units. Only total
plant cover in Thin + Burn units fell within this range. Native plant
cover across the comparison sites ranged from 6.1% at MT to 9.2%

at GV. Average native plant cover in Thin + Burn units at Mineral
fell just above these values, at 9.6%.
3.2.3. LNRR
Our results indicate strong environmental constraints on under-
story response following Thin + Burn treatments (Fig. 5). Five years
post-treatment, total and native understory cover was greater in
Thin + Burn units relative to Untreated units across all LEARN sites.
Net change in native cover tended to be greater at sites with higher
precipitation. While this trend was similar for species richness, we
found
that

4. Discussion
Environmental gradients in ponderosa pine forests are complex.
Ecosystem processes such as net primary production and nitrogen
cycling, are largely driven by the distribution of ponderosa pine
(Hart et al., 2005; Sabo et al., 2008; Laughlin, 2011). A number of
studies have documented ponderosa pines impact on understory
community composition and productivity. In the Black Hills of
South Dakota, Uresk and Severson (1989) found that reductions
in ponderosa pine basal area to 9 m2 ha1 basal area yielded the
greatest production of understory in both pole and sapling stands.
Moore and Deiter (1992) examined the relationship between stand
density index (SDI) and forage production in a ponderosa pine for-
est of northern Arizona and found that understory production
increased linearly up to SDI values of 500. In a western
Montana ponderosa pine/Douglas-ﬁr forest, Metlen and Fiedler
(2006) found a signiﬁcant increase in forb species richness three
years after a restoration treatment that combined thinning and
burning. Ponderosa pine inﬂuences the understory community
directly by altering light availability to the forest ﬂoor, through
belowground competition for soil moisture, and indirectly though
litter fall of recalcitrant needles, decreasing soil pH and altering the
availability of nutrients in the Mineral soil (Riegel et al., 1992;
Naumburg and DeWald, 1999; Kaye et al., 2005; Carr and
Krueger, 2011; Laughlin, 2011). Fire’s role in the biogeochemical
cycle of the herbaceous understory is also important (DeLuca and
Sala, 2006; Boerner et al., 2009).
Fire is a principal factor in the evolution of ponderosa pine for-
ests of the Southwest (Fulé et al., 1997; Moore et al., 1999).
Presettlement structural, compositional, and functional elements
provide evidence of this. As such, restoring these elements is con-
comitant with the reintroduction of the characteristic ﬁre regime.
A major challenge, however, is restoring understory plant commu-
nity integrity through increased cover and richness. From this per-
spective, restoring overstory structural characteristics and the
natural processes under which the system evolved is an integral
component of restoring the understory community (Fulé et al.,
1997; Suding et al., 2004).
Our results support this assertion; at Mineral as well as the
three other restoration sites we studied, understory abundance
and diversity increased within ﬁve years of treatment with a com-
bination of mechanical tree thinning and prescribed burning. In
general Burn-only treatments were not successful in meeting this
objective. Compared to the Untreated, Burn-only treatments at
Mineral were only successful at increasing understory forb rich-
ness,
in
particular
the
number
of
annual–biennial
species.
However, these increases were not as great as those observed in
the Thin + Burn units. Observed increases in Thin + Burn units were
driven almost exclusively by native species, which accounted for
greater than 90% of the average total richness and plant cover.
These ﬁndings suggest that restoration treatments which combine
thinning with prescribed ﬁre can beneﬁt native understory com-
munities. This is an important implication given the increased
interest in applying ecological restoration treatments which
include thinning and burning treatments (Roccaforte et al., 2010).
We found considerable variability across sites in terms of spe-
cies richness. Five years post-treatment both total and native spe-
cies richness had increased in all treatment units at Mineral,
suggesting understory vegetation was responding positively to
changes in precipitation. At Mineral, post treatment total and
native species richness in the Thin + Burn units averaged 46.4
and 42.3, respectively, representing the greatest post-treatment
increase across all four LEARN sites (Fig. 2). Along with our study,
species richness has increased following Thin + Burn treatments at
three of the four LEARN sites. We feel that this provides strong evi-
dence that combining thinning and burning treatments are more
likely than not have a positive inﬂuence on understory plant
diversity.
Increases in species richness at Mineral were driven primarily
by forbs, and it was an increase in annual–biennial forb species
which resulted in signiﬁcant differences between treatments.
Signiﬁcant increases in Burn-only treatments reﬂect the impor-
tance of ﬁre in the life-history of this functional group (Keeley,
1991; Thanos and Rundel, 1995; Abella, 2006). Annual–biennial
species are thought to be an important component of understory
reference conditions due to their favorable response to ﬁre in pon-
derosa pine forests (Crawford et al., 2001; Laughlin et al., 2004;
Fulé et al., 2005). This is difﬁcult to assess, however, from the per-
spective of restoration objectives given the variability in the num-
ber of species associated with this functional group across sites and
years.

(2013) at Mineral relative to the range of variability across three LEARN sites.

Both total and native plant cover responded as expected,
increasing following treatments and were highest in Thin + Burn
units. In contrast to species richness, we found average total plant
cover in the Thin + Burn units consistently increased across all four
LEARN sites. Our ﬁndings also show at Mineral this response was
consistent with average total cover found across the comparison
sites. Furthermore, in this case, there is a reliable range of values
for average total cover in Thin + Burn units which was not attained
by plots in the Untreated or Burn-only units. A greater response of
native cover at Mineral compared to the other LEARN sites can be
attributed to the higher percentage of native species to the overall
community. Differences in plant cover between treatments was
driven primarily by increases in species of forbs and graminoids.
However we did not see a consistent range of responses for these
or any other functional group. Similar to species richness, this
likely reﬂects the variability associated with functional groups
across sites and the individual contribution of each to total cover
and richness.
Abiotic factors associated with climate and soil properties can
strongly constrain the distribution and performance of species in
arid and semi-arid regions of the Southwest (Laughlin and Abella,
2007; Munson, 2013). Determining when these factors can be
expected to inﬂuence understory response to restoration has
important implications for assessing restoration success. Our
results
suggest
that
understory
response
ﬁve
years
post-treatment is site speciﬁc and positively associated with
annual precipitation. As a result, the range of variability associated
with understory responses to restoration should be expected to
expand depending on where treatments are implemented along
this gradient. In addition, cover and richness should not always
be expected to respond positively to restoration ﬁve years
post-treatment. We found that at GV, LNRR richness was negative
whereas LNRR cover was positive, suggesting that as water
becomes more limiting the responses to restoration are more likely
to be mixed. This could simply reﬂect a temporary loss of species
due to the disturbance caused by restoration treatment implemen-
tation, which can lead to undesirable outcomes (Allen et al., 2002).
If so, it suggests that in more arid ponderosa pine forests, restora-
tion related disturbances can be intensiﬁed. Whether a shift from
negative to positive LNRR richness along this precipitation gradient
represents a more general ‘pivot point’ (sensu Munson, 2013) was
beyond the scope of this study.
5. Conclusion
Our results provide important information for land managers
from the perspective of variability in understory response to
restoration in these systems. The LEARN provided a valuable
opportunity to combine data from within an ecological system,
across different sites, to compare and evaluate the consistency of
responses. Our ﬁndings highlight that managers can expect under-
story plant communities to respond positively following restora-
tion
treatments
that
combined
mechanical
thinning
and
prescribed ﬁre. This study highlights how a LEARN can illuminate
general patterns that can inform managers of where treatments
might need to be modiﬁed. For example, unsatisfactory gains in

cover and richness on more mesic sites might indicate further
overstory manipulations are required to create openings and reach
a basal area of 6 m2 ha1, a threshold below which understory
communities have been shown to respond (Sabo et al., 2008).
Additionally this might suggest testing seeding as an additional
treatment, or help managers decide whether grazing should be
reduced or deferred for a period of time (Kerns et al., 2011).
Monitoring following restoration allows us to understand the
range of temporal variability associated with understory vegeta-
tion and to assess restoration objectives. In general, our primary
objective to increase native understory cover and diversity was
met in
Thin + Burn treatments ﬁve
years post-treatment at
Mineral. This study suggests that for understory cover, deﬁning
more speciﬁc goals and objectives to assess restoration success is
realistic. Continued monitoring is necessary to assess whether
these trends are consistent over longer time periods. Indeed, eval-
uating the rate of change for understory cover and richness might
reveal more general patterns than simply looking at a range of
response metrics. Further monitoring at these and other sites will
continue to provide insight into what responses we can expect
from understory plant communities.
