ABSTRACT  
Eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.) was often associated with oaks (Quercus spp.) on upland 
sites in presettlement forests of the upper Great Lakes region, but widespread logging and subse­
quent fires in the late 1800s converted these upland sites to fire-tolerant oak forests. Although white 
pine regeneration is occurring in these second-growth oak forests, white pine regeneration patterns 
in oak forests of the Great Lakes region are not well documented. We examined white pine regener­
ation in the southern Great Lakes region in an oak stand within the Oak Openings region of north­
western Ohio, where white pine plantations established in the 1940s have served as seed sources for 
white pine invasion of surrounding oak-dominated forests. White pine regeneration was aggregated 
in high-density clumps in the oak stand, with a mean white pine to white pine nearest-neighbor dis­
tance of 1.8 m. Eighty-one percent of invading white pine established during a 6-yr interval that cor­
responded with an extended period of below-average annual available water deficits (i.e., conditions 
were more moist than normal). No white pine recruitment has occurred in the oak stand in the last 15 
yr since the 6-yr establishment interval, and we hypothesize that favorable white pine colonization 
sites in the oak stand were occupied during the initial invasion event. White pine regeneration in 
these oak forests may proceed in "leaps and bounds," with white pine expanding 100-300 m 
by clumped regeneration into new areas during unique regeneration events. White pine's present 
ability to reproduce successfully in northwestern Ohio appears related to reductions of historic fire 
frequencies. 
INTRODUCTION 
In presettlement forests of the upper Great Lakes region, eastern white pine 
(Pinus strobus L.) occurred in pure stands (Gevorkiantz & Zon 1930; Potzger 
1946; Whitney 1987), in mixed stands with red pine (P. resinosa Aiton; Harvey 
1922), in mixed northern hardwood stands (Nichols 1935; Brown & Curtis 
1952), and in mixed Quercus stands (Waterman 1922; Maycock 1963; Kur­
czewski 2000). On dry upland sites, white pine commonly occurred with oaks 
(Quercus spp.) as an understory tree or as a canopy dominant (Kittredge & Chit­
tenden 1929; Kenoyer 1933; Davis 1935). White pine distribution and regenera­
tion success in these presettlement Great Lakes forests depended on substrate, 
disturbance regimes, climate, and interspecific competition (Whitney 1986). 
Pure white pine and mixed white pine-red pine stands developed following 
catastrophic disturbances such as fire (Maissurow 1935; Hough & Forbes 1943), 
and white pine in these stands could be self-replacing through regeneration in

canopy gaps (Holla & Knowles 1988; Quinby 1991; Ziegler 1995). In mixed 
northern hardwood forests, white pine regeneration across the landscape was 
controlled by the distribution of large white pine seed trees and by competition 
with hardwoods (Palik & Pregitzer 1994; Saunders & Puettmann 1999). Follow­
ing widespread logging and subsequent fires in the Great Lakes region in the late 
l800s, white pine-oak forests on dry sites were converted to oak forests (Kit­
tredge & Chittenden 1929). Although white pine regeneration is occurring in 
these second-growth oak forests (Elliott 1953; Host et al. 1987; Johnson 1992; 
Carleton et al. 1996), white pine regeneration patterns are not well documented 
in oak forests of the Great Lakes region. 
We examined white pine regeneration in the southern Great Lakes region in 
Oak Openings Preserve within the Oak Openings region of northwestern Ohio. 
Presettlement vegetation in this region was dominated by black oak (Quercus ve­
lutina Lam.) and white oak (Q. alba L.) savannas and woodlands (Sears 1925). 
White pine did not occur in northwestern Ohio at the time of settlement (Mose­
ley 1928), and the Oak Openings region is about 80 km south of the white pine's 
native range in southern Michigan. In the mid-1900s, however, white pine plan­
tations were established throughout Oak Openings Preserve in a matrix of oak 
stands that had undergone succession from savanna or woodland to forest as a 
result of fIre suppression (Abella et al. 2001). These white pine plantations have 
served as seed sources for white pine regeneration in surrounding oak-dominated 
forests. Since white pine did not occur in Oak Openings before it was planted in 
the mid-1900s, we had a unique opportunity to study white pine invasion pat­
terns in an oak-dominated landscape. The objective of this study was to quantify 
the spatial and temporal patterns of white pine invasion of an oak stand to iden­
tify potential white pine regeneration patterns in oak-dominated forests of the 
Great Lakes region. 
METHODS 
The 1496-ha Oak Openings Preserve is in Lucas County, northwestern Ohio. We sampled a 5-ha 
oak-dominated stand (41°33'12'N, 83°50'8"W) in the preserve adjacent to a 0.8-ha white pine plan­
tation. Soils in the oak stand are classified as mixed, mesic Aquic and Typic Udipsamments of the 
Ottokee and Oakville series (Stone et al. 1980). The oak stand originated about 1930, and the white 
pine plantation was created in 1947with trees 3 m apart. In 2001, the plantation contained 43 m2 ha-I 
white pine basal area and had a white pine site index of 29 m at 50 yr. All white pine in the oak stand 
are understory trees and established from seed produced by parent white pine in the plantation once 
they reached reproductive age. 
We sampled white pine regeneration in the oak stand using a stratified-random sampling design 
in March 200 I by dividing the oak stand into six 0.84-ha blocks and randomly locating one circular 
O.I-ha (17.84 m radius) plot in each block. We determined in each plot the species and diameter at 
1.4 m of all live trees greater than I cm diameter. and we aged white pine to the nearest year by 
counting branch whorls (Bormann 1965; Sharik et al. 1989; Palik & Pregitzer 1994). For each of the 
167 white pine occurring in the 6 plots, we measured to the nearest cm the distance to the nearest 
white pine and the distance to the nearest codominant or dominant overstory oak (Avery & Burkhart 
1983). Nearest neighbors that occurred outside of plots were measured to prevent artificially inflat­
ing nearest-neighbor distances for white pine near the outer edges of plots (Clark & Evans 1954; Cot­
tam et al. 1957; Sinclair 1985). Nearest neighbors occurred outside of plots for 7 of 167 white pine 
measured in our study, and we did not use nearest-neighbor trees that occurred outside of plots in 
stand density calculations.

To assess the spatial pattern of white pine regeneration in the oak stand, we computed the Clark­
Evans index (Clark & Evans 1954) using white pine nearest-neighbor distances for each white pine 
in the 6 plots. This index is calculated as the ratio of the actual mean nearest-neighbor distance for 
each individual to the mean nearest-neighbor distance expected if the population was distributed at 
random (Clark & Evans 1954). An index value of 0 indicates a spatial distribution of maximum ag­
gregation of individuals, a value of I indicates a random distribution, and a value of 2.15 indicates a 
uniform distribution. We tested the significance of the departure from randomness with the standard 
variate of the normal curve (Clark & Evans 1954). There has been speculation that the Clark-Evans 
index is biased toward uniform distributions; however, the spatial distribution of white pine in our 
study was computed as significantly aggregated so we used the original Clark-Evans index (Sinclair 
1985). To further assess white pine spatial patterns, we used a two-tailed paired t-test comparing 
white pine nearest-neighbor distances using data pooled for all plots (167 sampled white pine trees) 
to test the null hypothesis that the mean white pine to white pine distance did not differ from the 
mean white pine to overs tory oak distance. Plot means were not used for this analysis because our 
objective was to evaluate stand-level spatial patterns, so we gave equal weight to each white pine 
sampled in the stand. We also used a chi-square test (degrees of freedom = 1) to test the null hy­
pothesis that the proportion of white pine closest to other white pine and the proportion of white pine 
closest to an overstory oak were both 0.5. 
We integrated climatic factors that may affect white pine seed output and seedling survival by es­
timating available water deficits (potential evapotranspiration - actual evapotranspiration) on a 
monthly basis for the period 1955-1994 using the Thornthwaite water balance equation (Mather 
1978). Moisture availability in upper soil layers is most likely to affect white pine seedling estab­
lishment (Smith 1940; Shirley 1945; Thomas & Wein 1985), so we based available water holding ca­
pacity on the upper 50 em of soil. For the water balance calculations, we obtained monthly precipi­
tation and mean monthly temperature data measured at the Toledo Express Airport in Lucas County, 
Ohio, 5 km from our study site, from the National Climatic Data Center Summary of the Day data­
base (Earthinfo, Inc., Boulder, CO). 
RESULTS 
White pine occurred as an understory tree beneath an overstory dominated by 
several oak species (Table 1, Fig. 1). Inaddition to white pine, white oak and red 
maple (Acer rubrum L.) were abundant in the understory. The Clark-Evans index 
was < 1 and indicated that the spatial distribution of invading white pine was sig­
nificantly clumped in the oak stand, and the mean white pine to white pine dis­
tance was less than the mean white pine to overstory oak distance (Table 2). Of 
167 white pine sampled, 72% occurred closer to other white pine than to an

overstory oak; this proportion differed significantly from 0.5 (Table 2). Mean 
age of invading white pine in the oak stand at the time of sampling in 2001 was 
20.5 yr (standard error = 0.2). White pine invasion of the oak stand began in 
1974 when the parent white pine in the plantation were age 27 yr, and 81% of the 
invading white pine established in the oak stand between 1977 and 1982 (Fig. 2). 
This establishment interval corresponded with an extended period of below av­

DISCUSSION" 
Aggregation of white pine regeneration in high-density clumps suggests cer­
tain areas in the oak stand were optimal for white pine establishment, although 
these areas have no known history of disturbance. These optimal zones for white 
pine regeneration may result from favorable light conditions, favorable seedbeds 
free from understory competition, or optimal seedbed moisture conditions (Cor­
nett et al. 1998). Peterson and Squiers (1995a, b) also found that white pine re­
generated in clumps in a bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata Michx.) forest 
in northern Michigan, and these clumps were distributed away from overstory 
aspen. Hibbs (1982) hypothesized that white pine saplings may reach the over­
story in dense hardwood stands of New England through group reproduction 
where a clump of white pine saplings serves as a buffer from hardwood compe­

tition around a central white pine. White pine regeneration was also aggregated 
in pure white pine stands in Ontario (Quinby 1991) and New England (Yeaton 
1978). These studies combined with our results suggest that white pine com­
monly regenerate in clumps in a variety of forest types including oak-dominated 
forests of the Great Lakes region. 
Clumps of regenerating white pine occurred in the oak stand as far as 
200-300 m away from the parent white pine in the plantation. These distances 
are further than those reported by Palik & Pregitzer (1994), who found that little 
or no white pine regeneration occurred greater than 100-140 m from large white 
pine seed trees in an aspen forest in northern Michigan. White pine seed is pri­
marily wind dispersed (Bums & Honkala 1990), and the greater dispersal dis­
tances we recorded likely result from the open vertical structure of the oak stand 
that facilitated white pine seed dispersal. Small mammals can also disperse 
white pine seeds by caching (Bums & Honkala 1990), but it is unlikely that seed 
caches were the primary dispersal mechanism for white pine seed in the oak 
stand because most seed caches are eaten in a given year (Smith 1940; Abbott & 
Quink 1970; Cornett et a1. 1998). The distance seeds traveled in the oak stand 
from the parent trees in the plantation and the large number of white pine estab­
lishing during a narrow time frame are consistent with wind dispersal of seed for 
white pine colonization of this oak stand. 
White pine began establishing in the oak stand when the parent white pine in 
the plantation were age 27 yr, and 81% of white pine regeneration in the oak 
stand occurred during a 6-yr period. Our results are similar to those of Sharik et 
a1. (1989) in hardwood forests of lower Michigan, who found that residual white 
pine following catastrophic fire were age 26-37 yr when the first post-fire white 
pine seedlings originated. White pine invasion of the oak stand in our study cor­
responded with a 5-yr period of below average available water deficits, indicat­
ing that moisture stress was low during white pine seedling establishment. The 
onset of seed production by plantation white pine, corresponding with a climatic 
period favorable for white pine seedling survival, created optimal conditions for 
white pine regeneration during their establishment interval in the oak stand 
(Bums and Honkala 1990). 
Aggregation of white pine regeneration, the narrow time span of invasion, 
and the lack of subsequent recruitment suggest that white pine invasion of the 
oak stand was a discrete event. This invasion event was facilitated by initial seed 
produced by the parent white pine in the plantation, favorable white pine regen­
eration sites available in the oak stand, and favorable climatic conditions for 
white pine seedling survival. Lack of subsequent white pine recruitment in the 
oak stand since 1985 is probably not due to a lack of seed because good white 
pine seed years generally occur every 3-5 yr (Bums & Honkala, 1990). Climatic 
conditions characterized by low available water deficits, similar to those during 
the initial invasion event, also have occurred since 1985 but did not correspond 
with further white pine regeneration in the oak stand. 
Our results suggest that most of the favorable white pine colonization sites in 
the oak stand were occupied during the initial invasion event, and intraspecific 
competition with established white pine clumps occupying favorable regenera­
tion sites in the oak stand has inhibited subsequent recruitment. Several estab­

lished white pine in the oak stand, however, are currently growing greater than 
0.5-1 m yr1 and will eventually reach the overstory (Hibbs 1982). These white 
pine are nearing reproductive age with a mean age of 20.5 yr and will begin to 
produce seed that may initiate white pine invasion of other adjacent oak stands. 
White pine regeneration in these oak forests may proceed in "leaps and bounds," 
with white pine expanding 100-300 m by clumped regeneration into new areas 
during unique regeneration events following the onset of seed production by ma­
turing trees. 
Although white pine did not occur in the Oak Openings region at the time of 
settlement, its present ability to reproduce successfully in northwestern Ohio ap­
pears to be related to human alteration of historic disturbance regimes. Moseley 
(1928) noted that the complete absence of conifers in the Oak Openings region 
was "peculiar," and the sandy soils of Oak Openings are similar to those in lower 
Michigan where white pine was abundant in presettlement forests (Waterman 
1922; McCool & Veatch 1924;Veatch 1928).Before settlement, oak savanna and 
woodlands in the Oak Openings region burned frequently and intensely (Bourne 
1820), and small white pine cannot survive frequent fire (Kittredge & Chitten­
den 1929; Burns & Honkala 1990). Following logging in Michigan in the late 
1800s, for example, intense fires scorched upland areas formerly dominated by 
white pine, eliminating regenerating pine and favoring fire-tolerant oaks (Beal 
1888, 1902; Kittredge & Chittenden 1929). Similar burning regimes occurred 
historically in the Oak Openings region (Bourne 1820; Moseley 1928), and 
white pine's present ability to reproduce successfully in northwestern Ohio 
likely results from human suppression of the presettlement fire regimes that 
white pine could not have survived.

THE MICHIGAN BOTANIST 
Vol. 41 
OBITUARY 
Howard A. Crum (1922-2002) 
The Great Lakes botanical community lost a highly regarded colleague with 
the passing of Dr. Howard Crum on 30 April 2002. Virtually anyone who stud­
ied mosses, lichens, or peatlands in the Great Lakes region has probably come in 
contact with Dr, Crum, either in person, in the classroom or the field, or from 
reading one of his many articles and books. Members of the Botanical Club may 
also remember Howard as the second editor of The Michigan Botanist, taking 
over the reins from Dr. Edward Voss in 1977 and continuing until 30 April 1984. 
Howard received his B.S. from Western Michigan University in 1947, com­
pleting his graduate degrees at the University of Michigan (M.S. in 1949, Ph.D. 
in 1951). His "Michigan connection" resumed when he returned to the Univer­
sity of Michigan in 1965 as an Associate Professor of Botany and Curator of 
Bryophytes at the UM Herbarium. Over the next 35+ years, he did many things 
to both advance our knowledge of the bryophytes of our area as well as impart 
this knowledge to others. Howard taught courses about mosses, lichens, and 
peatland ecology both on the main campus in Ann Arbor and at the Biological 
Station at Pellston, continuing to spend summers there after his official retire­
ment as Curator Emeritus in 1995. While much of his research dealt with the 
classification and distribution of the genus Sphagnum (peat mosses), he also 
ranged more broadly among the bryophytes of the Great Lakes region. His book 
Mosses of the Great Lakes Forest, a definitive work which first appeared in 
1973, is still used as a text in several college classes. Howard was working on a 
fourth revision of the work at the time of his passing. The other volumes that 
Howard wrote which involve Great Lakes subjects are his Liverworts and Horn­
worts of Southern Michigan (1991) and A Focus on Peatlands and Peat Mosses 
(1988). 
While I have just touched on a few of the highlights of his career, readers who 
would like to read an extensive account of his life and a bibliography (to 1992) 
should consult the following article: Anderson, L.E. 1992. A tribute to Howard 
Crum. Contributions from the University of Michigan Herbarium 18: 3-38. This 
article was written by one of Howard's colleagues as an introduction to a collec­
tion of papers assembled as a celebration of Howard's 70th birthday.
