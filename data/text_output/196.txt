Abstract
 Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) is a key deciduous species in southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus ponde-
rosa) forests and is important for wildlife habitat, soil processes, and human values. This report (1) summarizes 
Gambel oak’s biological characteristics and importance in ponderosa pine forests, (2) synthesizes literature on 
changes in tree densities and fire frequencies since Euro-American settlement in pine-oak forests, (3) suggests 
management prescriptions for accomplishing various oak management objectives (for example, increasing 
diameter growth or acorn production), and (4) provides an appendix containing 203 Gambel oak literature 
citations organized by subject. Nine studies that reconstructed Gambel oak density changes since settlement 
in the late 1800s reported that densities of small oaks have escalated, with increases ranging from 4- to more 
than 63-fold. A possible argument for passive oak management, that overall oak abundance has decreased, is 
not supported by published research. Manipulating oak growth forms is one of the main means for managing 
oak and ecosystem components affected by oak. Published research has classified variants of three basic oak 
growth forms: shrubby thickets of small stems, pole-sized clumps, and large trees. Burning and cutting con-
stitute major prescriptions for manipulating these growth forms, whereas pine thinning has most consistently 
increased oak diameter growth for promoting large oaks. Because of their high ecological value, large, old oaks 
should be retained in any management prescription. Sufficient research has been published on which to base 
some oak management prescriptions, but additional research on poorly understood aspects of oak’s ecology is 
needed to refine and improve oak management. 
Key words: Pinus ponderosa, Quercus gambelii, thinning, management, ecological restoration, wildlife-habitat 
relationships

Introduction ____________________
 Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) frequently is the only 
deciduous tree in otherwise pure southwestern ponde-
rosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests, adding diversity 
to these forests (Reynolds and others 1970, Rosenstock 
1998). Gambel oak and its management are important 
in ponderosa pine forests because oak influences soils, 
understory vegetation, wildlife, and human values 
(Clary and Tiedemann 1992, Harper and others 1985, 
 Klemmedson 1987). Similar to pure ponderosa pine for-
ests, fire exclusion, wood harvesting, livestock grazing, 
and other factors have altered pine-Gambel oak forests 
since Euro-American settlement in the late 1800s (Fulé 
and others 1997, Madany and West 1983). These factors 
are thought to have resulted in declines in native plant 
communities, ecosystem simplification, inferior habitat 
for some wildlife species, and susceptibility to intense 
wildfires (Covington and Moore 1994, Wightman and 
Germaine 2006). Currently, much attention is given 
to managing ponderosa pine forests to reverse these 
deleterious changes, principally through mechanical 
pine thinning and prescribed burning. Less attention, 
however, is given to managing Gambel oak (Brischler 
2002). Research published to date suggests that Gambel 
oak can and should be actively managed on some sites 
(Clary and Tiedemann 1992). Manipulating oak densities, 
growth forms, and diameter growth can improve wildlife 
habitat, understory communities, and other ecosystem 
values in pine-oak forests (Kruse 1992).
 This report summarizes Gambel oak’s biological 
characteristics, importance in ponderosa pine forests, 
evolutionary environment and changes since settlement, 
responses to fire and mechanical thinning, and strategies 
for accomplishing specific oak management objectives 
(for example, increasing diameter growth). This report 
is not intended to be an exhaustive review of oak’s 
ecology or wildlife relationships. Readers are referred 
to a bibliography in the report appendix for literature 
detailing specific Gambel oak ecological characteristics 
and associations with wildlife. Focus is on summarizing 
our current knowledge about oak management in pon-
derosa pine forests to assist practitioners in developing

 management prescriptions and to highlight areas requiring 
additional research. Although many unknowns remain, 
sufficient published data exist on which to base some 
management prescriptions for Gambel oak. Testing of 
these prescriptions in a variety of applied management 
and research settings is encouraged to refine and improve 
the prescriptions.
Biological Characteristics ________
Distribution
 Gambel oak occurs with ponderosa pine in Arizona, 
New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, and small portions of 
southeastern Nevada and southwestern Texas (fig. 1). 
Gambel oak grows primarily as an understory or mid-
story tree in the southern half of its range in Arizona and 
New Mexico, while shorter shrub forms predominate 
in shrublands in the northern part of its range in Utah 
and Colorado (Brown 1958, Harper and others 1985).

also occur in southwestern Texas. After Clary and Tiedemann 
(1992), modified from Little (1971).

The species occupies a variety of soil parent materials 
including basalt, benmoreite, limestone, sandstone, shale, 
granite, and volcanic cinders (Hanks and others 1983, 
Humphries and Bourgeron 2003, Muldavin and others 
1990). While habitat affinities can change regionally and 
with elevation, Gambel oak in Arizona and New Mexico 
ponderosa pine forests occupies a range of aspects and 
topography including canyons, small drainages, flat 
plains, and cinder cones (Hanks and others 1983). Oak 
inhabits rocky and non-rocky sites (Hanks and others 
1983, Neilson and Wullstein 1986).
Regeneration
 Gambel oak is a clonal species and a member of the 
white oak group (Harper and others 1985). The species 
regenerates naturally from both seed and sprouts. Sopp 
and others (1977) reported high germination percentages 
for fall-collected acorns from Colorado (fig. 2). More 
than 90 percent of untreated acorns or acorns treated with 
14 to 28 days of cool-moist stratification germinated. 
Oak seedling establishment from acorns appears more 
prevalent in pine forests than in the northern areas of 
oak’s range where the species forms shrublands. At 15 
pine-oak sites in Arizona and New Mexico, for example, 
Neilson and Wullstein (1986) found that oak seedling 
densities ranged from 49 to 534/acre (120 to 1,320/ha). 
These authors differentiated seedlings from sprouts by 
excavating roots or observing the presence or absence 
of spent acorns. Forty-one percent of the seedlings es-
tablished on northeastern sides of sheltering objects (for 
example, rocks or shrubs), compared to only 14 percent 
on southwestern sides. These northeastern microhabitats 
are cooler and moister (Neilson and Wullstein 1986). 
In an outplanting experiment using first-year seedlings 
from northern Utah seed sources, short-term (< 2 years) 
seedling survival exceeded 50 percent at two sites in 
Arizona and New Mexico (Neilson and Wullstein 1983). 
Major sources of mortality identified by these authors 
included spring freezing, summer drought, and grazing. 
Mortality rates due to other factors (for example, fire) 
remain unclear for naturally established seedlings in 
ponderosa pine forests.
 It is well documented that Gambel oak vigorously 
resprouts from extensive root systems after disturbances 
such as cutting, grazing, or intense fire kill stems  (Ffolliott 
and Gottfried 1991, Kunzler and Harper 1980, Tiedemann 
and others 1987). These disturbances likely result in 
sharp increases in densities of small-diameter oak stems. 
Disturbances that are especially severe (for example, 
overstory clearcutting or wildfire) may result in the 
development of persistent oak brushfields (Ffolliott 
and Gottfried 1991, Savage and Mast 2005). However, 
it remains unclear if resprouting ability changes as oak 
clones age, which is important to clarify in future research 
(Clary and Tiedemann 1992).
Growth and Longevity
 Gambel oak diameter growth is generally slow relative 
to ponderosa pine. Based on 134 sample trees in central 
Arizona, Barger and Ffolliott (1972) provided estimates 
of average diameter growth for oaks that ranged in diam-
eter from 2 to 36 inches (5 to 91 cm). Average diameter 
growth of trees by diameter class was as follows: 2-inch 
(5-cm) trees = 0.062 inches/yr (0.16 cm/yr), 10-inch 
(25-cm) trees = 0.058 inches/yr (0.15 cm/yr), 20-inch 
(51-cm) trees = 0.054 inches/yr (0.14 cm/yr), and 36-inch 
(91-cm) trees = 0.049 inches/yr (0.12 cm/yr).
 Regressions of oak diameter and age, developed from 
three sites in northern Arizona, indicate that diameter 
explained between 82 and 89 percent of the variation in 
age based on non-linear equations (fig. 3). Table 1 shows 
Figure 2—Emergence (≈ germination) and contamination 
of Gambel oak acorns collected in Colorado after various 
durations of cool, moist stratification. Emergence declined, 
while contamination (by mold and other damaging agents) 
increased, after 28 days of stratification. Data from Sopp and 
others (1977).

Figure 3—Relationship of age with diameter at breast height of Gambel oak at 
three sites in northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests. Ages do not account for 
time required to reach the coring height of 16 inches (40 cm), which may require 
more than 17 years (Neilson and Wullstein 1986). Linear equations are given 
along with equations exhibiting the highest r2. Numbers of trees included in the 
regressions are as follows: (a) = 187, (b) = 195, and (c) = 411. Data provided by 
the Ecological Restoration Institute, Flagstaff, AZ, associated with the following 
published studies: (a) = Fulé and others (1997), (b) = Fulé and others (2005), and 
(c) = Waltz and others (2003).

predicted ages of oaks of various diameters based on 
these equations. While there is variability both within 
and among sites, oaks greater than 10 inches (25 cm) 
in diameter in this area generally became established 
before Euro-American settlement in the late 1800s. Little 
is known about how oak growth rates may vary on dif-
ferent soil types or in different regions. In the Lincoln 
National Forest in southern New Mexico, Ryniker and 
others (2006) also found that Gambel oak diameter was 
correlated (r2 = 0.81) with age based on measurements 
of 28 trees ranging in diameter from 1 to 7 inches (2 to 
17 cm).
 Individual stems can be long-lived, and clones can be 
older than the oldest existing stem. In their compilation 
of oldest known trees in the Southwest, Swetnam and 
Brown (1992) listed a Gambel oak individual stem that 
was 401 years old on the Beaver Creek watershed in 
north-central Arizona.
Growth Forms
 Several authors have classified Gambel oak growth 
forms based on various tree and clump characteristics 
(table 2). These classifications have generally recognized 
variants of three basic growth forms: shrubby thickets 
of small stems, clumps of intermediate-sized stems, 
and large, mature trees (fig. 4). The classifications were 
developed for different purposes and emphasize differ-
ent aspects of oak ecology (Abella 2008). For example, 
Kruse’s (1992) classification emphasizes a perceived 
successional process whereby oak clumps begin as 
brushy thickets, then self-thin to produce large, mature 
trees. His classification was designed to quantify wildlife 
habitat, with each growth form providing unique cover, 
browse, mast, and cavity attributes. These growth forms 
illustrate ecological and management tradeoffs. For ex-
ample, shrubby oaks provide browse and cover near the

ground but produce few acorns, while larger oaks sup-
ply more acorns but offer little ground-level browse or 
cover (Kruse 1992, McCulloch and others 1965). While 
not all oaks encountered in the field readily fit into a 
classification scheme, these existing classifications may 
be useful for understanding oak ecology, inventorying 
sites and measuring habitat quality, and developing and 
monitoring management treatments.
Fire Ecology
 Although pine-oak forests typically historically burned 
more frequently than every 15 years (for example, 
Grissino-Mayer and others 2004), Brown and Smith 
(2000) report that Gambel oak has low fire resistance at 
maturity and at any size. According to Simonin (2000), 
Gambel oak bark ranges from 0.5 to 0.75 inches (1.2 to 
1.9 cm) thick, categorized by Brown and Smith (2000) 
as “thin.” No information was provided, however, as to 
whether bark thickness increases as oak ages. Neverthe-
less, large oaks may have had some capacity to survive 
low-intensity presettlement fires (Abella and Fulé 2008a). 
Rocky microsites or other areas oak sometimes occupies 
also may have burned less frequently than surrounding 
areas, but oak also occupies relatively uniform sites with 
few barriers to fire spread (Hanks and others 1983). 
Looser, less resinous, and moister oak litter (compared 
to pine litter) may have burned less intensively near oak 
boles, allowing large oaks to persevere (Abella and Fulé 
2008a). In addition to some ability of large stems to survive 
low-intensity fire, oaks top-killed by fire often resprout 
(Kunzler and Harper 1980). Following Rowe’s (1983) 
classification of plant adaptations to fire, Gambel oak is 
thus both a resister (by survival of some large oaks) and 
an endurer (by resprouting) of fire. Estimates of survival 
following prescribed burning and suggestions for increas-
ing survival during burns are given in the Prescribed 
Burning section of the Management Objectives part of 
this report.
Importance in Ponderosa  
Pine Forests ____________________
Effects on Soils
 Relative to ponderosa pine, increasing oak basal area 
coincided with increased concentrations of several nutri-
ents (C, N, P, S, Ca, Mg, and K) in basalt soils in northern 
Arizona pine-oak forests (Klemmedson 1987, 1991). Oak 
likely enhanced nutrient concentrations relative to pine 
partly by producing leaves containing more concentrated 
Figure 4—Gambel oak occurs as gradations of three basic 
growth forms in ponderosa pine forests: (a) single trees, 
(b) clumps, and (c) dense thickets. These basic growth forms 
have been identified by various authors (table 2). Photos by

nutrients (table 3). Nitrogen and Ca, for example, were 
more than twice as concentrated in oak leaves as in pine 
needles (Klemmedson 1987). Klemmedson (1987) also 
found that oak increased upper O horizon pH relative to 
pine but did not affect mineral soil pH. In greenhouse 
experiments using 0- to 6-inch (0- to 15-cm) mineral soil 
collected from stands with varying proportions of oak, 
Klemmedson (1991) found that barley (Hordeum vulgare) 
yields from soils with 50 percent oak were three times 
greater than those with no oak. Pine seedling biomass also 
was greater in soils collected from stands with high oak 
basal area. These studies suggest that oak is important 
in soil nutrient cycling, and increasing concentrations of 
soil nutrients can be expected with increasing oak relative 
to pine.
Effects on Understory Vegetation
 Soil properties, light, and other environmental vari-
ables differ below Gambel oak canopies compared to 
below ponderosa pine or openings (Abella, In prep; Brown 
1958; Madany and West 1984). Several studies have found 
that environments below oak support plant communities 
differing from those below other canopy types (Brown 
1958, Evenson and others 1980, Madany and West 
1984). In Colorado, for example, Brown (1958) found 
that elk sedge (Carex geyeri) biomass averaged 204 lbs/acre 
(229 kg/ha) below oak compared to only 25 lbs/acre 
(28 kg/ha) in openings. In southern Utah, Evenson and 
others (1980) also found that elk sedge, in addition to 
tuber starwort (Pseudostellaria jamesiana), was more 
abundant below oak than in openings. In northern Ari-
zona pine-oak forests, numerous species differentiated 
along a tree canopy gradient including openings, three 
types of oak canopies, and ponderosa pine (Abella and 
Springer 2008; fig. 5). For example, the warm-season 
grass pine dropseed (Blepharoneuron tricholepis) oc-
curred in openings and below single oaks, but declined 
in frequency below denser oak and pine canopies. Aspen 
pea (Lathyrus laetivirens), in contrast, was most frequent 
below dense oak thickets. These data suggest that plant 
community composition differs below oak compared to 
other canopy types and varies among oak growth forms 
as well.

Competition With Pine
 Biondi and others (1992) noted that overstory pon-
derosa pine do not compete with the shorter Gambel 
oak for light, and any competition between the species 
would probably be for soil moisture, nutrients, and 
growing space. Gambel oak’s extensive root system 
does uptake copious moisture (Tew 1967), and oak ap-
pears more drought-tolerant than ponderosa pine (Kolb 
and Stone 2000). In northern  Arizona pine-oak forests, 
Biondi and others (1992) concluded that pine-pine com-
petition slowed pine diameter growth more than oak-
pine competition. This may have resulted from oak’s 
positive influence on soil nutrients or pine’s increased 
spacing in the presence of oak (Biondi and others 1992). 
Some authors have suggested that oak and its effects 
on soils and microclimates may promote pine seedling 
establishment (Floyd 1982). Other authors have sug-
gested the opposite because of possible allelopathic 
effects of oak leaves on pine germination (Harrington 
1987). Several studies suggest that oak proliferation 
after severe disturbance, such as wildfire or clearcut-
ting, may contribute to delays in pine reestablishment 
(for example, Ffolliott and Gottfried 1991, Savage 
and Mast 2005). However, these post-disturbance oak 
shrublands contribute wildlife habitat and other values 
(Ffolliott and Gottfried 1991). Research published to 
date suggests that pine-pine competition may be more 
intense than oak-pine competition (Biondi and others 
1992); pine-oak competition may slow oak growth 
particularly for older stems (Onkonburi 1999); and 
competitive relationships between pine and oak may 
depend on oak growth form and age (for example, 
sprouts versus old stems; Tew 1967).
Wildlife Habitat
 Gambel oak influences wildlife habitat by providing 
cover, acorns and foliage for food, feeding surfaces for 
insects and associated predators, cavities and surfaces 
for cavity excavation, and by affecting other ecosystem 
components such as soils, microclimates, and inverte-
brates (Harper and others 1985, Leidolf and others 2000, 
Reynolds and others 1970). In Gambel oak shrublands 
in Utah, for example, Hayward (1948) found that inver-
tebrate density was six times higher in soils below oak 
than in open areas. In a northern Arizona study of breed-
ing birds, Rosenstock (1998) reported that overall bird 
diversity and species richness of Neotropical migrants, 
ground nesters, primary cavity excavators, and secondary 
cavity users were higher in pine-oak than in pure ponderosa 
pine forests. Of 42 total species detected, 10, including 
red-faced warblers (Cardellina rubrifrons), house wrens 
(Troglodytes aedon), and downy woodpeckers (Picoides 
pubescens), were most common in forests containing 
oak (Rosenstock 1998). An important conclusion from 
wildlife studies is that different growth forms, diameters, 
and heights of oak provide different habitat for wildlife 
species (Kruse 1992, Lesh 1999, Rosenstock 1998). Spe-
cies may respond positively, negatively, or neutrally to 
the presence or absence of oak, and responses for some 
species may change with oak growth forms (Neff and 
others 1979).
Human Values
 Humans benefit from oak’s positive effects on ecosys-
tem components, such as wildlife habitat and soil ecology 
(Klemmedson 1987, Neff and others 1979). Humans also 
value oak aesthetically and for consumptive uses such 
as for fuelwood (Harper and others 1985). Gambel oak 
constitutes a particularly important fuelwood, with heat 
contents that are 24 percent greater than Utah juniper 
(Juniperus osteosperma) and 43 percent greater than 
ponderosa pine (Barger and Ffolliott 1972).
Evolutionary Environment ________
 The habitat conditions in which Gambel oak evolved 
provide an ecological basis for management. With 
the exception of Madany and West’s (1983) study of 
isolated mesas in Utah, fire-history studies have found 
that surface fires burned ponderosa pine-Gambel oak 
forests on average at least once every ≤ 13 years prior 
to postsettlement fire exclusion (table 4). At a northern 
Arizona pine-oak site, Fulé and others (1997) estimated 
that 40 percent of historical fires occurred in spring (late 
April to June) and 60 percent in summer (July to early 
September). Lightning is thought to have provided suf-
ficient ignitions to support the frequent-fire regime of 
pine-oak forests, although human ignitions may have 
augmented lightning ignitions. Research published to 
date suggests that frequent, spring-summer fires have 
long been part of Gambel oak’s evolutionary environment 
in southwestern pine-oak forests. These fires promoted 
open stands for both pine and oak, top-killed small stems, 
and stimulated resprouting (Fulé and others 1997, Waltz 
and others 2003).
 Tree-density reconstruction studies have found that 
Gambel oak densities in presettlement pine-oak forests 
were generally less than 40 trees/acre (99/ha; table 5). 
However, higher densities of small sprouts may have 
 occurred but could be difficult for contemporary recon-
struction studies to detect because of decomposition.

Forest reconstruction methods have been found to be 
reliable to within 10 percent for ponderosa pine tree 
density (Moore and others 2004), but accuracy is less 
well-known for Gambel oak. However, in a study of the 
longevity of oak fence posts (90 percent of which were 
less than 7 inches [18 cm] in diameter), Long (1941) 
found that oak posts could persist for more than 60 years 
(the oldest posts examined).
Current Conditions ______________
 Nine tree density reconstruction studies in pine-oak 
forests found that overall Gambel oak densities have 
sharply increased since fire exclusion and Euro-American 
settlement in the late 1800s (table 5). These increases 
primarily result from increases in small- and medium-
sized stems (fig. 6). Oak density increases parallel widely 
observed increases in ponderosa pine densities (Abella 

9
USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-218. 2008
and Fulé 2008b, Covington and Moore 1994, Fulé and 
others 1997). The data are not consistent with suggestions 
in Rosenstock (1998) that oak abundance has declined 
since settlement. The increase in density that oak has 
exhibited is a common response in woody species fol-
lowing exclusion of fire (Van Auken 2000). Harper and 
others (1985) also noted that tolerance to defoliation and 
relatively low palatability for livestock may partly explain 
why oak has increased in abundance in many parts of its 
range in the past century.
 It is less clear whether densities of large oaks have 
decreased because of fuelwood harvest or other factors. 
Diameter distributions in a northern Arizona pine-oak 
forest, however, suggest that densities of oaks greater 
than 10 inches (25 cm) in diameter have actually in-
creased slightly since 1883 (fig. 6). In seven stands 
on the Coconino National Forest in northern Arizona, 
Brischler (2002) found that oak stump densities aver-
aged 13/acre (33/ha). However, more than 70 percent 
of these stumps were less than 8 inches (20 cm) in 
diameter, consistent with the high proportion of live 
stems and snags in these size classes (fig. 7). Brischler 
(2002) hypothesized that harvesting was greater for 
small- to medium-sized (4- to 8-inch [10- to 20-cm] 
diameter) oaks than for large oaks, possibly because 
smaller oaks were more available, easier to cut and 
remove, less likely to be hollow from heart rot, or less 
apt to be noticed after unauthorized cutting. Branches 
may be more commonly cut from especially large oaks 
than the main stems themselves (S.R. Abella, personal 
observation). Nevertheless, past oak cutting varied 
across the landscape, making generalizations difficult 
about possible reductions in large oaks (Brischler 2002). 
Evidence has not been published to date, though, that 
indicates that densities of large oaks on average have 
decreased, certainly not to the extent that densities of 
large ponderosa pine have diminished due to harvesting 
(Covington and Moore 1994). However, consideration 
should be given to conserving existing large oaks because 
of their high ecological value and old age (Harper and 
others 1985, Reynolds and others 1970).
 In addition to small-diameter oak density increases, 
surface fires have been excluded from most pine-oak 
forests since settlement (Baisan and Swetnam 1990, Fulé 
and others 2003b, Grissino-Mayer and others 2004). 
Fire exclusion has contributed to fuel buildups and also 
possibly to understory compositional changes (Laughlin 
and others 2005). Large, old oaks may be experiencing 
intense competition from younger, postsettlement stems 
of both pine and oak. Such competition slows growth 
and accelerates mortality of old ponderosa pine (Wallin 
and others 2004) and may have similar effects on old 
oaks. Grazing patterns on oak also may have changed, 
although specifics have not been studied. In summary, 
oak exists in a current environment much different from 
the species’ evolutionary environment of open stands and 
frequent fire. There is no general ecological basis for 
not actively managing oak and pine-oak sites to initiate 
trajectories to within a range of variability characterizing 
oak’s evolutionary environment. Specific management 
objectives, however, may make passive management 
most appropriate and practical on many sites.

Management Objectives __________
 The following sections provide summaries of our 
current knowledge of suggested prescriptions for ac-
complishing specific oak management objectives. It 
is important to first define management objectives, or 
desired future conditions, and match prescriptions to 
those objectives or desired conditions. A holistic oak 
management strategy could include multiple objectives 
and prescriptions, recognizing ecosystem-level tradeoffs 
of various prescriptions.
Prescribed Burning
 Prescribed burning can be used to manipulate oak 
directly (for example, to change stem density) or to 
meet other management objectives, such as fuel reduc-
tion. Using data from two northern Arizona pine-oak sites 
(Fulé and others 2005, Roccaforte 2005), Abella and 
Fulé (2008a) found that oak survival was diameter-
specific 5 years  after fall or spring prescribed burning 
(fig. 8). Survival of oaks greater than 6 inches (15 cm) 
in  diameter exceeded 66 percent at both sites, while 
survival was low (11 to 20 percent) for small stems 
less than 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter. Survival may 
vary depending on operational aspects of burns, such 
as burn timing or whether oak clumps are deliberately 
lit (Ken Moore, Bureau of Land Management, personal 
communication 2005). Nonetheless, these data support 
the findings of Fulé and others (2005) that large oaks 
can be maintained during burns and are consistent with 
oak’s persistence in frequent-fire presettlement forests 
(table 4).
 Abella and Fulé (2008a) offered the following sug-
gestions for helping to maintain large oaks during pre-
scribed burning: (1) reduce fire intensity near oak boles 
or avoid deliberately lighting near oaks, (2) keep pine 
slash away from oaks to be retained, and (3) rake exces-
sive fuel (particularly pine litter) away from the bases 
of oak boles. Contemporary fuel loads are greater than 
in pre-fire exclusion pine-oak forests, so raking fuel is 
a conservative measure that may increase oak survival. 
Effects of raking have not been measured, however.
 Timing and frequency of burning can influence oak’s 
resprouting ability as well as competition from other 
species. Harrington (1985, 1989) examined effects of 
burn timing (June, August, or October) and frequency 
(one or two burns in a 4-year period) on Gambel oak in 
a Colorado pine-oak stand. He found that after 4 years, 
all burn treatments increased densities of sprouts rela-
tive to unburned controls because of prolific sprouting 
of top-killed, small-diameter stems. A second burn in 
summer, however, resulted in the least sprouting because 
oak carbohydrate reserves to incite sprouting were lowest 
at that time. Nevertheless, burning in any season appears 
to kill small stems and stimulate shrub-like sprouting 
(Harrington 1985).  
Increase Diameter Growth
 Increasing oak growth rates may be an objective to 
encourage development of large oaks for wildlife and 
other values. By retrospectively examining seven pine-
oak sites in northern Arizona that had been previously 
treated, Onkonburi (1999) found that ponderosa pine 
thinning resulted in the largest increase in oak diameter 
growth compared to oak thinning or prescribed burning 
(fig. 9). In an ecological restoration experiment near the 
south rim of the Grand Canyon, oak diameter growth also 
tended to be greater in areas where pine had been thinned 
relative to burn-only and control treatments (Fulé and 
others 2005). Increases in oak growth after pine thinning 
may be proportional to oak size or age and also to the 
Figure 8—Survival of different sized Gambel oak stems 5 
years after prescribed burning at two northern Arizona sites in 
ponderosa pine-oak forests. Survival exceeded 66 percent for 
stems greater than 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter, while survival 
was low for smaller stems. Numbers at the top of each bar 
represent the actual number of stems in each category. The 
(a) Mt. Trumbull study site is on the Arizona strip and managed 
by the Bureau of Land Management (Roccaforte 2005) and the 
(b) Grandview site is near the south rim of the Grand Canyon 
in the Kaibab National Forest (Fulé and others 2005).

amount of pine basal area removed, but these relation-
ships have not been quantified. Variable and sometimes 
reduced oak growth after prescribed burning found by 
Onkonburi (1999) and Fulé and others (2005) could result 
from damage sustained during burns, energy allocation 
to resprouting rather than to growth of residual stems, 
or other factors.
 Mechanically thinning oaks from below within oak 
clumps produced a slight increase in growth of large 
residual oaks (> 4 inches [10 cm] in diameter), but 
Onkonburi (1999) cautioned that findings were based on 
only one site and require more extensive testing (fig. 9). 
Accurately predicting effects of mechanically thinning 
oak clumps is difficult for a clonal, resprouting species 
like Gambel oak because responses of residual stems may 
depend on energy allocated to resprouting, age of the 
clone at the time of thinning, thinning intensity, or other 
factors (Clary and Tiedemann 1986, Lowell and others 
1989, Touchan and Ffolliott 1999). Onkonburi’s (1999) 
Gambel oak thinning study and data from oaks in other 
regions (for example, Lowell and others 1989, Shipek 
and others 2004) suggest that thinning oak clumps will 
not reduce growth of residual stems, but gains in diameter 
increment may not be large.
 In summary, pine thinning likely produces the largest 
and most persistent enhancement of oak diameter growth 
compared to oak thinning or prescribed burning (Biondi 
and others 1992, Fulé and others 2005, Onkonburi 1999). 
Nitrogen fertilization often increases ponderosa pine 
growth (Youngberg 1975), but has not been tested with 
Gambel oak and it remains unclear if any gains would be 
worth the expenditure. More clearly articulating effects 
of pine and oak thinning, prescribed burning, and other 
treatments (for example, fertilization) on oak diameter 
growth is a key research need.
Change Density
 Decreasing densities of small oak stems might be de-
sired to return currently elevated oak densities to within 
an approximate range of historical variability (table 5) or to 
 manipulate proportions of oak’s growth forms (table 2, 
fig. 4). Burning or oak thinning can reduce oak densities, 
but reductions will probably only be temporary because 
of oak’s prolific resprouting ability (Harrington 1985). 
Burning may be most useful for top-killing small stems 
less than about 6 inches in diameter (fig. 8), with summer 
burns resulting in the least resprouting  (Harrington 1985). 
Figure 9—Reponses of Gambel oak diameter growth to mechanically 
thinning ponderosa pine, thinning oak within clumps, and prescribed burning

Onkonburi (1999). Ranges reflect site means, except for the oak thinning 
treatment that included only one site. Years indicate how long growth 
changes persisted after treatment. Values are the total change in diameter 
growth during the time period.

12
USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-218. 2008
Intense burns are probably needed to reduce densities of 
larger stems, but more commonly, management strategies 
seek to maintain existing large, old oaks because of their 
ecological value. Based on Kruse’s (1992) successional 
model, existing oak thickets may also self-thin through 
time (Clary and Tiedemann 1986). Other treatments, such 
as herbicides, chaining, girdling, and goat grazing, have 
been tested for removing oaks to increase forage primarily 
in Gambel oak shrublands in Colorado and Utah (Engle 
and others 1983). These treatments often have had mixed 
success in both the short and the long term (Engle and 
others 1983). Eliminating oak is not part of ecosystem 
management strategies in pine-oak forests.
 Reducing competing species, such as pine, may increase 
oak densities (Ffolliott and Gottfried 1991). If applied 
infrequently, some of the same treatments (for example, 
prescribed burning) that initially reduce oak densities may 
increase densities over longer time periods (Harrington 
1985). Persistence of these increases may depend on 
treatment frequency and self-thinning rates within oak 
clumps (Clary and Tiedemann 1986).
Establish New Individuals
 Neilson and Wullstein (1986) found that natural 
seedling establishment was reasonably prevalent in 
Arizona and New Mexico pine-oak forests, with oak 
seedling densities ranging from 49 to 534/acre (120 to 
1,320/ha) at 15 study sites. Methods potentially useful 
for establishing new oak individuals, as opposed to ma-
nipulating densities within existing clones, may include 
increasing seedling establishment, enhancing acorn 
production, and directly planting acorns or seedlings. 
Oak seedling establishment may be enhanced by thinning 
competing trees (Ffolliott and Gottfried 1991), protecting 
seedlings from grazing using cages or other treatments 
(Neilson and Wullstein 1983), and possibly by strategi-
cally locating slash or other material near mature oaks 
to provide favorable microsites for acorn germination 
(Neilson and Wullstein 1986). On sites planned to be 
burned, however, slash should not be located too close to 
mature oaks to cause fire-related mortality. As discussed 
in the next section, acorn production may be increased by 
enhancing oak crown vigor and managing for oaks that 
yield the most acorns. With the exception of Neilson and 
Wullstein (1983), who used northern Utah seed sources 
from oak shrublands, little information is available about 
the feasibility of directly planting acorns or seedlings in 
ponderosa pine forests.
Increase Acorn Production
 Increasing acorn production for wildlife and for en-
hancing natural oak regeneration may be management 
objectives on some sites. McCulloch and others (1965) 
studied acorn production of 94 Gambel oaks for 6 years 
on the Beaver Creek watersheds in northern Arizona. Oaks 
10 to 15 inches (25 to 38 cm) in diameter, with 80 to 100 
percent live crown, yielded the most acorns (fig. 10). Oaks 
less than 5 inches (13 cm) or greater than 18 inches (46 
cm) in diameter produced few acorns. Management strate-
gies, such as pine thinning, that promote large oaks with 
vigorous crowns likely will increase acorn production. 
However, McCulloch and others (1965) reported cyclic 
acorn production, with some years of no production, so 
periodicity of acorn crops should be expected.
Figure 10—Gambel oak acorn production 
as a function of stem diameter and crown 
vigor, measured for 6 years on the Coconino 
National Forest, northern AZ. Oaks 10 to 
15 inches (25 to 38 cm) in diameter and 
possessing 80 to 100 percent live crown 
yielded the most acorns. Data from 
McCulloch and others (1965).

Maintain or Enhance Wildlife Habitat
 Different growth forms, sizes, and densities of Gambel 
oak provide food and habitat for different wildlife species 
(Leidolf and others 2000, Reynolds and others 1970). 
In northern Arizona pine-oak forests, for example, Lesh 
(1999) found that Virginia’s warblers (Vermivora vir-
giniae) preferentially foraged in areas containing two to 
three times greater oak densities than were preferred by 
six other bird species (fig. 11). Virginia’s warblers also 
on average preferred oak clumps exceeding 1,500 ft2 
(139 m2) in area, which were primarily shrub thickets 
dominated by small-diameter stems. Other bird species 
were not closely associated with this shrub-thicket growth 
form. Acorn production-growth form relationships illus-
trate another tradeoff. Small, shrubby oaks generate few 
acorns (McCulloch and others 1965), yet offer accessible 
browse and cover near the ground. In contrast, larger oaks 
can produce abundant acorns, but provide little ground 
cover or browse. Hollowness and cavity presence also are 
positively correlated with oak diameter (Brischler 
2002, Ganey and Vojta 2004). Large, old oaks are most 
frequently hollow (due to heart rot) and contain the most 
cavities and dead wood. In northern Arizona, Brischler 
(2002), for instance, found that less than 8 percent of 
oaks less than 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter were hol-
low, whereas more than 64 percent of oaks greater than 
14 inches (36 cm) in diameter were hollow.
 Manipulating oak growth forms (table 2, fig. 4) is a 
key tool for managing wildlife habitat (Abella 2008). 
Management prescriptions for promoting different oak 
growth forms are summarized in table 6. Large oaks 
likely can be promoted by thinning competing trees, 
while small, shrubby forms can be maintained by fire, 
cutting, or other disturbances that stimulate sprouting.

warblers selected foraging areas containing greater oak densities and clump areas than 
other bird species and as compared to available plots. Data from Lesh (1999).

(1989), and Onkonburi (1999). The magnitudes of the effects of the suggested prescriptions may vary with site conditions and prescription imple-
mentation. Additional research is needed to quantify effects of these variables. 
 
bA particularly important area for future research is to more clearly elucidate effects of oak thinning on the growth of remaining stems.
 
cFuelwood harvests should be carefully planned or regulated to ensure that only prescribed stem diameters and densities are cut.

USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-218. 2008
 For holistic ecosystem management of wildlife com-
munities as wholes, oak management strategies may 
include the following: (1) conserving all existing large, 
old oaks (Ganey and Vojta 2004); (2) maintaining a va-
riety of oak growth forms including shrub-thicket forms 
(Rosenstock 1998); (3) being willing to cut and burn 
small- and medium-sized oaks to promote growth-form 
diversity where desired (Abella 2008); and (4) manag-
ing oak within an ecosystem context that includes treat-
ments promoting vigorous plant communities, healthy 
soil processes, and overstory tree structures reasonably 
consistent with evolutionary environments of pine-oak 
forest wildlife communities (Neff and others 1979).
 Although community- and ecosystem-level perspec-
tives are often desirable, managers may need to meet 
single-species mandates. One example in pine-oak forests 
is the Mexican spotted owl (Strix occidentalis lucida), 
a threatened species under the U.S. Endangered Species 
Act (Prather and others 2008). Several authors have noted 
the importance (for example, for nest and roost sites) 
of Gambel oak to owls in ponderosa pine forests and 
have recommended managing for large oaks (May and 
Gutiérrez 2002, Seamans and others 1999). In a study in 
northern Arizona, for instance, May and others (2004) 
suggested managing for oaks greater than 18 inches 
(46 cm) in diameter that ideally contained cavities. These 
authors also suggested a ban on all fuelwood harvest of 
oak (live, dead, and down), noting that enforcement of 
fuelwood harvest regulations (such as only permitting 
removal of downed logs) is difficult. This also points 
to a landscape-scale perspective, a scale at which actual 
conflicts between single-species management and other 
management priorities decrease (Prather and others 2008). 
For example, oak fuelwood harvest could be excluded 
from owl habitat, while more active oak management 
could be performed in areas not constituting owl habitat. 
Care should be used to ensure, however, that passive 
management in owl habitat meets oak’s needs as a spe-
cies to maintain oak as a sustainable resource for owls 
and other species.
 There are several potential reasons to maintain or in-
crease current overall oak densities for wildlife habitat, 
even though current oak densities are orders of mag-
nitude greater than reconstructed historical densities 
(table 5). For instance, it is possible that oaks provide 
important structural features following past logging of 
large ponderosa pine and current restoration thinning of 
small-diameter pines (May and others 2004, Wightman 
and Germaine 2006). Oak structure may be important for 
mediating the impacts to some wildlife species of rapid 
alteration of pine structure after thinning. There also is 
less evidence that elevated densities of oak have nega-
tive ecosystem-level effects compared to high densities 
of ponderosa pine (for example, Allen and others 2002, 
Covington and Moore 1994). However, high oak density 
can reduce canopy openings, which are critical areas for 
understory plant productivity and insects constituting key 
resources for some wildlife species (Abella and others 
2006). High oak density can also contribute to hazard-
ous fuels, and stand-replacing wildfires destroy habitat 
for some wildlife species (such as owls) for long time 
periods (Jenness and others 2004). Elevated densities of 
small oaks could also interfere with the development or 
survival of large oak if the small stems provide competi-
tion. Another consideration is whether or not dense oak 
shrublands hinder pine recruitment (Savage and Mast 
2005). Although maintaining elevated densities of oak 
may be desirable in many cases, consideration should be 
given to potential tradeoffs of this management strategy 
(Abella and others 2006).
Enhance Understory Vegetation
 Plant community composition below Gambel oak 
canopies often differs from composition below pine and 
in openings (Brown 1958, Evenson and others 1980, 
Madany and West 1984). Different oak growth forms 
also support different plant communities (Abella and 
Springer 2008; fig. 5). Plant communities are usually 
the most species-rich below single oaks and the least 
rich below denser shrub-thickets. However, unique 
microenvironments associated with thickets may sup-
port plant species that are infrequent below other oak 
growth forms. Oak clumps containing multiple, widely 
spaced stems appear optimal for maintaining relatively 
high species richness while facilitating the coexistence 
of plant species requiring either open or closed-canopy 
environments. Pine thinning, seeding, grazing reduction, 
or other treatments may also be useful for enhancing 
understory vegetation in pine-oak forests (Clary 1975).
Browse Production
 Clary (1975) listed Gambel oak as a poisonous plant 
for livestock on Arizona ponderosa pine ranges. 
 Additionally, Harper and others (1988) noted that greater 
than 50 percent oak forage intake may cause livestock 
poisoning. To reduce chances of livestock poisoning when 
oak is a major forage species, Harper and others (1988) 
suggested controlling livestock intake of oak  foliage 
until the foliage is at least 30 days old and removing 
livestock from oak ranges after frosts that turn leaves 
black. However, Harper and others (1985) concluded 

15
USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-218. 2008
that most studies find that cattle and sheep utilize oak 
only after more desirable forage is diminished.
 For wildlife forage, Reynolds and others (1970) noted 
that Gambel oak foliage comprised 8 to 77 percent of 
whitetail deer (Odocoileus virginianus), mule deer 
 (Odocoileus hemionus), and elk (Cervus canadensis) 
diets in pine-oak forests. These authors also reported 
that browse production increases from 2- to 10-inch 
(5- to 25-cm) diameter oaks and declines rapidly for oaks 
greater than 10 inches (25 cm) in diameter. Managing for 
low-growing forms of oak, particularly shrub thickets, 
will produce the greatest amount of accessible forage.
Wood Production
 Gambel oak is valued for fuelwood (Wagstaff 1984), 
but concerns about overharvesting have resulted in cut-
ting restrictions in many areas (Brischler 2002). There is 
consensus in the literature that all large, old oaks should 
be retained in any management strategy (for example, 
Abella and Fulé 2008a, Brischler 2002, Fulé and others 
2005). However, there is no support in the literature for a 
supposition that overall oak abundance has declined and 
therefore should not be actively managed anywhere on 
the landscape (Abella and Fulé 2008b; table 5). In fact, 
fuelwood harvest and cutting of young, small-diameter 
oaks might be useful for stimulating sprouting, ma-
nipulating oak growth forms or densities, and managing 
wildlife habitat and other values (Abella 2008, Clary and 
Tiedemann 1986, Rosenstock 1998).
 Diameter-age relationships may be useful for estimat-
ing which oaks are old and therefore should not be cut. 
Based on data from three sites in northern Arizona pine-
oak forests, probabilities are higher for oaks greater than 
about 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter to be considered old 
and of presettlement origin (fig. 3). To ensure that only 
prescribed oak stems are cut, any commercial or public 
harvests should be strictly regulated, possibly through 
careful marking of stems for removal. Consideration 
could also be given to ensuring that sufficient densities 
of small stems remain to grow into larger size classes 
to become the next cohort of old trees (Brischler 2002). 
Thinning oak offers an important research opportunity 
that may provide insight into uncertainties about Gam-
bel oak ecology, such as whether thinning oak clumps 
increases growth of remaining stems (Onkonburi 1999) 
or if sprouting ability changes as stems or clones age 
(Clary and Tiedemann 1992). As emphasized in the 
Maintain or Enhance Wildlife Habitat section, there are 
many sites where cutting any oak is not appropriate for 
meeting management objectives.
Ecological Restoration
 Ecological restoration is a management tool  (Allen 
and others 2002, Covington and others 1997). The 
objective of ecological restoration is not necessarily 
to reestablish replicas of presettlement ecosystems, an 
 endeavor which may be undesirable or not feasible. 
Instead, restoration’s objective is to place degraded 
ecosystems on trajectories toward recovery to within a 
range of their historical variability (Society for Ecological 
Restoration International Science and Policy Working 
Group 2004). Managing Gambel oak using a restoration 
perspective may be useful in some contexts and on some 
sites.
  Comparing reference conditions, generally agreed in 
pine-oak forests to be the late 1800s before Euro-Amer-
ican settlement (Allen and others 2002, Fulé and others 
1997), to current conditions provides a basis for devel-
oping restoration prescriptions. Notable are dramatically 
higher densities of small-diameter trees of both oak and 
pine in current forests compared to reference conditions 
(table 5). Additionally, frequent surface fire was part of 
oak’s evolutionary environment before fire exclusion 
in the late 1800s (table 4). Reducing densities of small-
diameter oak and pine, principally through cutting and 
burning, while maintaining large, old trees, is needed to 
approximately reestablish presettlement conditions. For 
strict restoration, prescribed burning at intervals less than 
10 years on most sites, preferably in summer when many 
fires historically occurred (Fulé and others 1997), could 
thin small oaks while reintroducing fire as an ecologi-
cal process. Pine thinning and fuel reduction would be 
needed on most sites before attempting to reintroduce 
fire, particularly for summer burns (Allen and others 
2002, Covington and others 1997).
Key Research Needs _____________
 Key research needs include refining our understanding 
of the effects of pine and oak thinning and prescribed 
 burning on oak growth, as well as sharpening our 
 knowledge of poorly understood aspects of oak ecology. 
Pine thinning has generally increased oak growth (Fulé 
and others 2005, Onkonburi 1999), but many questions 
 remain. These questions include oak’s responses to varying 
levels of pine thinning, whether responses change among 
different sizes or ages of oak, and if prescribed burning 
interacts with pine thinning. Uncertainties regarding oak 
thinning include how clones allocate energy between 
resprouting and growth of residual stems and whether 
sprouting or growth responses vary as stems or clones 

16

age (Clary and Tiedemann 1992). Prescribed burning has 
resulted in variable, and sometimes negative, effects on 
oak diameter growth (Fulé and others 2005, Onkonburi 
1999). Testing effects of nearly any aspect of burning, 
such as timing, frequency, intensity, or implementation 
(for example, raking fuel away from oak boles), on oak 
growth and survival is an important research need as fire 
is reintroduced to pine-oak forests.
 It is not well known whether oak diameter growth or 
growth forms differ with soil types or other site factors in 
pine-oak forests. This information would be useful for re-
fining diameter-age relationships for identifying old trees 
and better predicting growth responses to management 
treatments. Patterns of oak seedling establishment are also 
poorly understood but would be important for predict-
ing oak regeneration after disturbance and management. 
Another poorly understood aspect of oak ecology is the 
relative proportions of oak growth forms that existed in 
presettlement forests. Possibly this could be assessed in 
contemporary forests by examining how sprout densities 
change under different burn frequencies.
Summary and Management 
Implications ____________________
Biological Characteristics
 • Gambel oak regenerates through both seedlings and 
sprouts. Prolific sprouting often occurs after stems 
are top-killed by cutting or fire.
 • While oak growth likely varies among sites, stud-
ies at three northern Arizona sites found that stems 
greater than 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) in diameter 
are usually greater than 100 years old.
 • Individual stems of Gambel oak can live for more 
than 400 years, and clones may live even longer.
 • Gambel oak occurs in ponderosa pine-oak forests 
as gradations of three basic growth forms: shrubby 
thickets of small-diameter stems, pole-sized clumps, 
and large trees.
 • Oak persisted in historically frequently burned for-
ests. Preliminary information from contemporary 
prescribed burns suggests that some fire resistance 
may be attained when stem diameters exceed 6 inches 
(15 cm). Additional research is needed to clarify this 
relationship.
Importance in Ponderosa Pine Forests
 • Oak adds diversity in often otherwise pure ponde-
rosa pine forests. Oak influences soils, understory 
plant communities, wildlife habitat, and human 
values. Passive or active oak management affects 
these ecological properties and human values.
Evolutionary Environment
 • Frequent fires and open stand conditions generally 
characterized oak’s evolutionary environment in 
pine-oak forests.
Current Conditions
 • Fires have been excluded and densities of both 
ponderosa pine and oak have increased since 
 Euro-American settlement in the late 1800s. All nine 
studies examining oak density changes found that 
densities of small-diameter oaks have escalated, 
ranging from average increases of 16 to 450 stems/
acre (40 to 1,112 stems/ha).
 • Current conditions in pine-oak forests are outside a 
range of variability characterizing their evolutionary 
environment. There is no general ecological basis 
for not actively managing oak and sites containing 
oak, although specific objectives may require passive 
management.
Management Objectives
Prescribed burning
 • Fire may be used to manipulate oak growth forms 
and stem densities, stimulate sprouting, and accom-
plish other management objectives (for example, 
fuel reduction). Preliminary evidence from three 
northern Arizona sites suggests that mortality will 
be heavy (> 60 percent) for oak stems less than 
6 inches (15 cm) in diameter, but mortality decreases 
for larger stems.
 • Several tactics may help enhance survival of eco-
logically valuable large oaks during prescribed fire: 
keeping pine slash away from oak boles, avoiding 
lighting near oaks or reducing fire intensity near 
oaks, and raking fuels away from oak clumps.
Increase diameter growth
 • Thinning ponderosa pine or other competing 
trees will likely increase oak diameter growth. 
Prescribed burning has exhibited variable effects 
on oak growth. Mechanically thinning oak within 
clumps will probably not reduce growth of remain-
ing stems, but responses are unclear because of 
uncertainties about energy allocation to resprouting 
within clones.

17
USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-218. 2008
Change density
 • Burning and thinning oak can temporarily reduce 
densities, but these treatments may result in longer 
term increases because of oak’s prolific sprouting 
ability.
Establish new individuals
 • Oak seedling establishment may be enhanced by 
providing sheltered microsites (for example, strategi-
cally scattering slash), increasing acorn production, 
or protecting seedlings from grazing. Directly plant-
ing acorns or seedlings may also be effective, but its 
feasibility has not been studied.
Increase acorn production
 • Oaks 10 to 15 inches (25 to 38 cm) in diameter con-
taining vigorous crowns produced the most acorns 
in a northern Arizona study. Improving oak vigor, 
possibly through pine thinning, may boost acorn 
production.
Maintain or enhance wildlife habitat
 • Different oak growth forms, sizes, and densities pro-
vide habitat for different wildlife species. An oak man-
agement plan for benefiting the wildlife community 
as a whole could entail: (1) conserving existing large, 
old oaks; (2) maintaining multiple oak growth forms 
ranging from shrubby thickets to large trees; and 
(3) burning or cutting small oaks to stimulate sprouting 
and growth-form variation where desired.
Enhance understory vegetation
 • An intermediate oak growth form, consisting of 
clumps of widely spaced stems, optimizes under-
story species richness and habitat for plant species 
associated with oak.
Browse production
 • Stimulating sprouting and managing for low-
growing shrubby forms of oak will likely  produce 
the greatest and most accessible amount of browse.
Wood production
 • Cutting live oak stems would represent a policy shift 
in many areas. However, cutting small- and medium-
sized stems, which have sharply increased since the 
late 1800s, has potential in specific areas for man-
aging wildlife habitat and accomplishing other oak 
management objectives. Harvests should be strictly 
regulated to ensure that large, old oaks are not cut 
and sufficient stems remain to grow into large size 
classes.
Ecological restoration
 • While not seeking to replicate presettlement condi-
tions, densities of small-diameter oaks should be 
reduced and surface fire eventually reestablished 
for restoring oak to within a range of historical vari-
ability.
 • In pine-oak forests, it could be argued that it makes 
little ecological sense, as a general rule, to perform 
restoration treatments on ponderosa pine while 
taking a “hands-off” approach with oak. Since oak 
expands after disturbances (including thinning) that 
reduce pine, passive oak management may have 
an unintended consequence of misbalancing pine 
and oak abundance. Additionally, a “hands-off” 
approach may remove flexibility from restoration 
prescriptions that otherwise could manipulate oak 
growth forms to positively restore wildlife habitat 
and other ecosystem values.
 • On the other hand, elevated oak density could con-
stitute key intermediary tree structure for wildlife 
precisely because restoration pine thinning removes 
large densities of small pine trees and time is required 
to reestablish large-tree pine structure.

3. reference lists in located articles
 The search words were Gambel oak and Quercus 
gambelii. Category 7 (wildlife and invertebrate habitat) 
is intended only to provide examples of the diverse lit-
erature on Gambel oak-wildlife relationships. Similarly, 
the list is not intended to be exhaustive on all subjects 
(for example, oak genetics). Some references in the list 
could be classified into multiple categories, and these 
references were classified into the one category each 
most closely matched.

The Rocky Mountain Research Station develops scientific information and 
technology to improve management, protection, and use of the forests 
and rangelands. Research is designed to meet the needs of the National 
Forest managers, Federal and State agencies, public and private organi-
zations, academic institutions, industry, and individuals. Studies accelerate 
solutions to problems involving ecosystems, range, forests, water, recreation, 
fire, resource inventory, land reclamation, community sustainability, forest 
engineering technology, multiple use economics, wildlife and fish habitat, 
and forest insects and diseases. Studies are conducted cooperatively, and 
applications may be found worldwide.
