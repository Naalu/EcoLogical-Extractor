Effects of Fire Interval Restoration on Carbon
and Nitrogen in Sedimentary- and Volcanic-
Derived Soils of the Mogollon Rim, Arizona
Daniel G. Neary1, Steven T. Overby2, and Sally M. Haase3
Abstract—Prescribed fire was returned into over-stocked ponderosa pine stands on
the Mogollon Rim of Arizona for the purpose of restoring fire into the ecosystem and
removing fuel buildups. Prescribed fires have been ignited at intervals of 1, 2, 4, 6,
8, and 10 years to determine the best fire return interval for Southwestern ponderosa
pine ecosystems. Two sites were treated: one on volcanic-derived soils, and the
other on sedimentary-derived soils near Flagstaff, Arizona, starting in 1976 and 1977
respectively. Samples from upper 5 cm of the A horizons were analyzed for total
carbon and nitrogen using an elemental analyzer. Soil carbon and nitrogen levels
were highly variable and exhibited an increasing, but inconsistent, concentration
trend related to burn interval. High spatial variability measured within treatments is
probably due to micro-site differences (location of samples in the open, under large
old-growth trees, in small-diameter thickets, in pole-sized stands, next to downed
logs, etc.). Stratification of samples by micro-site differences could possibly reduce
the within-plot variability but add considerable complexity to the sampling design.
Introduction
T
he pre-European settlement ponderosa pine forests of the Mogollon
Rim consisted of open stands of uneven-aged trees with a significant
grass-forb understory. Light surface-fires occurred on an average interval of
2 to 12 years in Arizona and New Mexico (Weaver 1951, Cooper 1960, Dietrich
1980). These fires consumed forest floor material, burned most of the young
regeneration, and promoted growth of a dense, grassy understory. Catastrophic
crown fires were rare due to the lack of ladder fuels and the clumpy, widely
spaced ponderosa pine canopy (Dieterich 1980, Sackett 1980). Fine fuels re-
duction from heavy sheep and cattle grazing and then modern forest fire
suppression resulted in the development of dense, overstocked stands.
Forest floor fuel loads that were 0.4-4.5 Mg/ha prior to 1870 have since
increased by one to nearly two orders of magnitude. Average loadings of natu-
rally fallen fuels were 49 Mg/ha two decades ago with some stands
accumulating up to 112 Mg/ha (Sackett 1979, Sackett et al. 1996). Annual
accumulations since then have been in the range of 1.3 to 7.8 Mg/ha/yr.
Tree densities that were once <130 stems/ha have increased dramatically, es-
pecially in dense thickets with more than 2,750 stems/ha (Sackett 1980,
Covington and Sackett 1986). Stand basal areas that were <11.5 m2/ha prior
to removal of fire from ponderosa pine stands on the Mogollon Rim have
since increased by a three- or four-fold factor (Marlin Johnson, personal com-
munication). Ponderosa pine stands reached a critical ecological point in 1991.
Fuel loads had so increased that by the end of the 20th century wildfires

consumed four times the area that they did in the period from 1910 to 1990
(Neary et al. 1999).
Carbon and Nitrogen in Ponderosa Pine Ecosystems
Fires can greatly alter nutrient cycles of forest ecosystems depending on fire
severity, fire frequency, vegetation, and climate (Neary et al. 1996). Responses
of total C and N are variable and depend on the site conditions and fire char-
acteristics. In most soils, the majority of the N pool is contained in the soil
organic matter (OM). Mineral forms of N are usually lower but respond to
fire. For example, Grove et al. (1986) found no change in organic C in the
surface 0-1.2 in (0-3 cm) of soil immediately following burning; however,
percent total N increased. Knoepp and Swank (1993) found no consistent
response in total N in the upper soil layer, but increases in ammonium N
(NH4-N) concentrations and N mineralization occurred on areas where a
burning treatment followed felling.
As would be expected, frequency of burning affects C accumulations. A
study was carried out on tropical savanna sites in Africa having both clay and
sandy soils that were burned repeatedly every 1, 3, or 5 years (Bird et al.
2000). While the clay sites had greater total C than did the sandy soils, they
responded similarly to burning. All unburned sites had 40-50 percent greater
C than burned sites. Low frequency burning (every 5 years) resulted in an
increase in soil C of about 10 percent compared to the mean of all burned
areas. High frequency burning (every year) decreased C about 10 percent. In
another study, Wells et al. (1979) reported the results of a 20-year burning
study in a pine plantation in South Carolina. They found that periodic burn-
ing over a 20-year period removed 27 percent of the forest floor. Annual
burning conducted in the summer removed 29 percent of the forest floor as
compared to a 54 percent loss resulting from winter burning. The total OM
content of the surface soil (0-5 cm) increased in all cases but there was no
effect on the 5-10 cm soil layer. Interestingly, when they summed the OM in
the forest floor and in the surface 0-10 cm of soil they found that these low-
severity periodic burns sites had not reduced, but only redistributed the OM.
Nitrogen in Ponderosa Pine Ecosystems
Prescribed fire has long been viewed as an important tool for restoring
ponderosa pine stands in the Southwest (Sackett 1980, Sackett et al. 1996).
The purpose of prescribed fire is to reduce fuel loads while promoting a healthy,
fire-resistant, and productive forest. Sackett (1980) established a set of studies
near Flagstaff, Arizona (Chimney Springs and Limestone Flats), to restore
overstocked ponderosa pine stands by introducing prescribed fire at 1-, 2-, 4-,
6-, 8-, and 10-year intervals. Since ponderosa pine growth is often limited by
low nitrogen (N) availability, a major concern with frequent prescribed fire is
the effect on soil N pools (Powers 1980).
Nitrogen is considered the most limiting nutrient in wildland ecosystems
and as such it requires special consideration when fire is managed, particularly
in N-deficient ecosystems (Maars et al. 1983). Nitrogen is unique because it is
the only soil nutrient that is not supplied to the soil by chemical weathering of
parent material. Almost all N found in the vegetation, water, and soil of wild-
land systems has to be added to the system from the atmosphere. The cycling
of N involves a series of interrelated complex chemical and biological pro-
cesses.
Nitrogen pools can be severely disturbed by soil heating during the com-
bustion process. Volatilization is the chemically driven process most responsible

for N losses during fire. There is a gradual increase in N loss by volatilization
as temperature increases (Knight 1966, White et al. 1973). The amount of N
loss at different temperatures follows the heating sequence shown in table 1.
As a general rule the amount of total N that is volatilized during combustion
is directly proportional to the amount of OM destroyed (Raison et al. 1985a).
It has been estimated that almost 99 percent of the volatilized N is converted
to N2 gas (DeBell and Ralston 1970). At lower temperatures N2 can be pro-
duced during OM decomposition without the volatilization of N compounds
(Grier 1975). The N that is not completely volatilized either remains as part
of the unconsumed fuels or it is converted to highly available ammonium
nitrogen (NH4-N) that remains in the soil (DeBano et al. 1979, Covington
and Sackett 1986, DeBano 1991).
Estimates of the total N losses during prescribed fire must be based on both
fire behavior and total fuel consumption because irregular burning patterns
are common. As a result, combustion is not complete at all locations on the
landscape (DeBano et al. 1998). For example, total N loss was studied during
a prescribed burn in southern California (DeBano and Conrad 1978). In this
study, only 10 percent of the total N contained in the plant, litter, and upper
soil layers was lost. The greatest loss of N occurred in aboveground fuels and
litter on the soil surface. In another study of N loss during a prescribed fire
over dry and moist soils, about two-thirds of the total N was lost during burns
over dry soils compared to only 25 percent when the litter and soil were moist
(DeBano et al. 1979). Although these losses were relatively small, it must be
remembered that even small losses can adversely affect the long-term produc-
tivity of N-deficient ecosystems.
Monleon et al. (1997) conducted understory burns on ponderosa pine sites
burned 4 months, 5 years, and 12 years previously. The surface soils, 0 to
5 cm, showed the only significant response. The 4-month burned sites had
increased total C and inorganic N following burning, and an increased C/N
ratio. Burning the 5-year-old sites resulted in a decrease in total soil C and N,
and a decrease in the C/N ratio. Total soil C and N in the surface soils did not
respond to burning on the 12-year-old site.
Nitrogen Losses — An Enigma
It has been conclusively established by numerous studies that total N is
decreased as a result of combustion (DeBano et al. 1998). The amount of N
lost is generally proportional to the amount of OM combusted during the
fire. The temperatures at which N is lost are discussed above. In contrast,
available N is usually increased as a result of fire, particularly NH4-N
(Christensen 1973, DeBano et al. 1979, Carballas et al. 1993). This increased
N availability enhances post-fire plant growth, and gives the impression that
more total N is present after fire. Increased fertility, however, is misleading
and short-lived. Temporary increase in available soil N following fire is usually

rapidly utilized by plants and microorganisms in the first few years after burn-
ing.
The consequences of N losses during fire on ecosystem productivity de-
pend on the proportion of total N lost for a given ecosystem (DeBano et al.
1998). In N-limited ecosystems even small losses of N by volatilization can
impact long-term productivity. Consequently, a key ecosystem parameter that
has been studied in the ponderosa pine restoration study established by Sackett
(1980) is N.
Covington and Sackett (1986, 1992) examined N concentrations in the
upper 5 cm of mineral soil at the Chimney Springs burning interval study
(Sackett 1980). They found that mineral forms of N (NH4-N and NO3-N)
made up <2% of the total N pool. Burning at 1- and 2-year intervals signifi-
cantly increased only NH4-N levels in the soil. Total soil N in the upper 5 cm
was not affected by prescribed fire interval. A later study (Wright and Hart
1997) assessed the effects of the two-year burning interval at the Chimney
Springs site. It inferred that repeated burning at two-year intervals may have
detrimental long-term effects on N cycling, along with depletion of the forest
floor and surface mineral soil C and N pools.
Methods
Study Sites
The original study sites established in 1976 and 1977 were designed to
determine the optimum-burning interval necessary to provide continuous fire
hazard reduction. These studies are described in greater detail by Sackett
(1980), Covington and Sackett (1986), and Sackett et al. (1996). Sites were
selected on volcanic soils at Chimney Springs, Fort Valley Experimental For-
est, north of Flagstaff, Arizona, and sedimentary soils at Limestone Flats, Long
Valley Experimental Forest, near Clint’s Well, Arizona. Twenty-one 1.0 ha
plots make up each study site. There are three replications of unburned (con-
trol), and 1-, 2-, 4-, 6-, 8-, and 10-year prescribed fire treatments. All of the
burn rotation treatments, except for the 10-year rotation and controls, were
burned the previous October (2001).
Chimney Springs
The Chimney Springs study is located in the Fort Valley Experimental
Forest, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Coconino National Forest about
3 km northwest of Flagstaff, Arizona. Soils are Brolliar stony clay loam, a fine,
smectic, frigid Typic Argiboroll derived from basalt and cinders (Meurisse
1971). Stand structure and fuels are described by Sackett (1980). The origi-
nal ponderosa pine stand was virtually undisturbed by wildfire since 1876 but
was grazed in the late 19th century and placed under fire control. At the initia-
tion of the study, the ponderosa pine stand consisted of reproduction
(976 stems/ha), saplings (2,752 stems/ha), pole-sized trees (771 stems/ha),
and old growth (dbh >28 cm, 133 stems/ha). The basal area was 33.0 m2/ha
in trees >10 cm dbh. The original fuel load of dead surface and ground fuels
was 34.0 Mg/ha.
Limestone Flats
The Limestone Flats study is located in the Long Valley Experimental
Forest, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Coconino National Forest, about

2 km northwest of Clint’s Well, Arizona. Soils are very fine sandy loam
textured, fine, smectic, Typic Cryoboralfs. These soils developed from weath-
ered sandstone with limestone inclusions. Stand structure and fuels are described
by Sackett (1980). The original ponderosa pine stand was treated with a sani-
tation cutting in the mid 1960s to remove trees attacked by insects and
disease. It was also grazed in the late 19th century, and placed under fire con-
trol, but grazing had been eliminated many years prior to 1976. The ponderosa
pine stand consisted of reproduction (1,373 stems/ha), saplings (2,881 stems/
ha), pole-sized trees (388 stems/ha), and old growth (dbh >28 cm, 82 stems/
ha). The basal area was 22.5 m2/ha in trees >10 cm dbh. The original fuel
load of dead surface and ground fuels was 34.9 Mg/ha.
Soil Sampling
The soils at both the Chimney Springs and Limestone Flats sites were sampled
in late December 2002. The initial sampling location was randomly selected
within the center 400 m2 of each plot. The next two samples were located 5 m
from the first sample, selected by a randomization process, on two of the
cardinal directions from the first sample. The locations were not stratified by
stand structure or other site features as was done in the study by Covington
and Sackett (1986).
Approximately 500 g was collected from the 0-5 cm depth of the mineral
soil. The samples were air dried in the laboratory, sieved to a size of <2 mm,
and sub-sampled for analysis. Sub samples were ground to a 40 mesh particle
size then oven dried at 40o C.
Carbon and Nitrogen Analysis
Soil total C and N were analyzed on a Thermo-Quest Flash EA1112 C-N
analyzer. The computer-controlled instrument oxidizes samples at 1,500o C,
separates CO2 and NO2, by gas chromatography on a packed column, and
determines C and N content with a thermal conductivity detector. Analysis
was performed using a standard protocol for this instrument, which includes
blanks, certified soil standards, and quality control samples during operations.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using the SAS univariate ANOVA under the GLM Pro-
cedure (SAS 2000) and Tukey’s Studentized Range test for means separation
of C and N values (p = 0.05). The plot design is 6 treatments (burn intervals
1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 years) and a control (unburned) times 3 replicates of each
treatment and control.
Results and Discussion
Carbon
Total soil C levels in the Limestone Flats and Chimney Springs 0-5 cm
horizon exhibit two trends (figure 1). The first is that soil C is significantly
higher at Chimney Springs (table 2). The initial forest floor fuel loading (34.0
Mg/ha) was actually lower than the Limestone Flats loading (34.9 Mg/ha).
At the start of the study in 1976, the Chimney Springs site had a higher basal
area and nearly double the density of pole and old growth trees (Sackett 1980).
Covington and Sackett’s (1986) stratified sampling indicated higher levels of

N (hence C) in old-growth stands. The random nature of the sampling in this
study may have picked up more of the sites at Chimney Springs that Covington
and Sackett (1986) identified as “sawtimber” (old growth). Soil classification
also explains the difference between the carbon in the Limestone Flats and
Chimney Springs soils. The latter were classified as Argiborolls belonging to
the Mollisol soil order, indicating that they have naturally higher organic mat-
ter contents than the Cryoboralfs (Alfisol soil order) found at Limestone Flats.
The second trend in the soil C data appears to be that burning at the 8-year
interval produced statistically significant higher soil C levels than the controls
and that burning in general increases total C in the mineral soil (table 3). The
C concentration in the soil increased from 2.856% in the control to 5.277% in
the 8-year burning interval. However, only the control and 8-year interval are
statistically different. These data reflect more of the variability in soil C de-
tected in this random sampling approach than any burning interval trend. It is
evident that the prescribed fires reintroduced into the two sites have increased
soil C. Sackett et al. (1996) concluded that the best burning interval was 4
years for reducing fuel loads. That interval produced the intermediate C level
in the 0-5 cm depth of the mineral soil.
Nitrogen
Total soil N levels followed a similar trend as total soil C (figure 2). Total
soil N concentrations were mostly higher across the range of burning

intervals. Concentrations increased from an average of 0.188% in the control
plots to 0.330% in the 8-year burning interval (table 3). Soil N at Chimney
Springs with Typic Argiboroll soils was significantly different from Limestone
Flats with Cryoboralf soils (table 2). Significant differences in total N concentra-
tions where found between control and 2-year burning interval and the 8-year
burning interval plot (table 3).
Covington and Sackett (1986) reported that <2% of the soil N measured in
their mid 1980s sampling was mineralized N (NH4-N and NO3-N). The data
from this sampling conflict with Wright and Hart’s (1997) hypothesis that
burning at 2-year intervals may have detrimental long-term effects on N cy-
cling, along with depletion of the forest floor and surface mineral soil C and N
pools. The 2-year burning interval was not significantly different from the
control or other burning intervals, only the 8-year burning interval. Wright
and Hart (1997) did not investigate the 1-year burning interval, yet our sam-
pling showed it to be at an intermediate level of N in the 0-5 cm horizon. The

soil N pool does not provide a readily available source of N to plants and
microorganisms because of the slow decomposition rates in these semi-arid
ecosystems. This limitation, rather than any declines in the total soil N pool,
may account for the N enigma that DeBano et al. (1998) discuss.
Sample Variability
The lack of a strong burning interval response in this study was most likely
affected by site variability and the random sampling used. To obtain an under-
standing of the variability in soil total C and N, individual plot data is quite
instructive (figure 4).

The 1-year burning interval plot samples for total C at Limestone Flats
ranged from 2.933% to 3.796%, a span of 0.863%. The unburned control
samples had a range from 2.630% to 3.160%, a similar span of 0.530%. The
10-year burning interval plots at Limestone Flats had the highest variability.
Total soil C in the 0 to 5 cm depth ranged from 1.717% to 5.709%, a span of
3.991%. The unburned control plot samples at Chimney Springs had a range
from 2.367% to 3.711%, a span (1.344%) nearly triple that of the Limestone
Flats control. Within plot variability was much higher at Chimney Springs
than at Limestone Flats (figure 4).
The total C and N variability observed from the random samples at the
Chimney Springs and Limestone Flats sites was probably influenced by a num-
ber of factors. Covington and Sackett (1986) stratified their sampling at
Chimney Springs by stand type (e.g., sawtimber, poles, and saplings). It was
very evident during the sampling that there were visually evident differences
in the levels of litter accumulations and OM concentrations in the mineral soil
under these three different stand types. In addition, several other factors ap-
peared to be important. Samples collected in the middle of clearings and next
to decaying, but not completely burned, logs had visually apparent differences
in color that reflected OM content. Another factor that could be important,
but was not readily discernable on the ground, is the presence of “hot spots”
where dead and decaying logs were at some point in time completely com-
busted by the prescribed fires. These logs would create zones of high fire
severity that would burn much of the soil OM and drive off most of the sur-
face mineral soil N (DeBano et al. 1998).
Our recommendation as a follow-up to this study is to resample using
Covington and Sackett’s (1986) stand classification approach (i.e., sawtimber,
poles, and saplings), but add in areas such as clearings, decaying logs, and
high-severity burn spots. Using a composite sample of several cores would
also aid in the leveling of variability of the samples. While the classification
does allow easy scaling up to stand and landscape levels, the other categories
do not. That is why random sampling is still of interest. Some work is still
needed to determine sample sizes needed to detect differences between the
individual burning intervals, if such differences exist at all.
Summary and Conclusions
The effects of burning intervals for restoration of ponderosa pine stands on
total C and N concentrations in the 0-5 cm horizon of two different soil types
was examined. The burning intervals (unburned, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 years)
were provided by a study established in 1976 and 1977 and have been main-
tained thereafter (Sackett 1980, Sackett et al. 1996). Although there were
statistically significant differences between the total C levels in soils of the
unburned plots and the 8-year burning interval, there were no differences
between burning intervals. There also was a statistically significant difference
between unburned and 2-year burning interval and the 8-year burning inter-
val in total soil N. This study determined that burning increased mineral soil
C and N, which conflicted with Wright and Hart’s (1997) contention that the
2-year burning interval could deplete soil N and C pools. This study did not
examine the mineral fractions of the soil N pool, NH4-N, and NO3-N. Al-
though the mineral forms of N are small (<2 % of the total soil N pool), they
are very important for plant nutrition and microorganism population func-
tions. It is recommended that the study be repeated contrasting stratified
sampling and higher intensity random sampling approaches.
