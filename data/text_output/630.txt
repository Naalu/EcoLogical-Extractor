SYSTEMATIC REVIEW
Open Access
Have wet meadow restoration projects in the
Southwestern U.S. been effective in restoring
geomorphology, hydrology, soils, and plant
species composition?
Karissa M Ramstead1, James A Allen1* and Abraham E Springer2
Abstract
Background: Wet meadows occur in numerous locations throughout the American Southwest, but in many cases
have become heavily degraded. Among other things they have frequently been overgrazed and have had roads
built through them, which have affected the hydrology of these wetland ecosystems.
Because of the important hydrologic and ecological functions they are believed to perform, there is currently
significant interest in wet meadow restoration. Several restoration projects have been completed recently or are
underway in the region, sometimes at considerable expense and with minimal monitoring. The objective of this
review was to evaluate the effects of wet meadow restoration projects in the southwestern United States on
geomorphology, hydrology, soils and plant species composition. A secondary objective was to determine the
effects of wet meadow restoration projects on wildlife.
Methods: Electronic databases, internet search engines, websites and personal contacts were used to find articles
of relevance to this review. Articles were filtered by title, abstract and full text. Summary information for each of the
articles remaining after the filtering process was compiled and used to assess the quality of the evidence presented
using two different approaches.
Results: Our searches yielded 48 articles, of which 25 were published in peer-reviewed journals, 14 were
monitoring or project reports, and 9 were published in conference proceedings or are unpublished theses or
manuscripts.
A total of 26 operational-scale restoration projects were identified. A wide range of restoration techniques were
employed, ranging from small-scale manipulations of stream channels (e.g., riffle structures) to large scale pond-
and-plug projects. Other common restoration techniques included fencing to exclude livestock (and sometimes
also native ungulates), other forms of grazing management, seeding, and transplanting seedlings.
Most of the articles reported that restoration was fully or partially effective, at least in the short-term. However, the
relative lack of high quality quantitative data, and especially data extending more than two years after project
implementation, greatly limits our ability to determine how effective restoration has truly been in practice.

Conclusions: While caution is warranted due to data quality limitations, progress has been made over the past 20
years in wet meadow restoration. In particular, important contributions have been made in restoring the highly
degraded wet meadow systems that are characterized by deep, wide and relatively straight gullies. There is
evidence, for example, that the pond-and-plug approach is an effective technique for restoring many aspects of
these systems, albeit at the cost of creating new features (ponds) that are not necessarily natural features of wet
meadows.
There is a need to allocate additional effort to project documentation, including better-designed and longer-lasting
monitoring programs. One approach that might help is for practitioners to work with scientists from government
agencies, local universities and colleges, and other organizations. When this type of collaboration has happened in
the past it appears to have been effective. Many important lessons could have been learned, and mistakes avoided,
if more effort had been put into documenting both successes and failures of past projects.

Background
Introduction
High elevation streamside and groundwater-fed mea-
dows occur in numerous locations throughout the
American Southwest. They are referred to by a variety of
names, such as riparian meadows, montane meadows,
subalpine meadows, sedge meadows, or wet meadows.
For the remainder of this review the term wet meadow
will be used.
Where wet meadows have not been excessively altered,
sedges (Carex spp.), rushes (Juncus spp.), spikerushes
(Eleocharis spp.) and obligate or facultative wetland
grasses (e.g., Deschampsia spp. and Calamagrostis spp.)
are often the dominant species [1-4]. Willow (Salix spp.)
and alder (Alnus spp.) species may also occur in or adja-
cent to these meadows [4-7].
Wet meadows in the American Southwest frequently
occur along elevation gradients that include a stream or
other water body at the lower end. The upland side may
contain a vegetation community gradient including some
of these types: mesic meadows, dry meadows, sagebrush
(Artemesia spp.), pine (Pinus spp.) dominated forest, or
mixed conifer forest. These elevation and vegetation gradi-
ents are closely associated with differences in flooding,
depth to water table/soil moisture content, and other soil
characteristics. Wet meadows typically occur on sites with
water table levels near or slightly above the ground surface
throughout the spring and early summer [8-11].
Distribution of wet meadows in the American Southwest
The extent of wet meadows in the American Southwest -
which we define as the states of Arizona, California,
Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah - is not well
documented. When considered within the context of the
entire southwestern landscape, we know that wet mea-
dows are relatively rare. Less than 1% of the landscape
in the region is characterized as wetlands [12], and wet
meadows are just one of several wetland types that
occur. Within certain subregions, however, wet meadows
can be locally common. Approximately 133,000 ha of
meadows are reported to occur in the Sierra Nevada
Mountains of California [13]. That acreage is distributed
among more than 10,000 individual meadows [13]; how-
ever, it is not clear what proportion of those meadows
would be classified as wet meadows. Patton and Judd [1]
reported that approximately 17,700 ha of wet and transi-
tional (moist) meadows occur on national forests in
Arizona and New Mexico, together accounting for 0.2%
of the total area.
Ecological roles of wet meadows
Wet meadows are key habitats for many species. Elk
(Cervus elaphus) and other large ungulates, for example,
have been shown to make extensive use of wet meadows
as foraging sites [1,14]. Small mammals that use wet
meadows include meadow voles (Microtus spp.), pocket
gophers (Thomomys spp.), field mice (Peromyscus spp.),
shrews (Sorex spp.), and American minks (Mustela
vison). In the Sierra Nevada Mountains, 82 terrestrial
vertebrate
species
are
dependent
on
riparian
and
meadow habitats [13].
In addition to the common wildlife species that are
dependent on wet meadows, several threatened, endan-
gered and sensitive species also occur. For example,
threatened, endangered and sensitive species in the Sierra
Nevada that use wet meadows for at least a portion of
their life cycle requirements include the Yosemite toad
(Bufo canoru), the mountain yellow–legged frog (Rana
muscosa), the willow flycatcher (Empidonax traillii), and
the great gray owl (Strix nebulosa;13). In east central
Arizona populations of Apache trout (Onocorhynchus
gilae var. apache) endemic to high elevation streams have
dwindled due to habitat degradation, resulting in its
listing as an endangered species [15].
Although generally less well-documented than the
roles described above, wet meadows also perform other

important
ecosystem
functions
that
are
commonly
attributed to wetlands, such as water-quality improve-
ment, attenuation of peak flows, water storage, and car-
bon sequestration [13,16,17].
Alterations of wet meadow ecosystems
Wet meadows are subject to a variety of natural distur-
bances and are also one of the ecosystem types in the
American Southwest that has been most altered by
humans. Among other things, they have been used ex-
tensively for livestock grazing, are the sites of many
small dams and stock tanks, have had roads built
through or adjacent to them, and have been impacted by
wild ungulate grazing, invasive species and wildfires in
the surrounding uplands. These types of alterations have
in turn had important impacts on the hydrology of wet
meadows, most notably by lowering of their water tables
due to stream channel incision, surface water diversions,
or groundwater withdrawal [16,18-20]. In the Sierra
Nevada Mountains, an estimated 52,630 to 80,970 ha of
wet meadows have been impacted by these types of dis-
turbances over the past 150 years [13]. Impacts include
severe erosion, soil desiccation, shrub and tree encroach-
ment, and changes in plant and animal species compos-
ition and diversity [13,21,22].
Objectives
The primary objective of this review is to address the
question “Have wet meadow restoration projects in the
southwestern United States been effective in restoring
geomorphology, hydrology, soils, and plant species com-
position?” A secondary objective is to address the ques-
tion “Have wildlife species increased in diversity and/or
abundance following wet meadow restoration?”
Methods
Question formulation
The subject of wet meadow restoration was proposed by
the reviewers primarily because of our observation that
an increasing number of wet meadow restoration pro-
jects have been implemented in the region in recent
years. Based on our discussions with resource managers
involved in wet meadow restoration projects, it was ap-
parent to us that the outcomes of these projects have
been mixed. Furthermore, relatively little information on
the successes and failures of wet meadow restoration
projects seemed to be published or otherwise shared
among managers across the region. We conducted a sur-
vey of managers [23] that helped refine our research
questions and also provided evidence that many more
wet meadow restoration projects are likely to be imple-
mented over the next decade.
Search strategy
Electronic databases available through Northern Arizona
University’s Cline Library were the primary source. The
following databases were used:
 Academic Search Premier
 BioOne
 CSA
 Forest Science Database (Ovid)
 JSTOR
 Northern Arizona University 360
 ProQuest
 Wilson OmniFile
Additional sources of information included:
 Google Scholar (a search engine)
 Government and university websites and libraries
(e.g., USDA Forest Service’s TreeSearch)
 Unpublished reports (e.g., project monitoring
reports) were sought directly from individuals and
organizations responsible for restoration projects.
Searches
included the
following English language

The majority of the database searches were conducted
between July and October 2009, although additional
searches were made as late as October 2011. The latter
searches relied primarily on other sources than data-
bases, including Google Scholar and organizational web-
sites. They were also aided by personal contacts with
restoration practitioners that had developed over the
course of the review. Google Scholar was used to search
for new articles published after the date of the database
searches. Several searches were made using the custom
date range feature; only the first ten pages of search
results were examined.
Study inclusion criteria
Inclusion criteria were broken down into the four cat-
egories described below.
Ramstead et al. Environmental Evidence 2012, 1:11
Page 3 of 16
http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/1/1/11

Relevant subject(s) and geographic area
 Herbaceous and mixed herbaceous/scrub-shrub
dominated riparian ecosystems that are clearly
wetlands (e.g., dominated by obligate or facultative
wetland species in genera such as Carex spp., Juncus
spp., Salix spp., and Alnus spp.); meadows adjacent
to these wetlands that are more typically
characterized as mesic and that often have a diverse
flora characterized by facultative or facultative
wetland species, including a greater number of grass
and forb species than typically found in wet
meadows. Only studies conducted in Arizona,
California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico or Utah
were used for data extraction, although other
articles were retained through the full text filtering
stage for possible use in the assessment of study
limitations and future research needs.
Types of intervention
 Geomorphological and/or soil restoration techniques
(e.g., pond-and-plug, channel relocation, site
re-contouring, topsoil placement or removal).
 Hydrologic restoration techniques (e.g., check dams,
artificial riffle formations). However, articles that
focused entirely on stream or fisheries habitat
restoration, even if the stream flowed through a wet
meadow, were not included.
 Vegetation restoration techniques (e.g., seeding,
planting, herbivore exclusion).
 Modifications of adjacent areas (e.g., thinning of
adjacent upland forests).
Types of study
 All primary experimental and observational studies.
Types of outcome
 Geomorphological and soil outcomes such as
channel stability, presence/movement of nick points,
and development of redoximorphic soil properties.
 Hydrologic outcomes such as changes in water table
levels and flooding depth, duration and/or timing.
 Vegetation outcomes such as species composition,
percent cover and biomass, survival of planted
material, and presence or absence of invasive species.
 Biodiversity outcomes such as change in species
richness, evenness, or abundance due to restoration
treatments or grazing management changes.
Using a progressive filtering approach, Karissa Ramstead
first eliminated all articles that clearly did not meet our
inclusion criteria based solely on their titles. She next read
the abstracts (when available) of the remaining articles
and eliminated those that upon closer inspection also did
not meet the inclusion criteria. Finally, the articles
remaining after the abstract filter were read in full to
determine which were suitable for data extraction. All
articles identified by Ramstead for potential inclusion were
then reviewed by a second reviewer (James Allen).
Study quality assessment
After the articles were selected for review, Ramstead
rated them using Pullin and Knight’s Hierarchy of Qual-
ity of Evidence [24]. A Kappa test was then performed
using 15 randomly selected articles to assess the two pri-
mary reviewers’ (Allen and Ramstead) level of agreement
about their quality. In addition to this rating approach,
which is widely used in systematic reviews on conserva-
tion biology-related topics, we also developed the more
specific assessment approach that is described in the
Data synthesis and presentation section.
Data extraction
All articles that remained after full text filtering were
summarized in a master spreadsheet (Additional file 1:
Appendix A). Information extracted included study loca-
tion, outcome (in terms of how it related to our primary
and secondary questions), restoration intervention(s), re-
search/monitoring methods used to assess the project,
and results.
Data synthesis and presentation
Information on study location and on intervention(s)
employed was used to examine overall patterns across
the region in terms of where restoration has been done
to date and what practices have been most commonly
used. A two-part analysis was then done to assess the
evidence of restoration effectiveness.
For the first part of the analysis of restoration effect-
iveness, we compiled a list of six characteristics of func-
tional
wet
meadow
ecosystems,
which
we
also
considered to be useful criteria for assessing the success
of wet meadow restoration projects (Table 1). Our list
was modified from a previous one developed for south-
western
riparian
ecosystems
by
Medina
[16]
and
includes at least one characteristic that is directly related
to each of the five outcomes addressed by our primary
or secondary questions. The descriptions of each charac-
teristic were modified from the previous list to be more
specific to wet meadows and the new list was expanded
to include the types of evidence that we considered to
be useful for the assessment of each characteristic. Using
the descriptions and types of evidence as guidelines, we
then determined if each particular characteristic was
addressed and, if so, whether there was sufficient
Ramstead et al. Environmental Evidence 2012, 1:11

evidence presented to determine if the project was suc-
cessful in achieving the desired characteristic. For this
analysis, we used the five-point rating system shown in
Table 2 and assessed only those articles that presented
data for the operational-scale restoration projects, as
opposed to articles that presented data collected primar-
ily for research purposes. While we believe that most
wet meadow restoration practitioners would agree that
these six characteristics are important, they represent
our view of what constitutes successful restoration and
weren’t always listed as explicit goals in the articles we
assessed.
The second part of our analysis of restoration effect-
iveness consists of a narrative that synthesizes the results
of all the articles in relation to our primary and second-
ary questions, with separate subsections of the results
being devoted to the effects of restoration on (1) geo-
morphology, (2) hydrology, (3) soils, (4) vegetation and
(5) wildlife/biodiversity.

Other evidence: Visual observations of water levels,
evidence of flooding, and soil redoximorphic characteristics;
evidence of a transition to hydrophytic vegetation

Assimilation
Characterized by a high percentage of organic matter
in diagnostic soil horizons and/or a high rate of organic

important in newer restoration sites)
Best evidence: Measurements of soil organic matter content,
with comparison to suitable reference sites
Other evidence: Descriptions of soil horizons, soil color
assessments using Munsell soil color charts
Perennial Native
Vegetation
Perennial native vegetation covers ≥75% of the streambanks
and ≥50% of the floodplain and is comprised
predominantly of native, perennial species, especially
wetland graminoid species with extensive and highly
fibrous root systems (e.g., Carex spp.)

text review, but that we excluded from the data extrac-
tion phase for the reasons provided. We believe these
articles may be a useful resource for those with an inter-
est in wet meadow restoration outside of the American
Southwest. As we continued to work on the review, we
located an additional 8 articles that we included, bring-
ing the total to 48. All of these new articles were “grey
literature” that we became aware of through Google
Scholar searches or personal contacts.
Study description
The articles selected for inclusion in this review are di-
verse. Twenty-five of the included articles reported on
research that was directly or indirectly related to wet
meadow restoration and was published in peer-reviewed
journals. Another 14 articles are better described as
monitoring or project reports. The remaining 9 articles
are mostly conference proceedings and unpublished the-
ses or manuscripts.
Many articles only addressed one or two of our four
main outcomes (i.e. effects on geomorphology, hydrol-
ogy,
soils,
and
vegetation).
Geomorphology
was
addressed in 20 of the articles, hydrology in 18, soils in
8, and vegetation in 38. We found 13 articles that
addressed our secondary question regarding the effects
of restoration on wildlife/biodiversity.
Of the 48 articles selected for inclusion in this review,
a total of 26 operational-scale restoration projects (as
opposed to projects done strictly for research purposes
and generally implemented at smaller scales) were iden-
tified. Of the 26 projects, 10 were in Arizona, 3 were in
New Mexico, 12 were in California, and 1 was in Nevada
(Figure 1).
At least 32 different types of restoration or research
interventions were identified, with most being reported
in only 1 or 2 articles (Figure 2, note some types of
interventions are lumped into categories such as Other
and “Greenhouse” Studies). The most common interven-
tions were transplanting of vegetation, various forms of
grazing management (including exclosures), and use of
the pond-and-plug method for restoration of geomorph-
ology and hydrology.
Because of the wide variation in study design, study
quality, restoration/research interventions and the way
that intervention effects were reported (which in many
cases was primarily qualitative), we determined that the
use of formal statistical meta-analysis techniques would
not be practical. Two additional reasons why we opted
not to conduct a meta-analysis include: (1) the relatively
short-term nature of the studies, such that the true
effects of restoration treatments had not yet been fully
tested in many cases and (2) wide year-to-year variation
in environmental conditions, especially related to pre-
cipitation and its effect on flooding and water table
levels, that confounded treatment effects in otherwise
well-designed studies e.g., [26,27].
Study quality assessment
The variation in types of study referred to in the previ-
ous
section
was
reflected
in
their
quality
ratings
(Figure 3). The Kappa analysis conducted by Ramstead
and Allen showed 100% agreement between the two
reviewers based on the ratings initially assigned by Ram-
stead to 15 randomly selected articles (Cohen’s Kappa
statistic = 1.0). However, we did experience difficulties
deciding how to classify some articles, especially ones
that were primarily about modelling studies and to a
lesser degree some of the monitoring reports, that didn’t
seem to fit cleanly into the Pullin and Knight hierarchy.
Evidence of effectiveness
A summary of the evidence of restoration effectiveness
is presented in Table 4 for the operational-scale restor-
ation projects. Out of 162 individual ratings (27 studies
x 6 characteristics), 56 (34.6%) were rated “N/A.” Evi-
dence was presented more frequently for the effects of
restoration on perennial vegetation, stream morphology,
and streambank stability (i.e. for vegetation and geo-
morphology) than for the other three characteristics.
The characteristic examined least frequently was organic
matter assimilation, which was mentioned in just two of
the articles, only one of which presented quantitative
data.
None of the characteristics had an average rating
above 3 – the amount of evidence needed to demon-
strate partial success. Of greater importance than the
average ratings, however, are the individual ratings of ei-
ther 3 or 4. These ratings indicate where restoration

techniques have been effective in improving specific wet
meadow characteristics. Out of the total of 162 individ-
ual ratings in Table 4, there were 12 ratings of 4 (7.4% of
the total) and 51 ratings of 3 (31.5% of the total). In the
following subsections, we rely heavily on the evidence
with ratings of 3 or 4, along with supporting evidence
from the smaller, research-scale studies not included in
Table 4, to provide a synthesis of the evidence of restor-
ation effectiveness.
Geomorphology
Restoration of project site geomorphology was of central
importance in the majority of restoration projects we
reviewed. In most cases, this involved measures to re-
store or recreate a stream channel with a gradient, sinu-
osity, width-to-depth and entrenchment ratios, and
other characteristics that were similar to what existed in
the meadow prior to stream incision or other alteration.
Only in one case [25] did we find that the goal was to
eliminate a channel from a meadow and to establish a
sheet flow hydrologic regime.
The restoration practices employed varied depending on
the pre-project condition of the stream channel. In mea-
dows where the stream was not deeply incised, relatively
simple and inexpensive practices such as using locally avail-
able rocks and gravel to construct riffle structures e.g., [38]
were typically employed. Where streams were more deeply
incised, approaches such as “re-channelization” (i.e., recon-
figuring the existing channel or constructing a new one)
have been used [28,29,32].
In some of the most highly altered meadows, where
the original shallow and meandering stream had been
replaced by a deep, wide, and relatively straight gully,
the pond-and-plug technique has been employed. This
technique involves creating a series of earthen plugs in
the gully by using fill material from within and adjacent
to the gully (thereby creating alternating ponds and
plugs). Streamflow is then diverted into either a remnant

stream channel or a newly created one on the original
floodplain surface. This approach recreates part of the
geomorphology of the meadow, but also results in a
number of ponds that were not a feature of the original
landscape.
The
pond-and-plug
approach
was
first
employed approximately 15 years ago and has been used
with increasing frequency, particularly in the Sierra Nev-
ada region of California [51].
The articles that we reviewed present a considerable
amount of evidence that geomorphological restoration
techniques can be effective. Pre- and post-project longi-
tudinal profiles, stream and/or floodplain cross-sections,
characterization of streambed particle size, and qualita-
tive evidence (e.g., photo points) were the most fre-
quently used types of evidence. These types of evidence,
especially the stream profiles and cross-sections, can

effectively demonstrate that the post-project stream or
floodplain configuration was similar to specified con-
struction targets or to reference sites in relatively undis-
turbed meadows e.g., [25].
Probably the most important question regarding the
effectiveness of geomorphological restoration techniques
is how well they work in the long-term. Because most of
the articles and project reports we reviewed covered no
more than five years of post-project results, considerable
caution is warranted. The wet meadows of the region
contain many examples of failed efforts to restore stream
channels [52, personal observations], most of which are
believed to have failed during extreme flooding events.
During the relatively short post-project periods covered
by most of the articles and project reports included in
this review, there were several examples of flood-related
damage [25,35,53,54]. We have personally observed
post-project damage at some sites that has not yet been
reported in print, such as headcuts that have developed
at the Hoxworth Springs restoration site [30] and failed
log structures and gabions at Buck Springs Meadow and
Merritt Springs Meadow [23] and elsewhere on the
Coconino National Forest in northern Arizona.
While even seemingly well-designed projects have
been damaged or failed completely, there is also encour-
aging evidence that others have been able to withstand
truly extreme events. The best example of this may be
the large flooding event withstood by a pond-and-plug
project in 2009. The flood, which was determined to be
in the 500-year return interval category, impacted the

Big Meadows project [50]. Virtually no changes in chan-
nel morphology or to the plugs were observed despite
the flashy nature of this flood and the fact that it oc-
curred at a time of year (October) when the area was
dry and the plugs and channel may have been most vul-
nerable to damage.
Hydrology
The efforts to restore geomorphic processes described in
the previous section are primarily designed to return
streamflow, overbank flooding, ground water levels and
other aspects of a site’s hydrology back to close approxi-
mations of their former patterns. The best evidence of
success in achieving hydrologic restoration comes from
direct measurements of these variables pre- and post-
project, through the use of stream gauges, groundwater
monitoring wells and similar techniques. Relatively few
of the articles we reviewed used one or more of these
techniques or monitored for sufficient periods of time to
demonstrate substantial, long-term improvements in hy-
drology. Another challenge we faced was that, in some
cases where it appears that adequate hydrological data
were collected, the documents we reviewed did not
present the data in detail.
Most of the highest quality data we could find on hy-
drology came from pond-and-plug projects in California,
as well as the channel elimination project. One example
is the first-ever pond-and-plug project in California, at
Big Flat Meadow [29]. Monitoring of this project
included stream gauges above and below the project site
and a network of ground water monitoring wells along
transects perpendicular to the stream. Interpretation of
the data is somewhat confounded by the wide year-to-
year variation in precipitation, but the data appear ad-
equate to demonstrate that flow duration increased, peak
flows below the project site decreased, groundwater
levels increased, and stream temperature decreased as a
result of the project, all of which are positive results.
A clearer and more dramatic effect on groundwater
levels was reported for the Upper Halstead Meadow pro-
ject. This project sought to eliminate (fill in completely)
a gully and to restore a nearly level topography and a
sheet flow hydrologic regime to the meadow [25]. Moni-
toring wells in this meadow showed wide variations in
groundwater levels prior to restoration, with levels com-
monly dipping below 1.5 m during the growing season.
Groundwater levels post-restoration fluctuated very little
and remained within 20 cm of the surface for most of
the three growing seasons that were monitored. Post-
project groundwater levels were very similar to those
recorded at five reference sites.
While other articles or project reports presented evi-
dence of improvements in hydrology, most tended to do
so with less data and sometimes relied on a combination
of quantitative and qualitative evidence. An example is
Medina and Long [38], whose primary treatment was
the installation of riffle structures within a small creek
channel. They reported that the riffles reduced the aver-
age distance from the streambed to the bank from 63
cm to 45 cm. This in turn reduced the channel capacity
and promoted overbank flooding, while also creating a
streambank environment more conducive to the estab-
lishment of sedges. Accompanying pre- and post-project
photos, showing the development of lush vegetation,
provided supporting evidence of the project’s success in
restoring both geomorphology and hydrology.
Several efforts have been made to examine the effects
of restoration projects on hydrology using numerical
models [11,31,55-57]. These models have been devel-
oped and/or tested using data from project sites, and are
promising tools for improving both our understanding
of the effects of restoration and our ability to design bet-
ter projects in the future. In one such modeling study,
Hammersmark et al. [56] documented three types of
hydrological responses to a pond-and-plug project, in-
cluding (1) increased groundwater levels and subsurface
storage, (2) increased frequency and duration of flood-
plain inundation, and (3) decreased annual runoff (by 1-
2%) and duration of base flow (by 2 weeks). The
decreased runoff and duration of base flow was driven
by the raised channel bed and higher evapotranspiration
rates. In the simulations, additional water exited the site
as groundwater flow as opposed to stream flow.
Soils
Other than the earthmoving associated with geomorphic
restoration, we found little evidence of any direct ma-
nipulation of soils as part of restoration projects. Only in
the case of small-scale research projects e.g., [26,27] did
we encounter the use of soil treatments such as
fertilization or aeration. Overall, little work appears to
have been done on the effects of restoration on soil;
most of what has been done focuses primarily on the
effects of eliminating or reducing grazing.
Grazing clearly has caused considerable damage to wet
meadows in the region and elsewhere in the western
U.S. [58]. Therefore studies aimed at both quantifying
the impacts of grazing and understanding how soils re-
cover once it is reduced or eliminated can be very useful.
Examples of studies that have quantified impacts of
grazing are those of Flenniken et al. [59], Wheeler [60],
and Blank et al. [61]. Flenniken et al. [59] demonstrated
that grazing, even the very short-term grazing they
examined, can significantly decrease microchannel sinu-
osity and drainage density, thereby increasing flow
depths, total runoff and the potential for erosion.
Wheeler [60] showed that short-term but moderately
heavy grazing caused significant impacts to soil physical
Ramstead et al. Environmental Evidence 2012, 1:11
Page 10 of 16
http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/1/1/11

properties, but recovery was rapid once grazing was
eliminated. Blank et al. [61] demonstrated grazing effects
on soil nutrients, many of which increased in response
to grazing. While potentially important, we did not at-
tempt to include all the articles of this type on grazing
effects, since they are only indirectly related to the cen-
tral questions addressed in this review.
Studies such as [23,33] were designed to address more
directly the effects of reducing or eliminating grazing on
wet meadow soils, since protection from overgrazing is
one of the most common restoration measures taken in
the region. Holmquist et al. [33] found no differences in
soil compaction between sites subject to light grazing by
pack animals and ungrazed sites. Ramstead [23] exam-
ined two areas that had been subject to heavier grazing
and found that approximately 20 years of protection
from grazing resulted in generally less compacted soils
and greater organic matter content.
A final type of study of relevance to soils and wet
meadow restoration is more purely ecological in nature.
Studies of this type are designed to help determine the
relationship between site characteristics, including soils,
and the occurrence of plant species and/or community
types. Examples of such studies in the American Southwest
include those by Benedict, Castelli et al. and Long et al.
[2,9,62]. While these studies do not address the effects of
restoration projects directly, they have the potential to be
very useful for the design of future projects.
Vegetation
Of the 38 articles or reports that addressed vegetation in
some way, 25 focused directly on operational-scale pro-
jects. Similar to what we have reported above, the type
and quality of the data collected, as well as the length of
post-project monitoring data collection, is highly vari-
able. The evidence suggests, however, that generally
good revegetation success can be obtained if the hydrol-
ogy has been restored, the site is protected sufficiently
from grazing and, where applicable, proper revegetation
practices were used.
Wolf and Cooper [25] presented some of the most
detailed information we found for an operational-scale
project. Their results indicated good short-term survival
(~97%) of the 34,250 seedlings that were initially planted
at the site. Multivariate analyses showed a clear trend in
the overall plant community towards dominance by
wetter-site species and towards a greater resemblance to
reference
sites.
Their
results
or
observations
also
demonstrated some of the problems that can be encoun-
tered, however, including a substantial loss of planted
seedlings following a large flooding/erosional event and
slow growth of seedlings planted in the filled gully,
where the fill had been excessively compacted. Both of
these issues have reportedly been addressed successfully
by refilling the damaged areas with a lighter mix that
consisted of 70% soil and 30% sawdust.
When combined with data collected in the field, the
modeling studies described above also provide good qual-
ity evidence of changes in vegetation caused by restoration
projects. Hammersmark et al. [31], for example, used data
from 170 vegetation plots established post-project, com-
bined with their hydrologic model, to demonstrate that
the habitat suitability for wetland plant species increased
throughout a large portion of the project site.
Some of the evidence from restoration projects is
qualitative but nonetheless compelling, including obser-
vations by experienced personnel and photo points that
depict the same sites pre- and post-project. Good exam-
ples of photo point evidence can be seen for the Red
Clover/McReynolds Creek [42]; Photos 2 and 3] and
Pacheta Creek projects [38]; Figures 1 and 5), both of
which show impressive development of wet meadow
vegetation in the post-project photos.
In cases where the physical site conditions are suitable
and grazing has been eliminated or reduced, active revege-
tation practices (e.g., transplanting of plugs or seeding) may
not be required. Ammon and Stacey [6], for example, found
that long-term (~30 year) protection of a riparian meadow
from grazing resulted in a substantial recovery of willows
(Salix spp.) and greater vertical vegetational diversity as
opposed to a portion of the same meadow that is still sub-
ject to grazing. No other restoration practices other than
exclusion of livestock grazing were reported for this
meadow. Similar results were reported by Shulz and Leinin-
ger [5] who noted that, after 29 years of rest from grazing,
the riparian vegetation was so dense that it concealed the
stream from view. In their review papers, both and Platts
and Rinne [63] and Elmore and Kaufmann [64] stated that
protection of riparian sites from grazing has repeatedly
been shown to result in the recovery of vegetation in west-
ern U.S. Wet meadows appear to be no exception.
Where they have been used, the results obtained using
active revegetation practices have been mixed. The suc-
cesses and problems encountered with planted seedlings
in one project have already been mentioned above [25]. In
a project that involved both substantial earth-moving and
active revegetation [28] all project goals were reportedly
met except for those associated with revegetation. While
the approximately 1/3 of the project area located furthest
downstream was beginning to show successful Nebraska
sedge (Carex nebrascensis) and Baltic rush (Juncus balti-
cus) establishment, there was still an overall average of
64% bare ground 3 years post- restoration.
Restorationists could benefit from a number of studies
that have been conducted in the region that focus either
on plant species propagation or species-site relation-
ships, several of which we have included in this review.

Wildlife/biodiversity
The response of wildlife and biodiversity to wet meadow
restoration efforts has been investigated both directly,
through changes in species presence and/or abundance,
and indirectly, through changes in habitat characteris-
tics. While generally positive effects have been noted, in
some cases the data are confounded in ways that limit
the ability to draw clear conclusions and in other situa-
tions the effects may be at least partially detrimental.
Studies that reported clear increases in animal species
presence and/or abundance following restoration have
been published for benthic macroinvertebrates [64], avi-
fauna [42] and bats [47].
Changes in habitat quality have been reported for taxa
as diverse as birds, small mammals, and fish. Ammon and
Stacey [6] investigated the effects of protection of a wet
meadow site from grazing on nest predation. The recovery
of willows provided better cover, resulting in substantial
declines in nest predation for both ground and above-
ground nesting birds. The biggest impact was on ground
nests, which had an 83% success rate on the restored site
and only 36% in the portion of the same meadow that was
still subject to grazing. Chambers and Lesh [unpublished
manuscript[29]] found that Mogollon voles (Microtus
mogollonensis) were captured more frequently and runway
densities were higher inside exclosures located within sev-
eral wet meadows in northern Arizona. Other articles have
reported positive effects of restoration on habitat quality
for trout, such as decreased water temperature [13,42] and
improved channel bed characteristics [36].
An example of a study with confounding effects is the
Clarks Creek Project [45]. Increases in small mammals
and avifauna were noted at the site after project imple-
mentation, but similar increases were noted at a nearby
control site. Also, a decrease in the number of fish in
the restored channel was observed post-project, but the
decrease appears to have been caused by beaver dams
that reduced access to the channel, rather than a decline
in habitat quality of the restored reach. Borgmann et al.
[67] reported confounding effects on butterflies, which
increased in richness and abundance at the project site
the year after implementation but also increased at
nearby control sites. Confounding effects were also
reported for another project in the Sierra Nevada region,
in this case due to the difficulty of separating changes in
bird captures at the restoration site from similar changes
noted at a much larger network of capture sites in the
area [44].
Potential negative impacts were noted for at least one
pond-and-plug project, where two non-native species had
become established in some of the ponds [44]. The two
species (green sunfish; Lepomis cyanellus and bullfrog:
Rana catesbeiana) are both known to prey on native fish
and amphibians. Although no specific detrimental impacts
were reported, this may be one aspect of the pond-and-
plug approach that would benefit from additional re-
search. Permanent ponds are not a natural feature of most
wet meadows and their presence may alter animal species
communities in unintended ways.
Reasons for variation in effectiveness
We cannot pinpoint any instances where there was vari-
ation in the effectiveness of projects that were truly
comparable in terms of ecological setting, disturbance
history, and treatments applied. In reality each project
was unique. The fact that each meadow and stream
complex is unique - and therefore requires site-specific
treatments - was mentioned by several of the restoration
practitioners and researchers that we contacted during
the course of this review.
In a more general sense, however, there are many fac-
tors that can be identified that cause variation in project
effectiveness. In the Upper Halstead Meadow Project,
for example, the initial effectiveness of the project was
reduced by the choice of fill material and by compacting
the material excessively. This resulted in both increased
susceptibility to erosion and to reduced growth of seed-
lings planted in the fill material [25]. It is clear from the
literature on restoration of other types of ecosystems
that variations in project design, quality of construction,
choice of planting material, level of training and supervi-
sion of the personnel implementing the project, and
many other variables associated with project implemen-
tation can have a large effect on the results e.g., [68].
In addition to factors related to project design and im-
plementation, year-to-year variation in environmental
conditions such as precipitation, temperature, timing of
snowmelt, and flooding can also have a large impact on
projects. The two main effects of this type of variation
are damage to projects caused by major events such as
large storms/floods e.g., [25,50,54,69] and difficulties in
interpreting research or monitoring results caused by
more typical variation among years in water table levels
or other environmental conditions [26,27].
Review limitations
Key limitations of this review include (1) the scarcity of
studies that were designed to address our specific ques-
tions
in
a
rigorous,
quantitative
fashion,
(2)
the
Ramstead et al. Environmental Evidence 2012, 1:11

inaccessibility of data (versus general descriptions of the
results) for most of the projects that included monitor-
ing components, (3) wide variation in methods of data
collection, analysis and presentation, which effectively
ruled out a meta-analysis, (4) year-to-year environmental
variation that confounded the results in some cases, and
(5) the relatively short duration of post-project data col-
lection for most of the studies we found.
Another critical concern is that many restoration pro-
jects appear to have been implemented over the years,
going back at least to the 1930’s [50], yet little or no in-
formation is available on many (and probably a majority)
of them. Our review would have been stronger if the ef-
fectiveness of more wet meadow projects had been
investigated over the years or, in cases where they were
investigated, if the results had been made more widely
available. Although speculative, we suspect that the
results of projects that failed are less likely to have been
published, and yet much can be learned from failed pro-
jects. Also, if most failed projects were not reported in
accessible formats, then our results may be biased by a
tendency to report more frequently on successful pro-
jects. None of the articles we found reported a total fail-
ure to achieve the stated objectives, although one
reported on damage that may have resulted in failure if
it hadn’t been effectively repaired [25].
A broader search strategy may have yielded additional
articles that would have been useful to us. In particular,
a search strategy that encompassed more completely the
literature on grazing management in riparian areas e.g.,
[64] and the restoration of riparian habitat for fisheries
e.g., [63] may have been valuable in the context of this
review. We also recognize that important work has been
done on wet meadow restoration in other regions, much
of which could be relevant to restoration efforts in the
American Southwest.
Reviewers’ conclusions
While much of the evidence is not of the highest quality
and therefore considerable caution is warranted, it is
nevertheless apparent that progress has been made over
the past 20 years in wet meadow restoration. In particu-
lar, especially important contributions have been made
in restoring the highly degraded wet meadow systems
that are characterized by deep, wide and relatively
straight gullies. There is substantial evidence that the
pond-and-plug approach, which was first implemented
approximately 15 years ago, is an effective technique for
restoring most aspects of these systems, albeit at the
cost of creating new features (ponds) that are not neces-
sarily natural features of wet meadows.
Important lessons continue to be learned about wet
meadow restoration practices, including those aimed at
establishing
suitable
floodplain
and
stream
channel
morphology, a more natural hydrologic regime, and
more effective revegetation. The damage that continues
to plague many projects, such as erosion and structure
damage caused by floods, demonstrates that we still have
much to learn about project design and implementation.
It also suggests we have to recognize that post-project
vigilance and a commitment to ongoing maintenance
will be needed to ensure long-term success.
Implications for management
One of the most important implications for managers is
that not enough information on the projects carried out
to date has been documented and shared. During the
course of this review, we encountered several projects in
the field or on websites for which no substantive docu-
mentation of any kind could be located; we expect that
this is common throughout the region. Many opportun-
ities to learn both from successes and failures have un-
doubtedly been lost over the years due to this failure to
document projects and to make the information widely
available. Making more project information available
through websites can be a powerful tool. The Feather
River Coordinated Resource Management group’s web-
site (http://www.feather-river-crm.org/) is perhaps the
best example in the region of this approach to sharing
information on wet meadow restoration.
We understand that there are serious constraints on man-
agers’ time and resources, but allocating additional effort to
project documentation, including more formal and longer-
lasting monitoring programs, is an important need that
should be addressed. One approach that might help in this
regard is for practitioners to work with scientists from gov-
ernment agencies, local universities and colleges, and other
organizations. When this type of collaboration has happened
in the past it appears to have been effective e.g., [47].
Implications for research
More research on wet meadow ecosystem processes, the
ecology of individual plant and animal species, and spe-
cific restoration and management techniques clearly
would be beneficial. We have developed a list of research
questions that would be worthwhile to address. While
many of these have been investigated to some degree
already, there is much more to learn. Although they are
listed within each section in order of priority from our
perspective, we realize that research priorities may vary
depending on the predominant types of disturbance being
addressed within a given area, as well as the management
priorities of government agencies and other landowners.
