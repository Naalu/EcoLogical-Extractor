Wildland fire effects on understory plant
communities in two fire-prone forests
Daniel C. Laughlin and Peter Z. Fule´
Abstract: Our understanding of wildland fire effects on understory plant communities is limited because of a lack of re-
peated measurements before and after lightning-ignited fires. We examined vegetation responses to a surface fire in a pon-
derosa pine forest and a mixed-severity fire in a spruce–fir–aspen forest using before–after, control–impact (BACI) study
designs. We hypothesized that the surface fire would stimulate plant species richness and minimally alter community com-
position, but that the mixed-severity fire would decrease richness and significantly alter composition. In ponderosa pine
forests, total species richness and plant cover increased slightly because of annual and biennial forb and grass establish-
ment in soils where duff layers were reduced by the surface fire. In spruce–fir–aspen forests, total species richness and
plant cover were similar in burned and unburned forests after 2 years, although annual and biennial forbs and graminoids
increased significantly in the burned area. Plant community composition was altered by both fires. Wildfires may indi-
rectly influence the understory plant community through the mediating effects of overstory basal area and litter depth. Fire
effects on plant species richness and cover were weaker than effects due to environmental factors. Managers should antici-
pate increases in both native and non-native ruderal species following landscape-scale fires.

Introduction
Wildland fire is an important disturbance process in forest
ecosystems throughout the world (Agee 1993; Bond and van
Wilgen 1996). However, our understanding of plant com-
munity responses to lightning-ignited wildfire in old-growth
forests is limited, because repeated measurements taken be-
fore and after fires are rare (van Mantgem et al. 2001). Data
on wildfire effects in relict forests (i.e., forests within the
range of historical variability due to minimum anthropo-
genic disturbance; Stephens and Fule´ 2005) are especially
valuable, because these fires have effects akin to those of
natural processes prior to the onset of regionwide fire exclu-
sion in the late 1800s (Swetnam and Baisan 1996). Thus, an
evaluation of wildfire effects on plant diversity, abundance,
and community composition, fuel loads, and forest structure
will improve our ability to predict future responses to fire.
When assessing fire effects, it is useful to partition direct
effects from indirect effects that are mediated through
changes in other ecosystem components. As illustrated in
Fig. 1, many factors can influence plant species richness
(Grace 1999). Fires may directly affect species richness by
killing individual plants and by stimulating seed germination
(Whelan 1995, Bond and van Wilgen 1996). Understory
plant abundance can influence richness via competitive ex-
clusion and recruitment limitation (Grime 2001). Overstory
tree basal area can be an important driver of understory pro-
duction (Moore et al. 2006), thereby indirectly driving rich-
ness patterns (Laughlin and Grace 2006). Deep duff layers,
which are largely a function of high tree densities and many
years since the last fire, may inhibit plant establishment and
reduce species richness (North et al. 2005). Topographic

slope and aspect are also important factors, because topogra-
phy influences moisture availability and solar heat load
(Miller 1995, Keddy 2005). Finally, fires can substantially
change overstory structure and fuel loads, thereby having
the potential to indirectly influence species richness.
Wildfires can also have significant effects on plant com-
munity composition. Fires often increase the abundance of
annual and biennial plants (Whelan 1995), and fires can po-
tentially lead to an increase in non-native species richness
(Crawford et al. 2001; Keeley 2006; Dodson and Fiedler
2006). Compositional shifts toward abundance of non-native
species are of particular concern to managers who seek to
conserve native ecosystems.
We compared burned and unburned sites in Grand Can-
yon National Park, an important reference ecosystem for
southwestern North America because of its never-harvested
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex P. & C. Laws.)
and spruce–fir–aspen forests (White and Vankat 1993; Ste-
phens and Fule´ 2005). We hypothesized that surface fire
would stimulate species richness in ponderosa pine forests
(Bond and van Wilgen 1996), but that mixed-severity fire
would decrease species richness in spruce–fir–aspen forests
(Turner et al. 1997, 1999). To test these predictions, we
evaluated the multivariate model in Fig. 1, which hypothe-
sized that fire and topography affect overstory tree basal
area, duff depths, and understory plant abundance to pro-
duce the patterns of richness across landscapes. In addition,
we predicted that compositional changes following surface
fire would be minimal in ponderosa pine forests, but that
compositional
changes
would
be
significant
following
mixed-severity fire in spruce–fir–aspen forests. To evaluate
these predictions, we used permutational multivariate analy-
sis of variance (MANOVA) to analyze the multidimensional
community responses.
Methods
Study systems
The study sites are located in northern Arizona on the
North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park (Fig. 2). The
ponderosa pine forests are dominated by P. ponderosa and
Quercus gambelii Nutt. (Gambel oak). The spruce–fir–aspen
forests are dominated by Picea engelmannii Parry ex Eng-
lem. (Englemann spruce), Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.
(subalpine fir), and Populus tremuloides Michx. (quaking as-
pen) (White and Vankat 1993). Soils on the North Rim were
derived from Kaibab limestone. Mean annual precipitation at
the North Rim ranger station (Bright Angel, elevation
2542 m) from 1948 to 2005 was 65.8 cm with a mean an-
nual snowfall of 371 cm.
North Rim forests have remained near the range of his-
toric variability (Landres et al. 1999) with respect to forest
structure, community composition, and ecosystem function
(Fule´ et al. 2002, 2003a, 2003b). These forests have never
been commercially harvested, they have a very limited live-
stock grazing history, and a number of fires have occurred
throughout the 20th century on some sites (Fule´ et al.
2003a, 2003b). Few exotic species have been found in the
study area (Laughlin et al. 2004). As a result, these forests
offer a place to evaluate how plant community structure is
affected by wildfire under conditions of minimal anthropo-
genic impacts.
Fire-scar analyses indicated that the ponderosa pine for-
ests used in this study burned frequently before 1880 (6–
9 year mean fire return interval; Fule´ et al. 2003a). In con-
trast, the spruce–fir–aspen forests at Little Park historically
had a mixed-severity fire regime, which consisted of a mix-
ture of low-severity surface fires on warm, south-facing
slopes (31 year mean fire return interval) and infrequent,
patchy, stand-replacing fires elsewhere (before 2003, 120–
230 years had passed since the last fire) (Fule´ et al. 2003b).
Fires were excluded after 1879, with only two fire dates rep-
resented by only three fire-scarred trees found by Fule´ et al.
(2003b). However, the absence of fire since 1879 in spruce–
fir–aspen forests is not necessarily out of the historical range
of variability, because these forests can experience long in-
tervals between fires (Agee 1993; Fule´ et al. 2003b).
In 2003, the National Park Service managed (i.e., allowed
to burn, as opposed to suppressed) several wildland fire use
(WFU) fires (Fule´ and Laughlin 2007). The Powell Fire was
started by lightning on 15 June 2003 and burned 1460 ha on
Powell Plateau. The last large fire on Powell Plateau was in
1987, and this site had burned at least three times after 1879
(the date of regionwide fire exclusion). The 2003 fire burned
primarily as a surface fire, backing southward into the pre-
vailing winds until it burned out on 20 August 2003. The
fire burned all 36 plots on Powell Plateau (Fig. 2; see plot
descriptions below). The fire generally thinned trees from
below; mortality occurred primarily within the smallest di-
ameter class (Fule´ and Laughlin 2007). The 25 permanent
plots on the nearby Rainbow Plateau (which has the same
forest type, elevation, and topography) did not burn in 2003
and, therefore, were useful as control plots (Fig. 2). The last
large fire on Rainbow Plateau was in 1993, and it has
burned at least three times after 1879; thus, Rainbow Plateau
had burned more recently than Powell Plateau.
The Poplar Fire was started by lightning on 4 September
2003 and was managed as a WFU fire. The fire burned
4813 ha, spreading northeast and driven by the prevailing
winds, with a mix of surface and crown fire behavior. Part
of the fire was suppressed near the boundary of the park,
and the remainder burned out by 1 November 2003. The
fire burned 18 pre-established plots in an area of the park
(Fig. 2) that had not burned since at least 1879. Fire-induced
mortality occurred across all diameter classes, and >90% re-

ductions in tree basal area occurred on 3 of the 18 burned
plots (Fule´ and Laughlin 2007). A range of burn severities
was encountered; however, our plots in the Poplar Fire were
located at the northern edge, whereas relatively more severe
burning occurred to the south of the plots (according to fire-
severity maps on file at Grand Canyon National Park). Adja-
cent permanent plots at this site did not burn in the Poplar
Fire and likely had not burned since prior to 1879; thus,
these plots were useful as control plots (Fig. 2).
Data collection
Permanent plots (0.1 ha; 20 m  50 m) were established
in the study area to examine forest structure, composition,
and fire histories (Fule´ et al. 2002). Plot locations spanned
an elevational gradient from 2200 to 2800 m and repre-
sented a range of slopes and aspects. In the ponderosa pine
forest, we established 61 plots (25 plots on Rainbow Plateau
and 36 plots on Powell Plateau) in 1998. Twelve of these
61 plots were used as unburned reference plots by Laughlin
et al. (2004) in a study on effects of the Boundary Fire in
1999 on Fire Point. All 36 plots on Powell Plateau burned
in 2003. In the spruce–fir–aspen forest, we established
36 plots prior to the fire. Eighteen of these 36 plots burned
in the 2003 Poplar Fire. We resampled the 61 plots in the
ponderosa pine forest and the 36 plots in the spruce–fir–as-
pen forest 2 years after the fire in 2005.
Understory plant communities were sampled using belt
and point intercept transects. Complete species lists were
made of all vascular plants (forbs, grasses, sedges, shrubs,
and young trees below breast height (<1.4 m)) within two
10 m  50 m belt transects per plot. Each species found in
the study area occurred on zero, one, or two belt transects
per plot; these data were used for the analysis of community
composition and the assessment of relative abundance. Anal-

yses based on presence or absence of species on two large
belt transects per plot are sensitive to only major changes in
composition and, therefore, are a conservative estimate of
change. A 50 m point intercept transect was established in
the center of each belt transect, and presence of vascular
plants and trees below breast height was recorded at a point
every 30 cm along each transect. Plant cover (%) was calcu-
lated by dividing the number of points containing a plant by
the total 332 points per plot. Nomenclature and nativity clas-
sification follows USDA Natural Resource Conservation
Service (NRCS) (2006). Species were classified into four
life habits: annual and biennial forbs (ruderal species), per-
ennial forbs (including wildflowers and a few cacti, ferns,
and subshrubs (i.e., forbs with woody bases)), graminoids
(grasses and sedges), and woody species (shrubs and trees).
We identified, tagged, and measured the diameter at
breast height (DBH) of all trees >15 cm DBH in the entire
0.1 ha plot, and trees between 2.5 and 15 cm DBH in one-
quarter of the 0.1 ha plot. Details of forest sampling can be
found in Fule´ et al. (2002). We measured basal area to eval-
uate overstory–understory relationships. We also measured
duff (Oe + Oa) depth (cm) on four permanent 15.24 m planar
transects. The duff layer is the combined fermentation and
humus layers located between the fresh litter layer and min-
eral soil (Brown 1974).
We measured topographical slope and aspect, because
these can influence plant community structure. We used a
topographical index of moisture availability (Batek et al.
1999) that ranges from –4 (i.e., xeric, steep, south-facing
slopes) to 4 (i.e., mesic, steep, north-facing slopes). This in-
dex transforms aspect, a circular variable, into a linear vari-
able and also incorporates slope steepness, because this
affects the impact of solar radiation. We used this index to
represent the collective effects of slope and aspect on mois-
ture availability for subalpine vegetation.
Data analysis
Baseline data are usually unavailable for evaluating the
effects of unplanned disturbances, making it difficult to ex-
amine the effects of large-scale processes with well-replicated
experimental designs (Weins and Parker 1995; van Man-
tgem et al. 2001). This research is an observational study
taking advantage of wildland fires that burned across pre-
existing monitoring plots. We used a before–after, control–
impact (BACI) design, because we could measure nearby
unburned sites. The scope of inference is limited to these
particular sites and fires. There are known statistical draw-
backs to these designs (Weins and Parker 1995; van Man-
tgem et al. 2001), including a lack of randomization, which
is essential to overwhelm important confounding factors.
Weins and Parker (1995) suggested using covariance anal-
ysis as an attempt to remedy the lack of randomization.
Therefore, we used structural equation modeling (see de-
tails in the following) to incorporate the important covary-
ing factors in our analysis of fire effects on species
richness.
We used a series of tests to examine whether the burned
and unburned plots differed from one another in community
composition before the fire, in community composition after
the fire, and in rate of community change between pre- and
post-fire measurements. Site comparisons within years were
made with permutational MANOVA using DISTLM soft-
ware (Anderson 2005). The P values were calculated by per-
muting the observations 9999 times, so no assumptions
regarding the distributional form of the data were required.
Species that occurred on <5% of the plots were omitted
from the analyses of community composition but were in-
cluded in univariate analyses of species richness (McCune
and Grace 2002).
Comparisons of rate of change between pre- and post-fire
community composition required us to account for autocor-
relation between repeated measurements of permanent plots.
We accounted for autocorrelation between repeated meas-
urements by calculating the multivariate Bray–Curtis dis-
tance between the pre- and post-fire data for each plot (this
is analogous to calculating the difference between two val-
ues in a paired t test). Bray–Curtis distance (Di,h) between
plots i and h with p species is

where a is the abundance of the jth species. Dissimilarities,
species richness, and plant cover were analyzed with the
Wilcoxon two-sample test (using SAS JMP IN version
5.1.2; SAS Institute Inc. 2004). We followed these tests of
overall community composition with tests of composition
within the four life habits. We also used Wilcoxon two-sam-
ple tests to compare species richness and plant cover be-
tween sites within years. A retrospective power analysis for
testing the null hypothesis of no difference in plant cover
prior to the fire between sites in the ponderosa pine forests
determined that the confidence interval for power ranged
between 0.05 and 0.76, and the number of plots needed for
a significant result given the known effect size and variabil-
ity was 482 plots (using SAS JMP software). We obtained
similar results for other variables, illustrating the inherent
variability within a given treatment site.
We used the indicator species analysis (ISA; Dufreˆne and
Legendre 1997) routine in PC-ORD to identify individual
plant species associated with recently burned and unburned
forests. We used a hierarchical approach in which we first
compared treatments with years combined, and then, we
compared years within treatments. We restricted our atten-
tion to species with P < 0.05 (assessed using Monte Carlo
randomizations with 1000 permutations) and indicator val-
ues (INDVAL) >25 (INDVAL = relative abundance  rela-
tive frequency; INDVAL ranges from 0 to 100; Dufreˆne and
Legendre 1997).
Structural equation modeling
Univariate analyses can sometimes be misleading if im-
portant covariates are not included in the analysis (Weins
and Parker 1995; Grace 2006). Therefore, we used structural
equation modeling (SEM) to gain a multivariate perspective
about how fire affects species richness while statistically
controlling important covarying factors. SEM is an exten-
sion of regression and path analysis that can be used to
model multivariate relations and to test multivariate hypoth-

eses (Grace 2006). We used postfire measurements to evalu-
ate the general model (Fig. 1) against observed data from
ponderosa pine and spruce–fir–aspen forests. The model rep-
resents what we believed to be the most plausible structural
relations based on a priori knowledge. We acknowledge that
not all causal processes that act in this system are repre-
sented in Fig. 1. Rather, our objective was to determine
whether the data were consistent with the expectations of
the proposed model.
We used maximum likelihood estimators and 2 goodness-
of-fit measures to evaluate model adequacy with Mplus
software (Muthe´n and Muthe´n 2005). Model fit statistics
evaluate the discrepancy between the covariance structure
of the observed data and the covariance structure implied
by the model. Therefore, good fitting models yield small
2 values and large P values (>0.05), indicating no signifi-
cant difference between model and data.
Nonlinear relationships were modeled using composite
variables (Grace 2006). Composite variables estimate the
combined effects of first- and second-order terms on a single
response variable. Polynomial relationships are illustrated in
the model results with a ‘‘+/–’’ to indicate that the relation-
ship is nonlinear. Finally, we calculated the so-called ‘‘total
effects,’’ which are the total sum of direct and indirect path-
ways from the predictors to richness. Indirect effects equal
the total sum of the products of all path segments from a
predictor to richness. Estimates of these effects and their
standard
errors
were
calculated
with
Mplus
software
(Muthe´n and Muthe´n 2005).
Results
Ponderosa pine forest
In the ponderosa pine forests, neither total species rich-
ness (Wilcoxon two-sample; Z = 0.8 and P = 0.42) nor plant
cover (Z = 0.4 and P = 0.71) differed between treatments
prior to the wildland fires (Table 1). The results of the struc-
tural equation modeling analysis suggest that the fire had
weak direct and indirect effects on species richness.
The a priori structural equation model did not fit the data
adequately (2 = 17.6, df = 9, and P = 0.04), suggesting that
important pathways in the hypothesized model were miss-
ing. The addition of a quadratic relationship between duff
and richness significantly improved model fit. The direct
pathway from fire to species richness was not statistically
significant at the 0.05 level (Z = 1.93 and P = 0.054); how-
ever, it may be ecologically significant, so we retained it in
the model. Moreover, including this path significantly im-
proved overall model fit (indicated by a reduction in 2 >
3.84). The final model fit the data well (2 = 20.7, df = 15,
and P = 0.15; Fig. 3). The structural equations explained
44% of the variance of species richness and 32% of the var-
iance of plant cover.
The results of the final model implied that (i) richness
was highest where plant cover was high, (ii) richness was
highest at intermediate duff depths, (iii) the fire had a weak
nonlinear
indirect
relationship
with
richness
mediated
through its reduction of duff depths, and (iv) the fire was di-
rectly associated with higher plant cover (Fig. 3).
The structure of the model suggests that the fire indirectly
affected richness via two main pathways. The standardized
indirect effect for the pathway fire ? duff depth ? richness
was –0.11. The standardized indirect effect for the pathway
fire ? cover ? richness was 0.12. The opposing signs of
these effects suggest that these effects were offsetting. How-
ever, both pathways were marginally nonsignificant (both
Z > 1.93 and 0.051 < P < 0.054), suggesting that these indi-
rect pathways were weak.
Changes in total richness were due primarily to changes
in annual and biennial and graminoid species richness,
which increased significantly in the burned site compared
with the unburned site (Table 2). Species richness of life
habits in the treatments became more similar to one another
after the fire, likely because the fire on Powell Plateau
shifted the composition of the community towards similarity
with Rainbow Plateau, which burned in 1993.
Burned and unburned forests differed in composition be-
fore and 2 years after the fire, but community composition
changed significantly more on the burned plots (Table 2).
Annual and biennial plants were the only group to exhibit a
significant rate of change in composition between burned
and control plots (Table 2). This result was consistent with
the ISA, which determined that 7 of the 15 indicators of re-
cently burned forest were annual and biennial species
(Table 3), five of which were native (Chenopodium lepto-
phyllum (Moq.) Nutt. ex S. Wats., Chenopodium spp., Col-
linsia parviflora Lindl., Phlox gracilis (Hook.) Greene, and
Polygonum douglasii Greene), and two of which were non-
native (Bromus tectorum L. and Lactuca serriola L.). The
frequency of Bromus tectorum on the burned Powell Plateau
changed from 42% to 100%, whereas its frequency on Rain-
bow Plateau only changed from 56% to 68%.
Spruce–fir–aspen forest
In the spruce–fir–aspen forests, neither total species rich-
ness (Z = –0.2 and P = 0.81) nor plant cover (Z = 0.7 and P
= 0.48) differed between treatments prior to the wildland
fires (Table 1). The results of the structural equation model-
ing analysis suggest that the fire had weak indirect effects
on species richness.
The a priori structural equation model fit the data well
(Fig. 4; 2 = 4.0, df = 4, and P = 0.41), suggesting that the
initial model was sound. The structural equations explained
53% of the variance of species richness and 22% of the var-
iance of plant cover. Model results implied that (i) richness
was lowest on northern slopes and highest where plant cover
was high; (ii) conifer basal area had a positive direct associ-

ation with richness and a negative indirect association with
richness mediated through plant cover; and (iii) the fire had
no direct association with richness, but the fire was indi-
rectly associated with richness by decreasing conifer basal
area. The structure of the model suggests that the fire indi-
rectly affected richness via reductions in conifer basal area,
but none of these indirect effects were significant, suggest-
ing that these pathways were weak.
Changes in total species richness were driven by increases
in annual and biennial and graminoid species richness
(Table 4). Burned and unburned forests did not differ in
composition prior to the fire, but they did differ after the
fire; community composition changed significantly more on
the burned plots (Table 4). Annual and biennial plants ex-
hibited the greatest change in composition between burned
and control plots (Table 4). This result is further supported
by the ISA (Table 5), which determined that five of the
seven indicators of recently burned forest were native annual

Discussion
Ponderosa pine forests
Lightning-ignited surface fires can have complex effects
in old-growth forests. We hypothesized that surface fire
would stimulate species richness and plant cover in ponder-
osa pine forest understories (Bond and van Wilgen 1996).
Model results imply that species richness and plant cover
did increase slightly 2 years after the fire, yet these short-
term effects were weak. Generally, species richness is con-
trolled by many interacting factors (Grace 1999). In ponder-
osa pine forests, surface fire, duff depth, and plant cover can
directly affect richness. However, surface fire may have ad-

ditional indirect effects on richness mediated through duff
depth and plant cover (Fig. 3).
Following the fire, richness was high where plant cover
was high, likely because species extirpation is less likely
when abundances of species are high (Rosenzweig 1995).
Plant cover was stimulated by the fire, which may have re-
sulted from a short-term pulse of available nitrogen (Fisher
and Binkley 2000). Thus, the fire may promote diversity in-
directly by stimulating productivity.
Interestingly, in this study, species richness was highest at
moderate duff depths, suggesting that intermediate duff
depths allow for greater coexistence of species that require
exposed mineral soil for establishment (e.g., annual and bien-
nial forbs) and of species that tolerate deeper organic forest
floor layers (e.g., perennial forbs and subshrubs) (Grime
2001). Thus, the postfire stimulation of annual plants may be
due to the greater availability of a mineral soil seedbed. In
contrast, more severe fires that eliminate the duff layer might
reduce richness and create conditions where only ruderal spe-
cies thrive. Thus, a low-intensity fire that moderately reduces
deep duff layers may indirectly promote species coexistence.
The forest overstory apparently affects richness indirectly
through its effect on plant cover (Fig. 3). Pine trees intercept
light (Naumburg and DeWald 1999), intercept precipitation
(McLaughlin 1978), produce abundant needle fall, and can
compete for soil nutrients (Riegel et al. 1995), all of which
influence herbaceous productivity. In contrast, the oak can-
opy appears to have a nonlinear relationship with plant
cover, where cover was greatest at intermediate oak abun-
dance. Finally, topographic slope affected richness only in-
directly, because oak abundance was greatest on steeper
slopes.
We hypothesized that compositional changes following
surface fire would be minimal in ponderosa pine forests.
Community composition changed only slightly in response
to the fire. Native herbaceous species can tolerate low-inten-
sity surface fires if the buds are below the ground or if be-
lowground carbohydrate reserves are large enough to survive
aboveground consumption. Similar to the results of Turner
et al. (1997), the majority of species detected after the fire
were present before the fire, although some species in-
creased in frequency and abundance. Most notably, native
annuals such as Polygonum douglasii, Chenopodium spp.,
Collinsia parviflora, Chenopodium leptophyllum, and Phlox
gracilis were indicators of recently burned pine forest. The
increase in annual species after fire has been noted in eco-
systems worldwide (Bond and van Wilgen 1996).
The native plant community in the ponderosa pine forest
was unable to resist increases in non-native species. The
slight increase in graminoid species richness may be entirely
explained by a marked increase in the frequency and abun-
dance of the non-native invasive Bromus tectorum. This spe-
cies has been present on Powell Plateau since as early as
19412 and was present before the fire (Gildar et al. 2004).
Therefore, the increase in Bromus tectorum, not its arrival,
is cause for concern. Bromus tectorum was also an indicator
of burned mixed conifer forest on the North Rim (Huisinga
et al. 2005) and has expanded following fire in Kings Can-
yon National Park, California (Keeley 2006). Therefore, It is
likely that with the continued use of fire as a management
tool at this elevation, Bromus tectorum may become more
prevalent.
Spruce–fir–aspen forests
We hypothesized that mixed-severity fire would decrease
plant abundance and diversity in spruce–fir–aspen forests
(Turner et al. 1997). However, plant cover and species rich-
ness were similar to preburn levels 2 years after the fire.
These results are very similar to findings in Pinus contorta
Dougl. ex Loud. (lodgepole pine) forests in Yellowstone Na-
tional Park, where herbaceous plants rapidly recolonized the
severely burned areas (Turner et al. 1997, 1999).
Although total richness appeared unchanged in the burned
forest after 2 years, the SEM analysis implied that fire indi-
rectly affected richness by decreasing conifer basal area,
which caused two offsetting effects. First, conifer basal area
was weakly positively related to richness. Therefore, fire-in-
duced tree mortality indirectly reduced richness. This likely
represents the loss of shade-tolerant species, such as Pyrola

secunda L., because of the greater abundance of light reach-
ing the forest floor after the fire (Lyon and Stickney 1976).
Second, plant cover, which was positively related to species
richness, was low under dense conifer stands because of the
competitive dominance of canopy species (Moore et al.
2006). Therefore, fire-induced tree mortality indirectly in-
creased richness, because plant abundance increased. Thus,
the total effect of mixed-severity fire on total richness was
zero, because the two indirect pathways were offsetting.
These indirect effects must be interpreted with caution be-
cause of their low standardized effect sizes. In contrast to
the ponderosa pine forests, duff exhibited no relationship to
richness in spruce–fir–aspen forests. Richness was generally
higher on southern slopes, likely a result of decreased snow
packs and a slightly longer growing season on southern as-
pects at high elevations. In short, richness appears to be
under multivariate control in spruce–fir–aspen forests, but
fire effects after 2 years appeared to be weak.
We hypothesized that compositional changes would be
significant following mixed-severity fire in spruce–fir–aspen
forests. Significant changes to spruce–fir–aspen community
composition occurred after the fire. Postfire recolonization
occurred predominantly by vegetative resprouting of peren-
nial species (Turner et al. 1997), but we also detected signif-
icant annual and biennial species recruitment. Composition
remained very different from predisturbance conditions after
2 years. Young Abies lasiocarpa trees declined in frequency
and abundance after the fire, because many seedlings and
saplings were killed. However, five native annual forbs
were indicators of recent fire in the spruce–fir–aspen forests,
including Androsace septentrionalis, Chenopodium spp.,
Gayophytum diffusum, Polygonum douglasii, and Pseudog-
naphalium macounii. Pseudognaphalium macounii has been
detected as an abundant species in soil seed banks (Korb et
al. 2005), which is likely the reason why this species be-
came abundant after the fire. In a grassland study, Andro-
sace septentrionalis was generally more abundant in burned
than unburned prairie (Archibold et al. 2003). The increase
in native annual and biennial forbs in both ponderosa pine
and spruce–fir–aspen forests is biologically significant, be-
cause these are the pioneer species that may maintain soil
stability, that add organic matter to the soil that was con-

sumed by the fire, and that may ameliorate site conditions
for further plant establishment.
Management implications
Fire is an important disturbance process in western North
American forests (Agee 1993). Fuel-reduction treatments
and prescribed fire alone will not be enough to restore forest
structure, composition, and function. Wildland fire use is
often an ecologically and economically viable management
strategy for affecting larger and more remote landscapes
(Dale 2006). However, managing fire regimes in an era of
global change and non-native species invasions poses signif-
icant challenges to land managers. Our results suggest that
fire effects on plant species richness in both ponderosa pine
and spruce–fir–aspen forests were generally weaker than ef-
fects due to other biotic and abiotic factors. Thus, wildland
fires will likely not degrade native plant diversity and abun-
dance in fire-prone systems. However, wildfires can alter
plant community composition. For example, fires may pro-
mote the establishment of Bromus tectorum, which might
lead to future changes in community assemblages. We cau-
tion that these results should not be extrapolated to different
systems, because they reflect responses following two spe-
cific fires. Nevertheless, these results do provide support for
the continued use of wildland fire where natural processes
can still operate at landscape scales.
