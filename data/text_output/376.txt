NOTE / NOTE
A new, proportional method for reconstructing
historical tree diameters
Jonathan D. Bakker
Abstract: Accurate methods of reconstructing historical tree diameters from increment cores are important because di-
ameter is used in allometric equations to predict stand characteristics and to study stand dynamics. The conventional
reconstruction method assumes that the pith is in the centre of the stem. This is often incorrect, as evidenced by a pith
increment index quantifying the deviation between the geometric radius of the stem and the chronological radius of a
core. I propose a new method which assumes that growth is proportional around the stem and, unlike the conventional
method, cannot yield negative historical diameters. These methods were evaluated by calculating the deviations between
reconstructed diameters and historical diameter measurements from 164 ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex P. &
C. Laws.) trees from permanent plots in Arizona and New Mexico. Deviations varied with pith increment index for the
conventional method but not for the proportional method, and varied with tree age for both methods at one site. These
methods could be used in tandem, with the proportional method applied where the increment from outer ring to pith is
measured and the conventional method applied where this increment cannot be measured.
Résumé : Il est important que les méthodes utilisées pour reconstituer le diamètre passé des arbres à partir de carottes
soient précises parce que le diamètre est utilisé dans des équations allométriques pour prédire les caractéristiques des
peuplements et étudier leur dynamique. La méthode de reconstitution conventionnelle assume que la moelle est dans le
centre de la tige. Cela est souvent erroné comme le montre un indice d’accroissement de la moelle qui quantifie l’écart
entre le rayon géométrique de la tige et le rayon chronologique d’une carotte. L’auteur propose une nouvelle méthode
qui assume que la croissance est proportionnelle autour de la tige et qui, contrairement à la méthode conventionnelle,
ne peut produire de diamètres passés négatifs. Ces méthodes ont été évaluées en calculant l’écart entre les diamètres
reconstitués et les diamètres mesurés dans le passé sur 164 tiges de pin ponderosa (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex P. & C.
Laws.) dans des places échantillons permanentes en Arizona et au Nouveau-Mexique. Les écarts variaient en fonction
de l’indice d’accroissement de la moelle pour la méthode conventionnelle mais pas pour la méthode proportionnelle et
ils variaient avec l’âge des arbres pour les deux méthodes dans une station. Ces méthodes pourraient être utilisées en
tandem en appliquant la méthode proportionnelle lorsque l’accroissement est mesuré du dernier cerne annuel jusqu’à la
moelle et la méthode conventionnelle lorsque cet accroissement ne peut être mesuré.

Introduction
Tree diameter is used in allometric equations to estimate
many variables, including tree biomass (Gholz et al. 1979;
Omdal et al. 2001), understory production (e.g., Bojorquez-
Tapia et al. 1990), and forest carbon stocks and fluxes
(Jenkins et al. 2003). Studies of stand structural dynamics
(Foster et al. 1996) also often require the reconstruction of
historical tree diameters. Accurate diameter reconstructions
are therefore important for understanding and modeling for-
est dynamics and for making management decisions.
A stem cross section provides the complete radial growth
series of a tree but can only be obtained by killing it, which
is unacceptable in most situations (Rozas 2003). In addition,
results from studies of cross sections may not be applicable
in the field, as they require information about stem geometry
that cannot be obtained without sectioning the tree (e.g.,
Biging and Wensel 1988). Increment cores provide a non-
destructive and operationally feasible method of obtaining
growth data. Multiple cores per tree can increase the accu-
racy of diameter growth estimates (Matérn 1961; Iles 1974),
but also greatly increase the processing time, effort, and core
storage space required. I sought a method of reconstructing
historical diameters that could be applied to a single incre-
ment core per tree, regardless of where around the stem it
was obtained.
Much attention has been devoted to methods for correctly
identifying tree age (Duncan 1989; Villalba and Veblen 1997;
Wong and Lertzman 2001; Rozas 2003; Clark and Hallgren
2004; Gutsell and Johnson 2004) but less attention has been

given to methods for quantifying radial growth increment
(e.g., Biging and Wensel 1988) or reconstructing historical
tree diameter (Dolph 1981). In this paper I describe a new
method for reconstructing historical diameters and compare it
with the conventional method by calculating the deviations
between diameters reconstructed by each method and histori-
cal diameter measurements of trees on permanent plots.
Description of reconstruction methods
Stem geometry
The pith, or chronological centre of a stem (sensu Norton
et al. 1987), often does not correspond to the geometric cen-
tre (Williamson 1975; Biging and Wensel 1988; Singleton et
al. 2003). Analysis of the deviation between these two points
requires a stem cross section (e.g., Singleton et al. 2003).
However, an increment core can be used to describe the dif-
ference between the chronological and geometric radii using
a pith increment index (PII):

where IP is the radial increment from outer ring to pith
(chronological radius) on an increment core, and DIAMIB is
the inside-bark diameter at coring height (twice the geomet-
ric radius). PII is positive when the chronological radius is
greater than the geometric radius, zero when the chronologi-
cal radius is equal to the geometric radius, and negative
when the chronological radius is less than the geometric ra-
dius. If the pith is off-centre, the chronological radius varies
around the stem, and PII therefore varies among cores taken
at different locations around the stem.
The conventional and proportional methods
Conventional diameter reconstructions involve measuring
the radial increment between the outer ring and the historical
date of interest (IH) and subtracting twice this measurement
from the inside-bark diameter (e.g., Fulé et al. 1997). This
method assumes that the chronological and geometric cen-
tres are equal and that radial growth has been symmetric.
When PII is positive, it can yield negative reconstructed di-
ameters.
The proportional diameter-reconstruction method involves
multiplying the current diameter by the proportion of radial
growth that occurred before the historical date of interest
(G). G is calculated as

This method assumes that growth has been proportional around
the stem, which is not always so (Norton et al. 1987), but is
a less restrictive assumption than those of the conventional
method. In particular, no assumption is made about the loca-
tion of the pith relative to the geometric centre of the stem.
Also, reconstructed diameters are always positive, since G ≥0.
An example (Fig. 1) illustrates these methods. An incre-
ment core that intersects the pith of a tree with a current
inside-bark diameter of 40 cm is used to reconstruct the
tree’s historical diameter (10 cm; in practice this is un-
known) at the date of interest. The stem is assumed to be cir-
cular and growth to have been proportional around the stem.

Fig. 1. Idealized stem cross sections illustrating the reconstruction of historical diameter using the conventional method (DBHHC) and
proportional method (DBHHP). Reconstructions are based on the current inside-bark diameter (outer circle; 40 cm in these examples)
and a single increment core (thick vertical line). Increments are measured on the core from the outer ring to the historical date of
interest (IH; required for both methods) and from the outer ring to the pith (chronological radius; IP; required for the proportional
method). The historical diameter (inner circle) is 10 cm in these examples but in practice is unknown. The pith increment index (PII)
is a measure of the difference between the chronological radius of the core and the geometric radius of the stem, and G is the propor-
tion of radial growth that occurred before the historical date of interest. If the pith and geometric centre of the stem are equal (A),
both methods correctly reconstruct the historical diameter. If the pith is off-centre (B and C), the broken lines indicate where the chro-
nological and geometric radii are equal. The proportional method correctly reconstructs the historical diameter regardless of where the
core is taken, while the conventional method can underestimate it (B) or overestimate it (C).

If the chronological and geometric centres are identical,
growth was radially symmetric and both methods yield the
correct reconstructed diameter (Fig. 1a). Similarly, both
methods yield the correct reconstructed diameter if the pith
is off-centre but the core is taken where the chronological
and geometric radii are equal (broken lines in Figs. 1b and
1c). The points where these radii are equal cannot be identi-
fied in the field, however, so it is unlikely that cores will be
taken at these points. For cores taken elsewhere around the
stem, the proportional method yields the correct recon-
structed diameter, since G is unaffected by PII (Figs. 1b and
1c). In contrast, diameters reconstructed by the conventional
method vary with core location, as illustrated by the ex-
tremes presented here. The conventional method underesti-
mates the historical diameter if PII is positive (Fig. 1b) and
overestimates it if PII is negative (Fig. 1c).
Case studies
Data collection
The conventional and proportional reconstruction methods
were tested on 102 trees from a permanent plot in Arizona
and validated on 62 trees from permanent plots in New Mex-
ico. These plots were established in the early 1900s as part
of a long-term study of growth and yield in ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex P. & C. Laws.) (Pearson 1923).
The Arizona plot (COC S1A; hereinafter COC) is in the Fort
Valley Experimental Forest, Coconino National Forest, 10 km
northwest of Flagstaff. The New Mexico plots (CIB S1A
and CIB S2A; hereinafter jointly referred to as CIB) are in
the Cibola National Forest, 30 km south of Magdalena. His-
torical data are stored in the Fort Valley Archives, US Forest
Service Rocky Mountain Research Station, Flagstaff, Ari-
zona.
Contemporary measurements were gathered as part of a
larger project (Moore et al. 2004). For this study I used data
from all live ponderosa pine trees that (i) had been tagged
and measured in 1914 or 1915 (COC and CIB, respectively),
and (ii) had cores on which IP could be measured (i.e., no
broken cores or heart rot). Sampled trees were ≥100 years
old and spanned a 70-cm range of diameter at breast height
(DBH; 137 cm) (Table 1). Small trees were not included
because historical measurements were restricted to trees
≥9.14 cm DBH.
Cores were extracted at stump height (40 cm) because the
larger project required a more accurate assessment of tree
age than was possible with cores taken at breast height.
Cores were mounted, sanded, and cross-dated using standard
dendrochronological techniques (Stokes and Smiley 1968).
For cores that missed the pith, the pith location and number
of rings between the inner ring of the core and the pith
(hereinafter rings-to-pith) were estimated with a pith locator
(Applequist 1958). Use of a pith locator is rapid and effi-
cient but assumes that radial growth has been symmetric and
constant near the centre of the tree (Rozas 2003). IP and IH
were measured to the nearest millimetre. On cores that missed
the pith, IP was measured by positioning the pith locator on
the core and measuring from the centre of the pith locator to
the outer ring. PII and G were calculated for each increment
core (Table 1).
Outside-bark diameter at stump height (DSHOB) was mea-
sured and inside-bark diameter (DSHIB) was calculated us-
ing Myers’ (1963) bark-thickness equations for old-growth
ponderosa pine. DSHIB for each tree at the historical mea-
surement date (1914 for COC, 1915 for CIB) was recon-
structed using the conventional and proportional methods,
and reconstructed diameters were then converted to DBHOB
for comparison with historical diameter measurements.
Conversions were made using Myers’ (1963) bark-thickness
equations and a DSH–DBH regression developed from other
ponderosa pine trees on the Coconino and Cibola National
Forests (J. Bakker, M. Moore, and A. Sánchez Meador, un-
published data):

I used this regression because published equations (e.g., Hann

Comparisons with historical diameters
Reconstructed diameters were compared with actual diam-
eters measured in 1914–1915. The deviation (Dm) between
the diameter reconstructed by each method (DBHHm) and the
historical diameter (DBHH) was calculated as

Percent Dm is >0 when the historical diameter is overesti-
mated and <0 when it is underestimated.
Wilcoxon signed ranks tests were used to determine whether
mean %Dm was significantly different from 0 at each forest.
Chi-square goodness-of-fit tests determined whether the ob-
served proportion of trees for which each method performed
best (i.e., had smallest %D) differed significantly from
those expected by chance at each forest.
I postulated that %Dm might be related to PII, tree age,
and rings-to-pith. Since PII is a proxy for the deviation be-
tween the chronological and geometric centres of a stem,
%DC should be related to it but %DP should not (Fig. 1).
While correlation with historical diameter was accounted
for, age–diameter relationships are weak for ponderosa pine
(Pearson 1950) and %Dm might be related to tree age (i.e.,
the age at stump height when historical diameters were mea-
sured). The ability to identify the location of the pith de-
creases as the distance between the inner ring and pith
increases (Rozas 2003), so %DP might be related to rings-to-
pith (since it requires the radial increment from outer ring to
pith), while %DC shoud not.
I used model selection to quantify the importance of ex-
planatory variables (for details, see Burnham and Anderson
(2002; section 4.4) and Johnson and Omland (2004)). The
three variables (PII, tree age, rings-to-pith) were combined
in all seven possible combinations for each method at each
forest. The model containing all variables was assessed for
overall significance; if it was not significant, further testing
was not warranted. If it was significant, the fit between
model i and the data was examined by calculating an Akaike
Information Criterion (AICc) score normalized as an Akaike
weight (wi). The relative importance of a variable is Σwi
(maximum = 1) for all models containing that variable, and
the model-averaged coefficient for the variable is the sum of
the products of the coefficient from model i and wi (Burnham
and Anderson 2002).
Results
At COC, the conventional method overestimated historical
diameter (DBHH) by 8.3% (Wilcoxon T+ = –884.5, p = 0.003;
Table 2), while the proportional method overestimated it by
only 0.1% (T+ = 198.5, p = 0.510). The proportional method
performed best for 64.7% of trees (χ2 = 8.82, p = 0.003).
Percent DC was negatively related to PII (Fig. 2a) and tree
age (Fig. 2b), but there was little evidence of a relation with
rings-to-pith (Table 3). Percent DP was not related to PII
(Fig. 2c) or rings-to-pith, but was negatively related to tree
age (Table 3, Fig. 2d).
At CIB, the conventional method underestimated DBHH
by 1.3% (T+ = 207.5, p = 0.147; Table 2), while the propor-
tional method underestimated it by 8.6% (T+ = 678.5, p <
0.001). The proportional method performed best for 53.2%
of trees (χ2 = 0.26, p = 0.612). Percent DC was negatively re-
lated to PII (Fig. 2a) but was not related to tree age (Fig. 2b)
or rings-to-pith (Table 3). Percent DP was not related to any
of the explanatory variables (Table 3, Figs. 2c and 2d).
Discussion
The case studies provide support for using the propor-
tional method to estimate historical tree diameter. Diameters
reconstructed via the proportional method were unrelated to
PII (Table 3, Fig. 2c), while those reconstructed via the con-
ventional method (Fig. 2a) were overestimated when PII was
negative (chronological radius < geometric radius) and under-
estimated when PII was positive (chronological radius > geo-
metric radius).
The fact that the proportional method is not affected by
core location (Fig. 1) has practical advantages during field-
work. For example, a common practice is to measure stump
height on the uphill side of the tree but to obtain increment
cores from the side slope to minimize reaction wood and get
the most accurate assessment of growth possible from a sin-
gle core (Stokes and Smiley 1968). If cores are to be used to
reconstruct historical diameters via the proportional method,
they could be taken where stump height is measured, or else-
where around the stem if necessary.
Deviations between historical and reconstructed diameters
differed between forests (Table 2), indicating that variables
other than core location were also important. While this dif-
ference may reflect variation in growth form between sites, it
may also relate to tree age, which was an important explana-
tory variable at COC but not at CIB (Table 3). More young
trees were sampled at COC (27 trees vs. 1 tree <20 years old
at CIB), and historical diameters of young trees were more
likely to be overestimated, especially via the conventional
method (Fig. 2b). The reason for this overestimation is un-
clear, but may relate to juvenile growth rates and patterns.

for these young trees much more than it affected the range
of %D values for older trees (Fig. 2d).
The conventional method is most likely to yield negative
diameters when reconstructing small historical diameters, but
reconstruction methods could not be compared on small trees
because historical diameter measurements were only made
on trees with DBH ≥9.14 cm. An assessment of the implica-
tions of the reconstruction method on stand characteristics
would require a detailed study of all trees on a site, includ-
ing these smaller trees, and would require multiple cores per
tree to account for the effect of core location on diameters
reconstructed using the conventional method.
Deviations between reconstructed and historical diameters
were not related to rings-to-pith (Table 3), possibly because
most cores missed the pith by only a few rings (Table 1). For
cores that miss the pith by a large amount or lack the arcs of
inner rings (Rozas 2003), the proportional method cannot be
used because IP cannot be measured accurately. Although
the conventional method is affected by core location, it re-
mains useful for these cores and for others that do not reach
the pith because of heart rot, exceptionally large stem diam-
eter, or other factors.
I suggest that these methods be used in tandem, with the
proportional method applied where the increment from outer
ring to pith is measurable and the conventional method ap-

Note: Larger summed Akaike weights (∑wi; maximum = 1) indicate
increased importance of a variable relative to the other variables in the
model set (for details, see Burnham and Anderson (2002) and Johnson
and Omland (2004)). Summed Akaike weights and coefficients were not
calculated for the proportional method at CIB, as the model containing all
variables was not significant (p = 0.989). The model containing all variables
was significant for the proportional method at COC (p = 0.0006) and for
the conventional method at COC (p < 0.0001) and CIB (p = 0.0001).

proach should be less biased than using the conventional
method alone, although the implications of combining the
two methods in a study should be further studied.
