ecosystems that involved the Forest Service during the period 2000 to 2007 – an increase of 192% compared with the

Abstract.
Broadcast seeding is one of the most commonly used post-fire rehabilitation treatments to establish ground
cover for erosion control and mitigation of non-native plant species invasions. Little quantitative information is available
on overall trends of post-fire seeding expenditures and seed mixes used over time in forested ecosystems in the western
USA. We reviewed scientific articles, government publications and unpublished documents as well as USDA Forest
Service Burned Area Reports to determine trends in post-fire seeding in forested ecosystems over time. Of 1164 USDA
Forest Service Burned Area Reports, 380 contained information on seeding treatments conducted in forested ecosystems.
A review of 40 papers and 67 Burned Area Reports reporting species seeded between 1970 and 2007 revealed a trend
of increasing use of native species, annual cereal grains and sterile-grass hybrids, with natives dominating seed mixes.
According to 380 Burned Area Reports with data on costs and area seeded, total post-fire seeding expenditures have

increased dramatically, with the most frequently used being

Agropyron) and cereal barley (Hordeum vulgare L.); non-native

annual ryegrass continued in popularity as well, however.
Between 2000 and 2006, cereal barley and slender wheatgrass
continued as the most commonly seeded species, followed by
mountain brome and western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii
(Rydb.) A. Lo¨ve).
Since the 1990s, use of annual non-natives, annual cereal
grains and sterile-grass hybrids has increased, exceeding that
of perennial non-natives in the years 2000–06. This increase
is likely due to the hypothesis that annual non-native species
(e.g. annual ryegrass), annual cereal grains and sterile-grass
hybrids provide quick cover in the first year after fire and then
die out to let native vegetation reoccupy the site in subsequent
years (Beyers 2004). Some evidence demonstrates their ability
to quickly increase cover. Barclay et al. (2004) and Keeley
(2004) showed that successful exclusion of non-natives
resulted when annual non-native seeded species produced high
cover in the first year (Barclay et al. 2004; Keeley 2004).
These studies and others have also shown the ability of these
species to rapidly die off (Barclay et al. 2004; Keeley 2004;
Loftin 2004; Kuenzi et al. 2008). However, other studies have
shown that these species can persist (Conard et al. 1991;
Sexton 1998; Schoennagel and Waller 1999), thereby leading
to the ineffective recovery of native species (Conard et al.
1991; Sexton 1998; Schoennagel and Waller 1999) even many
years after fire (Conard et al. 1991). These results suggest that
seeding annual non-natives or sterile cereal grains may delay
the recovery of native flora in some circumstances. Further
research and longer-term quantitative monitoring are needed
to assess more thoroughly any persistent effects seeding with
annual cereal grains or sterile-grass hybrids may have on
native plant recovery.

paper records were unobtainable (Robichaud et al. 2000).
Therefore, costs and area totals reported are minimum estimates.
We limited our review to reports for projects that used seeding in
forested ecosystems. Post-fire rehabilitation assessment reports
from federal land-management agencies under the Department
of Interior were not available in electronic format. In addition,
many reports contained only information on what was planned,
not what was actually implemented. Because of these com-
plexities, burned area assessment data from these agencies were
excluded. Results reported on costs and area seeded are there-
fore solely representative of trends occurring on lands managed
by the USFS. All BAER spending and treatment costs were
adjusted to constant 2009 US dollars (Federal Reserve Bank
2009).
Results and discussion
What are trends in seeding of specific species,
especially native species, over time?
Out of the 1164 USFS Burned Area Reports, 380 contained
information on seeding treatments conducted in forested eco-
systems specifically, of which only 67 reported sources and
species selected for seeding. Together, 40 reviewed papers and
67 Burned Area Reports provided information regarding species
seeded on 122 fires across the western United States from 1970
to 2006 (Fig. 1).
According to reviewed papers and reports, 22 non-native and
12 native species were seeded on at least three or more burned
areas in the period 1970 to 2006 (Table 1). Perennial non-native
species were used almost exclusively from ,1970 to the early
1980s (Fig. 1). However, on many fires in California and the
Pacific Northwest (for which data were missing in Burned Area
Report assessment), annual ryegrass was seeded extensively
during this period (Richards et al. 1998; Robichaud et al. 2000;
Beyers 2004). During the 1980s, use of annual grasses, annual
cereal grains, sterile-grass hybrids and native species increased,
although perennial non-natives remained as the dominant seeded
species. By 1990, the use of perennial non-natives declined
as seed mixes incorporating annual cereal grains or sterile-grass
hybrids or a combination of both increased. Since the late 1990s
and especially since 2000, seed mixes throughout the western
USA shifted to mixes consisting of native species and annual
cereal grains or sterile-grass hybrids, with native species being
seeded on approximately three times as many fires as non-
natives and almost twice as many fires as annual cereal grains or
cereal-grass hybrids (Fig. 1).
The most frequently used species in the 1970s were yellow
sweetclover (Melilotus officinalis (L.) Lam.), orchardgrass
(Dactylis glomerata L.), timothy (Phleum pratense L.), sheep
fescue (Festuca ovina L.), and perennial ryegrass (Lolium
perenne L.) (Table 1). In the 1980s, perennial grasses such as
orchardgrass and smooth brome (Bromus inermis Leyss.) still
dominated seeded mixes, but annual ryegrass (Lolium perenne
ssp. multiflorum (Lam.) Husnot) was used almost as often.
Use of slender wheatgrass (Elymus trachycaulus (Link) Gould
ex Shinners), mountain brome (Bromus marginatus Ness ex
Steud.) (both natives), cereal rye (Secale cereal L.) and
intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium (Host)

advisable, although well-designedlong-term monitoring is needed
to determine any long-lasting effects seeding may have.
Conclusions and management implications
Our review of post-fire seeding practices in the western USA
over the last four decades revealed a trend of increasing use
of native species, annual cereal grains and sterile-grass hybrids,
with native species dominating seed mixes in recent years.
Cereal barley, slender wheatgrass, mountain brome and western
wheatgrass were identified as the most commonly selected
species for reseeding wildfires since 2000. The decline in the use
of perennial non-native species is encouraging to many biolo-
gists, as those species have been shown to disrupt recovery of
native plant communities. Current choices for seeding are not
without concern, however. Annual cereal grains or sterile-grass
hybrids, although generally short-lived, can occasionally persist
into subsequent years, which may result in delayed recovery of
native species. The short- and long-term effects of using native
species remain uncertain. Priority should be given to research
quantifying the effects of using native species, annual cereal
grains and sterile-grass hybrids on burned landscapes.
Total USFS BAER seeding expenditures have increased
substantially in the last decade. The expenditures approximately
correlate to the increased area burned, but in fact, smaller
proportions of burned areas have been seeded annually. The
smaller area seeded likely reflects rising concerns over effects of
seeding treatments. The success of post-fire seeding treatments
in achieving specified rehabilitation objectives remains uncer-
tain, yet millions of dollars continue to be spent annually on
post-fire seeding. The ecological risks and economic costs
imposed by seeding may be lessened through use of alternative
rehabilitation methods shown to be more effective (e.g. mulch-
ing) and prioritisation of burned areas seeded to those immedi-
ately threatened by soil erosion and invasion of non-native
species.
