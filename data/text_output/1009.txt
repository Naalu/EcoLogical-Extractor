Abstract: A cut-to-length (CTL) harvest system using a harvester and forwarder has been recently
introduced in northern California (USA) for thinning young (<25 years old) redwood forests
(Sequoia sempervirens (Lamb. ex D. Don) Endl.). However, the severity of CTL damage to residual
trees in this forest type are unknown. The goals of this study were to (1) determine the location, size,
and number of scars resulting from CTL harvesting and (2) compare scar size differences between
redwood clumps and individual trees in two units. Most scars occurred on trees located near the
forwarding trails. Wider and longer scars were associated with clumped trees (9.1–12.2 cm wide
and 28.1–46.2 cm long) as compared to scars on individual trees (8.1–9.5 cm wide and 16.7–31.3 cm
long), and 16–32% of the residual trees were scarred. Determining a minimum scar size will deﬁne
the severity of stand damage; larger scars result in a longer time until closure. However, counting all
the smaller scars that result from CTL harvesting will result in a large number of counted damaged
trees. Therefore, we suggest that scars smaller than 5–10 cm width are acceptable on coastal redwood
after CTL thinning.

1. Introduction
Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens (Lamb. ex D. Don) Endl.) is a coniferous species which grows from
central California to southwest Oregon. Its range extends inland from the Paciﬁc coast 80 km. Thinning
in redwood stands provides wood for beautiful products and a source of revenue for landowners [1].
Redwood is one of the most productive timber species in North America because it is closely associated
with the presence of marine fog, grows on productive soils, has a long growing season, and has a rapid
growth rate [2]. In addition, stand thinning is one method to control stand density to promote tree
productivity. Thinning in redwood stands increases tree diameter and height growth because of less
competition from surrounding vegetation [3]. Thinning activities can reduce a ﬁre hazard, increase
residual stand growth [4], change wildlife habitat, increase forest health [5], and yield intermediate
revenues [6]. One distinctive characteristic of redwood trees is that a proportion of trees occur as
a clump, resulting in a cluster of trees [4]. This clumpy growth form may make it difﬁcult to use
mechanical harvesting equipment to thin stands without producing a large amount of damage to the
tree cambium.
In many areas, mechanized harvesting used for forest thinning operations have increased in
popularity because they are effective tools to manage overstocked stands and restore ecosystem

services. However, the range of stem sizes, particularly large diameter trees, makes thinning in
redwood stands difﬁcult with mechanized systems. Thus, in the past, logging operators previously
harvested redwoods using labor-intensive manual felling. Over time, coastal redwood forest stand
structure has shifted in composition from a majority of the stand consisting of old growth trees to
overstocked stands of young trees (<25 years old). This shift in stand structure makes the trees more
accessible to harvesting using newer mechanized methods.
One mechanized method for harvesting is the cut-to-length (CTL) system, which is comprised
of a harvester and forwarder. This equipment is optimal for cutting small to medium-sized trees
(from 10 to 41 cm diameter at breast height (DBH)), but may have a high initial costs during forest
operations [7,8]. Harvesters fell and process trees in the stand, and place the branches and foliage
on the soil surface. The trees are then left on the trail for the forwarder to pick up and move to a
landing. One concern with using CTL systems has been the potential impact to the residual stand.
In particular, CTL harvesting can cause a signiﬁcant amount of damage to the residual trees, which
may subsequently impact tree growth and future timber values [9]. In western Oregon, 47years-old
Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.)
scar damage from CTL operations did not affect tree growth directly [8] but provided a pathway
for fungi to cause wood defects, such as pitch rings, resulting in a loss of tree volume [10]. Similar
damage was noted in the Romanian Carpathians [11], the northeastern USA [12], and in the Amazon
region [13]. Furthermore, although Kiser [14] reported the growth responses of coastal Douglas-ﬁr
from mechanical damage was not signiﬁcant between damaged and undamaged trees, there was a
reduction in crown length after scarring. These studies indicate that stand damage from cut-to-length
harvest operations can be a signiﬁcant cause of tree growth decline or increased disease resulting in
lower quality wood.
Han and Kellogg [15] deﬁne scar resulting from mechanical harvest operations as the removal
of wood ﬁber from the tree stem. Each scar location (height from ground level) and size (width,
height, and depth) is recorded. Scar size is an important characteristic that deﬁnes the amount, extent,
and impact of CTL harvest operations. However, it is difﬁcult for landowners to agree on an absolute
deﬁnition of acceptable size scar so that tree growth is not impeded [10]. For example, the minimum
acceptable scar size can vary from 6.5 cm2 to 464 cm2, and the severity of the tree damage usually
depends on the scar location (e.g., roots, stem, or crown) [10,16]. Han [10] reported that helicopter
logging resulted in damage high on the bole (5.4 m), followed by damage lower on the bole when
using skyline harvest systems (2.0 m). Harvesting with CTL systems usually results in tree damage
at approximately 1.6 m high on the bole while tractor logging tree scars were most often located
approximately 0.9 m above the soil surface. In the Carpathian Mountain, CTL harvesting produced
stand damage at a height of less than 1 m on 65% of the trees [11].
The severity of scar damage depends on several factors, such as harvest system [10,17], operator
proﬁciency [18], harvest season [19,20], and tree species [8].
In a loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.)
stand using whole-tree (WT) and CTL harvest systems, Lanford and Stokes [17] reported that WT
harvesting had 40% more scars that were 10 times larger than CTL harvest systems. Furthermore,
Limbeck-Lilienau [20] noted that, in mountainous terrain, 43% of the residual trees were damaged
during WT harvesting, while only 20% of the trees were damaged in the CTL units. Residual stand
damage frequently occurs during timber transport (i.e., skidding and forwarding) [10,17,21]. Froese
and Han [22] found that when using a CTL system, damaged trees were often located near forwarding
trails and were not distributed randomly throughout the stand. In addition, the timing of harvest
operations can help minimize stand damage. For example, winter operations in Austria caused less
damage than summer logging [20] while Cline et al. [19] reported the greatest number of damaged
trees occurred between summer and fall.
We could ﬁnd no published studies that evaluate CTL harvesting in redwood forests and the
subsequent evaluation of tree damage. However, since this harvest system is now being proposed for
many redwood stands in northern California, it is critical to understand the number of trees damaged,

the level of damage (scar size), and the location of damage on the tree. Therefore, the objectives of this
study were to determine (1) scar characteristics and their distribution on the bole, (2) scar size on both
tree clump and individual trees, and (3) best management practices to reduce stand damage.
2. Materials and Methods
Data for this study were collected from two units in the Crannell tract, a Green Diamond Resource
Company forest in northern California, USA. One unit is located on road CR 1200 (41◦01′27” N,
124◦05′50” W), and the other on CR 1003 (41◦01′27” N, 124◦05′03” W), (Figure 1). Unit CR 1200 was
harvested in January through April, and CR 1003 was harvested in June through August in 2017.
Before thinning, CR 1200 was 10.1 ha, including 1.2 ha within a watercourse and lake protection zone
(WLPZ) at an elevation of 126 m with a ﬂat slope (approximately 0%). Stand characteristics and species
distribution for both units are shown in Table 1. There were 2390 trees per hectare (TPH), with redwood
being the dominant species, followed by red alder (Alnus rubra Bong.), Douglas-ﬁr, and Sitka spruce
(Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.). CR 1003 was 12.1 ha in size at an elevation of 188 m, and a ground
slope ranging from 0% to 27%. This area had an average DBH of 21 cm and average tree height of
19 m, and was dominated by redwood, red alder, Sitka spruce, and Douglas-ﬁr. It is worth noting
that both CR 1200 and 1003 had some trees with bear damage (gouging of the bark) before thinning
operations began.

Commercial CTL thinning operations were performed in each unit to provide a range of soil
moisture conditions, equipment types, and operator skill. A Ponsse Bear harvester with a H8 head
was used to fell, delimb, and buck trees in CR 1200, and another harvester (Ponsse Ergo), with a H7
head, was used in CR 1003. The operator harvesting CR 1200 had more than 20 years of experience

Forests 2018, 9, 352

whereas the operator in CR 1003 had ﬁve years of experience. Forwarding operations were performed
by a Ponsse Buffalo. For each unit, the thinning objectives were similar: (1) cut the dead trees
(2) increase spacing for trees (3) reduce forest ﬁre fuel continuity. Other restrictions on cutting were
that, trees greater than 60 cm at DBH were not to be harvested, 60% canopy closure was maintained,
and the healthiest and vigorous dominant and co-dominant trees were retained to result in a basal
area (BA) of 23 m2 per hectare.
We deﬁned tree damage as the removal of the bark and cambial layer, exposing sapwood [10].
We used a systematic sampling method determining damage. This method gives similar results as total
tree sampling, and provides an equal probability of selecting a damaged tree [10]. We systematically
installed a ﬁxed circular plot (0.04 ha in size) perpendicular to the forwarder trails every 106 m.
All trees within the plot circle were measured. We had a total of 21 plots in CR 1200 and 30 plots in
CR 1003. Individual trees or clumps occurring at the circular plot were used to count tree damage.
Only scars on the tree stem (not branches) were assessed. Number of scars per tree, number of trees
damaged per hectare, height of scar from ground level, distance from the scar to the forwarding trail
centerline, and scar size (width and length) were recorded. Furthermore, we distinguished if the scar
was on individual or clumped tree. However, we did not measure trees (or scars) that had existing bear
damage to prevent confounding our data. All trees with scars within a 0.04 ha plot were measured
regardless of scar size. Trees less than 5 cm DBH were excluded from scar measurements.
The R Package (R Development Core Team 2008) was used for the data analysis. Each unit was
analyzed separately and residual stand damage was the independent variable. We tested for normality
using the Shapiro-Wilk test. The ANOVA test was performed to identify the interaction of scar width
between tree species and DBH, and units and species, respectively. The Mann–Whitney U test was
used to determine scar size differences among tree clumps and individuals.
3. Results
3.1. Stand Characteristics after Thinning
Post-thinning stand characteristics for both units are summarized in Table 2. After thinning, 67%
of trees were harvested in CR 1200, leaving 768 TPH, and a BA was reduced to 40 m2/ha. In this unit,
the average DBH signiﬁcantly increased after thinning, but height was similar. In CR 1003, 74% of trees
were thinned, and the residual stand had an average of 28 cm DBH and 19 m of height. There were no
signiﬁcant changes in tree species distribution in both units.

3.2. Description of Residual Scar Damage
In unit CR 1200, winter harvesting resulted in 16.2% of residual trees having scar damage from
the CTL equipment and operators. These trees had an average DBH of 24.8 cm with an average of
1.7 scars per tree (Table 3). Red alder trees had the greatest number of scars (approximately three
scars per tree), redwood had more than one scar regardless of growing type (clump or individual
tree), and Douglas-ﬁr and Sitka spruce had minor scarring (Table 4). On all the trees in unit CR 1200,
the average scar was 9.0 cm wider, and 27.3 cm long with scars occurring 4.8 m from the centerline of
the forwarding trails at a height of 1.3 m above ground level (Table 5). Over 60% of the scars had a

width less than 10 cm and length less than 40 cm (Figure 2). The majority of scars were located within
2 m of the forwarding trail, and less than 1 m above ground level.

In CR 1003, which was harvested during summer, 32.2% of residual trees had scar damage. Trees
with scar damage averaged 30.7 cm DBH, and had 1.7 scars (Table 3). In this unit, Sitka spruce and
Douglas-ﬁr had the greatest number of scars, with an average of more than two per tree. Redwood

Forests 2018, 9, 352

and red alder had an average of 1.6 scars per tree (Table 4). Overall, scars on residual trees in this
unit averaged 10.4 cm wide and 36.1 cm long (Table 5). In addition, scarred trees were located 4.5 m
from the centerline of forwarding trails, with scars located 1.5 m above ground level. More than
60% of the scars were wider than 10 cm and less than 40 cm long (Figure 2). The majority of scarred
trees were located within 4 m of the forwarding trail, and 34% of scars were located less than 1 m of
ground height.
To determine if clumped or individual trees had more scarring from CTL harvesting, we compared
scar size according to tree growing form. There was only a slight difference in scar width between
clump and individual trees in CR 1200 (Table 6), but they were not statistically different (p = 0.1611).
However, scar length in clumped trees in unit CR 1200 was almost twice as large as those on individual
trees (p < 0.0001). In unit CR 1003, scars were 3 cm wider and 15 cm longer in clumped trees as
compared to individual trees, and were statistically different for both width (p = 0.0054) and length
(p < 0.0001).

Our data also show that tree DBH was a signiﬁcant factor in determining the width of scarring
damage (Table 7). Although our data is limited to two units, we tested scar width using a two-way
ANOVA for species and units (Table 8). We found that scar width was signiﬁcantly greater in unit
CR 1003 as compared to unit CR 1200. We found tree species was also important factor with Sitka
spruce and red alder having greater scar widths in unit CR 1003. In unit CR 1200 there were scar width
differences among all species (Figure 3).

4. Discussion
4.1. Factors Affecting Residual Tree Scar Damages
Except for evaluating scar width between units and species, we analyzed each unit (CR 1200
and CR 1003) separately because of several reasons: (1) CR 1200 was winter harvested and CR 1003
was summer harvested; (2) each unit had unique stand structure and species composition; (3) tree
DBH differed between units; (4) different equipment and operators were used in each unit; and (5) CR
1200 was ﬂat, and CR 1003 had a slope ranging from 0–27%. All of these factors can lead to different
conclusions if the stands were combined for all analyses. For example, Limbeck-Lilienau [20] noted
that there was more severe scar damage to residual trees (20–21%) on steep slope units as compared to
only 3–6% of residual trees on ﬂat ground.
Numerous studies have pointed out that one key to increasing the number of trees harvested
during a day is the size of the tree [23–25], and this may be dependent on the type of equipment
used [26]. In addition to tree size, operator skill may be the most important factor governing the
number, size, and distribution of scars on residual trees. As noted previously, the operator for unit
CR 1200 had over 20 years of working experiences, and had been practicing for six months before
harvesting the unit. In contrast, the operator harvesting unit CR 1003 had worked for only ﬁve years,
and only had one month of training on the CTL equipment. Thus, combined with differences in
slope and harvest season, unit CR 1003 had a greater number and larger sized scars. Furthermore,
the operator working in unit CR 1003 was not familiar with cutting tree clumps, which could also lead
to the increased residual tree damage. Kelley [18] showed that different operators could result in a
difference in scarring of 16% in Vermont. In addition, on Scandinavian forest sites, Sirén [27] found
that different operators only caused a stand damage ranging from 1.4% to 6.6%.
Although equipment operators and tree size may dictate much of the residual stand damage,
harvest season is also a critical consideration [8,19,20]. Harvest operations that occur in the summer
have been shown to cause increased scarring damage because the cambium and bark are loose
and susceptible to removal when struck by equipment or another tree [28]. This is similar to work

Forests 2018, 9, 352
8 of 12
conducted by Yilmaz and Akay [29], and Bobik [30], in which the greatest number of tree scars occurred
during the summer.
Our data clearly show that tree species is an important factor in how many and the size of
scar damage on residual trees. Although the average number of scars per tree were similar for each
unit (1.7 scars/tree), redwood, Douglas-ﬁr, and red alder sustained a substantial number of scars,
while Sitka spruce had less damage. Previous studies suggest that the scarring varies in different
tree species because of differences in bark type. Aho et al. [31] suggested that the trees that are
thin-barked and non-resinous are more susceptible to damage from logging. In redwood trees,
the sapwood is not decay-resistant, as it is in other members of the Cupressaceae family, but it has
decay-resistant bark and heartwood making this tree species immune to insects and disease if the bark
is not damaged [32]. These redwood characteristics may be important for preventing deep scars and
diseases in redwoods, but there is little data on this species. Similarly, Froese and Han [22] showed
that scar size was different between Douglas-ﬁr (65 cm2) and grand-ﬁr (Abies grandis (Douglas ex D.
Don) Lindley) (425 cm2). Howard [33] reported that scars from cable yarding operations also varied
among Douglas-ﬁr, western hemlock, and western red cedar (Thuja plicata Donn ex D.Don). Western
red cedar was damaged nearly twice as much as Douglas-ﬁr, which suggests that Douglas-ﬁr has bark
thick enough to minimize scarring. In our study, however, we could not test the seasonal and operator
effects separately, since these two variables are confounded. Thus, we could not detect whether the
scar width differences in each species were from operators, harvest season, or slope.
The interval between felling and forwarding was very short in our study, therefore, we could
not detect the number, distribution, or size of scars attributed to each machine. Instead, we observed
how each machine generated scar damage during operations. When the harvester was working, scars
on residual trees were a result of grappling large-sized trees, or when felled trees got hung-up on
residual trees. Scars from the forwarding operation occurred when logs were moved from the deck
(ground) to the bunk. Han and Kellogg [34] showed that a harvester caused more damage than a
forwarder (63.8% vs. 28.6%), however, the forwarder caused larger scars on residual trees as compared
to the harvester (178.7 cm2 vs. 143.9 cm2). They suggested that damage could be reduced by retaining
optimal trail spacing for harvester, and making trails as straight as possible for the forwarder. Both
machines generated scarring low to the ground as they moved along the trees near the forwarding
trails, and this location of scarring damage may make trees more susceptible to fungal infestations [35].
4.2. Scar Damage on between Clumps and Individual Trees
We detected longer and wider scars in clumped trees as compared to individual trees in both
harvest units. When cutting a clumped tree, the harvester operator spent a long time grappling a tree
in the clump since there was limited space to handle the trees. This would often generate larger scars
on the residual trees within the clumps. Likewise, when a harvester initially grabbed a clumped tree,
the head was slightly higher up in a clump than on an individual tree because it was difﬁcult for the
harvester head to catch the lower part of the tree. This caused the harvester head to travel downward
on the tree, causing lengthwise scarring. Kelley [18] also found that trees in high-density stands were
difﬁcult to cut without scarring the neighboring trees. Additionally, there were some residual trees
that were cut by the harvester sawblade, resulting in indirect damage. These trees can be unstable and
prone to windthrow, particularly when the soil is wet, resulting in additional damage to the residual
standing trees. We did not count windfall or bear damage, but we found more scars from sawblades
in CR 1200 as compared to CR 1003. The equipment operator working in unit CR 1003 adjusted the
harvester head system so the sawblade cut only as much as the head grabbed. This likely prevented
additional scarring on adjacent trees.
4.3. Scar Distribution
Our data supports the work of others who have examined residual tree scars associated with CTL
logging operations [8,15,16,22]. We found a majority of the scars on the residual trees were located near

Forests 2018, 9, 352
9 of 12
the ground (within 1 m) in both units. Froese and Han [22] reported that over 30% of the scars were
located within 1 m of ground, suggesting that the majority of scars are associated with machine passes,
timber processing, and handling. Bettinger and Kellogg [8] also found this same result, and suggested
that trees with scars this low to the ground may be more vulnerable to wood-decaying fungi than
those with scars higher on the stem [35]. Nevill [36] reported that roots and stems scarred near the
ground were always infected with the decay fungi, Heterobasidion annosum. This fungus spreads by
basidiospores or conidia in fresh wounds created by thinning operations [37]. In CR 1200, the trees
growing in clumps were frequently cut lower on the bole to increase the volume harvested. However,
trees in CR 1003 were cut higher on the stem to have enough space for operators to cut one tree from
the clump.
The majority of the scars were mainly located on residual trees within 4 m of the centerline of
the forwarding trails in both units. Only a small proportion of scars were found on trees located
over 4 m from the trails, but a greater number of trees over 4 m from the centerline in CR 1003 had
scars. This is similar to the pattern of scarring noted by Bettinger and Kellogg [8], and Han and
Kellogg [15], in which 64–72.2% of scars occurred within 4.5 m of trail centerline when using a CTL
system. Athanassiadis [38] suggested that as the distance between the operator and the tree increases,
it is harder to control both the machine and logs, therefore, most operators will do a majority of work
near the forwarding trail.
Scar size is an important factor associated with future activity of wood decay fungi [39,40].
Speciﬁcally, scar width has been shown to be more important than length when determining fungal
decay incidence [41]. This can be important for determining the value of wood that may be produced
in the future, or for estimating the number of trees that may die due to fungal infections. However,
scar size is critical for determining how many residual trees could be counted as damaged after CTL
harvest operations. This information is important for land managers to understand when determining
the acceptable level of residual stand damage. For example, we show that if scars wider than 5 cm were
counted, 13.9% of the residual trees in CR 1200 and 31.5% of the trees with scars be considered damage
(Table 9). Similarly, if only scars greater than 20 cm are counted, then 1.7% in CR 1200 and 3.9% in
CR 1003 would be considered damaged. Green Diamond Resources Company provided us with their
deﬁnition of what they consider stand damage for both redwood and Douglas-ﬁr. Their standards for
when scars should be counted as damage are redwood scars wider than 30% of the circumference of
tree at DBH, and Douglas-ﬁr scars wider than 20% of the circumference of the tree at DBH. To illustrate
this, we calculated the percent of damaged trees using these deﬁnitions, (Table 10). This change in
the deﬁnition for determining when trees are considered damaged results in an approximately 5%
decrease in damaged trees in CR 1200, and 9% decrease in damaged trees in CR 1003. Based on the
percent of trees with different scar widths (Table 9) and using the company’s standards, we suggest
that scar widths between 5 and 10 cm would be an acceptable level of stand damage for these coastal
redwood sites.

4.4. Best Management Practices (BMPs) for Reducing CTL Scarring
Previous studies have suggested BMPs that would reduce the amount of scar damage associated
with CTL logging operations [15,18,31,36], but they are not speciﬁc to coastal redwood stands. Both
public land management agencies and private timber companies understand that good planning and
logging practices can reduce residual stand damage, particularly tree scarring, and decrease operating
time and labor [16]. In coastal redwood stands, we recommend the following BMPs:
•
Cut trees to leave stumps lower to the ground surface within the forwarding trail, so that
harvesting equipment does not have to move to the side of the trails.
•
In areas of clumped trees, leaving a higher stump provides space for the harvester head to move
without damaging trees. Higher stumps may also help prevent damage from windthrow.
•
Use experienced operators when cutting redwood clumps and on steep slopes, since these
situations require specialized skills.
•
Select units so that operations are conducted in the winter, and avoid spring and summer
harvesting in coastal redwood stands.
Using these BMPs will help ensure that these highly productive stands continue to produce
high-quality timber products, and that the damage assessed is meaningful to land managers.
Understanding where stand damage occurs on trees close to forwarding trails, the species mix, slope,
operator, and equipment will limit the amount of residual tree damage from CTL harvest operations.
5. Conclusions
There are many concerns about CTL logging damage to residual redwood trees. In the two units
we assessed, we found a total of 16.2% of trees were damaged in CR 1200, and 32.2% in CR 1003,
and the scar-damaged trees were concentrated near the forwarding trails (less than 4 m) with scars at
or near the ground (less than 1 m). Scar width and length were greater on trees growing in clumps
than on individual trees, which highlights the need for skilled operators, given the limited space
within a clump. We encourage additional studies of CTL harvesting in coastal redwood stands to
determine if residual stand damage results in increased fungal infection and tree damage associated
with decay fungi.
