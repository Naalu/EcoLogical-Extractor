Abstract. Forest managers of the western United States are increasingly interested in utilising naturally ignited wildfires 
to achieve management objectives. Wildfires can accomplish a range of objectives, from maintenance of intact ecological 
conditions, to ecosystem restoration, to playing vital natural disturbance roles; however, few studies have carefully 
evaluated long-term effectiveness and outcomes of wildfire applications across multiple forest types. We remeasured 
monitoring plots more than 10 years after ‘resource objective’ (RO) fires were allowed to burn in three main south-western 
forest types. Results showed minimal effects and effective maintenance of open conditions in an intact pine-oak site. 
Higher-severity fire and delayed mortality of larger and older trees contributed to reductions in basal area and canopy 
cover at the mixed-conifer and spruce-fir sites. Species dominance shifted towards ponderosa pine in both the mixed-
conifer and spruce-fir sites. Although fires resulted in 46–68% mortality of smaller trees initially, substantial ingrowth 
brought tree density to near pre-fire levels in all forest types after 12 years. Overall, the 2003 RO fires were broadly 
successful at maintaining or creating open and heterogeneous conditions and resulted in fire- and drought-tolerant species 
composition. These conditions are likely to be resilient to changing climate, at least in the short term. Substantial mortality 
of large trees and continuing loss of basal area, however, are a concern, given further climate warming.

Introduction
Managers of public lands in the western USA are under
increasing pressure to promote and maintain ecological resilience
across large landscapes while resource budgets to support this
monumental task continuetobereduced (Timberlakeand Schultz
2017; Halofsky et al. 2018). It is widely understood that eco-
system management of western forests requires allowing natural
disturbance processes such as fire to influence and regulate
ecological trajectories of intact ecosystems (Fule´ and Covington
1999; Swetnam et al. 2001; Stephens and Gill 2005). In addition,
active restoration is required on landscapes that have become
degraded and shifted in structure and function through decades of
anthropogenic fire exclusion (Covington 2000; Allen et al. 2002).
Mechanical approaches to restoration that include tree thinning
and prescribed burning are highly effective at meeting objectives
and goals (Fule´ et al. 2012; Kalies and Yocom-Kent 2016), but
these tools can be economically unfeasible to implement across
large, remote landscapes where access is limited. Currently there
is strong interest in managing naturally ignited wildfires as a
means of meeting ecosystem management goals and encouraging
landscape-scale resistance to future stressors (Stephens et al.
2013; North et al. 2015; Huffman et al. 2017).
Wildfires managed under moderate weather conditions may
be effective at reducing fuels and restoring desirable conditions
across landscapes (Agee and Skinner 2005; Martinson and Omi
2013; Huffman et al. 2017), but the long-term outcomes of these
‘resource objective’ (RO) wildfires are not well understood and
more work is needed to evaluate RO wildfires in terms of
conservation and ecological restoration goals. Objective evalu-
ation of RO fires can be challenging because many fires are
implemented for various and broadly defined goals and careful
monitoring is often lacking (Aplet and Wilmer 2010). In addi-
tion, prolonged departures from historical fire regimes can
increase the initial severity and risk for fire managers (Fule´
et al. 2007; Flatley and Fule´ 2016). Often, short-term effects are
emphasised while effects on long-term resiliency are not moni-
tored (Meyer 2015; Stephens et al. 2016).
Grand Canyon National Park (GCNP) is a UNESCO World
Heritage Site where fire has been managed in never-harvested
forests for ROs for several decades (Fule´ et al. 2003a, 2003b),
providing a valuable site for study of fire regime restoration.
Fule´ and Laughlin (2007) assessed first-order fire effects across
an elevation gradient in the first 2 years following several RO
wildfires that occurred in 2003 on the North Rim of the GCNP.
The RO wildfires tended to mimic historical fire regimes that
prevailed before fire exclusion ,1880, with primarily surface
fires at lower elevations and mixed-severity (both surface and
crown fires) fires at higher elevations. The thinning effect of the

fires was concentrated on smaller fire-susceptible trees and
mature shade-tolerant conifers (e.g. Abies concolor) (Fule´ and
Laughlin 2007). Although the initial results of the RO wildfires
were seen as consistent with ecological restoration in terms of
effects on tree density and composition, fire disturbance often
has delayed effects on tree mortality and tree regeneration that
can shift perception of the efficacy of fire treatments (Stevens-
Rumann et al. 2018; Stoddard et al. 2018).
In the present study, we remeasured permanent plots on three
of the RO wildfires a decade after the first-order fire effects study.
The data provide quantitative information about the multi-year
effects of RO wildfires across an elevation gradient representing
the main forest types of south-western North America. Given that
delayed mortality and regeneration failure from RO wildfires
could havea substantial effect on the forest in the decade since the
previous measurement, our objectives were to assess the pro-
longed effects of wildfire on forest characteristics in three forest
types. This gave us the opportunity to ask the following research
questions: (1) do forests show characteristics of structure and
composition comparable with historical ranges of variation more
than a decade following RO fires?; (2) did mixed-severity fires
lead to fine-scale variability in forest structure because of higher
treemortality?;and (3)did post-firetreeregeneration ofsprouting
and shade-tolerant species increase?
Methods
Study area
The study sites are located on the North Rim of the GCNP, in
northern Arizona, spanning an elevation gradient from 2200 to
2700 m. Average annual climate (1925–2015) at the Bright
Angel Weather Station (https://wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.
pl?az1001, accessed February 2016) on the North Rim was:
precipitation 51.8 cm; July maximum temperature 25.38C. In the
period covered by the latest post-fire remeasurement, 2006–15,
annual precipitation averaged 54.1 cm, 105% of the long-term
average and July maximum temperature averaged 25.58C. The
North Rim of the GCNP contains a complex mixture of forest
types in close proximity that burned historically with a mix of
frequencies and severities (Fule´ et al. 2002). Recognising these
distinct forest types, the GCNP management team outlined
desired management objectives based on historical ranges of
variability specific to each forest type and has used an active fire
management program for decades to restore forest integrity
while maintaining resilient landscapes (USDOI NPS 2012). The
pine-oak site is located at lower elevations on Powell Plateau
and includes ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum
P. & C. Lawson), Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt) and New
Mexico locust (Robinia neomexicana Gray). This site is a rare
example of an unharvested forest with a relatively undisrupted
surface fire regime (Fule´ et al. 2002, 2003b). Site-specific
reconstructions of historical forest structure and fire regime
before fire exclusion starting ,1880 indicate these forests were
dominated by ponderosa pine with an average basal area (BA)
and tree density of 18 m2 ha1 and 157 trees ha1 respectively
(Fule´ et al. 2002, 2003b). The site had a low-severity, frequent-
fire regime with fire return intervals between 6 and 9 years (Fule´
et al. 2002, 2003b). The warm/dry mixed-conifer sites are
located at the mid-elevations and comprise ponderosa pine,
white fir (A.
concolor [Gordon & Glendinning] Hoopes),
Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca [Mirb]. Franco)
and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx). Site-specific
reconstructions indicate these forests were ponderosa pine-
dominated with an average BA of 29 m2 ha1 and average
density of 246 trees ha1 and experienced a low- to moderate-
severity fire regime with fire return intervals between 4 and 30
years (Fule´ et al. 2002, 2003b). The spruce-fir site is located at
the highest elevation and is dominated by Englemann spruce
(Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm.) (combined with P. pun-
gens Engelm for analysis), subalpine fir (A. lasicocarpa [Hook.]
Nutt.), white fir and quaking aspen. Site-specific reconstructions
indicate the forest was spruce-dominated with an average BA
and tree density of 10 m2 ha1 and 150 trees ha1 respectively
(Fule´ et al. 2003a). These forests historically experienced a
mixed-severity fire regime, which consisted of low-severity
surface fires, especially on the drier south- and west-facing
slopes, and infrequent, patchy, stand-replacing fires on more
mesic sites with fire return intervals between 9 and 99 years
(Fule´ et al. 2003a; Yocom-Kent et al. 2015).
In 2003, several RO fires were managed to burn on the North
Rim of the GCNP (Fule´ and Laughlin 2007). These fires burned
across a series of permanent ecological monitoring plots previ-
ously installed between 1997 and 2001 that were used to
quantify historical and contemporary forest structure and fire
regimes across different forest types (see Fule´ et al. 2002,
2003a, 2003b). Our sampling plots were located across three
wildfires (Powell Fire, Rose Fire and Poplar Fire) (Fig. 1). The
Powell Fire was ignited by lighting on 15 June 2003 and burned
1460 ha on Powell Plateau. The fire burned primarily as a
surface fire (.85% unburned and low severity) through a
ponderosa pine–Gambel oak forest until 20 August 2003
(Fig. 1). This area of the park has burned at least three times
since 1879. The Rose Fire was started by lighting on 7 October
2003 and burned 1293 ha on Swamp Ridge. The fire burned
primarily as a low-severity fire (60%) through mixed-conifer
forest (Fig. 1). The Poplar Fire ignited by lighting on 4 Septem-
ber 2003 and burned 4813 ha, of which 2763 ha were in higher
elevations that included a mixture of cool and wet mixed-conifer
forest. Our plots were limited to the northern part of the Poplar
Fire area, which was primarily in the spruce-fir vegetation type.
The fire burned with a mix of surface (42% low severity) and
crown fire (31% moderate severity and 25% high severity) until
1 November 2003 (Fig. 1). Both the Rose and Poplar Fires
burned in an area of the park that had not burned since 1879.
Burn severities for the three fires were compiled in the Moni-
toring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) database (www.mtbs.
gov, accessed May 2016). MTBS is an interagency project in the
USA developed to provide a national analysis of trends in burn
severity for large wildland fires (see Eidenshink et al. 2007 for
details).
Data collection
In 1998 or 2001, depending on the specific location, permanent
plots (0.1 ha; 20  50 m) were established to examine forest
structure and composition over an elevation gradient (Fule´ et al.
2002). Sampling plots were spaced on a systematic grid
300  300 m at elevations below 2600 m and 600  1200 m at
higher elevations. All trees were tagged and tree measurements

included species, tree condition class, diameter at breast height
(DBH), total height and crown base height. Trees .15 cm
DBH were measured within the entire plot; trees between 2.5
and 15 cm DBH were measured on a 0.025-ha subplot.
Trees ,2.5 cm DBH were considered regeneration and were
tallied by species on a 50-m2 subplot. We recorded presence or
absence of tree canopy cover (vertical projection of canopy
taller than 1.37 m) every 3 m along a 50-m line transect oriented
with the slope through each plot centre. Increment cores were
collected for all trees likely to pre-date fire exclusion (1879)
and for 10% of trees that had established after this period.
Initial post-fire measurements were completed in 2004–05 and
described in Fule´ et al. (2007). In 2015, we remeasured 17 of 36
plots in the Powell Fire, 15 of 20 plots in the Rose Fire and 11 of
18 plots in the Poplar Fire. Plots were randomly selected.
Data analysis
We used the plots remeasured in 2015 to test for differences in
forest structural (BA, tree density and canopy cover) changes
between forest types. BA and tree density were calculated using
all trees $2.5 cm. We analysed the percent change of the two
post-fire observations compared with pre-fire observations with
an analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated-measures. If
significant forest  time interactions occurred, we used a one-
way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Fisher’s least signifi-
cant difference post-hoc test to compare differences by forest
type within year. Changes in forest structure and regeneration
over time from pre- to post-fire measurements within each forest
type were tested with non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-ranked
tests. Changes in overstorey composition between pre- and post-
fire (2015) were analysed using permutational multivariate
analysis (PERMANOVA) with a Bray–Curtis dissimilarity
distance measure (Faith et al. 1987; Anderson 2001). Overstorey
compositional changes and transitions in species dominance
within each plot were assessed using importance values calcu-
lated by summing relative tree density and relative BA for each
tree species. This index provides a measure of the relative
dominance of a given species in a community (Strahan et al.
2016). All tests were conducted at a ¼ 0.05.
Results
Overall changes in live BA differed significantly by forest type,
time and forest  time interactions following RO fires (Fig. 2).
Declines in BA at 2 years following the RO fires were signifi-
cantly greater in the spruce-fir forest compared with the pine-oak
and mixed-conifer forests. By 2015, reductions in BA following
RO fires were more pronounced in the spruce-fir forest, followed
by the mixed-conifer forest and then the pine-oak forest. Shifts in
tree density and canopy cover did not differ significantly among
forest types following RO fires; however, changes in density
varied significantly over time (Fig. 2).

and canopy cover were not significantly different (P ¼ 0.17,
0.63 and 0.17 respectively) compared with pre-fire observations
(Fig. 3). Average BA declined by 11%, from 23.3 to
20.7 m2 ha1 with the maximum mortality on any plot reaching
13.7 m2 ha1. BA loss .10 m2 ha1 occurred only on one plot.
Initially, the fire reduced average density by 46% from 639.7 to
347.8 tree ha1 by 2005, with the maximum mortality on any
plot reaching 85% (1363 trees ha1 killed). Tree mortality
occurred primarily in the smaller DBH classes of Gambel oak
(Fig. 4). Ponderosa pine density was reduced by 25%, of which
79% consisted of pines ,10 cm DBH. Large-tree (conifers with
DBH $37.5 cm; aspen and oak with DBH $20 cm) mortality
was minimal, declining by 5% or 4 trees ha1 (Fig. 5).
Ponderosa pines predating 1880 had 13% mortality (Fig. 6).
Canopy cover was reduced by 16%, from 50.0% to 42.1%. Total
regeneration increased significantly (P ¼ 0.02) at 2 years
following the Powell Fire, largely from increases, 200%, in
New Mexico locust (P ¼ 0.005) (Table 1).
Between 2005 and 2015, average BA increased 8% to
22.4 m2 ha1 and tree density increased 18% to 409.7 trees ha1
primarily because of ingrowth of sprouting species (e.g. Gambel
oak and New Mexico locust) into the smaller diameter classes
(Fig. 4). Average density of large ponderosa pines increased
from 64.4 to 69.2 trees ha1 (Fig. 5). No delayed mortality
(mortality from 2005 to 2015) was observed for large trees
($37.5 cm DBH), but mortality of ponderosa pines (,37.5
DBH) was 7%. From 2005 to 2015, regeneration decreased
significantly (P ¼ 0.03) by an average of 31% or 3520.4 stems
ha1 (only sprouting species were observed in 2005 and 2015;
Table 1).
In 2015, 12 years following the Powell Fire, total BA, tree
density and canopy cover remained similar to pre-fire values
(P ¼ 0.77, P ¼ 0.12 and P ¼ 0.26 respectively) (Fig. 2). Forest
variability as described by the coefficient of variation (CV) did
not change for BA, remaining at 38%; the CV for tree density

by pine in 2015; the same pattern was observed for Gambel oak-
dominated plots (Fig. 7). Density of large ponderosa pine trees
(DBH $ 37.5 cm) had a net increase of 2.6%, or 2 trees ha1,
between 2005 and 2015 (Fig. 5). Mortality of old (pre-1880)
ponderosa pines over the study period was 19% (Fig. 6). Total
regeneration increased by 8.5% to 7759 stems ha1.
Mixed-conifer site in the Rose Fire
The Rose Fire burned with intermediate severity (Fig. 1) and had
variable effects compared with the lower- and higher-elevation
fires. At 2 years following the Rose Fire, mean BA and tree
density were significantly reduced (P ¼ 0.05, P ¼ 0.002
respectively) from pre-fire values (Fig. 3). Canopy cover
decreased 9% (not significant, P ¼ 0.82) from 64% to 59%
(Fig. 3). Average BA declined by 20%, from 45.0 to 36.0 m2
ha1 with the maximum mortality on any plot reaching
23.4 m2 ha1. BA loss .10 m2 ha1 occurred on six of 15 plots.
Average density declined by 56% from 1013 to 443 trees ha1,
with the maximum mortality on any plot reaching 83% (1811
trees ha1 killed). Tree mortality occurred primarily in the
smaller DBH classes (,20 cm) of shade-tolerant and fire-
intolerant species such as white fir and aspen (Fig. 4). White
fir was reduced across all DBH classes and comprised 60% of
the total mortality. Large-tree mortality (conifers with DBH
$37.5 cm; aspen and oak with DBH $20 cm) averaged 8%, or
11 trees ha1 (Fig. 5). Old-tree (pre-1880) mortality was 12%,
although highly variable by species (Fig. 6).
Between 2005 and 2015, the average BA decreased 22% to
28.0m2 ha1 while treedensity increased 59% to 703.6 trees ha1
through ingrowth of sprouting aspen (Fig. 3). Tree mortality
continued across all DBH classes except the smallest (Fig. 4).
Average density of large trees decreased from 124.1 to 81.8 trees
ha1, largely because of decreases in aspen and white fir (Fig. 4).
Regeneration decreased 5.8%, or 617.6 stems ha1, largely
caused by reductions in white fir (63%), albeit not statistically
significant (P ¼ 0.08) (Table 1). Both aspen and ponderosa pine,
however, increased significantly (P , 0. 001 and P ¼ 0.004
respectively) from 2005 to 2015.
In 2015, the BA and canopy cover were significantly lower
(P , 0.001 for both) than in the pre-fire observations; tree density
remained lower, although not significantly (P ¼ 0.14), than pre-
fire density (Fig. 2). The CV for BA more than doubled from 18%
to 43%; CV for tree density and canopy cover increased from
60% to 78% and 17% to 29% respectively. By 2015, density in
the 2.5–20-cm DBH class had a net decrease of 26%, averaging
555 trees ha1. In the 2.5–20-cm DBH class, white fir density was
reduced the most (55%), while aspen density increased by 83%
(Fig. 4). Overstorey species composition in 2015 was similar
(PERMANOVA P ¼ 0.08) to pre-fire comparisons.
The key outcome in the mixed-conifer forest was that species
dominance shifted away from white fir towards ponderosa pine
by 2015 (Fig. 7). Prior to the 2003 fire, white fir was the dominant
species across 80% of the plots, ponderosa pine was dominant on
13% and aspen was dominant on 7%. White fir dominance was
reduced to 33%, ponderosa pine increased to 47% and aspen was
the dominant species on 20% of the plots 12 years following the
Rose Fire. Over the study duration, large-tree mortality averaged
40%, or 54 trees ha1 (Fig. 5). Large-tree mortality varied by
species, with disproportionately high mortality of aspen (88%)
followed by white fir (42%). Old-tree (pre-1880) mortality was
32% with disproportionately high aspen mortality (100%), fol-
lowed by both Douglas-fir (50%) and white fir (55%) (Fig. 6).
Total regeneration increased by 15% to 4581 stems ha1
(Table 1). In 2015, regeneration mainly comprised sprouting
aspen (41%) followed by white fir (35%) and ponderosa pine
(15%). By 2015, ponderosa pine seedlings had increased signifi-
cantly (P ¼ 0.005) when compared with pre-fire values (Table 1).
Spruce-fir site in the Poplar Fire
The spruce-fir site had the highest burn severity (Fig. 1) and
delayed tree mortality. At 2 years following the Poplar Fire, BA
and tree density were significantly reduced (P , 0.001 for both)
compared with pre-fire values (Fig. 3). Canopy cover decreased

21%, from 49.7% to 34.7%, albeit not significantly (P ¼ 0.07),
when compared with pre-fire observations (Fig. 3). Average BA
declined by 50%, from 36.0 to 18.0 m2 ha1, with the maximum
mortality on any plot reaching 53.4 m2 ha1 between 2001 and
2005. BA loss .10 m2 ha1 occurred on eight of 11 plots and two
plots had .90% BA loss. Average density declined by 68%, from
1076.6 to 348.0 trees ha1, with the maximum mortality on any
plot reaching 100% (1351 trees ha1 killed). Tree mortality
occurred primarily in the smaller DBH classes of fire-intolerant
and shade-tolerant species such as subalpine fir, Engelmann
spruce, white fir and aspen (Fig. 4). Large-tree mortality between
2001 and 2005 was 26%, or 37.2 trees ha1(Fig. 5). Initial mor-
tality of pre-1880 trees was 29% (Fig. 6). Regeneration decreased
(P ¼ 0.005) by 80%, or 4711 stems ha1 (Table 1).
Between 2005 and 2015, BA decreased to 12.8 m2 ha1, but
tree density increased to 1387 trees ha1. The increase in density
was significant (P ¼ 0.02) when compared with 2005 post-fire
density. Increases in density were largely because of a nearly
6-fold increase in aspen saplings with DBH , 10 cm. Average
density of large trees decreased from 107.0 to 45.0 trees ha1,
mainly among shade-tolerant and fire-intolerant species. Pre-
1880 trees decreased by 25%. Although regeneration increased
by 94%, or 4947.4 stems ha1 between 2005 and 2015, the
changes were statistically insignificant (P ¼ 0.08) (Table 1).
In 2015, 12 years following the Poplar Fire, total BA and
canopy cover were significantly lower (P , 0.001, P ¼ 0.02
respectively) than the pre-fire values; tree density was not
significantly (P ¼ 0.97) different but exceeded pre-fire density
(Fig. 3). The CV for BA, tree density and canopy cover more
than doubled, increasing from 25% to 60%, 44% to 97% and
19% to 49% respectively. Overstorey species composition in
2015 was similar (PERMANOVA P ¼ 0.15) to the pre-fire
composition. Species dominance shifted following the Poplar
Fire, however, exhibiting a post-fire dominance by aspen
(dominant on 45% of plots) followed by white fir (27%),
ponderosa pine (18%) and New Mexico locust (9%) (Fig. 7).
Prior to the fire, white fir was dominant on 36% of the plots,
followed by subalpine fir (18%), Engelmann spruce (18%),
aspen (18%) and ponderosa pine (9%). Tree density in the
2.5–20-cm DBH class increased 66%, averaging 1313 trees
ha1; aspen accounted for 73% (Fig. 4). Large-tree mortality
averaged 69% (99.3 trees ha1) throughout the post-fire dura-
tion of the study (Fig. 5). Mortality was dominated by large
aspen (54.7 trees ha1) followed by white fir (23.2 trees ha1).
Large Engelmann spruce averaging 15.8 trees ha1 and subal-
pine fir averaging 2.8 trees ha1 before the fire all died by 2015.
Mortality of pre-1880 trees was 47% overall, but 100% of old
spruce, subalpine fir and Douglas-fir had died by 2015 (Fig. 6).
Total regeneration increased by 3.8% to 10189.3 stems ha1
(Table 1), composed primarily of sprouting species such as
aspen (78%) and New Mexico locust (12%).
Discussion
Post-fire forest structure and composition compared with
historical range of variability
The 2003 RO fires in the GCNP were effective in the short term
in thinning smaller diameter trees across all three forest types
(Fule´ and Laughlin 2007). By 2015, 12 years following the RO

fires, substantial tree ingrowth caused total tree density to return
to near pre-fire levels at both the pine-oak and mixed-conifer
sites and exceeded pre-fire density at the spruce-fir site. Tree
ingrowth, however, was small and made minor contributions to
overall BA. Persistent fire effects were evident in both the
mixed-conifer and spruce-fir sites as BA and canopy cover
continued to decline 12 years following the fires. Although we
did not find significant changes in forest composition from pre-
to post-fire, there were fine-scale shifts in species dominance
likely caused by colonisation and persistence of fire-adapted
species. For example, plots dominated by mesic, fire-intolerant
fir and spruce before the RO fires tended to shift towards
more xeric (pine, oak, Douglas-fir) composition, whereas plots
dominated by fire-resistant ponderosa pine and fire-resilient
aspen persisted following fire. Forest composition in 2015 at the
pine-oak and mixed-conifer sites tended to resemble historical
composition (i.e. pre-fire-exclusion), with ponderosa pine
dominant at both sites.
Forest conditions remained broadly consistent with restora-
tion of historical patterns 12 years post-fire. In the pine-oak and
mixed-conifer sites, RO fires maintained or moved BA within
ranges considered to support resilience to natural disturbance
and environmental stressors (Agee and Skinner 2005; Waltz
et al. 2014; Stephens et al. 2016). In the spruce-fir site, BA was
reduced by 64% and quadratic mean diameter averaged 10.9 cm
in 2015. These conditions are indicative of an early successional
forest typical of higher-elevation ecosystems with natural
mixed-severity fire regimes. Overall, through the first 12 years
following fire, the 2003 RO fires were broadly effective at
maintaining or restoring historical patterns in forest types across
the elevation gradient.
Fine-scale variability in forest structure following RO fires
Variability in fine-scale forest structure increased following RO
fires in the mixed-conifer and spruce-fir forests but not at the
pine-oak site. At 12 years following the RO fires, the CV for BA,
tree density and canopy cover increased by more than 30%
compared with pre-fire values at both the mixed-conifer and
spruce-fir sites. In contrast, at the pine-oak site the CV increased
slightly (3%) for canopy cover only. The spruce-fir site had the
greatest changes in forest structure and had the greatest area
burned with moderate or high severity (56%). The pine-oak site
experienced the least amount of forest change and also had the
least moderate- and high-severity fire (13%). The mixed-conifer
site was intermediate, with 25% moderate or high severity fire.
These results are likely consistent with ecosystem management
goals of maintenance v. restoration v. allowing natural high-
severity fires to burn. Initial forest conditions are likely to
influence ecosystem management goals of RO fires. For
example, Huffman et al. (2017) found moderate-severity fire
was required to meet a broad array of restorative objectives in
degraded or ponderosa pine forest in a fire-excluded state,
whereas at our site, low-severity fire were adequate in main-
taining historical range of variation conditions. A variety of
stand ages resulting from higher-severity fires is often a desir-
able management objective and associated with natural patterns
in spruce-fir landscapes (USDOI NPS 2012; O’Connor et al.
2014). Historical evidence suggests that our spruce-fir site was
quite young and approximately one-third of the area was in an
early succession stage because of the stand-replacing burns
before 1880 (Lang and Stewart 1910; Fule´ et al. 2003a; Yocom-
Kent et al. 2015). The differences in forest responses following
the three RO fires are logical, given the differences in forest
structure, life-history strategies of tree species and associated
historical fire regime characteristics (Turner 1989; Fule´ et al.
2003a, 2003b). Heterogeneous forest structure can also reduce
crown fire size by breaking up contiguous canopy fuels,
reducing fuel ladders of small trees that carry fire into the can-
opy and breaking up large patches dominated by conifers (Agee
and Skinner 2005; Fule´ et al. 2012; Yocom-Kent et al. 2015). In

turn, these conditions may make it easier for managers to
implement future RO fires. These implications highlight the
importance of incorporating variability in evaluations of eco-
system management success.
Delayed mortality of larger and older, fire-intolerant and
shade-tolerant species contributed to the changes in BA and
canopy cover. Large, old trees are often a priority for conserva-
tion because they may represent rare structural legacies, provide
numerous ecological services and enhance ecosystem resilience
(Franklin et al. 2000). In some ecosystems, old-tree abundance
is declining (Hejl 1992; Arno et al. 1995; Youngblood 2001) as a
result of fire, harvesting and climate change (Kolb et al. 2007;
van Mantgem et al. 2009). Delayed mortality of large and old
trees has been observed in other studies of thinning and burning
treatments in forests experiencing decades of fire exclusion and
structural changes (Fule´ et al. 2007; Youngblood et al. 2009;
Roccaforte et al. 2015). At the GCNP, we found low mortality of
large (6%) and old trees (13%) following the low-elevation
Powell Fire. Delayed mortality observed from 2005 to 2015 at
this site also remained low (3% large trees; 7% old trees). The
mixed-conifer and spruce-fir sites had higher mortality of large
and old trees, with declines of 40% and 69% respectively, over
the study period (1998–2015). Loss of old trees at the mixed-
conifer site raises concerns for use of wildfire for restoration of
these ecosystems and calls for further research.
Post-fire tree regeneration
Sprouting species dominated tree regeneration 12 years after the
2003 RO fires in all three forest types. At the pine-oak site,
resprouting Gambel oak and New Mexico locust comprised
100% of the total regeneration density in 2015 and Gambel oak
was 6% higher than the pre-fire density. Sprouting species were
primarily restricted to areas where they previously occurred,
suggesting limited new recruitment. Fire severity is often pre-
dictive of the sprouting intensity (Shive et al. 2013); fire severity
was generally low according to the MTBS outputs at the pine-
oak site (Fig. 1), perhaps explaining the marginal increases in
oak sprouts. Prolific aspen response after fire has been well
documented (Bailey and Whitman 2002; Yocom-Kent et al.
2015), although persistence to reach tree stature in south-
western
forests
can
be
infrequent
given
environmental
stressors such as intensive herbivory, pathogens and changing
climatic conditions (Zegler et al. 2012). By 2015, aspen
regeneration had increased 66% at the mixed-conifer site and
65% at the spruce-fir site relative to pre-fire densities, sug-
gesting a persistent aspen community in these forest types. We
expected regeneration of shade-tolerant species to increase
following RO fires and although white fir was the most abundant
conifer regeneration species, densities declined when compared
with both pre-fire and initial post-fire densities at both the
mixed-conifer and spruce-fir sites. Trees in the genus Abies
spp. are prolific seeders (Zald et al. 2008), but competition with
prolific sprouting aspen may be limiting Abies establishment at
our sites. Spruce seedlings were only observed on two of the 11
sample plots 12 years after the RO fires, perhaps because of the
reduction in seed-bearing trees. Over the study period (1998–
2015), spruce trees declined from an average of 180 trees ha1
to 17 trees ha1 and all spruce trees .37.5 cm DBH were
killed. Finally, although pine regeneration was absent from the
pine-oak site, it increased 3622% (3582 stems ha1) at the mixed-
conifer site from 1998 to 2015. Douglas-fir also increased sub-
stantially (400%) over the same time period at that site.
Stevens-Rumann et al. (2018) found that .50% of conifer
seedlings established within the first 10 years post-fire in a
multi-regional study of western forests. In addition, they indi-
cated seedling establishment in the first 3 years is likely to be
highly predictive of subsequent tree density. Slow conifer
regeneration responses following fires in the early 21st century
have been reported in several studies and are likely related to
high moisture deficits during the period 1996–2015 (Owen et al.
2017; Stevens-Rumann et al. 2018; Stoddard et al. 2018).
Although more monitoring is needed to determine successional
trajectories, our regeneration data indicate that the 2003 RO
fires stimulated regeneration, although we found high variation
across the different forest types.
Challenges and management implications
Promoting forests that are more resilient into the future often
requires bold management to overcome the constraints of over a
century of fire exclusion, but also involves a sophisticated and
tactful approach in sustaining ecosystem integrity. Post-fire
monitoring by Fule´ and Laughlin (2007) and the present study
indicates that the 2003 RO fires likely mimicked historical fire
processes characteristic of both the pine-oak and spruce-fir sites
and had a restorative effect at the mixed-conifer site. These
processes improved ecological conditions by maintaining intact
conditions in the pine-oak site, restoring forest structure in
the mixed-conifer site and shifting the spruce-fir site to more
open and heterogeneous forest structure conditions, all of which
likely promoted a more fire- and climate-resilient species
composition.
However, at least two important challenges face ongoing fire
management. Warming climate is already affecting regional fire
severity (Robinne et al. 2018; Singleton et al. 2019). Future
projections suggest that GCNP forests are likely to undergo
environmental shifts equivalent to one or two life zones (e.g.
forests currently in the ponderosa pine zone would expand and
find suitable habitat in the spruce-fir zone) by 2100, even under
relatively conservative emissions scenarios (e.g. representative
concentration pathway 4.5) (Flatley and Fule´ 2016; O’Donnell
et al. 2018). By favouring drought- and fire-adapted species and
thinning dense stands, RO wildfires at GCNP have been consis-
tent with ecosystem management goals of facilitating ecological
resilience to a warming climate (Fule´ 2008). Nonetheless, as
climate models predict a warmer and drier climate, habitat shifts
and reductions in the distribution of dominant tree species
should be expected.
A second key challenge is delayed post-fire tree mortality,
which was substantial, especially for large and old mesic
species. Large, old trees represent structural legacies often
identified with ecological integrity across US national parks
and wilderness areas. Under a warming climate, mesic species
such as Abies and Picea are likely to decline. The rarity of
this forest type in the dry south-west might lead managers to
seek treatments that lend additional protection to spruce trees.
Long-term monitoring is essential to help managers maintain
ecological integrity, conserve resource values and make
informed decisions regarding ecosystem management options.
