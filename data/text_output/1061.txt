Abstract
Background: This paper describes Fires of Change, a collaborative art exhibit designed to communicate about the
shifting fire regimes of the United States Southwest through the lens of multimedia art. The Southwest Fire Science
Consortium and Landscape Conservation Initiative, both of which are boundary organizations that facilitate
collaboration among managers and scientists to develop and apply actionable science, organized Fires of Change
by convening scientists, managers, and artists in the co-production of science-based artwork. Surveys were
conducted with Fires of Change exhibit visitors to assess the impacts of viewing the exhibit, as well as with exhibit
creators to assess the effects of participating in the project.
Results: The visitor survey results demonstrate that Fires of Change exhibits increased visitors’ understanding of the
effect of climate change on fire regimes and increased visitors’ support for management actions to address the
effects of climate change on fire behavior. The exhibit creator survey results demonstrate that the development of
Fires of Change created new relationships and networks among the participants and increased appreciation for
collaborations among scientists, managers, and artists. Specifically, science-management relationships, networks, and
boundary organizations may have facilitated the project.
Conclusions: Fires of Change demonstrates that art can be an effective mechanism for communicating about
complex ecological issues and that, by collaborating in the development of artwork, scientists and managers can
create new partnerships.

Resumen
Antecedentes: Este trabajo describe Fuegos de Cambio, una exhibición de arte colaborativo diseñado para
comunicar sobre los cambios en el régimen de fuegos en el Sudoeste de los EEUU a través de la visión del arte
multimedia. El Consorcio de la Ciencia del Fuego del Sudoeste y la Iniciativa de Conservación del Paisaje, ambas
organizaciones de ayuda que facilitan la colaboración entre gestores y científicos para desarrollar y aplicar ciencia
práctica, organizaron Fuegos de Cambio convocando a científicos, gestores y artistas, en la coproducción de obras
de arte basadas en la ciencia. Se realizaron encuestas a los visitantes de Fuegos de Cambio para valorar los impactos
al observar la exhibición, como también a los creadores para evaluar los efectos de participar en el proyecto.
Resultados: Los resultados de la encuesta a los visitantes demostraron que Fuegos de Cambio experimentan un
aumento de la comprensión del efecto del cambio climático en los regímenes de fuego, y un incremento del
apoyo de los visitantes a las acciones de manejo para abordar los efectos del cambio climático en el
comportamiento del fuego. El resultado de la encuesta a los creadores de la exhibición demostró que el desarrollo
de Fuegos de Cambio creó nuevas relaciones y redes entre los participantes e incrementó la apreciación de las
colaboraciones entre científicos, gestores y artistas. Específicamente, las relaciones entre la ciencia y el manejo, las
redes y las organizaciones colaborativas pueden haber facilitado el proyecto.
Conclusiones: Fuegos de Cambio demuestra que el arte puede ser un mecanismo efectivo para comunicar
cuestiones ecológicas complejas y que, colaborando en el desarrollo del trabajo artístico, científicos y gestores
pueden crear nuevas alianzas.
Introduction
Over the last century, the dry forests of the United
States Southwest, defined here as Arizona and New
Mexico, have seen a shift from frequent, low-severity fire
regimes to more infrequent, higher-severity fire regimes
(Swetnam et al. 1999; Allen 2007). As a result, dry for-
ests are burning outside their historic fire regimes with
increased size,
severity,
and
frequency
(Wasserman
2020). Over the last two decades, the area burned and
percent area burned at high severity has increased across
forests and woodlands in the Southwest (Singleton et al.
2019). The increased severity and fire behavior are due
to changes in fuel structure (Covington and Moore
1994), and more recently have been linked to climate
warming (Littell et al. 2009; Abatzoglou and Williams
2016; Gonzalez et al. 2018; Mueller et al. 2020).
These ongoing changes to fire regimes in the South-
west affect fire managers,1 who must engage with diverse
audiences that include scientists, policymakers, other
land managers, and the general public about the com-
plexities of fire ecology and associated management
decisions. It can be challenging to communicate fire
management decisions to the public, and local know-
ledge and education levels can affect community percep-
tions (Diaz et al. 2016). Proactive fire management that
reduces fire risk can also be hampered by managers’
perceptions of community pressure and expectations
and by internal pressures within agencies (Steelman and
McCaffrey 2011). Managers are required to use the best
available science, but what that constitutes can be
unclear (Esch et al. 2018). Numerous individual charac-
teristics, such as manager beliefs about research, willing-
ness to experiment, and relationships with scientists, can
affect how managers use science in decision making
(Wright 2010). Science is mostly used by managers
during the planning process and to inform treatment
prescriptions (Hunter 2016).
To create a more robust understanding of and support
for science-driven management, boundary organizations
have emerged to bridge management, science,2 policy,
and public spheres (Kocher et al. 2012). Boundary orga-
nizations are entities that develop and deliver actionable
scientific information and facilitate ongoing dialogue
among different knowledge spheres (Guston 2001; Cash
et al. 2003). They facilitate science communication and
the co-production of knowledge through collaborative
processes with scientists and stakeholders focused on
developing actionable scientific information (Meadow
et al. 2015; Bremer and Meisch 2017). Knowledge co-
production has been demonstrated to facilitate the appli-
cation of science in decision-making (Dilling and Lemos
2011; McNie 2013; Wall et al. 2017).
The Joint Fire Science Program (JFSP) Fire Science
Exchange Network (FSEN) is an example of a boundary
organization that works in fire and forest management.
The FSEN consists of regional boundary organizations
called Fire Science Exchanges (FSE) designed to facilitate
science-to-action and knowledge exchange about wild-
land fire among scientists, managers, policymakers, and
other stakeholders. Boundary organizations such as the
1Fire managers are individuals who make decisions about the
preparation for, suppression and implementation of, and recovery from
fires.
2Science is defined as the rigorous, systematic process of gathering,
analyzing, and interpreting data about natural and social systems.
Scientific information is the output of the scientific process.

FSEs are beneficial for organizing information about fire
science and strengthening relationships among fire sci-
entists and managers (Kocher et al. 2012). The FSEs
have consistently used multiple outreach methods and
materials (e.g., conferences, workshops, webinars, field
trips, and numerous virtual and written outputs) to
interact with their audiences and have incorporated self-
evaluation and learning methods into their outreach ap-
proaches to inform their strategic direction using audi-
ence feedback (Maletsky et al. 2018; Colavito et al.
2019).
Using audience and partner feedback and evaluations,
FSEs have expanded the ways in which they facilitate col-
laboration and communicate to broader audiences. One ex-
ample of this is combining management, science, and art.
There is increasing attention on the intersection of science
and art to communicate scientific concepts to broader audi-
ences and garner support for management actions that em-
brace complexity and uncertainty (Swanson et al. 2008;
Halpern 2012; Swanson 2015; Rathwell and Armitage
2016). Pairing scientific knowledge with other knowledge
can draw attention to issues, facilitate communication, and
reframe discussions (Miles 2010; Curtis et al. 2012; St.
George et al. 2017). Collaborations between scientists and
artists generate diversity of thought that allows for novel
questions and unconventional application of science,
which can encourage new science-management solutions
(Scheffer et al. 2015; Thomsen 2015; Connelly et al. 2016).
The arts engage different audiences and can create new lines
of communication that enhance understanding of technical
messages (Heras et al. 2016; Johansson and Isgren 2017).
Although there is significant potential for manage-
ment, science, and art collaborations to garner under-
standing and support for science and management,
understanding of how to effectively integrate science,
management, and art is limited. Examples of projects
that attempt this are needed. This paper highlights one
such example from the Southwest, which took a new ap-
proach to communicating the impacts of climate change
on forest and fire management through the lens of art.
Fires of Change was a collaborative project that used art
as a method to bridge multi-faceted ideas about fire
science and management in a changing climate. The
project
was
led
by
two
boundary
organizations:
Southwest Fire Science Consortium (SWFSC, a JFSP
FSE), and Landscape Conservation Initiative (LCI).3 Fires
of Change sought to engage the public on the predicted
changes to fire in a warming climate, promote under-
standing
of
science
and
management,
and
make
scientific information accessible to a wider audience.
This paper provides information about the development
of Fires of Change, surveys to assess its impacts, and a
discussion of how science-management relationships,
networks, and boundary organizations may have helped
facilitate the project.
Fires of Change Background
In 2013, SWFSC, LCI, and Flagstaff Arts Council (FAC;
Flagstaff, Arizona) partnered to develop the Fires of
Change art exhibit to communicate about the shifting
fire regimes of the Southwest through the lens of multi-
media art. By creating an art exhibit about the modern
alterations of the natural fire regime due to management
practices and climate change, Fires of Change sought to
reach broader audiences than those typically involved in
land management conversations. The goal was to chal-
lenge these audiences to think differently—or for the
first time—about what is being done to adapt wildland
fire management to a warming climate and growing
communities, and what steps could be taken to help en-
sure a sustainable future for communities and forests.
This work was inspired by In a Time of Change: The Art
of Fire, a project led by the Alaska Fire Science Consor-
tium from 2012 to 2013 (Trainor et al. 2013) and
Burnished Landscapes (2013), an art–science project co-
led by LCI and Flagstaff-based artist, Kate Aitchison.
The Fires of Change partners covered a broad suite of
fire ecology and management topics during educational
field trips for artists. The depth of science translation
was carried through to the exhibit and was adapted for
attendees.
In the fall of 2013, FAC solicited applications from art-
ists, locally and nationally. They selected 11 artists who
work in a range of media, such as quilting, filmmaking,
ceramics, poetry, drawing, and mixed-media installa-
tions. SWFSC and LCI drew upon their networks of fire
professionals and scientists and experience with field
education programs to design a four-day fire-science
and management field trip or “bootcamp” in September
of 2014 on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, on
lands managed by the US National Park Service and
USDA Forest Service, and other fire-affected areas in
northern Arizona. The 11 artists, 14 project staff and fire
science
professionals,
and
three
media
and
art
organization staff spent four days immersed in the eco-
logical, historical, and spatial landscapes of fire in the
Southwest. During the bootcamp, the artists were tasked
with learning scientific information about the complexity
of fire issues, including those that climate change and
human intervention have modified, in dry conifer forests
in the Southwest (Fig. 1). The bootcamp offered a
relationship-building experience in which researchers,
managers, and artists mingled. The artists relied on these

relationships during their creative processes, which fur-
ther incorporated science into their final artwork (Figs. 2
and 3). For example, one artist kept in touch with
agency representatives to ensure accurate depiction of
fire relationships in fabric artwork (Figs. 4 and 5).
The Fires of Change exhibit was designed to look at fire
management and climate change in a unique, multifaceted
approach. In addition to the exhibit, the project organizers
arranged seven science lectures, most paired with artist
presenters, to draw more community members into the
conversation about fire and climate in the Southwest. This
allowed for science interpretation by scientists and expla-
nations of how artists integrated science into their art.
Organizers also facilitated production of three videos: two
that provided a description of the project process (Fires of
Change – Part 1, Fires of Change – Part 2) and one that
discussed the basic science on which the art was based
(Fires of Change – Science Video). The basic science video
played on a loop throughout the 2015 exhibit in Flagstaff
and all were available on exhibit websites. Lastly, there
were several poster-sized signs at the exhibit with historic-
ally influential quotes from scientific journal articles,
policy documents, and books on fire history and manage-
ment dating from 1943 to 2014 (Figs. 6 and 7). The exhibit
website (https://www.swfireconsortium.org/fires-of-change/)
and exhibit catalog provide additional details about the art-
work (Flagstaff Arts Council 2016).
The Fires of Change exhibit was shown at three loca-
tions: Flagstaff, Arizona, from September to October 2015;
Tucson, Arizona, from November 2015 to April 2016; and

Albuquerque, New Mexico, from May to July 2018. The
Flagstaff exhibit included the art, paired artist-scientist
presentations, videos, and quotation posters. The Tucson
exhibit included the art, paired artist-scientist presenta-
tions,
and
quotation
posters.
The
third
exhibit
in
Albuquerque included paired artist-scientist presentations
and a family day with presentations oriented toward chil-
dren. To increase visitation, partnering organizations ad-
vertised the exhibit to their email and membership lists
and on social media. Organizers shared information with
agency public affairs staff, and the USDA Forest Service
Southwestern Region scheduled a group visit that in-
cluded the Regional Forester to the Albuquerque exhibit.
In Flagstaff, public radio ads and listings within the
Flagstaff Festival of Science program were used to adver-
tise the exhibit. Reaching out to multiple audiences—sup-
porters of both the arts and sciences—generated positive
results. Across the three venues, nearly 12 000 people
viewed the exhibit.
Fires of Change surveys
Exhibit visitor surveys were conducted to collect infor-
mation about the exhibit’s impact on the general public’s
understanding
and
perceptions
of
fire
science
and
management in Flagstaff and Tucson. No surveys were
conducted in Albuquerque. The exhibit visitor surveys
were the same in Flagstaff and Tucson except for a
question about exhibit advertisement (Additional file 1).
Respondents self-selected to complete a paper survey
after viewing the exhibit. In Flagstaff, volunteers solicited
respondents during exhibit events, and paper surveys
were left at the exhibit exit during regular hours. In Tuc-
son, surveys were only available at the exhibit exit during
regular hours. There were 115 total respondents: 69 in
Flagstaff and 46 in Tucson.
Exhibit creator surveys were also conducted for the
SWFSC Executive Board, artists, and scientists and
managers involved in the exhibit development to gather
information about their experiences participating in Fires
of Change (Additional file 2). The surveys were adminis-
tered online using Survey Monkey and distributed by
email by the SWFSC. There were 24 exhibit creator
respondents,
including 11 SWFSC Executive
Board
members, nine artists, and four scientists or managers.
The board members did not participate in the project
development and dissemination, but their perspectives
were included, as they help to set SWFSC’s goals and
direction.
Both the exhibit visitor and creator surveys were de-
signed to be short evaluations to provide the SWFSC
with basic insight about the outcomes of Fires of Change.
Due to the use of convenience sampling and small
sample sizes, only descriptive statistics are provided and
no statistical conclusions are drawn. Open-ended survey

questions were organized according to general themes,
but no formal qualitative analysis was done.
Results
Fires of Change visitor survey
Visitor survey respondents were asked to rate their level
of understanding of how climate change is affecting fire
regimes in the Southwest before and after attending
Fires of Change. Results were reported with Flagstaff and
Tucson respondents combined. Only 20.87% of respon-
dents self-reported an advanced level of understanding
before attending the exhibit, but after attending the
exhibit, 34.78% of respondents reported advanced under-
standing (Fig. 8). The majority of respondents had at
least a moderate (38.26%) or basic (33.04%) understand-
ing of how climate change is affecting fire regimes in the
Southwest prior to attending the exhibit. After attending
the exhibit, 57.39% of respondents expressed a moderate
understanding (Fig. 8).
Respondents were also asked to report the degree to
which they were more or less likely to accept local
management actions designed to address the effects of
climate change on fire behavior after viewing the exhibit.
The majority of respondents were more likely (75.65%)
to support local management actions, while 21.74% of
respondents expressed no change in opinion. One re-
spondent (0.87%) was less likely to support management
action.
Comments in the surveys provided additional insight
into the impact of combining artistic and scientific per-
spectives. For example, one respondent stated, “The art-
ist and scientist talks were extremely informative and
provided important context for understanding the works
of art.” Another respondent noted, “The blending of art
and science is such an important way to bridge under-
standing.” Respondents commented on the emotional
impact of the exhibit. One stated, “The art not only in-
creases our intellectual understanding of the impact of
climate change, but more importantly the emotional
level. It is there where change takes place.” On the other
hand, one respondent noted, “Barely any of the art actu-
ally touches [on] regeneration and restoration. The
artists mostly tell a story of destruction and mismanage-
ment, not of complexity and scientific uncertainty.”
Fires of Change exhibit creator survey
Exhibit creators were asked to indicate their level of
agreement with the statement, “Art can be an effective
mechanism for building public awareness and under-
standing about important issues such as fire and climate
science” (Additional file 2). Seventy-nine percent of re-
spondents strongly agreed, and 21% agreed with the
statement. The artist group (n = 9) strongly agreed
(89%) or agreed (11%) that their involvement in Fires of
Change had inspired them to discuss fire and climate
science with others. Sixty-seven percent of the artist par-
ticipants indicated that they had shared their knowledge
of fire and climate science with more than 21 people.
The artists spoke positively about the field trips and in-
person interactions while creating the exhibit. One
respondent noted,
The tours to the forests, the fire station, and
especially the more interactive and hands-on experi-
ences (fire-truck tools and equipment tour, getting
tree-core samples) were my favorite. Also, the oppor-
tunity to exchange ideas with the artists and scien-
tists more casually was great.
Artists also noted positive outcomes to their careers
due to participation in the project. For example, one art-
ist stated,
It was a challenge that I liked to take on. It forced
me to speak, think, and feel about a topic that I
normally would not consider in my work. It gave me
the opportunity to make art with a community of

artists for the public with a specific goal and
outcome.
The scientist and manager group (n = 4) agreed (75%)
or strongly agreed (25%) that the exhibit accurately
reflected the scientific message that they hoped to con-
vey. This group also strongly agreed (50%) or agreed
(25%) that their involvement had inspired them to
discuss fire and climate with a non-scientific audience.
Furthermore, 50% indicated that they had shared their
experience with 11 to 20 colleagues, and 25% had shared
with more than 21 colleagues. This group also appreci-
ated the field trips. One respondent noted, “The most
effective elements were the unstructured conversations...
These allowed two-way conversation and mutual under-
standing of the topics.” This group also expressed posi-
tive outcomes from their participation. One manager
stated, “It was a great experience to see different per-
spectives (from the artists) on the work I do every day.”
And one scientist noted, “This project changed the way I
see using art to share science and I am a true believer
now.”
The Executive Board (n = 11) strongly agreed (55%)
or agreed (36%) that they would support a similar
project in the future. Only four board respondents
attended the exhibit due to geographic limitations,
but those attendees all agreed that it was an effective
mechanism for building public awareness and under-
standing about fire and climate science. For example,
one stated,
Public awareness and outreach are challenging. The
Fires of Change project represents an innovative and
creative way to bring awareness to the public with-
out the typical negative overtones of using fire to
manage the landscape. These types of projects should
be continued/funded once every two years.
Another noted, “Fires of Change was a fantastic project
that opened my eyes to how powerful a science–art
collaboration can be!”
Discussion
This example of a science-based art exhibit adds to the
ever-strengthening hypothesis that joining scientific in-
formation and artistic impression can shift the public
conversation about ecological issues (Scheffer et al.
2015; Jacobson et al. 2016; Rathwell and Armitage 2016).
Although the qualitative nature of the surveys and small
sample do not allow for robust scientific conclusions, a
number of possible explanations may have facilitated the
outcomes of Fires of Change.
Fires of Change outcomes
The visitor survey results indicate that, for those sur-
veyed, Fires of Change increased reported understanding
about fire and climate change. Respondents were also
more likely to support active fire management (e.g.,
mechanical fuels reduction and prescribed burns) to
address climate change. Flagstaff residents possess rela-
tively high levels of formal educational attainment (e.g.,
45.1% of persons 25 years or older has a bachelor’s
degree or higher, US Census Bureau 2019) and are
relatively savvy and supportive of management action to
address fire behavior and effects (Diaz et al. 2016). That
an art exhibit could enhance public engagement in man-
agement in a place where people are already somewhat
attuned to these issues points to the promise of this
method.

conducted in Flagstaff, Arizona, in fall 2015, and Tucson, Arizona, in spring 2016. Results from both locations are combined. Surveys were
designed to collect information about the general public’s level of understanding of fire science and management

Exhibit creators reported that their experience partici-
pating in Fires of Change had a positive impact. For ex-
ample, the project inspired the majority of artists,
scientists, and managers to speak with a broader audi-
ence about fire and climate change. One of the strengths
of bringing artists, scientists, and managers together for
this project was the opportunity to weave social and
knowledge networks together to communicate about
complex scientific and management concepts (Feldman
and Ingram 2009; Owen et al. 2012). The artists who
participated in the project can also act as ambassadors
or conduits of ecological knowledge to their communi-
ties (Heras et al. 2016; Johansson and Isgren 2017). An
artist may be a more compelling communicator to
different subsets of the community than a scientist or
manager.
The benefits derived from Fires of Change are not, of
course, without costs. All of the partnering organizations
devoted staff time to orchestrate the project. The boot-
camp required funding for travel costs, meals, and sti-
pends for artists and presenters. Additional resources
paid for materials to create the art, build the exhibit, and
advertise the exhibit and associated events. While these
were significant investments, the project delivered a high
return on investment through the engagement with
novel audiences and increased public understanding of
fire ecology and management. It is worthy of replication
in other geographies and disciplines.
While the survey results are encouraging, they only
represent a self-selected, and therefore biased, sample of
survey respondents who: (1) came to an art exhibit about
fire and climate, and (2) were willing to complete a
survey. Similarly, the artists, scientists, and managers
who participated in the project opted in to the experi-
ence because they liked the idea of combining science
and art. Nonetheless, the results provide insights for
designing future research to understand the impact of
interdisciplinary collaborations to communicate science.
Future research should explore the effect of art on larger
populations and identify the outcomes and impacts of
collaborative
efforts
among
scientists,
artists,
and
managers.
Relationship and network building
The process of developing Fires of Change generated
new relationships, trust, and knowledge networks among
exhibit creators. For example, the bootcamp process fa-
cilitated the development of new relationships among
artists, managers, and scientists, and created credibility
and trust that allowed for more knowledge sharing
(Peters et al. 1997). The bootcamp agenda was designed
to allow participants to process information together,
learn about each other, and build trust. Throughout the
process, developing relationships and increasing trust led
to more open dialogue, greater comfort in asking ques-
tions, and sustained interactions following the bootcamp.
The relationships built in this process likely strength-
ened the artwork and understanding between art and
science (Swanson 2015).
One potential shortcoming of the process was that the
interactions among the exhibit creators were left to
informally continue as needed following the bootcamp,
rather than being actively facilitated. Because of the
short duration of the bootcamp, artists may have felt
overwhelmed with such a large amount of information
in a short period of time. Changes in the structure of
this process could help spread the flow of information
across a longer period.
Importance of boundary organizations
Fires of Change represented a new approach by two
boundary organizations—SWFSC and LCI—to expand
their outreach methods and materials and incorporate
new artistic perspectives into the conversation about fire
science and management. The SWFSC and LCI used
their convening, translating, and collaborating functions
(Buizer et al. 2016) to coordinate the bootcamp and
formed a new partnership with FAC for the subsequent
development of science-based artwork. Fires of Change
was also an opportunity for SWFSC and LCI to engage
with and learn from artists who work to communicate
and create change in realms beyond fire and climate
science and management (e.g., Swanson et al. 2008). The
Fires of Change process required ongoing, sustained
interaction among the project participants. Thus, it
represented a form of knowledge coproduction (Bremer
and
Meisch
2017),
specifically,
science-based
art
designed to reach a broader audience and produce
actionable outcomes in the form of increased under-
standing of and support for fire management.
The facilitation provided by SWFSC and LCI may have
resulted in numerous benefits to participants. For ex-
ample, novel partnerships among scientists, managers,
and artists emerged, which helped catalyze new ideas
and energize participants (Jacobson et al. 2016). Scientist
participants
felt
that
they
were
able
to
effectively
communicate science to both artists and exhibit at-
tendees, and managers may see greater support from
within the community for their management actions
based on the survey results. If gaining the support of
local communities is necessary to implement land man-
agement projects (Diaz et al. 2016), engaging boundary
organizations may bridge gaps and enable projects to
move forward.
Conclusion
Fires of Change, a collaborative art exhibit designed to
communicate about the shifting fire regimes of the

Southwest through the lens of multimedia art, served as
proof of concept that art can be an effective mechanism
for (1) increasing understanding of fire and climate
change; (2) building public support for management
actions; and (3) developing partnerships among diverse
science, management, and artistic audiences. The Fires
of Change example highlights the role that boundary or-
ganizations can play in facilitating collaboration among
science and management spheres, creating new spaces
for innovation and adaptation, and enhancing communi-
cation of technical and scientific messages to the general
public. Relationships built during the Fires of Change
process appear to have strengthened understanding
across science, management, and artist participants.
Future research is needed to validate these preliminary
conclusions and explore future collaborations that merge
arts, science, and management with more robust survey
methodology and sample sizes. Nonetheless, future art,
science, and management collaborations like Fires of
Change should be replicated to encourage complex,
interdisciplinary conversations and relationships among
artists,
scientists,
and
managers
to
find
innovative
solutions to the challenges presented by climate change
and fire.
