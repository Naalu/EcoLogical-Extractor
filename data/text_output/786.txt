ABSTRACT 
CHEATGRASS – NATIVE PLANT COMMUNITY INTERACTIONS IN AN 
INVADED SOUTHWESTERN FOREST 
CHRISTOPHER M. MCGLONE 
 
Invasions by nonnative plant species such as cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) are a 
major concern in many ecosystems worldwide. When invasive nonnative species 
dominate a new ecosystem, they can alter biodiversity, species composition, nutrient 
cycles, disturbance regimes, and other ecosystem functions and processes. In 2003, 
cheatgrass rapidly spread through the Mt. Trumbull Ecosystem Restoration Project in the 
Uinkaret Mountains of northwest Arizona. In several areas, cheatgrass became the 
dominant herbaceous species, although native vegetation continued to dominate a 
substantial portion of the landscape. The three studies I present here examine the roles of 
disturbance, propagule pressure, competition, and resource availability on cheatgrass – 
native plant dynamics. The first study examines the susceptibility of remnant native 
vegetation to cheatgrass invasion, and persistence of the cheatgrass invasion in the 
presence of elevated disturbance through biomass removal and/or elevated propagule 
pressure through seed additions. Both cheatgrass- and native-dominated areas were 
persistent for three years after treatment. The second study monitored changes in plant 
species richness, composition, and distribution in invaded and non-invaded areas. The 
two community types only shared 52 – 59% of plant species one year after invasion. By 
the fifth year, the invaded and non-invaded areas only shared 32 – 41% of plant species. 
Furthermore, the invaded plots contained more nonnative species than the uninvaded 
plots. By 2007, nonnative species accounted for 30% of species richness in the invaded

community. The third study was a greenhouse experiment testing cheatgrass competition 
against two native perennial grass species at different levels of competition, with nitrogen 
and phosphorus additions, and at high and low water availability. Competition with only 
a single mature perennial grass individual significantly reduced cheatgrass growth and 
seed production regardless of nutrient and water availability. The greenhouse results, 
combined with the field studies suggest that the maintenance of a robust native perennial 
grass community can be important in a plant community’s ability to resist invasion by 
nonnative annual grass species.

Vinton and Burke 1995; Booth et al. 2003b; Norton et al. 2004; Sperry et al. 2006), 
although reduced N mineralization has also been reported (Trent et al. 1994; Evans et al. 
2001). Nitrification rates can also increase (Booth et al. 2003b; Hawkes et al. 2005).

exudates (Watt and Evans 1999; Callaway and Aschehoag 2000; Miller et al. 2006 a,b; 
Thorpe et al. 2006) or leachates from aboveground material (Cannon et al. 1995; Duda et 
al. 2003). Additionally, the pool of plant available P can be reduced if the nonnative is a 
better competitor for the resource (Yoder and Nowak 2000; Wang et al. 2004; LeJeune et 
al. 2006). ........................................................................................................................... 27

The first chapter of this dissertation is a literature review. The last three chapters 
were written in journal manuscript format. Since they are intended for publication with 
co-authors, I have retained the third person pronouns throughout those chapters. 
Additionally, there was unavoidable redundancy in the chapters, particularly in the 
Methods and Reference sections. The second chapter is currently in review with 
Biological Invasions, the third chapter is formatted for submission to Plant Ecology, and

The role of soil nitrogen and phosphorus in arid and semi-arid ecosystems invaded 
by nonnative plant species 
 
Abstract 
 
As nonnative plant species invade more arid and semi-arid landscapes, there is 
increasing interest in the interaction of soil nutrients and plant invasions. Soil nitrogen 
(N) and phosphorus (P) are often the most limiting soil nutrients in arid and semi-arid 
ecosystems. The differential ability of native and nonnative species to exploit these 
nutrients influences spatial and temporal patterns of plant invasion. I reviewed the role of 
soil N and P in invasion dynamics, the influence of plant invasions on soil N and P, and 
the utility of altering soil N and P to mitigate nonnative species dominance in invaded 
ecosystems. Many invasive nonnative plant species preferentially invade areas with high 
levels of plant-available N. This relationship can be enhanced by fire, which generates 
pulses of plant-available soil N and disturbs the extant vegetation. Less is known about 
the role of plant-available soil P and invasion success. After invasion, plants can 
influence soil N dynamics by altering fire regimes, soil biota, or by depleting resources. 
Post-invasion soil P dynamics are complex. Some nonnative plants can alter the 
availability of soil P through input of acidic compounds via root exudation or 
aboveground biomass leachates that liberate calcium-bound P. Furthermore, some 
nonnative plants have been shown to deplete soil P through rapid uptake. Manipulation of 
the link between invasion success and available N and P may provide a mechanism for 
mitigating nonnative plant invasions. Most research on this topic has been on soil N 
manipulation through carbon additions such as sucrose or sawdust. Plant-available P can 
also be altered through calcium additions to the soil. To date, however, successful

invasion reduction through soil nutrient manipulation has proven either impractical or 
ineffective.

Introduction 
 
Nonnative plant invasions are a major global concern. Plant invasions can result 
in the loss or alteration of biodiversity, changes in disturbance regimes such as the fire 
cycle, and changes in ecosystem processes such as soil hydrology and nutrient cycling 
(Bock et al. 1986; Melgoza et al. 1990; D'Antonio and Vitousek 1992; Hobbs and 
Huenneke 1992; Mack et al. 2000; Belnap and Phillips 2001; Evans et al. 2001; 
Ehrenfeld 2003; Brooks et al. 2004; Gerlach Jr. 2004; Gurevitch and Padilla 2004; 
Kulmatiski et al. 2006). Such changes are evident in invaded areas of arid and semi-arid 
ecosystems of the western United States. A number of annual nonnative plant species that 
invade arid and semi-arid ecosystems of the West are highly dependent on high 
availability of soil nutrients, especially nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) (Marschner 
1995). There is also evidence that some longer-lived nonnative species thrive in high 
nutrient sites as well (Floyd et al. 2006; Miller and Seastedt 2009). N and P are 
considered to be the most commonly limiting nutrients for plant productivity in many 
ecosystems worldwide (Elser et al. 2007), including the drier regions of the West. This 
has generated increasing interest in the role of soil N and P interactions with nonnative 
plant invasions with regards to ecosystem invasibility, post-invasion ecosystem change, 
and remediation of invasions. The purpose of this review is to synthesize published 
research on the relationship between plant-available N and P and nonnative plants in arid 
and semi-arid ecosystems of the western United States and to evaluate how such 
knowledge can be incorporated into management strategies for invaded areas. 
There is evidence that success and spatial distribution of a number of plant 
invasions in the West are often influenced by the quantity and distribution of plant-

 
 
4 
 
available N and P. Nonnative plants commonly invade areas with higher soil nutrients, 
particularly if nutrient availability is elevated due to disturbances such as fire or cattle 
grazing (Hobbs and Huenneke 1992). Many annual nonnative plants are better 
competitors for soil nutrients than native annuals or perennial seedlings. Conversely, 
perennial species, particularly grasses, are more efficient at extracting and conserving N 
and P on nutrient-poor soils (Grime 1977; Chapin 1980). 
 
Once a nonnative species dominates a plant community, cycling and plant 
availability of N and P are often altered (Trent et al. 1994; Vinton and Burke 1995; Evans 
et al. 2001; Hawkes et al. 2005; Sperry et al. 2006). Several mechanisms contribute to the 
changes in post-invasion nutrient availability, including changes in soil moisture, C:N 
ratio, fire frequency and intensity, soil biota, and root exudates (Booth et al. 2003a; 
Belnap et al. 2005; Saetre and Stark 2005; Belnap and Sherrod 2009). There is evidence 
that post-invasion changes in soil N and P can help perpetuate nonnative plant dominance 
by maintaining a competitive advantage for nonnative plants. 
 
The close link between nonnative plants and soil nutrients has encouraged 
ecologists to test the utility of altering soil nutrients in order to reduce nonnative plant 
dominance in invaded ecosystems. Nitrogen is the most frequently targeted nutrient, with 
carbon amendments to the soil being the most common treatment (Beckstead and 
Augspurger 2004; Keeley and McGinnis 2007). Carbon amendments stimulate soil 
microbial activity, which in turn binds pools of plant available N in microbial biomass. 
Some studies have also examined the utility of reducing P availability in the soil through 
chemical amendments such as calcium oxide (Belnap et al. 2003; Keeley and McGinnis 
2007).

I reviewed 69 articles that addressed the interaction of soil N and P and nonnative 
plant invasions. I focused on information from arid and semi-arid regions of the Interior 
West of the United States. The review mostly focuses on deserts and grasslands, but 
includes examples from other non-riparian woodland and low-elevation forests. I 
examined the literature over the past 100 years, but when several studies reported similar 
results, I focused on the most recent studies. 
The role of N and P in invasion dynamics 
 
There is rarely information available regarding soil nutrients at the time of 
invasion. Furthermore, researchers are, understandably, disinclined to induce large-scale 
plant invasions to test hypotheses about soil nutrient-invasion dynamics. Most 
information on this topic, therefore, comes from comparing neighboring invaded and 
non-invaded areas or from soil nutrient manipulations made after invasion or in 
greenhouse studies. While these methods are far from perfect, they do give insight about 
the role of soil N and P in constraining or promoting invasion. 
Nitrogen 
 
High levels of plant-available nutrients are often associated with increased risk of 
invasion, while low fertility soils can be resistant to invasion. A good example of 
resistance to invasion is serpentine soil in California grasslands. Serpentine soils are 
created from tectonically derived rock and tend to have low N and P availability 
(Huenneke et al. 1990). While serpentine soils have shown little susceptibility to 
invasion, many neighboring areas of fertile nonserpentine soils have become invaded by 
annual grasses (Harrison et al. 2001; Harrison et al. 2003). The higher fertility levels are 
credited with promoting exotic dominance on these soils (Huenneke et al. 1990). 

 
 
6 
 
 
Elevated plant-available soil N has been linked to success of invasive annual 
grasses (Rickard et al. 1973; Bashkin et al. 2003; Brooks 2003; Lowe et al. 2003). 
Several greenhouse and field experiments with cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) show 
greater growth of cheatgrass with additions of NH4 and NO3 (Dakheel et al. 1993; Hoopes 
and Hall 2002). Cheatgrass displays increased competitive ability with elevated N levels 
when compared to the native perennial grass, blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) (Lowe et 
al. 2003) and the exotic perennial grass, desert wheatgrass (Agropyron desertorum) 
(Yoder and Caldwell 2002). Similar results have been observed in California with ripgut 
brome (Bromus diandrus) (Hoopes and Hall 2002). Initial increases in N generated a 
strong response in cheatgrass growth; further additions produced little additional response 
(Yoder and Caldwell 2002; Lowe et al. 2003). This result suggests that there are essential 
nutrients or resources other than N limiting further increases in the competitive ability of 
cheatgrass. 
 
Fire can alter soil N by increasing the availability of NO3 and NH4 which 
sometimes promotes the spread of nonnative species. Studies in ponderosa pine (Pinus 
ponderosa) forests and pinyon-juniper (Pinus edulis-Juniperus osteosperma) woodlands 
have documented increases in several nonnative species after especially severe fires, 
including Dalmatian toadflax (Linaria dalmatica) (Korb et al. 2004; Dodge et al. 2008), 
common mullein (Verbascum thapsus) (Korb et al. 2004; Bataineh et al. 2006), and 
cheatgrass (Floyd et al. 2006; Keeley and McGinnis 2007; Laughlin and Fulé 2008; 
McGlone et al. 2009). Increased plant-available N has been reported in association with 
some post-fire nonnative invasions (Korb et al. 2004).

While these studies give a limited portrait of soil N levels that facilitate invasion, 
they suggest inferences about the role of N in exotic plant invasion. The N-amendment 
experiments, coupled with information on N paucity in serpentine soils, suggest that N-
poor soils are less likely to support a nonnative community. Assuming other essential 
nutrients quickly limit growth after N-limitation has been released, greater overall soil 
fertility would have a positive influence on invasion success. This supports the theory 
that ruderal species, such as invasive grasses and forbs, have better establishment and 
growth in areas that have higher soil fertility (Grime 1977; Chapin 1980). 
Phosphorus 
While few studies have examined the role of plant-available P (HPO4) in 
facilitating invasion, Bashkin et al. (2003) determined that cheatgrass occurred 
preferentially in sites with higher total P. Miller et al. (2006a) showed cheatgrass 
performance increased in the presence of elevated P, though the effect varied depending 
on the growth stage of the plants and moisture availability. Since P occurs in low 
concentrations in serpentine soils, it is reasonable to assume this nutrient is important in 
limiting invasion by annual grasses (Huenneke et al. 1990). Greenhouse studies have 
shown increases in cheatgrass biomass production with additions of P (Dakheel et al. 
1993; Gundale et al. 2008). Results have been inconsistent, however, with some studies 
reporting little or no response to P amendments, depending on soils used in the 
experiment (Gundale et al. 2008; Miller and Seastedt 2009). 
Changes in soil properties after invasion 
 
Several studies have compared soil N and P dynamics in non-invaded areas with 
recent invasions and/or long-term invasions. These studies suggest that plant-available N 

 
 
8 
 
and P can be altered by invasion, but there are few data available for both pre- and post-
invasion periods. Most information comes from adjacent non-invaded communities that 
are assumed to have similar soil properties as the invaded areas prior to invasion. This 
assumption may or may not be accurate and is often unverifiable. 
Nitrogen 
 
Changes in the N cycle after invasion are reliant on several, often interdependent, 
factors including changes in the spatial distribution of plant biomass, soil moisture, soil 
biota, and alterations to the local disturbance regime (e.g., accelerated fire cycle). It is 
difficult to make broad generalizations, however, due to differing soil – plant interactions 
across soil types and invasive species. Research results have reflected this variability, 
with different studies reporting the full range of possible outcomes from increased N 
cycling, to no change, to decreased N cycling after invasion. 
 
Several studies have shown a positive correlation between total soil N and 
nonnative species richness or cover (Bolton et al. 1993; Stohlgren et al. 1999; Bashkin et 
al. 2003; Booth et al. 2003b; Korb et al. 2004; Belnap et al. 2005). In some instances, this 
has been attributed to pre-invasion conditions (Belnap et al. 2005) or relocation of N in 
the soil profile through increased litter production, increases in soil biota near the surface, 
and the lack of N storage in annual nonnative species when compared to native perennials 
(Bolton et al. 1993; Booth et al. 2003b). In the Mohave Desert, Schlesinger et al. (1996) 
detected pre-invasion spatial distribution patterns in soil N in a cheatgrass monoculture, 
14 years after invasion. Furthermore, Svejcar and Sheley (2001) reported no differences 
in total soil N after 40 years of cheatgrass dominance when compared to adjacent non-
invaded sites. In Montana, soil N was slightly lower under spotted knapweed (Centaurea 

 
 
9 
 
stoebe ssp. micranthos) plants, when compared to native perennial grasses, but the trends 
were inconsistent (Hook et al. 2004). In a thinned forest in Colorado, N additions to the 
soil increased Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense) populations (Miller and Seastedt 2009). 
Some nonnative annual grass species can indirectly influence soil N by 
accelerating or perpetuating the fire cycle, such as cheatgrass, red brome (Bromus 
rubens), or Arabian schimsus (Schismus arabicus) (Brooks et al. 2004). These species 
may have the greatest impact on total N in the soil. While fire often generates an 
immediate pulse of plant-available N, the ecosystem experiences a loss of total N due to 
volatilization and biomass removal (D'Antonio and Vitousek 1992). Fire does not, 
however, always lead to a strong increase in nonnative species (Moore et al. 2006; 
Fowler et al. 2008; Kuenzi et al. 2008; Fornwalt et al. 2010). In Washington, Dodson and 
Peterson (2009) detected few nonnative invasive plants in forests three years after 
burning in a wildfire even when N fertilizer was applied. 
 
Nonnative invasion can alter the N cycle, though the response is varied (Fig. 1.1). 
Most of the available information on invasion-induced changes in the N cycle comes 
from research on cheatgrass in the Great Basin. Several studies have shown increased N 
mineralization in cheatgrass-dominated areas, when compared to neighboring native 
communities (Bolton et al. 1993; Booth et al. 2003b). This result was not consistent, 
however, with lower rates of N mineralization detected in arid Utah in cheatgrass-
dominated areas due to higher C:N and lignin:N ratios than the native species (Evans et 
al. 2001). Other studies detected increased levels of NO3 in cheatgrass-dominated areas 
(Norton et al. 2004; Sperry et al. 2006; Chambers et al. 2007). Increased N mineralization 
and soil NO3 have been attributed to accelerated nutrient cycling through rapid 

 
 
10 
 
decomposition of cheatgrass litter (Norton et al. 2004; Sperry et al. 2006) and changes in 
the distribution and diversity of soil flora (Bolton et al. 1993; Belnap and Phillips 2001; 
Belnap et al. 2005). Additionally, temporal interannual variation in soil N cycling, 
consistent with the life cycle of cheatgrass, has been detected. That is, soil N is depleted 
at germination, turnover rates are rapid during growth, and NO3 accumulates in the soil 
after cheatgrass senesces, prior to germination (Booth et al. 2003b). 
 
Nonnative plant interactions with the N cycle are less studied in species other than 
cheatgrass and the results are varied. In California, areas invaded by two nonnative 
annual grasses, slender oat (Avena barbata) and soft brome (Bromus hordeaceus), had 
double the gross nitrification rate and an increased abundance of NH4–oxidizing bacteria 
in the soil when compared to native grassland soils (Hawkes et al. 2005). Areas 
dominated by the annual forb, burningbush (Bassia scoparia), had increased soil N 
mineralization rates (Vinton and Burke 1995), while medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-
medusae) dominated areas can have reduced N mineralization (Trent et al. 1994). 
Phosphorus 
 
Less is known about the influence of nonnative plant invasions on soil – P 
interactions (Fig. 1.2). Amelioration of P limitation commonly occurs by liberating 
calcium (Ca)-bound P from the soil through wetting or rhizosphere acidification 
(Marschner 1995, Hinsinger 1998). Nonnative plant – soil moisture relations are 
complex, with some studies showing a general decrease in soil moisture in invaded areas, 
other studies showing high levels of spatial and temporal variability (Melgoza et al. 1990; 
Booth et al. 2003b; Gerlach 2004; Kulmatiski et al. 2006). The role of invasion-induced 
alterations in water availability and plant-available P is not well-established. Plants 

 
 
11 
 
generally alter soil P availability through biofeedback mechanisms such as acidic root 
exudates or leachates from plant litter (Cannon et al. 1995, Watt and Evans 1999, 
Callaway and Aschehoag 2000, Duda et al. 2003, Miller et al. 2006a,b). 
 
Several nonnative plant species generate root exudates that can free Ca-bound P. 
For example, diffuse knapweed (Centaurea diffusa) releases an allelopathic compound 
(8-hydroquinoline) from its roots which increases uptake of P in diffuse knapweed, but 
can significantly reduce P uptake and biomass production of native perennial grasses 
(Callaway and Aschehoag 2000). The related species, spotted knapweed, exudes (±)-
catechin, an allelopathic chemical that can also free Ca-bound P (Watt and Evans 1999). 
While the elevated plant-available P is generally available for root uptake by all local 
plants, spotted knapweed is highly efficient at absorbing and assimilating P (Thorpe et al. 
2006). There is evidence that root exudates are involved in cheatgrass – native perennial 
grass P dynamics, but the relationship is not clear. Some research suggests that cheatgrass 
liberates Ca-bound P through root exudates (Miller et al. 2006a,b). Other research 
suggests there may be a multi-organism interaction where root exudates from a native 
perennial grass, James’ galleta (Pleuraphis jamesii) promote soil biotic activity that 
liberates calcium-bound P. Thus, James’ galleta can indirectly facilitate P-uptake by 
cheatgrass (Belnap and Sherrod 2009). 
 
Leaf tissue leachates, such as oxalates, can also increase soil plant-available P. 
Two annual nonnative forbs, halogeton (Halogeton glomeratus) and Russian thistle 
(Salsola tragus), produce oxalates in leaf tissue which leaches into the soil via rain and 
snow. Soils under both these species have higher plant-available P than soils under 
neighboring species (Cannon et al. 1995, Duda et al. 2003). While plant-available P may 

 
 
12 
 
increase in areas invaded by Russian thistle, total P may decline due to removal of litter 
through wind and rain (Allen 1993). 
 
Plant competition plays an important role in depleting the pool of labile P and 
some nonnative invaders can acquire P at higher rates than their native competitors. For 
example, the perennial nonnative grass, smooth brome (Bromus inermis) and a related 
annual grass, red brome, can reduce plant-available P at faster rates than neighboring 
species, although the competitive advantage is not manifested against all native species 
(Yoder and Nowak 2000, Wang et al. 2004). The depletion of soil P by nonnatives is not 
ubiquitous, however. LeJuene et al. (2006) detected no change in plant–available P after 
removal of diffuse knapweed, suggesting that diffuse knapweed was not having an 
adverse impact on the availability of P in the soil. 
Altering soil nutrients to manage invasions 
Nitrogen 
 
The dependence of some nonnative plant species on highly fertile soils is viewed 
as a potential “Achilles’ heel” that can be exploited by land managers to mitigate 
invasions. One proposed mechanism for altering soil fertility, and thereby reducing 
nonnative plant dominance, is to reduce N levels through carbon amendments. The 
addition of C to the soil promotes bacterial growth which should, at least temporarily, 
bind up much of the available N in the soil (Fig. 1.1). The addition of sucrose as a C 
source can be effective at reducing nonnative plant biomass and density. In Utah, 
cheatgrass density and biomass were reduced by nearly half during the growing season 
following C addition (Beckstead and Augspurger 2004). A similar study in Colorado 
detected an approximately 20% reduction in cheatgrass cover in response to sucrose soil 

 
 
13 
 
amendments (Rowe et al. 2009). Another study in Colorado reported reduced relative 
growth rates in diffuse knapweed with sucrose amendments, but survival rates were 
higher (Suding et al. 2004). Canada thistle cover was also reduced by sucrose 
amendments in thinned Colorado forests (Miller and Seastedt 2009). Sucrose, however, is 
expensive and impractical for use over large landscapes. Furthermore, little is known 
about how long this treatment will be effective or how often it must be reapplied before 
the nonnative species will be reduced to subordinates in the system. Sawdust has been 
proposed as an alternative, less expensive, form of C-amendment. This, however, has not 
been effective. In California, there was no change in community composition to sawdust 
additions in a diverse nonnative forb and grass community (Corbin and D'Antonio 2004). 
Similar results were seen with cheatgrass in the Sierra Nevada (Keeley and McGinnis 
2007) and a mixed community of nonnative forbs and grasses in eastern Oregon 
(Huddleston and Young 2005). These results are likely due to slow decomposition of 
woody material. Conversely, woodchip amendments from pinyon-juniper woodland 
mastication treatments increased cheatgrass cover after 2.5 years (Owen et al. 2009). The 
authors suggest this was due to increased soil moisture under the woodchips. Results 
have been improved by the combination of sawdust and sucrose. In Colorado, diffuse 
knapweed biomass was reduced by almost 40% with sucrose and sawdust amendments 
(Reever Morghan and Seastedt 1999). Soil NO3 and NH4 were significantly reduced in 
the first month after treatment, but the differences faded thereafter. Furthermore, the 
biomass of western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii), the target native grass for the 
study, did not increase 3 years after treatment. 
 

 
 
14 
 
Phosphorus 
It has been proposed that nonnative populations can be reduced through induced P 
limitation. The tendency for plant available P to bond with calcium to form recalcitrant 
compounds can be used to limit P availability in the soil (Fig. 1.2). Most of this research 
has been conducted on cheatgrass, though some work has been done on other nonnatives. 
In a laboratory germination and emergence experiment, reduction of P through the 
application of CaCl2 reduced cheatgrass emergence by approximately 20 – 50% 
depending on concentration and soil type (Belnap et al. 2003). Furthermore, additions of 
CaO or Fe2O3 significantly reduced cheatgrass emergence in soils from under native 
perennial grasses, but not in soils from invaded areas. None of the soil amendments 
caused significant reductions in germination rates of James’ galleta grass seeds. In 
Colorado ponderosa pine forests, P reduction treatments with gypsum reduced the 
relative growth rate of diffuse knapweed, but also increased the survival rate of 
individuals (Suding et al. 2004). In the same region, P reduction treatments had no 
significant influence on Canada thistle cover (Miller and Seastedt 2009). Field 
experiments in Utah with applications of CaO to reduce P availability had no significant 
effect on cheatgrass establishment, growth or biomass (Miller et al. 2006a), nor did it 
significantly reduce phosphate levels in the soil (Miller et al. 2006b). This is consistent 
with research in the Sierra Nevada, where P limitation through CaCO3 additions did not 
reduce cheatgrass cover (Keeley and McGinnis 2007). 
Conclusions 
 
The availability of soil N and P can play an important role in invasion dynamics, 
particularly in environments with low nutrient availability such as arid and semi-arid 

 
 
15 
 
ecosystems of the western US. Many invaders are ruderal species that require the 
immediate availability of essential nutrients. They must also be able to out-compete 
neighboring species for these nutrients. The competitive ability of nonnative species can 
vary depending upon the identity and life stage of the native competitor. Once a species 
successfully invades an area, the invader can have a strong influence on soil N and P 
dynamics. These influences have the potential to perpetuate the persistence of the 
invasion. Researchers and land managers have attempted to use the strong 
interrelationship between invaders and available N and P to mitigate invasions. This has 
met with some experimental success, but practical applicability has been limited. 
 
There are many unanswered questions regarding nutrient dynamics and invasion 
ecology. Our understanding of nonnative plant – soil N and P interactions is based 
primarily on research with annual grasses. While this is understandable due to the 
ubiquity of these species and the severity of their invasions, there are also perennial 
grasses and perennial and annual forbs that pose important threats of invasion as well. 
These functional groups tend to be less studied. A broader understanding of the role of 
soil N and P in facilitating the establishment and spread of nonnative species will 
enhance our ability to predict and, hopefully, mitigate new invasions. Furthermore, while 
our understanding of post-invasion changes in soil N and P cycling has increased in 
recent years, there are still many unexplained inconsistencies in experimental results. For 
example, why do some invasions increase N and P availability while others have a 
negative or neutral influence? Is this a species- or site-specific response? How do post-
invasion changes in soil nutrient cycles influence persistence of invasion and native 
species recovery? Lastly, can we successfully manipulate soil N and P in order to reduce 

 
 
16 
 
invasions? While some studies have shown promise, particularly with N reduction 
techniques, the results have been inconsistent and are often impractical for widespread 
application.

Invasion resistance and persistence: established plants win, even with disturbance 
and high propagule pressure 
 
Abstract  Disturbances and propagule pressure are key mechanisms in plant community 
resistance to invasion, as well as persistence of invasions. Few studies, however, have 
experimentally tested the interaction of these two mechanisms. We initiated a study in a 
southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.)/bunch grass system to determine 
the susceptibility of remnant native plant communities to cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum 
L.) invasion, and persistence of cheatgrass in invaded areas. We used a 2 x 2 factorial 
design consisting of two levels of aboveground biomass removal and two levels of 
reciprocal seeding. We seeded cheatgrass seeds in native plots and a native seed mixture 
in cheatgrass plots. Two biomass removal disturbances and sowing seeds over three years 
did not reverse cheatgrass dominance in invaded plots or native grass dominance in non-
invaded native plots. Our results suggest that two factors dictated the persistence of the 
resident communities. First, differences in pretreatment levels of plant-available soil 
nitrogen and phosphorus favored the dominant species in each community. Second, 
bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus elymoides (Raf.) Swezey) was the dominant native 
herbaceous species on the study site. This species is typically a poor competitor with 
cheatgrass as a seedling, but is a strong competitor when mature. Our study shows that 
soil properties and established plants can buffer the influences of disturbance and 
elevated propagule pressure on cheatgrass invasion.

Introduction 
 
Plant invasions can be triggered by the interaction of different mechanisms 
including disturbance, increased propagule pressure, climate, resource availability, and 
plant functional traits (Elton 1958; Hobbs and Huenneke 1992; Lonsdale 1999; Mack et 
al. 2000). While disturbances and/or propagule pressure are often considered principal 
drivers of invasion (Von Holle and Simberloff 2005; Lambrinos 2006; Eschtruth and 
Battles 2009), some native plant communities remain resistant to nonnative plant 
encroachment. Ecologists have proposed that invasions are driven by fluctuations in 
resource availability that cause temporal and/or spatial variations in niche availability 
regardless of the resource-liberating mechanism (Stohlgren et al. 1999; Davis et al. 
2000). Thus, successful invasions require synchrony of resource availability and presence 
of a nonnative species capable of exploiting the resource (Tilman 2004). Furthermore, 
propagules of the nonnative species must be present in sufficient quantity to capture 
resources to the detriment of the native community.  
 
Empirical experimental studies of community invasibility in natural ecosystems are 
rare and results are often inconsistent. Beckstead and Augspurger (2004) demonstrated 
that competition with native perennial grasses and a lack of soil disturbance were 
important for resistance to cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) invasion in a Great Basin 
ecosystem, while high nitrogen availability was the main factor in sustaining cheatgrass 
dominance. Thomsen et al. (2006), however, found that reduced competition with 
established species had little influence on perennial grass invasion in a California coastal 
prairie. Instead, timing of precipitation and propagule pressure were most important in 
overcoming invasion resistance. Chambers et al. (2007) determined that the most 

 
 
30 
 
influential factors driving invasion in Great Basin sagebrush communities varied 
depending on elevation, but sites with the highest cover of perennial grasses had the 
greatest resistance to invasion, regardless of elevation. 
 
Cheatgrass is an annual grass from the Mediterranean Region that has invaded large 
expanses of the western United States and is considered a strong transformer species 
(sensu Richardson et al. 2000). Cheatgrass typically invades semi-arid grass- and 
shrublands where it often becomes the dominant species (Mack 1981; Knapp 1996). 
Cheatgrass out-competes many native perennial grass seedlings, but performs worse 
when competing with mature native plants (Booth et al. 2003a; Lowe et al. 2003; 
Humphrey and Schupp 2004). Furthermore, cheatgrass success is promoted by high soil 
nutrient levels, particularly nitrate, which often increases in the soil immediately after fire 
(Link et al. 1995; Lowe et al. 2003; Beckstead and Augspurger 2004; Gundale et al. 
2008). 
 
Cheatgrass is considered to be poorly adapted to coniferous forests. Its growth and 
fecundity are limited by shade, low air and soil temperatures causing reduced cheatgrass 
emergence and survivorship, and disturbance to the extant understory is often necessary 
for cheatgrass establishment (Pierson and Mack 1990a,b; Pierson et al. 1990). Recently, 
however, cheatgrass has become increasingly prevalent in ponderosa pine (Pinus 
ponderosa Laws.) forests of the American West (Crawford et al. 2001; Laughlin and Fulé 
2008; Keeley and McGinnis 2007; McGlone et al. 2009b). This prevalence is associated 
with recent increases in fire and anthropogenic disturbance in ponderosa pine forests 
(Gildar et al. 2004; Keeley 2006; Fowler et al. 2008). In 2002-03, a ponderosa pine forest 
ecological restoration project in the Uinkaret Mountains of northern Arizona became 

 
 
31 
 
heavily invaded by cheatgrass immediately following a severe drought and wet autumn 
and winter (McGlone et al. 2009a). Cheatgrass populations expanded from being a minor 
component of the vegetation to becoming the dominant understory species over much of 
the landscape. The invasion was, however, heterogeneously distributed with many 
remnant areas of intact native vegetation containing little or no cheatgrass. 
 
In 2004 we initiated an experiment in the Uinkaret Mountains to determine the 
susceptibility of native-dominated communities to nonnative plant invasion, the 
persistence of recently established dominant nonnative populations, and the role of 
disturbance and elevated propagule pressure in shifting community dominance. We 
promoted a cheatgrass invasion by disturbing the native vegetation through aboveground 
biomass removal, increasing cheatgrass seed availability, and a combination of these 
treatments. Aboveground biomass removal has promoted cheatgrass spread in the Great 
Basin (Beckstead and Augspurger 2004; Chambers et al. 2007), although cheatgrass 
invasion can occur even without disturbance when sufficient seeds are available and 
climatic conditions are conducive to cheatgrass growth (Belnap and Phillips 2001; Evans 
et al. 2001). Additionally, we attempted to reduce cheatgrass dominance through similar 
manipulations of cheatgrass-dominated areas: aboveground biomass removal of 
cheatgrass and increased availability of native species seeds. Lastly, we compared 
edaphic properties between adjacent native- and cheatgrass-dominated areas to evaluate 
whether soil nutrient content and structure varied between community types. We 
hypothesized that 1) disturbance to the native-dominated community would reduce the 
community’s resistance to invasion, particularly in presence of enhanced cheatgrass 
propagule pressure, and 2) disturbance to the cheatgrass-dominated community would 

 
 
32 
 
reduce the community’s resistance to encroachment by native species, with enhanced 
native propagule pressure increasing native species and cover. 
Methods 
 
Study Site 
 
Mt. Trumbull is in the Uinkaret Mountains in northwestern Arizona (36° 22’ N, 
113° 8’ W). The elevation ranges from 2,000 to 2,250 m. Soils are predominantly 
Inceptisols derived from basalt and occasionally volcanic cinders (Jorgensen 2004). 
Annual precipitation averages 412 mm, but varied from 276 to 831 mm during the four 
study years (Fig. 1). Frontal storms generate snow and rain in winter, accounting for 
approximately 50% of annual average precipitation, and monsoonal thunderstorms from 
July through August account for 21%. Winter precipitation for 2004-07 was below 
average, while monsoonal rain was average or above average during the study. 
 
The study site is part of a landscape-scale ecological restoration research project. 
The overstory was thinned to emulate pre-1870 forest structure. Trees extant before 1870 
were retained including replacement trees for remnant evidence of trees (i.e. - stumps) 
that died in the interim. Merchantable timber was removed from site, remaining slash was 
lopped and scattered, and treated areas were broadcast burned. Thinning was conducted 
from 1996 to 1999 and the slash and understory were burned from 1996 to 2001 (Figure 
2). After treatment, tree density averaged 399 trees ha-1 and mean basal area averaged 
18.9 m2 ha-1 (see Roccaforte et al. 2009 for further details). 
 
Overstory vegetation was dominated by ponderosa pine and Gambel oak (Quercus 
gambelii Nutt.). Additional tree species include New Mexico locust (Robinia 
neomexicana Gray), pinyon pine (Pinus edulis Engelm.), Utah juniper (Juniperus 

 
 
33 
 
osteosperma (Torr.) Little), and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.). Dominant 
shrubs include big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.), wax currant (Ribes cereum 
Dougl.), and Utah serviceberry (Amelanchier utahensis Koehne). Principal perennial 
grasses are muttongrass (Poa fendleriana (Steud.) Vasey), bottlebrush squirreltail 
(Elymus elymoides (Raf.) Swezey), and western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii (Rydb.) 
A. Löve). There is a diverse community of annual and perennial forbs. There were no 
annual grasses detected except for nonnative annual bromes, predominantly cheatgrass. 
Experimental Design 
 
We established 10 blocks of 8 plots; each block contained one replicate of each 
treatment in each community type. Treatments were randomly assigned to plots. Each 
replicate treatment plot was 2 x 2 m with a 1-m buffer. Within each plot, ten randomly 
located, 20- x 50-cm subplots were sampled for a total sampled area of 1 m2 per plot. 
Plots were excluded from cattle grazing by a 4- x 4-m exclosure of three-strand barbed 
wire. 
 
The blocks were established across a 2.5-km wide cheatgrass-invaded area. Within 
each block the elevation, aspect, slope, soil type, and time since restoration treatment 
(thinning and prescribed burning) were the same. Time-since-treatment ranged from 4 – 8 
years. The eight plots were located within a 100-m radius of the center of each block. The 
criteria for native plot selection were: location within 20 m of a cheatgrass-dominated 
area, and having a native perennial grass cover of >35% and cheatgrass cover of ≤1% of 
the total plant cover within the plot. Cheatgrass plots were within 20 m of a native plot 
and had to have more cheatgrass cover than the cover of all native species combined. 
Additionally, plots in both native- and cheatgrass-dominated areas had to show evidence 

 
 
34 
 
of having been prescribed burned (i.e. - charred wood). We randomly assigned treatments 
within each block of each community type. 
 
We used a 2 x 2 factorial experimental design with two levels of aboveground 
biomass removal and two levels of seeding. The biomass removal (clipped) treatment 
removed all aboveground live biomass from the plots at the onset of the experiment. The 
seeding treatment consisted of adding bottlebrush squirreltail, western wheatgrass, and 
silver lupine (Lupinus argenteus Pursh) seeds to cheatgrass-dominated plots and 
cheatgrass seed to native-dominated plots. The 2 x 2 factorial design generated four 
treatment combinations in each community type: 1) untreated control, 2) clipped, 3) 
seeded, and 4) clipped and seeded. 
Experimental Treatments 
 
We removed all aboveground vegetation from clipped plots twice: in late summer 
2004 after August vegetation measurements and in late spring 2005, before May 
vegetation measurements. Clippings were timed to coincide with maximum aboveground 
biomass of native perennials (late summer 2004) and cheatgrass (May 2005). 
Additionally, most cheatgrass plants were flowering during the May 2005 clipping 
treatment. In the second clipping, no species that we experimentally seeded were 
removed from clipped and seeded plots in either community, regardless of whether the 
plants were seedlings or resprouted from root stock. All vegetation was clipped at ground 
level and removed from the site. 
 
We seeded three times: fall 2004, spring 2005 and fall 2006. For native plots, we 
seeded 5g of cheatgrass seed per plot each time, a rate consistent with BLM seeding 
practices of native species for the Mt Trumbull Ecological Restoration project (Moore et 

 
 
35 
 
al. 2003). This equates to approximately 200 seeds m-2 per seeding for a total of 
approximately 600 seeds m-2 for the entire study. We collected seeds for the 2004 and 
2005 seedings at Mt. Trumbull in July 2004. Seeds for the 2006 seeding were collected at 
Mt. Trumbull in July 2006. Cheatgrass seed germination averaged 92% in lab 
germination trials at 25°C. For cheatgrass plots we seeded 5g of native seed with equal 
amounts by weight of bottlebrush squirreltail, western wheatgrass, and silver lupine. This 
equated to an average of 65 bottlebrush squirreltail, 40 western wheatgrass, and 40 silver 
lupine seeds m-2 per seeding, for a total of ~435 seeds m-2 for the entire study. 
Germination for bottlebrush squirreltail, western wheatgrass, and silver lupine was 60%, 
38%, and 24%, respectively, in laboratory tests. Silver lupine seeds were scarified prior 
to seeding by abrading the seed coat for five seconds with sandpaper (Baskin and Baskin 
2001).  
Vegetation Measurements 
 
Each sampling period we measured plant canopy cover by species, cheatgrass 
density, species richness, and cheatgrass frequency. We visually estimated cover of all 
shrubs and herbaceous plants in each 20- x 50-cm subplot. Percent cover was measured 
using a 10- x 10-cm template to estimate 1% of a square meter, and was summed across 
the 10 subplots. Total plant cover was calculated by summing total cover over all species. 
Additionally, we counted the number of individual cheatgrass plants in each subplot and 
summed across the 10 subplots for a plot-level total. Species richness was based on plot-
level presence/absence. Cheatgrass frequency was calculated on a scale of 0-10, equal to 
the number of subplots per plot containing at least one cheatgrass plant. Plant species 
were identified to species unless reliable field identification was not possible; in such 

 
 
36 
 
cases, plants were identified to genus. Plant nomenclature and nativity follows USDA-
NRCS (2009). 
 
We measured vegetation twice each year: in late May when cheatgrass was at 
maximum aboveground biomass and flowering, and in late August when many native 
plants were at maximum aboveground biomass. Pretreatment measurements were made 
in 2004. Post-treatment measurements were made in 2005, 2006 and 2007. Individual 
cheatgrass plants were counted in all subplots in all years except 2006. 
 
In spring and summer 2007 we measured cover and then harvested all above-
ground biomass from the subplots. We clipped biomass from half of the subplots in May 
2007 and the other half in August 2007. The subplots clipped in May were excluded from 
the August 2007 measurements. Biomass was sorted by species, oven-dried at 70°C for 2 
days, and weighed. 
Soil Samples 
 
We collected soil samples in late August 2004 at the onset of the study and 
coincident with maximum aboveground biomass of native perennials and initiation of 
cheatgrass germination. We collected two soil samples from each plot. One sample was 
tested for pH immediately after collection using a Denver Instrument UB-5 pH meter. 
The second sample was returned to the laboratory for other analyses. For each sample, 
soils were collected at four fixed locations within the 1-m buffer zone between the plots 
and exclosure fences to a depth of 10 cm using a 4-cm diameter soil corer. The four core 
samples were composited for analysis, sieved through a 2-mm sieve, and all coarse 
organic material was removed. From each sample of the second soil collection, a 10-g 
subsample was placed in 100 ml of KCl solution and stored on ice for analysis of nutrient 

 
 
37 
 
concentration. Samples were analyzed for nutrient concentration at the Colorado Plateau 
Analytical Laboratory at NAU following Sparks (1996). 
Statistical Analyses 
 
Changes in plant community variables were tested using repeated measures 
MANOVA. We visually assessed multivariate normality (Q-Q plots of the residuals) and 
tested for univariate normality (Shapiro-Wilk test) and homogeneous variances (Levene’s 
test). Total richness data and all cover data except cheatgrass cover consistently met the 
assumptions. For analyses with significant year x treatment interactions, we tested for 
year and treatment differences using Tukey’s HSD test. Cheatgrass cover, frequency, and 
density data were non-normal and transformations did not address non-normality. For 
these variables we used Kruskal-Wallis signed ranks tests. For analyses with significant 
year x treatment interactions, we tested for year and treatment differences using a two-
sample Wilcoxon signed ranks test with a Bonferroni correction. The August sampling 
period occurred during the cheatgrass germination period and thus incompletely 
measured cheatgrass presence and cover. Therefore, we only analyzed cheatgrass data 
from May. Because the 2005 data collection immediately followed the clipping 
treatment, we excluded those data from all analyses, although we present them 
graphically for descriptive purposes. 
 
For August 2007, only the five subplots not clipped in May 2007 were measured. 
Richness data for this sampling period was therefore on a 0.5 m2 scale. To determine the 
amount this underestimated richness calculated at the 1 m2 scale used in all other 
measurements, we used August 2004-2006 data to generate species accumulation curves 

 
 
38 
 
using EstimateS software (Colwell 2006); this revealed that 75-86% of all species were 
captured by five subplots. 
 
We compared soil nutrient concentrations between community types using 
ANOVA. Most soil data required either log or cube-root transformation to meet ANOVA 
assumptions. Due to the number of soil analyses conducted, we used a Bonferroni 
correction to control for possible Type I errors. All analyses except for the species 
accumulation curves were conducted using JMP 8.0 software (SAS Institute 2008). 
Results 
The influence of disturbance and cheatgrass propagule pressure in native-dominated 
community resistance to invasion 
 
The native-dominated community was highly resistant to invasion regardless of 
treatment. Cheatgrass cover responded positively to the seeding and clipping treatment, 
although cheatgrass cover remained low (< 4%) throughout the experiment (Fig. 3A). 
Cheatgrass cover increased significantly from pretreatment levels in 2004 only in the 
clipped and seeded plots in 2006. The application of additional seed significantly 
increased the frequency of cheatgrass in 2006, but this increase was no longer detectable 
by 2007 (Figure 3B). Cheatgrass frequency significantly decreased after 2004 in the 
clipped treatment and was present on only three of the 10 plots by 2007. Cheatgrass 
density did not change significantly throughout the study (data not shown). In general, 
nonnative species were uncommon in the native-dominated community. Besides 
cheatgrass, the only other nonnative species were prickly lettuce (Lactuca serriola L.), 
Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), tumblemustard (Sisymbrium altissimum L.), and 

 
 
39 
 
yellow salsify (Tragopogon dubius Scop.). Of nonnative species other than cheatgrass, 
Kentucky bluegrass had the highest cover (1.1%) on any one plot. 
 
We detected no treatment effect for total cover in either the May or August 
measurements for the native-dominated community (Fig. 4A & B). In both sampling 
periods, there was a significant year effect, with total cover increasing from 2004 to 
2006. In May, cover returned to pretreatment levels by 2007, while in August cover 
continued to increase. Total cover consisted of almost entirely native species with 
bottlebrush squirreltail accounting for 40-100% of total cover in both May and August 
(Fig. 4C & D). In both May and August there was a significant treatment effect for 
bottlebrush squirreltail cover, with the clipped and seeded treatment resulting in reduced 
cover. There was also a significant year effect for bottlebrush squirreltail cover in both 
May and August, with greater cover after treatment than pretreatment. There was no 
detectable treatment effect on final biomass in either sampling period in 2007. 
 
Over the course of the study we detected 68 species in the native-dominated 
community, with 53 of them observed in May and 51 observed in August. May species 
richness decreased by nearly half over the course of the study, regardless of treatment 
(Fig. 4E). By May 2007, plots averaged only 4 species m-2. Nonnative species, typically 
cheatgrass, accounted for an average of <1 species m-2. There was a significant time x 
treatment interaction for August species richness (Fig. 4F). The clipped plots had a 
significant reduction in species richness between 2004 and 2007, while the seeded plots 
had a significant increase between the same years. The consistent annual reduction in 
species richness observed in May did not occur in August. As in May, an average of <1 
nonnative species m-2 occurred; cheatgrass was most common; others were purslane

The greatest cover of nonnative species excluding cheatgrass on any one plot was 1.8% 
for common mullein. 
The influence of disturbance and native propagule pressure on the persistence of 
cheatgrass 
 
By the end of our study, cheatgrass continued to dominate the invaded community 
regardless of treatment for measurements in May. We detected a significant year by 
treatment interaction for cheatgrass cover in May. The interaction was the result of the 
clipped treatments and clipped and seeded treatments in 2006 having significantly lower 
cover than the control and seeded treatments (Fig. 5A). By 2007, cheatgrass cover 
remained lower in the two treatments that included clipping, but variability was high and 
differences were not significant. Cheatgrass density was not significantly affected by 
treatments, but more than doubled from 2004 to 2007 (Fig. 5B). Since cheatgrass cover 
was roughly the same in 2004 and 2007, the cheatgrass population in 2007 consisted of 
more numerous, but smaller plants. 
 
In May, the treatment by year interaction was significant for total cover (Fig. 6A). 
The control and seeded treatments showed a significant increase from 2004 to 2006, with 
no significant difference between 2004 and 2007. There was no significant treatment 
response in May of any year in the clipped or clipped and seeded treatments. The trends 
in total cover were similar to cheatgrass cover, since cheatgrass accounted for 
approximately 75% of all cover throughout the study (Figs. 5A & 6A). There was no 
significant treatment effect for total cover in August, but there was a significant year 
effect, with total cover increasing throughout the study (Fig. 6B). Seeded species cover 

 
 
41 
 
did not differ by treatment in May and remained below 8% for all treatments and years 
(Fig. 6C). In May of both 2004 and 2007, seeded species cover accounted for 
approximately 7% of total species cover. In August, however, there was a significant 
annual increase in seeded species cover regardless of treatment, suggesting that the 
increased cover was driven by natural recruitment, not our experimental seeding (Fig. 
6D). There was no detectable treatment effect for either May or August biomass in 2007 
(data not shown). 
 
We observed a total of 75 species on the cheatgrass plots over the course of the 
study, seven more than on the native plots. In May, we observed 60 species on the 
cheatgrass plots including 10 nonnative species and in August we observed a total of 62 
species, again with 10 nonnative species. Cheatgrass was the dominant nonnative species 
on all cheatgrass-invaded plots, regardless of sampling season. In May, maximum cover 
for the other nonnative species ranged from 0.25% for black bindweed (Polygonum 
convolvulus) to 8% for tumblemustard. In August, nonnative species were typically rare 
with low cover on the cheatgrass-dominated plots, although common mullein cover on 
one plot was 15.75%. Treatment and year significantly affected total richness in May, 
with richness in clipped, and clipped and seeded plots having nearly double the number 
of species as in the seeded and control in 2006 and 2007 (Fig. 6E). In August, species 
richness was not significantly affected by treatment, but varied significantly over time 
with all treatments increasing by 1 – 2 species m-2 from 2004 to 2007 (Fig. 6F). 
Soil properties 
 
We detected three significant differences in concentrations of soil nutrients between 
native- and cheatgrass-dominated communities at the onset of the study in 2004 (Table 

 
 
42 
 
1). Concentrations differed for phosphate (PO4), total nitrogen (N) and nitrate (NO3). Of 
these nutrients, NO3 differed the most, with concentrations in cheatgrass-dominated soils 
two times higher than in native-dominated soils. Soil texture was similar in the two 
communities and averaged approximately 66%, 11%, and 23% for sand, silt, and clay, 
respectively. 
Discussion 
 
Both native- and cheatgrass-dominated communities on Mt. Trumbull were 
resistant to shifts in species dominance despite two aboveground biomass removal 
disturbances and elevated seed availability over the first three years of the study. Native-
dominated communities were not only resistant to cheatgrass encroachment; cheatgrass 
was nearly extirpated from the plots by 2007 regardless of treatment. In May 2007, 
cheatgrass-dominated areas returned to pretreatment levels for most parameters of 
community composition. Thus, clipping had only short-term effects on cheatgrass-
dominated communities in May when cheatgrass was at maximum aboveground biomass. 
The only change in community dominance we detected was in the cheatgrass-dominated 
community in August when cheatgrass was germinating and contributed little plant cover. 
By August 2007, bottlebrush squirreltail cover was approximately equal to cheatgrass 
cover. The resistance of the two communities to sustained changes in composition may 
be due, in part, to community differences in soil nutrient concentrations. Total N, NO3, 
and PO4 were higher in the cheatgrass-dominated areas than in native-dominated areas. 
Our study cannot, however, quantify the contribution of soil nutrients versus resident 
native species in limiting cheatgrass invasion. 
 

 
 
43 
 
Invasion resistance in the native-dominated community 
 
The clipping and seeding treatments in this study were unsuccessful in inducing 
cheatgrass establishment in the native-dominated community. Cheatgrass seeding 
treatments resulted in an initial increase in cheatgrass cover and frequency, but following 
this initial pulse cheatgrass was actually less prevalent in 2007 than before treatment in 
2004. The initial increase in cheatgrass lends some support for hypothesis #1 - 
disturbance to the native-dominated community would reduce community resistance to 
invasion, particularly in presence of elevated cheatgrass propagule pressure. The 
predicted increase in cheatgrass was, however, only transient.  
 
While we did not expect our treatments to create a complete shift in dominance 
from native species to cheatgrass, the failure of increased disturbance and propagule 
pressure to increase cheatgrass establishment was unexpected. Disturbance and propagule 
pressure are considered main drivers of invasion (Elton 1958; Hobbs and Huenneke 
1992; Williamson 1996). Recent field research has supported this theory, with propagule 
pressure often being more important than disturbance in promoting invasion (Von Holle 
and Simberloff 2005; Lambrinos 2006; Eschtruth and Battles 2009). Furthermore, since 
native plots were in close proximity to cheatgrass-dominated plots (20 m), and 
differences in disturbance history, weather influences, soils, and geography were 
minimal, it is unlikely that our results were confounded by extraneous differences 
between communities. 
 
Several factors may explain our inability to experimentally induce cheatgrass 
establishment in the native-dominated community. One factor that may have regulated 
cheatgrass success during the study is precipitation. Cheatgrass seedlings are highly 

 
 
44 
 
susceptible to mortality through desiccation (Pierson and Mack 1990a). The last two 
winters of our study had below-average precipitation that may have limited cheatgrass 
performance. Furthermore, the native community on Mt. Trumbull was dominated by 
bottlebrush squirreltail, a species that is considered a strong competitor with cheatgrass. 
Bottlebrush squirreltail and its congeneric relative, big squirreltail (Elymus multisetus 
M.E. Jones), can limit cheatgrass establishment and spread (Booth et al. 2003a; 
Humphrey and Schupp 2004; Leger 2008). In a Great Basin shrub-steppe study, areas 
with >15% bottlebrush squirreltail cover almost completely excluded cheatgrass (Booth 
et al. 2003a). Like cheatgrass, bottlebrush squirreltail is physiologically active very early 
in the growing season, which may explain its ability to compete with cheatgrass (Jones 
1998). The effectiveness of bottlebrush squirreltail as a competitor, however, seems to be 
dependent on plant life stage, with mature plants being strong competitors but seedlings 
unable to compete with cheatgrass (Humphrey and Schupp 2004).  
 
Lastly, lower levels of plant-available N and P in soils of the native community may 
have favored native perennials over cheatgrass. As an annual species, cheatgrass 
generally has greater dependence on plant-available soil nutrients for successful 
establishment and persistence than perennial species (Marschner 1995). Past research has 
shown both soil nutrient concentration and native species competition to be important in 
regulating invasions (Link et al. 1995; Booth et al. 2003a; Chambers et al. 2007); 
possibly their combined influences provided both community resiliency and resistance to 
cheatgrass invasion in our study.

Persistence of cheatgrass in the invaded community 
 
Cheatgrass cover in May was reduced by clipping in 2006, but the effect was 
transient and diminished in 2007. Furthermore, seeding with native species had no 
significant effect on any community characteristic of the cheatgrass-dominated 
community. This result gives limited support to hypothesis #2 - disturbance to the 
cheatgrass-dominated community would reduce the community’s resistance to 
encroachment by native species, with enhanced native propagule pressure increasing 
native species cover. Specifically, our results partially support the hypothesis that the 
cheatgrass population would be reduced by disturbance, though only in the first two 
growing seasons after treatment. The results do not, however, support the hypothesis that 
seeding treatments would promote native species cover. 
 
Cheatgrass has been highly persistent in many ecosystems after invasion (Mack 
1981; Brandt and Rickard 1994; Knapp 1996). Numerous studies have examined the 
possibility of reducing dominance of cheatgrass, and other nonnative annual brome 
grasses, by mowing, seeding, soil nutrient reduction through carbon and other chemical 
amendments, and herbicide application (Hull Jr. and Stewart 1948; Belnap et al. 2003; 
Scoles et al. 2003; Davison and Smith 2007; Belnap and Sherrod 2009). While many 
techniques have temporarily reduced cheatgrass populations, most research suggests that 
long-term suppression of cheatgrass requires actively reducing cheatgrass and promoting 
perennial grasses, usually through seeding (Hull Jr. and Stewart 1948; Cox and Anderson 
2004; Davison and Smith 2007). This approach was ineffective during three years of 
seeding and four years of measurements in our study. The failure of the seeded species, 
bottlebrush squirreltail, silver lupine, and western wheatgrass, to establish may be due to 

 
 
46 
 
inability as seedlings to compete with cheatgrass (Hull Jr. 1963; Lowe et al. 2003; 
Humphrey and Schupp 2004). The continued increase in seeded species cover in August 
measurements, however, suggests that the community dynamics may not be resolved. 
Interestingly, the increase in seeded species cover in August was independent of 
treatment, suggesting that natural re-establishment of the species contributed to their 
increased cover. While increases in seeded species cover were not detected in May by the 
end of the study, it is possible that continued increases in late-season native cover may 
reach a level that inhibits success of future cheatgrass generations. 
 
One factor that may have contributed to the persistence of cheatgrass was the higher 
plant-available soil N and P concentrations in the cheatgrass plots compared to native 
plots prior to treatment. These nutrients are important in regulating cheatgrass 
competitive ability with native species (Dakheel et al. 1993; Booth et al. 2003b; Miller et 
al. 2006a; Belnap and Sherrod 2009). Elevated soil N is often associated with cheatgrass-
dominated communities when compared to native communities (Bolton Jr. et al. 1993; 
Booth et al. 2003b; Belnap et al. 2005; Sperry et al. 2006). Most studies examining 
cheatgrass – soil N relationships have been conducted in the Great Basin Desert; little is 
known about these relationships in mountain forests. In addition to N, plant-available P 
often limits plant productivity (Elser et al 2007). Field research has shown a positive 
relationship between plant-available P and cheatgrass performance (Bashkin et al. 2003; 
Belnap et al. 2003; Miller et al. 2006a,b). Miller et al. (2006a) suggested that plant-
available P was the primary limitation to cheatgrass performance in a southern Utah 
study. Additionally, cheatgrass may increase labile P in invaded soils through rhizosphere 

 
 
47 
 
acidification (Miller et al. 2006a,b). As with N, however, little is known about the role of 
P in regulating cheatgrass invasion in mountain forests. 
 
This study cannot confirm a causal relationship between soil nutrients and species 
distribution and further research is necessary to determine whether the differences we 
observed in soil N and P regulated the heterogeneous distribution of cheatgrass on Mt. 
Trumbull. Nonetheless, our finding of an association between cheatgrass and high levels 
of plant-available soil N and P is consistent with other studies and supports the theory 
that cheatgrass success is greatest in patches with high plant-available soil N and P. 
Conclusions 
 
None of our hypotheses was fully supported by our data. First, we proposed that 
disturbance via complete clipping of aboveground biomass would increase cheatgrass 
cover and abundance on native-dominated plots, particularly in plots with an enhanced 
cheatgrass seed bank. Instead, we found the native community on Mt. Trumbull was 
resistant to further invasion regardless of treatment. This result suggests that factors 
governing invasion of native communities are complex and elevated disturbance and seed 
availability may not always result in invasion. Second, we proposed that disturbance to 
cheatgrass-dominated plots would reduce cheatgrass populations, with native seed 
amendments promoting native species cover. Cheatgrass populations were only slightly 
reduced by disturbance and native species failed to establish, even after nearly 500 seeds 
m-2 were sown over three years. The herbaceous understory at the study site was 
dominated by two grass species at the end of the study: bottlebrush squirreltail on native 
plots and cheatgrass on cheatgrass plots. This pattern may be the result of species-specific 
responses to spatial variation in plant-available soil N and P at the study site. We 

 
 
48 
 
conclude that shifts in dominant herbaceous communities at Mt. Trumbull could not be 
induced by disturbance and elevated seed availability. Instead, communities that were 
dominated by a single, highly competitive species, regardless of the nativity of that 
species, were resistant to changes in community dominance.

Changes in plant community composition in invaded and non-invaded plots at the 
onset of cheatgrass invasion 
 
Abstract 
 
Nonnative plant invasions have dramatically altered many ecosystems world-
wide. Invasions can alter ecosystem structure, functions, and processes and these 
alterations can last for decades. While long-term invasions can result in a very different 
plant community than comparable non-invaded communities, little is known about 
changes in plant community composition shortly after invasion. In this study we 
examined changes in plant species composition in a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) 
forest in northern Arizona that was invaded by cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) in 2003. 
We tested for temporal changes (2004-7) between paired invaded and non-invaded plots 
in species diversity, similarity, and richness. Furthermore, we used NMS ordinations to 
determine if adjoining invaded and non-invaded plots differed in plant species 
composition. The two plant community types differed in species composition at the onset 
of the study and continued to diverge in subsequent years. By 2007, the percentage of 
plant species occurring in both invaded and non-invaded plots declined by one-third 
compared to 2004. Species richness did not differ between community types in any year, 
but by the end of the study percent native species richness was lower in invaded plots in 
both spring and summer seasons. We conclude that cheatgrass invasion drove strong 
divergence in species composition five years after invasion.

Introduction 
 
Invasive, nonnative plant species can cause profound and potentially irreversible 
changes to ecosystems. Invasion can alter the natural environment at population, 
community, and ecosystem levels (Parker et al. 1999; Mack et al. 2000; Levine et al. 
2003). Richardson et al. (2000) referred to these high-impact invasive species as 
“transformers” because they have lasting, multi-faceted impacts on the ecosystem. These 
ecosystem impacts can include changes in local biodiversity (Elton 1958; Williamson 
1996), disturbance regimes such as the fire cycle (D'Antonio and Vitousek 1992; Brooks 
et al. 2004), and ecosystem processes (Crooks 2002; Hooper et al. 2005). 
 
While invasion can reduce the abundance of native plant species, complete 
extirpation is less common, and native species often linger at low densities (Davis 2003; 
Gurevitch and Padilla 2004). This can lead to an actual increase in plant species richness 
following invasion at large spatial scales, with reductions in richness only occurring at 
localized scales (Parker et al. 1999). While transitions in dominant species in an invaded 
ecosystem are usually obvious and easy to measure, the loss or reduction in abundance of 
relatively rare species may have important consequences on an ecosystem if the species 
strongly influences ecosystem processes (Hooper et al. 2005). 
 
Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) is an excellent example of a transformer species 
(Richardson et al. 2000). Cheatgrass is an annual grass from Eurasia that has invaded ~20 
million ha of the Great Basin Desert in the western United States (Bradley and Mustard 
2005) and occurs in all 48 contiguous United States (USDA, NRCS 2010). In areas where 
it has become the dominant species, cheatgrass has altered fire cycles (Whisenant 1990; 
Brooks et al. 2004), nutrient cycling (Evans et al. 2001; Belnap et al. 2005; Sperry et al. 

 
 
66 
 
2006), soil biota (Belnap and Phillips 2001), and the structure and composition of the 
vegetative community (Young and Evans 1978; Mack 1981; Knapp 1996). Cheatgrass is 
highly persistent after invasion, often dominating the plant community for decades (Mack 
1981; Knapp 1996). Long-term cheatgrass dominance can substantially alter plant 
community composition (Knapp 1992; Brandt and Rickard 1994). While long-term 
consequences of invasion are important, plant community changes caused by invasive 
species at the onset of invasion initiate potential long-term changes (Grime 2001). Little 
is known about plant community compositional changes that occur at the onset of 
cheatgrass invasion. 
 
We measured changes in plant species composition in paired invaded and non-
invaded plots in a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest in the Uinkaret Mountains of 
northern Arizona that was recently invaded by cheatgrass. From 2002-2003, cheatgrass 
increased from a minor component of the understory vegetation to the dominant species 
in thinned and burned areas (see McGlone et al. 2009 for details). In 2004, we established 
a study to investigate changes in understory composition in native- and cheatgrass-
dominated plots. We used a series of paired plots to examine differences in post-invasion 
plant species composition in neighboring invaded and non-invaded plots, and to quantify 
species changes over four consecutive years. 
Methods 
 
Our study site is in the Uinkaret Mountains in northwestern Arizona at elevations 
ranging from 2,000 to 2,250 m. Soils are predominantly Inceptisols derived from basalt 
parent material (Jorgensen 2004). Annual precipitation averages 412 mm, but varied from 
276 to 831 mm during the four study years (Fig. 3.1). Frontal storms generate snow and 

 
 
67 
 
rain in winter, accounting for approximately 50% of annual average precipitation, and 
monsoonal thunderstorms from July through August account for 21%. Winter 
precipitation for 2005-2007 was below average, while monsoonal rain was average or 
above average for the duration of the study. 
 
The study site is part of a landscape-scale ecological restoration research project. 
The overstory was thinned to approximate pre-1870 forest structure. All trees extant 
before 1870 were retained including replacement trees for all remnant evidence of trees 
(such as stumps) that died in the interim. Merchantable timber was removed from site, 
remaining slash was lopped and scattered, and treated areas were broadcast burned and 
seeded with a mix of native seeds. For further details on the restoration prescription, see 
Roccaforte et al. (2009). Thinning was conducted at the study site from 1996 to 1999 and 
the slash and understory was burned from 1996 to 2001. After burning, the treated areas 
were seeded at approximately 9 kg ha-1. The seed mix varied annually. After treatment, 
tree density averaged 399 trees ha-1 and mean basal area averaged 18.9 m2 ha-1 
(Roccaforte et al. 2009). 
 
The overstory vegetation in the area was dominated by ponderosa pine and 
Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii). Other tree species in the area included New Mexico 
locust (Robinia neomexicana), pinyon pine (Pinus edulis), Utah juniper (Juniperus 
osteospermus), and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides). Dominant shrubs included big 
sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), wax currant (Ribes cereum), and Utah serviceberry 
(Amelanchier utahensis). The dominant perennial grasses were muttongrass (Poa 
fendleriana), squirreltail (Elymus elymoides), and western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum 
smithii). Native annual grasses are limited to one rarely-occurring species: annual muhly 

 
 
68 
 
(Muhlenbergia minutissima). There is a diverse community of annual and perennial 
forbs. 
 
We established 10 pairs of plots with each pair containing one plot in each 
community type (cheatgrass-dominated, hereafter “invaded”, and native-dominated, 
“non-invaded”), with the non-invaded plots serving as controls. Each plot was 2 x 2 m 
with a 1-m buffer of similar habitat. Within each plot, ten 20- x 50-cm subplots were 
sampled for a total sampled area of 1 m2 per plot. The location of the subplots was 
randomly selected. The plots were fenced with 3-strand barbed wire to exclude cattle 
grazing. 
 
The plots were established across a 2.5-km band of the invaded landscape. Non-
invaded plots were selected if they contained a substantial native perennial grass 
component (>35% of the vegetative cover) and had little or no cheatgrass within the plot 
area (no more than 1% of the vegetative cover). Invaded plots were established 20 m 
away from the paired non-invaded plots and had to have more cheatgrass cover than the 
cover of all native species combined in the plot. Additionally, each plot had to show 
evidence of having been prescribed burned, such as charred wood. Each pair had the 
same time since burning and post-burning seed mix composition, as well as similar slope, 
aspect, soil texture, and overstory canopy cover. 
Vegetation Measurements 
 
Each sampling period we measured aerial plant cover by species and recorded 
species richness. We visually estimated cover of shrubs and herbaceous plants in each 20- 
x 50-cm subplot, with a maximum of 10% cover per subplot, then summed across the 10 
subplots. Cumulative total plant cover was calculated by summing the cover values of 

 
 
69 
 
individual species. Species richness was based on plot-level presence/absence. Plants 
were identified to species unless reliable field identification was not possible. In such 
cases, plants were identified to genus. Plant nomenclature and nativity were based on 
USDA, NRCS (2010). 
 
We sampled vegetation twice a year: in late May when cheatgrass was at peak 
growth and in late August to capture peak native plant growth in response to late summer 
rain. The late August measurement period also coincided with cheatgrass germination. 
We sampled in each of four consecutive years from 2004 to 2007. 
 
In 2007, we harvested aboveground biomass from the subplots. We clipped half 
the subplots in May 2007, immediately after measurement. The remaining subplots were 
harvested after the August 2007 measurements. The subplots harvested in May were not 
sampled in August. All biomass was oven-dried at 70°C for 48 hours and then weighed. 
Statistical Analyses 
 
We analyzed May and August data separately. Cover data were used for all 
analyses except richness. Because August 2007 data represented a partial data set, we 
excluded these data from species richness, diversity, and community composition 
analyses. In addition to total species richness, we calculated the percent native species 
richness per plot. We also calculated percent shared species (the Jaccard Similarity 
Coefficient (Cheetham and Hazel 1969) x 100) at the plot level (1 m2) and across plots 
within invaded or non-invaded plots (10 m2). Finally, we calculated the Shannon-Weiner 
index per plot. We used repeated measures MANOVA to analyze all plot-level variables, 
with year as the repeated factor. All significant year-by-invasion interactions were tested 
using a one-way ANOVA for within-year and between-invasion differences with a 

 
 
70 
 
Bonferroni adjustment based on number of years. Among-year differences were tested 
using Tukey’s HSD post hoc analysis. MANOVA and ANOVA analyses were conducted 
using JMP software (version 8.0, SAS Institute 2008). We analyzed community-level 
differences using NMS. Ordinations were conducted using Sorenson distance measure 
with random starting configurations, 50 runs with real data, 200 iterations, and a 
0.000010 stability criterion. The stress value of the final solution was compared to 
random solutions using a Monte Carlo test with 50 randomizations. All community 
analyses were conducted using PCOrd software (version 5.0, McCune and Mefford 
2006). 
Results 
 
Cover in May differed significantly among years (F = 11.84; P = 0.004) and 
between communities (F = 8.63; P = 0.02), with consistently greater cover in invaded 
plots than in non-invaded plots. Average cover was highest in 2006, the year with the 
driest preceding winter (non-invaded plots = 28.0%; SE = 3.8 and invaded plots = 45.1%; 
SE =3.8). The 2007 May biomass data were highly variable, ranging from 7.2 to 45.2 g 
dry weight m-2 in non-invaded plots and 6.0 to 107.6 g dry weight m-2 in the invaded 
plots. Although not significant (P = 0.184), mean biomass was higher in invaded plots 
(43.46 g m-2; SE = 6.5) than in non-invaded plots (25.4 g m-2; SE = 6.5). 
 
There was no significant difference in total species richness between invaded and 
non-invaded plots in May, though the average number of species declined significantly 
between 2004 and 2007 in both non-invaded and invaded plots (F = 20.19; P = 0.001). 
There was a significant community type-by-year interaction for percent native species 
richness (F = 5.521; P = 0.03), with native species accounting for significantly less of the 

 
 
71 
 
total richness in invaded plots in 2006 and 2007 (Fig. 3.2A). Percent shared species per 
plot (1 m2) had a significant year effect (F = 6.52; P = 0.001), with significantly fewer 
shared species in the final two years of the study (Fig. 3.3A). At the 10 m2 level, percent 
shared species declined from 59% in 2004 to 41% in 2007 (Fig. 3.3B). In May, non-
invaded plots had six species that never occurred in invaded plots, while there were 11 
species that were unique to invaded plots, including five nonnative species (Table 3.1). 
There was a significant year effect for the Shannon-Wiener index, with index values 
declining over time (F = 25.69; P < 0.001) (Fig. 3.4A). There was no significant 
community type effect for the Shannon-Wiener index. The NMS analysis of May data 
showed two distinct communities with community type accounting for 92% of the 
variability in the data (Fig. 3.5A). 
 
Cover in August had a significant year-by-community type interaction (F = 5.61; 
P = 0.03), with significantly higher cover in non-invaded plots in 2004 and 2006 and no 
difference in 2005 or 2007. Mean cover values increased in time from 12.8% (SE = 1.0) 
in 2004 to 29.9% (SE = 5.0) in non-invaded plots and from 6.0% (SE = 1.0) in 2004 to 
27.8% (SE = 5.0) in 2007 in invaded plots. Biomass in August ranged from 8.4 to 43.8 g 
dry weight m-2 (mean = 24.58 g dry weight m-2; SE = 2.86) in non-invaded plots and 4.6 
to 52.8 g dry weight m-2 (mean = 16.52 g dry weight m-2; SE = 2.86) in invaded plots. As 
in May, there was no significant difference in biomass between invaded and non-invaded 
plots in August (P = 0.176). 
 
There was also no significant difference in total species richness between invaded 
and non-invaded community types in August, but the year main effect was significant (F 
= 73.42; P < 0.001). Species richness increased from 2004 to 2005, but returned to near 

 
 
72 
 
2004 levels by 2006. There was a significant community type effect for percent native 
species richness (F = 24.777; P = 0.001), with native species accounting for significantly 
less of the total richness in invaded plots (Fig. 3.2B). Percent shared species per plot (1 
m2) had a significant year effect (F = 5.06; P = 0.01), with significantly fewer shared 
species in the final year of the study (Fig. 3.3A). At the 10 m2 level, percent shared 
species declined from 52% in 2004 to 39% in 2006 (Fig. 3.3B). In August, non-invaded 
plots had seven species that never occurred in invaded plots, while there were nine 
species that were unique to invaded plots, including four nonnative species (Table 3.2). 
The Shannon-Wiener index was significantly higher (F = 14.79; P = 0.001) in invaded 
plots than in non-invaded plots (Fig. 3.4B). There was also a significant year effect for 
the Shannon-Weiner index (F = 16.34; P < 0.001) with the lowest value in both invaded 
and non-invaded plots occurring in 2006 (Fig. 3.4B). The NMS analysis of August data 
showed two distinct groups of communities with community type accounting for 62% of 
the variability in the data (Fig. 3.5B). 
Discussion 
Species richness was similar in invaded and non-invaded plots. Instead, 
cheatgrass invasion was associated with a shift in percent native species richness. In 
invaded plots, native species comprised a lower percent of the total richness than in non-
invaded plots. In May, native species in invaded plots accounted for only 62% of the total 
richness in 2006 and 70% in 2007. In August, native species in invaded plots generally 
comprised < 75% of the total richness. A total of ten nonnative species occurred in 
invaded plots over the course of the study. Two of the nonnative species, smooth brome 
(Bromus inermis) and tall wheatgrass (Thinopyrum ponticum), were present on Mt. 

 
 
73 
 
Trumbull due to past range improvement seeding projects. The presence of the remaining 
eight species was likely due to accidental introductions such as seed mix contamination, 
the introduction of cattle from invaded winter grazing pastures, or seeds trapped in mud 
on vehicles. Of the nonnative species on Mt. Trumbull, two species, common mullein 
(Verbascum thapsis) and crossflower (Chorispora tenella), are currently listed as noxious 
in at least one U.S. state (UDSA, NRCS 2010). This contrasts with non-invaded plots 
where native species accounted for nearly 100% of the species richness. By the end of 
this study, cheatgrass was the only nonnative species to occur in the non-invaded plots 
and it was infrequent with low cover values. 
There were also seasonal differences in total cover, diversity, shared species, and 
community composition between invaded and non-invaded community types. Average 
total cover measurements for spring and late summer were consistently between 20-30% 
in the non-invaded plots, across all years, with no consistent trend as to which season had 
the greatest cover values. In invaded plots, cover values were always greater in May than 
in August, with May measurements being as much as four-fold greater within the same 
year. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index for invaded and non-invaded plots was nearly 
identical across all years in May, but in August the plots diverged significantly. The two 
community types had fewer shared species in August for most years at both spatial 
scales. Furthermore, in the May community ordinations, invaded and non-invaded plots 
segregated into two clustered groups. In August, non-invaded plots remained clustered 
while invaded plots were more dispersed. We attributed the seasonal differences between 
the two community types to the winter annual growth habit of cheatgrass. In May, 
cheatgrass is at its growth maximum, accounting for approximately 75% of the total 

 
 
74 
 
cover in the invaded plots in any given year. The native perennial grass, bottlebrush 
squirreltail, dominated non-invaded plots in both May and August. In August, however, 
cheatgrass was just beginning to germinate and contributed low amounts to the total 
cover and aboveground biomass on any plot. The lack of cheatgrass dominance in August 
allowed subordinate species to have a stronger influence on the species composition. 
Loss of biodiversity and local extirpation of species are a major concern in 
biological invasions (Elton 1958; Chapin et al. 2000; Mack et al. 2000; Levine et al. 
2003; Gurevitch and Padilla 2004), particularly with strong transformer species such as 
cheatgrass (Richardson et al. 2000). Invaded plots on Mt. Trumbull supported a slightly 
different plant community at the onset of our study in May 2004, the second year after 
invasion. The differences in the two plant community types amplified over the four years 
of our measurements, with less than 50% of plant species occurring in both community 
types in either sampling season. The proximity of the invaded and non-invaded plots (20 
m apart) and our efforts to standardize the plots for pre-invasion disturbance history, 
edaphic, climatic, and geographic factors, as well as minimizing post-invasion 
disturbances, minimize the likelihood that ecological factors extraneous to the cheatgrass 
invasion explain the differences in community composition. It is, therefore, reasonable to 
attribute the differences in species composition between community types to either the 
ecological conditions that facilitated or initiated the cheatgrass invasion, or as a response 
to cheatgrass dominance after the invasion. 
Little is known about changes in community composition in response to recent 
invasions. This is an important aspect of invasion ecology since nonnative species 
dominance can suppress re-establishment of native species (Eliason and Allen 1997; 

 
 
75 
 
Humphrey and Schupp 2004). Chronosequence analysis of California disturbance sites 
dominated by annual nonnatives, including Bromus species, has shown that short-term 
community changes in response to disturbance can persist on a multidecadal scale 
(Stylinski and Allen 1999). Long-term monitoring of abandoned agricultural fields 
showed that early establishment by nonnative species prevented immigration by native 
species, thus altering the successional trajectory of the plant community (Yurkonis et al. 
2005). 
 
Our study demonstrates differences in plant species composition as a result of 
cheatgrass invasion after only five growing seasons. The vegetation changes we 
documented at Mt. Trumbull during the first five years of cheatgrass invasion could 
produce a trajectory of cascading effects that result in long-term ecosystem changes. 
Cheatgrass and other transformer species have significantly altered many of the 
ecosystems they have invaded (Vitousek and Walker 1989; Belnap and Phillips 2001; 
Evans et al. 2001; Crooks 2002; Belnap et al. 2005; Hooper et al. 2005; Sperry et al. 
2006). By the end of our study, invaded plots had fewer nitrogen-fixing species, no 
longer contained some important nectar sources such as Penstemon barbatus and Phlox 
longifolia, and had a more depauperate native component compared with non-invaded 
plots.

Mature native perennial grasses out-compete an invasive annual grass regardless of 
soil water and nutrient availability 
 
Abstract 
1. Competition and resource availability play an important role in regulating invasions of 
native perennial grass-dominated ecosystems by nonnative annual grasses such as 
Bromus tectorum. 
2. We conducted two parallel greenhouse experiments examining the influence of six 
competition levels, high and low water availability and elevated N and P availability on 
growth of two native perennial grasses (Elymus elymoides and Pascopyrum smithii) and 
the invasive annual grass B. tectorum. We hypothesized that: 1) all three species would 
be negatively affected by increasing competition, 2) above- and belowground growth 
would increase with increased watering with B. tectorum having greater increases than 
the native perennial grasses and 3) above- and belowground growth would increase with 
N and P additions with B. tectorum having greater increases than the native perennial 
grasses. 
3. Bromus tectorum growth was negatively affected by the presence of a single mature 
native perennial grass, regardless of species. The native perennial grasses were more 
influenced by intraspecific competition than by interspecific competition with B. 
tectorum. Increased water availability increased growth for all three species with no 
evidence for differential response by B. tectorum. N and P additions had few influences 
on growth. 
4. Synthesis. Our study demonstrated that mature native perennial grasses such as E. 
elymoides and P. smithii are strong competitors against nonnative annual grasses such as 

 
 
90 
 
B. tectorum across differing water, N and P availability. This finding suggests that 
maintenance of intact perennial grass communities can reduce the risk of B. tectorum 
invasion even with temporal variations in resource availability.

Introduction 
 
Resource competition is an important driver of nonnative plant invasions. The 
ability of nonnative plants to establish and spread in new areas is highly dependent on 
their ability to acquire resources faster than, and often at the expense of, the native plants 
(Rees et al. 2001; Levine et al. 2003; Tilman 2004). Competitive differences between 
native and nonnative species depend on the taxa involved and environmental context in 
which the interactions occur because of species differences in growth and reproductive 
responses to resource availability (Rees et al. 2001). Understanding competitive 
interactions at the time of invasion can help guide prevention and post-invasion 
restoration efforts (Hobbs and Humphries 1995; Davis et al. 2000; D'Antonio and 
Meyerson 2002). 
 
Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) is an example of a highly competitive invasive 
nonnative species (Knapp 1996; Mack 1981). This Eurasian annual grass is the dominant 
species on ~20 million hectares of the Great Basin of the western U.S. and is found in all 
48 contiguous states (Bradley and Mustard 2005; USDA, NRCS 2010). In areas where B. 
tectorum dominates, plant communities often have more frequent fire cycles (Whisenant 
1990; D'Antonio and Vitousek 1992; Brooks et al. 2004) and altered biodiversity (Young 
and Evans 1978; Bolton et al. 1993; Brandt and Rickard 1994; Belnap and Phillips 2001). 
Bromus tectorum invasions are often driven by disturbance (Bradford and Lauenroth 
2006), but undisturbed plant communities can also be invaded (Belnap and Phillips 2001; 
Evans et al. 2001). After invasion, B. tectorum can dominate an ecosystem for many 
decades (Brandt and Rickard 1994). 

 
 
92 
 
 
Competition with perennial grasses can restrict the spread of B. tectorum, and 
other nonnative annual grasses, into new areas (Yoder and Caldwell 2002; Booth et al. 
2003; Chambers et al. 2007). The competitive ability of native perennial grasses against 
B. tectorum is highly dependent on the life stage of the perennial grasses. Greenhouse and 
field experiments have shown B. tectorum will generally out-compete perennial grass 
seedlings (Lowe et al. 2003; Humphrey and Schupp 2004). Evidence from field studies, 
however, suggests that mature perennial grasses, particularly Elymus sp. (squirreltail 
species) and species currently or formerly belonging to the genus Agropyron 
(wheatgrasses), can inhibit B. tectorum establishment and growth (Yoder and Caldwell 
2002; Booth et al. 2003; Chambers et al. 2007). 
 
As an annual grass, B. tectorum is more dependent on the immediate availability 
of essential resources than perennial grasses (Marschner 1995). The arid and semi-arid 
regions where B. tectorum has successfully invaded are, by definition, limited by water 
availability. Furthermore, nitrogen (N) availability can alter B. tectorum germination, 
growth, and competitive ability against perennial grasses (Blank et al. 1994; Lowe et al. 
2003; Beckstead and Augspurger 2004). Availability of phosphorus (P) has been 
positively related to B. tectorum performance (Bashkin et al. 2003; Miller et al. 2006). 
 
Recently, B. tectorum has established persistent populations in montane Pinus 
ponderosa (ponderosa pine) forests of northern Arizona (Laughlin and Fulé 2008; 
McGlone et al. 2009b). Field research has suggested that established perennial grasses 
and plant-available N and P may influence spatial patterns of B. tectorum invasion in 
Arizona pine forests. To evaluate the influence of competition and water and nutrient 
availability on B. tectorum and native perennial grass productivity, we conducted a 

 
 
93 
 
replacement series competition experiment in a greenhouse environment with B. tectorum 
seedlings and mature plants of two perennial grass species native to Arizona ponderosa 
pine forests: Elymus elymoides (bottlebrush squirreltail) and Pascopyrum smithii (western 
wheatgrass). The plants were grown at high and low water availability and with and 
without N and P amendments. We hypothesized that: 1) B. tectorum and native perennial 
grass growth would be negatively affected by interspecific competition, as would B. 
tectorum reproductive potential; 2) B. tectorum and native perennial grass growth would 
be positively affected by increased water availability, as would B. tectorum reproductive 
potential, but that B. tectorum would be more responsive to water additions than the 
perennial grass species and 3) B. tectorum and native perennial grass growth would be 
positively affected by nutrient amendments, as would B. tectorum reproductive potential, 
but that B. tectorum would be more responsive to nutrient amendments than the perennial 
grass species. 
Materials and Methods 
Experimental Design 
 
This study was conducted at the Rocky Mountain Research Station Greenhouse in 
Flagstaff, AZ. We established two parallel replacement series experiments (de Wit 1960) 
each containing a native perennial grass in competition with B. tectorum in a 6 X 3 X 2 
factorial randomized complete block design. For one experiment, we tested competition 
between B. tectorum and E. elymoides. The second experiment tested competition 
between B. tectorum and P. smithii. In each experiment, we tested the effects on plant 
production of six levels of interspecific competition, three levels of nutrient availability, 
and two levels of water availability; for B. tectorum, we also quantified floret and seed 

 
 
94 
 
production. All plants were grown in three-liter plastic pots in a medium of 75% soil 
mixed with 25% perlite to improve drainage. A plastic tray was set under each pot to 
minimize water loss and nutrient leaching. We collected soil for this project 10 km south 
of Flagstaff (35.1°N 111.69°W) in a ponderosa pine-dominated area with basalt-derived 
Typic Argiustolls of the Brolliar series. All three species used in the greenhouse 
experiment grow in the immediate vicinity of the soil collection area. Each of the 10 
blocks contained one replicate of each treatment combination for a total of 720 pots. Each 
treatment replicate was assigned a random location within each block. The blocks were 
established along a moisture and temperature gradient starting at the cooling system on 
the south end of the greenhouse (wettest/coolest) and progressing to the ventilation fans 
at the north end of the greenhouse (hottest/driest). 
Interspecific competitive ability (competition) was determined by comparing 
plant growth in species mixtures to growth in monocultures. The species mixtures were: 
5/0, 4/1, 3/2, 2/3, 1/4, 0/5 native/B. tectorum plants. Elymus elymoides and P. smithii 
seeds were purchased from Granite Seed Company in Lehi, Utah. B. tectorum seed was 
collected in 2007 from P. ponderosa forests at Flagstaff and Mt. Trumbull, Arizona. 
The water availability (water) factor consisted of two watering levels: high and 
low. Watering levels were based on soil moisture content measured in a P. 
ponderosa/bunchgrass community from field data collected near Flagstaff, approximately 
2 km from our soil collection site. Soil moisture content ranged from an average of 4.3% 
immediately before the onset of summer monsoon rains in late June to 18.2% at the 
height of the rains in August. In the greenhouse, we monitored soil moisture (0 – 6 cm 
depth) using a HH2 moisture meter with an ML2x Theta probe (Delta-T Devices, 

 
 
95 
 
Cambridge, England). To avoid soil disturbances to the experimental pots resulting from 
inserting the moisture probe, we established an extra 10 high water and 10 low water pots 
(one each per block) for monitoring soil moisture. Each water-monitoring pot contained a 
monoculture of one of the species used in the experiment. We added 200 ml water to 
each pot when soil moisture content of the associated soil moisture-monitoring pots 
reached a lower threshold of 15% for the high water treatment and 5% in the low water 
treatment. 
 
The nutrient availability (nutrient) factor included three levels: no fertilization, 
fertilization with ammonium nitrate (N treatment), or fertilization with Super 
Phosphate™ (P treatment). The N treatment was applied in aqueous solution on a 
biweekly basis and consisted of 7g N m-2 year-1 applied eight times over the growing 
season. Lowe et al. (2003) reported increased performance in B. tectorum and Bouteloua 
gracilis (blue grama) seedlings with this level of N fertilization. Phosphorus was applied 
at a rate of 5g P m-2 year-1 in a single application on April 1, 2008. This level has been 
shown to significantly increase aboveground growth in native perennial grasses in field 
studies in northern Arizona (G. Newman, School of Forestry, Northern Arizona 
University, unpublished data). 
In May 2007 we planted the E. elymoides and P. smithii seeds at three times the 
desired density. After germination the seedlings were thinned to the target density. Soil 
moisture content was maintained above 10% during establishment. In August 2007, 
commensurate with the timing of field germination of B. tectorum, we planted the B. 
tectorum seeds at three times the target density and then thinned after germination. 
Locations of B. tectorum and native seeds within each pot were randomly assigned at 

 
 
96 
 
approximately equal distance from neighboring individuals and 3 cm from the pot edge. 
At the end of October 2007 we reduced the greenhouse temperature 3°C to induce 
dormancy. We applied an initial nutrient treatment of one-eighth the annual treatment 
(0.02g N per pot, or 0.88 g N m-2 and 0.01g P per pot, or 0.63 g P m-2) prior to inducing 
dormancy. April 1, 2008, we increased the greenhouse temperature to a daytime 
maximum of 30°C and a nocturnal minimum of 18°C, and initiated the water and nutrient 
availability treatments. All measurements and harvests were completed in September at 
the end of the 2008 growing season.  
We quantified aboveground biomass and number of leaves per plant for each 
species. We were unable to reliably separate roots by species, so we only measured total 
root biomass per pot. We also calculated root:shoot ratio pooled over species to assess the 
influence of treatments on biomass allocation. Additionally, we quantified B. tectorum 
reproduction based on per plant floret and seed production. We counted the number of 
leaves for each species and for B. tectorum we counted the number of florets on each 
plant in each pot during each three week sampling period. When B. tectorum had 
senesced in a pot we harvested all plants in that pot. When plants in the pots of all 
competition levels containing B. tectorum within a water-by-fertilizer combination within 
a block were harvested, plants in the pots of the monoculture of the native perennial grass 
for that treatment were also harvested. All aboveground biomass was clipped at the root 
crown then separated by species. To avoid damaging seeds we dried the biomass in a 
drying oven at 45°C for 96 hours. We weighed the biomass, separated the B. tectorum 
seeds from the biomass and counted the seeds. We calculated a per-plant average for all 
above-ground measurements. After completion of aboveground biomass harvests, we 

 
 
97 
 
harvested belowground biomass from all pots. Roots were separated by hand from the 
soil after soaking in a 1% hexametaphosphate solution. The biomass was then oven dried 
at 70°C for 48 hours and weighed. 
Statistical Analysis 
 
We used ANOVA to test for main effects and interaction effects of competition, 
water availability, and nutrient availability on each growth parameter for each species. 
The maximum temporal values recorded for number of leaves and B. tectorum florets per 
plant were used in the analyses. Species-level values of leaf count and aboveground 
biomass for each species as well as B. tectorum florets and seeds were averaged within 
pot to attain an average value per plant. We tested for normality and homogeneity using 
Shapiro-Wilk and Levene’s tests, respectively. Elymus elymoides and P. smithii leaf 
count and aboveground biomass and whole pot root biomass and root:shoot ratio data met 
the assumptions for ANOVA. Bromus tectorum data on leaf count and aboveground 
biomass required log-transformation (ln(χ+1)). Bromus tectorum floret count and seed 
count required a cube root transformation. We conducted a post hoc Tukey’s HSD 
analysis on all significant results except for the main effect of water which only had two 
levels of treatment and did not require post hoc analysis. Since leaf count and 
aboveground biomass can be highly correlated, we calculated a Pearson’s correlation 
coefficient for each species to determine if both variables should be analyzed or if one is 
an adequate description of aboveground productivity. All analyses were conducted using 
JMP software (version 8.0, SAS Institute 2008).

Results 
 
Number of leaves and aboveground biomass were positively and highly correlated 
for all three species. For B. tectorum, number of leaves and aboveground biomass had 
correlation coefficients of r = 0.84 when grown in competition with E. elymoides and r = 
0.85 when grown with P. smithii. Elymus elymoides had a correlation coefficient of r = 
0.82 and P. smithii had a coefficient of r = 0.89 over all treatments. Due to these high 
correlation coefficients, we elected to only report data on aboveground biomass for each 
species. 
The role of competition 
 
The main effect of competition was consistently significant for all response 
variables tested for every species (Tables 4.1 and 4.2). Every measure of B. tectorum 
performance per plant was significantly reduced when grown with one or more mature 
individuals of native perennial grasses (Figs 4.1 and 4.2). The presence of a single mature 
E. elymoides plant reduced aboveground biomass and floret count of B. tectorum by a 
minimum of 74% (Fig. 4.1). Subsequent reductions in B. tectorum performance with 
increasing numbers of E. elymoides were typically < 50%, with small changes in absolute 
values of aboveground biomass and floret production (Fig. 4.1). Bromus tectorum seed 
production had a significant competition x nutrient interaction (Table 4.1), but seed 
production was greater in the B. tectorum monoculture than in competition with E. 
elymoides regardless of nutrient availability (Fig. 4.1B). The competition x water and 
competition x nutrient interactions were significant for floret production, but in both 
instances per-plant floret production was significantly greater in the B. tectorum 

 
 
99 
 
monoculture than in competition with E. elymoides regardless of water or nutrient 
availability (Fig. 4.1C,D). 
The same trends for B. tectorum performance detected in competition with E. 
elymoides were also detected in competition with P. smithii, with a reduction in B. 
tectorum performance by at least 72% in the presence of one native perennial grass (Fig. 
4.2). As with E. elymoides, subsequent additions of P. smithii had less impact on B. 
tectorum aboveground biomass, seed production, and floret production (Fig. 4.2). Bromus 
tectorum floret production had a significant three-way competition x water x nutrient 
interaction (Table 4.2) because of uneven effects of water and nutrient additions over 
levels of competition (Fig. 4.2B). Despite this interaction, B. tectorum floret production 
per plant was greater in B. tectorum monoculture than at all levels of competition, 
regardless of water and nutrient availability (Fig. 4.2B).  
The main effect of competition was significant for aboveground biomass 
production per plant of both native perennial grasses (Tables 4.1 and 4.2). In every case, 
growth was lowest in the native grass monocultures and progressively increased with 
increased presence of B. tectorum (Figs 4.3 and 4.4). 
The competition main effect was significant for root production and root:shoot 
ratio for both the B. tectorum – E. elymoides and the B. tectorum – P. smithii experiments 
(Tables 4.1 and 4.2). For root biomass, the B. tectorum monoculture always had the 
lowest biomass and the native perennial grasses had the greatest, with the combination of 
species having intermediate values (Figs 4.5A and 4.6A). The B. tectorum monoculture in 
both experiments had an approximately 1:1 root:shoot ratio, while the native perennial 

 
 
100 
 
grass monocultures had significantly higher ratios (Figs 4.5C and 4.6B). The pots with a 
species mixture had intermediate values. 
The Role of Water Availability 
 
Water availability significantly affected B. tectorum production in the E. 
elymoides experiment (Table 4.1). Per-plant aboveground biomass was greater in the high 
water treatment (0.81 g dry weight ± 0.09 [mean ± standard error]) than in the low water 
treatment (0.60 g dry weight ± 0.09). Seed production per plant was also greater in the 
high water treatment (58.73 seeds ± 4.21) than in the low water treatment (20.81 seeds ± 
4.49). The competition x water interaction was a significant influence on B. tectorum 
floret production (Table 4.1) because the increase in floret production by watering was 
slightly uneven over competition levels (Fig. 4.1C). 
 
When grown in competition with P. smithii, the water main effect was significant 
for B. tectorum aboveground biomass, seed production, and floret production (Table 4.2). 
Bromus tectorum per-plant aboveground biomass was greater in the high water treatment 
(0.71 g dry weight ± 0.09) than in the low water treatment (0.60 g dry weight ± 0.09). 
There was a significant water x nutrient interaction for seed production, although seed 
production was always greater in the high water treatment regardless of nutrient 
amendment (Fig. 4.2D). There was a significant competition x water x nutrient 
interaction for floret production (Table 4.2) due to uneven effects of both N and P 
additions over competition levels. For most competition levels and nutrient availabilities 
the high water availability treatments had greater floret production (Fig. 4.2B). 
 
There was a significant water main effect for E. elymoides aboveground biomass 
(Table 4.1). Per-plant aboveground biomass was greater in the high water availability 

 
 
101 
 
treatment (4.66 g dry weight ± 0.28) than in the low water treatment (3.74 g dry weight ± 
0.28). Pascopyrum smithii showed a significant water main effect for aboveground 
biomass (Table 4.2). Per-plant aboveground biomass was greater in the high water 
treatment (4.53 g dry weight ± 0.21) than in the low water treatment (3.27 g dry weight ± 
0.21). 
 
Root biomass production and root:shoot ratio were responsive to changes in water 
availability (Tables 4.1 and 4.2). The B. tectorum – E. elymoides experiment had a 
significant water x nutrient interaction, but the main effect of water availability was not 
significant (Table 4.1). Water and the water x competition interaction were significant 
sources of variation in root biomass production in the B. tectorum – P. smithii experiment 
(Table 4.2). Root biomass was consistently greater in the high water pots except for the 
B. tectorum monoculture treatment in which the high water treatment had the lowest root 
biomass of all competition x water treatment combinations (Fig. 4.6A). There was a 
significant water main effect for root:shoot ratio in the B. tectorum – E. elymoides 
experiment (Table 4.1), with a higher root: shoot ratio in the low water treatments (High 
1.22 ± 0.05; Low 1.60 ± 0.05). There were no significant root:shoot ratio responses to 
water availability in the B. tectorum – P. smithii experiment (Table 4.2). 
The Role of Nutrient Availability 
 
None of the species in this experiment showed a significant response to the main 
effect of nutrient availability for any of the response variables we measured (Tables 4.1 
and 4.2). The only detectible influence of nutrients in our study was for B. tectorum floret 
and seed production in both native perennial grasses competition experiments, and root 
biomass production for the B. tectorum – E. elymoides experiment (Tables 4.1 and 4.2). 

 
 
102 
 
In the B. tectorum – E. elymoides experiment, the competition x nutrient interaction was 
significant for B. tectorum floret production (Table 4.1) due to uneven effects of nutrient 
additions over competition levels (Fig. 4.1D). Our interpretation of this interaction was 
that N addition stimulated floret production most when B. tectorum competed with four 
E. elymoides plants. In competition with P. smithii there was a significant competition x 
water x nutrient interaction in B. tectorum florets per plant (Table 4.2). This interaction 
was largely due to stimulation of floret production by N additions in the high water 
treatment when B. tectorum was grown in competition with wheatgrass (Fig. 4.2B). The 
B. tectorum – E. elymoides experiment had a significant competition x nutrient 
interaction for seed production (Table 4.1). Bromus tectorum seed production was 
generally lowest in the N amendments, except for the four E. elymoides to one B. 
tectorum competition level in which the N amendment had the greatest seed production 
(Fig. 4.1B). The B. tectorum – P. smithii experiment had a significant water x nutrient 
interaction for B. tectorum seed production (Table 4.2) due to stimulation of seed 
production in the high water high N combination, but lowest seed production in the low 
water high N combination (Fig. 4.2D). Root biomass production for the B. tectorum – E. 
elymoides experiment had a significant water x nutrient availability interaction (Table 
4.1) due to stimulation of biomass by watering only at high N availability (Fig. 4.5B). 
 
For most of the significant nutrient interactions for all species, P addition had 
intermediate values for seed and floret production when compared to the control and N 
addition. There were a few exceptions, however. In the E. elymoides experiment, B. 
tectorum seed count was highest with P addition in two of the competition levels and B. 
tectorum floret production was highest with P addition at one of the competition levels 

 
 
103 
 
(Fig. 4.1B,D). Bromus tectorum seed count in the P. smithii experiment was higher with 
P addition at low water availability than with the N addition or control at low water (Fig. 
4.2D). 
Discussion 
The Role of Competition 
 
Both B. tectorum and perennial grass individuals were strongly influenced by 
interspecific competition, though with opposite responses. Bromus tectorum response to 
competition was consistent with our first hypothesis that production would be negatively 
influenced by the presence of mature perennial grasses. Although B. tectorum production 
varied with increasing numbers of perennial grasses, the greatest change occurred in the 
presence of a single mature perennial grass. Perennial grass production was influenced by 
B. tectorum, but the response was opposite of our hypothesis, with per-plant production 
of the mature perennial grasses increasing with increasing presence of B. tectorum and 
with reduced intraspecific competition. 
 
Our study demonstrates that mature perennial grasses can be strong competitors 
with nonnative annual grasses. This suggests that the presence of a robust native 
perennial grass community may mitigate the likelihood and intensity of nonnative annual 
grass invasions. There is supportive evidence for this interpretation in field studies. In 
Utah, B. tectorum competition had little negative influence on two-year-old E. elymoides 
plants growing in B. tectorum-dominated areas (Humphrey and Schupp 2004). Leger 
(2008) showed that Elymus multisetis (big squirreltail) plants that persisted in B. 
tectorum-dominated areas were more competitive against B. tectorum than conspecific 
plants growing in non-invaded areas, and suggested that genotypic selection occurred 

 
 
104 
 
after invasion. In a Great Basin study, there was a positive relationship between native 
perennial plant removal and B. tectorum biomass per plant (Chambers et al. 2007). 
Additionally, there was a positive relationship between Agropyron cristatum (crested 
wheatgrass) removal and B. tectorum biomass per plant, as well as number of seeds 
produced per B. tectorum plant. Booth et al. (2003) showed that areas with > 20% cover 
of E. elymoides cover had little or no B. tectorum. There have been instances, however, 
when an intact perennial grassland was not able to successfully exclude nonnative annual 
grass invasion. In Canyonlands National Park, B. tectorum invaded a perennial grassland 
dominated by Achnatherum hymenoides (Indian ricegrass) and Pleuraphis jamesii 
(James’ galleta) (Belnap and Phillips 2001; Evans et al. 2001). Bromus tectorum was able 
to invade this system in spite of the presence of mature perennial grasses and there is 
some evidence that P. jamesii actually facilitates B. tectorum biomass production by 
ameliorating nutrient constraints in the soil (Belnap and Sherrod 2009). In a Mohave 
Desert field study, mature A. hymenoides and Pleuraphis rigida (big galleta) had reduced 
relative growth rates with increasing competition from Bromus rubens (red brome) 
(DeFalco et al. 2007). These results suggest that competitive relationships between 
nonnative annual and native perennial grasses are species-specific and not applicable at 
the functional group level. 
 
In contrast to the results of our study, competition between nonnative annual 
grasses and native perennial grass seedlings typically favors the annual species. In the 
above-mentioned Utah study, B. tectorum competition had a strong negative influence on 
E. elymoides seedlings (Humphrey and Schupp 2004). In a seedling competition study, 
increasing density of Taeniatherum caput-medusae (medusahead) significantly decreased 

 
 
105 
 
E. elymoides biomass, while E. elymoides density had no influence on T. caput-medusae 
biomass (Young and Mangold 2008). Seedlings from native Sporobolus airoides (alkali 
sacaton) had significantly reduced growth and survival in competition with Bromus 
diandrus (ripgut brome) and Hordeum marinum spp. gussoneanum (Mediterranean 
barley) (Hoopes and Hall 2002). The inability of native perennial grass seedlings to 
compete with nonnative annual grasses suggests that disturbances that reduce perennial 
grasses can leave the community highly vulnerable to invasion. 
 
Intraspecific competition appears to be an important regulator of performance for 
both E. elymoides and P. smithii, but not B. tectorum. This may be the result of higher 
belowground biomass production in the native perennial grasses than B. tectorum. 
Monaco et al. (2003) reported lower root:shoot ratios for B. tectorum and T. caput-
medusae than for E. elymoides, E. multisetis, and Pseudoroegneria spicata (bluebunch 
wheatgrass). Interestingly, unlike the results of this study, in the Monaco et al. (2003) 
study, B. tectorum monocultures had comparable belowground biomass to that of the 
three native perennial grasses. Taeniatherum caput-medusae, however, had lower 
belowground biomass than the perennial grasses. Greater root production by perennial 
grasses should give them a competitive advantage over B. tectorum or other annual 
grasses with less extensive root systems (Cline et al. 1977). This disparity in root biomass 
between perennial and annual grasses would likely be less pronounced in perennial grass 
seedlings (Arredondo et al. 1998), potentially explaining the differences in the 
competitive ability of perennial grasses at different life stages. 
 
 

 
 
106 
 
The Role of Water Availability 
 
Water is an important limiting resource in most areas where B. tectorum has 
heavily invaded, including northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests. It is therefore not 
surprising that all three species responded positively to water amendments, consistent 
with our second hypothesis. Contrary to this hypothesis, however, there was little 
evidence that B. tectorum was more responsive to water amendments, with all three 
species having approximately 20 – 40% increases in aboveground biomass with increased 
water availability. Furthermore, the only competition–by-water availability interaction for 
any measure of biomass production was detected in root biomass in the B. tectorum – P. 
smithii experiment, with significant responses to increased water availability only 
observed in the species combinations with zero or one B. tectorum individual (Fig. 4.6A). 
This is surprising because moisture availability, particularly in association with N 
availability, has been associated with B. tectorum growth and invasion success (Cline and 
Rickard 1973; Link et al. 1995). Also, competition for water with B. tectorum has been 
shown to negatively affect the native perennial grass Hesperostipa comata (needle and 
thread) water status and productivity (Melgoza et al. 1990). Beckstead and Augspurger 
(2004), however, showed no significant response in B. tectorum biomass or density from 
water additions in mixed communities of B. tectorum, Poa secunda (Sandberg bluegrass), 
and E. elymoides unless the water additions were combined with N additions and removal 
of neighboring plants. 
It is likely that the timing of precipitation, not the general availability of water, is 
most important for B. tectorum performance. Miller et al. (2006) detected significantly 
greater B. tectorum fall seedling establishment, mid-spring relative growth rates, and final 

 
 
107 
 
biomass in plots with high water availability when compared to plots with low water. 
Early spring growth rates were actually greater in the low water plots than with high 
water (Miller et al. 2006). At other growth stages, high water availability did not 
influence growth. High levels of precipitation during the germination period for B. 
tectorum have been associated with past invasions (Belnap and Phillips 2001; Evans et al. 
2001, McGlone et al. 2009a). Furthermore, the success of B. tectorum and other annual 
nonnative bromes in competing with native perennial grasses has been attributed to the 
earlier physiological activity of annual bromes in the growing season, and therefore 
earlier access to water resources (Knapp 1996; DeFalco et al. 2007). Elymus elymoides is 
also physiologically active early in the growing season which may account for its ability 
to successfully compete with B. tectorum (Booth et al. 2003). 
The Role of Nutrient Availability 
 
Surprisingly, our data do not support our third hypothesis that N and P additions 
would have a greater influence on B. tectorum growth than the native perennial grasses. 
In fact, N and P had little overall influence on the performance of B. tectorum or the 
native perennial grasses with the exception of B. tectorum floret and seed production. 
Interestingly, average seed production for B. tectorum was always above parental 
replacement value (i.e. – one viable seed per plant), regardless of competition or resource 
levels. Plant-available N and P are considered the most commonly limiting nutrients in 
most ecosystems (Elser et al. 2007). Past research has shown N and/or P additions to 
have a positive effect on B. tectorum performance (Lowe et al. 2003; Beckstead and 
Augspurger 2004; Miller et al. 2006). In a replacement series competition study between 
B. tectorum and Bouteloua gracilis seedlings, the addition of 1 g N m-2 increased B. 

 
 
108 
 
tectorum biomass and the addition of 4 g N m-2 reduced B. gracilis biomass in 
competition with B. tectorum (Lowe et al. 2003). 
 
Nonnative annual grasses often show greater growth responses to N and P 
additions than native perennial grasses. With N fertilization, B. tectorum and T. caput-
medusae had greater NO3 uptake and shoot production when compared to E. elymoides, 
E. multisetis, and P. spicata (Monaco et al. 2003). The addition of N at lower rates (5 g N 
m-2) than used in this study caused a seven-fold increase in Schismus arabicus (Arabian 
schismus) biomass in the Mojave Desert, while P additions at the same rate as this study 
caused a 40% increase in S. arabicus biomass (Williams and Bell 1981). With B. rubens 
and S. arabicus, Brooks (2003) detected significant increases in density and biomass with 
additions of 3.2 g N m-2 year-1, a rate of atmospheric N deposition similar to near-urban 
areas of the Mojave Desert. 
The lack of growth response to nutrient additions in this study suggests that 
neither N nor P was a single limiting resource. Since competition had a significant effect 
on growth performance of all three species, this gives rise to the question: for what 
resource were the plants differentially competing? We suggest four possible answers: 1) 
that water remained limiting, even in the high water treatment, 2) N and P were co-
limiting, 3) either N or P was limiting, but co-limiting with another nutrient or 4) a 
nutrient not tested in this experiment limited biomass production. 
Conclusions 
 
Interactions between invasive plant species and indigenous species are complex 
and can vary depending on the species involved, species’ life history, resources that are 
currently limiting growth, soil properties, and numerous other variables. Our study and 

 
 
109 
 
several others suggest that mature native perennial grasses of montane forests of the 
western U.S., such as E. elymoides and P. smithii, are often strong competitors against 
invasive annual grasses, such as B. tectorum. Moreover, the competitive dominance of 
these mature perennial grasses over B. tectorum was maintained at both low and high 
availabilities of soil water, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Our results suggest robust mature 
native perennial grasses are more important detriments to B. tectorum invasion of 
montane forests of the western U.S. than short-term variations in soil resources.

Management Implications 
 
 
 
Prevention and control of nonnative plant invasions pose an increasingly difficult 
challenge to land managers. Despite an intense amount of current research on invasion 
ecology, we still have limited ability to predict invasions and even less understanding of 
how to reverse invasions. Methods for reducing invasion intensity have included 
mowing, targeted grazing, biocontrol, herbicide application, seeding, and soil nutrient 
manipulation (Rinella et al., 2010, Diamond et al., 2009, Davison and Smith, 2007, 
Corbin and D'Antonio, 2004, Cox and Anderson, 2004, Reever Morghan and Seastedt, 
1999, Hull Jr. and Stewart, 1948). To date, successes have been rare while the spread of 
nonnatives continues to occur at a rapid pace. The potential changes imposed on the 
ecosystem by invasion does, however, warrant continued effort to prevent or mitigate 
future invasions. Community domination by a nonnative plant species can lead to 
changes in biodiversity, altered disturbance regimes, and altered soil nutrient cycling 
(Brooks et al., 2004, Evans et al., 2001, Mack et al., 2000, Parker et al., 1999, D'Antonio 
and Vitousek, 1992). These changes are generally regarded as undesirable and most 
public land management agencies include control of nonnative species as one of their 
management objectives. 
 
This study adds to an increasing body of research highlighting the importance of 
preserving and maintaining the native vegetation community, particularly perennial 
grasses, in mitigating annual grass invasion (Chapters 2 & 3). Robust populations of 
bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus elymoides), various species of wheatgrass (Agropyron 
sp.), and other perennial grasses have been shown to effectively exclude nonnative annual 

 
 
124 
 
grass encroachment in several ecosystems (Chambers et al., 2007, Cox and Anderson, 
2004, Booth et al., 2003). This suggests the need to minimize disturbance to the extant 
perennial grass community. Minimizing such disturbances poses a significant challenge 
to land managers, since many public land policies mandate activities that disturb 
understory vegetation. Grazing, off-road vehicle use, and logging can damage vegetation 
and disturb soil. Land management practices designed to promote ecosystem restoration 
can also generate disturbances that can compromise the plant community, at least in the 
short term. Many forest restoration practices involve tree or shrub removal to promote 
growth of perennial grasses and other herbaceous plants. Woody plant removal at large 
scales generally requires the use of heavy machinery that can severely disturb the soil and 
understory vegetation. Forest restoration can also involve the reinstatement of natural 
disturbances such as fire and flooding. While these disturbances can stimulate soil 
nutrient cycling, remove accumulated plant litter, and prevent canopy closure by 
removing aboveground biomass of woody species, the disturbances can also harm extant 
perennial grasses, creating potential habitat for nonnative plant species encroachment. 
 
Many degraded ecosystems lack a substantial community of native perennial 
grasses. The absence of a robust herbaceous plant community is an important criterion for 
identifying areas in need of ecological restoration or changes in the traditional land 
management practices on that site (Allen et al., 2002, Moore et al., 1999). Establishing 
perennial grasses may require proactively increasing propagule levels of desired species. 
This is typically accomplished through seeding. In our field study, seeding of three native 
perennial plant species failed to elicit a detectable response (Chapter 2). All of the 
increases in seeded species occurred through natural recruitment. An increasing number 

 
 
125 
 
of studies have shown seeding to have limited success in promoting rapid establishment 
of native species. Furthermore, there is increasing concern that seeded projects have 
inadvertently spread nonnative seeds through contaminated seed mixes (Keeley et al., 
2006). This suggests that alternative methods must be explored for propagating desired 
species in disturbed areas. Possible options include planting established individuals from 
nearby areas or seeding with early successional species that have high germination rates 
and can establish quickly. Some researchers have advocated “assisted succession” 
through seeding nonnative perennial grasses to minimize nonnative annual grass 
encroachment (Cox and Anderson, 2004). The nonnative perennial grasses would 
stabilize the soil, create a perennial species-dominated community, and allow managers 
to encourage native species to establish. This approach has been met with skepticism, 
however, since seeding nonnative species is often contrary to the objectives of land 
management projects and on some public lands is not allowed. Furthermore, there is 
limited evidence that areas seeded with nonnative perennial grasses will eventually 
convert to native-dominated communities and there are many examples of seeded 
nonnative perennial grasses being highly resistant to the reestablishment of native 
species. 
 
Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) is a highly persistent invader and attempts to 
remediate cheatgrass-dominated areas have generally been unsuccessful. Researchers 
have tried herbicide, targeted grazing, biocontrol with fungi, seeding, mowing, and soil 
nutrient depletion with carbon amendments (Dooley and Beckstead, 2010, Baker et al., 
2009, Diamond et al., 2009, Meyer et al., 2007, Belnap et al., 2003). While many of these 
techniques generate a short-term reduction in cheatgrass abundance, none have reliably 

 
 
126 
 
shifted the community back to a native-dominated plant community. This suggests that a 
multifaceted approach would be necessary to eliminate cheatgrass dominance in invaded 
areas. It is insufficient to simply reduce cheatgrass abundance. The native plant 
community must also be proactively enhanced, particularly with species that are highly 
competitive with cheatgrass such as bottlebrush squirreltail (Chapter 4). As stated above, 
it can be very difficult to rapidly establish native perennial species through seeding and it 
may be necessary to plant established individuals of desired species. This would likely 
require a source of plants that is reasonably close to the planting site. Furthermore, post-
planting maintenance such as watering and grazing exclusion may be necessary to ensure 
successful establishment of the native plants. While this would be more labor-intensive 
than current seeding programs, the general lack of success with seeding warrants the 
exploration of other mechanisms of native plant reestablishment. 
 
Funding and resources for land management are always limited, requiring 
practitioners to prioritize for the most effective use of available resources. To accomplish 
this, it will likely be necessary to focus restoration efforts on areas with the greatest 
likelihood of success. This may require some difficult decisions about which lands are 
most restorable. In ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests, lower elevation ecotones 
seem to be at the highest risk for sustained invasions. The field site for this study was in 
lower elevation ponderosa pine forests, near the ecotone with pinyon-juniper (Pinus 
edulis – Juniperus sp.) woodlands. Similar low-elevation ponderosa pine forests have 
been invaded by cheatgrass (Fulé et al., 2005, Laughlin et al., 2005, Crawford et al., 
2001). Conversely, several interior forest areas of northern Arizona have been resistant to 
invasion regardless of whether they were burned in wildfires or thinned and prescribe 

 
 
127 
 
burned in similar fashion to the treatments on Mt. Trumbull (Kuenzi et al., 2008, 
Stoddard et al., 2008, Moore et al., 2006, Huisinga et al., 2005). Furthermore, future 
climatic changes may alter plant community types, particularly at lower ecotones. Most 
climate change models predict that the lowest elevations of species distributions will be 
the most altered under future climate scenarios (Lenihan et al., 2003, Shafer et al., 2001). 
This suggests that disturbances to these regions will have greater uncertainty in 
successional trajectories of the post-disturbance plant community, with potentially greater 
risk of invasion by lower-elevation nonnative plant species. All these factors suggest that 
mid- and high-elevation areas of forest may have a better chance of successful restoration 
than the low elevation edges of the ecosystem (Laughlin and Fulé, 2008, Fulé and 
Laughlin, 2007). 
 
Another factor important in triaging areas for restoration success is the presence 
of invasive nonnative plants, either within a managed landscape or in neighboring 
communities. This is another indicator of areas that at risk of invasion after disturbance. 
Whenever possible, areas containing nonnative species that are known to be highly 
invasive should be isolated from disturbance. While it is not always feasible, practitioners 
should consider creating buffers of unsuitable habitat between invaded areas and areas 
undergoing planned disturbances. Furthermore, severe disturbances to extant desirable 
vegetation should be minimized to reduce mortality and minimize the habitat made 
available for nonnative species to invade. 
 
The timing of disturbances may also be manipulated to reduce the impacts of 
disturbances. At Mt. Trumbull, at the time of the initial restoration treatments, there was a 
sparse understory and heavy fuel loads when thinned plots were prescribed burned

(McGlone et al., 2009a,b). This may have led to a slower post-treatment response from 
the understory and allowed the initial establishment on cheatgrass across the project site. 
If promoting a robust native perennial grass understory is a desired outcome of the 
restoration project, then it might be advantageous to allow an extended rest period 
between the thinning and application of prescribed fire to allow the extant native 
community to increase. The benefits of a rest period after thinning have been supported 
by studies in northern Arizona that showed an increase in native understory production 
from thinning treatments with nonnative species than in thinned and burned treatments 
(Sabo et al. 2009, Moore et al., 2006).  
 
Lastly, a multistage post-invasion remediation project could be enhanced by 
strategically timed treatments. Since cheatgrass is completely dependent on the seedbank 
for perpetuating the population, the timing of eradication treatments could be timed with 
both phenological stages of cheatgrass to maximize depletion of the seedbank. For 
example, herbicides such as Imazipac (Plateau™) work effectively on pre-emergent 
cheatgrass, but also adversely influence native species (Baker et al., 2009). Other 
herbicides have been shown to inhibit seed production in cheatgrass (Rinella et al., 2010). 
A light, strategically-timed application of herbicide, followed by plantings of native 
perennial grass plugs in the spring could help suppress cheatgrass and simultaneously 
promote native species. 
 
This study highlights two important management concerns for cheatgrass-invaded 
systems. First, cheatgrass is successfully and persistently invading ponderosa pine forests 
of northern Arizona (Chapter 2). While cheatgrass has invaded many western 
ecosystems, ponderosa pine forests are rarely subjected to significant cheatgrass 

 
 
129 
 
invasions. Our results suggest that the risk of cheatgrass invasion into disturbed 
ponderosa pine forests is a serious concern, particularly at the lower elevational limits of 
the forests. Secondly, established native perennial grasses can out-compete cheatgrass 
(Chapter 4). The two species we used in our study, bottlebrush squirreltail and western 
wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii), as well as closely related species, have been shown to 
be strong competitors with cheatgrass in many ecosystems. The strong competitive ability 
of native perennial grasses could be utilized to mitigate the invasion potential of 
cheatgrass and other nonnative annual grasses.
