Carbon and Nitrogen Cycling in Southwestern Ponderosa Pine Forests

Abstract: Ponderosa pine forests of the southwestern United States were historically characterized by relatively
open, parklike stands with a bunchgrass-dominated understory. This forest structure was maintained by frequent,
low-intensity surface fires. Heavy livestock grazing, fire suppression, and favorable weather conditions follow-
ing Euro-American settlement in the late 19th century resulted in a dramatic increase in pine regeneration.
Today, many of these forest stands have high stand densities with low understory production, and are susceptible
to infrequent, stand-replacing fires. The primary objective of our study was to better characterize the contem-
porary carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling processes in relatively unmanaged southwestern ponderosa pine
stands. We then compared these ecosystem conditions with those of an adjacent stand that had received an
ecological restoration treatment that included thinning and prescribed burning. Our results suggest that N
availability and aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) of trees in these forests are low compared to other
forests. Restoration treatments decreased ANPP but increased the proportion of ANPP in woody tissues. These
treatments also increased soil respiration, water availability, temperature, and net nitrification, but had no effect
on net N mineralization and microbial N. We speculate that the understory response to restoration treatments is
a key factor affecting the overall ecosystem response in these forests. FOR. SCI. 52(6):683–693.

P
ONDEROSA PINE (Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson
var. scopulorum Engelm.) forests of the southwest-
ern United States were historically characterized by
relatively
open,
parklike
stands
with
a
bunchgrass-
dominated understory (Covington et al. 1994, 1997). This
stand structure was maintained by frequent, low-intensity
surface fires (every 2–20 years) that rarely reached the
crowns of large trees (Cooper 1960, Dieterich 1980). Heavy
livestock grazing, fire suppression, and favorable weather
conditions following Euro-American settlement in the latter
part of the 19th century resulted in a dramatic increase in
pine regeneration in many of these forests (Cooper 1960,
White 1985, Savage et al. 1996). Today, southwestern pon-
derosa pine forests generally have high stand densities with
low understory production, and are susceptible to infre-
quent, stand-replacing fires (Covington and Moore 1994,
Swetnam and Baisan 1996, Moore et al. 2006).
Due to factors such as the low productivity and low
timber value of these forests, comparatively little is known
about their function relative to other coniferous forests of
the United States (e.g., Pacific Northwest and Southeast).
Indeed, this is true of many of the semi-arid forests of the
Inland West (Johnson et al. 1997, 1998). Recent work
attempting to restore the structure and function of south-
western ponderosa pine forests to pre-Euro-American con-
ditions has increased our knowledge of the controls and
rates of various ecosystem processes in these forests (e.g.,
Boyle et al. 2005, Hart et al. 2005b, Kaye et al. 2005).
Nevertheless, we still have insufficient information across a
variety of different ponderosa pine stands to elucidate the
contemporary range in ecosystem functions in southwestern
ponderosa pine forests.
The primary objective of our study was to better
characterize carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling pro-
cesses in contemporary, southwestern ponderosa pine
stands in a relatively unmanaged condition. We also
compared these ecosystem conditions in one of the un-
managed stands with those of an adjacent stand that had
received an operational ecological restoration treatment
that included thinning and prescribed burning. Finally,
we contrasted the ecosystem pools and processes in these
southwestern ponderosa pine forests with those of other
ponderosa pine-dominated forests in the western United
States.

Methods
Study Sites and Design
The study area is at an elevation of about 2,255 m above
sea level, with gentle topography and a cool, subhumid
climate. Approximately half of the 57 cm of annual precip-
itation in this area falls as winter snow and the other half as
rain during intense summer convective storms (Schubert
1974). The summer growing season is characterized by an
extensive dry period, which generally lasts from May to
July, followed by a wetter period after the onset of mon-
soonal summer rains (Bailey end Covington 2002). Soils are
derived from basalt and are classified as a complex of fine,
smectitic, frigid Typic Argiborolls and Mollic Eutroboralfs
(Miller et al. 1995). Our study sites were a subset of the
Grand Canyon Forests Partnership’s initial wildland-urban
interface (WUI) experimental treatments that were started in
1998 in cooperation with the Coconino National Forest and
the Rocky Mountain Research Station, US Forest Service,
USDA. One of the major goals of these treatments was to
develop operational methods for reducing wildfire hazard in
the WUI around Flagstaff (Fule´ et al. 2001). These treat-
ments were evaluated on three, noncontiguous experimental
blocks (EBs) in or adjacent to the Fort Valley Experimental
Forest, approximately 15 km NW of Flagstaff, AZ
(35°1619N, 111°4122W). Each EB contained a 14.2-ha
replicate of the three thinning levels (restoration treatments)
and a control, with the treatments assigned randomly within
each block (i.e., randomized block design). The EBs were
based on the proportion of presettlement trees (120 years
old) within the stands, which differed among EBs as a
consequence of past management history. More harvest
entries within a given stand resulted in fewer presettlement
trees, a greater number of total trees per unit area, and a
stand with a more even-aged structure (dating to 1919).
Within each EB, stand conditions were relatively homoge-
nous, with basal areas of replicate stands differing by less
than 7.8 m2/ha.
Our original study design included the highest thinning
level that best approximated pre-Euro-American settlement
conditions following the treatment and the control of each
of the three EBs. However, differences in the operators,
equipment used to thin each of the EBs, the method and
amount of slash burned, and length of time required to
implement the treatments resulted in stand and soil condi-
tions that varied considerably among the EBs following
treatment (Fule´ et al. 2001). These differences in application
of the treatments among the EBs required us to change our
study design; we conducted measurements within the three
unmanaged control stands (designated as “U,” one in each
EB) and the treated stand in EB 3 that was the first EB to be
completed (EB 3-R). The stand densities of the three un-
managed stands (EB 1-U, 2-U, and 3-U) were 1,760, 1,094,
and 709 trees/ha, respectively. The basal areas of these same
stands were 33.9, 39.1, and 40.1 m2/ha, respectively. Stand
conditions within these three EBs are representative of those
currently found in contemporary southwestern ponderosa
pine stands (mean tree density for all ponderosa pine stands
in Arizona is about 620 trees/ha, and about 50% of these
stands have basal areas between 23 and 46 m2/ha; O’Brien
2002). Additionally, although the stand densities do vary
among the EBs, stands in all three EBs are at a similar
developmental stage, with relative density indices ranging
from 0.70 to 0.74 (well into the zone of self-thinning for
ponderosa pine; Long and Shaw 2005).
A combination of thinning and burning was used in the
restoration treatment of EB 3 (hereafter called “restored
stand” or “EB 3-R”) to re-establish the structure and func-
tion of the ecosystem to a condition similar to that found in
these forests before Euro-American settlement in the late
1880s (Covington et al. 1997). All living presettlement trees
were retained. Within a 30-m radius of each evidence of a
dead presettlement tree, one or two large (40.6 cm dbh
[1.4 m; dbh]) or three small (40.6 cm dbh) trees were
selected to replace the loss of that tree. All other trees were
removed from the site through a whole-tree harvest opera-
tion conducted in the winter of 1998. This thinning ap-
proach substantially lowered stand density (from 800 to 91
trees/ha and from 39.7 to 8.5 m2/ha of basal area) and
resulted in an aggregated or “clumpy” stand structure. This
structure was characteristic of southwestern ponderosa pine
forest before Euro-American settlement of the region (Cov-
ington et al. 1997). Slash from the harvesting operation was
grouped into piles within the stand, and in the spring of
2000 these piles were burned individually. Soon after, the
entire treatment area was broadcast-burned (Fule´ et al.
2001).
Within each stand, a 60 m  60 m grid was established
with 20 grid points. All trees over breast height were mea-
sured on a 0.04-ha (11.28-m radius) circular plot centered
on the grid point. Tree diameters were originally measured
in all stands from August through November 1998, and then
re-measured during this same period in 2003 for the unman-
aged stands in EB 1 and 2, in 2004 for the EB 3 restored
stand, and in 2005 for the EB 3 unmanaged stand. Litterfall
and soil-based measurements were made between a 12- and
16-m radius from each grid point along an azimuth selected
randomly (15 m2 area).
Net N Transformations and Microbial
Biomass N
We measured rates of net N mineralization and nitri-
fication in situ using the covered core technique (Hart et
al. 1994b) at all the odd-numbered grid points (plots; n 
10/stand). We used six sequential incubation periods with
the incubation length ranging from 35 to 137 (over win-
ter) days (Oct. 19 to Dec. 4, 2000; Dec. 5, 2000 to Apr.
20, 2001; Apr. 21 to Jun. 6, 2001; Jun. 7 to Jul. 18, 2001;
Jul. 19 to Sep. 17, 2001; and Sep. 18 to Oct. 22, 2001).
These lengths were chosen to represent relatively con-
stant soil water content conditions. At each sampling
location and at the beginning of each sampling date, two
intact mineral soil cores (5 cm I.D., 0–15 cm depth)
contained in polycarbonate sleeves were extracted (AMS
684
Forest Science 52(6) 2006

Core Sampler, American Falls, ID) after carefully remov-
ing the forest floor (i.e., O horizon), if present. This soil
depth contains, on average, the A horizon in this soil
type. One core was returned to the laboratory in a cooler
(kept at 4°C) for estimation of total inorganic N pool
sizes (within 48 h). The other core was covered with a
polyethylene cap that had six small holes (0.8 mm diam.)
drilled into its top to allow gas exchange but to minimize
changes in water content during the incubation period.
The bottom of the core was left open. The core was then
returned to the hole from which it came and any forest
floor that was removed was returned over the core. After
the incubation period, cores were removed and returned
to the laboratory on blue ice and processed in a similar
manner as the initial cores.
Soils from initial and incubated cores were sieved field-
moist through a 4-mm sieve, and the 4 mm fraction was
weighed. Subsamples were then removed for gravimetric
water content determination (105°C, 72 h) and approxi-
mately 20 g (field-moist weight) was extracted with 100 ml
of 2 M KCl. Soil suspensions were shaken on a reciprocat-
ing mechanical shaker (90 cycles per minute) for 1 hour and
then filtered through Whatman no. 1 filter paper that had
been preleached with deionized water. The filtered extracts
were analyzed colorimetrically on a Lachat AE Flow-Injec-
tion Analyzer (Lachat Instruments, Milwaukee, WI) for
NH4
	 and NO3

 (Lachat Instruments, Inc., Milwaukee, WI.
2000. QuickChem method no. 10-107-04-1-C; Lachat In-
struments, Inc., Milwaukee, WI, 2001. QuickChem method
no. 12-107-06-1-B), respectively. Mass-based estimates of
inorganic N pool sizes were converted to area-based esti-
mates using the mean bulk density (oven-dry weight of
4-mm fraction per unit volume) of the 12 cores taken from
each plot.
Microbial biomass N was estimated using the chloroform
fumigation-extraction method (Haubensak et al. 2002) in
the initial mineral soil cores taken for estimating net N
transformations (except for the second incubation period,
where microbial N was not determined). One 10-g field-
moist, sieved subsample from each soil core was immedi-
ately extracted with 50 ml of 0.5 M K2SO4. A paired
subsample was fumigated with hydrocarbon stabilized
CHCl3 in a vacuum-sealed desiccator for 5 days. After 5
days, the fumigated subsamples were removed from the
desiccator and extracted with 50 ml of 0.5 M K2SO4.
Extracts were shaken for 1 hour, and then filtered. Both sets
of extracts were digested using a modified micro-Kjeldahl
digestion and analyzed for total N using a salicylate method
(Lachat Instruments, Inc., Milwaukee, WI, 1994. Quick-
Chem method no. 13-107-06-2-D) on a Lachat AE Flow-
Injection Analyzer. The N flush caused by fumigation was
calculated by subtracting the total N in the unfumigated
extracts from the corresponding total N in fumigated ex-
tracts. A kEN of 0.20 was used to convert chloroform-labile
N values to microbial N (Davidson et al. 1989, Hart et al.
1994a).
Carbon Fluxes and Nitrogen Uptake
We measured litterfall to estimate aboveground net pri-
mary productivity (ANPP), aboveground N uptake, and
total belowground carbon allocation (TBCA), and as a com-
ponent of the C and N cycles of the stands. One littertrap
(0.07 m2) was placed at each grid point (n  20 per stand).
Littertraps were installed in August, 2000, and litter was
collected from the traps every few months over a 1-year
period. In the laboratory, all woody litter 1 cm in diameter
was discarded and the remaining material was oven-dried
(70°C) and weighed. Litter was then ground (425 m)
using Wiley Mills (Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, NJ) and
subsamples were analyzed for total C and N concentrations
on a Flash EA 1112 NC Analyzer (ThermoElectron Corpo-
ration, Waltham, MA).
We estimated tree ANPP in each stand by adding annual
litterfall estimates measured over 1 year to the annual in-
crease in aboveground biomass (AB) averaged over the 5-
to 7-year measurement period. Aboveground biomass at the
two measurement periods (1998 (all stands) and 2003 (EB
1-U and EB 2-U), 2004 (EB 3-R), or 2005 (EB 3-U)) was
determined using locally derived allometric equations that
relate tree diameter to AB. Aboveground uptake of N asso-
ciated with this ANPP was calculated by summing the
measured N content returned in litterfall and the increase in
N contained in aboveground tissues; this latter component
was estimated from the change in AB and measures of
tissue N concentrations (Kaye et al. 2005).
We measured soil respiration (net soil CO2 efflux) over
a 13-month period in each stand using the soda lime closed
chamber technique (Edwards 1982) as applied by Kaye and
Hart (1998b). Soil respiration includes both microbial and
root respiration, and thus provides an index of the biological
activity belowground (Kaye and Hart 1998b). Furthermore,
soil respiration measurements coupled with litterfall rates
can
be
used
to
estimate
total
plant
C
allocation
belowground.
Soil respiration measurements were made at all 20 grid
points in each stand every 2 to 3 weeks during the growing
season (from July 2000 to December 2000 and May 2001 to
August 2001) and approximately monthly over the winter
period (from January 2001 to April 2001). Chamber design
and sampling protocol were identical to Kaye and Hart
(1998b) except a different factor was used to correct for the
mass of water released when soda lime reacts with CO2.
Kaye and Hart (1999b) used the factor of 1.41 that was
originally proposed by Edwards (1982). However, we used
the value of 1.69 in the current study as Grogan (1998) has
shown that the empirically derived value of 1.41 is incor-
rect; a value of 1.69 reflects the stoichiometry of the reac-
tion of soda lime with water (Grogan 1998). Annual soil
respiration rates were estimated using each measurement as
a midpoint between sequential sample dates. Half of the
nonmeasurement days were assigned to each measurement
date. The soil respiration value from each measurement was
then multiplied by the number of nonmeasurement days
assigned to that measurement, and then these values were
Forest Science 52(6) 2006
685

summed to produce an annual estimate (Kaye and Hart
1998b).
The soda lime closed chamber technique as applied here
was compared to infrared gas analyzer measurements by
Kaye and Hart (1998b) in a ponderosa pine forest stand
close to our study site. Although the two methods were
found to be highly correlated, the soda lime method tended
to underestimate soil respiration even after adjusting for the
lower correction factor used by Kaye and Hart (1998b).
Hence, the soda lime method may have underestimated soil
respiration in the current study.
Total belowground C allocation (TFCA) by plants was
estimated in the three unmanaged stands based on mass
balance. Assuming that the annual changes in soil C stocks
are small relative to soil respiration and litterfall fluxes:
TBCA  soil respired C 
 litterfall C. We did not calculate
TBCA for the restored stand because the recent disturbance
from the restoration treatments likely violated this quasi
steady-state assumption (Raich and Nadelhoffer 1989, Gi-
ardina and Ryan 2002).
Microenvironmental Measurements
Soil temperature and volumetric soil water content were
measured at the beginning of each 24-h soda lime incuba-
tion period to determine the influence of microenvironmen-
tal factors on soil respiration and to characterize the abiotic
conditions within each stand. Soil temperature was mea-
sured at all 20 grid points within each stand using digital
probe thermometers (VWR Digital Dial Thermometer,
Chester, PA) placed at a 7.5 cm mineral soil depth. Volu-
metric water content of soil was measured in each stand
using a Trace Systems Time Domain Reflectometry unit
(Soil Moisture Corporation, Santa Barbara, CA) at the even-
number grid points only (n  10). Time domain reflecto-
metry probes were permanently installed to a depth of 15
cm measured from the top of the litter layer.
Statistical Analyses
This study included an observation component (charac-
terizing the ecosystem pools and processes within unman-
aged southwestern ponderosa pine stands) and an experi-
mental component (comparing these components between
an unmanaged and a restored stand within the same exper-
imental block, EB 3). We did not have any replication of the
restoration treatment at the stand level for the reasons out-
lined above; hence, we only qualitatively evaluated the
effects of the restoration treatment on soil pools and pro-
cesses. In these qualitative comparisons, the restoration
treatment was only compared with the single control stand
(EB 3-U), rather than the mean of all three control stands,
because of the blocked nature of the original experimental
design.
We evaluated temporal changes in soil pool and pro-
cesses of the replicated unmanaged stands using one-way
analyses of variance with sampling date as the factor (ANO-
VAs; Glantz 2002). The values measured at the various grid
points within a stand were averaged before these analyses
(i.e., n  3). We compared different sampling dates using
the Holm-Sidak method when sampling date was a signif-
icant factor (Glantz 2002). Linear regression analysis was
used to explore the abiotic controls (soil temperature and
water content) on soil respiration. Pearson product-moment
correlation analysis was also used to elucidate the potential
covariance in net N transformation rates. All statistical tests
were performed using SigmaStat software at the P  0.050
significance level (version 3.11, Systat Software, Inc., San
Jose, CA).

date was a significant factor for all three rates (Figure 1).
Across all soil samples assessed, net nitrification was
weakly correlated with net N mineralization (r  0.339,
P  0.001, n  240).
The mean amount of N contained in microbial biomass
across the study period was similar among the unmanaged
stands, ranging from 13.2 to 14.9 g N m
2 (Table 1). Fur-
thermore, microbial N in the restored stand was similar to
that of the unmanaged stand in EB 3 (Table 1). However,
there was considerable temporal variation in microbial N
among the unmanaged stands (P  0.001). Microbial N
tended to be lowest among all four of the stands during the
October and June sampling dates when soil water content
was also relatively low (Figures 2 and 3a). Indeed, across all
plots, stands, and sampling dates, microbial N was corre-
lated with gravimetric water content (r  0.560, P  0.001,
n  200).
Averaged over the study period, extractable organic N
pools in the upper 15 cm of mineral soil ranged from 0.83
to 1.23 g N m
2 among the unmanaged stands. This soil N
pool was similar in magnitude in the restored stand com-
pared to the unmanaged stand in EB 3 (Table 1). Ammo-
nium pools averaged over the study period ranged from 0.16
to 0.23 g N m
2 among the unmanaged stands, and the
restored stand had a greater NH4
	 pool size than the un-
managed stand in EB 3 (0.28  0.05 and 0.16  0.09
g N m
2, respectively; Table 1). Nitrate pools averaged
over the study period were small in the unmanaged stands
(0.01 to 0.02 g N m
2), but this pool was greater in the
restored stand than the unmanaged stand in EB 3 (0.05 
0.01 and 0.01  0.01 g N m
2, respectively; Table 1).
Total C and N Pools and Fluxes
Forest floor C and N pools among the unmanaged stands
ranged from 1,720 to 3,440 g C m
2 and 52.4 to 63.0
g N m
2 (Table 2). The restored stand in EB 3 had forest
floor C and N pools that were 19 and 30% lower, respec-
tively, than the unmanaged stand in EB 3 (Table 2). Annual
litterfall C and N fluxes ranged from 68.2 to 76.9
g C m
2 yr
1 and 0.85 to 0.90 g N m
2 yr
1, respectively
(Table 2). In EB 3, the restored stand had litterfall C and N
inputs that were 45 and 41%, respectively, of the values in
the paired unmanaged stand (Table 2). The reduction in N
inputs was due to a reduction in litterfall mass because the
litter N concentration was similar between the unmanaged
and restored stands (6.39  0.23 and 5.83  0.33 g N kg
1,
respectively).
Assuming that the forest floor C and N content are near
steady-state within the unmanaged stands, we estimated the
mean residence time (MRT  forest floor elemental
content/litterfall elemental input; Waring and Schlesinger
1985, Barnes et al. 1998) to be 26.5 to 50.3 years for C and
60.7 to 117 years for N (Table 2). We could not calculate

hence we could not assume steady-state conditions. In the
unmanaged stands, total C in the surface mineral soil ranged
from 2,540 to 3,000 g m
2 and soil total N ranged from 126
to 130 g m
2. Both the restored and unmanaged stands in
EB 3 had similar mineral soil total C and N stocks (Table 1).
Concentrations on a mass basis ranged from 19.1 to 25.5
g C kg
1 and 0.96 to 1.10 g N kg
1 and were similar for the
restored and unmanaged stands in EB 3 (data not shown).
Tree AB in the unmanaged stands ranged from 6.6 to 7.7
kg C m
2 (Table 3). Following restoration in EB 3, tree AB
was about 24% of the unmanaged stand value (EB 3 re-
stored  1.9  0.3 kg C m
2 and EB 3 unmanaged  7.7

2). The amount of N contained within the tree
AB ranged from 21.5 to 25.0 g N m
2 in the unmanaged
stands. In EB 3, the lower amount of N contained in the tree
AB of the restored stand than the unmanaged stand was
proportional to the lower tree AB in the restored stand (EB
3 restored  5.9  1.1 g N m

the unmanaged stands was as branch and stem wood; how-
ever, the amount of ANPP in wood was higher in the
restored stand (42  3%) than in the unmanaged stand
within EB 3 (31  3%).
The amount of N taken up by the AB ranged from 0.98
to 1.06 g N m
2 yr
1 in the unmanaged stands. In EB 3,
aboveground N uptake was about 42% lower than in the
paired unmanaged stand (EB 3 restored  0.42  0.06

1 and EB 3 unmanaged  1.00  0.07

up annually in tree AB went into foliar tissues replacing loss
in litterfall (Table 2).
Annual rates of soil respiration from the unmanaged
stands ranged from 843 to 891 g C m
2 yr
1 (Table 3). In
EB 3, the restored stand had annual rates of soil respiration
about 27% higher than the unmanaged stand (EB 3 re-
stored  1,070  20 g C m
2 and EB 3 unmanaged 
844  20 g C m
2). Soil respiration varied greatly across
seasons, and differences in soil respiration rates between the
restored and unmanaged stands in EB 3 appeared to vary by
sampling date (Figure 4). For the unmanaged stands, soil
respiration was poorly correlated to soil temperature when
soil water content was 0.18 m3 m
3 (r2 adj.  0.009, P 
0.001, n  378), but the correlation improved considerably
when soil water content was 0.18 m3 m
3 (r2 adj. 
0.631, P  0.001, n  160). Similar relationships were
found in the restored stand (data not shown). Estimated
TBCA ranged from 767 to 823 g C m
2 yr
1 for the un-
managed stands (Table 3).
Soil Microenvironment
Soil water content (upper 15 cm of soil profile) varied
considerably over time among stands (ranging from about
0.05 to 0.30 m3 m
3; Figure 3a), and soil water content was
generally higher in the restored stand than the unmanaged
stand in EB 3. Soil temperature (7.5 cm mineral soil depth)
also varied substantially over the year within each stand
(ranging from 0 to 25°C), and the overall temporal pattern
was similar among the unmanaged stands (Figure 3b). The
restored stand in EB 3 generally had soil temperatures
1–3°C higher than those of the paired unmanaged stand
(Figure 3b).
Discussion
Carbon and Nitrogen Fluxes in Southwestern
Ponderosa Pine Stands
Relatively low annual precipitation, prolonged dry peri-
ods during the growing season, and the input of relatively
low quality litter (high lignin to N ratio) to the forest floor
are defining characteristics of contemporary southwestern
ponderosa pine forests (Kaye et al. 2005). The combination
of these factors results in relatively low rates of C and N
cycling compared to forests from more humid regions. For
instance, the MRTs of C and N in the forest floor found in
Figure 3. Changes in mean volumetric soil water content (a; upper 15

our study are among the lowest reported for forests world-
wide (Vogt et al. 1986, Hart and Firestone 1991). These
exceedingly slow rates of decomposition and net N release
have been substantiated using litterbag studies in similar
southwestern ponderosa pine forests (Klemmedson et al.
1985, Hart et al. 2005b).
Net rates of N transformations in the surface mineral soil,
where the majority of fine roots are found in southwestern
ponderosa pine ecosystems (Hart et al. 2005a), are low
compared to other forests (Binkley and Hart 1989), as are
the rates of N uptake into AB (Perry 1994, Barnes et al.
1998, Fisher and Binkley 2000). Low rates of net N min-
eralization and net nitrification are also characteristic of
contemporary ponderosa pine forests throughout the west-
ern United States (Table 3). Low net N transformation rates
compared to N uptake coupled with low annual precipita-
tion and high evapotranspiration lead to very low losses of
N from leaching, even following disturbances (i.e., thinning
and burning) that occur during restoration (Johnson et al.
1997, 1998, Kaye et al. 1999).
Our measurements of ANPP within the unmanaged pon-
derosa pine stands are some of the lowest reported for other
ponderosa pine stands in the southwestern United States and
elsewhere (Table 3), as well as in other forests (Perry 1994).
Part of the explanation for the low ANPP values reported in
our study is that the stands that we evaluated had lower
standing AB compared to these other forests (Table 3).
Nevertheless, based on the relationship between peak stand-
ing foliar biomass (FSB) and ANPP found by Webb et al.
(1983) across terrestrial biomes of the United States, our
stands
should

1 (FSB calculated from litterfall data; Hart and
DiSalvo 2005). Furthermore, using Lieth’s (1973) equations
relating mean annual precipitation (MAP) or mean annual
air temperature (MAAT) to ANPP across terrestrial ecosys-
tems worldwide, our stands should have ANPP values of
about 400 (MAP) or 650 (MAAT) g C m
2 yr
1. In con-
trast, using a more recent analysis of MAP-ANPP relation-
ships across biomes of North America (Knapp and Smith
2001), we estimate that our stands should have ANPP about
140 g C m
2 yr
1. This latter value is much closer to the
actual values we measured in these stands (Table 3), but still
is about 20% high. We speculate that the low ANPP of
southwestern ponderosa pine ecosystems are due, in part, to
the seasonality of the precipitation and low relative humid-
ities leading to high vapor pressure deficits and reduced net
photosynthetic rates (Kolb and Stone 2000). There have
been few assessments of N limitations to ANPP in south-
western ponderosa pine forests, but those that have occurred
have showed modest increases in diameter growth follow-
ing N addition (Wagle and Beasley 1968, Heidmann 1985).
Nevertheless, low N supply to trees could also contribute to
the low rates of ANPP compared to predicted values based
on structural (foliar biomass) and abiotic (MAAT and
MAP) variables.
Our estimates of TBCA using mass balance are high
relative to other ponderosa pine forests (Table 3), as well as
other forests in general (Litton et al., submitted for publi-
cation). Indeed, the ratio of ANPP to TBCA in the unman-
aged stands assessed in our study was about 0.15, near the
lowest value reported for forests (range of 0.12 to 1.75;
Litton et al., submitted for publication). Other forests that
had low ANPP-to-TBCA ratios included an 11-year-old
Acacia mearnsii forest in Australia (0.13) and two pine
forests (0.12 in a 23-year-old ponderosa pine stand in Ore-
gon, and 0.26 in a 7- to 9-year-old Pinus elliottii stand in
Florida). Our estimates of soil respiration were higher than
previous values reported in a nearby ponderosa pine forest
at the Gus Pearson Natural Area (GPNA), but similar to soil
respiration rates from ponderosa pine forests in the Pacific
Northwest (Table 3). Part of the reason for the lower values
from GPNA is that respiration was not measured during the
winter months but modeled using soil temperature-respira-
tion relationships from the growing season (Kaye and Hart
1998b). Based on our measured soil respiration rates during
the winter in this study and at the GPNA (S.C. Hart,
Northern Arizona University, unpublished data 2005), these
modeled values substantially underestimate actual soil res-
piration during the winter. Apparently, significant soil res-
piration occurs from these forests even when the mineral
soil temperature is near 0°C. Previous research in ponderosa
pine forests (e.g., Law et al. 1999) and other ecosystems
have found substantial soil respiration occurring under
snowpack during the winter (e.g., Grogan and Chapin
1999).
Soil water availability limits the rates of many ecosystem
processes in southwestern ponderosa pine forests. In our
study, the overriding control of water was clearly shown by
the poor correlation found between temperature and soil
respiration under water-limiting conditions, but not when
water was relatively available. Additionally, experimental
additions of water to both the restored and unmanaged
stands within EB 3 resulted in a substantial increase in soil
respiration and ponderosa pine live fine-root biomass (fine-
root biomass increase statistically significant in unmanaged
stand only; Selmants et al., submitted for publication). At
GPNA, Boyle et al. (2005) found that changes in water
availability following the summer monsoonal rains in-
creased soil enzyme activities and changed the ability of the
culturable soil microflora to use a variety of substrates in the
soil. We also found that microbial N pools covaried signif-
icantly with soil water availability in our study. However,
not all soil processes appear to be as sensitive to changes in
soil water content. For instance, net N transformation rates
showed relatively few statistically significant changes
across incubation periods in our study. Nevertheless, the
low ANPP-to-TBCA values in southwestern ponderosa pine
stands may be a response to the relatively low soil water
availabilities in the forests (Litton et al., submitted for
publication).
Potential Effect of Ecological Restoration on
Ponderosa Pine Ecosystem Function
The operational restoration treatment assessed in our
study was unreplicated, hence we are unable to predict how
other southwestern ponderosa pine forests would respond to
similar restoration treatments. Nevertheless, the effects of
restoration on C and N cycling processes in this operational
treatment were largely consistent with a replicated restora-
tion experiment at the nearby GPNA that was conducted
using more intensive treatments on a much smaller scale
(Covington et al. 1997). For instance, in our study, despite
an 90% reduction in tree density and 80% reduction in
basal area, tree ANPP was only reduced by 50% follow-
ing the application of the restoration treatment. The drastic
reduction in stand density in the restored stand was partially
offset by increased wood production in the remaining trees.
Similar results were reported by Kaye et al. (2005) at GPNA
for the initial 2 years following treatment. Also similar to
some previous research at GPNA, soil respiration was en-
hanced following restoration treatments in our study. Kaye
and Hart (1998b) found that soil respiration rates were
enhanced during a dry year (1996) and not during a more
average precipitation year (1995) following restoration
treatments at GPNA. The 2 years during which we mea-
sured soil respiration were also dry years (34 and 38
cm yr
1 for 2000 and 2001, respectively; data averaged
from three nearby weather stations; USDA Forest Service
RMRS,
www.rmrs.nau.edu/weather/stations/,
July
23,
2005). Both in our study and at GPNA, soil temperature
increased during the growing season following restoration
treatments. These increases in soil temperature are likely
responsible, in part, for the higher respiration rates in the
restored stands observed in these studies (Kaye and Hart
1998b, Hart et al. 2005b). Finally, the soil microbial bio-
mass as a whole seems relatively unresponsive to these
690
Forest Science 52(6) 2006

restoration treatments both in our study and at GPNA, but in
both studies certain microbial groups appear to be enhanced.
For instance, at both GPNA and in our study, net nitrifica-
tion rates were higher following the restoration treatments,
and these increases in nitrification rates appear to be due to
increased nitrifier population sizes (Hart et al. 2005b).
There were important differences in ecosystem response
to the operationally applied restoration treatments in our
study compared to the highly controlled, experimental treat-
ments applied at a much smaller scale at GPNA. For in-
stance, we found that net N mineralization did not increase
significantly immediately following the restoration treat-
ments, unlike the result at GPNA (Kaye and Hart 1998a,
Kaye et al. 2005). Furthermore, we found that thinning and
burning associated with the restoration treatments in our
study increased soil water availability relative to the unman-
aged stand, but the control treatment at GPNA actually had
higher soil water availability (Hart et al. 2005b).
What accounts for the differences in ecosystem re-
sponses to the restoration treatments conducted in our case
study with those previously conducted at the replicated
restoration study at GPNA? We speculate that differences in
understory growth (primarily bunchgrasses in both study
locations; see Korb et al. 2003 and Moore et al. 2006 for
species list) after the thinning and burning treatments
largely explain the contrasting ecological responses in these
studies (Hart et al. 2005b). At GPNA, herbaceous cover
responded immediately and dramatically to the restoration
treatments (Covington et al. 1997, Moore et al. 2006).
However, herbaceous cover did not increase significantly
during the first couple of years following restoration treat-
ment in our study (Korb et al. 2003). Large increases in
herbaceous biomass could account for the decrease in sur-
face soil water availability at GPNA following restoration,
because bunchgrasses have higher leaf-specific transpira-
tion rates than ponderosa pine (Kaye et al. 1999, Naumburg
et al. 2001). Furthermore, increases in understory biomass
could also explain the increases in net N mineralization
following restoration because their higher litter quality
(lower C:N ratio) than pine litter leads to greater N release
during decomposition (Hart et al. 2005b). It is unclear why
there was such a positive herbaceous response at GPNA
compared to these operational restoration study sites. Nev-
ertheless, the influence of previous management and the
much greater ground disturbance that occurred in the oper-
ational restoration treatments than in the small-scale, exper-
imental restoration treatments at GPNA may be important
(Korb et al. 2003, Moore et al. 2006).
Contemporary southwestern ponderosa pine stands are
relatively low-productivity coniferous forests with very
conservative N cycles. Apparently, low soil water availabil-
ity is a major driver controlling ecosystem processes in
these forests. Restoration of southwestern ponderosa pine
forests to their pre-Euro-American structure appears to de-
crease tree ANPP but increase the proportion of production
in woody tissues. Future research needs to elucidate the
factors that lead to poor understory response following
restoration treatments and ways to enhance herbaceous pro-
ductivity. Current research using operational-scale restora-
tion treatments, with replicated designs and applying the
same harvesting methods across treatments, should help
elucidate if the ecosystem changes following restoration
treatments observed in this case study are generalizable
across the southwestern ponderosa pine forest type (see Fire
and Fire Surrogate Study, Jim McIver, www.fs.fed.us/ffs/,
May 23, 2006).
