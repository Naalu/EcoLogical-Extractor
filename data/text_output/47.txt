Developing a Model "for Adaptive 
Ecosystem Management 
'T he intent of ecosystem manage­
ment is ro ensure rhar wildland 
management is adaptive ro cur­
rent and future knowledge and values. 
Ecosystem management has been pro ­
posed as a solution to many concerns fac­
ing public lands forestry today (O verbay 
1992:Thomas 1994).Thought-provoking 
co nceptu al 
models 
abound 
(Hof and

and 
new models and ana ­
lyti cal roo Is will be

future. Bur

- these 
models 
have 
been tested in real-

combining of packages or-such individual 
site actions into options for foresrw ide

analysis of environmental effects and the 
site- or project-specific actio ns underlying 
them. It is also cons istent with evolving 
views on how to implement ecosystem

and objectives, and a specific set of feasi­
ble act ions (Holling 1978: Walters and 
Holling 1990: Baskerville 1985). One ex­
ample of such a set of guidelines is the 
Management Recommtndations for the 
Northern Goshawk in the Southwestern 
United Statts (Reynolds et al. 1992). 
hereafter referred to as the Goshawk 
Guidelines. 
The northern goshawk (Accipiter gtn­
tilis atricappilus) is the largest member of 
the genus Accipter, which includes both 
the sharp-shinned hawk (A. striatus) and 
the Cooper's hawk (A cooperii). It breedsin 
coniferous, deciduous, and mixed forests 
throughout much of North America, and 
is the top predator in the food chain in 
many forested areas of the Southwest. It 
was listed as a "sensitive species" by the 
USDA Forest Service Southwestern Re­
gion in 1982. Based on the recommenda­
tions of an interdisciplinary committee of 
scientists, the Northern Goshawk Scien­
tific Committee developed the Goshawk 
Guidelines. Through a landscape-level set 
of forest structure and diversity objec­
tives--combined with operational con­
srraints-s-rhe guidelines seek to preserve 
and maintain breeding habitat and prey­
base divers iry for the goshawk. The pur­
pose of this study was to evaluate the util­
ity ofa computer-based planning model in 
developing and assessing implementation 
strategies for the Goshawk Guidelines. 
Analytical Procedure 
The Kaibab National Forest's Paris 
Ecological Land Unit (ELU) comprises 
approximately 11,000 acres of ponderosa 
pine, mixed conifer, and aspen forest 
rypes. It is an area of great scenic beauty 
with many limestone sinkholes, rich for- ' 
ests, and views ofGrand Canyon National 
Park. There were six known active north­
ern goshawk nest sites within or near the 
Paris ELU at the time the study began in 
the summer of 1992. 
An interdisciplinary (ID) team-as­
sembled to develop the management plan 
for the Paris El.U--escablished a series of 
activities for sett ing up and evaluating the 
computer model. 
Assessment of relevant issues, concerns, 
and opportunitiesfor theplJInning:27'1:14.The 
ID team concluded that compliance with 
the recently released Goshawk Guidelines 
would be the foundation of their analysis. 
The team decided on a 20-year planning 
horizon, with an opportunity for reentry 
10 years into the plan, based on current

The DFC may apply ro rhe manage­

achieved rhrough long-term plan irnple­
mentation (Grossarrh and Nygran 1993). 
The Goshawk Guidelines define a 
DFC characterized by specific disrriburion 
of vegetational structures wirhin critical 
horne-range components. This structure 
varies among vegetation types (tabu 1). A 
management indicaror-s-vegerarive StrUC­
rural stage (VSS)-is provided by which 
forest vegetation can beclassified (fig. 1). 
Specified VSS distributions are ro be 
achieved through managemenr acriviries 
inrended ro improve habitat for the 
goshawk as well as operational constraints 
intended to minimize the adverse effecrs of 
managemenr activities on the species. 
The Goshawk Guidelines also specify a 
spatial arrangemenr for these vegetation 
. conditions, based on zones reflecting 
home-range components for individual 
goshawk pairs. These components include 
rhe nest area of approximately 30 acres. 
the posr-fledging family area (PFA) of ap­
proximately 420 acres. and the foraging 
area (FA) of approximately 5,400 acres. 
Adjacency of these vegetation condirions is 
nor explicit wirhin the PFAs and FAs, ex­
cepr for limits on rhe size ofopenings. The 
guidelines' scale of management is the sub­
srand level (table 1). 
Because of the small size of the nest 
area. irs sensiriviry ro individual tree 
groupings , and the relatively low resolu­
rion of the inventory information avail­
able, the ID team decided that nest-area 
planning would be accomplished wirhour 
computer analysis, using instead recorn­
mendarions from wildlife staff. Wirhin the 
PFAs and FAs. the DFC would be the per­
cenrage of each VSS specified by the 
Goshawk Guidelines (table 1). 
Development ofa database for quantify­
ing th( releuant manag(mmt indicators. 
Srand boundaries were available in geo­
graphic information sysrem (GIS) formar 
(fig. 2a). Within each stand, a variable-ra­
dius plor sampling technique. the stage-Z 
stand exam. had been used to perform a 
tree inventory in accordance wirh Foresr 
Service procedures. Due to the substand­
level management specified by the guide­
lines, the ID team determined rhar the 
plot-level stand exam information was the 
besr esrirnare of substand variation. Re­
searchers created substand modeling units 
(SMU) based on individual inventory 
plots, using a combination of customized 
software and a GIS. 
GIS analys is disaggregared the stand­
level inventory using a "bounded" Theis­
sen polygon approach. This approach is 
based on the assumption that, at the sub­
stand level. the best indicator of the vege­
ration condirion ar a particular location is 
the inventory poinr nearest thar location. 
Because the stand boundaries represen red 
an interpreted break in vegetation condi­
tions, only the nearest poinr within the 
same stand is realisric as an esrirnare. 
Theissen polygons have the desirable char­
acteristic of adjusring individual SMU 
acreages to the density of sampling in a 
particular area . Each SMU represents a 
proportionate area of the stand. For each 
of the 87 inventoried stands in the ecolog­
icalland unir (ELUJ, the GIS was used ro 
select only those inventory points that fell 
within the boundaries of a particular 
stand. A Theissen polygon map was rhen 
created wirhin the stand using these se­
leered points. 
The resulring individual maps were 
overlaid ro create an SMU coverage for the 
entire ELU. The area ofthe Theissen poly­
gon associated with a particular inventory 
poinr « 1 ro >90 acres) was the area as­
signed ro thar SMU for the analysis (fig. 
3). The SMUs were classified by foresr 
type as ponderosa pine. mixed conifer, 
aspen, or nonsrocked (the spruce-fir type 
does not occur in the Paris ELU) . Stand-

The authors recognize the statistical pit. 
falls in disaggregating a rather coarse vari­
able-radius point inventory in this fashion. 
However, the stage-2 standexam represents 
the best information about vegetation con­
ditions available to most Forest Service 
users. Satellite or other remote sensing 
techniques generally provide inadequate 
resolution with respect to identification of 
species. size, condition, and regeneration 
for modeling of [his rype. Using srage-Z 
exam information in this fashion limited 
the degree [0 which the actual spatial dis­
tribution of vegetation conditions and size 
of treatments could be modeled. Conse­
quently, we envisioned that the model 
would result in general marking guidelines 
for the crews implementing the treatments 
on the ground. rather than specifying the 
exact treatments to be applied to eachacre 
of each subsrandarea. 
Forest Service wildlife scaff had 
mapped the nest sites and POSt·fledgling 
family areas for the six resident goshawk 
pairs, but the foraging areas presented a 
problem. Due to the density of goshawk 
nest areas(6) within the II ,OOO-acre ELU, 
and the fact that each FAIS nominally 
5,400 acres, there was insufficient land

pliance goalsfor the shared FA In these al­
ternatives, simultaneous hierarchical goals 
were set for the shared FAand the FAAUs it 
encompassed. The VSS distribution goals 
for the shared FA would represent the 
"landscape" level, while the goals within 
each of the FAAUswould ensure dispersion 
of these VSSs across the landscape. 
Simulation ofthe trajectory ofthe man­
agement indicators through time under al­
ternative management unit treatment op­
tions. The growth and srrucrural trajecto­
ries of ind ividual SMUs were simulated 
using a modification of the ECOSIM 
growth and yield/treatment simulation 
model (Rogers e: al. 1984 ; Covington et 
al. 1988). Simulations assumed no major 
disturbances such as crownfires or bark 
beetle outbreaks. Silviculrural treatments 
were based on the Kaibab National Forest 
interpretation of the Goshawk Guidelines. 
Multiple treatment options (including no 
treatment) and tim ing alternatives were 
simulated for each modeling unit. This 
process created a database containing 
growth and structural trajectories for each 
SMU based on each treatment/riming op­
tion. These predicted trajectories were 
then used to develop project area alterna­
tives. Outputs from the model include 
stocking (basal area and trees per acre) by 
species and size class, fuel loadings. canopy 
closure, volumes harvested (both as pulp 
and sawtimber), and dwarf mistletoe rat­
ing. After simulation, each SMU was clas­
sified according to VSS as defined in the 
Goshawk Guidelines for each time period. 
Development ofELU alternatives based 
on combinations ofindividual managemmt 
unit treatment options. Mathematical for­
mulations representing the five treatment 
alternatives defined in step 4 were gener­
ated using goal programming, which em­
ploys techniques conceptually similar to 
Mendoza er al. (1987) . Goal program­
ming allows reasearchers to simultaneously 
solve a management formul ation for mul­
tiple goals, wh ile applying user-adjustable 
weights to penalize over - and under­
achievement ofeach goal. It is not the only 
mathematical optimization technique 
available to structure and solve problems 
such as this, and cue must be taken in the 
application and interpretation of any opti­
mization model. 
Equal penalty weights were applied to 
over- and underachievement of each VSS 
goal for the initial runs in all alternatives. 
In order to test for multiple optima (math­
ematically equal solutions that migh t 
nonetheless be d ifferent from a manage­
ment or ecological point of view) penalty 
weights were iteratively adjusted for each 
alternative. The following discussion re­
flects the "best" solution achieved for each 
alternative. 
Comparison ofELU alternatives to select 
the alternative that best achieves ecological 
and other objectivesfor the assessment area. 
Figure 4 presents comparison of the trends 
for each alternative over time for the shared 
FA and the average of all the PFAs. A com ­
parison of canopy closure in year 20 for 
rwo alternatives is presented in figure 5. It is 
important to note that since the Goshawk 
Guidelines specify both size and density 
criteria for inclusion in a goshawk VSS 
class, not every acre fits the criteria for in­
clusion. Therefore, the sum of the acres for 
all VSS classes may be less than the total 
area of the ELU. The figures show that 
none of the alternatives completely com­
plied with the guidelines on either the 
PFAs or the shared FA. All alternatives 
showed deficits ofVSS 4 (mid-aged forest), 
VSS 5 (mature forest), and VSS 6 (old for­
est). The differences among alternatives in 
producing these VSSs in the future also do 
not manifest themselves clearly given the 
20-year scope of the analysis. 
There is a small decrease in VSS 6 by 
the end of the planning period under all 
alternatives except NO-TREAT, due co 
projected mortality in the older trees and 
characteristics of the VSS classification sys­
tem. Specifically, because VSS is based on 
the size class with the highest proportion 
of stocking relative to the stand density 
index for that size class, a large number of 
small trees growing up-under an oversrory 
of old-growth trees may cause the VSS 
classification to oscillate over time be­
tween old-growth and VSS 2. 
When evaluated 20 years after initial 
treatment, both of the GOSHAWK 1 al­
ternatives show a large surplus in VSS 2 
(seedling-sapling) compared to GOS­
HAWK 2 alternatives. This result suggests 
mat, in the absence of fire, a single treat­
ment followed by an extended period of 
. no treatment could result in a great sur­
plus of small trees.The NO-TREAT alter-

ever, natural disturbances such as fire, in­
sects, or disease would be expected to cre­

created through regeneration harvests, all 
GOSHAWK alternatives were able to 
maintain sufficient VSS 1 in all periods in 
which treatments were allowed. 
The GOSHAWK 2 and GOSHAWK

closely complies with the Goshawk Guide­
lines. But the tirneframe of the analysis is 
too short to achieve full compliance with 
the guidelines under any alternative, or to 
fully assess the long-term effects of imple­
menting the Goshawk Guidelines on VSS 
4,5, and 6. 
What Have We Learned? 
Computer models can provide decision­
makers with strategies for achieving man­
agement objectives and illustrate the trade­
off's between competing objectives. Any 
such problem, as solved on a computer, 
however, is limited by the adequacy of the 
available data, the definition of the man­
agement indicators and objectives, and the 
simplifying of assumptions used in the 
models and analysis. Computer models 
40 
December 1995 
cannot, and should nor, ultimately decide 
which alternative is "best" and which trade­
off's are worthwhile. These decisions, as well 
as the structuring and analysis of the alter­
natives, must be made by people. The ID 
team must continue to play the central role 
in identifying issues, developing and inter­
preting alternatives, and recommending 
the "best" compromise between conflicting 
management objectives. 
Performing an analysis on the imple­
mentation of the Goshawk Guidelines re­
quired a substantial, and statistically per­
ilous , manipulation of the available data 
(e.g., creation of the SMUs through disag­
gregation of the inventory). The adequacy 
of available data with respect to current 
forest conditions at an appropriate scale 
was the most limiting factor in this analy­
sis, and this should be ofconcern to policy. 
makers . However, the modeling tech­
niques employed here. given p;oper data, 
show promise in providing the analytical 
support necessary for a berrer understand­
ing of ecosystem management issues and 
the rradeoffs implicit in them . 
The Goshawk Guidelines presented 
desired future conditions in terms of a 
quantifiable management indicator. VSS, 
which could be related to the existing in­
ventory, making simulation and analys is 
possible. VSS, as a management indicator, 
shows instability (i.e., oscillation between 
the VSS classification of the understory vs. 
the overstory) when evaluated via tempo­
ral simulation. This deficiency should be 
noted by future creators of similar man­
agement indicators and guidelines. But no 
matter what management indicators are 
chosen for a particular ecosystem manage­
mem analysis, it seems certain that inven­
tory data will need to be more sophisri­
cared (although not necessarily more volu­
minous) and more easily related to the 
management indicators selected (Hof and 
Raphael 1993). Management indicators to 
be subjected to numerical analysis need 
quantitative definitions that are amenable 
to simulation and evaluation in a long­
term , curnularive-effects context. The 20­
year planning horizon chosen by the ID 
team in th is study, while long in compari­
son with many sim ilar planning efforts, 
proved roo short to fully assess the cumu­
lative effects of implement ing the Gos ­
hawk Guidelines on future forest structure 
and development. 
Planning models are valuable to deci­
sionmakers to the degree that they allow 
people to think through problems; they are 
not predictive models (johnson 1986). At 
best, given dear specification of the assump­
tions and goals of the analysis and adequate 
information, models of this type allow for 
better understanding of the general trajec­
tory that various management alternatives 
set for the landscape. and may suggest cor­
rective measures if the ecosystem implica­
tions of mat trajectory are unacceptable . mD
