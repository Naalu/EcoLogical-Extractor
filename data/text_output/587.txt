Pine Bunchgrass 
Ranges in Northern 
Arizona Resulting 
from Pine Regeneration 
and Grazing

PONDEROSA PINE forests in north- 
ern Arizona, particu]ar]y in the 
immediate vicinity of F]agstaff and 
Wi]]iams, have undergone marked 
changes in herbaceous plant cover 
during the past fifty years as a re- 
suit of logging and grazing. Large 
forested areas were clearcut around 
the turn of the century. Even the 
uncut 
timber 
stands 
were 
more 
open than they are today. Present 
forest conditions contrast striking- 
ly with early photographic records 
and descriptions (4). A deficient 
undergrowth of seedling and sap- 
ling pines was reported in the for- 
est surveys of 1901-1902 and as a 
consequence the forest floor was 
more fully occupied by herbaceous 
species. This may explain in part 
why early estimates of livestock 
greatly exceeded present numbers. 
At the turn of the century, the 
inadequate regeneration of pon- 
derosa pine caused grave concern 
among southwestern foresters (7, 
8). The acute problem of natural 
reforestation was greatly relieved 
when, in 1919, an unusual distribu- 
tion'.of 
moisture 
favored 
the suc- 
cessful germination of the previous 
year's excellent seed crop. As a re- 
sult of this rare combination 
of fac- 
tors, a record crop of pine seed- 
lings became established (8, 9). It 
has been reported that heavy graz- 
ing reduced the competition of- 
grasses for soil moisture on many 
areas 'and also reduced the fire haz- 
ard 
of herbaceous 
fuel 
accumula- 
tions, thus favoring a high degree 
of survival among the numerous 
pine seedlings. Seedling crops of 
less importance became established 
in 1910, 1914 (8), and 1929 (2). 
Although poorly stocked locali- 
ties still exist, a general abundance 
of young pines has become estab- 
lished 
over 
extensive 
areas

northern Arizona. 
Young pines 
have filtered into virgin timber 
stands, extended into natural grass- 
land openings, and restocked such 
cut-over areas where an adequate 
number 
of 
seed trees 
were 
left. 
This extensive pine growth has se- 
riously increased the problems of 
livestock management by creating 
obstacles 
which 
hinder 
uniform 
livestock distribution (3) and by 
causing an actual reduction of for- 
age. 
This decline in forage was rec-. 
ognized by G. A. Pearson (10), 
who stated: 
It must be expected, however, that the 
establishment of dense sapling and pole 
thickets will decrease forage production. 
Unless this is anticipated and provided 
for, a time will come when the number of 
livestock on areas of second growth will 
exceed the carrying capacity, to the detri- 
ment of associated areas in the process 
of regeneration. 
This paper presents experimen- 
tal evidence demonstrating that on 
pine-bunchgrass range (1) grass 
density declines as pine seedlings 
become established and develop in- 
to saplings; (2) the greater the 
amount of the 1919 pine canopy, 
the less the total herbaceous cover; 
and (3) under protection from 
grazing tall bunchgrasses dominate 
the 
herbaceous 
cover 
under 
all 
amounts of tree canopy, but under 
the heavy grazing practiced they 
have largely been replaced by 
plants more resistant to grazing, 
except under the heavier tree cano- 
pies. From these findings, infor- 
mation on judging range condition 
is presented and other practices for 
range improvement suggested. 
Description of Plots 
In 1912, R. R. Hill, one of the 
pioneer grazing examiners of the 
region, established five livestock ex- 
closures that provided a good rep- 
resentation of the bunchgrass for- 
age type within the ponderosa pine 
zone on the Coconino plateau (11). 
The five selected sites were located 
within a 15-mile radius of Flag- 
staff at elevations ranging from 6,- 
700 to 8,200 feet. The areas were 
heavily grazed and some were seti- 
ll8 
ously overgrazed at the time of 
fencing. 
In the absence of climatological 
records at each plot the annual pre- 
cipitation and frost-free periods 
can be approximated from the 
nearest weather stations at Flag- 
staff, and the Fort Valley Experi- 
mental Forest (Table 1). In eval- 
uating the average annual precipi- 
tation and frost-free periods of the 
five plot locations, we must con- 
sider comparative elevations, ex- 
posures, and distances from the San 
Francisco mountains. It is probable 
that the annual precipitation means 
and the average frost-free periods 
of the four lower plots were com- 
parable to the recorded means for 
Flagstaff. Reese Tank, being locat- 
ed at a considerably higher eleva- 
tion on the northern slopes of the 
mountains, probably received more 
precipitation annually and had 
considerably shorter frost-free pe- 
riods than those recorded at either 
Flagstaff or the Fort Valley Ex- 
perimental Forest. 
The soil at Reese Tank is a shal- 
low reddish gravelly loam with a 
broken 
surface 
of volcanic 
rock. 
The soils at Rogers Lake and Fry 
Park are heavy reddish clays of a 
malpais origin, whereas the soils at 
Black Springs and Big Fill are 
gravelly sandy loams of both lime- 
stone and sandstone origin. The 
soils outside the exclosures appear 
to fit the earlier soil descriptions of 
Talbot and Hill (11). As a result 
of livestock trampling, these soils 
are more tightly compacted than 
those within 
the exclosures. 
The 
thin A horizons are most clearly 
distinguished within the fenced ex- 
closures, where, due to protection, 
the surface layer contains a higher 
amount of organic matter than the 
soils subjected to grazing and 
trampling. Even after 36 years of 
protection the A horizons within 
the fenced areas are only 2 to 8 
inches thick. 
The herbaceous understory is 
made up predominantly of grasses. 
The principal grass species which 
are most widely distributed over 

FEBRUARY 1950 
119 
the 
five 
areas 
include 
mountain 
muhly (Muhlenbergia montana), 
muttongrass ( Poa f endleriana ) , 
Arizona rescue (Festuca arizon- 
ica), squirreltail (Sitanion hys- 
trix), and blue grama (Bouteloua 
gracilis). 
Grass and grasslike plants which 
are common but more unequally 
distributed 
between the five areas 
include black dropseed (Sporobolus 
interruptus), pine dropseed (Ble- 
pharoneuron tricholepis ) , Kentucky 
bluegrass (Poa pratensis), spike 
muhly 
(Muhlenbergia wrighti), 
deergrass (Muhlenbergia rigens), 
Junegrass ( Koeleria cristata), lit- 
tle bluestem (Andropogon scopari- 
us), and sedges (Carex spp.). 
Of these grasses, blue grama, 
black dropseed, little bluestem, pine 
dropseed, and the muhlys are 
warm season species and thus make 
their growth and are principally 
valuable for grazing during the 
summer rainy period. The rest, be- 
ing cool season species, produce a 
considerable part of their growth 
and provide good forage during 
early spring and occasionally dur- 
ing fall. The best forage composi- 
tion' therefore includes a good mix- 
ture of these species. 
Although weeds occupy only a 
small part of the herbaceous cover 
under protection, they are more 
prevalent on the grazed areas out- 
side the five exclosures. The weeds 
include a large number of species 
of which 
a few 
occur more 
fre- 
quently than others. These include 
yarrow ( Achillea lanulosa ) , pussy-

um spp.), daisies (Erigeron spp.), 
asters (Aster spp.), penstemons 
(Penstemon spp.), clovers (Trifol- 
ium spp.), and lupine (Lupinus 
spp.). 
The history of logging at two of 
the plots predated the establish- 
ment of the Coconino National For- 
the in 1905. According to the best 
available records the area in the 
vicinity of Big Fill was first logged 
between 1895 and 1897, and was 
given a second cutting of 80 per- 
cent by volume in 1919 under For- 
est Service supervision. The Black 
Springs area was heavily cut in 
1902 (Fig. 1). The Rogers Lake 
area was heavily logged between 
1905 and 1906, and Fry Park in 
1910. Thus the timber stands of 
these four areas at the time the ex- 
closures were erected in 1912 in- 
cluded only the scattered trees left 
by logging. Of the five areas, only 
the Reese Tank plot was established 
within a virgin stand of open pon- 
derosa pine timber. All areas are 
now fairly well stocked with stands 
of young pines. 
Trend in Grass Density 
Twenty-five permanent meter 
quadrats were estblished •vithin the 
five exclosures in 1912. Seventeen 
of these were in natural openings 
or openings created by logging. 
The charts of these 17 protected 
quadrats were used to determine 
how the establishment 
and growth 
of seedling pines subsequently 
caused a loss in perennial grass 
density, this loss being independ- 
ent of any livestock grazing influ- 
ence. 
The 17 protected quadrats were 
divided into two groups. Ten 
quadrats located in openings in 
1912 and remaining continuously 
open through 1941 were placed in 
group A. These were distributed 
within 
the five exclosures. The 7 
remaining qnadrats which were lo- 
cated in openings in four of the 
five exclosures in 1912 but which 
became partially 
or completely 
shaded by young pines after 1919 
were placed in group B. The dif- 
ference in grass density between 
these two qUadrat groups repre- 
sents the inhibiting influence exert-

ed by the young pines (Table 2. 
Pig. 2). 
The difference in total grass den- 
sity between tile two groups was 
Jess than one percent in 1912. At 
the time the plols were established 
the areas were heavily logged and 
heavily grazed. In l'espouse to the 
combined treatments of logging re- 
lease and protection from grazing 
both qnadrat gronps showed a par- 
allel 
increa,• 
in 
•rass 
density 
through the 1921 chartiug. Prior 
to 1919 there was a gem, ral ab- 
sem. e of pine regeneration and as a 
result 
the differem'e 
between 
the 
total grass densitios of the two 
qnadrat groups did uot exceed one 
percent. 
The mm•erona pine seetllin• 
of 
1919 bad not made their appear- 
am,e above the herbaceous species 
by 1921 (Fig. :L,I). In 1924 the 
difference between the total grass 
densities of the two groups exceed- 
ed two percent density for the first 
time, indicating that the piue seed- 
lings had begun to exerl a suppres- 
sire effect upon the grass of the B 
quadrata. 
Since the pine seedlings were in- 
eonspimlons in 1921, it is likely 
that their heights did not exeee(l 2 
feet by 1924. ('onsldering this freq. 
we doubt whether the shade east by 
the 5-year-old pines could have se- 
rionsly influenced the grass densi- 
ty. Dominanee was largely achieved 
by overcoming the herbace(ms corn- 
petition 
for 
soil nloistnre. 
Tile 
herbaceous cover was later restrict- 
ed by the additional influences of 
shading, the heavy accumulation of 
pine needle litlet, and the intercep- 
lion of snow and rain. 
The differ- 
enee between 
herbaceous 
densities 
of the two (tna(h'at groups. there- 
fore, ire'teased as the small seed- 
lings grew to sapling size and fur- 
ther suppressed the total grass tletl- 
sity of the E qnadrats. 
At first, competitive growth from 
lhe pine seedlings merely retarded 
the increase of perennial grass on 
the quadrats of Ilronp E. An 
tual decline in the total grass den- 
sities of the E qnadrats was (,fret.t- 
ed by the time the 1933 cbartiu• 
was made. By 1941 this decline ha(l 
redut-ed the total grass densit3 of 
the E qna(Irats below the inilial 
t'harting in 1912. Thus the estab- 
lishment and growth of the 1919 
pine seedlings t'nnse(t a loss of 
about 23 pereeut of the initial 
grass density. 
The 
maximum 
differcute 
be- 
tween the total •rass density of the 
two quadrat groups was reached 
1938. 113 1941 the density differ- 
ellee between the two quadrat 
groups had decreased substantially 
below 
the

showed 
a trend 
similar 
to that 
of

Changes in grass composition be- 
tween 1912 and 1941 involved 
not 
only dominance of one species over 
another 
but 
also such individual 
characteristics as shade tolerance, 
response 
to elimarie fluctuations, 
and' seasonal growth habits. A sep- 
arate evaluation of such individ- 
ual grass characteristics was be- 
yond the scope of the limited quad- 
rat data. 
Quadrat comparisons have clear- 
ly demonstrated that the establish- 
ment and growth of the 1919 crop 
of pine seedlings has reduced and 
is continuing to reduce herbaceous 
ground cover (Fig. 3B). 
Domi- 
nance of young pine stands over 
herbaceous 
cover can still 
be ob- 
served throughout 
widespread 
areas of the Coeonino plateau, 
wherever extensive seedling, sap- 
ling, and pole-sized stands are 
found. 
Effect of Crown Canopy 
The 1919 pine stands within the 
five exclosures were sampled in 
1948 to determine the relationship 
existing between the amount of 
crown 
cover and the herbaceous 
densities and grass yields. One 
hundred line transects, each fifty 
feet long, were used in the exami- 
nation. Canopy measurements were 
made by recording 
the crown 
spread intercept along the transect 
wire. 
The transects were placed 
under 10 predetermined canopy 
classes ranging from 10 to 100 per- 
cent. The predetermined canopy 
classes were obtained by so adjust- 
ing the location of the transect 
wire that the crown spread inter- 
cept measured 5, 10, etc., up to 50 
feet. 
The location of the transects 
was strictly determined by the se- 
lection of canopy classes and repli- 
cated samples were taken under 
each canopy class. 
This method of sampling provid- 
ed the following conditions: (1) 
sampling was restricted to the 
young even-aged stands of 1919; 
(2) equal samples were collected 
under each canopy class; and (3) 
being confined to the five exclo- 
sures, the influence of livestock 
grazing was eliminated. 
The herbaceous 
densities 
occur- 
ring under the different canopy 
classes were determined by the line 
intercept method described by Can- 
field (1). 
These were made up 
principally of perennial grasses, 
notably Arizona rescue, mountain 
muhly, muttongrass, blue grama, 
black dropseed, and squirreltail, 
with lesser amounts of a variety of 
perennial weeds including yarrow, 
pussytoes, thistle, daisies, asters, 
acd penstemon. 
Canopy intercept offered the best 
means of measuring the dominance 
exerted by the trees. Although tree 
dominance probably extended be- 
yond the crown spread limits, for 
lack of better measuring methods, 
canopy intercept was employed to 
represent the total effect of the

An inverse 
relationship was 
found between the herbaceous den- 
sity and the different amounts of 
pine canopy (Table 3). On all five 
plots herbaceous densities declined 
under increasing amounts of pine 
canopy. Measurements of species

creased at approximately the same 
rate under the increasing amounts

showed a high degree of uniformity 
within the same canopy classes of 
the five different 
areas. The mean 
herbaceous density under a 10 per- 
cent tree canopy was about five 
times as great as that occurring un- 
der the 100 percent canopy. 
The grass yiel.ds also declined as 
the amounts of pine canopy in- 
creased (Table 4). The difference 
in grass yields between each of the 
five exelosures was surprisingly 
small in spite of wide differences 
between their topographic posi- 
tions. The five areas were therefore 
highly similar in their productive 
capacities. The mean grass yield 
under a 10 percent canopy was 
about five and one-half times as 
great as the mean yield harvested 
under a 100 percent canopy. 
Since the productive capacities 
of the five exclosures were highly 
similar, a separate area was exam- 
ined in order to determine the in- 
fluenee site productiveness exer- 
cised over the relationship between 
herbaceous cover and tree canopy. 
A high producing site supporting 
a pole-sized 
stand of the 1919 seed- 
ling crop was found approximately 
two miles from Reese Tank. This 
high producing site had approxi- 
mately the same elevation, slope, 
and exposure as that described for 
Reese Tank. It was subject to very 
light grazing. 'The only visual dif- 
ference was found in the soils. The 
surface soil was a deep black silt 
loam with a high content of organic 
matter, in marked contrast to the 
soil at Reese Tank which was shal- 
low, rocky surfaced, and deficient 
in organic matter. 
Under a 10 percent canopy the 
high producing site supported an 
herbaeeous density of 7.8 percent 
and produced a grass yield of 925

pounds per acre, approximately 
three times as great as that ob- 
tained 
at 
Reese Tank. 
Under 
a 
complete canopy the herbaceous 
density was 0.25 percent and the 
grass yield 45 pounds per acre at 
the high producing site, ahnost 
identical 
with that 
at Reese Tank. 
The fact that no greater amount of 
herbaceous cover was produced un- 
der the complete eauopy on a good 
site indicates that the trots growing 
in dense stands tnade essentially 
full use of both the high and low 
producing sites. Such high produc- 
ing sites are for the most part of 
local importance in northern Ariz- 
ona. The productive capacities of 
the five experimental areas are 
more representative of the ponder- 
osa pine forests as a whole. Even 
on highly productive sites. the oc- 
currence 
of 
dense 
timber 
stands 
places a distinct limitation ou herb- 
aceous ground cover. The presence 
of timber staud.q thus coustitutes 
a 
limitation

Under 
increasing 
amounts of 
canopy in the five exclosures. the 
decreasing herbaceous densities 
and grass yiehls showed a uniform 
linear regression. which proved 
highly significant .•tatistically (Fig. 
45. A fairly constant relationship 
existed between the mean grass 
yields and the mean herbaceous 
densities under all canopy classes. 
Each one percent herbaceous den- 
sity was equivalent to an air-dry 
grass yield of approxi•nately 150 
pounds. This eousisteut relation- 
ship was largely due to the uni- 
form herbaceous composition of the 
exelosures 
aud 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
transcots 
were 
located 
under 
the 
even-aged 1919 pine stands. It is 
mdikely that a comparable rela- 
tiouship between grass yiehls aud 
total herbaceous 
densities would be 
found under uneven-aged forest 
stands subject to grazing use. siuee 
grazing frequently causes a loss of 
the tall lmm.hgrass dominants and 
favors the increase of secondary. 
prostrate growth forms. (In many 
heavily grazed forest opentugs, a 
high total bcrbaceons density may 
consist chiefly of such prostrate 
weeds as pussytoes and sandworts. 
A high herbaceous denstry in this 
ease would produce a sinall grass 
yield. 
Effect of IJrazing 
To illustrate the effect of graz- 
ing on the herbaceous cover 21;0 
fifty-foot liue transeets were locat- 
ed at random 
within 
the five ex- 
closures in 1•41 
and compared 
with an eqnal renubet located on 
the adjm.ent grazed ranges. tlerb- 
aceous densities 
were measured 
as 
previously described. Due to ran- 
domization. crown spread measure- 
ments included seedling, sapling, 
pole, blackjack, and mature pines. 
A few deciduous trees and shrubs 
were included in the canopy meas- 
urements. In almlysis of the data, 
the 520 line trauseets were grouped 
according to their crown spread in- 
tereepts into the following canopy 
classes: 0-l, 1-10, 11-20, and so on 
to 91-100 petecut. The mean crown 
spread was calculated and the mean 
herbaceous density determiued for 
the tra•lseets grouped within each 
canopy class. 
The herbaceous ground cover 
was separated into three fractions 
to evaluate better the effect of graz- 
ing. The herbaceous composition 
was segregated into (1) weeds. (2) 
grass species titat escape or 
stand a high degree of grazing 
abuse, and (3) bunchgrass species 
that are highly seusitive to repeat-

less resistant bunchgrass species in- 
cluded •nountain muhly, Arizona 
rescue, muttongrass, pine dropseed, 
and such less abundant species as 
spike muhly, deergrass, little blue- 
stem, Junegrass, and needlegrass 
( Stipa spp.). 
The 
total 
herbaceous 
densities 
within the ungrazed exclosures de- 
clined under increasing amounts of 
the uneven-aged forest canopy 
(Fig. 5). Although the relation- 
ship between canopy and herba- 
ceous densities approximated a 
straight line, a much greater varia- 
tion occurred between the points 
than 
was obtained 
under 
the can- 
opy of 1919 pine stands (Fig. 4). 
Tlais greater variation was attrib- 
Utable in part to (1) the uneven- 
aged forest canopy, and (2) the un- 
equal distribution of the random 
samples within the different canopy 
classes. In spite of this greater 
variation, the results of random 
sampling provided a highly repre- 
sentative picture of the five un- 
grazed forest populations. 
Under protection from grazing, 
the taller bunchgrass species domi- 
nated the herbaceous composition 
within the five exclosures. The spe- 
cies that escaped or withstood a 
high degree of repeated grazing 
were less abundant. 
Each 
of the 
three herbaceous fractions occupied 
a fairly consistent proportion of 
the composition under all canopy 
classes. This uniform composition 
indicates that the herbaceous vege- 
tation was largely in balance with 
the climate and that any effects of 
past grazing had been effaced dur- 
ing the long period of protection. 
These results again indicate that 
the 
total 
herbaceous 
cover 
de- 
creased with increasing amounts of 
pine canopy. In addition, they in- 
dicate that under protection (1) 
the bunchgrass species normally 
dominate the herbaceous 
cover; (2) 
the grass species which either es- 
cape or withstand a high degree of 
grazing abuse occur as natural 
components of the herbaceous com- 
position but in sub dominate abun- 
dance; (3) perennial weeds occupy 
a small but constant part of the 
total herbaceous ground cover; and 
(4) annuals are generally rare ex-

The effect of grazing becomes 
particularly apparent when Fig- 
ure 6 is compared with Figure 5. 
The degree of grazing use was 
highly variable not only between 
the five areas but also between the 
timber stands and openings. Com- 
parison of Figures 6 and 5 stresses 
the more erratic pattern of the 
densities subjected to grazing use. 
In spite of the extreme variation 
between points the inverse relation- 
ship between total 
herbaceous 
density and canopy was generally 
maintained on the grazed areas. 
The herbaceous fractions, however,

failed to show the uniform pattern 
such as was obtained under pro- 
tection. 
Further comparison of Figures 
5 and 6 clearly indicates that the 
bunchgrass species were highly 
sensitive to grazing, particularly 
under the lighter canopy classes 
where grazing was intense. This 
supports the findings of earlier 
workers (11, 6, 5), who attributed 
the susceptibility of the bunchgrass 
species to grazing damage to their 
tall growth habits. By repeated re- 
moval of the tall stems and leaves 
the bunchgrasses on the grazed 
areas were reduced to a small part 
of the total herbaceous cover. This 
result contrasts sharply with those 
obtained from the ungrazed ex- 
closures, where the bunchgrass spe- 
cies dominated 
the herbaceous com- 
position. 
It is further evident, from a com- 
parison of the two figures that 
grass species which either escape or 
withstand heavy grazing occupied 
a greater percentage of the total 
herbaceous composition on the 
grazed areas. Earlier investigators 
(11, 5, 6) observed that the more 
grazing resistant species were fa- 
vored as the sensitive bunchgrasses 
were overgrazed. Of the grasses 
that possess the ability to with- 
stand heavy grazing, blue grama 
and black dropseed occupied a con- 
siderable portion of the density on 
the grazed areas. Of these two spe-

cies blue grama occurred most 
abundantly. The ability of these 
species to withstand grazing was 
closely linked with their growth 
habits, notably the concentration 
of the short leaves near the ground 
level. Even so, these species also 
suffered severe losses in openings 
subjected to concentrated grazing 
and trampling (Fig. 6). 
Squirreltail and two species of 
threeawns escaped grazing damage 
for a slightly different reason. 
Squirreltail, a cool season species, 
makes its greatest growth in early 
spring. The long, sharp awns of 
this species, which probably dis- 
courage grazing use, usually reach 
maturity by the time livestock en- 
ter the high mountain ranges. Ari- 
zona threeawn escapes grazing be- 
cause of its awns. 
Fendler 
three- 
awn possesses both the short basal 
foliage growth and the sharp awns. 
Species of this kind also increased 
as the bunchgrasses suffered losses 
from grazing damage. 
The amount 
of herbaceous 
cover 
occupied by weeds was much great- 
er on the grazed areas than within 
the five ungrazed exclosures. Areas 
vacated by the loss of perennial 
grasses under heavy grazing be- 
came occupied by perennial and 
annual weeds. The perennial weeds 
were the same species as those 
found growing in small amounts 
within 
the protected exclosures. 
Annual weeds, which were found 
only in trace amounts within the 
exclosures, occurred in much great- 
er abundance on the more heavily 
grazed areas. 
The dominant bunchgrass species 
normally grew best within the for- 
est openings of the exclosures, the 
maximum bunchgrass density hav- 
ing occurred under a forest canopy 
of less than one percent. Since the 
forest openings were most attrac- 
tive to livestock, the greatest loss 
in bunchgrass density under graz- 
ing occurred under a canopy of 
less than one percent. The •nore 
resistant grasses and weeds which 
occurred in subordinate quantities 
within 
the exclosures became more 
prominent with the loss of the 
bunchgrass dominants on 
the 
grazed areas. Weeds' prevailed 
wkere even the grazing resistant 
grasses suffered losses on the most 
JOURNAL OF •q•ORESTR¾ 
severely grazed and trampled open- 
ings. Unpalatable species and 
weeds, such as pussytoes and sand- 
worts, possessed 
a particularly effi- 
cient faculty for withstanding 
heavy grazing abuse. The prostrate 
mats and flattened rosettes of these 
two weeds inhabited large-sized 
areas in the forest openings where 
concentrated grazing use had seri- 
ously reduced the perennial grass 
population (Fig. 6). Annuals ap- 
peared most abundantly on local 
areas where both the perennial 
grasses and weeds suffered almost 
complete elimination. 
Although the greatest grass den- 
sity occurred in treeless openings 
within the protected exclosures, a 
reversal was found on overgrazed 
areas. On excessively 
grazed ranges 
the openings between the trees com- 
pletely lacked a perennial grass 
cover. Re•nnants of the perennial 
grasses, particularly the bunch- 
grass species, grew only under the 
trees as isolated "islands" sepa- 
rated by deteriorated openings. 
Grass "islands" 
were observed on 
the excessively grazed and tram- 
pled ranges in the immediate vi-. 
cinity of the exclosures at Fry 
Park, Rogers Lake, and Black 
Springs. The scattered trees of 
these areas provided the perennial 
grasses with 
some protection 
against grazing. This accounts for 
the fact that the highest bunch- 
grass densities occurred under the 
canopy intercepts of 75 to 90 per- 
cent on the grazed areas (Fig. 6). 
Judging Range Condition 
The decline of forage occasioned 
by the influx of young pine stands 
creates an important problem in 
judging range condition and trend, 
since loss of forage production is 
frequently used as an indicator of 
range deterioration. In judging the 
condition of timbered ranges one 
must discriminate between forage. 
losses attributable to improper 
grazing and forage losses resulting 
from pin e regeneration. 
Declines in forage production 
due to improper livestock manage-- 
ment are accompanied by definite 
changes in herbaceous composition. 
Based on the results of this inves- 
tigation, stages of unsatisfactory 
range 
condition 
are 
indicated 
where the herbaceous composition_ 

FEBRVAR¾ 1950 
125 
shows (1) a scarcity of bunchgrass 
species; (2) 
a replacement of 
bunchgrass species with perennial 
grasses that escape or withstand a 
high degree of grazing abuse; (3) 
a marked replacement of all peren- 
nial grass species by perennial 
weeds; (4) an abundance of annu- 
als; and (5) the survival of rem- 
nant bunchgrass "islands" under 
scattered 
trees. 
Declines kn forage production 
which result from the reestablish- 
ment of .pine stands are not at- 
tended by marked changes in her- 
baceous composition. The compo- 
nent species of the herbaceous cov- 
er all decline in response to timber 
dominance. 
Herbaceous decline as 
caused by pine stands will in time 
encourage improper grazing use 
and thus bring about discernible 
changes in plant composition. A 
periodic check of timber stands by 
size classes may be necessary to 
anticipate a forage decline. 
Standards for judging the condi- 
tion of timbered ranges are subject 
to misinterpretation when they are 
based strictly upon forage produc- 
tion. Based upon production alone, 
no distinction can be made between 
the loss of forage production oc- 
casioned 
by the increase in pine 
stands and forage losses due to im- 
proper grazing. Standards based 
upon successional 
stages of herba- 
ceous composition do indicate when 
a loss in forage •production is at- 
tributal to improper grazing prac- 
tices. Since dominance and sub- 
ordination play an important role 
in plant succession, condition 
standards should provide some 
means of evaluating the timber 
overstory as well as the herbaceons 
cover. 
Significance of Results 
The complexity of rang• manage- 
ment in northern Arizona has been 
greatly increased wherever exten- 
sive pine regeneration has caused 
a marked decline in forage yields. 
The adjustment of animal numbers 
to the available forage is an essen- 
tial measure, but it does not offer 
a complete solution to management 
problems. Proper stocking requires 
the support of other management 
practices to provide more efficient 
use and to help stabilize the forage 
resource of timbered ranges. To 
compensate for the forage decline 
caused by young pine stands the 
range manager must first concen- 
trate on increasing the production 
of depleted grassland openings. 
Restoration 
of 
abandoned 
home- 
steads and parks and meadows that 
have been seriously damaged by 
overgrazing and trampling may be 
accomplished by a more widespread 
application of such measures as (1) 
fencing, (2) reseeding, (3) rota- 
tion grazing, and (4) the installa- 
tion of water retaining devices. To 
supplement these practices, the 
beneficial effect of logging release 
should be investigated as an addi- 
tional possibility of stabilizing the 
forage resource of timbered ranges. 
In a well integrated land use pro- 
gram, short cutting cycles should 
sustain yields of both timber and 
forage without sacrificing tree dom- 
inance. 
In addition to causing an actual 
decline in forage production, ex- 
tensive stands of young pines have 
also increased the uneven distribu- 
tion of livestock (3). Being isolated 
by surrounding timber stands, the 
forage in many small forest open- 
ings is not easily accessible to live- 
stock. Small isolated openings' re- 
ceiving little or no grazing use may 
be located near large parks which 
are suffering serious grazing dam- 
age. To correct this uneven distri- 
bution, proper stocking requires 
(1) the proper location of salt, (2) 
riding, (3) an adequate distribu- 
tion of watering places, and (4) 
a fencing plan which would favor 
a rotation system of grazing be- 
tween the large grassland openings 
and the more lightly used timbered 
ranges. 
Summary 
1. During the past fifty years, 
impressive changes have occurred 
in the herbaceous plant cover in 
the ponderosa pine forests sur- 
rounding Flagstaff and Williams in 
northern Arizona. Early land use 
practices, such as heavy logging 
and excessive grazing followed by 
a widespread 
establishment of 
young pine stands, were larget•y re- 
sponsible for these changes. In re- 
cent years young pine stands, par- 
ticularly of the 1919 seedling crop, 
have encompassed many natural 
grassland parks, restocked many of 
the early cut-over areas, and fil- 
tered into virgin stands. 
2. Changes in the herbaceous 
cover were determined by quadrat 
and transect records collected from 
five exclosures representing the 
pine-bunchgrass 
range type. The 
five exclosures, located within a 15- 
mile radius of Flagstaff at eleva- 
tions ranging from 6,700 to 8,200 
feet, were fenced in 1912. 
3. The decline in grass density 
as affected by young pines of the 
1919 seedling crop was clearly in- 
dicated by the comparison of two 
groups of 
protected quadrats, 
charted intermittently since 1912. 
The 1919 seedling pines gained 
dominance over the grass cover 
after only five years. Initial domi- 
nance was largely achieved by 
overcoming the herbaceous root 
competition for soil moisture. By 
1941, the growth of the young pines 
had reduced the grass density ap- 
proximately 25 percent below that 
of 1912. This reduction was shared 
by all grass species. 
4. Herbaceous density and har- 
vested grass yields declined with 
increasing amounts of pine canopy. 
Under protection the grass yields 
showed a fairly constant relati. on- 
ship to the total herbaceous density 
under the even-aged pine stands of 
the 1919 seedling crop. 
5. The herbaceous composition 
of the five exclosures appeared to 
have reached a high degree of sta- 
bilization by 1941 as a result of 29 
years of protection against grazing. 
Stabilization was indicated by (1) 
herbaceous composition dominated 
by the tall bunchgrass species; (2) 
grazing resistant species occurred 
in minor amounts; (3) perennial 
weeds occupied a small portion of 
the herbaceous composition; and 
(4) annuals occurred in small 
amounts. 
The total herbaceous den- 
sity decreased under fincreasing 
amounts of the forest canopy. 
6. The relationship between her- 
baceous density and the uneven- 
aged forest canopy differed mark- 
edly between grazed and ungrazed 
areas. The highly sensitive bunch- 
'grass species suffered the greatest 
losses within the heavily grazed 
forest openings and under the 
lighter amounts of pine canopy. 
Grass species that were more resist- 
ant to grazing damage occupied a

greater density on the grazed 
areas. 
Perennial 
weeds and annu- 
als occurred in greater abundance 
where heavy grazing had reduced 
all perennial grass species. 
7. The results of this investiga- 
tion provide some basic principles 
for judging the condition of tim- 
bered ranges in northern Arizona. 
Loss in forage production due to 
the influx of young pine stands is 
accompanied by no striking changes 
in herbaceous composition. Loss in 
forage production occasioned by 
improper livestock grazing consti- 
tutes an unsatisfactory range con- 
dition which may be recognized by 
(1) a scarcity of bunchgrass spe- 
cies, (2) an abundance of grasses 
that are highly resistant to grazing 
damage, (3) an abundance of per- 
ennial weeds, (4) an abundance of 
annuals, and (5) surviving "is- 
lands" of bunchgrass remnants un- 
der scattered 
trees. 
8. Although highly important, 
proper stocking alone does not offer 
a complete solution to the range 
problems of timbered ranges, as the 
animal numbers are merely ad- 
justed to the declining forage re- 
source. To stabilize the declining 
forage resource, proper stocking 
should be adequately supported 
with such practices as (1) fencing, 
(2) reseeding, (3) rotation graz- 
ing, (4) the installation of water 
retaining devices. Since uneven 
livestock 
distribution 
has 
been 
greatly magnified by the increase 
of young pine stands, proper stock- 
ing needs to be supplemented with 
a more widespread application of 
such practices as (1) proper salt- 
ing, (2) riding, (3) a more ade- 
quate distribution of water, and 
(4) a fencing plan which would 
provide better control over live~ 
stock movements 
and distribution.
