Summary
Low-elevation ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa
Dougl. ex. Laws.) forests of the northern Rocky Mountainshis-
torically experienced frequent low-intensity fires that main-
tained open uneven-aged stands. A century of fire exclusion
has contributed to denser ponderosa pine forests with greater
competition for resources, higher tree stress and greater risk of
insect attack and stand-destroying fire. Active management in-
tended to restore a semblance of the more sustainable historic
stand structure and composition includes selective thinning
and prescribed fire. However, little is known about the relative
effects of these management practices on the physiological
performance of ponderosa pine. We measured soil water and
nitrogen availability, physiological performance and wood ra-
dial increment of second growth ponderosa pine trees at the
Lick Creek Experimental Site in the Bitterroot National Forest,
Montana, 8 and 9 years after the application of four treatments:
thinning only; thinning followed by prescribed fire in the
spring; thinning followed by prescribed fire in the fall; and un-
treated controls. Volumetric soil water content and resin cap-
suleammonium did not differ amongtreatments.Resincapsule
nitrate in the control treatment was similar to that in all other
treatments, although burned treatments had lower nitrate rela-
tive to the thinned-only treatment. Trees of similar size and
canopy condition in the three thinned treatments (with and
without fire) displayed higher leaf-area-based photosynthetic
rate, stomatal conductance and mid-morning leaf water poten-
tial in June and July, and higher wood radial increment relative
to trees in control units. Specific leaf area, mass-based leaf ni-
trogen content and carbon isotope discrimination did not vary
among treatments. Our results suggest that, despite minimal
differences in soil resource availability, trees in managed units
where basal area was reduced had improved gas exchange and
growth compared with trees in unmanaged units. Prescribed
fire (either in the spring or in the fall) in addition to thinning,
had no measurable effect on the mid-term physiological per-
formance andwoodgrowthof secondgrowthponderosapine.

Introduction
Pure and mixed stands of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa
Dougl. ex. Laws.) cover millions of hectares across the north-
ern Rocky Mountains (Van Hooser and Keegan 1988). Histori-
cally, ponderosa pine forests dominated much of this region
where frequent (typically 5–25 year intervals), low-intensity
surface fires maintained open, sustainable and biologically di-
verse stands (Martin 1982, Arno 1988). Euro-American settle-
ment in western North America was followed by a decrease in
fire frequency in most ponderosa pine forests. In the past cen-
tury, in particular, reduced indigenous burning (Barrett and
Arno 1982), active suppression of lightning and human-
caused fires, reduction of flammable fine fuel cover by grazing
(Savage and Swetnam 1990) and new barriers to wildfire
spread due to human-induced ecosystem fragmentation (Arno
1988) have contributed to dramatic changes in ponderosa pine
forests (Covington and Moore 1994). In the northern Rocky
Mountains, these changes have resulted in the dominance of
second growth stands with higher tree density, greater living
and dead biomass and altered species composition relative to
historic conditions (Hartwell et al. 2000). These stands experi-
ence greater competition for resources and greater risk of
pathogen outbreaks, insect attack and stand-replacing fires
(Feeney et al. 1998, Keane et al. 2002). Because of these nega-
tive effects, there is increasing use of prescribed fire and thin-
ning to partially restore historic conditions (Arno et al. 1995,
Powers and Reynolds 2000).
Numerous studies have examined the effects of thinning
and prescribed fire on tree growth, mortality and recruit-
ment, as well as on changes in nutrient cycles and under-
story vegetation structure and function in ponderosa pine
ecosystems (e.g., Arno et al. 1996, Monleon et al. 1997,
Kaye and Hart 1998, Busse et al. 2000). Little is known,
however, about the mid- (8–20 years) and longer-term ef-
fects of thinning and prescribed fire on the physiological
performance of second growth ponderosa pine.
Ponderosa pine physiology is sensitive to stand structure
(Nagel and O’Hara 2002) and has been shown to respond posi-
tively to reductions of basal area (Kolb et al. 1998, McDowell

et al. 2003) and the use of low-severity prescribed fire. In
the short term (1–3 years), thinning alone or thinning fol-
lowed by burning has resulted in increased soil water avail-
ability and improved physiological performance of second
growth (Skov et al. 2004) and old growth (Feeney et al.
1998) ponderosa pine. However, longer-term (> 5 years)
effects on ponderosa pine of thinning followed by pre-
scribed fire relative to thinning alone are unknown.
A possible mechanism for mid- to long-term effects of fire
on ponderosa pine is through nutrient cycling. Fire exclusion
in low-elevation ponderosa pine systems may have negative
consequences on nitrogen cycles, with the accumulation of
large stores of organic nitrogen (Covington and Sacket 1984,
Wright and Hart 1997, DeLuca 2000). Several studies have
shown temporary increases in mineral soil nitrogen concentra-
tion after fire (Kovacic et al. 1986, White 1986, Covington
and Sackett 1984, 1992, Monleon et al. 1997, DeLuca and
Zouhar 2000). However, this effect does not appear to per-
sist, and it has been shown that, within 1 to 2 years after the
fire, several indices of nitrogen availability and transforma-
tion rates begin to decline with time (Monleon et al. 1997,
DeLuca and Zouhar 2000). Because leaf nitrogen content
directly impacts leaf properties and photosynthetic capac-
ity (Reich et al. 1997), direct and indirect effects of differ-
ent management practices on soil nitrogen availability may
have lasting consequences for the physiological perfor-
mance of ponderosa pine.
Historically, ponderosa pine forests of the northern Rocky
Mountains typically burned during the late summer and early
fall (Agee 1993). However, much prescribed burning in the
northern Rocky Mountains is conducted during the spring,
when conditions are cooler and wetter, to reduce burn severity
and improve smoke dispersal. Prescribed burning in spring, a
period of high physiological activity, has been shown to reduce
fine root biomass of ponderosa pines when large amounts of
biomass were consumed (Grier 1989), and to reduce growth
rates and increase mortality relative to unburned trees (Swezy
and Agee 1991, Landsberg 1994, Busse et al. 2000). In con-
trast, Wyant et al. (1983) reported positive growth responses to
prescribed burning in the fall and Feeney et al. (1998) found no
negative effects of fall burning in previously thinned stands.
However, no studies to date have directly compared responses
to spring and fall burning.
Here, we examined mid-term (8 and 9 years post-treatment)
effects of three treatments on physiological performance and
growth in a western Montana ponderosa pine forest. We com-
pared soil resource availability, tree physiological perfor-
mance and wood radial increment after the implementation of
four management practices: stand thinning followed by pre-
scribed burning in the spring, prescribed burning in the fall, or
no burning; and untreated control. Specifically, we addressed
the following questions: (1) How do thinning and prescribed
fire treatments affect mid-term ponderosa pine physiological
performance relative to untreated controls? (2) Are there dif-
ferences in mid-term ponderosa pine performance among
stands receiving thinning only, thinning followed by spring
fire and thinning followed by fall fire?
Materials and methods
Study site and treatments
The study area is located in the Lick Creek Experimental Site
in the Bitterroot National Forest of western Montana (46°5′ N,
114°15′ W). The site is semi-arid, with approximately 500 mm
mean annual precipitation, about half of which falls as snow
(Gruell et al. 1982). The study was conducted on a stand occu-
pying a moderately steep (15°), south-facing slope (elevation
approximately 1500 m) that has been actively managed for
about 90 years. The site is dominated by ponderosa pines
about 70 years of age, which arose after selective cutting. A
small portion of the remaining trees were Douglas-fir (Pseu-
dotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Beissn.) Franco). The original
stand of old ponderosa pine was selectively harvested around
1909 and again in the 1950s. The stand was pre-commercially
thinned in the 1960s and slash was left untreated. Trees re-
sponded rapidly to the thinning treatment, with substantial in-
creases in diameter growth (Arno 1999).
In 1991, twelve study units, approximately 3–4 ha each,
were established adjacent to each other in a research design of
four treatments with three replicates. Nine units received a
stand density reduction treatment and three units located im-
mediately upslope were left unthinned to serve as controls.
Such non-random assignment of control units was necessary
to minimize fire hazard. Three of the nine thinned units re-
ceived one of the three prescribed fire treatments, assigned
randomly: spring burn, fall burn or no burn. In this paper, we
use the term “treated unit” to distinguish the thinned units
from the untreated control units. The following terminology is
used to designate the three types of treated unit: thinning only
= “thin-only”; thinning followed by prescribed fire in the
spring, under wet conditions = “spring-burn”; thinning fol-
lowed by prescribed fire in the fall, under dry conditions =
“fall-burn.” Within each of the twelve units, twelve 0.04-ha
circular plots were laid out systematically (33 m apart) for
sampling of stand characteristics, soil resource availability and
tree response.
Treatments were initiated in 1992, when all thinning units
were commercially thinned to reduce Douglas-fir of all sizes
and remove smaller ponderosa pine, with the objectives of re-
ducing competition and the potential for crown fire for the re-
maining pines (Harrington 1999a). Only merchantable trees
(20–30 cm in diameter 1.4 m above ground) were removed
and some of the slash was left on the site. Basal area (m2 wood
ha–1) was reduced from a preharvest mean of approximately
21 m2 ha–1, 93% of which was ponderosa pine, to approxi-
mately 14 m2 ha–1, 98% of which was ponderosa pine. Stand
density was reduced from 420 trees ha–1 to 280 trees ha–1,
leaving a fairly uniform distribution of trees. The fall-burn
units were burned in either September or October of 1993,
when buds were set and radial growth was complete. The
spring-burn sites were burned on two consecutive days in May
1994, when buds were expanding. To avoid high midday tem-
peratures, fires were applied during the early morning when
temperatures were between 10 and 23 °C, humidity was be-
tween 35 and 75% and wind speed was less than 8 km h–1, us-
ing strip head fires. Fuel loads were generally light, and a

significant fraction of litter and much of the woody debris (in-
cluding slash) were consumed in both the spring and fall
burns, with greater woody and forest floor reduction in fall
burn units (mean pre-fire forest floor consumption of 41 and
70%, respectively). Fuel moisture contents were generally
higher in the spring, with the exception of litter, which had
higher moisture content in the fall due to cool mornings with
high relative humidity (Harrington 1999b). About 60% of
standing trees between 2 and 18 cm DBH were killed in both
the fall and the spring burn, mostly as a result of crown scorch
(Harrington 1999a). Only 3% of trees greater than 18 cm DBH
(the majority smaller than 25 cm DBH) were dead 4 years after
either the spring or fall burn.
Stand characteristics
Leaf area index (LAI), calculated as projected needle area di-
vided by ground area, was measured at the end of the 2001
growing season with a Li-Cor 2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer
(Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE) at ten plot centers selected at random
from the twelve in each unit. Basal area was measured at the
end of summer 2001 in six plots per unit using a variable-ra-
dius basal area prism with 10× conversion factor (Shiver and
Borders 1996). For each unit, leaf area: cross-section bole area
at breast height was calculated as LAI divided by basal area to
assess whether treatments influenced the relative proportion of
foliage to wood.
Soil resources
On June 25, 2001, mineral soil was sampled in six plots se-
lected at random from the twelve units, and analyzed for ni-
trate and ammonium. Five soil cores per plot (distributed at
1-m intervals along the slope, starting 1 m south of the plot
center) were removed with a soil probe to a depth of 10 cm be-
neath the surface of mineral soil. The five samples from each
plot were combined. A 30-g subsample was oven-dried at
105 ºC for 72 h to calculate soil water content. Ammonium and
nitrate were extracted by placing 30 g of fresh mineral soil in
50 ml of 2 M KCl, shaking for 30 min, and filtering the extracts
through Whatman 42 ash-free filter paper on a vacuum extrac-
tion manifold. Extracts were analyzed for ammonium follow-
ing the Berthelot reaction method (Willis et al. 1993) and for
nitrate by nitration of salycilate as described by Yang et al.
(1998). All nitrate and ammonium concentration values were
corrected for water content and reported on a dry mass basis.
Anaerobically mineralizable nitrogen (AMN; Binkley and
Hart 1989) was measured from each composite sample per
plot as an estimate of potentially available nitrogen. Ten ml of
deionized water was added to 5.0 g of moist field soil in a
50-ml centrifuge tube. Dinitrogen gas was added to the head-
space, the tubes sealed and incubated at 25 °C for 14 days to al-
low for microbial conversion of mineralizable nitrogen to
ammonium without subsequent formation of nitrate. After the
incubation period, 10 ml of 4 M KCl was added to each tube,
the contents shaken for 30 min and the extracts then filtered
through Whatman 42 ash-free filter paper on a vacuum extrac-
tion manifold. Ammonium was analyzed as described above
and expressed on a soil dry mass basis. The initial concentra-
tion of ammonium was subtracted from this value to yield an
estimate of AMN.
Time-integrated nitrate and ammonium availability was as-
sessed by the resin capsule method, whereby ionic resin cap-
sules buried in the mineral soil absorb nitrate and ammonium
moving through by mass flow (Binkley 1984). On June 18,
2001, ionic resin capsules (Unibest, Bozeman, MT) were in-
stalled in 10 plots per unit at 10 cm beneath the surface of the
mineral soil. Resin capsules were inserted into the soil by cre-
ating a 2.5-cm-diameter hole at a 45° angle to the soil surface
with a stainless steel soil probe. Capsules were removed on
August 6, returned to the laboratory and brushed clean of min-
eral soil. Nitrate and ammonium were extracted from the resin
capsules with three successive, 30-min, agitated rinses of
10 ml of 2 M KCl (Kjønaas 1999, Morse et al. 2000). The col-
lected total of 30 ml of KCl extract was centrifuged at 1000 g
for 10 min, and the supernatant analyzed for nitrate and am-
monium, as described above.
Volumetric percent soil water was measured periodically
with a frequency domain reflectometry probe (Sentry 200
Troxler, Research Triangle Park, NC) throughout the summers
of 2001 and 2002. The probe (approximately 40 cm long and
5 cm in diameter) has an active band that measures the sur-
rounding soil water in a cylinder approximately 10 cm long
and 25 cm in diameter. This is placed at each required soil
depth by inserting the probe into a pre-installed and emptied
PVC pipe (60 cm long × 5 cm in diameter), which was capped
between measurements. Soil water measurements were taken
in six plots per unit at 5–15, 20–30 and 35–45 cm depths be-
neath the surface of the mineral soil.
Tree response
Trees for sampling were selected based on the following 1994
post-treatment measurements: DBH between 25–31 cm; a
crown ratio (the proportion of tree height with live foliage) be-
tween 60 and 70%; and crown scorch (the percentage of crown
length with foliage killed by fire) between 10 and 20% in
burned units. These criteria represented the dominant size
class, mean crown ratio and mean fire damage in burned units.
From among these trees, six were selected at random for sam-
pling in each unit, with no two trees selected in the same
0.04-ha plot. All six trees per unit were assessed for foliar mor-
phology and chemistry, and three trees were randomly se-
lected for the measurements of gas exchange and needle xylem
water potential (Ψ).
Projected leaf area-based photosynthesis (Aarea) and Ψ of
1-year-old needles were measured over four periods through-
out the 2001 season (two in July and two in August), as fol-
lows. During each period, measurements were taken over the
course of three consecutive days such that trees from one unit
per treatment were measured each day. On each day, measure-
ments were taken between 0830 h and 1300 h in three consecu-
tive sets, each including one tree per unit. Although such
stratified sampling (1 tree per treatment per set × 4 treatments
× 3 sets per day × 3 days = 36 trees) unavoidably encompassed
large variability, it prevented treatment bias due to variation in
environmental conditions on a given day and during a given
time period.
We used telescoping pruners to harvest sunlit branchlets

from the mid-canopy on the south side of each tree. Immedi-
ately after harvest, several 1-year-old fascicles were removed
from the branch and placed in a sealed plastic bag with a damp
paper towel and transported in a portable cooler to a central
work station for measurement of Ψ within 15 min. Xylem wa-
ter potential was measured from the fascicular portion of one
needle per tree with a pressure chamber (PMS Instruments,
Corvallis, OR). The branchlet was also transported to the work
station for concurrent gas exchange measurements. Projected
leaf area-based photosynthesis (Aarea) and stomatal conduc-
tance (gs) were measured with a Li-Cor 6400 Photosynthesis
System for three fascicles (nine needles) from each tree at each
sampling time. For all gas exchange measurements, humidity
was held near ambient; photosynthetically active radiation
(PAR: 400–700 nm) was above saturation (Kolb and Rob-
berecht 1996) at 1000 µmol m–2 s–1 from an external light
source; and carbon dioxide concentration was controlled at
400 µmol mol–1.
Additional gas exchange measurements were conducted on
July 8–10, 2002, to explore the relationship between needle
age and Aarea. We measured Aarea for 1-, 3-, 5- and 6–7-year- old
foliage from the same trees that were sampled with the same
protocol in 2001. To corroborate findings from 2001, we also
measured predawn water potential (Ψpredawn) of the same trees
during two sampling periods in 2002 (June 17–19 and July
29–31).
At the end of the growing season, we harvested terminal,
mid-canopy branchlets from all six selected trees per unit for
analysis of foliar morphology, longevity and chemistry. Spe-
cific leaf area (SLA) was measured as projected leaf area
(measured with an image analysis system; Moccha, Jandel
Scientific, San Rafael, CA) divided by dry mass of 20
1-year-old needles per tree. After oven-drying (60 °C) each
needle cohort separately, we calculated the total foliage mass
as well as the percentage of total branch foliage represented by
the three youngest years of needles as an index of relative in-
vestment in younger needles. One-year-old needles were
ground to a fine powder (< 0.2 mm mesh), weighed to the near-
est µg, sealed in small tin capsules and shipped to the Univer-
sity of Georgia (Atlanta, GA) for chemical analysis. Whole-
leaf tissue chemistry measurements included leaf mass-based
nitrogen concentration (Nmass) and stable carbon isotope ratio
(δ13Cplant) (Ehleringer and Osmond 1989). Carbon isotope ra-
tio (δ13Cplant) was analyzed relative to the Vienna PeeDee-Bel-
emnite standard and expressed as discrimination (∆) following
Farquhar and Richards (1984), where ∆= (δ13Cair – δ13Cplant),
and δ13Cair was assumed to be –8‰.
All six selected trees per unit were cored with an increment
borer at 1.4 m above ground on the west side. We recorded to-
tal xylem width (to the nearest 0.01 mm), total width of the
nine tree rings since thinning in 1992 and total width of the
preceding nine growth rings. We calculated the ratio of the
wood area at breast height produced since treatment to the area
produced during the same number of growing seasons before
treatment (radial wood increment ratio). Because there was a
year of growth between thinning and burning treatments, ra-
tios for burning treatments include an initial growing season
when only thinning had been applied.
Data analysis
All plot-level measurements were considered subsamples and
the unit means were considered true replicates (n = 3 per treat-
ment). Most data were analyzed by one-way analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA) with treatment as a factor (4 levels). Multiple
mean comparisons were made by Least Significant Difference
(LSD) posteriori tests. One-way (treatment) repeated mea-
sured ANOVA was used for physiological measurements con-
ducted throughout the season. Photosynthesis measurements
in 2002 were analyzed with a two-way (treatment and needle
age) ANOVA (α = 0.05). With the exception of radial wood in-
crements, all data met assumptions of normality (Kolmo-
gorov-Smirnov tests) and homogeneity of variance (Levene’s
test). Unit means of radial wood increment ratio were inversed
to meet assumptions of normality and homogeneity of vari-
ance.

among thin-only, spring-burn and fall-burn units (Table 1).
Basal area was higher in control units relative to treated units
(F = 10.89, P < 0.001), with no differences among treated units
(Table 1). The mean proportion of leaf area to cross-sectional
bole area did not differ significantly among treatments (839,
1192, 1336 and 1138 m2 m–2 in control, thin-only, spring-burn
and fall-burn units, respectively; P > 0.05).
Resource availability
Ammonium pool sizes in June 2001 were significantly lower
in control units than in all treated units (F = 4.33, P < 0.05; Ta-
ble 2). June 2001 nitrate pool sizes and AMN did not differ
among treatments (Table 2). In contrast to pool sizes, time-in-
tegrated ammonium availability measured with resin capsules
did not differ among treatments (Table 2). Mean nitrate avail-
ability (resin capsule data) was similar in control units relative
to other treatments, but lower in burned units relative to thin-
only units (F = 6.98, P < 0.05; Table 2).
Soil water content (% soil volume) was not significantly dif-
ferent among treatments throughout either the 2001 or 2002
growing season at any of the three sampling depths (Figure 1).
Soil water at all depths declined throughout the 2001 and 2002
summer seasons with the exception of a temporary increase in
early August 2001 following localized, short intense rains.
Values increased at all depths in 2001 with the onset of fall
rains.
Tree response
Photosynthetic rates and gs declined significantly (F = 19.2,
Pdate < 0.01, and F = 8.50, Pdate < 0.05, respectively) throughout
the 2001 growing season (Figure 2). When all dates were con-
sidered, Aarea and gs tended to be lower in the control trees rela-
tive to trees in other treatments but differences were not signif-
icant at α = 0.05 (F = 3.39, Ptreatment < 0.1, and F = 3.26, Ptreatment
< 0.1, respectively; Figure 2). When only June and July dates
were considered, both Aarea and gs were significantly lower in
control trees relative to trees in other treatments (F = 3.91;
Ptreatment = 0.05, and F = 5.5; Ptreatment = 0.02, respectively). The
treatment × date interaction was not significant for Aarea but
was significant for gs (F = 4.81, P < 0.05). In July 2002, we

found no evidence for a treatment effect on needle- age-related
differences in Aarea (Figure 3). Although older needles showed
significantly lower Aarea than younger needles (F = 16.45, Page
< 0.001), neither treatment nor the treatment × age interaction
were significant.
Needle xylem water potential values were not significantly
different among treatments for any sampling date through the
2001 summer (data not shown). Regardless of treatment, Ψ de-
clined to values close to –2.0 MPa as the air warmed and dried
during the day. Because of the strong decrease toward constant
values, early morning Ψ (2001) and Ψpredawn (2002) were used
as indicators of whole-tree water stress. Therefore, 2001 Ψ
data were reexamined after removing data collected after
1000 h, when trees began reaching constant Ψ values near –2.0
MPa. Early morning water potential declined significantly
during the summer (F = 19.07, Pdate < 0.01). Overall, control
trees had significantly lower early morning Ψ values than trees
in treated stands (F = 5.14, Ptreatment < 0.05; Figure 4). The
treatment × date interaction was not significant (F = 3.40,
P > 0.05). Predawn Ψ also declined significantly during sum-
mer 2002 (F = 303.83, Pdate < 0.001). The treatment (F =
15.83, P < 0.01) and treatment × date interaction (F = 13.64,
P < 0.05) effects were significant, because of similar values in
June but large differences in July, when Ψ was lower in control
units.
Total terminal branch foliage dry mass did not differ signifi-
cantly among treatments (Table 1). Control trees had a signifi-
cantly lower (F = 7.217, P < 0.05) proportion of young (1- to
3-year-old) foliage than trees in all other treatments (Table 1).
Foliar nitrogen concentration (Nmass), foliar carbon isotope dis-
crimination (∆) and specific leaf area (SLA) did not differ
among treatments (Table 1).
The radial wood increment ratio was close to 1 in the control
treatment, but increased significantly (F = 10.64; P < 0.01) in
all other treatments, with no differences among them (Fig-
ure 5).
Discussion
Results from this study in western Montana show improved
gas exchange, water status and growth of second growth pon-
derosa pine 9 years after thinning and 8 years after thinning
followed by prescribed burning, relative to untreated controls,
notwithstanding that most indices of soil resource availability
were similar among treatments. Our results also show that, in
the mid-term, thinning and thinning followed by prescribed
burning in either spring or fall had similar effects on tree phys-
iological responses and radial wood growth.
Fire and thinning have been shown to cause substantial,
short-term increases (up to 1 year) in inorganic nitrogen pools
(Kovacic et al. 1986, White 1986, Covington and Sackett
1992, Monleon et al. 1997, DeLuca and Zouhar 2000) and
transformation rates in the mineral soil of ponderosa pine sys-
tems (Kaye and Hart 1998–but see Monleon et al. 1997). How-
ever, such pulses are usually temporary, and within 1 to 2 years

tentially mineralizable nitrogen (DeLuca and Zouhar 2000)
return to or fall below pretreatment values. Our results show
that, although an initial pulse of available nitrogen may have
occurred immediately after treatment at our site, it was unde-
tectable 8 or 9 years after treatment. This was supported by the
similar resin capsule nitrate and ammonium values among
each of the treatments and the control. Similar AMN among
treatments also suggests that the amount of stored nitrogen in
the soil available for mineralization was similar among the
treatments. Consistent with soil data, leaf-level nitrogen con-
centration (Narea) was similar among treatments. Similar pro-
portion of foliage area relative to bole cross section among
treatments suggests that similar Narea did not result from dilu-
tion in treated units relative to control. While soil nitrate pool
sizes were similar in all treatments, we found higher soil am-
monium pool sizes in all treated units relative to controls based
on a single sampling in June. However, pool sizes are ex-
tremely variable over time (Monleon et al. 1997, Wright and
Hart 1997) and may be smaller than the fluxes themselves
(Stark and Hart 1997). Therefore, it is not surprising that pool
size differences at one time do not correspond with time-inte-
grated results. We also found lower nitrate availability in
burned units (based on resin capsules) relative to thin-only
units, but not to controls. Similar values in burned and controls
suggest that differences between burned and thin-only units
are not due to fire alone. Apparently, such differences were not
related to understory cover and composition either, because
preliminary surveys revealed no differences between thinned-
only and burned units (Peters 2002). Additional measurements
of nitrogen cycling components and turnover rates would be
necessary to corroborate these differences and explain poten-
tial mechanisms.
The lack of treatment differences in soil water content dur-
ing the summers of 2001 and 2002 and the nearly identical re-
sponse in all treatments to both precipitation and drought
suggests that treatment did not affect soil water content. How-
ever, lower early morning water potential and stomatal con-
ductance in July 2001 (prior to late July rains) and lower
predawn water potential in July 2002 in control units indicate
that trees in these units were more water-limited than trees in
treated units. Several explanations for these results are possi-
ble. First, volumetric soil water measurements may not accu-
rately reflect soil water potential throughout the rooting zone
in each treatment. Second, lower basal area and tree density in
treated units may result in greater water availability per tree
and lower water stress. Higher overall conductance from roots
to leaves in trees from treated units (i.e., due to an increase of
fine roots or conductance of wood produced after treatment)
could also result in lower water stress despite similar soil water

content (Tyree and Zimmermann 2002).
Although differences among treatments in soil resource
availability and leaf nitrogen content were minimal, Aarea and
gsin June and July, early morning Ψ, Ψpredawn and proportion of
foliage allocated to younger needles were higher in all treated
units relative to the control units. These findings indicate that,
8 and 9 years after treatment, physiological activity of ponder-
osa pine at the study site was improved to a similar degree by
either thinning or thinning followed by fire. Comparable re-
sults have been obtained in second growth (Skov et al. 2004)
and old growth ponderosa pine in western Montana (A. Sala,
unpublished data) and in northern Arizona (Feeney et al. 1998,
Skov et al. 2004). Decreases in net photosynthetic rates with
increasing needle age measured in 2002 (see also Clark et al.
1995) suggest that control trees did not compensate for lower
relative Aarea in young needles with increased Aarea in older nee-
dles. Taken together, our gas exchange and leaf biomass re-
sults suggest higher branch-level carbon assimilation in trees
from treated units relative to controls. This is consistent with
significantly higher radial wood increment measured in
treated units.
Lower Aarea in June and July for trees in control units com-
pared with treated units was unrelated to decreases in SLA,
Nmass or Narea (not shown). This is in contrast to well-docu-
mented correlations between SLA or Narea and leaf area-based
photosynthetic capacity across and within species (Reich et al.
1997, Carey et al. 1998). The lack of such correlation in our
study may indicate that lower photosynthesis in control units
was not due to reduced photosynthetic capacity, but rather to
increased stomatal limitations to gas exchange. Consistent
with this, McDowell et al. (2003) found that photosynthetic
capacity of ponderosa pine did not change in response to thin-
ning treatments. Furthermore, ponderosa pine is among the
temperate conifers most vulnerable to water-stress-induced
xylem cavitation (Piñol and Sala 2000, Martínez-Vilalta et al.
2004) and strong stomatal closure in response to environmen-
tal and soil drought (Zhang et al. 1997, Kolb and Stone 2000,
Olivas-Garcia et al. 2000, Law et al. 2001, Marshall et al.
2001, Panek and Goldstein 2001, Stout and Sala 2003) pre-
vents xylem water potential from reaching critical values that
induce xylem cavitation. This strong stomatal control is con-
sistent with the high sensitivity of photosynthesis to leaf water
status (Zhang et al. 1997, Dang et al. 1997, Kolb and Stone
2000, Panek and Goldstein 2001). In our study, rapid de-
creases of needle water potential during the day to similar val-
ues in all treatments and relatively high absolute minimum leaf
water potential values (–2.2 MPa) measured at the site are con-
sistent with high drought sensitivity in ponderosa pine. Lower
predawn and early morning water potentials in control units
relative to all other treatments were likely responsible for
greater stomatal closure and lower photosynthetic rates in con-
trol trees. Most likely, the CO2 concentration we maintained in
the chamber during measurements (400 µl l–1) was too low to
prevent water-stress-induced stomatal limitations to CO2 dif-
fusion in control trees.
We found no differences in leaf carbon isotope discrimina-
tion among treatments. Similar results were reported by Skov
et al. (2004) and Wallin et al. (2004) for ponderosa pine in
northern Arizona. Time-integrated ratio of leaf internal (Ci) to
external (Ca) carbon dioxide concentration may have re-
mained unchanged in treated units relative to controls if in-
creases of Ci due to greater stomatal conductance were offset
by similar photosynthesis-induced decreases in Ci. Greater
light in treated units relative to denser controls (foliage for iso-
tope analyses was sampled in the mid-canopy) may have fur-
ther contributed to lower Ci in trees from treated units and to
offsetting the effect of treatment-induced increases in stomatal
conductance.
Overall, our results suggest that the reduced June and July
leaf-level photosynthetic rate of trees in untreated control units
compared with trees in treated units is primarily a response to
limiting water rather than nitrogen. However, we cannot dis-
count the possibility of a positive treatment-induced effect on
leaf nitrogen concentration and photosynthesis shortly after
treatment applications. For instance, Feeney et al. (1998) re-
ported increases in Nmass (N on a mass basis) in response to
thinning + first-entry prescribed burning relative to thinning
alone in old growth ponderosa pine in northern Arizona 1 and
2 years after treatment.
While active management improved tree performance (see
also Powers and Reynolds 1999), our results show that physio-
logical activity and growth did not vary in response to the spe-
cific type of treatment applied (thinning or thinning followed
by prescribed fire). Similar results were found by Feeney et al.
(1998), suggesting that the application of low-severity pre-
scribed fire after thinning does not necessarily affect ponder-
osa pine performance relative to thinning alone. Furthermore,
we found that the season in which fire was applied after thin-
ning (spring or fall) did not affect physiological activity or
growth in the mid-term. However, ponderosa pine physiology
and growth in response to prescribed fire appears to be sensi-
tive to the specific conditions (including tree health, weather
and fire and fuel characteristics) under which management is
implemented. Prescribed fire has been shown both to reduce
(Grier 1989, Sutherland et al. 1991, Landsberg 1994, Busse et
al. 2000) and increase (Wyant et al. 1983, Feeney et al. 1998)
ponderosa pine growth indicators. Spring burns, particularly
when associated with significant forest floor consumption,
tend to produce negative growth responses (Grier 1989,
Landsberg 1994, Busse et al. 2000) and greater mortality
(Swezy and Agee 1991), and low-intensity fall burns, positive
responses (Wyant et al. 1983, Feeney et al. 1998). The lack of
response to prescribed fire and season of fire that we report
may result from the relatively light fuel loads and the lower
forest floor consumption in the spring burn relative to the fall
burn.
Our study has some limitations. First, the site was repeat-
edly managed until the 1960s. Second, for logistical reasons,
control units were not randomized among actively treated
units. Third, we do not have pretreatment measurements and
therefore we cannot exclude the possibility that the differences
we found existed prior to treatment. However, this is unlikely
because previous management was similar in all units and the
overall site was uniform (Arno 1999). Further, our results are

consistent with those of other studies (Feeney et al. 1998, Kolb
et al. 1998, McDowell et al. 2003, Skov et al. 2004, Wallin et
al. 2004). If the primary goals of land owners or managers are
to improve the health and productivity of ponderosa pine trees
and to reduce the immediate risk of severe wildfire, results
from this study suggest that thinning alone with subsequent
fuel management may serve that purpose.
However, restorative ecosystem management in ponderosa
pine forests acknowledges the historic role of fire as a natural
ecosystem-level disturbance (see Allen et al. 2002). In the
long-term, periodic fire may have many ecological effects be-
yond those examined here (Carlson et al. 1993). If such fire ef-
fects are desired, this study suggests that they can be acheived
by fall or spring fire applications under the conditions de-
scribed here after stand thinning without reducing ponderosa
pine physiological activity and growth relative to a thinning-
only treatment.
