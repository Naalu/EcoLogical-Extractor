Executive Summary 
 
In December 2011, the Ecological Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona University 
(ERI) contracted with the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest and the White Mountain 
Stewardship Project (WMS) Monitoring Board to address four of the prioritized ecological 
monitoring questions developed for the Project (Sitko and Hurteau 2010). The questions were the 
following:  
1. Is there a difference between pre-treatment crown fire potential and post-treatment 
desired fire behavior across selected analysis areas?  
2. What proportion of treated acres exhibited a change in Fire Regime Condition Class 
(FRCC) from 2004 – 2014?  
3. Are patch sizes of denser (i.e., untreated or lightly treated) areas connected? What is the 
range of areas and sizes of these patches?  
4. Are exotics/invasive species present at landings and burn piles?  
 
These questions were addressed for WMSP treatments completed in 2011; monitoring 
under this contract did not analyze data from treatments done previously. The ERI worked 
closely with Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest Staff to identify 2011 projects and obtain 
available maps, data, and other information. Nineteen task orders (projects) were identified and 
copies of project maps were transferred to ERI. Project maps showed treatment unit boundaries 
and some gave limited prescription information. No pretreatment monitoring data were identified 
for any of the 2011 projects. Therefore, ERI followed WMSP protocols for pretreatment plot 
establishment and vegetation monitoring. Treatment effects were based on estimates of 
pretreatment conditions (question 1) and analysis of field data (question 1 and 4) as well as 
remotely sensed data derived from post-treatment imagery (questions 2 and 3). This report 
summarizes findings related to the four monitoring questions. We also provide electronic files of 
project area maps, plot locations, plot photos, and raw field data archived on a separate compact 
disc. 
 
Analyses of field and remotely sensed data indicated the following:  
1. In general, WMS treatments resulted in reduced canopy fuel loading and potential fire 
behavior across the project areas. Three project areas (Task Orders) where stand structure 
remains dense and crowning index values are low are Alpine WUI 4&8, Block 5; Black 
Mesa, Porcupine Ridge; and Lakeside, Butler. Although potential fire behavior was 
generally reduced by treatments, resulting stand structure was further interpreted in light 
of forest restoration goals. WMS treatments effectively reduced potential fire behavior 
and appeared to restore more natural structural characteristics. Future treatments could 
more explicitly utilize NRV concepts and site-specific presettlement evidence. 
2. WMS treatments implemented in 2011 did move forest along a trajectory towards less 
departed stands and more similar to historic conditions.  The changes are very small, 
which is expected at the rates of treatments.  Most of the WMS treatments occurred in the 
Ponderosa forest type, which evolved with frequent fire and is currently in much denser 
conditions across the intermountain west today than historically.  Treatments in these 
forests can have multiple benefits: fire risk reduction is a primary objective of WMS, but 
restoration objectives can also be met with small diameter tree removal and the creation 
of openings for a more divers and resilient understory. 
3. WMS treatments retained untreated and lightly treated, higher canopy cover patches but 
these patches showed low connectivity across project areas. Although little information is 

4 
 
available to guide restoration prescriptions at emulating natural landscape patterns, no 
research to date has indicated large patches of closed-canopied forest prior to historical 
fire regime disruption. Such high cover patches may provide high quality habitat for 
canopy dependent species such as tassel-eared squirrels, but retaining these patches may 
also compromise other restoration goals.     
4. In answer to the question of whether invasive plant species are found on landings and 
slash piles, we did find a small number of plants/populations on these sites, but because 
of a small sample size and confounding factors (high light conditions on a road for 
example), particularly in the fire itself, we did not find evidence to indicate that these 
sites were more preferentially invaded than any other type of microsite. However, we had 
a small sample size to work with, particularly inside the Wallow Fire, due to the random 
location of our plots. It would also appear from our monitoring, that roads and skid trails 
have a high probability of being invaded by non-native species, probably because of the 
soil disturbance that occurs.

Methods 
White Mountain Stewardship Project Treatment Areas 
 
A total of 19 White Mountain Stewardship (WMS) Task Orders (hereafter “projects”) 
treated in 2011 were identified for monitoring in 2012 (Table 1.1). Project maps provided by US 
Forest Service staff showed treatment unit boundaries and some gave limited prescription 
information. Project areas ranged from about 264 to 6,849 acres in size. Most projects (74%) 
were between 1,000 and 2,500 acres in size. No pretreatment monitoring data were identified for 
any of the 2011 projects. Therefore, ERI followed WMS protocol for pretreatment plot 
establishment in order to address monitoring questions. 
 
As per WMS pretreatment sampling protocol (Sitko and Hurteau 2010), one cutting unit 
(hereafter “unit”) within each project was randomly selected for monitoring. Selected unit 
boundaries were digitized from hardcopy maps using a geographic information system (GIS; 
ArcGIS 9.3). Acreage of units was determined and from three to six plots sample plot locations 
were randomly selected using the Hawth’s Tools extension for ArcGIS. Sampling intensity was 
one plot per 20 acres with a minimum of three plots per unit and a maximum of six plots per unit 
(Table 1) (Sitko and Hurteau 2010). Sample plot locations are provided in electronic data files 
accompanying this report. 
Field Sampling Protocols 
 
Maps and global positioning systems (GPS) were used in the field to navigate to sample 
plot locations. At each location, a 0.10-acre circular sample plot was established. Plot centers 
were demarcated for long-term remeasurement using an 8-inch piece of steel rebar driven into 
the soil. Aluminum tags indicating unit and plot number were attached to rebar. In addition, a 
reference tag indicating direction and distance to plot center was attached to the base of a large 
live tree in each plot.   
 
 
Variable radius sampling (10 basal area factor prism) was used at each plot center to record basal 
area (BA; ft2 ac-1) of live and standing dead trees. Tree species was recorded as well as diameter 
for all “in” trees. In addition, linear distance to each cut stump was measured and a plot radius 
factor (2.75) was used in combination with stump diameter to determine a limiting distance for 
stump tallies. For all live “in” trees, total height and height to base of live crown was recorded. 
One transect (50 ft) was installed at each plot to sample woody surface fuels. Each transect was 
oriented on a due east azimuth (90ᵒ) from plot center. Surface fuels were tallied by moisture-lag 
classes: 1, 10, 100, and 1000-hrs following methods given in Brown (1974). The largest class 
(i.e., 1000-hr fuels) was further separated into sound and rotten categories. Tree regeneration

(i.e., seedlings) was tallied by species within a 0.025-acre plot centered on the sample location 
point. Lastly, canopy cover (%) was measured at each plot using a densitometer. Canopy cover 
readings were taken every 6.5 feet along a 65.6-ft transect oriented on a south (180ᵒ) azimuth for 
10 total measurements at each plot.  
Analysis 
 
To analyze changes in potential fire behavior within WMS cutting units, we used 
NEXUS 2.0 crown fire analysis software (www.fire.org). We ran the NEXUS model using 
inputs from post-treatment plot measurements and compared outputs to those of modeling runs 
using estimated pre-treatment conditions. In addition, we generated basic stand structure and 
fuels summaries for pretreatment and post-treatment periods. Variables summarized were species 
importance, trees per acre (TPA), BA, mean diameter (QMD), crown base height (CBH), crown 
fuel load (CFL), canopy cover, and canopy bulk density (CBD). Pretreatment estimates of forest 
structure (TPA, BA, CFL, and CBD) were made by reconstructing tree species and size from cut 
stumps observed on field sample plots. Species importance was calculated as the sum of relative 
TPA (unit mean) plus relative BA (unit mean) for the individual species. Thus, for a given 
species x: 
 

9 
 
 
 
Ix = (TPAx/TPAs *100) + (BAx/Bas *100) 
 
where Ix is species x importance; TPAx is trees per acre of species x,; TPAs is total trees per acre 
of the stand (plot); BAx is basal area of species x; and Bas is total basal area of the stand (plot).   
 
Canopy bulk density (and CFL) for NEXUS modeling was estimated using equations found in 
Cruz et al. (2003). We also used the lowest quintile live crown base height from post-treatment 
plot measurements and pre-treatment estimates. For both pretreatment and post-treatment 
modeling, we used fire weather extremes (98th - 100th percentile conditions) for the dates of June 
6 – 12, 2011, from the Remote Automatic Weather Station (RAWS) in Greer, Arizona (020404). 
Fuel moistures for these conditions at Greer were generated by FireFamilyPlus 
(www.firemodels.org). We also used 33 miles per hour as the wind speed at 20 feet to 
parameterize NEXUS model runs. This wind speed was the average daily speed at 20 feet 
recorded June 6 – 12, 2011 at the Greer RAWS. We selected this date as representing an extreme 
fire behavior period during the Wallow Fire. We used Fuel Model 10 for pretreatment and Fuel 
Model 2 for post-treatment NEXUS simulations (Scott and Burgan 2005).    
 
Results 
 
The majority (63%) of WMS treatments in 2011 were implemented in ponderosa pine 
(Pinus ponderosa) or ponderosa pine – Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) forest ecosystems. As 
determined by calculated importance values. Seven of the 19 (37%) projects were implemented 
in mixed-conifer forests, where white fir (Abies concolor), southwestern white pine (Pinus 
strobiformis), aspen (Populus tremuloides) Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), and 
Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) variably occurred in addition to ponderosa pine and Gambel 
oak (Table 1.2). Ranges for initial stand density, BA, and mean diameter before treatment were 
87-713 TPA, 60-245 ft2 ac-1, and 9-17 in., respectively (Table 1.3). 
 
Thinning had variable effects on species composition in the seven mixed-conifer projects (Table 
1.2). However, none of these units showed a post-treatment increase in ponderosa importance. 
Thinning reduced stand density and basal area on all sampled units, and increased mean diameter 
on 13 of 19 projects (68%). Ranges for post-treatment stand density, BA, and mean diameter 
were 7-205 TPA, 17-155 ft2 ac-1, and 10-20 in., respectively (Table 1.3). 
 
Effects of thinning on stand structure generally translated to reductions in canopy fuels (Table 
1.3). Although thinning reduced crown fuel loading and canopy bulk density on all units 
sampled, crown base height was increased on only 8 of the 19 (42%) projects. There was no 
clear relationship between changes in crown base height and forest type (Table 1.3). Reduced 
canopy fuel loading resulted in reductions in predicted fire behavior (Table 1.4). Most (57%) of 
the units showed a change from active pretreatment crown fire potential to passive post-
treatment crown fire potential. Treatments reduced rate of spread on 15 of 19 sampled units 
(79%). Both fireline intensity and flame length were reduced and crowning index was increased 
by treatments on all units (Table 1.4). The greatest reductions in predicted fire behavior were 
found on units where tree density and basal area were lowest post-treatment.

Discussion 
 
In general, treatments resulted in reduced canopy fuel loading and potential fire behavior 
across the project areas. Three sites where stand structure remains dense and crowning index 
values are low are Alpine WUI 4&8, Block 5; Black Mesa, Porcupine Ridge; and Lakeside, 
Butler (Table 1.4). Although potential fire behavior was generally reduced by treatments, 
resulting stand structure can be further interpreted in light of forest restoration goals. 
 
 
Two central goals of the White Mountain Stewardship Project are to restore forest health and 
reduce the threat of uncharacteristic wildfire (Sitko and Hurteau 2010). Prior to Euro-American 
settlement and the intensive land uses that commenced in the late 19th century, ponderosa pine 
and dry mixed-conifer forests of the Southwest were generally less dense and more open in 
structure than forests of today (Covington and Moore 1994). These open forest conditions both 
supported and were a product of frequent surface fires burning through fine understory fuels 
(Covington 2003). With settlement and intensive land use, historical fire regimes were disrupted 
and forest structure eventually became drastically altered (Moore et al. 1999). Restoration of 
forest health in its most basic sense calls for treatments that result in stand structures that fall 
within natural ranges of variability (NRV). NRV characterizes ecosystem function prior to fire 
regime disruption. For example forest reconstruction analysis and historical surveys have 
indicated that density and basal area of stands ranged about 11-137 TPA, and 16-124 ft2 ac-1, 
respectively, before settlement (Stoddard 2011). It should be noted that 75% of the reconstructed 
values fall between about 22 and 74 TPA, and between 38 and 81 ft2 ac-1 BA (Stoddard 2011). 
These central areas of the probability distributions would be suitable guides for developing basic 
restoration prescriptions where site-specific reference information is lacking.   
 
Based on field data from sample monitoring plots, 79% of the units were outside NRV for TPA 
(Table 1.3). After treatment, TPA in 16% of the units remained higher than NRV and 5% fell 
below NRV. Only 31% of the units showed mean TPA to be within the central area of the NRV 
probability distribution and about 50% of the sites showed tree densities that corresponded to the 
tails of NRV.  Before treatment, 84% of the sites showed BA outside NRV (Table 1.3). 
Treatments reduced 95% of the units to within NRV for BA and none fell below NRV (Table 
1.3). Of the 19 sites, 42% showed BA to be within the central area of the NRV probability 
distribution. About 53% of the sites showed mean BA values corresponding to the tails of NRV. 
 
Treatments increased mean diameter on the majority (68%) of sampled project units (Table 1.3). 
This indicates that smaller trees were targeted in thinning prescriptions and diameter 
distributions were shifted toward larger classes. Mean diameter was not affected by treatments 
on 26% of the units, which suggests thinning was done across all size classes. Several studies 
have indicated that stand structures prior to fire regime disruption were typically made up of all 
sizes and ages of trees and not dominated by smaller, younger trees as shown in most 
contemporary forests (Fulé et al. 1997, Mast et al. 1999, Roccaforte et al. 2010). Thus, WMS 
treatments in general appeared to be effective at moving stands closer to NRV in diameter 
distribution. 
 
In summary, WMS treatments effectively reduced potential fire behavior and appeared to restore 
more natural structural characteristics. Future treatments could more explicitly utilize NRV 
concepts and site-specific presettlement evidence.

The area used in this analysis was the administrative boundary of the Ranger Districts 
within the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest where White Mountain Stewardship Projects were 
implemented in 2011. This included the Alpine, Black Mesa, Springerville and Lakeside Ranger 
Districts.  Over 40 forest, woodland and grass/shrub types (plant association groups, modified to 
Biophysical Setting (BpS)) were found in this 1,609,528-acre landscape. However, White 
Mountain Stewardship treatments were consistently implemented in no more than 4 BpS’s with 
majority of treatments implement in the Southern Rocky Mountain Ponderosa Pine Woodland 
BpS (Table 2.1).

Fire Regime Condition Class   
 
The Fire Regime Condition Class (FRCC) concept was developed to help land managers 
assess ecological conditions.  FRCC is a landscape metric that incorporates a simple designation 
of the degree of departure of current vegetation composition and fire regimes from historical 
vegetation composition and fire regimes. FRCC can only be assessed at landscapes large enough 

16 
 
to incorporate a “natural disturbance event”.  Therefore, changes within smaller projects need to 
be cumulatively addressed in the larger landscape.  A 100-acre treatment does not change FRCC.  
 
The FRCC Departure index is developed using reference conditions from the historical range of 
variability (HRV), within which dynamic ecosystems generally remain over time (Morgan et al. 
1994).   Reference conditions in the Southwest were created by local experts and available 
literature for many ecosystems with Vegetation Dynamic Development Tool (VDDT) 
(LANDFIRE mapping process).  Although FRCC encompasses both departure in system 
structural conditions and departure in fire regime, the standardized index used across the US 
incorporates only structural condition departure.  This is done by assessing the current 
distribution of a coarse delineation of successional (or seral) stages for each vegetation type and 
comparing with the expected distribution from reference conditions (Schmidt et al. 2002). 
 
We used the FRCC Ecological Departure standardized index to develop the departure of current 
forest structure stage distributions from historic successional stage distributions.  Across much of 
our federal lands, late successional stages are much rarer on the landscape than historically as a 
result of past harvest management.  Much of our forested federal lands are composed of trees 
classified as “mid-successional”, but represent a range of densities.   
 
 
Condition Class simply categorizes the ecological departure index into 3 categories (Table 2.2, 
conditional class 1 = 1-33% departure; condition class 2 > 33% departure and < 66% departure; 
and condition class 3 > 66% departure; Rice et al. 2007). The higher the condition class, the 
more altered the system is, implying significant alteration of stand and landscape function.  
 
Table 2.2. Condition Class index (Hann et al. 2005). 
 
Condition Class 
Description Potential Risks 
Condition Class 1  
Within the natural (historical) range 
of variability of vegetation 
characteristics; fuel composition; 
fire frequency, severity and pattern; 
and other associated disturbances. 
Fire behavior, effects, and other associated 
disturbances are similar to those that occurred 
prior to fire exclusion (suppression) and other 
types of management that do not mimic the 
natural fire regime and associated vegetation and 
fuel characteristics. Composition and structure 
of vegetation and fuels are similar to the natural 
(historical) regime. Risk of loss of key 
ecosystem components (e.g. native species, large 
trees, and soil) is low. 
Condition Class 2  
Moderate departure from the 
natural (historical) regime of 
vegetation characteristics; fuel 
composition; fire frequency, 
severity and pattern; and other 
associated disturbances. 
Fire behavior, effects, and other associated 
disturbances are moderately departed (more or 
less severe). Composition and structure of 
vegetation and fuel are moderately altered. 
Uncharacteristic conditions range from low to 
moderate; Risk of loss of key ecosystem 
components are moderate. 
Condition Class 3  
High departure from the natural 
(historical) regime of vegetation 
characteristics; fuel composition; 
fire frequency, severity and pattern; 
and other associated disturbances. 
Fire behavior, effects, and other associated 
disturbances are highly departed (more or less 
severe). Composition and structure of vegetation 
and fuel are highly altered. Uncharacteristic 
conditions range from moderate to high.  Risk of 
loss of key ecosystem components is high.

Mapping and Assessment Tools 
 
The technical team used the LANDFIRE data layers to assess pre-treatment conditions on 
the Apache-Sitegreaves National Forest and to capture the reference conditions.  We used the 
administrative boundaries of the Ranger Districts (with the exception of Clifton RD) for the 
analysis area. The data layers used included: 
 
Spatial Data: 
1. Biophysical Setting (BpS, Vegetation Type, LANDFIRE) 
2. Current Succession Classes (LANDFIRE) 
3. Landscape Analysis Units (Ranger Districts, Apache-Sitgreaves NF) 
4. 2011 White Mountain Stewardship treatment polygons (Apache-Sitgreaves NF and ERI staff) 
 
Tabular Data: 
5. Reference Condition Table (LANDFIRE) 
 
a. lists Succession Class percents for each BpS 
 
b. lists appropriate landscape level for each BpS 
Assumptions and Known Issues 
1. Biophysical Setting (BpS): The BpS includes the area’s native species – determined 
according to our best understanding of the historical or nature range of variation 
including disturbances.  Each BpS can be associated with a Fire Regime (see Table 2.1), 
describing the characteristic fire frequency and severity for that BpS.  Known issues in 
Region 3 for Landfire mapping include BpS designation and scaling errors.  Where there 
was a lack of ground-data to inform the national mapping effort, LANDSAT imagery was 
difficult to interpret and assign appropriately. As a result, BpS maps are best used at 
district-level to regional scales, and not for project-level planning.  Local data sets are 
best for project planning.  LANDFIRE BpS’s were used for this analysis because 
successional stage data, needed for FRCC Ecological Departure mapping, were not 
available from local data sets. The Condition Class (CC) analysis was done for each BpS 
(e.g. ponderosa pine) where White Mountain Stewardship projects were implemented in 
2011, within each Ranger District.   
 
2. Current Succession Classes:  To efficiently use the mapping tool, each vegetation type 
was broken down into different successional classes.  For example, ponderosa pine was 
broken into 5 successional classes (Table 2.3).

Early successional = regenerating stands following a disturbance (like fire), 
characterized in ponderosa pine by seedlings and saplings 
B 
MSC 
Mid-successional closed = “middle aged” stands characterized in ponderosa 
pine by pole – sized trees.  Closed refers to canopy cover – in this case, closed 
canopies are characterized by canopies with greater than 40% closure (many of 
these stands have interlocking crowns). 
C 
MSO 
Mid-successional open = “middle aged” stands characterized in ponderosa pine 
by pole – sized trees.  Open refers to canopy cover – in this case, open 
canopies are characterized by canopies with less than 40% closure. 
D 
LSO 
Late-successional open = old-growth stands characterized in ponderosa pine by 
the large diameter, orange-bark trees.  Open canopy as above. 
E 
LSC 
Late-successional closed = old-growth stands characterized in ponderosa pine 
by the large diameter, orange-bark trees.  Closed canopy as above. 
 
The distribution of these successional stages across the landscape was calculated for current 
forests for each vegetation type, and then compared with historic successional stage distributions 
for each vegetation type.  The historic successional stage distributions are not spatially explicit, 
but in tabular form. 
 
A departure index was calculated for each vegetation type based on the similarity of these 
distributions (see results Tables 2.5 -2. 8. See www.frcc.gov for more information on the 
departure index calculations).   
 
3. Known Issues of LANDFIRE Region 3 successional class include mis-classifications into 
the late-successional, closed-canopy successional stage (Code E).  The height cut-offs of 
late successional in this region were 10 m (~33ft).  Therefore, any stand with tree heights 
over 33ft were classified as late-successional.  Ground data confirm that multiple “mid-
successional” stages were mis-classified as late, because of this height cut-off. 
 
4. Landscape Analyses Units:  Ranger District classification, no known issues. 
 
5. Historic successional stage distribution can be estimated from a variety of data; the best 
data are found in stands still existing with their natural fire regime intact.  If no intact 
stands are available, historic stand structure is calculated from dendrochronology studies 
(tree ring counts), fire history studies, and/ or ecological modeling.  We used the 
LANDFIRE regional modeling results (http://landfire.cr.usga.gov) to determine historic 
successional stage distributions. Known issues include small data availability for non-
ponderosa pine forest types with greater utilization of local expert knowledge. 
 
Results 
 
 
The results from the Condition Class mapping tool were summarized to assess departure 
across all treated vegetation types (BpS’s) for Alpine, Black Mesa, Springerville, and Lakeside 
Ranger Districts on the Apache-Sitgreaves NF.

Treatment effects on Ecological Departure 
 
White Mountain Stewardship Treatments were developed from Apache-Sitgreaves NF 
spatial data that were either acquired from the forest, or digitized from paper maps received from 
forest staff. 
 
Because FRCC is a landscape metric, large areas of the landscape would need to see changes to 
show significant differences in pre-treatment and post-treatment ecological departure.  What can 
be expected from smaller treatment areas are small shifts that can suggest trends along the 
ecological departure scale. 
 
Assumptions were made to determine treatment impacts on successional stage distributions.  
Because White Mountain Stewardship treatments focus on smaller diameter tree removal and 
reductions in canopy cover and ladder fuels, we can make assumptions that treatments move 
stands from closed canopy to open canopy (Table 2.4).  Treatments do not affect mid or late-
successional stage transitions – the mid- and late-successional transitions are surrogates for “age 
of stand” and are time dependent.  A clear-cut treatment would move mid- or late-successional 
stands to early successional; however those are not typical of White Mountain Stewardship 
treatments.

Trends 
 
2011 White Mountain Stewardship treatments did move forests along a trajectory 
towards less departed stands and more similar to historic conditions.  The changes are very 
small, which is expected at the rates of treatments.  Most of the WMS treatments occurred in the 
ponderosa forest type, which evolved with frequent fire and is currently in much denser 
conditions across the intermountain west today than historically.  Treatments in these forests can 
have multiple benefits: fire risk reduction is a primary objective of WMS, but restoration 
objectives can also be met with small diameter tree removal and the creation of openings for a 
more divers and resilient understory. 
Future analysis 
 
The FRCC Departure Index is a landscape metric.  As such, it is best assessed in large 
time frames, at least every 5 years.  Knowledge of treatment effects is important to understand 
the transitions between successional stages.  In addition, local data corrections to LANDFIRE 
data seem to be the best source for accurate successional stage determinations.  We expect that 
some more recent R3 data layers may better inform this analysis, including the R3 Mid-scale 
Vegetation Analysis.

Addition Issues 
 
Using a standardized index brings up a variety of concerns.  Above we have clarified 
potential uses of a condition class analysis.  A primary area of concern is the misconception that 
a Condition Class analysis is equivalent to a fire risk map; a CC analysis includes no information 
on fuels and is based entirely on overstory canopy information.  This creates the following issues 
(for more detail, see Merriam et al. 2006): 
1. Areas mapped as CC III (red) may have no fuels-related issues at all. For example, our 
analysis showed Dry Ponderosa Pine with highly departed (CCIII) abundances of closed-
canopy, mid-successional stands today than historically.  These areas may also have a 
higher potential of crown fire and high severity fire (analysis not done in this report).   
2. Conversely, areas mapped as CC I (green) may have major fuels-related issues. Since the 
vegetation map provides no information on understory vegetation, this information is 
invisible to the FRCC calculation: FRCC cannot map what it does not know. 
3. Because the Condition Class measure is driven by overstory canopy conditions, and 
because it does not explicitly include information on surface and ladder fuels, fuels 
treatments which do not significantly modify canopy cover and/or size-class are unlikely 
to change condition class, even where they have significantly reduced expected flame 
lengths or spread rates.  Many of our fuels reduction treatments in Wildland Urban 
Interface do not change overstory structure enough to alter Condition Class, but still are 
effective to reduce fuels.

3. Are patch sizes of denser (i.e., untreated or lightly treated) areas 
connected? What is the range of areas and sizes of these patches (WMS 
monitoring question 8)? 
 
Joe Crouse and Dave Huffman 
Methods 
 
To address this monitoring question, we analyzed post-treatment forest canopy cover on 
19 project areas (Task Orders, see Ch 1.) treated under WMS in 2011. We used Landsat TM5 
imagery, Landsat scene Path 35, Row 36, acquired October 21, 2011, to develop a canopy cover 
GIS “layer” for project areas on the Apache National Forest and scene Path 36, Row 36, acquired 
October 12, 2011, for projects located on the Sitgreaves National Forest. These two scenes were 
the best available (cloud and haze-free) post-treatment datasets available. 
 
Project maps provided by USFS were scanned and georeferenced.  Project boundaries were then 
digitized and the resulting spatial layer was used to clip the Landsat imagery. Canopy cover data 
collected during the 2012 field season were used to “train” canopy cover classification 
performed with the imagery.  We used these supervised classifications to identify four canopy 
cover classes: 1) 1-20%, 2) 21-50%, 3) 51-80%, and 4) non-forest. We found no areas with 
canopy cover great than 80% using a minimum mapping unit of 323 ft2 (30 m2). Classified maps 
were then analyzed using FRAGSTATS (McGarigal et al. 2012). Outputs examined to address 
the WMS monitoring questions were average (area-weighted; see Turner et al. 2001), minimum, 
and maximum patch sizes. Because the monitoring question is focused on connectivity of 
“untreated or lightly treated areas”, we assumed that these were represented by patches of 
canopy cover class 3 (51-80%). In addition to the above patch metrics, we analyzed the 
proportion of the project area comprised of cover class 3 and calculated an index of connectivity 
according to methods described in Turner et al. (2001). This index provides an estimate of the 
relative mean patch size and is calculated as: 
 
 
 
Ci =  LCi / (pi * E) 
 
where Ci is connectivity index for patch type i; LCi is the size of the largest patch of type I; pi is 
the proportion of the landscape in patch type i, and E is the extent of the analyzed landscape. 
Thus, for any patch type, greater connectivity is indicated as Ci approaches 1.0 (relative patch 
size increases). Conversely, low connectivity is indicated by values of Ci close to 0 (dispersed 
smaller patches). 
 
Results 
 
 
As previously described, WMS project areas ranged 264-6,849 acres in size; most (74%) 
were between 1,000 and 2,500 acres (Table 3.1). Mean patch size of cover class 3 (51-80% 
cover) across all areas post-treatment ranged 1.5-161.9 acres. Fifty-three percent of the projects

showed cover class 3 mean patch sizes of less than 10 acres (Table 3.1). Maximum cover class 3 
patch sizes ranged 4.9-302.6 acres. Most sites (58%) showed maximum cover class 3 patch sizes 
less than 50 acres, and 21% showed maximum patch sizes greater than 100 acres (Table 3.1). As 
a proportion of the project area extents, cover class 3 made up 3.3-35.1%. Most (63%) project 
areas showed 10-25% in cover class 3 (Table 3.1). Although some projects showed larger patch 
size, and most projects showed notable proportions comprised of cover class 3, connectivity was 
generally low (Table 3.1). Connectivity index was 1.0 at one site (Alpine, Nutrioso 1B), whereas 
the remained of the project areas showed index values less than 0.30.  
 
Discussion  
 
Connectivity of untreated and lightly treated areas was general low across the WMS 
project areas treated in 2011. The combination of low connectivity index values and notable 
proportions of project areas comprised of cover class 3 (51-80% canopy cover) patches suggests 
that patches of this class were mostly small and scattered. The WMS monitoring question 
addressed here implies that stakeholders desire connectivity of higher canopy cover areas, likely 
due to concerns over habitat of canopy-dependent wildlife species (Andrén 1994). For example, 
Prather et al. (2006) recommended patches of >395 acres where canopy cover is >40% be 
retained in forest treatment areas for tassel-eared squirrel recruitment in northern Arizona 
ponderosa pine forests.  
 
Although such considerations may seem overly focused on individual species and fail to 
acknowledge many other goals of ponderosa pine forest restoration (e.g., characteristic fire, 
understory plant production, soil processes, hydrologic function, etc.), little information is 
available concerning reference landscape patterns that may be used as guides for restoration 
treatments. Most information on canopy cover prior to Euro-American settlement and fire regime 
disruption has been summarized at scale of the site or tree group. For example, Sánchez Meador 
et al. (2011) reconstructed presettlement canopy cover on 2.5-acre ponderosa pine and pine-oak 
plots in northern Arizona and found cover ranged 10.2-18.8%. Similarly, White (1985) reported 
that canopy cover in presettlement ponderosa pine groups averaged 21.9%. No studies to date 
have documented presettlement high canopy cover in large patches.  
 
In summary, WMS treatments retained untreated and lightly treated, higher canopy cover patches 
but these patches showed low connectivity across project areas. Although little information is 
available to guide restoration prescriptions at emulating natural landscape patterns, no research 
to date has indicated large patches of closed-canopied forest prior to historical fire regime 
disruption. Such high cover patches may provide high quality habitat for canopy dependent 
species such as tassel-eared squirrels, but retaining these patches may also compromise other 
restoration goals.

4. Are exotics/invasive species present at landings and burn piles (WMS 
monitoring question 11)?  
 
Judith D. Springer 
 
Introduction 
 
Invasive exotic plant species may invade disturbed areas following tree thinning, 
prescribed burning, or wildfire due primarily to the increased availability of resources (including 
sunlight, nutrients and moisture) and decreased tree competition. Most of these species are early 
successional or ruderal species and capitalize quickly on the newly available niches. Determining 
if there are certain land management practices that are contributing to increased abundance or 
invasion of these species is key to modifying thinning and burning practices in an effort to 
decrease their spread following ecological restoration treatments.  
 
The original question asked by the White Mountain Stewardship Board was designed to ascertain 
if exotic invasive species were present at landings and burn piles. The ERI modified the question 
to also examine if these species are found in the WMS project area, inside or outside of the 
Wallow Fire perimeter, and in what density. The White Mountain Stewardship Project offers an 
opportunity to monitor for invasion on a landscape scale in areas that have been thinned only (or 
thinned and pile burned), as well as in areas that have been burned by the Wallow Fire.  
 
Methods 
Monitoring Design 
 
Project areas and sample plots used in this study are described above in Chapter 1 
(Chancellor et al. this report). Each plot was established as a long-term monitoring plot, with a 
monumented center and a reference tree for relocating the center. On each plot, we measured 
overstory characteristics, surface fuels, and regeneration. We also conducted a rapid assessment 
to determine if invasive non-native species were present on the plot, and if so, we recorded 
microsite and a rough estimate of density and abundance of each subpopulation.  
 
From the plot center, we ran a 100 m tape in all four cardinal directions to form four triangular 
quadrants, for a total plot area of 2500 m2. We then searched each quadrant for the non-native 
species of concern (listed in Appendix A of this report), using roughly a 5 x 5 m unit in which to 
estimate density (low density = <10 individuals, medium density = 10-50 individuals, high 
density = 50-100 individuals, and very high = >100 individuals). Observations were also 
recorded for the predominant microsite and whether the plants were clumped together (dense), 
uniformly distributed, scattered, or widely scattered.  Photographs of plants or populations were 
collected for documentation, and specimens were collected to confirm identification. Although 
included on the list of species of concern, Verbascum thapsus (common mullein) was not 
included in surveys because of its ubiquitous and generally ephemeral nature in aboveground 
vegetation on the landscape. In addition, we did not collect information on non-native species, 
such as Taraxacum officinale (common dandelion) that are not considered to be invasive in this 
region. 

 
 
28 
 
 
For analysis, we used the midpoint of the density classes, so that the numbers of plants in each 
subpopulation are very likely inflated (for example, a single plant would have been recorded as 
five plants, which is the midpoint of the low density class).  
Results 
 
The types of microsites containing invasive species differed between areas inside and 
outside the perimeter of the Wallow Fire. The vast majority of invasive non-native plants and 
populations were found in areas where the tree canopy was relatively open (predominately full 
sun). Approximately 88% of plants/populations were detected in areas of open 
canopy/predominantly full sun inside the perimeter of the Wallow Fire, and 90% were found in 
full sun outside of the burn (Table 4.1).

* Landings and slash piles were mostly obliterated during the fire and difficult to locate on the 
ground 
 
The majority of non-native invasive species were detected in areas containing predominately 
bare mineral soil inside the burn (68%), but outside of the burned area, invasives were found 
equally in areas of predominately bare soil or organic material (including litter and duff).  
 
Because the fire obliterated much of the evidence of previous landings or slash piles, we were 
not able to observe if invasives were growing on landings within the burned area, and there was 
very little slash left following the fire, so no invasives were detected in slash piles or areas of 
scattered slash (slash created during thinning operations but not deliberately scattered) following 
the fire. Outside of the fire, invasives were more commonly found in areas of scattered slash than 

 
 
29 
 
on slash piles or landings. However, almost a third of the time, invasives were found on roads 
(including decommissioned roads) and skid trails.  
 
In answer to the question of whether invasive species are found on landings and slash piles, we 
did find a small number of plants/populations on these sites, but because of a small sample size 
and confounding factors (high light conditions on a road for example), particularly in the fire 
itself, we did not find evidence to indicate that these sites were more preferentially invaded than 
any other type of microsite. However, we had a small sample size to work with, particularly 
inside the fire, due to the random location of our plots. It would also appear from our monitoring, 
that roads and skid trails have a high probability of being invaded by non-native species, 
probably because of the soil disturbance that occurs. 
 
We observed five invasive non-native species from the list in Appendix A within the nineteen 
cutting units: Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass), Carduus nutans (musk thistle), Cirsium vulgare 
(bull thistle), Convolvulus arvensis (bindweed) and Erodium cicutarium (redstem filaree) (Table 
4.2). Carduus nutans is a Class A Noxious Weed with a treatment priority of 1. The remaining 
four species fall under Class C, treatment priority 3. All five species were found in the perimeter 
of the Wallow Fire, but only Cirsium vulgare and Erodium cicutarium were found outside of the 
perimeter.

Bromus tectorum was found mostly on bare soil (67% of subpopulations) and in full sun (83%). 
We found it only in the Nutrioso 1B cutting unit, which had been artificially seeded with a seed 
mix, and one occurrence was detected in the Nutrioso cutting unit 2. 
 
Only five subpopulations of Carduus nutans were found, and these were also growing in full 
sun, but only two of the subpopulations were on bare soil. All five were within the Wallow Fire 
perimeter. 
 
We detected two subpopulations of Convolvulus arvensis, both in full sun on eroded, bare soil. 
Erodium cicutarium was detected in small amounts inside and outside of the fire. In the fire, 75% 
of occurrences were found in full sun and 100% were on bare soil. Outside of the fire, it was 
found in full sun 100% of the time, but plants were detected in a range of microsites including 
bare soil, on a skid trail, in a drainage and in an area of scattered slash. 
 
We found Cirsium vulgare in large numbers inside and outside the fire. Outside of the perimeter, 
90% of plants/populations were found in full sun, 37% were on bare soil and 35% were found on 
areas where the soil had been disturbed, such as on roads, skid trails or areas of erosion. Eleven 
percent were found in areas of scattered slash or on slash piles and <.5% were on landings or 
burned slash piles. Within the fire, 98% of plants were found in full sun and 100% were found on 
bare soil, or soil with only small amounts of organic matter. Eighteen percent of plants were 
found on disturbed or eroding soils.   
 
During monitoring there was a small number of species that we could not identify to species 
based on nonflowering basal rosettes. In Alpine WUI 4&8 there was an Apiaceae that was rather 
numerous. At Hall Ranch, there was a Cirsium with no flowers and only small basal rosettes. 
Finally, at Hall Ranch there was also a Potentilla species that could not be identified even after 
consulting the expert on this genus. It has the potential to be a rare species or hybrid and should 
be revisited in the future for this reason.  
 
Discussion 
 
Through our monitoring efforts, we observed non-native invasive species on landings and 
burn piles, but in very small numbers, and only outside of the Wallow Fire perimeter. Opening 
up the tree canopy through thinning promotes an increase of non-native species because of the 
increased availability of sunlight and other resources. We did not conduct a research study

comparing thinned to unthinned areas, but published research studies generally support this trend 
of increased numbers of understory plants, including invasives, following thinning and/or 
burning. This trend is apparent here as well.  
 
Cirsium vulgare (bull thistle) is particularly prevalent in the Black Mesa and Lakeside areas 
following thinning activities. Seed production in this species is fairly prolific with hundreds of 
seed per flowerhead and possibly hundreds of heads per plant. Seeds fall to the ground around 
adult plants in downy masses, from which they are easily wind dispersed. Our monitoring of 
microsites indicates that these wind-dispersed seeds are probably captured by slash, litter, logs 
and soil depressions.  
 
Following wildfires and ecological restoration activities of thinning and prescribed burning, adult 
plants do not remain for long in the aboveground vegetation. However, it is quite possible that 
this species will form a persistent soil seed bank which may allow plants to colonize an area 
following soil disturbance. According to the Fire Effects Information System (Zouhar 2002), 
there is some evidence to indicate that deeply buried seeds experience induced dormancy and 
break dormancy when exposed to sunlight. Regardless of the mechanism of invasion at a site, 
whether it is through wind-dispersal or from a buried seed bank, the presence of bull thistle 
should be expected following thinning and burning activities across the landscape.  
 
Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) was primarily found in a unit that was artificially seeded following 
the fire. Cheatgrass is known to occur in seed mixes (Barclay et al. 2004), so regardless of 
whether or not the seed mix or seeding operations introduced the cheatgrass, or it entered in 
some other manner, this may be an area of monitoring that warrants increased attention.
