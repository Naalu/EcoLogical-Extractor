ABSTRACT Throughout northern Arizona, USA, forest thinning in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)
forests has become a common practice to reduce the threat of stand-replacing wildﬁre and to increase plant
and animal diversity across the landscape. To determine how thinning affects predator occurrence, we
assessed relationships between predator occupancy and the density of small mammals (prey) across a range of
tree stocking levels (basal area of 10–65 m2/ha). Predators were detected using 2 techniques: baited track
plates and motion-sensitive cameras. We sampled 33 sites for 2 weeks each in order to detect presence of
predators, and estimated occupancy using occupancy models and multimodel inference. We modeled
occupancy rates for gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), coyote (Canis latrans), and raccoon (Procyon lotor).
Our results suggest that thinning may have a positive inﬂuence on gray fox and coyote abundance, but a
negative inﬂuence on raccoon abundance. However, our inability to develop strong models that predicted
predator occupancy indicates that higher sample sizes and more habitat covariates are needed. Our
simulations indicated that, given our occupancy and detection rates, a sample size of 75 sites would allow
us to better model occupancy covariates. Overall, we found that predator occupancy can be assessed at large
spatial scales using occupancy approaches, particularly using motion-sensitive cameras, which were the most
time- and cost-efﬁcient of the methods we analyzed.  2012 The Wildlife Society.

Following Euro-American settlement in the late 1800s,
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests have undergone
dramatic changes due to a synergism of forest management
activities, including ﬁre suppression, logging, and grazing.
Today’s ponderosa pine forests are characterized by the
overrepresentation of dense, small-diameter stands that
are susceptible to stand-replacing crown ﬁres (Fule´ et al.
1997). These homogenous forests also have low understory
cover and diversity and, over time, these changes to habitat
have had negative effects on wildlife populations and com-
munities (Brown and Davis 1998, Moore et al. 1999). As a
response, particularly to decrease the threat of wildﬁre, forest
restoration via thinning has become a common management
practice, creating a range of tree stocking levels (basal areas)
across the landscape, so that the natural ﬁre regime can be
safely reintroduced (Covington 2003). Allen et al. (2002)
postulated that native species of plants and animals are
adapted to high levels of heterogeneity and diverse habitats
within the ponderosa pine ecosystem. Most thinning and
subsequent burning in ponderosa pine ecosystems increases
heterogeneity of forest structure and composition, which
should positively affect animal and plant biodiversity
(Mast et al. 1999, Noss et al. 2006, Kalies et al. 2010).
Predators are important in forest ecosystems in regulating
prey populations and indirectly affecting plant diversity,
productivity, abundance, and abiotic processes such as
erosion and nutrient cycling (Miller et al. 2001, Schmitz
2003, Ripple and Beschta 2006). Forest disturbances in other
regions can affect predators; for example, Jones et al. (2004)
found that prescribed ﬁre in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris)
reduced the presence of nesting raccoons (Procyon lotor), but
Cunningham et al. (2006) documented no long-term effect
of severe wildﬁre in Arizona, USA on abundance of coyotes
(Canis lupus) or gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus).
However, gray fox abundance did decrease immediately after
wildﬁre, recovering after 30 months (Cunningham et al.
2006). In Canada, weasels (Mustela sp.) were associated
with clearcuts, as were red fox (Vulpes vulpes), which pre-
ferred them over uncut stands (Thompson et al. 1989, Fisher
and Wilkinson 2005). In Spain, Mangas and Rodriguez-
Estival (2010) detected a negative effect of thinning on red
fox, but also found they ‘‘tolerated’’ land that had been
logged. Thus, it seems that some species of foxes may beneﬁt
from the intermediate level of disturbance caused by thin-
ning, but treatment effects are poorly understood for most
predators, and virtually no information exists on the presence
of predators found in ponderosa pine forests.
Wildlife monitoring is important in understanding the
overall success of restoration treatments in restoring ecosys-
tem composition, structure, and function (Block et al. 2001).

Top predators are often monitored as umbrella species,
because their presence and distribution indicates that prey
resources and, subsequently, vegetation and food availability,
are adequate (Caro and O’Doherty 1999, Sergio et al. 2006).
In this way, the presence of predators indicates that the food
web is functioning, although there is debate surrounding the
umbrella species concept (Andelman and Fagan 2000, Ozaki
et al. 2006). In monitoring predators, studies often attempt
to relate predator presence to habitat variables (i.e., Crocker-
Bedford 1990, Cunningham et al. 2003); however, predators
may be more closely linked to prey abundance and availability
(Polis and Strong 1996, O’Donoghue et al. 1997), a link that
is often ignored due to the difﬁculty in estimating prey
density in studies that are already time- and labor-intensive.
In ponderosa pine forests, thinning treatments generally have
positive effects on birds and small mammals (Converse et al.
2006, Hurteau et al. 2008, Kalies et al. 2010), but effects up
the food chain to mammalian predators are unknown.
In northern Arizona, mammalian nonhuman predators
found in ponderosa pine forests include striped skunk
(Mephitis mephitis), raccoon, badger (Taxidea taxus), ringtail
(Bassariscus astutus), long-tailed weasel (Mustela frenata),
bobcat (Lynx rufus), mountain lion (Puma concolor), coyote,
and gray fox. To detect predators, we used a traditional
method (track plates) combined with a more modern method
(motion-sensitive cameras), which are gaining popularity for
cost- and time-efﬁciency (O’Brien et al. 2010, Kays et al.
2011). We analyzed the data using occupancy modeling, a
new, rapid-assessment technique with lesser demands for
data compared with other methods (MacKenzie et al.
2006). We conducted the study in southwestern ponderosa
pine forests that were undergoing thinning treatments for
the purpose of ecological restoration. We used a concurrent
study on habitat relationships of small mammals to estimate
prey densities across our study (Kalies et al. 2012). We
hypothesized that forest structural conditions and prey den-
sity would be important variables in predicting predator
occupancy. Speciﬁcally, the objectives of this study were
to evaluate predator occurrence by 1) estimating detection
probabilities using 2 detection methodologies (track plates
and motion-sensitive cameras); 2) comparing costs of detec-
tion methodologies; 3) estimating probabilities of occupancy
across the study sites; 4) estimating probabilities of co-
occurrence between species; 5) quantifying the relative im-
portance of prey density and forest structure (represented by
basal area) in predicting occupancy; and 6) determining an
appropriate sample size for a more in-depth study of occu-
pancy in relation to habitat covariates. Our aim was to
provide information to inform both the design and imple-
mentation of ecological restoration treatments, and predator
monitoring efforts.
STUDY AREA
We conducted our study in the Coconino National Forest
and Arizona State Lands southwest of Flagstaff, Arizona
(3580903700N, 11184303400W). The area was approximately
5,000 ha dominated by ponderosa pine forest with inter-
spersed Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) and New Mexico
locust (Robinia neomexicana). Elevation ranged from 2,130
to 2,290 m with an average slope of 6.7%  6.4% (SD).
Monthly average temperatures during the sampling season
(Jun–Oct 2009) ranged from 78C to 208C and precipitation
from 0.5 cm to 2.5 cm over the 5-month span (Weather
Underground 2009). Across this landscape, we used sites
that were randomly chosen and sampled for prey density by
Kalies et al. (2012), and which were stratiﬁed over a range of
forest conditions from open structures (e.g., basal area of
10 m2/ha) to dense stands (e.g., basal area of 65 m2/ha). We
randomly chose 4 ‘‘routes’’ within this design to sample,
which for logistical reasons were groups of 8 sites located
within approximately 10 km of one another. We ensured
that sites were located 1 km apart to ensure spatial inde-
pendence (sensu O’Connell et al. 2006), although there is
evidence that spatial independence in detection using camera
traps can be achieved with as little as 20-m spacing (Kays
et al. 2011).
METHODS
Predator Sampling
To sample predators, we used motion-sensitive cameras and
track plates, which O’Connell et al. (2006) found were the
most effective detection methods for meso- and large mam-
mals. At each point, we placed 4 track plates 40 m from the
sample point in each of the cardinal directions (sensu Caro
2002). We adopted the design for enclosed track plates from
Zielinski and Kucera (1995), in which a piece of styrene
plastic was mounted to a plywood base to the following
dimensions: 76 cm  30.5 cm  30.5 cm, to construct a
half-cylindrical enclosure for the tracking surface. We placed
an insert, consisting of half contact paper and half ink surface
(constructed of a felt pad with a solution of carpenter’s chalk
and isopropyl alcohol in a 1:1 ratio) mounted on a piece of
styrene plastic (Orloff et al. 1993), inside each track-plate
enclosure. We assembled each track plate so the back was
against a tree or other barrier, allowing only one entrance.
We used 5 ml of canned ﬁsh to bait the track plates. We
collected tracks by attaching a piece of unlined white paper
to the contact paper, creating a permanent record of any
collected tracks from the ﬁeld (Glennon et al. 2002). We
identiﬁed tracks in the lab using a ﬁeld guide (Murie and
Elbroch 2005).
We placed Moultrie
1 Game Spy D-40 digital trail cameras
(Moultrie Feeders, Alabaster, AL) with motion-sensitive and
ﬂash technology 20 m from the sample point. Each camera
was aimed at bait (chicken liver, Gallus spp.) suspended from
a tree with twine and open plastic containers 10–15 m from
the camera. We sampled each point for up to 2 weeks,
visiting each point 2–4 times during the sampling period
to change bait, collect contact paper from track plates, per-
form maintenance, and download photographs. We recorded
costs of all equipment, materials, and time spent on each of
the track plate and camera methods.
Occupancy and Detection Covariates
We identiﬁed 2 covariates that we hypothesized would affect
occupancy (c) rates of predators: prey density and basal area.
Barrett et al.  Predator Occupancy Rates
233

To avoid overparameterizing our models, we did not include
additional covariates that described forest structure; however,
sites with low basal area were thinned, whereas sites with
higher basal area were either lightly thinned or unmanaged.
Basal area was also positively correlated with tree density and
canopy cover, and negatively correlated with understory
cover (Kalies et al. 2012). We calculated average basal
area of each 30-m pixel surrounding the point using a
geographic information system. Basal-area values were
extracted, using the buffer polygons, from a raster layer
(for a description of methods see Hampton et al. 2011) using
the Zonal Statistics function in ArcToolbox. We estimated
density for the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), golden-
mantled ground squirrel (Spermophilus lateralis), tassel-eared
squirrel (Sciurus aberti), Mexican woodrat (Neotoma mexi-
cana), Mogollon vole (Microtus mogollonensis), rock squirrel
(Spermophilus variegatus), gray-collared chipmunk (Tamias
cinereicollis), and pocket gopher (Thomomys bottae) using
trapping methodology and density models (Royle et al.
2005), as part of a concurrent study (Kalies et al. 2012).
We summed total prey density per site.
In addition, we identiﬁed 2 covariates that we hypothesized
would affect detection probability (p): survey (i.e., the survey
event during which we checked the site; 4 visits were con-
ducted/2-week sampling period) and week (i.e., the week
that data were collected over the course of the summer).
‘‘Survey’’ can inﬂuence species that might either become
more detectable over time, as they grow comfortable with
the equipment, or less so as they learn to fear the equipment
(Getz 1961). ‘‘Week’’ accounts for changes in detection due
to changes in weather or temperature, or biological processes
such as reproductive cycles of the animals (for example, if
pregnant F are less detectable) or juvenile dispersal. For
species that were detected using both track-plate and camera
methodology, we used ‘‘method’’ as a detection covariate to
determine which method resulted in a higher detection
probability. We standardized all continuous habitat and
detection covariates (dividing them by a constant value/
variable), and diagnosed univariate correlations using a stan-
dard correlation matrix; we observed no univariate correla-
tions >0.60.
Data Analysis
We used the single-season occupancy-modeling framework
of MacKenzie et al. (2006) to estimate detection probability,
deﬁned as the probability of detecting the species at a site if it
is present, and occupancy, deﬁned as the expected probability
that a given site is occupied, for each predator species. For
species that were detected using multiple methods (cameras
and track plates), we compared methods by modeling detec-
tion probabilities separately (using method as a covariate),
but combined detection histories for estimating occupancy
probabilities. Using our covariates, we built and analyzed 3
models per species using Program MARK (v.6.1, White and
Burnham, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO). For
each species, we included a univariate model for basal area
and prey density, and a null model that predicted detection or
occupancy probabilities based on no covariates (i.e., assuming
probabilities were constant across the sites). For each species,
we compared models using Akaike’s Information Criterion
adjusted for small sample sizes (AICc) and calculated AIC
weights (Burnham and Anderson 2002). We tested for
species co-occurrence by running a 2-species model for
each pair of predators and estimating w, deﬁned as the
probability that the area is occupied by both species, where
values <1 indicate that the species have a smaller probability
of co-occurring than expected under an assumption of
independence, and values >1 indicate a higher probability
of co-occurring (MacKenzie et al. 2006).
Using our ﬁeld-based estimates of occupancy and detec-
tion, we used GENPRES (v.4, U.S. Geological Survey,
Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, Laurel, MD) to simulate
the standard error (SE) of the occupancy rates based on
varying numbers of surveys and sites. In addition, using
our observed occupancy and detection probabilities and sim-
ulated covariates, we simulated occurrence data in Program
PRESENCE (v 4.0, U.S. Geological Survey, Patuxent
Wildlife Research Center) and examined models of occu-
pancy and detection using up to 5 occupancy covariates, to
determine whether models converged and provided reason-
able b estimates and standard errors.
RESULTS
Predator Sampling
We sampled each point for an average of 9  3 trapping
nights (‘‘survey’’; 293 total trapping nights over 33 sites). We
detected 1–4 predators at 20 of the 33 sample points. We
detected the gray fox (n ¼ 14 separate detections across 9
sample points), coyote (n ¼ 6 across 4 sample points), rac-
coon (n ¼ 6 detected across 3 sample points), and ringtail
(n ¼ 2 across 2 sample points). We detected gray fox,
raccoon, and ringtail with track plates, and gray fox and
coyote with cameras. Other animals detected included
mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), elk (Cervus canadensis),
common
ravens
(Corvus
corax),
and
turkey
vultures
(Cathartes aura) by camera; deer mice by track plates; and
golden-mantled ground squirrels, tassel-eared squirrels, and
gray-collared chipmunks by both methods. We estimated
that total costs of running the track plates were US$1,775 for
the track plates and US$993 for the cameras (including
equipment, materials, and wages for construction, ﬁeld
set-up and maintenance, and analysis time).
Predator Detection and Occupancy
Raccoons had the highest detection probability, and coyote,
gray fox, and ringtail had lower detection probabilities,
respectively (Table 1). A detection probability >0.20 builds
robust models of occupancy for a species (MacKenzie
et al. 2006); thus, we omitted the ringtail from further
analysis (p ¼ 0.03; Table 1). The most parsimonious
models of detection probability included week for the fox,
with no covariates inﬂuencing detection probability for the
other species (Table 2). We estimated a higher detection
probability for gray foxes using track plates than cameras
(ptrack plates ¼ 0.33, pcamera ¼ 0.28).

Wildlife Society Bulletin  36(2)

Across the study sites, gray fox had the highest occupancy
rate, followed by coyote and raccoon (Table 1). Based on
multimodel inference, we determined that no species had
strong associations with the 2 covariates we tested, because
all DAICc values were <4, indicating all models, including
the null model, had reasonable support (Table 2). The null
model performed best for both gray fox and raccoon, with
45% of the weight, but the model that included prey
density performed best for coyote, with 65% of the weight
(Table 2). Trends indicated by the direction of the occupancy
response for each variable showed that gray fox was nega-
tively associated with prey density and basal area, coyote was
positively associated with prey density and negatively associ-
ated with basal area, and raccoon was positively associated
with basal area and negatively associated with prey density.
Finally, we detected a low probability of co-occurrence be-
tween fox and coyote (w ¼ 0.15), but higher co-occurrence
between fox and raccoon (w ¼ 1.6), and coyote and raccoon
(w ¼ 1.7).
Study Design Simulations
Increasing the number of surveys decreased the standard
error of the occupancy estimates, with the greatest decrease
occurring between 4 (actual) and 5 visits (Fig. 1). However,
similar or greater decreases in standard error were achieved
by increasing the number of sites to 40 or greater (Fig. 1). In
addition, in running models with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 cova-
riates for the raccoon (which had the lowest estimate of
occupancy) for sample sizes of 33, 40, 50, 75, and 100, we
found that models did not properly converge unless the
sample size included 75 sites.
DISCUSSION
Effectiveness and Efficiency of Detection Methodologies
Track plate and motion-sensitive camera technology have
become common techniques for detecting medium-sized
predators (Caro 2002, Glennon et al. 2002, O’Connell
et al. 2006). In this study, we were able to obtain detection
probabilities high enough (>0.20) to produce robust models
of occupancy for the gray fox, coyote, and raccoon.
O’Connell et al. (2006) found that 6–7 visits (deﬁned
as weeks) were appropriate for detecting raccoons, but
>12 visits were required to conﬁrm coyote occupancy. We
conducted fewer visits (an average of 9 days) and produced
higher detection probabilities. However, increased numbers
of site visits would have resulted in higher detection proba-
bilities and, thus, more robust models of occupancy for the
ringtail, which is rare in Arizona ponderosa pine forests due
to its afﬁnity for permanent water and riparian areas (Taylor
1954, Gonzales 1997) as well as for elk and mule deer, which
were also detected at low numbers. More site visits may also

have allowed us to detect other rare predators such as the
badger, long-tailed weasel, and bobcat.
In trying to assess predator diversity, both of our detection
methods were necessary because we detected coyotes only
with cameras, and raccoons and ringtails only with track
plates. O’Connell et al. (2006) found that most species
(including raccoons) could be detected with cameras, and
we would recommend attempting this simpler methodology,
but with a greater variety of bait. For example, ﬁsh make up a
signiﬁcant portion of the diet of ringtails and raccoons
(Taylor 1954, Gonzales 1997); therefore, using canned
ﬁsh in addition to the chicken liver as an attractant for
the
camera
traps
may
have
been
more
productive.
However, species such as ringtails and weasels may prefer
track plates due to the cover they provide (Hoffmeister 1986,
O’Connell et al. 2006). Another option is hair traps, where
animals enter a box similar to that of a track plate, hair is
snared, and genetic analysis is used to identify the species.
We did not use this methodology because O’Connell et al.
(2006) found that it was generally less effective than cameras
or track plates for detecting predators.
We compared costs of the 3 methods. Although the track
plates cost about US$88/site (4 plates), we also estimated
US$45/site in construction time in wages, making the total
cost for track plates US$133/site. Cameras are cheaper at
US$107/site (1 camera) as well as in ﬁeld set-up time and
analysis (15 min total/site). Track plates require more time
in the ﬁeld for set-up and maintenance, plus more time
analyzing the tracks (45 min total/site). In addition, the
track plates tend to become structurally compromised over
time, and we found that after our ﬁeld season (33 sites) the
plates were unusable. Hair traps are by far the cheapest
method in terms of equipment and materials at US$9/site
(2/site; Pauli et al. 2008), but cost US$50/sample for genetic
analysis (Tredick et al. 2007). Thus, while start-up costs of
equipment are higher for track plates and cameras (about
US$1,000/method to build and/or buy equipment for 10
sites, compared with US$100 for hair traps), the analysis
costs are lowest for cameras (at US$375 for 100 sites),
followed by track plates (US$1,500 for 100 sites) and lastly
hair traps (>US$5,000 assuming 100 samples collected at
100 sites). The more sites that are sampled, the more efﬁcient
cameras become.
Thus, multiple detection methods will increase the diver-
sity of species detected, but using speciﬁc methods that target
species of interest will be most time- and cost-effective. In
addition, the method chosen will depend on the question,
because genetic hair sampling can best identify individuals,
but may be more information than is needed for studies
of occupancy (as long as independence among sites can be
achieved). We conclude that motion-sensitive camera
methodology is most time- and cost-effective for detecting
predators, when coupled with occupancy modeling.
Predator Occupancy
We produced robust models of occupancy for 3 species of
predators that have not previously been quantiﬁed in ponder-
osa pine forests. Our sampling was limited to the summer
season (Jun–Oct) and, thus, our occupancy rates do not
reﬂect seasonal or annual variation, although season variation
in habitat use is probably minimal for gray foxes, coyotes, and
raccoons (Haroldson and Fritzell 1984, Gese et al. 1988,
Kamler and Gipson 2003). Compared with the only other
study on occupancy rates of similar predators, which took
place on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA (O’Connell et al.
2006), we found lower occupancy rates of coyotes and rac-
coons and similar rates of gray fox compared with red fox,
supporting the inference that dry southwestern conifer for-
ests may be less productive systems, supporting fewer pred-
ators, than those in wetter parts of the United States
(MacArthur 1960, Burns and Honkala 1990, Moir 1992).
Although our estimates of occupancy and detection were
reasonably precise for the 3 species (<0.2 SE), our ability to
predict occupancy using covariates was weak, because all
models in our analysis had support (DAICc < 4); thus, we
can only discuss trends suggested by our data. Gray foxes had
the highest estimate of occupancy of the 3 species detected.
We detected a negative association with basal area, which is
supported by the literature that indicates that foxes do not
prefer dense forest (Thompson et al. 1989), but may instead
be associated with intermediate levels of disturbance, such as
thinning or postﬁre forests (Cunningham et al. 2006,
Mangas and Rodriguez-Estival 2010), and open, brushy
woodlands (Fritzell and Haroldson 1982). However, our
lack of a strong model may be because we did not measure
other habitat features important to gray foxes, such as grass
density for cover while hunting, or rock outcrops for denning
habitat (Hoffmeister 1986). We also found that prey density
had the least predictive ability, which may be because foxes
prey on a variety of items, with small mammals comprising
<40% of their diet (Major and Sherburne 1987, Harrison
1997, Cunningham et al. 2006).
Coyote occupancy was most strongly associated with prey
density, which was expected because most of the coyote diet
comes from small mammals (as much as 40–100%), while a
smaller amount consists of carrion and vegetative material
(Hoffmeister 1986, Cunningham et al. 2006). Although our
model that included basal area had weak support, we detected
a negative association of coyote occupancy with basal area.
Coyotes use a variety of vegetation types, but require open
vegetative cover for daytime rest and nocturnal hunting and
also use open-canopy logged sites (Andelt and Andelt 1981).
Fedriani et al. (2000) found that coyotes preyed on gray
foxes and that there was a negative relationship between gray
fox and coyote abundances in the Santa Monica Mountains
of California, USA. Similarly, in Maine (USA), Major and
Sherburne (1987) found that coyotes tended to be associated
with conifer forests, while fox were found in deciduous
forests, and there was little overlap in their occurrence.
This is supported by our study, in which we found a low
probability of species co-occurrence between gray fox and
coyote.
Raccoon occupancy was best predicted by the null model.
The raccoon’s diet is opportunistic and varied, including ﬁsh,
invertebrates, berries, fruits and nuts, birds, carrion, and
small mammals (Hoffmeister 1986), and we found that
236

the model that included prey density had the least support.
We found a stronger trend of raccoon occupancy with in-
creased basal area. Habitat requirements of raccoons are
poorly understood in forests. Some studies found an associa-
tion with tree density and snags (Kennedy et al. 1991,
Gonzales 1997), which our results support; however,
Chamberlain et al. (2003) found they were common in
mature forest as well as earlier successional stages. They
are also thought to be closely associated with water
(Hoffmeister 1986, Kennedy et al. 1991). Raccoons may,
therefore, be generalists with an ability to capitalize on
fragmented landscapes and a variety of habitat types; hence,
their success in human-dominated areas (Pedlar et al. 1997,
Chamberlain et al. 2003). Additional covariates such as
distance to water, or including bird species in our prey
measurements, may have increased our ability to predict
raccoon occupancy.
Sample Design Simulations
One purpose of an occupancy-modeling pilot study is to
determine the number of sites and surveys required to achieve
the desired level of bias and precision for the estimates of
occupancy and/or detection. In this study, we were most
interested in estimates of occupancy and the effects of cova-
riates related to habitat and prey; however, although we could
produce reasonably precise estimates of detection and occu-
pancy, our models were not robust enough to accommodate
covariates. Although a general rule of thumb regarding
logistic models is that 10 observations are needed per
variable (Peduzzi et al. 1996), in which case we should
have been able to investigate 3 covariates in our models,
low occupancy rates can compromise the ability of the model
to handle covariates (MacKenzie et al. 2002). Based on our
simulations, we concluded that increasing the number of
surveys would provide modest increases in precision of
occupancy estimates, but increasing the number of sites
would be most beneﬁcial in both increasing occupancy pre-
cision and allowing for the analysis of covariates (Guillera-
Arroita et al. 2010). In our speciﬁc example, simulations
indicated that 75 sites is a good target for accommodating up
to 5 covariates. We recommend use of a pilot study to create
a sampling design for similar species that occur at low
occupancy rates.
MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS
Predators can be assessed at large spatial scales using
occupancy approaches, which may be more time- and
cost-efﬁcient
than
traditional
methods,
particularly
if
motion-sensitive
cameras
are
used
for
monitoring.
Thinning treatments (e.g., fuels reduction treatments) may
have positive effects on gray foxes and coyotes, but negative
effects on raccoons. However, our inability to develop strong
models that predicted predator occupancy indicates that
higher sample sizes and more habitat covariates (i.e., more
sites, approximately 75 to accommodate up to 5 covariates)
are needed. Although we could not prove that the prey
covariate was important in predicting predator occupancy,
we also can not dismiss it; thus, further research is needed
on the relationships between prey density and predator
occurrence. Although our approach using small mammal
traps may be prohibitively expensive for many projects, we
recommend experimentation with faster methods (camera
traps are one promising alternative; see De Bondi et al.
2010). Finally, we recommend using a similar pilot study
approach in designing studies to assess predator occupancy in
other systems.
