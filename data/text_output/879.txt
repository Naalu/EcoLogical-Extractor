Abstract
Our study used allozyme analyses to evaluate potential impacts of ecological
restoration treatments on genetic diversity of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa var.
scopulorum) populations within the Fort Valley Experimental Forest near Flagstaff, AZ.
Allele frequencies varied among pre-settlement clumps, with trees more closely related to
each other within clumps. This clumpy spatial stand structure typical of reference condi-
tions thus represents ‘‘genetic neighborhoods’’ and suggests restoration of clumpy versus
more evenly dispersed trees in naturally regenerating stands will protect evolutionary
genetic patterns. Compared to pre-settlement populations, post-settlement trees had
slightly greater heterozygosity, and allelic richness and allele frequencies varied between
these two age groups. These genetic differences could have resulted from different
selective conditions under which the two age groups became established. Genetic diversity
of populations created using different selection criteria for residual post-settlement trees
did not vary but simulated removal of 75% of post-settlement trees decreased allelic
richness. Maintaining more clumps created from post-settlement populations with higher
tree densities across the landscape would be more effective at conserving allelic richness.
Overall results of this study indicate use of genetic structure and diversity can help guide
restoration treatments to help ensure adaptive potential is conserved.

Introduction
Genetic diversity enables tree species and populations to respond to changing environ-
mental conditions (Ledig 1986; Ledig and Kitzmiller 1992) and in some species it helps
maintain individual ﬁtness and facilitates physiological adaptation to heterogeneous
environments (Linhart and Mitton 1985). Forest management objectives that can enhance
the ability of species to respond to changing conditions thus requires conservation of
genetic diversity (Namkoong 1992; Dumroese et al. 2015; Jacobs et al. 2015; Wheeler
et al. 2015). Incorporation of genetic considerations into management and restoration of
natural forests is complex and typically genetic considerations are not being adequately (or
at all) addressed even though silvicultural decisions can alter genetic diversity of tree
species (Buchert et al. 1997; Ratnam et al. 2014). For example, silvicultural prescriptions
that reduce population sizes can negatively affect mating systems and allele frequencies in
a variety of conifer species, including loss of rare alleles that could contribute to the future
adaptability of stands (Yazdani and Lindgren 1992; El-Kassaby and Jaquish 1996; Buchert
et al. 1997; Adams et al. 1998; El-Kassaby 2000). Consequences of negative genetic
effects resulting from changes in population sizes can include genetic bottlenecks, loss of
genetic variation, and accumulation of deleterious mutations (genetic load) which can
cause loss of ﬁtness in residual stands if species are intolerant to inbreeding (El-Kassaby
2000; Ratnam et al. 2014).
Changes in population sizes are commonly prescribed in ecological restoration projects.
For example, ecological restoration of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.)
forests in the southwestern US (var. scopulorum Engelm.) includes large reductions in
stand density to restore the clumpy, open-grown, park-like stand structures that charac-
terized the evolutionary environment historically maintained by frequent ﬁre (Covington
et al. 1997; Abella et al. 2007). Many prescriptions recommend removal of 85–95% of the
trees established after Euro-American settlement while all trees established prior to set-
tlement are retained (e.g., Covington et al. 1997; Roccaforte et al. 2010; Reynolds et al.
2013). While these thinning treatments have improved health and resilience of these
southwestern forests to stresses such as high ﬁre intensity and drought (Covington et al.
2001; Fule´ et al. 2012; Roccaforte et al. 2015; Thomas and Waring 2015), removing most
of an age group(s) can signiﬁcantly alter genetic diversity of the residual stand if genetic
differences among age groups exists, particularly when the age group being removed
signiﬁcantly contributes to the genetically effective population size. Genetic differences at
the allozyme level have been demonstrated to occur among age groups within populations
of P. ponderosa var. scopulorum (Mitton et al. 1977; Linhart et al. 1981a; Beckman and
Mitton 1984) and other conifer species (Roberds and Conkle 1984).
Reductions in stand densities do not always cause dysgenic effects (Neale 1985; Adams
et al. 1998; Ratnam et al. 2014) and different species vary in their responses to changes in
genetic architecture due to variation in their ecological and life history traits. The degree to
which genetic diversity is being conserved or restored during ecological restoration efforts
is largely unknown. The goal of ecological restoration is to assist the return of an
ecosystem to a healthy evolutionary trajectory (SER 2004), and since trajectories are
shifting due to climate change (Newton and Cantarello 2015), genetic conservation must be
incorporated into ecological restoration treatments (Noss et al. 2006; Dumroese et al. 2015;
Jacobs et al. 2015; Stanturf 2015). Unfortunately, genetic diversity is underutilized and
usually only addressed where restoration treatments involve supplementation or replace-
ment of species during regeneration efforts (e.g., see reviews by Bozzano et al. 2014;
New Forests
123

Mijangos et al. 2015; Espeland et al. 2016). The purpose of this study was to determine if
genetic diversity was being conserved during ecological restoration of ponderosa pine
stand structure in the southwestern US. The speciﬁc objectives were to (1) quantify genetic
diversity of pre-settlement clumps to determine if the clumpy spatial structure also had a
genetic component, (2) compare pre- to post-settlement age groups to determine if
removing most of the latter age group affected genetic diversity of the residual stand, and
(3) compare genetic diversity of different post-settlement thinning prescriptions to deter-
mine if residual stands differed genetically.
Methods
Study site and tree selection
Five sites within the USDA Forest Service Fort Valley Experimental Forest located
approximately 15 km north of Flagstaff, Arizona were used in this study. The sites varied
in size and stand density (Table 1), but were within 2–3 km of each other with similar
topography, elevation, precipitation, climate, and soil composition (Covington et al. 1997;
Mast et al. 1999; Fule´ et al. 2001) to minimize potential genetic differences due to isolation
by distance or different growing conditions. All sites had comparable understory vegeta-
tion composition and overstory stand structure characterized by extremely dense ‘‘dog-
hair’’ thickets consisting of saplings (dbh \ 13 cm) and pole-sized trees (13–40 cm dbh),
along with scattered clumps of pre-settlement trees (22–105 cm dbh). No management
activities had occurred on any of the ﬁve sites in the decade prior to the study except for
several prescribed burns on site E, and all sites had experienced livestock and/or wildlife
grazing and ﬁre exclusion (except site E) since 1876.
All sites had at least eight clumps of pre-settlement trees, with the clumps studied
having distinct boundaries containing at least ﬁve trees and no more than three trees
removed by logging as indicated by visual observation of stumps. Pre-settlement trees were
distinguishable by their aggregation in clumps and yellow bark typical of old ponderosa
pine. For each site, genetic diversity was quantiﬁed for four types of populations: (1) pre-
settlement clumps, (2) randomly selected pre-settlement trees existing as individuals, (3)
randomly selected post-settlement trees, and (4) post-settlement trees selected using
restoration guidelines of 1.5-3.0 ‘‘leave’’ trees per pre-settlement stump. Using maps, each
site was divided into roughly equal northeast, southeast, southwest and northwest quad-
rants and within each quadrant, one pre-settlement clump was randomly selected. Four
transects were established that connected the four pre-settlement clumps in each quadrant
along east–west and north–south lines (Fig. 1). Six pre-settlement trees existing as indi-
viduals and six post-settlement trees existing as individuals were randomly selected along
each transect. In addition, three pre-settlement remnant stumps at approximately equal
intervals were located along each transect and two post-settlement trees were selected from
within a 9.1 m search radius of each stump according to the restoration phenotypic criteria
described by Covington et al. (2001). These ‘‘leave’’ trees were those that would be
retained in a 1.5–3.0 ‘‘leave’’ trees per stump thinning prescription for restoring historic
clumpy stand structures in stands following restoration thinning. A schematic of the
sampling design is illustrated in Fig. 1. All sampled pre- and post-settlement trees were
cored and dated to verify their ages.

The sample size for all population types was 24 trees per site for a total of 120 across all
ﬁve sites, except the sample size for trees within pre-settlement clumps varied because the
number of trees per clump differed. Although small, a sample size of 24 trees per popu-
lation is considered adequate to describe allozyme-based population genetic diversity of
conifers (Goncharenko et al. 1995; El-Kassaby and Jaquish 1996; Lee et al. 2000). Nev-
ertheless, the small sample size and use of allozymes as markers represent a conservative
estimate of overall genetic diversity in this study. In addition to comparing different
populations of post-settlement trees based on different selection criteria (randomly selected
versus restoration ‘‘leave’’ trees), each of the 24 randomly selected post-settlement tree
populations was ‘‘thinned’’ by 50 and 75% using methods and sample sizes similar to those
of Nijensohn et al. (2005). A random number generator was used to eliminate trees from
the population to simulate potential genetic diversity of residual stands after ecological
restoration thinning prescriptions. Each ‘‘thinning’’ was randomly done 25 times per site to
create simulated residual stands of N = 180 and 150, representing thinning treatments of
50 and 75%, respectively, per site. Although genetic diversity of the original populations of
24 trees per site may not represent all of the diversity present, the simulated residual stands
based on this genetic diversity can still provide a useful rough estimate of potential changes
following thinning (Nijensohn et al. 2005).
Allozyme analyses
Dormant vegetative buds were collected and used for the allozyme analyses. Standard
operating procedures described in NFGEL (2000) and Conkle et al. (1982) were used for
the allozyme analyses which were conducted by the co-author (Kolanoski) at the National
Forest Genetics Laboratory (NFGEL, USDA Forest Service, Placerville, CA). Twenty-
three loci were examined using 15 enzyme systems: LAP-2 (leucine aminopeptidase),

isomerase), ADH (alcohol dehydrogenase), CAT-1,2 (catalase), UGPP (uridine diphos-
phoglucose pyrophosphorylase), GOT-1,2,3 (glutamateoxaloacetate transaminase), SOD
(superoxide dismutase), G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), IDH (isocitrate
dehydrogenase), MDH-1,2,3 (malate dehydrogenase), 6PGD-2 (phosphogluconate dehy-
drogenase), SKD-1,2 (shikimic acid dehydrogenase), and FDP (fructose-1,6-diphosphate
dehydrogenase). Mendelian inheritance for most of these loci in ponderosa pine has been
reported previously (Mitton et al. 1979; O’Malley et al. 1979). Only 11 of the 23 loci
(PGM-1, ME, PGI-2, ADH, UGPP,GOT-1, GOT-3, G6PD, MDH-2, SKD-1, 2) from 10 of
the 15 enzyme systems were polymorphic according to a 95% criterion, and these were
used to calculate all genetic diversity measures (except for percentage of polymorphic loci)
and to perform all genetic analyses.
Statistical analyses
The Tools for Population Genetic Analysis (TFPGA) computer program (version 1.3,
Miller 1997) was used to calculate HE [unbiased expected heterozygosity according to Nei
(1978)], HO (observed heterozygosity), and P (percentage of polymorphic loci). TFPGA
performed exact tests for testing deviations of genotypic distributions from Hardy–
Weinberg (H–W) expectations and estimated p-values using the Monte-Carlo method (Guo
and Thompson 1992). Exact tests for population differentiation using a contingency
table approach were used to determine if allele frequencies among groups of individuals
were signiﬁcantly different from each other. TFPGA approximated the exact probability of
the observed differences in allele frequencies according to the methods described in
Raymond and Rousset (1995). The number of alleles per locus (A), effective number of
alleles per locus (Ae), and the total number of alleles (AT) were computed using Popgene
(version 1.31, Yeh et al. 1997). These allelic measures in addition to the other three
standard genetic diversity parameters (HE, HO, and P) and allelic frequencies were used to
compare genetic diversity among the different types of populations.
SAS JMP version 4.0.3 (SAS 2001) was used to perform analysis of variance (ANOVA)
to examine differences in HE, HO, A, and Ae as a function of loci marker, age group or
population type (pre-settlement, randomly selected and restoration ‘‘leave’’ post-settlement
trees), and site. ANOVA was also used to test if signiﬁcant differences for the same
standard genetic diversity measures existed among pre-settlement clumps on each of ﬁve
sites with clumps being the only factor in the model. Also, means of P and AT from all sites
were compared among clumps and populations using one-way ANOVA. If the overall
model was signiﬁcant for any of the six diversity measures, individual t-tests for deﬁned
contrasts (among populations on each site or among populations from all sites) were
performed. A Bonferroni correction was applied to adjust for the number of contrasts
performed for each diversity measure (Weir 1996). Wilcoxson/Kruskal–Wallis (Rank
Sums) nonparametric tests were used as a check against ANOVA results if normality or
skewness of data was in question. All tests for signiﬁcance were performed using an alpha
level of 0.05.
Popgene was used to calculate FIS, FST and gene ﬂow (Nm) for pre-settlement clumps on
each site and over all ﬁve sites to characterize possible genetic differences that could result
from changes in heterozygosity due to nonrandom mating within a clump, proportion of
genetic variation attributable to allele frequency differences among clumps, and number of
migrants exchanged among clumps each generation, respectively. Nm was estimated using
FST values as described in Slatkin and Barton (1989). This indirect measure of Nm was
used because it is a good estimate of past migration in ponderosa pine (Latta 2006). Exact

tests were also performed to detect allele frequency differences among clumps on each site
and among all 20 clumps on ﬁve sites simultaneously. FIS was compared among randomly
selected and restoration ‘‘leave’’ post-settlement trees to determine if selecting replacement
trees according to restoration guidelines affected the degree of nonrandom mating within
the post-settlement age group. T-tests were used to determine if mean FIS for each group
differed statistically from zero, which would indicate signiﬁcant inbreeding. Note that a
negative difference from zero would indicate an excess of heterozygotes.
Nei’s unbiased genetic distances for pairwise combinations of populations (Nei 1972)
within each and over all study sites were computed by TFPGA to evaluate the relationship
between genetic and geographic distance of clumps on each site. These measures were also
calculated to determine the extent of genetic dissimilarity among pre- and post-settlement
age groups and among randomly selected and restoration ‘‘leave’’ post-settlement trees.
Unbiased estimates (Nei 1978) were used because sample sizes of compared populations
were less than 50 (Hedrick 2000). T-tests were used to ascertain if distances were sig-
niﬁcantly different from zero.
The different genetic parameters and statistical tests described above were also calcu-
lated and compared among the randomly selected unthinned post-settlement population,
and the 50 and 75% simulated thinned residual post-settlement populations. In addition to
the genetic measures, maximum genetic multiplicity (Gm), hypothetical gametic diversity
(Vgam) and latent genetic potential (LP) were calculated to estimate potential genetic
diversity changes in the residual stands due to simulated thinning (Gregorius 1980;
Bergmann et al. 1990; Buchert et al. 1997). GM is the product of the number of genotypes
that can exist for a particular number of alleles over all loci (P [ni(ni - 1)/2] where
n = number of alleles at a locus) and estimates potential genotypic diversity. Vgam is the
product of all single locus diversities (i.e., Ae) over the loci considered and estimates
diversity that would result from given allelic frequencies at loci if all were in linkage
equilibrium and indicates gene pool diversity in relation to gene frequency. LP is the
difference between total number of alleles and the effective number of alleles summed over
all loci. LP was used to estimate the degree to which stands are able to adapt evolutionarily
(Bergmann et al. 1990; Buchert et al. 1997; Gregorius 1980; Nijensohn et al. 2005).
Equations used were from Bergmann et al. (1990), Buchert et al. (1997), and Gregorius
(1980). Gm and Vgam were population calculations while LP was computed for each locus
for each population and population LPs were determined by summing LPs over all loci
considered. Statistical comparisons for Gm and Vgam were made among populations over
the ﬁve sites using Wilcoxon/Kruskal–Wallis nonparametric tests, while LPs of popula-
tions were compared within each site using Wilcoxon Sign-Ranked t-tests following the
methods of Bergmann et al. (1990) and Buchert et al. (1997).
Results
Tree age and diameter
Pre-settlement trees from all ﬁve sites averaged 157 years older than post-settlement trees,
and had diameters 3–5 times larger than randomly selected post-settlement trees and about
2 times larger than restoration ‘‘leave’’ post-settlement trees (Table 1). On average, ran-
domly selected post-settlement trees were younger by approximately 10 years and had
1.5–2.0 times smaller diameters than restoration ‘‘leave’’ post-settlement trees (Table 1).

Pre-settlement genetic diversity
Pre-settlement clumps within and between all sites had similar values for HE, HO, A, Ae,
AT, and P (Table 2) and none of these diversity measures differed statistically among
clumps or sites. In addition, there were no signiﬁcant interactions in these analyses. Overall
Ho values of clumps were relatively high but not signiﬁcantly different from HE expected
under H–W equilibrium for all sites (Table 2), and comparisons among all 20 clumps
pooled over sites detected no signiﬁcant differences among clumps for the number of loci
with genotypic proportions deviating from H–W equilibrium (Fig. 2). In contrast to the
lack of differences among clumps in genetic diversity, allele frequencies differed
(p \ 0.0001) among clumps on sites B, C, and E, and loci whose allele frequencies
differed were not consistent across sites (Site B: GOT-1, Site C: ADH, UGPP and GOT-3,
Site E: PGI-2 and G6PD) which resulted in a signiﬁcant interaction (p \ 0.05). Although
FST values for clumps did not differ within or among sites, all values were signiﬁcantly
different from zero (p \ 0.0038 within sites, p \ 0.0001 across sites) (Table 3); supporting
the ﬁnding of signiﬁcant variation in allele frequencies among clumps. Genetic distance
(D) was not correlated to geographic distance for clumps on any site (data not shown);
clumps that were separated by larger geographic distances were not more genetically
distinct than clumps located closer together. Except for Site B, FIS for clumps varied
signiﬁcantly from zero and no signiﬁcant differences in FIS were detected among sites
(Table 3). Although the majority of individual loci showed a deﬁciency of heterozygotes
according to H–W equilibrium within clumps on all sites, some loci (2–5 loci depending on
the site) had negative FIS values, suggesting an excess of heterozygotes at those loci.
Estimates of gene ﬂow did not vary among clumps or sites (Table 3).
Pre-settlement versus post-settlement genetic diversity
Although differences were not statistically signiﬁcant between populations of randomly
selected pre- and post-settlement trees, all genetic diversity measures tended to be higher in
the post-settlement populations (Table 4). Overall, both age groups had approximately 6 of
11 loci whose genotypic frequencies agreed with H–W proportions (Fig. 2). The mean
genetic distance between pre- and post-settlement trees ranged from 0.0310 to 0.0872 with
95% conﬁdence (Table 5), and signiﬁcant differences in allele frequencies were found
among the age groups. Every site had at least one locus where allele frequencies differed
among pre- and post-settlement populations, but not all sites had the same loci with
statistically different allele frequencies among the two age groups and the locus by site
interaction was signiﬁcant (p \ 0.05). When combining data from ﬁve sites, allele fre-
quencies varied signiﬁcantly for ADH, GOT-1, and SKD-2 among the pre- and post-
settlement trees.
Randomly selected versus restoration ‘‘leave’’ post-settlement genetic
diversity
Signiﬁcant differences were not found between randomly selected and restoration ‘‘leave’’
post-settlement trees for any of the genetic diversity parameters calculated (Table 4). The
mean genetic distance between these two population types ranged from 0.0017 to 0.0197
with 95% conﬁdence (Table 5). These mean genetic distances were signiﬁcantly smaller
than those between pre- and post-settlement age groups. Also, no signiﬁcant allele

the only locus that had different allele frequencies among groups for sites A and D. When
data were combined from the ﬁve sites, two loci (GOT-1, SKD-2) were found to have
signiﬁcantly different allele frequencies among the two post-settlement groups. In general,
FIS values were statistically different from zero for both post-settlement groups on the

increased slightly when compared to the randomly selected un-thinned post-settlement and
individual pre-settlement populations (Fig. 2). Allelic richness measures (A, Ae, AT) and P
were also not signiﬁcantly affected by 50% simulated thinning, however the variation
around the mean values decreased for these measures (Table 4). Results of the 75%
simulated thinning were consistent with the 50% thinning except AT was signiﬁcantly
reduced at each site and overall (p \ 0.0001) (Table 4; Fig. 3), and the mean number of
loci in H–W equilibrium increased (Fig. 2). In addition, variances around the mean values
were reduced approximately 30, 70 and 65% for Ae, AT and P, respectively for the 75%
thinning (Table 4). These reductions are likely the result of how populations were created
by performing multiple random thinning simulations.

Allele frequencies of both ‘‘thinned’’ groups did not differ from the un-thinned post-
settlement group but allele frequencies of both ‘‘thinned’’ groups differed signiﬁcantly
from the pre-settlement group. Differences also occurred for ADH, GOT-1 and SKD-2 on
all sites for the 75% thinned population. Genetic distances and FIS values did not change
signiﬁcantly between any of the groups, although FIS values were signiﬁcantly different
from zero (Tables 5, 6). Genic multiplicity (GM) signiﬁcantly decreased at 75% thinning
and although Vgam and LP tended to decrease, they were not signiﬁcantly changed by
either simulated thinning prescription (Table 7). Alleles lost as thinning intensity increased
tended to be the rare or low frequency alleles (data not shown).
Discussion
Genetic structure of pre-settlement clumps
Heterozygosity values in the Fort Valley Experimental Forest were greater than those
reported in previous ponderosa pine research (e.g., Conkle 1992; Woods et al. 1983) most
likely due to different numbers of polymorphic loci included in the different studies. The
relatively high heterozygosity values of pre-settlement clumps at Fort Valley are expected
given high rates of pollen dispersal that have been reported for ponderosa pine and other
outcrossing conifer species (Mitton et al. 1977; Linhart et al. 1981a; Hamrick et al. 1992).
Despite apparent high rates of outcrossing, most loci within pre-settlement clumps in the
present study displayed excessive homozygosity on all sites, which is indicative of
restricted neighborhood sizes and results in family structuring (Cheliak et al. 1985; Thomas
et al. 1999). This formation of neighborhoods of genetically-related individuals in species
with high pollen ﬂow has been documented in other studies of ponderosa pine (Linhart
et al. 1981a; Latta et al. 1998) as well as in a variety of other pine species including Pinus
strobus L. (Nijensohn et al. 2005; Jones et al. 2006), P. ﬂexilis James (Schuster and Mitton
2000), P. pinaster Ait. (de-Lucas et al. 2009), P. halepensis Mill. (Shohami and Nathan
2014), P. banksiana Lamb., and P. contorta Dougl. ex. Loudon (Cheliak et al. 1985), P.

albicaulis Engelm. (Richardson et al. 2002), P. balfouriana Balf. (Eckert et al. 2010), and
P. jeffreyi Balf. (Stephens and Fry 2005). Similar patterns of ﬁne-scale spatial genetic
structure (SGS) in species with high outcrossing rates have also been reported in other
conifer species including Tsuga mertensiana (Bong.) Carr. (Ally and Ritland 2007), Thuja

occidentalis L. (Pandey and Rajora 2012), and angiosperms such as oak (Quercus) species
(Dutech et al. 2005; Jones et al. 2006; Hampe et al. 2010; Deacon and Cavender-Bares
2015), and beech (Fagus) species (Piotti et al. 2013). While reports of SGS somewhat
depend on the spatial scale being examined and marker system used (Richardson et al.
2002; Viard et al. 2001), the explanation for development of SGS at ﬁne-spatial scales in
the wind pollinated species listed above is limited seed dispersal (Epperson 2003). While
pollen is considered to be the primary agent of gene ﬂow between and within populations
in most conifers, limited seed movement in many species creates mosaics of kin-structured
neighborhood clumps comprised of half-siblings, full-siblings and parent-progeny, with
selection often reducing the number of selfed individuals (Sorenson and Miles 1982; Latta
et al. 1998).
Although the majority of pine species have relatively small, winged seeds that use wind
as their primary dispersal mechanism (Greene and Johnson 1993), species with interme-
diate sized seeds such as ponderosa pine rely on secondary dispersal by scatter-hoarding
(or seed caching) rodents and birds (Tomback and Linhart 1990; Vander Wall 2008).
Dispersal of related seeds away from the parent tree to cache areas by animals (which
averages 25 m in pine species) can increase genetic structure on a relatively ﬁne scale
within populations. When related cached seeds that are not retrieved survive and regen-
erate, they create new clusters of kin-related individuals (Rogers et al. 1999; Jones et al.
2006; Vander Wall 2008). Although the seed mass where secondary dispersal by animals
contributes signiﬁcantly to total dispersal of genetic material is unknown (Vander Wall
2008), this type of dispersal is especially common in semi-arid habitats where seed burial
by animals can help seedlings survive summer droughts (Johnson et al. 2003).
A combination of limited seed movement created by seeds dropping below parent trees
within existing tree clusters along with kin-structured clusters created by scatter-hoarding
animals likely created the genetic neighborhoods within the clumpy stand structure in Fort
Valley pre-settlement populations. Scatter-hoarding dispersers have been observed to
repeatedly move seed from their maternal origin to the same new cache (Vander Wall
2008). The surviving regeneration cluster would create a new genetic neighborhood if
enough individuals within the cluster could survive low intensity ﬁres. In contrast, indi-
viduals originating from seeds dispersed away from the protection of clumps may not have
been able to survive these historically frequent surface ﬁres. Evidence suggests that clumps
at Fort Valley do not represent even-aged groups of trees (White 1985) but instead consist
of related individuals that became established in different years when conditions were
favorable (Linhart 1988).
The degree of allelic differentiation found among Fort Valley clumps separated by only
10–40 m was comparable to genetic differences and distances reported by Linhart et al.

(1981a) among genetically dissimilar ponderosa pine clumps near Boulder, CO. Similar
spatial genetic structure occurring within the geographic distances among clumps found in
our study have also been reported for other pine species (e.g., Nijensohn et al. 2005;
Pazouki et al. 2016) and angiosperms such as Quercus rubra L. (Jones et al. 2006) and
Fagus sylvatica L. (Piotti et al. 2013). The FST values among clumps at Fort Valley are
also consistent with other reports for ponderosa pine and other conifer species (Hamrick
et al. 1992; Parchman et al. 2011), and further support presence of genetic dissimilarity
among kin-structured clumps despite Nm estimates that should be adequate to maintain
genetic relatedness among the clumps (Ellstrand 1992). Apparently, gene ﬂow among
clumps in Fort Valley is not sufﬁcient to overcome the family structure created by half and
full siblings and parent-progeny kin relationships existing within individual clumps.
Espeland et al. (2016) describe evolutionarily-informed restoration practices as those
that preserve genetic patterns of variation found in natural populations. Since the clumpy
spatial structure of pre-settlement stands of ponderosa pine appears to also have genetic
structure, restoration prescriptions that encourage a more even distribution of trees across
the landscape should be discouraged (Riggs 1990). Restoration prescriptions that create a
clumpy stand structure may provide an environment that, following future cohort estab-
lishment, may help recreate the historical genetic structure. In addition, since wind is the
primary dispersal mechanism of genetic material and changes in wind-dispersal distances
have been associated with changes in stand density in many conifers such as Pinus
halepensis (Shohami and Nathan 2014), P. echinata Mill. (Dyer and Sork 2001) and Larix
occidentalis Nutt. (El-Kassaby and Jaquish 1996), prescriptions should ensure pollen ﬂow
is promoted between clumps via harvested openings to promote outcrossing in restored
stands (Adams 1992; Vekemans and Hardy 2004). Finally, additional clumps may need to
be created from post-settlement populations to restore conditions that will have effective
genetic population sizes large enough to conserve genetic diversity (Thomas et al. 2014;
Wymore et al. 2014) within and among clumps.
Comparisons among pre- and post-settlement age groups
Even though heterozygosity did not differ between the pre- and post-settlement popula-
tions, small differences in genetic composition and structure existed between the age
groups as evidenced by allele frequency differences at different loci. Additionally, mea-
sures of genetic diversity tended to be slightly higher in the post-settlement populations,
and genetic distances (D) of 0.03–0.07 indicated the two age groups differed genetically.
These distances found are larger than those reported in other ponderosa pine studies in the
southwestern US (Linhart et al. 1981a) and eastern Montana (Woods et al. 1983) and
although differences among age groups are not unusual (Staszak et al. 2007), the degree of
genetic distance between the pre- and post-settlement populations at Fort Valley is
somewhat surprising. Changes in allele frequencies can occur over a short period of time
due to rapid evolution or genetic drift, particularly in populations with small effective sizes
genetic drift (Hedrick 2000). Ponderosa pine populations at Fort Valley exist in large,
relatively continuous stands and thus wind-mediated gene ﬂow should be sufﬁcient to
counteract effects of drift via copious pollen production (Mitton 1992) that mixes genetic
material within stands (Adams 1992). However, in ponderosa pine approximately 20% of
the trees produce 65–70% of the cones at any given time (Linhart and Mitton 1985), and
the continuous stands of post-settlement trees at Fort Valley are largely the result of a few
successful regeneration events (Savage et al. 1996; Mast et al. 1999). Since much of the
pollen would come from kin-structured clusters where individuals are more likely to mate
New Forests
123

with neighbors than panmictically (Adams 1992; Mitton 1992), effective population sizes
may be smaller than expected which could contribute to genetic differentiation among pre-
and post-settlement populations.
Despite large genetic distances and allele frequency differences among pre- and post-
settlement trees, both age groups had similar degrees of homozygosity as indicated by
positive FIS values. However, the genetic process largely responsible for homozygous
structure in one age group may not be the same process responsible for it in the second age
group. Temporal differences have been reported for ponderosa pine (Linhart 1988; Staszak
et al. 2007) and other conifers including Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco (Davis
1981), Pinus sylvestris (Gullberg et al. 1982) and Pinus contorta (Wheeler and Guries
1982). While post-settlement trees are likely products of related mating among members of
pre-settlement clumps, natural selection cannot be excluded as a contributing factor to the
homozygous genetic structure found in the post-settlement populations. Ponderosa pine is
considered to be genetically responsive to changing environmental conditions (Mitton et al.
1977). For example, different selective pressures have been attributed to creating different
allele frequencies at the PER-2 locus in young cohorts of ponderosa pine that established in
moister conditions under older parental trees which had established under xeric conditions
(Linhart et al. 1981b; Beckman and Mitton 1984). Biochemical analysis of allozymes at
this peroxidase locus revealed that different alleles had better metabolic function in dif-
ferent environments, thus promoting selection and adaptation of individuals to varying
environmental conditions in one generation. Factors creating intraspeciﬁc competition and
thus selective pressures in pre-settlement trees at Fort Valley likely differed from post-
settlement trees due to altered ﬁre regimes and stand structure conditions experienced by
the two age groups during their development (Savage et al. 1996). Although both popu-
lations experienced density-dependent intraspeciﬁc competition, crowding within tree
clusters (Feldman et al. 1999) was experienced by pre- versus the post-settlement trees.
Between clumps, pre-settlement forest structure was less dense and thus clumps generally
grew in more open, sun-exposed environments (Biondi 1996). In contrast, density-de-
pendent intraspeciﬁc competition experienced by the more continuous stands of post-
settlement trees occurred in dense, shaded conditions created in part by ﬁre suppression.
No alleles were exclusive to one age group in Fort Valley and the adaptive value of
allozymes in the present study are unknown. However, strong natural selection can lead to
rapid local adaptation (Ratnam et al. 2014). The possibility that allele frequencies favoring
homozygous genotypes was the result of selection in ﬁre suppressed, dense, and shaded
conditions in the post-settlement trees while that of pre-settlement clumps was principally
the result of family structure cannot be excluded.
Given the genetic differences (albeit small) found between the pre- and post-settlement
populations at Fort Valley, restoration prescriptions that remove 85% or more of the post-
settlement trees could change allele frequencies and result in a loss of alleles important for
adaptation to future conditions (Buchert et al. 1997; Adams et al. 1998; Rajora et al. 2000;
Ratnam et al. 2014). Therefore, even though ecological restoration efforts are returning
physiological health to southwestern forests (Covington et al. 2001; Fule´ et al. 2012;
Roccaforte et al. 2015; Thomas and Waring 2015), the prescriptions might not be con-
serving the residual population’s ability to respond genetically to future changes. Alfaro
et al. (2014) suggest that forest management decisions use the ‘‘precautionary principle’’
when it comes to climate change which would maintain options in the form of intraspeciﬁc
diversity, and Potter et al. (2015) stress the importance of conserving the breadth of genetic
diversity to preserve the adaptive potential of ponderosa pine under future climate con-
ditions. Retaining a higher percent of post-settlement trees across the landscape than is
New Forests
123

currently prescribed in many stand density restoration prescriptions is needed to increase
genetically effective population sizes that will enhance genetic diversity and build genetic
resilience to environmental changes (Thomas et al. 2014).
Comparisons among randomly selected and restoration ‘‘leave’’ post-
settlement trees
Randomly selected and restoration ‘‘leave’’ tree populations did not differ in their genetic
makeup to the degree that pre-settlement and post-settlement age groups did. The two post-
settlement populations had different allele frequencies only at only one locus (GOT-1) at
two sites, and genetic distances were essentially zero for all sites. Lack of genetic dif-
ferences for these populations selected according to different criteria is likely due to the
trees being closely related as a result of few successful regeneration events and dispersal
mechanisms discussed earlier. The general lack of genetic differences along with no dif-
ferences in mean FIS among the two post-settlement populations suggests that a residual
stand of post-settlement trees based on the restoration selection guidelines will not sig-
niﬁcantly differ from a residual stand of randomly selected post-settlement trees. However,
retaining more post-settlement trees than is called for with the 1.5–3.0 trees/stump pre-
scription along with creation of additional clumps within the residual post-settlement
stands are needed to fully conserve genetic diversity of the post-settlement population.
Genetic diversity following simulated thinning of post-settlement populations
Although results of the 50 and 75% simulated random thinning must be viewed with
caution as rough estimates only, they did suggest how stand density reduction could affect
the amount and organization of genetic diversity within the residual post-settlement
populations. Most changes in the gene pool did not occur until the 75% stand density
‘‘reduction’’ where the number of alleles per locus and total number of alleles decreased.
Similar declines have been reported in simulated (Nijensohn et al. 2005) harvests and
actual harvests of varying intensity in P. strobus (Buchert et al. 1997; Rajora et al. 2002)
and in Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr. (Hawley et al. 2005) stands. In contrast to these changes
in allelic richness, differences in heterozygosity and allele frequencies have not been
observed following harvesting in other species including Picea glauca (Moench) Voss
(Fageria and Rajora 2013) and Pseudotsuga menziesii (Neale 1985) where potential neg-
ative impacts of drift and inbreeding from bottlenecks are counterbalanced by high gene
ﬂow. Some (e.g., Marshall and Brown 1975; Buchert et al. 1997) consider changes in
allelic richness to be more important than evenness measures such as heterozygosity and
allele frequencies in determining impacts of management, because allelic diversity is more
sensitive to bottlenecks and changes in population sizes (El-Kassaby 2000; Piotti et al.
2013; Ratnam et al. 2014) that can occur with large stand density reductions. The trend of
decreased LP, Vgam and GM at the higher simulated thinning intensity for ponderosa pine at
Fort Valley also suggests loss of alleles which typically are rare or low frequency. Loss of
these types of alleles following harvesting has been documented in P. strobus (Buchert
et al. 1997; Rajora et al. 2000) and T. canadensis (Hawley et al. 2005). Although some
suggest loss of rare alleles can be good for stand ﬁtness (e.g. Rajora and Mosseler 2001),
others (e.g., Buchert et al. 1997; Bergmann et al. 1990) argue that even alleles which do not
contribute to the current genetic load (or LP) are necessary for the preservation of species
adaptability to changing environments. Thus, losing low frequency alleles could be dis-
advantageous if they have adaptive signiﬁcance, i.e., become adaptive preferentially under

123

stress conditions. The LPs estimated for ponderosa pine in Fort Valley are lower than
estimates for other conifers (Bergmann et al. 1990; Buchert et al. 1997) likely due to the
small sample sizes and the way the simulated thinned populations were generated. How-
ever, homozygosity strongly inﬂuences estimates of LP and thus the homozygous structure
of ponderosa pine in Fort Valley could have contributed to the considerably lower LP
values in the simulated residual stands. The small sample sizes and the way the residual
stands were created in the simulated thinning also likely overestimated the number and
losses of alleles that are truly rare in nature (El-Kassaby and Ritland 1996). Nevertheless,
reduction in the number of alleles in the 75% simulated stand density reduction suggests
the current restoration prescription of removing over 85% of the post-settlement trees
could result in allele losses that can negatively impact LP and thus the evolutionary
adaptability of stands. If the simulations reﬂect results of actual thinning, prescriptions that
vary the density of residual trees over the landscape will help conserve genetic diversity in
general, and particularly for low frequency alleles. Stand density prescriptions that both
conserve genetic diversity and protect the residual stands from stand replacing wildﬁres
can be achieved by creating variable sized openings and tree densities, and creating
variable numbers of and sizes of clumps across the landscape. This structure will facilitate
gene ﬂow, conserve spatial genetic structure and help ameliorate allele losses from
thinning.
Ecological restoration management implications
The relatively high levels of genetic diversity in ponderosa pine allows the species to be
distributed over a large geographic range and to adapt to heterogeneous environments
within geographic regions. Maintaining this genetic diversity within and among restored
populations is important to the conservation of this ecologically signiﬁcant species,
especially where there is potential for genetic loss and where rapid genetic responses are
needed to adapt to climate change (Stanturf 2015). Restoring population sizes, spatial
structures and thus gene ﬂow among populations are needed to conserve genetic diversity
in restored stands (Ledig 1986; Piotti et al. 2013). Because the degree to which manipu-
lation of stand structure also affects genetic structure varies among species (Marquardt
et al. 2007; Dubreuil et al. 2010; Bacles and Jump 2011), restoration practitioners must
incorporate species-speciﬁc genetic knowledge into their decision-making. Allozyme
evidence in our study suggests selection may be causing genetic differences among pre-
and post-settlement ponderosa pine trees in Fort Valley. If this is the case, selective
pressures most likely allowed each age group to adapt to the unique environmental con-
ditions to which they have been exposed over the last 120 years and thus maintenance of
both age groups will conserve the greatest genetic diversity. Utilization of restoration
‘‘leave’’ tree selection criteria does not appear to change genetic diversity or increase
genetic relatedness within post-settlement populations. However, the homozygous genetic
structure of Fort Valley ponderosa pine stands described by the allozyme analyses suggests
many individuals are likely closely related. Therefore, restoring function will require close
attention to the effects that alternative restoration thinning treatments might have on pollen
ﬂow and seed dispersal to prevent inbreeding from taking place beyond the tolerance of
Fort Valley populations.
While it is not feasible nor practical to preserve all existing variants (alleles and
genotypes) in ecological restoration projects, prescriptions should not ignore conserving
the breadth of genetic diversity that could increase adaptive capacity in the face of
increasing pressures such as from climate change (Jacobs et al. 2015; Stanturf 2015).

Restoration prescriptions should incorporate genetic diversity components with other goals
for restoring ecosystem health (i.e., decreasing fuel loading and wildﬁre danger, increasing
vigor of trees, increasing understory diversity and production, etc.) along with adaptation
to future climates (Dumroese et al. 2015; Newton and Cantarello 2015). Leaving more
trees per hectare and creating additional clumps with variable tree densities per clump that
reﬂect pre-settlement structures should conserve genetic diversity in ecological restoration
of ponderosa pine forests. The 1.5–3.0 thinning prescription would leave approximately
90–210 post-settlement trees/ha, assuming a pre-settlement stand density of 60–70 trees/ha
(Covington et al. 1997). While the genetic neighborhood size to be restored for ponderosa
pine in Fort Valley is unknown, if an interbreeding neighborhood is a few hectares in size,
the residual stand density from the 1.5–3.0 prescription is lower than minimum population
sizes needed to conserve the full suite of genetic diversity, particularly conservation of low
frequency alleles that might be important to the species evolutionarily (Namkoong 1984;
Gregorius 1980). Namkoong (1984) suggests selecting approximately 1000 individuals,
within a complete population of interbreeding individuals which means three or more post-
settlement trees need to be left around each stump (assuming a pre-settlement density of
60–70 trees/ha) to create populations of 1000 trees per neighborhood size of 5 ha. Even
though post-settlement trees around a stump are likely related, pollen ﬂow among these
clusters should promote outcrossing. Although leaving more post-settlement trees to
conserve genetic uniqueness of the different age groups/cohorts may come at the expense
of increasing wildﬁre danger, the risk can be reduced by creating openings and using
varying thinning intensities over the landscape. This type of prescription could also pro-
mote variable selective conditions by creating a variety of growing environments that
might favor different alleles and thus conserve greater overall genetic diversity. Main-
taining a large diversity of alleles also provides greater options for adaptation to future
climate conditions (Dumroese et al. 2015).
Examination of completed ponderosa pine restoration projects show residual stand
densities at the upper end of that described for reference conditions (Roccaforte et al. 2010;
Sanchez Meador et al. 2011; Larson et al. 2012). These higher residual stand densities are
likely a result of balancing restoration goals with meeting the public’s desire for retention
of larger trees and more dense forests on public lands (Abella et al. 2006; Ostergren et al.
2008; Sanchez Meador et al. 2015). However, because these higher stand densities are
consistent with variation in reference conditions at a landscape scale (Williams and Baker
2012; Dickinson 2014), these restoration projects are meeting ecological goals while also
likely conserving genetic composition (allelic richness). These ecological restoration
projects can more fully conserve genetic diversity if future stand manipulations also restore
spatial genetic structure.
