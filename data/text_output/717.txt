Flagstaff Watershed Protection Project: 
Creating Solutions through Community Partnerships
ERI–Issues in Forest Restoration

The Ecological Restoration Institute 
 
Te Ecological Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona University is a pioneer in researching, 
implementing, and monitoring ecological restoration of dry, frequent-ﬁre forests in the Intermountain 
West. Tese forests have been signiﬁcantly altered during the last century, with decreased ecological and 
recreational values, near-elimination of natural low-intensity ﬁre regimes, and greatly increased risk of 
large-scale ﬁres. Te ERI is working with public agencies and other partners to restore these forests to 
a more ecologically healthy condition and trajectory—in the process helping to signiﬁcantly reduce the 
threat of catastrophic wildﬁre and its eﬀects on human, animal, and plant communities.

Introduction 
In the past two decades, communities in ﬁre-prone forests across the West have faced increased danger of cata-
strophic wildﬁres. Tese wildﬁres have been steadily growing in size and intensity, partly due to the amount of fuel 
built up from a century of ﬁre suppression and also driven by rising temperatures and drought. Tese intense wild-
ﬁres have burned homes and infrastructure as well as critical natural resources such as watersheds and wildlife 
habitat. However, hazardous fuel reduction projects — especially on steep slopes adjacent to communities — can be 
diﬃcult and costly. 
Cities and towns throughout the West have been grappling with innovative ways to fund forest restoration and 
protect their water supplies and reduce ﬂooding impacts. An example of one such eﬀort is the Flagstaﬀ Watershed 
Protection Project, known as FWPP, in Flagstaﬀ, Arizona. Te FWPP emerged from proactive civic leadership that 
recognized the need to overcome funding limitations and implement hazardous fuel reduction treatments in 
critical, at-risk watersheds. Several factors contributed to its success, among them the fear of another extreme ﬁre 
event in the mountains north of town.
Te purpose of this white paper is to convey to other communities, municipalities, and/or government agencies the 
administrative functions and mechanisms used by the two primary partners, the City of Flagstaﬀ (City) and the U.S. 
Forest Service (also referred to as USFS, the forest, the Coconino National Forest, and the National Forest), to 
develop and implement FWPP. Te paper is designed as a case study for other entities considering a similar initiative. 
Tis case study spans the ﬁrst two years of the project (see Figure 1, page 4), from the bond election in November 
The 2010 Schultz Fire burned 15,000 acres of untreated forest north of Flagstaff, Arizona. The cost to ﬁght the ﬁre and 
mitigate the subsequent ﬂooding was estimated between $133 and $147 million (Combrink et al. 2013). Photo by Brady 
Smith, USDA Forest Service, Coconino National Forest

Residents living below the Schultz Fire burn area experienced extreme ﬂooding after monsoon rain events in months 
following the ﬁre. Results of an analysis by the Ecological Restoration Institute indicated that the ﬁre directly 
and indirectly contributed to a loss of approximately $60 million in the personal wealth of local property owners 
(Combrink et al. 2013). Photo by Deborah Lee Sotlesz, U.S. Forest Service   
2012 to December 2014. Personal interviews were conducted with key personnel from the City and the USFS. Tis 
report summarizes ﬁndings from the interviews and information derived from review of City and USFS internal 
project documents.
Te value of this case study is two-fold. First, it is an historical account of what led to the successful passage and 
start-up of the FWPP. Second, it serves as a guide to the steps (Appendix A) and the mechanisms used to develop 
and implement a successful private/public/agency partnership. Tese ﬁndings can be used as a foundation to 
develop a similar initiative designed to achieve community protection through forest management. 
A Solid Foundation
In the summer of 2010, the Flagstaﬀ community experienced near misses and direct hits from wildﬁres all in a few 
days (Arizona Daily Sun 2010). Te Hardy Fire, which burned toward evacuated neighborhoods, was contained 
because it intersected treated areas and dropped to the ground, allowing emergency responders to contain the wild-
ﬁre. Te Schultz Fire, igniting just one day afer the Hardy Fire, did not have the same outcome. Te Schultz Fire 
ignited on the east side of the San Francisco Peaks, a mountain range just north of Flagstaﬀ, and spread throughout 
an untreated area, resulting in a 15,000-acre high-severity wildﬁre. Tis ﬁre torched the majority of trees and severely 
burned the soil, causing it to become hydrophobic, or water repelling. Te subsequent impacts from the post-ﬁre 
ﬂooding that occurred in the ﬁre’s afermath were devastating. Tough no homes burned in the ﬁre, multiple extreme

post-ﬁre ﬂooding events damaged downstream rural neighborhoods, aquifers, critical city and county-owned 
infrastructure, and tragically resulted in the loss of a life.
Two years later, in the November 2012 general election, Flagstaﬀ city voters overwhelmingly approved (73.6 
percent passing in all 26 precincts) a $10 million bond to fund the FWPP. Te project was designed to reduce the 
risk of severe wildﬁre and subsequent post-ﬁre ﬂooding in the Rio de Flag (Dry Lake Hills) and protect the surface 
water supply in the Walnut Creek-Upper Lake Mary (Mormon Mountain) watersheds. Te majority of the project 
lies on federal land (10,544 acres) and much smaller portions are on city (3,000 acres) and state (2,000 acres) land. 
A small inholding that is owned by the Navajo Nation (140 acres) lies in the center of the Dry Lake Hills project 
area. Te two primary partners of the FWPP are the City and the USFS. Te City has funding authority and 
approves expenditures for the project and the USFS authorizes decisions aﬀecting National Forest System land. 
Implementation of the project — including the environmental planning process, tree thinning, and initial entry 
prescribed burning — is expected to span 10 years, ending in 2022.
At least 19 years of dedicated collaborative work set the stage for voter approval of the bond. Tis included productive 
relationships established between the Flagstaﬀ Fire Department’s Wildland Fire Management program, the USFS 
Coconino National Forest, the Ecological Restoration Institute (ERI) and School of Forestry at Northern Arizona 
University (NAU), and the Greater Flagstaﬀ Forests Partnership (GFFP), a local collaborative group comprised of a 
variety of stakeholders. Tese organizations had long been working together on forest restoration and hazardous fuel 
Challenges partners faced included difﬁculty in treating steep, rocky slopes like 
the Dry lake Hills (left/above) and the presence of threatened species habitat like 
the Mexican spotted owl (right).

Box 2. Questions Considered by the FWPP Project Partners
• 
Are the issues and solutions clearly defined?
• 
Is there interest and buy-in from relevant parties/the community? 
• 
Is the community knowledgeable/supportive of the need/project? 
• 
What is the level of commitment of the parties involved?
• 
What is the community and agency’s capacity/availability of a workforce and  
 
 
financial resources? How can we increase this capacity? 
•  What qualities and skills will leaders need to succeed? How do we identify them?
•  Do we have key leaders who are willing to take risks and champion the initiative? 
•  How much and what type of groundwork (up-front work) is needed (e.g. public  
 
 
opinion surveys, educating public/politicians, social and political license, etc.)? 
• 
How do we build on and maintain social license created by catastrophic events (e.g.  
 
Schultz Fire and ﬂoods) and the broad support demonstrated by the passage of the   
 
bond?
•  Does the community/partners have a unified multi-agency approach? Do the  
 
 
agencies/organizations involved have similar operating frameworks, missions/ 
 
 
goals, opportunities needs, challenges?
•  What affect do recent catastrophes (e.g., crown replacing wildfires) have?
•  Who are the other collaborators that could/should be involved? Who are the players
 
that will support the program and assure its success? How do we identify them? 
•  Which groups/individuals might present themselves as opponents of the project? 
 
Can we work with these individuals/groups so they become proponents or are
 
neutralized?
Box 1. Conceptualizing a Community Based Initiative 
Key partners had:
• a mutual understanding of clearly deﬁned issues and solutions; 
• a uniﬁed multi-party approach; 
• high levels of commitment (local, regional, and national) and partners were well
 
aligned; 
• a willingness to prioritize the project within their organizations; and 
• long-standing and well-established relationships.
Partners identiﬁed:
• 
the level of interest, knowledge, and support that community members, 
 
decision-makers, and political leaders had for the project; 
• 
the level of up-front work and resources that were needed in outreach, education, 
 
and relationship building; 
• 
leaders who were willing to take risks and champion the project; and
• 
the level of capacity and resources available to address the solution.

reduction treatments, which includes thinning trees and prescribed burns, in and around the community. Other 
signiﬁcant eﬀorts included adoption of the “Greater Flagstaﬀ Area Community Wildﬁre Protection Plan” (2005, revised 
in 2012) and the Wildland-Urban Interface Code (2008). Tese organizations also provided robust public outreach 
eﬀorts that resulted in wide acceptance and demand for forest treatments. Te public understood the need and wit-
nessed the beneﬁts the treatments provided in reducing ﬁre risk and improving forest health (Welch 2012, Malis-Clark 
2012, Smith 2012). 
Forest health issues had been a concern for ecologists as well as city and forest oﬃcials since the mid-1990s, but state 
and federal funding for restoration on public land was limited. Exacerbating this problem was the 2008 economic 
downturn. In response to this, the City determined it would become more sustainable, resilient, and self-reliant. 
In 2009, then Flagstaﬀ City Manager Kevin Burke formed a Sustainable Communities Cabinet tasked to identify 
sustainability issues and solutions. In September 2012, shortly before the FWPP bond election, the City completed 
the “City of Flagstaﬀ Resiliency and Preparedness Study” (City of Flagstaﬀ 2012b). Te focus of the study was to 
address the question: “How can we reduce our vulnerability to and build local resilience against risk from climate 
variability and weather related impacts?” Both the cabinet and the study identiﬁed potential climate impact eﬀects on 
forest health and uncharacteristic wildﬁre as a priority focus area for the City’s new vision for the future.
With forest health and community protection identiﬁed as a top priority for city oﬃcials, the City, the USFS, and 
other partners recognized areas of high ﬁre risk on National Forest System land that could potentially aﬀect 
critical watersheds. However, these areas were exorbitantly expensive and diﬃcult to treat due to their location on 
steep, rocky slopes (slopes greater than 40 percent grade); presence of threatened species (Mexican spotted owl) 
habitat; and lack of timber value. Removing the timber was not ﬁnancially feasible for the agency because its value 
was much lower than the cost of its removal. Moreover, these sites are not typically a federal priority because they 
require a lengthy environmental review process and have the potential to pose legal challenges. Te City, the 
USFS, and other partners understood these challenges and worked together to address them with innovative 
funding strategies.
Clarifying the Problem and the Solution 
Te FWPP evolved organically. Potential project partners already were aligned and understood the unhealthy forest 
conditions and the threat it posed to Flagstaﬀ. Leaders also recognized the solution — to conduct forest treatments 
in areas that would reduce ﬁre risk and protect critical watersheds. Years of building community support gave 
leaders the conﬁdence needed to move forward. City of Flagstaﬀ Wildland Fire Management Oﬃcer and FWPP 
Project Manager Paul Summerfelt summed up the synergy by saying, “We were on a roll. We didn’t have the upfront 
work [to do]; it was already done.” 
In looking back during FWPP’s initiation, it is clear the municipality, the National Forest, the community, and other 
entities had a clear problem and sense of the solution (Boxes 1 and 2) (Mindock 2013). 
A Community Bond: FWPP Funding Mechanism and Source
Several months prior to the November election, in March 2012, a meeting was convened in Flagstaﬀ with City 
oﬃcials and relevant departments, area ecologists and hydrologists, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to 
discuss the area’s ﬁre and ﬂood risk, the aﬀected watersheds, the concept of payment for watershed services, and the 
potential to address and fund the problem. Te City of Santa Fe’s utilities department presented on how Santa Fe 

8
addressed a similar situation with a collaboratively developed payment for watershed services program. Tis work-
shop provided the inspiration for using a local revenue source to accelerate forest treatments on federal land.
One month later in April, a multi-party steering committee was formed to evaluate the scope and feasibility of a 
proposal to fund watershed restoration. Te committee’s participants were similar to those at the initiation meeting 
in March, with the addition of leadership from the National Forest and Coconino County oﬃcials and county 
department leads. 
Tis group was tasked to construct a scope of work that included: 
1) Identiﬁcation, role, and beneﬁt to local and downstream water users; 
2) Cooperation between partners (Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), roles and responsibilities, ﬁnancial 
obligations/leverage funds); 
3) Projected timeline; 
4) Project location/boundaries, acres; 
5) Estimated costs; and
6) Reﬁning costs: Initial treatments (pay for with bond funding) versus future treatment maintenance — primarily 
implementing prescribed ﬁres (potentially applying a water utility user fee).
In the absence of available general funds, then Flagstaﬀ City Manager Kevin Burke suggested a bond based on a 
secondary property tax as the funding source. Te City determined it had $10 million in bonding capacity within the 
existing secondary property tax rate. Burke decided to advance the idea of authorizing bonds, which would propor-
tionally maintain the current property tax levels (this rate is assessed on current property value). Te steering 
committee determined that the scope of work seemed reasonable for the $10 million bond spread over 20 years. Te 
bond amount was estimated to cover the cost of the initial treatments; however, the steering committee noted that

treatment maintenance would likely need another funding source, such as a water utility fee or a storm drainage 
utility fee, and that would be revisited in the future.
Bond versus Utility User Fee or Sales Tax
Burke chose a bond as the funding mechanism over alternative funding sources, such as a water utility user fee, 
storm drainage fee, or sales tax, because of the distinct advantage of gaining voter approval and associated support 
for action. City of Flagstaff Management Services Director Barbara Goodrich explained that if approved, the levy is 
assessed across the entire community; therefore, the community has a vested interest in the outcome and the associ­
ated benefits of the project. Alternatively, using other funding sources, such as a water utility fee, would not go before 
voters, but would need approval and adoption by City Council. Burke explained that if a utility fee had been 
imposed, in the absence of a public opinion study, citizens’ support or opposition for the fee would not be fully 
understood. A clear advantage of a bond election is that it eliminates uncertainty about public opinion. The bond 
also provided the benefit of having funds available up front; whereas, with a user fee or sales tax, there may be lag 
time in accumulation of the necessary funds before actions can be taken. 
Bond Funding Mechanics
The bond authority allows the City to access any increment within the $10 million bond amount. Although interest 
is earned on the bond, this amount is less than the interest paid. In order to minimize the interest paid, the City 
estimated an issuance amount based on a program of work developed for the first two years. In addition to the 
interest paid, there are bond issuance costs. With this in mind, the City issued the FWPP bond in conjunction with 
other City authorized bonds to lessen and spread administrative costs across multiple projects. Expenditures are 
drawn from a project-specific, local investment City account. The expenditures are tracked through a ledger cost 
accounting process with an identifiable project account number and project numbers that further identify expenses 
by agency (USFS, state, City, etc.) and by type of work (planning, implementation, monitoring, etc.). 
The Power of a Bond Election
For FWPP, the advantages of pursuing a bond in an election outweighed the disadvantages. An election empowered 
voters to determine their own tax future, and bond approval would demonstrate voter support for action. For the 
bond question to appear on the ballot, Flagstaff City Council needed to approve the scope of work planned by the 
steering committee. The scope of work also provided the details and platform needed to run a campaign (before the 
election, the City informed the public about the project (City of Flagstaff 2012a, 2012c, 2012d) and a separate 
political committee advocated and campaigned for votes). Disadvantages of a ballot measure included the cost 
(approximately $150,000) and human resources required to run the campaign. There was also the possibility that the 
initiative would be defeated at the polls and an alternative funding source may not have emerged. 
In the end, almost three quarters (73.6 percent) of the voters supported the bond. According to Summerfelt, the 
overwhelming number of votes in favor of the bond provided the City and the USFS the “social capital” and credibil­
ity to move forward. He said, “[Voter approval] provides a big social license and it provides political cover … it’s the 
will of the voters.” Voter approval also sent a message to those opposed to forest treatments or taxes. The overwhelm­
ing public support likely influenced individuals/groups that are generally opposed to such projects. 
The election also elevated the awareness of forest health issues and provided an educational opportunity to clearly 
outline the problem (fire and floods) and the solution (forest treatments) (City of Flagstaff 2012a, 2012c, 2012d). 
Regardless of land jurisdiction, voters understood the initiative focused on addressing public safety issues and 
protecting values at risk (e.g. personal property, water supply, infrastructure, scenic beauty, etc.). In addition, Burke 
explained, rural tourism-based economies in Arizona have proved vulnerable in the aftermath of intense wildfires, 
and this measure assists in reducing potential negative economic impacts to the community. Although the bulk of 

10
10
the project would occur outside of the City’s boundary, for these reasons, city residents were willing to ﬁnan-
cially back the project (Smith 2012, Arizona Daily Sun 2012). 
Te tremendous voter approval also demanded a higher level of accountability — a need to demonstrate 
success to voters. Tis required budget and process transparency, which Summerfelt said, “held both agencies’ 
[City/USFS] feet to the ﬁre.” Moreover, the election results raised the project’s proﬁle and generated regional 
and national interest from the USFS, the Arizona state legislature, and Congress. It is rare for a municipality 
and national forest to forge such a unique relationship. Te heightened proﬁle of the project incentivized the 
team to meet voters’ expectations. 
Voter Expectations 
An exit poll was conducted on Election Day at various polling stations by NAU researchers. Te poll’s ﬁndings 
showed the top three reasons (selected from a list of attributes) voters supported the initiative: 1) to reduce the 
risk of post-ﬁre ﬂooding (55 percent), 2) to protect the City’s water resources (54 percent), and 3) to invest 
now in order to avoid future costs (36 percent) (Nielsen and Solop 2013). Te exit poll also revealed that 
although voters generally did not understand the implications of the property tax rates — the majority of 
those polled believed their property taxes would increase — the bond still received strong support (http://
library.eri.nau.edu/gsdl/collect/erilibra/index/assoc/D2013011.dir/doc.pdf). 
Prior to and following the election, a variety of public meetings were held and central themes emerged that 
resulted in the development of the City’s Monitoring Plan. Te plan was designed to address the primary voter 
questions and concerns while, at the same time, provide the transparency and accountability the project 
demands.

FWPP Leveraged Funds
City of Flagstaﬀ
No one anticipated the additional ﬁnancial support FWPP would attract from local, state, and national agencies and 
organizations. Within the ﬁrst two years, FWPP generated an additional $2 million, which translates to a 20 percent 
return on the original bond (see Appendix B for leverage reports tracked by the City for 2013 and 2014). Te major-
ity of the leveraged funds came from the USFS (Box 3). Although a small portion of on-the-ground work occurred 
in the ﬁrst two years since the bond election, the project received substantial support in leveraged funds.
Based on a speciﬁc theme identiﬁed in the City’s Monitoring Plan — “How was the money invested?” — the City 
decided to track cash and in-kind leveraged funds. To collect the information, the City requested that external 
partners report estimated contribution amounts biannually. For state and federal partners operating in a diﬀerent 
ﬁscal year accounting period, the amounts are parsed out according to the calendar year. Tese leveraged funds do 
not include City in-kind work toward the project. 
Te ﬁnal annual leverage report is distributed to all partners internally and to the Flagstaﬀ City Council and the 
Coconino County Board of Supervisors who can share the results with elected oﬃcials on state and national levels. 
On the public side, the total leveraged amount is shared in FWPP Biannual Reports posted on the project’s website, 
in project updates, during public meetings, and by word of mouth. Although reporting a full cost breakdown to 
citizens has not seemed necessary thus far, the City can easily generate and provide a report if requested. 
U.S. Forest Service 
Te tremendous support demonstrated by the leadership of the Coconino National Forest and its line oﬃcers was 
instrumental to the successful implementation of FWPP. When the bond ﬁrst passed, the USFS thought that bond 
funding would cover costs for on-the-ground implementation and the environmental planning process. However, 
because FWPP embodies many agency interests — such as providing community protection and a prominent 
ecosystem service (watershed protection and enhancement) — the project received unexpected ﬁnancial support 
from the regional and Washington oﬃce levels (Box 3). From the USFS perspective, investing in the planning, initial 
forest treatments, surveys, and other costs allowed for more bond funds to be available for implementation. 
After the Bond Passed: Project Planning
Decision Space
Trough multiple meetings and close communication between the partners, the City and the USFS developed a clear 
understanding of each party’s roles and decision space. As FWPP rolled out, it was understood that the City would 
make the ﬁscal decisions regarding use of bond funds and the USFS held the authority for the environmental 
planning process and management decisions on the National Forest. Te two partners also decided they would 
jointly conduct meetings with the public and address any issues as a uniﬁed front. 
Communication Plan
A Communication Plan was one of the ﬁrst documents collaboratively developed by the City and USFS (Appendix C). 
Te plan outlined a communication strategy that included stated communication goals, coordination between partners, 
project contacts, audiences, key messages and themes, a communication action plan, delivery methods and communica-
tion products, and product/action details. Te plan functioned as an internal education tool to assist each organization to 
understand the complexities and requirements of each entity as well as to outline how they would interact with one 

12
12
another and with the public. Te messages in the plan also assisted those less familiar with forest health issues to convey 
accurate information, minimized communication missteps, and oﬀered ways of presenting the project as a united front. 
A critical component of the plan was to construct a project-speciﬁc website (www.ﬂagstaﬀwatershedprotection.org). 
Te site’s name mirrored the project name and was easy to remember. Te site was user-friendly because it was 
housed outside of larger, more complex agency/municipality sites. Te communication team, comprised of both 
partners and multiple stakeholders, collaboratively manages the website. Since neither party hosts the website,  
the format and content are less constrained by each entity’s requirements. To further promote a stand-alone project 
identity, a FWPP logo (designed during the election) and joint-partnership letterhead were produced to brand  
the project. 
Implementation Plan
Concurrent with the Communication Plan, the USFS, along with input from the City, developed an internal Imple-
mentation Plan. Tis plan was instrumental in informing and providing assurances to internal (USFS) and external 
audiences less involved with the project’s initiation. Te plan included: 1) messaging about project intent, and 2) 
information on the various components of the project, including the overlap between the FWPP planning area and 
areas already included in previous project boundaries. More speciﬁcally, the Implementation Plan documented the 
project’s background, objectives, tasks, estimated treatment costs, and an estimated treatment implementation 
timeline (Appendix D). Additionally, the plan outlined considerations for treating areas in already approved National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) decisions, analyzing areas not yet NEPA approved, and re-analyzing areas where 
all treatment options were not previously considered.
Tis plan was neither a standard nor a required agency document and, like the Communication Plan, it preceded other 
formal USFS planning documents. Ultimately, the plan provided initial guidance, assisted the local forest with under-
standing the complexities of the project, and most importantly, it was used as an internal communication tool within the

agency. This gave the regional and national offices assurances that the project was thoroughly considered and initial 
planning stages were underway. This plan was followed by the first required agency document, the Proposed Action (PA) 
(April 2013). 
Environmental Compliance Planning (National Environmental Policy Act) 
Soon after the bond’s passage, the USFS and the City discussed which environmental analysis tool was most appro­
priate. Based on these discussions, the USFS decided to use an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) over an 
Environmental Assessment (EA) as the environmental analysis tool for the proposed treatment area. An EA is 
adequate only if findings and conclusions demonstrate no significant impact, while an EIS discloses and explains 
significant impacts within the proposed analysis. Further considerations influencing the decision included the 
novelty of the project and potential issues that may be presented by Mexican spotted owl (MSO) habitat impacts, 
steep slope operations, and treatments occurring in mixed conifer forest types. These factors contribute to a greater 
risk of project litigation, and an EIS, while taking somewhat longer to complete than an EA, provides a level of 
analysis better positioned to resist legal challenges. 
As a risk management measure, the USFS simplified the Purpose and Need of the EIS exclusively to address voters’ 
expectations of crown fire risk reduction and post-fire flooding rather than stating a specific purpose of forest 
restoration. The simplified Purpose and Need streamlined the NEPA planning process and helped communicate the 
necessity of the project to the public and internal audiences. 
To encourage broad public input, the USFS did not select a preferred alternative in the EIS, nor did they attempt to 
create a preferred alternative from the agency’s standpoint. Rather, the USFS acknowledged that public input on such 
a novel approach would be crucial in developing an informed decision that would blend the alternatives to best meet 
the Purpose and Need. According to Flagstaff District Ranger Mike Elson, this was a “crucial, wise choice.” Erin 
Phelps, USFS project manager, explained that in the absence of a preferred alternative, the comments the USFS 
received on the Draft EIS were “richer, constructive and candid.” If the USFS had identified a preferred alternative, 
Phelps believes comments would have narrowly focused on the negative aspects of the selected preferred alternative 
and the other alternatives would have been overlooked. The USFS encouraged public participation in the environ­
mental review process and received 530 separate comments from 107 individuals/groups on the Draft EIS. 
Public input on this Draft EIS was crucial because citizens voted for it and many would be personally affected, whether 
forest treatments occurred near their homes or in their favorite recreational areas. The USFS knew there would be tradeoffs 
for each proposed treatment and the agency did not want to weigh those without public input. The agency also analyzed 
the comments to determine what ecosystem services best represent the community. Phelps explained that developing the 
Final EIS with this collaborative spirit builds and solidifies trust within the community. 
Prior to the bond’s passage, the USFS took action to expedite the environmental analysis and demonstrate efficiency. 
For example, fire crews were redirected to collect data in mixed conifer stands for the environmental analysis. As 
soon as the bond passed, a Project Initiation Letter (PIL) was ready for a signature (Appendix E). The PIL is a 
standard USFS document that lays out expectations and responsibilities associated with the National Forest Manage­
ment Act (NFMA) and the NEPA analysis. The FWPP PIL appointed a dedicated FWPP Interdisciplinary Team 
(IDT) and identified their roles and responsibilities. Collectively, these steps decreased the amount of time usually 
necessary to prepare for the environmental analysis and begin work on the ground.

FWPP Cooperating Agreements
U.S. Forest Service Administrative Process
Coconino National Forest: Entering into Agreements 
When the USFS assessed the FWPP, it was clear this type of project would fall under an agreement. Agreements are 
used when a project provides a strong partnership, trusting relationships, mutual beneﬁt, and a shared mission 
with stated goals. 
Te process begins when an organization or agency proposes a project to the USFS. Te project’s speciﬁcations are 
shared with the Grants and Agreements Specialist who decides which authority — there ofen can be several 
— and agreement instrument provides the most utility (for more information on the federal statutory authorities, 
see Appendix F). 
Entering into agreements with the USFS varies from forest to forest (Box 4). Te Grants and Agreements Specialist acts 
as an administrative guide throughout the life of the project. Te Grants and Agreements Specialist is responsible for 
initiating the agreement documents, providing administrative oversight, and closing out the project. 
City of Flagstaﬀ and U.S. Forest Service Partner Agreements
For FWPP, three types of instruments are in place: two Memorandums of Understanding (MOU), a Master Partici-
pating Agreement, and Supplemental Project Agreements (see Appendix G for speciﬁc FWPP agreements). 
1) Memorandums of Understanding 
MOUs do not commit anything of value to or from any party; the primary purpose of a MOU is to establish 
the relationship, roles, and responsibilities of the involved entities. Te MOU formalizes the process and 
demonstrates a level of social commitment between the partners and may provide some leverage when seeking 
funding through grants and other sources. 
Te ﬁrst FWPP MOU simply describes the relationship and the roles and responsibilities between the City and 
USFS. Subsequent agreements between the City and USFS may or may not reﬂect the intent of this MOU.

15
Cooperating Agency Status MOU
Establishing cooperating agency status with partners is less standardized across the agency and the project’s 
needs influence the degree to which it is formalized within each forest. Depending on the region and the 
project, the forest has the option of using a MOU or a formal letter.                    
For the FWPP, the USFS used a second MOU to grant Cooperating Agency Status to the City. This identified the 
City as a member of the IDT. The City was included as a member of the IDT because of their expertise and ability 
to provide input to the USFS on the environmental planning documents (PA and Draft EIS). Although the City 
cannot make decisions that affect National Forest System land, they can provide input as recommendations; the 
USFS has the final authority to adopt them or not. Furthermore, without the cooperating status, the City would 
have had limited information only available to them in a public meeting setting. Flagstaff District Ranger Elson 
said the inclusion of the City on the IDT was “instrumental” in bridging the decision-making authority and 
strengthening lines of communication between partners. According to Elson, including the City in the planning 
process further solidified trust and transparency with funding decisions. 
2)	 Master Participating Agreement
A Master Participating Agreement is a detailed agreement that describes cooperative implementation of 
approved projects to meet mutual goals. The agreement includes standardized clauses, performance require­
ments, and the mechanics of how partners work together over the life of the project. This agreement has no 
monetary provisions attached; therefore, it is the overarching agreement that lays the foundation for imple­
mentation and monetary transfers. 
Specifically, the Master Participating Agreement constructed for FWPP delineates that the project use City and 
USFS resources, and the City will reimburse either partner’s expenses through bond funds. The Master Partici­
pating Agreement references the MOU, the Implementation Plan (referred to as the “5-Year Action Plan” in 
the Master Participating Agreement), and subsequent Annual Action Plans that will provide details of upcom­
ing and expected work. The negotiated FWPP Master Participating Agreement balanced the responsibilities 
between the partners through “The City Shall” and the “U.S. Forest Service Shall” statements.
3)	 Supplemental Project Agreements
A Master Participating Agreement serves as an umbrella agreement and all of its contents and clauses are tiered 
to individual Supplemental Project Agreements (SPAs). The entire Master Participating Agreement is incorpo­
rated by reference into the SPA. Therefore, SPAs tend to be shorter agreements that focus on the details of the 
project/activity and associated costs, and may be less time consuming to negotiate. 
As tasks or projects allowed under the terms of the Master Participating Agreement are required for FWPP, the 
Master Participating Agreement stipulates the initiation of a SPA. The SPA outlines specific tasks, identifies the 
parties participating in the specific project, authorizes specific entities to work on the national forest, projects 
the estimated costs, and if any funds are committed to the agreement, describes how funding will be handled. 
Every SPA must include a financial plan. Without a financial plan, no project-level agreement is complete (see 
link to financial planning forms in Appendix G, document 6). 
Because the City alone retains full authority of City bond money, the SPAs and expenditures associated with 
them must be approved by City Council. This requirement allows project leads to demonstrate measurable, 
defined progress to partners, City Council, and the general public. 

16
City of Flagstaﬀ Administrative Process
Once the USFS and the City agreed on issues and speciﬁc language, the agreements were reviewed by the 
City’s legal team and then sent to City Council for approval. Te signed and executed agreement was returned 
to the USFS for a ﬁnal signature. Once the agreements were in place, the City determined how to best track 
and manage the project. Because a secondary property tax funded the project, the City developed a framework 
of checks and balances to ensure ﬁscal accountability to voters. Te City also formed a multi-disciplinary City 
Bond Team to assist with managing and tracking the project. Te team was comprised of internal staﬀ from 
wildﬁre management, grants, management services, procurement, legal, accounting/ﬁnance, utilities, storm 
water, the City manager’s oﬃce, and public aﬀairs. Members from the team were assigned to oversee all project 
transactions and costs. According to City of Flagstaﬀ Grants Manager Stacey Brechler-Knaggs, the City chose 
to track the project as if it were a federal grant, which assures all transactions are auditable. For instance, the 
team conducts multiple layers of review on all FWPP expenditures presented as purchase orders and invoices. 
Te City uses a cost accounting and local procurement policy to process invoices. All invoices are accompa-
nied by a narrative report that fully describes the work completed for the associated costs.
Signing Ceremony
When the agreements were ﬁnalized, the City and USFS 
organized a signing ceremony for the primary partner 
agencies and several other key cooperators (Cole 2013). 
Although some recognized organizations did not have a 
ﬁnancial commitment to the project, they were acknowl-
edged for their contributions and support. Notably, U.S. 
Department of Agriculture Under Secretary for Environ-
ment and Natural Resources Harris Sherman attended 
the ceremony, which showed government support at the 
highest department levels. Te signing ceremony was a 
public celebration and project kick-oﬀ, creating renewed 
momentum and excitement. Te ceremony was a public 
relations opportunity that increased the project’s visibility 
and strengthened the agency-public partnership.
Partner Roles and Responsibilities
U.S. Forest Service
Te political and social signiﬁcance of FWPP led to 
immediate action and innovation at the USFS. Flagstaﬀ 
District Ranger Mike Elson said, “Tis train is moving 
and you don’t want to be the one that’s going to hold it 
up.” First, the external funding source led to prioritiza-
tion of the project. Second, the forest created a project 
manager position to provide consistent and focused 
leadership, accountability, and oversight. Te project 
manager is the nucleus of the project on the USFS side. 
As the project manager, Erin Phelps is available to imme-
diately address planned and unplanned duties that may 
arise, ranging from public information to environmental 
Representatives from city, county, state, and 
federal agencies — including U.S. Department of 
Agriculture Under Secretary for Environment and 
Natural Resources Harris Sherman (above) — as well 
as several other supportive organizations, gathered 
to sign a proclamation supporting and celebrating 
FWPP efforts.

planning. Most important, the project manager cannot be diverted from FWPP duties. The position is “essential” in 
managing the project, Elson said. 
Furthermore, the agency rarely establishes such a position at a district level for a project with a relatively small 
footprint (10,544 acres). This position was set up as a detail versus a term position and is renewed annually, with a 
term not to exceed four years. A detail position offers an employee a temporary promotion, while allowing them to 
return to their former position once the term has expired. 
The selection of the IDT also contributed to the success of the project. Officials carefully selected IDT members 
based on personal and professional attributes. According to Phelps, the USFS project manager, the forest chose 
members who had the ability to “think outside of the box.” Ideal candidates were deliberate, intentional, accountable, 
and capable of project ownership. Other redeeming qualities included enthusiasm, devotion, and an ability to meet 
timelines and make sacrifices. 
City of Flagstaff
The City created several positions and work teams with similar roles and responsibilities to the USFS. The City 
established a project manager to mirror that position at the USFS. In addition, the City added a new position, a 
FWPP operations specialist, who is assigned to the project. The City formed an internal team consisting of experts 
ranging from legal to finance. The City also contracted with GFFP, a prominent and established community stake­
holder group focused on forest health issues, to provide additional capacity. The contract tasked GFFP with: 1) public 
engagement, 2) project planning and implementation, 3) tribal relations, 4) financial leverage, and 5) monitoring.
Non-Governmental Organization’s Role 
GFFP is recognized for its accomplishments in improving forest health in northern Arizona. GFFP’s mission and 
scope over the past 19 years is broadly based on forest health and restoration issues and contains components of the 
principles in the FWPP. This community-based organization was instrumental in gaining the community’s support 
for the watershed protection concept. Due to the scope of the project, the City realized it could increase its capacity 
by bringing GFFP on board. The City developed a contract that included a scope of work amendment with GFFP. It 
includes FWPP tasks that are mutually developed in an annual work plan. This collaboration provided a larger 
community network that could not be achieved by the two government entities alone. 
Through jointly held public meetings, the City, USFS, and GFFP are able to present a partnership that offers unan­
ticipated advantages. Summerfelt, the City project manager, said the City and GFFP have the ability to “act” and 
“respond” to interest groups and residents’ concerns, while the USFS is more limited. This in effect “balanced the 
scale,” then City Manager Burke said, because outside entities (e.g., City, GFFP) can proactively respond and directly 
address misinformation or concerns brought forth by interest groups at public meetings and in various media (e.g., 
online blogs, social networks, and newspaper articles). 
As the project progressed, public meetings and field visits were organized as needed to provide educational opportu­
nities and respond to concerns from interest groups and community members. The USFS, City, and GFFP worked to 
identify a group’s concerns upfront and encouraged them to actively participate in the process through meetings, 
open house events, field visits, or by submitting comments during the environmental analysis process. These organi­
zations understood the importance of listening to and addressing these groups’ concerns early in the process and 
engaging them as constructive participants.

18
Work Teams 
Executive Team 
Te Executive Team is comprised of key project managers and decision makers from four organizations: 1) USFS 
(Deputy Forest Supervisor, District Ranger, Project Manager), 2) City (Project Manager, City Manager), 3) Arizona 
State Forestry Division (District Forester), and 4) County (County Manager, Deputy County Manager). Te City 
and USFS form the primary partnership, but because some implementation will occur on state land and aﬀects 
county government (roads, watersheds, etc.) and county residents, these organizations also have a seat at the table. 
City Manager Burke explained that it is ideal to combine project managers who are tasked with completing the 
everyday work with decision makers who are less directly involved with the project. Members work together to 
identify roadblocks and can quickly determine the resources needed for timely solutions. Te Executive Team meets 
monthly to provide overall project oversight, oﬀer input on completing speciﬁc tasks, and identify potential issues 
and resolutions. Te team cooperatively resolves issues and any tasks developed from these resolutions may be 
incorporated into a SPA. Depending on organizational directives of those at the table, the Executive Team deter-
mines which organization oﬀers the most timely, cost eﬀective procurement solution. A decision log records signiﬁ-
cant decisions and acts as an historical record for others to understand the decision-making process and associated 
accomplishments. 
Coordination Team
Te Coordination Team, chaired by City staﬀ, is comprised of diverse personnel from the City, USFS, state, county, 
GFFP, and other interested stakeholders. Initially these meetings were conducted in person, with the goal of 
This monitoring summit from January 2013 was one of many workshops that assisted in shaping the City’s 
Monitoring Plan. More than 50 people representing a variety of community interests brainstormed which issues 
required monitoring, how to proceed, and who to engage in order to conduct the work required.

keeping all parties informed of accomplishments and plans. But the meetings soon morphed into a monthly 
conference call. As the project progressed, there was less need for this group and the team disbanded within the 
ﬁrst year. Te team continues to share information, but through other communication channels. 
Interdisciplinary Team (IDT)
Te IDT is responsible for the NFMA and NEPA analysis that includes a “Need for Change” and an “Aﬀected 
Environment/Environmental Consequences” report, which was used to develop the PA and subsequent EIS analysis. 
Te IDT consists of 15 members representing diﬀerent areas of expertise with designated roles/responsibilities. 
Consulting members (e.g., range, heritage support, tribal outreach, etc.) are used as-needed. In addition, the IDT 
included representatives from U.S. Department of Interior Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and Arizona Game and 
Fish Department. Inclusion and early coordination with the FWS assisted in addressing ongoing concerns for the 
MSO by the public and interest groups (e.g., Center for Biological Diversity and Sierra Club). Phelps, USFS project 
manager, explained that if the City and USFS had presented the MSO treatments without representatives from 
wildlife agencies, there may have been more pushback and distrust from interest groups.  
Te project manager oversees three main areas that include the: NEPA analysis team, implementation team 
(oversees project implementation and coordinates with an informally designated implementation team leader), 
and communication team. Elson explained that the project manager is essentially the “hub” for FWPP coordina-
tion, providing guidance and oversight of ﬁnances and agreements, public aﬀairs, brieﬁngs, coordination with 
researchers, etc.
Communication Team
Te Communication Team includes staﬀ from the City (Wildland Fire Management staﬀ member and Communi-
cations), the USFS (Public Information Oﬃcer (PIO)), the County (PIO), and GFFP (Board of Director’s member). 
Te team responds to communication needs as they arise. Tis includes planning and execution of internal docu-
ments (Communication Plan), managing website content, organizing public meetings and events, and developing 
media releases. For example, the team organized and participated in several public information events such as 
Earth Day, the Festival of Science, and the Home and Garden Show. In addition, the team assisted with presenta-
tions at regional conferences and open house events during the public scoping period for the PA and the comment 
period on the Draf EIS. Te team also planned and participated in on-site ﬁeld meetings with residents who were 
concerned about project activities occurring close to their homes and neighborhoods. 
City’s Monitoring Plan
Although the Draf EIS contains required monitoring components, the City, along with multiple stakeholders 
(including the USFS), collaboratively developed a separate monitoring plan. GFFP led the City’s Monitoring Plan 
development. Te plan was uniquely designed to focus on answering voters’ questions, and was not tied to moni-
toring related to the NEPA analysis. Question development began at public meetings held soon afer the election. 
In addition, a diverse group of stakeholders contributed to the plan through eight workshops conducted over the 
course of a year. During each workshop, organizations involved with other or potential monitoring projects were 
invited to present and discuss how these studies would help answer voter questions. In the end, the City con-
structed the Monitoring Plan to address four main areas: 1) ﬁre behavior, 2) hydrologic responses to thinning, 3) 
socioeconomic eﬀects of FWPP, and 4) other (primarily wildlife) issues (see: www.ﬂagstaﬀwatershedprotection.org). 
Te City plans to reconvene stakeholders to periodically to review the plan and provide updates to the monitoring 
projects. 
Implementation Team
For the ﬁrst two years, the Implementation Team consisted of select members from the Coconino National Forest 
IDT. To date, the team has: 1) coordinated locations and completed on-the-ground implementation (hand 

20
thinning and prescribed burning) of NEPA-approved sites in the project area; 2) compiled treatment locations 
with their corresponding acreage on an interactive Google map (available on the FWPP website) for the public 
to track implementation progress; 3) completed archaeological, noxious weed, and wildlife treatments/
surveys; and 4) coordinated road resurfacing and boundary line survey work. Tus far, the City’s involvement 
with the team has been limited; however, once the Record of Decision (ROD) for the Final EIS is signed, the 
City will be fully engaged.
Unique Factors that Inﬂuence Success
Several unique factors contributed to the successful passage of the FWPP bond. Tese factors were instrumen-
tal in building public support. 
Te 2010 Schultz Fire. Te experience and afermath of the Schultz Fire in 2010 motivated city oﬃcials to 
actively seek opportunities for preventative action that would avoid another major ﬁre and ﬂood. Te ﬁre and 
ﬂood also elevated public awareness and support for action. Tis fostered a sense of urgency and social license 
that might not have existed previously to conduct forest treatments on steep slopes. Te Schultz Fire demon-
strated what happens when a wildﬁre turns catastrophic, including its devastating post-ﬁre ﬂooding eﬀects. 
However, other potentially dangerous ﬁres in the area — such as the Hardy (2010) and Woody (2006) ﬁres 
(Arizona Daily Sun 2014) — were contained with limited community impact, proving forest treatments (such 
as mechanical thinning and prescribed burning) work.  
Science and innovation. Flagstaﬀ and northern Arizona have been at the forefront of forest restoration 
science for decades. Researchers at Northern Arizona University’s Ecological Restoration Institute, the School 
of Forestry, and other university departments have published hundreds of peer-reviewed articles testing the 
eﬀectiveness of forest restoration treatments. Te last 19 years of restoration and research demonstrate that 
science-based treatments in ponderosa pine forests are achieving restoration goals while simultaneously 
reducing the risk of unnatural wildﬁre to communities. 
Early recognition and leadership in Flagstaﬀ. Te creation of a Community Wildﬁre Protection Plan 
(CWPP) in 2005 and passage of a Wildland Interface Code in 2008 demonstrated to the community the 
importance of lowering ﬁre risk to Flagstaﬀ. Summerfelt, FWPP project manager, said these early community 
eﬀorts contributed to creating an informed public that clearly understood the issues and the solutions. Flag-
staﬀ City Manager Burke further described these unique qualities as “cultural items that were in place that 
made this [project] easier.” 
Te ability of all levels of government and citizens to work together. Several months before the election, 
citizens and local NGOs formed a political committee. Te committee was able to fund “get out and vote” 
eﬀorts and campaign more assertively than the USFS and the City, which were limited to educating/informing 
the public about the initiative. Although the committee has since disbanded, most individuals who were 
involved continue to support the project. Without the continued backing from the public/private partnership, 
Burke explained, the government alone would not have achieved the level of support and the number of 
milestones it reached over the ﬁrst two years. 
As FWPP progressed, a multi-party approach presented opportunities for project eﬃciency. Tiers of govern-
mental agencies (municipal, county, state, and federal) collaboratively planned project-speciﬁc tasks. In 
addition, a public/private partnership (GFFP) provides increased capacity and opportunities that the govern-
ment sector alone cannot achieve. 

21
A small community. Flagstaff is located in a regional center, which is large enough to have ample resources, and at 
the same time, small enough that intergovernmental and private relationships are more personal. Burke described it 
as “a tremendous synergy that is hard to replicate.”
A National Forest willing to innovate. The Coconino National Forest acted fast to identify efficiencies and novel 
approaches to the NEPA process. The district also identified the project as its number one priority. 
In order to reduce fire risk in the watershed, areas that are generally deferred from treatment required management. 
This new challenge demanded creative approaches, such as how to harvest trees on steep slopes and how to reduce 
fuels in mixed conifer forest types (a rare ecosystem on the Coconino National Forest) without risking ecosystem 
type conversions. In addition, the USFS worked closely with the FWS to minimize impacts to threatened MSO 
habitat while, at the same time, reduce fire hazard risk in these areas.
With respect to public involvement, the agency was challenged by analyzing the multitude of comments received on 
a Draft EIS without a preferred alternative. However, this approach provided new opportunities. According to 
Phelps, USFS project manager, the large number of substantive comments received on the Draft EIS allowed the 
agency to “custom fit” public input into the process. 
Primary Measures of Success
During interviews for this paper, USFS and City staff were asked to evaluate the project’s performance by identifying the 
primary measures of success for FWPP over the first two years. Their responses are summarized as follows:
• 
Expeditious completion of environmental planning. The time it took to complete a Draft EIS of the size and 
complexity of FWPP was relatively short — the actual time it took to initiate and complete the analysis was close 
to the projected timeline (less than 3 years actual versus 2 years projected — this projection was based on an 
initial estimate of completing an EA versus an EIS).
• 
Positive nature of public engagement. Public engagement has been positive thus far; potential contentious issues 
were addressed and fears were alleviated during public meetings, field visits, open house events, and during the 
environmental review process. 
• 
Successful collaboration between partners. In looking back over the first two years, there were no major obsta­
cles to deter or slow the process between partners. 
• 
Ability to leverage funds. Leveraged funds tracked by the City have significantly increased the project’s funds. 
The ability to leverage 20 percent of the original funding in the first two years shows tremendous support for the 
project at high levels of government. 
• 
Acres treated. Within the first two years, more than 1,000 acres of mostly non-federal lands (City and state) have 
been treated. This metric is the base line that will become increasingly important as the project progresses. 
• 
Reduction of severe wildfire risk.* Reducing the risk of stand-replacing wildfire, measured by the number of 
acres treated and by adjusting projected fire behavior from high-severity fire potential to moderate-low over the 
majority of the project area, is a primary objective and measure of success for the project. 
• 
Improvement of water quality and quantity.* Improving and protecting water quality and quantity are primary 
indicators of success among project partners. 
* 	Although it is too soon to determine whether the project has significantly reduced severe wildfire risk and the 
subsequent effects on water quality and quantity, these are ultimate goals project partners would like to achieve.

Lessons Learned
Manage expectations regarding NEPA requirements and timelines. One of the greatest initial challenges of the FWPP 
was managing expectations from City staﬀ, City Council, and the community. Each group’s unfamiliarity with the NEPA 
process led to unrealistic expectations for the length of time it would take to complete the environmental planning. 
Although the USFS prioritized the project, novel factors including unexpected changes in the appeal/objection process 
and requirements to complete FWS consultation (Biological Opinion) prior to releasing the Draf ROD aﬀected the 
analysis timeline. In addition, despite early planning/scheduling at the forest level, higher regional priorities resulted in 
a longer review period. 
Te completion of the environmental analysis, however, took one to two years less time than most USFS analyses for 
two reasons: 1) the USFS supported it with directed resources (funds and staﬀ), and 2) the USFS planned ahead and 
collected data during the ﬁeld season prior to the bond’s passage. If the USFS had not done this, the timeline would 
have been prolonged even further (at least an additional year). 
Even though it took the USFS less time than usual to complete the planning, some within the City and community 
expected it to be completed sooner. Looking back, additional eﬀort to educate internal City decision-makers about 
NEPA timelines and regulatory processes and how that translates to budgetary and staﬃng needs would have assisted 
in the City decision-making process. Goodrich, the City’s management services director, said this was especially true 
Partners gathered at the Museum of Northern Arizona’s Easton Collection Center for the FWPP signing ceremony, with the 
Dry Lake Hills in the background. One of the unique factors for FWPP success was the ability of all levels of government and 
citizens to work together.

in projecting an adequate dollar amount for the bond issuance over time. Te issuance for the ﬁrst two years was 
much greater than what was actually needed, and issuing less could have saved the City money in interest. In retro-
spect, Goodrich believed the City could have used cash reserves for these relatively small expenditures and in turn 
could have used the bond funding for reimbursement at a time when greater increments were required.
Be prepared to show immediate on-the-ground progress. In the ﬁrst two years the USFS (on previously NEPA-
approved land within the project boundary), the City, and the state in total implemented thinning and prescribed 
burning on approximately 1,200 acres. Tese accomplishments gave citizens, decision makers, and political leaders 
assurances that the project was underway. Knowing that the public does not always see the necessary phase of 
environmental planning as an achievement — as most of it occurs behind the scenes — the project team was pre-
pared to demonstrate immediate action on the ground. Tis early implementation was, according to Summerfelt, a 
“critical component” to ease public concern/interest while the federal environmental analysis was taking place.
Assure quality internal communication within the USFS. In looking back, the forest identiﬁed internal communi-
cation as one of their greatest challenges. FWPP is a high proﬁle project that has attracted great interest across all 
levels of the agency. Although the agency continued to show support for the project by providing additional and 
unexpected resources, the regional/national levels were juggling many priorities and issues. Higher agency levels had 
a diﬀerent sense of urgency for the FWPP timeline than the forest or the City. Despite eﬀorts from the beginning to 
coordinate with all agency levels and departments, there were several stages where higher levels required additional 
time for review or provided instructions, which ultimately resulted in a longer timeline. 
In the summer of 2013 the USFS and City conducted a pilot project to assess the impacts and capabilities of logging 
equipment on steep slopes and the best methods for slash piling on slopes (to allow for the greatest consumption during 
prescribed pile burning). Lessons learned from this pilot project were used for larger scale planning in the FWPP.

Convey project as an investment, not a cost. Partners were able to convey to voters that the $10 million bond, 
funded through a property tax, is an “investment” in the community and should not be perceived as a “cost.” Te 
investment is relatively minor, given the full cost of responding to and mitigating a severe wildﬁre and the long-last-
ing ﬁnancial impacts these ﬁres have on communities (Arizona Rural Policy Institute 2014) (Cowan 2014).  
Keep the management structure simple. Lastly, the City created more structure in the form of working groups 
and teams than was necessary. Looking back, project team members say they would keep the structure simple and 
include only the most relevant working groups. However, according to Burke, by all accounts, two teams proved 
indispensable — the Executive and Communication teams. Te Executive Team has been eﬀective in the overall 
management of the process. Similarly, while the Communication Team has ebbed and ﬂowed based on its work-
load, it has been necessary to provide timely information to the public and keep the project moving forward. 
Conclusion 
From the outset, FWPP operated under the premise of “immediate action.” Trough ﬁrst-hand experience with the 
Schultz Fire and subsequent post-ﬁre ﬂooding, the public had a clear understanding of the need for the project and 
they supported immediate action to prevent a similar event from happening again. In addition, the City and stake-
holders had only nine months to advance the project from inception to the ballot box. Further, the “high proﬁle”

status of FWPP in Washington, D.C. prioritized the project and commanded a sense of urgency after the bond had 
passed. Established collaborative groups and alliances further propelled the initiative into action. Finally, the 2008 
recession resulted in less federal and state funding and strengthened the City’s resolve to become more sustainable, 
resilient, and self-reliant. 
The first two years of FWPP primarily focused on planning. The challenges in these first two years were generally 
minor primarily due to the long-standing, positive relationship and proactive approach of the joint City and USFS 
project team. With a signed Final ROD expected for fall 2015, implementation can begin when conditions allow on 
federal land.
The FWPP demonstrates how government agencies and communities can come together to think proactively, form 
solid partnerships, and tackle a problem head-on. FWPP is a powerful example of City residents willing to reach into 
their pockets to confront a problem for a project located outside of the City boundary, which had traditionally been 
the responsibility of the state and federal governments. Although City residents voted to fund the project entirely, the 
project has attracted significant additional funding that leverages each City dollar of investment. The FWPP serves as 
a model of the advantages of working cooperatively across jurisdictions to achieve mutual benefits. After all, when 
the values at risk are assessed, the level of investment far outweighs the potential fallout of a catastrophic event.

APPENDIX A – Summary of Steps Used to Plan and Implement FWPP
Although the order of steps a community may take can vary from project to project, the steps taken by FWPP are 
presented in a logical progression and are divided into two sections: 1) Before a cooperative project is authorized and 
funded, and 2) Once a cooperative project is authorized and funded.
Steps Before a Cooperative Project  
is Authorized and Funded
Step 1: Don’t overlook opportunities.
Keep an open mind when presented with an idea that has seemingly unreachable potential. Tis was especially 
true when the City presented the forest with the watershed protection concept and forest oﬃcials were skeptical at 
ﬁrst. Tis reﬂects on the importance of fully examining the potential of a novel concept and being willing to step into 
action. 
Step 2: Evaluate the community’s past performance.
Before a groundbreaking initiative is brought forward, an evaluation is necessary to ensure the public, decision-
makers, and elected oﬃcials are supportive and prepared. Te assessment should begin with collaboratively developing 
clearly deﬁned issues and solutions that the partners have the capacity to address and that the community supports. Results 
of the assessment will drive next steps; this may include further public outreach and education, or building and aligning 
critical partnerships. Tis should also include examination of past initiatives, collaborative work, and prominent events 
that would allow for project success. To assist in conducting the evaluation, see Box 1, “Conceptualizing a Community 
Based Initiative,” and Box 2, “Questions Considered by the FWPP Project Partners” (page 6).
 
Step 3: Build on past eﬀorts and events.
Te best way to communicate treatment eﬀectiveness is through successes and failures occurring close to home. 
To send a powerful message, highlight real examples of what happens when forest treatments are either present or 
absent. In the Flagstaﬀ community, treatments proved eﬀective in containing wildﬁres. On the other hand, wildﬁres 
in areas lacking treatments were more diﬃcult to manage and resulted in more signiﬁcant, long-lasting community 
and environmental impacts. For FWPP, treatment results, coupled with 19 years of past collaborative work, trans-
lated into a pronounced opportunity to move forward with an initiative that expanded upon these prior eﬀorts. 
Although the scope was much broader and encompassing than what had previously occurred, the proposed initiative 
was operating under the same premises and principles as these past eﬀorts; therefore, paving the way to address a 
much broader vision for future resiliency and sustainability of the community as a whole. 
Step 4: Follow organizational processes to initiate the project.
Understanding and following organizational processes is one of the ﬁrst steps needed to introduce a project’s 
concept to potential partners. Te process to begin a project and enter into agreements is largely determined by the 
project’s scope and the required steps vary from forest to forest. Similarly, municipalities each have a set of processes 
and protocols to follow. Te steps outlined in Box 4, “Steps the Coconino National Forest and the City of Flagstaﬀ 
Followed to Initiate FWPP,” provide guidance (page 14). 
Step 5: Develop a project proposal.
Based on the identiﬁed issue and solution, develop a project proposal that includes a scope of work and associ-
ated costs. Once the scope of the project is deﬁned, land jurisdiction and/or relative locations of associated lands will 
determine whether there are opportunities for cost-share and/or leveraged funds from government partners, which 
will increase the availability of resources and strengthen the proposal. Tese factors may need to be reevaluated 
regularly throughout the project.

30
Step 6: Be prepared to show immediate progress.
As the scope of work is developed, be sure to include hard, fast targets that demonstrate immediate progress. In 
the first two years, the USFS (on NEPA-approved lands), City, and state were able to treat approximately 1,200 acres. 
Without these accomplishments, project officials believe public support would have deteriorated over time because 
voters are typically unaware of the time (2 to 3 years) federal planning takes.  The lack of general understanding 
about NEPA timelines can trigger questions about the project’s progress and cast doubt on citizens’ investment. 
Step 7: Determine best funding mechanism. 
Based on the scope of work, identify potential funding sources/mechanisms that best fit the project. In consider­
ing which funding mechanism to use, FWPP proved there are inherent advantages to seeking voter approval through 
a bond measure. Voter support sends a powerful policy message to decision makers, elected officials, interest groups, 
and residents. This approval provides momentum, resources, and increased capacity from government and non-gov­
ernment organizations. Voter backing also encourages stakeholders and community members to understand the 
tradeoffs, which can result in a willingness to compromise to achieve project goals. Voter approval will also assist in 
approaching citizens to fund future treatment maintenance. Lastly, the vote incentivizes the need for transparency 
and accountability, which further promotes the necessary mechanisms that are most effective in organizing and 
tracking the project’s processes and accomplishments. 
Steps Once a Cooperative Project is Authorized/Funded
Step 8: Involve the appropriate individuals/personalities. 
Engage staff members who are excited, committed, and knowledgeable about the project. Find those that “have 
the will to find the way.” For FWPP, having a leader willing to champion the cause made the difference. Without this 
leadership, the initiative may not have moved forward. Both partners agree that personalities of various team mem­
bers created a solid front. In particular, members of the IDT were selected based on personal and professional 
attributes and directly contributed to overall project success. 
Step 9: Prioritize the project within organization(s).
Assuring primary partners are willing to prioritize the project within their organizations provides security by 
demonstrating a level of commitment and shared risk. In the case of FWPP, the USFS not only prioritized this 
within the local forest, but also received support from regional and national levels. This level of commitment pro­
vided the City with assurances the project would move forward.
Step 10: Agree on decision space.
A critical step to effectively implementing a project is to understand, agree on, and define each partner’s 
decision space. In the case of FWPP, clear decision-making roles are essential. The City holds the funding authority 
and the USFS has decision-making authority on National Forest lands. The Cooperating Status MOU included the 
City on the IDT, which bridged the decision space and assured solid lines of communication. 
Step 11: Manage stakeholder expectations.
To keep the project moving forward, it is best to identify stakeholder’s concerns upfront and encourage them to 
actively participate in the public process. It is important to identify the issues and concerns of various interest 
groups early on in the process. This will alleviate potential roadblocks and provides these groups with a sense of 
accountability and ownership. If issues are not addressed properly, stakeholders may choose to oppose the project, 
which can deter its progress. For example, the FWPP partners believe including FWS and Arizona Game and Fish 
Department on the IDT helped to address ongoing concerns for MSO habitat and gained the needed trust with the 
public and various interest groups.

31
Step 12: Assign project managers.
Assigning project managers for each partner with exclusive oversight of the project is essential and provides 
consistency and accountability, and is a critical communication bridge. Additionally, having line officers/officials 
who are continuously engaged (District Ranger/Forest Supervisor on the federal side; City Manager on the City side) 
allows for timely decision-making, increases efficiency, and improves project timelines. 
Step 13: Establish work teams.
To assist in organizing the project’s workload, it is important to establish work teams with specific roles and 
responsibilities. It is best to structure work teams with a diverse representation of partners, positions, and skill sets. 
Multiple, small work groups complete the work required by FWPP. Notably, the Executive Team, which is comprised 
of project managers and decision-makers, is an ideal combination of members who each have varying levels of 
involvement with the project. Members are able to break down roadblocks and access resources needed for speedy 
solutions. The Executive Team also ensures continuity of interest and support from all parties at the table. 
Step 14: Involve community collaborative groups.
Including an established community collaborative (NGO) with a similar mission and scope has the potential 
for steering community support, increasing capacity, and elevating the ability to achieve quality and timely project 
specific products and outcomes. In addition, a community organization, such as GFFP, has fewer limitations than 
government entities, and therefore can act as “another voice” in communicating the project to interested parties. 
Step 15: Establish an internal communication process. 
Establishing adequate internal communication within an organization is an important step in the communica­
tion process and translates to increased efficiency. To manage expectations from various levels in an organization 
and increase efficiency, it is important to identify the agency or organization’s internal communication needs and 
procedures upfront. Looking back, the USFS believes this upfront work could have alleviated some of the back 
stepping that occurred as internal communication processes and needs unfolded. Similarly, from the City’s perspec­
tive, their internal audience is most important to acknowledge. This group is easy to overlook and many times those 
more closely tied to the project assume City staff is “in the know” and supportive. Moreover, fully briefing this 
audience is crucial to assure accurate information is relayed through various professional networks.
Step 16: Educate decision makers.
To assist with project planning and manage partner expectations, it is paramount to educate decision makers 
about partner processes. In the case of FWPP, some City staff did not have a thorough understanding of the NEPA 
process and timelines. This may have translated into improved budgetary and staffing forecasts. For example, this may 
have assisted City staff in estimating a more accurate amount of bond issuance for the first two years. 
Step 17: Anticipate tasks that expedite the project’s timeline.
To expedite the planning process, it is best to prepare before an initiative’s approval. In anticipation of the 
bond’s passage, the USFS began numerous processes and tasks (e.g. data collection needed to complete the Draft EIS 
and PIL) that accelerated initiation of the project as well as the project’s overall timeline. 
Step 18: Initiate discussions and identify deliverables.
Once the project has been approved and funded, a necessary first step is to initiate discussions among partners 
and identify the products needed to move forward. This assures that the appropriate communication and procedural 
steps occur between partners and within organizations. Planning documents like the Communication Plan and 
Implementation Plan were essential in designing and executing the project. Not only did these documents provide 
the background and foundational direction for partner and public interactions, but also the plans streamlined 

32
internal communication and assurances to higher levels within the agency/municipality, whether it was to the USFS 
regional oﬃce or to City Council. Neither partner required such plans, but they were essential in presenting a solid 
partnership. 
 
Step 19: Conduct long-term planning. 
For a federal partner to develop an environmental analysis, it must ﬁrst determine the planning instrument 
(e.g. Environmental Assessment versus Environmental Impact Statement) that best ﬁts the project’s scope. Te 
potential public reaction and subsequent risk for legal challenges are important considerations in selecting the best 
planning mechanism. From the agency’s standpoint, carefully weighing the appropriateness of the instrument (EA 
versus EIS) improves internal risk management; whereas, selecting the correct planning tool upfront avoids back 
stepping and assists in eﬃciently completing the required environmental planning. Moreover, directly aligning the 
“Purpose and Need” with the purpose of the bond ballot measure simpliﬁed the planning process and shortened the 
planning timeline. Another critical juncture was not selecting or developing a preferred alternative in the Draf EIS. 
Te City and the USFS see the FWPP as the “community’s project” and this decision aligned with the need for public 
participation. 
Step 20: Determine appropriate agreements/instruments.
Begin by sharing the project’s speciﬁcations with the USFS Grants and Agreements Specialist who decides 
which authority and agreement instrument provides the most utility. Tere is no cookie cutter agreement used to 
address the goals of all initiatives. Although the speciﬁc agreements used in FWPP will not be directly applicable to 
other initiatives, the process and the steps used provide an example of the general agreement process (see Box 4, 
“Steps the Coconino National Forest and the City of Flagstaﬀ followed to initiate FWPP,” page 14). 
 
Step 21: Register with System for Award Management (SAM).
An organization is required to register with the System for Award Management (SAM) portal (www.sam.gov) 
to give money to, or receive money from, the federal government. Even if an agreement is not funded, all parties to 
the agreement are required to have an active registration in SAM. An active registration assures the federal govern-
ment that the cooperators are ﬁnancially sound and viable partners. 
Step 22: Present a uniﬁed multiparty partnership.
Presenting a solid partnership with representation from a broad expanse of partners, ranging from the federal 
government to a local NGO, yields distinct advantages. Although policy and laws may tie the federal government’s 
hands, community groups and municipal entities, such as GFFP and the City’s Fire Department, are able to react and 
respond to concerns in a more direct and convincing manner. In addition, the multi-party approach allows for 
eﬃciency and increased capacity that a single government entity alone cannot achieve. 
Step 23: Keep the project relevant and visible. Show progress. 
Provide opportunities to highlight project accomplishment. As FWPP evolved, there were numerous examples 
of various project milestones. 
1) Te signing ceremony solidiﬁed the agency/public partnership. 
2) Periodic updates and brieﬁngs of the project’s accomplishments to City Council ensure the project remains in the 
public’s view.
3) On-the-ground accomplishments achieved on city, state, and federal lands were highlighted through diﬀerent 
communication channels, such as in FWPP’s Biannual Report (posted on the website and distributed at public 
events), articles in the local newspaper, and throughout partner networks. An interactive Google map available 
on the project’s website provides implementation accomplishments. 

33
4) Te project tracks and highlights leveraged funds — totaling a 20 percent return on the initial investment. 
5) Project team members addressed and engaged the public and interest groups early and ofen in an eﬀort to corral 
public support. To date, the City and USFS believe these interactions have been positive and both partners do 
not foresee major roadblocks surfacing from these groups. 
6) Te USFS included the public in the planning process, resulting in a relatively sizeable number of public com-
ments on the Draf EIS. 
7) Te early results of the “FWPP Cost Avoidance Study” (www.ﬂagstaﬀwatershedprotection.org/wp-content/
uploads/2014/10/Final-FWPP-Cost-Avoidance-October-27.pdf) assured voters they made the right choice in their 
investment. Te report presented data that showed the initial investment of $10 million was a wise choice 
(compared to the estimated cost of an unnatural crown wildﬁre ranging from $573 million–$1.2 billion).

Intermountain West Frequent-Fire Forest Restoration 
Ecological restoration is a practice that seeks to heal degraded ecosystems by reestablishing native species, structural 
characteristics, and ecological processes. Te Society for Ecological Restoration International deﬁnes ecological restoration as “an 
intentional activity that initiates or accelerates the recovery of an ecosystem with respect to its health, integrity and sustainability… 
Restoration attempts to return an ecosystem to its historic trajectory” (Society for Ecological Restoration International 2004).
Troughout the dry forests of the western United States, most ponderosa pine forests have been degraded during the last 150 
years. Many ponderosa pine areas are now dominated by dense thickets of small trees, and lack their once diverse understory of 
grasses, sedges, and forbs. Forests in this condition are highly susceptible to damaging, stand-replacing ﬁres and increased insect 
and disease epidemics. Restoration of these forests centers on reintroducing frequent, low-intensity surface ﬁres—often after 
thinning dense stands—and reestablishing productive understory plant communities.
Te Ecological Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona University is a pioneer in researching, implementing, and monitoring 
ecological restoration of dry, frequent-ﬁre forests in the Intermountain West. By allowing natural processes, such as ﬁre, to resume 
self-sustaining patterns, we hope to reestablish healthy forests that provide ecosystem services, wildlife habitat, and recreational 
opportunities.
Te ERI Issues in Forest Restoration series provides overviews and policy recommendations derived from research and 
observations by the ERI and its partner organizations. While the ERI staﬀ recognizes that every forest restoration is site speciﬁc, 
we feel that the information provided in the series may help decision-makers elsewhere.
