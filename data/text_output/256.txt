Abstract.
Fire scars and other paleoecological methods are imperfect proxies for detecting past patterns of fire
events. However, calculations of long fire rotations in Grand Canyon ponderosa pine forests by Baker are not
convincing in methodology or assumptions compared with fire-scar evidence of frequent surface fires. Patches of
severe disturbance are a possible hypothesis to explain the relatively short age structure at the park, where ∼12%
fewer trees were older than 300 years compared with another unharvested northern Arizona site. However, mapped
patterns of old trees as well as the evidence for frequent surface fire from fire scars, charcoal deposition studies,
and evolutionary history are more consistent with the dominance of surface fire prior to c. 1880. The most relevant
available evidence of fire recurrence at a given point, mean point fire intervals, had median values <16 years at
all five study sites, close to filtered composite fire interval statistics (∼6–10 years), but much lower than Baker’s
calculated fire rotation values (55–110 years). The composite fire interval is not a uniquely important statistic or a
numerical guideline for management, but one of many lines of evidence underscoring the ecological role of frequent
surface fire in ponderosa pine forests.
Introduction
In previous analyses (Baker and Ehle 2001, 2003) and his
letter published in the present issue of International Jour-
nal of Wildland Fire (Baker 2006), Baker contends that a
high degree of uncertainty exists regarding pre-European
fire regimes in ponderosa pine forests. We recognize the
well-known limitations of fire-scar and other paleoecolog-
ical and historical methods for reconstructing fire regimes
(e.g. Arno and Sneck 1977; Romme 1980; Swetnam and
Baisan 1996; Moore et al. 1999). Limited data make it dif-
ficult to irrefutably ‘exclude’ the possibility of large severe
fires or other hypotheses. However, looking at the balance of
the evidence from fire scars and other sources, we disagree
with Baker’s conclusion that the pre-European settlement
ponderosa pine forests of Grand Canyon,Arizona, were char-
acterized by long fire-free intervals and extensive severe
fires. Here we respond to Baker’s (2006) letter that critiqued
two elements of our Grand Canyon fire regime study (Fulé
et al. 2003): the use of composite fire intervals and detecting
high-severity fire.
Fire intervals
In 2001, Baker and Ehle expanded on previous criticisms of
fire-scar methods (e.g. Johnson and Gutsell 1994; Baker and
Ehle 2001). They argued that there is an identity between
the population mean fire interval (FI) and fire rotation (FR).
Baker’s (2006) letter compared our fire-scar and historical
data for Grand Canyon, calculated an FR value that was
longer than the composite FI values presented by Fulé et al.
(2003), and concluded that the multiplicative correction fac-
tors presented by Baker and Ehle (2001) should be used to
substantially lengthen the value of FI. Baker’s (2006) analysis
is not convincing for several reasons: (1) FR was improperly
calculated because it did not distinguish fires burning in the
ponderosa pine study areas from other adjacent vegetation
types; (2) the correction factors rest on mutually contra-
dictory assumptions, illustrating the practical difficulty of
combining FR and FI calculations in ecosystems character-
ized by surface fires; and (3) the FR is not appropriate for
the disjunct fires in one of the Grand Canyon study areas,
showing that detailed information about fire history is more
valuable than summary statistics.
First, Baker’s goal in calculating FR was to arrive at an
‘accurate’ measurement of fire recurrence. The FR calcula-
tion is:
(period of years)/(fraction of the study area burned);
thus the denominator is (total area burned)/(total study area).
Baker used a list of historical fires from 1924 to 1993,

presented in table 4 of Fulé et al. (2003), to determine area
burned, rather than using fire maps (Heinselmann 1973) or
a ratio of burned-to-unburned field plots (Niklasson and
Granström 2000; Wallenius et al. 2004). But the historical
fires burned both within and around our study sites, lead-
ing to inconsistencies in fire areas v. study site areas. On the
North Rim, where we developed a fire history by physically
sampling 675 ha, Baker calculated an FR statistic on an arbi-
trarily defined 2566 ha. For example, the ‘Dutton’fire in 1988
burned 1332 ha and was detected on four fire-scarred sam-
ples from the Powell Plateau study site, but the Powell site was
only 315 ha.Thus at least 1017 ha of the fire must have burned
outside the study site. If the fuels and terrain outside the sites
were similar to those within, this approach might be fine.
But Grand Canyon is characterized by its diverse topogra-
phy. On the South Rim, Baker cut off the inner Grand Canyon
from the Grandview buffer. However, he did not similarly try
to account for the three North Rim sites, including Powell,
that are surrounded on three or four sides by the canyon.
This means that fires in chaparral, pinyon-juniper, Mohave
desert scrub, and other vegetation types were lumped with
ponderosa pine.
The second problem is that Baker relied on mutually con-
tradictory assumptions to reach his conclusion that the Grand
Canyon FI values should be multiplied by correction factors.
In 2001, Baker and Ehle emphasized that most young trees
(in their view, trees <50 years old) could not survive fire, so
the period between a tree’s germination and its first scar, the
origin–scar (OS) interval, should be considered a fire-free
interval. Where OS values were not known, they estimated
that FI values should be multiplied by 1.6 to correct them
(Baker and Ehle 2001). Under this reasoning, then, a fire
would be defined as all the square meters burned with suf-
ficient intensity to kill all or most ponderosa trees that are
<50 years old. However, in calculating FR values at Grand
Canyon, Baker (2006) used the gross area of the fire perime-
ters, a total of 478 ha at the Grandview site, for example,
despite the fact that these burns had a mosaic of severities
including unburned patches. Yet, for these prescribed fires
to meet Baker and Ehle’s (2001) definition of a fire, every
square meter within the 478 ha would have had to burn with
at least sufficient intensity to kill most of the trees <50 years
old. Such a severe prescribed fire would be unlikely in south-
western ponderosa forests, and in fact the age data from the
Grandview site show that ponderosa trees with center dates
between 1931 and 1970, which ranged between 11 and 50
years old at the time of the burns (1981–1986), made up
86% of the population measured in 1997–1998 (Fulé et al.
2002: fig. 2). By the reasoning used to justify correction fac-
tors, then, the prescribed burns at Grandview were really not
‘fires’at all. We suggest that it is not helpful to advocate cor-
rection factors for FI values based on an assumption about
fire, ignore that assumption when calculating FR, and then
assert that the gap between the answers is proof of the need
for correction.This example illustrates the difficulty of force-
fitting an oversimplified version of the FR concept, treating
fire as a qualitative presence–absence variable, into the com-
plexity of surface fire regimes that include a broad spectrum
of severities.
The third reason that Baker’s (2006) argument appears
unconvincing to us is that it misrepresents some of the twen-
tieth century fire data. Baker (2006) calculated a twentieth
century FI for Grandview, noted that it was different from his
calculation of FR, and concluded that our results were unre-
liable. We did not calculate this FI statistic because, in fact,
three separate portions of the Grandview site were burned in
prescribed fires and should not be integrated into a composite
FI. Instead, we provided a thorough discussion that clarified
exactly which fires occurred and where they occurred (Fulé
et al. 2003). On the North Rim, where some twentieth century
fires overlapped and where the fires were not management-
ignited prescribed burns but rather wildfires or prescribed
natural fires (these types of fires, currently called ‘wildland
fire use fires’, are lightning-caused wildfires that are per-
mitted to burn under pre-defined conditions), the fire regime
was arguably more similar to the pre-European situation for a
numberofreasons(Fuléetal.2002,2003).Herewedidcalcu-
late the FI and other statistics of the fire distributions through
the twentieth century (Fulé et al. 2003: table 7). However,
our point was to underscore the fact that a seemingly minor
change in FI actually ‘would obscure key differences between
the pre-1879 and post-1879 fire regimes’ (Fulé et al. 2003).
We do not agree with Baker (2006) that the data in Fulé
et al. (2003) constitute a ‘poor and potentially misleading
measure’ of the historical fire regime. We did not present
an isolated list of FI statistics. Instead, like other recent fire
history studies (e.g.Veblen et al. 2000; Heyerdahl et al. 2001;
Stephens et al. 2003; Grissino-Mayer et al. 2004), we sought
to provide as much detail as possible. We used proportional
filtering (10%, 25%) to show variability in fire sizes and the
likelihood of fires burning a relatively large proportion of the
study areas (Fulé et al. 2003: table 5). We tested sampling
adequacy with cumulative fire date and sample size curves
(Fulé et al. 2003: fig. 2a) to assess whether the sample sizes
were close to the asymptote of fire dates (Falk and Swetnam
2003). We subdivided the study areas spatially to see if fire
regime interpretations were affected; we reported that the
range of study site areas and sample sizes in this particular
case did not change the results (Fulé et al. 2003).
Detecting high-severity fire
Our interpretation of past fire behavior was criticized by
Baker (2006) as failing to exclude the hypothesis of severe
fire because the tree populations were relatively young. Only
7% of the 173 plots in the never-harvested study sites had
living trees pre-dating 1600 (Fulé et al. 2003) and we found
that ∼4.5% of pre-European-era trees were >300 years old at
Grand Canyon (Fulé et al. 2002), compared with 16.9% at an

unharvested forest site near Flagstaff (Mast et al. 1999). Per-
haps Baker (2006) felt that we deliberately evaded discussing
the possibility of stand-replacing fire in the period before
1700. In fact, however, we commented on the apparently short
age structure and introduced the idea of severe fire as a pos-
sible hypothesis to explain it (Fulé et al. 2002). We did not
accept the hypothesis for the reasons described in the paper
(lack of even-aged patches, frequent fires from the beginning
of the period with adequate sample depth, etc.), but we pro-
vided a balanced discussion of the evidence. It is true that
fire-scar evidence cannot ‘exclude’the possibility that stand-
replacingfireorotherseveredisturbanceobliteratedtheforest
prior to the establishment of the oldest trees we encountered.
But irrefutable proof is not a reasonable standard of evi-
dence for paleoecological studies. Instead, descriptions of
past ecosystem structure and process are assembled from
incomplete and fragile archives, bolstered by intersecting
lines of evidence from multiple sources.
In the following paragraphs, we present additional infor-
mation that is relevant to weighing the past role of stand-
replacing v. surface fires. Baker (2006) suggested that the
pooled age data in the companion forest structure study (Fulé
et al. 2002) could mask even-aged patches created since 1700
covering as much as 77% of the study areas. The forest plot
sampling scheme was not designed to disprove a severe fire
hypothesis. However, to see if old trees were found only in
limited areas, we mapped the oldest trees encountered on the
plots (Fig. 1). We sampled on a systematic 300-m grid spac-
ing (1.1% sampling intensity, each mapped tree represents
91 trees per 9 ha). The between-plot spaces are presumably
occupied by trees of similar ages, so Fig. 1 should not be inter-
preted as representing only widely scattered old trees.We also
added the only other age data available: the inner ring dates of
the fire-scarred trees that were living at the time of sampling
(Fig. 1). These dates are minimal estimates, as most cross-
sections were not collected to tree pith to reduce damage to
theoldtrees.Figure1indicatesthatoldtreeswerebroadlydis-
tributed over the study areas, although some plots included
only trees that post-dated 1800. Is this due to widespread
severe fire, as Baker (2006) suggested, or simply to the chance
of encountering old trees in relatively low-density forests
under a 1.1% sampling scheme? The largest contiguous area
where old trees were not encountered is a group of 9–11 plots
(representing 81–99 ha) in the central-western portion of the
Grandview site. Past patches of severe fire in this area remain
a possible hypothesis, but this portion of the Park was also
subject to a documented severe infestation of dwarf mistletoe
and some tree cutting to control it (Lightle and Hawksworth
1973; Fulé et al. 2002). The limitations of the plot sampling
scheme to disprove old tree presence is illustrated in Fig. 2, a
scene from within the ‘young’area, where old trees are shown
in the background right past a plot boundary.
Surface fire regimes are self-reinforcing by preventing
the build-up of debris and ladder fuels (dense thickets of
small trees). Individual-tree (or ‘point’) FI data can be used
to represent the recurrence of fires at a particular point on the
landscape, preventing the conflation of non-overlapping fires
that can be a source of error in composite FI calculations.
Point FI data should be used with caution, however. They
are minimal estimates, as fires do not always scar recording
trees (Swetnam and Dieterich 1985). Point FI are influenced
by where the best recording trees are distributed across the
site and the number of samples (Stephens et al. 2003). Our
study sites were selected for internal homogeneity, the fire
scar samples were dispersed across the landscape, and we
had relatively large sample sizes, so the data are as good a
representation of point fire return as possible.
Point FI statistics for the Grand Canyon study sites
are shown in Table 1 (the fire history data are available
at the International Multiproxy Paleofire Database, http://
www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/impd/paleofire.html, verified 29
June 2006). Mean point FI values averaged 13–8 years in the
pre-fire-exclusion period. Median values, representing the
50th percentile of each distribution, were all below 16 years.
These data indicate that fires were frequent not only at the
stand level (composite FI) but also the individual tree level
(point FI), supporting the hypothesis that frequent burning
prevented high fuel build up.
After Baker (2006) applied correction factors to the pre-
European settlement fire regime at Grandview, where the
all-scar composite FI = 6.9 years (Fulé et al. 2003: table 5), he
stated that ‘at an individual point fire would have recurred on
average only every 55–110 years.’ This statement is unver-
ifiable because no-one can reconstruct the Grandview fire
history at every individual point. But the most pertinent avail-
able evidence, inTable 1, shows that the point FI values of the
43 fire-scarred trees comprising the Grandview fire history
averaged 18.4 years, median 15.6 years. Only one tree out of
43 fell within Baker’s (2006) predicted range, with a mean
point FI = 73 years.
Finally, multi-millennium evidence of fire regime char-
acteristics comes from Weng and Jackson’s (1999) charcoal
sediment study of two lakes on the Kaibab Plateau, located
∼20 km from our North Rim study sites, showing a large
and sustained influx of charcoal beginning with the arrival
of ponderosa pine c. 11 000–14 000 years BP. The ponderosa
fire pattern contrasted with the pulsed charcoal sedimenta-
tion associated with infrequent stand-replacing fires in the
preceding centuries when spruce-fir forests predominated.
At even longer evolutionary time scales, ponderosa pine
displays fire-resistant adaptations that classify it with the
frequent-surface-fire pines (Keeley and Zedler 1998).
By asserting that surface fire predominated in the pre-
European period, are we saying that past fires never killed
trees or groups of trees? Of course not. The fires were
free-burning wildfires occurring most commonly during the
hottest, driest, windiest part of the year and spreading most
widely in drought years (Fulé et al. 2003). Such fires kill trees

even in open forests with low fuel loads. In an unharvested
Mexican forest with a relatively undisrupted fire regime, we
reported fire-caused mortality in patches up to several ha in
size (Fulé and Covington 1997).The point of contention is not
whether fires killed trees but whether the scale of tree mortal-
ity reached the level of ‘stand-replacing fire’. In the absence
of a universally applicable, quantitative definition of stand-
replacing fire (Agee 1998), our reasoning is that in addition
to frequent fires indicated by the composite FI, point FI data

Park, Arizona (Fulé et al. 2002, 2003). Sampling intensity was 1.1% (one 0.1 ha plot per 9 ha), meaning that each old tree

and Swamp Ridge. The South Rim study site is Grandview.
also show that minimal estimates of fire recurrence at points
on the landscape averaged <20 years. Stand-replacing fires or
other disturbances did not extend over these study areas at the
scale of dozens to hundreds of ha since at least 1700 (Fig. 1).
And because the ecological factors of species composition
and charcoal deposition into local lakes (Weng and Jack-
son 1999) were relatively similar in the centuries preceding
1700, going back some 10 000 years, it remains a reasonable
hypothesis to infer that similar fire patterns prevailed since

the development of the modern climate and plant commu-
nities on these sites. In contrast, contemporary fires such as
the Rodeo-Chediski fire of 2002 (189 000 ha in eastern Ari-
zona), although still burning with a mosaic of fire severities
within the overall perimeter, are distinguished by killing all
ponderosa pine trees at scales of thousands of ha (see fire
severity mapping in Finney et al. [2005] and long-term suc-
cessional consequences of severe fire in Savage and Mast
[2005]).
Conclusion
Our goal with respect to ‘modern calibration’ at Grand
Canyon was to compare twentieth century fire scars and fire
records to see whether fire-scar methods could accurately
detect past fires. We concluded that they could, because we
detected every fire >8 ha in size that occurred on the study
sites since 1924, as recorded in Grand Canyon National Park
fire records. This validation lent support to our interpretation
of pre-European fire regimes using the same methods.
We agree strongly with Baker and other fire scientists that
the FI statistic (or any single statistic) should not be used in

isolation of the ecological and historical context. We do not
suggest that the composite FI is a uniquely important statistic
nor that managers should attempt to use it as a numerical
guideline to uniform burning. Rather, the FI together with
all the evidence from fire-scarred trees and forest structure
should be considered as rich sources of fire information.
Historical fire regimes are used as only one of many
sources of information guiding modern management amidst
a complex host of concerns including landscape fragmen-
tation, dense fuels, smoke, costs, liability, and invasive and
rare species. Although the information is necessarily imper-
fect, there is consistent evidence of frequent and widespread
surface fire in ponderosa pine forests at Grand Canyon. His-
torical fires, like modern ones, contained severely burned
patches and unburned ones. This natural complexity is inad-
equately captured by a single frequency statistic, such as the
composite FI, filtered FI, or average point FI. However, the FI
statistics have the advantage of being calculated from mea-
sured fire dates using a repeatable mathematical procedure.
They can be compared with FI statistics calculated in the same
way around the world. Thoughtful ecological interpretations
of FI data are available (Agee 1998; Swetnam and Baisan
2003). Therefore we argue these statistics are still useful for
quantifying fire frequency in south-western ponderosa pine
forests. Baker (2006) did not argue that the FR was just some
large number. He stated that he had calculated mathemati-
cally accurate values of FR and that the interpretation of a
historical regime of frequent surface fires was wrong. How-
ever, Baker’s FR calculations were based on unconvincing
decisions (e.g. inclusion of different vegetation types, con-
tradictory assumptions, lumping together disjunct areas) and
were not, in fact, ‘accurate’with respect to the data (e.g. com-
parison of the 55–110-year FR value with the much shorter
point FI data, evidence of old trees distributed across land-
scapes). In contrast, a more reliable FR calculation based on
measurement of burned area and fire severity for recent fires
would be useful for comparison with fire-scar results.
Since our Grand Canyon work was published, other inves-
tigators have completed new studies testing the efficacy of
fire-scar methods.Two fromArizona are particularly relevant
here. Farris (C. F. Farris, unpublished data) used fire records
with much greater resolution than ours to show that fire scars

were successful in capturing not only the dates but also spatial
patterns of surface fires in Saguaro National Park.Van Horne
and Fulé (2006) carried out a comprehensive collection of
data from every fire-scarred tree in a 1 km2 area of Centen-
nial Forest in northern Arizona, showing that the targeted
sampling used in our Grand Canyon study (and most south-
western fire histories) was an efficient and accurate method
for arriving at essentially the same fire regime description as
random or other sampling schemes. Both studies also vali-
dated the role of proportional filtering (Swetnam and Baisan
1996; Baker and Ehle 2001) in calculating and interpreting
fire interval data.
Johnson and Gutsell (1994), Minnich et al. (2000), and
Baker and Ehle (2001, 2003) provided critical perspectives
that have been useful for challenging the assumptions of
fire-scar methods. In response, studies such as our Grand
Canyon research and the more comprehensive work by Farris
(C. F. Farris, unpublished data) and Van Horne and Fulé
(2006) have contributed to improving the methods and inter-
pretation of fire-scar-based fire histories. These studies have
not provided evidence of infrequent, severe fire in the pre-
European record for ponderosa pine, at least in the south-west
(see Brown et al. 1999 for possible differences in north-
ern Colorado); on the contrary, they have strengthened the
inferences of frequent surface fire drawn from fire-scar data.
At some point, critiques that use ‘uncertainty’ as a reason
for challenging broad ecological understanding become less
than helpful. We will never have certain knowledge of past
fire regimes, just as we lack certain knowledge about vir-
tually every ecological process, but that fact does not mean
that ecologists and managers should discount what is known
about the predominance of frequent surface fire in ponderosa
pine forests.
