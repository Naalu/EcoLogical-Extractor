Ponderosa Pine Restoration

Abstract
Although there is no one correct technique for sampling
vegetation, the sampling design chosen may greatly influ-
ence the conclusions researchers can draw from restora-
tion treatments. Considerations when designing vegeta-
tion sampling protocol include determining what sampling
attributes to measure, the size and shape of the sampling
plot, the number of replicates and their location within the
study area, and the frequency of sampling. We installed 20
point-intercept transects (50-m long), 8 belt transects
(10  50 m), 10 adapted Daubenmire transects (four 0.5 
2-m plots), and 4 modified-Whittaker plots (20  50 m
with smaller nested plots) in treatment and control units to
measure understory herbaceous response in a forest resto-
ration experiment that tested different treatments. Point-
intercept transects on average recorded at least twice as
much plant cover as did adapted Daubenmire transects
and modified-Whittaker plots taken at the same location
for all control and treatment units. Point-intercept transects
and adapted Daubenmire plots on average captured fewer
rare and exotic species in the control and treatment units in
comparison with the belt transects and modified-Whittaker
plots. Modified-Whittaker plots captured the highest spe-
cies richness in all units. Early successional understory re-
sponse to restoration treatments was likely masked by the
response of the herbaceous community to yearly climatic
variation (dry vs. wet years). Species richness and abun-
dance were higher in wet years than dry years for all
control and treatment units. Our results illustrate that
sampling techniques can greatly influence perceptions of
understory plant trajectories and therefore the interpreta-
tion of whether restoration goals have been achieved. In
addition, our results suggest that restoration monitoring
needs to be conducted for a sufficient length of time so
that restoration treatment responses can be detected.

Introduction
Ecological monitoring is a major component of numerous
ecological restoration projects. Monitoring is the repeti-
tion of measurements over time for the purpose of quanti-
fying change (MacDonald 1991), providing information
about plant populations, community processes, and man-
agement techniques (Sutter 1996). Monitoring is often the
tool used to define “success” in restoration projects and
provides the justification for restoration treatments by be-
ing able to quantify restoration treatment effects (Sauer
1998). As a result choosing an appropriate monitoring de-
sign that is compatible with the restoration project goals is
crucial to the evaluation of any ecological restoration
treatment.
Numerous vegetation sampling techniques are outlined
in sampling textbooks (Mueller-Dombois & Ellenberg
1974; Krebs 1989; Kent & Coker 1994; and Barbour et al.
1999) and in the scientific literature (Stohlgren et al. 1995a;
Etchberger & Krausman 1997; Stohlgren et al. 1998) for
quantifying different plant community attributes. Deter-
mining the sampling technique that is most appropriate for
restoration monitoring goals, however, can be difficult be-
cause there is no one “correct” sampling technique appli-
cable to all study designs. First, restorationists need to de-
termine what type of plant community attributes must be
measured to quantify restoration goals. Some frequently
measured plant community attributes in restoration moni-
toring include species composition, richness, cover, den-
sity, frequency, and productivity. Second, restorationists
need to make decisions about plot size and shape and the
frequency and location of measurements (Stohlgren 1994).
Finally, Sutter (1996) outlined four criteria of monitoring
techniques that must be met to reliably and precisely de-
tect change: (1) Data need to have a known and accept-
able level of precision; (2) data sampling techniques need
to be repeatable; (3) data need to be collected for a long
enough time to capture responses to treatments; and (4)
techniques need to be feasible, realistic, and inexpensive
enough to be maintained long term. In addition, monitor-
ing techniques need to be adaptable so that new variables
that were not anticipated at the beginning of the study can
be incorporated into the existing monitoring protocol. 
Currently, extensive efforts are underway to restore

ponderosa pine forests across the western United States.
Ponderosa pine restoration aims to reverse the degrada-
tion caused by historical land management practices of
heavy grazing, intensive logging of old-growth trees, and
fire suppression. Ponderosa pine forests are driven by a vital
ecological attribute—fire. Before Euro-American settle-
ment low-intensity surface fires carried by the herbaceous
understory were prevalent every 2–20 years in southwestern
ponderosa pine forests and played a major role in regulating
the structure, composition, and stability of these ecosystems
(Fulé et al. 1997). A major goal of ponderosa pine restora-
tion is restoring ecosystem structure and function within a
range of natural variability. Two major components of pon-
derosa pine restoration are the reduction of high tree densi-
ties through tree thinning and the reintegration of the nat-
ural disturbance regime through prescribed burning. 
Increasing species diversity and abundance of the native
herbaceous understory is a major element to restoring eco-
system structure in southwest ponderosa pine systems
(Covington et al. 1997). It is therefore important to have a
monitoring sampling technique that will reliably and pre-
cisely detect change in the herbaceous understory of pon-
derosa pine forests where restoration treatments have been
conducted. In particular, early detection of exotic and rare
species in restoration treatment areas is fundamental to as-
sessing the success of restoration projects because exotics
can be problematic and rare natives are often given special
management attention. In addition, quantifying changes in
overall herbaceous abundance is important in ponderosa
pine restoration because a productive understory is neces-
sary to carry natural or prescribed low-intensity fires that
are integral to restoring these communities. As a result we
determined that species richness and species abundance
were the two most important plant community attributes
to monitor so that we could quantify whether restoration
goals for the herbaceous understory in southwestern pon-
derosa pine forests were achieved. 
We were concerned that different monitoring sampling
techniques that quantify species richness and abundance and
different sampling sizes would result in inconsistent data
and that these results would affect our ability to detect
change in the herbaceous understory response to restora-
tion treatments. The specific objectives of this study were
to (1) compare four sampling techniques with equal sam-
ple sizes to quantify changes in herbaceous species rich-
ness and abundance in control and restoration treatment
units, (2) compare four sampling techniques with unequal
sample sizes in the same experimental setting, and (3) de-
termine the effect of yearly climatic variation on the abil-
ity of different sampling techniques to detect change in re-
sponse to restoration treatments. 
Methods
Experimental Design
We established three blocks of four different treatments
during the summer of 1998 within an approximate 688-ha
area of the Fort Valley Experimental Forest and adjacent
Coconino National Forest (351600N, 1114400W).
Each treatment unit was approximately 16 ha. Treatment
units within each block were randomly assigned one of two
treatments: no thinning nor burning (control) or thinning to
a low level of trees more similar to the forest density before
settlement and prescribed burning at a later date (Fig. 1).
The vegetation at the study site consists of pure ponde-
rosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) stands, which
contain a few large (37.5 cm) yellow-barked ponderosa
pine trees intermixed with numerous small black-barked
ponderosa pine trees. Perennial grasses such as squirreltail
(Elymus elymoides), mountain muhly (Muhlenbergia mon-
tana), Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica), sedges (e.g.,
Carex geophila), and numerous forbs (Antennaria sp., Cir-
sium sp., Lupinus argenteus, Solidago sp.) dominate the
understory. Soils are moderately well-drained clay and
clay loams that are of volcanic origin (Covington et al.
1997). Annual precipitation ranges from 43 to 64 cm with
an average of 50 cm in the Flagstaff area (Shubert 1974).
Precipitation patterns follow scattered snowfall and rain
during the winter months and a pronounced drought in
May and June, followed by frequent monsoon rains in July
and August (Vose & White 1991). Daily mean tempera-
tures range from 5 to 17C (Sackett 1980). 
Field Sampling
Four different vegetation monitoring techniques were es-
tablished in the three control units and the three replicate
treatment units. The original monitoring sampling design
consisted of 20 systematically located permanent plots on
a grid system within each unit. All vegetation sampling
techniques were overlaid on this grid system. The four sam-
pling techniques consisted of the point-intercept method,
an adapted Daubenmire transect, a belt transect, and a
modified-Whittaker plot. We chose the first three sam-
pling techniques because they are traditional sampling
techniques that are well established and commonly used in
monitoring vegetation. We chose the modified-Whittaker
plot design because recent studies have illustrated that it is
more robust at capturing species diversity than traditional
sampling techniques (Stohlgren et al. 1998). Four ran-
domly located plots on the 20-plot grid system were cho-
sen in each unit for a direct paired comparison of the four
techniques, hereafter referred to as the paired sampling
technique comparisons.
In addition, we compared the four techniques based on
the total area sampled for each method, hereafter referred
to as the unpaired sampling technique comparisons. For
this comparison the number of sampling plots in each unit
was as follows: 20 point-intercept transects, 10 Dauben-
mire transects, 8 belt transects, and 4 modified-Whittaker
plots. We used 20 point-intercept transects for each unit
because this was the original sampling protocol for the
study. We used 10 Daubenmire transects so that the aver-
age area recorded for plant foliar cover (40 m2) was the

same between this technique and the 4 modified-Whit-
taker plots within each unit. Finally, we used eight belt
transects so that the average area recorded for species
composition (4,000 m2) was the same between this tech-
nique and the four modified-Whittaker plots within each
unit. For both the paired and unpaired sampling tech-
niques we recorded the amount of time it took to survey
the vegetation, which did not include the time to set up the
plots. We collected this information so that we could de-
termine the cost of the different sampling techniques in
comparison with the amount of data we collected (e.g.,
species richness). 
General vegetation and site characteristic data were
also collected to determine restoration treatment affects
on other community attributes. Overstory tree data were
collected in 400-m2 circular plots centered on the plot cen-
ter of each point-intercept transect. Tree species and di-
ameter at breast height (1.37 m) were recorded for all live
and dead trees greater than 1.37 m in height. Tree canopy
cover was determined by recording the presence or ab-
sence of tree canopy from a vertical projection at 30-cm in-
tervals along the 50-m point-intercept transect. We used a
15-m planar transect located in a random direction from
the plot center to measure forest floor litter and duff
depths. Every 1.5 m, litter and duff were recorded follow-
ing guidelines outlined in Brown (1974).
Point-Intercept Transect.
The point-intercept method uses
a 50-m transect laid parallel to the environmental gradient.
The primary objective of the point-intercept transect is to
quantify plant foliar frequency, as a surrogate for plant
cover/abundance (Buckner 1985). Every 30 cm along the
transect, for a total of 166 point measurements, plant and
substrate (litter, rock, wood, or bare mineral soil) was re-
corded using a point that varied between 5 and 10 mm. For
all plant hits the species was identified and its height re-
corded. Plant abundance was determined by dividing the
number of first plant hits by 166 points. Individual species
abundance was determined by dividing the number of in-
dividual species’ hits by the total number of plant hits.
Daubenmire Transect.
One adapted Daubenmire transect
consisting of four 0.5  2-m plots was overlaid on each
line-intercept transect. Plots were located at 10, 20, 30, and
40 m alternating to the left and right of the transect. The
main objective of the Daubenmire transect is to quantify
plant foliar cover of most species in an area (Stohlgren et
al. 1998). Daubenmire plant cover classes (e.g., 0–5, 5–25,
25–50%, etc.) were not used because they tend to overesti-
mate species cover because the smallest size class averages
cover to be 2.5% per species. Instead, for each plot we es-
timated the percent cover of each species to the nearest
quarter percent using cardboard cutouts of known sizes as
visual guides. Ocular estimation of plant cover is a com-
monly used method for determining plant dominance, suc-
cession, and treatment response in vegetation analysis
(Hatton et al. 1986). The estimates can total more than
100% because percent cover was estimated independently
for each species and independent of canopy position. Indi-
vidual species abundance was determined by averaging
the species’ abundance in the four plots/transect. The per-
cent cover of litter, rock, wood, and bare mineral soil was
also determined for each plot.
Belt Transect.
A 10  50-m belt transect was centered over
each 50-m line-intercept transect. The primary objective of
the belt transect is to obtain a species list of the area (Kent
& Coker 1994). All herbaceous and shrub species within
the belt were recorded. We did not record any plant cover
or substrate data.
Modified-Whittaker Plot.
We placed the modified-Whittaker
plot (Stohlgren et al. 1995b) to the left of the line-intercept
transect at 0 meters. The modified-Whittaker plot is a 20 
50-m nested plot design consisting of 10 1-m2 plots with
detailed plant and substrate information (6 systematically
arranged around the inside of the 1,000-m2 plot perimeter
and 4 systematically arranged around the outside of the
100-m2 perimeter), two 10-m2 plots (in diagonally opposite
corners of the plot), one 100-m2 plot (in plot center), and

vegetation in a thinned treatment unit (photo on top) and an
uncut/unburned control unit (photo on bottom).

one 1,000-m2 plot that documents species composition.
The main objectives of the modified-Whittaker plot are to
quantify plant foliar cover and height for most species at
an area, provide cover and frequency data that has low
spatial autocorrelation, and develop species-area curves
based on the nested design to predict the number of spe-
cies in a larger area (Stohlgren et al. 1995b). Within each
0.5  2-m plot (1 m2) species cover was estimated using
the ocular estimate method to the nearest quarter percent
similar to the methodology described for the adapted
Daubenmire transects. Individual species abundance was
determined by averaging the species’ abundance of the 10
1-m2 plots per a modified-Whittaker plot. In addition,
mean plant height and different substrate covers were also
documented for each 1-m2 plot.
Statistical Analyses
Multivariate analysis of variance repeated measures was
used to determine the effects of different sampling tech-
niques and time on herbaceous species richness and abun-
dance in control and treatment units for data collected in
1999 and 2000. We used the Shapiro-Wilks test to deter-
mine whether data met the normality assumption and
Leven’s test if data met the homogeneity of variance as-
sumption (Milliken & Johnson 1984). Tukey’s honestly
significant difference (HSD) test was used to make post-
hoc multiple comparisons of means between sampling
techniques. Significant differences were accepted at alpha 
0.05. PC-ORD software (MjM Software, Gleneden Beach,
OR, U.S.A.) was used to determine variation in community
assemblages (herbaceous species richness and abundance
combined) between different sampling techniques using
nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and multi-
response permutation procedures (McCune & Mefford
1999). Plant community data were relativized to the maxi-
mum before analysis to omit noise caused by very rare spe-
cies and NMDS scree plots were determined to select the ap-
propriate dimensionality in NMDS analysis.
Results
Restoration thinning treatments influenced vegetation
characteristics (Fig. 1). There was a significant difference
in trees per hectare and tree canopy cover between pre-
treatment and posttreatment for the thinned units (Table
1). There was no significant difference between pretreat-
ment and posttreatment trees per hectare and tree canopy
cover in the controls (no thinning/burning) (Table 1). In
addition, there was no significant difference between litter
and duff loads between pretreatment and posttreatment in
control or thinned units (Table 1).
Paired Sampling Technique Comparisons
The four different sampling techniques that were paired
for a direct comparison within the control and treated
units had greater variation in species richness than plant
foliar cover. The point-intercept transects recorded a sig-
nificantly lower number of species for both years in the
control and treatment units compared with the other three
techniques (Fig. 2, A & B). The modified-Whittaker plots
recorded the highest number of species of the four sampling
techniques (Fig. 2, A & B). In addition, the modified-
Whittaker plots recorded a significantly higher number of
exotic and annual species for both years than any of the
other sampling techniques (Table 2). The point-intercept
transects captured the fewest exotic and annual species,
followed by the Daubenmire transects and belt transects;
however, these differences were not significant. There was
no significant difference between the number of species
recorded in the treatment units between 1999 and 2000.
Similarly, there was no significant difference between the
number of species recorded in the control units between
1999 and 2000. However, species richness was lower in
2000 for all the control and treatment units than in 1999
(Fig. 2, A & B). Plant foliar cover was not significantly dif-
ferent in the control units between the three sampling
techniques for 1999 or 2000 (Fig. 3, A & B). In contrast, in
the treatment units average foliar cover values were signifi-
cantly higher in 1999 and 2000 using point-intercept transects
than Daubenmire plots and modified-Whittaker plots
(Fig. 3, A & B).
Modified-Whittaker plots took significantly longer (p 
0.001) on average than the other sampling techniques to
survey four replicates. Modified-Whittaker plots took an
average of 341 minutes for one person to survey four plots
compared with 55 minutes for four point-intercept transects,
43 minutes for four Daubenmire transects, and 46 minutes
for four belt transects.

Unpaired Sampling Technique Comparisons
The four different sampling techniques had significant varia-
tion for species richness and plant foliar cover within control
and treated units for both years with uneven replicates of
sampling techniques in each unit: 20 point-intercept
transects, 10 Daubenmire transects, 8 belt transects, and 4
modified-Whittaker plots. Species richness numbers varied
between the paired and unpaired sampling techniques for
point-intercept transects, Daubenmire transects, and belt
transects because more replicates were sampled. Similar to
the paired sampling technique comparisons, the point-inter-
cept transects recorded the lowest number of species for
both 1999 and 2000 compared with the other three tech-
niques, even with an additional 16 transects within each unit
(Fig. 4, A & B). The belt transects recorded a significantly
higher number of species than the previous two sampling
techniques, although it was not significantly different from
the modified-Whittaker plots (Fig. 4, A & B). Similar to the
paired sampling technique comparisons, the line-intercept
transects captured the fewest exotic and annual species, fol-
lowed by the Daubenmire transects; however, these differ-
ences were not significant (Table 3). The belt transects and
modified-Whittaker plots recorded significantly more exotic
and annual species than the other two sampling techniques
(Table 3). For example, Dalmatian toadflax (Linaria dalmat-
ica [L.] P. Mill.) was recorded in all three treatment units and
one control using the belt transects and the modified-Whit-
taker plots but was only recorded in one treatment unit
using the line-intercept transects and Daubenmire transects.
Similarly, Rusby’s Milkvetch (Astragulus rusbyi Greene)
was recorded in only one treatment or control unit using the
line intercept transects and Daubenmire transects. In con-
trast, it was found in two controls and two treatment units
using the modified-Whittaker plot and in two control and
one treatment unit using the belt transect. This species is
listed as a threatened species by the state of Arizona. The
modified-Whittaker plots offer good detection of exotic and
rare species and the ability to quantify change in abundance
where the belt transects only offer good detection because
no cover values are recorded with belt transects.

There was no significant difference between the average
number of species recorded in the control between 1999
and 2000 and treatment units between 1999 and 2000.
However, there was lower species richness in 2000 than
1999 for all of the control and treatment units (Fig. 4, A &
B). The point-intercept transects recorded significantly
higher plant foliar cover than Daubenmire transects and
modified-Whittaker plots in both the control and treat-
ment units in 1999 and 2000 (Fig. 5, A & B). Specifically,
foliar cover from the point-intercept transects was more
than double the average foliar cover from the Daubenmire
transects and modified-Whittaker plots.
Combining species composition data along with species
abundance data allowed us to test whether community as-
semblages varied using different sampling techniques.
Herbaceous community analysis using NMDS showed sig-
nificant differences in community assemblages between
the different sampling techniques that measured species
richness and abundance (Fig. 6).
There was no significant difference between the average
time it took for one person to survey four modified-
Whittaker plots (341 minutes) in comparison with 20 point-
intercept transects (321 minutes). Daubenmire transects
and belt transects took significantly less (p  0.001) time,
with an average of 128 minutes to survey 10 Daubenmire
transects and an average of 133 minutes to survey 8 belt
transects for one individual. 
Discussion
Species Richness
Species diversity is one of the most frequently sampled at-
tributes in vegetation studies (Ricklefs & Schluter 1993),

and increasing native plant diversity is one of the most
cited goals of ecological restoration (e.g., Johnson 1996;
Bugg et al. 1997; Kindscher & Tieszen 1998). Species di-
versity is often used interchangeably with species richness.
Species richness, however, is one of two components that
define species diversity, the other being species evenness
(Kent & Coker 1994). The value of species richness data in
restoration studies is to classify species into different
groups based on nativity, functional groups (e.g., nitrogen-
fixers, photosynthetic pathways), and life-history traits to
identify whether restoration goals are met. Understanding
the appropriate scale for capturing species diversity is im-
portant because relationships between species richness
and other community attributes such as productivity can
be dependent on the scale of study (Grytnes 2000). For ex-
ample, a recent study by Stohlgren and others (1999)
found that at the 1-m2 plot scale areas rich in species were
less invaded by exotic species; however, at the 1,000-m2
plot scale areas rich in species were the most heavily in-
vaded by exotic species.
In our study the modified-Whittaker plot served as the
baseline for species richness comparisons because it cap-
tured the most species. Assuming there is some true num-
ber of species, the method that captures the highest spe-
cies richness must be closest to the “truth.” The direct
comparison of sampling techniques at one location sup-
ported the well-known concept that an increase in sam-
pling area will increase species richness detection (Rap-
son et al. 1997). The grain (the minimal scale sampled),
the extent (the farthest distance between samples), and
the number of samples influence the positive relationship
between species richness and area (Palmer & White
1994). In our study the point-intercept transect sampled
the smallest total area (
0.1 m2) and found the fewest
species, followed by the Daubenmire transect (4 m2), the
belt transect (500 m2) and the modified-Whittaker plot
(1,000 m2), which captured the most species. When more
belt transects were added so that the sampling area was
equal to the area surveyed in modified-Whittaker plots
(unpaired sampling) there was no significant difference in
species richness, although modified-Whittaker plots re-
turned slightly higher numbers (species richness values
between paired and unpaired tests were different because
more replicated plots were sampled for unpaired tests).
Other methodology comparison studies in various ecosys-
tems have documented low species detection using point-
intercept transects in comparison with other sampling
techniques (Kinsinger et al. 1960; Etchberger & Kraus-
man 1997; Stohlgren et al. 1998). A high degree of spatial
autocorrelation may be one probable reason why transect
methods failed to capture higher levels of species richness
(Stohlgren et al. 1998). 
Modified-Whittaker plots on average took five times
longer for one individual to survey four plots in compari-
son with sampling four replicates of the other sampling
techniques. Modified-Whittaker plots also captured five
times as many species as the point-intercept technique for
the paired sampling technique comparisons. There was no
significant difference between the time it took one individual
to survey four point-intercept transects, four Daubenmire
transects, and four belt transects. However, Daubenmire
transects captured twice as many species and belt transects
captured three times as many species as the point-intercept
transects. For the unpaired sampling technique compari-
sons there was no significant difference between the time
it took one individual to survey four modified-Whittaker
plots in comparison with 20 point-intercept transects, al-
though on average the four modified-Whittaker plots cap-
tured over twice as many species as the 20 point-intercept
transects. In addition, there was no significant difference
between the amount of time it took to survey 10 Dauben-
mire transects and eight belt transects, but belt transects
captured twice as many species. Finally, there was no dif-
ference between the average number of species captured
using eight belt transects in comparison with four modified-
Whittaker plots even though the eight belt transects took
less than half the time to survey. These data illustrate how
the amount of data collected is related to the time it takes
to collect the data.

1999 and 2000 data determined with nonmetric multidimensional 
scaling (NMDS) for three different sampling techniques: point-
intercept transects, Daubenmire plots, and modified-Whittaker plots. 
Belt transect data were not included because species abundance 
values were not collected for this method. Each symbol represents 
the plant community for a specific unit and sampling technique. Plant 
communities that are more similar are found closer together, and 
plant communities that are more dissimilar are further apart. Plant 
community data were relativized to the maximum before analysis to 
omit noise caused by very rare species and NMDS scree plots were 
determined to select the appropriate dimensionality in NMDS
analysis.

Species Abundance
Increasing native herbaceous foliar cover is an important
goal in many ecological restoration treatments (Covington
et al. 1997; Lovich & Bainbridge 1999). Species abundance
is some measure of the amount of a species in a sample
(Chiarucci et al. 1999). Plant community attributes that
measure species abundance include plant foliar cover, plant
density, and plant frequency. Plant foliar cover is one of
the most widely used abundance measurements because it
is not biased by the size or distribution of individual spe-
cies as plant density and plant frequency measurements
can be (Floyd & Anderson 1987). Ecologists have de-
signed numerous sampling techniques to quantify plant
foliar cover. The three most commonly used techniques in-
clude the point-intercept, the line-intercept, and ocular es-
timation (Buckner 1985), all of which have been used in
restoration studies.
Point-Intercept.
It is difficult to determine a baseline for
foliar cover as was done with species richness because the
sampling techniques in our study produced varied results
and the actual cover of individual species in the treatment
units is unknown. Because one technique provides more
species cover than another technique does not necessarily
mean that the technique providing the higher cover is more
accurate. Regardless, we can draw some general conclusions
about the two sampling techniques used in this study from
other published data that have compared these sampling
techniques and their precision. The point-intercept transect
is a very robust technique for measuring foliar cover when
it is used appropriately (Brady et al. 1995). This sampling
technique was designed to be limited to a “dimensionless”
point where the probability of a particular species being
contacted by a point is a strict function of its abundance
(Buckner 1985). This requirement is often violated be-
cause of the extra time needed to sample small points with
a vertical projection. Researchers have shown that the vio-
lation of point size and point projection can be minimized
when an optical device with fine cross hairs is attached to a
sturdy tripod.
In our study the point-intercept method recorded twice
as much foliar cover as the Daubenmire transects and mod-
ified-Whittaker plots in the paired sampling technique com-
parisons. Point-intercept plant foliar cover values were al-
most three times higher than Daubenmire transect and
modified-Whittaker plot values in the unpaired sampling
technique comparisons. These results are consistent with
other studies that have documented an overestimation of
foliar cover when the point-line intercept transect tech-
nique requirements were violated (Sharp 1954; Buckner
1985; Frank & McNaughton 1990; Stohlgren et al. 1998).
Goodall (1952) illustrated the large effect that point size
has on cover values. For example, when measuring cover
of a grass species he found that a pin diameter of 4.75 mm
recorded a cover of 71%, a pin diameter of 1.84 mm re-
corded 66.5% cover, and pin diameter reduced to a point
with almost no diameter resulted in 39% cover. Similarly,
Wilson (1963) found that the error in cover estimates dou-
bled with a doubling of the pin diameter or halving of the
leaf breadth. 
Our original sampling technique was designed to be
consistent with the prescribed fire monitoring protocol
(National Park Service 1992) currently being used across
the western United States to measure herbaceous re-
sponse to prescribed fire. In our study we used a point that
varied between 5 and 10 mm and a point that was not con-
trolled for vertical projection. These two violations of the
point-intercept sampling technique, along with the compari-
son of our data with other studies that used a similar point
size, suggest that our point-intercept foliar cover values
overestimated the actual foliar cover. Other evidence that
suggests our sampling technique overestimated cover in-
cludes a study that found systematically located points
overestimated foliar cover in comparison with randomly
located points along a transect (Whysong & Miller 1987)
and a study that found species with small outstretched
leaves such as grasses and legumes increased pin contact
and therefore overestimated their cover (Glatzle et al.
1993). In our study we used systematically located points
along a transect to measure cover and our vegetation was
dominated by grasses and sedges. 
Ocular Estimation.
Visual estimation of plant cover is one
of the most common measurements in plant ecology and
restoration studies (Kennedy & Addison 1987). Ocular es-
timates are normally taken within a 1-m2 area because one
of the requirements for accuracy is that observations must
be made from a vertical perspective within a bounded plot
(Buckner 1985). Ocular estimates can either be estimated
to the nearest predetermined percent (e.g., closest 1%) or
they can be categorized into published cover classes (e.g.,
Daubenmire or Braun-Blanquet) (Mueller-Dombois &
Ellenberg 1974). In this study we did not categorize ocular
estimates into published cover classes because of the prob-
lems with overestimating cover values when ocular esti-
mates are categorized (Hatton et al. 1986; Floyd & Ander-
son 1987; Stohlgren et al. 1998). Instead, we estimated cover
values to the nearest quarter percent within 1-m2 plots and
used cutout visual aids of different percents as suggested
by Tilman (1997) to reduce inconsistencies between ob-
servers. Even taking these measures to reduce bias in
cover estimates, the mental integrations involved in ocular
estimation make cover estimates inherently variable be-
tween observers, though observers experienced with the
technique can be consistent within their own observations
(Buckner 1985). To increase consistency in ocular esti-
mates it has been recommended that observers practice
reading cover for species before sampling begins and to
periodically compare values among observers throughout
the field season (Anderson & Kothmann 1982). In our study
both the Daubenmire transects and the modified-Whit-
taker plots used ocular estimates for species cover values.
In the direct comparison plots (16 1-m2 plots for the
Daubenmire transects and 40 1-m2 plots in the modified-

Whittaker plots per a unit) there was no significant differ-
ence between foliar cover values using these two tech-
niques in comparison with the point-intercept technique.
In addition, there was no significant difference in foliar
cover values between the two sampling techniques when
both the Daubenmire transects and modified-Whittaker
plots had 40 1-m2 plots within each sampling unit. This
consistency between the two sampling techniques, along
with the known violations made using the point-intercept
technique, suggests that foliar cover values using ocular es-
timation were more accurate than foliar cover values using
the point-intercept method.
Conclusion and Recommendations
The sampling technique chosen for monitoring herba-
ceous species composition, richness, and foliar cover in
restoration studies can greatly influence perceived under-
story plant trajectories after restoration treatments. Large
area sampling techniques were the most effective at cap-
turing overall species composition and rare and exotic spe-
cies. Modified-Whittaker plots returned on average the
highest species richness in all sampling technique compari-
sons and captured the most rare and exotic species. In
comparison, point-intercept transects captured the fewest
species. Determining the sampling technique that should
be used for a particular study needs to take into consider-
ation numerous factors such as the restoration goals, sam-
pling attributes, level of sampling precision, and financial
and personnel constraints.
Our study with 2 years posttreatment data was not con-
ducted over a long enough timeframe to detect foliar cover
change in response to restoration treatments. Change in fo-
liar cover was likely masked by the herbaceous community
response to yearly climatic variation (dry versus wet years).
The year of 1999 was a wet summer (May–September)
with 27.51 cm of rain in comparison to the summer of
2000, which received 11.26 cm of rain (NOAA). The aver-
age summer precipitation is 20.83 cm (NOAA). These
changes in precipitation were evident in the herbaceous
community with lower species richness and foliar cover in
2000 for the control and treatment units than recorded in
1999 for all units. The monitoring of the herbaceous un-
derstory in this study is part of a long-term restoration re-
search project and will be sampled every year until 2003
and then every 5 years thereafter. Monitoring needs to be
conducted for a sufficient length of time so that variables
such as yearly climatic variation do not mask long-term
restoration treatment responses.
