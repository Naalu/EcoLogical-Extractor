Implementing the Archaeo...environmental
Reconstruction Technique:
Rediscovering the Historic Ground Layer of Three Plant
Communities in the Greater Grand Canyon Region
Thorn Alcoze andMatt Hurteau
Determining reference conditions is a central theme in authentic ecolog-
ical restoration (Higgs 1997; White and Walker 1997). This means that
restorationists must determine the ecological conditions that were present
on a site prior to the disruption of the historic ecological conditions and
identify the possible causes of the degradation. Obtaining reliable infor-
mation about reference conditions requires the restorationist to examine
both spatial and temporal aspects of the ecosystem being studied. A thor-
ough study of the natural range of variability characteristic of an ecosys-
tem and the variability of that ecosystem over time provides a general
framework and working definition for determining reference conditions
(Aplet and Keeton 1999) . However, the specific limits of these variability
parameters range from verifiable details based on scientific research to
generalizations derived from direct observations and interpretation.
To solve the problems inherent in this kind of work, we developed a
data collection and analysis process--ealled the Archaeo-environmental
Reconstruction Technique (ART)-to help us reconstruct the reference
conditions of our project site in the Greater Grand Canyon region
(GGCR). These multiple databases extend the information made possi-
ble through methods now used to reconstruct historic reference condi-
tions and provide additional ways to triangulate evidence, thus making
the resulting data more complex and detailed.
In this chapter we will discuss the events in our research that led to the
design of ART, and the analysis of the data collected by this method. First,
we will present data gleaned from traditional methods to reconstruct ref-
erence conditions for three ecosystems in the GGCR. Then we will

present a rationale for using additional methods to examine these ecosys-
tems. We will identify the methods that ART comprises and present the
data we collected using this methodology. Finally, we will discuss the con-
clusions of this study, present the species lists we developed using ART,
and discuss the implications of those conclusions for further research.
The original intent of our research was to identify the historic species
composition of three plant communities-ponderosa pine, pinyon-
juniper, and sagebrush grassland-that occurred in the GGCR between
A.D. 800 and the time of European settlement, approximately 1870. In
particular, we were interested in determining the species composition of
the understory of these communities. Such a stud y had heretofore not
been done, although research by Wallace Covington and his colleagues
(1997) suggested that the understory of these plant communities had
high levels of diversity. One reason for the lack of knowledge about
understory species is that, unlike overstory species that live for centu ries
and leave obvious and identifiable evidence of their presence on the his-
toric landscape, understory species rarely leave a record of their historic
occurrence. This is especially true when ecosystem processes such as
decomposition, fire, and erosion decrease the likelihood that evidence
will be preserved.
Data Gleaned from Traditional Methods
We know that ecological conditions in present-day ponderosa pine,
pinyon-juniper, and sagebrush grasslands have changed dramatically
since European settlement. Numerous references by explorers and early
travelers provide a qualitative description of the historic sagebrush grass-
lands of the GGCR (Stoffle and Evans 1978; Lavender 1984). Early
descriptions and records of the GGCR consistently include comments
about the extent and high quality of grasslands, noting the diverse com-
position of grasses, forbs, and shrubs. Accounts of fires similar to those
reported in nearby savanna-like ponderosa pine and pinyon-juniper plant
communities are also included in these early records. Today these grass-
lands, if they exist at all, are overrun with sagebrush and other shrubs and
are encroached upon by pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) and juniper trees
Uuniperus osteospenna). For example, Gumerman (1988) points out that
overgrazing in the Hopi Buttes District has allowed snakeweed (Gutier-
tezia sarothrae) and other unpalatable species to take over what were once
diverse grasslands. During the last century, present-day ponderosa pine
and
pinyon-juniper
communities
have
become
characterized
by
increased tree densities, diminished diversity, lower densities of under-
story species, high fuel loads, and greater susceptibility to diseaseand cat-
astrophic fire. The species composition for overstory components of these
historic ecosystems is determined from analysis of snags, logs, and stumps.
Understory species composition for these ecosystems could not be deter-
mined with certainty. Analysis of paired photographs (see chapter 5)
reveals dramatic cha nges in ground-layer vegetation from historic times
to the present. When contrasted with photographs as recent as the 1940s,
contemporary photographs reveal major changes in the density of the
ground-layer plants and the encroachment of overstory species in historic
grasslands.
A.Rationale for Using Additional Methods
We recognized that there is substantial information about the Native
America~sof the desert Southwest: who are described as opportunistic in
their harvest and use of regional vegetation types (Hawks 1998). In short,
Native Americans in this region are known to have harvested any plants
of nutritional or utilitarian value, making extensive use of the diversity
available to them in the environment. Lavender (1997) notes that the
people of the Southern Paiute nation, in particular, are also known -for
their sophisticated use of frequent low-intensity fires. Furthermore, eth-
nobotanical data compiled in part through archaeological site recon-
struction on Native American lands identify species composition and
land management cultural practices of various indigenous peoples of the
OGCR (Whiting 1939; Wyman and Harris 1951; Bright 1992; Elmore
1944). The reports of plant and animal remains associated with these site
reconstructions, in addition to data from pollen analysis and analysis of
packrat middens provide other data sources for the study of the historic
environmental conditions of the GGCR.
To summarize, we recognized a need to (1) gather data about historic
reference conditions from a wider variety of sources than is currently
being used to inform restoration projects; (2) extend data collection to
ethnobotanic, archaeological, and cultural databases; and (3) depend on
these diverse databases to provide triangulation for thematic and specific
evidence of historic reference conditions. We devised a systematic tech-
nique to examine research from primary and secondary archaeological
sites, ethnobotanical records, and historical documents, a technique we
now term the ART.
Once we had resolved these issues, we established a baseline or refer-
ence list for the historic species composition of ponderosa pine, pinyon-
juniper, and sagebrush-grassland ecosystems in the GGCR. We obtained
data on plant community composition from three primary archaeological
sites.The archaeological studies provided evidence in the form of pollen
(see chapter 9), macro- and microfossils (see chapter 13), and human
coprolites, or fossilized human fecal matter (Williams-Dean and Bryant

historic ponderosa pine ecosystem, 5 were overstory species and 65 were
understory species.
The historic pinyon-juniper woodlands contained 21 species specific
to that ecosystem (see table 16.2). There were 111 species that occurred
inthe pinyon-juniper woodlands and at least one of the other plant com,
munities. Of the 132 species that occurred in the historic pinyon-juniper
ecosystem, 10 were overstory species and 122 were understory species.
The list for historic sagebrush grasslands contained 51 species specific
to that ecosystem in the GGCR (see table 16.3), and 102 species that
occurred in the sagebrush grasslands and at least one of the other plant
communities (see table 16.4).
These lists demonstrate that the diversity in these historic plant com,
munities was greatest among understory species. For example, the over,
story species characteristic of the historic ponderosa pine ecosystem of
the GGCR represented 7.1 percent of the total species composition,
while the understory species represented 92.9 percent of the total species
composition. Similarly, the overstory species characteristic of the historic
pinyon-juniper ecosystem of the GGCR represented 7.5 percent of the
total species composition, while understory species represented 92.5 per,
cent of the total species composition.
The ART also revealed 30 plant species that do not occur in the mod,
em vegetation reference lists for Arizona and Utah. At the present time,

1975) to identify plant species present in the region in the past At seven
secondary sites, we obtained additional information on the historic
understory species composition of the GGCR from packrat middens (see
chapter 10) and animal scat analysis. These methods helped identify
plant species that were present prior to European settlement but werenot
used by Native Americans.
Ethnobotanical records for the Navajo, Kayenta Navajo, Hopi, and
Southern Paiute nations and othe r historical documents containing
species inventories of the region provided additional historical species
composi tion data. We collected this information from the Museum of
Northern Ari zona and from library holdings at Northern Arizona Uni~
versity (NAU) in Flagstaff. The records from archaeological excavations
were especially valuable because they involved ethnobotanists who were
working to reconstruct the cultural practices of the indigenous peoples
(see chapter 2). Their work identified plant remains associated with spe-
cific sites.
From this evidence we were able to discern that indigenous people
harvested an extensive array of natural resources from the region and
practiced landscape-scale management that maintained a high diversity
of plants and animals in the region. They used plant species for a variety
. of purposes, including food, medicine, rituals, and construction materials.
After compiling an initial list representing the historic understory
species composition for the GGCR from the archaeological data and eth-
nobotan ical records, we compared this list with contemporary reference
materials that identify native plant species currently present in Arizona
and Utah. The purpose of this comparison was to refine the reconstructed
species list to reflect current taxonomic changes. Botanistsfrom NAU and
the Bureau of Land Management assisted the project by making revisions
to the list, including name changes and identification of exotic species.
Conclusions
The ART used in th is study yielded an initial species list that represents
a composite of all ecosystems of the GGCR-a total of 446 species repre-
senting 279 genera. We then refined this list to categorize the three major
plant communities of the GGCR. This effort resulted in four categorical
divisions. The species were divided into categories representing pon-
derosa pine, pinyon-junipeivsagebrush grasslands, and species occurring
in two or more of the identified ecosyste ms.
The historic ponderosa pine forest contained 17 species specific tc
ponderosa pine ecosystems of the GGCR (see table 16.1). Contained in
this list were 53 species that occurred in ponderosa pine and at least one
of the other plant communities. Of the 70 species that occurred in the

further analysis is necessary to establish with certainty whether these
species are, in fact, absent from the contemporary landscape or represent
potentially threatened or sensitive species. The comparison between the
list produced using the ART method and modern floral lists also led us to
conclude that with few exceptions, the reconstru cted historic species
composition represents a relat ively complete list of the actual plant
assemblages of the GGCR.
Implications
We believe that the integrative use of archaeological data with ethnobotanical
and historic documents to determine the species composition of historic
ecosystems is an examp le of successfully establishing reference condi-
tions. Prior to implementation of the ART, the goals for restoration proj-
ects in the GGCR were based on inferences about ecosystem structure
and function obtained from historic photographic evidence, documents
from exp lorers and settlers, and limited scientific research. However,
reconstructions of ecological conditions that rely solely on data sets from
these and related traditional sources are typically limited to broad gener-
alizations about ecosystem structure. The ART provides multiple, inter-
secting lines of evidence that can be cross-referenced to assess the
accuracy and consistency of data and thus provide more reliable conclu-

sions. Using the ART approach to reconstruct historic environmental
conditions provided new insights about the diversity of species that
occurred historically in the GGCR prior to European contact.
Still, while we have reconstructed the historic species composition for
ponderosa pine, pinyon-juniper, and sagebrush-grassland ecosystems in
the GGCR, we recognize that our current application is limited. For
example, while the results of our study provide an accurate description of
the vegetation assemblages characteristic of the GGCR within th e limi-
tations of archaeological, ethnobotanical, and historic records, we recog-
nize that they do not provide a means to develop data about species
abundance and/or distribution. Nonetheless, we consider the ART to be
the critical beginning point to reconstructing this kind of data and sug-
gest that additional analyses of data from the same records that inform
ART may be possible to reconstruct abundance and distribution data.
The sources of data incorporated into the ART method also provide reli-
able information concerning the presence or absence of regional vegeta-
tion assemblages associated with human use and occupancy in the
Greater Grand Canyon Region.
We are currently using the results of the ART to establish the refer
ence conditions associated with the Kaibab Paiute reservation in the
Greater Grand Canyon Region. Field surveys are under way to determine
contemporary species composition and abundance. Future research will
examine and compare modern and historic species composition to further
