Abstract 
Ninety-nine roundwood bending specimens were tested over the course of seven 
months beginning in early 2002 at the College of Engineering and Technology at 
Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona. These specimens were taken from 
5.0- to 12.7-inch diameter at breast height ponderosa pine trees cut during the summer 
of 2001 from Unit 16 of the Fort Valley Ecosystem Restoration Project located in 
wildland-urban interface of the Coconino National Forest. The specimens were sorted 
into two groups as a function of processing: hand-debarked logs known as tapered spec- 
imens and machine peeled logs known as uniform specimens. Each group of tapered 
and uniform logs contained both butt and tip specimens. This work provides evidence 
of relationships between juvenile wood and roundwood strength and stiffness. Failure 
mode in bending was also affected by juvenile wood. This work also shows that pro- 
cessing a tapered log down to a uniform log of constant diameter reduces bending

strength and stiffness while increasing the percent juvenile wood in the cross section. 
P 
onderosa pine ( Pinus ponderosa ) 
forests of the Flagstaff, Arizona wildland 
urban interface (WUI) are so over- 
stocked with small-diameter trees that 
resiliency has been compromised. These 
forests are at increased risk from attack 
by insects, disease, and uncontrollable 
wild fires (Covington 1996,1999). WUI 
wild fires, such as the 14,760-acre sum- 
mer of 2000 Pumpkin Fire and the 
16,400-acre summer of 1996 Hoch- 
derffer Fire, were fueled by heavy for- 
est-floor debris loads and spread into the 
overstory canopy by the dense thickets of 
small-diameter trees. If left unattended, 
these conditions will continue to lead to 
more and more catastrophic, stand- 
replacing, soil-sterilizing fires (Pyne 
1996) that threaten the community of 
Flagstaff. 
Attention, however, requires interven- 
tion to enhance forest health thereby in- 
creasing forests’ resiliency (USDA 
1996, 1997). This intervention often in- 
cludes alteration or restoration of the 
forest systems through a combination of 
mechanical thinning and prescribed 
burning activities. These intervention 
activities are notably incremental, cost- 
ly, and generate large quantities of wood 
that must be removed prior to burning. 
A local WUI case study shows that the 
cost to administer and implement a res- 
toration project was $2,036/acre, and 
the volume of merchantable small-dia- 
meter material removed was 1.8 truck- 
loads/acre (Larson and Mirth 2004). 
These are costs that must be offset by the 
value of the material removed via mar- 
kets or a rationalization of the increased 
value of well-managed forests. 
The creation of suitable markets to 
use the removed small-diameter wood 
and offset treatment costs is a difficult 
task. Currently, the northern Arizonan 
market for small-diameter material is 
limited to products such as firewood at 
$26/green ton (Larson and Mirth 1999) 
and pallet stock at $36.5/green ton 
(Larson et al. 2001). These low-value 
products, however, barely pay for the 
cost to harvest and transport. They are 
not viable as a revenue source for fund- 
ing forest treatment activities. But, when 
small-diameter material is used in struc-

tural roundwood applications, its value 
and potential for funding forest inter- 
vention activities is significantly en- 
hanced. Small-diameter logs in conven- 
tional post and pole applications are val- 
ued at $220/green ton (Wolfe and Mose- 
ley 2000). The market for using small- 
diameter material as structural round- 
wood, however, is an immature one that 
has languished for four reasons: 
1. There are only a few suitable struc- 
tural system designs that effectively 
use this material. 
2. Coupled with item 1, is the lack of 
simple, cost-effective connectors for 
tying the roundwood members to- 
gether. 
3. These engineered systems will re- 
quire precision manufacturing and 
tight product quality control; pro- 
cesses mostly unheard of in tradi- 
tional roundwood markets. 
4. Very little is known about the engi- 
neering properties, such as specific 
gravity (SG), juvenile wood, strength, 
and 
stiffness 
of small-diameter 
roundwood. 
Expanding markets for the structural 
use of small logs will require work and 
innovations in all four areas. This paper, 
however, is limited to item 4. Spe- 
cifically, this paper reports on the results 
of testing small-diameter ponderosa 
pine logs in bending and includes obser- 
vations made about SG and juvenile 
wood. 
Materials and methodology 
Log selection 
Test logs came from the northwest 
sector of an 85-acre-treatment unit, Unit 
16, which was thinned in the summer of 
2001. This unit is part of a 1,700-acre 
Greater Flagstaff Forests Partnership’s 
Fort Valley Ecosystem Restoration Pro- 
ject - Phase I. It is located about five 
miles northwest of Flagstaff, Arizona 
within the Coconino National Forest. 
The existing stand and leave tree mark 
on Unit 16 were inventoried during the 
summer of 2000 using a systematic strip 
sampling technique with a 0.89 confi- 
dence interval and a 26 percent margin 
of error over the Unit. The existing tree 
count averaged 426 trees/acre. Average 
tree size was 7.0 inches diameter at 
breast height (DBH). 
In May of 2001, 80 of the soon to be 
harvested trees were selected for this 
study. The selection included 10 trees 
from each of eight DBH size classes 
ranging from 5 to 12 inches DBH. The 
selected trees were judged to be straight, 
vertical, and tall enough to produce the 
requisite test specimens. 
The trees were hand felled on June 7, 
2001, and delimbed and bucked into, 
whenever possible, two log sections - a 
butt log and a tip log with a small-end 
diameter inside bark (DIB) of 3 inches. 
Log taper measurements were recorded 
for each log. The mean outside and in- 
side bark diameter-taper results for the 
80 butt logs were 0.176 in./ft. and 0.130 
in./ft. Similar measurements for the 74 
tip logs averaged 0.178 in./ft. and 0.149 
in./ft. The tip log sample demonstrated 
greater variability in taper measure- 
ments than the butt logs. Standard devia- 
tion (SD) for the tip and butt logs, out- 
side bark, were 0.060 in./ft. and 0.046 
in./ft., respectively. SD for inside bark 
were of similar magnitude. 
Specimen processing 
The logs were randomly sorted into 
two sets for further processing. Logs 
from trees 1 through 40 were debarked 
by hand with a drawknife. This debark- 
ing removed all of the outer bark along 
with some inner bark. Debarked logs are 
referred to as tapered specimens, reflect- 
ing that the specimen retains its natural 
white wood taper along its length. Half 
of the tapered beam specimens were 
kerfed, i.e., a radial saw cut was made 
parallel to the length of the log for the 
purpose of minimizing surface checking 
by relieving tension due to tangential 
shrinkage (Helsing and Graham 1976). 
This kerf was approximately 112 inch 
deep for the 4- and 5-inch-diameter logs 
and 314 inch deep for the larger logs. 
Logs from trees 41 through 80 were 
machine processed at Indigenous Com- 
munity Enterprises (ICE) to a constant 
diameter. These machine processed 
logs are referred to as uniform, indicat- 
ing their uniform diametrical dimen- 
sion along the length. The finished di- 
ameter size categories for the uniform 
logs were 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 inches. The 
amount of wood that was removed due 
to processing was monitored. The butt 
and tip logs realized average diameter 
reductions of 17.5 percent and 2 1.2 per- 
cent, respectively. 
The tapered and uniform logs were set 
aside, under a three-sided canopy area, 
for air-drying to a target moisture con- 
tent (MC) of 12 percent. Eventually 
these logs were cut into bending speci- 
mens with a pre-test length of 16 diame- 
ters plus bearing length and trim. 
Green bending modulus of 
elasticity 
Shortly after the tapered logs had 
been hand debarked and prior to air- 
drying, 31 logs were nondestructively 
evaluated in bending to determine green 
modulus of elasticity (MOE). The logs 
were simply supported with a span that 
provided a span to depth ratio, L/d, ex- 
ceeding 28. Deflection at centerline, δ, 
was measured three times under point 
loads, P, of 32, 113, and 179.5 pounds 
and a corresponding MOE in psi was 
calculated for each load according to 
Equation [ 1 ]. I is the log moment of in- 
ertia at center-span assuming a circular 
cross section. The green MOE per log 
was then established as the average of 
the three MOE values. 
[ 1 ] 
Dry bending tests 
Log bending tests of the small tapered 
logs started approximately six months 
after hand debarking. Testing continued 
intermittently over a period of seven 
months ending with the testing of the 
largest uniform logs. 
The bending tests were conducted us- 
ing a mobile beam test machine de- 
signed and built at Northern Arizona 
University. This machine utilized a cen- 
ter-span hydraulic load head with a long 
stroke that permitted the testing of logs 
ranging in diameter, d, from 4 to 9.5 
inches with corresponding spans, L, 
equal to d times 16 up to a maximum 
span of 152 inches. Because there are no 
established standard tests for simple 
beams of a tapered round section, test 
procedure utilized by Wolfe and Mosely 
(2000) were followed. Their procedure 
was a hybrid of ASTM D 198 bending 
test for lumber and ASTM D 1036 static 
test of wood poles (ASTM 1999a, 
1999b). 
Prior to destructive testing, specimen 
diameters at bearing points and center 
span were measured and recorded. 
Overhang dimensions - the length of log 
extending past each bearing point - was 
recorded. Kerfed tapered specimens 
were positioned into the machine such 
that the kerf ran along the top (relative to 
load head) edge of the specimen directly 
beneath the load head. The variable dis- 
placement deflection device set-up in-

cluded the positioning of a small pin into 
the wood at centerline to be used as a 
fixed point from which to measure beam 
deflection. Vertical displacement was 
measured with an accuracy of 0.01 inch. 
The load was applied by hand at a rate of 
approximately 0.25-in./minute, while 
load and deflection data was automati- 
cally recorded in 3-second sampling in- 
tervals. Each failure was located and de- 
scribed in some detail, noting stress ris- 
ers. Particular attention was given to de- 
scribing the failure surface, which 
ranged from splintery to brash. Many 
believe that the splintery mode is the 
“preferred” mode, because it suggests 
ductile behavior. Brash failure is sug- 
gestive of brittle behavior and is there- 
fore less desirable. 
Shortly after the testing of each log, a 
full disk was cut from near the failure 
zone for use in measuring specimen SG, 
MC at time of testing, and cross- 
sectional radius to the first 20 rings from 
the pith as an indicator ofjuvenile wood. 
Specimen SG was determined using 
Method B – the volume by water immer- 
sion method, mode IV – of ASTM D 
2395 (ASTM 1999c). 
Very little is known about the extent 
and nature of juvenile versus mature 
wood in the small-diameter ponderosa 
pine resource of Northern Arizona. 
Voorhies and Groman (1982) examined 
the relationship between longitudinal 
shrinkage and rings from the pith for 
ponderosa pine logs in the 6- to 11-inch 
scaling diameter classes taken from 
northern Arizona. This study suggested 
that at about 20 rings from the pith, the 
percent longitudinal shrinkage settles 
down to and remains at, more or less, 0.2 
percent; a shrinkage value normally ex- 
pected for mature ponderosa pine. In an 
earlier study, however, Voorhies and 
Jameson (1969) concluded that the age 
of maturation for ponderosa pine based 
upon both fiber length and fibril angle is 
about 50 years. Based upon the above 
evidences, the 20-ring count from the 
pith radius measurement was chosen as 
an indicator ofjuvenile wood per speci- 
men. This measurement was then con- 
trasted to overall specimen radius to es- 
timate the percentage of the specimen’s 
cross section as possibly juvenile wood 
(%JW). 
Bending stress at ultimate load is re- 
ferred to as modulus of rupture (MOR). 
It is calculated according to Equation 
[ 2 ]. MOR is a function of: the critical

bending moment, M cr , calculated at the 
location of failure and accounting for 
span effects such as overhangs; the mo- 
ment of inertia, l, also calculated at the 
failure location for an assumed circular 
cross-sectional area; and diameter, d. 
where: 
Load-deflection plots were developed 
for each test specimen to analyze the lin- 
ear range of the specimen’s behavior 
leading to the eventual calculation of 
MOE. Figure 1 is a typical plot taken 
from specimen 17 B, a tapered butt log 
specimen. MOE was calculated accord- 
ing to Equation [ 3 ], at the load- 
deflection point falling within the linear 
range. This was assumed to occur at 25 
percent of the maximum-recorded cen- 
terline deflection. It was assumed, given 
the constant test span to depth ratio of 
16, that deflection behavior was gov- 
erned by bending moment and there was 
no need to include the effect of shear on 
deflection. This assumption is supported 
by ASTM D198 that specifies a mini- 
mum span to depth ratio of 12 for the 
evaluation of deflection due to bending 
(ASTM 1999a). 
Each specimen’s MOR and MOE data 
was adjusted to a single MC of 12 per- 
cent according to ASTM D 2915 
(ASTM 1999d). 
Bending test results 
This section summarizes the most sig- 
nificant results of the bending test pro- 
gram, which included nondestructive 
green testing for MOE plus destructive 
testing of 99 dry tapered or uniform 
bending specimens. 
Green and dry MOE 
Thirty-one tapered bending specimens 
including both butt and tip logs were 
evaluated for green MOE during the 
early stages of the test program. The pur- 
pose was to examine the change in MOE 
from a green (MC greater than fiber satu- 
ration point) to a dry state (established 
from destructive testing and adjusted to 
12% MC) and to compare green MOE 
group statistics to published values estab- 
lished from clear wood testing. 
The green MOE mean of 1.12 × 10 
6 
psi and SD of 0.2 1 × 10 
6 psi compare fa- 
vorably to the ASTM D 2555 published 
clear wood values of a mean equal to 1.0 
× 10 
6 psi and a SD at 0.22 × 10 
6 psi 
(ASTM 1999e). 
Dry to green MOE ratios were calcu- 
lated with a resulting sample mean ratio 
of 1.42, SD of 0.35, and the 95 percent 
confidence interval for the population 
mean ranging from 1.28 to 1.56. The D 
2555 published clear wood dry-green 
ratio is 1.30 (ASTM 1999e). Since this 
test sample yielded a population predic- 
tion that captured the published parame- 
ter, it was concluded that the tested ratio 
was not statistically different than the 
published results. 
Kerfing impacts 
As previously noted, approximately 
one-half of the tapered bending speci- 
mens were kerfed for the purpose of

minimizing 
checking. 
Observations 
made during the drying process, how- 
ever, suggested that kerfing provided lit- 
tle added drying benefit. All logs, re- 
gardless of processing or kerfing, dried 
well exhibiting minor surface checking 
and little to no crook or twisting. 
In the analyses following this one, all 
tapered specimens were grouped to- 
gether for comparison against other 
treatments. This can only be done if the 
impact of kerfing is deemed insignifi- 
cant. A two-tailed t-test on the 25 kerfed 
and 26 non-kerfed tapered bending 
specimens was completed to test for this 
significance. This t-test suggested that 
the group means were not significantly 
different and kerfing did not effect bend- 
ing strength. 
Tapered and uniform specimens 
Once the question of kerfing was an- 
swered, it was possible to complete a va- 
riety of analyses making use of a tapered 
data set that included both the kerfed and 
non-kerfed results. Table 1 contains ta- 
pered and uniform test results pooled to 
include tip and butt logs. This pooling 
was done to enable conclusions to be 
drawn about log processing, to compare 
these test results to published data, and to 
provide guidance on possible base design 
values. 
Pooled one-tailed t-tests of the MOR 
and MOE results showed that the ta- 
pered and uniform group means are sta- 
tistically different at the 99.97 percent 
and 89.45 percent confidence levels, 
respectively. This result confirms the 
suspicion that machining to a uniform 
diameter by removing the outer, mature 
wood fiber has the detrimental effect of 
reducing specimen strength and stiff- 
ness. Processing decreased mean MOR 
and MOE by 20.3 percent and 10.0 per- 
cent, respectively. The cross-sectional 
area made up of juvenile wood in- 
creased by 24.4 percent. 
Table 1 includes a 95 percent confi- 
dence interval prediction of the popula- 
tion mean values that can be used to 
compare against mean values calculated 
from tests on small clear specimens 
(ASTM 1999e). The ASTM clear wood 
estimate for MOR for unseasoned pon- 
derosa pine is 5,130 psi. This value is 
further adjusted by 1.84 to upgrade to 
the dry situation (ASTM 1999e), 0.90 to 
reduce the small clear values to full-size 
log values, the square to round form fac- 
tor of 1.18, and 0.75 to account for the 
effect of knots on clear value strength

(ASTM 1999f); yielding an ASTM pon- 
derosa pine bending strength estimate of 
7,518 psi. This value compares favor- 
ably with the tapered test results that 
suggest a population mean falling be- 
tween 7,408 and 8,812 psi. 
The ASTM clear wood estimate for 
bending MOE for unseasoned ponder- 
osa pine is 0.997 × 10 
6 psi. An additional 
factor of 1.30 is applied to convert this 
green value to a dry value (ASTM 
1999e); yielding an ASTM bending 
MOE estimate of 1.296 × 10 
6 psi. The 
ASTM estimate is lower than that pre- 
dicted by this testing program. As 
shown in Table 1, the tapered logs dem- 
onstrated a mean MOE of 1.55 × 10 
6 psi 
with a 95 percent confidence interval 
ranging from 1.41 to 1.69 × 10 
6 psi. 
Similarly, the uniform logs demon- 
strated a mean MOE of 1.44 × 10 
6 with a 
95 percent confidence interval ranging 
from 1.32 to 1.56 × 10

The data from Table 1 also provides an 
opportunity to calculate base design val- 
ues for working stress design for the ta- 
pered and uniform ponderosa pine 
groupings that each include butt and tip 
logs. These values are presented in Table 
2. The base design values in bending, F b ,

exclusion limit by multiplying the group 
SD by 1.645 and subtracting that from 
the sample mean. They are further ad- 
justed to account for duration of loading 
by a factor of 1.620 and an additional fac- 
tor of safety of 1.300. The MOE values 
are derived directly from the ASTM esti- 
mate, as it is a more conservative value 
than these test results. The uniform logs, 
however, reflect an additional reduction 
of 10 percent, as is suggested by the ear- 
lier evidence of reduced stiffness as a 
function of processing. 
Structural wood members generally 
demonstrate good correlations between 
SG and its various properties such as 
MOR and MOE. When the data from all 
99 bending specimens are examined for 
FOREST PRODUCTS JOURNAL

MOR to SG relationships, a weak linear 
correlation is found with a coefficient of 
multiple determination, r 2 , of 0.366. If, 
however, only the 5 1 tapered log results 
are examined, a stronger and more typi- 
cal relationship is realized between 
MOR and SG as shown in Figure 2. The 
process of manufacturing a tapered log 
into a log of constant diameter not only 
results in strength and stiffness reduc- 
tions, but it appears to disrupt the nor- 
mally expected relationship between SG 
and strength. 
Very little is known quantitatively 
about the impacts of juvenile wood on 
the structural properties of wood. It is 
believed that specimen strength will de- 
crease with increases in cross sectional 
juvenile wood. To examine the strength 
to juvenile wood hypothesis, a linear re- 
gression analysis was completed for 
MOR versus %JW for 99 bending speci- 
mens. A weak correlation of generally 
decreasing MOR with increasing %JW 
was identified by Equation [ 4 ]. Separate 
group analyses of MOR versus %JW for 
the tapered and uniform groups provides 
no improvement in correlation over the 
aggregated results. 
[ 4 ] 
The possible relationship between 
strength and stiffness is also of interest. 
A strong correlation permits the future 
estimate of strength via the nondestruc- 
tive measurement of stiffness. A linear 
regression analysis was completed for 
MOR versus MOE for 99 bending spec- 
imens. As seen in Equation [ 5 ], the 
MOR to MOE correlation is weak. This 
is in contrast to the small-diameter log 
testing work of Wolfe and Moseley 
(2000), which shows a stronger MOR to 
MOE correlation where r 
2 is equal to 
0.53. 
[ 5 ] 
The entire beam data set was examined 
for significance of failure mode. Of this 
set of 99 specimens, 60 failed in a splin- 
tery fashion, while the remaining 39 real- 
ized a brash failure. Only 15 of the 99 
failures were observed to be triggered by 
single knots or clusters of knots occur- 
ring around the circumference of the log. 
Butt logs accounted for 14 of the 15 knot 
related failures. A pooled one-tail t-test 
of the mean MOR results showed that the 
splintery group was statistically, at the

99.94 percent confidence interval, 20 
percent stronger than the brash group. 
The MOE results suffered from too large 
a variability in sample statistics versus 
the number of specimens per sample to 
make a valid comparison of mean values. 
The other parameter, however, that is sta- 
tistically different, at a confidence inter- 
val of 93.6 percent, between the two fail- 
ure mode groups, is %JW. This suggests 
that failure mode (splintery versus brash) 
depends to some degree on juvenile 
wood with the possible occurrence of a 
brash failure mode increasing with %JW. 
Butt and tip logs 
The bending data was segregated into 
four sub-groups of tapered butt logs, ta- 
pered tip logs, uniform butt logs, and 
uniform tip logs to examine test results 
as a function of stem location. Results 
are presented in Table 3. T-testing found 
significant differences, at confidence in- 
tervals equal to or greater than 95 per- 
cent, between sub-group mean MOR, 
SG, and %JW values. The tapered spec- 
imens realize reductions in mean MOR 
and mean SG of, respectively, 35.1 per- 
cent and 18.2 percent between the butt 
and tip bending specimens. %JW in- 
creases by 70.3 percent. The uniform 
specimens realize similar reductions in 
mean MOR and mean SG of, respec- 
tively, 37.3 percent and 11.6 percent be- 
tween the butt and tip bending speci- 
mens, while %JW increases by 108.8 
percent. A valid statistical analysis of 
MOE differences could not be com- 
pleted. For all samples, the MOE results 
suffered from the situation of large sam- 
ple variability coupled with small differ- 
ences in means and small sample sizes. 
The change in mean %JW between 
butt to tip for each grouping is so signifi- 
cant that is was of interest to relate this

these four sub-group mean results. It also

gression analysis. Figure 3 suggests a 
strong relationship between MOR and 
%JW for the sub-group means. 
Other property correlations were ex- 
plored within the sub-groupings. In most 
cases, these correlations were best repre- 
sented, as indicated by better r 
2 values, 
with the full specimen grouping of n = 99 
as reported on earlier. There was, how- 
ever, one strongly apparent relationship 
regarding size effect that was unique to 
the butt logs. Butt log bending specimen 
strength decreased as the size of its origi- 
nating tree increased. This is shown in 
Figure 4 for the all butt logs, regardless 
of processing. The addition of tip logs 
weakens the MOR to DBH relationship. 
Perhaps this is an indication that size ef- 
fect becomes less dominating or even 
overwhelmed when %JW increases, as is 
the case for the tip logs. 
Conclusions 
Ninety-nine roundwood bending spec- 
imens were tested in the dry condition 
over the course of seven months begin- 
ning in early 2002 at the College of Engi- 
neering and Technology at Northern Ari- 
zona University in Flagstaff, Arizona. 
These specimens were taken from 5.0 to 
12.7 inches DBH ponderosa pine trees 
cut from Unit 16 of the Fort Valley Eco- 
system Restoration Project located in 
wildland-urban interface of the Coconino 
National Forest. The specimens were 
sorted into two groups as a function of 
processing: hand-debarked logs known 
as tapered specimens and machine peel- 
ed logs known as uniform specimens. 
Each group of tapered and uniform logs 
contained both butt and tip specimens. 
The following is a summary of the key 
results from this testing program. 
Processing logs to a uniform diameter 
removes the outer mature wood and 
leads to a decrease in mean MOR and 
mean MOE of 20 percent and 10 per- 
cent, respectively, in comparison to the 
tapered specimen results. Measure- 
ments of the raw butt and tip logs prior 
to and after machine processing showed 
average diameter reductions of 17.5 per- 
cent and 2 1.2 percent. 
As the amount of juvenile wood 
within the cross section increases, 
MOR, MOE, and SG decreases. In addi- 
tion, failure mode changes from a splin- 
tery mode associated with ductile be- 
havior to a brash one associated with 
brittle behavior. 
Tapered tip logs realize a reduction in 
mean MOR and SG of 35 percent and 18 
percent, respectively, in comparison to 
tapered butt logs. %JW, as indicated by 
the cross-sectional radius measured from 
the pith to the first 20 rings, increases for 
tip logs versus butt by 70 percent. Uni- 
form tip logs realize a reduction in mean 
MOR and SG of 37 percent and 12 per- 
cent, respectively, in comparison to uni- 
form butt logs. %JW increases from butt 
to tip logs by 109 percent. 
Butt logs, regardless of processing, 
demonstrate a size effect where MOR 
decreases as the originating tree DBH 
increases and the corresponding speci- 
men center-span diameter gets bigger. 
Tip logs, which contain a larger amount

of juvenile wood than butt logs, do not 
exhibit a size effect. It is believed that 
the juvenile wood in these tip logs domi- 
nates bending behavior; overwhelming 
other strength reducing characteristics 
such as knots that contribute to the size 
effect phenomenon. 
The MOR test results of the congre- 
gated tapered bending specimens com- 
pared well to the ASTM mean estimates 
for dry ponderosa pine of 7,518 psi. The 
corresponding test mean, adjusted to 12 
percent MC, was 8,110 psi. The mean 
bending MOE, however, exceeded the 
ASTM estimate for the tapered logs. 
The dry-green MOE ratio was 1.42 with 
a 95 percent confidence interval ranging 
from 1.28 to 1.56. The ASTM dry-green 
ratio for ponderosa pine is 1.30.
