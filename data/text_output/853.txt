ABSTRACT 
THE EFFECTS OF FOREST MANAGEMENT ON  
SMALL MAMMAL COMMUNITY DYNAMICS  
IN SOUTHWESTERN PONDEROSA PINE ECOSYSTEMS 
Elizabeth L. Kalies 
In the southwestern United States, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests 
have been decreasing in biological diversity for the past century.  Today’s forests are 
characterized by dense stands of small-diameter trees that are susceptible to stand-
replacing crown fires.  There is now an emphasis on ecological restoration in the 
Southwest, whereby forests are thinned to reduce fuel content so that the natural fire 
regime can be reintroduced.  However, given the multiple impacts humans have had on 
the landscape over the past 100 years, it is unclear whether thinning and burning 
treatments will restore all aspects of ecosystem health.  Given this uncertainty, 
managers and stakeholders want information on the impacts of treatments on multiple 
ecosystem components, including wildlife.   
I used meta-analysis to compare effects of restoration treatments on wildlife 
species in southwestern conifer forests.  Thinning and burning treatments had positive 
effects on most small mammals and passerine bird species reported in 25 studies 
suitable for meta-analysis; overstory removal and wildfire resulted in an overall 
negative response.  I recommend that managers implement thinning and burning 
treatments, but that future research efforts focus on long-term responses of species at 
larger spatial scales and target species for which there is a paucity of data.

No comprehensive analysis of the small mammal community in response to 
restoration treatments at large scales has been conducted in ponderosa pine forests.  
Small mammals are important in forest ecosystems in serving as prey, recycling 
nutrients, dispersing fungal spores and seeds, and aerating soils.  During 2006-2009, I 
trapped eight species of small mammals at 294 sites in northern Arizona, and used 
occupancy modeling to determine wildlife responses to habitat.  The most important 
habitat variables in predicting small mammal community occupancy were pine basal 
area, treatment intensity (percent of trees removed and time since treatment), the 
number and length of time slash piles are left on the ground, rock cover, and snags 
>40cm diameter.  The average occupancy of all species was positively related to 
thinning treatment and slash.  No one treatment benefitted all species, but rather an 
arrangement of dense and open stands across the landscape with heterogeneity in fine-
scale features is likely the best management approach for restoring and maintaining a 
diverse small mammal community. 
Similarly, community composition differed in each of 6 years following 
treatment, but total density remained constant.  Total species densities were 
significantly lower in stands with dense conditions than in stands with more open 
structural conditions similar to those of presettlement times, which had similar small 
mammal densities as the thinning treatments.  In addition, tassel-eared squirrels 
(Sciurus aberti), golden-mantled ground squirrels (Spermophilus lateralis), and gray-
collared chipmunks (Tamias cinereicollis) appeared to play a functionally redundant 
role in dispersing ectomycorrhizal fungi across different stand structures.  These results 

iv 
 
suggest that restoration treatments can maintain ecosystem stability in terms of small 
mammal community structure and function.   
  Finally, I found that the rapid assessment, occupancy and density modeling 
approach was highly effective in evaluating the response of the small mammal 
community to treatment and other habitat attributes.  Particularly in the arid Southwest, 
most small mammal population studies end up primarily tracking precipitation patterns, 
but I showed a lack of a year effect by all species.  Although this study was a big effort, 
it obtained more reliable, repeatable results for a greater number of species than many 
equally-intensive small mammal studies with similar objectives, which relied on mark-
recapture methods and density estimation.  I suggest this design be utilized in other 
studies that grapple with high variability and large spatial and temporal scales in 
assessing general impacts of treatments or habitat change on wildlife species.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
As an academic advisor and an ambassador for the Southwest, Wally Covington 
has been the foundation for my journey into the ponderosa pine ecosystem.  I have 
learned so much in the last five years and am now proud to call this forest my own; 
thank you for everything you have done for me.  Similarly, I didn’t know a ground 
squirrel from a chipmunk before I met Carol Chambers, who taught me most of what I 
know about wildlife, and has also been a confidant and friend.  Paul Beier and Tom Sisk 
have been enthusiastic and supportive of my work from the beginning, and I am 
honored that they are a part of this research.  Perhaps most importantly, the entire 
committee gave me the freedom to pursue this project largely on my own, knowing I 
would learn from frustration as well as success.  I truly appreciate their confidence in 
me over the last five years. 
A huge thanks to my co-author and friend Brett Dickson, who has served as an 
ad-hoc committee member for the last several years, and gave me the confidence to 
become a quantitative ecologist. 
The trapping study simply would not have happened without a huge team of 
small mammal enthusiasts.  Thanks to Chrystal Redding in helping me negotiate the 
animal handling permitting process; JJ Smith for hours of patient assistance in finding, 
losing, and re-finding site locations; and Don Normandin for being there at every turn to 
help with logistics and emotional support.  I was also fortunate to have four crew 
leaders to whom I owe my sanity; I am indebted to Kevin Barrett, Ian Johnson, Ian Hyp, 
and Kristen Pearson for their investment in this research.  In addition, there are too 

vi 
 
many ERI field technicians to list but thanks especially to my devoted mammal-ers 
including Ash Bedford, Austin Lyons, Marie de la Faye, Damien Zona, Rachael 
Dickson, Ryan Thomas, Erin Saunders, Kelcey Mead, Jason Huyck, Nora Sutherland, 
Kelsey Adelmeyer, Patrick Shin, and Avianna Acid.   
The tremendous administrative support team at ERI and SOF includes Scott 
Curran who built me the coolest database of all time, and Linsey Baker, Karen 
Gilbreath, Robin Long, April Sandoval, and Kathy Mitchell all of whom responded to 
my every annoying email and request with a smile.   
People who helped me early on to conceive of this project include Christina 
Voijta, Sarah Converse, and Paul Doherty.  I also relied on the wisdom of the squirrel-
ers who came before me including David Patton, Syl Alred, and Tad Theimer.  Ernie 
Kurmes and Pat Hall were among the first people at NAU to welcome me into the 
wildlife-forestry world, and have continued to be supportive along the way.  
My sincere thanks to Katie Stumpf for being my model selection expert; Isa 
Côté and Bala Chaudhary for help with the meta-analysis; Pete Fulé for countless bits of 
Southwest wisdom; Andy Sanchez-Meador for humoring many inquires about tree 
evenness; Steve Sesnie for mastery of all things GIS; Daniel Laughlin for statistical 
genius; Kitty Gerhing and Jackie Johnson for insight and labor with the fungal work; 
and Steve Rosenstock, Sarah Reif, Andi Rogers, Catherine Wightman, Fenner 
Yarborough, Rick Miller, and Norris Dodd of Arizona Game and Fish for assistance, 
expertise, and continued enthusiasm for this project.

My funding sources have been diverse and generous; my thanks to the ARCS 
Foundation for three years of support, the Garden Club of America’s Fellowship in 
Ecological Restoration, Arizona Game and Fish’s Wildlife Conservation Fund grant, 
and the Arizona Chapter of The Wildlife Society.  And of course, this work would not 
have been possible without the Ecological Restoration Institute. 
I owe a lot to Cat Burns for being my small mammal inspiration, and Os 
Schmitz for believing in me as a confused and scattered Master’s student; I hope to 
continue to work with both of you for the rest of my career.  My fellow graduate 
students at NAU have been critical for emotional support.  Finally, thanks to my parents 
for instilling in me a love of learning and apparently the trait of perseverance; and to 
both my parents and in-laws for unconditional support and countless hours of 
babysitting. 
Finally, to Alex for being the unique partner who can answer questions such as 
“why did I ever decide to get a PhD and have a baby at the same time?” and “what is 
the recommended method for measuring canopy cover?” with equal authority and 
reassurance; thanks for everything.  Baby #2, thank you for literally being a part of the 
last step of this journey, your presence was more calming than you’ll know.  And Pri, I 
thought I would finish in spite of you but instead I did because of you.  Thank you for 
showing me the value of every moment.

PREFACE 
This dissertation is an integrated set of research projects designed to answer key 
questions about the effects of ecological restoration treatments in southwestern 
ponderosa pine forests on wildlife composition and function.  It has been prepared in 
manuscript format with Chapters 2, 3, and 4 designed as manuscripts for publication, 
resulting in some redundancy among chapters.  Chapter 2, “Wildlife responses to 
thinning and burning treatments in southwestern conifer forests: A meta-analysis” was 
published by Forest Ecology and Management (259 (2010) 333-342).  Chapter 3, 
“Thinning and slash treatments increase occupancy of the small mammal community in 
ponderosa pine forests, northern Arizona,” will be submitted to Ecological 
Applications.  Chapter 4, “Small mammal community maintains stability through 
compositional and functional compensation in response to disturbance in a southwestern 
ponderosa pine forest ecosystem,” will be submitted to Ecology.  Chapter 1 is the 
introduction and literature review, and Chapter 5 presents overall results and 
conclusions from the entire dissertation.  Since each manuscript chapter has its own 
introduction and conclusions, Chapters 1 and 5 are greatly foreshortened.

CHAPTER 1 
INTRODUCTION 
After a century of fire suppression, logging, and grazing, ponderosa pine forests 
in the southwestern United States have undergone a dramatic departure from conditions 
that existed prior to Euro-American settlement (Cooper 1960, Covington and Moore 
1994, Swetnam et al. 1999).  Today’s ponderosa pine forests are characterized by the 
over-representation of homogenous, dense, small-diameter stands that are susceptible to 
stand-replacing crown fires (Fulé et al. 1997).   This differs from the natural fire regime 
that used to occur on a 2-25 cycle at low intensity, which would maintain forests by 
removing the understory and small diameter trees (Covington 2003).  There is now an 
emphasis on ecological restoration in the Southwest, whereby forests are thinned to 
approximate presettlement structural conditions so that the natural fire regime can be 
safely reintroduced.   
Today’s overly dense ponderosa pine forests not only pose a fire threat to 
humans, but ecosystems appear to be in general decline (Covington 2000).  Changes in 
biotic and abiotic features include reductions in tree growth (Feeney et al. 1998), rates 
of decomposition and nutrient cycling (Selmants et al. 2003), water availability and 
ground water recharge (Baker 2003), and biological diversity (Chambers and Germaine 
2003); and  increased disease and insect infestation (Kolb et al. 1998).  Of greatest 
concern has been a shift from low intensity surface fires to increasingly large and severe 
crown fires (Westerling et al. 2006).  The intent of ecological restoration is not just to 
reduce fire risk, but to restore ecosystem biodiversity at all trophic and organizational 
levels, and in terms of composition, structure, function (Noss 1990).   

2 
 
In the long term, restoration treatments should create forest structures consistent 
with those that existed before fire exclusion: an open, patchy structure of mostly mature 
trees with herbaceous ground cover (Moore et al. 1999).  This increased spatial and 
temporal heterogeneity will diversify habitat available for wildlife, and should, in 
theory, restore the native, diverse assemblage of animal species.  However, both 
ecological restoration treatments and thinning treatments are being implemented across 
thousands of hectares in the ponderosa pine forests of northern Arizona, with limited 
quantitative data regarding wildlife responses.  The literature that does exist is 
dominated by avian and single-species studies (e.g., Germaine and Germaine 2002, 
Germaine et al. 2004, Martin et al. 2005, Wightman and Germaine 2006, Hurteau et al. 
2008, Dickson et al. 2009, Pope et al. 2009).  Most studies are limited in temporal and 
spatial scale.  A more in-depth review of wildlife responses to restoration and thinning 
and burning treatments is the topic of Chapter 2.   
Small mammals commonly present in ponderosa pine forests of the Southwest 
include voles (Microtus spp.), woodrats (Neotoma spp.), ground and tree squirrels 
(Spermophilus and Sciurus spp.), mice (Peromyscus spp.), chipmunks (Tamias spp.), 
and gophers (Thomomys spp.).  Previous research suggests that tassel-eared squirrels 
(Sciurus aberti) may respond negatively to restoration treatments and the reduction in 
ponderosa pine tree density and basal area (Patton et al. 1985, Dodd et al. 2003, Dodd et 
al. 2006).  However, species such as the Mogollon vole (Microtus mogollonensis) and 
golden-mantled ground squirrel (Spermophilus lateralis) may benefit from the increased 
understory vegetation cover (Tevis 1956, Converse et al. 2006a, Bagne and Finch 
2009).  The most comprehensive studies on small mammal community responses to 

3 
 
restoration treatments in the Southwest found that mice and chipmunks responded 
positively to treatments, but other species results were inconclusive and compromised 
by small temporal and spatial scales (Converse et al. 2006a, Converse et al. 2006b).     
Biodiversity of the small mammal community is not truly restored unless 
composition (abundance and diversity), structure (competition and interspecific 
relationships), and function (productivity and nutrient cycling) are restored as well.  A 
diverse community should be able to maintain ecosystem functioning in the face of 
environmental change due to redundancy in their functional roles (Chesson et al. 2002).   
Small mammals are important in forest ecosystems in recycling nutrients by processing 
vegetation, dispersing fungal spores and seeds, and aerating and turning soils while 
digging (Cork and Kenagy 1989, Boal and Mannan 1994).  Small mammals also 
provide a substantial part of the prey base for predators including the northern goshawk 
(Accipiter gentilis; a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service species of concern), Mexican 
spotted owl (Strix occidentalis lucida; federally threatened), and other avian and 
mammalian predators (Boal and Mannan 1994, Block et al. 2005).  The dispersion of 
ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi is almost entirely reliant on small mammal disturbance and 
transfer through feces (Johnson 1996).  Tassel-eared squirrels are key players in the 
dispersal of EM fungi in southwestern ponderosa pine forests (Kotter and Farentinos 
1984, States 1984, Dodd et al. 2003), and ground squirrels, chipmunks, and other 
species may play this role as well (Pyare and Longland 2001).  Thus, community 
members may play redundant functional roles in dispersing EM spores in the different 
stand structures they occupy, and thus maintain this ecosystem function over different 
habitat types.  While fungal dispersion is not necessarily the most important function 

4 
 
the community provides, I used it in this study to represent whether or not functional 
redundancy occurred within the community. 
In designing forest management treatments it is critical to consider the 
associated impacts on small mammal biodiversity.  However, no comprehensive 
analysis of the small mammal community in response to restoration treatments at large 
spatial (>16 sites) scales has been conducted in ponderosa pine forests.  The broad 
purpose of this study was to assess changes in the small mammal biodiversity as a result 
of restoration and fuels reduction treatments in southwestern ponderosa pine forests.  
During 2006-2009, I trapped eight species of small mammals at 294 sites in northern 
Arizona, and used occupancy modeling to determine small mammal community 
responses to thinning treatments and habitat features.  In Chapter 3, I analyzed small 
mammal occupancy responses to thinning treatments, slash piles, overstory and 
understory composition and structure, and other habitat features.  I provided 
management recommendations for reducing the impact of ecological restoration 
treatments on small mammals.  In Chapter 4, I analyzed density trends within the small 
mammal community in order to understand community compositional tradeoffs in 
response to disturbance.  I further explored how these tradeoffs related to changes in 
ecosystem function.  Thus, I evaluated impacts of ecological restoration on the small 
mammal community in terms of compositional, structural, and functional diversity.

CHAPTER 2 
WILDLIFE RESPONSES TO THINNING AND BURNING TREATMENTS IN 
SOUTHWESTERN CONIFER FORESTS: A META-ANALYSIS 
Abstract 
After a century of fire suppression, conifer forests in the western United States 
have dramatically departed from conditions that existed prior to Euro-American 
settlement, with heavy fuel loads and an increased incidence of wildfire.  To reduce this 
threat and improve overall forest health, land managers are designing landscape-scale 
treatments that strategically locate thinning and burning treatments to disrupt fuel 
continuity, allowing managed wildfires to burn the remaining area.  A necessary step in 
designing and evaluating these treatments is understanding their ecological effects on 
wildlife.  We used meta-analysis to compare effects of small-diameter removal 
(thinnings and shelterwoods) and burning treatments, selective harvesting, overstory 
removal (including clearcutting), and wildfire on wildlife species in southwestern 
conifer forests.  We hypothesized that small-diameter removal and burning treatments 
would have minimal effects on wildlife compared to other treatments.  We found 33 
studies that met our criteria by (1) comparing density or reproductive output for wildlife 
species, (2) using forest management or wildfire treatments, (3) implementing control-
impact or before-after control-impact design using unmanaged stands as controls, and 
(4) occurring in Arizona or New Mexico ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) or mixed 
conifer (Abies/Picea/Pinus) forest.  The 22 studies suitable for meta-analysis occurred 
≤20 years post-treatment on sites <400ha.  Small-diameter harvest and burning 
treatments had positive effects but thin/burn and selective harvest treatments had no 

12 
 
detectable effect on most small mammals and passerine bird species reported in studies; 
overstory removal and wildfire resulted in an overall negative response.  We examined 
foraging guild responses to treatments; ground-foraging birds and rodents had no strong 
response. Aerial-, tree-, and bole-foraging birds had positive or neutral responses to the 
small-diameter removal and burning treatments, but negative responses to overstory 
removal and wildfire.  Small-diameter removal and burning treatments as currently 
being implemented in the Southwest do not negatively impact most of the wildlife 
species in the studies we examined in the short term (≤10 yrs). We believe a 
combination of treatments in a patchy arrangement across the landscape will result in 
the highest diversity and density.  We recommend that managers implement thinning 
and burning treatments, but that future research efforts focus on long-term responses of 
species at larger spatial scales, use reproductive output as a more informative response 
variable, and target species for which there is a paucity of data. 
Key Words: treatment, clearcut, wildfire, density response, meta-analysis, Pinus

Introduction 
After a century of fire suppression, conifer forests in the western United States 
have dramatically departed from conditions that existed prior to Euro-American 
settlement (Covington and Moore 1994, Taylor and Skinner 1998, Fry and Stephens 
2006).  With the resulting dense forest conditions and heavy fuel loads, wildfires are 
increasing in frequency and severity (Covington 2000).  To reduce this threat and the 
decline in ecosystem health in frequent fire forests, land managers are devising 
landscape-scale restoration treatments that would re-establish open forest conditions 

13 
 
and allow frequent fire to safely return to its role in regulating tree density and fuel 
accumulation (Sisk et al. 2005, Noss et al. 2006b).  A key assumption in designing 
landscape-scale treatments is that by strategically locating burning, thinning, and other 
silvicultural treatments, fuel continuity can be disrupted, allowing managed wildfires to 
burn the balance of the area (Finney 2001, Agee and Skinner 2005).  A necessary step 
in designing and evaluating these treatments is understanding the ecological effects of 
silvicultural and fire management treatments on wildlife.  
Wildlife responses to forest treatments vary widely; generally, it is assumed that 
treatments which restore conditions consistent with those they have experienced over 
evolutionary time will have more beneficial effects than treatments that create novel 
conditions (Soule 1985, Noss and Csuti 1994, Lindenmayer and Franklin 2002).  High 
severity disturbances such as clearcutting and wildfire (Anthony and Isaacs 1989, 
Grialou et al. 2000, Cunningham et al. 2002) and unnaturally dense or open conditions 
(Brown and Davis 1998, Shick et al. 2006) can have negative impacts on animal 
species, particularly in the short term, because of habitat alteration.  Thinning and 
burning treatments are an effort to return forest structure and composition to within the 
range of natural variability, which should benefit native wildlife species (Allen et al. 
2002). 
Southwestern conifer forests of the United States are an ideal system for 
examining the effects of forest treatments on wildlife, due to historical and current 
approaches to management.  Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and mixed conifer 
(Abies lasiocarpa, P. flexilis, P. ponderosa, Populus tremuloides, Pseudotsuga 
menziesii) forests cover >3 million hectares in the southwestern United States (US 

14 
 
Department of Agriculture Forest Service 2009).  Due to historical logging and 
silvicultural practices, fire suppression, and grazing, most frequent fire forests in the 
Southwest are now characterized by excessive tree densities, low diversity of plant and 
wildlife species, and high susceptibility to stand-replacing crown fires (Covington et al. 
1994, Fulé et al. 1997, Cocke et al. 2005).  There is now an emphasis on restoring 
forests to past conditions using thinning and prescribed fire (Healthy Forests 
Restoration Act, 2003).  These treatments may have negative, short-term effects on 
wildlife species that do not tolerate disturbance well, or that depend on these structures 
for nesting or foraging (Bock and Bock 1983, Chambers and Germaine 2003, Converse 
et al. 2006a).  However, in the long term treatments should create forest structures with 
reduced tree densities and an open, patchy structure of mostly mature trees with 
herbaceous ground cover maintained by a frequent fire regime (Waltz et al. 2003, 
Moore et al. 2006).  The increase in spatial and temporal heterogeneity should diversify 
habitat available for wildlife, and, in turn, restore a native, diverse assemblage of animal 
species (Allen et al. 2002, Noss et al. 2006a).   
No consensus exists regarding wildlife responses to forest management in the 
Southwest.  Studies of wildlife responses to thinning and burning treatments vary 
widely in species studied, response variable (e.g., density, abundance) measured, 
treatment (e.g., thinning, burning) examined, and temporal and spatial extent of the 
study design.  Existing reviews include summaries of impacts of thinning and burning 
treatments on birds (Block and Finch 1997, Sallabanks et al. 2000, Bock and Block 
2005a, b) and qualitative reviews that described effects of thinning and fire on multiple 
wildlife species (Lyon et al. 2000, Chambers and Germaine 2003, Pilliod and Bull 

15 
 
2006).  A recent meta-analysis examined the impacts of forest treatments on small 
mammals in North American forests, but focused on clearcutting as a management tool 
(Zwolak 2009).  No review quantitatively examined effects of forest treatments on 
multiple wildlife species.   
To design landscape-scale restoration treatments, managers need to understand 
what is known about wildlife impacts of treatments that might be used:  thinning, 
prescribed burns, wildfire, and clearcut fuel breaks.  The purpose of this study was to 
synthesize and analyze studies of treatment impacts on wildlife in ponderosa pine and 
mixed conifer forests in the southwestern United States.  We used a both qualitative and 
quantitative (meta-analysis) techniques.  Meta-analysis is an analytical technique used 
to quantitatively summarize the results of multiple studies by calculating an effect size 
which compares a response variable between a treatment and control for each study, and 
then calculates a mean effect size across studies (Hedges and Olkin 1985, Gurevitch and 
Hedges 1993).  We used meta-analysis to assess treatment impacts for  vertebrate 
wildlife species whose density or reproductive output were compared in treated vs 
untreated forest sites in southwestern forests.  Our objectives were to (1) determine 
which treatments had the greatest effect on wildlife, hypothesizing that thinning and 
burning treatments, if not eliciting a positive response from wildlife, may have less of a 
negative impact than clearcutting, selective harvesting, or high severity wildfire, 
particularly in the short term; (2) determine which species were most and least sensitive 
to habitat manipulation; and (3) identify species or groups of species for which there 
was a paucity of field experimentation and data.  This analysis serves as a starting point 
for researchers and resource managers in designing testable hypotheses about impacts 

16 
 
of thinning and burning treatments on wildlife, and determining future monitoring and 
research needs. 
Methods 
Data selection and extraction 
We searched the following databases between September and December 2008: 
Academic Search Premier, Biological Sciences, BioOne, Environmental Science and 
Pollution Management, Plant Science, Springer Link, Wiley Interscience, Zoological 
Record, JSTOR, Forest Science Database, Dissertation and Theses Full Text.  We used 
all combinations of the terms: wildlife, birds, reptiles, amphibians, mammals AND 
western forest, ponderosa pine AND restoration, thinning, logging, clearcut, prescribed 
burn, treatment, fuels reduction, fire.  Peer-reviewed papers, conference proceedings, 
government documents, and theses were considered during our search.  We also 
searched online government and institutional libraries including U.S. Forest Service 
TreeSearch (treesearch.fs.fed.us), Ecological Restoration Institute library at Northern 
Arizona University (library.eri.nau.edu), and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service website 
(library.fws.gov).  We spoke to wildlife biologists, public agency personnel, 
academicians, and authors to obtain additional sources and unpublished studies.  
We selected studies that met these 4 criteria: 
1. Vertebrate species were compared in terms of either of two response 
variables: (a) density or (b) reproductive output, as defined by number of 
successful nests, number of offspring, and/or survival rates of offspring; 

17 
 
2. Treatment was forest harvesting, including thinning, shelterwood, selective 
harvesting, and clearcutting, and/or burning, including prescribed fire and 
wildfire; 
3. Study design was control-impact (CI) or before-after control-impact (BACI) 
with a control for comparison (i.e., an unmanaged stand); 
4. Study was conducted in the southwestern United States (Arizona or New 
Mexico) in ponderosa pine or mixed conifer forest. 
With the final set of studies, we built a database to record the relevant 
information.  In addition to recording species and their density and reproductive output 
information, we noted site characteristics that could affect the response, and included 
these variables as covariates (treatment, time since treatment, and forest type including 
mixed conifer or ponderosa pine).  As treatments were not always defined in 
silvicultural terms, for the purposes of this analysis we broadly categorized studies into 
6 treatments: 
1. “Small-diameter removal,” where small-to-intermediate diameter trees were 
removed, including both thinning and shelterwood treatments; 
2. “Burning,” or low-to-moderate severity burns which were generally 
prescribed fires with fire-charring roughly 0-1.5 meters above the ground 
and only a few trees are killed in the understory;  
3. “Thin/burn,” where a thinning was conducted followed by a low-to-
moderate severity prescribed burn; 
4. “Selective harvest,” where trees, typically of large-diameter, were 
selectively removed; 

18 
 
5. “Overstory removal,” which represents the most intensive treatments, 
including clearcuts, where >80% of the basal area was removed; and 
6. “Wildfire,” defined as high severity burns or stand-replacing wildfire where 
fire charring is greater than 1.5 m above the ground, almost all the 
understory is killed, and some to all large trees are killed. 
Data were separated by year and site whenever possible.  We noted 
methodological variables that we hypothesized could affect the outcome of the study, 
including study design (BACI or C-I), area sampled, density estimation method 
(relative density or true density incorporating detection probability), replication, quality 
of study (peer reviewed or not), and study (identifying the origin of the data).  We were 
unable to account for the season of sampling as a covariate because some studies 
reported only one density estimate based on a full year of sampling; thus, data from all 
seasons are pooled. 
Meta-analysis 
The most commonly used effect sizes in meta-analyses (i.e., Hedges’ d, Cohen’s 
d) are calculated based on  sample size and variance, assuming that studies with large 
sample sizes and smaller variances are more reliable (Hedges and Olkin 1985, 
Rosenberg et al. 2000).  However many wildlife studies are not replicated so there is no 
variance across replicates, nor do many studies report a variance.  Often the number of 
replicates is not an adequate measure of sampling effort because it does not take into 
account the size of the site.  Thus, we used a response ratio as our effect size 
calculation, defined as ln(treatment mean/control mean) (Hedges et al. 1999).  This 
metric has become more commonly used in meta-analysis (Mosquera et al. 2000, Côté 

19 
 
et al. 2001) as it is designed to measure relative differences (often appropriate in 
ecological studies) and behaves better statistically (Hedges et al. 1999).  Since a 
response ratio cannot be calculated when a treatment or control mean is equal to zero, 
we performed trials where we added 1, 0.1, 0.001, 0.0001, and 0.00001 to each 
treatment and control mean before calculating the response ratio (Molloy et al. 2008).  
We determined that using 0.001 had the smallest impact on the overall (average) effect 
size. 
Effect sizes are usually weighted by the inverse of the sample variance, in order 
to account for variation between studies in sampling effort.  With the wildlife studies 
we examined, the standard deviation between replicate means is often not (1) reported, 
(2) available because sample size is one, or (3) meaningful because the size of a 
replicate varies dramatically from study to study.  We used a biologically meaningful 
weighting scheme where each effect size was weighted by the area sampled (number of 
plots x plot size) (Mosquera et al. 2000).  We also conducted unweighted analyses, as 
these types of analyses did not differ from traditional weighted analyses (Gardner et al. 
2003), produced a more accurate estimate of overall effect size, and reduced Type 1 
error (Lajeunesse and Forbes 2003, Marczak et al. 2007). 
We built generalized linear models to examine relationships between effect sizes 
and covariates.  We chose 8 models a priori, hypothesizing that either ecological or 
methodological variables, in addition to study, would explain effect size in response to 
treatment (Table 2-1).  We based these hypotheses on our review of the literature and 
experience with southwestern forest wildlife studies.  We compared models using 
Akaike’s Information Criterion adjusted for small sample sizes (AICc) to assess the 

20 
 
overall strength of each model (Burnham and Anderson 2002).  We ranked the models 
from highest to lowest according to their ΔAICc values, and chose those models with 
ΔAICc <2 as the final set to be used for inference (Burnham and Anderson 2002).  We 
calculated the Akaike weight (wi) for each candidate model as a measure of model 
support and selection uncertainty.  We performed the model selection analysis 
separately for weighted (using the total area sampled) and unweighted generalized 
linear models, and did not detect a difference in the results. 
We examined each of the important covariates in the models, as identified by 
model selection, using Metawin software (v.2, Rosenberg et al. 2000).  For categorical 
variables with ≥2 observations, we calculated a mean effect size (MES) with confidence 
intervals generated by bootstrapping (Adams et al. 1997), corrected for bias for unequal 
distribution around the mean.  Effect sizes were considered to be different from zero 
when the confidence interval did not include zero.  An effect size of zero, positive, or 
negative indicated no change between treatment and control, an increase in the response 
variable compared to the control, or a decrease in the response variable, respectively 
(Rosenberg et al. 2000).  For continuous variables, we regressed effect size against the 
variable and reported the associated slope which indicates the direction and magnitude 
of the relationship.  We compared unweighted and weighted analyses, found they 
produced similar results, thus we report only unweighted results.   
Publication bias and non-independence of data 
Publication bias in meta-analysis occurs because studies with significant results 
are more likely to be published than those without significant results (Arnqvist and 
Wooster 1995).  We minimized bias by limiting the geographic extent of our study area 

21 
 
to the Southwest which allowed us to be very complete in our data collection.  Most of 
the studies we used examined multiple (≥3) species that showed a range of responses, 
and thus species with no response to treatment are reported.   
We controlled for the problem of lack of independence in data (i.e., multiple 
effect sizes can be calculated from the same study using the same control for multiple 
treatments; a study of 5 bird species in 3 types of treatments over 2 years would 
generate 30 effect sizes) by including a covariate to identify the origin of the data 
(“study”), which was an indicator variable to identify each study uniquely.  This 
approach allowed us to analyze the relative importance of “study” compared to the 
other covariates in our model selection approach. 
Results  
Overall results 
Of 6,908 papers found during our key word literature search, we identified 33 
studies that met our criteria.  Only 25 studies were usable in our meta-analysis which 
uses density as the response variable (Appendix 2-A).  We then eliminated all species 
with <5 observations across all studies in order to increase our overall sample size 
relative to the number of species (n = 1095 observations, 22 studies).  Because there 
were only 8 studies that used reproductive output as a response variable which is 
insufficient for meta-analysis, we considered these data qualitatively.  The wildlife 
species we examined were limited by the data we obtained; not all species or taxa were 
equally or well represented (e.g., birds were more studied than other taxa), and most 

22 
 
studies were of a limited temporal and spatial scale (≤20 years post-treatment on sites 
<400ha).  
The models (ΔAICc < 2) that best predicted wildlife response to treatments 
included treatment, species, time since treatment, and study (Table 2-1). Other models 
performed poorly in comparison (ΔAICc ≥ 3.11) and included the variables forest type, 
study design, method of density estimation, replication and peer-review status 
(Table 2-1).   
Treatment 
The mean effect size differed among treatment types; small-diameter removal 
and burning treatments had positive effects on densities but the thin/burn and selective 
harvest treatments did not differ from zero (Figure 2-1a).  Species responded negatively 
to overstory removal and wildfire (Figure 2-1a).  We included all species to show the 
results based on the information currently available (species listed in Table 2-2) and 
also calculated mean effect sizes for 11 species for which there were data for every 
treatment (species listed in Table 2-2).  The responses to treatments were similar to 
those for all species combined; however, species responded more positively to selective 
harvest and less positively to burning, relative to the other treatments (Figure 2-1b). 
 Species 
Species varied in their response to the treatments relative to the controls (Table 
2-2), with some species showing strong responses (MES >5 or <-5 and confidence 
interval does not overlap 0).  Two species (house wren (Troglodytes aedon)) and red-
faced warbler (Cardellina rubrifrons)) showed strong negative responses to the small-

23 
 
diameter removal treatments compared to the controls, and 1 species (American robin 
(Turdus migratorius)) had a strong positive response.  Two species (western wood-
pewee (Contopus sordidulus)) and spotted towhee (Pipilo maculates)) demonstrated 
strong positive responses to the burning treatments relative to the controls (Table 2-2).  
Two species exhibited strong negative responses (hermit thrush (Catharus guttatus)) 
and red-faced warbler) and 3 strong positive responses (American robin, western wood-
pewee, and rock wren (Salpinctes obsoletus)) in the selective harvest compared to the 
controls.  In contrast, there were 10 species that responded strongly negatively and 3 
that responded strongly positively to the overstory removal, and 12 that responded 
strongly negatively and 8 that responded strongly positively to the wildfire.  Mean 
effect sizes for species calculated across the small-diameter removal, burning, and 
thin/burn treatments indicated an overall positive response to treatment (MES = 0.5; CI 
= 0.3 to 0.8).  The overall response of species to overstory removal and wildfire was 
negative (MES = -2.6; CI = -3.1 to -2.0). 
Species were grouped into foraging guilds in order to summarize differences 
between species in response to treatment (Figure 2-2).  Ground-foraging birds and 
rodents had consistently neutral density responses to the treatments, whereas aerial-, 
tree-, and bole-foraging birds had positive or neutral responses to the small-diameter 
removal and burning treatments, but negative responses to overstory removal and 
wildfire.  Of the four treatments, woodpeckers and hummingbirds only exhibited a 
negative density response to overstory removal.  Data were limited for raptors (with 
only 5 observations for American kestrels (Falco sparverius)) which responded 

24 
 
positively to wildfire, and tree squirrels, which responded neutrally to small-diameter 
removal. 
Time since treatment 
Time since treatment across all studies ranged from 1-20 years.  Time since 
treatment had an overall negative effect on species density responses (slope = -0.4); 
however, this response was driven largely by the overstory removal (slope = -1.0), since 
burning had a positive response (slope = 0.03) and the other four treatments negative 
(slope: wildfire = -0.1, selective harvest = -0.2, small-diameter removal = -0.1, 
thin/burn = -0.1).  For guilds with ≥4 years of data, the mean effect sizes across the 
small-diameter removal, burning, and thin/burn treatments by year demonstrated that 
some animals responded positively over time (ground-foraging birds, woodpeckers), but 
others negatively (tree- and bole-foraging birds; Figure 2-3).  The longest data set that 
existed was for the tassel-eared squirrel (Sciurus aberti), which responded increasingly 
positively over time (Figure 2-3). 
Study 
The presence of study as a variable in our top model (Table 2-1) indicated a lack 
of independence between observations from the same study.  We interpreted this as a 
site effect, as most observations from the same study also used the same study site. 
Reproductive output 
Only 8 studies examined reproductive output of animal species in treated versus 
control sites.  Six studies focused on bird responses to treatment (1 on wild turkeys 
(Meleagris gallopavo), 1 on Mexican spotted owls (Strix occidentalis lucida), 4 on 

25 
 
western bluebirds (Sialia mexicana)) and 2 studies examined mammal responses (tassel-
eared squirrel, black bear (Ursus americanus)). 
Wakeling et al. (1998) found that successful wild turkey nests, defined by the 
hatching of at least one egg, were associated with greater overstory conifer density and 
time periods longer than 20 years since selective harvest.  Battin (2003) found an 
increase in fledging success for plumbeous vireos (Vireo plumbeus) and western 
tanagers (Piranga ludoviciana) within 4 years of treatment in thin/burn versus untreated 
areas.  Germaine and Germaine (2002) found thinning and burning treatments had little 
effect on the number of eggs or nestlings per nest of western bluebirds within 5 years of 
treatment, but were associated with a higher number of fledglings per nest and greater 
probability of fledging at least one young compared to controls. They also found a 
higher incidence of parasitic infestations by blowflies in nests in thin/burn treatments 
compared to controls (Germaine and Germaine 2002).  Wightman and Germaine (2006) 
found that successful western bluebird nests, determined by number of young in the nest 
on the last day prior to fledge, were associated with increased understory and bare 
ground and lower conifer tree densities found in thinned and burned treatments within 
≤7 years post-treatment.  Hurteau et al. (in press) show that although nest density for 
western bluebirds was significantly higher in thinned, burned, and thin/burn treatments 
versus controls, the number of eggs or nestlings was not significantly different 2-3 years 
post-treatment.  Jenness et al. (2004) found that occupancy and reproduction of 
Mexican spotted owls, based on sighting of young outside the nest, was higher in 
unburned versus burned treatments within 4 years of treatment, but the relationship was 
weak and possibly confounded by the large range in burn severity in the burned sites.   

26 
 
Dodd et al. (2006) found that density, adult survival, and juvenile recruitment, in 
terms of juveniles/ha, of tassel-eared squirrels was lower in shelterwood treatments 
versus controls approximately 10 years after treatment.  In a four-year study beginning 
one year after a high-severity wildfire, Cunningham and Ballard (2003) demonstrated 
that bear densities remained the same before and after fire, and in the burned area versus 
control; however, the sex ratio in the burned area was skewed towards males compared 
to the same area prior to fire or the control.  Cunningham and Ballard (2003) also found 
that although 16 cubs were produced in the burn area and 13 in the control, no cubs 
survived in the burned area versus 36% in the control.   
Discussion 
The small-diameter removal, burning, and thin/burn treatments had broadly 
similar effects in terms of small mammal and passerine bird response in the short term 
(≤10 years).  At the guild level, aerial-foraging birds benefit from the small-diameter 
removal and burning treatments, but have negative responses to overstory removal and 
wildfire, perhaps due to loss of habitat components or the increased risk of predation by 
animals that forage in the open.  Tree-foliage and bole-foraging birds responded 
neutrally or positively to the small-diameter removal and burning treatments, but 
negatively to overstory removal and wildfire, as expected from animals that require 
trees for foraging.  Similar to Zwolak (2009), we found that most ground-dwelling 
rodents responded positively to small-diameter removal and thin/burn treatments, and 
that deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) densities increased in both treatments and in 
response to wildfire.   

27 
 
However, although wildfire and overstory removal results in similar, negative 
impacts on overall species densities, these treatments are not equivalent in their effects.  
American kestrels (the only raptor represented in our meta-analysis) responded 
positively to the wildfire treatment, possibly because of their increased ability to spot 
and catch prey in open sites, or the increase in snags available for nesting (Village 
1990).  This result would not necessarily hold true for other raptors.  Woodpeckers 
declined in overstory removals, but did not appear to respond to wildfires; we would 
have expected a positive response due to their well-documented relationship with fire 
and increased insect foraging opportunities on snags and residual trees (Farris and Zack 
2005, Covert-Bratland et al. 2006).  Ground/shrub-foraging birds were the only guild 
that responded positively to overstory removal, suggesting that this treatment was 
effective in maintaining or enhancing understory and shrub cover (Ffolliott and 
Gottfried 1989, Yorks et al. 2000).  Overstory removal and wildfire have different 
impacts.  With overstory removal, higher levels of biomass are removed, leaving stands 
with a more uniform structure; wildfire leaves more standing biomass and patches of 
unburned forest and snags (Spies and Turner 1999).  Olive-sided flycatchers (Contopus 
cooperi) responded positively to wildfire but not overstory removal, which could be 
because these birds forage in open areas with dead trees, but nest high in conifer trees, 
and thus benefit from a patchy forest structure (McGarigal and McComb 1995).     
Similarly, no one treatment benefits all species, at least over the short term.  
Even within the small-diameter removal treatment, which had the greatest overall 
positive effect of the six treatments on species densities, house wrens and red-faced 
warblers responded negatively relative to the controls.  This could be due to their need 

28 
 
for understory vegetation for foraging (house wrens) and nesting (red-faced warblers) 
(Wheye et al. 1988).  Similarly, the negative response of the Mexican woodrat 
(Neotoma mexicana) to thin/burn treatment is likely caused by a  lack of coarse woody 
debris and downed logs, essential for nest-building and cover (Converse et al. 2006a, 
Coppeto et al. 2006).  Thus, at least in the near term, a combination of various 
treatments in a patchy arrangement in time and space across the landscape is likely to 
result in the highest diversity compared to any one treatment (Noss et al. 2006a). 
Species responses to time since small-diameter removal or burning treatment 
were difficult to interpret due to the lack of data beyond 4 years for all species except 
the tassel-eared squirrel.  Ground/shrub-foraging birds demonstrated a positive response 
to small-diameter removal and burning treatments over the first 4 years post-treatment, 
which may indicate that the understory and shrub layer is increasing in biomass and 
diversity during this time (Ffolliott and Gottfried 1989, Yorks et al. 2000).  
Woodpeckers show a positive response, which is likely due to increased snag decay and 
insect activity in the years immediately following a thinning or fire (Chambers and 
Mast 2005, Covert-Bratland et al. 2007).  The decreased density of tree- and bole-
foraging species suggests that these species emigrate from these areas since the larger 
trees do not reestablish in this short time frame.  The increased density of the tassel-
eared squirrel over a 10-year time period, however, may be due to increased growth and 
vigor of large pine trees (Fajardo et al. 2007) on which they depend (Patton and Green 
1970). 
The meta-analysis approach worked well in summarizing the density response of 
multiple species across different treatments over time at a coarse scale.  However, a 

29 
 
drawback of the approach is that we were unable to quantify fine-scale effects on 
wildlife.  The model selection analysis shows that there are similarities between density 
responses measured in the same study and using the same site; thus, there must be other 
important within-site variables that we did not use as covariates in our analysis.  Some 
may include characteristics of the control stands, post-treatment tree density or basal 
area, treatment intensity, seasonality of treatments, overstory composition, number of 
snags, and understory characteristics, as these variables were not consistently reported 
in the literature.  For example, our inability to include number of snags as a covariate 
may be why we did not detect a positive response by woodpeckers to the burning and 
wildfire treatments.  The juxtaposition of treatments on the landscape can also be very 
important to animals associated with multiple habitat types or edges (Ries and Sisk 
2004), such as olive-sided flycatchers (McGarigal and McComb 1995) and spotted 
towhees (Battin and Sisk 2003), which was not assessed in this analysis. 
Meta-analysis was also restrictive in the types of response variables that could 
be analyzed.  Only animal density could be compared in treatments versus controls 
across different taxa, which eliminated studies that examined other responses such as 
home range size, diet, or habitat use.  Since fitness is often viewed as the best indicator 
of population performance (Bock and Jones 2004), we compared density and 
reproductive output results and found that both were consistent in treatments versus 
controls (either both positive or both negative) for the plumbeous vireo and western 
tanager (Battin and Sisk 2003), western bluebird (Germaine and Germaine 2002, 
Wightman and Germaine 2006, Hurteau et al. in press), and tassel-eared squirrel (Dodd 
et al. 2006).  However, black bear had similar densities pre- and post-fire, and in burned 

30 
 
areas versus control, but lower reproductive output in the burned areas (Cunningham et 
al. 2003).  It is well-documented in the literature that density is often a misleading 
indication of habitat quality (Van Horne 1983), for example when the habitat assessed is 
a seasonal habitat that does not accurately reflect the animal’s fitness, as with animals 
that are more limited by their winter habitat then their summer habitat.  Another 
problem is that territorial behavior often results in the best habitat being claimed by a 
few, dominant individuals, while the secondary habitat has a higher density of 
subordinate individuals (Fretwell and Lucas 1970).  Thus, assessing wildlife density 
may not always be meaningful in terms of understanding changes in habitat, yet most 
studies in our review used this response variable presumably because reproductive 
output is more difficult, time consuming, and costly to measure.   
A final problem is the lack of data for uncommon species.  Due to the multi-
species approach taken by most bird and small mammal studies, the same common 
species tend to be measured.  Only a few species-specific studies were available (Patton 
et al. 1985, Cunningham et al. 2003, Dodd et al. 2006, Conway and Kirkpatrick 2007).  
Thus, these rare species tend to be underrepresented in the meta-analysis.   
One outcome of meta-analysis is that it allows us to assess the current state of 
knowledge on a subject and recommend areas for future research.  The vast majority of 
studies in the analysis were short-term responses of birds to treatment (15 of 22).  In 
particular, recent studies (Berk 2007, Kotliar et al. 2007, Hurteau et al. 2008, Dickson et 
al. 2009, Pope et al. 2009) thoroughly assess 1-4 year bird responses to prescribed fire 
and thinning using sophisticated modeling techniques, and we suggest that these studies 
be carefully consulted before initiating similar research in order to eliminate duplication 

31 
 
of effort.  There are 7 studies on small mammals but all are short term (<3 years, except 
for the tassel-eared squirrel) and use small sites (<50 ha).  Other underrepresented taxa 
include reptiles and amphibians, as well as rare birds and small mammals that are not 
easily assessed using conventional point count and trapping methodologies; for 
example, shrews (Sorex) or wild turkeys.  Other species under- or un-represented in this 
meta-analysis include medium and large mammals, including both predators and 
ungulates, and birds of prey.  However, these species are not entirely ignored in the 
literature, but rather density is generally not an appropriate response variable for 
animals with large home ranges.  However, the lack of studies that assess reproductive 
responses of these species indicates a paucity of research on these large and top trophic 
animals.   
Although small mammal and passerine bird species responded positively to 
small-diameter removal and burning treatments relative to the wildfire and overstory 
removal, they demonstrated relatively neutral responses relative to the controls, which 
were unmanaged stands.  We expected stronger positive responses, but this could be 
due to our inability to analyze differences in initial (control) treatments or treatment 
intensity, which could affect the magnitude of species’ responses.  The lack of 
difference between treatments and controls may also reflect the short-term nature of the 
dataset, as it may take many years to see the positive effects of the altered habitat 
(Chambers and Germaine 2003).  For example, after thinning, deer mice would tend to 
use this disturbed site in the short term due to the increased foraging opportunities 
(Bock and Bock 1983), but ultimately golden-mantled ground squirrels (Spermophilus 
lateralis) are probably better suited to the herbaceous habitats that would eventually 

32 
 
reestablish (McKeever 1964).  Thus, long-term studies are needed to provide a complete 
picture of species response to treatments and habitat conversion. 
Conclusion 
This meta-analysis suggests that thinning and prescribed burning of 
southwestern ponderosa pine and dry mixed conifer forests will benefit passerine birds 
and small mammals.  Based on the existing literature, small-diameter removal and/or 
burning does not negatively affect species’ densities compared to unmanaged forest 
stands, and is less detrimental than overstory removal or wildfire.  These results support 
the hypothesis that thinning and burning at the landscape level are consistent with 
ecological restoration objectives for wildlife.  However, wildfire and clearcut fuel 
breaks should be used with caution.  In addition, we identified several research needs, 
the results of which could change these conclusions.  We assessed thousands of papers 
on this topic and found only 25 that produced sufficient information for meta-analysis, 
revealing a need for greater research coordination.  Studies at larger temporal and 
spatial scales, which examine more informative response variables pertaining to animal 
fitness for a greater variety of species, are critical to fully understanding the impacts of 
forest treatments on wildlife.

1 Different years were considered individual observations, except when the author combined results over multiple years; in these cases, we used the mean 
number of years as our time variable. 
2 Area sampled is per species per year per study type.  If there were different sites/treatments analyzed separately, that is noted in parenthesis. 
3 Omitted from meta-analysis because there were < 5 total observations per species.

CHAPTER 3 
THINNING AND SLASH TREATMENTS INCREASE OCCUPANCY  
OF THE SMALL MAMMAL COMMUNITY IN PONDEROSA PINE FORESTS, 
NORTHERN ARIZONA 
Abstract 
In the southwestern United States, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests 
have been decreasing in biological diversity for the past century.  Today’s forests are 
characterized by dense, stands of small-diameter trees that are susceptible to stand-
replacing crown fires.  There is now an emphasis on ecological restoration in the 
Southwest, whereby forests are thinned to reduce fuel content and crown fire risk, after 
which the natural fire regime is reintroduced.  Small mammals are important in forest 
ecosystems in serving as prey for multiple predators, recycling nutrients, dispersing 
fungal spores and seeds, and aerating soils.  However, no comprehensive analysis of the 
small mammal community in response to restoration treatments at large spatial (>16 
sites) scales has been conducted in ponderosa pine forests.  During 2006-2009, we 
trapped eight species of small mammals at 294 sites in northern Arizona, and used 
occupancy modeling to determine wildlife responses to thinning treatments and habitat 
features.  The most important habitat variables in predicting small mammal community 
occupancy were pine basal area, treatment intensity (percent of trees removed and time 
since treatment), the number and length of time slash piles are left on the ground, rock 
cover, and snags >40cm diameter.  Five species (Microtus mogollonensis, Peromyscus 
maniculatus, Spermophilus lateralis, Spermophilus variegates, Tamias cinereicollis) 
responded positively to treatment and 3 (Neotoma mexicana, Sciurus aberti, Thomomys 

69 
 
bottae) negatively; the average occupancy of all species combined was positively 
related to treatment.  All but 2 species (P. maniculatus, Thomomys bottae) responded 
positively to slash piles, and average occupancy of all species was positively related to 
slash.  For all habitat attributes, we found tradeoffs in the response of each species 
which illustrated that no one treatment benefitted all species, but rather an arrangement 
of dense and open stands across the landscape with heterogeneity in fine-scale features 
is likely the best management approach for small mammals.  Compared to studies with 
similar objectives, the occupancy modeling approach was effective in detecting 
treatment effects while accounting for year effects; this design can be used in other 
studies that grapple with high variability and large spatial and temporal scales.

Introduction 
In the southwestern United States, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests 
have been decreasing in biological diversity for the past century.  Due to fire 
suppression, logging, and grazing, these forests have undergone a dramatic departure 
from conditions that existed prior to Euro-American settlement (Covington and Moore 
1994b, Swetnam et al. 1999).   Today’s southwestern ponderosa pine forests are 
characterized by homogenous, dense, small-diameter stands and heavy litter and fuel 
accumulation that are susceptible to stand-replacing crown fires (Fulé et al. 1997).  
These forests not only pose a fire threat to humans, but the ecosystems appear to be in 

70 
 
general decline (Covington 2000).  Changes in biotic and abiotic features include 
reductions in tree growth (Feeney et al. 1998), rates of decomposition and nutrient 
cycling (Selmants et al. 2003), water availability and ground water recharge (Baker 
2003), and biological diversity (Chambers and Germaine 2003); and  increased disease 
and insect infestation (Kolb et al. 1998).  Wildlife populations have been affected as 
well; Brown and Davis (1998) determined that 34 grassland species have experienced 
extirpation or reduction of their ranges in the Southwest since 1890, perhaps due to the 
reduction of open forest stand structure.  Thus, there is now an emphasis on ecological 
restoration in the Southwest, whereby forests are thinned to reduce fuels and crown fire 
risk, after which the natural fire regime is reintroduced.  Prescribed fire use in 
ecological restoration is designed to mimic the natural fire regime that used to occur on 
a 2-25 cycle at low intensity, which would maintain forests by removing the understory 
and small diameter trees (Covington 2003).  In the long term, restoration treatments 
should create forest structures with an open, patchy structure of mostly mature trees 
with herbaceous ground cover (Waltz et al. 2003).   
A landscape maintained by frequent fire constituted the southwestern ponderosa 
pine forest’s evolutionary environment, defined as the range of conditions that have 
exerted selection pressure on animals which they now depend on for their survival 
(Noss and Csuti 1994).  Today’s thinning and burning treatments are designed to 
increase spatial and temporal heterogeneity of habitat, and, in turn, will likely restore a 
native, diverse assemblage of animal species (Allen et al. 2002, Noss et al. 2006).  
However, given the multiple impacts humans have had on the landscape over the past 
100 years, including grazing, altered fire regimes, and climate change (Fry and 

71 
 
Stephens 2006, Westerling et al. 2006, Bakker and Moore 2007), it is unclear whether 
thinning and burning treatments will restore all aspects of ecosystem health.  
Additionally, habitat components such as Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii), large-
diameter trees, snags, and down wood are thought to be important to wildlife, but there 
is debate about treatment targets on the landscape (Abella et al. 2006, Noss et al. 2006).  
Given this uncertainty, managers and stakeholders want information on the impacts of 
treatments on multiple ecosystem components, including wildlife (Sisk et al. 2006).   
Of particular concern is wildlife in the wildland-urban interface, the area where 
human developments lie adjacent to natural areas, which tend to be the source of social 
tension due to the conflicting priorities of land preservation and resource use (Marzluff 
and Bradley 2003).  These areas are also often prioritized for treatment in order to 
reduce fire risk close to cities and towns.  Although the interface may experience an 
increase in species diversity via supplemental feeding and reduced predation due to 
human activities, it is likely to lose ground-nesting and forest-interior species because 
of increased edge effects and disturbance; thus, interface communities tend to be 
dominated by generalists (Marzluff and Bradley 2003).  Evaluating wildlife 
communities in these areas may be of particular importance because settlement of 
southwestern ponderosa pine forests has increased over the last half century (Block and 
Finch 1997). 
A recent meta-analysis summarizing wildlife responses to thinning and burning 
treatments in southwestern conifer forests found that these treatments had overall 
positive effects on small mammal and passerine bird densities, with the literature 
dominated by avian and single-species studies (Kalies et al. 2010).  In addition, most of 

72 
 
these studies were limited in temporal and spatial scale, which further hindered the 
development of consistent conclusions.  Only a handful of studies examined small 
mammal community response to forest management practices in the Southwest 
(Converse et al. 2006a, Converse et al. 2006b, Wampler et al. 2008, Bagne and Finch 
2009).  The most heavily-studied small mammal in southwestern ponderosa pine forests 
is the tassel-eared squirrel (Sciurus aberti), which is a Management Indicator Species 
for many national forests and may experience negative effects due to restoration 
treatments because of their dependence on high basal area and continuous canopy cover 
(Patton et al. 1985, Dodd et al. 2006, Prather et al. 2006).  However, no comprehensive 
analysis of the small mammal community has been conducted in ponderosa pine forests 
at large spatial (>16 sites) scales. 
Small mammals commonly present in ponderosa pine forests of the Southwest 
include voles (Microtus spp.), woodrats (Neotoma spp.), ground and tree squirrels 
(Spermophilus and Sciurus spp.), mice (Peromyscus spp.), chipmunks (Tamias spp.), 
and gophers (Thomomys spp.).  Small mammals are important in forest ecosystems in 
recycling nutrients by processing vegetation, dispersing fungal spores and seeds, and 
aerating and turning soils while digging (Cork and Kenagy 1989, Boal and Mannan 
1994).  Small mammals also provide a substantial part of the prey base for predators 
including the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis; a US Fish and Wildlife Service 
species of concern), Mexican spotted owl (Strix occidentalis lucida; federally 
threatened), and other avian and mammalian predators (Boal and Mannan 1994, Block 
et al. 2005).  Research suggests that tassel-eared squirrels may respond negatively to 
restoration treatments and the reduction in ponderosa pine trees (Patton et al. 1985, 

73 
 
Dodd et al. 2003, Dodd et al. 2006), but species such as the Mogollon vole (Microtus 
mogollonensis) and golden-mantled ground squirrel (Spermophilus lateralis) may 
benefit from the increased understory vegetation cover (Tevis 1956, Converse et al. 
2006a, Bagne and Finch 2009).  Thus, small mammals can be indicators of changes in 
forest structure that result from restoration treatments.    
In designing forest management treatments it is critical to consider the 
associated compositional changes of the small mammal community.  In this study, we 
used occupancy modeling; a relatively new technique that allows for a rapid assessment 
of multiple sites, yielding probabilities of occupancy rather than information on 
population dynamics such as survival, reproduction, and population size (MacKenzie et 
al. 2006).  This technique may be more appropriate for assessing wildlife at large spatial 
and temporal scales compared to traditional mark-recapture methods, due to its lesser 
demands for field data.  We examined small mammal community responses to thinning 
only, as this is the treatment most commonly used in the wildland-urban interface in 
Arizona.  Our objectives were to: 1) estimate a detection probability for each small 
mammal species; 2) quantify the importance of treatment and habitat attributes on 
occupancy for each individual species and collectively; 3) make inferences from the 
relationships between key attributes and species occupancy to better inform 
management decisions, and 4) assess the efficacy of occupancy modeling by 
determining if thinning treatments and habitat attributes would affect species occupancy 
more than background interannual variation, at a comparable level of effort to other 
similar studies.  

74 
 
Methods 
Study area 
Our primary study area was located 8km southwest of Flagstaff, Arizona, in the 
ponderosa pine-dominated forests of the wildland-urban interface (Appendix 3-A).  
Historically, this 18,500-ha area experienced a variety of forest management practices, 
including high grading (early 1900s), commercial thinning (1970-1990s), and fuels 
reduction and restoration treatments (late 1990s-present), resulting in a range of stand 
structures in terms of tree basal area and density.  We established an additional 4,800-
km study area on the Kaibab National Forest north of Grand Canyon National Park, 
Arizona, to represent old-growth forest structure conditions.  Within a geographic 
information system (GIS; ArcGIS v9.3, ESRI, Redlands, California, USA), we overlaid 
a 500-m resolution lattice on both study areas to locate prospective sampling points.  
We used this distance to ensure spatial independence in sampling points (i.e., eliminate 
autocorrelation) based on the larger home range of tassel-eared squirrels (Hoffmeister 
1986).  We eliminated points that fell within private lands and non-forested patches 
>1ha, or were located >500m from a road.  From the remaining points, we randomly 
selected 110 sampling points (100 on the Coconino, 10 on the Kaibab), with 
approximately half in treated and half in untreated stands, and then located and 
permanently marked them in the field using a global positioning system. 
Data collection 
Small mammal sampling- We used each of the 110 sampling points as the center 
of a “site.”  We obtained Northern Arizona University Institutional Animal Care and 
Use Committee approval of our trapping methodology (protocol #06-005).  At each site 

75 
 
we centered a 5x5 square trap grid which consisted of 25 Sherman (model LNATDG) 
traps with 20m spacing, with a 3x3 grid overlaid with 9 Tomahawk (model 202) traps, 
one at every other grid intersection; the combination of the 2 trap types ensured we 
captured the majority of species in the small mammal community (animals that weighed 
<1000g).  Total site-scale sampling area was 14,400m2 (1.4ha).  We trapped small 
mammals at each site during the summers of 2006-2009 over a 10-week period late 
June to August.  We left both Sherman and Tomahawk traps open overnight, but closed 
the Sherman traps during the day to prevent animals from overheating.  We checked 
traps twice daily 4 days per week, which resulted in 3 nighttime and 3 daytime trapping 
sessions.  We sampled for Botta’s pocket gopher (Thomomys bottae) presence using an 
open-hole test, disturbing all gopher mounds located at the site with a shovel; we 
considered the species to be present if a mound was repaired within 24 hours 
(Smallwood and Erickson 1995).  We determined the number of surveys and relevant 
habitat and detection covariates at each site using data from our first year (2006). 
Vegetation sampling- At each site, we quantified overstory and understory 
characteristics that we hypothesized could affect occupancy (i.e., habitat covariates).  
We established an 11.3m-radius circular overstory plot (400m2) at the site center, and 
measured slope (degrees), total number of stumps, and species and diameter at breast 
height (dbh) for trees ≥1.4m.  At the site center, we also established a nested subplot of 
3.6-m radius (40m2) and assessed species, percent cover, and height class for 
herbaceous plants, shrubs, and trees <1.4m.  At each subplot and 4 additional plots 
(located on the trapping grid at each cardinal direction), we measured the relative 
percent cover of bare ground, stumps and coarse woody debris, litter, and rocks.  At the 

76 
 
site center we randomly established a 20-m transect and measured each piece of wood 
>7.5 cm in diameter (Brown et al. 1982).  At the site level we counted the number of 
slash piles, and used our yearly observations and state and federal historical records to 
determine the age of each treatment and the number of years the slash piles were intact 
before being burned, which always occurred within 4 years of thinning treatment.  All 
vegetation sampling was conducted in June of each year, prior to small mammal 
sampling activities. 
Data analysis 
Habitat and detection covariates- For each site, we calculated slope, pine and 
oak BA/ha, big trees (>40, 50, and 60cm dbh)/ha, snags (all snags and >40, 50, 60 cm 
dbh)/ha, and the proportion of trees/ha removed by any method of harvesting (Table 3-
1).  We also calculated understory plant species richness, percent of vegetation >40cm 
in height, average percent cover of each substrate, and volume of down wood at the site 
level.  We determined the number of slash piles/site, the number of years piles were left 
intact, and the time (years) since treatment.  Because spatial location (i.e., latitudinal 
and longitudinal position) can serve as a surrogate for unmeasured habitat variables 
(Rahbek and Graves 2001), we obtained the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) 
coordinates of each site in order to derive a unique site-level identifier and consider the 
role of spatial location in our estimates of occupancy.  We pooled detection histories 
from all 4 years of sampling and used “year” as an occupancy covariate. 
Covariates that we hypothesized could cause heterogeneity in detection 
probability (i.e. detection covariates) included temperature, precipitation, year, week, 
and individual survey event.  Temperature and precipitation can affect activity levels of 

77 
 
animals, making it more or less likely they will encounter a trap (Getz 1961).  Year and 
week can capture this variability plus other attributes that are difficult to measure, such 
as changing resource availability.  Survey event is important because some species will 
avoid traps after first capture, while others will continue to visit the traps for food and 
shelter (Getz 1961).  We attempted to control for weather-related covariates by timing 
the trapping session to occur after the beginning of the monsoons; however, we still 
considered maximum daily temperature, minimum daily temperature, humidity, and 
precipitation as detection covariates, and obtained these data from the Flagstaff Airport 
weather station which is within 30km of our farthest site on the Coconino, and 
Fredonia, Arizona which is within 50km of our farthest site on the Kaibab (Weather 
Underground Inc. 2009). 
We standardized all continuous habitat and detection covariates, and diagnosed 
univariate correlations and multicolinearity using a correlation matrix and variance 
inflation factors (VIF), respectively.  When we observed univariate correlations >0.60, 
or VIF >10.0 (Neter et al. 1996), we combined these covariates using a principal 
components analysis (PCA; implemented in JMP V8.0, SAS Institute Inc.). 
Occupancy modeling and multi-model inference- Simple, or “naïve,” estimates 
of occupancy can be calculated for a given site by dividing the total number of 
detections at that site by the total number of surveys; however, most species are 
detected imperfectly, so this method can result in more biased estimates than those that 
account for detection probability and habitat covariates (MacKenzie et al. 2006). We 
used the single season occupancy modeling framework of MacKenzie et al. (2006) to 
estimate both detection probability, defined as the probability of detecting the species at 

78 
 
a site if it is present, and occupancy, defined as the expected probability that a given site 
is occupied, for each small mammal species.  We conducted all analyses using Program 
PRESENCE v2.4 (Hines 2007). 
Prior to our data collection effort and analyses, we identified covariates that we 
hypothesized would predict occupancy of small mammal species, based on the literature 
and our own field experience.  In order to focus on the variables that most impacted 
overall community occupancy and to avoid overparameterizing our models (i.g., Moore 
and Swihart 2005), we reduced this list of variables by building univariate models of 
each covariate and comparing them against the null model of occupancy for each 
species.   
Using only variables that performed better than the null for at least 3 species, we 
then developed 15 candidate models of occupancy and detection.  We included null 
models (i.e., intercept-only) that predicted detection or occupancy probabilities 
assuming probabilities are constant across the sites.  For each species, we ran 
occupancy models using PRESENCE and compared models using Akaike’s 
Information Criterion adjusted for small sample sizes (AICc; (Burnham and Anderson 
2002)).  We ranked model importance from highest to lowest according to differences 
(Δ) in their AICc values, and considered models with ΔAICc values ≤2 to have 
considerable support. We also computed weights of evidence and model selection 
uncertainty using AIC weights (wi; (Burnham and Anderson 2002)).  We ranked relative 
variable importance by summing the AIC weights across all models in which a given 
variable occurred, and considered cumulative weights (w+(j)) ≥0.50 to be strong 
evidence for a species response (Barbieri and Berger 2004, Dickson et al. 2009).

Efficacy of occupancy modeling approach- To compare the level of effort and 
quality of results between our study and similar efforts, we obtained all peer-reviewed 
studies that met these criteria: 1) the objective was to assess small mammal population 
responses to forest management treatments, 2) it was conducted in southwestern US 
conifer forest, 3) the response variable was abundance, density, or a fitness parameter 
(not raw counts of captures), and 4) the sampling methodology used was live-trapping.  
We compared studies based on the response variable, number of species assessed, area 
sampled, duration of study, and total trap nights. 
Results 
Small mammal sampling 
Due to various logistical issues that occurred each year (e.g., impassable roads, 
areas closed due to fire risk, excessive heat, etc.), sampling effort varied somewhat 
among years.  We sampled 19 sites in 2006 (pilot year), 96 in 2007, 96 in 2008, and 83 
in 2009 (n = 294).  In each year, we detected the Mogollon vole, Mexican woodrat 
(Neotoma mexicana), deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), tassel-eared squirrel, 
golden-mantled ground squirrel, rock squirrel (Spermophilus variegates), gray-collared 
chipmunk (Tamias cinereicollis), and Botta’s pocket gopher.   
Habitat and detection covariates 
Our univariate analysis identified 8 out of 21 initial covariates that did not 
perform better than the null model for at least 3 species, including understory vegetation 
height and richness, slope, down wood volume, 2 size classes of large trees, and 2 size 
classes of snags (Table 3-1).  This resulted in 11 habitat covariates: pine BA (m2/ha), 

80 
 
oak BA (m2/ha), understory vegetation (% cover), rock (% cover), trees >50cm dbh/ha, 
snags/ha, snags >40cm dbh/ha, slash (high values indicate high number of slash piles 
and long duration slash piles were present), treatment (high values indicate a high 
percentage of trees/ha were removed and treatment was recently implemented), year, 
and UTMs (higher values indicate southeastern sites) (Table 3-1). 
We also assessed correlations between detection covariates and found that week, 
survey, and year were correlated with maximum and minimum temperature, humidity, 
and precipitation.  Since week, survey, and year encompass climatic conditions and 
other environmental conditions that are difficult to measure, we omitted the climatic 
variables from further analysis.   
Detection probabilities 
Detection probabilities for the 8 species of small mammals ranged from 0.3–0.9 
over 4 years (Figure 3-1), which are considered adequate for occupancy analysis 
(MacKenzie and Royle 2005).  The most parsimonious models of detection probability 
included survey, year, week, or none of the covariates (Table 3-2). 
Occupancy probabilities 
Each of the 11 habitat covariates except year appeared in at least one model with 
ΔAICc ≤2 (Table 3-2).  Covariates for which w+(j)  ≥0.50 for at least 3 species included 
pine BA, treatment, slash, rock cover, snags >40cm/ha, and UTMs (Table 3-3).   
Gray-collared chipmunks had the highest rates of occupancy and Mexican 
woodrats the lowest across all sites (Figure 3-2).  Sites with higher pine BA (m2/ha) 
elicited a positive response from only Mexican woodrats and tassel-eared squirrels 

81 
 
(Figure 3-2).  “Treatment” represents a range from old treatments (negative values) to 
recent treatments (positive values); the older treatments were selective harvesting or 
pre-commercial thinning with relatively low tree-per-hectare removal, while the new 
treatments were fuels reduction or restoration treatments with high tree-per-hectare 
removal.  Five species (Mogollon vole, deer mouse, golden-mantled ground squirrel, 
rock squirrel, gray-collared chipmunk) responded positively to treatment and three 
negatively (Mexican woodrat, tassel-eared squirrel, Botta’s pocket gopher; Table 3-3).  
The average occupancy of all species indicated a positive trend (slope = 0.01). 
“Slash” can be interpreted as a range of sites with no or low numbers of slash 
piles left onsite for a very short period of time (negative values), to sites with many 
slash piles left on the ground for up to 3 years (positive values).  All species responded 
positively to slash quantity and duration except for the deer mouse and pocket gopher 
(Table 3-3).  The average occupancy of all species indicated a positive trend (slope = 
0.02). 
Sites with higher rock cover elicited a positive response from 4 species 
(Mexican woodrat, deer mouse, rock squirrel, gray-collared chipmunk) and a negative 
response from 4 species (Mogollon vole, tassel-eared squirrel, rock squirrel, Botta’s 
pocket gopher; Table 3-3).  Snags >40cm produced a positive response from 5 species 
(Mogollon vole, Mexican woodrat, deer mouse, tassel-eared squirrel, gray-collared 
chipmunk) and a negative response from 3 species (golden-mantled ground squirrel, 
rock squirrel, Botta’s pocket gopher; Table 3-3).  UTMs indicate a site effect for 4 
species (Mexican woodrat, tassel-eared squirrel, golden-mantled ground squirrel, rock 
squirrel; Table 3-3).

Efficacy of occupancy modeling approach 
 
Of the 9 small mammal studies that have been conducted in the Southwest using 
live-trapping to assess response to forest management, our study is the only one that 
used occupancy as the response variable (Table 3-4).  Our study required the 6th greatest 
level of effort (trap nights); however, our study area was the 7th largest, and we assessed 
8 species whereas the maximum was previously 4.  We were able to sample two species 
that had not previously been assessed (rock squirrel and Botta’s pocket gopher). 
Discussion 
Response of small mammal community to forest treatments and habitat attributes 
Thinning and restoration treatments are implemented to reduce tree density so 
prescribed fire can be introduced.  Restoration treatments (i.e., treatments with high 
tree-per-hectare removal and recent implementation) resulted in increased occupancy 
for all species except tassel-eared squirrels and Mexican woodrats; Botta’s pocket 
gopher responded positively to low pine basal area but negatively to treatment.  
Southwestern ponderosa pine forests had a lower density of trees prior to Euro-
American settlement (ca. 1880) (Cooper 1960, Moore et al. 1999), and thus forest 
species were likely adapted to open stand structure as their evolutionary environment.  
It is well-documented that tassel-eared squirrel and Mexican woodrat are associated 
with higher density stands (Block et al. 2005, Dodd et al. 2006), and it is possible that 
they were found less commonly on the landscape during presettlement times.  Botta’s 
pocket gopher likely benefit from decreased pine basal area as it leads to increased 
understory vegetation for foraging (Huntly and Reichman 1994), and fewer obstacles in 

83 
 
digging their tunnel systems (Reichman et al. 1982).  These results support the 
inference that open stand structure as well as dense stands naturally occurred, and 
creating both stand types on the landscape is likely to lead to higher overall species 
diversity (Allen et al. 2002, Noss et al. 2006).  
No single habitat feature increased occupancy of all species; this is consistent 
with the natural process of low severity fire, which would burn in a patchy arrangement 
across the landscape, killing small trees but leaving large ones (Cooper 1961), leaving 
some snags and down wood while burning others (Spies and Turner 1999), leaving 
denser stands of trees particularly on north-facing slopes and steep canyons (Noss et al. 
2006), and regulating litter and understory vegetation levels.  Our sites were not treated 
with prescribed fire, but we assessed species responses to fine-scale features across the 
variety of habitat sampled.  Large trees are features of presettlement forests that have 
decreased in density due to fire suppression and logging (Cooper 1961, Covington and 
Moore 1994a).  Our results support the inference that this features was part of the 
evolutionary environment, as we found that all but one species responded positively to 
large trees (>50cm).  In comparison, trees ≥40cm (proposed as a diameter cap in the 
Southwest; Abella et al. 2006) did not have a strong effect on the community.  
Similarly, only 2 species responded positively to snags but 5 responded positively to 
snags >40cm, likely because big snags provide larger cavities for nesting and cover 
(Chambers and Mast 2005).   
Changes in oak basal area, rock percent cover, and herbaceous vegetation cover 
also resulted in tradeoffs in occupancy among species within the small mammal 
community.  Greater herbaceous vegetation cover, which was correlated with increased 

84 
 
vegetation height and species richness, benefitted most species (5 of 8), which fits with 
the theory that the community is adapted to an open forest structure with low tree 
density and a herbaceous ground cover, which provides both food and cover (Allen et 
al. 2002).  Species that responded negatively to vegetation cover included the tassel-
eared squirrel, which forages for fungi in moist litter environments generally associated 
with dense stands, and uses the tree canopies as cover (States and Gaud 1997, Dodd et 
al. 2003), and the Mexican woodrat and rock squirrel which are more strongly 
associated with rock as cover.  Six species responded positively to oaks or rock; rocky 
outcrops of oak are a unique habitat feature on the ponderosa pine landscape, providing 
cover, burrowing spaces, and food for a variety of wildlife (Rosenstock 1998).   
The overall positive response by the small mammal community to the number 
and duration of slash piles may be because the animals are using the piles as cover, 
given that thinned sites often lose down wood, understory vegetation, and snags in the 
short term (Chambers and Germaine 2003).  The piles, acting as surrogate habitat, may 
give the animals an opportunity to reestablish while the site is otherwise recovering 
from disturbance.  The exceptions are deer mouse and Botta’s pocket gopher; deer 
mouse tend to populate recently disturbed areas (Zwolak 2009) and thus may be 
outcompeted by other animals that thrive in an otherwise highly disturbed site due to the 
slash piles.  However, deer mouse occupancy probabilities remained close to 0.8 even 
with slash piles.  Botta’s pocket gopher also responded negatively to slash, likely 
because it lives underground and derives no benefits from slash, and may instead be 
negatively impacted by the ground disturbance caused by treatment.  Overall, however, 

85 
 
slash is one of the few habitat variables that can be relatively easily manipulated with 
such positive results across the community. 
For the UTM covariate, the direction of the response is not informative, however 
a strong response indicates site influence (i.e., species was found at the same site over 
multiple years).  The four largest and long-lived species (Mexican woodrat, tassel-eared 
squirrel, golden-mantled ground squirrel, rock squirrel; Hoffmeister 1986) responded 
strongly to this covariate.  These species may be more susceptible to the long-term 
effects of habitat alteration than the short-lived, more transient species. 
Management and research implications 
The goal of restoration treatments in the Southwest is not to maximize or 
increase the occupancy of species, but rather to restore the ecosystem and associated 
wildlife to the composition, structure, and function of presettlement conditions.  We are 
not advocating increasing occupancy of any or all species across the Southwest, but 
rather leave it to managers to determine desired conditions in a particular landscape.  In 
addition, we caution that the tradeoffs we see among small mammal species are likely 
to exist among other mammals, birds, and invertebrates, and all other species that live in 
ponderosa pine forests. 
Forest management in the Southwest tends to promote retention of big 
ponderosa pine trees, snags, and oak trees.  Our results showed that these attributes are 
good for some species, but like stand structure there is no “one-size-fits-all” solution for 
the small mammal community.  A diversity of these features across the landscape will 
restore and maintain the diversity of the small mammal community.  As some of these 

86 
 
features (i.e., snags and big trees) have decreased in prevalence on the landscape 
(Cooper 1961), managers may choose to make efforts to retain them.  However, more is 
not always necessarily better; for example, managers in the Southwest protect Gambel 
oak when implementing treatments, and thus this tree species has been increasing in 
density since presettlement times (Abella and Fulé 2008).  Although oak retention may 
be important for other animals, our results showed that increasing oak BA is not 
necessarily better for the small mammal community, particularly because only one 
species responded strongly to it (rock squirrel).   
We also showed that the size of a “big tree” matters in predicting small mammal 
occupancy, as trees >40cm dbh had little effect but trees >50cm dbh had an overall 
positive effect.  This may be useful to managers attempting to establish diameter caps 
for thinning or harvesting treatments.  The retention of slash piles on the landscape for 
several years (piles in our sites were burned after no more than 3 years) should lead to 
increased occupancy of all small mammal species, but some management agencies 
choose to burn the piles immediately.  However, the immediate removal of fuel reduces 
fire risk, a concern which often supersedes wildlife issues. 
The tassel-eared squirrel has been highlighted as a species that will be 
negatively impacted by thinning and restoration treatments (Patton et al. 1985, Dodd et 
al. 2006).  Our results uphold this inference.  However, the fact that the majority of the 
small mammal community increased in occupancy due to thinning and slash treatments 
should not be overlooked.  Furthermore, restoration treatments should, in the long term, 
promote the growth of large trees to which tassel-eared squirrels responded positively. 
Thus, although tassel-eared squirrel remain an indicator of the negative effects of 

87 
 
treatment, we offer golden-mantled ground squirrel as an indicator of the positive 
effects, as it had a strong response to treatment, slash, and reduced pine basal area.  
Similarly, the Mogollon vole showed a dramatic response to understory vegetation 
cover, with occupancy probabilities ranging from 0 in sites with no vegetation and 0.6 
at sites with high cover (65%); thus, this species may be a good indicator of a recovered 
site. 
Finally, we found that the rapid assessment, occupancy modeling approach was 
highly effective in evaluating the response of the small mammal community to 
treatment and other habitat attributes.  Small mammal studies are commonly 
confounded by high year-to-year variability, because r-selected species with short life 
spans and high reproductive rates react quickly and dramatically to environmental and 
climatic changes (MacArthur and Wilson 1967).  Particularly in the arid Southwest, 
most small mammal population studies end up primarily tracking precipitation patterns 
(Bagne and Finch 2009).  We showed a lack of a year effect by all species.  We attribute 
this to the fact that we measured occupancy, which should be more resistant to yearly 
changes, rather than density.   
In addition, we were able to sample a large number of sites per year because we 
did not have to uniquely mark each individual animal.  Although this study was a big 
effort, it obtained more reliable, repeatable results for a greater number of species than 
many of the equally-intensive small mammal studies with similar objectives, which 
relied on mark-recapture methods and density estimation.  The volume of data we 
collected and the spatial scale at which we designed this study resulted in clear patterns 
in response to habitat attributes with relatively small standard errors.  We suggest this 

88 
 
design be utilized in other studies that grapple with high variability and large spatial and 
temporal scales in assessing general impacts of treatments or habitat change on wildlife 
species.  Our study occurred at the stand level because that is currently the scale at 
which treatments are being planned and implemented in the Southwest ponderosa pine 
forests.  However, management is moving towards landscape-scale projects (i.e., the 
Four Forests Initiative in Arizona) and better ecological information at larger spatial 
scales is needed to inform these efforts.  This necessitates scaling up of studies of small 
mammals and other species, which could be achieved using occupancy approaches 
more readily than demographic methods.  We see this approach as having great 
potential for wildlife assessment and monitoring at the landscape level in an extremely 
cost efficient manner.

CHAPTER 4  
SMALL MAMMAL COMMUNITY MAINTAINS STABILITY THROUGH 
COMPOSITIONAL AND FUNCTIONAL COMPENSATION  
IN RESPONSE TO DISTURBANCE IN A  
SOUTHWESTERN PONDEROSA PINE FOREST ECOSYSTEM  
Abstract 
Understanding ecosystem stability has been of increasing interest in the past 
several decades as it helps predict the consequences of anthropogenic disturbances on 
ecosystems.  Species may exhibit stability through compensation, with greatly 
fluctuating populations year-to-year but a consistent density response over time in the 
face of multiple disturbances.  Stability is increased by functional redundancy, where 
species with similar functional roles compensate for one another by responding 
differently to environmental change.  Historically, the southwestern ponderosa pine 
ecosystem experienced repeated disturbance in the form of frequent fire.  Due to fire 
suppression, today’s forests have become unnaturally dense; there is now an emphasis 
on ecological restoration, whereby forests are thinned so that the natural fire regime can 
be safely reintroduced in an effort to restore ecosystem function to historical conditions.  
Using Royle density models and multi-model inference, we examined responses of 8 
species of small mammals to restoration (thinning and slash) treatments to determine if 
the community maintains total density and function (represented by ectomycorrhizal 
fungi dispersion) after disturbance.  Community composition differed in each of 6 years 
following treatment, but total density remained constant.  Total species densities were 

111 
 
significantly lower in stands with dense conditions than in stands with more open 
structural conditions similar to those of presettlement times, which had similar small 
mammal densities as the thinning treatments.  In addition, tassel-eared squirrels 
(Sciurus aberti), golden-mantled ground squirrels (Spermophilus lateralis), and gray-
collared chipmunks (Tamias cinereicollis) appeared to play a functionally redundant 
role in dispersing ectomycorrhizal fungi across different stand structures.  These results 
suggest that restoration treatments are maintaining ecosystem stability in terms of small 
mammal community structure and function.

Introduction 
The relationship between species composition and ecosystem stability has been 
of increasing interest.  While research often focuses on biodiversity as a stabilizing 
mechanism, an alternative theory proposes that ecosystem stability is a result of 
compensatory population dynamics of interacting species (Ernest and Brown 2001, 
Hughes et al. 2002).  For example, long-term studies on the Chihuahuan desert show 
that composition of small mammal species changes in response to disturbance, but 
richness, total population size, and biomass remain relatively constant (Ernest and 
Brown 2001).  A similar result was found in Tanzania, where individual ungulate grazer 
species changed in population size over time, but overall herbivore biomass remained 

112 
 
constant (Prins and Douglas-Hamilton 1990).  Thus, species compensation seems to 
lead to greater stability. 
Resistance is defined as the ability of species to withstand change (Pimm 1991).  
For vertebrates, this may mean that despite a reduction in numbers, the population 
remains viable.  The other strategy in the face of disturbance is resilience, or the ability 
to rebound quickly after an environmental perturbation (Pimm 1991).  These two 
strategies are associated with different life histories; resistant species tend to be long-
lived and far-ranging, with large body sizes and low reproductive outputs, and resilient 
species are usually small bodied, abundant, with high reproductive outputs (MacArthur 
and Wilson 1967, Hairston et al. 1970).  Therefore, assessing population fluctuations as 
a proxy for stability may not be accurate; resilient species may exhibit widely 
fluctuating populations year-to-year, but a consistent response over time.  For example, 
fluctuating populations of rodents seems to be within the natural range of variability in 
desert environments (Brown and Ernest 2002).  Klinger (2006) showed that in response 
to floods in Belize, species of small mammals retained ecosystem stability via 
resilience, with a high degree of variability of population size. 
When species have similar functional roles but respond somewhat differently to 
environmental change, this creates functional redundancy.  Functional redundancy has 
never been demonstrated empirically with vertebrates, although Naeem and Li (1997) 
showed it held in an experiment using microbes.  However, there is strong theoretical 
evidence in support of this hypothesis (Naeem 1998, Yachi and Loreau 1999, Hughes et 
al. 2002).  This is an important concept in terms of environmental perturbations, in that 

113 
 
it would indicate that a diverse system would be able to maintain ecosystem functioning 
in the face of environmental change (Ehrlich and Walker 1998).   
Historically, the southwestern ponderosa pine ecosystem experienced frequent 
disturbance via a natural fire regime with a 2-20 year interval (Covington and Moore 
1994, Fulé et al. 1997).  The resulting heterogeneity in time and space is the natural 
range of variability to which wildlife in ponderosa pine is adapted and may depend on 
for their long-term sustainability.  Noss and Csuti (1994) state that the greatest threat to 
biological diversity is the loss of evolutionary habitats, which is precisely what is 
happening in today’s ponderosa pine forests due to fire suppression and crown fire, 
which have created dense, homogenous forest stands very different from historical 
conditions (Moore et al. 1999, Westerling et al. 2006).  Thus, there is now an emphasis 
on ecological restoration in the Southwest, whereby forests are thinned to reduce fuel 
loads and the risk of crown fire, after which the natural fire regime can be safely 
reintroduced.  In this case, humans are introducing a perturbation meant to emulate 
natural disturbance; current conditions are outside of historical conditions or the 
“natural range of variability” (Landres et al. 1999).  Thus, restoration treatments seek to 
restore ecosystem stability and function.   
Small mammals commonly present in ponderosa pine forests of the Southwest 
include voles (Microtus spp.), woodrats (Neotoma spp.), mice (Peromyscus spp.), 
ground and tree squirrels (Spermophilus and Sciurus spp.), chipmunks (Tamias spp.), 
and gophers (Thomomys spp.).  As with other small mammal communities, year-to-year 
variability in density occurs due to environmental conditions such as drought and fire 
(Brown and Ernest 2002, Converse et al. 2006).  These species may play similar roles in 

114 
 
ecosystem functioning, including serving as prey for predators, increasing soil aeration, 
impacting regeneration abundance and patterns, and dispersing fungi (Hooven 1966, 
Cork and Kenagy 1989, Boal and Mannan 1994, Pyare and Longland 2001).  In 
particular, the dispersion of hypogeous fungi is largely reliant on small mammal 
disturbance and transfer through feces (Johnson 1996).  Due to the physical size of 
ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal spores, known as truffles, dispersal occurs primarily by 
ungulates and small mammals.   
In ponderosa pine forests, tassel-eared squirrels (Sciurus aberti) are dispersers of 
EM fungi (States et al. 1988, Dodd et al. 2003), but the contribution of other small 
mammal species is unknown.  Research in other forest types shows that voles, 
woodrats, ground squirrels, chipmunks, and pocket gophers can potentially disperse EM 
fungi (Claridge et al. 1999, Pyare and Longland 2001, Taylor et al. 2009).  Although 
tassel-eared squirrels are closely linked with dense stands of trees, other animals, 
including golden-mantled ground squirrels (Spermophilus lateralis) and Mogollon voles 
(Microtus mogollonensis), are associated with open stands (Chapter 3).  Meanwhile, 
generalists such as gray-collared chipmunks (Tamias cinereicollis) and deer mice 
(Peromyscus maniculatus) are found throughout various stand densities (Chapter 3).  In 
ponderosa pine forests, various members of the small mammal community may play 
similar functional roles, including that of fungal dispersion, in the different habitat types 
they occupy.  While fungal dispersion is not necessarily the most important function the 
community provides, we used it in this study to represent whether or not functional 
redundancy occurred within the community.   

115 
 
We examined density responses of 8 species of small mammals to thinning and 
slash treatments in order to understand how they responded to disturbance.  Typically, 
two disturbances occur during restoration treatments in southwestern ponderosa pine 
forests: first, the stand is thinned and the non-merchantable wood is stacked into slash 
piles, and second, the piles are burned after 0-3 years.  We predicted that although 
individual species densities would fluctuate in response to treatments, total community 
density would remain constant.  However, we predicted that slash would alter species 
compositions depending on the length of time the piles were left intact.  Density 
compensation among species would allow EM fungi dispersion to occur in different 
habitat types by different species at similar levels.  The objectives of this study were to  
1) determine if small mammal community total density remained constant after thinning 
while tradeoffs occurred among individual species densities (demonstrating stability 
through compensation); 2) examine how surrogate habitat in the form of slash piles and 
their subsequent burning (2nd disturbance) affected community composition; and 3) 
determine if the ecosystem function of fungal dispersion was associated with species in 
different habitat types (evidence of functional redundancy).   
Methods 
Study area- Our study area was located 8 km southwest of Flagstaff, Arizona, in 
ponderosa pine-dominated forests (Appendix 4-A).  Historically, this 18,500-ha area 
experienced a variety of forest management practices, including high grading (early 
1900s), commercial thinning (1970-1990s), and fuels reduction and restoration 
treatments (late 1990s-present).  Within a geographic information system (GIS; ArcGIS 
v9.3, ESRI, Redlands, California, USA), we overlaid a 500-m resolution lattice on the 

116 
 
study area to locate prospective sampling points.  We used this distance to ensure 
spatial independence in sampling points (i.e., eliminate autocorrelation) based on the 
larger home range of tassel-eared squirrels (Hoffmeister 1986).  We eliminated points 
that fell within private lands and non-forested patches >1 ha, or were located >500 m 
from a road.  From the remaining points, we randomly selected 100 sampling points, 
with approximately half in treated and half in untreated stands, and then located and 
permanently marked them in the field using a global positioning system. 
Data collection 
Small mammal sampling- We used each of the 100 sampling points as the center 
of a “site.”  We obtained Northern Arizona University Institutional Animal Care and 
Use Committee approval of our trapping methodology (protocol #06-005).  At each site 
we centered a 5x5 square trap grid which consisted of 25 Sherman (model LNATDG) 
traps with 20m spacing, with a 3x3 grid overlaid with 9 Tomahawk (model 202) traps, 
one at every other grid intersection; the combination of the 2 trap types ensured we 
captured the majority of species in the small mammal community (animals that weighed 
<1000 g).  Total site-scale sampling area was 14,400 m2 (1.4 ha).  We trapped small 
mammals at each site during the summers of 2006-2009 over a 10-week period late 
June to August.  We left both Sherman and Tomahawk traps open overnight, but closed 
the Sherman traps during the day to prevent animals from overheating.  We checked 
traps twice daily 4 days per week, which resulted in 3 nighttime and 3 daytime trapping 
sessions.  We sampled for Botta’s pocket gopher (Thomomys bottae) presence using an 
open-hole test, disturbing all gopher mounds located at the site with a shovel; we 
considered the species to be present if a mound was repaired within 24 hours 

117 
 
(Smallwood and Erickson 1995).  We determined the appropriate number of surveys 
following power analysis using data from our first year of sampling (2006). 
Vegetation sampling- To quantify overstory characteristics at each site, we 
established an 11.3m-radius circular overstory plot (400m2) at the site center, and 
measured tree species and diameter at breast height (dbh).  At the site level we counted 
the number of slash piles, and used our yearly observations and state and federal records 
to determine the age of each treatment and the number of years the slash piles were 
intact.  See Chapter 3 for a full description of the trapping and vegetation methods. 
Fungal sampling- We attempted fecal sampling during 2007-08.  We obtained 
fecal samples directly from golden-mantled ground squirrels and gray-collared 
chipmunks while in hand.  Other species were either too large to handle or did not 
provide samples, and we were unable to locate fecal samples in traps after their capture.  
At each site, we randomly chose 1or 2 individuals of each of the 2 species to sample, 
however not every animal would provide a fecal sample.  We froze samples until they 
were processed.  We randomly chose 30-40 samples per year to analyze, and made 5 
slides per sample using a standard protocol (Colgan et al. 1997).  With each slide, we 
randomly chose 5 fields of view under a microscope in which we counted the EM 
fungal spores.  We added the total number of spores per slide and averaged over the 5 
slides for each fecal sample.   
Data analysis 
Covariates- Based our previous analysis of this dataset, we determined that 
thinning and slash pile burning treatments were important variables for predicting 

118 
 
occupancy of most species in the small mammal community (Appendix 4-B); thus, we 
focused on 4 covariates that characterized treatments.  For each site, we calculated total 
basal area per hectare (BA).  We determined the number of years since thinning 
treatment (thin), the number of years since thinning that the slash piles at the site have 
been intact (slash), and the number of years since the piles were burned (burn).  Within 
the GIS, we obtained the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates of each 
site in order to derive a unique site-level identifier and consider the role of spatial 
location (i.e., latitudinal and longitudinal position) in our estimates of occupancy.  We 
reduced the 2 UTM coordinates into one variable using principal components analysis, 
similar to an interaction effect.  In addition, we pooled detection histories from all 4 
years of sampling and used “year” as a covariate.  UTM and year were included so that 
any heterogeneity due to a site or year effect would be modeled and incorporated into 
the density estimates.  This resulted in 6 covariates: thin, slash, burn, BA, year, and 
UTM.   
Royle density models and multi-model inference- Simple, or “naïve,” estimates 
of abundance can be calculated for a given site by simply averaging the number of 
counts of a species over the repeated visits to the site; however, most species are 
detected imperfectly, so this method can result in more biased estimates than those that 
account for detection probability and habitat covariates (MacKenzie et al. 2006).  We 
used the density modeling framework of Royle (2004) to estimate both detection 
probability, defined as the probability of detecting the species at a site if it is present, 
and density, defined as the number of animals per site, for each small mammal species.  
We fit all models using Program PRESENCE v2.4 (Hines 2007). 

119 
 
Prior to our data collection effort and analyses, we identified 10-15 candidate 
models using the 6 covariates that we hypothesized would predict density of each 
species in the small mammal community.  We used the same covariates for both density 
and detection probability.  We included a null model (i.e., intercept-only) for each 
species that assumed density was constant across the sites.  For each species, we built 
models using PRESENCE and compared them using Akaike’s Information Criterion 
adjusted for small sample sizes (AICc; Burnham and Anderson 2002).  We ranked 
model importance from highest to lowest according to differences (Δ) in their AICc 
values, and considered models with ΔAICc values ≤2 to have considerable support. We 
also computed weights of evidence and model selection uncertainty using AIC weights 
(wi; Burnham and Anderson 2002).   
For each species, we used density estimates derived using the best model for 
comparison with treatments.  We categorized treatments in terms of time since 
treatment: “dense” stands (N = 105) were unthinned (>25 years since treatment) stands 
that represent postsettlement or current conditions; 1-6 were stands in years post-
thinning (N = 33, 31, 31, 19, 15, 6, respectively); and “open,” meadow-like stands (N = 
38) were not recently treated (>25 years) and had low BA (<30m2/ha), chosen to 
resemble presettlement or restored conditions.  This resulted in a total of 8 “treatments.”   
We used a Tukey-Kramer Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test to 
compare total community density, and an unbalanced PERMANOVA procedure in R 
(Version 2.9.1, 2009) to test for differences in community composition across each 
treatment as a categorical variable (α = 0.05).   

120 
 
Fungal analysis- We built generalized linear models for all possible 
combinations of the 3 variables that we hypothesized predicted EM spore count: the 
year the sample was collected (year), the basal area of the site from which the sample 
was collected (BA), and the species that produced the sample (species; either golden-
mantled ground squirrel or gray-collared chipmunk).  We compared the models using 
the multi-model inference methods described above.  We graphed pine basal area versus 
mean EM spore count for the two species we sampled and for tassel-eared squirrels, 
using fecal data from Dodd et al. (2006). 
Results 
Small mammal sampling 
Due to various logistical issues that occurred each year (e.g., impassable roads, 
areas closed due to fire risk, excessive heat, etc.), sampling effort varied somewhat 
among years.  We sampled 14 sites in 2006 (pilot year), 96 in 2007, 86 in 2008, and 83 
in 2009 (n = 279).  Each year, we detected the Mogollon vole, Mexican woodrat 
(Neotoma mexicana), deer mouse, tassel-eared squirrel, golden-mantled ground squirrel, 
rock squirrel, gray-collared chipmunk, and Botta’s pocket gopher.   
Species density responses to thinning 
Each species responded to treatment (Table 4-1).  Gray-collared chipmunks and 
deer mice had the highest overall densities, while the other 6 species’ densities 
remained near or below 2 animals/ha (Figure 4-1).  Five species (gray-collared 
chipmunk, deer mouse, golden-mantled ground squirrel, rock squirrel, Mogollon vole) 
showed increased densities in response to thinning (years 1-6), but 3 species (tassel-

121 
 
eared squirrel, Botta’s pocket gopher, Mexican woodrat) slightly decreased during the 6 
years post-treatment (Figure 4-1).  All species had higher densities in the open treatment 
compared to the dense treatment except rock squirrels. 
Community density responses to thinning 
Overall density remained relatively constant following treatment at 15-17 
animals/ha (Figure 4-2).  The dense treatment had a significantly lower total density 
than stands years 1-6 after thinning or the open treatment (q = 3.05; Figure 4-2).  
However, community composition was significantly different in each of the 8 
treatments (p = 0.0001, R2 = 0.30).  Pairwise comparisons indicated that while the dense 
treatment differed from all other treatments for both community composition and total 
density, 17 of the other 21 treatment pairs were significantly different in terms of 
community composition, but none were significantly different in terms of total density 
(Table 4-2). 
Species density responses to slash piles and burning 
Slash appeared in a top model (either independently or as part of the global 
model) for 4 species; tassel-eared squirrels, golden-mantled ground squirrels, Mexican 
woodrats, and Botta’s pocket gopher.  Mexican woodrats decreased in density after 
treatment but remained at higher densities in the presence of slash piles, decreasing after 
piles were burned (Figure 4-3).  Similarly, golden-mantled ground squirrels increased in 
density during the years the piles were intact and decreased after the piles were burned; 
the species reached its highest density after slash piles were intact for 3 years at >2 
animals/ha (Figure 4-3).  Tassel-eared squirrels had a variable density response to the 
presence of slash piles but increased after they were burned in all scenarios except when 

122 
 
the piles were burned immediately after treatment (Figure 4-3).  Botta’s pocket gophers 
decreased in density while the slash piles were present but increased after each year 
slash piles were burned (Figure 4-3). 
Fungal dispersal potential in resulting stand types 
We analyzed 69 fecal samples for mean EM spore count.  The best model (wi = 
0.70) that predicted mean EM spore count used the year and BA covariates (Table 4-3).  
Both golden-mantled ground squirrel and gray-collared chipmunk EM counts were 
positively correlated with BA (Figure 4-4).  The species from which the sample was 
collected did not affect mean spore count (Table 4-3).   
Discussion 
Species density tradeoffs occurred following thinning treatments.  These 
findings are consistent with the literature; tassel-eared squirrels and Mexican woodrats 
should respond negatively to thinning because of their positive relationship with basal 
area and canopy cover (Patton 1977, Dodd et al. 2006) and shrub cover and down wood 
(Block et al. 2005, Converse et al. 2006), respectively.  Golden-mantled ground 
squirrels, Botta’s pocket gophers, and Mogollon voles are associated with increased 
understory cover and reduced tree density (Tevis 1956, Huntly and Inouye 1988, Bagne 
and Finch 2009).  Deer mice and gray-collared chipmunks are generalists that are found 
in most habitats (Hoffmeister 1986, Coppeto et al. 2006).  Thus, species densities 
fluctuated but overall community density remained constant following treatment, 
indicating that the community remained stable through compensation.   

123 
 
Three species that decreased in density after thinning (Mexican woodrat, tassel-
eared squirrel, Botta’s pocket gopher) had higher densities in open stands than in any 
previous scenario, suggesting that if restoration treatments can achieve this desired 
endpoint, it will benefit these species despite short-term losses.  Furthermore, total 
species densities were higher in the open treatments than the dense sites, and the dense 
sites had significantly lower total densities than the other treatments.  Thus, the thinning 
treatments produced community compositions that more closely emulated presettlement 
conditions.  However, while the open stands provide a reference point by which to 
judge the effectiveness of treatments, these stand structures differ from true 
presettlement conditions.  Due to logging near Flagstaff during the late 1800’s, trees at 
our study sites tended to be small (less than 2% of the trees we measured were ≥60 cm) 
unlike presettlement conditions which contained low densities of large trees (quadratic 
mean diameter of 42 cm) (Fulé et al. 1997).   
The differing species density responses to slash piles and burning similarly 
showed tradeoffs due to disturbance.  For some species, slash piles may have provided 
supplemental habitat in the form of cover.  Golden-mantled ground squirrels and 
Mexican woodrats clearly responded to this additional resource, as they are often 
associated with down wood and shrub cover (Goodwin and Hungerford 1979, Smith 
and Maguire 2004, Block et al. 2005); however, in all scenarios their density by year 6 
was approximately the same, so the benefit of the supplemental habitat did not 
permanently increase the species’ density.  Meanwhile, tassel-eared squirrels and pocket 
gophers had lower densities as the duration of slash piles increased, perhaps due to 
competition with other species since they do not benefit as much from the slash piles, 

124 
 
nesting and foraging primarily in trees and underground, respectively (Hoffmeister 
1986).  Again, these results demonstrated a tradeoff between individual species 
densities even in the presence of a supplemental resource.     
Species compositional changes are usually studied in assessing ecosystem 
stability because it is logistically simpler to count animals than to investigate changes in 
function (Prins and Douglas-Hamilton 1990, Ernest and Brown 2001, Naeem and 
Wright 2003).  However, although total small mammal species density increased after 
thinning treatment and then remained constant over time, we cannot simply assume that 
ecosystem function improved or remained stable.  Although all species in our 
community can potentially disperse EM fungi (with the possible exception of the deer 
mouse; Pyare and Longland 2001), we showed that tassel-eared squirrels, golden-
mantled ground squirrels, and gray-collared chipmunks were functionally redundant in 
that they carried similar amounts of EM spores in their feces in different stand structural 
types.  The increase in average EM counts with pine basal area was likely because there 
was increased availability, since EM are associated with increased canopy cover of 
intermediate-aged ponderosa pines (States and Gaud 1997); however, Korb et al. (2003) 
showed that restoration treatments did not decrease the relative amount of EM fungi 
propagules.  Thus, fungi dispersion is likely important across open and dense stands, 
and the two specialist squirrel species and one generalist chipmunk may compensate in 
terms of providing this ecosystem function.  
We conclude that in this ecosystem, species compensated for one another in 
response to treatment in terms of density, while the community remained at an overall 
stable density.  Our results suggest that EM fungal dispersion is a functionally 

125 
 
redundant role that many of the small mammal species fill across different stand 
structural types.  Total community density was higher and more stable following 
thinning treatment, and similar to species composition in presettlement stand structures, 
suggesting that restoration treatments are maintaining ecosystem stability in terms of 
small mammal community structure and function.

Dense stands were unthinned, 1-6 indicate time since thinning treatment, and open 
stands were meadow-like but unthinned.  Dense stands were different from other 
treatments (q = 3.05) in terms of total density, but community composition was 
significantly different in each of the 8 treatments (p = 0.0001).

CHAPTER 5 
CONCLUSIONS 
This dissertation was designed to assist managers in developing ecological 
restoration treatments, advance our ecological understanding of how communities 
respond to disturbance, and reveal additional research needs. 
Management recommendations 
In Chapter 2, I showed that small-diameter harvest and burning treatments had 
positive effects but thin/burn and selective harvest treatments had no detectable effect 
on most small mammals and passerine bird species reported in studies suitable for meta-
analysis; overstory removal and wildfire resulted in an overall negative response.  Thus, 
small-diameter removal and burning treatments as currently being implemented in the 
Southwest do not negatively impact most of the wildlife species in the studies I 
examined, at least in the short term (≤10 yrs).  These results support the hypothesis that 
thinning and burning at the landscape level are consistent with ecological restoration 
objectives for wildlife.   
In Chapter 3, I found that the average occupancy of all small mammal species in 
the community was positively related to thinning treatment and slash.  The most 
important habitat variables in predicting small mammal community occupancy were 
pine basal area, treatment intensity (percent of trees removed and time since treatment), 
the number and length of time slash piles are left on the ground, rock cover, and snags 
>40cm diameter.  Five species (Microtus mogollonensis, Peromyscus maniculatus, 
Spermophilus lateralis, Spermophilus variegates, Tamias cinereicollis) responded 

144 
 
positively to treatment and three (Neotoma mexicana, Sciurus aberti, Thomomys bottae) 
negatively; the average occupancy of all species combined was positively related to 
treatment.  All but two species (P. maniculatus, Thomomys bottae) responded positively 
to slash piles, and average occupancy of all species was positively related to slash.  For 
all habitat attributes, I found tradeoffs in the response of each species which illustrated 
that no one treatment benefitted all species, but rather an arrangement of dense and 
open stands across the landscape with heterogeneity in fine-scale features is likely the 
best management approach for small mammals.   
Ecological conclusions 
In Chapter 4, I found that small mammal community composition differed in 
each of 6 years following treatment, but total density remained constant.  Total species 
densities were significantly lower in stands with dense conditions than in stands with 
more open structural conditions similar to those of presettlement times, which had 
similar small mammal densities as the thinning treatments.  In addition, tassel-eared 
squirrels, golden-mantled ground squirrels, and gray-collared chipmunks appeared to 
play a functionally redundant role in dispersing ectomycorrhizal fungi across different 
stand structures.  These results suggest that restoration treatments are maintaining 
ecosystem stability in terms of small mammal community structure and function.   
Future research needs 
Although I assessed thousands of papers on restoration impacts on wildlife, I 
found only 25 studies that produced sufficient information for meta-analysis, revealing 
a need for greater coordination of research efforts.  The vast majority of studies in the 
analysis were short-term responses of birds to treatment.  Underrepresented taxa include 

145 
 
reptiles and amphibians; rare birds and small mammals that are not easily assessed 
using conventional point count and trapping methodologies; medium and large 
mammals, including both predators and ungulates; and birds of prey.  Many of these 
species are not entirely ignored in the literature, but rather density is generally not an 
appropriate response variable for animals with large home ranges.  However, the lack of 
studies that assess reproductive responses of these species indicates a paucity of 
research on these large and top trophic animals.  Studies at larger temporal and spatial 
scales, which examine more informative response variables for a greater variety of 
species, are critical to fully understanding the impacts of forest treatments on wildlife. 
To fill some of the data gaps revealed by the meta-analysis, I trapped eight 
species of small mammals at 294 sites in northern Arizona over four years, in what is 
now the largest study of its kind.  I found that the rapid assessment, occupancy 
modeling approach was highly effective in evaluating the response of the small 
mammal community to treatment and other habitat attributes.  Particularly in the arid 
Southwest, most small mammal population studies end up primarily tracking 
precipitation patterns, but I showed a lack of a year effect by all species.  Although this 
study was a big effort, it obtained more reliable, repeatable results for a greater number 
of species than many of the equally-intensive demographic studies with similar 
objectives.  I suggest this design be utilized in other studies that grapple with high 
variability in assessing general impacts of treatments or habitat change on wildlife 
species.  This will be particularly important as management moves towards landscape-
scale projects, and better ecological information at larger spatial scales is needed to 
inform these efforts.
