Abstract—To test an approach for restoring historical stand densities and increasing 
plant species diversity of a pinyon-juniper ecosystem, we implemented a demon-
stration project at two sites (CR and GP) on the Grand Canyon-Parashant National 
Monument in northern Arizona. Historical records indicated that livestock grazing 
was intensive on the sites beginning in the late 1800s and continuing through the 
mid 1900s. Repeat aerial photographs (1940 and 1992) indicated recent increases 
in stand density and encroachment of trees into formerly open areas. Age distribu-
tions indicated that the majority of pinyon trees at both sites were less than 100 years 
of age and juniper establishment appeared to peak in the late 1800s to early 1900s, 
although some junipers had establishment dates as early as 1700-1725. Pretreatment 
understory communities were sparse (< 7% total herbaceous cover) as were seedling 
densities in seed banks (151 seedlings per m2 (14 seedlings per ft2) at CR and 192 
seedlings per m2 (18 seedlings per ft2) at GP). Before experimental treatments were 
implemented, a bark beetle outbreak at GP resulted in >50% pinyon mortality, which 
was positively related to tree size and age. The demonstration treatment consisted of 
thinning small trees (< 25 cm diameter at root collar (DRC)), lopping and scattering 
thinned trees, and seeding native understory species. Thinning and mortality reduced 
overstory density from 638 and 832 trees per hectare pretreatment (258 and 337 trees 
per acre) to 280 and 251 trees per hectare (113 and 102 per acre) posttreatment at 
CR and GP, respectively. Posttreatment densities were similar to those suggested for 
the late 1800s by dendrochronological stand reconstructions. Thinning small diameter 
pinyon increased residual quadratic mean diameter (QMD) at CR and the relative 
importance of juniper at both sites. Live canopy fuels were reduced by treatment at 
CR and by thinning plus beetle-related mortality at GP. Although thinning slash was 
lopped and scattered, woody surface fuels were not significantly different between 
treated and control units at either site, perhaps due to the small size of thinned trees 
and the large interspace areas into which slash was scattered. Treatment had no im-
mediate effects on herbaceous cover or species richness, both of which may take more 
time to develop. Further monitoring will help to clearly evaluate the effectiveness of 
this treatment for satisfying restoration and conservation goals.
Introduction
In this paper, we report preliminary results of an ecological restoration demon-
stration project we are conducting at two pinyon-juniper sites in northern Arizona. 
The project was initiated as a response to ecosystem health concerns described for 
pinyon-juniper woodlands of the Southwest. On many pinyon-juniper sites, recent 
ecological changes include decreased diversity of grasses and forbs, decreased 
biotic and genetic diversity, introduction of exotic species, increased soil erosion,

and decreased site productivity (Dahms and Geils 1997, West 1999, Hastings and 
others 2003). Many of these deleterious effects appear to be linked to intensive 
livestock grazing, exclusion of naturally occurring fire, and striking increases 
in tree density commencing in the late 1800s with the arrival of EuroAmerican 
settlers and industrial land use practices (Burkhardt and Tisdale 1976, Young 
and Evans 1981, West 1999, Miller and Tausch 2001). One possible solution for 
improving ecosystem health and sustainability is ecological restoration.
Several papers dealing with ecological restoration are presented in this proceed-
ings and a brief discussion of definitions is warranted. The Society for Ecological 
Restoration defines restoration as “the process of assisting the recovery of an 
ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed” (SER 2002). Although 
this definition implies reparation of an identifiable ecosystem (i.e., not creation of 
an entirely new system), it does not tell us how to balance strict focus on histori-
cal patterns with uncertainty about those patterns and our desires for improved 
site conditions. Some scholars contend that “good” restoration must represent 
both an attempt to reestablish ecological integrity as well as a specific focus on 
addressing social values and concerns (Higgs 1997). Other basic principles of 
restoration include the following: a) identify and halt causes of degradation; b) set 
goals for recovery; c) establish monitoring programs, measures of success, and 
adaptive processes; and d) plan for the long-term. Finally, all principles must be 
embedded within a collaborative framework. In this demonstration project, we 
endeavored to restore historical ecosystem characteristics as well as initiate the 
development of future conditions desired by land managers.
Study Area
We identified two sites for study on Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monu-
ment near Mount Trumbull, Arizona (fig. 1). The Craig Ranch site (CR) is located 
at latitude 36N 26’ 01” and longitude 113W 09’ 40”. The Goose Ponds (GP) site is 
located at latitude 36N 24’ 46”, and longitude 113W 12’ 15”. Elevation of the sites 
ranges from approximately 1900 m to 1950 m (6270-6435 ft) (fig. 1). Precipitation 
averages approximately 50 cm (19.7 in) annually and falls during distinct winter 
and summer periods. Soils at the CR site are shallow to deep gravelly sandy loams 
to very cobbly clays derived from limestone, basalt, and sandstone alluvium and 
colluvium. Those at the GP site are shallow to very deep, very cindery loams de-
rived from alluvial and colluvial, scoriaceous basalt and pyroclastics (USDA Soil 
Conservation Service 1993, 1995a,b). Vegetation at the sites is classified as Great 
Basin Cold Temperature Woodland (Brown 1994). Overstories are all-aged mix-
tures of pinyon pine (Pinus edulis Engelm.) and juniper (Juniperus osteosperma 
Torr.). Understory communities generally are sparse and include annual forbs: 
Descurainia pinnata and Draba spp.; some perennial grasses: Bouteloua gracilis, 
Bouteloua curtipendula, and Aristida purpurea; perennial forbs: Eriogonum spp. 
and Chamaesyce fendleri; shrubs: Quercus turbinella, Purshia mexicana, and 
cacti: Opuntia erinacea.
Site Assessment
Observations of the two sites suggested ecological degradation in two main 
forms: (1) low plant species diversity with communities dominated by dense 
pinyon and juniper overstories; and (2) reduced soil O horizons, particularly in 
intercanopy openings. Examination of repeat aerial photos showed that both sites 
had experienced some degree of overstory densification and tree encroachment

from 1940 to 1992. We saw numerous dead shrub remnants on the sites, suggest-
ing recent change in understory community characteristics. We suspected that 
these conditions may have been in part due to intensive livestock grazing. For 
example, a 1961 U.S. Forest Service report explained that grass cover, depleted 
by uncontrolled overgrazing before 1900, had not yet recovered (before 1975 the 
area was under Forest Service administration) (Unpublished report, BLM District 
Office, St George, UT). Overuse apparently continued through the 1960s; a range 
inspection report from 1969 stated that all three allotments in the area were in 
very poor condition and grass was almost 100% utilized each season (unpublished 
report, BLM District Office, St George, UT). Repeat aerial photographs indicated 
that a water catchment was developed at the GP site between 1940 and 1992 
(fig. 1) and historical maps indicated that a pipeline was built to provide water to 
livestock near the CR site. Intensive grazing likely reduced native plant species 
diversity and impacted soil quality but its effect on natural disturbance patterns is 
less clear. Field observations at the two study sites revealed some charred wood; 
however, details regarding the fire history of the two sites are not known.

Measurements
At each site, we used aerial photographs and topographic maps to delineate a 
9-ha (22.2-acre) area that was relatively homogenous in terms of overstory density, 
slope, and aspect. We divided these areas into two 4.5-ha (11.1-acre) units per 
site and randomly assigned units to receive restoration treatment or remain as a 
control. We established six 0.04-ha (0.1 acre) circular sampling plots on a 60-m 
(196.8 ft) grid in each unit. For long-term monitoring purposes, we used steel 
rebar to mark plot centers and georeferenced these points.
In 2002, we measured overstory, understory, and surface fuels characteristics 
on each plot. We measured diameter at root collar (DRC) for all live and dead 
trees and total height for all live and standing dead trees. We collected increment 
cores from all trees ≥20 cm DRC and from a 20% random subsample of smaller 
trees (< 20 cm DRC). Increment cores collected in the field were brought back 
to the laboratory, mounted on wooden slats, sanded, and crossdated (Stokes 
and Smiley 1968). We tallied dead tree structures (i.e., snags, logs, stumps) by 
condition class as described by Thomas and others (1979) and Maser and others 
(1979) for ponderosa pine. Tree seedlings (< 1.37 m (4.5 ft) in height) and shrubs 
were tallied on subplots (100 m2; 0.025 acre) within the main plot. We used 10 
quadrats (1m2; 10.8 ft2) per plot to sample cover of herbaceous species. We mea-
sured surface fuels and forest floor depth on planar transects (15.24 m; 50 feet) 
according to Brown (1974).
In 2002, a severe drought and bark beetle (Ips confusus) outbreak occurred. In 
2003, before restoration treatments had been implemented, we resampled overstory 
structure on the plots to assess tree mortality. Signs of beetle presence (e.g., frass 
or pitch tubes) were noted. After thinning and spring seeding (see Treatment), 
we resampled overstory structure, regeneration, shrubs, fuels, and herbaceous 
understory (June 2004).
Pretreatment Conditions
We relied on assessment of present stand conditions and historical reconstruc-
tion to develop a restoration treatment prescription. Pretreatment measurements 
in 2002 indicated dense forest conditions at both sites (table 1). At the CR site,

juniper was dominant in the overstory in terms of number of trees (61% of TPH) 
and BA (83% of BA). At the GP site, juniper trees were outnumbered (29%) by 
pinyon but made up a greater proportion of the total basal area (73%). Cumula-
tive age distributions derived from increment core analysis showed the majority 
of pinyon trees at both sites were less than 100 years old and a notable spike in 
their establishment occurred after 1950, particularly at the GP site (fig. 2). Juniper 
cores were often difficult to crossdate against known tree-ring chronologies. For 
such samples, we approximated tree age by conducting ring counts. Juniper at 
both sites had establishment peaks corresponding to the late 1800s to early 1900s 
(fig. 2). At the CR site, some junipers established as early as 1700-1725. At the 
GP site, we found no junipers that had established before 1800. Juniper seedlings 
(individuals less than 1.37 m (4.5 ft) in height) averaged 117-200 per ha (47-81 
per acre) at the CR site and 50-117 per ha (20-47 per acre) at the GP site. Pinyon 
seedlings averaged 900-967 and 617-1433 per ha (364-391 and 250-580 per acre) 
at the CR and GP sites, respectively.
We estimated presettlement stand density for each site using age data from 
increment cores. Trees with center dates less than 1875 were considered presettle-
ment in origin. To account for additional trees that died between 1875 and 2002, 
we included dead structures (i.e., snags, logs, and stumps) greater that 25 cm 
DRC in our presettlement density estimates. At the CR site, the number of trees 
estimated to exist in 1875 was 261 TPH (102.7 TPA) (table 2). Approximately 75% 
of these presettlement trees (live and dead) were juniper (196 TPH (79 TPA)). At 
GP, estimated presettlement density was 104 TPH (42 TPA) and approximately 
60% of these trees were juniper (table 2).

Understory vegetation was sparse at both sites (table 3). Mean cover was less 
than 7% at the CR site and less than 4% at the GP site. Species richness averaged 
11.2-12.8 species per m2 (10.8 ft2) at CR and 4.2-4.7 at the GP site. Commonly 
occurring species at CR in 2002 included Cordylanthus parviflorus, Draba sp. 
(annual forbs), Aristida purpurea, Bouteloua curtipendula, Bouteloua gracilis 
(perennial grasses), Arabis fendleri, Calochortus nuttallii (perennial forbs), and 
Opuntia erinacea (cactus). Only one exotic species was found; Lactuca serriola 
occurred on ~3% of the quadrats in the treated unit. At GP, perennial forbs were 
most common, particularly Chaenactis douglasii, Mirablis oxybaphoides, and 
the exotic, Marrubium vulgare. Two other exotic species were found: Bromus 
tectorum on ~2% of the quadrats in both units and Salsola tragus on ~3% of 
quadrats in the control unit.
Woody surface fuels were minimal at both sites (table 4). Combined 1-hour 
and 10-hour fuels averaged 1.2 Mg/ha (0.53 T/acre) at the CR site and 1.7 Mg/ha 
(0.76 T/acre) at the GP site. Total forest floor depth at both sites averaged less 
than 1.3 cm (0.5 in). Total live canopy fuels averaged near 7.5 Mg/ha (3.3 T/acre) 
at both sites (table 4).

Restoration Goals
Based on preliminary site assessments and analysis of pretreatment stand 
conditions, we developed the following restoration goals: (1) reduce overstory 
density to near presettlement levels; (2) reestablish historical overstory species 
composition; (3) reduce severe fire hazard; (4) reduce bark beetle susceptibility; 
and (5) reestablish a diverse understory. These goals represented an integration 
of reestablishing historical patterns of overstory structure and composition, a 
desire to increase biological diversity in understory communities, and a desire 
to protect important attributes such as old pinyon and juniper trees.
Treatment Prescription
Our restoration treatment approach entailed thinning trees to low densities, 
scattering slash, and seeding with native grasses. Specifically, we implemented the 
following prescription: (1) thin pinyon and juniper trees less than 25 cm (9.8 in) 
DRC, except for trees retained to replace presettlement evidence (i.e., dead tree 
structures >25 cm DRC) at a 2:1 ratio by species; (2) lop slash to 1 m (3.3 ft) or 
less in length and scatter material to cover bare soil; (3) seed with native plant 
species. Using tree increment cores, linear regression of establishment date and 
DRC data suggested that pinyon pine trees less than 25 cm DRC were likely to be 
less than 130 years of age and therefore postsettlement in origin (Establishment 
Date = 1977.12 - 4.25*(DRC); R2 = 0.57; P < 0.001). Age-diameter relationships 
for juniper were poor (R2 < 0.15). Retaining two postsettlement-aged trees to 
replace each dead presettlement structure was used as a conservative approach to 
restoring historical densities and also allowed for posttreatment mortality. Selec-
tion of replacement was based on species, size, form, and proximity to structure 
being replaced. Thinning was completed November 2003.
Selection of native plant species for seeding was based on observations of local 
occurrence, baseline data from belt transects, and community data reported in 
relict site literature (Mason and others 1967, Schmutz and others 1967, Thatcher 
and Hart 1974, Madany and West 1984, Rowlands and Brain 2001). We selected

five grasses: Bouteloua curtipendula, B. gracilis, Elymus elymoides, Oryzopsis 
hymenoides, and Sporobolis cryptandrus; one forb: Lupinus argenteus; and four 
shrub species: Amelanchier utahensis, Atriplex canescens, Ephedra viridis, and 
Rhus trilobata. We used hand seeders to broadcast at a rate (18 kg/ha (16 lb/
acre)) that approximated common standards for range rehabilitation (Clary 1988). 
However, we chose to seed half the amount in early spring and half in late sum-
mer in order accommodate germination and establishment requirements for both 
cool and warm season species. Using site preparation methods such as plowing 
or disking before seeding was not feasible. Similarly, we did not harrow or rake 
the restoration units after the seed was broadcast, but instead utilized thinning 
slash to provide cover and mulch for the seeds.
Data Analyses
We used logistic regression to test (alpha = 0.05) for relationships between 
probability of beetle-related pinyon mortality and tree height, DRC, age, and 
basal area growth at the GP site. We used Student’s t-test to compare (alpha = 
0.05) forest structure and understory characteristics at each of the two sites for 
pretreatment (2002) differences. When significant differences were found, we 
used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to test posttreatment differences with 
pretreatment conditions as a covariate. When no pretreatment differences were 
found, t-tests were used to compare posttreament means. Tree canopy biomass 
was estimated using allometric equations for pinyon (Pinus edulis) and juniper 
(Juniperus monosperma) provided by Grier and others (1992). We estimated sur-
face fuel loading using equations provided by Brown (1974) and coefficients for 
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) fuels provided by Sackett (1980); no pinyon or 
juniper fuels coefficients were available in the published literature. Differences 
in biomass and fuels means between control and treated units were analyzed as 
described above for overstory characteristics.
Bark Beetle Effects
Bark beetle-related mortality of pinyon trees in 2003 was significantly related 
to tree size and growth. Probability increased with increasing height, DRC, and 
age. Mortality was less likely for trees that showed high relative BA growth. Mean 
height of beetle-killed trees was 4.2 m (13.8 ft) whereas surviving trees averaged 
3.3 m (10.8 ft). Mean DRC was 12.3 cm (4.8 in) and 10.0 cm (3.9 in) for beetle-
killed and surviving trees, respectively. Mean age of beetle-killed trees was 89 
whereas surviving trees averaged 64 years. Beetle-killed trees showed a mean 
decrease of 15% in BA increment over the 10 years before mortality.
Treatment Effects
Implementation of the restoration thinning prescription significantly altered 
overstory structural characteristics at the CR site but did not affect those at the 
GP site, largely because of the greater impacts of beetle-related mortality (table 1). 
Thinning trees smaller than 25 cm DRC—while replacing dead structures greater 
than 25 cm DRC—reduced the number of juniper trees by nearly one-half and the 
number of pinyon by more than a factor of three at CR. Thinning at GP reduced 
the mean number of junipers by 83 TPH (33.6 TPA) but this did not result in a 
significant difference between control and treated conditions (table 1). Bark beetle-
related mortality resulted in statistically similar pinyon densities between the

control and treated units at GP (table 1). Basal area was not significantly affected 
by thinning treatment at either site (table 1). Diameter distributions, however, 
showed that dominance of small pinyon at CR was decreased by thinning. This 
was expressed as significantly greater QMD of both juniper and pinyon in the 
treated unit compared with the control at CR (table 1). At the GP site, diameter 
distributions were affected by both thinning and beetle-related mortality and 
no significant differences in QMD were found between the control and treated 
units (table 1).
Stand densities after thinning at both the CR and GP restoration units were 
similar to presettlement estimates (table 2). The total number of trees remaining 
after restoration thinning at CR was 280 TPH (113 TPA) and juniper comprised 
approximately 73%. There were 251 TPH (101.6 TPA) remaining after treatment 
at GP and juniper made up 62% of the residual number.
No significant differences in herbaceous plant cover, species richness, or di-
versity were detected between control and treated units at either site in June 2004 
(table 3). Species composition was similar to pretreatment conditions. Two exotic 
species were observed at the CR site (treatment and control): Lactuca serriola 
(3% frequency) and Tragopogon dubius (2% frequency). Five exotic species were 
observed at the GP site. Bromus tectorum frequency in the GP treated unit was 
1.7% in 2004 whereas it was not observed on these plots in 2002.
Thinning increased surface fuel loading at both sites, particularly for mois-
ture-lag classes greater than 10-hours (table 4). Differences between control and 
treated units, however, were not statistically significant at either site. Changes in 
forest floor litter and duff depths due to treatment were minimal and remained 
low after treatment (table 4). Canopy biomass was significantly reduced by thin-
ning at the CR site (table 4). Due to beetle-related mortality that occurred in the 
both treated as well as the control units, no significant differences were found in 
live canopy biomass at GP site in 2004 (table 4).
Discussion
Various lines of evidence, including historical and contemporary aerial 
photographs, diameter and age distributions, and dendrochronological recon-
structions indicated a transition at both study sites from previously more open 
stand conditions existing in the late 1800s to closed conditions found at the site 
in 2002. At the CR site, the number of trees in 2002 was more than twice the 
number estimated to be present in 1875. This difference was even more dramatic 
at the GP site where 2002 density was greater than the estimated presettlement 
number of trees by a factor of eight. In addition to changes in overstory density, 
both sites appeared to be moving toward increased importance of pinyon rela-
tive to juniper. Large junipers were present at both sites and this was reflected 
in greater BA in comparison to pinyon. Age data suggested that peak juniper 
establishment was around 1875-1900 at CR and 1875-1925 at GP whereas pinyon 
establishment appeared to peak around 1950 at both sites. It should be noted that 
precise crossdating of juniper is difficult and these establishment dates are best 
considered as approximations. Pinyon seedlings outnumbered juniper by a factor 
of four or more at both sites.
Comparable postsettlement changes have been described on pinyon-juniper 
sites throughout the Southwest and Great Basin (Blackburn and Tueller 1970, 
West and others 1975, Tausch and others 1981, Jacobs and Gatewood 1999, West 
1999, Romme and others 2003, Landis and Bailey 2005). For example, on four 
black sagebrush (Artemisia nova) sites in Nevada, Blackburn and Tueller (1970) 
concluded that juniper (J. osteosperma) initially invaded open sage communities

whereas pinyon became more prevalent as overstory densities increased. Age 
distributions indicated that juniper trees were present as early as 1725 but establish-
ment began to dramatically increase around 1850 for juniper and 1920 for pinyon. 
Similarly, Tausch and others (1981) reported that increases in tree dominance since 
the early 1800s on eastern Nevada and western Utah sites were driven by pinyon 
establishment. Factors responsible for driving these structural changes include 
relaxation of interspecific competition due to intensive grazing, increases in 
woody vegetation (“nurses” for pinyon establishment—see below), fire exclusion 
due to livestock grazing (removal of fine fuels) and active suppression, warmer, 
moister climatic patterns of the late 1800s to early 1900s, and recent increases in 
atmospheric CO2 (Leopold 1924, Burkhardt and Tisdale 1976, Young and Evans 
1981, West 1999, Miller and Tausch 2001, Romme and others 2003).
At the GP site, a bark beetle outbreak reduced overstory density of pinyon 
and this could be interpreted as a natural disturbance that counteracts recent in-
creases in density and provides restoration benefits. Although this is true in part, 
at the GP site beetles preferentially attacked larger, older pinyon—elements of 
the historical stand conditions that are desirable to retain for conservation (e.g., 
wildlife habitat) and multi-resource reasons. Further, high density of standing 
dead pinyon may represent increased fire hazard for one or two years while dead 
needles remain on the tree.
Similar patterns of beetle activity were found by Negrón and Wilson (2003) 
who reported that tree diameter (DRC) and mistletoe infestation were good 
predictors (72% correct classification) of beetle attack on pinyon near Flagstaff, 
Arizona. Stand density was also positively related to beetle attack. In order to 
reduce the probability of beetle-related mortality in pinyon-juniper woodlands, 
reducing pinyon stand density index (SDI; Reineke 1933) to values of 50 or less 
are recommended (Negrón and Wilson 2003). Thinning at the CR site reduced 
pinyon SDI to 81 from 122 in 2002. Thinning and mortality reduced SDI at the 
GP site to 34 from 212 in 2002. In the control unit, SDI was 75 in 2005.
The restoration prescription implemented at the two sites appeared to be 
effective in reduce stand density to levels similar to those suggested by dendro-
chronological reconstructions. The majority of trees removed from both sites 
were small pinyon (table 2); this increased the relative importance of juniper and 
restored overstory composition to characteristics similar to those existing in the 
late 1800s. Selective tree removal using chainsaws is preferable to indiscriminate 
techniques such as anchor chaining or cabling that may cause substantial soil 
disturbance and stimulate regeneration of juniper (Jacobs and Gatewood 1999, 
Brockway and others 2002). The approach we tested conserves all large trees. 
Clearer description of historical patterns could be provided by reconstruction 
models that utilize dendrochronological information, tree death date predictions 
(i.e., decay rates, harvesting records, insect outbreak dates, etc.), and back-growth 
equations. Fire history information also would be helpful in developing restora-
tion prescriptions for closely emulating historical conditions. Presettlement fire 
characteristics in pinyon-juniper woodlands are poorly understood (Romme and 
others 2003, Baker and Shinneman 2004) and we are currently pursuing fire his-
tory research on other northern Arizona and New Mexico sites.
In our study, no significant differences in herbaceous parameters were found 
between the treatment (slash additions and seeding) and control units. Posttreat-
ment measurements, however, were conducted just four months after seeding 
was completed. Further monitoring is necessary before conclusions can be made 
regarding the effectiveness of treatment on increasing understory abundance and 
species richness.
Thinning significantly reduced live canopy biomass as compared with the 
control unit at the CR site. This represents a decrease in crown fire hazard,

 although we did not attempt to model potential fire behavior. At the GP site, bark 
beetle-related mortality decreased live canopy biomass although trees killed by 
beetles in the control unit will retain their needles for one or two years and create 
an increased hazard. Thinning slash lopped and scattered at both sites did not 
significant affect woody surface fuel loads. This may reflect the combined influ-
ences of thinning only small trees and large interspace areas that were targeted 
for slash dispersal.
Other pinyon-juniper restoration experiments have tested slash dispersal and 
seeding treatments to promote understory recovery (Jacobs and Gatewood 1999, 
Brockway and others 2002). Results have been variable. For example, Jacobs 
and Gatewood (1999) found that lopping and scattering slash into interspaces 
substantially increased herbaceous cover at two sites in northern New Mexico, 
although seeding did not significantly contribute to the increases. In contrast, 
Brockway and others (2002) reported positive effects of tree removal on grass 
cover but no significant differences between slash removal and slash dispersal 
treatments at a site in central New Mexico. Stoddard (unpublished) reports find-
ing significant increases in plant cover on plots with slash and seed additions 
compared with control plots in interspaces adjacent our demonstration units at 
Mount Trumbull. Thinning slash that is scattered into degraded interspaces may 
increase rates of seedling establishment by altering microsite conditions. Some 
of these changes may include dampening of soil temperature fluctuations and 
extremes, increasing soil moisture content, providing structure that traps seeds, 
and reducing erosion (Jacobs and Gatewood 1999, Hastings and others 2003, 
Stoddard and others 2005).
Conclusions
Although there is still much that is not known regarding historical conditions 
at the two demonstration sites, the restoration treatment implemented appeared 
to be effective at reestablishing overstory characteristics more similar to those of 
the late 1800s. Further monitoring of understory changes is needed. The treatment 
also reduced fuel hazard and conserved large, old pinyon and juniper trees. The 
permanent plots established will allow further assessment of ecosystem recovery 
and assist in the adaptive management process.
