Abstract
Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) forests in northern Arizona have degraded due to overgrazing, logging,
and ﬁre suppression that accompanied Euro-American settlement in the late 1800s. Overstocked stands of suppressed trees with
low structural diversity dominate the landscape. These conditions create high risk of catastrophic ﬁres and insect outbreaks. We
investigated long-term effects (8–16 years post-treatment) of thinning and thinning + prescribed burning on ponderosa pine
water stress, leaf carbon isotope discrimination and nitrogen concentration, oleoresin exudation ﬂow, phloem thickness, radial
growth, and bark beetle abundance relative to unmanaged control stands over 2 years of measurement in 12 stands replicated
across the landscape. Predawn water potential in late June, phloem thickness, and basal area increment were lower in unmanaged
than managed stands. Oleoresin exudation ﬂow in July was greater in unmanaged and thinned + burned stands than thinned
stands, and greater in a warm year than a cooler year. Leaf nitrogen concentration differed between years, but not among
treatments. Tree competition and water stress were positively correlated, and tree competition was negatively correlated with
radial growth and phloem thickness. Pheromone-baited trap catches of Dendroctonus spp. (D. brevicomis Leconte pooled with
D. frontalis Zimmerman) were higher in unmanaged than managed stands, whereas catches of Ips spp. did not differ among
treatments. We conclude that thinning with and without prescribed burning can have long-term effects on ponderosa pine water
stress, growth, phloem thickness, resin ﬂow, and bark beetle abundance. Low levels of tree mortality from bark beetles at our
study sites suggest remarkable resistance of ponderosa pine in mid-elevation forests in northern Arizona, even at high tree
densities.

tree density that have occurred since Euro-American
settlement in the late 1800s (Covington et al., 1997;
Dahms and Geils, 1997; Allen et al., 2002). Current,
undesirable conditions include overstocked stands of
suppressed trees, high fuel loads, low understory
diversity, and homogeneity of tree size and age classes
(Covington and Moore, 1994a; Covington et al., 1997;
Stone et al., 1999). With these conditions come high
risk of epidemic insect outbreaks and catastrophic
wildﬁre (Olsen et al., 1996; Feeney et al., 1998; Kolb
et al., 1998; Fule´ et al., 2001; Sanchez-Martinez and
Wagner, 2002). The current state of the Arizona
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.)
forest is a result of overgrazing, logging, and ﬁre
suppression that accompanied Euro-American settle-
ment, in addition to favorable conditions for tree
establishment in the early 20th century (Cooper, 1960;
Covington and Moore, 1994b; Savage et al., 1996).
These factors promoted a pulse of tree regeneration
resulting in an almost even-aged cohort of trees
growing at high density across the landscape (Savage
et al., 1996).
Managers
and
researchers
have
implemented
thinning
and
prescribed
burning
treatments
to
decrease risk of wildﬁres and improve ponderosa
pine forest condition in northern Arizona. Thinning of
these forests is effective in increasing individual tree
growth (Ronco et al., 1985; Feeney et al., 1998; Skov
et al., 2005), decreasing tree water stress (Kolb et al.,
1998; Skov et al., 2004; Wallin et al., 2004), increasing
tree defense against bark beetles through increased
resin production (Kolb et al., 1998), and increasing
leaf nitrogen concentration and hence photosynthetic
capacity in some cases (Feeney et al., 1998; Wallin
et al., 2004). The few long-term studies of prescribed
burning in Arizona ponderosa pine forests suggest that
frequent burning can impact tree nitrogen and water
relations, and growth. For example, Wallin et al.
(2004) reported higher predawn water potentials of
old-growth ponderosa pine in thinned plots burned
twice at 4-year intervals compared to thinned-only
plots and decreased leaf nitrogen concentration in
thinned + burned plots compared to thinned-only
plots. Similarly, Wright and Hart (1997) found that
repeated burning over 20 years depleted soil nitrogen
in a ponderosa pine stand. Peterson et al. (1994)
reported that prescribed burning at 4–6-year intervals
increased ponderosa pine growth rate compared with
longer or shorter burn intervals. In contrast to these
ﬁndings in Arizona, ponderosa pines in thinned and
thinned + burned treatments in western Montana had
similar physiological characteristics 8 and 9 years
after treatment (Sala et al., 2005).
Bark beetle populations in northern Arizona region
were endemic prior to 2002 for almost a century
(Sanchez-Martinez and Wagner, 2002). However,
mortality of ponderosa pine from drought and bark
beetles in this region increased dramatically between
2000 and 2003 (http://www.fs.fed.us/r3/resources/
health/beetle/index.shtml). Biotic and abiotic stresses
such as high inter-tree competition, defoliation,
drought, lightning strikes, and ﬁre damage are thought
to inﬂuence tree susceptibility to bark beetle attack
(Berryman, 1976; Christiansen et al., 1987; Ruel et al.,
1998; Bradley and Tueller, 2001; Wallin et al., 2003).
Thinned stands of several pine species have been
reported to be less susceptible to tree-killing bark
beetles (e.g., Sartwell and Stevens, 1975; Mitchell
et al., 1983; Brown et al., 1987; Amman et al., 1988;
Schowalter and Turchin, 1993). Research in northern
Arizona
has
suggested
greater
ponderosa
pine
resistance to bark beetles, based on higher resin ﬂow,
in thinned or thinned + burned stands compared to
unthinned stands (Feeney et al., 1998; Kolb et al.,
1998; Wallin et al., 2004). Higher resin ﬂow in thinned
stands may result from greater tree resource uptake
and greater carbon allocation to constituitive, or
preformed resin, and increased resin ﬂow has been
associated with an induced resin synthesis response to
stem tissue damage from ﬁre or physical wounding, or
inoculation by blue stain fungi (Feeney et al., 1998;
Ruel et al., 1998; Klepzig et al., 2005). In contrast,
severe defoliation because of crown scorch during ﬁre
decreases
ponderosa
pine
resin
production
and
increases bark beetle attacks and success (Wallin
et al., 2003). In loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.)
moderate water stress has been shown to increase
carbon allocation to resin production (Lorio, 1986;
Lorio et al., 1995; Reeve et al., 1995), but the inﬂuence
of water stress on resin defenses of other pines is
poorly understood.
Our objectives were to compare ponderosa pine
water and carbon relations, growth, resin defenses, and
bark beetle occurrence among different forest condi-
tions produced by silvicultural treatments in northern
Arizona. The conditions are unmanaged stands, stands

thinned 8–16 years ago, and similarly thinned stands
that were broadcast burned after thinning. Our study is
unique in addressing longer-term impacts of opera-
tional silvicultural treatments on tree physiological
characteristics, growth, and bark beetle occurrence in
ponderosa pine forests with treatment stands repli-
cated across a large landscape.
2. Methods
2.1. Study area
We randomly selected a subset of four stands in each
of three stand conditions from a group of 44 research
sites in the Coconino National Forest near Flagstaff,
Arizona (Fig. 1). Research sites are part of the Stand
Treatment Impacts on Forest Health (STIFH) study to
assess impacts of past operational forest management
on ponderosa pine forest condition in northern Arizona
(Bailey et al., 2001). STIFH sites cover a range of
disturbance intensities from unmanaged controls to
areasburnedbystand-replacingﬁre.Ourstudyincluded
stands in unmanaged (UN), thinned (TH), and thinned
and broadcast burned (TB) treatments. The size of
selected stands ranged between 50 and 180 ha. The UN
treatment consists of dense stands with greater than
90% crown closure that have not been treated by
thinning or prescribed burning in the last 30 years. The
TH treatment consists of stands thinned to remove
greater than 30% of basal area between 1988 and 1995.
The percent of basal area removed in the TH stands
ranged between 32 and 59% and averaged 40%. TB
stands had similar thinning (percent basal area removal
between 33 and 70%, mean of 57%) and were followed
by a broadcast burn of scattered logging slash and
naturally occurring ground fuels within 8 years.
Thinnings in both TH and TB stands were even-spaced
improvement thinnings from below to reach a target
basal area of about 17 m2/ha. Density of mature,
presettlement trees (dbh > 54 cm) in all stands is
currently low (less than 10 trees/ha).
We used four stands of each treatment and treated
them as replicates. There is variation in the dates of
thinning and burning among stands within a treatment
(Table 1) and stand attributes such as basal area
(Table 2). For example, year of thinning varied by 4
years among stands for both the TH and TB treatments
and year of ﬁrst burning varied by 7 years (Table 1).
The average and range in basal area (BA) among
stands were lowest in the TB treatment, intermediate
in the TH treatment, and highest in the UN treatment
(Table 2). This variation was acceptable in our study
because it represents the variation that occurs within
stand treatment groups across the landscape.
Soils on all 12 stands are basalt-derived, mainly
Typic Argiborolls, Typic Eutroboralfs, and Mollic
Eutroboralfs composed of ﬁne, smectitic residiums of
basalt cinders, and clayey—skeletal and loamy skeletal
composites
(Miller
et
al.,
1995).
Mean
annual
precipitation for this region is 57 cm, most of which
comes from winter snow and late summer rain (Western
Regional Climatic Center; http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/
index.html). Elevation across all stands ranges from
2160 to 2440 m.
2.2. Measurement trees
At each of the 12 stands, we selected 10 trees for
physiological measurements (n = 120). Out of 10 plots

laid out in a systematic grid (Bailey et al., 2001), we
chose four plots nearest to the center of each stand
and selected two or three trees per plot. Plots were
located 150 or 200 m apart. We selected the ﬁrst
two or three trees per plot located east of the
plot center with a dbh between 27 and 33 cm.
We chose the largest tree dbh that was common
across all treatments because Dendroctonus brevi-
comis LeConte prefers larger trees (Olsen et al.,
1996). Trees with dwarf mistletoe or obvious
physical or insect damage were excluded.
2.3. Predawn water potential
We measured leaf predawn water potential (Cp)
during the driest season to compare tree water stress
among treatments. Measurements were made during
the last week of June in 2003 and 2004 at the end of
the spring–early summer dry period that typically
occurs in the Southwestern U.S. In each year, we
measured Cp at all 12 stands over 5 consecutive
days. To compensate for potential differences among
sample dates, one stand of each treatment was
measured within a 2-day period. Data were obtained
by two separate crews that received identical training
and used identical procedures. Each crew obtained
data from two of the four stands per treatment in
each year. Weather conditions were dry each year
throughout the measurement period. We sampled 10
trees per stand prior to sunrise (about 05:00 h). We
used pole pruners to remove one branch per tree from
the mid-canopy (6–14 m above ground, depending
on tree height) to obtain several fascicles of 1-year-
old needles, which were sealed in a plastic bag with a
slightly damp paper towel and stored in a dark cooler
on ice. We then transported the samples to the lab
and measured Cp with a pressure chamber (Model
1000, PMS Instruments, Corvallis, OR) within 2 h
after removal from the tree. This procedure of
measuring Cp produces similar values to those
obtained by measurements immediately after needle
excision from the tree (Kaufmann and Thor, 1982),
and has been used in several studies of ponderosa
pine (Feeney et al., 1998; Kolb et al., 1998; Skov
et al., 2004). We measured Cp of several needles of
each tree and averaged the ﬁrst three values that were
within 0.1 MPa of each other as the mean for the tree.
2.4. Foliar carbon isotope discrimination and
nitrogen concentration
We sampled leaves for measurement of leaf carbon
isotope discrimination (d13C) and nitrogen concentra-
tion (N) during the ﬁrst week in September of 2003
and 2004 following full needle development. Leaf
d13C is a measure of leaf internal CO2 concentration
and the balance between uptake of CO2 in photo-
synthesis and supply via stomatal conductance during
assimilation of carbon used for leaf construction
(Farquhar and Lloyd, 1993; Pate, 2001). 13C-enriched
leaf tissue suggests that development occurred under
conditions that reduced leaf internal CO2 concentra-
tion and stomatal conductance, such as water stress
(Farquhar and Lloyd, 1993; Pate, 2001). Leaf N is an
indicator of photosynthetic capacity and levels of the
carboxylating enzyme Rubisco (Field and Mooney,
1986).
To obtain samples we removed branch-tips using
pole pruners from fully sunlit portion of the upper
third of the canopy (9–18 m above ground, depending
on tree height) and collected three to four fascicles of
green needles formed in the current year. Needles were
transported to the lab in a cooler and then oven dried at
70 8C for 48 h. Once dry, whole-tissue samples were
ground using a Wiley Mill (3383-L10 series, Thomas
Scientiﬁc, Swedesboro, NJ) to 40 mesh. Ground
samples were oven dried again at 70 8C for 24 h to
remove any residual moisture, placed in a dessicator,
and weighed following sample preparation guidelines
of the Colorado Plateau Stable Isotope Laboratory at
Northern Arizona University (http://www4.nau.edu/
cpsil). Samples were analyzed by this laboratory for
d13C and N with an Elemental Analyzer-Continuous
Flow Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (Finnigan
Deltaplus Advantage).
2.5. Oleoresin exudation ﬂow
We measured oleoresin exudation ﬂow (OEF)
following phloem wounding in July of 2003 and 2004.
We chose July to coincide with bark beetle ﬂights. We
measured OEF on the same trees used for Cp, d13C,
and N measurements. We created a ﬂat surface on the
tree bark using a draw knife and drove a 2.54 cm
diameter Osborne arch punch (Model 149, King
Bearing Co., Flagstaff, AZ) through the bark, phloem,
G.L. Zausen et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 218 (2005) 291–305
295

and cambium to the xylem surface without wounding
the xylem (Lorio et al., 1990). Two wounds were made
on opposite sides of each tree at 1.3 m above ground.
We funneled resin into vials using aluminum funnels
in 2003 and using silicon caulking in 2004 and
measured resin volume after 24 h. We measured
phloem thickness from the portion extracted during
wounding using a digital micrometer. Phloem thick-
ness was measured at three locations 1208 apart
around the circumference of the extracted portion, and
averaged for each tree.
2.6. Tree growth
We calculated basal area increment (BAI) of all
trees using the most recent 5 years of growth (years
2000–2004). We took two xylem cores at breast height
from opposite sides of each tree in November 2004
using an increment borer. Once dry, the cores were
mounted and sanded using standard procedures
(Stokes and Smiley, 1968). We measured ring
widths to the nearest 0.01 mm using a Microcode II
measuring banister system (Boeckler Instruments,
Tucson, AZ) connected to a digital output system.
Care was taken to cross-date measurements because
2002 was often a missing ring due to a severe drought
that year. Average yearly growth increments were
converted into average yearly BAI based on dbh of
previous years estimated from growth increments and
assuming no change in bark thickness over the 5-year
period (Avery and Burkhart, 1983). BAI was averaged
over the two cores for each tree.
2.7. Competition index
To evaluate the competitive status of trees used for
physiology measurements we used the diameter-
distance competition index (CI) described by Lorimer
(1983). CI was calculated based on the sum of ratios of
the diameters at breast height of each ith subject tree
and its jth neighboring trees, weighted by the distances
between the i and j trees:
CI ¼
X
n
j¼1
 ðdbh j=dbhiÞ
distancesi j

All trees within 40 times the dbh of the subject tree
(e.g., for a 0.3 m dbh tree, competition radius = 12 m)
were considered competitors (Sutherland et al., 1991).
We measured distance of each competing tree within
the competition radius using a digital hypsometer
(Vertex III and transponder T3, HAGLO¨ F Sweden
AB) and recorded dbh. We also estimated local basal
area (BA) around each measurement tree using a 10-
factor basal area prism (Shiver and Borders, 1996)
with the subject tree as the center of the variable–
radius plot.
2.8. Bark beetle abundance
We installed four 12-unit Lindgren funnel traps
(Phero Tech., Delta, BC, Canada) at each stand
(n = 48) and baited two with a D. brevicomis lure
(composed of frontalin, exobrevicomin, and myrcene
terpenes) and two with an Ips pini lure (Ipsdienol +3/
97 and lanierone) (Phero Tech., Delta, BC, Canada).
We placed each trap in a different quadrant within
each stand. We hung funnel traps one meter above
ground from a bent 2 cm metal conduit anchored with
rebar stakes in the center of each quadrant, at least
50 m from any measurement trees and at least 200 m
away from other traps. Pest strips were placed in
collection buckets to kill all trapped insects and
eliminate bark beetle predation. Traps were baited in
June or early July and monitored for 4 or 5 weeks in
2003 and 2004. The trapping periods overlapped with
the Cp and OEF measurements so we could quantify
tree resistance during the trapping periods. Trap
buckets were emptied weekly and bark beetles were
counted and identiﬁed in the lab.
Our target species for the D. brevicomis lure was D.
brevicomis, but we expected to also capture D.
frontalis Zimmermann with this lure as has been
reported
in
other
studies
in
northern
Arizona
(Sanchez-Martinez
and
Wagner,
2002;
Gaylord
et al., in press). In northern Arizona, D. brevicomis
and D. frontalis have similar ﬂight times, numbers of
ﬂights, and attractiveness to chemical attractants
(Sanchez-Martinez
and
Wagner,
2002;
Gaylord
et al., in press), and both species can co-occur in
the same bole section of ponderosa pine (Breece and
Kolb, unpublished). The D. brevicomis lure, we used is
more attractive to D. frontalis in northern Arizona than
the commercially available lure for D. frontalis
containing only frontalin (Gaylord et al., in press).
For insects captured with the D. brevicomis lure, we
G.L. Zausen et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 218 (2005) 291–305
296

counted the number of D. brevicomis and D. frontalis
pooled over species, and refer to these captures as
Dendroctonus spp. Our target species for the I. pini
lure was I. pini Say, but we expected to also capture
other Ips species, such as I. latidens LeConte and I.
lecontei Swaine, based on previous studies in northern
Arizona with the I. pini lure containing Ipsdienol +3/
97 and lanierone (Gaylord et al., in press). For
insects captured with the I. pini lure, we counted the
number of all Ips beetles pooled over species and refer
to these captures as Ips spp.
2.9. Stand level tree mortality
During the fall of 2004, we assessed recent tree
mortality at all stands. All trees on 10, 20 m  20 m
permanent plots systematically located in each stand
were observed (N = 2322 trees over all stands) and
mortality associated with bark beetles was noted. Tree
death was associated with bark beetles, if there was
evidence of bark beetle infestation such as pitch tubes,
frass, or ﬂaking of bark by woodpeckers.
2.10. Statistical analysis
Stand means (n = 4 per treatment) were used as
the experimental unit and were compared among
treatments using analysis of variance (ANOVA or
MANOVA). We analyzed all tree physiological
parameters measured in 2003 and 2004 using a
repeated measures MANOVA design. Sources of
variation in the MANOVA were treatment (d.f. = 2),
year (d.f. = 1), and the year  treatment interaction
(d.f. = 2). We analyzed the total number of captures of
each bark beetle genera (Dendroctonus, Ips) pooled
over collection dates in each year using one-way
ANOVA with treatment as a factor. Normality and
equal variance assumptions for bark beetle abundance
data were not met, but nonparametric data analysis and
ANOVA on transformed data resulted in similar
results and p-values, thus we present the results of the
non-transformed data. Tree BAI, CI, phloem thick-
ness, and mortality were analyzed using one-way
ANOVA with treatment as a factor followed by
Tukey–Kramer HSD mean comparisons. We used
correlation analysis to identify relationships between
tree physiological and growth characteristics and
competition. The threshold p-value for statistical
signiﬁcance was 0.05, and all analyses were conducted
with JMP 5 (SAS Institute Inc., 2002).

( p = 0.002) for trees in UN stands than TH stands
(Fig. 4). OEF in TB stands was similar to OEF in UN

( p = 0.02). OEF was lower in 2004 compared to 2003
for all treatments (Fig. 4).
3.2. Tree growth and phloem thickness
Mean BAI was signiﬁcantly ( p = 0.007) greater in
TB than UN stands. BAIofTH stands was intermediate,
and did not differ signiﬁcantly from BAI of the other
two treatments (Fig. 5). Similarly, phloem thickness
was signiﬁcantly ( p = 0.037) greater in TB than UN
stands, and phloem thickness for TH stands did not
differ from the other two treatments (Fig. 6).

was signiﬁcantly ( p = 0.0007) greater than TH and TB
stands (Table 2). Stand-mean basal area was nega-

We also examined relationships between tree

with individual-tree data pooled over all treatments
(Table 3). Overall, relationships for individual-tree
data were similar to relationships for stand-level data
(Fig. 7). Signiﬁcant relationships occurred between CI

(r = 0.52), CI and phloem thickness (r = 0.49), and
phloem thickness and leaf N (r = 0.24). CI and Cp
were negatively correlated in both years (r = 0.51 for
2003, r = 0.39 for 2004), whereas phloem thickness

(r = 0.36 for 2003, r = 0.30 for 2004).

Fig. 8. Mean weekly abundance of Dendroctonus spp. in July 2003 (a) and June–July 2004 (b), and Ips spp. in June–July 2003 (c) for unmanaged
(UN), thinned (TH), and thinned + broadcast burned (TB) stands. The bars show 1 S.E. Each point represents the average capture from eight
pheromone-baited traps (two per each of four stands). Abundance of Dendroctonus spp. totaled over dates in 2003 was greater in UN compared to
TH stands (ANOVA, p = 0.04). Total abundance of Dendroctonus spp. in 2004 and Ips spp. in 2003 and 2004 did not differ among treatments
( p > 0.05). Ips spp. abundance in 2004 is not shown because few beetles were caught in all treatments.

3.4. Bark beetle abundance
In 2003 catches of Dendroctonus spp. were higher
( p = 0.04) in UN than TH stands (Fig. 8a). Catches
in TB stands were intermediate and did not differ
signiﬁcantly from the other treatments. Average
catches of Dendroctonus spp. over all dates in 2004
did not differ signiﬁcantly among treatments (Fig. 8b),
although catches were highest in UN stands in July
when captures increased across all treatments. Ips spp.
catches did not differ among treatments in 2003
(Fig. 8c) or 2004 (data not shown due to low numbers
of beetles).
3.5. Stand level tree mortality
Tree mortality associated with bark beetles was low
in all stands and did not differ among treatments
( p = 0.78). Less than 0.1% of all trees surveyed
(n = 2322) in each treatment had died recently.
4. Discussion
Thinning stands to lower tree densities (with and
without ensuing prescribed ﬁre treatments) decreased
ponderosa pine water stress as indicated by higher Cp
during the peak of the dry season (late June) 8–16
years after thinning and 3–10 years after the most
recent prescribed burn, compared with unmanaged
stands in northern Arizona. Similar ﬁndings have been
reported previously in northern Arizona (Feeney et al.,
1998; Kolb et al., 1998; Skov et al., 2004) and western
Montana (Sala et al., 2005). These results can be
attributed to increased water availability to trees
resulting from decreased tree competition in thinned
stands. In 2004, greater tree water stress in UN stands
persisted throughout the period of leaf development
(May–July), based on the UN stands having the
highest leaf d13C of all stands. Leaf d13C can vary due
to factors that change leaf internal CO2 concentration,
such as a change in the balance between uptake via
photosynthesis and supply via stomatal conductance
(Farquhar and Lloyd, 1993; Pate, 2001). Maximum
photosynthetic capacity was likely similar among
treatments in our study, as evidenced by similar leaf N
(Field and Mooney, 1986). The most likely explana-
tion for higher d13C in UN stands is lower leaf internal
CO2 caused by reduction of stomatal aperture in
response to water stress during leaf development.
Contrary to our expectation, thinning decreased
resin ﬂow. OEF in July was greatest in UN stands,
intermediate in TB stands, and least in TH stands. This
result is the opposite of a previous report of greater
ponderosa pine OEF in thinned compared with
unthinned stands in northern Arizona (Kolb et al.,
1998). The difference between our results and Kolb
et al. (1998) may be due to the standardization of tree
dbh to 27–33 cm across all treatments and the shorter
duration and lower intensity of thinnings in our study.
In Kolb et al. (1998), an initial heavy thinning in 1962
followed by additional thinnings every decade over 35
years to maintain constant stand basal area created
large differences in tree growth rate and dbh; OEF was
negatively related to stand basal area between 6.9 and
78.2 m2/ha, and positively related to differences in dbh
among stands between 10.7 and 40.9 cm. In contrast,
the management treatments in our study created stands
with a lower range in basal area (8.7–20.6 m2/ha based
on measurements around study trees), and the
thinnings were conducted only once in each stand
8–16 years prior to our measurements. Our results and
Kolb et al. (1998) suggest that effects of thinning on
OEF of ponderosa pine in northern Arizona cannot be
generalized without consideration of tree size and the
intensity and duration of thinnings.
Our
results
are
consistent
with
the
growth
differentiation–balance hypothesis, which predicts
that trees allocate more carbon for growth under
optimum conditions, but more carbon for defense,
e.g., resin synthesis, under moderately stressful
conditions such as seasonal water deﬁcits that limit
growth (Lorio and Sommers, 1986; Lorio et al., 1990).
Our Cp results show that trees in UN stands were under
greater water stress just prior to measurement of OEF.
Trees in UN stands also had less diameter growth than
trees in managed stands. Decreased Cp and BAI in UN
compared to managed stands, yet greater OEF in UN
stands, supports the hypothesis of greater carbon
allocation to secondary metabolic processes rather
than growth under stressed conditions such as those
produced by heavy competition in unmanaged stands
of ponderosa pine in northern Arizona. A similar
tradeoff between growth and oleoresin production was
reported for ponderosa pine in northern Arizona for 2
years that differed in water stress (Feeney et al., 1998).

Prescribed burning increased OEF in thinned
stands. A similar result for OEF measured in late
June was reported for old-growth ponderosa pines 2, 3,
and 7 years after implementation of restoration
treatments in northern Arizona (Feeney et al., 1998;
Wallin et al., 2004). The difference in OEF between
TB and TH stands in our study was not clearly related
to tree competition, as correlations between OEF and
various measures of tree competition and physiolo-
gical status were low for stand-level and individual-
tree data (e.g., Table 3). The mechanism by which
prescribed ﬁre stimulates constituitive resin defenses
in ponderosa pine is not known, but may involve an
increase of resin production in response to wounding
of the cambium or phloem (e.g., Ruel et al., 1998), or
greater rates of resin ﬂow in response to higher bole
temperature (e.g., Ruel et al., 1998) associated with
lower tree density in burned stands. The latter
explanation is supported in our study by lower basal
area and competition index for trees in TB than TH
stands (Table 2).
OEF in July was less in 2004 than 2003 for all
treatments. Differences in temperature between years
may have affected resin viscosity and ﬂow rate, as OEF
is known to be positively associated with temperature
during short-term measurements (Ruel et al., 1998).
July mean air temperature at a weather station located
near our study sites (Fort Valley, Arizona, http://
cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/ancsum) was 1.2 8C lower in 2004
(17.4 8C) when resin ﬂow was low, than in 2003
(18.6 8C) when resin ﬂow was higher.
Phloem thickness, a measure of food resources
to bark beetles (Amman and Pasek, 1986), was
inﬂuenced by forest management treatments. Phloem
thickness was positively and strongly correlated with
BAI (Fig. 7d), indicating that faster growing trees had
thicker phloem than slower growing trees of the same
dbh. Similar results were reported for lodgepole pine
in British Columbia, Canada (Shrimpton and Thom-
son, 1985). This relationship could have important
management implications regarding tree suitability
for bark beetles. Managed stands may have a higher
percentage of suitable host trees due to increased
phloem thickness because thinning stimulates radial
growth.
The effects of prescribed ﬁre on tree growth in our
study were negligible or indistinguishable from effects
of thinning. Our regression analyses (Fig. 7; Table 3)
strongly suggest that differences in tree growth among
stand treatments can be largely explained by effects of
thinning on tree competitive status. Sutherland et al.
(1991) reported an initial decrease in ponderosa pine
growth for 2 years after a prescribed burn followed by
a return to growth rates similar to control trees. Such
short-term effects may have occurred following the
prescribed burns in our study, but were not detected in
our measurements 3–10 years after the last burn
treatment.
Past forest management inﬂuenced abundance of
Dendroctonus spp. (D. brevicomis pooled with D.
frontalis) as measured by pheromone-mediated trap
catches. We trapped high numbers of these beetles in
all stands in July 2003, and catches were greater in UN
than managed stands. In 2004, this same trend
occurred in late July as abundance of Dendroctonus
spp. increased. Sanchez-Martinez and Wagner (2002)
used pheromone-baited traps to attract these beetles in
the same stands in 1999 and found no differences in
abundance among stands. Total trap catches in 1999
reported by Sanchez-Martinez and Wagner (2002)
were much lower than our totals for 2003 and 2004
suggesting that there was an increase in populations of
Dendroctonus spp. in these stands prior to our study.
During our trapping periods, bark beetles in UN stands
may have been ﬂying more than populations in
managed stands. This explanation is unlikely because
emergence of tree-killing bark beetles is often
synchronized for populations in the same region
(Berryman, 1982).
A possible explanation for greater capture of
Dendroctonus spp. in unthinned than thinned stands is
that the pheromone plume was more concentrated in
unthinned stands because of lower windspeed and less
mixing of the pheromone plume (Thistle et al., 2004).
A more concentrated pheromone plume with greater
directional consistency may be more favorable for
long-range detection of pheromones by bark beetles.
Also, Dendroctonus spp. may prefer unthinned stands
because higher tree density provides greater avail-
ability of hosts at shorter ﬂying distances. Moreover,
habitat suitability may be better in dense, unthinned
stands due to decreased bark temperature (Schmid
et al., 1991).
In contrast to Dendroctonus spp., past forest
management did not inﬂuence trap catches of Ips
spp. Sanchez-Martinez and Wagner (2002) reported
G.L. Zausen et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 218 (2005) 291–305
302

similar results for I. pini in these stands in 1999. In
2004 catches of Ips spp. from June 17–July 20 were
near zero in all treatments. This result may indicate
emigration of the local population or that this genus
was not ﬂying during the trapping period. We
conclude that Ips spp. shows no speciﬁc preference
for the range of stand conditions included in our study.
We were surprised to ﬁnd that bark beetle impact on
tree mortality at our 12 study sites on the Coconino
National Forest was minimal during our study
considering the widespread reports of ponderosa pine
mortality from bark beetles in this region between
2000 and 2003 (http://www.fs.fed.us/r3/resources/
health/beetle/index.shtml). Ponderosa pine forests
located near the lower extent of their elevational
range in Arizona (2000 m) appear to have been
impacted more by the 2002 drought and bark beetle
outbreak than our study sites at higher elevations
(2160–2440 m). Because we observed little mortality
from bark beetles in our study stands, our trap catch
results cannot be interpreted as abundance at outbreak
levels of beetles that cause high tree mortality.
Our study is the ﬁrst in northern Arizona to assess
long-term responses of both bark beetles and host–tree
physiology and resin defenses to operational forest
treatments across the landscape using replicated
stands. We conclude that thinning treatments that
remove 30–50% of stand basal area, with or without
prescribed ﬁre, decrease water stress of dominant and
co-dominant ponderosa pines 27–33 cm dbh during
the dry season 8–16 years after treatment. Treatment
differences in tree water stress likely develop earlier
based on previous research and may persist for many
years. Contrary to our expectation, lower tree water
stress in thinned stands was associated with lower
constituitive resin defenses of ponderosa pine against
bark beetles. Food resources available to bark beetles
on a per tree basis were greater in managed stands
because thinning increased phloem thickness, yet
populations of Dendronctonus spp. were lower in
managed than unmanaged stands. Despite these
effects of stand management on bark beetles and
host tree physiology, negligible tree mortality in all
stand conditions after several years of drought suggest
remarkable resistance of ponderosa pine to bark
beetles in mid-elevation stands in the Coconino
National Forest, or other unknown factors that limit
bark beetle success.
