01/26/2002 
Congress has appropriated $2.38 million to the Ecological Restoration Institute at 
Northern Arizona University for research and restorative treatments.  
Projects that will receive funding include those at Mount Trumbull on the North Rim of 
the Grand Canyon where the land was heavily grazed in the late 1800s; fire regime 
research in the mixed conifer on the San Francisco Peaks; urban wildland interface 
treatments near mountain communities such as Springerville; and presettlement forest 
structure research on historic plots in northern New Mexico and Arizona.  
Some of the money will also be used to study the pinion-juniper ecosystems of the West.  
ERI Director W. Wallace Covington credits Sen. Jon Kyl's dedication to conservation for 
the funding.  
"Sen. Kyl's support is fundamental to getting scientifically and socially responsible 
restoration implemented," said Covington.  
Following a meeting this week with Sen. Kyl in Washington D.C., NAU President John 
Haeger said, "It is incredibly satisfying to see that the important work of the ERI is 
acknowledged, understood and supported by our elected officials.
