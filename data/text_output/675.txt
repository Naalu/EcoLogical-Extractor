gradient, Grand Canyon National Park, USA

Summary
1. Restoration of wildland ﬁre to forests is a challenge when historical ﬁre regimes
have been altered. We studied four ﬁres that burned over approximately 7865 ha on
an altitudinal gradient in Grand Canyon National Park, USA, in 2003. The ﬁres met
criteria for the current USA policy allowing the restoration of ﬁre’s ecological role in
forest landscapes: Wildland Fire Use for Resource Beneﬁts.
2. After the ﬁres burned out, we remeasured 82 permanent pre-established monitoring
plots burned by the ﬁres plus 43 additional plots on unburned companion sites.
3. The maximum height of charring of tree boles and basal area mortality increased
in mean value and variability with altitude. At a low-altitude Pinus–Quercus site, tree
density declined signiﬁcantly but basal area was unchanged. At a mid-altitude mixed-
conifer site and a high-altitude Picea/Abies/Populus site, both density and basal area
declined.
4. The thinning effect of ﬁre was concentrated on smaller, shorter, ﬁre-susceptible trees.
Small-diameter trees (< 20 cm diameter) made up 79–95% of all tree mortality. Shade-
tolerant conifers, particularly true ﬁrs and spruce, experienced disproportionate
mortality (31–82% basal area decline), while ﬁre-resistant ponderosa pine and Douglas
ﬁr tended to survive (2–8% basal area decline). Delayed mortality between the ﬁrst
and second years following the ﬁres accounted for only 4·2% of trees dying at the
low-altitude site but 15·6% and 11·2% at the mid- and high-altitude sites, respectively.
Regeneration density was highly variable but forest ﬂoor and woody debris declined in
burned areas.
5. Synthesis and applications. This study shows that, even after an unusually long
ﬁre-free period (1880–2003), at the mid- and high-altitude burned sites ﬁre effects were
consistent with restoration of historical patterns, moving the ecosystems closer to
historical reference conditions. Fires simultaneously reduced the living, dead and
ladder fuels that made the forest vulnerable to uncharacteristically severe ﬁre. These
effects make the forests more resistant to the expected increases in ﬁre size and severity
under future climate conditions. Even at longer-than-historical ﬁre intervals, the wildland
ﬁre use policy can beneﬁt Grand Canyon forests.

Introduction
Recognition that ﬁre plays an important ecological
role in south-western forests of the USA goes back
over three-quarters of a century (Leopold 1924) but
accomplishing even a limited reintroduction of ﬁre has
proved challenging (Parsons 2000; Miller & Parsons
2004). The USA policy of wildland ﬁre use (WFU) for
resource beneﬁts gives managers ﬂexibility in respond-
ing to naturally ignited wildﬁres (Miller 2003; Stephens
& Ruth 2005). Wildland ﬁres that meet predeﬁned
criteria can be used to accomplish goals such as fuel
reduction, reintroduction of historical ﬁre patterns

and restoration of ﬁre-maintained patterns of species
composition and forest structure (Dale 2006).
The difference between current and historical ﬁre
patterns has been central to assessing the impact of changes
associated with ﬁre exclusion and other human-caused
disturbances. Examples include the USA-wide pro-
gramme of coarse-scale fuel mapping for developing
the Fire Regime Condition Class assessment (FRCC;
Schmidt et al. 2002) and a ﬁner-scale method in
California called the Fire Regime Interval Departure
(FRID; Caprio & Graber 2000). These approaches
compare modern ﬁre recurrence with a reference
condition of historical ﬁre frequency prior to European
settlement. Areas with a high departure, particularly
those where ﬁres historically burned mostly with low
severity, are considered to be at high risk of ‘losing key
ecosystem components’ (Schmidt et al. 2002).
A key problem with assessments based on ﬁre fre-
quency comparisons is that the great majority of USA
forests have dim prospects for regaining anything close
to historical ﬁre frequency under modern constraints
(Brown et al. 1994). In a nation-wide review, Parsons
(2000) noted that even for the agencies most disposed
to ﬁre use (National Park Service, Forest Service),
in wilderness settings where ﬁre use may be least con-
strained and in ecosystems where ﬁre might be most
easily managed because of historical low- or mixed-
severity ﬁre regimes, the application of WFU or the
previous policy of ‘prescribed natural ﬁre’ was orders
of magnitude below a level that would emulate historical
ﬁre regimes. Rollins, Swetnam & Morgan (2001) calcu-
lated modern ﬁre return intervals of > 100–200 years
based on approximately two decades of ﬁre use in
wilderness areas in Montana and New Mexico. Miller
& Parsons (2004) found that fragmentation of wildlands
limited the importation of ﬁres from distant ignitions,
reducing even the theoretical possibility of fully restoring
natural ﬁre. Parsons (2000) underscored the dilemma
between the consequences of continued minimal ﬁre use
vs. active intervention to supplement natural ignitions
with prescribed ﬁres and/or mechanical treatments.
At least in preserves and remote landscapes, active
intervention raises many social and ecological concerns.
We suggest another option: the actual effects of spe-
ciﬁc wildland ﬁres may, in some circumstances, be more
important than the frequency of ﬁre recurrence. If ﬁres
that differed in spacing, season, intensity or other ways
from historical patterns nonetheless conserved or restored
ecosystem structures and processes within a natural
range of variability, then perhaps long-term management
goals might be achieved even under altered modern ﬁre
regimes. For example, Stephenson (1999) analysed the
relative importance of forest structure vs. ﬁre process
for restoration in Sequoiadendron giganteum–mixed
conifer forests. Miller & Urban (2000) used simulation
modelling to suggest that relatively infrequent but
severe ﬁres could restore mixed-conifer forests by
thinning dense stands of young, ﬁre-susceptible trees.
Keeley (2006) noted that longer-than-historical ﬁre
intervals might reduce the ability of exotic species to
capitalize on frequent disturbances.
In south-western Pinus ponderosa and mixed-conifer
forests, considered among the most negatively impacted
by ﬁre exclusion in North America (Allen et al. 2002;
Schmidt et al. 2002), there are several lines of evidence
to support the hypothesis that surface ﬁres can have
effects consistent with restoration and conservation
even at historically atypical intervals. First, frequent
ﬁres by themselves do not necessarily restore historical
characteristics. Three decades of controlled experi-
mentation with reintroduction of frequent surface ﬁre
have shown remarkably little effect in restoring histor-
ical forest structure, composition, productivity and
nutrient cycling (Peterson et al. 1994; Hart, Classen &
Wright 2005), leading people to look for alternatives
that include tree thinning and fuel treatments in
addition to ﬁre (Covington et al. 1997). Secondly, never-
harvested ‘relict’ forests in Arizona and Mexico that
continue to experience surface ﬁres, even at much
longer intervals than historical ﬁres, have maintained
open forests and a productive understorey, in contrast
to paired ﬁre-excluded forests (Stephens & Fulé 2005).
Thirdly, postﬁre studies of relict forest sites have
shown that native species dominate (Laughlin et al. 2004;
Huisinga et al. 2005; Laughlin, Bakker & Fulé 2005),
unlike forests where logging and grazing have left a
legacy of invasive exotics (Crawford et al. 2001; Korb,
Johnson & Covington 2003).
We tested the effects of ﬁre use on a landscape scale
over an altitude gradient after extensive WFU ﬁres
ignited by lightning in 2003 on the North Rim of
Grand Canyon National Park. The park conserves
the largest unharvested forest in Arizona, over 48 800 ha
(Warren et al. 1982), and has been a leader in ﬁre res-
toration since the 1980s. The 2003 WFU ﬁres burned
over 82 permanent plots, representing 1872 ha. We
remeasured these plots and companion unburned sites
after the ﬁres to ask: (i) how the WFU ﬁres varied in
severity over the altitudinal gradient; (ii) whether tree
structural (density, basal area, canopy cover, regener-
ation) and compositional changes were consistent with
conservation and restoration of historical reference
conditions; (iii) how forest ﬂoor fuels changed follow-
ing the ﬁres; and (iv) what the implications for future
management were.

The study area was on the North Rim of Grand
Canyon National Park, Arizona, USA. Weather records
were taken from the Western Regional Climate Center
(www.wrcc.dri.edu; accessed 17 March 2006). Average
annual precipitation at the North Rim ranger station
(altitude 2542 m) from 1948 to 2005 was 658 mm.
Average annual snowfall depth was 371 cm. The decade
1996–2005 averaged 91% of the long-term average

precipitation, but six of the 10 years were below average
and 2002, 1 year before the WFU ﬁres, was the driest
year in the records (excluding years with missing data).
Temperatures ranged from an average July maximum
of 25 °C to an average January minimum of −8·2 °C.
Soils were derived from limestone substrates (Warren
et al. 1982). Forests varied with altitude; scientiﬁc
names and codes are in Table 1 and species associations
are in Table 2.
Fire regimes were reconstructed from ﬁre-scarred
trees on the low- and mid-altitude study sites by
Fulé et al. (2003a, 2003b) and nearby by Wolf & Mast
(1998). Composite ﬁre return intervals through 1879
averaged 3·2–5·5 years (all ﬁres) and 6·4–9·2 years (ﬁre
dates in which 25% or more of the sample trees were
scarred; Fulé et al. 2003b). At the higher altitude study
site, Fulé et al. (2003a) used a combination of ﬁre scars,
tree age and species composition data to show that
these forests had a mixed-severity ﬁre regime. Fires
ceased after 1879 across much of the North Rim,
initially because of livestock introduction then because
of ﬁre suppression. The North Rim was fenced to
exclude livestock by 1938. No large ﬁres were recorded
on ﬁre scars or in park records at the mid- and high-
altitude sites after 1879, until the WFU ﬁres in 2003.
Both low-altitude sites, in contrast, had at least three large,
spreading surface ﬁres after 1879 (Fulé et al. 2003b).

From 1997 to 2001, we established permanent plots
covering an altitudinal gradient from c. 2200 m to c.
2700 m. Plot grids were spaced at 300 × 300 m below
2600 m altitude and 600 × 1200 m at higher altitudes,
where the landscape was characterized by a coarser-
grained ﬁre and stand pattern (Fulé et al. 2003a).
Sampling plots were 0·1 ha (20 × 50 m) in size. All plot
data were corrected for slope. Trees were tagged and
measurements included species, condition, diameter at
breast height (d.b.h.), height and crown base height.
Trees larger than 15 cm d.b.h. were measured on the
entire plot; trees between 2·5 and 15 cm d.b.h. were
measured on a 0·025-ha subplot. Trees smaller than
2·5 cm d.b.h. (regeneration) were tallied by species and
height class on a 50-m2 subplot. Along the 50-m side-
lines of the plot, canopy cover was recorded with a
vertical densitometer every 30 cm in preﬁre measure-
ments and every 3 m in 2001–04. Forest ﬂoor and
woody debris were measured along four 15·24-m
planar intersect transects (Brown 1974). Litter and duff
(fermentation + humus layers) depths were measured
every 1·52 m along each transect, and woody debris
was recorded by time-lag classes of 1 h (0–0·62 cm
diameter), 10 h (0·62–2·54 cm), 100 h (2·54–7·62 cm)
and 1000 h (> 7·62 cm). Time-lag classes, commonly
used in ﬁre behaviour applications, refer to the approx-
imate time required for fuels of these sizes to reach
two-thirds equilibrium with atmospheric moisture
content (Pyne, Andrews & Laven 1996). Fuel loadings
were calculated from the planar transect data (Brown
1974; Sackett 1980).
Eighty-two plots on the North Rim were burned
in 2003 (Table 1). In 2004, we remeasured all forest
attributes and added measurement of the height of

charring on the tree boles. Also in 2004, we remeasured
25 unburned plots at a low-altitude comparison site
and two unburned plots at a high-altitude comparison
site. Postﬁre mortality is often not evident in the ﬁrst
growing season following burning (McHugh & Kolb
2003). Therefore we returned in 2005 to remeasure
the condition of all tagged trees on the burned plots.
In 2005 we also completed remeasurement of the
remaining 16 unburned plots at the high-altitude
comparison site.

This research was an observational study taking advan-
tage of wildland ﬁres that burned across pre-existing
monitoring plots. The design was a before–after control–
impact (BACI) study (Eberhardt & Thomas 1991) for
the low- and high-altitude sites where we could measure
nearby unburned sites. At the mid-altitude site, only
before- and after-ﬁre data could be compared. The
scope of inference was limited to these particular sites
and ﬁres.
Forest structural variables, including tree density,
basal area, canopy cover and regeneration density, were
compared between burned and unburned sites at low
and high altitudes with Kruskal–Wallis two-sample
tests (α = 0·05). Following a statistically signiﬁcant
result (Mann–Whitney U-statistic) for a total variable,
such as total basal area, the basal areas of individual
species were compared between burned and unburned
sites with pairwise Kruskal–Wallis two-sample tests.
Because some species were sparsely distributed at some
sites, only species that were present on ≥20% of the plots
at a given site were tested for statistical signiﬁcance of
changes. Alpha levels for these tests were adjusted by
dividing by the number of pairwise tests (Bonferroni
correction).
Changes over time from the preﬁre to the postﬁre
measurements within sites were tested with Wilcoxon
signed-ranks tests to take advantage of the repeated
measurements on the permanent plots. We followed
the same procedure as with the between-site tests:
following a statistically signiﬁcant result (Wilcoxon Z
statistic) for a total variable, we proceeded to Bonferroni-
corrected pairwise comparisons by individual species.
Test results are reported in the text below rather than
the tables to distinguish between-site and within-site
differences.
We used non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS)
ordinations to illustrate multivariate changes in basal
area of all tree species among plots using PC-ORD
software (McCune & Mefford 1999). Basal area was
selected because it is likely to be more reliably recon-
structed than past tree density (Moore et al. 2004).
Three time periods were compared at each altitude:
(i) reference conditions reconstructed with dendro-
ecological data (Fulé et al. 2002, 2003a); (ii) preﬁre
conditions and (iii) postﬁre conditions. At the low- and
high-altitude sites, both the burned and unburned
areas were compared together on the same set of axes.
We used the Bray–Curtis distance measure (Faith,
Minchin & Belbin 1987) with random starting conﬁg-
urations, 40 runs with real data, a maximum of 400
iterations per run and a stability criterion of 0·00001. A
Monte Carlo test with 50 randomizations was used to
determine how likely the observed stress value of the
ﬁnal solution would be by chance alone.
Results
 
The ﬁres produced higher maximum bole char height
per plot and greater basal area killed as altitude
increased (Fig. 1). The absolute and relative (%) values
of basal area killed were highly correlated (r = 0·93,
P < 0·001). At low altitude, the maximum mortality on
any plot reached 13·7 m2 ha−1 (58%). This was the only
plot with > 10 m2 ha−1 mortality; the mean mortality
was 1·6 m2 ha−1, with an average of 6% of preﬁre basal
area. In contrast, at the mid-altitude site, 12 of 29
plots had > 10 m2 ha−1 mortality. Mean mortality was
9·5 m2 ha−1, with an average of 23%, reaching a maxi-
mum of 32·4 m2 ha−1. The highest single-plot relative
mortality was 83%. Severity was greatest at the high-
altitude sites, where 10 of 18 plots exceeded 10 m2 ha−1
mortality. Mean mortality was 14·4 m2 ha−1, corre-
sponding to an average of 39% and reaching a maximum
of 53·4 m2 ha−1. Two plots had 100% overstorey mortality
and a third reached 92% mortality.
Changes were minimal at the low-altitude sites
(Table 3). Total density and basal area were not signi-
ﬁcantly different between the burned and unburned
sites in the preﬁre measurement. After the ﬁre, however,
density was signiﬁcantly lower in the burned site (U =
310, P = 0·04) but neither pines nor oaks separately
were signiﬁcantly different between burned and unburned
sites. Basal area remained non-signiﬁcantly different
between sites.
Within the low-altitude sites, the burned site tree den-
sity dropped signiﬁcantly in total (Z = −3·98, P < 0·001)
and for ponderosa pine (Z = −2·65, P = 0·008) and

postﬁre measurements.

Gambel oak (Z = −3·22, P = 0·001). All New Mexico
locust trees, averaging 82 stems ha−1 before the ﬁre, were
killed or topkilled on the burned site. Probably because
of drought, the unburned site density decline was
also signiﬁcant in total (Z = −2·09, P = 0·04) and for
ponderosa pine (Z = −3·17, P = 0·002) and Gambel
oak (Z = −2·48, P = 0·01). Basal area in the burned
site declined signiﬁcantly by 6% (Z = −2·21, P = 0·03).
Ponderosa pine basal area did not change signiﬁcantly
but Gambel oak did (Z = −3·22, P = 0·001). Basal area
did not change signiﬁcantly at the unburned site
(2% decline).
At mid-altitude, because there was no companion
unburned site available, results were simply the
changes over time from preﬁre to postﬁre measurements.
Tree density declined by 54% (Table 3), a signiﬁcant
decrease from pre- to postﬁre (Z = −4·70, P < 0·001),
driven by signiﬁcant declines in white ﬁr (Z = −4·37,
P < 0·001), ponderosa pine (Z = −3·59, P < 0·001), and
aspen (Z = −4·18, P < 0·001) but not Douglas ﬁr. The
23% decline in total basal area was also signiﬁcant
(Z = −4·29, P < 0·001) but in this case only white ﬁr and
aspen were signiﬁcantly lower (Z = −4·23 and −4·08,
respectively, both P < 0·001).
The most pronounced declines in tree density and
basal area occurred at the high-altitude sites (Table 3).
Before the ﬁre, total density and basal area were indis-
tinguishable between the sites (U = 170 and 168, P = 0·80
and 0·89, respectively). After the ﬁre, both variables
were signiﬁcantly lower in the burned sites (U = 79 and
56, P = 0·009 and P < 0·001, respectively). Tree density
differences were driven by signiﬁcant differences between
sites in subalpine ﬁr and spruce (U = 75 and 62, P = 0·004
and P = 0·001, respectively). Basal area differences were
also the result of signiﬁcant differences between sites
in subalpine ﬁr and spruce (U = 68 and 77, P = 0·002
and P = 0·006, respectively).
Within high-altitude sites, the burned site tree density
dropped 57%, a signiﬁcant decrease in total (Z = −3·72,
P < 0·001) and white ﬁr, spruce and aspen (Z = −3·07,
−2·69, and −3·46, P = 0·002, 0·007, and 0·002, respec-
tively). Basal area declined 42% in the burned site, also
signiﬁcant (Z = −3·72, P < 0·001), driven by declines in
white ﬁr and spruce (Z = −3·01 and −3·46, P = 0·003
and 0·002, respectively). In contrast to the ﬁndings
at low altitude, signiﬁcant declines also occurred over
time in the unburned site. Unburned site tree density
decreased signiﬁcantly by 11% (Z = −3·72, P < 0·001)
but the only individual species with a statistically
signiﬁcant decline was spruce (Z = −3·12, P = 0·002).
Unburned site basal area declined signiﬁcantly by 6%
(Z = −2·98, P = 0·003) but no individual species had a
statistically signiﬁcant decline.
Tree mortality in both burned and unburned sites
occurred predominantly in the smaller size classes,
evidenced both by diameter distributions (Fig. 2) and
the disproportionately greater reduction in tree density
(6–57%) compared with the lesser reduction in basal
area (2–42%) (Table 3). On the burned sites, the pro-
portion of dying trees ≤ 20 cm d.b.h. was 95% at the
low-altitude site, 83% at the mid-altitude site and 79%
at the high-altitude site. On the two unburned sites,
100% of the dying trees at the low-altitude site and
74% of the dying trees at the high-altitude site were

≤ 20 cm d.b.h. Delayed mortality (trees on the burned
sites that died between 2004, the ﬁrst growing season
following the ﬁres, and 2005) accounted for only 4·2%
of trees dying at the low-altitude site but 15·6% and
11·2% at the mid- and high-altitude sites, respectively
(Fig. 2). As a proportion of basal area, delayed mortality
accounted for < 2%, 9·9% and 12·2% at the low-, mid-
and high-altitude sites, respectively.
Across all ﬁres, surviving overstorey trees (≥ 15 cm
d.b.h.) tended to be larger and have lower maximum
bole char heights than trees that died (Fig. 3 and Table 4).
These differences were statistically signiﬁcant for all
combinations of species and ﬁres, except for aspen
diameter at the high-altitude site and subalpine ﬁr
and spruce bole char (Table 4). Species varied in the
proportion of large trees dying, with ‘large’ deﬁned
as d.b.h. ≥ 37·5 cm (White 1985). Large trees made up
15% of tree mortality for white ﬁr, 29% for subalpine ﬁr,
16% for spruce, 7% for ponderosa pine, 14% for aspen
and none for Douglas ﬁr.
Shifts in the distribution of basal area by species
maintained variability in forest structure but moved in
the direction of historical reference conditions, as illus-
trated in ordination diagrams (Fig. 4). At all sites, the
distribution of reference plots tended to be somewhat
more aggregated than the pre- and postﬁre distributions.
Arrows in Fig. 4 show the change in the geometric
centroid from reference to preﬁre to postﬁre. At the
low-altitude site, the change was too small to be graphed,
consistent with the minimal changes in total basal area
(2–6%). The mid-altitude site showed a distinct shift
associated with the burn, moving in the direction of the

preﬁre plot distribution moved sharply back within
the cloud of reference plots. However, the centroid of
the unburned plot distribution also moved a relatively
large distance, about 40% as much as the burned plots.

Canopy cover (Table 5) at low-altitude sites did not
differ signiﬁcantly between burned and unburned sites
before or after the ﬁre, but declined signiﬁcantly within
both sites over time (burned Z = −2·49, P = 0·01;
unburned Z = −2·11, P = 0·03). At mid-altitude, canopy
cover (Table 4) declined signiﬁcantly over time
(Z = −2·63, P = 0·009). At high altitude, canopy cover
(Table 5) did not differ signiﬁcantly between burned
and unburned sites before the ﬁre. Postﬁre canopy cover
between sites and changes over time in the unburned
site could not be assessed because of missing canopy
data, but cover declined signiﬁcantly in the burned site
(Z = −2·94, P = 0·003).

Tree regeneration, all trees < 2·5 cm d.b.h. (Table 6),
displayed much more variability than the larger trees.
Total regeneration was not signiﬁcantly different between
burned and unburned sites at low and high altitudes,
either before or after the ﬁres. Within sites, however,
only the mid-altitude site failed to show signiﬁcant dif-
ferences from before to after the ﬁre. Total regeneration
increased signiﬁcantly at the low-altitude burned site
(Z = 2·29, P = 0·02), driven by a signiﬁcant increase
in New Mexico locust (Z = 2·74, P = 0·006), which
doubled in density. The low-altitude unburned site
also increased signiﬁcantly (Z = 2·29, P = 0·02) but no
individual species had a signiﬁcant change. At the
high-altitude site, both the burned and unburned sites
declined signiﬁcantly in regeneration density over time
(Z = −3·42 and −2·67, P < 0·001 and P = 0·007, respectively)
but the only individual species with a statistically
signiﬁcant decrease was aspen, in the unburned site
(Z = −2·79, P = 0·005). Total regeneration density was
not associated with ﬁre severity but was positively
correlated with maximum per-plot char height (r = 0·25,
P = 0·023).

Forest ﬂoor depth (litter plus duff) declined in the
burned areas but relationships between burned and
unburned sites were variable (Table 7). Forest ﬂoor
depth was signiﬁcantly lower at the unburned low-
altitude site before the ﬁre (U = 711, P < 0·001) but
depths did not differ afterwards. The opposite
occurred at the high-altitude site, where forest ﬂoor
depth was indistinguishable before burning but was
signiﬁcantly lower in the burned site afterward (U = 43,

highly signiﬁcant at the low-, mid- and high-altitude
sites (Z = −5·03, −4·68, and −3·64, respectively; all
P < 0·001). Forest ﬂoor depth also declined signiﬁ-

Woody debris biomass was indistinguishable between

lower at the high-altitude burned site after the ﬁre

sites (Z = −2·44, −4·08, and −2·46, P = 0·01, < 0·001 and

at the mid- and high-altitude burned sites (Z = −4·70

Discussion
Fire variability in 2003 was correlated with altitude,
forest type and historical ﬁre regime characteristics.
Prior to anthropogenic disruption of ﬁre regimes, c.
1880, moister conditions at higher altitudes supported
productive forests that burned less frequently but with
greater severity than the xeric, lower altitude forests
(Dutton 1882; Lang & Stewart 1910; Rasmussen 1941;
White & Vankat 1993; Wolf & Mast 1998; Fulé et al.
2003a). The 2003 WFU ﬁres had patterns of severity
that were generally consistent with the historical
patterns. The fortuitous combination of preﬁre plot
locations and ﬁre patterns made it possible to compare
burned and unburned sites to separate ﬁre effects from
background variability. We had a sufﬁciently high
sample size (n = 18–36) and were able to take advantage
of the power of repeated measurements for a statistically
reliable evaluation. Mortality on the unburned sites
reﬂected the severe drought during the measurement
period (Breshears et al. 2005) but burned sites had higher
mortality and burned–unburned companion sites that
were statistically indistinguishable prior to ﬁre became
signiﬁcantly different in tree density and basal area
afterwards.
The thinning effect of ﬁre was concentrated on smaller,
shorter and ﬁre-susceptible trees (79–95% of all tree
mortality), reducing the potential for fuel ladders.
Large trees (> 37·5 cm d.b.h) also died, however, at rates
from 0% and 7% (Douglas ﬁr and ponderosa pine,
respectively) to 29% (subalpine ﬁr). For comparison, in
two recent forest restoration experiments near the park
during nearly overlapping periods (c. 1998–2005), large
ponderosa pine trees died by 5 years post-treatment at rates
from 9% to 34% following tree thinning and prescribed
ﬁre (Fulé, Laughlin & Covington 2005; P.Z. Fulé, un-
published data). Thus the mortality of large trees of ﬁre-
resistant species in the free-burning WFU ﬁres was less
than mortality in mechanical + ﬁre restoration treatments.
Death of ﬁre-susceptible species shifted species
composition towards ﬁre-resistant trees. Shade-tolerant
coniferous species favouring mesic conditions, partic-
ularly true ﬁrs and spruce, experienced disproportionate
mortality (31–82% basal area decline), while ﬁre-resistant
ponderosa pine and Douglas ﬁr tended to survive
(2–8% basal area decline). At the high-altitude site, the
latter two species made up 26% of total basal area
before the ﬁre but 42% afterwards, compared with an
unnoticeable shift in the companion unburned site
(26% to 28%). Regeneration favoured ﬁre-susceptible
species, including sprouting deciduous species, spruce
and true ﬁrs. Regeneration density was lowest for
ponderosa pine and Douglas ﬁr, the most ﬁre-resistant
overstorey species, making up < 1% of all stems. The
demographic imbalance does not necessarily forecast
future forest structure, however. Many small sprouts
fail to reach the stature of established plants, especially
if burned again (Gottfried 1980; Harrington 1985).
The effects of the 2003 WFU ﬁres should not be
overgeneralized. Perhaps more than other management
actions, such as prescribed burning, WFU is inherently
highly variable. In moist high-altitude forests, ﬁre spread
will not be feasible unless the fuels and weather are
fairly dry. This means that managers must be willing to
accept a relatively high risk of intense ﬁre behaviour.
Also, our conclusions about the 2003 WFU ﬁres are
necessarily limited to the portions of those ﬁres where
pre-existing plots had been located. In the case of the
Poplar ﬁre, speciﬁcally, the plots were located at the
northern part of the ﬁre, while areas of relatively more
severe burning occurred to the south (according to ﬁre
severity maps on ﬁle at Grand Canyon National Park).
Given these caveats, however, the 2003 WFU ﬁres
can be considered broadly successful in ecological
terms. Even though an unusually long ﬁre-free period
(1880–2003) had occurred at the mid- and high-altitude
burned sites, ﬁre effects were consistent with historical
patterns of reduced severity at lower altitude and vice
versa. The WFU ﬁre had the least impact at the low-
altitude site, where, despite the fact that the ﬁre regime
had shifted after 1879 from approximately 11 widespread

ﬁres per century to fewer than three, forest structure
had not changed a great deal from preﬁre exclusion
conditions (Fulé et al. 2002; Fig. 4). Forest structural
changes were generally consistent with restoration
of the historical range of variability, although at high
altitude the effects were mild: only three out of 18 plots
had > 90% mortality, whereas a reconstruction of the
mixed-severity ﬁre regime on this site suggested that as
much as one-third of the area might have been in early
successional stages following patchy stand-replacing
burning before 1880 (Fulé et al. 2003a).
The 2003 WFU ﬁres improved logistical conditions
for future ﬁres. Now that a large contiguous area of the
north-western North Rim has burned, it may be easier
for managers to allow future natural ignitions to burn.
Unlike the sites studied by Miller & Parsons (2004), both
rims of Grand Canyon receive large numbers of natural
ignitions (Fulé et al. 2002), so the future ﬁre regime
should not necessarily be limited by artiﬁcial barriers
to importing ﬁre. It may also be possible to expand the
permissible range of ﬁre intensity to match more closely
long-term historical patterns, particularly at high altitude.
The evidence suggests that even at longer-than-historical
ﬁre intervals, the WFU policy can beneﬁt Grand Canyon
forests, suggesting that concerns about the difﬁculty of
emulating historical ﬁre regimes (Parsons 2000) may
be alleviated. Instead of judging ecological condition
largely by ﬁre regime departures (Schmidt et al. 2002),
we suggest that Grand Canyon managers should focus
on ﬁre-effect monitoring to assess ecosystem status.
Ecological restoration, whether focused on ‘restoration
of natural ﬁre to wilderness’ (Parsons 2000) or in broader
assessments of ecosystem structure, composition and
function compared with historical reference conditions
(Allen et al. 2002), can be criticized because future
climate conditions will not be like those of the past
(Millar & Wolfenden 1999). However, the issue is
not whether future climates will be unchanging, they
will not, but rather whether native forest ecosystems
can persist under future conditions. Climate change,
whether through gradual changes or greater extremes
that affect disturbance severity, may create novel
thresholds beyond which a species or ecosystem type
cannot survive (Malcolm et al. 2002). But unless or
until such a point is reached, the most relevant question
for assessing restoration is sustainability (Clewell 2000).
If the goal were to restore species or ecosystems char-
acterized by cool, moist environments, then historical
reference conditions could well be in conﬂict with future
climate. This may be the case for relict populations
of Chihuahua spruce, for example (Ledig et al. 2000).
In contrast, in the speciﬁc case of the 2003 WFU ﬁres
at Grand Canyon, ﬁre effects caused the ecosystems
to move closer towards historical reference conditions
while simultaneously reducing the living, dead and
ladder fuels that made the forest vulnerable to unchar-
acteristically severe ﬁre. These changes help make the
forests more resistant to the expected increases in ﬁre
size and severity (McKenzie et al. 2004).
