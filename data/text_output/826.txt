1. Introduction
Presently, there is strong interest in the development and testing
of approaches for mitigating ﬁre hazards in forests of the western
United States (USDA Forest Service, 2000). Treatments that attempt
to balance fuels reduction objectives with conservation of ecological
integrity are highly desirable (Dellasala et al., 2004). Fuels reduction
treatments may complement ecological restoration goals in sea-
sonally dry, frequent ﬁre-adapted forest types such as ponderosa
pine (Pinus ponderosa) and lower elevation mixed-conifer forests
(Stephens, 1998; Miller and Urban, 2000; Fule´ et al., 2002; Brown
et al., 2004). In these ecosystems, recruitment of young trees into
lower canopy layersand accumulationof surface andground fuels as
a result of 20th century ﬁre exclusion have shifted ﬁre regimes from
low- to high-severity (Covington et al., 1994). However, in moderate
or infrequent-ﬁre types, such as pinyon–juniper woodlands, post-
settlement ﬁre exclusion may have minimally affected ecosystem
physiognomy (Baker and Shinneman, 2004; Floyd et al., 2004).
Fuels reduction treatments in these forest types have potential to
degrade ecological conditions bycreating novel standstructuresand
altering natural disturbance regimes (Romme et al., 2003). None-
theless, fuel hazard reduction activities in such ecosystems are
being enthusiastically pursued, particularly to mitigate wildﬁre
hazard in wildland–urban interface (WUI) zones. Presently, science-
based information to help guide fuels treatments in pinyon–juniper
woodlands is scarce.
Principles of fuel hazard reduction treatments have been
formulated for frequent ﬁre-adapted forests; these same principles

Concern over uncontrollable wildﬁre in pinyon–juniper woodlands has led public land managers in the
southwestern United States to seek approaches for mitigating wildﬁre hazard, yet little information is
available concerning effectiveness and ecological responses of alternative treatments. We established a
randomized block experiment at a pinyon–juniper site in northern Arizona and tested effects of no treat-
ment (Control), thinning only (Thin), prescribed ﬁre only (Burn), and thinning followed by prescribed ﬁre
(Thin + Burn) on overstory structure, hazardous fuels reduction, and woody understory responses. One year
after implementation, mean trees perhectare (TPH) ofUtah juniper (Juniperusosteosperma) andpinyonpine
(Pinus edulis), and basal area (BA) of pinyon, were signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) less in Thin and Thin + Burn
treatments than Control. Additionally, pinyon TPH was less in Burn than Control. Quadratic mean diameter
was signiﬁcantly greater in Thin and Thin + Burn than in Control and Burn treatments. Thinning shifted
diameter distributions from uneven- to even-sized. Crown fuel load (CFL) of both pinyon and juniper was
signiﬁcantly lower in Thin and Thin + Burn compared with Control and Burn treatments. Thin, Burn, and
Thin + Burn treatments resulted in signiﬁcantly greater 1-h surface fuel loads compared with the Control.
The Thin treatment resulted in signiﬁcantly greater mean load of the 1000-h fuel class compared with Burn
and Control treatments, but did notdifferfrom Thin + Burn. Forest ﬂoor Oi (litter) layer was not signiﬁcantly
affected by the treatments but Oe + Oa (duff) depth was signiﬁcantly less in the Burn treatment compared
with Thin and Control. Live shrubs and tree regeneration showed no differences among treatments. We
concluded that thinning and thinning followed by prescribed ﬁre were effective approaches for fuels
reduction; however, resulting stand structures may be novel and outside the historical range of variability.
Prescribed ﬁre alone had minimal effects on structure and fuels reduction. Woody shrubs and tree
regeneration in the understory suggested that these treatments may not have long-term deleterious
ecological effects.

also are applied for wildﬁre mitigation in infrequent-ﬁre types
such as pinyon–juniper woodlands (Brown et al., 2004; Agee and
Skinner, 2005). According to these principles, the main focus of
fuels reduction treatments is to increase forest resilience to crown
ﬁre by reducing key elements of fuel complexes and retaining
large, ﬁre-resistant trees. Mechanical thinning, prescribed ﬁre, or
combinations of the two approaches are commonly used to meet
these objectives. Mechanical thinning allows managers to pre-
cisely select small trees for removal, thereby reducing ladder and
canopy fuels, raising crown base heights, and interrupting surface-
canopy fuel continuity. In more productive forest types, ﬂaming
combustion of surface fuels can initiate and support spread of
crown ﬁres. Surface fuels loads may be effectively reduced by
application of prescribed ﬁre (Fule´ et al., 2002). In untreated
pinyon–juniper woodlands,
however, surface
fuel
loads
are
typically low and crown ﬁres may be more often initiated by live
understory fuels such as shrubs (Baker and Shinneman, 2004).
Beneﬁts of mechanical thinning can be negated if slash increases
surface fuel loading, and if these fuels are not subsequently treated
(Graham et al., 1999).
Prescribed ﬁre alone may be used to accomplish some fuels
reduction objectives, but its effectiveness is variable and depen-
dent upon ﬁre intensity and tree characteristics (Sackett et al.,
1994; Erskine and Goodrich, 1999). For example, prescribed ﬁre
used without mechanical thinning can reduce ground and surface
fuels but may not produce desired effects on stand structure
(Peterson et al., 1994; Sackett et al., 1996; Fule´ et al., 2002).
Mechanical thinning followed by prescribed ﬁre is an intensive
approach that can precisely reduce fuel complexes and increase
forest resilience to wildﬁre (Fule´ et al., 2001; Pollet and Omi, 2002;
Strom and Fule´, 2007). Presently, it is unclear whether principles
developed for frequent ﬁre systems can be used to effectively
mitigate wildﬁre hazard and conserve ecological integrity of
pinyon–juniper woodlands.
In this study, we were interested in comparing alternative ﬁre
hazard mitigation treatments in terms of their effects on fuel hazard
reduction and woodland structure. We established a replicated
experiment on the Kaibab National Forest in northern Arizona,
where a mitigation project had been planned with the intent of
providing ﬁre protection to Grand Canyon National Park and the
nearby community of Tusayan. We tested differences between no
treatment, mechanical thinning only, prescribed ﬁre only, and
thinning followed by prescribed ﬁre. We asked the following
questions: (1) How do thinning and prescribed ﬁre treatments differ
in their effects on pinyon–juniper stand structure? (2) Are
treatments that follow general fuels reduction principles (sensu
Agee and Skinner, 2005) effective for mitigating wildﬁre hazard in
pinyon–juniper woodlands? (3) What are the potential long-term
ecological effects ofimplementing these fuels treatments in pinyon–
juniper woodlands?
2. Methods
2.1. Study area
The study area for our experiment was a 760-ha site (latitude
3680102400 to 3585904300, longitude 11281105500 to 11280703800)
located on the Tusayan Ranger District of the Kaibab National
Forest in northern Arizona (Fig. 1). The site ranges 2005–2073 m in
elevation. Annual precipitation in the area averages about 420 mm
and falls bi-modally in winter as snow and in late summer as
monsoonal rain (WRCC, 2007). Average maximum and minimum
temperatures are 17 and 0 8C, respectively. Soils at the site are
mainly Typic Haplustalfs of gravelly loam texture, derived from
limestone parent material (USDA Forest Service, 1991). Pinyon–
juniper vegetation of the area is classiﬁed as Great Basin Conifer
Woodland (Brown, 1994). Overstory composition was mainly Utah
juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) and pinyon pine (Pinus edulis).
Woodlands at the site were considered mature with some stands
greater than 400 years in age. Presettlement ﬁre regime at the site
was one of infrequent, stand replacing ﬁre (Huffman et al., 2008).
Ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa) trees were present on low-lying
microsites but were only a minor component of the woodlands in
our study. Because of its sparse occurrence in our study plots, we
do not report treatment effects on ponderosa pine. Woody
understory species at the site were mainly big sagebrush (Artemisia
tridentata), cliffrose (Purshia mexicana), and Apache plume (Falugia
paradoxa). Shrub-form Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) was also
variably present. Herbaceous communities were comprised of
grasses such as blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) and Muhlenbergia
(Muhlenbergia spp.) as well as forbs such as buckwheat (Eriogonum
spp.) and gilia (Ipomopsis spp.).
2.2. Experimental design
In order to evaluate alternative fuels treatments, we established
a completely randomized block experiment at the Tusayan study
site in 2004. Six experimental blocks were identiﬁed based on
location and stand delineations done by US Forest Service staff
(Fig. 1). Within each block, eight experimental treatment units
were randomly selected from a systematic grid (200 m  200 m) of
points generated in a geographic information system (N = 48
units). Treatment units, each one-hectare in size, were randomly
assigned one of four possible treatments: (1) no treatment
(Control); (2) tree thinning from below according to a species-
speciﬁc prescription (Thin; see Section 2.4); (3) prescribed ﬁre only
(Burn); and (4) thinning from below followed by prescribed ﬁre
(Thin + Burn). One sample plot, 0.04-ha in size, was established in
the center of each treatment unit (N = 48 plots).

2.3. Field measurements
Sample plots were measured in early summer 2004 before
treatment (pretreatment) and again in 2007, 1 year after full
treatment implementation (post-treatment). On each sample plot,
all live overstory trees (>1.37 m in height) were tallied, identiﬁed
to species, and measured for stem diameter, average crown
diameter, crown base height, and total height. Tree diameter was
measured at root collar (drc) and average crown diameter was
estimated by taking measurements perpendicular to the main
stem and parallel with the longest and shortest crown axes. Tree
seedlings (<1.37 m in height) and shrubs were tallied by species on
a 100-m2 (5.64 m radius) plot nested within the larger overstory
plot. Woody surface fuels were tallied according to Brown (1974)
on one 5.24-m transect established in a random direction from
each plot center. Fuels were tallied in the following diameter size
classes that correspond to moisture release lag times: (1) <0.6 cm
(1-h); (2) 0.6–2.5 cm (10-h); (3) 2.5–7.6 cm (100-h); (4) >7.6 cm,
mostly sound wood (1000-h sound); and (5) >7.6 cm, mostly
rotten wood (1000-h rotten). Hereafter, woody surface fuels are
referred to by their timelag classes (e.g., 1-h fuels). In addition, we
used surface fuel transects to record depth of forest ﬂoor O
horizons. At 10 regularly spaced points on each transect, depth of
Oi and Oe + Oa layers were measured to the nearest 0.25 cm. These
ground fuel layers are also known as litter and duff, respectively
(Pyne et al., 1996).
2.4. Treatment implementation
The experimental thinning prescription we tested was intended
to emulate actual fuels reduction treatments planned for the study
site (personal communication, H. McRae, Tusayan Ranger District,
Kaibab National Forest). On all units selected for thinning, juniper
trees up to 30.5 cm drc and pinyon pine trees up to 25.4 cm drc
were cut. Tree spacing was not considered. In addition, ponderosa
pine trees up to 22.9 cm diameter at breast height (1.37 m above
ground) were cut. Gambel oak, tree seedlings, and shrubs were not
cut. Thinned trees were lopped (piece length around 61 cm) and
thinning slash was scattered. Thinning was done in 2004–2005 by
hand crews using chainsaws.
In September 2006, units selected for prescribed ﬁre treatments
were burned. Burning was done September 10–27 using hand
ignition with drip torches. On these days, relative humidity ranged
about 20–60%, daytime temperatures were 10–30 8C, and wind
speeds at 6.1 m were <16 km h1. Lack of continuous surface fuels,
particularly on plots that had not been previously thinned, made
broadcast burning using either backing or head ﬁres impossible.
Instead, crews targeted areas of apparent fuel accumulation (e.g.,
surface ‘‘jackpot’’ fuels and areas of deeper forest ﬂoor) for ignition.
We considered burning to be representative of operational fuels
reduction tactics for grounds crews.
2.5. Data analysis
Plot data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) to test for pretreatment differences in parameters related
to overstory structure, woody understory, canopy fuels, and
surface fuels. Differences among treatment groups were consid-
ered statistically signiﬁcant when P  0.05. Overstory parameters
estimated were mean tree density (TPH: number of trees ha1),
quadratic mean diameter (QMD: cm) and basal area (BA: m2 ha1).
Understory parameters were mean tree seedling and shrub density
(number ha1). Canopy fuels parameters were canopy fuel load
(CFL: kg m2) and canopy base height (CBH: m). Woody surface
fuel parameters were weight per unit area by timelag class, which
were calculated according to Brown (1974). Forest ﬂoor para-
meters estimated were Oi, Oe + Oa, and total forest ﬂoor depths.
To calculate CFL, we used allometric equations that related tree
diameter to crown biomass. Allometric relationships we used
were from Miller et al. (1981) and Grier et al. (1992) for J.
osteosperma and P. edulis, respectively. Because there were
inconsistencies in the literature for classiﬁcation of ﬁne branch
diameters, we restricted our estimates of crown biomass to foliage
weight only. Although this underestimates total canopy fuels, tree
needles are the main fuel consumed in a crown ﬁre and thus
should provide reasonable indication of treatment effects on
canopy fuel hazard (Cruz et al., 2003). Crown biomass was
estimated for individual live trees and summed at the plot level;
this value was then divided by plot area to derive CFL (kg m2) for
each species on each plot.
No signiﬁcant pretreatment differences among treatment
groups were found. Main effects on post-treatment parameters
were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). When
main effects were indicated, Fisher’s least signiﬁcant difference
(LSD) post-hoc tests were used to assess differences among
treatment means. For data that did not meet ANOVA assumptions
of equal variance and normal distribution, Kruskal–Wallis non-
parametric tests were used to examine treatment effects. When
treatment effects were indicated, we used Mann–Whitney tests to
analyze rank differences between individual treatment pairs. Main
effects and differences among treatment means were considered
statistically signiﬁcant when P  0.05.
3. Results
3.1. Overstory structure
Thinning from below (Thin), prescribed ﬁre (Burn), and
thinning followed by ﬁre (Thin + Burn) differentially affected
tree density and overstory structure compared with untreated
controls (Control) (Table 1). Thin and Thin + Burn resulted in
signiﬁcantly fewer trees ha1 (TPH) for both juniper and pinyon
pine than the Control treatment. The year following full treatment
implementation, mean TPH of juniper was 56% and 66% lower on
Thin and Thin + Burn plots, respectively, than on Control plots.
Compared to pretreatment conditions, Thin and Thin + Burn TPH
decreased by 68% and 78%, respectively. Pinyon pine TPH in Thin
and Thin + Burn treatments was 82% and 86% lower, respectively,
than the Control mean (Table 1). TPH of pinyon decreased on both
Thin and Thin + Burn treatments by 81% compared to pretreat-
ment conditions. Juniper TPH in the Burn treatment was not
signiﬁcantly different from the Control but decreased 22%
compared to pretreatment conditions. Pinyon TPH was signiﬁ-
cantly lower (35%) in the Burn treatment than the Control, and
decreased 25% compared to pretreatment conditions (Table 1).
Post-treatment decreases of TPH in the Control were 4% and 3% for
juniper and pinyon, respectively.
Before treatment, plots generally showed right-skewed dia-
meter distributions with relatively high proportions of trees
<30 cm drc (Fig. 2). Thin and Thin + Burn treatments shifted stand
structure toward even-sized distributions by removing small-
diameter trees. Thin and Thin + Burn treatments resulted in
signiﬁcantly higher quadratic mean diameter compared with Burn
and Control treatments (Table 1). Although the Burn treatment
reduced the number of juniper and pinyon pine trees in the
smallest diameter classes (<20 cm drc), diameter distributions did
not appear to be substantially affected (Fig. 2).
None of the alternatives signiﬁcantly affected juniper basal
area (BA) when compared to the Control treatment (Table 1).
However, juniper BA decreased in Thin, Burn, and Thin + Burn

treatments by 26%, 18%, and 40%, respectively, compared with
pretreatment conditions. Thin and Thin + Burn treatments resul-
ted in signiﬁcantly lower pinyon pine BA compared with Burn and
Control treatments, which were not statistically different. The
year following treatment, pinyon BA in Thin and Thin + Burn
treatments was 51–53% lower than pinyon BA in the Control
(Table 1). Pinyon BA decreased in Thin, Burn, and Thin + Burn
treatments by 44%, 24%, and 54%, respectively, compared with
pretreatment conditions. Juniper and pinyon BA decreased in the
Control treatment by 3% and 2%, respectively, compared with
pretreatment conditions (Table 1).
In general, treatments had minor effects on overstory species
composition. At pretreatment, pinyon pine importance values
ranged 1.12–1.24 across all treatments (a value of 1.0 represents
equivalent importance among species; values >1 suggest dom-
inance; 2.0 is a maximum value and represents monotype condi-
tions). One season after treatment, pinyon importance ranged 0.92–
1.24. Thin and Thin + Burn treatments resulted in shifts toward
relatively greater juniper importance, whereas little change in
species composition was observed for the Burn treatment.
3.2. Canopy fuels
Overall, canopy fuels were most affected by Thin and
Thin + Burn treatments (Table 1). Mean crown fuel load (CFL) of
juniper in Thin and Thin + Burn treatments was 35% and 48%,
respectively, lower than the Control; pinyon pine CFL in these
treatments was 56% and 59%, respectively, lower than the Control.
Prescribed ﬁre alone (Burn) did not signiﬁcantly affect CFL
compared with the Control treatment. Juniper CFL in Thin, Burn,
and Thin + Burn was reduced by 36%, 16%, and 50%, respectively,
compared with pretreatment conditions. Pinyon CFL in Thin, Burn,
and Thin + Burn was reduced by 52%, 23%, and 58%, respectively,
compared with pretreatment conditions. CFL of both juniper
and pinyon in the Control decreased by 2% compared with
pretreatment conditions. Crown base height of juniper was not
signiﬁcantly affected by treatment, whereas Thin + Burn resulted
in signiﬁcantly higher CBH of pinyon compared with the Control
(Table 1).
3.3. Surface and ground fuels
Treatments signiﬁcantly affected 1- and 1000-h sound surface
fuel classes as well as depth of the Oi + Oe forest ﬂoor layer
(Table 2). Thin, Burn, and Thin + Burn treatments resulted in 1-h
fuel loads that were greater than the Control by 170–240%. No
signiﬁcant differences among treatments were found for 10- or
100-h classes. The Thin treatment produced a signiﬁcantly greater
1000-h sound fuel load than Burn and Control whereas Thin and
Thin + Burn loads were statistically similar (Table 2). Loading of
1000-h rotten fuels showed no differences among treatments.
Depth of the Oi forest ﬂoor layer (litter) was not signiﬁcantly
affected by treatment (Table 2). In contrast, depth of the Oe + Oa
layer (Duff) was 60% less in the Burn treatment than the Control,
which was a statistically signiﬁcant difference. No differences were
found among treatments for total forest ﬂoor depth (Oi + Oe + Oa)
(Table 2).
3.4. Woody understory
Tree seedling densities as well as densities of the three most
common shrub species at the study site showed high variability
and no signiﬁcant effects of treatment (Fig. 3). Pinyon pine
seedlings ranged 650–1217 ha1 and were roughly 2–6 times more
numerous than juniper seedlings (208–292 ha1) the year follow-
ing treatment. Densities of the three most abundant shrubs at the
site ranged 500–1208, 42–225, and 50–700 ha1 for A. tridentata, P.
mexicana, and F. paradoxa, respectively (Fig. 3).
4. Discussion
4.1. Treatment effects on woodland structure
Thinning treatments (Thin and Thin + Burn) removed juniper
and pinyon trees less than 30.5 and 25.4 cm in diameter (drc),
respectively, and decreased tree densities by 56–86% compared to
the
Control
treatment.

small trees are removed to reduce ladder and live canopy fuel loads
(Agee and Skinner, 2005). Thinning only the smallest cohorts in the
experimental units did not affect BA of juniper but signiﬁcantly
reduced BA of pinyon compared to the Control treatment. This was
likely due to pretreatment stand structures composed of relatively
few small juniper trees, many small pinyon pines, and relatively
numerous large junipers (Fig. 2). Thinning altered tree diameter
distributions from uneven- to even-sized structures and increased
QMD of both species. Stand structures in which all sizes (and ages)
are present likely develop in undisturbed woodlands as a result of
‘nurse effects’, where seedling establishment increases in shaded
environments, such as those produced by large trees, shrubs, or
other features (Chambers, 2001; Pearson and Theimer, 2004).
Thus, uneven-sized diameter distributions may be expected at
sites like ours with historically long ﬁre-free periods (Huffman
et al., 2008). This suggests that the even-sized distributions,
dominated by mid to large size classes, which were created by
thinning treatments in this study, may represent novel stand
structures with little historical precedent (Bassett, 1987; Romme
et al., 2003; Landis and Bailey, 2005).
Prescribed burning without thinning had little effect on total
juniper tree density and size distribution. However, pinyon density
was signiﬁcantly affected by burning and was reduced to 35% less
than the Control treatment. Burning mainly affected trees <20 cm
drc, but minimally changed tree diameter distributions. Minimal
effects of low-intensity prescribed ﬁre on stand structure have
been described for other pinyon–juniper ecosystems. For example,

negligible stand-level effects to low surface and ﬁne fuel loading in
mature pinyon–juniper woodlands. Similarly, Erskine and Good-
rich (1999) found that weather conditions that allowed crownﬁre
activity were needed in order to reduce pinyon and juniper density
in Utah. In our study, we applied ﬁre under controlled conditions
with hand crews and did not experiment with other types of
ignition or weather conditions that would allow for crown ﬁre
activity. Similar to the conclusions of Bunting (1987), minimal
effects of the Burn treatment in our study were likely due to
discontinuous and low surface fuel loads.

4.2. Effectiveness of fuels treatments for mitigating wildﬁre hazard
In this study, Thin and Thin + Burn treatments effectively
lowered crown fuel load of both juniper and pinyon pine compared
with the Control treatment. Prescribed ﬁre alone (Burn) had no
signiﬁcant effects on CFL. Little research has addressed treatment
effects on crown fuels in pinyon–juniper ecosystems; however, our
results were similar to those from other western forest types.
For example, Fule´ et al. (2002) showed that ‘‘full restoration’’
treatments, that included selective thinning from below followed
by prescribed ﬁre, reduced CFL of ponderosa pine in Arizona by 66%
whereas prescribed ﬁre alone resulted in CFL decreases of 27%.
Stephens and Moghaddas (2005) reported similar patterns for fuels
treatments in mixed-conifer forests of California.
Mean crown base height was minimally affected by treatments
in our study, although Thin + Burn raised pinyon CBH. An increase
in CBH can reduce crown ﬁre initiation potential if CBH is greater
than the critical ﬁreline intensity (a ﬂame length) required for
crown ignition (Van Wagner, 1977; Keyes and O’Hara, 2002).
Effectiveness of tree thinning for raising CBH depends on crown
form and tree architecture at the stand level (Graham et al., 1999).
In our study, minimal treatment effects on CBH were likely related
to a lack of crown base height variation among individual juniper
and pinyon trees; for both species CBH ranged 0.9–2.7 (Table 1). It
is unclear whether CBH of either species would allow crown ﬁre
initiation and modeling ﬁreline intensity was beyond the scope of
this study. Reduction in CFL is likely to lower the potential for
active crown ﬁre, although rate of spread is more closely linked to
canopy bulk density than crown fuel load (Van Wagner, 1977).
Reducing CFL is particularly important in mitigating wildﬁre
hazard in southwestern pinyon–juniper woodlands since large
crown ﬁres in this forest type are often weather-driven and ﬁre
spread is independent of surface fuel loading (Romme et al., 2003).
Treatments produced few changes in surface and ground fuels,
although responses were highly variable (Table 2). Although
surface fuel loads have not been widely reported for pinyon–
juniper woodlands, our values for 1–100-h fuels were generally
similar to those described by Floyd et al. (2003) for an undisturbed
site in Mesa Verde National Park. All treatments increased 1-h
timelag fuels, and the Thin treatment increased 1000-h sound fuels
relative to the Control. Thus, on highly dense or intensively thinned
sites, thinning alone may in fact increase crown ﬁre initiation
potential (Agee and Skinner, 2005) and counteract beneﬁts related
to decreases in live canopy fuels.
Treatments had few effects on forest ﬂoor layers, although the
Burn treatment signiﬁcantly decreased Oe + Oa layer (duff) depth.
In forests where historical regimes of frequent ﬁre have been
interrupted, accumulation of organic forest ﬂoor layers reduce
inﬁltration and slow nutrient cycling (Covington and Moore,
1994). In drier pinyon–juniper systems with historically infre-
quent-ﬁre intervals, forest ﬂoor accumulation is likely not a serious
concern. Litter and duff layers in these systems are important for
reducing soil movement and retaining soil moisture and nutrients
(Davenport et al., 1998).
Abundance of understory shrubs and tree regeneration was not
signiﬁcantly affected by any treatment in this study. This is
probably due to lack of prescribed ﬁre spread and variability in
shrub and seedling density. This suggests that potential remains
for initiation of crown ﬁres at this site (Baker and Shinneman,
2004). Further, it is plausible that increased growth and repro-
duction of woody understory components as a result of decreased
overstory competition may lead to increased chance of crownﬁre
initiation over the next decade (Tausch and Tueller, 1977; Bates
et al., 2005). Reduction in tree density and CFL likely decreases the
potential for crownﬁre spread.
4.3. Implications
Results from this study suggest that mechanical thinning and
thinning plus prescribed ﬁre treatments can reduce wildﬁre hazard
in pinyon–juniper woodlands, primarily by decreasing stand
density and canopy fuel loads. Reduction of canopy cover in dense
woodlands may provide ecological beneﬁts such as increased
resource availability for understory vegetation and improved
habitat for a variety of vertebrate and invertebrate species (Pieper,
1990; Albert et al., 2004; Kleintjes et al., 2004). Long-term
ecological consequences of altering stands from uneven- to even-
sized diameter
distributions
are unclear
and
merit further
research. In our study, treatments did not signiﬁcantly affect
pinyon or juniper seedling densities, suggesting uneven-sized tree
distributions could redevelop in the near future. Other alternatives
that reduce fuel hazards while conserving woodland structure
warrant investigation. Although not tested in this study, treat-
ments such as group selection thinning plausibly could reduce
canopy fuel loads, maintain uneven-size distributions, and mimic
historical ﬁre patterns (Huffman et al., 2008).
Prescribed ﬁre, when implemented by hand crews, produced
few reductions in hazardous fuel loads. Fuel reduction by ﬁre alone
probably requires more extreme weather conditions and ﬁre
behavior than those of this study. Broadening the range of
acceptable weather and ﬁre behavior increases the risk of ﬁre
escape. Thus, a burn-only approach is likely to be better suited for
large wildland landscapes than projects in the wildland–urban
interface.
Since increases in 1- and 1000-h fuel loads produced by
thinning may amplify crown ﬁre initiation hazards, mitigation
activities
should
exert
more
effort
toward
reducing
these
components than was put forth in this study. Such efforts could
include repeated entries with prescribed ﬁre or mechanical
treatments such as mastication. It should be noted that downed
wood can improve soil conditions in degraded woodlands and
provide safe sites for establishment of understory vegetation
(Jacobs and Gatewood, 1999; Stoddard et al., 2008), but downed
wood may also provide host sites for Ips sp. bark beetles (Fettig
et al., 2007).
5. Conclusions
As human communities of the southwest continue to grow and
expand wildland–urban interface boundaries, more work will be
needed to develop management approaches that provide protec-
tion from uncontrollable wildﬁre while simultaneously conserving
ecosystem integrity. This is particularly true for infrequent-ﬁre
ecosystems that may exhibit minimal structural changes since
Euro-American settlement and ﬁre exclusion. In this study, we
examined alternatives for reducing crown ﬁre hazard in pinyon–
juniper woodlands of Arizona. Results suggested that managers
face tradeoffs between altering stand structures and producing
novel characteristics versus accomplishing ﬁre mitigation goals.
More research is needed to gain better understanding of the
ecological consequences of such manipulations. These studies will
aid in assuring sustainability of southwestern pinyon–juniper
woodlands.
