FOREST-FLOOR TREATMENTS IN ARIZONA PONDEROSA  
PINE RESTORATION ECOSYSTEMS: NO SHORT-TERM  
EFFECTS ON PLANT COMMUNITIES  
Scott R. Abellal,Z and W Wallace Covington! 
ABsTRACf.-Leaf litter accumulation during fire exclusion and increases in tree density in postsettlement southwest­
ern Pinus ponderosa forests may limit the establishment of understory vegetation. 'We performed an experiment in P. 
ponderosa forests of northern Arizona to ascertain plant community responses to forest-floor scarification and Oi 
removal on thirty-six 100-m2 plots overlaid on an existing ecological restoration experiment that involved tree thinning 
and prescribed burning. Constrasting with findings from many other forest types, forest-floor treatments had no effect 
on community diversity or composition during the 2-year experiment. Sorensen similarities were as high as 97% 
between posttreatment years within treatments; and successional vectors also provided little indication that treatments 
may appreciably affect longer-term successional trajectories. Lack of response to these fairly drastic treatments is sur­
prising given these forests' exceptionally heavy Oi horizons and large proportions of conifer litter. Apparently shading, 
belowground competition for water or nutrients, or other tree-associated factors more strongly limit understory commu­
nities than does leaf litter. Based on sparse A-horizon seed banks averaging <:300 seeds' m-2 and limited aboveground 
vegetation, we hypothesize that seed shortages, particularly for native perennials. also partly precluded a treatment 
response. Because extensive unvegetated areas at these restoration sites may be colonized by exotics. conservative man­
agement strategies could include testing the seeding or outplanting of desirable native species as an option for filling 
unoccupied microsites. Reporting of "no treatment effect" experiments such as this One is important to avoid biasing 
meta-analvses, as is future research to clarify combinations of factors limiting understory communities. Increased under­
standing of these limiting factors may lead to identification of other treatments that promote recovery of native species 
during ecological restoration in this region.

cones, bark, and wood (Covington and Sackett 
1984). 0 horizons comprising forest floors, 
which include recognizable litter (Oi horizon) 
and decomposed duff (Oe+a horizon), were 
>5 em thick and weighed >3000 g . m-2 in 
dense northern Arizona P. ponderosa stands 
surpassing 1500 trees . ha-1 (Wollum and 
Schubert 1975, Klemmedson 1976, Fule and 
Covington 1994). These depths and weights 
equal or exceed those of many world forests 
(Bray and Gorham 1964, Vogt et a1. 1986), sug­
gesting that litter may particularly affect or 
limit plant communities in contemporary P. 
ponderosa forests. 
vVe performed an experiment in P. pon­
derosa forests of northern Arizona to test the 
hypotheses that removing litter and scarifying 
the forest floor (1) increases plant species rich­
ness and diversity, (2) changes community 
composition, and (3) differentially affects indi­
vidual species. By overlaying this experiment 
on an existing ecological restoration experiment 
that included tree thinning and prescribed 
burning, we sought to measure whether forest­
floor manipulations could speed native plant 
establishment, which sometimes has been 
slow in this region after thinning and burning 
(Abella 2004). 
METHODS 
Study Area 
vVe performed this experiment in the 1200­
ha Fort Valley Experimental Forest (35°16'N, 
III°43'W) in the Coconino National Forest, 
15 km northwest of Flagstaff in northern Ari­
zona. Elevation is ca. 2300 m, and soils are 
primarily basalt-derived and classified as Mol­
lie Eutroboralfs and Typic Argiborolls (USDA 
Forest Service 1995). Annual precipitation 
averages 57 ern and half falls as snow (Western 
Regional Climate Center, Reno, NV). Forests 
are pure P. ponderosa with graminoid-domi­
nated understories. Major graminoids include 
Carex geophila (White Mountain sedge), Eli]: 
mus elymoides (squirreltail), Festuca arizonica 
(Arizona fescue), Muhlenbergia montana (moun­
tain muhly), and Poafendleiiana (muttongrass). 
Before Euro-American settlement (presettle­
ment) in ca. 1875, tree densities averaged ca. 
60 trees' ha-1. Surface fires, primarily from 
lightning ignitions, occurred on average at 
least once every 10 years (Covington et a1. 1997). 
Understory vegetation declined after settlement 
(likely from a combination of livestock grazing, 
fire exclusion, and increased tree density) and 
persisted only below canopy gaps or as iso­
lated occurrences on litter-choked forest floors 
below dense tree canopies (Vose and White 
1991). 
This experiment was overlain on 9 sites of 
an existing ecological restoration experiment 
initiated in 1998-1999, which had goals of 
approximately reestablishing presettlement 
stand structure, reducing fuels, and increasing 
understory vegetation (Fule et a1. 2001a). The 
9 sites in the restoration experiment included 
three 14-ha sites for each of 3 restoration pre­
scriptions: control (no thinning, no burning), 
medium restoration (3-6 thin prescription + 
prescribed burning), and intensive restoration 
(2-4 thin prescription + prescribed burning). 
We did not include a more heavily thinned 
1.5-3 prescription in the present forest-floor 
experiment because this prescription contained 
less P. ponderosa litter, and our goal was to 
isolate effects of manipulating thicker litter 
layers that may strongly limit understory com­
munities. Restoration thinning prescriptions 
represent ratios (e.g., 3-6) at which evidence 
of presettlement tree locations (stumps, snags, 
and fallen logs) were replaced by postsettle­
merittrees retained during thinning. The 2-4 
prescription (the most intensive thinning pre­
scription we examined) most closely approx­
imated presettlement densities. Pre- and post­
thinning average P. ponderosa densities (num­
ber of live trees . ha-1 > lA m tall) among 
restoration prescriptions previously reported 
by Fule et al. (2001a) were as follows: 1188 
and 1188 (control), 1044 and 24:3 (3-6 thin), 
and 1492 and 170 (2-4 thin). All thinning pre­
scriptions were thinned and then burned using 
strip headfires. Restoration prescriptions served 
as blocks in the present experiment so that we 
could more accurately compare responses to 
forest-floor treatments because forest-floor char­
acteristics and tree densities differed among 
prescriptions prior to our experiment (Table 1). 
Experimental Design 
and Treatments 
We randomly located four 10 x 10-m (0.01­
hal plots at each site for a total of 36 plots (11 = 
9 for each treatment). Plots within a site were 
separated by .3 m and arranged in a 2 x 2

square. One of 4 forest-floor treatments was 
randomly assigned to each plot at each site in 
a factorial design consisting of 2 levels of scari-. 
fication (none, 0 horizon scarified) and 2 lev­
els of Oi horizon removal (none, Oi removed). 
Scarification was performed to possibly bring 
seeds to the soil surface while creating a varie­
gated establishment surface for dispersed seeds 
(Chambers 2000). Oi horizons were removed 
to expose mineral soil for a seed bed while 
eliminating thick litter layers that possibly form 
a barrier to emergence from soil seed banks 
(Horman and Anderson 2003). We performed 
scarification treatments manually by dragging 
a 45-cm-wide metal rake across plots to break 
up 0 horizons and the upper few centimeters 
of mineral soil. We removed Oi horizons by 
raking litter off plots using a 75-cm-wide plas­
tic rake, with removals per plot ranging from 
290-2200 kg oven-dry weight. Oe+a horizons 
were thin or absent except in control restora­
tion prescriptions that had not been thinned 
or burned, and we retained these horizons on 
plots during Oi removal. During treatment 
application we observed no apparent damage 
to existing vegetation during treatments, as 
treatments were applied by hand and rakes 
moved over existing vegetation. \Ve conducted 
treatments in April 2003, and we raked Oi 
removal plots again in April 2004 to remove 
litterfall. 
Vegetation and  
Environmental Sampling  
\Ve sampled understory vegetation on plots 
in April 2003 before treatment and in August­
October after treatment in 2003 and 2004. 
vVe collected pretreatment data as a covariate 
for repeated measures analysis of variance 
(ANOVA). Each plot contained six 1 x l-m sub­
plots that were located at the plot corners and 
at the midpoints of the bottom and top plot 
perimeters. Aerial percent cover of plant species 
rooted in each subplot was categorized as 
0.1%, 0.25%, 0.5%, or 0.75% for values below 
1% cover, at I% intervals up to 10% cover, and 
at .5% intervals above 10% cover. We also re­
corded species as present or absent on whole 
plots. We calculated importance values (aver­
age of relative frequency and relative cover) 
for each species on each plot, and we assigned 
a frequency of 1 to species occurring only on 
whole plots for these calculations. Nomencla­
ture and native Or exotic species classifications 
followed USDA-NRCS (2004). 
We assessed sampling reproducibility by 
remeasuring a subplot every 3 plots and by 
checking for consistency of species identifica­
tion and detection on 2 plots inventoried twice 
by 2 different observers. Repeated measure­
ments for subplots differed on average from 
original measurements by 0.17 species' m-2, 
and exhibited Serensen similarities (based on 
percent cover) of 98%. Repeated and original

measurements for plots differed by 1 species' 
. 100 m-2, and also varied by 1 species on aver­
age among observers who sampled plots dur­
ing the experiment. Such low measurement 
error suggests that results from this experiment 
represent actual occurrences and not sampling 
artifacts. 
On each plot we recorded the diameter at a 
height of 1.4 m for each tree> 1 em in diame­
ter. We measured litterfall by installing 2 litter 
traps randomly located around the edge of 
each plot. Traps consisted of a 0.15-m2 plastic 
bucket 30 em tall. We collected an Oi horizon 
sample of 1 m2 on each plot before treatment 
in April 2003, and we oven dried Oi and litter­
fall samples at 70°C for 24 hours. We gravi­
metrically measured moisture of the O-lO-cm 
mineral soil on Oi removal plots and control 
plots by oven-drying a 415-cm3 sample per 
plot at 105°C for 24 hours. Soil moisture was 
measured 9 June 2004 during the driest period 
of the year in this region when no measurable 
precipitation had fallen since April (Western 
Regional Climate Center, Reno, NV). 
Seed Bank Procedures 
We collected fifteen 208-cm3 seed bank 
samples per plot (5 systematically located sam­
ples along each of the bottom, middle, and top 
plot axes) of the 0-5-cm A horizon from con­
trol and Oi removal plots. vVe combined these 
samples on a plot basis (18 composite sam­
ples). We also collected Oe+a samples from 
control plots in control restoration prescrip­
tions (3 composite samples) and Oi samples 
from all control plots (9 composite samples). 
Oi and Oe+a samples were collected as grab 
samples, each ca. 15 g of field-moist matter 
(225 g of composite samples on a plot basis), 
and we sieved Oi samples through a 4-mm 
sieve. Samples were collected and started in a 
greenhouse on 25 June 2004. We selected this 
collection and germination period to estimate 
which species may emerge in the field during 
monsoonal rains, which typically begin in July 
in this region. We placed 120 cm-' of each 
horizon for each plot in separate 700-cm3 
plastic pots filled with 300 cm-' of sterile soil 
(United Industries Co., St Louis, MO). Then 
we randomly arranged the pots in a green­
house maintained at 24°C without artificial 
lighting, watered the samples daily, and moni­
tored emergence for 6 months. 
Statistical Analysis 
We analyzed 3 field-plot response variables: 
species' m-2, species' 100 m-2, and Shannon's 
diversity index-in a repeated measures ANOVA 
with pretreatment data as a covariate and 
restoration prescriptions as blocks. The fol­
lowing model was used: 2003 and 2004 y = 
covariate + blocks + scarification + Oi re­
moval + scarification x Oi removal. To track 
community compositional changes of individual 
plots across sampling periods, we computed 
Serensen similarities for importance value and 
presence-absence data. We compared Sorensen 
similarities among treatments using a 2-factor 
ANOVA consisting of scarification and Oi 
removal as factors with restoration prescrip­
tions as blocks. The raw data approximated 
equal variance (Levene test) and normality 
(Shapiro-Wilk W test), and we used a = 0.05 
for measuring statistical significance. We per­
formed analyses in SAS JMP (SAS Institute, 
Inc. 2002). We also ordinated community data 
(importance values) with successional vectors 
using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (auto­
pilot, thorough mode) in PC-ORD (McCune 
and Mefford 1999). Because the seed bank 
data contained means that equaled 0, we ana­
lyzed them descriptively rather than by using 
inferential statistics. 
RESULTS 
Forest-floor treatments did not significantly 
affect species richness or diversity during the 
2-year experiment based on repeated measures 
ANOVA (Table 2). The covariate (pretreatment 
data) and blocks (restoration prescription) 
were significant in all ANOVA models. This 
indicated only that the covariate was corre­
lated with posttreatment data and that the 
restoration prescriptions differed before and 
after treatment, reducing variance in treatment 
means. Time was significant only for species . 
m-2, with slight increases occuning on aver­
age across all treatments from 2003 to 2004 
(Fig. 1). 
High Serensen similarities (> 75%) indicated 
that little compositional change occurred be­
tween posttreatment 2003 and 2004 measure­
ments for individual plots in any treatment 
(Fig. 2). Lower similarities between pre- and 
posttreatment 2003 measurements simply reflect 
season-of-sampling effects (spring versus fall) 
because similarities did not differ significantly

among treatments. Successional trajectories 
from repeated-measures community ordination 
provided no evidence that plots of similar for­
est-floor treatments converged in species com­
position, suggesting only loose groupings of 
plots within restoration prescriptions (Fig. 3). 
Forest-floor treatments had no clear effect 
on frequencies of individual species, with only 
restoration prescription and time effects appar­
ent for some species ('fable 3). The exotic spe­
cies Linaria dalmatica (Dalmatian toadflax) and 
VerbascLLm thapsus (common mullein) were 
more frequent in restoration than in control 
prescriptions, with seedlings of V. thopsus in­
creasing in frequency from 2003 to 2004. Short­
lived but primarily native species, including 
the annuals Chenopodium graceolens (fetid 
goosefoot), Mulilenbergia raniulosa (green 
muhly), and Nama dichotomum (wishbone 
fiddle leaf), were also more frequent in restora­
tion prescriptions and exhibited overall in­
creases through time. The number of annual 
Laennecia schiedeana (pineland marshtail) and 
P. ponderosa seedlings, however, sharply de­
creased from 2003 to 2004, but these decreases 
appeared to be largely independent of forest­
floor treatments. In contrast, frequencies of the 
perennials Carex geopliila, Festuca arizonica, 
Geranium caespitoswn (pineywoods geranium), 
Muhlenbergia montana, Poa [endleriana, and

not occur in the aboveground vegetation of at 
least 1 plot. Seed density averaged <300 seeds 
. m-2 except for a higher density in Oi hori­
zons of control forest-floor treatments in in­
tensive restoration prescriptions. This high 
average density of 1250 seeds . m-2 occurred 
because 1 plot contained an unusually high 
seed density (2917 seeds' m-2). 
DISCUSSION 
Absence of  
Treatment Effects  
Scarification and Oi removal forest-floor 
treatments had no measurable effect on 
species richness or plant community composi­
tion during the 2-year experiment, and succes­
sional trajectories provided little evidence for 
potential long-term effects (Fig. 3). Sampling 
included complete species inventories of rep­
licated plots and was reproducible across 
years, ruling out inadequate sampling as a rea­
son for the observed absence of treatment 
effects. Our results contrast with many other 
published studies of a variety of forest types 
where some type of community response to 
litter manipulations occurred in <3 years 
(Beatty and Sholes 1988, Carson and Peterson 
1990, Vellend et al. 2000). Furthermore, Xiong 
and Nilsson's (1999) meta-analysis found that 
effects of litter manipulations on plant estab­
lishment were greater in field than in green­
house experiments, in 2- versus I-year experi­
ments, in coniferous compared to deciduous

forests, and in communities with large amounts 
of litter-all conditions which characterized 
our experiment. Treatments were also fairly 
drastic, removing up to 2200 kg of litter on a 
plot. Our plot sizes of 100 m2 also were much 
larger than the ::;;1-m2 plots used in many litter 
experiments, although treatment effects did 
not occur in our experiment at I-m2 scales 
either. 
Limitations to 
Treatment Response 
A number of factors may have limited under­
story responses to treatments in this experi­
ment, including climate, P. ponderosa-associated 
variables other than litter, grazing, competi­
tion with existing vegetation, nutrients, and 
seed limitations (DiTommaso and Aarssen 1989). 
A period of below-average annual precipita­
tion has occurred in the study area since 1999 
after restoration treatments were implemented, 
and the year before initiation of our experi­
ment (2002) was particularly dry (Fig. 5). How­
ever, growing-season and total precipitation 
were near or slightly above normal during both 
posttreatment years in 2003-2004. 
High densities of P. ponderosa in postsettle­
ment forests are well known to reduce under­
story vegetation, presumably from shading, 
allelopathic litter production, and competition 
for water or nutrients (Moir 1966, Lodhi and 
Killingbeck 1982, Naumburg and DeWald 
1999). For example, plant cover and diversity 
increased during trenching experiments that 
severed P. ponderosa roots in Oregon (Riegel 
et al. 1992) and in northern Arizona (Fule et al. 
2001b). Although tree densities were reduced 
in restoration prescriptions in our experiment 
(Table 1), there was no trend for effects of for­
est-floor treatments to be greater on lower 
density plots. Tree densities in restoration pre­
scriptions still exceeded presettlement densi­
ties by ca. 100-300 trees' ha-1, however, and 
may still have been too high for forest-floor 
treatments to elicit a response (McLaughlin 
1978, Moore and Deiter 1992, Abella and Cov­
ington 2004). In these restoration prescrip­
tions, we previously found in 2002 that species

composition and richness - m-2 differed only 
in a heavily thinned 1..5-3 prescription (not 
included in the present study) from control, 
3-6, and 2-4 restoration thinning prescriptions 
(Abella and Covington 2004) where we applied 
forest-floor treatments in the present study. 
Tree densities might need to be below a cer­
tain threshold for understories to respond. If 
this were the case, it seems that reductions in 
shading or decreased belowground competi­
tion accompanying these lower tree densities 
might be more prominent than leaf litter effects 
in governing understory communities. 
Grazing by livestock and other ungulates 
also affects community composition in north­
ern Arizona P ponderosa forests (Clary 197.5). 
Although livestock grazing has been excluded 
from the study area since at least 1998, Huff­
man and Moore (2003) found that heavy graz­
ing by Cercus elaphus (Rocky Mountain elk) 
reduced Ceanothus fendleri (buckbrush) in the 
study area. Grazing thus may have affected 
composition during our experiment. Because 
plant cover averaged < 10% on plots in this 
experiment, it does not seem plausible that all 
niches and microsites were filled and that 
competition from existing vegetation precluded 
a treatment response. Nutrient availability could 
have been limiting, but prescribed burning 
before our experiment may have released nutri­
ents, at least in the short term (Covington and 
Sackett 1984, Kaye and Hart 1998). 
Seed bank data indicated that A-horizon 
seed banks were sparse or essentially absent, 
and aside from 1 plot, few seeds were trapped 
in a horizons (Fig. 3). Thus, few seeds were

likely removed by forest-floor treatments. Sparse 
seed banks, particularly of perennial forbs, 
also were previously reported in the study 
area (Vose and White 1987, Korb et al. 2004) 
and typify many northern Arizona P. pon­
derosa forests (Abella 200.5). In their seed 
budget study, Vose and White (1987) also 
found that seed rain was fairly impoverished, 
ranging from 14-.547 seeds' m-2yr-1 and con­
centrated around existing plants. Propagule 
limitations have been reported in about .50% 
of seed-augmentation experiments, and have 
been particularly severe in communities, such 
as in our experiment, that exhibit sparse seed 
banks, paltry aboveground vegetation produc­
ing few seeds, and much bare ground (Turn­
bull et al. 2000). Seeding and outplanting have 
shown success in the limited areas where they 
have been studied in Arizona P. ponderosa 
forests (Steed and DeWald 2003, Springer 
and Laughlin 2004), and testing for propagule 
limitation in these forests is an important 
research need. 
Potential Long-term  
Species Composition  
Species composition and diversity at the 
onset of this experiment differed between 
control and restoration prescriptions that in­
cluded thinning and burning. However, aside 
from transitions in P. ponderosa seedlings and 
in short-lived species like Laennecia schie­
deana, Chenopodium graoeolens, and Verbas­
cum thapsus, community composition as a 
whole was fairly stagnant in restoration pre­
scriptions in 2003-2004 during our experi­
ment (Table :3). Apparently there was an initial 
increase in plant cover after the 1998-1999 
restoration treatments, driven primarily by 
species that do form fairly large, persistent 
seed banks (Korb et al. 2004), but little change 
since. Bartha et al. (2003) reported a similar 
pattern in a 40-yr study of a New Jersey old­
field succession, where the number of coloniz­
ing species rapidly declined after the first few 
vears of succession. However, increases in col­
~nization rates then occurred after dry years

during "colonization windows" in their study. 
Such increases have not occurred to date in 
our experiment except possibly for undesir­
able species like V thapsus. The biennial V 
iluipsus, usually thought to rapidly decline fol­
lowing initial postdisturbance increases (Gross 
and Werner 1978), remained frequent in res­
toration areas and even sharply increased on 
control forest-floor plots in the intensive res­
toration prescription 6 years after restoration 
treatments (Table 3). Although this species was 
not detected in our seed bank samples, possi­
bly because its germination requirements 
were not met at the time of sample collection 
(Baskin and Baskin 1981), V thapsus is known 
to form large and persistent seed banks (Gross 
and Werner 1978). 
Extensive bare ground, which provides col­
onization sites for exotic species such as V 
thapsus, is a concern given increasing unease 
about exotic species invasions in northern Ari­
zona forests (Sieg et al. 2003). Because these 
unoccupied microsites could continue to fill 
with exotics like V thapsus, Linaria dolmatica, 
or additional undesirable species not presently 
found in current species pools, a conservative 
management strategy is to test seeding or out­
planting of native perennials for potential to 
vegetate unoccupied ground. 
Nonsignificant Results 
This paper reports a main finding of "no 
treatment effect" on plant communities from 
fairly drastic forest-floor manipulations in a 
reproducibly sampled experiment that likely 
would have detected trends had they existed. 
Underreporting of statistically nonsignificant, 
but properly collected and analyzed data is a 
form of publication bias that has long been 
suspected in ecology and increasingly is being 
quantitatively assessed (Moller and Jennions 
2001, Murtaugh 2002). Reporting of nonsignif­
icant results is particularly important to avoid 
biasing meta-analyses, which are being used 
increasingly to synthesize research findings in 
ecology (Osenberg et al. 1999, Gurevitch and 
Hedges 1999), Results of our experiment con­
trast sharply with results of most of the pub­
lished studies included in a recent meta-analy­
sis ofleaf-litter manipulation experiments, which 

2007]

131 
found strong treatment effects in many other 
ecosystems (Xiong and Nilsson 1999). Our re­
sults do not mean that leaf litter has no influ­
ence on plant communities in P. ponderosa 
forests, but rather that treatment responses 
were precluded by other factors which would 
be important to identify in future research in 
order to find ways to increase native plant 
cover. If seed shortages prevented responses, 
for example, it is unclear whether seeding would 
be more successful with or without litter. This 
experiment portrays that economically and eco­
logically effective treatments supplementary 
to thinning and burning still need to be identi­
fied and tested to determine whether they 
promote native vegetation more rapidly in P. 
ponderosa restoration ecosystems.
