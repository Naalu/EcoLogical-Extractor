The health of many Rocky Mountain ecosystems is in decline because of the policy of excluding fire in the management
of these ecosystems. Fire exclusion has actually made it more difficult to fight fires, and this poses greater risks to the
people who fight fires and for those who live in and around Rocky Mountain forests and rangelands. This paper discusses
the extent of fire exclusion in the Rocky Mountains, then details the diverse and cascading effects of suppressing fires in
the Rocky Mountain landscape by spatial scale, ecosystem characteristic, and vegetation type. Also discussed are the
varied effects of fire exclusion on some important, keystone ecosystems and human concerns.

Research Summary
Since the early 1930s, fire suppression programs in the United States and Canada successfully reduced wildland fires
in many Rocky Mountain ecosystems. This lack of fires has created forest and range landscapes with atypical accumulations
of fuels that pose a hazard to many ecosystem characteristics. The health of many Rocky Mountain ecosystems is now in
decline because of fire exclusion; fire exclusion has actually made it more difficult to fight fires, and this poses greater risks
to the people who fight fires and for those who live in and around Rocky Mountain forests and rangelands. This paper
discusses the extent of fire exclusion in the Rocky Mountains, then details the diverse and cascading effects of suppressing
fires in the Rocky Mountain landscape by spatial scale, ecosystem characteristic, and vegetation type. A description of the
effects of fire exclusion on some important, keystone ecosystems is also included. Effects of fire exclusion are detailed at
the stand and landscape levels. Stand-level effects include increases in woody fuel loading, canopy cover, vertical fuel
distribution, canopy stratum, and fuel continuity. Landscape-level effects include increases in landscape homogeneity, fuel
contagion, and hydrology. Cross-scale exclusion effects concern increases in fire intensity, severity, and size as fuels
increase and become more connected. Insect and disease epidemics are also likely to increase, and streamflows are
likely to decrease. Restoration of some semblance of the native fire regimes seems a critical step toward improving the
health of many Rocky Mountain ecosystems.

Introduction
The extensive wildfire season of 1910 was a defining
moment for the United States wildland fire management or-
ganization (Koch 1942). Although the primeval role of fire
had already been altered in some areas of the Rocky Moun-
tains since the mid-1800s by heavy livestock grazing, the
General Land Office had established only a primitive fire
control structure to suppress fires in the remote Rocky Moun-
tains prior to 1910 (Benedict 1930; Koch 1942). Then, 1.5
million ha burned during that dry windy summer of 1910,
and the Forest Service initiated a more aggressive fire sup-
pression policy (Cohen and Miller 1978). The enactment of
the Weeks Act in 1911 improved fire suppression coordina-
tion by providing funding to those states willing to adopt
comprehensive fire suppression plans (Babbitt 1995). By
1929, this emergent fire suppression organization was fully
functional with hundreds of fire towers built and thousands
of men employed (Agee 1993; Koch 1942). Its effective-
ness has accelerated in intensity and technology until present
day. Similar advances in fire suppression organizations oc-
curred after 1945 in the Canadian Rocky Mountains
(Woodley 1995). However, Canadian National Parks policy
was changed in 1979 to allow for natural ecosystem pro-
cesses such as fire to occur under conditions dictated by
park vegetation and fire management plans (Hawkes 1990).
This largely successful suppression program owes much
of its success to strong governmental support and extensive
advertisement campaigns. Smokey Bear’s message was
simple, direct, and effective—“Prevent wildfires”—but it
was also shortsighted (Pyne 1982). In a perfect world, we
should have known that there would be adverse conse-
quences of this pervasive fire exclusion policy. But growth
of Rocky Mountain forest and range vegetation and the sub-
sequent accumulation of hazardous fuels are gradual pro-
cesses, so it was difficult for one generation of forest and
range biologists and scientists to observe and agree upon
the adverse effects of excluding fire from Rocky Mountain
ecosystems. Now we are faced with some critical ecologi-
cal issues in the aftermath of our war on forest and range
fires. The health of many Rocky Mountain ecosystems is
now in decline because of fire exclusion. Moreover, fire
exclusion has actually made it more difficult to fight fires,
and this poses greater risks to the people who fight fires and
for those who live in and around Rocky Mountain forests
and rangelands. This report discusses the extent of fire ex-
clusion in the Rocky Mountains and details the diverse and
cascading effects of suppressing fires in the Rocky Moun-
tain landscape by spatial scale, ecosystem characteristic, and
vegetation type. We also describe the effects of fire exclu-
sion on some important, keystone ecosystems.
It is well documented that most Rocky Mountain eco-
systems evolved with fire (Arno 1980; Pyne 1982; Quigley
and Arbelbide 1997; Swetnam and Baisan 1996). John Muir
stated that fire, along with temperature and moisture, is one
of the greatest factors that govern forest growth (Pinchot
1899). The importance of fire in maintaining ecosystem
health and reducing fuel loads was also identified by Aldo
Leopold (1924) in one of his essays on the subject (Flader
and Callicott 1991). Even Gifford Pinchot (1899) recognized
the critical role of fire in shaping North American forests.
He noted, “the most remarkable regulative effects of forest
fires relates to the composition of the forest,” referring to
the “qualities of resistance to fire the trees possess.” Gruell
(1985b) documents an extensive historical record of fire on
the western landscape since the late 16th century. In
Weaver’s (1943) seminal paper, evidence shows that peri-
odic fires operated to control the density, age, and composi-
tion of ponderosa pine stands. He further states that removal
of fire would “threaten sound management and protection”
of these forests. Benedict (1930) documented an “increas-
ing hazard” over 21 years of fire protection. Yet despite these
early warnings, fires continued to be suppressed on the
majority of public lands because suppression was the more
desirable land management policy (Mutch 1995). It wasn’t
until the late 1970s and early 1980s that wildland fires were

allowed to return to some National Parks and Wilderness
Areas (Kilgore 1985; Kilgore and Heinselman 1990).
The ecological role of fire is to function as an extrinsic
disturbance factor (Crutzen and Goldammer 1993). It is a
“keystone” disturbance that (1) recycles nutrients, (2) regu-
lates succession by selecting and regenerating plants, (3)
maintains diversity, (4) reduces biomass, (5) controls insect
and disease populations, (6) triggers and regulates interac-
tions between vegetation and animals, and, most importantly,
(7) maintains biological and biogeochemical processes
(Agee 1993; Crutzen and Goldammer 1993; Mutch 1994).
Fire is neither good nor bad; fire is an important ecological
process that can produce variable effects. The value of these
effects must be interpreted in the context of human desires
and needs. One fact is known: the removal of fire from the
fire-dominated ecosystems of the Rocky Mountains has
caused a plethora of cascading effects that has permeated
nearly every part of this rugged landscape (Allen and others
1998; Arno and Brown 1989; Bogan and others 1999; Ferry
and others 1995; Mutch and others 1993). At first glance,
the effects of fire exclusion may seem beneficial to society
(for example, preservation of timber resources and water-
shed protection), but on closer scrutiny, there seems little
doubt this policy has created many unhealthy features on
Rocky Mountain landscapes.
It is important to clarify some terminology used in this
chapter. First, “fire suppression” is the act of extinguishing
or fighting fires, while “fire exclusion” is the defacto policy
of trying to eliminate fires from the landscape using fire
suppression techniques. A “fire regime” is a description of
the long-term, cumulative fire characteristics of a landscape
and is often described by frequency, extent, pattern, sever-
ity, and seasonality (Agee 1993; Malanson 1987; Martin and
Sapsis 1992). Time periods commonly used in discussing his-
torical changes in Rocky Mountain fire regimes include: (1)
“Recent Native American Period,” including the four or five
centuries prior to permanent settlement by Euro-Americans
(about 1850), (2) “Euro-American Settlement Period,” which
was a time of large uncontrolled resource exploration and
utilization (about 1850 to 1920), and (3) “Fire Exclusion
Period,” during which government agencies, transportation
facilities, and fire-control infrastructures have had a major
impact on fire regimes. “Native fire regime” describes when
fires are allowed to burn across the landscape, and eventu-
ally the character of the vegetation will reflect the character
of the fires. It is often assumed that historical fire regimes
prior to 1850 were native fire regimes. They may or may
not have involved significant numbers of Indian-caused fires
(Barrett and Arno 1982). “Fire severity” describes the
impact of the fire on the biota and is quite different from
fire intensity, which is the heat output from a fire. Three fire
severity classes are commonly used—nonlethal (low inten-
sity surface fires that do not kill larger individuals), mixed
(patchy severity burns that create mosaics of severity), and
stand replacement (lethal surface and crown fires that kill
over 90 percent of trees) (Morgan and others 1996).
“Ecological processes” are those factors that influence the
flow of energy in an ecosystem and include transpiration,
photosynthesis, and disturbances (Waring and Running
1998). “Keystone” refers to the presence of an important
species or process that is crucial in maintaining the organi-
zation and diversity of an ecosystem (Mills and others 1993).
A discussion of fire exclusion effects must also include
the role of burning by indigenous peoples on the Rocky
Mountain landscape. There is substantial evidence that por-
tions of the Rocky Mountain landscape were extensively
humanized by the early 16th century (Denevan 1992). John
Mullan (1866) recognized that these early inhabitants had a
profound bearing on forest structure and composition re-
sulting primarily from fires they set. They started fires for
many reasons including land clearing, wildlife habitat im-
provement, cultivation, defense, signals, and hunting (Bahre
1991; Gruell 1985a; Kay 1995; Lewis 1985). However, there
is great debate as to whether fire regimes maintained by
Native Americans would have been similar if maintained
by lightning fires alone (Barrett and Arno 1982; Fisher and
others 1986; Silver 1990), and whether anthropogenic burn-
ing is considered part of the native fire regime (Arno 1985;
Kilgore 1985). Fires set by Indians are often different from
lightning fires in terms of seasonality, frequency, intensity,
and ignition patterns (Frost 1998; Kay 1995). For this
report, we assume anthropogenic ignitions are part of the
Rocky Mountain historical fire regimes and, therefore, re-
flect the native or natural fire regimes (Arno 1985; Bahre
1991; Russell 1983). Separating anthropological fires from
the historical fire record would be an impossible task with
highly speculative results.
It is also important to recognize the critical role of
livestock grazing on the decline in wildland fire in the
Rocky Mountains. Extensive grazing of sheep, cattle, and
horses from the early 1850s to the present removed an
important layer of fine fuel (in other words, grass and
forbs) from the landscape (Covington and Moore 1994).
The reduction in grass cover not only removed fuel for
fire spread, but it also limited the dry material available
for fire ignition. Moreover, the elimination of grass com-
petition allowed rapid conifer encroachment that further
reduced grass cover by shading (Hansen and others 1995).
Intensive grazing on Rocky Mountain landscapes has
certainly exacerbated the impacts of modern fire suppres-
sion efforts (Bunting 1994; Gruell 1983; Shinn 1980;
Swetnam and Baisan 1996).
Extent of the Problem
Impacts of fire exclusion are different from the effects of
other management actions, such as logging, because the im-
pacts occur gradually and are manifest in nearly every por-
tion of the landscape rather than localized to small areas. It
is difficult to comprehensively describe and quantify these
effects across large regions because exclusion effects are
tied to native fire regimes, which are extremely variable in
time and space (Agee 1993; Arno 1980; Barrett and Arno
1993; Heinselman 1981; Heyerdahl and others 1995).

Moreover, not all fires can actually be suppressed on the
landscape and, when these wildfires occur on fire-excluded
landscapes, they are often different in severity and aerial
extent from fires that occurred prior to the exclusion era
(prior to 1900) (Mutch 1995; Swetnam and Baisan 1996).
And last, there have been some major land use practices,
such as agricultural development and urbanization, that
have completely altered ecosystems so an historical com-
parison of fire effects would not be meaningful (Morgan
and others 1998). As a result, there have been few re-
gional assessments of fire exclusion effects for the
Rockies, especially for both public and private lands
(Ferry and others 1995).
It appears that only a small fraction of the pre-1900 an-
nual average fire acreage is being burned today. Barrett and
others (1997) estimated an average of 2.4 million ha burned
annually in the interior northwestern United States prior to
1900. Even the biggest wildfire years of the 21st century
burned less than half of this historical average. Approxi-
mately two-thirds of this annual historical burned area oc-
curred in sagebrush and grassland vegetation that have
mostly been converted to agriculture or dry pasture for live-
stock (Morgan and others 1998). Gruell (1985b) estimated
from early journalist accounts of fire throughout the Rocky
Mountain region that modern fires burn less than one-fourth
of the land that burned historically. Leenhouts (1998) per-
formed a comprehensive assessment of burning in the con-
tiguous United States and estimated that approximately 3 to
6 times more area must be burned to restore historical fire
regimes, thereby consuming 4 to 8 times more biomass and
producing 6 to 9 times more emissions than present. Smoke
emission production from prehistoric wildland fires in Brit-
ish Columbia was estimated to be 3 to 6 times larger than
the average annual contemporary production because of the
vast area burned prior to the 1900s (Taylor and Sherman
1996). A mapping of presettlement fire regimes for the
United States revealed more than half the country experi-
enced fires at intervals between 1 and 12 years (Frost 1998).
Kilgore and Heinselman (1990) classified historical conti-
nental fire regimes and found the greatest detrimental im-
pacts of fire exclusion were in frequently occurring (less
than 25 years), low-intensity fire regimes (for example,
grasslands and ponderosa pine) that encompass a large part
of the Rocky Mountains.
A comparison of current and historical fire regimes for
the Interior Columbia River Basin (ICRB) using compre-
hensive digital maps developed by Morgan and others (1996,
1998) provides another spatial assessment of the extent of
fire exclusion. Generally, they found that recent fires tended
to be less frequent and more severe than those that occurred
prior to 1900. The greatest change in fire regimes were in
the shrublands, grasslands, dry forests, and woodlands,
which accounted for over 40 percent of ICRB area (88 mil-
lion ha). Fire regime changes were especially dramatic in
areas converted to agriculture and pastures. As expected,
short fire return interval ecosystems were most affected by
fire suppression. For example, ponderosa pine cover types
decreased by 23 percent, while Douglas-fir cover types in-
creased by 40 percent in aerial extent.
Not all ecosystems or all Rocky Mountain landscapes
have experienced the impacts of fire exclusion as yet. In
some wilderness areas, where in recent decades natural fires
have been allowed to burn, there have not been major shifts
in vegetation composition and structure (Brown and others
1994). In some alpine and desert-scrub ecosystems, fire was
never an important ecological factor. In some upper subal-
pine ecosystems, fires were important, but their rate of oc-
currence was too low to have been significantly altered by
the relatively short period of fire suppression. For example,
the last 70 to 80 years of fire suppression have not had much
influence on subalpine landscapes with fire intervals of 200
to several hundred years (Romme and Despain; Veblen and
others 1994; White 1985, 1989). White (1985) mentions fire
suppression was not effective enough to reduce subalpine
burned area in Bannff National Park in Canada, but Rogeau
(1996) found recent shifts in forest stand ages to older age
classes. Consequently, it is unlikely that fire exclusion has
yet to significantly alter stand conditions and forest health
in these subalpine ecosystems. Yet, Barrett and others (1991)
recognized that fire exclusion effects in long fire interval
fire regimes, such as those in lodgepole pine and spruce fir,
are not yet manifest at the stand level, but are detectable at
the landscape level. For example, they mentioned young
age classes are often missing from subalpine landscapes
where fires have been excluded. Thus, the well substanti-
ated relationship of reduced forest health due to fire exclu-
sion in ecosystems characterized by high fire return inter-
vals (for example, low-elevation ponderosa pine woodlands)
cannot be applied to all mesic subalpine ecosystems with
long fire return intervals. But despite these exceptions, the
Rocky Mountain landscape, taken as a whole, is not burn-
ing at the pre-1900 rate (Covington and others 1994; Frost
1998; Mutch 1995).
Stand-Level Effects
Stand Composition and Structure
Perhaps the most documented and studied effect of fire
exclusion is the change in stand composition and structure.
In general, forest composition has gone from early seral,
shade-intolerant tree species to late seral, shade-
tolerant species, while stand structure has gone from
single-layer canopies to multiple-layer canopies with fire
exclusion (Mutch and others 1993; Quigley and Arbelbilde
1997; Steele 1994; Veblen and Lorenz 1991). This phenom-
enon is repeated over and over again for most fire-
dominated ecosystems of the United States and Canada
(Chang 1996; Ferry and others 1995; Frost 1998; Kolb and
others 1998; Quigley and Arbelbide 1997; Taylor 1998). It
is well illustrated by comparing historical and current pho-
tographs for identical landscapes, such as those shown in
figure 1, as compiled from a wide variety of vegetation
change studies (Gruell 1980, 1983). It is this fundamental

production of aspen, willow, chokecherry, mountain maple, and other deciduous vegetation. Stumps resulting from timber
cutting and snags indicate that the pre-1900 conifer stands were less dense than current stands (U.S. Geological Survey

change in vegetation composition and structure that cas-
cades downward to impact a myriad of other ecosystem
characteristics. Table 1 summarizes the effects of fire
exclusion at the stand and landscape levels described in
detail in the following sections.
The compositional and structural shifts are consistent with
the current successional theory that characterizes how veg-
etation will change without disturbance (Arno and others
1985; Drury and Nisbet 1973; Horn 1974). Plant species
adapted to the early stages of succession, such as those that
best survive or regenerate after a fire, are replaced by spe-
cies that are better able to compete for growing resources in
the absence of fire (Bazzaz 1979; Noble and Slatyer 1980).
Species adapted to the latter stages of succession tend to
possess ecophysiological and morphological characteristics
that dramatically alter the dynamics of stands and landscapes

as succession progresses (Bazzaz 1979, 1990; Drury and
Nisbet 1973; Grime 1966, 1974; Noble and Slatyer 1980;
Wallace 1991). For instance, early seral species tend to have
high photosynthetic rates, low tolerance for shade, rapid
height and diameter growth, frequent cone crops, long
lifespans, and short crown lengths, while most late seral spe-
cies generally have the opposite characteristics (Bazzaz
1990; Grime 1979; Horn 1974; Van Hulst 1978). Since late
seral species are shade tolerant and able to photosynthesize
under low light conditions, forests composed of late seral
species commonly have higher plant densities (plants per
unit area) with many individuals of different size classes
(Oliver and Larson 1990). Especially abundant are the young
shade-tolerant individuals, which bide their time in the un-
derstory waiting for a gap to open in the overstory canopy.
Shade-tolerant trees also tend to have denser crowns that

USDA Forest Service RMRS GTR-91. 2002
9
often extend to the ground (Brown 1978). These thick crowns
coupled with high densities and many size classes create
multilayered stand structures with sparse undergrowth (Frost
1998) ( fig. 1b).
The increase in density, biomass, and number of woody
species also seems to be a common theme in most fire-al-
tered ecosystems (fig. 1). Invasion of shrubs and trees into
grasslands and shrublands due to the lack of fire and heavy
grazing is evident in many areas of the Rocky Mountains
(fig. 1c,d). In southern Canada, Taylor (1998) reported that
fire suppression has become increasingly effective during
the last 40 years, and ecosystems that historically experi-
enced surface fire regimes are now experiencing a reduc-
tion of grassland and open forests and an increase in shade-
tolerant species and dense forests (Taylor and others 1998).
Deep-rooted shrubs increased dramatically in shrub-steppe
ecosystems (Link and others 1990). Inland Douglas-fir in-
vasion into western grasslands of Montana has been well
documented (Arno and Gruell 1986; Hansen and others
1995), as has ponderosa pine into the Colorado Front Range
grasslands (Veblen and Lorenz 1991). Limber pine is en-
croaching prairie grasslands in many parts of its range due
to the removal of fire (Gruell 1983). Extensive conifer in-
vasion into ancient montane grasslands is occurring in the
Southern Rocky Mountains (Allen and others 1998; Bogan
and others 1999). Lodgepole pine invades sagebrush com-
munities when fire is removed from Yellowstone National
Park uplands (Patten 1969). Ogle and DuMond (1997) docu-
mented the increase in woody material due to increases in
tree density for many parts of the Intermountain region
across many forest types and fire regimes. Habeck (1994)
and Arno and others (1995) documented a three- to fivefold
increase in density of shade-tolerant conifers in ponderosa
pine forests (fig. 1a,b). Covington and Moore (1994) re-
corded a tenfold increase in ponderosa pine density since
European settlement.
Biodiversity
Diversity of plants, animals, and ecological processes are
enhanced by fire in many ecosystems. Martin and Sapsis
(1992) mentioned that the control of fire reduces biodiversity,
and it is the variability of fire regimes in time and space that
creates the most diverse complexes of species. Higgins and
others (1991) detailed the adverse effects of fire exclusion
on grass diversity, quality, and vigor in rangelands. Vogl
(1979) related that the healthiest and most diverse grass-
lands are composed of a complex mosaic of burning histo-
ries. Landscapes having fires with high variability in tim-
ing, intensity, pattern, and frequency tend to have the great-
est diversity in ecosystem components (Brown and others
1994; Romme 1982; Sieg 1997; Swanson and others 1990).
Long-term health of below-ground fauna depends on the
variability of fires, whereas the diversity of soil organisms
can be reduced by the severe fires that can occur in stands
where fire has been removed for long periods (Borchers and
Perry 1990). Biondini and others (1989) documented the
complex effect of the season and frequency of fire on in-
creased herbaceous diversity in composition and structure
in grasslands. In Canada’s Banff National Park, Achuff
and others (1996) modeled future vegetation succession
for 95 years without disturbance and found an overall
loss of biodiversity caused by a loss of 19 of 29 vegeta-
tion types.
Successional floristics in most Rocky Mountain ecosys-
tems are best described by the Initial Floristics Model of
Egler (1954), which states that the majority of plant species
present before the fire will be there after it burns the stand
(Anderson and Romme 1991; Veblen and Lorenz 1986).
However, plant diversity tends to decrease with advancing
succession because there are higher numbers of species
adapted to colonize postfire settings from highly dispersed
or dormant propagules (Gill and Bradstock 1995; Stickney
1990). In addition, the density, cover, height, and vigor of
undergrowth species tend to decrease as the overstory be-
comes dense and tree leaf area increases because of domi-
nance by shade-tolerant species (fig. 1a,b) (Gruell 1986;
Stickney 1985). Therefore, undergrowth vascular plant
species richness and density tend to be low in the late suc-
cessional communities commonly found on fire-excluded
landscapes.
Many rare and threatened species have declined with the
reduction of fire (Greenlee 1997). Hessl and Spackman
(1995) found that 135 of the 146 threatened, endangered,
and rare plant species in the United States benefit from wild-
land fire or are found in fire-adapted ecosystems. Although
local species extinction can occur with fires that occur too
frequently or fires that burn too severely, it is generally ac-
cepted that the locally rare plants have greater chances of
thriving on those landscapes that have diverse vegetation
communities and structures created by diverse disturbance
histories and fire regimes (Gill and Bradstock 1995).
Sheppard and Farnsworth (1997) point out that while his-
torical fires were beneficial ecological agents of change,
today’s fire can be a destructive force that endangers rare
plant species because these fires have a greater probabil-
ity of being large, severe, and stand replacing (see later
sections).
Crown and Surface Fuels
One important stand characteristic that changes with ad-
vancing succession is the increase in amount of dead and
live biomass, which the fire community calls “fuels” (Peet
1992). Fuel loadings (mass per unit area) generally increase
in the absence of fire because of a myriad of ecological fac-
tors (fig. 1a,b) (Brown 1985). First and most important, long
fire return intervals mean live fuels have longer times to
grow and dead fuels have longer periods to accumulate on
the ground. Next, crown fuels (aboveground foliar biom-
ass) increase because late seral, shade-tolerant species tend
to have more biomass in the forest canopy due to their high
leaf areas, and the biomass tends to be well distributed over
the height of the trees (Brown 1978; Minore 1979; Waring

10
USDA Forest Service RMRS GTR-91. 2002
and Running 1998). Stand leaf area generally increases over
successional time because shade-tolerant species generally
have longer needle retention times, higher leaf area:sapwood
ratios, and more leaf mass in the crown (Brown 1978;
Callaway and others 1998; Keane and others 1996; Peterson
and others 1989; White and others 1990). Higher leaf areas
usually require additional conducting tissue for support,
which means the tree may need to produce more branch and
twig wood along greater portions of its stem (Landsberg
and Gower 1997). And because late seral species are shade
tolerant, there are many smaller seedlings and saplings
present in the understory to take advantage of any gaps in
the canopy. So, the greater crown leaf and branch biomass
distributed along greater parts of the stem, coupled with high
seedling and sapling densities, can create “ladder” fuels that
allow flames from surface fires to climb into the forest
canopy and result in “crown” fires.
Surface fuel loadings increase as fire is eliminated be-
cause the greater crown biomass ultimately results in in-
creased leaf and woody material accumulating on the forest
floor fuel because the recycling process of fire is absent
(Brown and Bevins 1986; Covington and Moore 1994; Fulé
and others 1997). Dense crowns also reduce solar radiation
attenuated to the forest floor which may lower soil tem-
peratures resulting in decreased decomposition rates and still
higher branch and litter accumulations (Borchers and Perry
1990; Brown and Bevins 1986). Duff and litter depths gen-
erally increase proportionate to the crown closure and leaf
area because of the additional needlefall and reduced de-
composition (DeBano 1991). The rate and maximum amount
of fuel buildup depend on many biophysical factors that con-
trol decomposition, including site productivity, rainfall, and
climate (Olsen 1981). Habeck (1985) found large surface
fuel accumulations on those moist sites with long fire re-
turn intervals such as subalpine fir and western red cedar
forests. Van Wagtendonk (1985) simulated a decrease in
fine fuels but a large increase in large woody fuels when
fires are suppressed in short fire interval ecosystems.
However, Keane and others (1990, 1997) simulated two-
to threefold increases in live and dead biomass as fires
were removed from several ecosystems in the Northern
Rockies. Thick litter and duff layers with high woody fuel load-
ings are commonly found in fire-excluded stands of ponderosa
pine (Covington and Moore 1994; Habeck 1994; Keane and
others 1990; Steele and others 1986), lodgepole (Arno and oth-
ers 1993; Brown 1973), whitebark pine (Keane and others
1994), and aspen (DeByle 1985).
Soils
Soil properties change as fires are reduced and succes-
sion advances in an ecosystem. Organic matter generally
increases with decreased fire frequency, and this improves
pore space, water-holding capacity, and aggregation. How-
ever, when soils with thick organic horizons are burned,
some of the volatilized organic matter moves downward
along a steep temperature gradient and condenses to form a
water repellent layer that impedes infiltration and can cause
massive erosion (DeBano 1991). Endo- and ectomycorrhizae
are particularly sensitive to soil heating by fire because they
are concentrated in the organic and upper mineral soil lay-
ers (Borchers and Perry 1990; Hungerford and others 1991).
While historical fires often killed some of these microor-
ganisms, severe fires resulting from the abnormally high
fuel loadings after fire exclusion can severely reduce their
populations (DeBano 1991). Consumption of the thick soil
organic matter accumulations (in other words, duff and lit-
ter) from fire exclusion will result in deep soil heating that
can kill more plant propagules and microorganisms
(Hungerford and others 1991). Most fires generally increase
soil pH due to ash accretion, which directly affects avail-
ability of many nutrients (Higgins and others 1991). Tem-
peratures of burned soils rise earlier in the season, which
may stimulate some decomposing bacteria and early sea-
son grasses and forbs (Higgins and others 1991). Upper
subalpine soils are often classified as Cryochrepts or
Cryoboralfs during whitebark pine dominance, but con-
vert to Cryoborolls under subalpine fir canopies (Hansen-
Bristow and others 1990).
Fire exclusion effects on nutrient cycling are more com-
plex and confounding (Grier 1975; Klopatek and others
1990). While there is abundant nitrogen in the large amounts
of organic matter accumulated as a result of fire exclusion,
only a small portion of this nitrogen is made available to
plants each year from decomposition by soil organisms (War-
ing and Running 1998). Fire’s combustion process releases
some of the nitrogen sequestered in the fuels and makes it
available as ammonium-N to the plants as it condenses on
lower soil layers, even though a large portion of nitrogen is
volatilized and lost to the atmosphere depending on amount
of combusted organic matter (Grier 1975; Little and Ohmann
1988; Pehl and others 1986; Schoch and Binkley 1986). Ni-
trogen fertilization is also increased by the actions of de-
composing bacteria that are stimulated with fire (Sharrow
and Wright 1977). White (1994, 1996) found that ground
fires consumed volatile organic compounds that could in-
hibit decomposition. Klopatek and others (1990) found sig-
nificant losses of N from the forest floor of a pinyon-juniper
woodland after fire, while White (1996) found nitrogen min-
eralization and nitrification rates were higher in recently
burned stands, and Ryan and Covington (1986) found 80
times more ammonium-nitrogen in burned ponderosa pine
stands. Only 60 percent of phosphorous is lost during fuel
consumption, so substantial amounts of highly available P
are found in ash and at soil surface after fires. Sulphur avail-
ability is also increased by fires (DeBano 1991). Higgins
and others (1991) documented several cases where grass-
land production and yield increased after burning in the Great
Plains due to recycled nutrients. White and others (1990)
found high nitrogen and magnesium levels in whitebark pine
litter, while subalpine fir and Engelmann spruce litter had
high calcium and high lignin contents. In summary, it seems
intact fire regimes ensure continued nutrient cycling and
soil health in the drought-frequent Rocky Mountains.

Carbon and Water Cycles
Some interesting and complex changes in major ecophysi-
ological processes result as species and structure changes
occur during the prolonged successional cycle resulting from
the absence of fire (table 1). Increased leaf area at the spe-
cies and stand level triggers complex physiological responses
in the ecosystem dynamics of the stand. Transpiration, snow
ablation, and canopy interception generally increase with
higher leaf areas, and this can result in periodic seasonal
depletion of soil water, increased canopy evaporation, and
decreased streamflow (Hann 1990; Kaufmann and others
1987; Skidmore and others 1994; Troendle and Kaufmann
1987; Waring and Running 1998). Increased water use of-
ten results in seasonal droughts that reduce water availabil-
ity to individual trees (Kolb and others 1998). High leaf
areas also diminish radiation attenuated to the forest floor,
which when coupled with lower soil moistures, can slow
decomposition rates, limit snow accumulation, and delay
soil thaw (Bazzaz 1979; Kaufmann and others 1987; White
and others 1990). Reduced decomposition can then result
in delayed nutrient cycling, and most often, high woody fuel
and duff accumulations, which when burned, can cause se-
vere wildfires with deep soil heating and high plant mortal-
ity (Kolb and others 1998). Hungerford and others (1991)
identified the role of fire as the primary control of decom-
position and nutrient cycling in fire-prone ecosystems.
Fauna
The high canopy cover and multistoried stand structure
found in late stages of succession certainly improves big
game thermal and security cover (Gruell 1980). However,
the dense canopies also shade out early seral shrubs and
grasses that usually have high forage value for many ungu-
lates. Production of palatable shrub forage in old, fire-
excluded stands may be less than 1 percent of that found in
young postfire communities. Moreover, ungulates may find
dense late seral stands difficult to traverse because of the
abundance of downed logs and thick understory (fig. 1b, f)
(Gruell 1979; Lonner and Pac 1990). In Canada, prime wood
bison habitat consists of early successional mesic prairie
that depends on frequent fire to prevent conifer encroach-
ment and organic matter buildup (Gates and others 1998).
In contrast, Gruell (1986) hypothesized that mule deer ir-
ruptions from 1930 to 1970 were primarily a result of range-
land succession from grasses to shrubs due to reduction in
fire size and frequency. Bighorn sheep can benefit from fire
by reduced lungworm infections, improved forage, and re-
duced tree cover (Peek and others 1985). Freedman and
Habeck (1985) noted that fire exclusion reduced winter range
and forage quantity and quality eventually reducing deer
populations in Montana. Reduction of aspen forests from
the absence of fire has significantly affected the diets of
ungulates that highly prize this valuable forage species
(DeByle 1985). The decline of whitebark pine from fire
exclusion and blister rust in the Northern Rockies can
adversely affect summer range for elk and deer (Lonner and
Pac 1990). Carrying capacity for elk can be diminished by
removing fire from the ecosystem due to reduction in qual-
ity browse plant species (Gruell 1979). Drew and others
(1985) noticed a significant reduction in winter ticks, para-
sites on large mammals, with spring prairie burning in
Alberta.
The plant species that define many fire-adapted ecosys-
tems (for example, aspen, ponderosa pine, whitebark pine)
are often keystone species that are critical for the survival
of many other animals in that ecosystem (deMaynadier and
Hunter 1997). For instance, Hutchins (1994) has chronicled
over 110 animals that consume whitebark pine seeds in high-
elevation ecosystems. DeByle (1985) documented over 134
birds and 55 species of mammals that regularly utilized as-
pen forests. Kendall and Arno (1990) mention that whitebark
pine dominance benefits many wildlife species because the
typically open canopy promotes undergrowth forage qual-
ity and production (for example, increased berry produc-
tion). Higgins and others (1991) detailed the significantly
higher number of insects, birds, waterfowl, and small mam-
mals on prairie landscapes with healthy fire regimes.
Perhaps the largest impacts of fire exclusion may be felt
by nongame wildlife species. Hutto (1995) noted the im-
portance of fire, especially stand-replacement fire, for cre-
ating habitat for many Rocky Mountain bird species. Around
15 species were solely associated with postburn communi-
ties, and over 87 species were found in burned stands. Hejl
(1992) identified the importance of fire-dominated hetero-
geneous landscapes to bird diversity. Landscapes with in-
tact fire regimes have high variability in patch size, shape,
and type, which is extremely beneficial for the existence of
many avian species. This can also be said for many insect
and rodent species (Higgins and others 1991). Finch and
others (1997) mention that fire exclusion in Southwestern
forests tends to favor generalist bird species that can utilize
all stages of succession rather than specialist bird species
found primarily on heterogeneous landscapes, open forests,
burns, snags, or a combination of all. Small mammal popu-
lations may increase with the number of down logs as fuels
accumulate during succession, but many mice, shrews, and
gophers are found mostly in those early seral communities
that directly follow fire. Moreover, the diverse mosaic of
stand structures and composition created by an intact fire
regime greatly correlate with higher numbers of small mam-
mal individuals and species (Ream and Gruell 1980).
Covington and others (1994) noted that the increased ero-
sion from large-scale fires on landscapes with altered fire
regimes degrades riparian habitat and adversely impacts
aquatic organisms because of high sediment loadings.
Exotics
The introduction of exotics into Rocky Mountain eco-
systems has complicated and, in some cases, intensified fire
exclusion effects. Some exotic plant species tend to effi-
ciently colonize following disturbances so restoration of fire

12
USDA Forest Service RMRS GTR-91. 2002
regimes may increase exotic dominance and reduce diver-
sity (Covington and others 1994). However, landscapes will
burn regardless of fire control measures, and the severely
burned areas created by wildfires on fire-excluded land-
scapes might accelerate exotic invasions. Low-severity burns
may tend to favor native plants adapted to survive fire. The
invasion of annual grass exotics such as cheatgrass (Bromus
tectorum) into sagebrush-steppe vegetation types has actu-
ally increased fire frequency because of the presence of
abundant fine fuels (in other words, grasses) resulting in
the elimination of sagebrush and a permanent conversion to
annual grasslands (Whisenant 1990). The use of fire for
control of exotic weed species has had mixed results.
Some exotic diseases and pests have accelerated the suc-
cessional cycle resulting in mid-seral stands having com-
positions and structures similar to old-growth stands. For
example, white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) has
killed many mature whitebark pine in northern Montana and
Idaho rapidly converting stands to subalpine fir (Keane and
others 1994; Kendall and Arno 1990). Blister rust has also
speeded succession in western white pine forests to grand
fir, western red cedar, and western hemlock. This has se-
verely altered the fire regime and successional process,
making restoration difficult but not impossible.
Cultural and Natural Resources
People have changed the way they used fire-dominated
ecosystems as fire was removed from the landscape. Gruell
(1990) noted that the absence of fire has had profound im-
plications on natural resource management. Livestock for-
age resources in the West have been depleted in some areas
because of conifer shading (Gruell 1979). Livestock and big
game carrying capacities have decreased because of conifer
and tall shrub encroachment. And, although fire is often
blamed for destroying visual quality, it can enhance long-
term visual quality and viewing opportunities by reducing
tree densities. The dense tree growth found in forests with-
out fire restricts viewing and detracts from the outdoor ex-
perience. Open-grown, parklike stands of ponderosa pine
created by frequent surface fires have a high aesthetic qual-
ity and are preferred by today’s outdoor enthusiasts
(Warskow 1978). A decrease in recreation activities and visi-
tation can occur as tree cover and density increase with fire
exclusion.
Fire exclusion will heighten fire hazards to forest homes
as people continue to develop and settle lands along the
urban-wildland interface (Fischer and Arno 1988). The loss
of homes and human life can escalate as the surrounding
forest advances in succession because of the buildup of
canopy and surface fuels (Freedman and Fischer 1980).
Moreover, multilayered canopies and dense crowns will in-
crease the chance of crown fires that are difficult to control,
especially in an urban setting (Alexander 1988). This could
increase the risk of harm to the people who own the prop-
erty and the firefighters who try to protect it. This is re-
flected in figure 2 where the amount of area burned in the
Western United States has actually increased even though
we are currently using better fire suppression technology
and are spending more money to fight fires.
The amount and availability of wood biomass will defi-
nitely increase with the continued ingrowth of woody ma-
terial resulting from fire exclusion. Accretion in Western
United States conifer forests was estimated at 1.7 times the
historical average (Covington and others 1994). Keane and
others (1990) simulated a tripling of stand basal area as fire
was excluded in ponderosa pine-Douglas-fir stands. Parker
(1988) found nearly double the basal area in stands where
fire was excluded as species diameter-class distributions
went from even aged to uneven aged in mountain hemlock
and red fir stands. Most literature sources contend that pro-
ductivity will tend to decline after a stand reaches maturity
as old-growth stands photosynthesize only enough carbon
to meet respirative demands (O’Laughlin 1995). However,
this assumes the same tree species is present throughout
stand development. Callaway and others (1998) found up-
per subalpine sites dominated by seral whitebark pine
reached peak productivities at around 150 years. But, pro-
ductivity decreased only slightly as subalpine fir trees re-
placed whitebark pine in the stand because the fir’s thin sap-
wood layer reduced stemwood respiration and allowed the
stand to maintain high productivities into the latter stages
of succession. Nevertheless, tree vigor will tend to decrease
as stands of shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant species be-
come dense and stagnated as resources become limiting
(O’Laughlin 1998). Moreover, thinning by periodic fire
tended to concentrate productivity in fewer, but larger indi-
viduals, thereby resulting in larger stems for a wider variety
of wood products and a higher percent utilization (Harvey
and others 1989; O’Laughlin 1995).
Air quality has improved, somewhat, at the expense of
ecosystem sustainability with fire exclusion policies (Brown
and Bradshaw 1994; Covington and others 1994). Less
smoke from summer fires lowers atmospheric particulate
levels, improves visibility, and decreases natural pollution,
but this may only be a short-term advantage. However,
Figure 2—Annual area burned is increasing despite recent
advances and increases in fire suppression technology
and resources.

Brown and Bradshaw (1994) found similar smoke pollu-
tion in the era of total fire exclusion (1930 to 1970) to that
generated during the prescribed natural fire period (1971 to
1992) for the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area. Mutch
(1994) and Leenhouts (1998) noted that smoke produced
from uncontrolled wildfires occurring on fire-excluded land-
scapes may greatly exceed historical levels, and these high
smoke emissions may be more harmful to people than smoke
released from a prescribed burning program. The worst
smoke pollution in recent times was from unusually severe
fires burning on Columbia River Basin fire-excluded land-
scapes that historically experienced lower severity fire re-
gimes (Ottmar and others 1996). Moreover, less smoke does
not mean less carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere.
Computer simulations by Keane and others (1997) showed
an increase in atmospheric CO2 inputs from fire-excluded
landscapes due to the increased autotrophic and het-
erotrophic respiration with advancing succession. At a con-
tinental scale, the cumulative effects of this high atmospheric
CO2 input from respiration could have profound effects in
global climate warming.
Landscape-Level Effects
Composition and Structure
Historical fire regimes created shifting mosaics of
patches, processes, and habitats on Rocky Mountain land-
scapes (Agee 1993; Romme 1982; Swanson and others
1990). These landscapes tend to become more homogeneous
as fire is removed because succession will eventually ad-
vance all stands to similar communities dominated by shade-
tolerant species (fig. 1e,f,g,h) (Keane and others 1996, 1997;
Marsden 1983; Turner and others 1994). Even though late
seral species may differ across a landscape depending on
site, the multilayer structures of these late seral stands are
nearly identical across most biophysical settings (Oliver and
Larson 1990). Habeck (1970) noted that fire control on Gla-
cier National Park landscapes resulted in shifts of young
and intermediate-aged forests to older forests where com-
munities less than 10 years old were rare. Arno and others
(1993) and Hartwell (1997) measured declines of whitebark
pine and young lodgepole pine stands and increases in sub-
alpine fir after 91 years on a fire-excluded Northern Rocky
Mountain subalpine landscape. Rogeau (1996) reported
shifts to older age classes in Banff National Park. McKenzie
and others (1996) constructed transition pathways from the
current landscape with fire exclusion to a future landscape
with increased fire intensity for the conterminous United
States and found that increased fire activity could actually
decrease broad-scale landscape diversity by increasing the
extent of grassland and shrubland types.
Landscape structure (spatial distribution of patches) also
changes with fire exclusion as landscapes generally become
less fragmented, have lower patch density, and evolve de-
creased patch diversity, which often results in more conta-
gion, corridors, and large patches (Hann 1990; Hessburg
and others 1999; Keane and others 1998; Li and others 1996)
(fig. 1g,h). Romme (1982) found that fire control policies
tended to reduce landscape richness and patchiness, and to
increase evenness and dominance in Yellowstone National
Park, but there were situations where the exclusion of fire
actually increased landscape diversity. Murray (1996) found
that the lack of fire created high-elevation landscapes with
low diversity, high mean patch size, and high fractal dimen-
sion indices. This creates an interesting situation because
larger patches and high homogeneity tend to foster more
continuous crown and surface fuels, which can then burn in
large fires that create still larger patches and so on in this
downward “fire-exclusion” spiral. Baker (1992) found lower
fractal dimension, mean shape, Shannon diversity, and patch
richness on simulated landscapes with suppression of all
fires as compared to landscapes with intact historical fire
regimes.
The effect of fire exclusion on patch dynamics depends
on the biophysical complexity of the landscape. Often, ter-
rain and landforms, rather than disturbance history, will be
the primary factor determining patch dynamics in heavily
dissected landscapes (Kushla and Ripple 1997; Li and oth-
ers1996; Swanson and others 1990). This is because com-
plex landforms create unique and diverse environments that
partially control the structure and composition of the poten-
tial and existing vegetation (Daubenmire 1966; Pfister and
others 1977). But more importantly, fire behavior and growth
are heavily influenced by slope, elevation, and aspect, so
fire patterns tend to follow topographic landforms
(Rothermel 1972, 1991). As a result, it is difficult to gen-
eralize about changes in landscape structure with fire exclu-
sion without knowing the degree of topographic complexity.
Hydrology
Landscape hydrologic cycles can be altered as late seral
communities progressively dominate landscapes without
fires (Covington and others 1994). Higher leaf areas from
increased woody biomass will increase evapotranspiration
and interception (table 1), resulting in lower streamflows
and the drying of springs (Gruell 1979; Romme 1982;
Troendle and Kaufmann 1987). This would limit the amount
of water available for irrigation and community water sup-
plies, especially during the late summer and early autumn.
Fire exclusion generally reduces soil water and overland
flow thereby reducing surface erosion, mass movement, and
sediment yield, depending on geomorphic landforms
(Swanson 1981). Warskow (1978) demonstrated the criti-
cal role of fire in regulating surface and ground-water pro-
duction in southwestern ponderosa pine forests. Link and
others (1990) found range fires removed deep-rooted, woody
shrub species from a shrub-steppe ecosystems thereby elimi-
nating the ability of the vegetation to access deeply stored
soil water, making more available for human use. Pielke
and others (1997) simulated accelerated thunderstorm de-
velopment and turbulence with increasing landscape het-
erogeneity indicating vastly different rainfall patterns on

fire-dominated landscapes (Pielke and Avissar 1990). Clark
(1989) measured more positive water balances on landscapes
with fire.
Fire-excluded landscapes are especially vulnerable to ad-
verse changes in the hydrology when stand-replacement
wildfires inevitably occur. Severe fires that burn in heavily
grazed forested stands that are outside historical fire fre-
quencies may cause excessive erosion that degrades water
quality and aquatic habitat (Covington and others 1994;
Tiedemann and others 1979). Snowmelt may be faster from
the larger patches created by modern wildfires resulting in
earlier and higher spring runoffs. Peak flows usually increase
severalfold after large, intense wildfires (Dennis 1989;
Tiedemann and others 1979), which would presumably in-
crease surface and mass erosion (Covington and others
1994). The increased vegetation cover near streams on fire-
excluded landscapes would probably decrease stream water
temperatures, increase long-term inputs of coarse woody
debris to streams, and delay and reduce peak runoffs
(Dennis 1989). However, when wildfires eventually occur
on these protected watercourses, their high severity can re-
duce shading, increase erosion, and increase water tempera-
tures by 3 to 10 oC depending on streamflow (Amaranthus
and others 1989).
Cross-Scale Disturbance Effects
Fire
Perhaps the most important ecosystem process altered
by fire exclusion is the native fire regime (Arno and Brown
1991; Covington and others 1994; Morgan and others 1998;
Mutch and others 1993). Fires generally become less fre-
quent and more severe with active suppression on the land-
scape (Arno and others 1993; Loope and Gruell 1973; Steele
and others 1986). Modern wildfires on late seral landscapes
tend to be larger, more intense, and more severe because of
high biomass loadings, multilayer stand structures, and the
high connectivity of the biomass at the stand and landscape
level (Arno and Brown 1991; Keane and others 1997; Knight
1987). Moreover, only the unusually severe wildfires es-
cape our suppression efforts in our present de facto exclu-
sion policy (Arno and Brown 1989; Brown 1995). Covington
and others (1994) state “the end result of fire exclusion in
fire-prone forests is increasingly synchronous landscapes
dominated by large, catastrophic disturbance regimes.”
There is a close inverse relationship between available
fuel and mean fire frequency, so fire return intervals tend
to increase with increasing fuels, and with increasing fu-
els comes increasing fire severities (Olsen 1981). Romme
and Despain (1989) mentioned that the principal effect
of 30 years of fire exclusion in Yellowstone National Park
was to delay the onset of a major fire event, which was
inevitable.
Fires on fire-altered landscapes may burn more area in
fewer years, meaning that rare fire years, like 1910, may be
especially high in fire activity (Bessie and Johnson 1995).
And the increasing numbers of large, severe fires in 1 fire
year will make suppression and control increasingly diffi-
cult further risking human life and property. This is again
illustrated in figure 2 where the area burned has recently
been increasing despite continually higher suppression
efforts and technology. Few fire years will also tend to
create less diversity in patch age and size because large
areas tend to burn in 1 year, as demonstrated by the
Yellowstone fires of 1988 (Baker 1989; Romme and
Despain 1989).
High surface fuel loads and complex vertical stand struc-
tures increase the chance that modern surface fires will be-
come crown fires and burn overstory trees through torching
and crowning (Brown and Bevins 1986; Kolb and others
1998; Steele 1994). Early seral tree crowns tend to be heat
porous and high off the ground while late seral trees have
dense crowns extending nearly the entire length of the stem
(Minore 1979). Higher flame lengths due to more surface
fuels, coupled with lower and thicker shade-tolerant tree
crowns, hasten the transition of a surface fire to a crown
fire. Once a crown fire has started, the high leaf areas and
high crown bulk densities typical of late seral forests favor
propagation of fire throughout the crowns in a stand (Brown
and others 1994; Rothermel 1991). Furthermore, these crown
fires are likely to be propagated across the homogenous land-
scapes because high contagion between multilayered stands
ensures high connectivity in crown fuels. Taylor and others
(1998) estimated fire behavior potential changes using the
frequency of three crown fire severity and six fire intensity
classes on a southeastern British Columbia landscape dur-
ing a climatologically normal fire season. The proportion
of the landscape susceptible to a fire with more than 50 per-
cent crown consumption increased from 7 to 14 percent from
1952 to 1992, and projected that proportion to increase to
29 percent by 2032. Therefore, the long-term consequences
of fire exclusion in Rocky Mountain ecosystems is the con-
version of historically low- to moderate-severity fire regimes
to a high-severity, stand-replacement fire regime (Mutch
1994; Morgan and others 1998).
Land use changes on the Rocky Mountain landscape have
also altered the ignition and spread patterns of historical
fires. Barrett and others (1997) noted the majority of his-
torical area burned occurred in sagebrush-grasslands that
have now been altered and interrupted by agriculture, graz-
ing, and land development. Fires burning through these
rangelands often gained access to adjacent forest lands
prior to European settlement and livestock grazing. Now,
the continuity of fine fuels across these nonforest range-
lands has been reduced or eliminated because of human
land use activities such as development, agriculture, and
grazing.
Insects and Disease
Insect and disease processes are also affected by the shift
in host tree species across a landscape as fires are suppressed.
Increases in insect and disease activity are attributed mostly

USDA Forest Service RMRS GTR-91. 2002
15
to increased stress and reduced vigor of the early seral, fire-
dependent tree species (Heinrichs 1988; Hessburg and
others 1994; Kolb and others 1998). This plant stress is a
direct result of the increased competition from rising stand
biomass and ballooning plant density (Harvey 1994, 1998;
O’Laughlin 1998). Stressed plants and dense canopies are
usually a recipe for severe insect and disease infestations
(Heinrichs 1988). Harvey (1994) recognized that ecosys-
tems with intact fire regimes have lower levels of plant stress,
which reduces insect and disease infestations.
There are many examples of heightened insect and dis-
ease activity with fire suppression (Veblen and others 1994).
Dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium spp.) has proliferated on
landscapes with more older age classes resulting from fire
exclusion especially in lodgepole pine and ponderosa pine
(Alexander and Hawksworth 1976; Wilson and Tkacz
1996; Zimmerman and Laven 1984). The absence of fire
is implicated in chronic spruce budworm (Choristoneura
occidentalis) epidemics in many Douglas-fir and true fir
stands in the Rockies (Carlson and others 1983; Hadley and
Veblen 1993; Holland 198; Swetnam and Lynch 1993). Per-
sistent defoliation by budworm outbreak can predispose host
trees to Douglas-fir beetle (Dendroctonus pseudotsugae) and
root rots. Bark and pine beetle and blister rust epidemics
are replaced by root rot and fir decline diseases as the land-
scape converts from whitebark pine to subalpine fir and
spruce cover types (Arno and Hoff 1989; Alexander and
others 1990). Mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus
ponderosae), bark beetles, and dwarf mistletoe outbreaks
are more common in southwestern ponderosa pine forests
because tree densities increased due to lack of fire
(Covington and others 1994). In spruce-fir forests of
Colorado, spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) out-
breaks do not affect young (less than 80 years) postfire
stands (Veblen and others 1994), which implies that long-
term fire exclusion in the subalpine zone eventually would
result in increased beetle activity as a larger portion of
the landscape enters old-growth stages. However, it is
debatable if fire suppression can actually prevent the in-
frequent but widespread fires of the subalpine zone that
are associated with unusual weather events (Romme and
Despain 1989).
Increased patch contagion from lack of fire may amplify
the severity of insect and pathogen outbreaks. Contagion is
generally described as the probability that similar patches
are adjacent to each other. Landscapes dominated by one
cover type seem to have the greatest potential for epidemic
infestations of insects and disease because host species
patches are near and migration distances are small. Con-
versely, patchy landscapes under native fire regimes often
had greater probabilities of nonhost patches being barriers
to pathogen dispersal. Research by Hessburg and others
(1994) showed increases in budworm and tussock moth as
the host tree species become more continuous across the
landscape. Increased bark beetle outbreaks have been re-
ported in many pine ecosystems where fires have been ex-
cluded (Wilson and Tkacz 1996).
Affected Rocky Mountain Ecosystems
The complex effects of fire exclusion are best understood
when illustrated by examples. We selected several keystone
Rocky Mountain ecosystems where fires were historically
common but now have experienced several decades of fire
exclusion (deMaynadier and Hunter 1997; Ferry and others
1995). Not all forest and range types are discussed because
of lack of space, but it is estimated the ecosystems presented
here comprise over 60 percent of Rocky Mountain lands
(Ferry and others 1995).
The absence of fire on many Rocky Mountain grassland
ecosystems usually resulted in the invasion of woody spe-
cies (Arno and Gruell 1986). Historical grassland fire re-
turn intervals ranged anywhere from 2 to 27 years depend-
ing on topography and native American settlement, and have
increased to over 27 years in many places because of devel-
opment and fire suppression (Gruell 1986; Higgins and oth-
ers1991; Seig 1997; Wright and Bailey 1982). Arno and
Gruell (1986) found frequently occurring fires prior to 1890
tended to favor grasslands and confined tree establishment
to rocky areas or topographically moist sites, but grazing
and fire exclusion has allowed extensive areas of inland
Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii v. glauca) invasion into
mountain grasslands. Fisher and others (1986) found an ex-
pansion of closed ponderosa pine forests at the expense of
pine savannas and grasslands after 50 years of fire exclu-
sion. Shinn (1980) documented how the association of fire
with the deterioration of range resources by the public led
to fire exclusion policies that resulted in juniper invasion
and herbland decline in grass and shrublands of the Central
Rockies. Conifer encroachment into montane sagebrush
grasslands has resulted from delayed fire activity (Patten
1969).
Sagebrush-steppe ecosystems, encompassing some 45
million ha in the Western United States, typically burned at
60- to 110-year intervals prior to European settlement. How-
ever, fire frequency has increased in many areas due to the
invasion of cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) and medusahead
Taeniatherum caput-medusae) (West and Hassan 1985;
Whisenant 1990). Cheatgrass could expand from currently
6.8 million ha to over 25 million ha in the Great Basin (Ferry
and others 1995). This increase in fire frequency would ex-
ert strong selective pressure against many native plants and
animals.
Juniper and pinyon pine woodlands have been increas-
ing in density and distribution since the early 1900s due to
climate change, grazing, and most importantly, lack of fire
(Gottfried and others 1995). The expansion is mostly into
grass and shrublands (Ferry and others 1995). Bunting
(1994) mentioned that the advance of juniper woodlands
would have been curbed if the historical fire regime with
50-year fire-return intervals had not been altered by graz-
ing, climate change, and wildfire suppression.
Aspen (Populus tremuloidies) is a short-lived, broadleaf
tree species (100 to 125 years) that is seral to conifers in
much of its nearly 3 million ha range in the Western United

16
USDA Forest Service RMRS GTR-91. 2002
States (DeByle and Winokur 1985). It is maintained by pe-
riodic mixed- to high-severity fires that kill most trees and
allow aspen to regenerate from root suckers. The lack of
fire has allowed the encroachment and dominance of coni-
fers in many aspen stands. Restoration of fire is compli-
cated by the fact that, today, aspen is becoming scarce and
has poor vigor. On some landscapes, aspen is so rare that
ungulates will concentrate in regenerating aspen stands to
eat the high-quality aspen suckers, thereby preventing suck-
ers from becoming trees.
Ponderosa pine forests occur on approximately 16 mil-
lion ha in the Western United States. These low- and mid-
elevation forests were historically maintained as grassy,
parklike stands by frequent (2- to 40-year average fire re-
turn intervals), low-severity surface fires that killed many
seedlings of its competitors, namely inland Douglas-fir and
other true firs (fig. 1a) (Allen and others 1998; Arno and
others 1995; Bogan and others 1999; Covington and Moore
1994). Removal of fire in these forests has created multiple-
storied, dense forests that have a greater potential for stand-
replacement fires (fig. 1b) (Steele and others 1986). Crown
fires were historically rare in these forests, yet several Idaho
fires in the 1980s and 1990s were active crown fires that
burned large areas (USDA Forest Service 1993). Ponderosa
pine forests in the Southern Rockies have been severely al-
tered by the combined effects of heavy grazing, logging,
and fire exclusion (Covington and Moore 1994; Fulé  and
others 1997). Historically, rare crown fires are now com-
mon in today’s southwestern ponderosa pine forests, and
these fires tend to be larger, more severe, and less com-
mon (Covington and Moore 1994; Swetnam and Baisan
1996). Tree density has experienced an almost tenfold
increase, and basal areas have nearly doubled from 1883
to 1994 (Fulé and others 1997). Litter and duff depths
have thickened by 200 percent, and woody fuels have
also increased.
Although the effects of fire exclusion are not readily evi-
dent on lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) landscapes, this for-
est type deserves mention because of its large range (4 mil-
lion ha in the Rockies) and management implications in most
of the Rocky Mountains (Romme 1982). Franklin and Laven
(1990) recognized two types of fires occur in lodgepole pine
forests: surface and crown fires. Crown fires killed all spe-
cies but gave colonization advantage to the serotinous lodge-
pole pine. Surface fires only scarred lodgepole but killed
most subalpine fir and spruce thereby delaying succession
(Brown 1973). However, Brown and others (1995) found
the majority of stand-replacement fire in lodgepole pine was
actually severe surface fires. Fire exclusion has converted
some forests from lodgepole pine to fir and spruce. In
addition, some stand structures have gone from single-
age or diameter-class dominance (even aged) to multiple
age and diameter classes (unevenaged). As a result, these
lodgepole pine stands are currently experiencing heavy
infestations of mountain pine beetle, dwarf mistletoe, and
root diseases (Alexander and Hawksworth 1976; Romme
1982; Zimmerman and Laven 1984).
Fire regimes in high-elevation whitebark pine forests,
which occupy around 1 million ha in the Rocky Mountains,
are typically described as mixed severity occurring at 80- to
500-year intervals (Arno 1980; Keane and others 1994). Al-
though whitebark pine is long lived (more than 400 years),
it is eventually replaced by subalpine fir and spruce without
fire. Encroachment of subalpine fir into seral whitebark pine
stands creates multilayered canopies with low crown base
heights and high crown bulk densities, increasing the chance
of stand-replacement fires (Murray and others 1995). The
long-term consequence of fire exclusion in whitebark pine
ecosystems is the conversion of a mixed-severity fire re-
gime to a stand-replacement fire regime (Arno and others
1993; Loope and Gruell 1973; Hartwell 1997). Fires in this
new regime will tend to be larger and more intense (Keane
and others 1997). Effects of fire exclusion have recently
been accelerated by the introduction of the exotic disease
white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola), which has dev-
astated many whitebark pine stands in the Northern Rockies,
resulting in landscapes with abnormally high coverages of
subalpine fir types (Keane and others 1994).
What’s Next?
Restoration of some semblance of the native fire regimes
seems a critical step toward improving the health of many
Rocky Mountain ecosystems. However, there are problems.
First, the immensity of any Rockies restoration effort is
somewhat daunting considering projected future fires would
need to burn from 3 to 7 times more than present. The 70
years of fire suppression have caused usually high live and
dead fuel accumulations in many stands that, when ignited,
would create a fire that would be abnormally severe and
kill most of the trees (Mutch 1994). So, reintroduction of
fire must be done carefully to prevent further damage to the
stressed old-growth trees and other ecosystem components
(Arno and others 1995). Developing a fire prescription (in
other words, a set of weather conditions in which to burn)
to minimize fire intensity but still accomplish restoration
objectives is problematic because the high fuel loadings may
preclude the implementation of a low-severity burn
(Covington and Moore 1994). In addition, land management
agencies are limited in conducting the extensive restoration
treatments that are needed because of competing govern-
mental regulations (for example, smoke, Endangered Spe-
cies Act) and the high cost of implementation from envi-
ronmental assessments to executing treatments. Despite
these challenges, a functional restoration program is pos-
sible and necessary (Arno and Brown 1991; Babbit 1995;
Brown 1995; Hardy and Arno 1996; Harvey 1998; Parsons
and Landres 1998).
Many believe silvicultural cuttings are the only feasible
method to remove some combustible biomass and thereby
reducing fire intensities so fire severity will be similar to
historical events (Arno and others 1995; Covington and
Moore 1994). Baker (1992) felt that landscapes altered by
settlement and fire suppression cannot be restored using only

USDA Forest Service RMRS GTR-91. 2002
17
the traditional methods of prescribed burning. Moreover,
fire restoration cannot be done with just one or two pre-
scribed burns or silvicultural treatments. Some field and
simulation studies have shown that it may take as many as
50 to 75 years or at least two and as many as seven fire
treatments or rotations to restore native fire regimes to stands
and landscapes where fire has been excluded (Baker 1993,
1994; Keane and others 1997). Additionally, it may take
more than one treatment to accomplish the objectives for
one prescribed burn. For example, it may take two low-
severity prescribed burns to achieve 90-percent mortality
in shade-tolerant species for a stand. Site-specific studies
and careful monitoring of the consequences of prescribed burn-
ing are essential to obtain goals related to ecosystem restora-
tion. Even for ponderosa pine ecosystems, the role of surface
versus stand-replacing fires in the pre-1900 fire regime is some-
times a contentious issue (Shinneman and Baker 1997).
The role of fire will continue to change in the Rocky
Mountains as we continue to exclude fires from landscapes.
It is not a question of “if” a landscape will burn, but rather,
when it burns, how severe that fire will be. There are pro-
found consequences of altered fire regimes as summarized
in table 1. Fires occurring on fire-excluded landscapes will
generate significantly different effects compared with ef-
fects of pre-1900 historical fires. Modern fires will be large
and severe, killing more plants and altering many ecosys-
tem processes. Bessie and Johnson (1995) point out that fires
occurring in subalpine forests during severe weather years
burn the most land area because wind coupled with exces-
sive drought, and not fuels, drive these fires. Extreme fire
years, such as 1910, 1987, 1994, and 1996, will tend to burn
most plant communities regardless of fuels or ecosystem health,
but the severity of these burns at the stand- and landscape-
level will be dictated by the fuel loadings. One can only
wonder what would happen if the extreme weather condi-
tions of 1910 occurred today on our fire-excluded landscapes
of the Rocky Mountains.

The Rocky Mountain Research Station develops
scientific information and technology to improve management,
protection, and use of the forests and rangelands. Research
is designed to meet the needs of National Forest managers,
Federal and State agencies, public and private organizations,
academic institutions, industry, and individuals.
Studies accelerate solutions to problems involving
ecosystems, range, forests, water, recreation, fire, resource
inventory, land reclamation, community sustainability, forest
engineering technology, multiple use economics, wildlife and
fish habitat, and forest insects and diseases. Studies are
conducted cooperatively, and applications may be found
worldwide.
