Working Paper 40:
Resources for Predicting and
Mitigating Smoke Impacts of
Wildland Fires
 
Resources for Predicting and
Mitigating Smoke Impacts of
Wildland Fires 
Our new working paper highlights the tools and
resources available to assess and forecast
smoke timing and duration from wild and
managed ﬁres. The Wildland Fire Air Quality
Response Program’s modeling tools, along with
technical specialists like Air Resource Advisors
(ARAs), assist agencies in managing ﬁre
incidents and predicting and messaging smoke
impacts. The working paper describes how ARAs
use these resources to build a toolkit for ﬁre
management operations and improved public
communication.
