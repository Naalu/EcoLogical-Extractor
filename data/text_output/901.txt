ABSTRACT 
 
POWER DYNAMICS AT MULTIPLE SCALES IN COLLABORATIVE FOREST 
MANAGEMENT: ANALYSIS OF THE FOUR FOREST RESTORATION 
INITIATIVE 
 
WINDY GREER 
 
Collaboration implies some degree of power sharing between multiple parties. 
Power and its dynamics can be identified at multiple scales in the collaborative efforts of 
landscape forest restoration management. The Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI) 
provides a case study of power in collaboration to improve our understanding of the 
multiple and indeterminate interactions among stakeholders, involving dynamics of 
power, conflict, and competition as well as collaboration and institutional innovation. 
This study uses qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews, participant observation and 
secondary documents to analyze power dynamics in the organizational governance of 
4FRI at multiple levels both internal and external to a collaborative group and across 
time. The analysis identified locations of power in the 4FRI, dynamics of power, and the 
outcomes of power. Results reveal that power plays a central role in specific operational 
rules or the details of how this collaborative effort pursues common interests. The 
dynamics of power ebb and flow as stakeholders in this high profile collaboration 
navigate power dynamics through collaboration and competition across a time scale. 
Utilizing the total power of a collaborative group through robust consensus decision 
making and clear mechanisms to support these to collectively influence decision 
authority is more effective than competing for that influence. Likewise, governmental 

3 
 
policies are outdated mechanisms that stifle the agency’s ability to rely on outside 
resources to enhance its power and legitimacy in collaboration with its partners. Overall, 
interdependency among stakeholders and between the agency and stakeholder group is 
the greatest form of power in the collaborative process.

Chapter 1:  Introduction 
 
Power dynamics in collaborative forest restoration can be identified across 
multiple structural scales. Collaboration in forest landscape restoration is fundamentally 
about working together through shared power in decision-making in a process through 
which multiple stakeholders jointly explore diverse values and interests and attempt to 
come to some level of agreement about appropriate forest management (Lowe and 
Moote, 2005). The role of power sharing in collaboration is enhancing collective 
cohesiveness and interdependency across diverse and sometimes conflicting interests to 
achieve shared goals. Moving from competition to collaboration, actors increase the 
ability to influence total power of the collaborative effort by combining resources, 
navigating multiple competing goals and interest, identifying gaps in information, and 
producing a set of recommendations likely to reduce workload and planning barriers for 
agencies (Agrawal and Ribot, 1999).  According to the Council on Environmental 
Quality (CEQ) Collaborating in NEPA Handbook (CEQ, 2009), “By engaging relevant 
expertise, including scientific and technical expertise, and knowledge of a local resource, 
a collaborative body can reach a more informed agreement and advise decision-makers 
accordingly.” The CEQ Handbook (2009) further states that benefits of collaboration 
include a fairer process, improved fact-finding, increased social-capital, enhanced 
environmental stewardship and reduced litigation.   
In ideal collaboration, visions are shared and goals are unambiguous and 
uncontested. However, natural resource planning situations can be typified by competing 
interests, a lack of scientific agreement, limited time, imbalance in resources, and 

11 
 
structural inequities in the access to information and the distribution of political power 
(Lachapelle et al., 2003). 
Power in collaborative forest restoration is expressed in the “multiple and 
indeterminate interactions among individual stakeholders” (McCay, 2002) and the inter-
organizational dynamics and institutional arrangements (Agrawal and Gibson, 1999) that 
constrain and enable actors through shared resources, power and authority.  Examining 
power dynamics internal and external to a collaborative effort can empower stakeholders 
and the agencies they work with to navigate toward their main objective.  
The Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI) is the largest collaborative forest 
restoration effort currently underway in the U.S. and subsequently challenges the current 
model of institutional governance in landscape forest restoration management. The 4FRI 
reflects a broader trend whereby multiple stakeholders collaboratively define goals, 
priorities and, in some cases, allocation of budgetary and programmatic resources of 
federal land management agencies. Much more than public involvement in an agency-
initiated project proposal, this collaborative may be defining a new governance approach 
for federal land management at fairly large geographic scales. 4FRI offers an opportunity 
to gain empirical evidence of power and power dynamics in collaboration to improve our 
understanding of power in conflict and competition as well as power in collaboration and 
institutional innovation.  
This case study was designed to qualitatively analyze power dynamics in the 
organizational governance of 4FRI at multiple structural levels both internal and external 
to a collaborative forest restoration group. Focus of the analysis was on identifying 1) 
internal and external sources of power 2) power dynamics, and 3) outcomes resulting 

12 
 
from these power dynamics. The research results demonstrate how stakeholders in this 
high profile effort navigate power dynamics in a new landscape scale experiment of 
forest governance. This research contributes to providing a model for future landscape 
scale collaborative efforts understanding the role of power in conflict and collaborative 
assessments. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Chapter 2: Literature Review 
The literature that supports theories of power in collaboration is rich and spans 
many decades. It is articulated through classic and current approaches that define power 
and identify sources and scales of power. Literature also offers a unique perspective into 

13 
 
a cynical view of power collaboration in forest restoration management. This review 
offers a brief insight into each of these theoretical and practical approaches.  
Collaboration is a process of joint decision-making in a problem domain directed 
towards the future of that domain (Bouwen and Taillieu, 2004). Collaboration starts from 
an under-organized state, where individuals act independently, towards a more tightly 
organized relationship, characterized by concerted decision-making (Bouwen and 
Taillieu, 2004). Collaboration relies on relationships between parties and not solely on 
the influence of one over another (Daniels, Walker 2001) where a diversity of many types 
of actors with differing knowledge will broaden the collective knowledge base and 
increase the capacity of innovation” (Folk et al., 2005).   
Research on collaboration in forest partnerships typically focuses on collaborative 
successes or failures. Few empirical studies have explored the working of power in the 
field (Raik et al., 2008) or to the processes engaged within these dynamic partnerships 
(Arevalo, Ros-Tonen, 2009). Yet, collaboration in forest restoration and management is 
infused with issues of access, control, rights, ownership and use- issues of power (Raik et 
al., 2008).  Among ongoing negotiations that occur with each goal, objective and 
deadline is an assertion of power that requires persistent navigation (Walker and Hurley, 
2004) and clarification of power (Daniels and Walker 2001) to reduce to overconfident, 
defensive, or domineering behaviors during the collaborative process (Purdy, 2012). 
Collaboration locates control and power in the parties and their negotiation process 
(Daniels and Walker 2001) involving a joint decision making approach in which power is 
shared and stakeholders take collective responsibility for their actions and the subsequent 
consequences or outcomes of those actions (Selin and Chavez, 1994).  

14 
 
Power Defined 
 
         The definition of power has been the source of scholarly debate over many decades 
(Dahl, 1957; Emerson, 1962; Isaac, 1987), ranging from power as actor-specific 
resources used in the pursuit of self-interests (ctd. in Fuchs, 2005) to power as ‘the 
capacity of a social system to mobilize resources to realize collective goals’ (Parsons, 
1967:193). Power has been defined as a way of influencing the means to obtain some 
future apparent good (Barber, 1998) or as the “measure of an entity’s ability to realize its 
goals (i.e., ‘power to’) as well as the ability to control the behavior of other entities (i.e., 
‘power over’)” (Egan et al., 2011) or the ability to sanction participation of stakeholders 
who might otherwise be marginalized (i.e. ‘power for’) (Purdy, 2012). Power has also 
been defined as the authority to create rules and make decisions (Agrawal and Ribot, 
1999). Raik et al. (2008) defined power as not merely a matter of control over active 
decision making but also as inaction and exclusion of agenda items (2008). The authority 
to make rules defines who has the right to access, use, and conserve resources and 
exclude others from carrying out these activities (Agrawal and Gibson, 1999). Coercion, 
the “first dimension of power”, was defined by Lukes (2005) as the power one actor has 
over another (A over B) to get that actor to do something he or she would not otherwise 
do. Bacharach and Baratz (1962) defined constraint, the “second dimension” of power as 
one actor’s ability to constrain the actions or possible actions of another actor to ensure 
inaction.  A third dimension of power defines power as a social structure production of 
consent and norms (Clegg, 1989), where societal forces shape individual preferences and 
this shaping process works to justify and maintain current systems of power (Raik at al., 
2008; Lukes, 2005).  

15 
 
 
These definitions of power offer explanations of power as action, attitude or 
ability. To seek further understanding of power, especially in the context of institutional 
arrangements, one must look to locate sources of power or where power originates.   
Sources of Power 
 
Past research identifies sources of power as the objective, individual level 
resources each party brings to the negotiating table (alternatives); the perceptions of those 
individual-level resources (reflected in aspirations); and the relative power between the 
parties (differences across alternatives) (Wolfe and McGinn, 2005). 
 
Individuals and organizations can use objective components of power in the 
resources they bring into the collaboration (Bachrach and Lawler, 2012) such as 
personnel, knowledge, skills, legal authority, or money, to exert influence over others 
(Skarlicki and Folger, 1997). An organization’s ability to provide abundant or highly 
valued resources, as well as who is involved and to what degree will inevitably influence 
the outcome of the planning process (Brody, 2003).  Resources provide organizations 
with the ability to collect, share, and interpret information about the issues and topics 
under discussion and may influence the number able to participate and how well-
informed or expert participants are (Purdy, 2012). Wolfe and McGinn (2005) suggested 
that perceptions of relative power and alternatives affected the integrativeness of 
outcomes. Power is not isolated but rather members legitimize one another through a 
belief that there is a legitimate right to exert influence and an obligation to accept that 
influence (Gravenhorst and Mundate, 2003).  Sometimes the nature of legitimizing an 
individual’s influence and that individual’s reliance upon that legitimacy can create a 
cynical dynamic among collaborating parties.  

16 
 
Cynical View of Power Uses in Forest Restoration Management 
 
Forest management or restoration projects tend to generate heated conflict as they 
involve multiple stakeholders (Elias et al., 2004) with differing worldviews and 
competing demands.  Collaboration may be viewed by some groups as a different means 
of handling competition (Amy, 1987) or an opportunity to enhance power through a new 
venue; where if they are unable to serve their own interests they may undermine the 
entire collaborative (Walker and Hurley, 2004). Collaboration may be viewed as a 
discursive battlefield where the bid for power increases from each player involved, where 
power balances at given moments act as resources strategically used by actors to pursue 
their interests (Arevalo and Ros-Tonen, 2009). Participants may deploy tactics to thwart 
or suppress a manifest challenge to the values or interests of a decision-maker (Raik et 
al., 2008) or other stakeholder interests. Walker and Hurley (2004) found that people who 
view each other as adversaries do not forsake competition when they enter a 
collaborative. To the extent their power allows, participants can be expected to control 
the collaborative process to their advantage (2004).  
Theories of Power 
 
Theories of power have become voluminous as they evolved through time. To 
narrow the focus, I have selected theories of power most closely related to collective 
processes. I focus this discussion on relational power, interdependence, individual power 
and power in the field of forest restoration and management.   
 
Relational power stems from the positive correlations between cooperation and 
power that contradict the common, implicit assumption that power occurs only in 
competition (Tjosvold, 2008). By working together, stakeholders can expand the human 

17 
 
and financial resources required for restoration (Lowe and Moote, 2003). Diversifying a 
stakeholder group will broaden the collective knowledge base and increase the capacity 
of innovation (Folk et al.2005). Members legitimize themselves and other individuals’ or 
organizations’ authority by their level of contribution to the overall collective goals. 
According to Prell et al. (2009), actors who share a strong tie with one another tend to 
share influence on one another, share similar views, and communicate effectively 
regarding complex information and have a stronger likelihood of sharing trust. Moreover, 
among players, blending of multi-sectoral interests involves elements of public-private 
partnerships that increase cooperation, leading to higher instances of self-governance and 
cooperation (Ostrom & Walker, 2002).   
 
An Interdependence view of power can be characterized by an exchange of 
sources of power between two actors (Lawler and Yoon, 1996). Sources of power can be 
used to advance the joint efforts of collaborators, resulting in mutual gain (Purdy, 2012) 
where members invest resources to innovate and change the structure itself in order to 
improve joint outcomes (Ostrom,1998) thereby increasing the collaborative potential. 
Interdependence can be expressed through the establishment of coalitions where 
members of a social unit nurture a sense of belonging, and share distinctive values, goals 
and resources and enhance discursive legitimacy between coalitions (Apreda, 2007; 
Purdy, 2012).  
 
Individual power has been defined as a person’s motivation to acquire power or 
individual traits, to increase the likelihood of attaining positions of power (Wolfe and 
McGinn 2005). Individual influence may be employed competitively for personal gain, or 
it may be endorsed by others as a resource for the collective. One framework for selecting 

18 
 
individual participants in collaboration ranks candidates by urgency, legitimacy, and 
power (Billgren and Holmen, 2007). In this instance, individual power is represented by 
variations in stakeholder interactions and their ability to communicate differences.   
 
Total power can be defined as the sum of actors’ resources and capabilities 
(Lawler et al., 1988). When resources of individuals are combined into the collective 
whole, the group’s overall authority and influence increases (Sandstrom, 2009).  They 
also include better representation of the interests of disadvantaged and powerless groups 
in governmental decision making and the contributions of participation to citizenship 
(Brody, 2003). It has been argued that citizen participation can act as powerful leverage 
for generating trust, credibility, and commitment to the adoption of agency policies 
(Innes 1996). Brody (2003) suggests that total power is achieved when collaboration with 
stakeholder groups and agencies is emphasized. Brody further emphasizes that tools and 
strategies are more focused and inclusive and include more incentive-based policies, 
better monitoring tools and as a result, implementation sections of the forest management 
plan would provide greater accountability, flexibility, and enforcement of policies. It has 
been hypothesized that as total power increases, competitive incentives decrease, and the 
collaborative potential becomes greater (Daniels and Walker, 2001).  
Power in Forest Restoration & Management 
 
Collaboration in forest restoration and management extends across multiple and 
sometimes competing interested parties, agencies and lines of ownership (Brody, 2003). 
Asymmetrical power in the planning and decision making process is apparent between 
project agencies and communities in the persistence of top-down patterns of decision-

19 
 
making authority of the USFS (Few, 2002). Conflicting agency goals and missions, 
organizational norms and culture, a lack of top-level support for collaboration, resource 
constraints, government policies and procedures, differing decision-making authority 
among participants, and inadequate opportunities for interaction are examples of 
institutional factors that constrain collaboration (Yaffee, 1996) in forest restoration 
management. Collaboration implies shared decision-making, where stakeholder 
involvement goes well beyond the usual processes of public comment on agency 
proposals (Lowe and Moote, 2005).The CEQ NEPA Handbook states that when we 
collaborate with someone we allow that person a relatively high level of influence in our 
decision-making (CEQ, 2007). For community actors to possess some leverage in the 
dealings of agency officials, they must organize themselves into larger collectives 
(Agrawal and Gibson, 1999) to increase their negotiating power (Arevalo and Ros-
Tonen, 2009). By doing so, power is expressed on different scales of the collaborative 
process.  
Scale of power 
 
Power can be expressed at different structural scales related to collective action. 
Kiser and Ostrom offer a framework through which power may be expressed on three 
scales or levels of collective action (Kiser and Ostrom, 2000). This framework was 
developed to demonstrate how institutional arrangements serve as rules to determine who 
and what are included in decision making, how information is structured, the structure 
and sequence of actions and the aggregation of individual actions into collective 
decisions (179). The first level describes the Operational level where individuals either 
take direct action or adopt a strategy for future actions, depending on expected 

20 
 
contingencies (208).  Secondly, the Collective Choice level establishes the authoritative 
of decision-making. Collective decisions are made by officials or citizens acting as 
officials to plan for future action authorized in institutional arrangements. Collective-
choice rules recognize the process by which decisions are made and the authority to 
impose sanctions on nonconforming individuals (208). The Constitutional level is the 
design of collective choice mechanisms, or decisions about decision rules. 
“Constitutional decisions are collective choices about rules governing future collective 
decisions to authorize actions,” (209). An organization’s charter or MOU would be an 
example of the constitutional decisions.  Each of these levels or scales describes the 
expression of power through an institutional framework. This framework informed the 
hypothesis that power can be qualitatively analyzed to identify sources of power at 
multiple structural levels internal and external to a collaborative group (Appendix A). 
Operating under this hypothesis, I sought to answer these questions regarding the Four 
Forest Restoration Initiative: 
1. What are the sources of power in this collaborative effort?  
2. What are the dynamics of that power?   
3. How do the dynamics of power affect the group decision process or outcomes?

Chapter 3: Background of the Four Forest Restoration Initiative 
 
The Four National Forests of northern Arizona- the Coconino, Kaibab, Tonto, and 
Apache-Sitgreaves - cover an area of approximately 2.4 million acres of ponderosa pine 
forests, and they provide critical ecosystem services, including watershed protection, 
wildlife habitat, recreation and economic development opportunities for local 
communities (The Four Forest Restoration Initiative, 2012). These ponderosa pine 
dominated forests have become degraded by unsustainable land use practices, such as 
historic logging, fire suppression and over grazing (Covington and Moore, 1994) and are 
currently facing threats of catastrophic fire events, pest infestations, and uncertain effects 
of climate change (Mast et al., 1999; Noss et al., 2006). 
To address these threats, a group of organizations and individuals have come 
together to support landscape-scale restoration across the Four Forest Restoration 
Initiative (4FRI). 4FRI goals are to support healthy, diverse forest stands, sustained 
populations of native plants and animals, improved forest health that reduces the potential 
for destructive wildfire, and sustainable forest industries that encourage appropriate forest 
management practices and strengthen local economies. The vision of 4FRI is restored 
forest ecosystems that support natural fire regimes, functioning populations of native 
plants and animals, and forests that pose little threat of destructive wildfire to thriving 
forest communities, as well as support sustainable forest industries that strengthen local 
economies while conserving natural resources and aesthetic values (4FRI Documents).  
Since the inception of 4FRI, 103 people across 46 organizations have participated. 
There has been consistent participation from approximately 45 individuals. Key 

22 
 
organizations include: the Grand Canyon Trust, Arizona Forest Restoration Products, 
Northern Arizona University, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Center for Biological 
Diversity, Northern Arizona Wood Products Association, Arizona Game and Fish 
Department, The Nature Conservancy, and the Eastern Arizona Counties Organization. 
Over the past 25 years, many of these organizations have worked together on one or more 
collaborative forest restoration projects in northern Arizona.  
 
Conflict has characterized forest management and restoration planning efforts 
both internally (between stakeholder groups) and externally, involving the stakeholders 
and the USFS. Conflict over restoration prescriptions and techniques, such as mechanical 
harvesting, large tree removal along with distrust of commercial enterprises and the 
USFS have manifested in the form of legal challenges (appeals and litigation) (Hjerpe et 
al., 2009).   
 
Though the actors have engaged jointly in forest landscape restoration 
collaboration, they have done so with a formal structure for rules of engagement to 
navigate conflict. This formal structure includes collaboratively developed documents, 
such as the 4FRI Charter, which establishes organizational structure, decision rules and 
ground rules and the 4FRI Path Forward, which describes the collaborative vision, 
principles and sideboards intended to initially guide the initiative.  The organizational 
structure consists of three committees, which are the Steering Committee, Stakeholder 
Group and Work Groups.  4FRI officers consist of two rotating co-chairs selected from 
within the Steering Committee by requesting volunteers from the stakeholder group. 
Facilitation is established in the Charter as an objective third party who will help the 

23 
 
group resolve differences, construct consensus agreements, and “assist” in helping 
members stay accountable to one another.   
 
In addition to internal rules of engagement, the group has collectively sought to 
navigate the decision- authority of the USFS. The USFS is not a signatory on the 4FRI 
Stakeholder group formal constitutive documents and does not convene in the group or 
participate in the group’s formal decision process. The only formal link the USFS has 
with the 4FRI is a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)  that guides collaborative 
interactions between the two entities and does not explicitly address shared power. The 
MOU was established to define the working relationship between the USFS and the 
stakeholder group, specifically agreeing to work together through all phases of the NEPA 
process, including the development of a range of alternatives and the identification of the 
preferred alternative. The MOU also states that the agency is the final decision authority.  
 
 
 
 
Chapter 4: Methods 
 
Using a mixed methods case study, I analyzed forms of stakeholder participation 
in planning for the 4FRI collaborative effort and examined the dynamics of power 
relations. A total of 19 semi-structured interviews with 4FRI stakeholders and planning 

24 
 
officials provided the principal source of data. Additional data sources included 
participant observations of 2 years of monthly stakeholder meetings and secondary 
materials such as official planning documents, maps, meeting minutes and negotiated 
group documents and comments on stakeholder produced documents. Using criteria 
sampling (Henry, 1990), interview participants were purposively selected by their fit 
across 4 criteria that represent a wide range of 4FRI participation. These criteria included: 
1)  individuals who were signatories on one or more foundational documents including 
the 4FRI Official Charter, Memorandum of Understanding(MOU) or a submitted letter of 
support; 2) individuals actively engaged in the 4FRI Collaborative for 2 years or more as 
verified by their high level of meeting attendance and participation in working groups; 3) 
individuals who established a high level of involvement through leadership or 
membership in  a working group or as a co-chair of the stakeholder group; 4) represented 
one of the types of interests involved (environmental advocacy, industry, nonprofit 
conservation group, research and development, forest collaborative group, nonprofit 
conservation, county, city, and state agency,  Forest Service, and FS 4FRI 
Interdisciplinary Team).  Of the 26 individuals who met all 4 criteria, 19 accepted our 
invitation to participate.  This population consisted of 5 nonprofit conservation group 
representatives, 4 industry representatives, 3 environmental advocates, 4 government 
entities, 2 USFS members and 1 science conservationist.  More than half of the 
participants have been involved with 4FRI since its inception. All participants had 
collaborated in previous forest restoration management efforts.  
A semi-structured interview guide was developed and used to ensure symmetry 
and focus to cover relevant and comparable information. Using the Kiser and Ostrom 

25 
 
framework, key themes of the questions were constitutive roles and structure of the 4FRI, 
collective choice rules, and operational rules related to forest management and enforcing 
procedural and substantive rules.  Interview questions were open ended, focusing on 
perceptions of stakeholder dependency and interdependency, internal and external 
authoritative action, and perceptions of conflict and influence in the collaborative group. 
Probing questions were used to allow participants the opportunity to clarify and expand 
their responses. Face to face and telephone interviews were conducted over a four month 
period beginning in October 2011 through January 2012. Interviews were digitally 
recorded and transcribed. 
Supporting data were collected through meeting observation and analysis of 
meeting minutes over approximately 144 hours from August 2010 to January 2012. 
Foundational and archival documents, meeting minutes, stakeholder produced documents 
and participant observation notes were included in analysis. All data were imported into 
QSR NVivo9 for coding and analysis. The data was organized into principal themes with 
graduated levels of detail (Miles and Huberman, 1994).  Each theme and relationship was 
verified through a manual review of associated thematic categories to ensure accuracy. 
Matrix queries were then run on the coded references to identify emerging themes and 
relationships within and across the categories. Peer debriefing (Creswell, 2009), a process 
that involves a second person reviewing coding and analysis for consistency and 
repeatability, increased the accuracy and validity of the coding and analysis.

POWER DYNAMICS AT MULTIPLE SCALES IN COLLABORATIVE FOREST 
MANAGEMENT: ANALYSIS OF THE FOUR FOREST RESTORATION 
INITIATIVE 
 
Abstract 
Collaboration implies some degree of power sharing between multiple parties. 
Power and its dynamics can be identified at multiple scales in the collaborative efforts of 
landscape forest restoration management. The Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI) 
provides a case study of power in collaboration to improve our understanding of the 
multiple and indeterminate interactions among stakeholders, involving dynamics of 
power, conflict, and competition as well as collaboration and institutional innovation. 
This study uses qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews, participant observation and 
secondary documents to analyze power dynamics in the organizational governance of 
4FRI at multiple levels both internal and external to a collaborative group and across 
time. The analysis identified locations of power in the 4FRI, dynamics of power, and the 
outcomes of power. Results reveal that power plays a central role in specific operational 
rules or the details of how this collaborative effort pursues common interests. The 
dynamics of power ebb and flow as stakeholders in this high profile collaboration 
navigate power dynamics through collaboration and competition across a time scale. 
Utilizing the total power of a collaborative group through robust consensus decision 
making and clear mechanisms to support these to collectively influence decision 
authority is more effective than competing for that influence. Likewise, governmental 
policies are outdated mechanisms that stifle the agency’s ability to rely on outside 

27 
 
resources to enhance its power and legitimacy in collaboration with its partners. Overall, 
interdependency among stakeholders and between the agency and stakeholder group is 
the greatest form of power in the collaborative process.  
Introduction 
Power dynamics in collaborative forest restoration can be identified across 
multiple structural scales. In ideal collaboration, visions are shared and goals are 
unambiguous and uncontested. However, natural resource planning situations can be 
typified by competing interests, a lack of scientific agreement, limited time, imbalance in 
resources, and structural inequities in the access to information and the distribution of 
political power (Lachapelle et al., 2003).Examining power dynamics internal and external 
to a collaborative effort and the “complex set of transformations that link institutional 
arrangements to individual behavior and aggregate results (Kiser and Ostrom, 1982) can 
empower stakeholders and the agencies they work with to navigate toward their main 
objective.  
Collaboration in forest landscape restoration is fundamentally about working 
together through shared power in decision-making in a process through which multiple 
stakeholders jointly explore diverse values and interests and attempt to come to some 
level of agreement about appropriate forest management (Lowe and Moote, 2005). The 
role of power sharing in collaboration is enhancing collective cohesiveness and 
interdependency across diverse and sometimes conflicting interests to achieve shared 
goals. Moving from competition to collaboration, actors increase the ability to influence 
total power of the collaborative effort by combining resources, navigating multiple 
competing goals and interest, identifying gaps in information, and producing a set of 

28 
 
recommendations likely to reduce workload and planning barriers for agencies (Agrawal 
and Ribot, 1999).  According to the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) 
Collaborating in NEPA Handbook (CEQ, 2009), “By engaging relevant expertise, 
including scientific and technical expertise, and knowledge of a local resource, a 
collaborative body can reach a more informed agreement and advise decision-makers 
accordingly.” The CEQ Handbook (2009) further states that benefits of collaboration 
include a fairer process, improved fact-finding, increased social-capital, enhanced 
environmental stewardship and reduced litigation.   
The Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI) is the largest collaborative forest 
restoration effort currently underway in the U.S. and subsequently challenges the current 
model of institutional governance in landscape forest restoration management. The 4FRI 
reflects a broader trend whereby multiple stakeholders collaboratively define goals, 
priorities and, in some cases, allocation of budgetary and programmatic resources of 
federal land management agencies. Much more than public involvement in an agency-
initiated project proposal, this collaborative may be defining a new governance approach 
for federal land management at fairly large geographic scales. 4FRI offers an opportunity 
to gain empirical evidence of power and power dynamics in collaboration to improve our 
understanding of power in conflict and competition as well as power in collaboration and 
institutional innovation.  
This case study was designed to qualitatively analyze power dynamics in the 
organizational governance of 4FRI at multiple structural levels both internal and external 
to a CFLR group. Focus of the analysis was on identifying 1) internal and external 
sources of power 2) power dynamics, and 3) outcomes resulting from these power 

29 
 
dynamics. The research results demonstrate how stakeholders in this high profile effort 
navigate power dynamics in a new landscape scale experiment of forest governance. This 
research contributes to providing a model for future landscape scale collaborative efforts 
understanding the role of power in conflict and collaborative assessments. 
Literature Review 
Few empirical studies have explored the working of power in the field of forest 
restoration (Raik et al., 2008) or to the processes engaged within these dynamic 
partnerships (Arevalo, Ros-Tonen, 2009). Yet, collaboration in forest restoration and 
management is infused with issues of access, control, rights, ownership and use- issues of 
power (Raik et al., 2008).  Among ongoing negotiations that occur with each goal, 
objective and deadline is an assertion of power that requires persistent navigation 
(Walker and Hurley, 2004) and clarification of power (Daniels and Walker 2001) to 
reduce to overconfident, defensive, or domineering behaviors during the collaborative 
process (Purdy, 2012). Collaboration locates control and power in the parties and their 
negotiation process (Daniels and Walker 2001) involving a joint decision making 
approach in which power is shared and stakeholders take collective responsibility for 
their actions and the subsequent consequences or outcomes of those actions (Selin and 
Chavez, 1994).  
Power Defined 
 
         The definition of power has been the source of scholarly debate over many decades 
(Dahl, 1957; Emerson, 1962; Isaac, 1987), ranging from power as actor-specific 
resources used in the pursuit of self-interests (ctd. in Fuchs, 2005) to power as the 
capacity of a social system to mobilize resources to realize collective goals (Parsons, 

30 
 
1967:193). Power has been defined as the “measure of an entity’s ability to realize its 
goals (i.e., ‘power to’), the ability to control the behavior of other entities (i.e., ‘power 
over’)” (Egan et al., 2011) or the ability to sanction participation of stakeholders who 
might otherwise be marginalized (i.e. ‘power for’) (Purdy, 2012). Power has also been 
defined as the authority to create rules and make decisions (Agrawal and Ribot, 1999).  
Dimensions of power have been defined as coercion, the power one actor has over 
another (A over B) to get that actor to do something he or she would not otherwise do 
(Lukes, 2005),constraint, one actor’s ability to constrain the actions or possible actions of 
another actor to ensure inaction (Bacharach and Baratz, 1962) and power as a social 
structure production of consent and norms (Clegg, 1989), where societal forces shape 
individual preferences and this shaping process works to justify and maintain current 
systems of power (Raik at al., 2008; Lukes, 2005).  
These definitions of power offer explanations of power as action, attitude or 
ability. To seek further understanding of power, especially in the context of institutional 
arrangements, one must look to locate sources of power or where power originates.   
Sources of Power 
 
Past research identifies sources of power as the objective, individual level 
resources each party brings to the negotiating table, the perceptions of 
those individual-level resources, and the relative power between the parties (Wolfe and 
McGinn, 2005).Individuals and organizations can use objective components of power in 
the resources  they bring into the collaboration (Bachrach and Lawler, 2012) such as 
personnel, knowledge, skills, legal authority, or money, to exert influence over others 
(Skarlicki and Folger, 1997). An organization’s ability to provide abundant or highly 

31 
 
valued resources, as well as who is involved and to what degree will inevitably influence 
the outcome of the planning process (Brody, 2003; Purdy, 2012).   
Power Uses in Forest Restoration Management 
 
Forest management or restoration projects tend to generate heated conflict as they 
involve multiple stakeholders (Elias et al., 2004) with differing worldviews and 
competing demands.  Collaboration may be viewed by some groups as a different means 
of handling competition (Amy, 1987) or an opportunity to enhance power through a new 
venue; where if they are unable to serve their own interests they may undermine the 
entire collaborative (Walker and Hurley, 2004).  
 
Asymmetrical power in the planning and decision making process is apparent 
between project agencies and communities in the persistence of top-down patterns of 
decision-making authority of the USFS (Few, 2002). Conflicting agency goals and 
missions, organizational norms and culture, lack of top-level support for collaboration, 
resource constraints, government policies and procedures, differing decision-making 
authority among participants, and inadequate opportunities for interaction are examples 
of institutional factors that constrain collaboration (Yaffee, 1996) in forest restoration 
management. Collaboration implies shared decision-making, where stakeholder 
involvement goes well beyond the usual processes of public comment on agency 
proposals (Lowe and Moote, 2005).The CEQ NEPA Handbook states that when we 
collaborate with someone we allow that person a relatively high level of influence in our 
decision-making (CEQ, 2007). For community actors to possess some leverage in the 
dealings of agency officials, they must organize themselves into larger collectives 

32 
 
(Agrawal and Gibson, 1999) to increase their negotiating power (Arevalo and Ros-
Tonen, 2009). 
Theories of Power 
 
Theories of power have become voluminous as they evolved through time. To 
narrow the focus, I have selected theories of power most closely related to collective 
processes. I focus this discussion on relational power, interdependence, individual power 
and power in the field of forest restoration and management.   
 
Relational power stems from the positive correlations between cooperation and 
power that contradict the common, implicit assumption that power occurs only in 
competition (Tjosvold, 2008). By working together, stakeholders can expand the human 
and financial resources required for restoration (Lowe and Moote, 2003).An 
Interdependence view of power can be characterized by an exchange of sources of power 
between two actors (Lawler and Yoon, 1996). Sources of power can be used to advance 
the joint efforts of collaborators, resulting in mutual gain (Purdy, 2012) where members 
invest resources to innovate and change the structure itself in order to improve joint 
outcomes (Ostrom,1998) thereby increasing the collaborative potential. Interdependence 
can be expressed through the establishment of coalitions where members of a social unit 
nurture a sense of belonging, and share distinctive values, goals and resources and 
enhance discursive legitimacy between coalitions (Apreda, 2007; Purdy, 2012). 
Individual power has been defined as a person’s motivation to acquire power or 
individual traits, to increase the likelihood of attaining positions of power (Wolfe and 
McGinn 2005). Individual influence may be employed competitively for personal gain, or 
it may be endorsed by others as a resource for the collective. 

33 
 
 
Total power can be defined as the sum of actors’ resources and capabilities 
(Lawler et al., 1988). When resources of individuals are combined into the collective 
whole, the group’s overall authority and influence increases (Sandstrom, 2009).  They 
also include better representation of the interests of disadvantaged and powerless groups 
in governmental decision making and the contributions of participation to citizenship 
(Brody, 2003).  
Scale of Power 
 
Power can be expressed at different structural scales related to collective action. 
Kiser and Ostrom offer a framework through which power may be expressed on three 
scales or levels of collective action (Kiser and Ostrom, 2000). This framework was 
developed to demonstrate how institutional arrangements serve as rules to determine who 
and what are included in decision making, how information is structured, the structure 
and sequence of actions and the aggregation of individual actions into collective 
decisions (179). The first level describes the Operational level where individuals either 
take direct action or adopt a strategy for future actions, depending on expected 
contingencies (208).  Secondly, the Collective Choice level establishes the authoritative 
of decision-making. Collective decisions are made by officials or citizens acting as 
officials to plan for future action authorized in institutional arrangements. Collective-
choice rules recognize the process by which decisions are made and the authority to 
impose sanctions on nonconforming individuals (208). The Constitutional level is the 
design of collective choice mechanisms, or decisions about decision rules. 
“Constitutional decisions are collective choices about rules governing future collective 
decisions to authorize actions,” (209). An organization’s charter or MOU would be an 

34 
 
example of the constitutional decisions.  Each of these levels or scales describes the 
expression of power through an institutional framework. This framework informed the 
hypothesis that power can be qualitatively analyzed to identify sources of power at 
multiple structural levels internal and external to a collaborative group (Appendix A). 
Operating under this hypothesis, I sought to answer these questions regarding the Four 
Forest Restoration Initiative: 
1. What are the sources of power in this collaborative effort?  
2. What are the dynamics of that power?   
3. How do the dynamics of power affect the group decision process or outcomes?  
Four Forest Restoration Initiative 
 
The Four National Forests of northern Arizona- the Coconino, Kaibab, Tonto, and 
Apache-Sitgreaves - cover an area of approximately 2.4 million acres of ponderosa pine 
forests, and they provide critical ecosystem services, including watershed protection, 
wildlife habitat, recreation and economic development opportunities for local 
communities (The Four Forest Restoration Initiative, 2012). These ponderosa pine 
dominated forests have become degraded by unsustainable land use practices, such as 
historic logging, fire suppression and over grazing (Covington and Moore, 1994) and are 
currently facing threats of catastrophic fire events, pest infestations, and uncertain effects 
of climate change (Mast et al., 1999; Noss et al., 2006). 
To address these threats, a group of organizations and individuals have come 
together to support landscape-scale restoration across the Four Forest Restoration 
Initiative (4FRI). 4FRI goals are to support healthy, diverse forest stands, sustained 

35 
 
populations of native plants and animals, improved forest health that reduces the potential 
for destructive wildfire, and sustainable forest industries that encourage appropriate forest 
management practices and strengthen local economies. The vision of 4FRI is restored 
forest ecosystems that support natural fire regimes, functioning populations of native 
plants and animals, and forests that pose little threat of destructive wildfire to thriving 
forest communities, as well as support sustainable forest industries that strengthen local 
economies while conserving natural resources and aesthetic values (4FRI Documents).  
Since the inception of 4FRI, 103 people across 46 organizations have participated. 
There has been consistent participation from approximately 45 individuals. Over the past 
25 years, many of these organizations have worked together on one or more collaborative 
forest restoration projects in northern Arizona.  
 
Conflict has characterized forest management and restoration planning efforts in 
northern Arizona, involving the stakeholders and the USFS. Conflict over restoration 
prescriptions and techniques, such as mechanical harvesting, large tree removal along 
with distrust of commercial enterprises and the USFS have manifested in the form of 
legal challenges (appeals and litigation) (Hjerpe et al., 2009).   
 
Though actors have engaged jointly in forest landscape restoration collaboration, 
they have done so with a formal structure for rules of engagement to navigate conflict. 
This formal structure includes collaboratively developed documents, such as the 4FRI 
Charter, which establishes organizational structure, decision rules and ground rules and 
the 4FRI Path Forward, which describes the collaborative vision, principles and 
sideboards intended to initially guide the initiative.  The organizational structure consists 

36 
 
of three committees, which are the Steering Committee, Stakeholder Group and Work 
Groups.  4FRI officers consist of two rotating co-chairs selected from within the Steering 
Committee by requesting volunteers from the stakeholder group. Facilitation is 
established in the Charter as an objective third party who will help the group resolve 
differences, construct consensus agreements, and “assist” in helping members stay 
accountable to one another.   
 
In addition to internal rules of engagement, the group has collectively sought to 
navigate the decision- authority of the USFS. The USFS is not a signatory on the 4FRI 
Stakeholder group formal constitutive documents and does not convene in the group or 
participate in the group’s formal decision process. The only formal link the USFS has 
with the 4FRI is a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that guides collaborative 
interactions between the two entities and does not explicitly address shared power. The 
MOU was established to define the working relationship between the USFS and the 
stakeholder group, specifically agreeing to work together through all phases of the NEPA 
process, including the development of a range of alternatives and the identification of the 
preferred alternative. The MOU also states that the agency is the final decision authority.  
Methods 
 
Using a mixed methods case study, we analyzed forms of stakeholder 
participation in planning for the 4FRI collaborative effort and examined the dynamics of 
power relations. A total of 19 semi-structured interviews with 4FRI stakeholders and 
planning officials provided the principal source of data. Additional data sources included 
participant observations of 2 years of monthly stakeholder meetings and secondary 

37 
 
materials such as official planning documents, maps, meeting minutes and negotiated 
group documents and comments on stakeholder produced documents. Using criteria 
sampling (Henry, 1990), interview participants were purposively selected by their fit 
across 4 criteria that represent a wide range of 4FRI participation. These criteria included: 
1)  individuals who were signatories on one or more foundational documents including 
the 4FRI Official Charter, Memorandum of Understanding(MOU) or a submitted letter of 
support; 2) individuals actively engaged in the 4FRI Collaborative for 2 years or more as 
verified by their high level of meeting attendance and participation in working groups; 3) 
individuals who established a high level of involvement through leadership or 
membership in  a working group or as a co-chair of the stakeholder group; 4) represented 
one of the types of interests involved (environmental advocacy, industry, nonprofit 
conservation group, research and development, forest collaborative group, nonprofit 
conservation, county, city, and state agency,  Forest Service, and FS 4FRI 
Interdisciplinary Team).  Of the 26 individuals who met all 4 criteria, 19 accepted our 
invitation to participate.  This population consisted of 5 nonprofit conservation group 
representatives, 4 industry representatives, 3 environmental advocates, 4 government 
entities, 2 USFS members and 1 science conservationist.  More than half of the 
participants have been involved with 4FRI since its inception. All participants had 
collaborated in previous forest restoration management efforts.  
A semi-structured interview guide was developed and used to ensure symmetry 
and focus to cover relevant and comparable information. Using the Kiser and Ostrom 
framework, key themes of the questions were constitutive roles and structure of the 4FRI, 
collective choice rules, and operational rules related to forest management and enforcing 

38 
 
procedural and substantive rules.  Interview questions were open ended, focusing on 
perceptions of stakeholder dependency and interdependency, internal and external 
authoritative action, and perceptions of conflict and influence in the collaborative group. 
Probing questions were used to allow participants the opportunity to clarify and expand 
their responses. Face to face and telephone interviews were conducted over a four month 
period beginning in October 2011 through January 2012. Interviews were digitally 
recorded and transcribed. 
Supporting data were collected through meeting observation and analysis of 
meeting minutes over approximately 144 hours from August 2010 to January 2012. 
Foundational and archival documents, meeting minutes, stakeholder produced documents 
and participant observation notes were included in analysis. All data were imported into 
QSR NVivo9 for coding and analysis. The data was organized into principal themes with 
graduated levels of detail (Miles and Huberman, 1994).  Each theme and relationship was 
verified through a manual review of associated thematic categories to ensure accuracy. 
Matrix queries were then run on the coded references to identify emerging themes and 
relationships within and across the categories. Peer debriefing (Creswell, 2009), 
increased the accuracy and validity of the coding and analysis. 
Results 
 
 
The analysis of power dynamics in the 4FRI collaborative effort was conducted 
through three lenses of focus: the source of power in the collaborative group, the 
dynamics of that power and the outcomes power had on the group processes. With each 

39 
 
increasing level of focus or specificity, the dynamics of power become increasingly more 
complex but the outcomes of power dynamics became better understood. 
Participants’ Incentive to Collaborate 
 
We first sought to understand the driving incentive for participants to collaborate 
in the 4FRI in an attempt to gauge commonality and conflict where potential power 
struggles could occur. Participants expressed a range of interests and incentives to 
participate in the 4FRI Collaborative group (see Table 1), yet the common interest 
binding the diversity of stakeholders together was the need to accelerate landscape scale 
forest restoration. Members of nonprofit conservation groups were primarily concerned 
with accelerating restoration to prevent catastrophic wildfire, and economic development 
through the return of wood products industry to northern Arizona. The USFS and Wood 
Products Industry were also primarily concerned with accelerating restoration, preventing 
catastrophic wildfire, and providing economic development as well as protecting the 
process from litigation. Environmental advocates were concerned with accelerating forest 
restoration and applying pressure to the USFS to ensure an effective process.  
Government entities wanted to protect their communities by accelerating restoration and 
providing an economic boost through the return of industry.  There were three interest 
categories that were outliers: Protecting the collaborative effort from litigation, 
pressuring the USFS to fully collaborate and honor stakeholder agreements, and ensuring 
that best available science was accurately used in the planning process.

* Number of people who identified this category as an incentive to collaborate 
 
An ongoing debate within the collaboration has been who defines the 4FRI 
collaboration: the Stakeholder group, the USFS or both. Out of 19 participants, 3 
responded that the 4FRI Collaborative constituted the Stakeholder group without the 
USFS. The primary reason indicated was the perception or interpretation of a legal 
preclusion of the USFS to collaborate without violating NEPA or Federal Advisory 
Committee Act (FACA). However, the formal constitution of the collaborative is defined 
by documents developed by the stakeholder group and the USFS has not endorsed or 
become a signatory of the documents. For this reason, we treat the USFS as an external 
participant in the presentation of results from this analysis.  
  Sources of Power 
 
Through participant’s responses, three sources of power were identified, including 
individual and organizational resources, coalitions and collective resources, Individuals 
and the organizations they represent bring a variety of resources to the collaborative 
process such as funding, time and personnel. These resources may be contributed to the 

41 
 
collective whole or to coalitions within the stakeholder group. Coalitions were shown to 
be an aggregation of individual resources where those resources were used as leveraging 
tools to influence the larger group’s decision process. Collective resources were an 
aggregation of individual and coalition resources to enhance the entire group’s validity 
and influence in the overall collaborative process with external entities.  
Participants identified Individual and Organizational resources including 
scientific and legal expertise, political influence, personnel, funds, experience and time. 
These resources legitimize and influence individual power and authority and contribution 
to the collective whole. Some participants described how asymmetries in distribution of 
resources limit their own level of contribution to the group and impede there authority:  
 “That’s great that they have that ability to bring resources, but it also sometimes 
marginalizes some of the other partners who don’t have those resources to bring to the 
table.” 
A deficit in individual or organizational time or personnel to contribute in all 
dimensions of 4FRI work decreased individuals’ power in the collaborative effort. One 
stakeholder stated, 
“Unfortunately, if you’re not involved with all the working groups I don’t know that 
sometimes your voice is heard”.  
 
Coalitions were perceived to be an aggregation of individual and organizational 
resources within 4FRI. One coalition formalized its influence by establishing its own 
Memorandum of Understanding among members of that coalition separate from and prior 
to the formal constituting of the rest of the stakeholder group. A member of this coalition 
clarified the intention behind this MOU: “It was to take off the table the traditional 

42 
 
rationale for not moving forward with landscape scale restoration, thereby forcing 
everybody, meaningfully to agree.”  
Members of coalitions combined resources to influence decision making  within 
the greater stakeholder group and externally beyond the USFS representatives. Through 
this interdependency, coalitions were effective in applying pressure to influence decision 
making through regional and national levels of the FS: 
I think [4FRI] derived primarily from the political juggernaut blown by the 
environmental community, industry and rural counties working together and the ability of 
those organizations, individually and together, to plank the politics and force the [FS] 
into action through political pressure.” 
Participants recognized that as a collaborative the group’s collective resources 
included political connections and influence and intellectual capital, such as scientific and 
legal expertise and experience.  Asymmetries in collective resources included litigation 
and scientific expertise. For some participants, legal expertise holds a high legitimacy in 
the collaborative process as a tool that can provide recommendations for preventing 
litigation. For others, it is perceived as a constant threat to the USFS and other 
stakeholders group as one of the most powerful resources. This creates a perception of 
low power and high dependency among the non-litigious majority of the stakeholder 
group and enhances the interests of minority voices in reaching consensus decisions from 
the group: 
 
 “The same consequence that we’ve had hanging over our head the whole time; 
we are held hostage to litigation… if 90% of the stakeholder group likes the EIS and 10% 
doesn’t, it doesn’t really matter what the 90% says because the 10% can still litigate.”  

43 
 
 
Scientific expertise and legitimacy represented a significant source of conflict and 
struggle for power and influence. All participants place emphasis on the influence and 
use of best-available science. However, contestations over the authority to speak on 
behalf of restoration ecology reflected differing interpretations of science. The legitimacy 
of who has scientific authority is split among two stakeholder coalitions. In speaking 
about one coalition’s debate over a 16 inch diameter cap in the Large Tree Retention 
Strategy one participant stated: 
“The usual opposition, using the same argument- this is not scientific… The classic 
apostles of pure science.” 
Locations of Power 
Through the process of identify sources of power, a matrix of interrelated themes 
(See Table 2) also emerged demonstrating how power at different locations affects the 
decision-making process. These locations of power emerged in four principal themes: 
Internal Rules, External Rules, Formal Structure and Informal Structure. Participant 
responses revealed a clear difference between stakeholder attempts to manage power by 
establishing a formal collaborative structure of 4FRI compared with applications of 
power within the informal structure. The formal and informal structures compare 
guidelines collectively established in foundational framework with the group’s adherence 
to those guidelines. This comparison is significant in demonstrating how the varying 
nuances of power are actually expressed in the collaborative process despite formally 
established framework intended to manage power. Internal governance locates power 
dynamics within the stakeholder group. External governance refers to the power 
dynamics between individual and collective stakeholders and the USFS.

4FRI Stakeholders established formal structures intended to regulate membership, 
designate authority and process to make decisions, hold members accountable and 
facilitate procedural actions.  Each of the formal structures was developed to ensure a fair 
process where leadership and agenda-setting are distributed among all members of the 
stakeholder group. For example, limitations were established around the amount of time 
one could serve in a leadership position.  However, this form of power has been exercised 
by four organizations who routinely volunteer to co-chair. Among the stakeholders 
group, those organizations have the most resources in terms of budget to commit time 
and professional staff specifically to 4FRI and therefore influence the performance and 
substance of the group process and decisions. .   
 
The 4FRI Charter defines a consensus process, whereby, the goal is to achieve the 
highest level of agreement (Agreement without reservations) in decision making. In the 
absence of full agreement, a formalized decision process outlines levels of support 

45 
 
including agreement with reservations, agreement by acquiescence and no clear 
agreement. These intended decision rules allow for stakeholders to reach decisions where 
conflict may still exist. The process is intended to accommodate each stakeholder’s 
interest by not outvoting those with a minority voice but rather including their concerns 
in the final decision:  “..say that 100% of people agree with 100% of what we are doing, 
that would be better… more influential, but I think that we would have limited so much 
of what we are doing by the time we would get to 100% agreement from everybody”. 
 
Ground Rules were developed as governing principles of behavior to foster trust 
and respect among stakeholders. The most notable rule commits stakeholders to: Hold 
oneself and other members accountable to adherence to the purpose, convening values 
and goals of the 4 Forest Restoration Initiative.  
 
Despite this established formal structure, accountability was identified in the 
interviews as one of the most important moderating variables on the use of power in 
maintaining or undermining influence within the stakeholder group. We asked 
participants if roles and responsibilities established in the Charter were adequate in 
serving the decision process and holding members accountable to those roles and 
responsibilities. Despite this formal structure, participants identified three ways that 
accountability is not enforced:  1) failure to establish authority to hold others accountable, 
2) established safety to be supported in that authority, and 3) deference to a third party 
facilitator.  
 
A large majority of participants expressed a feeling of powerlessness to determine 
who has the authority to enforce accountability and what legitimizes that authority: 

46 
 
 
“I don’t think we are going to get anywhere until there is a strong role of 
enforcement of the ground rules and the charter.” 
 
Further, participants struggle with how to hold other members accountable 
without experiencing resulting repercussions that may cause lasting damage, such as 
negating efforts to rebuild trust:  
 
“There’s been an inherent dishonesty… and there has been a lack of 
accountability to both daylight that dishonesty and prevent that behavior from 
continuing…at least, not in so far as the charter is deployed in the context of [the 4FRI] 
culture.” 
 
A smaller portion of participants look to an objective third party to broker 
accountability: 
 
“I really think that is the third party neutral’s role to have dealt with those 
behaviors a long time ago, and sort of crush them to the point to where we can sort of 
start from a clean slate in building trust back up.” 
Internal Negotiations 
 
 
Internal negotiations emerged from the interviews as a strategy of power 
discussed in relation to empowering one’s self and one’s coalition through tactical 
positioning and manipulation of the collaborative process to gain individual benefit: 
    
“I have seen some parties that consistently position for a particular outcome of 
interest to their organization… you have to be very cautious of gaming or bypassing 

47 
 
situations because they are representing one or the other. I would even say that there are 
parties that are working collectively because there are two or three groups that have 
their own collective interests.” 
However, not all members see this as insidiously. Rather they see negotiations as 
way of representing and enhancing interests through a coalition’s power:  
“I’ll meet with them ahead of time and say this is how I’m intending to approach 
this issue, how are you feeling about it? Do you agree? If you do agree, can we agree 
right now to back each other up during the collaborative meeting?”  
External Power Dynamics/ Formal and Informal 
 
 
A Memorandum of Understanding establishes structure and roles directing how 
4FRI Stakeholders and the USFS will interact. Language in the MOU defines roles and 
scope of decision space in the relationship between the two entities:   
THE U.S. FOREST SERVICE SHALL:  
A. Work directly with parties at all phases of the NEPA process, seeking 
their input and agreement (Collaborating in NEPA Handbook, p.13);  
B. Strive to accommodate the agreement-based outcomes and products of 
the collaborative process within 4FRI, recognizing that translation of such 
agreement greatly enhances chances for success, and reduces the risk of 
conflict;  
E. Communicate to the 4FRI Collaborative  
F. Participate in 4FRI Collaborative meetings, consistent with 
requirements in Federal law. 
 
 
Within the NEPA process and implementation of the Collaborative Forest Landscape 
Restoration Act (CFLRA), the USFS sets the agenda in determining the type of 

48 
 
information and when stakeholders should provide it. USFS representatives are present at 
stakeholder meetings to share information, discuss gaps in information or limitations but 
many times back out of letting stakeholders make decisions.  
“…the stakeholders have committed an MOU to come to the table and to provide advice 
in a timely fashion on how to proceed with landscape scale restoration.”  
    
Some participants discussed their distrust in the Forest Service as a decision 
making authority. Distrust between members of the stakeholder group and the FS is based 
in part on a lack of accountability of the FS to the stakeholders and the FS legal decision 
making authority. One participant articulated:  
 
“The Forest Service does not feel accountable to the collaboration. The Forest 
Service’s perspective is that in the end I make the decision.”  
 
The primary reason behind this distrust was derived from stakeholder’s 
perceptions of the agency’s internal hierarchy of decision-making. One participant stated: 
“We get schizophrenic messages from the Forest Service. If there was any bone to pick 
right now about that, it’s that you get the ID team telling you one thing, the supervisors 
telling you another thing, and the region telling you another thing.” 
This raises questions about where the decision-making power resides in the USFS and 
how agreements with stakeholders will be accommodated.  
 
Despite the MOU signed by stakeholders and the USFS, there’s a lack of clarity 
as to how the MOU agreements apply across the USFS hierarchy. As a result, the 
majority of stakeholders questioned the quality of the collaborative relationship where 
there is a lack of shared decision-authority:  

49 
 
 
“I truly don’t feel that the relationship between the stakeholders and the forest 
service is collaborative; it’s still kind of like ‘you produce this, we’ll take a look at it, and 
if we like it, yeah, maybe we’ll include it.’ To me, that’s not being very collaborative.”  
 
Another participant said: “The Forest Service haven’t asked for, or been willing 
to accept as much as the stakeholders could provide.” 
Outcomes of interdependency among the FS and stakeholders emerged with 
positive impacts on the collaboration process.  
A Forest Service employee stated, “I hate to say this just because it makes our job 
so much harder, but people like the environmentalists actually make us better. They make 
us more articulate and clearer. There should be a better understanding of what we are 
doing on the ground and they really are going to ensure that ten years from now we are 
still evolving.” 
However, many stakeholders maintained that the lack of perceived 
interdependence results in a weakened collaborative effort. A 4FRI co-chair articulated a 
scenario where the stakeholders attempted to mitigate a situation that would likely result 
in litigation for the USFS but the USFS refused their assistance.  
“A number of stakeholders identified a legal and socio-political vulnerability to 
the effort and the larger CFLR program. We developed a clearly defined strategy for 
mitigating the vulnerability, which could have been implemented with little to no cost to 
the Forest Service. Unfortunately, the Forest Service took a seemingly unnecessary firm 
stance and refused to alter its course. This could provide significant ammunition for 

50 
 
critics of 4FRI and the CFLRP. It makes the collaborative effort appear as a rubber 
stamp, or even an active supporter for the Forest Service’s business-as-usual approach.” 
Other Avenues of Power 
 
 
Participants identified “bypassing” as a coercive tactic to circumvent a person 
who is firm in their position by approaching their superior to either have that person 
removed or forced into changing their position on an issue. One participant described it 
as an effort, “to weaken other individuals within their own organization by going over 
their heads complaining to their bosses. “ 
 
This use of power has been employed to influence different levels of the USFS 
hierarchy. For instance, members of a coalition within the stakeholder group have 
attempted to single out and pressure regional FS officers to take into account the 
stakeholders’ vision of restoration and how to achieve that vision.  
 
“When all of the lavish of collaboration is said and done, the reality is that most 
people are going to do everything they can to get what they want accomplished. It is true 
of the counties, when they go to D.C. and to congress; it is true of constituents who go to 
the Forest Service in D.C. or to Dept. of Agriculture when they don’t get what they want 
from the region.” 
 
The effects of applying power in other venues deepen distrust and yet attempt to 
force accountability to formal agreements and to collective vision. In response to these 
external and informal exercises of power, the stakeholder group has implemented a rule 
requiring transparency in stakeholder interactions outside of the collaborative group as a 

51 
 
response to these efforts. Stakeholder interactions are now shared at each stakeholder 
group meeting as a part of this evolution in accountability.  
Outcomes of Power 
Collective empowerment emerged as a themed in participant interviews as 
participants endorsed themselves and other individuals or organizations by recognizing 
the importance of relationships among parties.  One participant said, 
 “…there are individuals representing these organizations, which make or 
unmake the possibility of an agreement. Collaboration happens between people, not 
institutions.” 
Participant responses demonstrated instances where interdependency contributed 
to a sense of collective empowerment where the whole was able to gain more influence 
than any single individual or group to advance collective goals. Stakeholders have 
advocated at the congressional level for funding, resources, and support in a way that the 
USFS cannot. Stakeholders also elicited a broader range of support from outside 
members and influenced the USFS engage in restoration across four forests in a way 
never attempted before.  
“4FRI has done its job; it has already done two things out of three. It has 
accomplished bringing these folks together, providing a social license, and getting the 
EIS process done on this vast scale.” 
 
The majority of participants recognized that overall power and influence of the 
4FRI Collaboration was increased through combined efforts of the USFS and all 
members of the Stakeholder group.  

52 
 
One USFS member stated: “From a collaborative standpoint I see it as all parties have 
something to offer and that collectively the value that each party offers is collectively 
more valuable than any independent or single thought or idea.” 
Changing Power Relations over Time 
 
 
Another outcome of power in the collaborative process that emerged was the 
identification of changing power relations over time between the stakeholder group and 
the USFS (Figure 1). Figure 1 demonstrate the perception held by the majority of 
participants that stakeholder influence decreased over time as the USFS engagement 
decreased through stages of the NEPA process and as the Proposed Action was 
developed:  
 
“Staff has been a lot less involved currently. It went from specialists, silviculture, 
fire, wildlife, and NEPA, to just leaders. So I think it’s gone the opposite direction of 
what I would have liked to see. I would like to see more involvement as a Proposed 
Action came through.” 
The CEQ NEPA handbook states that “all levels of engagement may be used at 
different steps in a given NEPA process.”  A review of meeting attendance sheets over a 
6 month period confirmed that USFS participation decreased significantly in 4FRI 
Stakeholder group meeting presence through phases of the NEPA process. The USFS did, 
however, establish office hours in an attempt to be available to all members of the public.

Participants were asked to rate on a scale of 1 to 10 their level of satisfaction with 
the performance of the entire 4FRI collaboration including the USFS (Table 3). 
Satisfaction with the overall collaborative effort and stakeholder group seems to be 
lowest among those who were attempting to use power to redefine traditional roles and 
push the boundaries between social license and USFS decision making authority.

Discussion 
 
General findings from this analysis reveal that sources of power are located in 
venues or arenas through which power dynamics temporally shift in an ebb and flow 
between competition and collaboration over the details of a shared vision. Daniels and 
Walkers (2001) suggest that collaboration is theoretically about shared power and Moote 
and Lowe (2005) suggest collaboration is about shared decision authority.  This research 
furthers these definitions by including power as an integral variable of collaboration 
where power manifests at multiple locations (formal and informal) and within those 
locations interdependency, cooperation and competition are each dynamics that develop 
in moving toward the collectively shared vision.  
What are the Sources of Power? 
Sources of power included shared vision, decision- authority and resources. 
Members of the 4FRI overwhelmingly demonstrated a shared vision to accelerate forest 
restoration. As Moote and Lowe (2005) suggested, the potential to achieve shared vision 
was enhanced when members combined resources, such as logistical support, time, 
personnel, scientific information, legal expertise and political influence.  Combined, these 
resources enhanced the group’s total power in effectively influencing funding as a CFLR 
project, the NEPA process and development of the first EIS area. However, this was a 
double-edged sword, where asymmetries in power identified by Lachapelle et al. (2003) 
and Bacharach and Lawler (1986), such as the type and amount of resources an 
organization could offer (affected the integrativeness in outcomes (Wolfe and McGinn, 

55 
 
2005) when members competed over a legitimate right to exert influence (Munduate and 
Gravenhorst, 2003) in an effort to assure their own interests were protected in USFS 
decision making process.  
Relational power and interdependence in collaboration are critical components to 
successfully accomplishing shared vision. Between stakeholders and the USFS these 
components serve to level the playing field by allowing the USFS to render some amount 
of power and authority to the collaborative group, as the group negotiates legal issues, 
science and technical issues, and socio-economic issues that would inevitably arise and 
potentially force the USFS to address those issues in a legal setting. In the absence of 
interdependence, the ability of the collaborative to promote the interests of all in a win-
win scenario is diminished and risk of parties disengaging increases.   
 What are the dynamics of power?  
 
Dynamics of power were expressed in this study through formal (governing rules) 
and informal (social behaviors guiding actions) structures as suggested by Lachapelle et 
al. (2004) and are expressed in venues internal and external to the 4FRI collaboration 
(Figure 2). Internal formal structures of the 4FRI include a framework where process and 
tools to facilitate the progress of process such as ground rules and foundational 
documents are measures to constrain and express power. This formal established 
dynamics is challenged however, as many participants treat the formal structure as mere 
guidelines for behavior that give way to internal informal structures that are a rich web of 
relations suggested by Carlsson and Berkes (2005) and competition to advance interests 
outside of formal processes. These informal dynamics included forming coalitions to 
increase the influence of some in order to compete with the influence of others as well as 

56 
 
undermining collective decisions. Within internal informal structures, individuals in this 
study exercised power through both cooperation and competition, which ultimately 
determined group decision outcomes. 
How do power dynamics affect group decision outcomes? 
 
 
Manifestations of power achieve multiple outcomes through cooperation and 
competition. In this analysis, cooperation enhanced the total power of those involved 
when individuals created interdependency through resource sharing. Sharing resources 
contributed to cooperation and collective empowerment and increased the coalitions’ or 
stakeholder group’s ability to influence decision-making and therefore, increased the 
incentive to collaborate. However, this participatory process also increased conflict by 
having unclear consensus and decision-making framework which slowed the decision-
making process and diluted the strength of final agreements (Brody, 2003) that were then 
undermined outside of the formal processes and rules. Indispensable resources became 
expressions through which stakeholders could influence USFS authority, thus increasing 
an incentive to compete individually, or cooperate through the social license in coalitions.  
 
Purdy (2012) suggests that power should be equalized in order for a collaborative 
to be more effective. I agree that balancing power between stakeholders and the USFS 
could decrease the overall competition within the stakeholder group and between the 
stakeholder group and the USFS. The USFS is the single decision authority in which all 
interested parties must rely to protect their interests, and increases competition for 
influence over that decision authority. However, there may be benefit to asymmetries in 
power among individual stakeholders under constructive facilitation. The constructive 

57 
 
use of power can enhance effectiveness of a collaborative effort if the facilitator is well-
informed of the power dynamics, the sources and locations of power in a group to 
strategically provide dialogue space for all to influence decisions, clarify decision space, 
help hold members accountable to collective decisions, surface issues that provoke 
competition and use of power outside collaborative effort, and bring the agency to the 
table as a more active participant.  These efforts may enhance the group’s collective 
power toward positive outcomes such as enhancing total power through 
interdependencies and relationships and more effectively accomplishing common goals.  
Conclusion and Recommendations 
 
Assessing power dynamics in a collaborative effort can increase the strength in 
collaborative potential between stakeholders and the agencies they work with. 
Understanding where power is located and how power is expressed can increase the 
successful achievement of collaborative goals by establishing win-win mechanisms 
within the collaborative process. Power is not necessarily positive or negative, but a 
reality when strong interests and historic conflict frame a collaborative effort.  
 First, the USFS should recognize that collaborative potential decreases through 
the centralization of decision-authority which can be a primary source of conflict. The 
USFS should define what collaboration means in their culture and how retaining the 
power of decision authority affects the outcomes of goals they are attempting to 
collaboratively achieve. Shared power through decision authority must be consistent to 
build trust with stakeholders. There is a need for strong leadership and more clearly 
articulated decision space. The USFS should recognize the necessity for a mechanism 

58 
 
that will empower stakeholders to hold them accountable. Historically, litigation has 
served as that mechanism serving to slow or even halt projects altogether. Accountability 
and shared decision authority should be built into formal structures and upheld in the 
informal structures. Likewise, collaborative involvement requires consistency in 
participation from the USFS. Constraints on time and resources may influence operating 
on a temporal scale of involvement and therefore, the USFS should consider that sharing 
some decision authority, such as turning over specific planning processes to stakeholders, 
constraints on their time and resources would decrease. The agency also needs to clarify 
the role of the region and forest supervisors in an ambitious process such as this. 
Significant changes to policy are imminent to the success of collaboration in 
forest restoration and management. . NEPA and FACA are beneficial in many ways but 
are outdated mechanisms in an era of interdependency and collaboration and stifle the 
agency’s ability to rely on outside resources to enhance its power and legitimacy in 
collaboration with its partners.   
Secondly, stakeholders should understand the benefits of sources and locations of 
power. Pooling resources and locating power in coalitions and in the collective increases 
the total power and influence of the overall collective. Coalitions can be an effective 
mechanism for the entire collective to strategically utilize in influencing the agency’s 
collaborative involvement. Imbalances or asymmetries in power are inevitable and should 
be upheld as key elements to increase collaborative strength. For instance, one 
organization may have more political influence and another may have more funding and 
resources and another may have only their interest; Combined these organizations 
increase their total influence by having a full representation of all sources of power and 

59 
 
the legitimacy of representing multiple interests. Likewise, stakeholders should recognize 
that competition to influence decision-authority is one of the greatest sources of conflict 
within the collaborative and decreases collaborative potential. Utilizing the total power of 
the group through robust consensus decisions and clear mechanisms to support these to 
collectively influence decision authority is more effective than competing for that 
influence.  
Finally, interdependency is the greatest form of power in the collaborative 
process. Interdependency is an exchange of sources of power and strengthens the total 
power of the collaborative effort. Participants in collaboration should emphasize 
interdependency in their process by recognizing that each member engaged brings 
resources that contribute to the total power. The convening agency should recognize that 
being interdependent with a stakeholder group enhances their overall effectiveness in 
reaching their shared goal.  
Assessing power can increase stakeholders’ and the USFS’s ability to evaluate 
collaborative potential by understanding how sources of power, locations of power and 
power dynamics affect outcomes of a collaborative process. Successful collaborative 
processes depend on interested and affected parties believing they can individually and 
collectively achieve better outcomes by working together rather than by pursuing their 
interests unilaterally (Collaboration in NEPA, 2007).  This analysis offers an in depth 
look at the dynamics of power in a large-scale collaborative effort that is attempting to 
achieve forest restoration in way never accomplished before. Expressions of power 
dynamics in a group such as this can contribute to the development of a more innovative 
collaborative framework that will more effectively achieve desired goals and outcomes.
