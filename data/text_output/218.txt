Abstract.
The occurrence of wildﬁre is inﬂuenced by a suite of factors ranging from “top-down” inﬂu-
ences (e.g., climate) to “bottom-up” localized inﬂuences (e.g., ignitions, fuels, and land use). We carried out
the ﬁrst broad-scale assessment of wildland ﬁre patterns in northern Mexico to assess the relative inﬂuence
of top-down and bottom-up drivers of ﬁre in a region where frequent ﬁre regimes continued well into the
20th century. Using a network of 67 sites, we assessed (1) ﬁre synchrony and the scales at which synchrony
is evident, (2) climate drivers of ﬁre, and (3) asynchrony in ﬁre regime changes. We found high ﬁre
synchrony across northern Mexico between 1750 and 2008, with synchrony highest at distances <400 km.
Climate oscillations, especially El Ni~no-Southern Oscillation, were important drivers of ﬁre synchrony.
However, bottom-up factors modiﬁed ﬁre occurrence at smaller spatial scales, with variable local inﬂuence
on the timing of abrupt, unusually long ﬁre-free periods starting between 1887 and 1979 CE. Thirty sites
lacked these ﬁre-free periods. In contrast to the neighboring southwestern United States, many ecosystems
in northern Mexico maintain frequent ﬁre regimes and intact ﬁre–climate relationships that are useful in
understanding climate inﬂuences on disturbance across scales of space and time.

INTRODUCTION
The occurrence of wildﬁre in a given ecosystem
is inﬂuenced by a suite of factors ranging from
“top-down” inﬂuences such as climatic oscilla-
tions and regional drought, to “bottom-up” local-
ized inﬂuences such as ignitions, fuel availability,
land use, and topography (Falk et al. 2007, Gill
and Taylor 2009, McKenzie et al. 2011). Top-down
and bottom-up drivers also interact; for example,
climate patterns inﬂuence vegetation type and
fuel availability, and local soil and topography
can affect how strongly regional drought is
expressed. Strong top-down control over ﬁre at a
regional scale is evidenced by synchronous ﬁre
occurrence at widely separated sites, whereas bot-
tom-up drivers inﬂuence ﬁre spread and local
behavior, leading to more asynchronous ﬁre
occurrence among sites (Heyerdahl et al. 2001,
Falk et al. 2011). Abrupt and persistent shifts in
ﬁre regimes that are not related to climatic condi-
tions could also indicate the inﬂuence of bottom-
up drivers. A large spatial network is needed for
evaluating top-down/bottom-up inﬂuences beca-
use of the linkages between top-down inﬂuences
and ﬁre synchrony at widely separated sites and
between bottom-up inﬂuences and asynchrony.
Understanding cross-scale drivers of ﬁre and cli-
mate–ﬁre relationships is important for explaining
tree recruitment patterns (Meunier et al. 2014a),
carbon cycling (Mouillot and Field 2005), the rela-
tive importance of human vs. climate drivers of
ﬁre (Taylor et al. 2016), and for understanding
how ﬁre-adapted forests may respond to climate
change (Flannigan et al. 2009).
Climate is the dominant time-varying top-
down process regulating ﬁre regimes. Using cen-
turies-long records of ﬁre from ﬁre scars in tree
rings and reconstructed climate indices, climate
has been shown to inﬂuence ﬁre occurrence in
North American regions such as the southwestern
United States (e.g., Swetnam 1990, Swetnam and
Betancourt 1990, Swetnam and Baisan 1996, Gris-
sino-Mayer and Swetnam 2000), the Paciﬁc North-
west and southwestern Canada (e.g., Hessl et al.
2004, Heyerdahl et al. 2008a), the northern Rocky
Mountains (e.g., Heyerdahl et al. 2008b), and
Utah (Brown et al. 2008). Climate drives synchro-
nous ﬁre even at the scale of the North and South
American continents (e.g., Kitzberger et al. 2001,
2007,
Trouet
et al.
2010,
Falk
et al.
2011).
Collectively,
these
studies
comprise
a
major
archive of a key ecological process, as well as how
climate inﬂuences that process, representing hun-
dreds of study sites and tens of thousands of trees
(Falk et al. 2010, 2011). Fire regime reconstruc-
tions from ﬁre-scarred trees typically represent
ecosystems with relatively frequent surface ﬁres
that most dominant trees survive, albeit some-
times with scars. Evidence from systems with
infrequent, stand-replacing ﬁre regimes in North
America suggests that similar ﬁre–climate rela-
tionships exist, although at longer time scales
(Schoennagel et al. 2005, Sibold and Veblen 2006).
These networks of ﬁre history sites have shown
that large-scale spatial and temporal patterns of
ﬁre occurrence are highly correlated with the
occurrence of regional drought (Falk et al. 2010).
Droughts and pluvials are in turn driven
by teleconnections with major coupled ocean–
atmosphere oscillatory modes in the climate sys-
tem (Diaz et al. 2001, Gray et al. 2003, McCabe
et al. 2004, Woodhouse et al. 2009). The El
Ni~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) affects ﬁre
occurrence throughout western North and South
America, particularly the occurrence of widespread
ﬁre years across thousands of kilometers (e.g.,
Swetnam and Betancourt 1990, Kitzberger et al.
2001). Longer-phase climate oscillations, including
the Paciﬁc Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the
Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), interact
with ENSO to reinforce or dampen regional
drought conditions, which in turn inﬂuence histori-
cal ﬁre occurrence patterns (Hessl et al. 2004,
Schoennagel et al. 2005, Taylor and Beaty 2005,
Sibold and Veblen 2006). However, most previous
studies are limited to analyzing climate–ﬁre rela-
tionships before the 20th century, because in much
of North America north of Mexico, ﬁre regimes
were interrupted in the late nineteenth century by
human inﬂuence, including livestock grazing and
other land-use changes (Belsky and Blumenthal
1997, Heyerdahl et al. 2001, Swetnam et al. 2001).
Potentially facilitating our understanding of
the historical and current relationships between
climate and ﬁre in North America, some areas
in northern Mexico maintain relatively intact ﬁre–
climate dynamics. Human impacts in the moun-
tains of northern Mexico have followed a different
history
than
the
United
States,
with
large-
scale livestock introduction largely deferred until
post-revolutionary land reforms in the mid- to

late-twentieth century. Comprehensive ﬁre sup-
pression was never achieved in some areas,
despite management policies requiring it (e.g.,
Leopold 1937, Rodrıguez-Trejo and Fule 2003,
Skinner et al. 2008, Fule et al. 2012). Heyerdahl
and Alvarado (2003) suggested that ﬁre exclusion,
where it did occur, was closely associated with
the formation of ejidos, which are communally
held and managed lands. When ejidos were
granted as part of an agrarian land reform in the
early to mid-twentieth century, ﬁre regimes may
have changed due to increased livestock grazing,
road building, logging, and changing the tradi-
tional role of ﬁre (Heyerdahl and Alvarado 2003).
A documented example of livestock grazing
expansion associated with ﬁre regime interrup-
tion was described by Fule and Covington (1999).
Although some sites were interrupted around the
time of ejido formation (e.g., Heyerdahl and Alvar-
ado 2003, Poulos et al. 2013), a few sites experi-
enced ﬁre regime interruption in the late 1800s or
early 1900s, long before the formation of ejidos
(e.g., Yocom et al. 2010), and ﬁre regimes at other
sites have ﬁres continuing to the present (e.g.,
Fule et al. 2011).
A network of ﬁre history sites has been devel-
oped in northern Mexico over the past several
decades. Many of these sites have been used to
explore ﬁre–climate relationships as well as his-
torical ﬁre regimes, although climate linkages to
ﬁre occurrence have been studied only at the scale
of individual sites or within mountain ranges.
Only in the last few years are new data sets being
completed that expand the network to eastern
Mexico (Yocom et al. 2010, 2014, Poulos et al.
2013) and northern Chihuahua (Fule et al. 2011,
Meunier et al. 2014b). Until the establishment of a
large ﬁre history network, a broad-scale analysis
of top-down and bottom-up drivers of ﬁre has not
been possible for this part of North America.
Our goal was to assess the patterns and drivers
of ﬁre regimes across northern Mexico. Our ﬁrst
objective was to quantify synchrony of ﬁre across
spatial scales. Our second objective was to evalu-
ate the inﬂuence of climate on ﬁre occurrence
across the region. Synchrony of ﬁres (and non-
ﬁre years) at broad scales among distant sites,
and relationships between ﬁre dates and climatic
oscillations such as ENSO, are evidence of top-
down climatic inﬂuences. Our last objective was
to assess asynchrony in dates of abrupt changes
in ﬁre regimes, which would reﬂect bottom-up,
local inﬂuence on the timing of these changes.
METHODS
We included 67 ﬁre history sites in northern
Mexico, originally sampled as individual research
projects (Fule and Covington 1997, 1999, Heyer-
dahl and Alvarado 2003, Fule et al. 2005, 2011,
2012, Drury and Veblen 2008, Skinner et al. 2008,
Cerano Paredes et al. 2010, Yocom et al. 2010,
2014, Poulos et al. 2013, Meunier et al. 2014b, P. Z.
Fulé, unpublished data; Appendix S1: Table S1). The
sites extend geographically from northern Baja
California in the west, east to the Sierra Madre Ori-
ental, north in the Sierra Madre Occidental to close
to the U.S.–Mexico border, and south in the Sierra
Madre Occidental to southern Durango (Fig. 1).
All sites are at 1500 m above sea level or higher
and are dominated by conifer species. Eighteen
tree species were sampled across all sites, includ-
ing 14 species of pine (Appendix S1: Table S2). Fire
chronologies were assembled from the Interna-
tional Multiproxy Paleoﬁre Database or con-
tributed by the original investigators. At each site,
ﬁre-scar data were sampled in an area ranging
from 2 to 353 ha (mean 29, SD 49), and the num-
ber of crossdated ﬁre-scarred tree samples from
each site ranged from 6 to 104 (mean 29, SD 16;
Appendix S1: Table S1). Although the area sam-
pled and the number of samples collected varied
widely between sites, we used all sites in this anal-
ysis because we did not calculate statistics such as
the mean ﬁre interval, where widely variable site
size or the number of samples could be problem-
atic for comparison between sites (van Horne and
Fule 2006). We identiﬁed ﬁre years at each site as
those years when scars occurred on ≥2 trees (to
eliminate lightning scars or very small ﬁres that
scarred only one tree), and these dates were com-
piled into site chronologies.
We grouped the 67 sites into ﬁve geographic
regions,
designated
Baja,
Occidental
North,
Occidental Central, Occidental South, and Orien-
tal (Fig. 1). We identiﬁed “within-region” syn-
chronous ﬁre years as those in which multiple
sites in a region recorded ﬁre, to evaluate climate
impacts on ﬁres separately for each region. To do
this, we identiﬁed the years of highest ﬁre syn-
chrony among sites within each region (range 23–
31 yr identiﬁed per region). We also identiﬁed

“across-region” synchronous ﬁre years as those
when ≥4 regions recorded ﬁre synchronously. We
identiﬁed no-ﬁre years as those when 0 regions
recorded a ﬁre, and we also identiﬁed years when
one, two, or three regions recorded a ﬁre.
To assess ﬁre synchrony across scales, we ﬁrst
calculated Jaccard distance in ﬁre dates for every
pair of sites. We then analyzed Jaccard distance as
a function of geographic distance between each
pair of sites using a Mantel test (Mantel 1967) and
a Mantel correlogram (Oden and Sokal 1986, Bor-
card and Legendre 2012). A Mantel test analyzes
the correlation between two distance matrices (in
this case, Jaccard distance and geographic dis-
tance), while a Mantel correlogram tests for corre-
lation at different distance classes (Legendre and
Legendre 1998). We used the functions “mantel”
and “mantel.correlog,” each with 1000 permuta-
tions, in the R package “vegan” for these tests
(Oksanen et al. 2016), and we set breakpoints in
the Mantel correlogram for every 100 km.
We compared ﬁre chronologies (from 1750 to
2005) to an independently derived tree-ring recon-
struction of ENSO to assess potential climate
forcing, using a winter NINO3 (December through
February) SST anomaly index (Cook et al. 2008).
Negative (positive) NINO3 index values are associ-
ated with La Ni~na (El Ni~no) conditions. To address
temporal autocorrelation in the NINO3 index, we
ﬁt autoregressive integrated moving average mod-
els and used the resulting white noise residuals in
our analyses. To evaluate the inﬂuence of ENSO
on ﬁre occurrence, we used superposed epoch
analysis (SEA) in FHX2 (Grissino-Mayer 1995) to
compare ﬁre occurrence with NINO3 climate
index values during ﬁre years, ﬁve years prior to
ﬁre years, and two years after ﬁre years. To assess
statistical signiﬁcance of the SEA results, we calcu-
lated 95% conﬁdence intervals using bootstrapped
distributions of climate data in 1000 trials.
We evaluated the inﬂuence of two-way and
three-way combinations of the phases of AMO,
PDO, and ENSO on ﬁre occurrence in northern
Mexico, from 1750 to 1990 (D’Arrigo et al. 2001,
Gray et al. 2004, Cook et al. 2008). Although Kipf-
mueller et al. (2012) suggested that linking PDO
with historical ﬁres is problematic because differ-
ent reconstructions yield different results, PDO

has been identiﬁed as a potentially important dri-
ver of regional ﬁre across a range of forested
ecosystems (Schoennagel et al. 2005, Kitzberger
et al. 2007, Margolis and Swetnam 2013). We used
the D’Arrigo et al. (2001) reconstruction because
it is based on a wide geographic range of trees,
including trees from northern Mexico (see Mar-
golis and Swetnam 2013). Expected values of ﬁre
occurrence in each phase combination were calcu-
lated from the proportion of years from 1750 to
1990 in each of the combinations, and observed
values were the number of across-region ﬁre years
in each phase combination. We used v2 goodness-
of-ﬁt tests to compare the expected ﬁre occurrence
with
observed
ﬁre
occurrence
to
determine
whether ﬁres occurred disproportionately during
particular phase combinations of large-scale cli-
mate oscillations (positive and negative phases of
AMO, PDO, and ENSO). P-values were calculated
using
a
Monte
Carlo
simulation,
randomly
sampling from the expected ﬁre occurrence distri-
bution, with 1000 replicates. Statistics were calcu-
lated using the “Stats” package in R (R Core
Team 2015).
To determine dates of ﬁre regime interruption,
for each site we identiﬁed the last ﬁre date before
an unusually long ﬁre-free interval, deﬁned as
greater than the mean ﬁre interval for that site
plus two standard deviations of the mean, and
greater than 12 yr, representing half of the inter-
val commonly used to designate “frequent” ﬁre
regimes (Heinselman 1973).
RESULTS
Between 1750 and 2005, there were 13 yr when
all ﬁve regions in northern Mexico recorded ﬁre:
1798, 1820, 1838, 1851, 1860, 1874, 1877, 1894,
1899, 1902, 1909, 1916, and 1917. There were an
additional 55 yr when four regions recorded ﬁre;
we
designated
the
68 yr
when
≥4
regions
recorded ﬁre as across-region synchronous ﬁre
years (Appendix S1: Fig. S1). There were 48 yr in
which only one region recorded a ﬁre, 63 yr
in which two regions recorded a ﬁre, and 52 yr in
which three regions recorded a ﬁre. There were
25 yr in which no ﬁres were recorded in any of
the regions.
Jaccard distance in ﬁre dates was signiﬁcantly
related to geographic distance between sites based
on results of the Mantel test (r = 0.31, P < 0.001).
Plotting the Mantel correlogram results (Fig. 2a),
as well as the Jaccard distance index as a function
of geographic distance between each pair of sites
(Fig. 2b), revealed that ﬁre dates were more simi-
lar at closer geographic distances. Jaccard distance
was positively and signiﬁcantly associated with
geographic distance for the ﬁrst four distance
classes, under 400 km (Fig. 2a).
El Ni~no-Southern Oscillation by itself was a
signiﬁcant driver of synchronous ﬁre years.
Average NINO3 values were signiﬁcantly low
(La Ni~na-type conditions) in years when ≥4
regions recorded ﬁre, and signiﬁcantly high (El
Ni~no-type conditions) in years when 0 regions
recorded ﬁre (Fig. 3). Average NINO3 values

were signiﬁcantly low in within-region ﬁre years
in Baja, Occidental North, Occidental Central,
and
Oriental,
but
not
in
Occidental
South
(Appendix S1: Fig. S2). ENSO in antecedent years
was important in some regions as well: NINO3
values were signiﬁcantly above-average one year
prior to ﬁre years in Occidental North and one
and two years prior to ﬁre in Occidental South
(Appendix S1: Fig. S2).
In the three-way combinations of climate oscilla-
tion phases, there were more ﬁres than expected in
the combinations where PDO and ENSO were
both negative, especially when AMO was positive
(Fig. 4). The chi-square test for the three-way com-
binations was signiﬁcant (v2 = 17.1, P = 0.02). In
two-way combinations, ﬁres occurred more often
than expected when both the PDO and ENSO
were in negative phases (v2 = 14.2, P = 0.003), and
when AMO was positive and ENSO was negative
(v2 = 12.7,
P = 0.007).
Expected
vs.
observed
number of ﬁres were not signiﬁcantly different in
AMO 9 PDO two-way combinations.
Fire interruption dates ranged from 1887 to
1979; 30 (45%) sites never experienced ﬁre inter-
ruption (Fig. 5). The Sierra Madre Oriental
experienced ﬁre regime interruption earliest of
the ﬁve regions (several sites prior to 1920),
although there was variation within the region,
with ﬁre interruption dates ranging from 1887
to 1952. Three sites in that region had uninter-
rupted ﬁre regimes according to our deﬁnition.
Fire
regime
interruption
in
Baja
California
occurred between 1932 and 1955, with ﬁve sites
not experiencing ﬁre interruption. In Occidental
North, most sites had a ﬁre regime interruption
between 1932 and 1955, with four sites record-
ing uninterrupted frequent ﬁre. In Occidental
Central, seven sites maintained uninterrupted

ﬁre regimes; other sites had a change in ﬁre
regime as early as 1935 and four experienced a
change in the 1950s. In Occidental South, ﬁre
regime interruption dates were again scattered,
ranging from 1930 through the subsequent dec-
ades. Eleven sites in this region had a continu-
ous record of ﬁre.
DISCUSSION
Top-down and bottom-up drivers of ﬁre are
evident in the patterns of ﬁre seen across northern
Mexico. The inﬂuence of top-down (climatic) fac-
tors can be seen in the synchrony of ﬁres over
time and space, with 68 yr (27%) of high ﬁre syn-
chrony during the period of analysis, and an addi-
tional 25 synchronous years (10%) in which none
of the regions recorded ﬁre. Although synchrony
was noted across the entire study area of northern
Mexico, spatial autocorrelation is present in ﬁre
dates, and as would be expected, synchrony of
ﬁres appears to be stronger at shorter geographic
distances, up to about 400 km.
Climate was a signiﬁcant driver of the syn-
chrony seen in northern Mexico. We found an
association between La Ni~na conditions (negative
phase of ENSO) and across-region synchronous
ﬁre years (≥4 regions), as well as a signiﬁcant
association between La Ni~na conditions and
within-region synchronous ﬁre years in four of
the ﬁve regions. The ENSO–ﬁre association is
founded on the connection between ENSO and
precipitation;
modern
Mexican
precipitation
records show a clear link to ENSO phases (Caso
et al. 2007). Modern ﬁre atlas records are tempo-
rally and spatially limited, but our results are also
corroborated by Navar Chaidez (2011), who
found that an index of ENSO explained over 30%
of variation in area burned in the state of Durango
in recent years. It is notable, however, that within-
region synchronous years in Occidental South
were not signiﬁcantly related to La Ni~na years in
our study; this is the same result that Drury and
Veblen (2008) found in this region. Drury and
Veblen (2008) suggested that in the southern
Sierra Madre Occidental, other climatic drivers
were more important; it is close to the transition
zone north of which La Ni~na events are associated
with dry conditions and south of which El Ni~no
conditions are associated with dry conditions
(Stahle et al. 2012, also see climate maps in Caso
et al. 2007 and Yocom and Fule 2012).
The PDO and AMO were also inﬂuential in
driving
across-regional
ﬁre
occurrence,
with
greater than expected numbers of synchronous
ﬁres occurring when PDO was negative and
AMO was positive, in combination with negative
ENSO. The PDO has also been shown to be a sig-
niﬁcant driver of ﬁre in western North America

tions are represented by + symbols, and cool (negative)

differences between expected and observed propor-
tions of ﬁre occurrence (represented by ) were eval-

(Kitzberger et al. 2007) and in regional studies in
the Paciﬁc Northwest (Hessl et al. 2004, Heyer-
dahl et al. 2008a), western Colorado (Schoennagel
et al. 2007), and Utah (Brown et al. 2008). The
AMO has been shown to drive ﬁre synchrony at a
continental scale (Kitzberger et al. 2007). Although
top-down inﬂuences are important, their strength
in synchronizing ﬁre varies among regions in
northern Mexico. For example, in Baja California,
a maximum of 50% of sites (5/10) ever recorded
ﬁre in the same year, but there were two instances
when 100% of the 11 sites in Occidental North
recorded ﬁre in the same year.
Fire regime interruption dates were highly vari-
able across sites, spreading over nearly 100 yr.
Almost half of the sites were classiﬁed as having
an uninterrupted ﬁre regime. It should be noted,
however, that although we calculated ﬁre inter-
ruption using a mathematical deﬁnition to avoid
bias, several sites that were categorized as having
continuous ﬁre (e.g., MA in Oriental, CA in Occi-
dental South, and TM in Occidental North)
seemed to shift toward longer ﬁre intervals during
the 20th century (Appendix S1: Fig. S1). This
means that even in “uninterrupted” sites, ﬁre may
not be occurring at the same frequency as it did
historically. We did not ﬁnd evidence across
northern Mexico of the “hiatus” in ﬁre in the
transition from the late 18th to the early 19th
century that has been pointed out in sites in the
western United States and in Baja California (e.g.,
Swetnam 1990, Swetnam and Betancourt 1998,
Stephens et al. 2003), although in some regions
the ﬁre record may not be long enough to detect
such a hiatus (Appendix S1: Fig. S1). Stephens
et al. (2003) suggested three potential reasons for
the change in ﬁre that was noted in the late 18th
century in Baja California: grazing, a decline in
native populations, and changes in regional cli-
mate. The ﬁrst two reasons were related to the
establishment of the San Pedro Martir Mission,
which is a special circumstance not applicable to
other sites in northern Mexico.
The variability in ﬁre regime interruption dates
and the presence of only one site in northern Mex-
ico (out of 67) with a ﬁre regime interruption date
before 1900 are in striking contrast to the adjacent
southwestern United States, where ﬁre regimes
were typically interrupted in a period between
about 1870 and 1900 (Fig. 5; Swetnam and Baisan
2003, although see Grissino-Mayer and Swetnam
2000, Sakulich and Taylor 2007, and Poulos et al.
2013 for examples of locations where frequent ﬁres
continued into the 1920s or later). This interrup-
tion has been attributed to the removal of Native
Americans, introduction of sheep and other live-
stock, other land-use changes, and subsequent ﬁre
suppression policies (Savage and Swetnam 1990,
Belsky and Blumenthal 1997, O’Connor et al.
2014, Taylor et al. 2016). The variability in ﬁre
regime interruption dates across northern Mexico
is consistent with the mechanism of human land
use as the driving force behind changing ﬁre
regimes over the 19th and 20th centuries in
Fig. 5. Left: map showing ﬁre interruption dates in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.

western North America. In a direct cross-border
comparison between mountain ranges separated
by only 150 km in Arizona, United States, and
Chihuahua, Mexico, Fule et al. (2012) found that
ﬁre regimes in both ranges were indistinguishable
and synchronized by climate before 1892, after
which
ﬁres
were
abruptly
and
completely
excluded from the Arizona sites. Fire regimes in
the four Chihuahua study sites continued uninter-
rupted until the 1950s with one site burning fre-
quently up to the present (Fule et al. 2012). Forests
where modern ﬁres continue in historical patterns
in synchrony with contemporary climate, such as
many sites in northern Mexico, provide a rare
opportunity to examine climate–ﬁre relationships
without major human-caused alteration.
In northern Mexico, variable local land-use his-
tory is the likely reason for the variability in ﬁre
interruption dates. For example, the three sites at
Pino Gordo, which have an uninterrupted ﬁre
regime, are difﬁcult to access, and internal politi-
cal struggles have kept logging from occurring
there (Fule et al. 2011). In other sites, ﬁre inter-
ruption was coincident with the formation of eji-
dos (Heyerdahl and Alvarado 2003, Drury and
Veblen 2008, Poulos et al. 2013) or reduction in
Native American populations that used ﬁre
(Evett et al. 2007). In contrast to the western Uni-
ted States, where a wave of settlers, livestock,
and railways washed across much of the territory
before 1900 and changed the ﬁre regime of wide-
spread areas within a short time (Swetnam and
Baisan 2003, Taylor et al. 2016), many sites in
Mexico have individual stories of land use,
human interaction, and ﬁre regime change.
The climate in the southwest and northern Mex-
ico is projected to become more arid in the near
future, with this transition already underway
(Seager et al. 2007, 2009). Drier conditions are con-
ducive to ﬁre spread, and longer, warmer sum-
mers have been linked to greater area burned in
the western United States (Westerling et al. 2006).
On the other hand, ﬁne fuel production may be
limited with drier conditions, resulting in less fre-
quent ﬁres. As climate change projections and our
understanding of how climate change will impact
Mexico
improve
(Saenz-Romero
et al.
2010),
explorations of historical climate–ﬁre relationships
will provide insight into future ﬁre regimes.
Information from the Mexican network is being
applied to align national ﬁre policy more closely
with quantitative data on the ﬁre ecology of speci-
ﬁc forest types (Rodrıguez-Trejo 2008, Jardel et al.
2014). Sites with continuing ﬁre regimes have
provided insights into forest structure (Fule and
Covington 1997), fuel biomass (Stephens et al.
2007), ﬁre behavior (Rivera-Huerta et al. 2016),
and wildlife habitat (unpublished manuscript) that
are unavailable for study elsewhere. In addition,
many sites in Mexico that have maintained an
active disturbance regime may be more resilient
in the future as climate continues to change,
providing a valuable model for other North
American forests considered vulnerable to climate
change (Stephens et al. 2010, Hurteau et al. 2014).
