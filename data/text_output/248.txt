Abstract.
Long-term studies can broaden our ecological understanding and are
particularly important when examining contingent effects that involve changes to dominance
by long-lived species. Such a change occurred during the last century in Southwestern (USA)
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests. We used ﬁve livestock grazing exclosures established
in 1912 to quantify vegetation structure in 1941 and 2004. Our objectives were to (1) assess the
effects of historical livestock grazing on overstory structure and age distribution, (2) assess the
effects of recent livestock grazing and overstory on understory vegetation, and (3) quantify
and explain changes in understory vegetation between 1941 and 2004. In 1941, canopy cover
of tree regeneration was signiﬁcantly higher inside exclosures. In 2004, total tree canopy cover
was twice as high, density was three times higher, trees were smaller, and total basal area was
40% higher inside exclosures. Understory species density, herbaceous plant density, and
herbaceous cover were negatively correlated with overstory vegetation in both years. Most
understory variables did not differ between grazing treatments in 1941 but were lower inside
exclosures in 2004. Differences between grazing treatments disappeared once overstory effects
were accounted for, indicating that they were due to the differential overstory response to
historical livestock grazing practices. Between 1941 and 2004, species density declined by 34%,
herbaceous plant density by 37%, shrub cover by 69%, total herbaceous cover by 59%,
graminoid cover by 39%, and forb cover by 82%. However, these variables did not differ
between grazing treatments or years once overstory effects were accounted for, indicating that
the declines were driven by the increased dominance of the overstory during this period. Our
results demonstrate that historical livestock grazing practices are an aspect of land-use history
that can affect ecosystem development. Grazing history must be considered when
extrapolating results from one site to another. In addition, the understory vegetation was
more strongly controlled by the ponderosa pine overstory than by recent livestock grazing or
by temporal dynamics, indicating that overstory effects must be accounted for when
examining understory responses in this ecosystem.

INTRODUCTION
Long-term studies can broaden our understanding of
reference conditions (Moore et al. 1999), invasion by
exotic species (Strayer et al. 2006), vegetation dynamics,
and successional theory (Bakker et al. 2002, Rango et al.
2005). Remeasurements of long-term permanent plots
have demonstrated large changes in species composition
(Crawley et al. 2005) and forest structure (Moore et al.
2004). Long-term studies are also necessary to detect
responses that are contingent upon site differences,
interannual variability, or other factors (Bakker et al.
2003, Yeo 2005).
Contingent effects may be particularly important
when they involve changes in life form dominance
(House et al. 2003), particularly to dominance by long-
lived species. This type of transition occurred in the
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson var.
scopulorum Engelm.) forests of the southwestern United
States in the early 1900s. Lines of evidence pointing to
increased tree densities include repeat photography
(Gordon et al. 1992; see Fig. 1, Plate 1), written
accounts of early explorers (Cooper 1960), stand
reconstruction modeling (Fule´ et al. 1997), and remea-
surements of historical permanent plots (Moore et al.
2004). Fire exclusion was an important factor contrib-
uting to increased tree densities in these forests (Weaver
1951, Cooper 1960, Covington and Moore 1994, Fule´ et
al. 1997), but it likely was not the only factor. For
example, woody plant encroachment often coincides
with intense livestock grazing (Archer 1994) and tree
densities are often higher in grazed areas than in relict
areas, where topographic features prevent access by

livestock (Rummell 1951, Schmutz et al. 1967, Madany
and West 1983; cf. Harris et al. 2003, Guenther et al.
2004).
A growing body of evidence demonstrates that land-
use history can constrain subsequent vegetation devel-
opment (Dupouey et al. 2002, Foster et al. 2003, Briggs
et al. 2006, Fraterrigo et al. 2006). Historical livestock
grazing practices may have had similar effects, partic-
ularly at very unsustainable intensities as occurred in the
Southwest in the late 1800s (Haskett 1936, Abruzzi 1995,
Fredrickson et al. 1998). Woody plants are most
sensitive to grazing when young (Archer 1994), but
effects could remain evident due to their long life spans.
Grazing is thought to have promoted the establishment
of ponderosa pine seedlings in the Southwest by
reducing the competitive dominance of the herbaceous
understory vegetation (Pearson 1942, Elliott and White
1987).
Of course, livestock also directly impact the shrub and
herbaceous species on which they graze. Models suggest
that livestock grazing should negatively affect plant
diversity in semiarid environments such as the South-
west (Olff and Ritchie 1998, Cingolani et al. 2005).
However, understory vegetation is also affected by the
tree overstory (Arnold 1950, Moore and Deiter 1992,
Naumburg and DeWald 1999), and the relative impor-
tance of grazing and overstory effects on the understory
is unclear.
Qualitative assessments from photographs and early
written accounts (Cooper 1960) suggest that understory
vegetation was more abundant in Southwestern ponder-
osa pine forests historically than at present. This
conclusion is consistent with historical reconstruction
models (Covington and Moore 1994) and observed
vegetation responses following contemporary thinning
experiments (Moore et al. 2006). However, quantitative
data about long-term changes in understory vegetation
in this region are rare.
We used a series of long-term livestock grazing
exclosures to quantify overstory and understory vegeta-
tion structure in 1941 and 2004. Our objectives were to
(1) assess the effects of historical livestock grazing on
overstory structure and age distribution, (2) assess the
effects of recent livestock grazing and overstory on
understory vegetation, and (3) quantify and explain
changes in understory vegetation between 1941 and
2004.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
In 1912, R. R. Hill established livestock grazing
exclosures at ﬁve sites within 25 km of Flagstaff,
Arizona, USA (Arnold 1950). These sites (the ‘‘Hill
plots’’) vary in soil type and span the elevational range
of the ponderosa pine forest type in northern Arizona
(Table 1). Four sites are located in Coconino National
Forest, and one (Rogers Lake) in Northern Arizona
University’s Centennial Forest. At each site, an ex-
closure was built to exclude livestock (sheep and cattle)
but not wild ungulates (Fig. 1). Each exclosure was
paired with an adjacent area that continued to be
grazed. Researchers described all sites as ‘‘overgrazed’’
when the exclosures were built (Talbot and Hill 1923).
Sites were grazed by cattle and sheep since the 1870s,
though grazing intensities have declined over time
(Table 1).
Four sites were selectively harvested before the
exclosures were built, and several sites received subse-

quent silvicultural treatments (Table 1). Because these
treatments were applied inside and outside the exclo-
sures, they are considered part of the inter-site
variability. The exclosures were actively maintained for
at least ﬁve decades after establishment. The exclosure
fences continue to be maintained at sites that are grazed
by livestock, but have fallen into disrepair at two sites
(Black Springs and Reese Tank) that are no longer
grazed by livestock (Table 1). These sites were included
in analyses of overstory vegetation in 2004 because our
interest was in the long-term effects of historical
livestock grazing practices, but were omitted from
analyses of understory vegetation in 2004 because
understory vegetation was assumed to be more respon-
sive to recent livestock grazing practices. Half of the
area outside the exclosure at Black Springs was
destroyed by an interstate highway in the 1950s, so
2004 measurements were made on the other side of the
exclosure.
Sampling occurred in 1941 and 2004. At the Fort
Valley Experiment Station, precipitation from Septem-
ber 1940 to August 1941 totaled 83.4 cm, or 148% of the
long-term mean (1909–2004; USDA Forest Service
2004). Precipitation from September 2003 to August
2004 totaled 35.6 cm, or 63% of the long-term mean.
Field methods
In 1941, G. Glendening subdivided each grazing
treatment (i.e., inside or outside the exclosure) at each
site into 10–20 strata to simplify sampling and distribute
it across the entire area (Fig. 2). Strata were sampled
using the line transect method (Canﬁeld 1941) with 2–4
lines per stratum (Table 1, Fig. 2), for a total of 520
lines. The location of each line was selected by randomly

choosing X, Y starting coordinates. Lines were 15.24 m
(50 ft) long and oriented parallel to the long axis of the
stratum. In 2004, we used the same starting coordinates
where possible (the starting coordinates were recorded
on the 1941 data sheets for 79% of lines), otherwise we
generated new starting coordinates. The 1941 data were
published in summary form by Arnold (1950), who
focused on overstory–understory relationships.
Overstory vegetation was quantiﬁed as canopy cover
(percentage of line directly beneath tree crowns) and tree
density (number of trees within a 1.22 m (4 ft) wide belt
centered on the line). In 1941, canopy cover and tree
density were measured separately for mature trees (.25
years old; no minimum size) and regeneration of each
species (Glendening 1941). In 2004, canopy cover and
tree density were measured in total for each species
because there were very few young trees.
Understory vegetation was measured using the line
transect method (Canﬁeld 1941), which deals differently
with herbaceous and shrub species. Each time a
herbaceous plant was encountered that was rooted
directly beneath the line, its basal cover was measured
as the distance it occupied along the line. Each time a
shrub was encountered that hung over the line, its foliar
cover was measured by projecting the plant canopy
down onto the line. Distances were recorded to the
nearest ;0.3 cm (0.01 ft) in 1941 and to the nearest 0.25
cm in 2004. Total species density (sensu Gotelli and
Colwell 2001) was calculated as the number of species
(both herbaceous and shrub) recorded on a line.
Herbaceous plant density was calculated as the number
of herbaceous plants per line. Shrub density was not
calculated because it is unknown how many times the

canopy of each plant overlapped the line. The percent
cover of each species on each line was calculated as the
sum of the recorded distances for that species divided by
the line length. Covers of herbaceous and shrub species
were analyzed separately because they were measured
using different methods. Herbaceous cover data were
analyzed in total and separately for graminoid and forb
life forms. Nomenclature is based on the USDA Natural
Resources Conservation Service PLANTS database
(USDA 2004).
In 2003–2004, the overstory vegetation was also
measured within 4–7 20 3 20 m plots within each
grazing treatment at each site. These plots were centered
on permanent chart quadrats (J. D. Bakker and M. M.
Moore, unpublished data) and therefore partially over-
lapped, so data were summarized for the total area
sampled in each grazing treatment and site. In total, the
species identity and diameter at breast height (dbh;
measured 1.37 m above ground level) were measured for
1626 live trees taller than breast height, and the total
basal area (square meters per hectare) was calculated for
each grazing treatment and site. All live trees were also
cored 40 cm above ground level and aged using standard
dendrochronological methods (Stokes and Smiley 1968).
Contemporary diameter and age distributions were
obtained for each grazing treatment and site.
Analyses
Analyses of line transect data were restricted to lines
outside of localized disturbances (powerline rights-of-
way and roads) and prescribed burns; 520 lines from
1941 and 480 lines from 2004 met these criteria (Table
1). As described previously, understory analyses in 2004
were restricted to the three sites grazed by livestock in
recent years (389 lines). Cover data were arcsine (square
root x) transformed and density data were log(x þ 1)-
transformed for analysis. We used a ¼ 0.05 throughout.
Results from multiple sites were combined using
meta-analytic techniques. These techniques were devel-
oped to combine the results of multiple studies, which is
conceptually and analytically similar to combining
results from multiple sites (Gurevitch and Hedges
1999; a similar application is found in Yeo [2005]).
Statistical details and formulae are provided in Appen-
dix A. Brieﬂy, we calculated the grazing or year effect
size (dij) of site j in class i (year when testing grazing
effects, grazing treatment when testing year effects) for
each variable. Effect sizes from individual sites were
combined using a mixed-effects model, which assumes
random variation in effect size among and within sites
(Gurevitch and Hedges 2001). Most meta-analyses
included all ﬁve sites though, as described before, two
sites were excluded from meta-analyses of understory
effects in 2004. The cumulated effect size (i.e., the overall
effect across sites; d
iþ) was assessed for signiﬁcance by
converting it to a z statistic (Lipsey and Wilson 2001).
Effect sizes were also converted into correlation
coefﬁcients (rij) that were combined to yield a common
correlation coefﬁcient across sites (riþ).
Our ﬁrst objective was to evaluate the effect of
historical livestock grazing on overstory structure and
age distributions. We used meta-analytic techniques to
assess the signiﬁcance of grazing treatments on canopy
cover and tree density in 1941 and 2004. Kolmogorov-
Smirnov tests (implemented in SPSS version 13.0; SPSS
2004) were used to compare diameter and age distribu-
tions from 2004 between grazing treatments. A paired t
test was used to compare total basal area in 2004
between grazing treatments.
Our second objective was to assess the effects of recent
livestock grazing and overstory vegetation on the
understory vegetation. Overstory effects were quantiﬁed
using multiple regression with tree canopy cover and tree
density as independent variables and understory vari-
ables as dependent variables. Because our objective was
to relate the understory to the overstory immediately
around it, lines were considered the experimental units
for these regressions. Grazing effects were assessed using
two meta-analyses to combine the results from individ-
ual sites. One meta-analysis used the unadjusted
understory data and the other the residuals after
adjusting for overstory effects. By comparing the
cumulated effect sizes and common correlation coefﬁ-
cients from the two analyses, we assessed the importance
of grazing effects before and after accounting for
overstory effects.
Our third objective was to quantify and explain
changes in understory vegetation between 1941 and
2004. Strata means (averaged across all undisturbed
lines) were the experimental units for analyses of
temporal dynamics because the starting coordinates
used in 1941 were not available for all lines, and because
lines may not have been precisely relocated. Strata that

were not measured in both years were omitted from
analyses of temporal dynamics. We performed two
meta-analyses, one with unadjusted understory data and
one with the residuals after adjusting for overstory
effects in each year. Separate analyses were conducted
for each grazing treatment, and the between-class
homogeneity statistic (QB) was used to test for
differences between grazing treatments. Cumulated
temporal effect sizes were reported separately for each
grazing treatment if QB was statistically signiﬁcant;
otherwise, the grand cumulated temporal effect size (i.e.,
across both grazing treatments and all sites) was
reported.
RESULTS
Grazing effects on overstory vegetation
Six tree species (alligator juniper [Juniperus deppeana
Steud.], oneseed juniper [J. monosperma (Engelm.)
Sarg.], pinyon pine [Pinus edulis Engelm.], limber pine
[P. ﬂexilis James], ponderosa pine, and gambel oak
[Quercus gambelii Nutt.]) were present on the sites, but
ponderosa pine comprised .99% of the overstory in
both years. Therefore, comparisons were made for all
trees rather than for individual species.
In 1941, canopy cover of mature trees did not differ
between grazing treatments but canopy cover of
regeneration was signiﬁcantly higher inside than outside
exclosures (Table 2). Regeneration and total tree
densities did not differ overall (Table 2) because
densities were signiﬁcantly higher inside exclosures at
three sites and outside the exclosure at one site
(Appendix B). In 2004, total canopy cover was almost
twice as high inside as outside exclosures and total tree
density was more than three times greater inside
exclosures.
Total basal area was 40% higher inside than outside
exclosures in 2004 (in, 36.6 m2/ha; out, 26.0 m2/ha; t4 ¼
3.48; P ¼ 0.025). Trees were smaller inside exclosures
(Fig. 3A), but age distributions did not differ between
grazing treatments (Fig. 3B).
Overstory and grazing effects on understory vegetation
Total species density, herbaceous plant density, and
herbaceous cover variables were negatively correlated
with overstory vegetation in 1941 and 2004 (Table 3,
Fig. 4). Shrub cover was not correlated with overstory
vegetation in 1941 but slightly positively correlated with
it in 2004. Correlations with overstory vegetation were
stronger in 2004 than 1941 (Table 3, r values; Fig. 4, F
values), but predicted values of response variables were
smaller (Fig. 4, ﬁt lines).
Total species density and herbaceous plant density did
not differ between grazing treatments in 1941, but were
signiﬁcantly lower inside exclosures in 2004 (Figs. 5A, B
and 6A, B, solid symbols; Appendix C). After account-
ing for overstory effects, neither variable differed
between grazing treatments in either year (Fig. 6A, B,
open symbols).
Shrub cover was low and did not differ between
grazing treatments in either year (Figs. 5C and 6C). In
1941, graminoid cover was higher inside exclosures
(Figs. 5E and 6E), but total herbaceous cover and forb
cover did not differ between grazing treatments (Figs.
5D, F and 6D, F), even after accounting for overstory
effects. In 2004, all three herbaceous cover variables
were higher outside exclosures, though not after
accounting for overstory effects.
Temporal dynamics of understory vegetation
Species density declined by 34% between 1941 and
2004, but did not differ between years once overstory
effects were accounted for (Fig. 7A). Herbaceous plant
density declined more inside than outside exclosures
(61% vs. 13%; QB ¼ 5.19, P ¼ 0.023), but did not differ
between grazing treatments or years after accounting for
overstory effects (Fig. 7B).
Shrub cover declined by 69% between 1941 and 2004,
but increased after overstory effects were accounted for
(Fig. 7C). Herbaceous cover declined by 59% and forb
cover by 82% between 1941 and 2004, but did not differ
between years once overstory effects were accounted for
(Fig. 7D, F). Graminoid cover declined by 69% inside

however, graminoid cover did not differ between grazing
treatments or years (Fig. 7E).
DISCUSSION
Grazing effects on overstory vegetation
Although these forests are dominated by a single tree
species, the effects of livestock grazing on overstory
dynamics are more complex than previously suggested
(Belsky and Blumenthal 1997). In particular, historical
livestock grazing had long-term legacy effects on the
overstory: tree canopy cover and density were lower
where livestock grazing continued than where it ceased
in 1912. These effects were evident in 1941 and reported
in early research about ponderosa pine regeneration
(Westveld 1921, Pearson 1933, Arnold 1950), but were
much more apparent by 2004. Similar grazing effects on
woody plant density can be seen over larger areas of
northern Arizona by comparing Grand Canyon Na-
tional Park (GCNP) with surrounding lands. GCNP
was heavily grazed by sheep and cattle from the late
1800s until it was fenced to exclude livestock grazing in
the late 1930s. Contemporary tree densities are higher in
GCNP (Grandview site; 955 trees/ha  2.5 cm dbh) than
at an adjacent site that continued to be grazed (830
trees/ha  2.5 cm dbh, comprising 689 live trees/ha and
141 cut trees/ha; Fule´ et al. 2002). However, recon-
structed forest structure at the time of Euro-American
settlement did not differ between sites (Fule´ et al. 2002),
indicating that contemporary differences in stand
structure are due to subsequent land management
practices (see also Menzel 1996). Lower woody plant
densities have also been reported in other ecosystems in
areas where grazing continued than where it ceased
(Cheal 1993, Spooner et al. 2002, Mengistu et al. 2005;
cf. Riggs et al. 2000).
We attribute the observed differences in pine regen-
eration to livestock rather than wild ungulates (Riggs et
al. 2000) because wild ungulates had minimal effects in
northern Arizona forests in the early 1900s. Merriam’s
elk (Cervus elaphus merriami) was hunted to extinction
around 1900, and Rocky Mountain elk (C. elaphus
nelsoni) was introduced in small numbers in 1913

Notes: Grazing effects are reported based on the unadjusted
data (overall) and on the residuals after accounting for
overstory effects (Fig. 4). Data for the ﬁve sites are reported
in Appendix C. Negative correlations with overstory indicate a
decline in the response variable as the importance of the
overstory increases; negative correlations with grazing indicate
a response that was larger outside than inside exclosures.
Statistically signiﬁcant (P  0.05) correlation coefﬁcients are

(Hoffmeister 1986). Also, grazing reports from Coconi-
no National Forest indicate low populations of wild
ungulates and high populations of livestock, particularly
sheep during this period (e.g., Kneipp 1908).
There are several possible mechanisms by which
livestock affected pine regeneration. The relative
importance of these mechanisms is unclear, and
deserves further research. First, protection from live-

stock would have increased the survival and height
growth (Karl and Doescher 1998) of seedlings already
present when the exclosures were built in 1912. For
example, 57 young pine trees (;90 trees/ha) were
present inside the Big Fill exclosure in 1912; of these,
ﬁve had died by 1914 (Hill 1917) and ‘‘practically all’’
survived to 1921 (Hill 1921). In contrast, most young
pine trees outside the exclosure were dead by 1914 (Hill
1917) and only two remained alive in 1921 (Hill 1921).
Similarly, Pearson (1933) noted that regeneration in
1918 was ‘‘noticeably better’’ inside than outside other
exclosures in northern Arizona, ‘‘due more to the
growth of old seedlings than appearance of new ones’’
(Southwestern Forest and Range Experiment Station
1937:11). Second, germination and establishment may
have been enhanced within the exclosures. The

increased herbaceous vegetation within the exclosures
would have protected seedlings from frost-heaving
(Haasis 1923), although it would also compete for
water and nitrogen (Elliott and White 1987). Third,
seedling establishment outside exclosures may have
been reduced by livestock trampling and/or browsing.
Conifer seedlings are particularly susceptible to this
type of damage in the ﬁrst few years after germination

(Eissenstat et al. 1982, Jime´ nez et al. 2005), particularly
when subject to heavy grazing pressure (Pearson et al.
1971, Allen and Bartolome 1989). Early scientists in the
Southwest clearly felt this was an important mecha-
nism, and attributed lower regeneration densities
outside exclosures to damage by livestock, primarily
sheep (Hill 1917, Westveld 1921, Pearson 1933).
While our results demonstrate that historical live-
stock grazing was a key disturbance event inﬂuencing
overstory vegetation development on these sites, it was

not the only factor. Ponderosa pine regeneration
patterns in the Southwest are the result of interactions
between multiple factors, including historical livestock
grazing, ﬁre history, climatic conditions, and pine seed
production (Meagher 1950). If these factors had not
coincided, the results may have been very different
(Paine et al. 1998). Silvicultural practices can also
affect regeneration patterns by removing mature trees
that are seed sources while creating openings and
scariﬁed sites in which seedlings can establish (Schu-
bert 1974). Mean regeneration and mature tree
densities were positively correlated in 1941 (r2 ¼
0.483; P ¼ 0.0258; n ¼ 10 site 3 grazing treatment
combinations), suggesting that pine regeneration may
have been limited in part by seed production. However,
logging-related site scariﬁcation was not necessary for
seedling establishment: regeneration densities were
much higher at Reese Tank, which did not receive its
ﬁrst overstory harvest until 1940, than at the other
sites, which were selectively harvested before the
exclosures were built (Appendix B). Site disturbance
from logging is of secondary importance with respect
to pine regeneration compared to factors such as
climate and seed production (Meagher 1950).
Overstory and grazing effects on understory vegetation
Grazing exclosure studies (e.g., Potter and Krenetsky
1967, Zimmerman and Neuenschwander 1984, Rambo
and Faeth 1999) can provide insight into plant
communities following the cessation of grazing. In
forested ecosystems, it is essential that overstory–
understory relationships (e.g., Arnold 1950, Moore
and Deiter 1992, Nemati and Goetz 1995) be explicitly
accounted for when examining the factors controlling
understory vegetation. Other studies of grazing effects in
ponderosa pine forests have considered overstory effects
to be part of the variability between grazing treatments
(e.g., Potter and Krenetsky 1967), or intentionally
sampled non-treed openings (e.g., Rambo and Faeth
1999). However, failure to account for overstory effects
would have substantially altered our conclusions.
A few studies have assessed the relative importance of
overstory and other factors with respect to understory
vegetation. Livestock preferentially graze openings
rather than stands of dense timber, so vegetation
responses to grazing also differ between vegetation types
(Smith 1967). Logging can beneﬁt the understory by
reducing the tree canopy, unless too much logging slash
accumulates (Arnold 1953). Some studies have suggested
that cover of grazing sensitive grasses and overstory
abundance are positively correlated in grazed areas
because livestock are less likely to graze beneath the
overstory (Arnold 1950, McPherson and Wright 1990),
though there was no indication of a positive correlation
between overstory vegetation and graminoid cover in
this study. Correlations between overstory and under-
story variables were not as strong in this study as in
other studies (Clary 1969, Mitchell and Bartling 1991,
Moore and Deiter 1992, Nemati and Goetz 1995),
possibly due to differences in how variables were
measured.
The herbaceous plant basal cover measurements in
this study are within the range of values reported from
other studies using the line intercept method (Arnold
1953, Potter and Krenetsky 1967, Anderson and Inouye
2001, Rowlands and Brian 2001). Grazing effects were
smaller than overstory effects; graminoid cover was the
only variable that differed between grazing treatments
after accounting for overstory effects. The effects of
livestock grazing on herbaceous cover varied between
years. In 1941, grazing had no effect on total herbaceous
cover due to the counteracting responses of graminoids
and forbs as has been reported by others (Harris et al.
2003). In 2004, graminoids and forbs responded to
grazing in the same manner, and total herbaceous cover
tended to be higher in grazed areas. In comparison,
others have reported no difference between grazing
treatments (Stohlgren et al. 1999, Guenther et al. 2004)
or higher herbaceous cover in ungrazed areas (Rummell
1951, Schmutz et al. 1967, Smith 1967, Allen and
Bartolome 1989). Costello and Turner (1941) reported
that 15 of 22 sites in ponderosa pine forests had higher
plant cover in ungrazed areas. However, it is unknown
whether the overstory differed between grazing treat-
ments in many of these studies.
Total species density tended to be higher inside
exclosures in 1941 but did not differ between grazing
treatments in 2004. Other studies have reported no
difference in species richness between grazed and
ungrazed areas (Guenther et al. 2004) or lower richness
in ungrazed areas (Rambo and Faeth 1999, Stohlgren et
al. 1999). These comparisons are complicated, however,
by the fact that diversity is scale-dependent and because
the effects of grazing on diversity can vary with
environmental conditions (Harrison et al. 2003, Pyka¨ la¨
2004) and among years (Loeser et al. 2005).
Temporal dynamics of understory vegetation
Most understory variables exhibited similar temporal
dynamics in both grazing treatments, declining dramat-
ically between 1941 and 2004. The year 1941 was much
wetter than 2004, suggesting that climatic differences
could confound the interpretation of temporal changes
on these sites. However, plant cover and precipitation
may not be directly correlated due to interspeciﬁc
differences in response to precipitation and to stochastic
variation in precipitation patterns (Anderson and
Inouye 2001). Also, the trends exhibited in these data
are broadly similar to those recorded on permanent
chart quadrats measured a few years earlier (1938, 2002–
2003; J. D. Bakker and M. M. Moore, unpublished data).
Furthermore, most of the temporal dynamics on these
sites were explained by the increased dominance of the
overstory; variables did not differ between years once
differences in overstory abundance were accounted for.
Our results indicate that estimates of overstory abun-

dance must be included when modeling understory
variables at different points in time. Such information
can be obtained from permanent plots (Moore et al.
2004) or via reconstruction techniques (Bakker 2005).
CONCLUSIONS
This study demonstrates that historical livestock
grazing practices are an aspect of land-use history that
can affect ecosystem development. Because historical
livestock grazing practices can have signiﬁcant long-
term effects, grazing history must be considered when
extrapolating results from one site to another. Relict
sites that have never been grazed by livestock often
exhibit lower tree densities than nearby grazed areas
(Schmutz et al. 1967, Madany and West 1983; cf. Harris
et al. 2003, Guenther et al. 2004), but caution should be
used when interpreting results from these sites. Areas
that were historically grazed but later protected from
grazing (e.g., Moore et al. 2004) are more appropriate as
guides to potential vegetation development.
Our study provides the ﬁrst quantitative, long-term
analysis of factors controlling understory vegetation
structure in Southwestern ponderosa pine forests, and of
how this vegetation changed between 1941 and 2004.
Conditions in 1941 are obviously not ‘‘reference
conditions’’ or ‘‘presettlement’’ (Moore et al. 1999);
between 1912 and 1941, grass cover declined by 25%
beneath pine canopies, but almost doubled in open areas
(Arnold 1950). Nonetheless, changes between 1941 and
2004 provide insight into the trajectory of change that
has occurred in recent decades. The understory vegeta-
tion was more strongly controlled by the ponderosa pine
overstory than by recent livestock grazing or by
temporal dynamics, indicating that overstory effects
must be accounted for when examining understory
responses in this ecosystem.
