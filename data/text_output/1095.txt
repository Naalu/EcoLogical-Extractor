Appendix A. Property Value Changes in the Schultz Fire and Flood Footprint 
The original Schultz Fire full-cost accounting calculated personal losses in wealth due to reduced assessed 
property values in the amount of $59,353,523 (Combrink et al. 2013). There were no structures lost to the 2010 
Schultz Fire or flooding events. However, as noted in the original study (Combrink et al. 2013), there were 
significant damages to structures due to the post-fire flooding. Thus, we wanted to reexamine the changes in 
property values over the 10 years since the Schultz Fire to see how the area affected by the post-fire flooding 
changed over time.	
The 100-year flood footprint included 1,614 parcels and 1,497 structures with the average structure size being just 
under 1,800 square feet. All parcels had a combined assessed value of $528,960,705 in 2020. The average parcel 
size was 2.27 acres, with the largest parcel of 74 acres identified as agricultural land. A neighborhood-level analysis 
is provided below.
Property Value Changes in the Flood Footprint
We first wanted to examine how assessed values have changed over time since 2010 and as projected in the 
original study (Combrink et al. 2013). It is important to situate the study area trends within the rest of Coconino 
County, Arizona, and the US in general. It is also critical to note that the timing of the 2010 Schultz Fire 
coincided with national-level decreases in property values following the Great Recession of 2008 and the 
subprime mortgage crisis. 
Within the study area, parcel values were already dropping between 2009 and 2010, the period before the fire and 
the first flooding event. There was a relatively small drop of 3.3% in property values between the fire and flooding 
of 2010 and 2011 (Figure A1). In 2011, the second year after the fire, property values dropped an additional 24% 
to their lowest point. This drop coincided with the start of mitigation projects following the Schultz Fire flooding.
Property values started to climb between 2012 and 2013 despite a 2013 monsoon event, which affected the 
original flood area and the North Peak neighborhood. By 2013, most of the large mitigation projects were in 
process and flood mitigation abatement efforts were becoming evident. Eighty percent of total project costs ($24.8 
million) was expended between 2013 and 2020, growing in accordance with the overall rise in average property 
values. The sharpest increase in property values occurred between 2015 and 2019, where values increased 38% 
(Figures A1 and A2).
When the original Combrink et al. (2013) study was published, the property values in the area were only just 
beginning to recover. The same trends were also apparent in other areas around Flagstaff (Figure A14). By 2020, 
average property values in the study area had rebounded 51.5% from an average assessed value of $214,940 in 
2010 to $325,580 in 2020.

Values of Flood Damaged Properties 
In 2010, 44% of properties in the flood risk area received damage. As shown in Table A1, there was variability 
among neighborhoods with some experiencing no flood-related damages.

The County Assessor adjusted the value of parcels damaged in 2010 to account for losses due to flooding. 
The potential losses in property tax revenue for the county associated with devaluing properties damaged by 
the flooding were not calculated. The current increases in property values also result in increased property tax 
revenues. Overall, all damaged parcels had lower assessed full-cash values than did undamaged parcels, regardless 
of neighborhood. The largest differences between flood damaged and undamaged parcels are for Sunset Crater 
Estates, where undamaged properties had a 36.6% higher average assessed valuation than damaged properties. 
The next highest difference was found in the Copeland Road to Wupatki Estates neighborhood, where 
undamaged parcels had 30.9% higher average assessments than did damaged properties (Table A2).

When comparing the changes in average assessed values within damaged and undamaged properties, a different 
story emerges. Overall, damaged properties saw a 16.9% increase of value over the 2010 to 2020 time period, 
while undamaged properties grew at a rate of 12.5%. Overall, flood damaged properties increased in assessed value 
by 14.5% over the period, while undamaged properties grew in value at a slower rate of 5.9% (Figure A3). The 
mitigation measures completed in proximity to properties damaged by post-fire flooding may have contributed to 
this trend, but other factors such as the characteristics of the properties themselves, national level property value 
changes likely contributed to this trend, and readjustments done by the Assessor’s Office following the flooding.  
Figure A3. Percentage change comparison in average assessed value 2010 to 2020 by neighborhood.
When comparing only properties that received damage in 2010—excluding North Peak and East Koch Esplin 
neighborhoods, which were not affected in the 2010 flooding event—the 2010 averaged assessed value was 
$261,036, and the 2020 value was $305,256, which represents an increase of 16.9% over the whole area.  
Overall Changes in Assessed Values for Damaged Properties
This section focuses only on damaged properties that were directly affected by flooding in 2010. Total assessed 
property values, or the sum of all assessed values for damaged properties, were aggregated to the neighborhood

The difference in the total assessed value between the time of the Schultz Fire in 2010 and 2020 was determined 
for damaged parcels by neighborhood. 
In total, the properties damaged during the flooding events appreciated by $79.6 million. The largest increases 
occurred for the Campbell Avenue West to Tyson area ($20.4 million), followed by Campbell Avenue East to 
Copeland Lane ($15.2 million). Total assessed property values for damaged properties for each neighborhood by 
year can be found below.

Change in Property Value by Neighborhood
There is a wide variation in assessed property values between and within neighborhoods. Factors affecting 
property values include: size of property, size of structures on the property and other market factors such as 
location, viewsheds, and isolation. In 2010, on average, all properties in the western neighborhoods had 10.5% 
higher average values than properties in the eastern neighborhoods. By 2020, these differences were not as large 
with western neighborhoods being 9.7% higher on average than eastern neighborhoods.
Cumulative parcel values also differ between neighborhoods. Cumulative property values in 2010 for western 
neighborhoods were $181 million, while cumulative property values for eastern neighborhoods were $156 
million, a difference of 15.8%. In 2020, the western neighborhoods cumulative values had increased to $293 
million, resulting in a difference of 24% over the eastern neighborhoods, which are cumulatively valued at $236 
million. Cumulative values increased at the same rate between 2010 and 2020 for the neighborhoods. Western 
neighborhoods realized a 61.3% increase between 2010 and 2020, while eastern neighborhoods realized a 50.4% 
increase for the same period.
Overall, parcels in the Schultz fire and flood impact area saw an increase in cumulative value of 56.2% from 
$338 million in 2010 to $529 million in 2020. A total of 48 new parcels were added to the footprint. The new 
parcels were the result of lot splits. Tables A6 and A7 on the following pages outline the average property size by 
neighborhood, as well as the average parcel value and the cumulative parcel value for 2010 and 2020.

Neighborhood Example East Fernwood 
To examine how assessed values changed by neighborhood between 2010 and 2020, we examined changes 
between damaged and undamaged properties at the street level in the Fernwood-Silver Saddle and Campbell to 
Wupatki Trails neighborhoods. These two neighborhoods were chosen as they were west and east of Highway 89 
and had streets with both damaged and undamaged properties. 
Four streets from the Fernwood neighborhood that had both damaged and undamaged properties are compared. 
The streets are North Deer Lane, North Leisure Lane, North Lilac Lane and Soaring Eagle Drive. Fernwood 
saw an average 39.0% increase in assessed value between 2010 and 2020. In the case of Fernwood, values differ 
greatly between damaged and undamaged properties. Damaged properties appreciated from $174,986 in 2010 to 
$254,834 in 2020, an increase of 45.6% compared to undamaged properties that appreciated from $229,721 to 
$305,773, an increase of 33.1% over the same period. While damaged properties increased in valuation at a faster 
rate than undamaged properties, this overall effect is mitigated by the fact the damaged properties tended to have 
lower valuations (Table A9, Figure A4).

The greatest increase is assessed property value for damaged properties in the Fernwood neighborhood is an 
increase of 344% for damaged properties compared to 29% for undamaged properties on North Leisure Lane. The 
next highest appreciation was found in Soaring Eagle Drive, where damaged properties increased by 247% and 
undamaged properties increased 103%. On North Lilac Lane, damaged properties increased their values by 28% 
compared to undamaged properties, which increased at a higher rate of 55%. A similar pattern is found for East 
Deer where growth in value of damaged properties (14%) was outstripped by undamaged properties (32%). These 
differences are illustrated as Figures A5 through A8 below.

Neighborhood Example Copeland to Wupatki Trails
The Copeland neighborhood is used as an example of the differences that can be found between damaged and 
undamaged properties at the street level west of Highway 89. Four streets from the Copeland neighborhood that 
had both damaged and undamaged properties are compared. The streets are Zady Lane, Crisp Hill Circle, North 
Crestview Drive, and North Glodia Drive.  
The Copeland neighborhood saw an average 61% increase in assessed value between 2010 and 2020. In the case 
of the neighborhood, values differ greatly between damaged and undamaged properties.  Damaged properties 
appreciated from $190,103 in 2010 to $297,747 in 2020, an increase of 56.6% compared to undamaged properties 
that appreciated from $251,248 to $404,518, an increase of 61.0% over the same period. See Table A11 and

The greatest increase is assessed property value for damaged properties on Zady Lane with an increase of 30.5% 
for damaged properties compared to 4.4% for undamaged properties. The next highest change is a 18.6% increase 
for damaged properties compared to an 8.1% decrease for undamaged properties on Crisp Hill Drive. On North 
Glodia Drive, damaged properties increased their values by 7.3% compared to undamaged properties which 
decreased at a rate of 18.5%. North Crestview Street saw 11% growth for damaged properties compared to 2.3% 
for undamaged properties. These differences are illustrated as Figures A10 through A13 below.

Comparison of Schultz Fire and Flooding Areas to Greater Flagstaff Area 
To check the consistency of the results in the area affected by the Schultz Fire and post-fire flooding to the greater 
Flagstaff area, housing data for 2009–2020 was obtained from CoreLogic. Properties in Flagstaff area ZIP (zone 
improvement code) (86001) were selected and controlled for size using the average Schultz area property size (2.5 
acres), which resulted in 451 records that met the property size limits and average assessed property values were 
obtained for the same duration of the Schultz analysis. These “control” property values were then compared to the 
Schultz values. The Flagstaff control properties increased in value at a 21.7% rate when compared to the Schultz 
fire and flood properties of the same size, which increased at a 17.3% rate (Table A13). The Flagstaff control 
group increased in value at a faster rate than Schultz properties but had lower overall valuations (Figure A14).

Discussion and Conclusion 
Assessed property values for the study area grew by 45% over the past ten years since the 2010 Schultz Fire. 
Average values for the area dropped to their lowest point in 2012. Since mitigation projects began in 2012 and 
2013, values started to increase steadily, but these increases also coincided with trends in the greater Flagstaff area 
as the housing market recovered from the Great Recession of 2008. 
While property values in the entire study area grew, the rate of growth varies greatly by neighborhood and 
location. Flood damaged properties generally increased in assessed value at a faster rate (14.5%) than undamaged 
properties (5.9%). However, flood damaged properties tended to have lower assessed values across the area 
than undamaged properties. There is considerable variation in the growth in assessed value between damaged 
and undamaged properties at the neighborhood level. For example, in the Fernwood neighborhood damaged 
properties increased at a rate of 20.9% over the period while undamaged properties grew at a rate of 15.4%. In the 
Copeland neighborhood, damaged properties grew in value at a rate of 15.5%, while undamaged properties grew 
at a rate of 1.3% for the same period. 
Damaged properties across the study area saw an increase in value of $79.6 million between 2010 to 2020. 
The original Combrink et al. (2013) study documented a loss in property value of $59.4 million in 2013, but 
those losses may not have been a direct result of the fire and post-fire flooding as they coincided with similar 
trends throughout the greater Flagstaff area. Nonetheless, the timing of the Schultz Fire—when property 
values regionally and nationally were already decreasing—likely amplified the effects of the fire and flooding 
for households in the study area. Although we cannot attribute the increase in property values in the flood area 
directly to the flood mitigation measures implemented following the Schultz Fire, these projects contributed to 
the overall resiliency of the neighborhoods and have successfully redirected potential flood waters in extreme 
rainfall events.
