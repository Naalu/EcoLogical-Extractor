Abstract
Following severe wildﬁres in southwestern ponderosa pine forests, dead trees remain on the landscape and eventually fall, but relatively little is
known about the quantity and quality of post-wildﬁre coarse woody debris (CWD). To describe post-ﬁre conditions, we measured snags, CWD, and
ﬁne woody debris and forest ﬂoor depth on seven ﬁres in a chronosequence from 3 to 27 years old in northern Arizona. Snags declined in density
with increasing time since ﬁre and generally followed expected patterns of decay, except that few snags stood long enough to reach a clean-bark
state. The mean biomass of the surface CWD ranged from as low of 3.3 Mg ha1 to a high of 41.3 Mg ha1. Total CWD biomass in the surface fuel
load remained roughly comparable from 8–9-year-old ﬁres to a 27-year-old ﬁre but the state of the CWD changed from sound to rotten. The change
to a rotten condition suggests an increase in ignitability of the post-ﬁre fuel load, but ﬁne fuels that could support high ﬁreline intensity were
relatively low. The number of ‘‘jackstraws,’’ points where intersecting downed logs could create a hot spot if reburned, was slightly higher in the
oldest ﬁre. Few ﬁre-created snags remained by the 27th year post-ﬁre. Management options to reduce fuels after severe wildﬁre, such as salvage
logging, prescribed burning, or passive management, should be addressed in a broad ecological context.

1. Introduction
Following severe wildﬁres, dead trees remain on the
landscape and eventually fall. In some circumstances, the
accumulation of post-wildﬁre coarse woody debris (CWD) may
support relatively severe reburning. For example, after the
initial Tillamook ﬁre in 1933 burned 121,200 ha of Douglas-ﬁr
forest in Oregon, the same area burned again in 1939 and 1945
(Pyne, 1997). The reburns were difﬁcult to suppress, burning
two-thirds of the original acreage and destroying regeneration
that had established after the ﬁrst ﬁre (Kemp, 1967). More
recently, Odion et al. (2004), in mixed conifer forests of the
Klamath-Siskiyou Mountains of California, found that there
was three times more high severity ﬁre in reburn areas than
those that had not burned in at least 84 years.
Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson) forests in
the southwestern United States have undergone changes in
structure and function in the last 100 years, making them more
vulnerable to severe wildﬁre (Dahms and Geils, 1997).
Compared to historically open forest conditions, modern
forests have more young and small trees, and heavier fuel loads
(Cooper, 1960; Covington et al., 1994). Concurrent with this
change is the increase in the number and size of wildﬁres in the
western United States (Swetnam et al., 1999). Management
of post-wildﬁre fuel complexes, and concern over the prospect
of reburning, have thus increasingly come to the forefront of
southwestern
forest
management.
Post-ﬁre
management
is often contentious, especially when salvage harvesting is
suggested (McIver and Starr, 2001). Reasons given for salvage
logging include reduced erosion (McIver and Starr, 2001),
insect outbreak (Simon et al., 1994), and lower intensity and
severity of future ﬁres (USDA, 2004), though McIver and Starr
(2001) found little objective evidence that a reduction in ﬁre
intensity occurred after an area was salvage logged.
Our goal in the present study is to investigate post-ﬁre fuel
dynamics, the decay and fall of standing snags, and the
accumulation of fallen coarse woody debris on the surface,
in order to help inform decisions about post-ﬁre management,
especially with respect to potential future ﬁre behavior and
effects. Both standing and fallen dead wood can be referred to

as ‘‘CWD’’ (Brown et al., 2003); here we follow Stephens and
Moghaddas (2005) in using the term ‘‘snag’’ for standing dead
trees and ‘‘CWD’’ for downed logs >7.62 cm diameter.
A theoretical model of snag decomposition was developed by
Thomas et al. (1979), using external characteristics such as the
degree of retention of ﬁne twigs and bark, and bole breakage,
hypothesizing that snags would progress in a step-wise fashion
from one class to the next over time (Fig. 1). Kimmey (1955)
tracked Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi Grev. & Balf.) and
ponderosa pine, ﬁnding that decay reached the heartwood of
most trees within 3 years of death. In ﬁre-killed ponderosa pine
in Washington, trees with decay increased from 35% in year 2
to 100% by year 5, with volume loss reaching 76% by the ﬁfth
year (Hadﬁeld and Magelssen, 2000).
Ponderosa
snags,
especially
smaller
diameter
trees,
fall quickly. Chambers and Mast (2005) found that 41% of
ﬁre-killed trees fell by 7 years after ﬁre in northern Arizona.
Ten years after a ﬁre in Oregon, Dahms (1949) found that
slightly more than half of the dead P. ponderosa had fallen,
rising to 78% by 12 years post-ﬁre. Harrington (1996) reported
that 75% of prescribed ﬁre-killed ponderosa pine and Gambel
oak fell within 10 years of the ﬁre. Large snags stood longer in a
study by Everett et al. (1999), where 58% of (23 cm) diameter
at breast (dbh) ponderosa pine snags were still standing 66
years after a ﬁre, but 50% of the snags <23 cm dbh fell or broke
in the ﬁrst 7–12 years.
Post-wildﬁre fuel loads (Fig. 2) have rarely been reported in
the literature; we found only four peer-reviewed articles,
none of which were in pure ponderosa pine forests. In a
ponderosa–mixed conifer stand in northern Arizona 6 years
after a mixed severity ﬁre, Fule´ et al. (2004) reported a mean of
55.7 Mg ha1 of CWD. Five years after a severe wildﬁre in
Madrean oak–pine forest, CWD averaged only 1.2 Mg ha1
(Fule´ et al., 2000). Tinker and Knight (2000) reported a mean of
160 Mg ha1 of CWD in a lodgepole pine forest (Pinus
contorta Dougl. ex Loud) after a severe wildﬁre in Wyoming.
Pedlar et al. (2002) reported a mean of 342.6 m3 ha1 of CWD
1 year after a ﬁre in a mixed conifer/deciduous forest in
Ontario. We found only one estimate of post-wildﬁre fuel loads
in ponderosa pine: CWD biomass was projected to reach 107–
204 Mg ha1 after the Rodeo-Chediski ﬁre in Arizona, based
on a calculation of the biomass of ﬁre-killed standing trees that
were expected to fall (USDA, 2004).
To assess the dynamics of snags and down woody debris
after severe wildﬁre, we selected seven wildﬁres covering a
chronosequence from 3 to 27 years post-ﬁre in northern
Arizona to ask the following questions: (1) What are the rates
and characteristics of changes in snag populations following a
severe wildﬁre? (2) How do the post-wildﬁre fuel complexes of
standing and fallen woody debris change over time? (3) What
are the implications for management?
2. Methods

isons, ﬁreswerechosen ina relativelycompactgeographicalarea
in the Coconino National Forest around Flagstaff, AZ. Seven
high intensity wildﬁres, ranging from 3 to 27 years old, met the
following criteria: (1) no salvage logging or second ﬁre in the last
30 years; (2) burns were on non-cinder basaltic soils with slope
<45%; (3) minimum area of severe burning (>50% overstory
mortality) of 260 ha. There was a gap of 18 years with no ﬁres
because no areas that ﬁt the criteria exist for that time period, due
to widespread post-ﬁre salvage management until 1996.
Elevations of the ﬁre-burned areas ranged from approxi-
mately 2200 m to 2600 m. Roughly half of the mean annual
precipitation of 54 cm is in the form of snow with the rest
coming as rain during the summer monsoon season. For the
months of February and July the mean daily minimum and
maximum temperatures for 2004 were 10.5 8C and 6.1 8C and
5.8 8C and 28.9 8C, respectively (National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, Station 023160 [Flagstaff Pull-
iam
Airport],
http://cdoincdc.noaa.gov/ansum/ACS).
The
dominant tree species of the forest is ponderosa pine, but at
the higher elevations limber pine (Pinus ﬂexilus James) and
Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco) occur
sporadically. At the lower elevations, Rocky Mountain juniper
(Juniperus scopulorum Sarg.), and Gambel oak (Quercus
gambellii Nutt.) also occur sporadically.
2.2. Field sampling
We sampled 30 plots at each ﬁre. Each plot was 90 m2
(15 m  6 m) in size, 0.2 km apart from each other, and 0.5 km
from any roads. Six of the seven ﬁres were sampled on a grid
system with a random starting point. Plots on the Radio ﬁre
were also placed on a grid, but it was not continuous because
the burn had been partially salvaged, stopping where boulders
prevented the use of heavy equipment; we sampled the
unsalvaged areas. We made all ﬁeld measurements between
May and September 2004.
We measured forest ﬂoor depth, ﬁne woody debris
(<7.62 cm diameter), and CWD with 15-m long planar
transects (Brown, 1974). We inventoried ﬁne woody debris
in three size classes (0–0.64 cm, 0.65–2.54 cm, and 2.55–
7.62 cm diameter) (Brown, 1974). These size classes corre-
spond to 1-h, 10-h, and 100-h moisture timelag classes, while
CWD (logs > 7.62 cm diameter) corresponds to the 1000-h
timelag class (Fosberg, 1970). Sound and rotten rating
determination followed Maser et al.’s (1979) ﬁve class system,
where class 1 is a freshly fallen tree, class 3 is rotten on the
outside but solid in the core, and class 5 is almost totally
decomposed. We considered classes 1 and 2 to be ‘‘sound’’
wood and the remaining classes to be ‘‘rotten.’’ We took the 1 h
and 10 h fuel class measurements in the ﬁrst 1.8 m of the fuel
transect, the 100 h fuel class in the ﬁrst 3.1 m, and the 1000 h
fuel class along the entire 15 m length of the transect. We
measured duff and litter depth every 5 m. To capture the
complexity of the arrangement of intersecting or ‘‘jack-
strawed’’ logs, we measured the distance from the intersection
of the planar transect with each sampled log to the next log that
crossed the sampled log. We also noted the diameter and length
of every log that touched a tallied log. ‘Touched’ was deﬁned as
an intersection of the centerlines of each log.
We measured all living trees and snags on a 6 m  15 m belt
transect centered on the 15-m planar transect. We measured
species and height (m) on all living trees and snags taller than
breast height (1.37 m). Diameter at breast height (cm) was
measured on trees taller than 3 m. Regeneration trees (<1.37 m
tall) were tallied by species and height class. State of decay
from Thomas et al. (1979) was also recorded for all snags:
‘‘recent’’ (retaining bark and ﬁne twigs), ‘‘loose bark,’’ ‘‘clean’’
(bark mostly fallen off), ‘‘broken’’ at some point above breast
height, and ‘‘fallen’’ (broken below breast height).
We calculated ﬁne and coarse woody debris biomass using
equations from Brown (1974) with southwestern species-
speciﬁc coefﬁcients from Sackett (1980). Sample statistics
were determined (mean and standard error) but we did not test
for statistically signiﬁcant differences among sample means
because the seven ﬁres were unreplicated cases of severe
burning, rather than replicates from a randomly manipulated
population. Instead of assessing a null hypothesis of no
difference among snag densities and CWD loading, we
compared data from the chronosequence graphically and as
percentages to assess relative changes over time and compare
them with theoretical patterns of snag and CWD dynamics.
3. Results
3.1. Snag dynamics
Recent snag density (Fig. 3) declined rapidly from the most
recent ﬁres (3–4 years post-ﬁre) up to the middle ﬁres (8–9 year
post-ﬁre), similar to the theoretical curve illustrated in Fig. 1. In
the recent ﬁres, the mean density of recent snags was
270.4 ha1. Recent snags made up 37% of the total snag
population (Table 2). In the middle-aged ﬁres, the mean was

The decay classes are from Thomas et al. (1979).

32.1 snags ha1 or 10% of the snag population, all ponderosa
pine. The Bear Jaw ﬁre also had Douglas-ﬁr snags, averaging
25.9 ha1. The oldest ﬁre, the 27-year-old Radio ﬁre, appeared to
violate the theoretical expectation by having numerous recent
snags (Fig. 3), but these were small Gambel oak trees that had
established post-ﬁre and then died, averaging 188.9 ha1.
Loose bark snags were present in all ﬁres, tending to
decrease as time since ﬁre increased (Fig. 3; Table 2). Plots in
the most recent ﬁres had a mean of 296.3 loose bark snags ha1
(or 40.7% of the snag population) (all ponderosa pine), while
the middle ﬁres had a mean of 38.3 loose bark snags ha1 (or
11.9% of the snag population). Considering only ponderosa
pine in the middle ﬁres, the mean dropped to 29.6 ha1. The
1995 Bear Jaw ﬁre had also a mean of 3.7 limber pine and
Douglas-ﬁr snags ha1 and a mean of 18.5 Gambel oak
snags ha1. The 1977 Radio Fire had a mean of 3.7 Douglas-ﬁr
loose bark snags ha1 and a mean of 37.0 Gambel oak loose
bark snags ha1.
The category with the greatest contrast to the hypothetical
pattern of snag decomposition was the ‘‘clean’’ category. There

were no clean snags on the more recent ﬁres and none on two of
the three middle ﬁres (Fig. 3). There was a mean of 3.7 clean
aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) snags ha1 on the 1996
Hochderffer ﬁre. The 1977 Radio ﬁre had a mean of 3.7 clean
ponderosa pine snags ha1 and a mean of 96.3 clean oak
snags ha1 (Fig. 3).
Broken snag densities decreased with the time since ﬁre
(Fig. 3), in contrast to the expected pattern, although the degree
of decline was relatively less steep than for recent and loose
bark snags through the 8–9-year-old ﬁres. The more recent ﬁres
had a mean ha1 of 55.6% or 7.6% of the snag population, and
the middle ﬁres had a mean ha1 of 54.3% or 16.9% of the snag
population and the 27-year-old ﬁre had 22.2 broken snags ha1
or 5.3% of the snag population. Almost all were ponderosa
pine, but the 1995 Bear Jaw ﬁre had 11.1 Douglas-ﬁr broken
snags ha1 and the 1977 Radio ﬁre had 7.4 Gambel oak broken
snags ha1.
Fallen snags (broken below breast height) increased over
time until the oldest ﬁre, when the trend reversed (Fig. 3). The
more recent ﬁres had a mean of 106.2 fallen snags ha1 (14.6%
of the snag population) and the 8–9-year-old ﬁres had a mean of
195.1 fallen snags ha1 (60.8% of the snag population). Most
fallen snags were ponderosa pine; only the 1995 Bear Jaw ﬁre
had another species (Douglas-ﬁr). The 1977 Radio ﬁre had a
mean of 66.7 fallen snags ha1 of ponderosa pine, Douglas-ﬁr,
and Rocky Mountain juniper (15.9% of the snag population).
Despite our best effort to control for tree cutting, the density of
stumps per hectare varied from a mean of 3.7 stumps ha1 in
the 1997 Radio and 2000 Pipe ﬁres to 159.3 stumps ha1 in the
1995 Bear Jaw ﬁre.
3.2. Coarse woody debris
The mean total biomass of CWD per ﬁre ranged from
3.3 Mg ha1 in the 2000 Pumpkin ﬁre to 41.3 Mg ha1 in the
1977 Radio Fire. Sound CWD material was dominant until the
oldest ﬁre. The recent ﬁres (Leroux, Pumpkin, and Pipe)
averaged 7.7 Mg ha1 of sound CWD (72% of the total CWD),
and the middle ﬁres averaged 34.3 Mg ha1 sound CWD (96%
of the total CWD), peaking 8 years after ﬁre (Horseshoe/
Hochderffer) (Fig. 4). The rotten fuel biomass was highest in
the oldest ﬁre (35.8 Mg ha1 = 86% of the total CWD), but the
recent ﬁres had on average almost two times the rotten biomass
as the middle ﬁres (3.1 Mg ha1 versus 1.7 Mg ha1). Fine
woody debris patterns differed by timelag class. The 100 h fuels
were highest in the 8/9-year-old ﬁres (mean = 5.8 Mg ha1) as
were the 10 h fuels (mean = 1.8 Mg ha1) (Table 3). The mean
and maximum diameters (cm) of logs encountered on the fuel
transects showed no pattern with time since ﬁre (Table 4).
Characteristics of jackstrawed logs did not differ greatly
among ﬁres and showed little relationship to time since ﬁre.
The mean number of logs in a jackstraw was 2.6 in the recent
ﬁres, 2.3 in the middle ﬁres, and 3.5 in the 27th year since ﬁre.

The mean percent of fuel transects with no logs was highest in
the recent ﬁres (47%), lowest in middle ﬁres (12%), and 20% in
the oldest ﬁre. The mean distance to the ﬁrst contact was 0.7 m
in the recent ﬁres, 1.1 m in the middle ﬁres, and 1 m in the
oldest ﬁre.
Forest ﬂoor depth varied from site to site without a clear
relationship to time since ﬁre. There was a slight trend for
deeper litter over time as the recent ﬁres (Leroux, Pumpkin, and
Pipe) averaged 0.7 cm, the middle ﬁres averaged 1 cm, and the
oldest ﬁre (Radio) had a mean of 1.6 cm. Duff was deepest in
the oldest ﬁre (1.6 cm), but was higher in the recent ﬁres
(1.2 cm) than in 8-year-old ﬁres (mean 0.8 cm), not necessarily
showing a relationship with time (Fig. 5).
3.3. Living tree structure
Regeneration was variable, both in species and in number
(Table 5). The 27-year-old Radio ﬁre was dominated by oak
regeneration and the 9-year-old Bear Jaw ﬁre by aspen. The
other ﬁve ﬁres had only conifer regeneration or none at all (4-
year-old Pipe ﬁre).
Density of overstory trees (taller than 1.37 m) varied widely
from ﬁre to ﬁre (Table 5), but ponderosa pine density generally
declined with time since ﬁre. The most recent ﬁres had a mean
of 355 ponderosa pine ha1, which declined to a mean of 79
ponderosa pine ha1 in the 8- and 9-year-old ﬁres, and ﬁnally
reached a mean of 70.4 ponderosa pine ha1 in the 27-year-old
ﬁre. Our site selection criterion of >50% mortality was based
on a subjective assessment, since we did not have pre-ﬁre
density data, but only the Pumpkin ﬁre with approximately 700
living trees ha1 was an outlier, with a higher density of
surviving trees than snags. The Radio ﬁre (the oldest) had a
mean of 1644 trees ha1 (95% oak). The only other ﬁre to have
more than one species of tree was the Bear Jaw ﬁre, where 64%
of the established trees were ponderosa pine, 33% were aspen,
and 3% were Douglas-ﬁr. Average diameters of living conifers
(Table 5) ranged from 20 cm to 25.5 cm on the six more recent
ﬁres, dropping as low as 12.8 cm on the Radio ﬁre.
4. Discussion
The chronosequence of seven wildﬁres was characterized by
relatively rapid snag fall and relatively light CWD loads,
though the data are limited in several ways. We attempted to
minimize variability in soils, slopes, and geographical region,
but were constrained by the small number of unsalvaged severe
wildﬁres available for study. The seven ﬁres probably differed
in site characteristics, pre-ﬁre management history, and post-
ﬁre inﬂuences of factors such as pathogens, weather events,
recreational use, and ﬁrewood cutting. Unfortunately no
detailed pre-ﬁre data were available. The possibly unique
characteristics of any of the seven cases of severe wildﬁre
studied here should be borne in mind when interpreting the
results.
The recent ﬁres were essentially dominated by two kinds of
snags: recent or loose bark. By the eighth year after ﬁre, most of
those snags had fallen either partially or completely. The high
rate of snag fall after 5 years is consistent with what others
have found (Keen, 1929; Harrington, 1996; Everett et al., 1999;
Chambers and Mast, 2005). The rapid snag fall is illustrated by
the increase from an average of 7.6% and 14.6% of the snag
population as broken or fallen, respectively, in the recent ﬁres to
16.9% and 60.8% of the snag population as broken or fallen in
the middle ﬁres (Table 2).
It appeared that the process of changing from vertical to
horizontal fuel was not necessarily one in which most snags
pass through every state possible from recent to broken to

fallen. Snags can break in any spot along the bole and at any
state of bark retention or wood decay, as noted by Everett et al.
(1999) and Hadﬁeld and Magelssen (2000), rather than
following the hypothetical step-wise process from one category
of snag to another as presented in Fig. 1. We found no clean
bark snags in early ﬁres and no ponderosa pine clean bark snags
in the middle and oldest ﬁre. More clean snags might have been
found if a number of large, old trees were burned in a ﬁre,
because old trees have substantial heartwood. The average dbh
of surviving trees in the seven ﬁres studied ranged from
approximately 13 cm to 26 cm, indicating that these stands
consisted of young, second-growth trees with little or no
heartwood.
Coarse woody debris reached its highest level after the
middle ﬁres, when most of the snags had fallen. The 27-year-
old ﬁre had a similar total CWD loading. This did not match the
model proposed by Harmon et al. (1986) because they
hypothesized a post-disturbance spike in CWD that gradually
declines over time (Fig. 2), while our data suggest a relatively
persistent plateau in the amount of CWD, at least over 27 years.
In the ﬁrst 8 or 9 years since ﬁre, CWD was sound wood with a
modal score of 2 on the log decay scale (Maser et al., 1979). But
in the 27 year post-ﬁre site, the modal score had increased to 4.
This change of state from sound to rotten represents an increase
in ﬁre hazard due to the greater ignitability and persistence of
smoldering of rotten wood (Brown et al., 2003). No clear
pattern emerged related to jackstrawing, but the oldest ﬁre
results indicate that many jackstraws still exist on the landscape
even after more than one-quarter of a century.
Coniferous regeneration and the densities of trees taller than
1.37 m varied widely from ﬁre to ﬁre. Post-ﬁre regeneration
patterns reported at several locations across the southwest by
Barton (2002) and Savage and Mast (2005) also showed
differential patterns. Several decades after severe wildﬁres,
landscapes in some cases reverted to ponderosa pine forest
cover, but a substantial proportion of the ﬁres studied by Savage
and Mast (2005) remained in stable grass- or shrub-dominated
ecosystems decades after burning. Barton (2002) argued that
high oak regeneration and minimal pine regeneration following
wildﬁre in Madrean pine–oak forests indicated a transformation
to long-term oak dominance. There is no clear evidence from
our limited sample of ﬁres that the post-ﬁre snag densities or
CWD loadings are related to which successional pattern may be
followed over time. The extent to which conifers survive as
seed trees, occurrence of favorable moisture conditions for
regeneration (Swetnam et al., 1999), and the presence of
sprouting species (oak and aspen) may be the most important
factors in guiding post-ﬁre succession.
4.1. Management implications
The paradox of post-wildﬁre fuels data is that while we can
measure the biomass, variability, and arrangement of snags and
CWD with high precision, it is not a simple matter to draw
concrete implications for future ﬁre behavior and effects.
Contemporary ﬁre behavior models commonly used in the
United States such as Behave (Andrews, 1986), Farsite (Finney,

1998), and Nexus (Scott and Reinhardt, 2001) are based on
Rothermel’s (1972) surface ﬁre behavior model, which is
primarily inﬂuenced by ﬁne fuels (<7.6 cm diameter). Even
though it would be possible to create custom fuel models with
the data we collected, there are two problems: ﬁrst, custom fuel
models require extensive testing for stable results (Andrews,
1986); second, since the surface ﬁre behavior model is
primarily sensitive to ﬁne fuels, even accurate custom fuel
models would not reﬂect differences in CWD biomass. Fine
fuels such as seeded grasses (e.g., Barclay et al., 2004) would
have a bigger impact than CWD on predicted ﬁre behavior.
Rather than modeling, we compared post-wildﬁre CWD
data with the loadings reported in standard ﬁre behavior models
and other CWD resource guidelines. Post-ﬁre fuels are
conceptually most similar to slash fuel models, numbers 11–
13 in Anderson (1982), because these fuel models are designed
for situations in which ﬁre spreads through light to heavy loads
of downed woody debris. However, the total ﬁne woody debris
in the post-ﬁre sites ranged from 2.7 Mg ha1 to 10.0 Mg ha1,
well below the range of 25.8–130.1 Mg ha1 in the slash fuel
models (Anderson, 1982). The complexity of fuel modeling
means that there is not a monotonic relationship between ﬁne
fuel load and ﬁre behavior variables such as ﬂame length or
heat/area. But the lower values at the seven wildﬁre sites imply
that surface ﬁre behavior at these sites would likely be
substantially less intense than even that of a light logging slash
fuel model.
Soil heating could serve as a criterion for evaluating future
ﬁre effects, using the heat of combustion for forest fuel
(approximately 18,620 kJ/kg) (Pyne et al., 1996) and multi-
plying it by a range of values between 50% and 95% (as no
wildland fuel
burns completely). Using
an average of
37.3 Mg ha1 (approximate total sound + rotten CWD in 8–
27-year-old ﬁres), total heat release could range from
3.5  105 MJ ha1 to 6.6  105 MJ ha1. Based on assess-
ments of heat transfer under slash piles, approximately 10–15%
(DeBano et al., 1998) of this energy would be directed
downward into the soil. However, the ecological effects in
terms of subsurface temperatures would vary depending on the
capability of the soil to transmit heat, soil moisture content,
location of heat-susceptible propagules, etc.
Fire suppression complexity is a management-oriented
criterion, since heavy downed fuels could slow ﬁreline
construction. Depending upon their experience and physical
condition, a 20-person crew can cut, backﬁre, and hold a ﬁreline
at rate of 181–301 m/h in light slash, model 11 (USDA, 1998).
A bulldozer, however, can cut ﬁreline from 140 m/h to 1037 m/
h, depending upon the terrain and operator experience (USDA,
1998). In the post-ﬁre sites we studied, the relatively low CWD
loads as compared to fuel model 11 indicate relatively less
resistance to control and mechanical equipment would likely be
used in the event of a large, spreading ﬁre in these sites because
they are relatively ﬂat and accessible.
Historical precedents where reburns have occurred could
shed light on what might happen to the ﬁres examined in this
study. However, while there are anecdotal accounts of severe
reburns in post-wildﬁre fuels (USDA, 2004), the only well
documented occurrences of wildﬁre severity being affected by
the fuels that remained after previous ﬁre are from forests that
are more productive than those of the southwest (Odion et al.,
2004). Historical reburn effects in southwestern forests merit
additional study.
Recommendations for optimal ranges of CWD in ponderosa
pine forests have been developed by Graham et al. (1994) and
Brown et al. (2003). To maintain long-term forest productivity,
Graham et al. (1994) recommended that between 15 Mg ha1
and 29.5 Mg ha1 of CWD be maintained in ponderosa pine/
Arizona fescue stands and that between 11 Mg ha1 and
23 Mg ha1 be maintained in ponderosa pine/Gambel oak
stands in Arizona. Brown et al. (2003) assessed a variety of
factors, including CWD beneﬁts for wildlife habitat and
productivity, balanced against potentially negative effects of
soil heating and ﬁre hazard. They set the optimal level for
balancing
these
concerns
between
11.2 Mg ha1
and
44.8 Mg ha1 of CWD in warm, dry forest (Brown et al.,
2003). As illustrated in Fig. 6, we found a wide range of CWD
loading, from 3.3 Mg ha1 to 41.3 Mg ha1, in the seven ﬁres
we studied. The lowest values, in the youngest ﬁres, are below
both the minima of both of the recommendations. However, as
material accumulated by the eighth or ninth year post-ﬁre,
CWD levels rose to within the optimal ranges but never
exceeded the maximum value proposed by Brown et al. (2003)
(Fig. 6).
Recognizing the limited sample size and constrained
inference of this study, and the fact that management actions
must be site- and goal-speciﬁc, we consider three options for
management when dealing with post-wildﬁre landscapes
forests similar to those we studied: salvage logging, prescribed
burning, and passive management. Salvage logging has been
suggested to be beneﬁcial in three ways: removal of CWD
could lessen wildﬁre effects (USDA, 2004), insect population
growth (Simon et al., 1994), and soil erosion (Poff, 1989). But
salvage logging may be detrimental to soil (Klock, 1975; Potts
et al., 1985; Maser, 1996; Beschta et al., 2004), wildlife (Saab
and Dudley, 1998), and vegetation (Roy, 1956; Sexton, 1998;
Martinez-Sa´nchez et al., 1999). Since the fuel loads found in

Fig. 6. CWD loadings from the seven wildﬁre study sites in the Coconino
National Forest, AZ (solid vertical lines), compared with the ‘‘optimum ranges’’
of CWD for warm dry forest types from Brown et al. (2003). The optimal range
that seemed suitable for multiple resource considerations (dashed vertical lines)
was delineated by Brown et al. (2003). Values presented by Brown et al. (2003)
were for downed CWD except in the wildlife category, which included snags.

our study fell within the ranges that are recommended as being
both beneﬁcial to the ecology of the site and not a wildﬁre
threat, salvage logging based on future ﬁre hazard does not
seem appropriate for these sites.
In situations where post-ﬁre fuels may be seen as excessive,
prescribed burning is an alternative way to lower fuel load
while retaining CWD beneﬁts (Brown et al., 2003). By
controlling burning conditions, managers can manipulate to
some extent the heat produced by burning CWD (controlling
damage to plants and soils) and how much of it is consumed
(preserving the animal habitat and erosion control beneﬁts),
while lowering the near-term ﬁre hazard by reducing the ﬁne
fuel. Negative impacts include the possibility of ﬁres escaping
control, smoke, ﬁres producing more heat than anticipated
leading to soil damage, and excessive consumption of CWD.
Passive management may be appropriate where managers
believe that the fuel complex of snags and CWD does not
exceed thresholds such as those suggested by Brown et al.
(2003) and where salvage actions are not indicated for other
reasons (public safety, insect infestation, and economic issues).
While inferences based on the ﬁre chronosequence studied here
are limited, there is no evidence that continued passive
management of these sites would have negative effects. Under
any of these management options, it is important to recognize
that regeneration of post-crownﬁre landscapes in the southwest
is uncertain, with some post-ﬁre landscapes transitioning to
shrubﬁelds or grasslands for at least several decades (Savage
and Mast, 2005). Active revegetation with native plants may be
productive.
