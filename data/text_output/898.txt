Contemporary wildﬁres in southwestern US ponderosa pine forests can leave uncharacteristically large patches
of tree mortality, raising concerns about the lack of seed-producing trees, which can prevent or signiﬁcantly
delay ponderosa pine regeneration. We established 4-ha plots in high-severity burn patches in two Arizona
wildﬁres, the 2000 Pumpkin and 2002 Rodeo-Chediski Fires, to determine if: (1) distance from forest edge
inﬂuences the density and spatial patterns of regenerating ponderosa pine and sprouting tree species, (2) in-
teractions with re-sprouting trees aﬀect spatial patterns of ponderosa pine regeneration, and (3) distance from
forest edge and species competition aﬀect regenerating ponderosa pine height. Plots were located in high-se-
verity burn patches (deﬁned as 100% tree mortality) and either adjacent to residual live forest edges (edge
plots), or > 200 m from any residual live trees (interior plots). We found higher ponderosa pine regeneration
densities in the edge plots (13–154 (median = 69) stems ha−1) than the interior plots (12–124 (median = 29)
stems ha−1) on both wildﬁres, but no diﬀerences in spatial patterns between edge and interior plots. Ponderosa
pine regeneration displayed patterns of small-scale spatial aggregation in all plots, except one edge and one
interior plot on the Pumpkin Fire, which displayed random distributions. These patterns suggest both short- and
long-distance dispersal play important roles in ponderosa pine regeneration in high-severity burn patches.
Sprouting trees dominated tree regeneration on the Rodeo-Chediski Fire, but they were spatially independent of
ponderosa pine and did not inﬂuence ponderosa pine height. Regenerating ponderosa pine height was positively
correlated with neighboring ponderosa pine densities and height, suggesting that intraspeciﬁc facilitation or
similar habitat preferences occur in high-severity burn patches. Collectively, these results indicate that pon-
derosa pines are re-establishing with heterogeneous spatial patterns in large high-severity burn patches, but
often with low densities. Also, ponderosa pine regeneration could be more strongly inﬂuenced by intraspeciﬁc
facilitation than interspeciﬁc competition from dense sprouting species. Future forest spatial patterns and
composition are still unclear, but at this stage of development, these heterogeneous patches, characterized by
drought-tolerant sprouting species or low pine densities, could be more resilient to climate change and severe
wildﬁres than the overly-dense ponderosa pine forests that were present before the wildﬁres.
1. Introduction
Over the past three decades, wildﬁres in southwestern US ponderosa
pine (Pinus ponderosa Lawson & C. Lawson) forests have increased in
size and severity, leaving large, contiguous patches of tree mortality
(often ≥100 ha) (Dillon et al., 2011; Poling, 2016). Increases in ﬁre
size and severity are attributed to the accumulation of abnormally high
canopy and surface fuel loads from over 100 years of ﬁre exclusion
(Fulé et al., 1997, 2009; Moore et al., 2004), warmer and drier climate
conditions, and longer ﬁre seasons (Dillon et al., 2011; Jolly et al.,
2015; Reilly et al., 2017). High-severity wildﬁres are in stark contrast to
the low- to moderate-severity wildﬁres that dominated the historical
ﬁre regime in ponderosa pine forests (Covington and Moore, 1994; Fulé
et al., 1997; Moore et al., 2004). Consequently, there is concern for the
future sustainability of ponderosa pine forests in large burn patches that
kill seed-producing trees, which can prevent or signiﬁcantly delay post-

ﬁre pine regeneration (Stephens et al., 2013).
Because ponderosa pines evolved under ﬁre regimes dominated by
low- to moderate-severity wildﬁres, they are poorly adapted to re-
generate in large patches of high-severity ﬁre (He et al., 2012). Pon-
derosa pines do not sprout or have serotinous cones, and do not
maintain long-lived soil seedbanks; therefore regeneration is dispersal-
limited in large patches of high-severity ﬁre and is dependent on sur-
viving seed-sources or residual live trees (Oliver and Ryker, 1990;
Chambers et al., 2016; Kemp et al., 2016). Ponderosa pine seeds are
morphologically adapted for wind dispersal but their relatively large
seeds rarely travel farther than 30 m from seed sources (Oliver and
Ryker, 1990), which limits regeneration in the center of large, high-
severity burn patches, often > 200 m from seed sources (Chambers
et al., 2016). Ponderosa pine seed can also be animal dispersed, and
long-distance dispersal by birds may be important for regeneration in
the interiors of high-severity burn patches (Li and Wilson, 1998; Lesser
and Jackson, 2013; Pesendorfer et al., 2016). However, poor ponderosa
pine seed crops, seed predation, and drought can all limit tree re-
generation (Pearson, 1950; Larson and Schubert, 1970).
Consistent with the above limitations, a body of research docu-
mented low ponderosa pine regeneration densities in large high-se-
verity burn patches (Lentile et al., 2005; Savage and Mast, 2005;
Roccaforte et al., 2012; Savage et al., 2013), and declining regeneration
with increasing distance from residual live trees (Haire and McGarigal,
2010; Chambers et al., 2016; Rother and Veblen, 2016). For example,
regeneration in Arizona and New Mexico ranged from 11 to 26 stems
ha−1 > 200 m from forest edges in large patches of high-severity ﬁre
(Haire and McGarigal, 2010). The strongest predictor of conifer re-
generation in high-severity burn patches in the Colorado Front Range
was distance from surviving forest, but regeneration also declined with
elevation and on more xeric sites (Chambers et al., 2016; Rother and
Veblen, 2016). Less is known about how the spatial arrangement of
regenerating ponderosa pines in large high-severity burn patches will
diﬀer near forest edges compared to the interior of burn patches (e.g. if
there are aggregated, random or uniform spatial arrangements). Re-
generation spatial patterns should be considered when planning re-
storation treatments, or to better predict the spatial structure of forest
development (Larson and Churchill, 2012; Donato et al., 2012). Pon-
derosa pine regeneration could be aggregated near the edges of high-
severity burn patches due to a clustering of dense pine seeds that fall
relatively close to parent trees, better growing conditions, or from ro-
dent seed caches (Oliver and Ryker, 1990; Li and Wilson, 1998; Vander
Wall, 2003). Regeneration spatial patterns could also be inﬂuenced by
competition with sprouting trees to capture new post-ﬁre growing
spaces (Fulé and Covington, 1998).
A potential trajectory in large high-severity burn patches in pon-
derosa pine-dominated forests is a dominance by sprouting tree species
(Fulé and Covington, 1998; Barton, 2005; Savage and Mast, 2005;
Strom and Fulé, 2007; Coppoletta et al., 2016). Following high-severity
ﬁres, sprouting species have regeneration strategies that allow them to
quickly recover (Bond and Midgley, 2001; Keeley et al., 2011). High-
severity burn patches could potentially exclude tree species establishing
from seed and favor a dominance of sprouting species for decades to
centuries after high-severity ﬁres (Iniguez et al., 2009). This pattern has
been observed in some southwestern ponderosa pine forests (Savage
and Mast, 2005; Strom and Fulé, 2007) and in forests that are tax-
onomically related to ponderosa pine with similar adaptations to fre-
quent ﬁre (P. arizonica, P. durangensis, P. engelmannii and P. nigra)
(McCune, 1988; Fulé and Covington, 1998; Martín-Alcón and Coll,
2016). However, it is unclear whether or not regenerating ponderosa
pines in large, high-severity burn patches will exhibit random associa-
tions, attraction (implying facilitation or similar habitat preferences) or
repulsion (implying a negative interaction like competition, or diﬀerent
habitat preferences) with sprouting tree species (Luo et al., 2012).
Competition with other species and proximity to forest edges can
also aﬀect regenerating ponderosa pine height (Li and Wilson, 1998;
Comeau et al., 1993; Nelson and Bragg, 2016), which could play an
important role in site dominance and survival after subsequent ﬁres
(Bailey and Covington, 2002; Battaglia et al., 2009; Schwinning and
Kelly, 2013). Variation in regeneration height across recovering high-
severity burn patches could be driven by variability in seedling age, or
proximity to forest edges and/or competition with sprouting species.
Hypothetically, regenerating ponderosa pines may grow faster and es-
tablish sooner near unburned forest edges than the far interior of burn
patches because of protection from wind and shade (Oliver and Ryker,
1990; Li and Wilson, 1998), available microbial symbionts (Nara, 2006;
Teste et al., 2009), and nearby seed sources (Bonnet et al., 2005). Post-
wildﬁre tree regeneration height can also be driven by competition for
light, water and nutrients with other regenerating species (Comeau
et al., 1993; Schwinning and Kelly, 2013).
The goal of this study was to better understand spatial patterns of
ponderosa pine regeneration, as well as interactions with sprouting
species and regeneration height in contiguous, high-severity burn pat-
ches. In order to develop spatially explicit data on post-wildﬁre tree
regeneration, we selected high severity burn patches in two wildﬁres
(the 2000 Pumpkin and 2002 Rodeo-Chediski Fires) and recorded the
spatial location of regenerating trees in 4-ha plots located either ad-
jacent to the forest edge (edge plots) or > 200 m from residual live
trees (interior plots). We tested the following hypotheses: H1: Higher
ponderosa pine regeneration densities and aggregated spatial patterns
will be found near forest edges; whereas lower densities and random
spatial patterns will be found farther from residual live trees; H2:
Ponderosa pine and sprouting species will display a spatial pattern of
repulsion; and H3: Height of ponderosa pine regeneration will be
greater near residual live trees and with less inter- and intra-speciﬁc
competition.
2. Methods
2.1. Study sites and plots
We investigated the patterns of ponderosa pine regeneration in large
high-severity burn patches in two large Arizona wildﬁres: the 2000
Pumpkin and 2002 Rodeo-Chediski Fires (Fig. 1). These ﬁres were
chosen from all 10 to 15 year old Arizona wildﬁres because they had
extensive patches of high-severity ﬁre (we deﬁne high-severity as 100%
tree mortality) with no post-ﬁre logging, planting, or subsequent ﬁres.
We collected data in 2013 on the Pumpkin Fire (13 years post-ﬁre) and
in 2014 and 2015 (12–13 years post-ﬁre) on the Rodeo-Chediski Fire.
The
Pumpkin
Fire
burned
approximately
6500 ha,
including
1400 ha of high-severity burned area, on the Kaibab and Coconino
National Forests (http://www.mtbs.gov/). The average 15 year post-
ﬁre annual precipitation was 57.7 cm and the average temperature was
7.2 °C (Prism Climate Group: http://prism.oregonstate.edu/). The ele-
vation ranged from 2350 to 2600 m on our plots. The soils are derived
from basalt and study plots are located on soil conditions ranging from
moderately deep cobbly clay loam to shallow gravelly sandy loam (Web
Soil Survey: http://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov. Accessed 10/5/16).
The Rodeo-Chediski Fire burned 189,651 ha, including 68,409 ha of
high-severity burn area, on the White Mountain Apache lands and the
Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest (http://www.mtbs.gov/). Our plots
were on the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, from 2000 to 2350 m
elevation. The average 12-year post-ﬁre annual precipitation was
54.5 cm and the average yearly temperature was 10.7 °C (Prism Climate
Group: http://prism.oregonstate.edu/). The soils are derived from
sandstone and limestone and are deeper than those at the Pumpkin Fire.
The pre-ﬁre vegetation was dominated by ponderosa pine on both
ﬁres, as evidenced by extensive ponderosa pine snags and downed logs
burned in the severely-burned areas of the ﬁre, nearby unburned pon-
derosa pine forest, and dendrochronological reconstructions of forest
structure in 1879 near both wildﬁres (Rodman et al., 2016, 2017).
Other common species included grasses such as Arizona fescue (Festuca

arizonica Vasey) and mountain muhly (Muhlenbergia montana (Nutt.)
Hitchc.), forbs, and shrubs such as Fendler's ceanothus (Ceanothus fen-
dleri A.) on the Pumpkin Fire, and Fendler's ceanothus, Gambel oak
(Quercus gambelii Nutt.) and alligator juniper (Juniperus deppeana
Steud.), on the Rodeo-Chediski Fire.
We used Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS, 2014) maps
with ﬁeld validation to identify all high-severity burn patches > 10 ha
in the Pumpkin and Rodeo-Chediski Fires. We used ArcGIS 10.1 (ESRI,
2012) to randomly select three high-severity burn patches per wildﬁre,
within which we established one 4-ha (200 × 200 m) “edge” plot and
one 4-ha “interior” plot, for a total of six 4-ha plots per wildﬁre. Edge
plots were established in high-severity burn patches adjacent to re-
sidual live trees, and interior plots were established where no surviving
trees were found within at least 200 m from the plot boundaries
(Fig. 1). From observation, most residual tree edges had high densities,
e.g., 250–1000 trees/ha with very little understory vegetation. Plots
were at least 30 m away from any roads and from another plot. Edge
plot perimeters ranged from 2 to 220 m from residual live trees, and
interior plot perimeters ranging from 203 to 455 m from residual live
trees. This design allowed us to measure large areas, but does not
capture regeneration in between plots, and the partial overlap of dis-
tance from residual live trees may limit a true separation between plot
types.
2.2. Determining regeneration density and spatial patterns
To test the hypothesis that ponderosa pine regeneration densities
and aggregation will be higher in edge than interior plots, we recorded
the spatial location of all regenerating trees (≥10 cm in height). We
established
reference
points
with
a
GPS
(Trimble
GeoXH
with
Terrasync, accurate to ± 20 cm) within each plot and used a range-
ﬁnder (Laser Technologies Inc. TruePulse 360-B, accurate to ± 38 cm
distance and ± 1° azimuth) to mark the geographic location of re-
generating trees from each reference point. We veriﬁed that regenera-
tion establishment dates were post-ﬁre by whorl-counting and de-
termining pith age on a subset of 46 regenerating ponderosa pines from
both wildﬁres. Regenerating ponderosa pines were from multiple co-
horts ranging from 2 to 9 years post-ﬁre on the Pumpkin Fire and
5–13 years post-ﬁre on the Rodeo-Chediski Fire. The two wildﬁres were
treated as separate case-studies because of diﬀerences in soil types and
pre-ﬁre understory vegetation, and because post-ﬁre regeneration in
the Rodeo-Chediski Fire was dominated by sprouting species.
We tested for diﬀerences in ponderosa pine regeneration density
between edge and interior plots on each ﬁre with a measure of “in-
tensity” that accounts for spatially explicit patterns, using mppm
(model ﬁtted to multiple point patterns) with the spatstat package in R
v.3.4.1 (R development Core Team, 2016), as described by Baddeley
et al. (2015). Intensity is measured as stems per m2 and can vary across
each plot with a inhomogeneous process; therefore density is intensity
integrated over a larger area. We assumed a Poisson spatial point

distribution because we were interested in evaluating overall location-
dependent density for this analysis and not patterns of inhomogeneity
within plots. We considered the three plots within each edge or interior
location as replicates. The model results were interpreted similarly to a
typical Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) that evaluates the null hypoth-
esis that the treatment level eﬀects of location are simultaneously zero
by generating t-statistics and associated p-values (Bell and Grunwald,
2004). Juniper species on the Pumpkin Fire were excluded from this
model because some plots did not contain juniper regeneration. We also
tested for diﬀerences in stem density in each individual plot with dis-
tance from forest edge by using a Thomas process (kppm: cluster pro-
cess model) model that evaluates Poisson-distributed parent clusters
with oﬀspring distributed as bivariate normal (Baddeley et al., 2015).
The null hypothesis tests the conditional slope being equal to zero
where the response is the log-intensity, and signiﬁcance is determined
by a Z-statistic and associated p-value (Baddeley et al., 2015). For these
plot-level assessments, we accounted for other covariates such as Beer’s
aspect (Beers et al., 1966), elevation, percent slope, and topographic
position index (TPI) (Jenness, 2006), each measured at 10-m resolution.
We did not ﬁnd any consistent patterns for these covariates across edge
and interior plots on either ﬁre.
To compare regeneration spatial patterns between edge and interior
plots, we used the spatstat package (Baddeley et al., 2015) in R v.3.4.1.
We ﬁrst used a Monte Carlo method to test the hypothesis that the
points exhibited Complete Spatial Randomness (CSR) on each plot. We
used the inhomogeneous Ripley’s K(r) function (Baddeley et al., 2015)
for all plots, unless they exhibited homogeneous patterns within the
plot, where we used the traditional form of the Ripley’s K(r) function
(Ripley, 1976, 1977, 1979). To determine whether regeneration was
distributed in a uniform, random or aggregated fashion, we used Ri-
pley’s K(r) function or the inhomogeneous Ripley’s K(r) function for all
plots. These tests compare the distances of all pairs of points, the null
hypothesis being that all points are randomly distributed (Ripley,
1976). The variance was stabilized to simplify visual interpretations by
using the L(r)-r transformation (Besag, 1977). Interpretation of point
pattern analysis results were limited to lag distances of 0–100 m (half
the shortest plot dimension; sensu Dixon, 2002) to minimize the inﬂu-
ence of unobserved points near observed points close to the plot edge
(Boots and Getis, 1988). Signiﬁcant aggregation or uniformity was
determined by comparing observed L(r)-r transformation values to a
95% conﬁdence envelope based on 999 permutations of simulated
complete spatial randomness (Upton and Fingleton, 1985). We quan-
tiﬁed patch sizes from the lag distance and value of L(r) at the highest
point of separation from CSR (Boyden et al., 2005; Sánchez Meador
et al., 2009).
2.3. Determining species interactions and predictors of regeneration height
To test the hypothesis that pine and sprouting species will display a
spatial pattern of repulsion, we performed Ripley’s bivariate K12(r)-r
analysis (Lotwick and Silverman, 1982) on each plot, also using the
spatstat package in R v.3.4.1. For this analysis, we pooled spatial loca-
tions of the sprouting species, Gambel oak and alligator juniper, as
“sprouters” on the Rodeo-Chediski Fire, and we also tested individual
eﬀects of each sprouter species on ponderosa pine spatial patterns. We
analyzed ponderosa pine regeneration as an event occurring a poster-
iori populations of sprouting species (holding the location of sprouting
species constant) instead of randomizing the location of all species,
assuming that most sprouting species established soon after the wild-
ﬁres, whereas ponderosa pine establishment likely occurred later
(Harrington, 1989; Haire and McGarigal, 2010). We used the Ri-
pley’s K12(r) bivariate function transformed form, L12(r)-r, proposed by
Besag (1977) to calculate the distances between points from diﬀerent
populations and formed conﬁdence envelopes by holding the locations
of the sprouting species constant while simulating ponderosa pine lo-
cations. Interpretation of analysis results were limited to lag distances
of 0–50 m (one-quarter the shortest plot dimension) to describe re-
lationships between two or more point patterns (e.g., pine regeneration
and established oak), to minimize the inﬂuence of unobserved points
near observed points close to the plot edge, and to maximize compar-
isons to similar studies reporting bivariate patterns in pine regeneration
(e.g., Sánchez Meador and Moore, 2010). A 95% conﬁdence envelope
was created by 999 Monte Carlo simulations of the independent point
processes null hypothesis (Goreaud and Pélissier, 2003), to evaluate
deviations from the null hypothesis. In our case, the null hypothesis was
that the location of ponderosa pine and sprouting species was produced
from two independent spatial point processes. The alternative hypoth-
esis was that the position of ponderosa pine seedlings was dependent on
the location of sprouting species; L12(r)-r values > 0 indicate a posi-
tive dependence between species, and L12(r)-r values < 0 indicate
repulsion between species (Goreaud and Pélissier, 2003).
To test the hypothesis that ponderosa pine regeneration height will
be greater near residual live trees and with less interspeciﬁc competi-
tion, we measured the heights of all stem-mapped regeneration, and we
derived the distance from each regenerating ponderosa pine to the
nearest residual live ponderosa pine tree and the density of regenera-
tion within 1 m of each regenerating pine. We determined the distance
from each regenerating ponderosa pine to the nearest residual live
ponderosa pine tree using imagery (Google Earth©, 2016) and ﬁeld
validation, including trees found along the forest edge, as well as single
trees within the interior of the burned patches. We used the Proximity-
Near tool in ArcGIS to determine the closest mature trees from all re-
generation. We deﬁned amount of competition as the density of
neighbors within a ﬁxed radius of 1 m around each regenerating pon-
derosa pine. Density and height of neighboring ponderosa pines (in-
traspeciﬁc competition) and sprouting species (interspeciﬁc competi-
tion) were determined within the 1-m buﬀer around each regenerating
ponderosa pine. We used a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM)
with a log-link function and Gaussian distribution to test the eﬀects of
closest residual ponderosa pine tree and the density and height of intra-
and interspeciﬁc neighbors on ponderosa pine height, and we included
plot as a random eﬀect in the model. All GLMM analyses were com-
pleted in SAS 9.4 (SAS PROC GLIMMIX©, 2017). We tested the eﬀect of
Gambel oak and alligator juniper density on ponderosa pine height
separately to understand the inﬂuence of each species.
3. Results
3.1. Regeneration density and spatial patterns
Regenerating ponderosa pine densities were lower in the interior
plots than edge plots on the Pumpkin Fire (t = −8.6; p < 0.01;
Fig. 2A), supporting part of our ﬁrst hypothesis. All plots exhibited
inhomogeneous point processes, except one interior plot (interior 2) on
the Pumpkin Fire (Appendix A). At a plot level, pine density sig-
niﬁcantly decreased with distance from forest edge in two out of the
three edge plots (three edge plots: p = 0. 01, 0.05, 1.0), and density did
not diﬀer with distance in any of the interior plots (p = 1.0 in all three
interior plots; Appendix B). Ponderosa pine densities were highly
variable on both edge and interior plots (edge plots: 13, 51.3, 153.8
stems ha−1; interior plots: 15.2, 31.2, 12 stems ha−1) (Fig. 2A). Other
tree species made up a small portion of the total regeneration. We
documented an average of 15.2 quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides
Michx.) stems ha−1 in the interior plots and 9.1 stems ha−1 in the edge
plots. We found an average of 6 juniper stems ha−1 in the edge plots
and 4.8 juniper stems ha−1 in the interior plots. These were likely al-
ligator juniper or Rocky Mountain juniper (Juniperus scopulorum Sarg.),
but we could not identify juveniles to species. We found an average
of < 1 Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) stem ha−1 in
the interior plots, and Douglas-ﬁr was not observed in the edge plots.
Both edge and interior plots on the Pumpkin ﬁre were dominated by
understory herbaceous plants.

On the Rodeo-Chediski Fire, ponderosa pine regeneration densities
were also lower in the interior plots than the edge plots (t = −3.5;
p < 0.01; Fig. 2B). All plots exhibited inhomogeneous point processes
(Appendix A). At a plot level, ponderosa pine densities decreased sig-
niﬁcantly with distance from forest edge in two out of the three edge
plots (three edge plots: p = 0.01, < 0.01, 1.0), and one interior plot
(p = 0.05). Ponderosa pine densities were not correlated with distance
from forest edge in one interior plot (p = 1.0), and density actually
increased (p = 0.01) with distance in one interior plot (Appendix B).
Ponderosa pine density was highly variable on edge and interior plots
(edge plots: 148.5, 86.3, 45.8 stems ha−1; interior plots: 44.5, 27.3,
124.0 stems ha−1). One interior plot located 220–420 m from any re-
sidual live trees unexpectedly had almost 3 times higher regeneration
densities than a nearby edge plot (interior and edge plots 3). Both edge
and interior plots on the Rodeo-Chediski Fire were dominated by
sprouting species. We documented an average of 969 Gambel oak stems
ha−1 (58, 415.8, and 2,433.8 stems ha−1) on the edge plots and 453
Gambel oak stems ha−1 (246, 8.3, and 1,104.5 stems ha−1) on the
interior plots. We found an average of 330 alligator juniper stems ha−1
(14.3, 519, 457.5 stems ha−1) on the edge plots and 464 alligator ju-
niper stems ha−1 (77, 291.8, 94.8 stems ha−1) on the interior plots. The
relationship between ponderosa pine vs. sprouter density was not
consistent. The edge plot with the highest density of sprouting species
had the least ponderosa pine regeneration. However, the interior plot
with the highest density of sprouting species had the most ponderosa
pine regeneration.
Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not observe diﬀerences in pon-
derosa pine spatial patterns between edge and interior plots on the
Pumpkin Fire (Fig. 3, Table 1, Appendix C). Ponderosa pine regenera-
tion exhibited signiﬁcant small-scale aggregation in two edge and two
interior plots from approximately 1 to 22 m lag distance, and had
uniform and/or random spatial patterns at larger scales (Fig. 3, Table 1,
Appendix C). Ponderosa pine regeneration did not fall outside complete
spatial randomness in one edge and in one interior plot (Fig. 3, Table 1,
Appendix C). Regeneration that displayed aggregation had patch sizes
ranging from 0.001 to 0.045 ha on one edge and one interior plot (edge
2, interior 1) (Table 1, Appendix C). Aspen regeneration was sig-
niﬁcantly aggregated on 5 of the 6 plots at varying lag distances (from 1
to 10 m up to 1 to 75 m) and displayed spatial randomness at other
distances (from 59 to 100 up to 1 to 100 m) on the Pumpkin Fire
(Appendices D and E).
We also did not observe diﬀerences in ponderosa pine spatial pat-
terns between edge and interior plots on the Rodeo-Chediski Fire
(Fig. 3, Table 1, Appendix C). Pine regeneration exhibited signiﬁcant
small-scale aggregation from 1 to 35 m lag distances, and had uniform
and/or random spatial patterns at larger scales on all plots (Fig. 3,
Table 1, Appendix C). Average patch sizes ranged from 0.001 to
0.031 ha, with the highest density on 2 interior plots (Table 1,
Appendix C). Furthermore, Gambel oak and alligator juniper were also
signiﬁcantly aggregated in all edge and interior plots at varying dis-
tances, except Gambel oak displayed a random distribution in one in-
terior plot (Fig. 4, Appendix F). Gambel oak and alligator juniper also
had varying patch sizes, and on some plots the patch was almost as
large as the 4-ha plot due to such high densities (Fig. 4, Appendix E).
3.2. Ponderosa pine species interactions and regeneration height
Populations of ponderosa pine and sprouting species were spatially
independent, contrary to our second hypothesis (Fig. 5). Ponderosa pine
and quaking aspen populations were spatially independent on all edge
and interior plots on the Pumpkin Fire. Ponderosa pine and pooled
sprouting species (alligator juniper and Gambel oak) were spatially
independent on all edge and interior plots on the Rodeo-Chediski Fire
(Fig. 5), and when sprouting species were analyzed separately, pon-
derosa pine and individual populations of alligator juniper and Gambel
oak were spatially independent on all plots (Appendix F). There was a
trend for more repulsion between pine and alligator juniper on plots
when juniper regeneration was dense, and attraction with Gambel oak,
but there were no statistically signiﬁcant patterns (Appendix F).
Contrary to our third hypothesis, regenerating pine height was not
greater near residual live trees or with less interspeciﬁc competition,
and model diﬀerences were driven by density and similar heights of
intraspeciﬁc neighbors. Distance from residual live trees did not explain
variation in regenerating ponderosa pine heights on either wildﬁre
(Pumpkin Fire: F = 1.40, p = 0.24; Rodeo-Chediski Fire: F = 0.22,
p = 0.64; Appendix G). The Pumpkin Fire had too few sprouting
neighbors within 1-m radius of regenerating ponderosa pines for the
model; therefore only intraspeciﬁc neighbors were included for neigh-
borhood density and height variables. Neighborhood intraspeciﬁc
density (F = 4.73, p = 0.03) and height (F = 9.21, p < 0.01) were
both positively correlated with ponderosa pine height on the Pumpkin
Fire
(Fig.
6A,
Appendix
H).
Neighborhood

(F = 45.47, p < 0.01) and height (F = 171.13, p < 0.01) were also
both positively correlated with ponderosa pine height on the Rodeo-
Chediski Fire, but the heights of neighboring sprouting species were not
signiﬁcant predictors of ponderosa pine height (Fig. 6B, Appendix H).

Neighboring Gambel oak (F = 1.90, p = 0.17) and alligator juniper
density (F = 3.33, p = 0.07) were also not signiﬁcant predictors of
ponderosa pine height (Appendix H).
4. Discussion
Our study found that pine densities were lower in the interiors of
high-severity burn patches than near forest edges, consistent with
previous studies (Haire and McGarigal, 2010; Chambers et al., 2016).
Seed dispersal from forest edges, protection from wind and sun, and
favorable soil conditions near forest edges likely led to higher pon-
derosa pine densities than in the interior plots (Teste et al., 2009; Haire
and McGarigal, 2010; Reynolds et al., 2013; Chambers et al., 2016;
Kemp et al., 2016). It may take longer for regeneration to occur within
the interiors than the edges of burn patches due to dispersal by wind or
birds vs. high seed pressure from nearby residual trees. Low ponderosa
pine regeneration densities in both plot types, and a dominance of ei-
ther understory herbaceous plants or sprouting trees, could be due to a
lack of adequate ponderosa pine seed-sources, slow recovery, or un-
favorable post-ﬁre habitat or climate conditions for ponderosa pine
regeneration (Pearson, 1950; Larson and Schubert, 1970; Haire and
McGarigal, 2010). These results could also be from superior regenera-
tion strategies from herbaceous or sprouting species that allowed them
to quickly recover in these large, treeless patches (Bond and Midgley,
2001; Battaglia et al., 2002). We investigated potential diﬀerences in
regeneration densities from topography and aspect and found no con-
sistent patterns, although two Colorado studies found reduced pine
regeneration
on
lower
elevations
and
more
southerly
aspects
(Chambers et al., 2016, Rother and Veblen, 2016).
Even though pine densities were lower in interior than edge plots,
regenerating ponderosa pines were nonetheless found over 300 m from
any residual live tree in all interior plots, suggesting long-distance
dispersal may be an important mechanism for regeneration in the in-
terior of burn patches (Haire and McGarigal, 2010; Lesser and Jackson,
2013). Similar to our ﬁndings, post-ﬁre ponderosa pine regeneration
has been found > 200 m from residual live trees (Bonnet et al., 2005;
Haire and McGarigal, 2010), and even up to > 10 km away from parent
trees, likely from scatter-hoarding by corvids and other birds (Lesser
and Jackson, 2013; Pesendorfer et al., 2016). Long-distance dispersal of
seeds can have a critical eﬀect on species survival and increase genetic
diversity in patchy landscapes (Ozawa et al., 2013). Long-distance

actual plot locations occur at varying distances from residual live forest edges and other plots.

dispersal likely contributed to the heterogeneous spatial patterns of
regenerating ponderosa pine in the interior plots as well.
We did not observe diﬀerences in the spatial patterns of re-
generating ponderosa pine between plot types as expected, suggesting
factors other than proximity to forest edges, such as animal seed dis-
persal or favorable microhabitat contributed to small-scale ponderosa
pine aggregation in both edge and interior plots (Oliver and Ryker,
1990; Lesser and Jackson, 2013; Pesendorfer et al., 2016). Ponderosa
pine regeneration was spatially aggregated at scales similar to those
found in managed ponderosa pine stands in Arizona and Montana
(Fajardo et al., 2006; Sánchez Meador and Moore, 2010). Small-scale
spatial aggregation in the edge plots may have been from rodents be-
cause they usually cache ponderosa pine seeds within 30 m of seed-
source trees (Vander Wall, 2003); whereas birds may have contributed
to seedling aggregation in the interior plots because they can cache
seeds > 10 km away from parent trees (Lesser and Jackson, 2013).
Aggregated ponderosa pine regeneration could occur in pockets of
preferred microhabitat, such as favorable soil conditions or near logs or
stumps that provide extra moisture or wind protection (Oliver and
Ryker, 1990; Teste et al., 2009; Sánchez Meador and Moore, 2010;
Castro et al., 2011). Southwest prevailing winds can also inﬂuence the
spatial location of seed dispersal, but we did not observe regeneration
aggregating along this direction. Post-ﬁre ponderosa pine can re-
generate in clumps, as well as by remotely dispersed individuals, de-
pending on seed sources and competition with sprouting species (Haire
and McGarigal, 2010).
We expected a spatial pattern of repulsion between ponderosa pine
and sprouting species because competition with sprouters inﬂuenced
seedling regeneration in other studies (Fulé and Covington, 1998;
Higgins et al., 2008). We observed a dominance of sprouting tree spe-
cies on the Rodeo-Chediski Fire, a pattern similarly found by other
studies (Barton, 2005; Savage and Mast, 2005; Strom and Fulé, 2007;
Coppoletta et al., 2016). Even though sprouting species were found at
high densities, we found spatial independence between ponderosa pine
and sprouting species on all of our plots, suggesting that sprouting
species did not repulse nor attract pine regeneration. Regenerating
ponderosa pine had a random association with the locations of Gambel
oak trees in northern Arizona under diﬀerent harvesting regimes
(Sánchez Meador and Moore, 2010). Perhaps interspeciﬁc competition
or facilitation is not always a strong driver of pine regeneration and
survival. There is evidence that ponderosa pine can establish beneath
oaks and eventually overtop them as they mature, which can sometimes
lead to decreases in sprouting species (McDonald, 1990; Vankat, 2013).
Interspeciﬁc competition and distance from forest edges did not
inﬂuence ponderosa pine growth as expected. Ponderosa pine re-
generation height in large high-severity burn patches could be the re-
sult of seedling age, microsite conditions, herbivory or facilitation
(Fajardo and McIntire, 2011; Waring and Goodrich, 2012; Smith et al.,
2016), rather than distance from forest edge or competition. A limita-
tion of this study was not knowing the age of each pine seedling. We
attributed diﬀerences in regenerating ponderosa heights between the
two wildﬁres (2-3X taller on the Rodeo-Chediski Fire) to diﬀerences in
Fig. 4. Stem maps of Gambel oak (blue squares) and alligator juniper

3 plots along the forest edges (edge), and 3 plots > 200 m from any live

temperature, moisture, soil nutrients, or herbivore or insect damage
(Puhlick et al., 2012, 2013). The positive correlation between pon-
derosa pine height and neighboring ponderosa pine heights and den-
sities, suggests that similar ages established together or similar en-
vironmental conditions inﬂuenced establishment and growth (Oliver
and Ryker, 1990). It is also possible that facilitation could be a stronger
process than intraspeciﬁc competition, a pattern observed by Fajardo
and McIntire (2011), and led to greater height and ultimately survival.
Rapid height growth may also allow regenerating ponderosa pines to
survive a subsequent ﬁre (Bailey and Covington, 2002; Battaglia et al.,
2009). Approximately half of the ponderosa pine regeneration on the
Rodeo-Chediski Fire and a fourth on the Pumpkin Fire had heights >
1.4 m, with a measurable diameter at breast height (DBH). Ponderosa
pine seedlings can be more ﬁre-resistant at 3 m height (Bailey and
Covington, 2002), and those ∼2 m tall are predicted to require > 2 m
tall ﬂame length to cause mortality (Battaglia et al., 2009).
If established post-ﬁre ponderosa pines survive and regeneration
continues to occur on these high-severity burn patches, some tree cover
will be regained, even if below historical densities. Historical ponderosa
pine densities ranged from 49 to 115 trees ha−1 in areas near the
Pumpkin
and
Rodeo-Chediski
Fires,
determined
by
den-
drochronological reconstructions of forest structure in 1879 (Rodman
et al., 2016, 2017). Four out of our twelve plots fell within this range,
and others were just below based on a projected 44% survival rate of
seedlings to mature trees from the 5th to 50th year after planting in
northern Arizona (DeWald and Mahalovich, 2008; Ouzts et al., 2015).
Pine regeneration is potentially faced with additional challenges such
as ﬁre, drought, herbivory, disease, and further competition with
neighboring species that could reduce survival rates (Huﬀman et al.,
2012; Waring and Goodrich, 2012; Savage et al., 2013; Rother and
Veblen, 2016). However, most regenerating pines have already made it
through the high-mortality stage, within the ﬁrst few years of germi-
nation (Pearson, 1950), and new seedlings on our study sites are still
establishing. The small subset of aged post-ﬁre ponderosa pines (data

not shown) revealed an age range of 2–13 years-old, suggesting that
regeneration is episodic in this area and not necessarily concentrated in
the ﬁrst few years after the ﬁres, similar to ﬁndings by Haire and
McGarigal (2010). We did not observe any pine seedlings or saplings
that were producing cones on our plots; in the future, such reproduction
may become a localized seed-source and serve to ﬁll in treeless gaps,
assuming seedlings survive and reproduce.
Historical ponderosa pine forests also had patterns of structural
heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales (Mast and Wolf, 2004; Reynolds
et al., 2013; Rodman et al., 2016), including trees of diﬀerent size and
age classes and an open structure over large portions of the landscape
(Sánchez Meador et al., 2011). Regenerating ponderosa pines on our
study sites already exhibit some patterns of spatial and structural
(variable seedling ages and heights) heterogeneity, but with reduced
average patch sizes. Regenerating ponderosa pine patch sizes from our
plots averaged ≥3 X smaller than reported historical regeneration
patch sizes (averaging 0.01 ha) across northern Arizona (reviewed in
Stephens and Fry, 2005). Ponderosa pine regeneration patch sizes
varied across the burned landscape, and the stem-maps revealed
openings, widely-spaced single seedlings, and seedling aggregation,
similar to the mosaic of ﬁre-frequent forests described by Larson and
Churchill (2012). However, it is unclear if regeneration on our study
sites will emulate historical spatial patterns because drier conditions,
increased wildﬁre activity and widespread conifer loss are forecasted to
increase in the coming decades (McDowell et al., 2016; Abatzoglou and
Williams, 2016).
4.1. Conclusions and management implications
Both spatial and non-spatial information on post-ﬁre regeneration
are vital for future management plans. By contrasting the edge and
interiors of burn patches, we found that 12+ years post-ﬁre, in high-
severity burn patches, ponderosa pine regeneration had similar het-
erogeneous spatial patterns and interactions with neighboring species,
yet lower densities in the interior patches. Intraspeciﬁc facilitation and
more time could eventually lead to higher ponderosa pine densities.
However, given the predictions for warming climates and increased
wildﬁres (McDowell et al., 2016; Abatzoglou and Williams, 2016), this
heterogeneous stage of forest development, that includes native
sprouting species could be more resilient to drought and high-severity
ﬁres than dense pine stands. Forest managers may need to adopt new
objectives such as accepting forest types that could be more adapted to
climate change and high-severity ﬁres (including more drought-tolerant
sprouting species). High-severity wildﬁres and climate change are
predicted to favor sprouting species over ponderosa pine on the Rodeo-
Chediski Fire (Strom and Fulé, 2007; Azpeleta Tarancón et al., 2014).
New vegetation types may be a future reality, especially since a com-
bination of adequate moisture and ﬁre-free periods are needed for the
initiation of ponderosa pine regeneration and maintenance of pine-
dominant forests (Iniguez et al., 2016). Future climate change is pre-
dicted to result in large-scale vegetation displacement and reorganiza-
tion for some elevation zones in Arizona (Flatley and Fulé, 2016). Post-
wildﬁre non-forested patches or alternative vegetation types can also be
areas of resilience to climate variability and resistance to subsequent
ﬁre within portions of the pine-dominant landscape (Coop et al., 2016;
Schoennagel et al., 2017).
We recommend that managers use an experimental/adaptive ap-
proach to reach goals of resilient landscapes and ﬁre-adapted commu-
nities in light of the prediction of potential vegetation shifts and in-
creased risk of high-severity wildﬁres in the future. Biotic and abiotic
conditions vary greatly across western US ponderosa pine forests
(Oliver and Ryker, 1990), and management treatments should adapt
accordingly. There is value in experimenting with a variety of treat-
ments by incorporating a before–after–control–impact (BACI) design;
this approach is useful in controlling confounding factors, so that ob-
served changes are likely due to management treatments (Underwood,
1994). Potential post-ﬁre management strategies could include in-
troducing ﬁre (with seasonal variabilities), while regeneration is small
if overly dense, or waiting for trees to reach greater heights to become
more ﬁre-resistant (Bailey and Covington, 2002; Battaglia et al., 2009).
If management goals are to restore ponderosa forests, planting pine
seedlings in the interiors of high-severity burn patches could be an
option (Ouzts et al., 2015). However, plantings should reﬂect the goal
of spatial heterogeneity instead of uniformity, and should not be overly
dense so that they increase future ﬁre severity (Thompson et al., 2007).
There are also advantages for a natural recovery processes, such as
increased plant diversity and more resilient vegetation types (Haire and
McGarigal, 2010; Fornwalt and Kaufmann, 2014; Coop et al., 2016).
Other management options revolve around reducing the potential
for large high severity ﬁres by increasing thinning and managed ﬁre to
maintain recently treated stands that resemble historical forests or
thinning high density stands (Fulé et al., 2012; Stevens-Rumann et al.,
2012; Stephens et al., 2016; Huﬀman et al., 2017). Pre-wildﬁre thin-
ning and prescribed ﬁre treatments on the Rodeo-Chediski Fire reduced
ﬁre severity and signiﬁcantly increased ponderosa pine regeneration,
compared to untreated areas (Shive et al., 2013). Restoration eﬀorts to
reduce the risk of stand-replacing wildﬁres should include the goal of
spatial heterogeneity to increase resilience to future climate and wild-
ﬁre conditions, as recommended by Larson and Churchill (2012), and
long-term, permanent plots are essential for quantifying treatment
success or ecosystem changes over time (Sánchez Meador and Moore,
2010).
