Long-term Herbivore Exclusion for 
Recovery of Buckbrush (Ceanothus fendleri ) 
Populations During Restoration of Ponderosa 
Pine Forests in Northern Arizona 
David W Huﬀman, Judith D. Springer and W. Walker Chancellor
ABSTRACT
Open conditions created by restoration activities in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of the American Southwest 
can lead to increases in understory plant productivity but also attract large ungulate herbivores. In this study, we remea-
sured buckbrush (Ceanothus fendleri ) plants on permanent plots to determine effects of long-term herbivore exclusion 
on population abundance and potential reproduction. Results showed that survival of buckbrush was signiﬁcantly lower 
on unprotected plots compared with plants given long-term herbivore protection. A greater proportion of the highest 
stem density class (> 50 stems m–²) was found on long-term protection plots compared with short-term protection or 
unprotected groups. The unprotected group was overwhelmingly (90%) made up of plots with less than 10 aerial stems 
m–². Plots with long-term protection had a signiﬁcantly greater proportion of plots in the highest ﬂowering class (> 50% 
of aerial stems ﬂowering) than unprotected plots. Logistic regression showed a strong, positive relationship ( p < 0.001; 
R² = 0.61) between the probability of ﬂowering and plant height. Results indicated that short-term protection following 
forest restoration treatments marginally improves survival of buckbrush in these ecosystems. However, herbivory pressure 
remained high over the 12-year study period and detrimentally affected potential reproduction of plants exposed to large 
herbivores. These ﬁndings generally suggest that short-term protection may not be sufﬁcient to conserve buckbrush popu-
lations over time and high herbivory pressure may be constraining understory responses and slowing restoration success.

ties has declined in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) 
forests of the Southwest since Euro-American settlement

understory plant cover, and subsequent decades of ﬁre 
suppression resulted in large increases in tree density that 
 Restoration Recap 
• Open conditions created by tree thinning for restoration 
of ponderosa pine forests in the American Southwest 
often attract large herbivores, and grazing pressure on 
the recovering understory may be high.
• In this study, we sought to determine if long-term protec-
tion from large herbivores was required to restore buck-
brush population abundance and potential reproduction 
after thinning of ponderosa pine forests in northern Arizona.
• Survival of buckbrush was signiﬁcantly lower on unpro-
tected plots compared with plants given lower on 
unprotected plots compared with plants given long-term 
herbivore protection.
• Plots with long-term protection had a signiﬁcantly greater 
proportion of ﬂowering stems than both short-term pro-
tection and unprotected groups.
• Findings suggested that herbivory pressure remained high 
over the 12-year study period. To achieve broad restora-
tion goals, managers may need to consider controlling 
large herbivores or their access to ponderosa pine sites for 
a number of years after implementation of tree thinning 
and prescribed ﬁre.

exacerbated understory degradation by altering physical 
environments and ecosystem processes (Covington and 
Moore 1994, Kolb et al. 1994, Moore et al. 1999, Allen et 
al. 2002). These changes have in turn reduced habitat qual-
ity for various wildlife species, particularly large ungulate 
herbivores (Covington and Moore 1994). Ecological res-
toration activities in these forests focus on thinning small 
and young trees, and reintroducing surface fire. These 
treatments are thought to be effective at reestablishing 
natural ranges of variability for a number of structural and 
functional attributes (Moore et al. 1999). Opening forest 
canopies and encouraging low-severity fire can improve 
growing conditions for many native plant species (Cov-
ington et al. 1997, Moore et al. 1999, Laughlin et al. 2008, 
McGlone et al. 2009). New plant growth stimulated by 
thinning and burning can provide greater forage quantity 
and quality for herbivores (Whelan 1995), but increases in 
plant production may progress over several years follow-
ing the initial restoration treatments (Moore et al. 2006). 
During this lag, the more open conditions created by tree 
thinning often attract species such as mule deer (Odocoi-
leus hemionus) and Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus) 
(Reynolds 1964, Patton 1974), and grazing pressure on 
the recovering understory may be high (Huffman and 
Moore 2003). Growth and reproduction of plant species 
preferred by these herbivores can be severely constrained 
unless additional management actions are taken. Some 
options during the interim period when understories are 
recovering include excluding herbivores from the site or 
protecting individual plants for a number of years follow-
ing restoration treatments (Huffman and Moore 2003). In 
these systems, it is unclear how long herbivory pressure 
on preferred plants remains high or whether understories 
gain sufficient species richness and abundance to sate local 
herbivores and allow understories to recover. If herbivory 
pressure remains high, short-term protection of grazed 
species may provide opportunity for escape through mass 
or development of structural defenses such as spines or 
thorns (Sheppard and Fairweather 1994, Hanley et al. 2007).
Buckbrush (Ceanothus fendleri) is a medium-sized shrub 
(≤ 1 m height) that is common to ponderosa pine forests of 
the southwestern U.S., northern Mexico, and the southern 
Rocky Mountains as far north as Wyoming (Kearney and 
Peebles 1964, SEINet 2014). Like its congeners, buckbrush 
is a non-leguminous, nitrogen-fixing species that can con-
tribute to ecosystem nutrient budgets (Story 1974). In 
southwestern ponderosa pine forests where understories 
are primarily composed of herbaceous plants, buckbrush 
shrubs contribute to structural heterogeneity and enhance 
habitat for wildlife. Its leaves, stems, flowers, and fruit 
are used by various animal species, both vertebrates and 
invertebrates (Urness et al. 1975, Conard et al. 1985, Allen 
1996, Huffman and Moore 2003, Huffman 2006, Huffman 
et al. 2009). Tree thinning and low- to moderate-intensity 
fire illicit positive responses of both resprouting from 
belowground root crowns and germination of dormant 
seeds in soil seed banks (Vose and White 1987, Vose and 
White 1991, Huffman and Moore 2004, Huffman 2006). 
Thus, forest restoration treatments such as tree thinning 
and prescribed fire have the potential to increase growth 
and reproduction of buckbrush. This is particularly true 
if plants are protected from herbivores for the first one to 
two years after treatment implementation. For example, 
Huffman and Moore (2003) showed that two years after 
forest treatments buckbrush plants protected from mule 
deer and Rocky Mountain elk herbivory had significantly 
greater stem number, longer stems, and greater current-
year biomass than unprotected plants. In contrast, branches 
of unprotected plants were heavily browsed and just 8% of 
these plants produced inflorescences. Over the long-term, 
this level of herbivory may strongly reduce population 
growth (Huffman and Moore 2008). It is thought that short-
term protection from herbivores during early stages of 
forest restoration may allow plants to develop enough bio-
mass that they are able to maintain growth and size when 
protection is removed and regain expression of life history 
traits such as flowering and seed production. Chancellor et 
al. (2008) showed that after one growing season buckbrush 
plants exposed to herbivores after seven years of protection 
had similar stem lengths and stem numbers as plants that 
continued to be protected. Leaf area and leaf biomass, how-
ever, were significantly less on the recently exposed plants 
than on protected plants (Chancellor et al. 2008). In addi-
tion to gaining size and vigor, plants may develop woody 
thorns that provide structural defense against vertebrate 
herbivory (Chancellor et al. 2008). Herbivory pressure may 
be lessened with increasing plant community diversity and 
as more forage options become available to herbivores over 
time following restoration treatments.
In this study, we remeasured buckbrush plants stud-
ied by Huffman and Moore (2003), and Chancellor et al. 
(2008) in ponderosa pine forests of northern Arizona. We 
wanted to determine if long-term protection from herbi-
vores was required to restore buckbrush population abun-
dance and potential reproduction after forest treatments. 
Three competing hypotheses were plausible, each with 
distinct implications for restoration. Hypotheses were as 
follows: H0: Long-term protection does not affect popula-
tion abundance and potential reproduction as shown by no 
statistical differences between protected and unprotected 
plants. If true, this hypothesis would suggest that plants 
exposed to herbivores regain characteristics of protected 
plants over time through reduced herbivory, and continue 
to produce flowers and viable seeds. Thus protection is not 
necessary. H1: Long-term protection increases population 
abundance and reproductive potential as compared with 
short-term protection and no protection. This hypothesis, 
if true, would suggest that herbivory remains high and 
short-term protection after forest restoration treatments 
may not be sufficient to conserve buckbrush life history

processes over time. H₂: Long-term and short-term pro-
tection result in similar demographic characteristics, but 
both show greater abundance and potential reproduction 
than unprotected plants. Tis hypothesis, being true, would 
suggest that eﬀects of herbivory are lessened by short-term 
protection during the ﬁrst years following forest restoration 
treatments, either through reduced levels of herbivory or 
plant development of resistance mechanisms.
Methods
Study Area
Our study of buckbrush populations was conducted in one 
forest restoration treatment unit on the Coconino National 
Forest and two units on the Fort Valley Experimental 
Forest approximately 10 km northwest of Flagstaﬀ, Ari-
zona (Figure 1). Elevation at the site ranges from 2,225 to 
2,380 m above mean sea level. Average annual precipita-
tion is about 52 cm, falling in a bimodal pattern with late 
summer rain and winter snow peak periods. Topography 
is gentle with average slopes of approximately 5–10%. Soils 
are moderately well-drained, Brolliar clay loams (Typic 
Argiustolls) developed on tertiary basalt parent material.
Forests at the site are composed mainly of ponderosa 
pine. Te majority of trees are less than 120-years-old 
with some older trees scattered through the units (Fulé 
et al. 2001). Common understory species include peren-
nial grasses, such as Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica), 
mountain muhly (Muhlenbergia montana), bottlebrush 
squirreltail (Elymus elymoides), and pine dropseed (Blepha-
roneuron tricholepis); forbs such as lupine (Lupinus spp.),

fleabane (Erigeron spp.), buckwheat (Eriogonum spp.), 
yarrow (Achillea millefolium), and pussytoes (Antennaria 
spp.); and shrubs buckbrush and Woods’ rose (Rosa wood-
sii). Mule deer and Rocky Mountain elk are large herbivores 
that frequent the site, and smaller vertebrate mammals 
(e.g., lagomorphs) also occur. Domestic livestock are not 
present on the study site.
Study Design and Field Measurements
In 1998–1999, P. ponderosa trees were thinned within the 
three 14–16-ha forest units as part of an experiment to 
test alternative ecological restoration treatments. Thin-
ning reduced tree density by 77–88% and basal area by 
35–56% (Fulé et al. 2001). Immediately after thinning, we 
systematically searched the understory plant communi-
ties and located 60 buckbrush patches in each unit (n = 
180). Patches were discrete assemblages of aerial stems 
ranging up to approximately 4 m2 in extent. Buckbrush 
produces branching, sometimes prostrate, aerial stems 
from root crowns below ground (Conard et al. 1985). In 
this study, we refer to all aerial stems within a plot (see 
details concerning plots below) as a “plant”; however, we 
acknowledge that identifying true individuals within a 
patch of stems is problematic. Stem patches were assigned 
a number, marked with pin flags, and then randomized into 
“protected” and “unprotected” treatments. In 1999, we con-
structed “rabbit wire” exclosures around plants selected for 
the protected treatment in order to protect the shrubs from 
vertebrate herbivores. Exclosures were 2 × 2 m in area and 
1.4 m in height. At the time of exclosure installation, there 
were no significant differences in stem number or plant 
height between plants in protected and unprotected plots. 
However, numerous differences between treatment groups 
were observed both one and two growing seasons after 
protection (Huffman and Moore 2003). Generally, plants 
protected by exclosures supported significantly greater 
biomass and showed greater rates of flowering than those 
that were not protected.
When the study was initiated in 1999, we established 
sample plots centered on each of the buckbrush plants 
located in the field. Plots were circular and 1-m2 in area 
(56.4 cm radius). Plot centers were marked with metal 
stakes driven into the ground and numbered aluminum 
tags were wired to the stakes for long-term sampling. 
Prescribed surface fire is a component of the general res-
toration prescription for ponderosa pine forests in the 
region. In 2000 and 2001, half of the buckbrush plots, both 
protected and not protected, were burned using prescribed 
fire. In 2002, plants that had died (n = 37) as a result of 
experimental burning or other causes were removed from 
the dataset. In previous studies, we used stem counts on 
plots as a measure of plant survival. In spring of 2006, we 
randomly selected half of the remaining protected plots 
and removed their exclosures. At this time, there were 
no significant differences in stem number or plant height 
between plants with exclosures removed and those with 
exclosures maintained. Thus in 2006, our experimental 
design had the following treatment groups: 1) unprotected 
(n = 65; never protected from herbivores); 2) short-term 
protection (n = 39; exclosures installed in 1999, removed 
in 2006); and 3) long-term protection (n = 39; exclosures 
installed in 1999 and maintained throughout study period). 
In 2007, all three forest units were burned again with pre-
scribed surface fire and all buckbrush plots were allowed 
to burn.
In late June, 2011, we relocated all plots where live plants 
were noted in 2002. Late June was chosen as this time 
typically corresponds to the peak period of buckbrush 
flowering at the study site. On each plot, number of aerial 
buckbrush stems was counted and plots were placed into 
one of three stem density classes: < 10 stems; 10–50 stems; 
and > 50 stems. Number of flowering stems was counted 
and plots were placed into one of three classes: no flowering 
stems; ≤ 50% of aerial stems flowering; and > 50% of stems 
flowering. Plant height was measured to the nearest 10 cm.
Data Analysis
To test for differences in survival between pairs of treat-
ments, we used a Chi-square test (2 × 2 contingency table) 
for each pairwise comparison (unprotected vs. short-term 
protection, unprotected vs. long-term protection, short-
term protection vs. long-term protection).We assumed 
plant survival to be zero on plots with no living stems. 
To test if flowering was associated with treatment at the 
plot level, we classified plot observations into categorical 
responses (flowering stems present on plot; flowering stems 
absent on plot) and conducted pairwise Chi-square tests 
as described above. We also classified plots by stem density 
(< 10 stems, 10–50 stems, and > 50 stems per plot) and by 
percentage of stems flowering (0 flowering stems, 1–50% 
of stems with flowers, and > 50% of stems with flowers) 
and used Chi-square tests to make pairwise comparisons 
among treatments. Proportions were considered signifi-
cantly different at 1-tailed p-values of ≤ 0.025. The rela-
tionship between probability of flowering and plant height 
was tested using logistic regression (Neter et al. 1989). All 
analyses were performed using SAS JMP Pro (11.2).

Results
Survival of buckbrush was signiﬁcantly lower on the unpro-
tected plots (65%) than long-term protection plots (85%) 
(χ² = 4.85; p < 0.025), but statistically similar to short-term 
protection plots (79%) (Table 1). In 2002, live aerial stems 
were present on 65 plots in the unprotected group. By 2011, 
this number had decreased to 42 plots. Both short-term 
and long-term protection treatments had 39 plots with live 
stems present in 2002; stems were found on 31 and 33 plots 
for these groups, respectively, in 2011 (Table 1). Flowering 
stems were found on a signiﬁcantly higher proportion of 
long-term protection plots (χ² = 32.6–37.0; p < 0.001) than 
either short-term protection or unprotected plots (Table 1).
Te long-term protection treatment was the only treat-
ment that had plots (~ 18%) in the highest stem density 
class (> 50 stems m–²) (Figure 2A). Te unprotected group 
was overwhelmingly (90%) made up of plots with less than 
10 aerial stems m–². Te short-term protection group had 
approximately equal proportions of plots with < 10 and 
with 10–50 aerial stems m–².Similarly, the long-term pro-
tection treatment had a signiﬁcantly greater proportion of 
plots (χ² = 24.5; p < 0.001) in the highest ﬂowering class 
(> 50% of aerial stems ﬂowering) than the unprotected 
plots (Figure 2B). Tere were no short-term protected 
plots on which 50% or more of the stems produced ﬂowers. 
Te vast majority (> 70%) of plots in the short-term and 
unprotected groups had no ﬂowering stems whatsoever.
Logistic regression showed a strong, positive relationship 
( p < 0.001; pseudo R² = 0.61) between the probability of 
ﬂowering and plant height (Figure 3). All plots with plant 
heights > 40 cm had ﬂowering stems present.
Discussion
Results of our study showed that mortality, stem den-
sity, and potential reproduction of buckbrush plants were 
aﬀected by exposure to large herbivores. Tese results sug-
gests that herbivory pressure remains high on unprotected 
buckbrush plants, although thinning and prescribed burn-
ing treatments were implemented more than a decade prior 
to this study. Restoration treatments were done, in part, to 
restore understory productivity and diversity (Moore et al. 
1999, Stoddard et al. 2011).
Although deer and elk intensively browse buckbrush 
(Urness et al. 1975, Huﬀman and Moore 2003), increases 
in plant community diversity expected to follow overstory 
thinning and prescribed ﬁre should alleviate herbivory 
pressure on buckbrush as more forage resources become 
available to large herbivores (Pimm 1994). However, in an 
earlier study at our study site, Stoddard et al. (2011) found 
no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in either total understory plant 
cover or species richness between areas receiving forest 
restoration treatments and untreated control units, ﬁve 
years afer restoration treatments were completed. Fulé et 
al. (2002) found decreases in understory species richness

and frequency one-year post-treatment in a ponderosa 
pine forest near Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona. 
In contrast, Moore et al. (2006) found greater herbaceous 
standing crop after implementation of forest restora-
tion treatments compared with an untreated control at a 
northern Arizona site where large herbivores are excluded. 
Although not examined in this study, we suspect that high 
herbivory pressure at our site may have delayed or limited 
understory community responses to restoration treat-
ments (e.g., Pimm 1994) and created a positive feedback 
process that keeps herbivory pressure high on buckbrush 
plants. Plants on short-term protection plots appeared to 
have gained advantage from 7 years of protection as indi-
cated by higher survival than plants on no exclosure plots. 
Advantages likely included increased woodiness of stems, 
increased spinescence, and higher available carbohydrate 
resources (Huffman and Moore 2003, Hanley et al. 2007, 
Chancellor et al. 2008).
Plants with long-term protection showed significantly 
greater flowering than both short-term protection and 
unprotected plants (Table 1; Figure 2B). Plants with shorter 
stems tended to have lower rates of flowering than plants 
with relatively long stems (Figure 3). Although plant repro-
ductive responses to herbivory are complex and may be 
influenced by genetic, physiological, morphological, and 
resource factors (Maschinski and Whitham 1989, Obeso 
1993, Massad 2013), results from the present study parallel 
those found previously by Huffman and Moore (2003) for 
this population of buckbrush. It is unclear whether results 
would vary with lower intensities of herbivory or for differ-
ent populations of this species (Rooney and Waller 2003). 
However, the relationship we found between stem length 
and probability of flowering suggests that reproductive 
responses of buckbrush to herbivory may be related to 
changes in resource allocation as well as direct loss of meri-
stematic tissue. For example, Fletcher et al. (2001) found 
that white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) browsing 
of apical meristems reduced mean height and halted sea-
sonal growth and reproduction of Turk’s cap lily (Lilium 
superbum) plants in Virginia.
Over time, reductions in potential reproduction due 
to herbivory may have detrimental effects on popula-
tion abundance (Rooney and Waller 2003). For example, 
Huffman et al. (2008) modeled population dynamics 
for 25 years and found significant interactions between 
restoration treatments, herbivory, and low-intensity fire. 
Simulations showed steady population decline for plants 
not protected from herbivores and burned frequently; 
responses resulted from relatively high mortality and 
low reproduction. These declines were similar to those of 
plants growing under dense unrestored forest conditions. 
In contrast, plants protected from herbivores and burned 
frequently showed population increases resulting from 
resprouting and seed/seedling inputs (i.e., maintained high 
levels of reproduction) (Huffman et al. 2008). In addition 
to direct effects on plant population dynamics, intense 
ungulate herbivory may have indirect effects on ecosystem 
food webs (Rooney and Waller 2003, Huffman et al. 2009).
Conclusions
Our study showed that short-term protection following 
forest restoration treatments marginally improved survival 
of buckbrush in a northern Arizona ponderosa pine ecosys-
tem. However, herbivory pressure, documented to be high 
immediately following restoration (Huffman and Moore 
2003), remained high over 11 additional years and detri-
mentally affected potential reproduction. These findings 
generally supported our hypothesis (H1) and suggest that 
short-term protection may not be sufficient to conserve 
buckbrush populations over time. Further, we surmise that 
high herbivory pressure on buckbrush indicates that under-
story community response to forest restoration treatments 
may be progressing at a slower rate than that which may 
be possible with fewer large herbivores such as mule deer 
and Rocky Mountain elk (Pimm 1994, Rooney and Waller 
2003). To achieve broad goals, managers engaged in res-
toration efforts in these ecosystems may need to consider 
controlling large herbivores or their access to restoration 
sites for a number of years after implementation of tree 
thinning and prescribed fire. Understory responses should 
be carefully monitored to determine carrying capacities 
for large herbivores. Further, a greater degree of coordina-
tion is needed between administrative agencies and units 
tasked with management of vegetation and that of wildlife. 
Long-term monitoring of populations of preferred browse 
species such as C. fendleri may provide effective indicators 
of restoration success.
