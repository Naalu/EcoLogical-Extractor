Changes in Understory Production Follow- 
ing a Wildfire in Southwestern Ponderosa 
Pine 
BRIAN P. OSWALD AND W. WALLACE COVINGTON 
Abstract 
An area burned by a May, 1972, wildfire and which had been 
previously sampled in 1972 and 1974 was remeasured in 1980 to 
determine changes in under-story production. The area was strati- 
fied into moderately and severely burned areas. By 1974 both 
herbage and forage production on the moderately burned area 
were approximately 3 times higher than unburned control sites and 
did not decline significantly by 1980. While increased herbage 
production on the severely burned site was similar to that of the 
moderately burned site in 1974, it declined to only half as much 
production by 1980. Furthermore, while over 95% of the total 
herbage production was in forage species for all 3 sampling years 
on the moderately burned study area, only 30 percent was forage 
on the severely burned study area by 1980. The decline in total 
production and shift to non-forage species on the severely burned 
study area is probably a consequence of heavy grazing which 
followed the bum. 
Since settlement in the late 1800’s forage production 
in south- 
western ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosul) has steadily declined. 
Early explorers recorded the area as open and park-like with large, 
widely spaced trees and an abundant 
understory 
of grasses and 
forbs (Cooper 
1960). Today, increased tree density and heavy 
forest floor accumulations, 
brought about by fire exclusion, have 
greatly decreased herbaceous production (Cooper 1961a, Clary et 
al. 1966, and others). The heavy fuel loadings have resulted in an 
exponential 
increase in the size and severity of wildfires in south- 
western 
ponderosa 
pine (Barrows*). 
Several 
studies 
suggest 
changes in production, 
forage quality, and species composition in 
understory 
vegetation for the first few years following wildfires. 
However, only one has examined long term wildfire effects on the 
understory. 
Pearson et al. ( 1972) studied the effects of wildfire on ponderosa 
pine understory 
vegetation on basalt soils in northern 
Arizona: 
The burned area was divided into moderately burned and severely 
burned areas. Vegetation production 
on the thinned, moderately 
burned area increased from 729 kilograms per hectare to 861 
kilograms per hectare the first year after the fire. Production on the 
unthinned, 
severely burned area increased from 59 kilograms per 
hectare the first year to 1146 kilograms per hectare the next year. A 
similar study by Beaulieu (1975) and Fitzhugh 
and Beaulieu-’ 
examined wildfire effects on ponderosa pine understory on lime- 
stone soils in northern Arizona. As in the study by Pearson et al. 
(1972), the area burned by the 1972 Rattle Burn wildfire was

divided into moderately and severely burned areas. Production 
increased almost threefold 2 years after the wildfire on both areas. 
Beaulieu (1975) found herbage production 
higher on the burned 
areas than on the unburned areas 3 years after the same wildfire. 
The only long-term study of understory response to wildfire in 
southwestern 
ponderosa pine is that of Lowe et al. (1978), who 
measured understory basal area for areas with basalt-derived soil 
which had burned 1,3,7, and 20 years prior to their sampling. They 
found that forbs increased rapidly to a maximum at year 3 fol- 
lowed by a rapid decline by year 7 to control levels. Grasses 
declined the first year, but increased to a maximum by year 7. By 
year 20 grasses had declined somewhat but were still over twice the 
control. No long-term studies of wildfire effects on understory for 
sedimentary 
sites are available. 
The objective of our study was to determine the extent of 
changes in understory 
vegetation 
production 
7 years after the 
Rattle Burn wildfire. The approach was to remeasure the perman- 
ent plots used in the Beaulieu (1975) and Fitzhugh and Beaulieu 
(unpublished) 
studies and to compare our data with data from 
1972 and 1974. 
Study Area 
The Rattle Burn fire started on May 7,1972, and burned 286 ha 
before containment. 
The burned area is 30 km southwest of Flag- 
staff, Coconino 
County, Ariz. The burn is within the Coconino 
National Forest, Sections 15, 16, 20, 21, 27, and 28, Tl9N, RSE, 
Gila and Salt River Base Meridian. The burn was separated into 2 
areas: a severely burned portion, where a high intensity ground and 
crown fire consumed most of the soil organic matter and plant life, 
and moderately burned portion, where a ground fire killed most 
understory vegetation and some sapling size ponderosa pine. 
A severely burned sample area (8.1 ha) and a moderately burned 
sample area (4.0 ha) were established in 1972 within the burned 
areas. An unburned 
South Control area (17.7 ha) was established 
southwest of the burn at the same time. In 1974, Fitzhugh and 
Beaulieu (unpublished) established a North Control area northeast 
of the burn. 
Eighty percent of the burn area has a rolling plateau surface with 
a relief of 25 m or less. Slopes range from 0 to 20%, and the 
elevation of the area ranges from 1900 to 2060 m. Soils are predom- 
inantly sandy loams in the Soldier, Hoggs, and McVickers series 
over Kaibab limestone and Coconino sandstone bedrock (Beaulieu 
1975). 
The average daily temperature of the Rattle Burn area is approx- 
imately 6O C. The area receives approximately 
49 cm of precipita- 
tion annually, 
most in the form of winter snow. 
The overstory 
vegetation 
is predominantly 
ponderosa 
pine 
(Pinus ponderos?) 
with scattered white fir (Abies concolor), 
Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), Gambel oak (Quercus gam- 
belii), and alligator juniper 
(Juniperus deppeana). Understory 
vegetation included species of Bromus. Carex, Agropyron, Poa, 
Senecio, Solidago, Muhlenbergia, Lathyrus, as well as Pteridiun

aquilinum, 
Gutierrezia sarothrae, 
Vicia americana, Lupinus hillii, 
and a variety of other grasses and herbaceous plants. 
Two years before the fire, the area was logged. Average harvest 
was 6750 board feet per hectare. Skid trails were seeded at a rate of 
6.7 kilograms 
per hectare with sheep fescue (Festuca 
ovina), 
orchard grass (Dactylis glomerata), 
smooth brome (Bromus iner- 
mis), timothy (Phleumpratense), 
and burnet (Sanguisorba annua, 
and S. minor) (Fitzhugh and Beaulieu, unpublished). 
The seeded 
species did not become a significant portion of the vegetal com- 
munity (Beaulieu 1975). 
A reduction in overstory was one effect of the wildfire. The basal 
area of the moderate burn changed from 30.5 m*/ ha before the fire 
to 23.6 rnz/ ha after the fire. The severely burned area changed from 
29.6 m*/ ha to 9.2 m*/ ha for the same period. No significant change 
has occurred in the overstory since the fire. A post-fire salvage 
harvest removed 
1,850,OOO board feet in the summer of 1972. 
During the summer of 1973, an area that included the southern 
control area was thinned. Cleanup operations with heavy equip- 
ment in the burned area continued 
during the summer of 1973, 
causing the disturbance 
of soil and some vegetation plots. 
The area used as the South Control in 1972 and 1974 was 
prescribed burned in the spring of 1977. This necessitated the use of 
the North Control as the only control area in 1980. 
The Rattle Burn area includes parts of 2 Forest Service grazing 
allotments and has been grazed for the past several decades. 
Methods 
In 1972,30 timber inventory plots (.04 hectares) were established 
in each of the designated severe, moderate, and control sample 
areas. These plots were located along transects systematically 
spaced perpendicular 
to the long axis of the sample area. A refer- 
ence point in the center of each plot was marked with a steel stake 
1.3 m long. The same system was used when the second control 
area was established in 1974 northeast of the burn. 
Four vegetation plots were established on 2 perpendicular lines 
intersecting 
each reference point. Each plot (0.89 m*) was 7.1 m 
from the reference point. 
The use of vegetation plots established by the Fitzhugh and 
Beaulieu (unpublished) 
and Beaulieu (1975) studies allowed direct 
comparison 
and analysis of the data from each plot of the 3 
measurements. 
Because some plots had been damaged by road 
development or slash piles in 1973, only 25 plots from each sample 
area were used in the analysis. 
On two of the vegetation plots around each timber inventory 
plot, the number 
of stems of each species was counted and 
recorded. For grasses, the entire bunch was treated as one stem: 
In the previous studies, harvesting was excluded from the per- 
manent plots. In this study, all vegetation in the two plots used for 
stem count was hand-clipped 
in late July and early August, pre- 
serving 2 vegetation plots for future analysis. All vegetation was 
clipped at ground level and separated by species. The clipped 
material was oven dried at 105” C for 24 hours under forced air and 
weighed to the nearest .Ol g. Data from the 2 vegetation plots per 
reference point were combined and averaged. 
Total herbage production by species was calculated for each of 
the 25 reference points per area. These data were compared by 
analysis of variance with the data collected by Beaulieu (1975) in 
1972 and Fitzhugh and Beaulieu in 1974. This analysis determined 
the variation as a result of the passage of time and the severity of 
the burn. The analysis was designed to show if significant differen- 
ces resulted from passage of time, burn severity, or their interac- 
tion. Differences between treatment 
means were tested at .05 
confidence level by the Student-Newman-Keuls 
multiple range 
test. The mean herbage and forage weights from each sample area 
for the 3 years we compared to determine the time-related changes 
in herbage and forage production. 
Results and Discussion 
The mean herbage production for each study area in each year is 
presented in Table 1. The analysis of variance showed highly 
significant w.05) 
differences in production 
due to severity of 
burn and the passage of time. 
Annual precipitation variations complicate the interpretation 
of 
these data. Precipitation 
in the Flagstaff area for 1980 was almost 
50% above the historical average. A preliminary study by Ffolliott 
and Clary (1974) suggests linear increases in understory produc- 
tion with increasing precipitation. 
Although production 
on the 
North Control study area was not significantly higher in 1970 than 
1974, the apparent increase is suggestive of higher production in 
1980.

Production 
on the moderately burned study area was signifi- 
cantly higher in 1974 and 1980 than in 1972, but no significant 
i changes occurred between 1974 and 1980. The production on the 
moderately burned study area was also significantly greater than 
the control in 1974 or 1980. The herbage production on the moder- 
ately burned study area appears to be leveling off, and might be 
close to, or may have attained, maximum production for the study 
area for the existing overstory density. 
Although production was not significantly different between the 
moderately and severely burned study areas in 1974, the produc- 
tion on the severe burn was significantly lower than the moderate 
burn by 1980. 
While forage species accounted for over 95Yeof the total herbage 
production on the moderate burn for all 3 years of sampling, forage 
production 
on the severe burn was only 63% of total herbage 
production in 1974 and slightly over 30% in 1972 and 1980 (Table 
2). The preponderance 
of two non-forage species, bracken (Pteri- 
dium aquilinum) 
and snakeweed {Gutierrezia 
sarothrae), on the 
severely burned study area explains most of this difference. 
As in all studies of fire effects on understory vegetation, caution 
must be exercised in attributing 
changes to direct effects of burn- 
ing. Although burning affects plants directly through mortality 
and injury, understory 
vegetation on burned areas is also altered 
by greater grazing and browsing pressure caused by fire-induced 
enhancement’ in nutritional 
value of both forage and browse 
(Handley 
1969). Such increases in nutritional 
value following 
burning in southwestern ponderosa pine have been demonstrated 
by Pearson et al. (1972); increases in elk use on burned areas over 
nearby unburned areas has been documented by Lowe et al. (1978). 
In fact, elk use peaked at year 7 in the Lowe et al. study. Since our

measurements 
were taken during the ninth growing season after 
burning and our area is utilized not only by elk but also cattle and 
deer, the impact of grazing and browsing pressure on the under- 
story of our burned areas could be substantial. 
Conclusions 
Striking understory 
changes have occurred in the 9 growing 
seasons since the Rattle Burn. There has been a significant decline 
in herbage production 
on the severely burned study area since 
1974, with a striking decline in forage production. 
This pheno- 
menon was caused by increases in snakeweed and bracken on the 
severely burned site, apparently 
related in part to heavy grazing. 
Thus, caution must be used in interpreting 
production 
changes 
following burning where grazing is important. 
Production on the moderately burned study area did not decline 
in either herbage or forage production 
during the same period. 
Production 
of both forage and herbage has remained approxi- 
mately 4 times the first post-burn season’s production. 
However, 
given the wide variation 
in ponderosa 
pine understory 
response 
reported 
in the literature, any attempt to generalize about wildfire 
effects on herbage or forage production for other areas and other 
wildfire conditions 
is ill-advised.
