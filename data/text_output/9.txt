Recent projections of climate change forecast
warmer temperatures and lower precipitation
in southwestern North America (Seager et al.
2007, 2009). Severe drought has occurred in
northern Mexico since 1994 (Stahle et al. 2009),
and future drought is predicted to be more
severe than past drought (Seager et al. 2007,
2009). Climate-warming and increased drought
have the potential to influence plant growth and
range distributions for many species (Fekedulegn
et al. 2003, Adams and Kolb 2005, Breshears et
al. 2008, Kelly and Goulden 2008), because
water is currently the most limiting factor to
tree growth in most of the southwestern United
States and northern Mex ico (Fritts 1976, Swet-
nam and Betancourt 1998, Seager et al. 2009).
Ranges of some tree species are already chang-
ing due to chronic water stress that results in
higher mortality of trees at low elevations (Kelly
and Goulden 2008, McDowell et al. 2010).

GROWTH SENSITIVITY TO DROUGHT OF CO-OCCURRING PINUS SPP.
ALONG AN ELEVATION GRADIENT IN NORTHERN MEXICO
Isaac N. Bickford1, Peter Z. Fulé2,3, and Thomas E. Kolb2
ABSTRACT.—Climate change is predicted to increase the frequency of severe drought, yet little information exists on the
impacts of drought on dominant trees of Mexican pine forests, which are among the most biologically diverse forests in
the world. We conducted the first comparison of growth sensitivity to drought of two co-occurring Pinus species in Mexico to
understand whether growth of dominant pines of the Sierra Madre Occidental in northern Mexico is sensitive to drought
and temperature variation and to understand how sensitivity differs between tree species and elevations. We sampled and
analyzed tree-ring data across a 400-m elevation gradient for the years 1945–2004 for co-occurring Pinus engelmannii and
Pinus lumholtzii at Basaseachi National Park, Chihuahua, Mexico. We hypothesized that growth sensitivity to drought would
be highest at low elevations, annual basal area increment (BAI) would be lowest at low elevations, and winter precipitation
would covary positively with BAI at all elevations. Growth sensitivity to drought, as measured by a wet-dry ring-width index
ratio (W:D), was significantly higher for both species at low elevations (W:D range 2.2–2.8) than at intermediate and high
elevations (W:D range 1.5–1.9). Pinus engelmannii had significantly higher W:D (2.2) than P. lumholtzii (1.8). Annual BAI did
not differ between elevations or species. Annual ring–width index was positively and significantly associated with winter
(December–April) precipitation. This association was stronger at low elevations than at high elevations. Other seasons of
precipitation and other climatic variables were not significantly associated with annual growth. Our results suggest that the
increasing frequency and severity of drought predicted for this region in the coming decades will reduce growth of P. engel-
mannii and P. lumholtzii, with greater impacts on low-elevation populations and on P. engelmannii.
RESUMEN.—Se ha predicho que el cambio climático aumentará la frecuencia de las sequías severas, pero existe poca
información sobre el impacto de la sequía en los árboles dominantes de los bosques de pino mexicanos, que son de los
bosques con más diversidad biológica en todo el mundo. Llevamos a cabo la primera comparación de la sensibilidad a la
sequía de dos especies simpátricas de Pinus en México para saber si el crecimiento de los pinos dominantes de la Sierra
Madre Occidental en el norte de México es sensible a la sequía y a la variación en la temperatura y cómo la sensibilidad
difiere entre especies y a diversas altitudes. Muestreamos y analizamos datos de anillos de Pinus engelmannii y Pinus
lumholtzii simpátricos en el Parque Nacional Basaseachi, en Chihuahua, México, a lo largo de un gradiente altitudinal de
400 m y para los años 1945–2004. Planteamos las hipótesis de que la sensibilidad a la sequía sería mayor a baja altitud, que
el incremento del área basal (IAB) anual sería menor a baja altitud y que la precipitación invernal tendría una correlación
positiva con el IAB a cualquier altitud. La sensibilidad a la sequía, medida por el índice de la proporción del grosor de los
anillos entre temporadas húmedas y secas (H:S), fue significantemente mayor para ambas especies en altitudes bajas (H:S
entre 2.2 y 2.8) en comparación con altitudes elevadas o intermedias (H:S entre 1.5 y 1.9). Pinus engelmannii tuvo una
proporción H:S significantemente más alta (2.2) que P. lumholtzii (1.8). El IAB anual no difirió entre altitudes o especies. El
índice del grosor anual de los anillos tuvo una asociación positiva y significantiva con la precipitación invernal (de diciembre
a abril). Esta asociación fue más fuerte en las altitudes bajas que en las elevadas. El crecimiento anual no tuvo una asociación
significativa con otras temporadas de precipitación ni con otras variables climáticas. Nuestros resultados indican que el
aumento en la frecuencia y severidad de sequías que se predice para esta región en décadas venideras disminuirá el creci -
miento de P. engelmannii y P. lumholtzii, surtiendo mayores efectos sobre P. engelmannii y sobre las poblaciones de baja altitud.

PINUS SPP. GROWTH SENSITIVITY TO DROUGHT
339
Elevation gradients can be used to study
species’ responses to climate warming because
lower elevations tend to be warmer than higher
elevations at similar latitudes (Fritts 1974, Van
de Water et al. 2002, McDowell et al. 2010).
Fritts (1976) discussed Douglas’ 1914 observa-
tions that Pinus ponderosa trees at lower ele-
vations exhibited greater variability in ring
width than trees at high elevations. Adams and
Kolb (2005) used a 1500-m elevation gradient
and dendrochronological methods to compare
the growth response to regional drought and
temperature among 8 tree species in northern
Arizona. They found that sensitivity to drought
was greater for trees that occurred at low ele-
vations than for trees at high elevations and
that sensitivity to drought was greatest for
low-elevation populations within single tree
species. Kelly and Goulden (2008) surveyed
plant cover along a 2314-m elevation gradient
in southern California and found that average
elevation increased by about 65 m for the
dominant plant species over a 30-year period
(1977–2007). They speculated that the shift
in species’ ranges was predominantly caused
by changes in precipitation and temperature
rather than by other factors such as air pollu-
tion. McDowell et al. (2010) reported that a
low-elevation population of P. ponderosa in
northern New Mexico had greater growth sen-
sitivity to drought and lower annual growth
than populations at high elevations. Pinus pon-
derosa trees that recently died at low eleva-
tions had little radial growth in the years pre-
ceding death and exhibited the highest growth
sensitivity to drought. Each of these studies
showed greater impacts of regional drought on
plants at low elevations compared with plants
at high elevations.
Winter precipitation prior to a given growing
season has been strongly correlated with the
width of tree rings for that growing season,
because trees are deep-rooted organisms that
depend on moisture in deep soil layers (Fritts
1976). Winter precipitation is better able to
recharge these deep-soil moisture reserves than
precipitation in other seasons. Fritts et al. (1965)
examined relationships between climate and
ring width in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga men-
ziesii), pinyon pine (Pinus edulis), ponderosa
pine (P. ponderosa) and Utah juniper (Junipe-
rus osteosperma). For all 4 species, they found
that winter precipitation prior to the growing
season was strongly associated with annual
ring–width growth. Fritts (1965) found that sum -
mer precipitation was poorly correlated with
ring widths in western North America compared
to correlations for other seasonal precipitation
values. Adams and Kolb (2005) used tree-ring
measurements of 8 tree species in northern Ari-
zona to examine relationships between many
climatic variables and tree growth and found
that in tree populations below 3300 m above
sea level (asl), annual variation in precipitation
was more limiting to tree growth than variation
in temperature. They also found that winter pre-
cipitation prior to a growing season was gener -
ally more closely correlated with tree growth
than the precipitation of any other season. Salzer
and Kipfmueller (2005) used tree-ring series to
reconstruct precipitation and temperature for
the southern Colo rado Plateau, Arizona. They
found that annual tree growth was most strongly
correlated with precipitation from the previous
October–July of the growing season. Villanueva-
Diaz et al. (2007) used tree-ring series to recon-
struct winter and spring precipitation in north-
eastern Mexico. They found that tree earlywood
thickness depended most on precipitation from
January through June of the growing season.
Mexico is one of the most biologically
diverse countries in the world. There are 47
pine species recognized in Mexico, which con -
stitute 43% of the 110 pine species (Farjon and
Styles 1997). Approximately 32.8 million ha of
the country are covered by pine, mixed conifer/
hardwood, and hardwood forests (SEMARNAT
2002). Despite the diversity and importance of
pine species in Mexico, relatively little is
known about the impacts of drought on Mexi-
can pines. Although an exhaustive literature
review of this topic is beyond the scope of this
study, we briefly discuss 4 studies here. Diaz
et al. (2001) used tree rings of Pinus lagunae to
reconstruct September–July precipitation from
1862 to 1996 and compared that reconstruc-
tion to patterns of El Niño–Southern Oscilla-
tion (ENSO). They found that the study area
experienced a sustained drought from 1939 to
1958, and that El Niño events were associated
with above-average precipitation, while La Niña
events were associated with below-average
precipitation. Biondi (2001) developed a tree-
ring chronology for Pinus hartwegii at treeline
in Nevado de Colima. He found that summer
monsoon precipitation was the strongest den-
droclimatic signal for this species and study
area. Asbjornsen et al. (2004) studied the effects

of edge environments and drought on 5 native
tree and shrub species along a fragmentation
gradient in Oaxaca, Mexico. They found that
oak species experienced high water stress as a
result of low predawn water potential, which
prevented their successful establishment in
open areas. In contrast, shrub and pine species
had greater growth and survival success as a
result of their fast leaf turnover in drought
conditions and ability to maintain higher pre -
dawn water potentials. Figueroa-Rangel et al.
(2008) discussed the role of drought cycles in
the late Holocene expansion of pine-domi-
nated forests of west central Mexico. They
found that pine-dominated forests are the
native vegetation type in the study area, not
secondary succession derived from anthropo -
genic causes. They also found that drought
and naturally induced burning appear to be
the dominant factors that drive expansion of
pine-dominated forests. However, few or no
studies have addressed drought impacts on
pine growth in Chihuahua, a major forest region
of Mexico, where pines make up 82% of the
total annual logged timber volume (Ruelas
Monjardin and Dávalos Soteno 1999).
We studied growth responses of co-occurring
P. engelmannii and P. lumholtzii to recent envi-
ronmental variability across a 400-m elevation
gradient in western Chihuahua. We hypothe-
sized that (1) growth sensitivity to drought of
each species would be higher at low elevations
than at high elevations, (2) annual BAI would
be lower at low elevations than at high eleva-
tions, and (3) winter precipitation would covary
closely and positively with tree growth at all
elevations.
METHODS
Study Site
The study was performed in Basaseachi
National Park in the Sierra Madre Occidental
of western Chihuahua, Mexico. The study area
was centered at approximately 108.2°W, 28.2°N.
Elevations ranged from approximately 1750 m
to 2150 m asl. We believe our study area cap-
tured the entire extent of co-occuring P. engel -
mannii and P. lumholtzii in the region of
Basaseachi National Park. Pinus engelmannii
grows predominantly from 2000 to 2500 m asl,
while P. lumholtzii generally grows from 1700
to 2400 m asl (Perry 1991, Farjon and Styles
1997). Our study area encompassed the lower
half of elevation ranges for both species that
we studied. According to range maps by Perry
(1991) and Farjon and Styles (1997), our study
area was located in the northernmost extent
of the ranges of both P. engelmannii and P.
lumholtzii. Soils in the study area are classified
as Leptosols and Regosols (Cortés unpub-
lished observation) and are of volcanic origin
(Spruill 1976).
Weather stations in Mexico are widely spaced
and do not have consistent and complete records
of climate data. Climate data specific to our
study area do not exist. We acquired precipita-
tion and temperature data from 3 weather sta-
tions: Guerrero, Chihuahua (elevation 2010 m
asl, 108.517°W, 28.517°N, 47 km northwest of
the study site); Creel, Chihuahua (elevation
2300 m asl, 107.633°W, 27.75°N, 75 km south-
east of the study site); and Yécora, Sonora
(elevation 1500 m asl, 108.95°W, 28.367°N, 75
km west of the study site). These stations were
selected because they were closest to and
most similar in elevation to the study area and
had the most complete weather information
from 1945 to 2004 (ERIC II 2002). Annual
precipitation at these stations averages ap -
proximately 780 mm, of which approximately
50% falls in July and August. Another 18%
falls from December through April. Dominant
tree species include P. engelmannii Carrière,
Pinus durangensis Martínez, P. lumholtzii Rob -
inson and Fernald, and Pseudotsuga menziesii
Schwerin (Spellenberg et al. 1996). Within the
study area, we established 3 study sites based
on the co-occurrence of P. engelmannii and P.
lumholtzii over an elevation gradient (Fig. 1).
We sampled at high and intermediate eleva-
tions above Basaseachi Waterfall and at a low
elevation below it (Fig. 2).
Tree Core Samples
We collected increment cores from each of
15 P. engelmannii and P. lumholtzii trees at
each of the three sites (Fig. 2). We limited the
sample to 15 trees of each species at each ele-
vation to allow the sampling of only healthy
trees with similar canopy position. Tree size
and age were not strict criteria for tree selec-
tion, as there were insufficient individuals of
similar canopy position and health to allow strict
selection based on diameter at breast height
(dbh) and age. We sampled trees ranging in
dbh from approximately 20 to 80 cm, although
most trees ranged from approximately 30 to 40

cm in dbh. All sampled trees occupied domi-
nant or codominant canopy positions and
showed no sign of poor health or insect, light-
ning, or fire damage. We collected 2 cores from
a height of 40 cm above mineral soil from each
tree—one from the uphill side of the tree and
one perpendicular to the slope direction—using
a 5-mm-diameter increment borer (Haglof,
Sweden).
The high-elevation study site differs from the
intermediate- and low-elevation sites in slope
(Table 1). We were unable to find P. lumholtzii to
sample at the high-elevation study site except
at the top of a ridge, as P. lum holtzii generally

occurs on rocky outcrops at the top of ridges
(Farjon and Styles 1997). At the intermediate-
elevation study site, we were unable to find 15
P. engelmannii that fit our selection criteria
within a geographical area similar to that of the
low- and high-elevation study sites (Fig. 1). As a
result, the intermediate-elevation study site had
an aspect different from the other study sites
(Table 1).
We glued cores to wooden core mounts and
sanded them with increasingly fine grits of sand-
paper until the annual growth rings were clearly
visible under a microscope. We cross-dated cores
visually using narrow marker years (Stokes and
Smiley 1968) from a pine-composed ring-width
chronology for Basaseachi (Irby unpublished
data). We then measured ring widths to the
nearest 0.01 mm using an ACU-Rite Measuring
Stage (Velmex Inc., NY) and Measure J2X com-
puter software (VoorTech Consulting, Holder -
ness, NH). We checked our visual cross-dating
using COFECHA software (Grissino-Mayer
2001; software from International Tree Ring Data
Bank Program Library). Cores that did not cross-
date were excluded from further analysis.
We recorded age at a height of 40 cm for
each tree. If a core did not include the tree
pith, we used a pith locator (Applequist 1958)
to estimate age. We averaged the raw ring-
width measurements of the 2 cores from each
tree to create a single ring series for each tree.
We then standardized the series using ARSTAN
software (Cook and Krusic 2005). We used a
negative exponential model to remove age- and/or
size-related patterns in growth. We then divided
the index value in each year by the mean index
value for the series to create a residual chronol -
ogy of ring-width indices (RWI) for each tree
and for each of the 6 species-elevation combina-
tions (Fritts and Swetnam 1989). This procedure
creates a chronology with a mean value of 1.0
and a minimum value of zero. This model for
standardization preserves fine-scale climatic
variability and removes other variability from
the final chronology. No significant autocorrela-
tion remained in the residual chronology.
Climate Data and Wet-Dry Ratio Analysis
To focus on recent climate-related growth
changes, we limited our wet-dry ratio analysis to
a timespan of 60 years from 1945 to 2004. We
created a regional climate data set by averaging
precipitation and temperature in each month
for the years 1945–2004, using data from the 3
weather stations mentioned above. We desig-
nated periods of seasonal climate data based on
dominant patterns of precipitation and tempera-
ture in the regional climate data set. We defined
winter as December through April, premonsoon
as May and June, monsoon as July and August,
and fall as September through November. We
used DendroClim software (Biondi and Waikul
2004) to correlate monthly precipitation with
the residual chronologies created for each of the
6 elevation-species com binations in order to
identify which months were most highly cor-
related with tree growth. Winter precipitation
was most highly correlated with tree growth.
We summed monthly winter precipitation
values from the regional climate data set and
selected the 6 wettest and 6 driest years from
this time period for analysis (Fig. 3). We divided
the average RWI in wet years by the average
RWI in dry years for each tree to calculate the
wet-dry ratio (W:D). Higher values of this ratio
indicate higher growth sensitivity to drought
(Fekedulegn et al. 2003, Adams and Kolb
2005). The W:D data were normally distrib-
uted and had equal variance. We analyzed the
W:D data with a 2-way ANOVA with species,
elevation, and their interaction as factors, and
used Tukey’s HSD tests for mean separations.
For all analyses, statistical significance was
defined as P ≤0.05.
Basal Area Increment and
Climate–Growth Correlation
We calculated the total radial increment for
the years 1998–2007 from the annual ring
measurements from tree cores. We estimated
1998 dbh by subtracting the radial increment
for the 10-year analysis period from the tree
dbh measured in 2008. We then calculated
BAI based on the difference between estimated
basal area in 1998 and measured basal area in
2008. For these calculations, we assumed the
trees grew in circular cross sections and had
constant bark thickness from 1998 to 2007. We
also assumed that 2008 earlywood thickness
was negligible and that diameter growth at
breast height was equal to growth at 40 cm

above mineral soil. The BAI data were nor-
mally distributed and had equal variance. We
analyzed the annual BAI data with a 2-way
ANOVA with species, elevation, and their inter-
action as factors.
We calculated linear regression equations to
describe relationships between the ring-width
chronologies for the 6 elevation-species combi-
nations and precipitation, average temperature,
minimum temperature, and maximum tempera-
ture for each season (winter, premonsoon, mon-
soon, and fall) for the years 1945–2004.
RESULTS
Five of the 6 elevation-species combinations
were similar in means and ranges of tree size
and age (Table 2). Pinus engelmannii trees at
the low-elevation study site had larger average
dbh measurements and were slightly older than
trees sampled at other sites.
Of the 30 trees sampled at each elevation, 4
high-elevation trees (13%), 12 intermediate-ele-
vation trees (40%), and 14 low-elevation trees
(47%) could not be cross-dated due to frequent
missing rings. Of the 60 trees sampled from each
species, 18 P. engelmannii (30%) and 12 P. lum -
holtzii (20%) could not be cross-dated. As a
result, the final sample size used for analysis
was 13 high-elevation P. engel mannii trees, 14
high-elevation P. lumholtzii trees, 8 intermediate-
elevation P. engelman nii trees, 10 intermedi-
ate-elevation P. lum holtzii trees, 7 low-elevation
P. engelmannii trees, and 9 low-elevation P. lum -
holtzii trees.
Trees at the low-elevation site were signifi-
cantly more sensitive to drought as indicated by
their higher W:D than trees at higher elevations.
Average W:D ranged from 1.5 to 2.8 across the
6 elevation-species combinations (Fig. 4). ANOVA
showed a significant difference in W:D between
elevations (P = 0.0002) and species (P = 0.0161).
There was no sig nificant interaction between

elevation and species. The Tukey’s HSD tests
separated mean W:D at the low elevation from
the high and intermediate elevations for both
species, with the low-elevation site having signi -
ficantly higher W:D than the other 2 elevations.
Pinus engelmannii had significantly higher sen-
sitivity to drought (W:D = 2.2) than P. lumholtzii
(W:D = 1.8).
There was no significant difference in aver-
age annual BAI from 1998 to 2007 between
elevations or species, and there was no signifi-
cant interaction between elevation and species.
Annual BAI averaged over species was 88.6 cm2
(SE = 10.6) at the high elevation, 77.3 cm2 (SE =
9.6) at the intermediate elevation, and 113.9 cm2
(SE = 18.2) at the low elevation. Annual BAI
averaged over elevations was 106.7 cm2 (SE =
12.0) for P. engelmannii and 79.9 cm2 (SE = 8.7)
for P. lumholtzii.
Of the seasonal climate variables we tested,
winter precipitation was most strongly associ-
ated with annual growth (r2 ranged from 0.14
to 0.44, P ranged from 0.0000003 to 0.0044).
Maximum winter temperature had the second
highest association (r2 ranged from 0.13 to
0.25, P ranged from 0.0003 to 0.006). All other
climatic variables we tested were weakly and
nonsignificantly associated with annual growth.
RWI was positively and significantly associ-
ated with winter precipitation for 5 of the 6
elevation-species combinations (Fig. 5). The
association was nonsignificant for intermedi-
ate-elevation P. lumholtzii. Winter precipita-
tion was more strongly associated with tree
growth at low elevations than at intermediate
and high elevations. RWI was negatively and
significantly associated with maximum winter
temperature for 4 of the 6 elevation-species
combinations (Fig. 6). The association was
nonsignificant for high- and intermediate-ele-
vation P. lumholtzii. Maximum winter tempera-
ture was more strongly associated with the
growth of trees at low elevations than at inter-
mediate or high elevations. Winter precipita-
tion and maximum winter temperature were
negatively and significantly associated (r =
–0.46, r2 = 0.21, P = 0.0004).
DISCUSSION
Consistent with our first hypothesis, growth
sensitivity to drought of P. engelmannii and P.
lumholtzii in Basaseachi National Park was
higher at low elevations than at high elevations.
Our results are also consistent with well-estab-
lished dendrochronological patterns of greater
limitations of precipitation to tree growth in
low- than in high-elevation forests (Fritts 1974).
Higher temperature and lower precipitation
typical of lower elevations in northern Mexico
generally result in greater plant water stress
(Fritts 1974, Van de Water et al. 2002, McDow-
ell et al. 2010), which would increase sensitiv-
ity to drought. In all 6 elevation-species com-
binations, W:D was greater than 1.0, indicating
that drought de creased growth for all trees in
this study. The high growth sensitivity to
drought of these spe cies is consistent with
previous reports for other pine species in the
southwestern United States, such as Adams
and Kolb (2005) and McDowell et al. (2010).
Growth of P. engelmannii was more sensi-
tive to drought than growth of P. lumholtzii,
as indicated by higher W:D. This difference
may be partially caused by the greater drought
tolerance of P. lumholtzii compared with P.
engelmannii (Perry 1991). Consequently, wors-
ening drought conditions may have a more
detrimental effect on growth of P. engelmannii
than on P. lumholtzii, especially at lower eleva-
tions. The insignificant interaction between
species and elevation on W:D indicates that this
species difference was robust over elevations.
Our second hypothesis, that annual BAI
would be lower at low elevations than at higher
elevations, was rejected; recent (1998–2007) BAI
did not differ between species or elevations.
This result differs from McDowell et al.’s (2010)
report of lower BAI for low-elevation popula-
tions than high-elevation populations of P. pon-
derosa in New Mexico. Our finding of no dif-
ference in annual growth between low- and
high-elevation populations was likely due to
our exclusion of more low- and intermediate-
elevation trees than high-elevation trees from
the growth comparisons due to frequent missing
rings that prevented cross-dating. In most cases,
these excluded trees had very small rings and a
high proportion of missing rings, especially from
1998 to 2008. We suspect that if these trees
could have been cross-dated and included in the
BAI analysis, our results may have shown lower
annual growth at low elevations than high eleva-
tions, similar to McDowell et al. (2010), as more
trees were excluded at the low-elevation site
than at the high-elevation site. Furthermore, we
did not control for site productivity and other
soil properties in this study. Perhaps a careful
344

control of these factors would allow a detectable
difference in BAI between elevations.
Winter precipitation covaried positively with
tree growth at all elevations and most strongly at
low elevations, supporting our third hypothesis.
The significant and strongly negative relationship
between winter precipitation and maximum
winter temperature suggests that warm winters
tended to have lower precipitation than cool
winters. As a result, the negative relationship
between maximum winter temperature and RWI
likely occurred because warm winters had less
precipitation than cool winters. Based on our
findings that winter pre cipitation was almost

always significantly associated with tree growth
(Fig. 5), our results suggest that winter precipita-
tion is the dominant climatic factor that affects
tree growth at all elevations within our study
area. However, the low r2 values for this analy-
sis indicate that the relationships we found
offer only a weak basis for prediction. Fritts
(1976) demonstrated that winter precipitation
was most strongly correlated with earlywood
growth, while sum mer precipitation was more
strongly correlated with latewood growth. An
analysis of tree growth that separates earlywood
and latewood growth would likely result in
stronger relationships between tree growth and

precipitation than we observed in our study.
Although approximately one half of annual pre -
cipitation fell in the monsoon season at our study
area, it is probable that not all of this moisture
was available for tree growth: this moisture was
used by other plants, and higher temperatures
in the summer caused higher evaporation and
transpiration. In contrast, cooler winter tempera-
tures and slow rates of snowmelt allow moisture
to penetrate deep soil layers that are important
for tree growth because trees are deep-rooted
organisms (Fritts 1976).
Growing season temperature was not signifi-
cantly associated with interannual variation in
tree growth at any elevation we studied. Adams
and Kolb (2005) found that interannual variation
in precipitation tended to be a more limiting
factor to tree growth than temperature at eleva-
tions below 3300 m asl in northern Arizona. Our
results suggest that trees at the high-elevation
site were not above the elevation threshold at
which interannual variation in growth is more
strongly affected by temperature than by pre-
cipitation, although the specific elevation likely
differs for our study area compared with that of
Adams and Kolb’s study area due to differences
in latitude. Therefore, trees at all 3 elevations
that we studied exhibited greater sensitivity to
interannual variation in precipitation than to
variation in temperature.
Our finding of greater negative impacts of
regional drought on growth of P. engelmannii
and P. lumholtzii at low elevations than at inter-
mediate and high elevations may portend future
impacts of climate warming on these species in
the Sierra Madre Occidental of northern Mexico.
Based on our results, an increase in drought
severity and frequency caused by climate warm-
ing will decrease growth of both P. engelmannii
and P. lumholtzii in Basaseachi National Park,
with greater impacts on P. engelmannii. This
study is the first report of controls on tree
growth by climatic varia bles in this understudied
region of Mexico. A drought-induced reduction
in growth may indicate a reduction in carbon
allocation to sinks other than radial growth, such
as resin defenses against lethal bark beetle at -
tacks (Waring and Schlesinger 1985, McDowell
et al. 2007, 2008). The increase in growth sen-
sitivity to drought of these species, with future
climate warming inferred from the response of
low-elevation populations, suggests a future
surge of tree mortality similar to reports for
other pines in the southwestern United States
(Ogle et al. 2000, Breshears et al. 2005, Mc -
Dowell et al. 2010). Therefore, this study
should be considered by forest management and
conservation agencies in Mexico, as it pro-
vides infor mation on the potential impacts of
climate warming on conifers of the Sierra Madre
Occidental.
