Incentives to Overcome Barriers to Forest
Restoration

Abstract
A legacy of ﬁre suppression and the impacts of climate
change have induced a worsening pattern of large and
severe forest ﬁres across the western United States. This
has spurred action to jump-start wildﬁre risk mitigation
initiatives. Despite an increase in resources and attention,
the persistence of economic impediments has forestalled
the successful expansion of forest restoration to a land-
scape level. The failure to properly account for the full
range of costs and beneﬁts from restoration treatments
has contributed to the asymmetry between needed action
and actual implementation. The valuation of non-market
ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, along with
the ability of ecological restoration to act as an agent of
economic stimulus, should be incorporated into the poli-
cymaking process. We demonstrate how institutionalizing
the economic beneﬁts from both the process and products
of forest restoration can strengthen policies for advancing
long-term forest health.

Introduction
A century of suppressing ﬁres and the on-going effects of
climate change have altered the long-term ecological trajec-
tory of forests across the western United States (Covington
2000; Westerling et al. 2006). There has been an increase
in high-severity crown ﬁres that compromise ecological
health—causing forest cover loss and reductions in biodiver-
sity—and jeopardize the welfare of neighboring communities
(Moore et al. 1999; Allen et al. 2002; Miller et al. 2009). This
has produced a widely acknowledged need to restore regional
forest resilience (Covington 2000), but socioeconomic obsta-
cles have limited restoration efforts from achieving the scale
necessary for long-term ecosystem health and human security
(see Hjerpe et al. 2009 for a comprehensive review of social
and economic barriers to ecological restoration in the region).
Overcoming these impediments to effective policy means
clarifying for the general public and policymakers the full
range of economic contributions forest restoration can make
to human welfare. The restoration of ecosystems generates
gains in both market-based and non-market ecosystem ser-
vices realized at multiple spatial scales (e.g. Aronson et al.

2007a). In fact, it is often the case that the condition of
natural capital, such as forest ecosystems, is the limiting fac-
tor to economic development (e.g. Costanza & Daly 1992;
Aronson et al. 2006). Thus, carrying out ecological restoration
can have a substantial impact on regional economies by creat-
ing employment opportunities and raising incomes. In efforts
to improve the long-run health of ecosystems, it should be
recognized that both the process and products of restoration
yield positive economic returns.
Some argue that placing an anthropocentric value on restora-
tion may obscure the insight that ecosystems have an intrinsic
right to exist and be restored for “their own sake” (Aronson
et al. 2007b). However, many restoration ecologists argue that
restoring an ecosystem is a value-laden statement and urge
researchers and practitioners to explicitly recognize the impor-
tance of socioeconomic factors in deﬁning the goals and scope
of projects (e.g. Hobbs et al. 2004; Choi 2007; Temperton
2007). As Costanza et al. (1997) point out in their seminal
paper on the value of the world’s ecosystems, the exercise
of valuation is inherent in the process of making choices.
The restoration of natural capital can bridge important infor-
mational, ideological, and social divides presently obstructing
effective environmental policies (Aronson et al. 2010). Such
obstacles are numerous in forest systems across the United
States, and perhaps the world; overcoming them means identi-
fying where human and ecological considerations overlap and
where they do not align. Where human and ecological consid-
erations are at odds, comprehensive evaluations of trade-offs
are necessary. Where there is alignment, forest restoration

should be viewed as an investment in natural capital that
promotes both socioeconomic and environmental well-being
(Aronson et al. 2007a, 2010).
Causes and Consequences of High-Severity Fires
The Rodeo-Chediski and Hayman ﬁres of 2002, among the
largest forest ﬁres in U.S. history, burned over 245,000 ha
of forest, forced the evacuation of 13,000 people and caused
nearly $300 million of property damage, ﬁre suppression
costs, and rehabilitation expenditure (Graham 2003; Snider
et al. 2003). In the extensive ponderosa pine ecosystems of
the southwestern United States, pre-ﬁre exclusion conditions
were characterized by open forests (50–150 mature trees per
hectare) and maintained by frequent, low-severity ﬁre. Because
of a legacy of past management (namely the exclusion of sur-
face ﬁres), current forests approach 2,500 trees per hectare,
with substantial build-up of surface fuels (Cooper 1960; Cov-
ington & Moore 1994; Moore et al. 1999). Dry forests across
the western United States are characterized by similar ecolog-
ical conditions (Agee & Skinner 2005). Although over 1,700
ﬁre starts were needed to account for the 1.25 million hectares
of forests burnt in the Northern Rocky Mountains in 1910
(USDA Forest Service 1978), only three ignitions precipitated
the Rodeo-Chediski and Hayman ﬁres. This is a signiﬁcant
testament to the reduced resilience of western forests at the
landscape scale.
Barriers to Landscape-Level Restoration
Ecological restoration in the dry, ﬁre-prone forests in south-
west America primarily takes the form of mechanical thin-
ning and prescribed burning to reduce tree density and fuel
loads. For surface ﬁre-adapted forest types like ponderosa pine,
reducing tree density signiﬁcantly decreases ﬁre severity and
helps restore the structure, composition, and functions of a
healthy ecosystem (Ful´e 2008). Figure 1 shows the stark con-
trast between treated and untreated areas after the occurrence
of wildﬁre. Despite the demonstrated efﬁcacy of restoration
in mitigating high-severity ﬁre risk, contemporary initiatives
have failed to achieve landscape-level success. Three primary
obstacles underlay this asymmetry between science and policy:
(1) public misconceptions regarding the meaning and purpose
of forest restoration; (2) failure to account for non-market
ecosystem services; and (3) insufﬁcient funding for treatment
initiatives (Hjerpe et al. 2009).
In the recent past, agenda-driven parties (from commer-
cial interests to environmental activists) have often created
public misconceptions by playing off of distaste for tree
removal and intentional ﬁres (Covington 2000). Encourag-
ingly, recent studies indicate that support for restoration initia-
tives is increasing among community stakeholders, due in large
part to public education and outreach from local researchers
and the U.S. Forest Service (Abrams & Lowe 2005; Oster-
gren et al. 2008). However, the ﬁnancial burden of expand-
ing restoration remains a more intransigent issue. Costs of
restoration treatments vary, but across the western United
States, the combined per-hectare expenditure for mechani-
cal thinning, prescribed burning, and administrative overhead
averages US$2,000 for basic-level restoration (Hjerpe & Kim
2008; Prestemon et al. 2008; Rummer 2008; Hjerpe et al.
2009). This value represents a conservative estimate; when
additional criteria such as habitat provision for the Mexican
Spotted Owl (a Federally listed endangered species) are added,
the costs are appreciably higher. When applied to the landscape
scale (i.e. hundreds of thousands to millions of hectares), the
ﬁnal cost of restoring forest resilience resides in the billion
dollars. In the ﬁre-prone forests of the western United States,
these staggering prices constitute the most prevalently cited
barrier to restoration efforts (Government Accounting Ofﬁce
2005a, 2005b; USDA Forest Service 2003). When set against
international standards (where treatments vary depending on
ecosystem type and condition), these values represent a low-
end estimate for forest restoration costs (Neßh¨over et al. 2011).
The restoration of tropical forests in Brazil (which entails
reforestation), for instance, can exceed an expense of over
$5,000 per hectare (Rodrigues et al. in press).
Unaccounted Beneﬁts and Unforeseen Costs
Recognizing ecosystems as productive assets that gener-
ate numerous non-accounted ecosystem services can elevate
the appeal of restoring dry forests and attract much-needed
funding. Forests such as ponderosa pine provide numerous
beneﬁts, including aesthetic and recreational opportunities,

erosion prevention, and microclimatic regulation (Frederici
2003). Restored forests enhance the value of surrounding real
estate while making the region more attractive to high-quality
labor (Kim & Wells 2005). A resilient forest ecosystem also
provides the beneﬁt of “insurance” from disturbances such
as wildﬁre (Stephens et al. 2010). The combined economic
value of this natural insurance along with a partial calcula-
tion of other services has been estimated at $3,500 per hectare
(Mason et al. 2006). Many of these ecosystem beneﬁts are
left unaccounted by market valuation and their absence in pol-
icy undermines efforts to expand restoration (Kline 2004). As
studies show, it is often much more cost-efﬁcient to restore
fractured ecosystem services than to invest in man-made alter-
natives (Chichilnisky & Heal 1998).
Perhaps, one of the most signiﬁcant ecosystem services
enhanced by ecological restoration in dry, ﬁre-prone forests is
carbon stabilization (Hurteau & Brooks 2011). High-severity
ﬁres release substantial quantities of carbon emissions (ranging
from 22 to 103 Tg CO2 between 2001 and 2008; Wiedinmyer
& Hurteau 2010), undermining the role forests play in climate
change mitigation. In the 2002 ﬁre season alone, forest ﬁres
burning in the western United States (including the Rodeo-
Chediski and Hayman ﬁres) released approximately 24 Tg of
CO2 equivalent (Hurteau et al. 2008; Wiedinmyer & Hurteau
2010). Imputing the social cost of carbon emissions has been
a controversial issue and estimates vary depending on how
time is discounted. Projections can be as low as $9.55 per
metric ton of CO2 (Nordhaus 2007), owing to the value of
present consumption being substantially weighted over the
well-being of future generations. A major report by a group
of economists led by Nicholas Stern, however, advocates the
high-end price of $84.55 per metric ton of CO2 (Stern 2007),
premised by the belief that climate change must be more
urgently addressed by contemporary policy. However, in the
absence of a national carbon emissions program such as cap-
and-trade in the United States, the market-recognized value of
limiting carbon emissions hovers in the lower bound of current
estimates.
Although human intervention has increased the overall
carbon storage in many ﬁre-prone temperate forests because
of higher tree density, these systems may have exceeded
their carbon-carrying capacity (Keith et al. 2009; Hurteau
et al. 2010). The resultant instability means that restoration
treatments, despite decreasing overall forest biomass (at a
cost of 17.7–32.6 Mg C per hectare in ponderosa pine forest;
Hurteau et al. 2010), produce a net carbon reduction relative
to the expected value of emissions from high-severity ﬁres
(Finkral & Evans 2008; Hurteau & North 2009; Wiedinmyer
& Hurteau 2010). In untreated forests, carbon costs from
wildﬁres can continue to accrue into the future because high
rates of mortality inﬂuence net ecosystem productivity (Dore
et al. 2008; Meigs et al. 2009). Carbon losses from restoration
treatments, on the other hand, are much more transient
(Dore et al. 2010; Hurteau & North 2010). In addition,
the potential exists for vegetation type conversion following
wildﬁre, in which large amounts of the carbon stock are lost
in the transition from a forest to a grass/shrub-dominated
landscape (Savage & Mast 2005). Establishing a carbon
baseline that accounts for the amortized probability of forest
ﬁres is essential in developing a sustainable carbon market.
By institutionalizing the incentives of carbon sequestration,
a stronger economic rationale can be made for expanding
restoration treatments.
‘‘Green’’ Economic Stimulus
Forest restoration can also act as an agent of economic
stimulus (Aronson et al. 2007a; Blignaut et al. 2008). The
economic impacts from restoration activities in parts of
Arizona and New Mexico (which have only been implemented
on a small fraction of the land identiﬁed for treatment)
generated over $40 million and 500 jobs in the ﬁscal year
2005 (Hjerpe & Kim 2008)—a signiﬁcant boon for a region
containing several of the poorest counties in the United States.
The estimated multiplier effects (the economic “bang for
the buck” of every dollar spent) from these activities were
substantially higher than the projected impact of tax cuts (0.99)
and in line with those of government outlays (1.57) from
the Obama administration’s economic stimulus (Romer &
Bernstein 2009). With infrastructure improvements, it is likely
that economic gains from forest restoration would be even
higher (USDA Forest Service 2003). As a result of changes
in federal land management in the past two decades, however,
much of the timber industry infrastructure in the region has
been dismantled (Fight et al. 2004; Morgan et al. 2006). In
addition, aspects of national forest management create a wood
supply that is too inconsistent for the business practices of
many potential processors (Hjerpe et al. 2009).
Encouraging the growth of corroborative industries can
generate self-reinforcing incentives for forest restoration. The
ﬁrst large-scale project area (ca. 304,000 ha) arising from
the collaborative 4 Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI) in
Arizona is expected to generate over 6,700 jobs (Kim 2010).
In the midst of a protracted economic malaise (like the one
currently being experienced), there is immense potential to
dovetail urgent policy goals such as income and employment
creation with forest restoration objectives. Future cross-sector
collaborations such as 4FRI could be planned as public works
that promote jobs and income in rural forested communities.
The establishment of the Civilian Conservation Corps during
the Great Depression and the Working for Water program in
South Africa offer instructive examples. Ecological restoration
can also lay the foundation for emerging industries while
balancing environmental concerns, contributing further to
the long-run economic sustainability of regional economies
(Blignaut et al. 2008).
Conclusions
The way we manage (or mismanage) ecosystems has sig-
niﬁcant economic consequences. Thus, it is instructive for
both scientiﬁc understanding and policy to view them as nat-
ural capital, the restoration of which can enhance societal

well-being as a function of improved economic returns (Aron-
son et al. 2007b). It is clear that the gains from forest
restoration, as well as the potential costs of high-severity
wildﬁres, vastly outweigh the requisite expenditure necessary
for landscape-level implementation. The need for action is
highlighted by the fact that rising temperatures have increased
the frequency, duration, and burned area of forest ﬁres (West-
erling et al. 2006). As climate change continues apace, so
will the threat posed by high-severity wildﬁres (Westerling
& Bryant 2008). Without large-scale intervention, trends sug-
gest that current patterns will persist, if not worsen (Covington
2000). Although it is important to have a rigorous understand-
ing of underlying ecological processes (Palmer & Filoso 2009),
it is also essential to incorporate economic incentives that may
abet the expansion of restoration efforts. The recognition of
this latter, pragmatic dimension of restoration is especially
important when dealing with severely degraded ecosystems
(Aronson & Le Floc’h 2000). The Collaborative Forest Land-
scape Restoration Program established by the U.S. Congress
in 2009, for example, represents an important step toward
building an economically sustainable foundation for expanding
restoration. However, additional efforts to institutionalize the
economic beneﬁts from both the process and products of forest
restoration are needed to achieve landscape-level results.
Implications for Practice
• Accounting for the economic beneﬁts of both market
and non-market ecosystem services such as wildﬁre
insurance, carbon sequestration, and real estate value
can strengthen the rationale for forest restoration in
policymaking and attract much-needed funding.
• FRIs can act as a regional economic stimulus for
forested communities. Restoration projects arising from
collaborations among researchers, the government, and
the private sector can enhance employment opportunities
and income.
• Calibrating regional infrastructure to forest restoration
products such as thinned wood and an enhanced aesthetic
landscape can promote long-term economic viability by
nurturing emerging industries and markets.
