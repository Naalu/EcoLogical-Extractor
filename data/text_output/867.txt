This special session will mark the first opportunity for Colorado Plateau cave researchers and 
land managers to meet in a forum where they can share their research and ideas, discuss 
management issues, and identify research needs.  In light of this great opportunity, we also will 
hold a breakout session either the day before or after the special session.  The objective of the 
breakout session will be to identify key resource management issues facing Colorado Plateau 
caves, discuss site-specific management concerns, identify research needs, and begin to 
strategize how these issues and concerns may be addressed.

Vegetation classification systems provide a framework for defining resources and assessing their status and trends.  Conversely, monitoring 
and mapping efforts can be used to evaluate a vegetation classification system’s operational utility.  The classification schemes most 
commonly used to describe Colorado Plateau rangelands, including SRM Range Cover Types, NRCS Ecological Site Descriptions, BLM 
Ecological Site Inventories, and NVC Ecological Systems, Alliances, and Associations, are all based on a priori concepts of how rangeland 
communities are organized.  Although these systems differ in detail, they are all similar in that they force the user to impose a pre-defined 
pattern onto natural landscape variation.  During the course of the Southwest Regional GAP Analysis Program (SWReGAP) vegetation 
mapping process, we encountered a number of problems associated with this pattern-forcing process, such as “missing” plant communities 
and “garbage-can” types.  This experience encouraged us to investigate the opposite approach to vegetation classification, i.e., develop a 
strictly empirical classification system based on statistical patterns inherent to the data.  To achieve this objective, we applied a variety of 
multivariate clustering techniques to the field training data collected for the SWReGAP and Landfire mapping projects.  We created alternative 
datasets to address concerns typical of vegetation classification systems in general (e.g., dominant species vs. whole communities) and 
specific to the Colorado Plateau (e.g., include or exclude substrate measures).  Not surprisingly, the classes that emerged from our analysis 
share much in common with existing schemes, and particularly with the NVC.  However, these classes also suggest new ways for resolving 
problems associated with defining plant communities, particularly those associated with information content.  While our application of 
sophisticated multivariate models to relatively unsophisticated monitoring data led to many problems, these problems highlight critical, but 
often overlooked, aspects of long-term, large-area monitoring projects.  We anticipate that our efforts will also lead to better maps, and 
perhaps even change the way that we look at rangelands in the arid West.

Orconectes virilis is invading Fossil Creek, Arizona, a stream that had undergone two restoration events by 2005: non-native fish removal and 
flow restoration from the decommissioning of a century old hydropower dam. We combined crayfish surveys with an enclosure-exclosure 
experiment in the summers before and after restoration events to predict how the crayfish population structure would respond to restoration 
and how changes in density mediated effects could impact the stream community.  Preliminary trapping and mark-recapture surveys were 
conducted two summers prior to restoration at 10 sites along the length of the creek. These surveys indicated that the crayfish population was 
most abundant at downstream sites toward the confluence with the Verde River, with densities decreasing upstream. The greatest densities 
were found to be located downstream of the area in which a fish barrier was installed during restoration events to prevent upward migration of 
non-native fish from the Verde River.  In the summer of 2005, after the restoration treatments, a mark-recapture survey at sites above the fish 
barrier revealed a two-fold increase in crayfish population densities. At two sites below the fish barrier, in areas of the creek that were still 
accessible to non-native fish, there was also an increase in density levels, but the magnitude of the increase was not doubled.  Prior to 
restoration, a set of enclosure-exclosure experiments was conducted at two sites in the stream, one below and one above the future fish 
barrier. These experiments tested the effect of two different densities of crayfish on algal production, allochthonous matter processing, and 
invertebrate abundance and biomass. There were significant differences in the response variables between high and low density treatments, 
with high densities having large negative effects on the responses. While low density treatments showed similar trends in the responses, they 
were not significantly different than controls, showing that pre-restoration levels of the crayfish population were probably not having large 
negative effects on the stream community. The experiment is being re-tested at post-restoration population levels.   
 
 
SFPWMA: PARTNERS IN INVASIVE WEED STRATEGIES

Invasive and noxious weeds are spreading at an exponential rate in northern Arizona.  Tight budgets and diminishing personnel have led land 
managers into creative solutions to combating weeds and restoring landscapes.   Education efforts provide outreach to schools and 
homeowner associations to ensure prevention and early detection, but within our communities, there is largely uninformed audience on this 
issue.  The San Francisco Peaks Weed Management Area (SFPWMA) brings together those concerned about responsible weed management 
within Northern Arizona to build local awareness of invasive weeds, develop common management objectives, facilitate effective treatment, 
and coordinate efforts along logical geographical boundaries with similar land types, patterns and problem species.  This will allow partners to 
respond more effectively to community and ecological concerns.

Cottonwoods are dominant riparian trees that form habitat for numerous arthropod species. Cottonwoods also form hybrid zones consisting of 
different cross types, which appear to attract different assemblages of arthropods.  In this study we examine the utility of genetic markers for: 
(1) discriminating among different hybrid and parental cross types; (2) assessing whether genetic differences reflect arthropod community 
preference for particular cross types and; (3) understanding the role genetic variation in a dominant riparian tree plays in determining 
arthropod community diversity and structure.  Our results suggest that genetic differences among cross types are detectable and that a subset 
of the arthropod community is responding to the genetic composition of the hybrid zones.  These findings suggest that genetic variation in 
cottonwood hybrid zones can play a critical role in the formation, structure and long-term stability of riparian-based herbivore communities.

In Arizona’s ponderosa pine forests, bark beetles play an important role as native tree pests that help to stimulate snag recruitment. Since 
2001, bark beetle activity has caused unprecedented levels of ponderosa pine mortality in central and northern Arizona. For example, it is 
estimated that during 2002 more than one million trees were killed by bark beetle activity. Because of this record high tree mortality, it is 
essential to develop a better understanding of the population structure of bark beetle species in order to address questions of their dispersal 
and movement across the landscape. Here, we describe the use of genetic techniques to investigate the population structure of three bark 
beetle species collected from multiple sites along an elevation gradient in Arizona ponderosa pine forests. We have developed novel genetic 
markers that distinguish among and within populations of Dendroctonus brevicomis, D. frontalis, and Ips pini. For designations among the 
species, we utilized a region of DNA considered as the “barcode of life” - the cytochrome oxidase I gene. This locus is commonly used to 
identify eukaryotic organisms at the species level. To resolve genetic variation within each species, we utilized fluorescently-labeled Amplified 
Fragment Length Polymorphisms, or fAFLPs. This technique uses polymorphisms present throughout the genome of an organism to generate 
high-resolution genetic fingerprints suitable for population level analyses. We generated genetic fingerprints for more than 150 individuals from 
each of the three species and calculated genetic distances within each species set. For all species, genetic distance was not correlated with 
geographic distance or elevation, which suggests there is great dispersal throughout the study area. This further suggests that future 
outbreaks may occur at regional rather than local scales because of the beetles’ ability to disperse over large distances. We believe that the 
genetic markers developed in this study will assist future efforts to further understand bark beetle dispersal through time in the ponderosa pine 
forests of Arizona, as well as the rest of the Colorado Plateau region.   
 
 
THE IMPACTS OF SAGEBRUSH ECOTYPE TREATMENTS ON THE PYGMY RABBIT AND OTHER WILDLIFE

Impaired sagebrush ecosystems are a dilemma facing managers across the Western US. These ecosystems are being treated to either (a) 
create functioning habitats for species such as Sage-grouse and mule deer or (b) increase livestock forage production. However, current data 
are incomplete on the impacts of treatments on state sensitive species and federally petitioned species. Such data require pre-treatment and 
post-treatment monitoring at multiple scales and with multiple species. In Utah, well-meaning treatments of sagebrush habitat include: 
federally funded wildfire fuel reduction operations; sagebrush canopy reductions; and combinations of objectives that remove most or all of the 
sagebrush canopy and replace this with grasses, forbs and even shrubs favored by mule deer, elk, domestic sheep and domestic cattle.  In 
agreement with Utah=s AWildlife Habitat Initiative@, the primary focus of our study is the maintenance of critical pygmy rabbit (Brachylagus 
idahoensis) habitat, restoration of habitats to establish meta-population connectivity, and the identification of habitat perturbations that have a 
positive effect on pygmy rabbit populations. Additionally species composition and abundance of bird and jackrabbit populations are recorded 
using line transects. These data will assist in the development of creating guidelines for sagebrush manipulations with multiple species 
considerations.

We investigated the effects of off-road vehicle (ORV) use on the abundance and diversity of plant and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AM) 
communities in a riparian ecosystem. This is important because ORV use in riparian habitats is increasing rapidly, and riparian habitat is rare 
and ecologically valuable in the arid southwest. In addition, there is a need to determine management implications for ORV use to limit 
damage to plant and AM fungal communities.  Our research design allowed us to compare direct disturbance (on ORV tracks) with 
intermediate disturbance (1m from the tracks) and no disturbance (12m away from the tracks). Six significant patterns emerged: 1. Soil 
compaction and density were 4.3x greater on the ORV track and 1.4x greater 1m away than compared with the 12m transects.  2. Plant cover 
was 10x lower on ORV tracks than 1m away and 14.8x lower on ORV tracks than 12m away. 3. Plant species richness was 5.4x lower on 
ORV tracks than one meter away and 7.8x lower on ORV tracks than 12m away, and plant cover was negatively correlated with soil 
compaction.  4. AM spore abundance was 1.4x lower on the track than 1m from the track and 1.9x lower than 12m from a track. 5. AM 
richness was 1.2x lower on a track compared to 1m from a track and 2.6x lower compared to 12m from a track. 6. AM abundance and 
richness were both positively correlated with plant abundance and diversity, while AM abundance was negatively correlated with soil 
compaction and bare ground. We conclude that unmanaged ORV disturbance increases selection pressures in which plant and mycorrhizal 
communities suffer reduced fitness and abundance. The magnitude of our findings illustrates that managing these anthropogenic disturbances 
is necessary to restore ecosystem processes. 
 
 
CONDUCTING A RAPID LANDSCAPE-SCALE ECOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE KANE AND TWO MILE RANCHES IN NORTHERN 
ARIZONA

The Grand Canyon Trust and The Conservation Fund are jointly purchasing the Kane and Two Mile ranches, whose livestock grazing permits 
extend across nearly 850,000 acres north of the Grand Canyon.  In purchasing the ranches, we plan to work with land managers and a 
diverse array of stakeholders over the coming years to identify and implement restoration projects across a diverse array of ecosystems, and 
manage livestock in a manner consistent with restoration and maintenance of ecological and scenic integrity. Recognizing the need to better 
understand current conditions across the ranches, and to establish a baseline from which the effects of livestock management and restoration 
activities could be measured, we initiated a landscape-scale ecological assessment of the ranches in the spring of 2005.  Thus far, we have 
focused field data collection efforts on assessing rangeland, forest, and water resource conditions across the ranches.  For the rangeland 
portion of the assessment (encompassing the entire project area) we have used a stratified random sample design to conduct vegetation and 
soil surveys at approximately 650 plot locations.  For the forested portion of the project area, we are coordinating a volunteer-centered forest 
overstory data collection effort at more than 200 sites.  Collaborating with the Forest Ecosystem Restoration Analysis project at NAU, we will 
combine overstory data collected with Landsat ETM and digital orthophoto quads to develop continuous, high resolution maps describing 
forest composition and structure, wildlife habitat, and watersheds conditions across the Kaibab Plateau.  We are collaborating with the Grand 
Canyon Wildlands Council to strategically assess water resources, including springs, streams, natural lakes across the project area.  
Synthesis of field data in combination with extensive review of studies and management plans already conducted will help the Trust to develop 
a scientifically rigorous and effective strategy for adaptively managing livestock and pursuing restoration goals.  Assessment methodologies, 
preliminary results of data synthesis, and implications for livestock management and restoration strategies across the ranches will be 
presented.

Many contemporary forests of North America, and particularly in the West, have high fuel loads after a century or more of grazing and active 
fire suppression.  Such forest conditions promote stand-replacing wildfires where frequent surface fires were the norm.  Land managers are 
now struggling with precisely how to treat these forests to reduce future wildfire risk and restore appropriate structure, particularly in the 
wildland-urban interface.  Proposed solutions include various forms of mechanical thinning and prescribed fire, alone and in combination.  
There is, however, uncertainty surrounding the separate and combined effects of these silvicultural treatments on long-term productivity and 
ecological function in these forests, and the degree of fire hazard reduction actually provided.  In 2000, the national Joint Fire Sciences 
Program funded a 13-region study to address ecological effects, economical impacts, and fire hazard reduction of these different alternatives 
that included: 1) a common set of replicated treatments in each region; 2) large experimental plots of a size similar to typical stand 
management units; 3) a shared suite of measurements that are used to evaluate treatment effects; and 4) data archival in a national database 
for meta-analyses.  In this presentation, we will provide some details on the national study and what we have learned, describe the treatment 
and establishment details of our local replicate here in the Flagstaff area, and report the short-term response of the overstory trees to the 
treatments.  Our replicate includes three ponderosa pine stands where four treatments were applied: a cool-season prescribed fire alone, 
mechanical thinning alone in the form of a multi-aged group selection harvest, the same mechanical harvest followed by prescribed fire, and 
an untreated control.  Harvest damage to overstory trees was surprising low throughout the study. Tree mortality from crown scorching was 
also surprising low in the prescribed fire only treatment, higher in the harvest and burn treatment given differences in fire behavior.  Resulting 
diameter distributions show a major alteration in forest structure with mechanical harvest, but little change with the first prescribed fire entry.

Long-term vegetation studies can provide valuable insights into ecosystem structure and function.  Many such studies have been conducted in 
northern Arizona, though their full potential has not been utilized.  Examples include the Woolsey plots, Hill plots, Chimney Spring interval 
burning study, Gus Pearson Natural Area restoration experiment, Taylor Woods thinning study, and Fort Valley ponderosa pine provenance 
trial.  In our research on the Woolsey and Hill plots, we begin by locating historical data in archives, agency files, herbaria, and other locations.  
Data quality is assessed by examining its quantity, the intent for which it was collected, and the methodology employed for locating sites and 
sampling units.  Field sites are then relocated and assessed for ecological integrity and vegetation change.  Site histories can be strengthened 
by examining historical photos, reviewing agency files, and interviewing scientists that worked there historically.  The research objectives of a 
new study, which may differ from those of the historical study, will determine how historical data are used and which contemporary 
measurements are made.  If historical and contemporary data are to be compared, it is necessary to carefully duplicate the historical sampling 
methods.  The scope of inference can be established by assessing the representativeness of study sites.  Limitations of long-term studies 
include their rarity, the low number of replications generally established, and the costs of maintaining sites and preserving data in accessible 
formats.  Long-term maintenance and protection of sites requires the active cooperation of land management agencies, who may be unaware 
of their existence or importance, by incorporating them into their GIS layers and planning.  Education of the public can minimize vandalism and 
build support for projects.  Historical and contemporary data should be properly archived and documented to ensure their availability to future 
scientists.  While long-term studies require additional effort compared to temporary, short-term studies, they can generated surprising and 
unique results, as described in the following presentation. 
 
 
BIOLOGICAL CRUSTS AND THE PUSUIT OF NOVEL FUNGAL DIVERSITY 
 
BATES, SCOTT T. 
School of Life Sciences, Arizona State University, Main Campus, Tempe, AZ  85287-4501 
 
A range of estimates from 500,000 to 9.9 million for the total number of fungal species present in the earth’s biosphere have been put forward.  
The sum of fungi that have been described at the species level thus far range between 74,000 and 120,000.  The realization that as little as a 
tenth of a percent of the world’s fungal species may have been described compels the mycologist to probe unexplored niches in the quest to 
uncover novel fungal diversity.  The paucity of literature addressing fungi associated with biological soil crust (BSCs) suggests that this niche 
is ripe for investigation.  While culture dependent methodologies have limited our ability to access fungal diversity in the past, recent advances 
in molecular biology hold promise as a mean to recover novel fungal diversity in BSCs.  Understanding what fungal organisms are associated 
with BSCs is the first step toward understanding the ecological role that fungi play in the crust community.

Future climate changes will affect soil moisture regimes through increased temperature and the alteration of precipitation regimes. These 
effects will be especially pronounced in deserts, as soils are generally young, with low water-holding capacity. Biological soil crusts can be 
important components in these ecosystems. Because they are only metabolically active when wet, they are at high risk to any changes in soil 
moisture. We altered precipitation regimes for crusts from winter rainfall deserts. In SE Utah, altered  
precipitation frequency (but not amount) during summer months resulted in the reduction of fluoresence, pigment production, biomass, and N-
fixation in both cyanobacteria and the lichen Collema. However, these negative effects were much more pronounced in the lichen than the 
cyanobacteria. In a second SE Utah experiment with Collema, altered precipitation frequency again depressed fluoresence, but this time 
favored N fixation. In a experiment in southern Nevada, increasing summer precipitation decreased lichen cover dominated by Collema and 
Placidium, while cyanobacterial biomass and fluoresence increased.  In addition, it also reduced moss performance. These results indicate 
that increased frequency or amount of summer precipitation is likely to favor cyanobacteria over lichens, resulting in biological soil crusts that 
appear more like those found in deserts whose precipitation regimes are dominated by summer rain than those dominated by winter rain. 
Such a shift will result in species that contribute less to soil stability and fertility than those species currently present.

Finding factors that predict the invasion of exotic plants has long been a goal of many research efforts. Based on our observation that the 
invasion of annual grass into western US rangelands often occurs in a patchy manner, we investigated the effect of various site factors on the 
presence and absence of these plants. We surveyed 432 sites in the Chihuahuan, Mojave, Colorado Plateau, and Great Basin deserts, 
assessing site variables such as plant cover, ground cover, slope, aspect, elevation and soil characteristics including chemistry, texture, pH, 
and cation exchange capacity. Our results show that within a given climate region, soil characteristics are different between uninvaded and 
invaded patches. Invaded patches in regions with lower precipitation during times of lower air temperatures (winter, in this case) had higher 
available phosphorus than uninvaded patches.  As winter precipitation increased, available phosphorus was no longer the sole predictor of 
annual grass cover, as potassium and maganese became important as well. Soil depth was important in areas with shallow soils, and texture 
played a role in some regions as well.  Because soil texture and nutrients can be mapped, sites susceptible to annual plant invasions can also 
be mapped. Because the limiting nutrient is at least partially controlled by climate, the distribution of annual grasses is expected to change in 
the future as temperatures increase and precipitation patterns are altered.

Biological Soil Crusts (BSC) are nowadays widely spread around the world, and the knowledge of their rol in arid ecosystems has improved 
significantly in the last decades; however, nothing is known about their origins and evolution throughout the history of the Earth. As 
cyanobacteria being a very ancient microbial group and the main biotic components of modern BSC, it is possible that they formed BSC-like 
communities in the early continents, way before of their colonization by plants. In that sense, the physical, chemical, and biological features 
exhibit by modern BSC could be characterized in order to recognize them in the rock record. From those characterizations and lab 
experiments, also the biotic and abiotic processes involved in the development of BSC can be known, leading to a better understanding of the 
extant BSC existence and their fate.

In 2004, four western cavers purchased the property containing Cathedral Caves of Northern Arizona.  Once purchased, this became one of 
the few, if only, private, and caver owned speleological preserves in the west.  The caves on the property have suffered from decades of 
overuse, vandalism, and neglect.  Cathedral and its sister, Indian Cave, were popular haunts along Route 66 for many years to the 
adventurers and tourists.  Unfortunately, a heavy toll was paid for years of uncontrolled visitation. Graffiti, stripping of formations, and even the 
killing of bats has been documented.  There has never been any successful management in place over that last 100 years of casual visitation 
until now.  To our surprise, we found the cave resources were much greater than expected.  We proposed a basic management plan and 
efforts to secure the caves were quickly put in place.  Although vandalism was extensive, many beautiful formations and passages remained 
and the cave still contains significant biological, archeological and paleontological resources.   I will discuss these resources within Cathedral 
Caves, what we have learned through privately managing these caves and their resources, and the caves, much brighter future. 
 
 
BIOLOGICAL SOIL CRUST RESTORATION IN THEORY AND PRACTICE: AN UNDEREXPLOITED OPPORTUNITY? 
 
BOWKER, MATTHEW A. 
Department of Biological Sciences, Northern Arizona University, Box 5640, Flagstaff, Arizona, 86011, mab86@dana.ucc.nau.edu 
 
Biological soil crusts (BSCs) are a ubiquitous community type of cryptogams and microorganisms which are critical structural and functional 
components of many ecosystems. Most ecosystems of the world have these communities either as a successional sere (wetter, closed-
canopied systems), or as a permanent feature (dryer, open-canopied systems).  Despite their ubiquity and importance BSCs rarely are 
addressed in the restoration literature. In succession, most evidence supports that BSCs play a facilitative role for later seres, suggesting that 
assisted recovery of BSCs could speed succession. In arid – subhumid systems, loss of BSCs may be synonymous with crossing degradation 
thresholds because they are ecosystem engineers and strongly contribute to several vital ecosystem attributes. However, assisted recovery of 
BSCs may allow a transition from a degraded steady state to a more desired alternative steady state. In practice, BSC restoration has three 
major components: 1) establishment of reference conditions, 2) selection and integration of techniques, and 3) monitoring. Whenever possible, 
I advocate statistical modeling of reference conditions based upon surveys of numerous contemporary areas which have not undergone 
strong disturbance impacts. Restorationists may choose techniques that attempt to correct (in decreasing order of difficulty) active soil erosion, 
resource deficiencies, or BSC propagule scarcity. Success is likely to be contingent upon prior evaluation of site condition and identification of 
likely constraints to natural BSC reestablishment. Because BSC restoration may be long term, monitoring techniques must be chosen that can 
be implemented by non-experts and by multiple observers. I advocate a combined strategy including a measure of abundance and functional 
diversity (e.g. cover by functional group), a measure of biomass (e.g. chlorophyll a), and a measure of function (e.g. soil aggregation). The 
strong influence that BSCs exert upon ecosystems is an underexploited opportunity for restorationists to return disturbed ecosystems to a 

 
31 
desirable trajectory.  Proper attainment of this goal entails an understanding of the theoretical role of BSCs in a given system, and a 
conceptual framework for identifying a course of action.

USER DISCRETIONARY TIME:  A MODEL TO ESTIMATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR VISITOR EXPERIENCE 
 
BOWMAN, CARL B.

User Discretionary Time (UDT) was developed at Grand Canyon National Park to measure visitors’ “free time” on Colorado River rafting trips.  
This measurement augmented more traditional use level measurements (such as user-days) for the Colorado River Management Plan 
Environmental Impact Statement’s alternative analysis.  The UDT model factors in the amount of daylight throughout the year that is available 
for visitor activities.  Mandatory visitor activities   (e.g., eating, traveling  downriver)  on  a  “typical” Colorado  River  trip  were  then identified, 
and subtracted from the total  daylight  available  in  half-month  intervals.  The remaining “free time” is considered discretionary time for 
visitors to spend as they personally wish.  The UDT results were used to provide some insight into visitor experience, and visitor opportunities 
to engage in activities beyond the essential tasks of a camping/rafting trip through the Grand Canyon.  Values and limitations of this type of 
measurement are discussed.

Prescribed fire is increasingly used as a tool to restore southwest ponderosa pine forests to pre-settlement conditions, improve forest health, 
and to reduce risk of large stand-replacing wildfire. Possible undesirable effects of prescribed fire include increased bark beetle activity and 
unacceptable levels of tree mortality. We present data from the first year of a 3-year study on effects of prescribed fire on ponderosa pine 
mortality and bark beetle colonization. Our research is part of the Birds and Burns Network, a large-scale cooperative study of effects of fire on 
bird populations (www.rmrs.nau.edu/lab/4251/birdsnburns/index.shtml).  We sampled four sites in Arizona and New Mexico that were treated 
with prescribed fire during fall 2003 and winter/early spring 2004. Each site is 250-400 hectares in size and is paired with an unburned control 
site of similar size and stand characteristics. We measured fire damage and bark beetle presence on nearly 2500 ponderosa pine trees. While 
the numbers of bark beetle attacks were low on both burned and unburned sites, more attacks occurred on burned sites than unburned sites. 
By sampling for beetle activity at different heights along the bole, we found Dendroctonus species to attack mostly mid-bole (3-5 meters) and 
Ips species to attack mostly the upper bole (5-7 meters), indicating possible resource partitioning. The amount of tree crown damage by fire is 
a good indicator of probability of bark beetle attack: most bark beetle attacks occurred on trees with greater amounts of crown damage. This 
study will provide insight into how we can use prescribed fire effectively while keeping tree mortality levels reasonable for management goals 
and keeping bark beetle populations endemic by improving forest health.

Future drought is projected to occur under warmer temperature conditions as climate change progresses—referred to here as global-change 
type drought—yet quantitative assessments of the triggers and potential extent of drought-induced vegetation die-off remain pivotal 
uncertainties in assessing climate change impacts.  Of particular concern is regional-scale mortality of overstory trees, which rapidly alters 
ecosystem type, associated ecosystem properties, and land surface conditions for decades. Here we quantify regional-scale vegetation die-off 
across southwestern North American woodlands in 2002-2003 in response to drought and associated bark beetle infestations.  At an 
intensively studied site within the region, we quantified that following fifteen months of depleted soil water content, more than 90% of the 
dominant, overstory tree species (Pinus edulis—a piñon) died.  The die-off was reflected in changes in a remotely sensed index of vegetation 
greenness (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), not only at the intensively studied site but also across the region, extending over 12,000 
km
2 or more; aerial and field surveys confirmed the general extent of the die-off.  Notably, the recent drought was warmer than the previous 
sub-continental drought of the 1950s.  The limited, available observations suggest that die-off from the recent drought was more extensive 
than that from the previous drought, extending into wetter sites within the tree species’ distribution.  Our results quantify a trigger leading to 
rapid, drought-induced die-off of overstory woody plants at sub-continental-scale and highlight the potential for such die-off to be more severe 
and extensive for future global-change type drought under warmer conditions (From Breshears et al. 2005, Proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences USA: in press.) 
 
 
SCALING ISSUES AND THE ECOLOGY OF DESERT SOIL CRUST BRYOPHYTES

In studies of desert soil crust ecology, bryophytes as a group have largely been neglected. This neglect is unfortunate because these plants 
provide unique and important ecosystem services to the desert community. For example, the effect of moss cover on nutrient cycling 
processes has scarcely been investigated for desert ecosystems while its significance in other environments is well known. The soil binding 
and water holding capacity of a solid clump of desert moss is quite remarkable and a familiar phenomenon to many desert researchers. 
However, these properties have yet to be adequately studied and quantified. Their ability to persist in the desiccated state for months at a time 
and resume activity virtually immediately upon rewetting gives them a unique advantage among the land plants when it comes to utilizing the 
resources made available by sporadic rainfall. As such, they may play a key role in the responses of desert ecosystems to the pulse events 
that characterize these environments. Finally, many bryophytes have very specific habitat and substrate requirements that make them 
especially sensitive indicators of both natural ecological variables as well as environmental pollutants. Because of their small size, bryophytes 
are strongly affected by fine-scale variation in their environment. These effects can often override processes operating at the usual scale of 
ecological investigation, leading to complex patterns that can be difficult to interpret. Expanding our knowledge of the basic ecology of desert 
soil crust bryophytes at the appropriate scales is essential to understanding the behavior of these crusts. At UNLV we will be investigating how 
important variables such as light, temperature, moisture, etc. vary across the microscale habitats that these organisms occupy. By gaining an 
understanding of the tolerance limits of these species we hope to offer insight into the processes of dispersal and establishment and 
eventually the ability to predict both species composition along with potential cover and biomass. Bryophyte ecology lags far behind vascular 
plant ecology in this area, but it remains a crucial first step towards predicting how these species may be affected by the environmental 
impacts of fire, global change, or specific management practices.

Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) populations on Anderson Mesa exploded during the wet years of the 1920s before fluctuating greatly in the 
1930s. Although a hunting season was initiated in 1940 to spread the buck:doe ratio and decrease intraspecific competition, the population 
generally declined during most of the 1940s and the season was closed from 1944 to 1949. Fawn survival rates and populations continued to 
fluctuate until the early 1990s when a marked decline in fawn survival and population numbers occurred. Despite various management 
prescriptions including closed seasons, habitat closures, and coyote reduction, pronghorn populations on Anderson Mesa appear to have 
been influenced mostly be weather fluctuations, ungulate competition, and long term habitat changes. Mid-summer drought, exacerbated by 

 
33 
ungulate predation on perennial forage plants is hypothesized to now be the primary factor limiting pronghorn populations. Population 
fluctuations, always a characteristic of Anderson Mesa’s pronghorn, appear to have accelerated since the 1970s. Drought and forage 
condition are believed to be the factors determining pronghorn population size, and management prescriptions should revolve around the 
condition of perennial browse plants. 
 
 
AN ACOUSTIC SURVEY FOR BATS ALONG THE COLORADO RIVER CORRIDOR

Appropriate conservation requires an understanding of how the resource is used by an animal.  Because bats are nocturnal mammals, 
knowledge of how they use a resource has been difficult and time-consuming to obtain.  Prior to the development of ultrasonic bat detectors, a 
resource inventory for bats was conducted using standard mist-netting techniques at water sources.  However, netting is biased towards bats 
easily captured over pools of water or along low flyways. In addition, the vast remoteness of much of the Colorado River Plateau, combined 
with the ability of bats to fly long distances over rugged terrain, has constrained our knowledge of when and how bats might use the resource.  
However, since the development of affordable field-robust bat detectors, we now have another tool by which to evaluate the landscape for use 
by bats. I will present a brief overview of bat echolocation plus information regarding two field-popular bat detectors: Anabat II (frequency 
division) and Pettersson D240x (time-expansion).  Both detectors are designed to record the ultrasonic calls of bats for later identification in 
the laboratory. However, since each system has known advantages and disadvantages, by combining the two methods we benefit from the 
advantages and reduce the disadvantages.  I will discuss the techniques I used to monitor bat-use of the Colorado River corridor using both 
detectors, providing specific examples of acoustic sampling of ultrasonic bat calls conducted during a research river trip in September 2004. 
 
 
A HISTORY OF THE DISCOVERY AND EXPLORATION OF THE CAVES OF HORSESHOE MESA, GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK 
 
BUECHER, ROBERT H. 
7050 E. Katchina Court, Tucson, AZ 85715, buecher@comcast.net  
 
Many of the caves on Horseshoe Mesa were discovered in the late 1890's by copper miners working at the Grandview Mine. The initial 
exploration of the largest cave, now known as Cave of the Domes, is documented by numerous inscriptions found on the cave walls and by a 
series of period newspaper articles. Because the early mining effort supported the construction of the scenic Grandview Trail, the caves soon 
became a tourist attraction and additional caves were discovered and developed. However, the notoriety was short lived. The closing of the 
mine and development of Grand Canyon Village as the center of Grand Canyon tourism abruptly ended most tourist trips to the caves. Soon 
the names and inventories of the individual caves became confused. In the 1970's a team of cave researchers inventoried the known caves 
and re-established the historic names with specific caves and cavern features. I will present results from this work and describe a 
reconstruction of historic events through an inventory of period signatures and photographs from Horseshoe Mesa caves by known Grand 
Canyon explorers.

The increase in fuel loading and subsequent increase in large, high intensity wildfires has been well documented on the Colorado plateau, as 
well as throughout the western United States.  These fires can have dramatic negative impacts on aquatic ecosystems.  In recent years we 
have studied the effects of wildfire on fishes and aquatic ecosystems from 9 wildfires, impacting 15 streams and 14 species of fish in the SW.  
Results have varied from little or no impact to 70%-90% reduction in total fish numbers, to complete extirpation of entire fish assemblages.  
Re-colonization of fishes has been slow in some streams, and long-term alteration of habitat has been observed.  As a group, native fishes are 
one of the most threatened assemblages in the southwest.  Invasive nonnative fishes, damming, and dewatering of streams, have taken their 
toll on native fish populations.  The result is that many remnant populations of native fishes persist in small isolated habitats with little or no 
connectivity to other populations, leaving them especially vulnerable to impacts from large, high-intensity wildfire.  Possible causes for the loss 
of fish include post-fire ash and sediment loads, sustained exposure to poor water quality, violent flooding, short and long term alteration of 
habitat (channel scouring, filling in of pools, alteration of substrate composition) loss of food resources, or, most likely, a combination of these 
and other factors.  Mortality due to brief exposures to high levels of suspended ash was assessed in the lab.  Ash LC50 levels were assessed 
for 5 native fishes (10.61 g/l – 16.65 g/l) and 2 introduced species indicate that mortality can be at least partially explained by brief exposure to 
high levels of suspended ash concentrations.  Water samples collected from fire-impacted streams have been measured at, and many times 
above, the LC50’s calculated in the lab.  Physical and geo-spatial data from fire impacted research sites are currently being compiled to begin 
linking the physical impact on the watershed with the biological impact found in the stream.  Our results from lab and field studies underscore 
the need for fuels reductions to help reduce the severity of wildfire.  Fuels reduction treatments/prescribed fires need to be monitored for 
effects to aquatic ecosystems so that this data, along with existing data from wildfires, can be used to model how much fire intensity a 
watershed can sustain without negatively impacting fisheries resources.

This study addresses the differences in the aquatic food base of a travertine dam forming reach and a non-travertine dam forming reach in 
Fossil Creek, Arizona.  Allochthonous sources of energy input were assessed through leaf pack processing experiments.  Nutrient diffusing 
artificial substrates (clay flowerpots) were used to compare algal accrual rates and nutrient limitations between the reaches.  Leaf litter 
processing rates were significantly faster (p< .0001) at the travertine dam forming reach than at the non-travertine reach for both Arizona 
alder, Alnus oblongifolia, and Arizona Sycamore, Platanus wrightii, leaf species.  Associated macroinvertebrate communities were more 
diverse in the travertine reach.  Alder decomposed more quickly than sycamore at both reaches (p = .0001).  Algae accrued at a much faster 
rate at the travertine reach than the non-travertine reach.  Algae responded positively to nutrient enrichment (nitrogen and phosphorous) in the 
summer at the travertine reach.  In contrast, algae never responded to nutrient enrichment in the non-travertine reach, suggesting algae is 
limited by other factors at this reach.  The diversion dam and hydroelectric facility built on Fossil Creek near the turn of the century has 
recently been decommissioned.  Full flows have been returned to the stream, which is expected to increase travertine formation.  The results 
of this study indicate faster leaf litter processing and greater algal accrual at the travertine reach, providing a richer food base for higher trophic 
levels.  The expected increase in travertine formation should promote a richer food base in Fossil Creek.  Most, if not all, species of the native 
fish assemblage in Fossil Creek should benefit by increased travertine formation. The substantial growth release for the nutrient enriched 
substrates at the travertine reach indicates a potential for nuisance level blooms of algae in the summer if anthropogenic inputs are not 
managed.  This research will contribute to the foundation of basic knowledge about how stream ecosystems, especially travertine forming 
systems, function. The decommissioning of the dam and subsequent return of full flows gives us the opportunity to use this study as baseline 
data to assess changes associated with stream restoration and dam removal including changes in geomorphology.  It will add to the now 
sparse body of knowledge about the ecosystem effects of dam removal.

We attached radio transmitters to 4 female and 3 male spotted bats (Euderma maculatum) captured over ponds in Great Basin desertscrub 
vegetation type, Upper Colorado River area, 27-28 June 2005.  We tracked bats for 7 to 16 days to identify foraging areas and travel corridors. 
Bats foraged primarily in Great Basin desertscrub and pinyon-juniper vegetation.  Marble Canyon and adjacent tributaries were used as travel 
corridors to access foraging areas.  On most nights, bats emerged at approximately 30 min after sunset, foraged until ~ 23:30, and returned to 
roosts between 0300 and 0400.  Bats regularly used canyons and washes to travel to foraging sites.  On 4 successive nights, 12 to 61 spotted 
bats passed through a canyon in a 1-hr period.  One bat roosted in Soap Creek and used this canyon to travel to cliffs approximately 7 km 
away.  We documented several bats using canyons along the east side of the Kaibab Plateau.  Foraging routes appeared to be circular and 
counterclockwise, with some bats foraging in the same general area.  It did not appear that spotted bats maintained exclusive foraging areas, 
although they may have partitioned habitat use temporally.  Bats changed foraging locations during the project, possible evidence of bats 
tracking shifting resources. For example, 1 bat changed her foraging location from desertscrub to pinyon-juniper.  Spotted bats appeared to 
night roost in pinyon-juniper woodlands between midnight and 01:00 to 0:300.  They foraged within 20 to 30 km of roosts.  Spotted bats 
appear to be patchily distributed but locally common in northern Arizona.  Spotted bats used similar habitat compared with other populations; 
foraging distances that we documented remain much greater than reported from other locations in western North America.

In 1995, a mummified spotted bat (Euderma maculatum) was discovered in a limestone cave (1,530 m elevation; Great Basin desertscrub 
vegetation) in northern Arizona. Using radiocarbon analysis, the bat was dated as 9180 +50 radiocarbon years old (
14C years Before Present 
[B.P.]). In 2003 and 2005, we retrieved 8 additional spotted bat mummies. Remains dated from <50 yrs B.P. to 2110 + 40 yrs B.P. 
(approximate ages: <50 (n = 2), 120, 180, 300, 1450, 1760, 2110 yrs B.P.), indicating long-term stable use of the cave roost. An exit count at 
the cave indicated high use in May 2005 (n = 24 spotted bats); at other times during spring, summer, and fall, <10 spotted bats were heard 
exiting. We captured live spotted bats roosting in this cave (n = 8) and on the Kaibab Plateau (2500 m elevation, ~35 km from the cave, n = 
27). We collected hair and wing samples from mummified remains and live bats. Stable isotope signatures from live spotted bats and from the 
<50 yr B.P. mummified spotted bat were similar. However, mummified spotted bats >50 yrs B.P. were more enriched in 
13C suggesting their 
diet had shifted within the past 100 years from a higher proportion of C4 plant-feeding moths to C3 plant-feeding moths. We hypothesize that 
this shift in spotted bat diet could be related to one of several causes: (1) decrease in C4 plant density, (2) increase in C3 plant density, (3) 
diet shift in spotted bats, (4) isotope enrichment in C3 plants > 100 yrs B.P., or (5) early in the mummification process digenesis shifted the 
isotopic signature which then remained constant for thousands of years.

We examined the relationship between soil stability and the structure and functioning of mycorrhizal fungal communities of the Colorado 
Plateau.  Mycorrhizal fungi form symbiotic, often mutualistic, belowground associations with most plants in arid and semi-arid ecosystems.  
Previous studies have shown mycorrhizal fungi to strongly influence soil stability.  For instance, mycorrhizal fungi bind soil particles together 
through the production of hyphal networks and glomalin, a sticky glue-like protein.   However, few studies have examined the reverse, how 
altered soil stability affects mycorrhizal fungi.  To examine the relationship between degraded soil stability and mycorrhizal fungi, we compared 
mycorrhizal activity across low and high stability sites (as per the BLM Rangeland Health Assessment Protocol) within the Grand Staircase-
Escalante National Monument.  Several key patterns emerged.  (1) Mycorrhizal fungal spores were 3 times more abundant and 1.5 times 
more species rich in high stability soils compared to low stability soils. (2) NMDS ordinations showed soil degradation to cause an overall shift 
in mycorrhizal fungal communities. (3) Soil glomalin content was up to 3 times higher in high stability soils compared to low stability soils. We 
were not able to directly test whether soil stability causes depauperate AM fungal communities or whether the lack of AM fungi caused 
unstable soils.  However, the strength and causality of these relationships is explored using structural equation modeling.  Our results indicate 
a community-level relationship between mycorrhizal fungi and soil degradation never before demonstrated in arid ecosystems.  We also report 
interesting and novel results relating mycorrhizal fungal community diversity to the function of glomalin production.  These findings reveal 
information on the basic ecology of mycorrhizal fungi in arid ecosystems as well as provide insight into how mycorrhizal fungi factor into soil 
erosional feedback loops.

One problem associated with attempts to reintroduce condors (Gymnogyps californianus) at Vermilion Cliffs, Arizona, is that many birds are 
getting lead poisoning.  Fragments of bullets in carcasses and lead from mines or other environmental inputs have been hypothesized as 
potential sources of the lead contamination.  Here we use radiogenic isotopes to lead (Pb 204, Pb 206, Pb 207 and Pb 208) to investigate the 
potential sources of environmental lead contamination and linkages between bullet fragments and blood contamination.  Specifically we 
attempt to (1) compare isotopic signatures of specific bullet fragments with lead in the blood and (2) compare lead signals in condor 
populations with background environmental and bullet lead signatures.  We present conclusive data to support the hypothesis that bullet 
fragments are the source of lead poisoning in condors.  
 
 
SPATIALLY EXPLICIT MODELING OF COLORADO PLATEAU LANDSCAPES FROM

Models are an essential means of incorporating science into adaptive ecosystem management. The development and use of models facilitates 
the explicit specification of assumptions on ecosystem functioning and the analysis of management alternatives with the uncertainties that 
come with limited scientific information. The process of building and using models provides transparency and enables the critical examination 
of assumptions.  Spatially explicit simulation models can generate hypotheses concerning future trajectories of ecosystems and valued 
ecosystem attributes. The integration of simulation modeling into management planning can allow managers, resource specialists, and 
stakeholders to examine and compare potential outcomes of proposed management alternatives in relation to management objectives and 
desired conditions. SIMPPLLE is a spatially explicit landscape-scale modeling system for simulating vegetation changes caused by 
disturbance processes of wildfire, insects, and diseases.  Stochastic simulations provide a range in vegetation conditions and levels of 
disturbance processes. A system variable of regional climate is used to capture the interaction between cyclic changes in temperature and 
moisture and disturbance processes. SIMPPLLE was originally developed for ecosystems in the Northern Rocky Mountains and its application 
to the Colorado Plateau is being done through the FRAMES (Framing Research to support Adaptive Management of Ecosystems) project 
which involves the U.S. Geological Survey, USDA Forest Service, Colorado State University, Mesa Verde National Park, Prescott College, 
and Northern Arizona University. The system uses conceptual models and research results specific to the Colorado Plateau and has the 
potential to integrate vegetation, soil, and aquatic components of landscapes. Simulation results from Mesa Verde National Park are used to 
quantify current trends, historic conditions, and management alternatives.

TACTICAL PLANNING OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IN SUPPORT OF PRONGHORN HABITAT ENHANCEMENT ON ANDERSON 
MESA, AZ.

The Anderson Mesa pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) herd is of special conservation and management concern, due to significant 
population declines since the mid 1980s. A host of factors have been attributed to the decline of this population. Piñon-juniper woodland 
encroachment into the mesa’s grassland ecosystems has emerged as one of these factors.  Pronghorn are a keenly visual prey species that 
evolved in, and prefer open habitats. The Arizona Game and Fish Department (AZGF) is currently working to restore the structural component 
of grasslands on and surrounding Anderson Mesa by implementing a multi-million dollar collaborative project to remove woody vegetation in 
important pronghorn habitat to enhance, expand and connect the available grassland habitat.  Our objective was to develop a model to 
maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of habitat enhancement activities, while simultaneously reconciling habitat enhancement objectives 
with financial and operational considerations for a 10-year planning horizon.  To achieve this, we utilized a GIS-linked simulated annealing 
optimization model to integrate spatially-explicit expert knowledge and resource inventory information across a 260,000-acre analysis area, 
with a focus on pronghorn habitat requirements and use. Our model was able to integrate complex decision factors at a landscape level, and 
provides a decision-support tool for wildlife and land managers who desire to develop a sound tactical woodland treatment strategy in the 
greater Anderson Mesa area.  In consultation with managers, we developed a zoning scheme to codify current and potential pronghorn habitat 
use, and established management goals. Based upon these management goals, we generated 3 different trade-off management scenarios.  
Results indicate habitat enhancement goals for this landscape are achievable given agency operational constraints.   
 
 
BUREAU OF RECLAMATION ROLE IN RESTORING NATIVE FISH TO FOSSIL CREEK 
 
CLARKSON, ROBERT W. 
Bureau of Reclamation, Phoenix Area Office, PO Box 81169, Phoenix, Arizona 85069, rclarkson@lc.usbr.gov 
 
During a 2001 Endangered Species Act consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) over impacts of potential nonnative fish 
transfers to the Gila River basin via the Central Arizona Project aqueduct, Reclamation proposed constructing a series of fish barriers on high 
value native fish streams to assist with recovery of threatened and endangered fishes.  The purpose of the fish barriers is to prevent upstream 
movements of nonnative fishes (which are incompatible with persistence of native fishes) into stream reaches dedicated for native fish 
management.  Although the native fishery of Fossil Creek had been degraded over the past century by flow depletion from Arizona Public 
Service’s (APS) Childs-Irving Hydropower Project and invasions of nonnative fishes, the stream could be restored for native fish dedication if 
nonnative fishes were removed and protected against their reinvasion by a fish barrier.  Flow restoration via the proposed decommissioning of 
the hydropower project was an added bonus for the stream, which could then serve as a replication site for the rare Verde River population of 
the federally-threatened spikedace, Meda fulgida, a species that is found only in relatively pristine medium to large rivers.  The near-magical 
alignment of Reclamation funding for construction of a fish barrier and financial support for stream renovation activities, flow restoration of the 
stream by APS, and support for the project by the public, government agencies, and environmental groups brought the massive Fossil Creek 
native fish restoration project to realization.  A fish barrier was constructed in October 2004, and the salvage, renovation, and repatriation of 
salvaged fish tasks were completed soon thereafter.  Historical flows were returned to the stream in June 2005.  All that remains for complete 
project success is to repatriate spikedace and other appropriate native fishes. 
 
 
FISHES OF THE GRAND CANYON

This talk examines the status, trends, and recent condition of Grand Canyon fishes, focusing particular attention on the endangered humpback 
chub (Gila cypha) because of its prominence within the Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program. The session begins with a 
discussion of the conditions that led to the development of the Grand Canyon’s unique native fish populations and then moves on to the 
reasons for their decline. The effects of the modified low fluctuating flow (MLFF) alternative on fish populations are also examined. The 
presentation concludes with a discussion of possible management options to slow or reverse the decline of humpback chub numbers.

The general horizontal stratigraphy of the plateau, and the prevalence of karst-forming limestone substrates, combine with the scarcity of 
water to produce a great abundance of dry caves on the Colorado Plateau.  These dry caves form excellent archives for the preservation of 
mummified plant remains.  In such a dry region with low erosion rates, many of these caves persist water-free for longer than the last 50,000 
years from which plants can be aged by radiocarbon dating.  As a result, caves not only protect abundant data on past vegetation change, but 
these deposits are unprecedented in a world where plant fossil records are typically rare in desert environments.  These plant fossil records 
take many forms.  Packrat middens, debris piles of plant parts collected by packrats and hardened by continuous coatings of urine, often are 
mistaken for rocks by the uninitiated.  Cave sediments can contain continuous deposits of pollen blown in over many thousands of years.  
Both packrat middens and pollen deposits can even be found under small ledges.  Middens have also been discovered that were left by other 
animals such as ringtails (Bassariscus astutus), porcupines (Erethizon dorsatum) and domestic sheep (Ovis aries).  Caves adjacent to rivers 
can contain Pleistocene driftwood.  The most unique and invaluable cave deposits consist of dung of extinct animals such as mammoth, sloth, 
camels, and horses.  Although the study of digested plant parts in fossil dung could easily win an award for the most absurd sounding 
scientific study, there is really no better source of information on the ecological niche for an extinct species.

INTEGRATING DATA ON HISTORIC VEGETATION CHANGE BETWEEN THE SAN FRANCISCO PEAKS AND GRAND CANYON

Abundant data exist on past vegetation change on the Colorado Plateau.  Unfortunately, these data are often dispersed among many different 
highly specialized fields of study.  And, because  these data encompass a wide variety of spatial, temporal, and taxonomic scales, it can be 
difficult to draw them together into a synthetic picture of historic vegetation change.  But, without this vision of historic vegetation change, it is 
difficult to distinguish between noise and trends in shorter-term data sets.  Between the top of the San Francisco Peaks and the bottom of the 
Grand Canyon, data sets demonstrate vegetation changes that have occurred from the late Pleistocene  up until the Twentieth Century.  
Leaves, seeds, and twigs of past plants have been accumulated by packrats and saved as mummified debris in packrat middens.  Although 
these studies may be focused into different time periods ranging from 250 to 50,000 years ago, these data reflect vegetation changes on local 
sites of upland, often rocky, desert slopes.  Fossil pollen from plants is preserved in lake or pond sediments, packrat middens, or even in dry 
caves or desert rock fissures.   But these records mostly represent wind-pollinated species of higher elevation habitats where lakes are most 
common.  Data on long-term plant succession is available through the study of soil development, plant succession, and colonization on 
geomorphic substrates of differing ages, especially the abundant volcanic flows.   Archives of data on past tree populations exist in and near 
every forest and woodland in the form of tree-rings.  Not only can the rings of living and dead trees be used to study past fluctuations in 
populations, but some can be used to reconstruct specific climatic variables over the past 100's to 1000's of years.  Finally, these longer-tern 
records can be integrated with shorter-term records such as GLO tree survey data, written historical observations, and early photography.  
Upon further study, disparities between the interpretation of two different sources of data often can be seen to result from reflecting two 
different aspects of the same change, further increasing our understanding of the change through integration of multiple data sets.  
 
 
MORPHOLOGICAL VARIATION IN PINYON NEEDLES OF THE VERDE VALLEY AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO ANNUAL 
PRECIPITATION

Pinyon pines often have variable frequencies of needles per needle-fascicle, especially in northern Arizona.  Because some taxonomic 
classifications are based nearly entirely upon this character, this causes uncertainty in species identifications. In the Verde Valley, these 
numbers range from almost 100% two-needle fascicles above 2000 m elevation to almost 100% one needle-fascicles below 1200 m.  The 
majority of the pinyon trees grow between these elevations and support intermediate frequencies of both needle types. This situation is 
analogous to pinyon populations along the central Nevada/Utah border where the two-needled Colorado Pinyon (Pinus edulis) grow near the 
Singleleaf Pinyon (Pinus monophylla). A previous study demonstrated that the frequency of needle types on one Nevada population varied 
from year-to-year, corresponding to precipitation over the previous 9 months.  We analyzed pinyon branches from Verde Valley populations 
from near three climate stations that have recorded greatly differing amounts of precipitation between each other and from year-to-year.  Our 
results show that, like the Great Basin pinyon, the frequency of one and two-needle fascicles is variable from year-to-year and correlated to 
precipitation.  However, unlike the Great Basin pinyon, these Verde Valley mixtures are thought to represent the two-needled Colorado Pinyon 
(Pinus edulis), and the lower-elevation Arizona Singleleaf Pinyon, which was originally described by Elbert Little as: Pinus edulis var. fallax.  
Subsequently, others have re-classified these pines as: Pinus monophylla var. fallax; or, Pinus californiarum var. fallax. In view of the fact that 
it is inappropriate for individual trees to change species from year-to-year, it would seem that the Arizona Singleleaf Pinyon should remain a 
variety of that species to which they can morph following a wet year: Pinus edulis var. fallax. This classification is the most consistent in 
describing the central Arizona populations, but also better describes the broader array of morphological and genetic variation across their 
ranges.  Additional measurements on these branches demonstrate that while needle-fascicle number and needle length are correlated with 
precipitation over the proceeding 9 months, shoot length seems to better reflect precipitation over the year prior to the growth.

Leaf retention is an important process for ecosystem maintenance because it allows leaves to become colonized by microbes and, 
subsequently, invertebrate shredders that further break down leaves, thereby providing an important nutrient input to the stream food web.  
Some of the main factors influencing leaf retention are (1) stream discharge; (2) substrate coarseness; (3) stream sinuosity; and (4) debris 
dams.  Though many studies have attempted to determine the relative importance of these factors, few have examined travertine in the 
context of leaf retention, which is important because travertine forms specialized types of debris dams that have the potential to greatly 
influence leaf retention.  This study compared leaf retention at three travertine dam and three free-flowing sites within Fossil Creek, Arizona in 
order to determine the role of travertine as a coarse substrate in leaf retention.  Three a priori hypotheses were tested: greater leaf retention 
will be found at (1) the travertine dam sites versus the free-flowing sites, (2) sites with lower average velocities, and (3) sites with overall 
coarser substrates.  Results indicated that travertine sites were much better at retaining leaves, and that velocity, not discharge, was a primary 
contributor to retention.  The hypothesis that greater leaf retention would occur at sites with overall coarser substrates, however, was rejected, 
as coarser substrates were found at the free-flowing sites.  Travertine was the primary coarse substrate type found at the travertine sites, 
while cobble and boulder made up a majority of the coarse substrates at the free-flowing sites.  These results suggest that travertine may be a 
more important contributor to leaf retention than other substrate types.  The decommissioning of the Irving Power Plant in the summer of 2005 
has increased flows dramatically in parts of Fossil Creek, and subsequent travertine deposition is expected to increase nearly ten-fold.  Our 

 
38 
findings suggest that the increased travertine deposition will lead to greater leaf retention and, ultimately, a more rapid restoration of Fossil 
Creek.

We examined responses of small mammals to initial thinning treatments for fuel reduction at the Southwest Plateau Fire and Fire Surrogate 
Project study area.  We conducted mark-recapture data collection on small mammal populations and estimated capture probabilities, 
movements, and population densities.  We then used a weighted least-squares regression analysis to evaluate density responses to thinning 
treatments.  We evaluated strength of evidence for our a priori hypotheses based on Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC).  We marked 7 
species of small mammals over the course of 4 years, and present analyses for the 2 most common species at the study area.  We found that 
both deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and chipmunks (Tamias cinereicollis) generally increased, as predicted, in the first year after 
thinning, though the response was not consistent across replicated study sites.  Important lessons from this research are: (1) indices of 
population size based on an assumption of equal capture probabilities over space and time are unreliable for detecting population responses 
to treatments, (2) variability in pre-treatment conditions may substantially impact responses to treatments, and (3) longer-term studies of 
responses to forest fuel reduction treatments are needed.  Small mammal responses to wildfire have also been monitored, and analyses of 
those data are ongoing.

We attached radio transmitters to 8 female big free-tailed bats (Nyctinomops macrotis) captured at 6 different sites throughout northern 
Arizona, June-August 2005.  We tracked bats for a cumulative total of 13 days to identify foraging patterns, roost locations, and travel 
corridors. Tagged bats kept their transmitters for only 2 (±2) days. One bat was tracked for 7 nights and spent almost all of its time foraging 
over Great Basin desert scrub vegetation and on one occasion made a 1-hr round trip flight into ponderosa pine forest; an elevation gain of 
1077 m. Great Basin desert scrub and various tributaries to the Colorado River were used extensively as foraging areas and travel corridors. 
Total distance traveled nightly was estimated as ~32 km each for 2 bats. Roost sites were in cracks and crevices in sandstone in the upper 
portions of vertical cliffs along the upper Colorado River (Marble Canyon), Kanab Creek (Grama Canyon), and Canyon de Chelly. Of the 7 
bats tracked back to roost sites, 3 were found to be roosting in the same location in Marble Canyon and 2 other bats were found to be roosting 
in the same location at Canyon de Chelly. An exit count conducted at the Canyon de Chelly roost confirmed at least 4 bats exiting thus 
suggesting big free-tailed bats form small maternity colonies which is consistent with the literature. We were unable to document night roosting 
for big free-tailed bats. Bats emerged from day roosts ~2030 each night, foraged for approximately 6 hours and returned to their day roost. 
Previous work in the southwestern United States with big free-tailed bats indicated similar roost sites; however, information regarding foraging 
patterns is absent from the literature. Big free-tailed bats appear to be patchily distributed in northern Arizona and use similar habitat 
compared with other populations in Utah, New Mexico, Texas, and Mexico.

For North American woodpeckers, winter roosts afford escape from extreme climatic conditions such as wind and snow, reduce heat and 
energy loss, and provide protection from predators. However, little information on the characteristics and use of winter roosts in burned areas 
exists.  We monitored the use and characteristics of 12 winter roosts used by 9 radio-tagged Hairy Woodpeckers (Picoides villosus) in 
ponderosa pine forests of Northern Arizona that had experienced wildfire in 1996 and 2000.  Compared to random trees in the surrounding 
forest that had experienced similar burn severities, roost trees were larger than 95% of random trees.  Using point-center quarter method, 
trees immediately surrounding roost trees were less dense than 95% of those surrounding random non-roost trees.  Two-thirds of roost trees 
were created by fire and these roost trees were smaller then those created by other means.  Two-thirds of the roosts were outside or on the 
edge of estimated home ranges based on diurnal locations.  This study suggests that fire-killed trees are a likely source of winter roost trees 
for hairy woodpeckers.  Therefore, restoration of natural fire regimes in ponderosa pine forests of the Colorado plateau that create roost trees 
could benefit hairy woodpeckers.

The Outlet Fire burned over 13,000 acres of mostly mixed conifer forest on the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park and Kaibab National 
Forest in 2000.  Post-fire monitoring began that summer and continued through 2004. The objective of the study was to examine post-fire 
vegetation change in relation to three types of disturbed sites: burned areas, fire-fighting staging areas, and fire-fighting handlines.  Indicator 
Species Analysis, Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling, and ANOSIM were employed to determine indicator species and trends across years 
and among disturbance types. There were statistically significant differences in floristic composition, cover, and diversity over time and among 
disturbance types.  Burned sites had the highest vegetation cover in the first year and cover remained high through 2004.  Diversity in the 
burned areas decreased following dieback of the initial ruderal invasion.  By 2004 the areas were largely floristically homogeneous, which may 
have ramifications for other trophic levels.  Few exotic species were present, although by 2004, Bromus tectorum (cheat grass) had become 
an indicator species of high-severity burned areas. Staging areas used in fire fighting contained the greatest number of exotic species in all 
years of study, but this may be related to continued use of these roadside areas by Park visitors.  Areas of handlines showed no statistically 
significant differences between 2000 and 2004, indicating no vegetation recovery has occurred.  Current methods of site rehabilitation 
following handline construction may need to be modified to improve vegetation recovery.  Continued monitoring is essential for enhancing our 
understanding of long-term changes in these high elevation forests.

Grand Canyon Wildlands Council and collaborators are in the final stages of developing a draft Wildlands Network Vision document that 
integrates science and passion to protect and heal wild nature in the Grand Canyon region–from the High Plateaus of Utah, across Grand 
Canyon to the Mogollon Rim in Arizona, and up to the headwaters of the Little Colorado River in New Mexico. While we expect to have the 
preliminary draft ready for peer review by January 2006, we would like to take this opportunity to present in a poster format, an outline and 
summary of the vision document at the 8
th Biannual Conference in Flagstaff. The Wildlands Network envisions an inspirational landscape of 
safe havens and safe passages for all the region’s native wild creatures. Equally important in this landscape view is that it assures all species 
the fullest potential to adapt to the changing world. We trust not in naïve optimism, but in an unrelenting commitment to the ethical treatment of 
that grand creation called wild nature.  Toward a Wilder Grand Canyon.  Our goal is not to capture some static vignette of a bygone era, but to 
“re-wild,” that is, restore the promise and natural complexity of self-willed, naturally evolving wildlands. Land conservation in the past has 
generally taken the form of designating relatively small safe havens. These are in fact islands of protected habitat in an expanding sea of 
degraded lands. They are managed for static sets of characteristics, isolating the natural components and processes, both spatially and in 
time. Just as real islands lose their native diversity of life, even national parks like Grand Canyon have lost native animals, including at least 
seven vertebrate species. One part of the solution is to create more and larger safe havens such as wilderness, national parks and national 
monuments, but other, supplemental efforts are needed.  While safe havens, or protected core areas, provide critical components for 
preserving wild nature, many native species inhabiting core areas require additional natural connections and dynamics that can be provided 
only through connectivity. Safe passages are needed for wildlife migration and for plant and animal dispersal and evolution. Ultimately, to 
deliver the Grand Canyon region’s remarkable array of wild nature to future generations, with all their intimacy and magnificence, with their full 
compliment of species and ecological functions, is the challenge we collectively share.

Annual plant invasions have altered plant communities, fuel-bed characteristics, and fire regimes throughout western North America. This shift 
results in a serious hazardous fuel condition and is a foremost management concern at Zion National Park, where the entire Zion Canyon is 
currently dominated by a dense growth of exotic grasses. Effective management tools have not yet been identified that can simultaneously 
control exotic plants, re-establish native plants, and help restore historical fuel conditions and fire regimes. This proposed project will 
experimentally evaluate a series of treatments to achieve these management objectives, and establish a demonstration site at Zion National 
Park where the results can continue to be evaluated and observed into the future.  Information gained from this project will be integrated back 
into the process of land management planning.  Initiated in July 2005, the project study design, preparatory planning and objectives will be 
presented.

Historical management practices and recurring drought have left many northern Arizona grasslands in poor ecological condition, typified by the 
loss of native grasses, forbs, and shrubs, encroachment of juniper and other woody species, and the spread of invasive weeds.  Many of 
these areas also contain large amounts of woody debris from tree removal efforts undertaken decades ago.  Collectively, these changes have 
adversely impacted the ecological function of grasslands, which has resulted in declines in wildlife such as pronghorn, burrowing owls, and 
other grassland obligate species.  In 2003, the Arizona Game and Fish Department initiated trials of restoration treatments on the Raymond 
Wildlife Area and adjacent lands managed by the Diablo Trust, Arizona State Land Department, and U.S. Forest Service.  Treatments 
included removal of live and dead trees by chainsaw crews, anchor chaining, hydraulic shears, a tree chipper, or front end loader, followed by 
lopping and scattering or burning of slash piles. Treatments ranged in cost from $30-$100/acre, successfully met objectives for removal of 
encroaching trees and woody debris, and appear to have facilitated pronghorn movement into previously unused areas. The next phase of 
restoration will focus on reestablishing native grasses, forbs, and shrubs that provide forage and cover for wildlife, but have been depleted or 
lost from many areas.  Restoring these habitat components and associated ecosystem function is a significant challenge that will require: 1) 
obtaining large quantities of seed from locally adapted native plants, 2) developing successful seeding techniques in an environment subject to 
recurrent drought and dominance by invasive species, 3) applying treatments within activity constraints imposed by cultural and other 
resources on federal lands, and 4) managing utilization by domestic and wild ungulates to ensure establishment and persistence of highly 
palatable forage plants.  Developing new partnerships with land managers and researchers on the Colorado Plateau is an important part of 
this effort.

Increasingly, models of forested ecosystem attributes are being used to identify important areas for management and conservation. However, 
these models can be difficult to integrate with a formal decision-making process and are not typically constructed at the broad scales over 
which management actions should occur. Efforts to manage and conserve southwestern landscapes will be most effective when sound 
science guides the decision-making process in a spatially-explicit framework. To facilitate such efforts, the Forest Ecosystem Restoration 
Analysis (ForestERA) project has developed empirically-based models and tools framed within a spatial decision support system for predicting 
and comparing the impacts of alternative forest management strategies on forest structure, fire hazard, wildlife, invasive plants, and 
watersheds. For example, when implemented within our prioritization tool, our fire risk layer, which quantifies regional factors influencing 
patterns of large fire ignition, can improve our ability to target areas for resource protection and manage fire risk at the landscape scale. We 
present results that demonstrate the utility of our approach in a collaborative planning process 
 
 
DROUGHT INDUCED IMPACTS ON VEGETATION DYNAMICS OF THE COLORADO PLATEAU: DERIVED FROM SATELLITE-BASED

The Colorado Plateau is a region that is particularly vulnerable to drought episodes with lasting impacts on vegetation communities and 
wildlife.  The most recent drought has plagued this region with widespread impacts on the landscape, most notably through wildfires, an acute 
shortage of water, and plant mortality.  Droughts are usually associated with a series of ecological events, ranging from increased fire hazard, 
amplified tree sensitivity to disease, alteration of the vegetation cover dynamics, loss of species diversity, reduced green biomass, and 
profound vegetation temporal behavior disturbances and eventually extensive landscape restructure.  Although much work has focused on the 
hydrological implications of these droughts, the large-scale impact on vegetation distribution and phenology is less well studied.  Whereas 
much of the drought induced events are beyond our preventative capabilities, some are actually manageable, and with early intervention and 
planning can be mitigated.  By offering a dependable and fast method to collect spatial information the land surface characteristics, and 
vegetation in particular, remote sensing can augment our abilities to foresee the progress of these droughts on the regional scale, and in doing 
so enables regional planner prepare (fire prevention, vulnerable region identification, grazing management) for these reoccurring events and 
assess the extent of their impacts.  In this study we used the 5+ years of continuous satellite-based vegetation index and land cover time 
series records to assess spatial and temporal patterns in vegetation cover dynamics.  Data from the highly calibrated and precisely geolocated 
Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from the Terra platform was used in conjunction with a phenology parameter 
extraction algorithm to analyze vegetation temporal patterns and inter-annual anomalies.  Our results indicate significant changes to the 
phenological behavior of vegetation are taking place over much of the area and that these changes are elevation and land cover dependent.  
Drought impact was also dependent on vegetation physiognomy with deeper-rooted vegetation less affected through the five years. These 
anomalies also show strong correlation with the Palmer drought index for the same period.

Grazing in natural areas has played a large role in the anthropogenic disturbance on the Colorado Plateau.   Livestock presence has also 
come at great ecological costs to biodiversity and ecosystem functions, facilitating the spread of many introduced plant species.  The severe 
impact of cattle grazing on one of the most biologically opulent areas of North America has led federal agencies to confront the issue by 
mandating stricter management and in some cases, by phasing-out grazing altogether.  Many western parks including Capitol Reef National 
Park and Glen Canyon Recreation Area have taken such measures.  Yet, the results of these measures in terms of recovery have yet to be 
determined.  This study looks at Santa Rosa Island of Channel Islands National Park, where cattle were removed in 1998 following 150 years 
of grazing and biological invasions, to identify plant community responses and to determine if elimination of the disturbance regime would 
affect alien plant persistence.  The exotic species of Santa Rosa Island were surveyed in 1998-1999 at the time of removal to provide a 
baseline distribution and abundance map for future study.  The distribution results were then transferred to an MS Access database and Arc 
View file for spatial mapping and query-running.  Through the use of these 1998-1999 alien plant distribution and abundance mappings paired 
with life history traits for high priority alien plants, target weed species were placed into prediction guilds of (1) decreasers; (2) persisters; and 
(3) increasers.  These predictions were tested in summer 2005 by revisiting the same sites mapped in 1998-1999 and using the same 
methodology to determine if abundances of these target species have changed since cattle removal.  The results of this study will provide site- 
and species specific ecological knowledge for an island-wise resource management plan and will help elucidate relationships between 
disturbance removal and invasive plant responses for natural areas within the Colorado Plateau. 
 
 
INVESTIGATING EFFECTS OF THE NOVEMBER 2004 HIGH-FLOW RELEASE FROM GLEN CANYON DAM ON AEOLIAN SAND-

In November, 2004, a 60-hour experimental flood release from Glen Canyon Dam held the Colorado River flow through Grand Canyon, 
Arizona, above 1160 m3 s-1  (41,000 ft3 s-1). This high-flow experiment was designed to rebuild fluvial sand deposits, restoring a component 
of the ecosystem that had declined since closure of the dam in 1963. Transport and deposition of aeolian sand has important implications for 
archaeological resources in the river corridor, many of which are located in and covered by aeolian deposits. This study presents aeolian 
sediment-transport data collected in the river corridor during the year before and in the months after the flood experiment. At each of the six 
study locations, substantial new deposition of fluvial sand occurred as a result of the 2004 flood, which temporarily increased the amount of 
sand available for aeolian entrainment. However, high daily fluctuations (142-566 m3/s; 5,000-20,000 ft3/s) of the river flow from January to 
March 2005 removed much of the new sand before the start of the 2005 windy season. The greatest potential for aeolian re-distribution of 
flood-deposited sand occurred during the April-May windy season, during which the highest measured winds can locally exceed 25 m s-1, with 
sand-transport rates ~5 kg cm-1 day-1. These data may be used to guide decisions regarding future experimental floods and subsequent flow 
schedules, if maximizing sand redistribution by wind is a management objective.

Most of the large cave systems in the Grand Canyon are in the Redwall and Muav formations.  Although the caves were formed within these 
thick limestone layers by dissolution by water, the majority of them are now dry.  Some of the Grand Canyon cave systems that still have 
active streams include Vasey’s Paradise, Roaring Springs, Thunder River, and Tapeats Caves.  The biology of caves in the Grand Canyon is 
relatively poorly-studied, and the stream caves are perhaps even less well-known.  In this presentation, I review what is known of stream 
caves and their biology and ecology in the Grand Canyon region.  I focus on the Roaring Springs cave system, with notes on other stream 
caves, as available.  Although the fauna of these caves is relatively depauperate, they support a variety of endemic species.  Peculiar aspects 
of their ecology are just beginning to be explored.

The Colorado River and its major tributaries once provided more or less continuous habitat for northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) and other 
amphibian species.  Historic surveys found leopard frogs to be widespread both along the main course of the river and in perennial side 
canyon areas.  Subsequent fragmentation of populations in the Glen Canyon region has resulted from the construction of Glen Canyon Dam.  
With the filling of the Lake Powell reservoir, leopard frog populations along the mainstem river have nearly all disappeared.  While populations 
persist in some side canyon areas, these populations now appear to be largely or completely isolated from one another.  In the Grand Canyon 
region, the last records of northern leopard frogs date from the 1990’s, and recent extensive surveys have found no remaining populations.  

 
42 
Genetic analyses of leopard frog populations in the region reveal that regional diversity is high, but individual populations show pronounced 
population structure.  This indicates that there is little gene flow, and populations are sharply isolated.  These patterns suggest that direct 
management efforts may be required to prevent further loss of subpopulations.  Such management efforts might include a) a translocation 
program to enhance population diversity, or prevent loss of local genetic diversity, and b) habitat restoration measures to sustain larger 
populations in particular areas.

A common perception associated with the invasion of exotic plant species is a depauperate or negatively altered arthropod community.  
Arthropods serve many vital ecosystem functions, and are important in their role as a vertebrate food resource.  However, the impact of exotic 
species on arthropod communities is too infrequently examined.  We studied the effects invasive saltcedar has had on altered riparian 
systems historically dominated by cottonwoods and willows in the American Southwest at Roosevelt Lake in central Arizona.  In 2002 and 
2003, we quantified the arthropod communities in three different habitats dominated by native willow, exotic saltcedar, and those habitats with 
a mosaic of native and exotic vegetation.  We discovered three major patterns: (1) a large difference between years in terms of total arthropod 
biomass and arthropod species richness presumably due to the impact of a millennial level drought in 2002.  (2) In 2003, the year with more 
normal precipitation, there was no difference in total arthropod biomass by habitat, but significantly higher species richness in mixed habitats, 
during the 2002 drought there was no difference in species richness, while native habitat had the greatest total arthropod biomass.  (3) Each 
riparian habitat supported a different arthropod community at different sampling periods, but there were no arthropod groups that were 
consistently associated with any habitat.  The overall pattern that emerged among the three habitats was that each supported a diverse, 
though different, arthropod community that changed between and within years, and no habitat was clearly superior in terms of arthropod 
diversity and biomass.  To understand whether the arthropod community differences by habitat may affect an obligate riparian insectivore, the 
Southwestern Willow Flycatcher, we examined the flycatcher’s diet.  We found that the flycatcher’s diet also varied by habitat, but that it 
consumed a wide variety of prey items in all habitats, and showed no differences in adult survival or breeding productivity among habitats, 
metrics that in part rely on the adequacy of food resources.  We concluded that the invasion of exotic saltcedar at Roosevelt Lake has had 
little impact of either riparian arthropod diversity or biomass.  We hypothesize that the relatively close proximity of the different riparian habitats 
at Roosevelt Lake and the surrounding Sonoran Desert Upland may have contributed to the over biomass and diversity of the arthropod 
community, yet this hypothesis remains to be tested.

State and local governments have seen dramatic increases in demand for services while at the same time experiencing dramatic decreases in 
budgets to provide and deliver the services a growing public demands. As it relates to private forest landowners and private forest 
management, several states offer property tax incentives (forest-agricultural tax designations) to encourage a variety of forest conservation 
practices and also to limit the conversion of the forested property to other uses that increased tax burden can bring about. In addition, many 
small logging and wood products businesses may rely substantially on the access to raw material and the opportunity to conduct forest 
management treatments that the tax incentive programs provide. However, under increasing budgetary pressure, local governments have 
begun to criticize such agricultural property tax designations of forested property and the reduction in tax revenues that result. Increased 
criticisms can be expected on eligibility requirements, compliance, and monitoring, as local governments try to maintain tax revenues. 
However, it is likely that reduced tax revenues may be partially or fully offset by the conduction of forest management activities required as a 
condition of eligibility in forest tax incentive programs. Activities that contribute revenues and receipts to local governments include the 
purchase, sale, transportation, and manufacture of wood products. In order for states to fully communicate the benefits of such tax incentive 
programs to local governments faced with reduced tax revenues, information on economic activity and revenues being generated must be 
compiled and collected to make informed decisions as to the true value of such state-sponsored tax incentive programs.  This investigation will 
survey and review the existence, eligibility requirements, and compliance measures currently in place for state sponsored property tax 
incentives in the western United States as a basis for a more thorough review of an individual state’s forest tax incentive program.

A primary goal of the U.S. Geological Survey’s Gap Analysis Program is to provide an assessment of the conservation status for key elements 
of the landscape. The map of land stewardship provides a representation of the existing network of conservation lands and is a fundamental 
data layer in the final SWReGAP product. The stewardship data layer consists of the categorization of the individual land parcels into 
conservation status codes driven by existing agency management plans. The status codes are contingent on the permanency of conservation 
efforts, types of anthropogenic activities, and overall guiding principles of natural resource management. GAP combines the conservation 
status codes with geographic boundaries that represent land ownership and management. This layer distinguishes individual parcels with 
differing levels of management protection. This information is the foundation for other SWReGAP analysis and products, and provides a tool 
for land stewards to make informed conservation decisions about management practices regarding biodiversity.

The 1987 Overflights Act mandated that Grand Canyon National Park (GCNP) substantially restore natural quiet to the Park.  In 1994, the 
NPS defined “substantial restoration of natural quiet” to mean that 50% or more of the Park has no aircraft audible for 75 to 100% of the day, 
each and every day.  To determine aircraft audibility, the natural ambient sound levels must be measured and quantified as a  baseline.  
Natural ambient sounds vary by vegetation type, elevation, and terrain features.  Different habitats are utilized by different species of birds, 
insects, and other wildlife, which in turn have different sounds associated with them.  Natural sounds are also produced by physical processes 
of the environment, such as flowing water, wind, snow, and rain.  Characterizing the GCNP natural ambient sound levels began by selecting 
an appropriate vegetation map and classification scheme.  Striking a balance between over and under representing the key vegetation types is 
important.  Too many classes results in an enormous field data collection effort and prohibitive cost of data collection.  Too few classes will not 
allow the separation of significantly different natural ambient sound levels between vegetative communities.  The objective of this paper is to 
provide information on the methods and materials used to select representative vegetation classes and sample sites in GCNP that 
characterize the natural ambient sound levels of the Park.

Navajo Point, the southeastern tip of the Kaiparowits Plateau, is ringed by Navajo Sandstone and cut by numerous small canyons.  We 
investigated the fire history of Pinus edulis-Juniperus osteosperma (piñon-juniper) woodlands.  Dendrochonological and surface fuel analyses 
of 24 stands identified three woodland types, (1) old-growth, characterized by large (dbh up to 90 cm) piñon trees which were >500 years old 
and presumably older junipers, (2) stands with maximum ages between 200 and 500 years, and (3) stands with maximum ages < 200 years.  
Supervised classifications of DOQ and Landsat TM imagery were performed using textural and spectral characteristics to delineate canopy 
differences between historic burns and unburned landscapes within these three categories. Helicopter surveys and eight 1-km line intercept 
samples further refined the relative areas of each type, which was in turn used to determine the fire cycle.  A fire cycle of approximately 350 
year rotation was calculated for the entire study area; however, in the northern potions, fires are stand-replacing and cover many hectares, 
and in the southern portion ample evidence of charcoal, juniper stags, and sagebrush occur in an anastomosing pattern such that a network of 
old-growth is interspersed with small stand-replacing fires.  The fire pattern in the southern portion is unlike other old-growth stands on the 
Colorado Plateau and may result from (1) a gradient of soil depth, becoming shallow and sandy in south, supporting relatively light surface and 
canopy fuels, (2) topographic factors that prevent fire spread in southern portions of the plateau, and (3) the influence of climatic patterns.

In May, 2000, Zion National Park implemented a component of their transportation plan which closed Zion Canyon Road to private vehicles 
and allowed access to Zion Canyon only by shuttle buses.  A question arose within the Park as to the impact of closing Zion Canyon Road on 
the pull-outs and their adjacent lands on another park road, which would remain open to private vehicles, the Zion-Mt. Carmel Road.  Just 
prior to the official closing of Zion Canyon road, a recreation impact inventory of pull-outs and their adjacent lands was completed along the 
Zion-Mt. Carmel Road.  The initial inventory of 2000 set the baseline data for recreational impacts along the road and was then followed by 
replications in 2002 and 2004.  All three inventories used the same site variables and included GPS coordinates and digital images.  Site 
variables were developed which related to recreation impacts of the pull-outs and related to recreation impacts of lands adjacent to the pull-
outs.  Beyond basic parameters of surface, length, width, and creep, the inventory collected data on litter, vegetative damage, bank impacts, 
and cryptobiotic impacts.  Adjacent land variables included evidence of recreational activities (trails, campsites, etc.), presence of barren cores 
related to use, fires, litter, human waste, pet waste, vegetative damage, and others.  Over the course of three inventories (2000, 2002, 2004), 
it was found that impacts had increased on the pull-outs.  For example, formal (paved) pull-outs increased by 12.5%; pull-out length increased 
by 5.1 feet; and pull-out width increased by 11-20 feet in 10% of the cases.  In addition, there were increases in litter, human sanitary waste, 
and vegetative damage directly associated with the pull-out.  Beyond the pull-outs, the adjacent lands associated with the pull-outs also felt 
the increase in recreational impacts.  The number of trails, day use sites, streambed access points, and barren cores areas increased over the 
5 years of the project.  In addition, there were increased recreational impacts on the lands adjacent to the pull-outs, such as litter, human 
sanitary waste, vegetative damage, rock impacts, pet impacts, and graffiti.   The results of this study indicate that as parks implement closures 
on park roads and divert private vehicle access to other roads within the park, the incident of recreational impacts along the diversion road 
may, indeed, increase.  While the benefits of the closure of Zion Canyon Road to private vehicles have been significant, the potential for 
impacting another area based on the closure should not be discounted or forgotten.  As with all managerial decisions, there are trade-offs 
inherent to each available option.  The results of this study encourage site managers to consider the recreational impacts of shifting use 
patterns from one resource area to another and the impacts associated with that shifting. 
 
 
ARIZONA’S STATE LAND REFORM INITIATIVE 
 
FOX, EDWARD 
Arizona Public Service Company, Phoenix, AZ, efox@apsc.com  
 
The Arizona constitution limits the state’s ability to plan and dispose of state lands in a way that directs development to the most suitable areas 
and conserves ecologically important lands.  The Arizona State Land Reform Initiative would provide tools and processes to balance growth 
and conservation. It would permanently conserve 260,000 acres of some of the most important natural areas in Arizona, create an educational 
reserve of 73,000 acres and allow an additional 360,000 acres to be purchased for conservation by cities, towns, or nonprofits. The initiative 
also requires the state land department to cooperate with local communities for planning and conservation, and ensure essential classroom 
funding. As one of the key players in the process, I will describe the history of the initiative, how the current initiative differs from the 2004 
version, how ranchers, real estate developers, conservation groups, and school advocates shaped various versions of the initiative, and which 
groups are on-board now.

Current management practices on many National Forests in the southwest call for raking the deep litter and duff accumulation away from the 
base of mature ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) trees before prescribed burns to reduce their mortality.  These mitigation efforts are 
intended to compensate for 100 years of fire suppression that allowed deep litter and duff to accumulate on the forest floor.  In spite of the 
common perception that these efforts will enhance survival of old growth trees, there are few published findings that address whether this 
practice does, in fact, lead to higher survival of mature ponderosa pine trees following fire.  In previous work on the Coconino National Forest, 
Sally Haase has found that leaf blowers cause less damage to root collar bark, cambium, and lateral roots and that removal to 9" lowers 
cambial heating to less than lethal temperatures. Yet, these mitigation efforts may actually cause mortality by exposing lateral roots, are very 
labor intensive, and there is not an agreed upon technique or distance for removing the litter and duff.  We have identified five areas across 
northern Arizona that will be burned in the fall of 2005.  On each area, we permanently marked 60 trees within the burn area and 60 similar 
trees in an adjacent unburned area.  All trees measure at least 18” in diameter at breast height and have at least 4” of accumulated litter at the 
base.  One of four treatments was randomly assigned to each tree: raking litter to a distance of 9”, raking to a distance of 36”, leaf blowing to a 
distance of 9”, and no litter removal.  The effectiveness of these treatments will be measured by testing for live cambium within the first year 
post burn, by measuring a subsample of cambial temperatures during the fire, and by tree mortality 3 years post burn.  Studies such as this 
that control, to the extent possible, other confounding factors that might also contribute to mortality of old trees, are needed to examine 
whether removing litter and duff actually decreases mortality, and if so, what technique and what distance is the most effective.

A floristic survey of two 2200 acre ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) sites was conducted from 2002-2005.  The Kendrick site was 25 miles 
northwest of Flagstaff in the Kaibab National Forest, and the IMAX site was 50 miles southeast of Flagstaff in the Coconino National Forest.  A 
total of 249 vascular plant species were found; 10% of those species (n=26) were exotic to Northern Arizona.  Thirteen percent of the vascular 
plants at the Kendrick site were exotic (22 exotic, 169 total) and the IMAX site was 12% exotic species (19 exotic, 163 total).  Eleven of the 26 
exotic species are cool season grasses and forbs that were intentionally introduced to increase forage quality for livestock and to revegetate 
disturbed sites such as roadsides, log landings, and after wildfires.  This list includes species such as Bromus inermis, Poa pratensis, Elymus 
hispidus, Agropyron pectiniforme, and Melilotus officinale.   The remaining 15 species were probably accidental introductions, and included 
Cirsium vulgare, Polygonum aviculare, Bromus tectorum, B. japonicus, and Convolvulus arvensis.

Hanging gardens are island-like habitats dominated by mesophytic-hydrophytic plant communities, growing on seeps on the xeric canyon 
walls of the Colorado Plateau in the American West.  We measured the abundance of vascular plant species on 73 individual hanging gardens 
during the growing seasons of 1991-1993.  Cluster analysis of a simplified Morisita community similarity index matrix produced four distinct 
clusters of associated herbaceous vegetation: Adiantum capillus-veneris, Aquilegia micrantha, Calamagrostis scopulorum, and Cirsium 
rydbergii Herbaceous Vegetation Associations.  These associations are based on species abundance and are floristically described via stand 
tables showing dominance, constancy, and presence of hanging-garden endemic species.  Two associations were dominated by species 
endemic to hanging gardens:  Aquilegia micrantha and Cirsium rydbergii.  These four hanging garden associations contrast with previous local 
vegetation surveys which place all hanging garden communities into one vegetation type despite the lack of a common dominant or constant 
species.

Although pumas are present throughout Grand Canyon National Park, little is known about their movements and ecology in the Park and 
adjacent areas.  We present initial data from a puma capture and monitoring study in Grand Canyon National Park in northern Arizona. We 
document movement patterns of pumas using portions of the National Park and adjacent public lands. The objectives of this study are: to 
examine puma movements and habitat use in a highly variable topographic landscape, to document puma use of areas of high human activity, 
and to document puma prey selection.  To date four male and three female pumas have been collared and monitored in and around the South 
Rim of the Grand Canyon. Pumas are tracked daily via GPS and VHF transmitters and their movements are mapped using GIS.  Results will 
be applied toward Park planning, land protection, and management in the Grand Canyon eco-region.  Information from this study will be 
incorporated into Park education and outreach programs to increase public understanding of puma ecology and movements.

It is well documented that the climate of the Southwest exhibits high interannual variability, in addition to pronounced multi-decadal variability. 
Interannual precipitation variability is chiefly related to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, whereas multidecadal precipitation variability is related 
to decade-scale ocean variability in the Pacific and Atlantic basins. Millennial-length tree-ring reconstructions of drought and precipitation show 
extensive Southwest drought in virtually every century, with exceptional severe sustained droughts in the mid-1100s, 1200s, late 1500s, 1700s 
and mid-20th century. These reconstructions also show periods of rapid shifts from dry to wet regimes; investigators have related these 
variations to ecological disturbance in Southwest forests. Moreover, reconstructions of drought, precipitation and temperature show a 
tendency for higher aridity to be associated with elevated temperatures. The last point is now of special concern, given the evidence of 
temperature increase-driven climate change in the Arctic and at high altitudes; these changes are well associated with climate model 
predictions. Evidence from the instrumental record of temperature, precipitation, snow, and streamflow shows trends, as well as interannual 
and multi-decadal changes, in western North America, including the Colorado Plateau. Manifestations of trend-related changes in the 
Southwest, which may be related to anthropogenic climate change, are tendencies toward increasing minimum temperatures, earlier snowmelt 

 
46 
and less substantial snowpack. This presentation examines the evidence for past and present climate changes in the Southwest, and 
discusses projected climate changes and their implications for water supply and ecosystem change.

In 2004, CLIMAS initiated a multidisciplinary investigation of regional vulnerability to climate variability and change in northeastern Arizona and 
northwestern New Mexico. The region has been affected by fire and drought and area stakeholders expressed interest in information about 
the climate history of the region. This study compares the underlying climate of the 1947-1956 drought with that of the 1999-2004 drought. 
During winter, the 1999-2004 drought exhibited warmer minimum and maximum temperatures. Although both droughts had below average 
winter precipitation, 1999-2004 snowpack was consistently lower. During summer, minimum temperatures were warmer in 1999-2004, 
whereas maximum temperatures were similar in both periods. Below average summer precipitation was more persistent in 1947-1956. Sea 
surface temperature and ocean/air circulation patterns probably are not sufficient to explain differences in temperature. If temperatures 
continue to increase, enhanced drought effects could have profound regional economic and social impacts as a significant portion of the 
economy is dependent on the ski industry, tourism, and forestry. 
 
 
AN OVERVIEW OF THE ARIZONA CAVE SURVEY 
 
GILLELAND, TOM O. 
Arizona Cave Survey, 4980 North Campbell Ave., Tucson AZ 85718, tom@beachware.com 
 
Historically, most Arizona caves have been successfully managed with a hands-off approach of secrecy and limited access. With the advent of 
GPS technology, increasing human populations, easy to use computer databases, and Internet information distribution, this secrecy based 
resource management philosophy has become ineffective.  As cave location information becomes more widespread, there will be increasing 
pressures on this unique and limited resource. New and proactive management plans will be needed to manage the caves and their important 
biological, archaeological, paleontological, historical and geological resources. The first step to manage a resource is to determine what the 
resource consists of.  The primary goal of the Arizona Cave Survey (ACS) is to gather all information about caves in the state of Arizona.  A 
great deal of information already exists, but due to the historical secrecy ethic, much of the data is not available to qualified researchers and 
land managers.  Through extensive literature searches, caver and land manager communications, and on-site fieldwork, the ACS has 
compiled a great deal of cave data.  Due to the sensitive nature of this information, the ACS will only release information to qualified 
researchers and the actual land managers of specific caves. The compiled cave data consists of a master database of nearly 1,000 Arizona 
Caves, a computer based GIS location plot, a collection of cave maps, digital and hard-copy files on each cave, and a library of Arizona 
cave literature. The Arizona Cave Survey is an on-going project, and as the cave data grows so will the capability to care for this 
unique resource.

This study quantifies patterns of drought mortality for two species of cottonwood trees (narrowleaf cottonwood, Populus angustifolia, and 
Fremont cottonwood, P. fremontii) and their first-generation (F1) hybrid offspring.  Stand dieback was sampled at 46 sites on the Colorado 
Plateau and 20 sites in four parallel drainages of the Mogollon Rim in 2003.  In 2004, three rivers with intact zones of each crosstype were 
sampled to assess within-river patterns.  Hybrid trees performed best both years, demonstrating consistently low mortality and the ability to 
produce new saplings during drought.  Narrowleaf and Fremont cottonwood mortality showed high variability between river systems, 
suggesting greater sensitivity to localized factors.  Narrowleaf cottonwood mortality increased in saline soils and Fremont cottonwood mortality 
increased in areas of high tamarisk (Tamarix sp.) cover.  Fremont cottonwood stands on the Colorado Plateau are far more likely to harbor 
invasive species than narrowleaf cottonwood or hybrid stands, and changes in the abundance and distributions of different cottonwood 
crosstypes can be expected if environmental stress continues.  The effects of invasive plant removal on tree growth is being investigated, to 
determine whether current restoration practices are benefitting native riparian trees.

State Director, The Nature Conservancy in Arizona, 7500 N. Dreamy Draw Drive, Suite 145, Phoenix, AZ 85020, pgraham@tnc.org  
 
The initiative to reform the near century old state trust land laws includes provisions to conserve nearly 700,000 of the 9.3 million acres of 
state trust land.  Three classes of conservation reserve land would be created – permanent, education, and provisional.  The lands were 
selected based on their ecologic, recreation, and open space values through a negotiation process that involved conservation, education, 
development, and cattle grower interests.  Many of these lands contribute to conservation of important aquifers and rivers, wildlife corridors, 
and native grasslands.  This initiative directs development away from these lands to more suitable areas.

Ants can be important ecosystem drivers, and community dynamics of ants can influence and be influenced by disturbances and 
environmental stress.  Ants were collected with pitfall traps from two sites in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument (GSENM) 
Utah, three sites in Canyonlands National Park (CANY), Utah, and four upland shrub-steppe sites, two in southern Utah and two in 
southeastern Oregon.  The GSENM sites were sampled in spring and late summer from 2000 through 2003, both sites had been grazed prior 
to November 1998, one site was closed to grazing in November 1998.  The CANY sites, sampled from 2000 to 2003 in June and September, 
were in Salt Creek Canyon, one was along a 4WD road, one along a section of the road that was closed in July 1998; the third site had not 
had vehicles near it for at least 40 years.  The upland sites were trapped once each year, in 2000 and 2001, in spring, and were centered 
around livestock watering sources; ants were sampled at 5 (in 2000) or 6 (2001) distances from the water sources.  Traps were open for four 
days each session, sites varied in number of times traps were opened each year. Specimens were identified to genus and assigned to 
functional groups. The alluvial bench sites in Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument and riparian sites in Canyonlands each had 13 
genera represented, upland Utah sites had a total of 11 genera, while only nine genera were trapped in Oregon upland sites.  Proportional 
representation of genera and functional groups varied among sites and over time within sites.  Differences in community structure resulted 
from latitude, landscape position, year, season and disturbance regime.  Implications for using ants to monitor ecosystem condition will be 
discussed.

Salt Creek, Canyonlands National Park, is an interrupted stream with more aquatic and mesic riparian habitat than any canyon in the park 
except the Green and Colorado Rivers.  Salt Creek was used by vehicles for at least 50 years; in 1998, 14 km of the road was closed by a 
Federal judge, providing an opportunity to track recovery of the riparian ecosystems after decades of vehicle disturbance.  We began to 
describe and compare invertebrate communities in the open-, closed-, and no-road segments of the caZon in 2000.  Here we report on the 
Orthoptera from one site in each segment, sampled in June and September 2000-2003, to determine whether there were consistent patterns 
among the Orthoptera related to either disturbance history or the intensifying drought that occurred during the study.  It was hypothesized that 
over the years the closed road site would more closely resemble the no road site.  Results show that the closed road site more closely 
resembles the open road site. Abundance of Gryllus species showed the greatest differences between caZon segments; other taxa show 
trends as well, but total numbers are small.  Differences between the no-road samples and open- and closed-road samples are due at least in 
part to inherent differences in the character of the caZon upstream (no-road) and downstream (open- and closed-road).  Lack of difference 
between open- and closed-road sites may be due to slow recovery because of drought conditions experienced during the years of sample 
collection.

Prescribed fire as a method of forest restoration and fuels reduction is an increasingly utilized technique in southwestern ponderosa pine 
forests.  However, little is known about the effects of these treatments on wildlife communities.  In a landscape-scale experiment, we 
examined the numerical response of two woodpecker species to prescribed fire treatments on four National Forest sites in Arizona and New 
Mexico.  We used four years of pre- and post-treatment data to detect changes in woodpecker abundance and occupancy.  We found that 
after the implementation of prescribed fire there was an increase in the number and spatial use of individuals detected on treatment units, and 

 
48 
that these responses could be tied to burn severity. Our results suggest that the short-term response of woodpeckers to prescribed fire could 
serve as an indicator of forest health, and as such could influence management decisions regarding prescribed fire.

Fossil Creek provides an excellent site to study the relative effects of physical and biotic habitat modification on native fish communities.  
Water releases through the streambed have been regulated by a hydropower project for >90 years and create a unique gradient of water 
quality and stream morphology characteristics along the stream.  Additionally, nonnative, green sunfish and smallmouth bass have actively 
invaded the stream until management actions in late 2004.  We studied the native and nonnative fish community composition at 14 sites in 
Fossil Creek to look at patterns of distribution.  At seven of these sites we correlated physical habitat parameters (discharge, depth, travertine 
deposition, water chemistry and temperature) with community composition to see which physical habitat variables were responsible for 
structuring fish communities.  Additionally, we studied the trophic structure of the fish community using stable isotopes (
13C and 
15N) at three 
sites to look at the relative effects of hydrology and nonnative fish on food web structure.  The distribution of both communities was primarily a 
function of distinct waterfall barriers in the stream and not water quality or other habitat variables.  Nonnative fish increased in relative 
abundance and species richness in a gradient downstream from Fossil Springs to the Verde River.  Biotic interactions with nonnative species 
affected native communities.  Abundance of native fish (especially small-bodied fish declined with increasing relative abundance of 
nonnatives.  Stable isotopes analysis indicated that native fishes were top predators in portions of the stream without nonnative fish, feeding 
mainly on invertebrates.  However, in the presence of nonnatives, trophic position of natives was lower, and diet was restricted to a smaller 
portion of available invertebrate taxa.  Our findings indicate that nonnative taxa were having a larger effect on native fish communities in Fossil 
Creek than stream water diversion.  While, restoration of flows will help restore ecosystem processes within the stream, management and 
removal of nonnative taxa are a necessary part of the restoration process in this stream.

Recreation use and users of Fossil Creek in northern Arizona were studied to gather baseline data as part of a long-term monitoring effort to 
document changes in recreation use and users following removal of the Fossil Creek Dam and reintroduction of full flows.  The monitoring 
program included two projects:  1) a visitor survey to gather information on visitor demographics, activities, experiences realized, reasons for 
visiting, responses to proposed recreation management strategies, and their interest in environmental stewardship and 2) a campsite impact 
and monitoring effort begun by the Forest Service wherein campsites and other use concentration areas were mapped and permanent 
resource condition monitoring plots established.  A combination on-site and mail-back survey was used to gather information from Fossil 
Creek visitors between August and December 2004.  A total of 170 completed questionnaires were obtained.   Results showed that Fossil 
Creek visitors were primarily from Arizona, the Phoenix area in particular.  The most important reasons identified for visiting included viewing 
the scenery, enjoying nature, seeing Fossil Creek, and getting away from life’s demands.  Popular activities included sightseeing, walking, 
swimming, hiking, and wading.  Visitors were generally supportive of removal of non-native fish and removal of the dam to restore full flows.  
Support for proposed changes in recreation management of Fossil Creek varied, with visitors showing less support for allowing only day use 
on the upper section of Fossil Creek but supported allowing camping only in designated dispersed sites in the middle section of Fossil Creek.  
The campsite impact and monitoring program was originally conducted on 41 riparian area campsites.  As a result of spring flooding a number 
of sites were destroyed and the final number of sites inventoried was 17.  Permanent sampling plots were established where vegetation cover, 
amount of bare ground, and species present were among the data gathered.  The campsite inventory is being expanded to include sites in the 
pinyon-juniper benches above the creek.  Both the visitor survey and the campsite inventory will continue as part of the recreation monitoring 
effort on Fossil Creek and will continue to be done in collaboration with the U.S. Forest Service.

The vegetation of the three National Monuments east of Flagstaff - Sunset Crater, Walnut Canyon, and Wupatki - is diverse and reflects the 
broad geomorphic, geologic, and topographic diversity of the area.  Recently the US Geologic Survey Southwest Biological Science Center, 
the Bureau of Reclamation Remote Sensing and GIS Group, and Nature Serve jointly completed vegetation mapping at all three park units as 
part of the USGS-NPS Vegetation Mapping Program.  Plant communities were described using the evolving National Vegetation Classification 
System (NVC) and included barren, sparse, grassland, shrubland, dwarf-shrubland, steppe, woodland, and forest lifeforms.  A total of 41 NVC 
alliances, 55 associations, eight local communities, and seven unique stands were described and mapped using 59 map labels.  These 
projects are the first of the 19 parks in the National Park Service Southern Colorado Plateau Network to be mapped using the NVC standards 
for describing vegetation.  Mapping and vegetation descriptions were initiated in 1999 and completed in 2004; the resulting data are currently 
being used for landscape management activities at the monuments.  Products include a final project report and a suite of digital products 
including: vegetation classification descriptions, land-use classification system, vegetation classification key, digital and hard copy vegetation

Previous studies of Fossil Creek suggest greater primary production rates and greater decomposition rates in the travertine dam reach than in 
free-flowing reaches below the diversion dam, providing more energy to support the food web in the travertine dam reach. Leaf litter is an 
important allochthonous energy input, both during the growing season when riparian vegetation shades the creek and after autumn leaf-fall. 
Using litter bags, we determined decomposition rates for two leaf species at distinct study sites along the travertine gradient. Decomposition 
rates varied significantly between leaf species and between travertine dam and free-flowing study sites. Differing decomposition rates may 
correspond with different microbial communities along the gradient. We are now characterizing the microbial communities present on leaf litter 
samples, targeting the bacterial, archaeal, and fungal components. We are using the Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism 
(TRFLP) molecular approach to generate community profiles for each treatment. Initial results suggest that fungal community composition 
varies primarily with study site location, while bacterial community composition varies with leaf species. TRFLP analysis of individual clones 
from prepared libraries will enable us to assign tentative identities within the community profiles. Future research is planned to determine if 
dam decommissioning and stream recovery corresponds with alterations in microbial community structure; the current work will provide 
baseline data for those studies.

Transportation planning is one of the most significant challenges facing the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the National Park Service 
(NPS) as the agencies develop a management plan for the Arizona Strip Resource Area.  The plan determines the direction of management, 
including transportation management, for the next twenty years at two monuments – Grand Canyon-Parashant and Vermilion Cliffs.  The role 
of roads and other transportation routes for recreation and public safety access must be balanced against the responsibility to protect the 
area’s resources – including the wildlife.  A large body of scientific studies indicates that roads can have significant negative effects on wildlife 
species in the Arizona Strip monuments.  A spatial analysis of the area was conducted to assess the potential effects that two different 
transportation systems are likely to have on habitat for five wildlife species – the desert tortoise, mountain lion, bighorn sheep, pronghorn, and 
mule deer.   The transportation systems are the BLM’s Route Inventory and the Conservation Route Proposal, a network supported by the 
Arizona conservation community.  Landscape fragmentation metrics were measured for the entire landscape and within wildlife habitat 
boundaries for each of the route networks.  A comparison of results with biological field literature describing road impacts on wildlife suggests 
that impacts to all five species are significant for the BLM Route Inventory.  The Conservation Route Proposal presented less overall impact to 
wildlife, while failing to provide sufficient habitat for some of the selected species, desert tortoise in particular.  Specific transportation 
management recommendations were crafted based on the findings.   A few examples include: provide large blocks of core habitat more than a 
mile from a road within desert tortoise habitat, reduce road mileage in mountain lion habitat to densities less than 1 mi/mi
2, and use landscape 
fragmentation metrics to guide management decisions regarding transportation routes for wildlife species within the monuments.

Contemporary human use of a place of prehistoric activity can alter if not destroy remains that have been assigned public value. Sites with 
prehistoric architectural remains are those most commonly disturbed in the area surrounding McPhee Reservoir in southwest Colorado. This 
study used exploratory procedures to (1) assess whether associations exist between a set of characteristics of a prehistoric site and evidence 
of modern activities at that place; (2) ascertain how evidence of subsurface “looting” varies with site characteristics; and (3) assess the 
vulnerability of sites to contemporary human activities during exposure after periods of inundation. Four categorical variables reflecting modern 
activities were used with five prehistoric site descriptors to describe the relationships between the remains of human activities in the past and 
present at 29 sites. Over half of these sites have been subjected to subsurface digging and eleven of the 32 sites examined have been 
subjected to inundation at some time since 1986. This study resulted in the construction of testable predictions oriented toward gaining insight 
into how and where contemporary visitors to the area use places of prehistoric activity. Using a small sample of sites an analytical framework 
was pursued that can be used with expanded data and with refined categorical variables to enhance management protection as well as further 
interest in contemporary recreational behavior at places on the landscape used by humans in prehistory.

Land managers at Wupatki National Monument in northern Arizona, USA have become increasingly concerned about expansion of one-seed 
juniper (Juniperus monosperma (Engelm.) Sarg.) into the semi-arid grassland ecosystem.  We quantified these trends by means of 
dendrochronological analysis across multiple geologic formations within and south of the Monument on the Coconino National Forest. Juniper 
size attributes (height, drip line, diameter at root collar) of all trees in experimental plots were measured. A root collar cross section of one tree 
from each of four size classes were removed from each plot for dendrochronological analysis. Tree size was then correlated to tree age, thus 
allowing the estimation of the age of all measured trees with minimal tree destruction.  Juniper trees became established in the young juniper 
"savanna" stands (past grasslands) within the Monument within the last 150 years on most geologic formations, but growth and survival rates 
were highly variable depending on microclimate.  In these past grassland areas, trees of all ages were found to be equally susceptible to 
wildfire-induced mortality, with an average of 58% mortality.  Thus we conclude that regular, high-severity fires are necessary to repel juniper, 
which acts as an invasive species in the absence of fire, altering the ecological trajectory towards savanna and woodland conditions.  
Prescribed fire can therefore be an effective management tool for maintaining grassland and open savanna conditions.  Conversely, denser, 
juniper and juniper-pinyon woodland stands on the adjacent National Forest appear to have been established for 700 years or more, first 
becoming established after the eruption of the nearby Sunset Crater and subsequent intensive Anasazi occupation of the area.  Little evidence 
of low severity surface fires was found in these areas, though many instances of a single or small number of trees killed by a highly-localized, 
presumably lightning-ignited fire were observed.  Therefore, it seems that the fire regime of these older juniper woodlands has not been 
significantly altered by fire suppression and grazing in the last 150 years.  Subsequently, there is no ecologically-based motivation for thinning, 
prescribed fire or other high-intensity “restoration” activities and management of these stands.

Fossil Creek is a tributary to the Verde River in central Arizona. In 1999, after nearly a century of diverting Fossil Creek’s flow for hydropower, 
Arizona Public Service (APS) committed to decommissioning two power plants and restoring full flows to the stream channel. Prior to flow 
restoration, biologists recognized the opportunity to restore the stream’s native fish community. Fossil Creek remains a last stronghold for 
native fish in the entire Gila River drainage, yet invasion of exotic species has prevented recruitment in native aquatic vertebrates, including 
ranid frogs. In a collaborative effort between state and federal agencies, including two national forests, universities; and many volunteers, a 
native fish fauna was salvaged from over 10 stream miles which included designated wilderness. Piscicide was applied to the stream and 
native fishes were repatriated after exotic fishes appeared to be eliminated. A barrier was constructed to prevent future invasions while 
simultaneously preserving wilderness values. The philosophical outcome of this project was a renewed sense of what can be accomplished 
when agency mandates to protect native species are supported and conflicting politics are set aside. It also instilled hope and generated 
excitement for other fish restoration projects in the desert Southwest that were once considered unachievable due to logistical or political 
constraints.

We used radiotelemetry to locate roosts of spotted bats (Euderma maculatum) in the Colorado River drainage, Canyon de Chelly, and other 
locations in northwestern Arizona from June - August, 1999 and 2005.   In 1999, we attached transmitters to two male spotted bats.  In 2005, 
we attached transmitters to six female and five male spotted bats, including five temperature sensitive transmitters.  Tagged bats retained their 
transmitters for 7 to 16 days (life of transmitter).  We used fixed and mobile ground stations, as well as aerial telemetry to determine 
approximate locations for 13 day roosts.  Due to the extremely rugged nature of the terrain, including 400 m vertical cliffs, most roost locations 
were approximated to within a 0.5 km area.  Roost sites were in cracks and crevices in Coconino sandstone in the upper third of vertical cliff 
faces at Vermillion Cliffs, Marble Canyon (Upper Colorado River), Trail Canyon (Lower Colorado River), Ft Pierce Wash, and Canyon de 
Chelly.  None of the telemetered bats appeared to use caves, though cave and karst features are abundant in these areas.  Nor did any of the 
telemetered bats appear to roost with other telemetered bats.  At least 2 of the radio-telemetered female bats used two roosts.  Three to four 
days after radiotagging, a nonreproductive female moved 31 km to a new roost. A pregnant female moved 13 km. No bats used more than two 
roosts during any of the tracking periods.  Length of stay at a roost ranged from 4 to 15 days (duration of study).  Data from temperature 
sensitive transmitters indicated variation in body temperature among individuals.  Most bats with temperature sensitive transmitters exhibited 
reduced body/environmental temperature within one hour after entering the day roost.

 Hybrid poplar (Populus spp.) is recognized as one of the fastest growing temperate tree species in North America, capable of producing 
marketable material in short rotations of 3-15 years.  Hybrid poplar grown in the Four Corners region could provide a wide range of benefits 
such as solid wood and fiber products, fuel wood, biofuel feedstock, and sequestered carbon.  Additionally, poplar uses water at a rate 
comparable to alfalfa and provides numerous environmental benefits including wildlife habitat, erosion control, and augmented soil carbon.  
During May 2002, ten poplar clones were planted at the NMSU Agricultural Science Center in Farmington, NM and were irrigated via a low-
pressure drip system at rates sufficient to replace daily evapotranspiration (ET).  Total irrigation as precipitation equivalent was 635, 686, and 
762 mm for 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively.  These values are all lower than the recommended seasonal application for alfalfa in the 
region (1,270 mm).  The trees were evaluated over three years for growth potential, chlorosis, and survival.   Clone OP-367 had 100% survival 
and showed the greatest growth potential, producing 26 m3 ha-1 of wood during the initial three years.  Five other clones had 95% or better 
survival, of which two clones, 58-280 and 311-93, produced more than 10 m3 ha-1 of wood.  Initial results led to the May 2004 installation of a 
40-ha plantation at the Navajo Agricultural Products Industry (NAPI) utilizing the top-producing clones.  NAPI is now growing wood for regional 
fiber markets, while also providing wildlife and conservation benefits.  During a ten-year rotation, the NAPI plantation could potentially 
sequester approximately 140 metric tons of carbon per hectare, based on the projected growth of OP-367.  The expansion of similar projects 
can mitigate CO2 emissions from fossil fuel production and use on the Colorado Plateau

Although National Park Service areas contain some of the best examples of native ecosystems, they also contain disturbed areas in need of 
restoration.  Some of the areas may not be restorable due to the inability to remove the stressors (e.g. dammed rivers).  Other sites may be 
restorable but require differing levels of effort to approach a reference or desired condition.  Sites also vary as to ecological and social value.  
The National Park Service desires to direct resources towards restoring the sites of highest value and those with the highest feasibility of 
success.  Thus, we are developing a decision support tool to help prioritize sites within a large park, a cluster of parks, or a region based upon 
site value, past and present land use, and feasibility of restoration.  A “strawman” tool has been tested in disturbed riparian areas in the 
Eastern Deciduous Forest, California Coast, Northern Great  Plains and the Colorado Plateau.  The tool includes 60 indicators of departure 
from desired condition.  Variables are soil condition, hydrology, erosion, ecosystem processes, native vegetation, and invasive plants.  
Separate shells address stressors (past, present, and future) and site value.  Validation of indicator accuracy was part of the tool testing.  A 
team and adaptive approach is being employed to refine the tool.   Most importantly, the project team includes the end users.  We will report 
on test results to date, next steps, and desired final product. 
 
 
BIRDS OF THE COLORADO RIVER IN GRAND CANYON: A SYNTHESIS OF STATUS, TRENDS, AND DAM OPERATION EFFECTS 
 
Holmes, Jennifer, John Spence, MARK SOGGE 
 
This presentation summarizes the considerable information available from recent studies on the ecology of Grand Canyon bird species and 
communities. Because changes in riparian habitat undoubtedly influence the abundance and distribution of Grand Canyon birds, the 
presentation starts by briefly examining dam-induced habitat alterations that may affect birds. The direct and indirect effects of Glen Canyon 
Dam operations, including the modified low fluctuating flow (MLFF) alternative that was implemented starting in 1996, are considered for how 
they influence specific bird species and communities. Particular attention is given to species of special concern, including the southwestern 
willow flycatcher (Empidonax traillii extimus), California condor (Gymnogyps californianus), bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), and 
American peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus anatum). The session concludes with a summary and a discussion of research priorities within 
the context of the Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program.

The water regime of the Colorado Plateau has changed dramatically within the last century. Drought and human land use have reduced 
availability of naturally-occurring water. Ambient temperatures have increased, resulting in shorter seasonal durations of accessible water 
accompanied by reductions of snowpack and earlier spring run-off. In response, artificially created waters, including stock tanks and wildlife 
water developments, have been built throughout the Southwest to mitigate reductions in natural waters and provide perennial water to 
livestock and game species. Resource managers remain in need of information about the ecological effects of artificial waters, to assess 
potential effects on wildlife. In August of 2004, we began deploying remote camera units at natural and artificial waters around Wupatki and 
Walnut Canyon National Monuments in north-central Arizona to monitor water availability and patterns of use by mid- to large-sized mammals 
along boundaries of these Monuments. To date, we have 16 cameras monitoring 7 natural and 9 artificial water sources. We also recorded 
snow cover, when present, and measured moisture content in vegetation, bimonthly, to assess the availability of pre-formed water. To date, 
we have photo-documented thousands of wildlife events, including several hundred instances of target species using artificial and natural 
water sources. Preliminary results suggest that when both natural and artificial water sources are available, mid- to large-sized mammals use 
artificial water sources more frequently than nearby natural water sources. Patterns of interspecific use at artificial water sources vary among 
different subsets of ecologically similar species, including both considerable overlap among mesopredators and exclusion between some 
herbivores, such as domestic cattle and pronghorn (Antilocapra americana). With increasing moisture content of vegetation, animal detections 
at water sources decrease, suggesting a reliance on pre-formed water.  We plan to continue monitoring water availability and wildlife activity at 
water sources for an additional year, with a final report on the project completed in late 2006. 
 
 
DIGGING IN THE DARK:  CULTURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IN GRAND CANYON'S CAVES

Grand Canyon National Park, PO Box 129, Grand Canyon AZ 86023, amy_horn@nps.gov 
 
Grand Canyon National Park contains an estimated 1,000 caves.  The NPS has documented 335 caves.  Of these, approximately 50 contain 
recorded archeological remains.  Known cultural resources include 4,000 year old split-twig figurines, protohistoric arrow shafts, baskets, and 
even artifacts that document the historic use and exploration of caves.  However, hundreds of caves lack inventories.   The limited inventory 
and monitoring of caves and their resources, combined with the remote location of most caves, presents a challenge to the effective 
management of these cave resources.  Recent impacts to cultural resources include theft, campfires, camping, and general visitation.  This 
paper discusses the challenges and opportunities in managing the cultural resources of Grand Canyon’s caves.

Illegal removal of wood from visitor sites within Petrified Forest National Park (PEFO) remains a long-standing concern of park managers.  A 
series of research studies over the past decade, by the authors and other investigators, has been undertaken to document non-compliant 
visitor behavior in the form of the unauthorized collection of petrified wood.  Some of these studies also have sought to explain the motives of 
visitors’ variable compliance with park rules and communications regarding visitor behavior appropriate to minimize impacts on park 
resources.  One study resulted in population estimates of 10–12 tons of petrified wood being illegally removed from a sum of visitor sites 
during a one-year period.   The study, however, did not distinguish between petrified wood taken out of the park, and that remaining within the 
park as the result of displacement by visitors to other park locations.  In order to quantify the amount of wood internally displaced, its location 
before and after displacement, and the amount removed from the park, a three-year study was begun in 2004.  The study uses two quite 
different research approaches, each designed to provide complimentary results in answering the research questions.   A self-administered 
questionnaire was designed to gather information on the travel patterns of 750 visitors within the park over a one-year period, under the 
assumption that petrified wood may be displaced in similar patterns.  Over  the same period, removal and deposit of petrified wood on 240 
fixed-plots is being monitored at park sites where visitors have unsupervised access to wood.  Additional monitoring is done of road ditches 
known to be regular depositories of discarded wood.  All wood of souvenir size within plots has been invisibly marked with material having a 
unique spectral signature, thus establishing the origin of marked deposits found in the fixed plots and road ditches.  Preliminary results from 
the on-going study suggest visitor travel patterns within the park are fairly regularized, with visits to certain sites and the sequence of visits 
being rather predictable.  Results from the fixed-plot monitoring are less definitive owing to the lack of a full monitoring cycle and resulting 
small sample size.  Wood displacement trends from the latest plot data are described and evaluated as intermediate results of the study.

ECTOMYCORRHIZAL DIVERSITY OF STRESSED PINYON PINES 
 
HUBERT, NATE, Kristin Haskins, Rebecca Mueller 
 
Northern Arizona has recently experienced the adverse effects of severe drought. Mortality of native conifers, including pinyon pine, has been 
observed at the landscape scale. Ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi may buffer trees from drought stress by increasing the uptake of water and 
nutrients.  Theoretical models have been proposed that predict the dynamics of EM species richness, but the real contribution of EM diversity 
to ecosystem stability and resilience remains largely unknown. The pinyon-juniper woodlands of northern Arizona offer an excellent 
opportunity to study the effect of fungal symbiont diversity on host plant performance, because pinyon pine is the only EM host plant at these 
sites. The diversity and relative abundance of EM fungal species belonging to the divisions Ascomycota and Basidiomycota have been shown 
to indicate host-related biotic stress, such as plant competition and parasitism; and abiotic stress such as drought, slope, cardinal aspect and 
soil quality. Thus, there is great potential for land management via manipulation of the EM fungal community. Future research should focus on 
1) the ecological function of common symbionts, 2) changes in plant-mycorrhizal diversity as a measure of forest condition, and 3) managing 
mycorrhizal communities towards conservation and restoration efforts.

One-seeded juniper encroachment into southern Colorado Plateau Grasslands has been an ecological concern for natural resource 
management at Wupatki National Monument for the past few decades.  Woody species encroachment into grasslands has been documented 
throughout the world and attributed to a variety of casual factors such as overgrazing, fire suppression, carbon dioxide fertilization, and  
natural cyclic variability.  Using modeling techniques, incorporating hierarchy theory and conceptual modeling, we explore the potential 
changes in suitable climate distribution for one-seeded juniper using a global climate model scenario for the 21
st Century.   The modeling 
approach uses CLIMLIM, a program which ranks climatic factors for their influence on species distributions.  Then, the most important climatic 
factors are used as independent variables to create a maximum likelihood probability surface using ArcGIS software.  We measured the 
relative change between simulated present and simulated 2XCO2 climates from the CCM3 AOGCM model on a ~75 km grid and then 
projected these changes to a ~1 km grid of present day climates.  The resulting 2XCO2 climate values on the ~ 1 km grid created a data 
surface with sufficient resolution to assess local landscape-level impacts of potential climate change.  Ecological characteristics along with 
paleoecological information from packrat midden fossil research were used to create a hierarchical conceptual model that was incorporated 
into a least cost path analysis in Arc GIS.  The results of this modeling exercise were then compared to recent trends in the changes of one 
seeded juniper distribution observed in aerial photography from 1936 to the present.  The modeling resulted in a general trend of one-seeded 
juniper shifting up in latitude and down in elevation towards many areas currently inhabited by grasslands, using a future GCM scenario.  This 
general trend also is present in the aerial imagery from 1936 to the present.  The modeling exercise demonstrates that observed ongoing 
changes in one-seeded juniper distribution can be simulated from entirely independent GCM climate modeling.  Although the one-seeded 
juniper is just beginning to invade its 2XCO2 climate range, it seems that it is already changing along its future predicted trajectory.

Since its passage in 1973, the Endangered Species Act has become a symbol of our nation’s commitment to conserving America’s imperiled 
biodiversity.  Because of the Act, future generations will be able to enjoy that plants and animals such as wolves, grizzly bears, manatees and 
our nation’s symbol, the bald eagle.  The Act has an impressive success rate: just nine of the more than 1,800 species protected by the Act 
since its passage have been declared extinct.  Despite this, there have been many calls to change the Act.  In August 2005, a new draft ESA 
reform began circulating in the House Resources Committee that contained seven proposals to drastically change the federal effort to help 
endangered species.  One change would allow many major development projects to avoid the need to consult with Fish & Wildlife Service or 
write a Habitat Conservation Plan to accommodate needs of listed species.  Another “sunset clause” would cause the ESA to expire in 2015.  
After this draft was leaked to the press, an outcry erupted and the draft was withdrawn. However, Richard Pombo, Chair of the Resources 
Committee, is likely to promote other major changes to the ESA in the current Congress.   This presentation will describe the latest legislative 
proposals related to our core environmental laws, and strategies to keep this seminal conservation law strong and functional.

Forest managers around the world are being challenged by large-scale landscape changes triggered by multi-year to multi-decade climatic 
fluctuations. These disturbances alter the environmental balance and reset the ecological clock over hundreds of thousands of acres.  
Ecological responses to these large-scale disturbances will dictate the face of the land for the next century or more. Despite efforts by 
climatologists and ecologists to provide new perspectives and knowledge to address these resource management challenges, natural 
resources managers find it difficult to incorporate long-term climate information into their management plans.  As a first step to address the 
need for understandable, practical, and applicable scientific information on the potential impacts of climate variability and change, University of 
Arizona Cooperative Extension (UACE) held a workshop in February, 2005, that brought together climate change scientists, ecologists, 
educators and natural resource managers. Using an innovative approach developed by UACE, the workshop explored the concerns of natural 
resources managers, and fostered dialogue and collaboration between managers (end-users of scientific knowledge), cooperative extension 
agents and specialists (interpreters and disseminators of scientific knowledge), and leading scientists (producers of scientific knowledge). The 
workshop covered the state of knowledge about the following climate-induced ecosystem changes through plenary talks and breakout 
discussions: insect-related disturbance, woody vegetative response to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide fertilization, forest vegetation 
recruitment, dispersal, and survivorship, wildfire intensity and frequency, shifts in invasive species’ populations and dispersal, implications for 
grazing on forest lands, and spatial scales of climate-induced change.  Workshop participants engaged in lively discussion and contributed 
ideas that will be synthesized into topical UACE fact sheets for land managers. Key results of the workshop with ramifications for climate-
induced ecosystem impacts include: the science talks can be more effective by better connecting research conclusions with specific 
management situations and potential management actions; managers need “hard numbers” on documented climate-induced ecosystem 
responses; region-specific climate change scenarios are needed for managers to develop practical management options; and the complexity 
of climate change and ecosystems’ response requires increased interaction and partnership between scientists and managers, facilitated by 
extension educators, for effective communication. For more information, see http://cals.arizona.edu/climate/ws/climchg/sedona05.htm. 
 
 
RECREATIONAL VALUES AND CAMPSITES IN THE COLORADO RIVER ECOSYSTEM 
 
KAPLINSKI, MATTHEW, Jeff Behan, Joseph Hazel, Roderic Parnell, Helen Fairley 
 
This talk presents an assessment of the current state of knowledge concerning the impacts of Glen Canyon Dam operations on the changing 
condition of campsite areas and sandbars and the implications of physical changes of the Grand Canyon ecosystem for visitor capacity and 
quality of experience. After defining the study area and some key concepts, the presentation briefly reviews the relationships between the 
condition and extent of Colorado River sandbars and the quality of the visitor recreation experience. An overview of historical status and 
trends of the number and size of campsites along the Colorado River is followed by a summary of recent findings. Discussion focuses on the 
effects of the modified low fluctuating flow (MLFF) alternative and high-volume experimental flows on campsite area. The session concludes 
with an evaluation of these results relative to the stated recreation goals and management objectives of the Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive 
Management Program (GCDAMP).

After three years of integrated sampling of vegetation, arthropods, herpetofauna, breeding birds and small mammals in riparian habitats of the 
Colorado River corridor of Grand Canyon National Park, several patterns emerged.  First, trend analysis showed a decline in both vegetation 
and avifaunal abundances.  Vegetation trends were in addition to effects of regulated flow and precipitation.  Declines in breeding bird 
densities may be due to declines in vegetation abundance, but are likely also affected by factors outside of the breeding area.  Second, 
arthropod abundances are not tied to overall vegetation abundance, but individual taxonomic and feeding groups are tied to different individual 
plant species.  Third, vegetation is a poor surrogate for habitat quality for herpetofauna and small mammals.  And fourth, sampling of habitat 
patches, delineated by investigators, does not always capture important habitat features.

Revitalizing essential cultural practices and traditional food systems is a major priority on the Colorado Plateau. Many Native American 
communities are now experiencing epidemic rates of nutrition related diseases, like diabetes, with the erosion of traditional farming practices. 
At Hopi, the last fifty years has brought a decline in the once strong and vibrant food system. This food system consists of many culturally 
critical and healthy foods that have sustained people for centuries. In 2004 interests to restore the once productive farming area located at 
Wepo springs, materialized when community members formed a work party to dig out the spring in order to get water flowing into the fields. 
The Wepo site is an example of current efforts to rebuild the local food system from the ground up by restoring the springs, garden terraces, 
orchards and wet lands to rekindle community interest in farming and visiting the area. During the summer of 2005 restoration work continues 
with the addition of summer Wepo youth farming program. Youth learn about traditional farming practices, native plant uses, and the cultural 
history of the area. One of the main focuses of the summer program is to bring awareness of the Hopi food system and culture to the youth. 
Bringing students to the outdoor classroom is an important place to interact and learn from elders, while being involved with a culturally 
relevant style of education that is essential to learning about their culture. The summer farming project has inspired youth to become involved 
with agriculture and learn more about how their culture connects them to their surroundings. The accomplishments at Wepo have spurred 
interest in the community to restore other agricultural sites and create additional ways to involve youth with their food and heritage. 
 
 
AQUATIC ECOLOGY: THE ROLE OF ORGANIC MATTER AND INVERTEBRATES  
 
KENNEDY, THEODORE, Steven Gloss 
 
This talk describes the results of the research and monitoring activities that have investigated the kinds of organic matter and invertebrate 
communities in the Colorado River below Glen Canyon Dam. Collectively, organic matter and the aquatic invertebrates that consume it largely 
constitute the food base for fish in the Colorado River ecosystem. This discussion focuses on patterns, trends, and important controls on the 
amount and sources of organic matter and invertebrates that are primary food resources for humpback chub (Gila cypha) and rainbow trout 
(Oncorhynchus mykiss) in an effort to understand the role that food plays in determining the distribution, population density, and growth of 
these fish in this ecosystem. This session also addresses how organic matter and invertebrates are affected by the timing and magnitude of 
water releases from Glen Canyon Dam, including the modified low fluctuating flow (MLFF) alternative, which was implemented in 1996 and 
continues as the operating regime for Glen Canyon Dam today. Finally, this session concludes with a brief discussion of possible research 
directions and management actions. 
 
 
CAVES – EXPANDING BEYOND THE HOLLOW PLACES

Promoting ethics and clarifying the reasons for conservation and the imperative need for research and understanding caves as systems is not 
within the scope of our existing laws, which makes it imperative that agencies and scientists working in or managing caves need to go beyond 
the hollow portion of a cave and assure that the caves are understood as systems.  More and more attention is being focused on outdoor 
activities, especially those which are deemed to fall within the so-called “extreme sports” area. Caves are viewed in recent magazine articles, 
television programs and movies as places where one can practice “extreme” activities with seemingly no regard for the resource. The people 
involved in the “extreme” sports arena seem to lack an understanding of conservation ethic and, if any at all, an extreme misunderstanding of 
caves and karst systems.  Without an understanding that caves are the result of natural processes that are not magical, mysterious, or 
supernatural, but that conform to a series of measurable geological and biological actions, a conservation ethic can never be expected from 
these particular users of caves. While we have laws that help protect caves and their contents including the Federal Cave Resources Act of 
1988 and various state laws, none of the current laws place priority on the need to understand caves and the processes by which they are 
created. No current legislation insures that caves will be considered in terms of environmental ethics. The important work of establishing an 
acceptable conservation and research protocol ethic must be accomplished one step at a time by patient speleologists who have devoted their 
energies to speleological research, education, and public outreach. There have been many positive changes over the last 35 years-changes 
accomplished by the persistent spirits of individual and collective speleologists who think beyond the hollow spaces.

The Colorado Plateau is in the midst of a severe drought with significant impacts on ecosystems (desert shrub to conifer forest). There have 
been extensive mortality and bark beetle insect populations in conjunction with the multi-year drought.  We analyzed and then mapped various 
remotely-sensed drought indicators across a series of ecosystems from desert shrub, grassland, pinyon-juniper, and Ponderosa pine with 
Airborne Visible Infra-Red Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data flown across the C. Hart Merriam Transect in northern Arizona in July and 
October of 2003.  The AVIRIS instrument is a hyperspectral optical sensor that delivers calibrated images in 224 contiguous spectral bands 
with wavelengths from 400 to 2500 nanometer and nearly 5m spatial resolution.  This hyperspectral sensors affords opportunities to assess 
canopy chemistry within the drought stricken ecosystems.  The various indicators used to assess drought impacts included ‘greenness’, soil, 

 
56 
shadow, and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) obtained using a linear mixture model.  We also utilized combined chlorophyll- and water-
based index relationships as surrogates for canopy water status per unit of leaf area index.  We found tree mortality sites exhibited high NPV 
and soil signals accompanied with low ‘greenness’. The water indices in conjunction with chlorophyll indices provided measures of fuel 
moisture status, fire vulnerability, and drought status.  Significant differences in slope-based relationships describing the quantity of canopy 
moisture per unit level of chlorophyll (or greenness) were found between dates (dry and wet seasons), across ecosystems, and with drought 
impact.  Our preliminary results show that ecosystem health and drought impact response to climate change and human land cover 
modifications can be characterized using remote sensing.

Tree-ring and meteorological data have indicated that 2000 and especially 2002 were the most severe drought years in over 400 years in the 
Southwest U.S., and resulted in extensive tree and shrub mortality. We conducted a study within the ponderosa pine/pinyon-juniper ecotone of 
northern Arizona to assess the extent of woody plant dieback and mortality that occurred during this drought. Our objectives were to determine 
if tree and shrub condition varied among sites of different soil parent materials (SPMs), and if condition varied among species at a common 
SPM. Our study sites were located within the Coconino National Forest at elevations ranging from 1790 to 2105 m and occurred at SPMs that 
differed in soil texture and water availability: sedimentary, flow basalt, and basalt cinders (driest). Within each SPM were  
three sites that included twenty 0.05 ha circular plots 100 m apart. All woody plants were classified into one of three condition classes: live with 
low amount of dieback (LLD) where < 25% of the canopy was recently dead, live with high amount of dieback (LHD) where > 25% of the 
canopy was recently dead, and dead (D). The percent D pooled over species was 14.2% for trees and 8.8% for shrubs at the cinder sites, 
14.1% for trees and 10.6% for shrubs at the flow basalt sites, and 12.3% for trees and 19.0% for shrubs at the sedimentary sites. For the 
major trees, percent D was lower for Juniperus monosperma compared to Pinus ponderosa and P. edulis. Pooled over all trees and shrubs, 
the percent of plants in the LHD category was higher on cinder vs. flow basalt and sedimentary SPMs. The same result occurred for P. edulis 
and J. monosperma, but not for P. ponderosa, in which percent LHD was similar among SPMs. In general, shrubs showed greater percent 
LHD than trees. Overall, our results show moderate amounts of mortality for woody plants at the ponderosa pine/pinyon-juniper ecotone and 
greater canopy dieback for living trees and shrubs at the cinder compared to the flow basalt and sedimentary SPMs. 
 
 
GROWTH RESPONSES OF NORTHERN ARIZONA FORESTS TO CLIMATIC VARIATION 
 
KOLB, T.E. 
School of Forestry, Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, AZ, 86011-5018; tom.kolb@nau.edu 
 
Tree rings contain information on historical responses of tree growth and physiology to climatic variation that can inform understanding of 
future responses to climate change. Recent studies in northern Arizona showed that severe regional drought reduced growth of all dominant 
tree species over a gradient of precipitation and temperature represented by a 1,500 m change in elevation on the San Francisco Peaks, but 
response to drought varied among species and sites. Leaf 
13C data suggests pronounced stomatal closure in response to drought for both 
low- and high-elevation forests, and differences in water-use efficiency among species. A long-term thinning experiment for ponderosa pine 
showed that resilience and sensitivity of growth to drought depended on stand density. Guidelines derived from these results for 
understanding effects of climate variation on tree growth for Southwestern mountain landscapes and in the context of forest management will 
be discussed.

The mixed conifer forest type of southwestern Colorado is poorly understood in comparison to other common forest types in this area, in part 
due to its compositional complexity.  We identified 4 dominant tree canopy types within the warm, dry mixed conifer based on an IV value 
(relative frequency plus relative abundance): white fir, ponderosa pine, aspen, and Douglas-fir.  We then examined how understory 
composition and abundance varied across these 4 types, and assessed the correlation between biotic and abiotic variables and the understory 
vegetation.  Understory community composition was significantly different between tree canopy types, with aspen plots having the most 
distinct understory plant community of the 4 canopy types.  Total plant cover was significantly higher in the aspen plots, and shrub richness 
was significantly higher in the Douglas-fir plots.  On average for all tree canopy types combined, shrubs dominated the understory cover 
(11.35 %), followed by forbs (7.89 %), and graminoids (4.34 %).  Multivariate multiple regression showed that several site factors (distance to 
drainage, slope, and aspect), and stand characteristics (white fir trees per hectare [TPH], ponderosa pine TPH and basal area [BA], and aspen 
BA) helped account for some of the variability of the understory community.  Univariate regression showed that variation in annual species 
richness and Simpson’s Index of diversity were partially explained by tree canopy and site data.  Our findings illustrate the necessity to not 
simplify forest dynamics for all western forest types or even within one forest type (warm, dry mixed conifer) for a general region.  Forest 
management implementation needs to be based on site specific knowledge within localized geographic regions in order to restore or preserve 
natural communities within a range of historic variability.

We examined the hypothesis that two dominant riparian tree species, narrowleaf and Fremont cottonwoods (Populus angustifolia and P. 
fremontii, respectively), which are known to hybridize, support different ectomycorrhizal (EM) communities. Over 5000 species of fungi form 
ectomycorrhizal associations with host plants, yet little is known about the effect of host plant species composition on rates of ectomycorrhizal 
colonization, diversity and community composition. In particular, few studies have looked for differences in ectomycorrhizal communities 
between two closely related host plant species. In a common garden where environment was held constant, 1 soil core was collected under 10 
trees, of known and unique genotypes, 5 representing each species, and morphotyped 100 root tips from each sample. The following 4 results 
emerged: (1) Although this difference was not statistically significant, narrowleaf cottonwoods had 14% lower levels of mycorrhizal colonization 
than Fremont cottonwoods. (2) EM morphotype richness and diversity were higher in narrowleaf cottonwoods, but again this difference was 
not significant. (3) Only seven EM of forty-five morphotypes were shared between narrowleaf and Fremont cottonwoods, accounting for only 
10% of the root tips counted. (4) The EM morphotype community supported by narrowleaf and Fremont were significantly different from each 
other. This study indicates that unique EM communities are supported by closely related tree species growing in a common environment.  
Based on previous research, such closely related species would be expected to support similar communities. These results suggest that host 
plant identity has an under-appreciated role in determining EM species composition and that conserving EM fungal diversity will require 
conserving closely related plant taxa. Implications for conservation of ectomycorrhizal diversity fall in line with the need to conserve 
populations of these dominant, yet declining, riparian host species.

The Rodeo-Chediski fire burned 468,000 acres in central-eastern Arizona in 2002. This fire left a mosaic of burn severities across the 
landscape on both White Mountain Apache Tribal lands (WMAT) and the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest (A-S). This study intends to 
investigate richness and abundance of native and exotic species in the burn area in order to describe if treatments prior to the fire provided for 
a more healthy and resilient understory following the burn. We sampled 192 plots 2 years after the fire, and remeasured 3 years post-burn. 
The 108 plots on WMAT sampled areas determined to be high or low burn severity by satellite imagery over a gradient of treatments including 
prescribed fire combined with thinning, prescribed burning alone, and no treatment. We sampled 84 paired plots on A-S in stands that had 
been thinned or not thinned. We will compare the plant communities in the various combinations of fire severity and treatments, specifically 
looking at richness and abundance of natives and exotics.

The interaction between fire and invasive plants is of great concern to land management agencies on the Colorado Plateau.  Both prescribed 
fire and naturally occurring wildfire are increasingly resulting in a dominant understory of the invasive annual grass cheatgrass (Bromus 
tectorum), which has the potential to create excessively short fire return intervals, and impede the establishment of later successional plant 
species. There is some evidence that where native perennial grasses such as the cool season grass bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus 
elymoides) and the warm season grass blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) occur naturally after fire, cheatgrass dominance is low and diversity 
and cover of native perennial grasses, shrubs, and forbs is high. This suggests that native perennial grasses may be competing with and 
reducing the dominance of cheatgrass. We designed a project to evaluate effects of postfire seeding of bottlebrush squirreltail (3lbs /ac pls) 
and blue grama (2lbs/ac pls) on dominance by cheatgrass. The study area is located on the Shivwits Plateau on the western edge of the 
Colorado Plateau. NPS and BLM Fire Management personnel conducted a prescribed fire in a sagebrush meadow in October 2003 in an 
ongoing program to reintroduce fire into the ponderosa pine ecosystem.  In November 2003, seeding, seeding plus raking, and unseeded 
controls were each randomly applied to 6 replicate treatment plots (n=18 total plots), each 25m x 50m (1,250m2).  Immediate postfire 
vegetation and soil seed bank data were collected in fall 2003 to establish burn severity and baseline plant community data.  Two years of 
postfire and post treatment data have been collected in spring of 2004 and 2005.  Sampling will continue for an additional 2 years.  The study 
site will also be maintained by the Lake Mead National Recreation Area as a demonstration site where the long-term effects of the seeding 
treatments can be observed and the information integrated back into the process of land management planning.

Native plant restoration and weed control in western rangelands involve economic concerns that force us to choose management techniques 
based on application over large areas with limited input of time and labor.  Historically, this has often involved herbicide application and 
seeding using non-native species. Our goal is to identify ecological mechanisms by which to control the spread of cheatgrass (Bromus 
tectorum) on western rangelands.  Efforts to control cheatgrass need to focus on its competitive ability and reproductive capacity while 
simultaneously restoring native plants. We have implemented a series of experiments across four states to test techniques for controlling 
cheatgrass, establishing native plant communities, and restoring ecosystem structure and function.   One of these experiments tested the 
applicability of seeding with a modified Truax© range drill in native plant restoration, the impact of herbicide on both cheatgrass and native 
plant species, and how the establishment of certain native plant species is related to density of cheatgrass and other non-native plant species.  
We used a randomized split plot design at each site to test and establishment success of 29 accessions comprising 18 native plants.  
Cheatgrass responded negatively to herbicide treatment, whereas native and non-native species responded differently.  Neither cheatgrass 
density nor biomass were reduced by planted accession and accessions differed in establishment success depending on site, which have 
immense implications for management.  Our other experiment tested the role of soil nitrogen in mediating competition between native species 
and cheatgrass, and the effectiveness of native species in reducing soil nitrogen and cheatgrass production.  Sucrose decreased soil nitrogen, 
as well as other soil nutrients, and resulted in reduced cheatgrass biomass and seed production. Effects of native species on cheatgrass 
density, and of cheatgrass on native species density, were not consistent across sites. Species responded differently to both sucrose and 
competition with cheatgrass.  Subsequent years of data will be vital in determining the competitive effects of native species on cheatgrass 
performance and for assessing the effectiveness of herbicide and sucrose application.

species common.”  “Gap analyses” are performed to identify areas of high biological value relative to current land management practices and 
to assess the degree to which protection is afforded.  Information resulting from these analyses can be used to prioritize areas in need of 
conservation, to re-evaluate current management practices in light of regional conservation needs, and to facilitate cooperative management 
and planning among land stewards.  The Southwest Regional GAP Analysis Project (SWReGAP) recently completed a seamless regional land 
cover map for Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah.  Results of the gap analysis for land cover of the Colorado Plateau 
Ecoregion will be the focus of this presentation.  Conservation opportunities associated with using the land cover data set as a separate 
resource will also be discussed.  With an intended scale of 1:100,000, the land cover map is best suited for landscape to regional level 
assessments.  The land cover map provides a useful context for a range of biological and regional planning efforts including large area 
resource management objectives, human-wildland interface issues, and environmental impact assessments and socio-economic studies in the 
event of loss of a particular biological resource.

Plant production is known to vary considerably from year to year in semi-arid environments.  We analyzed a 14-year (1992-2005) dataset from 
the Gus Pearson Natural Area located near Flagstaff, AZ to determine the effects of inter-annual variation in precipitation on aboveground 
herbaceous standing crop and species richness.  In multiple regression models, precipitation and treatment explained 82% of the variation in 
total herbaceous standing crop.  A precipitation x treatment interaction term was also significant in this model suggesting that the intercepts 
and the slopes of the regression lines differed between treatments. These factors also explained graminoid standing crop (R
2adj = 0.94), forb 
standing crop (R
2adj = 0.61), C3 graminoid standing crop (R
2adj = 0.96), legume standing crop (R
2adj = 0.74), perennial forb standing crop 
(R
2adj = 0.39), and annual forb standing crop (R
2adj = 0.67).  Interestingly, 84% of the variation in C4 graminoid standing crop could be 
explained by the treatments, but precipitation did not improve the model, suggesting that C4 graminoids are resilient to temporal variation in 
precipitation, and therefore, less affected by the drought experienced in 1996, 2002 and 2004.  We also used structural equation modeling to 
test a general multivariate model of herbaceous plant species richness.  Overall, we found that ponderosa pine (basal area) consistently had a 
strong negative effect on herbaceous standing crop, and that standing crop exhibited a unimodal (“hump-shaped”) relationship to species 
richness, suggesting that competitive exclusion occurs within the herbaceous community.  However, this relationship is dampened in drought 
years, suggesting that competitive exclusion in the understory occurs only in years when enough moisture is available to drive abundant plant 
growth.

REFORMING STATE TRUST LAND THROUGHOUT THE WEST 
 
LAURENZI, ANDY

In 1785, the U.S. Congress established a policy of granting land to states when they entered the Union as an asset to generate funding to 
support the public education system, a fundamental state responsibility. Starting with Ohio in 1785 and ending with Arizona and New Mexico 
in 1910, each new state received a set of federal lands to be held in trust for the benefit of the public schools. To date, lease and sale of 
natural products are the principal sources of revenue. But as the West urbanizes and its economy matures, trust land managers recognize a 
need to broaden the land use activities of their portfolios to include commercial, industrial and residential development, as well as recreation 
and conservation. To bring diverse interests together and providing information to stakeholders and decision makers, the Lincoln Institute and 
Sonoran Institute have created a Joint Venture project to (a) facilitate efforts to modernize state trust land laws and regulations in western 
states, (b) foster education and research on key issues, (c) increase public awareness of the diverse values of state trust lands and the 
impacts of management decisions on local communities, (d) develop and implement on-the-ground innovative approaches to collaborative 
land use planning and conservation management of state trust lands, and (e) provide technical information and tools to key decision makers 
and agency staff.

The FRAME (Framing Research to support Adaptive Management of Ecosystems) project is a collaborative, multi-disciplinary effort currently 
focusing on pinyon-juniper woodland management on the Colorado Plateau. The USGS Modular Modeling System (MMS) 
(http://wwwbrr.cr.usgs.gov/mms) provides a modular framework to address a variety of pinyon-juniper management issues using a set of 
adaptive modeling tools. MMS is being coupled with the U.S. Forest Service model SIMulating Patterns and Processes at Landscape Scales 
(SIMPPLLE) (http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/missoula/4151/SIMPPLLE) to enable the assessment of the effects of alternative resource-management 
options on a variety of hydrologic and ecosystem processes. A variety of watershed, erosion, hydraulic, and ecosystem models in MMS will be 
used to evaluate the spatially explicit output of SIMPPLLE. Output from SIMPPLLE is an ensemble of potential vegetation conditions years to 
decades into the future. Key components of the linked MMS and SIMPPLLE models are 1) tools to estimate parameters in MMS process-
based models using vegetation and ecosystem attribute data from SIMPPLLE output, and 2) a climate generator to provide time series of 
meteorological variables, such as precipitation and temperature, for use as input to the process-based models. The magnitude and timing of 
these meteorological variables must be spatially and temporally representative of possible future climate conditions. Initial application of the 
coupled MMS-SIMPPLLE modeling tools is to support fire-management planning at Mesa Verde National Park. A major objective of the 
development and application of these tools is to allow resource managers to develop more flexible management scenarios that can adjust to 
changing conditions, and to develop spatially explicit landscape-management scenarios that incorporate the social, economic, legal, and 
environmental constraints that managers face. A review of the modular framework and selected framework tools will be presented.

Recent studies of forest vegetation in the Mogollon Rim area have found that severe crown fires have induced shifts in vegetation from 
ponderosa pine forests to manzanita-oak shrublands.  Geologic differences could potentially alter the responses of different areas subjected to 
severe wildfire.  To test this hypothesis, we compared vegetation and ground cover in burned and unburned areas across sandstone and 
limestone geologic formations. We located the study sites in pine/juniper/oak forest below the Mogollon Rim on the Tonto National Forest in 
central Arizona.  The burned sites had been burned by the Dude wildfire in 1990.  We sampled half the sites in 2001 and 2002, and the other 
half in 2005.  We measured cover of soil, gravel, litter and canopy cover of vegetation in 40 plots at each site, using a modified Daubenmire 
sampling method. We distributed the 60 sites evenly across sandstone/limestone geologies and burned/unburned areas. Vegetative cover 
was not significantly different between limestone and sandstone geologies within the unburned areas (x = 3.82 ± 2.37%, mean ± standard 
deviation, n = 15, and x = 4.03 ± 2.14%, respectively).  Average soil cover on unburned limestone sites was less (5.23 ± 6.63%) than on 
unburned sandstone sites (7.98 ± 7.17%).  In the burned areas, bare soil was less on limestone sites (12.67 ± 7.15%) than on sandstone sites 
(28.15 ± 8.38%), supporting our hypothesis that limestone sites would be more resilient to wildfire.  However, vegetation cover was higher on 
burned sandstone sites (8.98 ± 4.06%) than on burned limestone sites (6.68 ± 5.48%).  This result reflects the fact that the seeded, non-native 
weeping lovegrass (Eragrostis curvula) was more abundant on burned sandstone sites (5.12 ± 3.74%) than on burned limestone sites (3.89 ± 
5.94%).  Our results demonstrate that geology influences vegetative response to severe wildfire and should be a consideration of post-fire 
management strategies.

Recent terrestrial research demonstrates the importance of genetic variation within tree species such as oaks, aspen and cottonwoods in 
affecting the function of forest ecosystems. We show similarly that genetic variation within cottonwoods can affect stream ecosystem function 
through litterfall. The genetic makeup of cottonwood leaf litter directly affects in-stream leaf decomposition rates, aquatic fungal accumulation 
and macroinvertebrate assemblages. This genetic variation is especially important in the western United States because cottonwoods are a 
dominant riparian tree and are currently in dramatic decline. In western rivers, cottonwood genetic diversity may be elevated due to naturally-
occurring hybridization zones. We collected litter from five genotypes of each of four cottonwood cross types from common garden trees and 
measured decomposition rates using litterbag techniques in the Weber River (UT). Among the cottonwood genotypes decomposition rates 
ranged on average from 0.0077 ± 0.0003 day
-1 for backcross to P. angustifolia hybrids to 0.0105 ± 0.0003 day
-1 for P. fremontii. Similar and 
substantial differences among F1 and backcross hybrids provide evidence for genetic control over in-stream decomposition rates. Prior studies 
have shown that species diversity influences litter quality and stream function. This study extends this by linking genetic diversity to stream 
ecosystem function.

Aggressive infestation by tamarisk (Tamarix ramosissima, T. chinensis) and Russian olive (Elaeaganus angustifolia), in combination with 
intensive historic grazing and tour operations within the riparian corridors of the canyon floor, have created the need for an integrated and 
collaborative approach to managing cultural and natural resources within the canyons and their associated watersheds.  Invasive plant 
infestations have seriously altered stream processes creating unnatural rates and severity of channel incision and land erosion, and have 
consequently reduced land areas available for traditional farming.  In addition, natural biological diversity has been significantly reduced along 
the riparian corridor. Restoration and preservation of this diversity is important for maintaining the natural ecology of the canyons and for 
sustaining traditional and ethnological uses by the Navajo peoples residing within the canyon bottoms.  These changes have dramatically 
altered and seriously threaten valuable and irreplaceable archeological resources, cultural landscapes, at-risk species and traditional lifeways. 
The park is addressing these issues by developing a local and sustainable canyon conservation corp.

The role of anthropogenic and natural disturbances on invasive species is great, but their interactive effects are poorly documented.  In a 
northern Arizona grassland, where the extent of exotic invasion was heretofore poorly documented, we reflect upon responses of invasive 
annual plants to a gradient of grazing intensity (cattle removal, moderate grazing, and high-impact grazing) during an eight year experiment.  
We found strong evidence that 1) grazing effects on invasives were contingent upon climate; and 2) resource-availability mediated the 
invasion.  In the seventh year of the study, and shortly after a millennium-scale drought, we document an eight-fold increase in cheatgrass 
(Bromus tectorum) due to high-impact grazing.  Cheatgrass responded positively to increased soil nitrogen that was a result of high-impact 
grazing.  In a controlled greenhouse experiment, cheatgrass produced 20% more biomass in soils from the high-impact treatment than other 
treatments.  Although increased cattle density consistently benefited cheatgrass, the converse strategy of cattle removal did not decrease 
susceptibility to cheatgrass spread in comparison with moderate grazing practices.  We conclude that grazing effects on invasive annuals are 
strongly dependent on environmental conditions, and drought creates conditions that favor post-drought outbreaks of invasive annuals.  
Finally, we outline a monitoring approach for tracking cheatgrass spread at a landscape scale and document its spatial distribution on 
Anderson Mesa.

Many Native Americans are tremendously concerned with conserving ecologically and culturally important sites, and they see a need to 
reinforce traditional cultural values among young people. The high school in the Western Apache village of Cibecue implemented a special 
summer course in historical ecology for 16 high school and college students. In the late 1970s, elders from the community had asked a well-
known anthropologist to help map, photograph, and record stories about over 250 places in a 20-mile radius in Cibecue. This community-
generated database presented a unique opportunity for today’s students to examine ecological change, since many of the sites have 
withstood severe wildfires, record floods, extended droughts, and various management activities in the intervening decades. After a few weeks 
of instruction, students revisited the sites, retook their photographs, conducted ecological inventories, and interviewed elders about changes 
that had occurred. A main objective was to determine whether modern techniques for ecological assessment could complement and 
reinvigorate interest in traditional Apache systems for describing places. The students demonstrated great enthusiasm for this research, and 
they developed the basic skills needed to classify and examine wetland conditions at 16 sites. We were concerned that relying on non-Apache 
methodologies might displace or undermine traditional ways of knowing the land. Therefore, instructors emphasized the use of Apache names 
and taught students about the cultural significance of the sites prior to visiting them. Many students expressed greater appreciation for water 
and greater use of their native language at the end of the course. We created a video to communicate the outcomes of the project to the 
community and to outside groups. This video shows how the participants had relived actions of their ancestors through their visits to these 
places. The effort to cultivate awareness among young tribal members is serving as a foundation for the community to plan culturally 
appropriate and historically based efforts to conserve and restore the waters on which they depend. Consequently, this project demonstrated 
how past efforts to record traditional knowledge can feed modern efforts to put that knowledge back into practice.

Ecologists debate whether wildfires present a widespread threat to native fish populations, or instead constitute merely an isolated problem 
facing small populations in degraded watersheds. The threat of wildfire to Apache trout is difficult to evaluate since large wildfires have not 
struck its ancestral home on Mount Baldy in recent decades, but recent wildfires in the White Mountains may serve as proxies. The Steeple 
fire (2003), KP fire (2004), and Three Forks fire (2004) burned parts of the watersheds of Grant 
Creek, KP Creek, and the East Fork of the Black River, respectively. We sampled fish populations and habitat conditions in these streams 
after the 2004 fires had been contained and before major flood events had occurred.  We resampled fish populations at the sites one year 
later. We located sites to approximate those that the Arizona Game and Fish Department had established a decade earlier to help compare 
conditions before and after the fires. Despite fire-induced flooding and erosion in KP and Grant Creeks, trout survived in those streams in 
numbers comparable to historical levels. At the Three Forks sites, fish also survived despite short-term declines in water quality due to ash 
flows. These results contrast with much more destructive effects of earlier wildfires on streams west of the White Mountains along the 
Mogollon Rim. A coarse comparison of fire impacts indicates that the percent of the watershed burned at moderate or high severity is a 
reliable predictor of fish survival. Landscape attributes such as basin slope, geology, aspect, and stream power index are useful predictors of 
vulnerability to wildfire because they influence both the severity of the fire and channel responses. Field observations suggest that localized 
factors such as the presence of roads and spring-fed refugia in drainage bottoms mediate fire impacts. Streams occupied by Apache trout are 
similar in topography, geology, and vegetation to the burned streams in the White Mountains, and therefore they appear less vulnerable to 
wildfire than streams along the Mogollon Rim. Nevertheless, the risk to multiple populations of a threatened species warrants proactive 
treatments to rehabilitate roads in drainage bottoms and safeguard critical springs.

The year 2005 marks the 10
th anniversary of the completion of the Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on the Operation of Glen 
Canyon Dam. A decade of research and monitoring provides an important milestone to evaluate the effects of dam operations on resources of 
concern and determine if the desired outcomes are being achieved and whether they are compatible with one another or not. A 
comprehensive effort was undertaken by the USGS, Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center to assess the scientific state of 
knowledge of resources of concern, as identified in the EIS. The result was the production of a peer-reviewed publication, “State of the 
Colorado River Ecosystem in Grand Canyon” or SCORE Report. This report is the first systematic attempt to conduct an assessment of the 
changing state of Colorado River ecosystem resources in Grand Canyon over a decadal timeframe. Table II-7 of the EIS contains 30 
predictions or expected outcomes for how various resources would respond under the preferred alternative of Modified Low-Fluctuating Flows 
(MLFF). Because of a lack of data or subsequent analyses to confirm whether the prediction stated in the EIS was correct, or not, 14 or 47 
percent of the outcomes, are essentially unknown, despite ten years since completion of the EIS. These unresolved outcomes constitute an 
important list for further study in the program. Excluding outcomes that are unclear, then the remaining predictions in the EIS were correct in 5 
out of 16 outcomes, or 31 percent of the categories listed. Mixed outcomes occur in 6 out of 16, or 38 percent of the categories, and failed 

 
62 
predictions, occur in 5 out of 16, or 31 percent of the categories. These disparities underscore the uncertainties associated with working in a 
large complex system with limited data. The acceptability of this kind of uncertainty is influenced by interpretation, societal values, agency 
missions and mandates, and other factors. However, failure to correctly predict the future, in and of itself, is not deleterious under the 
paradigm of adaptive management where large uncertainties provide opportunities for learning and adjustment through an iterative process of 
“learning-by-doing.” The report makes clear that dam operations during the last 10 years have benefited some resources under MLFF, they 
have not restored fine sediment resources or native fish populations in Grand Canyon, two resources of significant importance to the program. 
 
 
GLOBAL WARMING AND INSECT OUTBREAKS IN SOUTHWESTERN FORESTS  
 
LYNCH, Ann 
USFS, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 
 
Insects are historically the greatest cause of disturbance in forested ecosystems, and may dramatically exceed historic levels during times of 
climate change.  Populations are particularly sensitive to changes in temperature, precipitation, and the seasonality of climate.  The response 
time to changing climate is very short, as insect population dynamics change dramatically once threshold conditions are reached.  Forest 
insects in western North America have already been influenced by recent climate trends:  Outbreaks have been more extensive and severe, 
further north or at higher elevations, or of species that were previously unknown or innocuous. Warming climate also affects the likelihood that 
exotic pests will establish and become pests, with potentially serious consequences for sensitive ecosystems.  A seemingly small increase in 
temperature (about 1°C since 1940 at 2100 m) has dramatically altered the seasonality of temperature limits associated with insect 
populations.  Winter is shorter and minimum temperatures are warmer.  Spring is earlier, warmer and less frosty.  In some areas, warmer 
temperatures have been accompanied by drought.  Many of the contemporary insect and disease outbreaks are clearly associated with these 
warm temperatures, while others are associated with prolonged drought.  As climate change progresses, insects and pathogens will serve as 
agents of change, catastrophically disrupting forest ecosystems in relatively short periods of time.

We sampled sixteen sites in the upper montane vegetation zone of eight mountain ranges in Arizona, southern Colorado and New Mexico to 
date historical stand-replacing fires. Stand-replacing fire dates were determined from seral, post-fire quaking aspen stands using multiple lines 
of tree-ring evidence.  The four lines of evidence included: 1) aspen inner-ring dates, 2) fire-killed conifer bark dates, 3) tree-ring width 
changes or other morphological indications of injury and 4) fire scars.  Eighteen stand-replacing fires were reconstructed between 1842 and 
1904.  Multiple sites, separated by hundreds of kilometers, recorded fires during three years (1851, 1861, and 1879), thus ten unique fire 
dates were used for the climate analysis.  All stand-replacing fires occurred during drought years, as indicated by negative reconstructed 
summer PDSI.  The average PDSI value for all fire years (-2.53) indicates moderate to severe drought conditions associated with stand-
replacing fire occurrence.  It is possible that an anomalous, multi-year pluvial followed by a multi-year drought in the mid 19
th century was the 
cause of the documented stand-replacing fires.  Similar oscillations from multi-year wet to multi-year dry conditions in the early 21
st centuries 
may be partially responsible for recent stand-replacing fires in the upper elevation forests of the region.

The encroachment of pinyon and juniper trees into historically shrub-dominated landscapes has caused major changes in ecosystem structure 
and function, including dramatic changes in fuel structure and fire regimes.  Restoration techniques are often labor intensive and expensive to 
implement, so it is prudent to determine their effectiveness before they are applied over large areas.  Land managers on the Shivwits Plateau 
in northwestern Arizona are currently faced with thousands of acres of tree-invaded shrublands, some within wildland/urban interface areas, 
and are seeking effective techniques to restore these areas to pre-invasion conditions and reduce wildfire hazards in the process.  We 
established a study to test the effectiveness of 3 techniques for reducing the density of post-invasion pinyon and juniper trees: (1) cut and 
leave, where 80% of the trees were cut down and left where they fell; (2) cut and scatter, where 80% of the trees were cut down, then bucked 
and scattered; and (3) herbicide, in which 80% of the trees were sprayed with Tordon 22k around the base of their trunks. Treatment plots 
were 20 acres, with 8 replicates each of the 3 treatments plus an untreated control.  We are currently evaluating changes in vegetation 
composition and fuel structure in response to the treatments.  First year results suggest a strong effect of the herbicide treatment on density 
and cover of herbaceous plants, generally 200% higher compared to the untreated control, and of species richness at a 1000-sq-m scale, 
increasing by about 10 species versus the control.  Changes in vegetation composition and fuel structure will be monitored in the future, with 
the goal of identifying the treatment method that will create a high diversity plant community dominated by shrubs, perennial grasses, and 
forbs, plus a fuel bed structure that will promote periodic burning to prevent re-invasion of pinyon and juniper trees.

Public land and wildlife managers built numerous developments throughout the arid and semi-arid West to artificially provision wildlife with 
water at a time when these developments were assumed to be a universal good. Within the last 15 yrs some public-land stakeholders have 
questioned both the efficacy and legality of these wildlife water developments, recently in often highly publicized ways. The resulting conflict 
has challenged all participants in this policy issue, with a resulting turn to science and the courts as final arbiters. We used methods of 
narrative and discourse analysis to examine the oral and written material in this case, drawing on scientific and media articles, promotional 
literature, and statements of participants in conversations and at a public workshop held during November 2004 in Phoenix, AZ. Our goal was 
to better understand underlying value demands and the framing context to facilitate identification of methods for finding common ground. We 
differentiated 9 narrative elements – 5 characterizing the dominant discourse and 4 characterizing the counter-discourse. The dominant 
discourse was articulated primarily by those self-identified as hunters and wildlife managers, and promoted the virtues of hunting culture and 
pragmatism, the primacy of bureaucratic control, the special status of science, and the governance model of total quality management (TQM). 
The counter-discourse was articulated primarily by self-identified environmentalists, as well as by those interested in process reform, and 
promoted the virtues of pristine nature, the need for compliance with federal policies, redistribution of access to power and respect, and the 
imperative of common ground. These conflicting discourses were rooted in fundamentally different worldviews regarding governance and 
human relations with nature. We see little prospect for finding common ground as long as participants remain focused on worldview 
differences, using authority and science to strategically advance their interests. We suggest an alternative approach that authoritatively 
engages conflicted stakeholders in collaboratively solving concrete problems with a common interest focus.

Predation rates and prey composition are relevant to judging effects of cougars (Puma concolor) on ecosystems.  Radiocollars that frequently 
obtain and satellite-transmit GPS locations provide researchers with unprecedented opportunities to collect sustained reliable information on 
cougar predation.  We fitted 10 cougars (5 males and 5 females) in the Flagstaff uplands of Arizona with Telonics GPS/Argos radiocollars and 
collected information from nearly 200 kills made by these animals between July 2003 and October 2005.  We also obtained a comprehensive 
record of movements based on 4-hour-interval GPS locations from collars deployed on and dropped by 3 males and 4 females.  As of August 
2005, 38% of kills were elk (Cervus elaphus), 34% were deer (Odocoileus spp.), and 21% were smaller mammals.  Elk <1-year-old comprised 
the largest single category of kills (26%).  Compared to adult females, adult male cougars killed more elk and fewer small mammals.  Four 
female cougars killed a total of 27 mesocarnivores, of which 21 (13% of total kills) were coyotes (Canis latrans).  We also documented 7 
instances of scavenging, all on adult elk.  Almost all kills occurred between 1700 and 1100 hours and were most frequent between 2100 and 
0500 hours.  Median intervals between kills ranged from150 to 288 hrs, depending on the animal.  Median time spent consuming large prey 
(>30 kg wet weight) ranged from 47 to 96 hrs, whereas median time spent consuming small prey ranged from 25 to 49 hrs.  Our future 
objectives for this study include collecting more of the types of information summarized here as well as an analysis of features associated with 
successful predation and different types of behaviors observed at kills (e.g., burial and dragging of carcasses). 
 
 
DRY PRESERVATION OF ICE AGE ORGANIC REMAINS AND THE UNIQUE RECORD OF VERTEBRATE FAUNA OF COLORADO 
PLATEAU CAVES

Caves as unique resources for Pleistocene (Ice Age) vertebrate faunas is not a new idea, yet now it is timely to revisit their value.  The 
Pleistocene contains two North American Land Mammal Ages: Irvingtonian (~1.8 – 0.15 Ma; million of years ago) and Rancholabrean (~0.15 – 
0.011 Ma).  Of the greater-than 150 Rancholabrean-age mammal localities in Arizona and the Colorado Plateau, the most valuable data sets 
(vertebrate fossils in association with macrobotanical data) come from localities with dried-preserved remains.  The Colorado Plateau contains 
predominantly sedimentary formations of Paleozoic and Mesozoic age.  Many of the rock units have the capability to produce alcoves, rock 
shelters, and caves.  Coupled with these long-lasting natural structures is the semi-arid climate of the region.  These criteria have permitted an 
inordinate amount of biological data to be preserved for tens of thousands of years – data that is typically lost to decay.  Grand Canyon 
contains a particularly rich repository of caves and alcoves due predominantly to the exposure of the Redwall and Muav limestone.  
Considering that the exposure of these rock units continues almost the entire 277 river miles of the Colorado River (plus miles of side canyon 
exposures), literally thousands of caves are known from the park. Dry-preservation of fossils in these caves is the rule, not the exception, yet 
only about 300 to 400 caves are recorded and extremely few are adequately assessed of their paleontological resources.  Types of preserved 
fossils include: dung, muscle tissue, hair, bone, bone chemistry, plant macrofossils, pollen, and microhistology.  Caves preserve important 
data sets, such as: 1) precise dating the extinction of Harrington’s mountain goat and ground sloth, 2) arrival of the bighorn sheep, 3) 
extinction of the mammoth and shrub-ox, 4) plant community mosaic through time, 5) diet of the extinct mountain goat, mammoth, ground 
sloth, shrub-ox, and 6) extirpation of the condor and bison.  The resource is available for basic research questions but can and should be used 
for wildlife land management issues such as: 1) when did the wapiti arrive, and 2) is the river otter a recent introduction as is the javelina?

Solitary bees, a key component in many ecological systems, are thought to be most diverse in southwest North America, a region dominated 
by the Colorado Plateau (CP).  Despite the CP’s large size and distinctiveness, few studies of its bee fauna exist.  A fifteen-year study of the 
San Rafael Swell (south-central Utah) represents the most intensive survey prior to 2000.  Results hint at the potential of the CP for rich and 
abundant faunas, and also suggest that bee patterns of richness and abundance in the southwest follow a bimodal distribution across the 
season.  However, there are several gaps in the study.  Both spatially, and across the fifteen years, collections were variable and sporadic 
making any statistical analysis virtually impossible.  A four-year study in Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument (GSENM) provided an 
opportunity to better understand the bee fauna of the CP.  At the edge of the CP where cold and hot desert regimes meet and encompassing 
nearly 2 million acres and numerous habitats, GSENM provided an ideal setting in which to study one CP bee assemblage.  Specifically, we 
aimed to: 1) establish baseline data for monument managers, 2) address biologic boundaries produced by the juncture of two disparate 
climates 3) establish one-hectare plots for long term monitoring (plots that would also allow for statistical comparison of alpha and beta 
diversity across the monument), and 4) assess the degree to which landscape characteristics influence community structure. We have 
recorded 643 bee species in GSENM.  Our results have expanded known distributions of several bees.  Species previously thought restricted 
to hot deserts have been found in GSENM; the same is not true for known cold desert bees.  GSENM’s bees have proven highly 
spatiotemporally variable, both in terms of richness and abundance.  Bimodal patterns are marked.  We used ordination techniques to 
illustrate the minimal role that habitat plays in defining bee communities, especially compared to elevation and geographic region.  Floral 
resources dictate bee abundance more than richness.  These results provide a foundation for further bee studies on the CP, illustrate the 
intrinsic variability of desert bees, and indicate the CP’s potential for rich, unique faunas.

Leaf litter, a form of coarse particulate organic matter, has been shown to provide an important source of carbon in smaller and shaded 
streams. We conducted an experiment to determine if travertine dams are important factors in leaf litter retention in Fossil Creek, Arizona. 
Fossil Creek is a first order stream which has had a >90% stream flow diversion for hydropower use for nearly 100 years, until 
decommissioning occurred this June 2005. We released 2000 leaves along each of six reaches before decommissioning, three free flowing 
and three with travertine dams.  This experiment is being repeated at all sites currently, now that dam decommissioning has occurred and full 
stream flow has been returned to the creek.  Methods of data collection include collecting released leaves in seine nets at the end of each site, 
capturing average velocity and stream discharge at each site, measuring mass of travertine dams and coarse woody debris, capturing 
average substrate coarseness at each site, recording distance traveled, and recording leaf retaining substrate for all visible leaves.  Our 
preliminary data has found greater leaf retention in the travertine sites. Lower velocities and greater abundance of coarse woody debris were 
also found to be factors that increased leaf retention in the travertine reaches. Substrate coarseness was not significantly different among the 
sites. The decommissioning of Fossil Creek Dam provides a unique opportunity for researchers to observe ecosystem restoration, as research 
on dam removals is still limited. There are expectations that restored flow to Fossil Creek will increase travertine deposition, which will result in 
an increase in the number of travertine dams over time. According to this experiment, new travertine formations will result in an increase of 
leaf retention in these areas, which will benefit the food base.

Pinyon-Juniper (PJ) woodland cover 35% of the Colorado Plateau, and is the largest vegetation type administered by the Bureau of Land 
Management (BLM) on the Colorado Plateau.  These woodlands have been increasing dramatically in density and extent over the last 100 
years.  In response to this increase and a concomitant loss of grasslands, the BLM has been actively treating the landscape by clearing pinyon 
and juniper and reseeding since the 1950’s.  Our project addresses a key need by mapping past treatments and acquiring all associated data, 
the first step needed to assess the effectiveness of past PJ removal and re-vegetation treatments.  We have synthesized the archives in both 
an ArcMap geodatabase and an Oracle database (PJWOOD,) and made it available for online access of more than 100 variables, GIS 
datasets, and over 2000 photos and figures associated with treatments.  The PJWOOD database allows for simple queries of individual 
treatments or synthesizing information across the Colorado Plateau.  To date we have mapped the distribution of over 700 treatments 
encompassing ~700,000 acres of PJ woodland on BLM lands have been treated in the last fifty-seven years.  This constitutes 7% of all 
pinyon-juniper on BLM lands.  The number of treatments applied within a field office varied from 2 to 124 and treatment sizes varied from 1 to 
14,417 acres.  There were two well-defined periods we refer to as the “Chaining Era” from 1950 to 1979, characterized by chaining and/or bull 
dozing, and a “Diversified Methods Era” from 1980 to the present where prescribed burning was the most common but the hydroaxe, 
rollerchop, select hand thinning, and chemical treatments were also applied. These findings indicate widely distributed impacts on pinyon-
juniper ecology and the opportunity for landscape level analysis and regional land management planning.

Occupying 1.9 million acres of the Colorado Plateau physiographic province, the Bureau of Land Management's Grand Staircase-Escalante 
National Monument is characterized by gradients in elevation, climate, soils, land-use legacies, and contemporary management regimes that 
provide a rich matrix for ecological research and monitoring.  In the 9 years since its establishment in 1996 as the largest unit in the Bureau's 
National Landscape Conservation System, the Monument has served as a unique field laboratory for studies investigating a wide range of 
ecological topics including broad-scale patterns in plant community composition; the importance of climate and substrate characteristics as 
factors driving the distribution, structure, and functioning of biological soil crusts; responses of amphibians and terrestrial invertebrates to the 
cessation of livestock grazing; effects of livestock grazing on vegetation structure and soil biogeochemistry; and the status of arbuscular 
mycorrhizal fungi communities in relation to field measures of soil quality.  In 2005, a promising new phase in the development of the 
Monument's science program was initiated with the opening of a science-support facility in Escalante, Utah, and with the housing of a U.S. 
Geological Survey scientist at Monument headquarters in Kanab, Utah.  The latter event marks the establishment of a multi-agency science 
partnership with the Survey's Southwest Biological Science Center and the National Park Service's Zion National Park to increase 
opportunities for cooperation, collaboration, and scientific and technical support.  Coincident with this new phase of science support and 
cooperation, new opportunities for ecological investigations are arising in a number of key areas that will benefit from a regional perspective. 
Particular needs and opportunities include monitoring of long-term environmental change, restoration of damaged dryland ecosystems, 
application of research and monitoring to adaptive management of Monument resources, and development of approaches to address human 
dimensions of current and future resource-management challenges.

Small, free-flowing streams and rivers on the Colorado Plateau may provide important refuge habitats for fish, invertebrate, and algal species 
that have been extirpated from the larger rivers due to water regulation.  Unfortunately, the biology of these smaller systems is not well 
understood.  Our research focuses on describing and classifying the aquatic communities in the free-flowing streams and mid-sized rivers on 
the Colorado Plateau.  We are developing a hierarchical stream classification system to relate aquatic insect diversity and abundance to 
stream habitat parameters, such as streamflow permanence, channel morphology, substrate type, and algal abundance at the multiple scales.  
At the regional scale, we expect that the range of different flow regimes (from snowmelt-fed perennial systems to monsoon-driven ephemeral 
streams) limits aquatic insect distribution.  We expect that relatively benign perennial streams have a rich biota, whereas biodiversity in 
ephemeral streams will be more limited.  At a finer scale, physical habitat parameters are expected to describe aquatic insect diversity and 
abundance.  Preliminary data from the Plateau indicates that the insect community assemblages of high-gradient, bedrock dominated streams 
are markedly different from the community in low-gradient, sandy streams.  Research in other ecoregions has shown that aquatic insect 
diversity and richness are correlated with stream habitat type and our work will allow a “typology” of habitat associations for aquatic insects to 
be created for the Colorado Plateau.  This classification system will have practical application for land management on the Colorado Plateau 
as most of the land is managed by the federal government. A hierarchical stream classification would allow managers to use physical 
parameters to manage small streams at multiple scales. These data will allow managers to make more informed decisions about stream and 
river restoration in this ecologically unique region. 
 
 
THE DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE OF CHEATGRASS (BROMUS TECTORUM) POPULATIONS ON THE UNCOMPAHGRE

In recent years Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) has become a more serious and prevalent weed throughout the Colorado Plateau. It continues 
to expand and occupies more diverse habitats. Studies were initiated in 2004 to locate and map sites within the Uncompahgre Plateau that 
were occupied with this annual grass. Areas of occurrence were classified by site conditions including soil type, vegetative communities, 
elevation, climatic conditions, and site disturbances. In addition, plants were collected from all principal locations and used to complete DNA 
tests to determine the presence and distribution of separate ecotypes. Studies demonstrated that cheatgrass primarily occupies disturbances 
including sites lacking native understory, roads and other related construction projects, and areas disturbed by livestock and wildlife activities. 
This annual weed is now so widely distributed that any disturbance results in immediate occupation by this grass.  Between 15 and 20 
separate ecotypes have been identified to occur within the Plateau. In contracts to studies within the Great Basin, the distribution of separate 
ecotypes is not so uniquely oriented. In general, most ecotypes were found throughout all community types, elevations, and site conditions. 
Apparently invasion of the weed has been a recent event, and individual ecotypes are adapted to most conditions that exist. Separation of 
specific ecotypes to particular sites has not occurred.

A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO MONITORING: THE POET MODEL

The majority of the forests in the Southwest are ecologically degraded, baring a threat of catastrophic wildfire that would not only negatively 
impact ecosystems, but also could consume whole communities. For land practitioners that are faced with these pressing priorities, a new 
ecological/social paradigm has emerged. Within the new paradigm, community protection, ecological restoration, and a variety of social 
considerations and adaptations come into play. In order to assimilate the new paradigm within the context of land management priorities, a 
holistic approach can be conceived through the POET model. The POET model contains four interconnected variables that include: 1) 
population, 2) organization (social), 3) environment and, 4) technology.  This model can aid in conceptualizing the shifting paradigm as well as 
organizing the response to its components. In response to the shifting priorities, new ecological techniques such as fuels reduction and 
ecological restoration prescriptions are tested. In order to assess their success, a holistic approach to monitoring the various alternatives is 
essential. Therefore, monitoring becomes an interdisciplinary link in determining whether "modern forestry" is succeeding in conjoining forces 
with the new ecological/social paradigm. In order to construct an effective monitoring protocol, all factors that will be affected by the outcome 
should be incorporated that include fuels reduction, ecosystem restoration, social issues and economic health. In addition, monitoring should 
avoid hidden sociopolitical or socioeconomic agendas, while its protocol should incorporate a research design utilizing program evaluation, a 
systematic fact-finding procedure that is objective and neutral. In utilizing this approach, monitoring results will be perceived as non-
threatening and guiding. Although a multitude of experimental land management activities are currently being implemented, monitoring, set 
aside, has become a missing link within an adaptive management framework. In order to illustrate this approach, The Greater Flagstaff Forest 
Partnership (GFFP) Monitoring and Research Team has collaboratively developed an Adaptive Management Monitoring Framework. Within 
this presentation, both theoretical and practical applications of the monitoring and adaptive management process will be discussed.

There is considerable debate about the need for tree thinning and fuel reduction programs in pinyon-juniper woodlands of the Colorado 
Plateau.  Despite the lack of agreement on if and how fuels should be reduced in this woodland type, increased pinyon mortality and high tree 
densities near housing developments have been the incentive for fuel management efforts in some areas. Existing management practices 
such as thinning and burning slash piles have been shown to benefit exotic plant species to a greater extent than native plants and to 
decrease soil arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) propagules.  Mechanical mastication is a new and alternative thinning treatment in which 'hydro-
mow' equipment is used to shred live trees into wood chips with rotating blades and distributes the resulting large chips across the topsoil.  
Little is known about the effects of this thinning treatment on soil properties, plant communities, or mycorrhizae. Our study compares both one- 
and two-year old mastication and slash pile burns in a pinyon-juniper ecosystem near Dolores, Colorado. The following research questions will 
be addressed: Will mechanical mastication or slash pile burns: 1. Affect soil properties and available soil nutrients over time? 2. Change plant 
communities by increasing or decreasing native plant richness or exotic plant establishment? 3. Alter AM fungal abundance, community type, 
root colonization and/or inoculum potential? Preliminary data collected in August 2005 will help determine if mechanical mastication changes 
soil properties and nutrient availability, AM community, abundance and colonization potential, or plant community structure when compared to 
impacts from burnt slash piles and non-treated areas. Data on these same response variables will be collected in 2006 to provide an 
assessment of the temporal variation in the effect of these treatments. Results of this study will help determine if there is a preferred method to 
promote understory native plant richness and AM abundance and diversity, and thus decrease the opportunity for exotic plant establishment.

Wildlife movement today is increasingly restricted as the majority of the remaining natural habitat is being isolated, impacted, or lost through 
human development and the building of structures such as fences, roads, canals, border security infrastructure, and reservoirs. The Arizona 
Department of Economic Security projects that the state’s population will increase by 54% from 4.7 million in 1998 to 7.4 million in 2020.  
Arizona may soon lose its status as a state of wide-open spaces and low human impact. In order to protect the safe movement of people and 
wildlife, as well as maintain natural areas across Arizona for wildlife movement, a comprehensive approach is needed to protect the state’s 

 
67 
ecological resources.  Loss of connectivity is by no means inevitable, and growth of the human population does not always have to result in 
proliferation of barriers. Although road-widening projects generally increase vehicle traffic, such undertakings present the greatest opportunity 
to provide crossing structures that accommodate wildlife movement.  Because most of Arizona’s roads were not originally designed to 
accommodate wildlife movement, future highway construction and maintenance projects can dramatically improve permeability. Slower 
progress is anticipated when making canals and railroads more wildlife-friendly because these structures are not as regularly upgraded, as are 
roads. Fortunately, most important human structures are eventually upgraded, creating opportunities to improve connectivity.  However, it is 
important to note that such improvements cannot happen unless policy makers and planners are aware of the necessity for wildlife 
connectivity in such project areas.  The Arizona Wildlife Linkages Workgroup (AWLW) is an important collaborative effort between public and 
private sector organizations addressing habitat fragmentation in a cohesive, systematic approach intended to maintain and improve Arizona’s 
wildlife biodiversity.  The AWLW has developed a statewide map and report identifying 109 potential wildlife movement corridors as a tool to 
guide future planning, engineering and mitigation efforts. This map is a fluid product and will undergo revisions as additional information 
becomes available.  Each linkage has been prioritized based on biological importance, existing and perceived threats, and potential 
opportunities in order to better direct the immediate efforts of the development of linkage designs. 
 
 
UPPER STREAM VS LOWER STREAM WATER QUALITY OF EIGHT SOUTHERN UTAH STREAMS 
  
ORNES, HAROLD 
College of Science, Southern Utah University, 351 W. Center, Cedar City, UT  84720, ornes@suu.edu  
  
Most stream models predict the best water quality at or near the source (upper elevations) and deterioration downstream (lower elevations) as 
dissolved inorganic and organic matter accumulate.  In a 15 month field study of 29 sampling sites on eight Southern Utah streams, 
preliminary monthly data indicates approximately half of the streams sampled had poorest water quality near the source of some streams and 
improved water quality downstream.  The suspected deleterious factor is cattle grazing in and around the riparian zones.   Parameters 
measured include temperature, conductivity, total dissolved solids, % dissolved oxygen, mg dissolved oxygen, pH, oxygen reduction potential, 
phosphates, nitrates, and salinity.  Another year of monthly sampling should identify the best water quality parameters for detecting 
problematic riparian management practices and suggest acceptable ranges for each parameter. 
 
 
WILDERNESS RESTORATION: LEGAL AND POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR WILDERNESS AREAS AND NATIONAL PARK 
SERVICE LANDS IN NORTHERN ARIZONA 
 
OSTERGREN, DAVID

Restoration in wilderness areas and national parks presents a unique set of legal and political considerations that surpass those on most 
public lands.  In Wilderness Areas (WAs) that contain fire dependent ecosystems, the debate whether or not to utilize prescribed fire has been 
ongoing since the 1970s.  The debate hinges on the balance between whether we should have WAs that are natural, or untrammeled (i.e wild 
or self-willed).  The National Park Service is using prescribed fires to restore fire dependent ecosystems in many areas. However either 
management preference or public resistance often limits/precludes any mechanical thinning.   This analysis addresses legal and political 
issues surrounding the restoration debate in four northern Arizona wilderness areas (Mt. Trumbull, Mt. Logan, Kendrick and Kachina)  and the 
north rim of Grand Canyon National Park.

Irving Hydroelectric Powerplant Relicensing/Decommissioning project, the Fossil Creek Watershed Assessment, and the Fossil Creek Native 
Fish Restoration Project.  The complexity, timing and overlap of these projects required a high level of communication, coordination, and 
collaboration to get to where we are today: decommissioning of the two power plants and restoration of full flows, restoration of Fossil Creek 
for native fish, and development of a management plan (in progress) to deal with the future management of the Fossil Creek area.  While we 
were involved through the 1990’s as biological resource advisors to the various projects, our involvement intensified as simple relicensing 
evolved into a project to restore native fish.  Communication and coordination among 2 National Forests and a host of other players was 
challenging because of their differing missions, goals, perspectives, and values.  Key issues included the disposition of Fossil Springs dam, 
wilderness and wild and scenic rivers impacts, and long-term control of non-native fish.  We will discuss the challenges and rewards as we 
worked through these complex issues to the successful implementation of the native fish project.  Experiences and lessons learned should 
help in future endeavors as scientists and managers grapple with similar issues and limited agency budgets.

THE FLYCATCHER AND THE PHOENIX: RIPARIAN HABITAT CREATION AND DESTRUCTION IN A FLUCTUATING RESERVOIR.

The Southwestern Willow Flycatcher (Empidonax traillii extimus) is an endangered neotropical migrant and riparian obligate nester.  As much 
as 95% of riparian habitat has been destroyed or degraded in the southwest, resulting in a sever reduction of habitat for the flycatcher and 
resulting in its subsequent decline.  One important “source” of riparian habitat for the flycatcher is the exposed lake bed of fluctuating 
reservoirs across the southwest.  When reservoirs are drawn down for multiple years, which can occur during drought periods, lush riparian 
forests can quickly emerge from the exposed lake bed.  These high quality riparian forests are quickly colonized by riparian bird species, 
including Willow Flycatchers.  One such breeding site, Roosevelt Lake in central Arizona, has been intensively studies for the last 10 years.  In 
1995 the reservoir was at full capacity, but gradually over the following nine years the reservoir level has fallen to historically low levels due to 
a sustained drought, creating abundant riparian vegetation in the exposed lake bed.  Flycatchers, which prefer young, dense habitat, rapidly 
colonized the new habitat, tracking the bands of new habitat created by the gradually falling lake levels.  The flycatcher population responded 
to the huge influx of habitat by increasing in size from around 40 individuals to almost 400 by 2004, becoming the largest known flycatcher 
breeding site.  In 2004, almost all flycatchers were breeding in this young habitat; however, unusually heavy precipitation in the 2004/2005 
winter caused the lake level to rise 70+ feet, completely inundating virtually all the new habitat.  Ironically, that which destroyed this breeding 
habitat, the reservoir, is also what created it, and if the lake level was held down for a long period of time the habitat would become unsuitable 
to flycatchers and begin to die.  This trait of reservoirs, their continuing cycle of habitat creation and destruction, in many ways mimics the 
dynamic nature of large, free-flowing river systems which no longer exist in the southwest; this understanding should lead to strategic 
management of these high quality, albeit temporary, riparian woodlands for all bird species.

The growth and reproduction of woody plants are potentially constrained by ungulate browsing, consequently altering the resources available 
to insect communities.   Specific changes in vegetative and floral attributes may be responsible for alterations in the insect community 
structure.  We examined the relationships between vegetative and floral characteristics of grazed and ungrazed Ceonothus fenderli shrubs 
and their insect communities in ponderosa pine forests of Northern Arizona.  Ceonothus fenderli shrubs were caged to protect them from 
browsing elk and deer and paired with a non caged shrub in the same area.  Three years of data show that protected shrubs had longer stem 
lengths, greater number of stems and more flowering stems.  We found a significant difference between the insect communities, with higher 
abundance and greater diversity of insect families on protected shrubs.  Seven different insect families were indicators of protected shrubs, 
while there were no evident indicator families for unprotected shrubs.   Insect abundance and diversity were strongly correlated with the 
number of flowering stems and stem height.  Our results indicate that ungulate browsing of Ceonothus fenderli shrubs indirectly affects insect 
communities, suggesting that protection from browsing or alteration of grazing patterns could be a useful application for supporting a diverse 
insect community in ponderosa pine forests.

Recent evaluations of the status of biotic inventories indicate a very limited understanding of terrestrial arthropod biodiversity in U.S. national 
parks (Stohlgren and Quinn 1992, St. Clair et al. 1994, Stohlgren et al. 1995). Such descriptive work is a necessary prelude to the successful 
monitoring of the ecological effects of human activities in national parks. As part of a study on the possible effects of off-road vehicle use, Salt 
Creek Canyon in Canyonlands National Park, UT has since April 2000 been subject to an intensive effort to sample terrestrial arthropods in 
the canyon. Work in Salt Creek Canyon provides an opportunity to increase our knowledge of the biotic resources in a western national park. 
Here, we present a description of Coleopteran and Hymenopteran biodiversity in Salt Creek Canyon, and compare the Salt Creek Canyon 
beetle fauna to that of North America as evaluated by Marske and Ivie (2003). Ninety-nine morphospecies from 35 families have been 
collected in Salt Creek Canyon, representing 27% of the families and only 0.39% of the species found in North America. For North America, 
10% of the families contain 75% of the species. In contrast, 75% of the Salt Creek Species are found in 31% of the families. Like the North 
American fauna, 50% of the Salt Creek Canyon species are found in the five most speciose families found in the canyon. When individual 
families are considered, in Salt Creek Canyon, 34% (12/35) of families contain more than 1% of the species in the canyon, whereas for North 
America only 14% (18/129) contain more than 1%. A list of families and genera is provided along with a discussion of possible range 
extensions for three genera of Scarabaeoidea. The Salt Creek Canyon Hymenoptera fauna consists of 26 families out of the 77 described by 
Borror et al. (1989), with 30% (8/26) of the families from the Chalcidoidea.  Fifty-eight morphospecies have been tentatively established. A list 
of families and approximate number of morphospecies is provided.

The western United States has experienced unprecedented catastrophic wildfires in the past three years. Next to the combustion of forest 
vegetation during a wildfire, the most destructive impact of a wildfire comes from post-fire flood peak flows. These flows can severely affect 
stream physical conditions, aquatic habitat, aquatic biota, cultural resources and human health and safety. Being able to accurately model 
such flood events is important for post-wildfire watershed restoration efforts, protecting human health and safety, and identifying key areas that 
need to thinned in order to protect important municipal and wildland watersheds. Industry specific data models, such as the Danish Hydraulic 
Institute’s MIKE models, can be used within a single GIS platform to model such flood events. We are in the process of taking data from four 
previous wildfires in Arizona, namely the Coon Creek fire of 2000, the Rodeo-Chediski of 2002, the Aspen fire of 2003, and the Willow fire of 
2004 to calibrate our model for the southwestern ponderosa pine forests and pinyon juniper woodlands.  MIKE SHE (European Hydrological 
System  Système Hydrologique Européen) is a fully distributed model that allows for spatially distributed rainfall data within a watershed. This 
is one of the essential key factors in modeling post-fire hydrologic events in steep mountain watersheds in the Southwestern US. Other 
spatially distributed values, such as soil conditions, burn severities can also easily incorporated into the MIKE SHE model. Yet another 
advantage of the SHE software is that is allows for lateral subsurface flow, which usually not found in other hydrologic modeling software.  
Once we have calibrated the model to the ponderosa pine forest and pinyon juniper woodland ecosystems, we hope to be able to accurately 
model post wildfire floods in these ecosystems. Through this effort we intend to be able to identify areas at high risk of flooding in the event of 
a wildfire.  This in turn will allow us to guide restoration efforts post wildfire as well as prior to potential wildfires. 
 
 
DOES PRESCRIBED FIRE AFFECT BARK-FORAGING BIRD DENSITY IN WINTER?

Historically, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of the southwest have had fire as a component of the system.  These fires were of low 
intensity and generally stayed in the understory, maintaining an open, park-like stand.  Forest practices of the past century, including fire 
suppression, livestock grazing, and logging have led to denser forests carrying higher fuel loads.  This has led to unnatural and large crown 
fires that are destructive to the habitat.  To combat these large fires, forest managers are attempting to simulate past fire regimes by using 
prescribed fire to reduce fuel loads.  While the effects of large fires on avian species have been well documented, there have been few studies 
on the effects of prescribed fire on birds and none have been conducted during winter.  Winter may be a critical time for resident species, 
since food is generally limited.  This study was designed to examine the effects of prescribed fire on resident bark-foraging birds, including 
hairy woodpecker (Picoides villosus), pygmy nuthatch (Sitta pygmaea) and white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis) during winter.  The 
study sites were located in northern Arizona, as part of the larger Birds and Burns Network of the Rocky Mountain Research Station.  
Prescribed fires were conducted during the fall of 2003 and spring of 2004.  Distance sampling to evaluate individual species density occurred 
on the burned plots and the corresponding control plots during the 2004-2005 winter season.  Bark beetle surveys were also conducted during 
this time to assess the presence of food for the focal species on the plots.  Preliminary results suggest that hairy woodpeckers occur in higher 
densities on the burned plots than the controls.  This may be attributed to the increased presence of bark beetles on the burn plots after 
prescribed fire.  White-breasted nuthatches, however, have similar densities in burned and control plots, while pygmy nuthatches show a 
higher density in the burned plots at only one of the study sites.  Data collection will continue during the upcoming 2005-2006 winter season.  
Information provided by this study will assist forest managers in their ecological assessments included in their fire prescriptions.

The importance of caves as habitat for troglobites, and serving as important breeding spots or hibernacula for taxa such as bats is well 
understood.  However, the potential importance of caves as temporary habitat for a much larger set of species is often overlooked.  During 
periods of drought, either seasonal and predictable, or related to more unpredictable long-term weather patterns, caves may serve as 
important refugia for small mammals, amphibians, and reptiles.  During these periods caves may provide shelter, water (humidity), and/or food 
for normally non-troglobitic species.  Over the course of three years in Arkansas, we surveyed the fauna of over 80 small caves in a single 
watershed.  Cave use by salamanders during this time was strongly seasonal, with peaks during the hot and dry summer and autumn.  In 
contrast, we found snakes and frogs in caves primarily during a single unusually hot and dry summer.  We believe these taxa moved into the 
caves to maintain temperature and water balance, and perhaps to forage.  All of these taxa were more likely to be found in cooler and more 
humid caves.  In the southwest, there is a predictable annual dry period during the late spring and early summer, as well as a cycle of longer-
term drought periods.  During these periods, we believe caves may serve as important refugia for Tiger Salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum), 
lizards, snakes, and small mammals.  As few surveys have been done to date, we do not know the extent to which these taxa use caves.  
However, we propose that cave faunal surveys should include notes on the presence of non-troglobitic taxa, especially during periods when 
the outside climate may be stressful to them.

Previous geologic mapping of much of the area surrounding the Grand Canyon is not detailed enough to provide adequate support for current 
resource management decisions.  To fulfill this need, the U.S. Geological Survey/National Park Service (USGS/NPS) cooperative geologic 
mapping project is producing 1:100,000-scale digital geologic maps of this region in ArcGIS geodatabase format.  The geodatabase for some 
of these maps also includes compilation data at 1:24,000-scale.  These maps, which include bedrock and surficial geologic units, faults, folds, 
joints, sinkholes, breccia pipes, volcanic vents, mines, diversion dams, and stock tanks provide a detailed geological framework for 
environmental resource studies of the southwestern Colorado Plateau and eastern Great Basin provinces.  Maps completed thus far are being 
used to address two resource management questions: (1) Is there a connection between geology and threatened or endangered plant and 
animal species habitat? and (2) How might increased ground-water development adjacent to the Grand Canyon affect the water table and 
spring flows within Grand Canyon?  Tentative correlations have been identified between geology and the habitat of some plant and animal 
species, including the Mexican Spotted Owl, Sentry Milkvetch, bats, and the rare Paradine Plains cactus.  Hydrologic studies such as regional 
surface-water and groundwater flow system modeling are benefiting from an improved geologic framework that includes faults, folds, joints 
and karst features.  The digital geologic map databases with their improved level of detail enable resource managers and researchers from 
other disciplines to evaluate and identify possible relations between geology and resources of interest.  The maps also provide baseline data 
for land use and resource management decisions for National Parks and Monuments of northwestern Arizona as well as the Bureau of Land 
Management, Bureau of Indian Affairs, National Forest Service, State of Arizona, local communities, and private landowners.

The goal of the U.S. Geological Survey’s Gap Analysis Program is to keep common species common by identifying those species and plant 
communities that are not adequately represented in existing conservation lands. Common species are those not currently threatened with 
extinction. By identifying their habitats, Gap Analysis gives land managers and policy makers the information they need to make better-
informed decisions when identifying priority areas for conservation.  The Southwest Regional Gap Analysis Project (SWReGAP) is a mapping 
and assessment of biodiversity for the five-state region encompassing Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah.  The primary 
objective of this project is to use a coordinated mapping approach to create detailed, seamless maps of land cover, habitat for terrestrial 
vertebrate species, land stewardship, and management status.  This information is analyzed to identify animal species habitats and natural 
land cover types that are underrepresented on lands managed for their long term conservation.  Regional labs at Utah State University and 
New Mexico State University coordinated the development of regional products for land cover mapping, animal habitat modeling, and 
stewardship for the entire five-state region.  Information will be presented on the goals, objectives, and methods for the land cover mapping, 
animal habitat modeling, stewardship mapping, and gap analysis components of SWReGAP.  Presentations that follow will describe the 
SWReGAP products available for the Colorado Plateau region.

The National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) is an electronic information network that provides access to biological data and 
information on our nation’s plants, animals, and ecosystems.  The Southwest Information Node (SWIN), one of the regional nodes of the NBII 
network, encompasses the Southwestern states of Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah.  In the Southwest, federal resource 
agencies, environmental organizations, corporations, and the public need access to critical biological information to more effectively address 
the conflicting demands on natural resources.  SWIN is currently creating a Web-access gateway to biological information for the Southwest 
region.  One of the geographic areas of focus for SWIN is the Colorado Plateau.  SWIN, in collaboration with the Merriam-Powell Center for 
Environmental Research and other Colorado Plateau natural resource professionals, will develop a plan to establish a Colorado Plateau 
Information Project that could serve as the biological information portal for this area.  The Great Basin Information Project (GBIP), a 
component of SWIN, could serve as the model for the Colorado Plateau Information Project.  GBIP’s goal is to provide consolidated and 
efficient access to information about the Great Basin and Columbia Plateau regions of the Intermountain West.  A variety of GBIP information 
tools such as the Great Basin Bibliography, Great Basin Metadata Server, Internet Mapper, and Science Locator serve as examples of the 
mechanisms that can be used to provide centralized retrieval of valuable biological information for a region.

RIPARIAN VEGETATION AND ASSOCIATED WILDLIFE 
 
RALSTON, BARBARA 
 
This presentation describes changes in the riparian and fluvial marsh communities along the Colorado River in Grand Canyon from the closure 
of the Glen Canyon Dam and the beginning of the regulation of the river in 1963 to the present. To provide a better understanding of how dam 
operations have affected riparian vegetation, changes in Grand Canyon riparian vegetation during three periods of time (1963–80; 1980–91; 
1991–present) that correspond to major operational changes at Glen Canyon Dam are discussed. The effects on riparian vegetation of both 
the modified low fluctuating flow (MLFF) alternative, which was implemented beginning in 1996, and the recent drought are explored. The 
session concludes with a summary of the findings with respect to riparian vegetation as habitat and its relationship to other resources and with 
a discussion of monitoring priorities within the context of the Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program. 
 
 
ESTIMATING LAND SURFACE PHENOLOGY FROM SATELLITE IMAGERY   
 
REED, BRADLEY C. 
USGS, Flagstaff Science Center, Flagstaff, AZ 
 
Phenology, the study of the timing of biological events, is considered to be an important cause and/or consequence of global change.  
Surface/atmosphere boundary layer conditions (e.g., albedo, moisture content, surface roughness, etc.) vary considerably with changing 
stages of vegetation development.  Satellite remote sensing provides a means of continuously monitoring vegetation phenology changes 
throughout a growing season and of monitoring medium- to long-term trends of annual phenological events.  The satellite data record that is 
suitable for phenology studies dates back to 1989 at 1km spatial resolution for the conterminous US and to 1982 at 8km resolution for the 
globe.  Trend analysis of four phenology metrics (time of start of growing season, end of season, duration of growing season, and seasonally 
integrated greenness) was conducted for the conterminous US.  Results show that most of the changing trends in phenology of the US are 
caused by changes in land use or changes in agricultural practices (crop shifts, crop varieties, etc.).  This illustrates that human impacts on the 
land surface have potential far-reaching impacts on our global climate system. 
 
 
PHOSPHOROUS CONTROLS ON SOIL NITROGEN CONCENTRATIONS AND N-FIXATION RATES OF A RECOVERING SEMI-ARID

The UN Environment Programme estimates that 25% of earth’s land is threatened by desertification: defined as “land degradation in arid, 
semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas resulting from various factors, including climatic variations and human activities”. These vulnerable 
systems sustain the livelihoods of over 1 billion people in more than 100 countries.  While the causes of arid and semi-arid land degradation 
have become progressively clearer, understanding how land managers can better protect or reclaim these ecosystems is an increasingly 
important aspect of ecology. Nutrient controls on a variety of ecosystem processes were tested on a restored grassland on the front range of 
Colorado’s Rocky Mountains.  The grassland site resides on a reclaimed gravel pit that was planted to native grasses in 1997.  The site has 
been used since 2001 to study plant invasions and, as a part of this goal, phosphorus addition plots (+P) and phosphorus reduction plots (-P) 
were created. Three years after fertilization was begun, it was noticed that the +P plots had significantly higher inorganic nitrogen (N) 
concentrations than the control plots (p= <0.001). We hypothesized that the added P was enhancing the biological soil crust community’s 
ability to fix N from the atmosphere and add it to this ecosystem. We employed the acetylene reduction assay technique to test this hypothesis 
and found that the +P plots had over 2x the N-fixation rates of the control plots (p=0.036), fixing just over 5 Kg/ha/yr of N. The increase in soil 
N as a result of fertilization with P was an unwanted result in the original experiment but offers interesting opportunities for land management. 
It is possible that, by relieving a P limitation, recovering lands could receive a “natural” source of N in non-saturating quantities through 
enhancing the soil crust community’s ability to fix N. This adds support to the large body of knowledge showing the importance of biological 
soil crusts to arid and semi-arid ecosystem function and highlights possibilities for their employment in effective land regeneration and 
management.

In the past century, forest management practices have significantly altered the function and structure of southwestern ecosystems dominated 
by ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). Fire suppression, grazing, and logging of old, fire-resistant trees have resulted in a dense, closed 
canopy forest with an increased susceptibility to stand-replacing wildfire. Mechanical thinning and prescribed fire are important tools for 
mitigating the threat of stand-replacing wildfire. However, the effects of these practices on wildlife communities are not well understood. For 
three Fire and Fire Surrogates experimental sites in northern Arizona, we examined the response of avian communities to thinning and 
prescribed fire, alone and in combination. For a suite of focal species, we evaluated changes in density due to these different treatments. We 
also used multivariate techniques to compare species composition among treatments. This research provides new insight regarding avian 
community responses to fuels reduction treatments, allowing for empirically-based decisions about forest management and conservation.

THE DRAFT CAVE, KARST AND MINE MANAGEMENT PLAN, AND THE RAPID CAVE ASSESSMENT AND CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM, 
GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK 
 
RIHS, JOHN 
Grand Canyon National Park, P.O. Box 129, Grand Canyon, Arizona 86023, John_Rihs@nps.gov  
 
Grand Canyon National Park’s (GCNP) vast cave and karst systems, their cultural and natural resources, and the natural processes 
dependent on these environments, are poorly understood.  Concomitantly, these resources are experiencing increasing pressure from visitors.  
The National Park Service is mandated to proactively manage and protect these resources.  GCNP has developed a draft Cave, Karst and 
Mine Management Plan that provides guidelines and direction for the protection and management of cave and karst resources.  The plan 
contains specific rules, regulations, and protocols designed to protect resources while attempting to safeguard visitor enjoyment.  The plan 
outlines procedures for the systematic inventory, mapping, classification, and assessment of cave resources as well as and permit issuance.  
This plan recognizes visitor use demands and strives to addresses recreational use, resource protection, research, education, and public 
safety.  This plan will enable managers to make decisions on each cave use by:  1) identifying resources at risk, 2) setting appropriate 
recreational use levels and/or restrictions, and 3) identifying monitoring, research and restoration needs.   A Rapid Cave Assessment protocol 
was developed to provide consistent and detailed information needed to begin the classification process, make determinations and build a 
database. Cavers are asked to provide information on the cave in general as well as information specific to biologic, physical, paleontological, 
cultural resources and human impact. The Park also requests that cavers rank each cave according to specific values and provide 
recommendations for management. This information will provide the basis of a caves classification and hence define its management.  
Effective implementation of the plan is largely dependent on establishing strong partnerships with stakeholders and the general public.  
Volunteer recruitment will greatly accelerate this process and help in solidifying partnerships and support. 
 
 
IMPACTS OF DROUGHT, BEETLES, AND MANAGEMENT TREATMENTS ON FIRE BEHAVIOR IN PINYON/JUNIPER WOODLANDS 
 
ROCCA, MONIQUE, Neil Cobb, Kirsten Ironside, Bill Romme 
 
Climate change-induced alterations of fuel loads and fire weather will potentially affect wildfire behavior and fire regimes on the Colorado 
Plateau.  Predicting the direction and magnitude of climate effects on wildland fire is particularly challenging for pinyon/juniper woodlands, due 
to a scarcity of data on fire history and past climate-fire relationships in those ecosystems.  We approach our investigation of climate effects on 
wildland fire by using fire behavior models to ask how recent drought years and the widespread, drought-induced ips beetle (Ips confusus) 
mortality should be expected to alter fire behavior in P/J woodlands.  We then test our results using records of fire activity from the region over 
the last several years. We attempt to distinguish the immediate effects of pinyon mortality (increased available fuel loads) from longer-term 
changes in forest structure (stand-thinning) and climate-induced changes in ignition and spread probabilities.  While our results provide some 
guidelines for managing fire and fuels on the Colorado Plateau, better data on fuel loads and stand-structure are needed to more fully 
understand the effects of climate change on fire regimes.

We evaluated canopy fuel and potential fire behavior changes following landscape-scale restoration treatments in a ponderosa pine forest at 
Mt. Trumbull, Arizona. The goal of the project was to restore historical forest structure by thinning and burning, thereby reducing canopy fuels 
and minimizing the potential for active crown fire. We measured 117 permanent plots before (1996/1997) and after (2003) thinning and 
burning treatments. The plots were evenly distributed across the landscape and represented an area of approximately 1200 ha, about half of 
which was an untreated control. We compared canopy fuel estimates using three different methods to assess whether fire behavior modeling 
outputs were sensitive to the choice of canopy fuel equation. Basal area and tree density were decreased significantly from 32.6 m² to 18.9 m² 
and from 784.6 trees/ha to 399.2 trees/ha, respectively, in the treated area between 1996 and 2003 while the control did not change 
significantly over the same time period. Restoration treatments decreased canopy fuel load (CFL) from 7.7-18.3 Mg/ha to 4.4-9.1 Mg/ha (the 
range of values reflects three different canopy fuel equations) and decreased canopy bulk density (CBD) from 0.038-0.172 kg/m³ to 0.022-0.67 
kg/m³ in the treated area, while slight increases occurred in the control. We applied two simulation models to estimate potential fire behavior: 
FlamMap and Nexus. These models differ in several important features but predicted outcomes were consistent; under extreme drought and 
wind conditions, the proportion of the landscape susceptible to active crown fire and the mean patch size of these areas were both reduced in 
the treated area. In contrast, the models show little change in active crown fire susceptibility in the control over the same time period. We 
conclude that the restoration treatments have successfully addressed the project goals of reducing canopy fuels and the potential for active 
crown fire.

BIOLOGICAL SOIL CRUSTS AND WHY THEY ARE DISAPPEARING 
 
ROSENTRETER, ROGER

Biological soil crusts are composed of bryophytes, lichens, algae, and cyanobacteria.  These crusts were a common component in the arid 
and semiarid ecosystems of North America.  However, domestic livestock and other trampling enhanced the invasion of exotic annual grasses 
and has drastically changed the vegetation dynamics of the many arid regions. Clumped vegetation patterns have been replaced by more 
continuous annual grasslands. Livestock and human vehicle disturbance has broken the crusts and created a favorable seed bed for exotic 
annual grasses.  Scientists in Idaho have found that biological soil crusts inhibit exotic annuals such as cheatgrass, which minimizes the cover 
and biomass of this invasive species.  This change in cheatgrass distribution patterns greatly influences the risk of fire.  Inhibition of annual 
grasses such as, cheatgrass by biological soil crusts was investigated in the lab after such spatial patterns were observed in the field. The 
ecological significance of this crust and weedy annual grass interaction is critical to the future of the arid ecosystems.

Mountain lion management is at a critical juncture.  Rarely do researchers and managers have the opportunity to make management 
strategies for a species that is relatively abundant. More often, they find themselves fighting against rapidly declining species populations.  In 
the case of Puma concolor, species abundance is not necessarily the most important gauge for conservation.  From a socio-ecological 
perspective, human-cougar encounters, human injuries and fatalities, and cat fatalities due to encounters with the public are also important 
indicators of lion health. Currently, managers have the unique opportunity to maintain and conserve mountain lion abundance by addressing 
human dimensions issues before they pose a threat to lion populations.  We conducted a self-administered mail survey (n=693) of Northern 
Arizona residents during the summer of 2003 to analyze public concerns, support, and perceptions of mountain lions. The survey also 
explored underlying values that help explain demands and expectations of mountain lion management over the long term.  We used 
regression analyses to test how well various suites of potential explanatory variables (Demographics; BEP: behaviors, experiences, and 
predispositions; and Value Orientations) could predict responses of survey participants to management options.  Our results indicate that 
value orientations are not easily predicted by demographic characteristics or forest recreation activities. However, regression analyses 
revealed comparatively high R2 values (>0.23) when value orientations were used to predict mountain lion policy preferences.  These results 
are consistent with the hypothesis that policy preferences are strongly tied to value orientations. Conversely, these findings indicate that value 
orientations could be reliable indicators of public policy preferences.  Our results shed light on trends in public perceptions of carnivores and 
their management, as well as the extent to which  value orientations influence public policy preferences in Northern Arizona. Understanding 
public value orientations is a useful tool for wildlife managers and is also an important step toward alleviating the agency/citizen tension that 
surrounds mountain lion management issues.

The Stand Treatment Impact on Forest Health (STIFH) study was designed to assess and monitor over time the condition of forest 
ecosystems varying in stand structure and burn history within northern Arizona by identifying and using ecological indicators. We selected a 
subsample of STIFH plots to eliminate plots with basal area > 53 m2/ha. In 2004, we selected between three and four replicates of each of the 
four stand structures (unmanaged, commercial thin, thin and burn, and wildfire) for a total of 28 grazed plots.  In 2005, we added an additional 
12 plots to capture a mid-range (2 to 13 m2/ha ± 8 ) in basal area between the high basal area (5 to 53 m2/ha ± 22 ) of forested STIFH plots 
and the severe wildfire that was devoid of trees.  At each 20 X 50m plot we quantified herbaceous and overstory biomass.  Understory 
vegetation biomass was sampled by clipping plants to ground level in ten 0.25 m2 circular frames in each plot.  Plant material was separated 
by species, dried at 70 degrees C for a minimum of 48 hours and weighed.  Overstory tree measurements included diameter at breast height, 
which was used in regression equations to estimate total aboveground tree biomass from diameter at breast height measurements.  
Preliminary results suggest that aboveground biomass in unmanaged, thinned, and thinned and burned stands consisted of almost entirely 
woody material.  In contrast, biomass in areas burned severely in a 1996 wildfire consisted only of herbaceous plants.  Consequently woody 
biomass is directly related to herbaceous biomass in that herbaceous biomass declines as woody biomass increases.  In addition, herbaceous 
biomass increased significantly between 2004 and 2005 due to above average rainfall during the spring months of 2005.  This study is one of 
the few to attempt to quantify both herbaceous and woody biomass in southwestern ponderosa pine forests, and provides insights into plant 
production nine years after a severe wildfire.

Crucifixion Cave, located southeast of Flagstaff in the Coconino National Forest was discovered in 1984 when a group of recreational cavers 
enlarged a blowing lead in a large basalt collapse.  The group discovered over two miles of passages in the subsurface Kaibab Limestone and 
named the cave 'Crucifixion' in reference to historic graffiti near the entrance. From 1985 to 1988, recreational cavers explored and surveyed 
the cave noting the rare resources within.  In June of 1990, recreational cavers completed a photo monitoring evaluation of the most sensitive 
areas and plotted their locations on the cave survey map.  Since this time, the cave has been closed to recreational visitation.  This project 
seeks to evaluate visitation to the cave in the last 15 years by comparing photomonitoring results of 1990 to those of today.  A GIS has been 
created to plot the monitoring points and hyperlink the comparative photos for analysis. 
 
 
MANAGEMENT GOALS DRIVE THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADAPTIVE MODELS FOR FOREST CONSERVATION AND WILDLAND FIRE 
PLANNING AT MESA VERDE. 
 
SAN MIGUEL, GEORGE L.

Resource managers at Mesa Verde National Park were very receptive to the idea of modeling pinyon-juniper woodlands to guide critical 
decision making in the coming years. With a new Wildland Fire Management Plan in progress, the park quickly needed a better way of 
evaluating the long-term consequences of different management alternatives under different environmental pathways. The unique natural and 
scientific values of the park’s old-growth pinyon-juniper woodlands are at risk due to recent ecological changes driven by drought including 
high intensity wildfires, bark beetle infestations, rapid invasion of burned landscapes by non-native plants, and plans by some in the fire 
community for highly aggressive “fuels treatment” inside and outside the park. The concern was that these irreplaceable woodlands would not 
be sustainable at current loss rates in a relatively small management area that does not meet the minimum dynamic area required to sustain 
the full range of natural variability of the woodlands by natural processes alone. The information obtained from these studies would be crucial 
in developing long-term land management plans for the park with old-growth pinyon-juniper woodland conservation as a stated goal. The 
model would then be available for neighboring agencies and tribes as well.

Long-term data can be used to assess reference conditions and set restoration goals, quantify local levels of natural variability (both 
structurally and compositionally), quantify tree size, age, and spatial distributions at numerous points in time, and precisely describe trends in 
plant community dynamics.  We present preliminary results from two sets of historical permanent plots, the Woolsey and Hill plots, to illustrate 
the types of questions that can be asked and surprising results that require a long-term perspective.  We focus on tree demographics, spatial 
and temporal patterns, and mechanisms contributing to increased tree densities.  Specific results from these data sets include:  1) Ninety-one 
percent of the historically (1909-1913 or older) mapped tree structures (live trees, snags, logs, stumps, etc.) were successfully relocated, 
suggesting the forest reconstruction field techniques are reliable within 10%.  2) Between plot establishment (1909) and present (2002), stand 
density increased more than 11 fold from 51 TPH to 574 TPH on COCS1A.  Eighty-six percent of this increase occurred by 1949, when 
density reached 494 TPH.  3) Both before and after the initial harvest on COCS1A (1894), point pattern analysis shows a distinct peak in 
aggregation of trees from 7.0 to 8.5 m, indicating clumps of trees were approximately 0.02 ha in size.  Additional patterns suggest that new 
tree establishment first occurred in the grassy interspaces, then followed in the newly available growing space (harvested areas), and finally 
occurred under the canopy of live (unharvested) trees.  4) Tree densities were lower in areas subject to long-term livestock grazing than in 
areas protected from grazing since 1912.  While livestock grazing was a factor contributing to the pulse of ponderosa pine regeneration in the 
early 1900s, contemporary forests would be even denser than they are at present if grazing had not continued to occur in these forests.  We 
are exploring many other types of analyses, including the development of stand/community-level state/transition models and herbaceous plant 
demography/turnover models.  These data are also being used to test currently accepted models (growth, biomass, etc.) and to assess model 
utility giving special consideration to the spatial and temporal nature of the data.

PRACTICAL LESSONS LEARNED:  STRATEGIC APPROACHES OF THE FOSSIL CREEK ENVIRONMENTAL PARTNERS 
 
SCHLIMGEN-WILSON, MINDY 
639 Tiburon Drive, Prescott, AZ 86303, mindysw928@aol.com 
 
During the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) relicensing proceedings for the Childs-Irving Hydropower Plants, operated by 
Arizona Public Service (APS), leaders in Arizona’s environmental community recognized a rare ‘window of opportunity’ to make a difference in 
the future of Fossil Creek’s unique ecosystem.  In 1998, at the request of local interests, American Rivers hired me to initiate a collaboration of 
environmental interests that later became known as the Fossil Creek Environmental Partners and eventually grew to include seven 
organizations. Over 2 years, our strategic actions resulted in these outcomes: (1) APS signed an Agreement in Principle publicly pledging to 
decommission the hydropower facilities within the designated time frame; (2) APS led a series of facilitated discussions with interested parties 
to develop detailed plans for the decommissioning process; (3) a legal Settlement Agreement was finalized among critical stakeholders and 
APS, and then submitted to FERC.  In my opinion, there were several key principles that led to our success: (1) Identify and articulate a clear 
common goal. (2) Actively build and use a strong foundation of credible scientific research. (3) Build support (at a maximum) and 
understanding (at a minimum) across the full spectrum of interested parties. (4) Secure adequate funding, staff and volunteer resources for the 
entire time frame needed to make the desired change happen. (4) Respectfully nurture relationships among strategic individuals, to open and 
maintain dialog that could discover common ground among divergent viewpoints. (5) Be inclusive of all interested parties, giving credit and 
appreciation freely.  Strengthening collaboration among environmental organizations, agency staff and decision-makers, and a corporation has 
proven to be an effective tool for ecosystem restoration at Fossil Creek.  Although it wasn’t strategy, the other critical element was the 
corporate leadership at APS that recognized their demonstration of environmental ethics on the ground could create a corporate asset of its 
own kind. 
 
PRELIMINARY HOME RANGE AND LIFE HISTORY FROM RADIO TELEMETRY OF CROTALUS OREGANUS CERBERUS, THE ARIZONA 
BLACK RATTLESNAKE

The Arizona Black rattlesnake, Crotalus oreganus cerberus, is a morphologically distinct rattlesnake snake species found only at higher 
elevations in Arizona.  It does not have state or federal listing status.  This species was recently determined to be a sister taxon to the western 
clade of the Crotalus viridis complex using mitochondrial DNA analyses (Pook et al. 2000, Douglas et al. 2001).  Morphological differences are 
observable from other clades within the complex through color, elevation distribution, and possibly size.  While range has been established 
(Stebbins 1985, Klauber 1972), general ecology and life history are poorly understood.  Two communal hibernation den sites of C.o cerberus 
at sites near Flagstaff, Arizona provides an opportunity for study of the species.  Colorado Plateau Research Station biologists have 
seasonally visited the dens in the spring and fall since 1999.  During this time, 124 captures of 87 individual rattlesnakes were marked and 
recorded using Passive Integrated Microchip Transponders (PIT tags).  In April of 2005 I initiated a radio telemetry study as part of a Masters 
of Biological Science on this northernmost distribution of the species.  It is the first ever life history study specifically conducted on the species 
expanding upon our research begun at CPRS (Nowak and Schofer 2005).  The telemetry study focuses on male home range movement 
patterns and ecology. The den sites in northern Arizona were used to obtain a sample size of 11 males.  Preliminary results using Geographic 
Information Systems indicate male home range sizes are between one to two square kilometers.  Life history observed from the first season of 
data revealed hunting strategies, insight into diverse prey items they are choosing, timing and frequency of ecdysis, dispersal and return dates 
to the dens, and mating strategies.  Preliminary findings of the research indicate that woody debris plays a significant ecological role for C. o. 
cerberus in northern Arizona.  As understanding the requirements of a species is the key to managing for it, the telemetry effort has a high 
degree of biological significance. This study will aid government agencies in understanding ecological requirements of an elusive and 
unstudied reptile predator of the Colorado Plateau.

Semi-arid grasslands of the Southwest U.S. have undergone dramatic vegetation changes over the last 130 years, including encroachment by 
shrubs, loss of perennial grass cover, and spread of non-native species. The lack of wildfires has played an important role in these changes as 
fires reduce or kill shrubs and increase cover of perennial grasses and forbs; without fire, shrubs increase and compete with perennial grasses 
for water and nutrients. Changes in semi-arid grassland composition and structure have not occurred uniformly across the region and their 
extent and distribution are poorly understood at  regional and broader scales. The purpose of this study was to rapidly assess and 
characterize the extent of the vegetation changes to grasslands in Arizona, and to identify the best remaining native grasslands and restorable 
grasslands for ecological management purposes. To complete the study, an expert-based approach was used to develop a broad-scale, rapid 
assessment of grasslands, interviewing 39 range management specialist from the Arizona State Land Department, Bureau of Land 
Management, Forest Service, Natural Resources Conservation Service, New Mexico Natural Heritage Program, The Nature Conservancy, 
and the University of Arizona. Expert input was verified and corrected where necessary through extensive field reconnaissance and 
quantitative vegetation sampling at random sampling points. Experts identified over 24.5 million acres of extant or former (historic) grasslands 
in AZ, or 34% of AZ’s land surface; 14.2 million acres (58%) is of a known condition type. Of this, more than half is native grassland --a 
majority of which may be restorable with the use of prescribed fire. Conversely, Arizona has already lost over a quarter (27%) of its semi-arid 
grasslands during the last century due to shrub encroachment.  Future protection and restoration of native grasslands will continue to involve 
the AZ State Land Department, federal land management agencies, (e.g. the Bureau of Land Management and the USDA Forest Service) 
and, in particular, private landowners.

detected in their riparian habitats.  Findings indicate similar research and monitoring objectives for riparian habitats across the Colorado 
Plateau, with alien taxa spread a prime concern.  We will delineate the common trends across projects and suggest areas for improvement to 
help us better understand these ecologically diverse and sensitive habitats on the Colorado Plateau.  
 
 
INTERIOR WEST FOREST INVENTORY AND ANALYSIS: A DESCRIPTION OF THE PROGRAM AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR 
COLLABORATION

Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA), previously known as Forest Survey, is one of the oldest research and development programs in the U.S. 
Forest Service.  While forming the research branch of the Forest Service, the U.S. Congress charged it to find “facts as may be necessary in 
the determination of ways and means to balance the timber budget of the United States”.  As a result, Forest Survey maintained a timber 
focus for much its history.  As society’s interest in forests changed over time, so did information needs.  In response, the Forest Inventory and 
Analysis program has evolved from Forest Survey to address diverse topics such as forest health, carbon storage, wildlife habitat, air pollution, 
and invasive plants, while remaining true to its mandate to monitor the Nation’s timber supply.  The Forest Inventory and Analysis program 
now collects data on all land ownerships on an annual basis and makes the data available to the public at no cost.  Exact locations of field 
plots are kept confidential to maintain plot integrity and to meet privacy requirements for data collected on private lands, as mandated by 
Congress in the 1998 Farm Bill.  Although readily available, FIA data are underutilized by the scientific community.  Some reasons for this 
situation include lack of awareness about the data, perception of the program as a “timber inventory”, the complex nature of the database, and 
perceived limitations to use imposed by privacy requirements.  In fact, practical limitations to use of the data are few.  The Interior West Forest 
Inventory and Analysis Program, the FIA database, and potential avenues for collaboration and data use are discussed.

Mycorrhizas are symbiotic associations between fungi and the roots of higher plants.  80-95% of terrestrial plants form obligate or facultative 
mycorrhizal associations. Plants provide sugars to the fungi, and in return, the fungi promote nutrient and water absorption that can lead to 
faster plant growth and protection against drought and pathogens. Mycorrhizas can improve soil structure and facilitate plant species diversity. 
Because of these benefits, mycorrhizal inocula can play a vital role in ecosystem restoration. In dynamic and heterogeneous riparian (riverine) 
ecosystems, knowledge of the spatial distribution of mycorrhizal propagules can aid restorationists.  This study was conducted at a river site 
slated for future restoration to examine whether mycorrhizal fungi levels varied between surfaces with different flood frequencies. Soil samples 
were collected along the Virgin River in Zion National Park from areas of varying distances and relative elevations from the river, and thus with 
different flood return intervals.  To examine mycorrhizal infection levels, a fast growing grass was grown in collected soil at a greenhouse as a 
host for mycorrhizal inocula. Roots were harvested, prepared, and inspected under a microscope from which the mycorrhizal infection percent 
was computed.  Arcsine transformed data were analyzed using a 2-way ANOVA. Although there was a trend of decreasing mycorrhizal 
infection levels as flood return intervals increased, the differences were not statistically significant.  Further analysis will explore correlations 
between mychorrhizal propagule levels and proximal vegetation species and density. 
 
 
VEGETATION AND SEED BANKS OF THE ZION RIVER RIPARIAN CORRIDOR (UTAH): IMPLICATIONS FOR RESTORATION 
 
SHORROCK, DONNA, Stromberg, Julie 
Arizona State University, School of Life Sciences, LSE Bldg., Tempe, AZ 85287 
 
Traditional efforts to restore denuded riparian habitats have met with limited success. Consequently, rather than treating symptoms of 
degradation, restorationists are beginning to focus on restoring systems’ underlying ecological processes. This study takes place along the 
Virgin River in Zion National Park. Flood control measures have reduced overbank flooding, disconnecting many floodplain surfaces from the 
river. Characterized by cottonwood forests, this riparian corridor is reliant upon fluvial processes to facilitate seedling recruitment. On the 
disconnected surfaces, few new cohorts are establishing and the herbaceous vegetation is becoming more xeric. Concerned about the future 
of this habitat, Park resource managers are considering several restoration methods. By mandate, they must preserve the genetic integrity of 
Park species. One method to accommodate this goal is to utilize local soil seed banks. To examine riparian seed banks, soil cores were 
collected along the river from areas of varying distances and relative elevations from the river. The seedling emergence method was used to 
identify plant species grown in controlled ambient conditions resembling those in situ. Seed abundance, species diversity and richness were 
ascertained and seed bank species composition was compared with corresponding extant vegetation.  Results indicated that seed bank 
species richness and abundance was greater in actively flooded areas than in those rarely inundated. Nevertheless, many riparian seedlings 
emerged from drier soils implying that the seed bank may facilitate revegetation, should restorative efforts to connect the river and its 
floodplain be undertaken.

EXOTIC INVASIVE PLANTS OF SOUTHWESTERN PONDEROSA PINE FORESTS: MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH PRIORITIES

Dozens of non-native plant species have been introduced to southwestern ponderosa pine forests.  The introductions have been so numerous 
and widespread that the goal of eradicating all exotic plants is no longer feasible.  Instead land managers and researchers must prioritize 
limited funding to focus on those species that have the greatest potential to cause undesirable and irreversible changes in plant communities.  
Unfortunately, there is not an agreed upon method for prioritizing which species to target.  State noxious weed lists can provide insights into 
potential problem species, but noxious weed definitions vary from state to state and often focus on those species that occur in agricultural 
fields.  A number of strategies for prioritizing invader species of wildlands have been proposed in recent years.  In addition to the stage of the 
invasion, factors such as ecological impact, invasive potential, ecological amplitude, current distribution and abundance, and trend in 
distribution and abundance have been used to categorize the invasive potential of non-native species in wildlands.  Unfortunately, for many of 
these recently introduced species, we have a poor understanding of their distribution, abundance, impacts on native plant communities in this 
region, and reliance on disturbances for their spread.  A number of research and monitoring steps are needed to begin to fill knowledge gaps.  
The development of electronic databases of herbarium collections will enhance our understanding of what non-native species are present in 
the region, when they were first collected, and how widespread they have become.  Long-term data collection on permanent plots provides 
additional insights into the persistence and spread of specific non-native species.  Opportunistic sampling on wildfires and experimental 
studies that explore how various types and severities of disturbances influence populations of non-native species are needed to understand 
mechanisms involved in the spread of specific species.  Research is also needed to quantify the role of roads and specific management 
practices in the spread of non-native species and how native plant communities can be restored in areas severely infested with invasive exotic 
plants.

California condors (Gymnogyps californianus) were reintroduced in Arizona in 1996.  As of July 1, 2005 there are 53 free-flying condors in the 
state.  Additionally, 5 chicks have been hatched in the wild. Condor exposure to lead is one factor affecting the success of the reintroduction 
program.  There have been 164 documented cases of lead exposure since 1999.  As of April 2005, 6 condor deaths have been attributed by 
necropsy to lead poisoning.  While there may be other ways lead is acquired, we are working on reducing exposure from spent ammunition.  
There are two parallel processes ongoing. The first is a national effort to form sportsmen’s coalitions to raise awareness and engage hunters 
in voluntarily reducing lead exposure potential in condor range.  The second is an Arizona program to provide free non-lead ammunition to 
hunters in condor range as well as the use of GPS satellite transmitters to carefully track condor movements so that feeding behavior and 
potential lead exposure can be monitored.  The outreach programs are based on background research including scientific telephone surveys 
of hunters, development of test messages, testing of these messages through focus groups and development of a communication plan.  
Based on surveys only 23% of Arizona hunters were aware that lead poisoning is an issue in condor recovery, and 77-98% were willing to 
take some action if credible lead exposure data were made available.  Additionally, lead isotope research is underway to investigate any link 
between lead ammunition and condor lead exposure.  Preliminary results have confirmed a direct match between lead ammunition fragments 
and lead found in a condor blood sample.  Information on condors and lead has been published for 3 years in the Arizona Hunting Regulations 
and individual mailings have been sent to hunters in condor range asking them to assist in limiting the amount of lead condors are exposed to 
from spent ammunition.  We hope that these voluntary programs result in lower lead exposure over coming years.  
 
 
MODELING EDGE EFFECTS INCREASES RELEVANCE OF FIELD RESEARCH IN HABITAT MANAGEMENT.

The study of “edge effects” – the influence of surrounding habitats on a focal patch or study area – has a long history in ecology.  Since the 
1930’s researchers have conducted hundreds of field studies documenting diverse influences on many taxa and highlighting the pervasive 
influence of edges on habitat quality.  However, consideration of edge effects in habitat planning and management has been slow to develop, 
with vague generalizations and overly simplistic rules of thumb dominating the treatment of edge effects in textbooks and management plans.  
Recent theoretical treatments and literature reviews have pointed out some coherency in scientific understanding, while management models 
that apply this knowledge to real landscapes have given managers a tractable approach for integrating edge effects into their planning and 
field activities.  We describe the Effective Area Model and its uses in bridging from our improved scientific understanding to practical 
applications of edge effects in managing real landscapes.

The Greater Flagstaff Forests Partnership, in conjunction with the US Forest Service and several other entities, has endeavored since 1997 to 
restore ponderosa pine forests, and reduce the risk of uncharacteristic fire and its potential impact on residents of Flagstaff and surrounding 
communities. Through collaborative project design and management, several approaches to forest restoration have been attempted, but not 
all of these approaches and their effects on fuels reduction and potential fire behavior have been quantified or reported. We collected data 
from areas that either have been mechanically thinned through various silvicultural prescriptions, or burned with managed fire prescriptions, or 
both. Plot data collected according to standard US Forest Service specifications were analyzed for summary statistics, and were run through 
the potential fire behavior program NEXUS to compare the different treatments, and to compare with controls. Fuels reduction efforts have 
varying effects on the probability of a surface fire moving into the crowns of trees, and on the potential intensity and duration of fire events 
(data currently are being analyzed). We also discuss the importance of collecting fuels data prior to treatment to isolate the effects of 
preexisting stand characteristics from treatment effects.

The encroachment of piñon and juniper trees into historically shrub-dominated landscapes has caused major changes in ecosystem structure 
and function, including dramatic changes in fuel structure and fire regimes. Restoration techniques are often labor intensive and expensive to 
implement, so it is prudent to determine their effectiveness before they are applied over large areas.  Land managers on the Shivwits Plateau 
in northwestern Arizona are currently faced with thousands of acres of tree-invaded shrublands, some within wildland/urban interface areas, 
and are seeking effective techniques to restore these areas to pre-invasion conditions and reduce wildfire hazards in the process.  We 
established a study on the Shivwits Plateau to test the effectiveness of 3 techniques for reducing the density of post-invasion pinyon and 
juniper trees: (1) cut and leave, where 80% of the trees were cut down and left where they fell; (2) cut and scatter, where 80% of the trees 
were cut down, then bucked and scattered; and (3) herbicide, in which 80% of the trees were sprayed with Tordon 22k around the base of 
their trunks. Treatment plots were 20 acres, with 8 replicates each of the 3 treatments plus an untreated control. Different methods were 
utilized in an attempt to characterize changes in the fuelbed structure and will be compared. Generally speaking, there was more shrub and 
herbaceous development in the treatment units versus the control units as well as an addition of woody fuels to the initially sparse sites that 
would help to carry surface fire through the treated areas. This information will be used to determine anticipated differences fire behavior and 
fire effects using software such as BehavePlus3.  
 
 
DECOMMISSIONING THE CHILDS-IRVING HYDROELECTRIC FACILITIES

The Childs and Irving Power Plants on Fossil Creek were Arizona’s first commercial hydroelectric power plants. They are located near Fossil 
Creek surrounded by the rugged beauty of the Mogollon Rim country. In 1908, when construction began on the facilities, the design and 
remote location made Childs-Irving a logistical and engineering marvel.  To spin the turbines, nearly all of Fossil Creek’s flows were diverted to 
Childs and Irving for nearly a century.  In the late 1990’s Arizona Public Service Company – the developer, owner and operator of these 
facilities – decided to decommission these facilities and work to restore of Fossil Creek.  APS formally filed a surrender application with the 
Federal Energy Regulating Commission in early 2001. For the past seven years, APS has worked closely with environmental organizations, 
historical groups, and agencies of the federal, state, county and local governments to support the surrender and removal of these facilities.  
The Childs-Irving facilities, situated on U.S. Forest Service lands, are listed on the National Historic Register and are American Society of 
Mechanical Engineering Historic Landmarks. APS has navigated through processes mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act and 
the National Historic Preservation Act, and addressed other federal, state, county and local issues to move forward with the decommissioning 
of these facilities. APS is currently proceeding with approved decommissioning of the historic facilities.  Following restoration of full flow to 
Fossil Creek in June 2005, the state’s largest electric utility began the deconstruction of plant facilities, which will be completed by the end of 
2010.

IS SALTCEDAR HABITAT ALWAYS BAD FOR BIRDS? LESSONS FROM STUDIES OF THE SOUTHWESTERN WILLOW FLYCATCHER

The Southwestern Willow Flycatcher (Empidonax traillii extimus: SWWF) is a riparian-obligate bird that breeds only in dense, typically wet 
riparian vegetation. In the mid-1990s, biologists discovered a substantial number of flycatchers breeding in habitat dominated by exotic 
saltcedar (Tamarix ramosissima). SWWFs nest in saltcedar-dominated riparian habitats at sites in Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, and Utah. 
Approximately 25% of SWWF breeding sites, supporting one-third of the roughly 1,300 known flycatcher territories, are in saltcedar-dominated 
sites. Just as SWWFs do not breed in all native-dominated riparian habitat patches, they breed in only a small fraction (<1%) of the saltcedar 
habitats that are present in the w. U.S. Although diet of flycatchers in native and saltcedar habitats differs, dietary differences are not proof that 
food resources are limiting or insufficient in one habitat compared to the other. Therefore, studies were conducted to determine if there are 
negative effects to SWWFs breeding in saltcedar. Long-term (1996 to present) studies of flycatcher physiology, immunology, site fidelity, 
productivity, and survivorship found no evidence that nesting in saltcedar dominated habitat is detrimental to Willow Flycatchers at breeding 
sites in central Arizona. It is likely that saltcedar habitats vary with respect to suitability for breeding flycatchers, just as do native habitats. 
Therefore, results from a single study or site may not be applicable across the ranges of the SWWF or saltcedar. Ultimately, multiple long-term 
studies over a large geographic area must be compared to determine the relative suitability of native and saltcedar habitats at the landscape 
scale. 
 
 
UNDERSTORY VEGETATION RESPONSES TO GROUP SELECTION THINNING AND PRESCRIBED FIRE AT THE ARIZONA FIRE AND 
FIRE SURROGATE SITES

Over the past century, Southwest ponderosa pine forests have become increasingly denser due to factors such as the reduction of a frequent, 
low intensity natural fire regime.  One of the results of this denser forest is the depletion of an understory consisting of grasses and forbs that 
once drove ground fires, which in turn naturally managed overstory densities.  In an effort to better understand the roll of these understory 
species and their importance in ecosystem restoration, we studied understory vegetation responses to group selection thinning of ponderosa 
pine and surface prescribed fire at the Southwest Plateau Fire and Fire Surrogate sites.  Understory vegetation data was collected on 
Modified-Whittaker plots based after Stohlgren on ten 20x50m plots per treatment type at each of the three sites (120 total plots), both pre-
treatment and two years after treatments.  On each 20x50m plot, species richness and basal cover was collected on ten 1m² sub-plots, and 
species presence or absence was collected on two 10m² and one 100m² sub-plots.  The richness on these plots was used to produce species-
area curves for predicting richness on a large scale in response to the overstory treatments and prescribed fire.  We found that with increasing 
levels of management intensities (unmanaged, prescribed burn, group selection thinning, and thinning combined with burning), species 
richness and percent area covered by understory vegetation increased, accounting for pre-treatment difference between stands and sites.  
Management implications of these results suggest that more intensive management regimes contribute to a higher density of both native and 
exotic vegetation, which may influence fire behavior, ungulate grazing and browsing, and other forest health issues. 
 
 
SUMMARY OF THE 1996-2000 GCMRC BIRD MONITORING PROGRAM ALONG THE COLORADO RIVER 
 
SPENCE, JOHN R. 
Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, PO Box 1507, Page, AZ  86040, John_Spence@nps.gov 
 
A summary of a 5-year effort to develop a monitoring program and collect baseline data on the aquatic and riparian avifauna of the Colorado 
River from Glen Canyon Dam to upper Lake Mead is presented.  Data were collected for terrestrial breeding and wintering birds in the riparian 
zone, and for aquatic wintering birds.  Breeding bird data was collected from 1700 fixed radius point counts in 62 patches of riparian 
vegetation.  Winter terrestrial birds were sampled with 332 area searches in 85 patches, while aquatic birds were counted while floating the 
river corridor during six winter trips.  Riparian vegetation patches were characterized by principal plant species, and volume determined using 
the total vegetation volume (TVV) method.  The winter terrestrial bird community was more diverse than the breeding community (75 vs. 32 
species), while 42 aquatic species were detected.  Aquatic bird abundance was strongly correlated with river location, a proxy variable for 
primary productivity.  Turbidity gradients vary exponentially downstream from the dam and bird abundance was highly correlated with turbidity. 
Strong and in many cases significant correlations were found between many riparian breeding and wintering terrestrial species and selected 
plant variables.  Patch location along the river corridor was found to be a good predictor of many bird species, and significant differences were 
found in different reaches along the river corridor for many plant and bird variables.  Based on MRPP and Mantel’s test, significant positive 
relationships were found between distance matrices of winter terrestrial bird, breeding riparian birds, and vegetation datasets.  This suggests 
that vegetation composition and structure affect both bird communities in similar ways. Retrospective power analyses were conducted on 
breeding riparian bird and winter terrestrial birds.  Sufficient power to detect larger trend rates (>10% change/year) existed for only a few bird 
species over a time frame of 10 years, including eight breeding and four wintering species.  Hence most species within the study area were 
not abundant enough to be monitored by the logistically intensive 1996-2000 program.  Recommendations are made for future avifaunal 
monitoring by Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center and the Adaptive Monitoring Program.

THE RETURN OF FLOWS TO FOSSIL CREEK, AN IDEA WHOSE TIME HAD COME 
 
STEFFERUD, JEROME A. 
315 E. Medlock Drive, Phoenix, Arizona 85012, Stefferud@cox.net 
 
In late 1989, an innocuous memo from Arizona Public Service Company (APS) came to the Forest Service – where I worked as a fisheries 
biologist – announcing that they were beginning the process for relicensing of their Childs-Irving Hydroelectric facility on Fossil Creek.  The 
memo explained that APS expected no change in operation as a result of relicensing, and that involvement of the Forest Service in the 
relicensing was expected to be minimal.  Thus began my involvement with the long process of negotiation between APS, Forest Service, 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Arizona Game and Fish Department, multiple other federal, state, and county agencies, Native 
American tribes, and a coalition of conservation groups that finally culminated in decommissioning of the project, and restoration of the native 
fishery in Fossil Creek in 2004.  Although nobody in 1989 expected increased flows into Fossil Creek, there was consensus that APS should 
conduct studies that would address how the flora and fauna of Fossil Creek would react to different flow releases.  The agencies insisted that 
a range of mean flows between operational conditions (near 0 cfs) and historical flows (43 cfs) needed to be analyzed.  APS conducted many 
ecological studies using Instream Flow Incremental Methodology, to predict the likely responses of endangered species, riparian vegetation, 
and the entire biota to different potential flow regimes.  As these studies progressed, agency personnel and conservationists began to hope for 
increased flows into Fossil Creek.  By 1994, the idea of full restoration of flows had coalesced among the conservation groups, and in 1999, 
the Forest Service bought into the idea.  During 1990-1999, the Forest Service provided input via innumerable meetings with and memos to 
APS in their development of an application for license renewal, and then FERC for their drafting of NEPA documentation.  As a public servant 
and citizen-conservationist involved throughout this process, I offer my perspectives on how to effectively participate in this sort of effort.

Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus anatum) foraging is difficult to observe and quantify in topographically complex terrain, and therefore is 
relatively poorly understood in southwestern canyons, where the species is recovering rapidly. We compiled observations of 355 Peregrine 
foraging events from our field notes and those of competent river runners downstream from Glen Canyon Dam on the Colorado River between 
1973 and 1995. We documented prey species abundance, and Peregrine foraging behavior and foraging success.  Peregrines attempted to 
forage on >45 prey species, including at least 39 bird species:  swifts and swallows (29%), waterfowl (27%), other birds (22%), bats (10%) and 
large wasps (8%).  Foraging frequency was positively related to prey abundance, and we observed greater relative predation intensity (RPI; 
the ratio of prey attack frequency to prey abundance), in the more turbid lower Grand Canyon where prey were less abundant.  Air-to-air 
foraging attempts were most common (94% of 271 cases for which data were available), followed by air-to-water attempts (4%), and air-to-
ground attempts (2%).  Tandem foraging occurred in >43% of 168 cases, particularly in the breeding and post-breeding seasons.  Overall 
foraging success was >52%, and was highest on large wasps (100%) and bats (87%); intermediate on large waterbirds (63%), swifts and 
swallows (42%), small terrestrial birds (42%), and waterfowl (40%); and low on belted kingfishers (18%) and small shorebirds.  Foraging 
success was positively related to relative prey abundance and the number of falcons foraging together, and was negatively related to relative 
prey body mass.  Most dietary biomass was derived from waterfowl (64%) and large waterbirds (25%); swallows and swifts contributed only 
3% of the dietary biomass.  Foraging success may be influenced by prey flight behavior.  Our data indicate that dam-related turbidity 
characteristics affect Peregrine prey abundance and RPI, but not falcon distribution or foraging success. 
 
 
SAFETY AND PREPAREDNESS OF DAY HIKERS AT GRAND CANYON

Day hikers in the backcountry at Grand Canyon comprise a substantial segment of the 4.5 million annual visitors to the park.  During the 
unusually hot summers of the mid-1990s, day hiker safety and preparedness became an issue due to an increase in search and rescue 
operations (SAR).  The "Heat Kills, Hike Smart" campaign emerged as a response to the increase in SARs, and has been evaluated and 
slightly revised since its inception.  This paper reports on a recent visitor study conducted in 2004 that interviewed close to 2,000 day hikers 
across seven different trails in the park's backcountry. Although the multiple objective study covered a comprehensive array of issues, this 
paper examines hiker preparedness and knowledge of low impact practices. Part of the concern for safety of day hikers involves their 
preparedness regarding items taken on their hike.  When compared to day hikers of the South Rim corridor trails (Bright Angel, South Kaibab), 
day hikers of the threshold trails (Grandview, Hermit) were least likely to bring water, electrolyte replacement, map, sunscreen, and food.  
There were 13% of respondents of the threshold trails who indicated they did not bring sufficient water on their day hike, compared to 5% of 
respondents on both corridor and North Rim trails who reported the same. However day hikers on the threshold trails generally went on much 
shorter hikes compared to either corridor or North Rim hikers. For example, 42% of threshold respondents traveled less than 1.5 miles 
compared to about 16% of corridor and North Rim respondents who traveled this distance or less. Day hikers knowledge of minimum impact 
practices was fairly consistent across trails.  Hikers with more previous hiking experiences were more knowledgeable compared to novice 
hikers.  The least understood low impact behavior was related to human wastes and appropriate sanitary behavior. For example, 58% of 
respondents did not recognize the need to pack out toilet paper, and instead thought that burying it was appropriate behavior.  The results 
suggest that hiking safety and low impact interpretive messages are being received by a majority of day hikers and that such information 
influences their hiking behavior.

We surveyed for nonnative fishes stranded in isolated pools near Grand Falls in the Little Colorado River (LCR), Arizona after the river ceased 
flowing (21 June and 12 July 2005) to evaluate whether nonnative fishes can invade the perennial, lower 21 km of the LCR from upriver 
sources.  The encroachment of nonnative fishes could jeopardize resident populations of endangered humpback chub, Gila cypha, and other 
native fishes in the lower LCR.  We captured black bullhead, Ameiurus melas, common carp, Cyprinus carpio, fathead minnow, Pimephales 
promelas, red shiner, Cyprinella lutrensis, and plains killifish, Fundulus zebrinus, all of which have been captured >132 km downriver in the 
lower LCR and 127 km upriver in the closest reservoir.  Moreover, we detected Asian tapeworm, Bothriocephalus acheilognathi, in 9 of 30 
common carp examined.  Our findings suggest that nonnative fishes, including ones hosting parasites, can invade the lower LCR from upriver 
sources >250 km away during freshets and provide a mechanism for the dispersal of invasive aquatic species in intermittent river systems.

The 2002 Rodeo-Chediski fire was the largest wildfire in Arizona history, and exhibited some of the most extreme fire behavior ever seen in 
the Southwestern United States.  On the White Mountain Apache Tribal lands within the burn area, pre-fire fuel reduction treatments of 
thinning, timber harvesting, and prescribed burning set the stage for a test of the upper boundary of effectiveness of fuel reduction treatments 
at decreasing burn severity.  We sampled 90 six-hectare study sites two years after the fire, representing 30% (34,000 ha) of the entire burn 
area on White Mountain Apache Tribe lands, and comprising a matrix of three burn severities (low, moderate, or high) and three treatments 
(cutting and prescribed burning, prescribed burning only, or no treatment).  Our findings indicate that thinning, timber harvesting, and 
prescribed burning were associated with reduced burn severity even in an extraordinarily intense fire, provided that the treatments occurred 
within the decade before the fire.  Prescribed burning without cutting reduced burn severity considerably, but the combination of cutting and 
prescribed burning had the greatest ameliorative effect.  While burn severity explained more of the variation in forest structure than did 
treatments, increasing degree of treatment was associated with an increase in the number of live trees and a decrease in the extremity of fire 
behavior as indicated by crown base height and bole char height. Ponderosa pine regeneration was very low in untreated areas, with no 
ponderosa regeneration whatsoever in high severity untreated areas.  Over half the study area had no ponderosa regeneration, and 16% of 
the study area had no ponderosa regeneration and no surviving ponderosa trees.  Future forest development will most likely take one of two 
trajectories: recovery to a ponderosa pine/Gambel oak forest or a shift to an oak-dominated shrubfield state, with untreated and high-severity 
areas more apt to undergo a type conversion.

Many forests in the western U.S. currently have unnaturally high fuel loads.  These loads have changed the fire dynamic from one of 
historically frequent surface fires to catastrophic crown fires.  In an effort to restore forests, managers have prescribed fire, thinned 
mechanically, and combined the techniques.  Uncertainty surrounds the effects of these alternative treatments.  The US Joint Fires Sciences 
program funded a national study to address the ecological effects, economic impacts, and fire hazard reduction of these alternatives.  Here, 
we report the impacts of the three treatments, mechanical thinning, burning, and thinning and burning, on the forest soils of three non-
contiguous Pinus ponderosa stands on the Southwest Plateau near Flagstaff, AZ.  We examined 1) functional diversity by looking at carbon 
substrate utilization patterns, 2) extracellular enzyme activity assays, 3) nitrogen mineralization, 4) cation exchange capacity, as well as 5) pH 
and 6) bulk density.  In the short term, we have discovered large and divergent impacts on the soil from the three different silviculture 
treatments.  Long term (decadal) impacts are not yet clear; we hope that this original five-year study can extend long enough to address these 
more long-term effects.

ASSESSING CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON SOUTHWEST FORESTS AND WOODLANDS: IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND 
MANAGEMENT   
 
SWETNAM, TOM 
Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 
 
Like many states in the western U.S., Arizona has experienced extreme drought, enormous wildfires and forest insect outbreaks in recent 
years. Invasive species are beginning to generate wholesale changes in desert ecosystems via increased wildfire occurrence.  Climate 
changes due to greenhouse gas emissions are expected to result in warmer seasonal temperatures in the Southwest in coming decades, with 
a likely continuation of conditions that promote these massive ecological disturbances. The Governor of Arizona, Janet Napolitano, has taken 
a leading role in initiating policy assessments and changes within the state and in the west to address drought and wildfire issues.  She has 
also initiated a process to assess greenhouse gas emissions from Arizona (from both anthropogenic and anthropogenic sources) and to move 
toward strategies and policies to reduce these emissions.  I will discuss projects and goals of two citizen advisory boards that the Governor 
has established that are beginning to address climate variability and change and effects on forest and woodlands in Arizona and the 
Southwest:  The Forest Health Advisory and Oversight Councils (http://www.governor.state.az.us/FHC/ ), and the Climate Change Advisory 
Group (http://www.azclimatechange.us/index.cfm).  Both of these advisory groups have a significant need for scientific and technical advice 
from experts within the state and elsewhere.  The Governor’s initiative to create these advisory boards is laudable, but there is a need for the 
scientific community to be more directly and broadly engaged in these efforts.  Policy initiatives should move forward rapidly, but they should 
be founded upon the best available climate change science. 
 
 
INVASIVE SPECIES NETWORKS: CHALLENGES FOR THE COLORADO PLATEAU

Invasive non-native species - plants, animals, and microbes - can pose economic, ecological, and social threats to the ecosystems they infest.  
No cultural and natural setting of the Colorado Plateau is exempt of the risk of infestation and resulting impacts.  In this presentation, we 
examine the existing structures for sharing technical and scientific information on invasive, non-native plants (weeds) within the four corner 
states that encompass the Colorado Plateau.  Invasive species do not respect administrative boundaries.  Recognition of this has spurred 
federal, state, county, and local agencies to seek ways to cooperate in developing management strategies and providing education through 
geographically based cooperative weed management areas or county-based districts.  Other mechanisms of communication and data sharing 
have formally and informally developed including weed based workshops and conferences, list-serve distribution of information, web-based 
informational pages, advisory councils, and a regional occurrence database.  Often the scientific research community has focused on the 
impacts and management of a weed as may be expressed in one environmental context - urban, agricultural, rangeland or wildland - rather 
than the entire environmental amplitude of the weed.  As a result, weed impacts may be understood for some cultural and natural settings but 
not regionally.  The academic and federal research community has a challenge to focus their investigations toward understanding the impacts, 
ecology, and behavior of invasive plants across the Colorado Plateau and to communicate their findings in a regionally effective manner.

The Southwest Regional Gap Analysis Program (SWReGAP) has mapped land cover types in the 5-state southwest region using ecological 
systems to describe natural and semi-natural vegetation.  The SWReGAP ecological system labels are derived from the Terrestrial Ecological 
Systems Classification framework developed by NatureServe and are linked to the National Vegetation Classification through associations and 
alliances.  In the entire land cover map over 125 land cover types, including 109 ecological systems, 11 "disturbed/altered" sites, and 5 land 
cover classes, are mapped at a 1-acre resolution.  In this talk, we present a tour of representative ecological systems in the context of the 
Colorado Plateau and discuss some of the challenges that arose in describing and mapping particular ecological systems. 
 
 
SWEMP: DOCUMENTING INVASIVE NON-NATIVE PLANT OCCURRENCES REGIONALLY

The U.S. Geographic Survey's Southwest Exotic Plant Mapping Project (SWEMP) facilitates the development of a regional database of 
invasive non-native plant (weed) occurrences in the Southwest.  The regional database provides a view of what is known about the 
occurrences of weed infestations across administrative boundaries.  It can be used to guide the development of local, such as agency or 
Cooperative Weed Management Area (CWMA), weed management strategies and regional, such as state or ecoregional, policies.  The 
database is available at the affiliated web site, Southwest Exotic Plant Information Clearinghouse (SWEPIC), along with computer tools that 
support data entry into the SWEMP database, visualization of the data, and query of the database by several criteria.  The computer tools 
provide CWMAs in the Southwest the means to share invasive plant data with all member partners.  Individual members of CWMAs can use 
the data query tool to download invasive plant information across the entirety of the CWMA.  'Maplets' of weed infestations in areas of interest 
can be designed and printed from the interactive map.  Example distribution maps are provided showing the documented occurrences of 
invasive non-native forbs and grasses in Arizona.

Knowing the condition of natural resources in national parks is fundamental to the National Park Service’s ability to manage park resources 
and a central goal of the NPS Inventory and Monitoring Program.  The 35 national parks and monuments on the Colorado Plateau are 
organized into two inventory and monitoring programs, the Northern and Southern Colorado Plateau Network, respectively.  Each network has 
its own staff and funding to design and implement a long-term monitoring program.  The unique ecological context of the Colorado Plateau 
and a long history of shared natural resource efforts among the NPS units in this area prompted the two networks to collaborate in developing 
monitoring programs.  We worked with several investigators to develop conceptual models of predominant Colorado Plateau ecosystems.  
Using independent selection approaches, the two networks reached similar conclusions in determining the most important ecosystem 
attributes to monitor across Colorado Plateau parks.  Shared monitoring themes include climate, streams and springs, upland soils and 
vegetation, bird communities, invasive plants, and landscape patterns relating to land use, disturbance patterns, and vegetation cover and 
condition.  We are currently collaborating with several teams of investigators in conducting pilot studies to support the development of detailed 
monitoring protocols.  These research and development efforts span both networks and include: testing of methods to monitor upland soils, 
vegetation, and hydrologic function in selected ecological sites; determining sample allocation and sample selection methods for monitoring 
riparian and aquatic habitats and associated testing of methods to monitor riparian vegetation; collecting a time series of ground-based data 
on vegetation greenness and comparing it with satellite (MODIS) data;  and determining remotely sensed data sets, image classification 
techniques, and change detection methods that can be effectively applied across the region to describe and monitor landscape patterns.

This research is motivated by concerns about how climate change is affecting Indigenous communities across the globe.  Many residents of 
the Navajo Nation on the southern Colorado Plateau are concerned that the future climate of the region will be warmer and drier than 
observed in the 20th Century.  Droughts during the late 1980s through 2004 over this region have resulted in the decrease of many native 
plant species and an increase in sand dune mobility causing social harm, including damage to infrastructure and the loss of agricultural 
productivity.  Effectively mitigating sand dune mobility requires understanding the annual and seasonal climate variability, which can affect 
sand dune development.  A climatic sand dune mobility index using wind energy and effective precipitation was calculated to assess seasonal, 
annual, and decadal trends of potential sand dune mobility over the Coalmine Mesa chapter area on the Navajo Nation from 1980 to 2004.  
The results demonstrated a large variation in seasonal and annual potential sand dune mobility.  For the period from 1980 to 2004, an 
increasing trend in potential sand dune mobility was observed and appears correlated with a trend of decreasing effective precipitation.  These 
results have provided a better understanding of the climatic conditions over the last 25 years over the Coalmine Mesa chapter area, and show 
how these conditions relate to increased sand dune mobility.  This work shows that the index can be used for other areas on the Navajo 
Nation, to identify locations at risk and help in planning efforts to mitigate effects from climate change.

This study explored the motivations to recreate with off-highway vehicles and the perceptions that off-highway riders and Forest Service 
managers have regarding management strategies and policies for off-highway vehicle recreation.  Data was gathered using a mail survey.  
Two populations were sampled: off-highway vehicle riders who recreate in northern Arizona and Forest Service managers working on national 
forests in northern Arizona.  Results show that motivations for off-highway vehicle recreation include escaping personal/social pressure, 
enjoying nature, achievement/stimulation, and to be with family and friends.  Managers and riders showed some agreement on off-highway 
vehicle management strategies such as interaction among riders and managers, developing volunteer programs, and holding workshops to 
inform the public of off-highway vehicle issues.  Data on perceptions of proposed off-highway vehicle management policies indicate that riders 
and managers differ on the possible implications of the proposed policies, including increased arbitrary trail closure, increased creation of 
social trails, increased trail removal, and increased cross-country travel by off-highway vehicles.  Results of the manager survey indicate some 
managers feel the proposed policy changes may minimize resource damage, decrease cross-country travel, and increase access to off-
highway vehicle trails.  These results suggest both off-highway vehicle riders and off-highway vehicle managers agree interaction and 
cooperation between the two groups are effective management strategies.  Results also suggest that differences in perceptions regarding 
proposed policy changes might require increased education and interaction between the two groups.

CAVE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT - NOW IS THE TIME TO STANDARDIZE 
 
TROUT, JERRY

Government agencies and caving groups alike have spent countless hours on cave(ing) and karst related documents, from permits, permit 
issuing regulations, mapping and survey standards, research standards, exploration techniques, conservation issues, and cave gating 
standards, to inventory standards.   We are closer now than ever to handling cave and karst resources in similar fashion.   It is timely to set 
some firm dates and assign the completion process and outcome to individuals, groups, or lead agencies.  We will explore some of the history 
of these documents, what is out there now, and how we might best orchestrate the completion of several of what we decide are the most 
pressing documents.   If we can accomplish this in the near future, we can most certainly improve the communication network regarding cave 
and karst resources, and the ability to interchange information needed to better manage and protect this precious resource. 
 
 
RESTORING ROADS WITH FUNGI: EVALUATING THE USE OF FUNGAL INOCULUM AND WOOD MULCH APPLICATION IN AN 
ARIZONA PONDEROSA PINE FOREST 
 
TRUDEAU, JOSEPH M. 
Ecological Restoration Institute, P.O. Box 15017, Flagstaff, AZ 86011-5017, jmt82@dana.ucc.nau.edu  
 
Road closure is an important component of ecological restoration projects across many landscapes.  Ecological restoration projects in 
southwestern ponderosa pine forests require the construction of temporary roads and log landings which cause soil compaction, hydrologic 
regime change and other damage.  Residual logging debris is left on site to be burned in slash piles that have been shown to have harmful 
effects on forest soils.  Holistic restoration projects should seek to eliminate the damage caused by roads and slash pile burning, and to close 
and restore established roads.  The purposes of this study are to investigate the effects of using ground waste-wood (mulch) and fungal 
inoculum on plant establishment, and to evaluate the use of saprophytic fungi to accelerate decomposition of organic material.  I selected 
three roads at Northern Arizona University's Centennial Forest near Flagstaff, Arizona.  Each road was divided into five experimental blocks 
containing identical treatments.  Treatments are 1)control, 2)mycorrhizal inoculum, 3)mulch, saprophytic fungi (Hypholoma capnoides), and 
mycorrhizal inoculum, and 4)mulch only.  All plots were seeded with a mix of native grass and forb seeds.  Data were collected in September 
2004, two months after treatment.  Initial results indicate that mycorrhizal inoculation had an insignificant effect (ANOVA P =0.481) on 
establishment of seedlings, mulched plots have significantly less (ANOVA P<0.001) plant establishment, mulch has been successfully 
colonized by the saprophyte, and competition exists between the saprophyte and existing soil fungi.  The short time between application of the 
treatments and data collection may explain the insignificant increase in establishment, and future benefits are anticipated as the mycorrhizae 
become established.  One-year measurements will be collected in September 2005 and will shed more light onto the effectiveness of mulch 
and fungal inoculum for restoring forest roads. 
 
 
PROJECT FRAME (FRAMING RESEARCH FOR ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT OF ECOSYSTEMS):  USING COLLABORATIVE MODELING 
APPROACHES TO LINK SCIENCE TO RESOURCE MANAGEMENT NEEDS

Today’s federal land managers are challenged to use science to manage multiple resources under intense public scrutiny.  The goal for 
resource managers is to optimize the management of multiple resources while minimizing negatives impacts of any given decision.  Each 
decision is also made with the recognition that conditions change, which requires adaptive management approaches.  Through Project 
FRAME (Framing Research for Adaptive Management of Ecosystems), the USGS and its partners are addressing these challenges.  Our 
strategy is to couple collaborative problem-solving approaches with physical modeling tools.  The modeling framework is the USGS Modular 
Modeling System (MMS), which is an ideal framework to support the collaborative integration of a broad range of models and tools from a 
wide range of scientific disciplines. The MMS approach is adaptive and can accommodate many types of science information by linking them 
in an integrated system.  Developing this collaborative modeling approach for natural resource management requires a multi-year effort; 
however, through an initial focus on pinyon-juniper (PJ) management at Mesa Verde National Park and surrounding lands, we are making 
significant strides.  PJ management involves a number of cross-cutting management issues, such as grazing, OHV use, soil erosion, 
ecosystem restoration, fire management, urban/wildland interface, woodcutting, invasive species, coal-bed methane development, and 
recreational tourism.  Our approach to linking science information to resource management needs is to adhere to established principles of 
collaboration by continuously engaging the appropriate people (resource managers, modelers, PJ scientists) in a series of workshops.  We 
have collaboratively framed the science questions embedded in PJ resource management and are collaboratively modeling the appropriate 
science for PJ ecosystem management.  Collaboration goes beyond consultation or “input”—all parties learn from each other in the process.  
Collaborative identification of issues and science requirements for modeling helps overcome the common pitfalls of many efforts to link 
science to resource management needs, primarily by maintaining a focus on the decision context to ensure that the scientific information is 
useful for resource managers.  In essence, we use modeling as a mechanism for collaboration.  We are on our way to establishing a 
transportable collaborative modeling approach for adaptive management of ecosystems.

Ecological restoration treatments are planned throughout southwestern fire-adapted forest ecosystems.  This has created a growing need for 
site-specific prescriptions adapted to local ecological and social conditions. The Ecological Restoration Institute in collaboration with the 
Wahoo Watershed Workgroup, a community based forestry organization, has initiated a series of small ecological restoration treatments within 
forested ecosystems in the Black Range District of the Gila National Forest, NM. The goals of these projects are to: 1) assess ecological 
conditions within restoration treatment areas; 2) develop site-specific treatment prescriptions using assessment data, expert opinion and 
existing research; and 3) monitor important ecological changes induced by ecological restoration treatments. Workgroup members initially 
identified the ponderosa pine/Gambel oak ecosystem type for restoration treatment due to its prevalence and degree of degradation within the 
approved project area. Ecological assessment and monitoring methods included fire scar sampling, measurement of a 10-acre forest structure 
macroplot, and the installation and measurement of six 0.1-acre monitoring plots per treatment unit.  Monitoring plots were installed to assess 
changes in understory, shrub, and overstory vegetation and forest floor fuels before and after treatment.  Four treatment options (two levels of 
restoration-based thinning with prescribed burn, prescribed burn only and control) were developed by the Workgroup after the initial 
assessment.  Thinning within treatment areas was completed during summer 2005 and a prescribed burn is scheduled for spring 2006. This 
monitoring design, although limited statistically by pseudo-replication, is logistically simple to establish and will be relatively simple to manage 
and maintain.  Treatment units situated in highly visible areas provide site-specific data demonstrating restoration treatments to the public. 
Most importantly this project has served as a pilot study, informing ongoing and future efforts in the local area.

The Inventory and Monitoring Program of the National Park Service (NPS) has undertaken the development of conceptual models of key 
ecosystems as a foundational step toward developing long-term monitoring of park natural resources.  Models depicting primary structural 
components, system drivers, and their interactions help us understand the processes that affect the ecological integrity of these resources and 
thereby help focus monitoring efforts.  Conceptual models also are useful for summarizing knowledge, identifying areas in need of additional 
research, and providing insight into ecosystem management.  Our models focus on disturbance and were developed to support long-term 
monitoring of montane terrestrial ecosystems within NPS units on the Colorado Plateau.  The models also apply to non-NPS wilderness areas 
and provide useful background for public and private lands where logging, grazing, etc. are permitted.  Our conceptual models link important 
biological components such as vegetation-fuels with interactive controls such as disturbance, state factors such as climate-weather, and 
anthropogenic stressors such as exotic species.  We developed a nested suite of three models for each ecosystem.  “Ecosystem 
characterization models” provide a broad framework for information on the ecosystem, including major subsystems, components, and 
interactions.  “Ecosystem dynamic models” focus on the dynamics of those disturbance-related ecosystem components and interactions that 
historically controlled the ecosystem.  These models use a state-and-transition format and include communities within different states and 
identify processes that form the communities.  “Ecosystem mechanistic models” summarize details on processes responsible for patterns 
depicted in ecosystem dynamics models.  We illustrate our approach by presenting models for Pinyon-Juniper and Ponderosa Pine 
Ecosystems.  We identify research needs and discuss applications to management and long-term monitoring.  In general, the role of 
disturbance is poorly known for the Pinyon-Juniper Ecosystem of the Colorado Plateau; therefore, additional research is needed and this 
research will aid in the development of ecologically appropriate management practices.  The role of disturbance is much better known for the 
Ponderosa Pine Forest Ecosystem; nevertheless, additional research is needed and this research will help refine management practices.

Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) have been transplanted throughout Arizona, primarily following evaluation of potential habitat using 
systematic evaluation criteria that allows managers to rank and prioritize habitats according to perceived suitability.  Many appraisals have 
been conducted to determine how well a variety of systematic habitat evaluations function in predicting bighorn sheep habitat use and many 
provide functional expectations.  Recently, mountain lion (Puma concolor) predation on transplanted bighorn sheep has been suggested to be 
indicative of increasing mountain lion populations.  An alternate hypothesis that was not explored was that more recent bighorn sheep 
transplants occurred in lower quality habitat, which may incidentally affect predation rate by mountain lions.  I use annual survival and cause-
specific mortality estimates for the first year following release in several Arizona bighorn sheep transplants to examine correlations with a priori 
habitat evaluation scores.

Chemical renovation of Fossil Creek, central Arizona, was conducted in autumn 2004 to remove exotic smallmouth bass and green sunfish, 
and restore a native fish community consisting of roundtail and headwater chub, speckled and longfin dace and Sonora and desert sucker. 
Complex habitat conditions related to travertine dams, deep pools, and multiple channels complicated renovation. Breakdown of antimycin A 
by high pH and dissolved CO2, CaCO3, and iron required multiple pre-treatment bioassays. Native fishes were salvaged, transported nearby, 
held in captivity prior to treatment and repatriated after detoxification. Depending on local water quality, antimycin A (Fintrol®) was applied at 
concentrations of 50-100 ppb over 4-6 hours using drip buckets spaced approximately 150 m apart.  Backpack sprayers applied Fintrol® in 
peripheral habitats, while antimycin-coated sand grains (Fintrol-15®) were added to deep pools. Antimycin A was applied twice in rapid 
succession to ensure complete mortality. Over 380 L of Fintrol® toxicant and 187 kg of Fintrol-15® sand was applied to about 16 km of 
stream.  Liquid sodium permanganate was applied at 3 ppm near a constructed barrier to detoxify the antimycin A. Extensive aquatic habitat 
mapping, logistical planning and innovative application techniques contributed to this successful native fish restoration project. 
 
 
RESTORATION OF SOUTHWESTERN PONDEROSA PINE FORESTS: IMPLICATIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR WILDLIFE

 After a century of fire suppression, livestock grazing, and even-aged timber harvesting, forest managers in the Southwest face an enormous 
challenge. Millions of acres of ponderosa pine forest are extremely susceptible to uncharacteristic, high intensity wildfires, the consequences 
of which were amply demonstrated by recent mega-fires in Arizona and New Mexico.  Current condition ponderosa pine forests are also 
atypically homogeneous in structure and composition, which results in reduced habitat biodiversity for wildlife.  In response, land managers 
have begun planning and implementing extensive forest treatment projects along urban interfaces and in wildland areas.  Although many of 
these projects are designed primarily to reduce the risk of high intensity wildfire, these treatments have considerable potential to improve 
wildlife habitat by creating diversity at the stand and landscape level and increasing productivity in shrub and understory layers. There is 
widespread agreement that restoration of Southwestern forests is needed, however, the location, scale, and approach of treatment 
prescriptions remain controversial, especially when addressing wildlife needs. We present a conceptual overview of wildlife responses to 
treatment-induced changes in ponderosa pine forest structure and summarize results from ongoing studies on the Mt. Trumbull restoration 
area in northern Arizona and the wildland-urban interface near Flagstaff.

Population growth on the Colorado Plateau has more than doubled since the mid-1960s but allocated water supplies to support this growth 
have remained relatively constant. Consequently, many municipalities in the region have implemented water conservation plans to insure 
adequate water supplies for future development. Included in these plans have been restrictions on either the volume of water that can be used 
for irrigating existing landscapes or on the type or quantity of plant species that can be included in new landscapes. Incentives to replace 
existing high water-use landscapes (ie. turfgrass) with drought-tolerant landscapes consisting of native species have also been offered. 
Changing landscape type, however, does not necessarily result in water savings if irrigation strategies are not adjusted to accommodate the 
change. To accomplish this, the homeowner or landscape manager must be familiar with the specific water requirements of each replacement 
species.  To exhibit and evaluate the water requirements of drought-tolerant native plant species that may be appropriate for Colorado Plateau 
landscapes, a xeric plant demonstration/research garden was established at New Mexico State University’s Agricultural Science Center (ASC) 
at Farmington, NM during 2002. The ASC is located in the center of the Plateau at an elevation of 1700 meters and receives an average 
annual precipitation of 208 mm. Approximately 100 plant species, most of which are native to the Plateau, are exhibited in the garden at four 
different irrigation levels (0, 20, 40, and 60% of climate-based reference evapotranspiration [ET]). While many species have survived and 
exhibited acceptable quality with little to no supplemental irrigation, nearly all species have thrived at irrigation levels ranging from 20 to 40% 
of reference ET (10 to 20 L/ plant/week during summer).  This presentation explains techniques for scheduling micro-irrigations on native-
plants using climate data and plant canopy area. Additionally, it provides irrigation and species recommendations for water-conserving 
landscapes on the Plateau. Through implementation of these techniques and recommendations, more water will be available for other 
beneficial uses, including maintenance of in-stream flows and aquifer recharge, on the Colorado Plateau.

Spotted and diffuse knapweeds (Centaurea biebersteinii and C. diffusa) are considered by many to be invasive and are listed by 14 states and 
4 Canadian provinces as noxious weeds.  First documented in the Flagstaff area in 1979, diffuse knapweed now lines many county roads and 
state highways.  Although less common in the region, spotted knapweed was documented in northern Arizona as early as 1983.  Both species 
have a number of attributes that make them successful invaders. Diffuse knapweed can germinate under varying environmental conditions 
and its seedlings can survive extremes of temperature and soil moisture.  We documented germination of diffuse knapweed as early as April 
in contained seed packets at an elevation of 2,560 m, and seedlings in our pot study survived extreme drought conditions that killed most 
native plants.  Spotted knapweed seeds remain viable in the seedbank for at least eight years.  Knapweeds are highly competitive under 
varying resource conditions and are allelopathic. Studies indicate only minimal, if any, grazing by wildlife and livestock once plants reach 
maturity.  Although both spotted and diffuse knapweeds are currently limited mostly to high disturbance areas in this region, the concern is that 
they will expand into forest edges and eventually interior forests.  We are also presently investigating dispersal rates into upland ponderosa 
pine forest and via storm water runoff.  Severe fire could advance knapweed spread to these areas.  Our research indicates that conditions 
created by either high severity wildfires or slash pile burns enhance germination of diffuse knapweed seeds compared to unburned sites.  
What steps can be taken to curtail the spread of these two invaders?  Currently, governmental agencies and local organizations use various 
control treatments on both species.  Unfortunately, diffuse knapweed populations are so extensive and well established that curtailment within 
Flagstaff will require large expenditures.  Forest managers, home owners, and business owners both here and in other parts of the Colorado 
Plateau can do their part by treating populations of these species when they are small and relatively easy to contain. 
 
 
RETURNING NATURAL FLOW INTO THE OXBOW:  RESTORATION OF A 40 YEAR-OLD DIVERSION IN CAPITOL REEF NATIONAL 
PARK, UTAH

During the 1961-62 construction of Utah State Highway 24 in south-central Utah, a portion of the Fremont River was rerouted.  Rather than 
constructing the highway along a mile-long meander in the river or building bridges over the river to allow water to flow along its natural 
course, a 0.16-mile cut was excavated through an area of sandstone cliff and the road was routed through it.  As part of road construction, a 
new river channel was constructed parallel to the road, which diverted the river from its natural course and cut off the meander of the river (the 
oxbow).  This river diversion also created a man-made waterfall as the mile-long drop in stream elevation is now accomplished in less than 
300 yards.  At the time of river diversion, this area was outside the boundaries of Capitol Reef, but was subsequently encompassed by a 1969 
expansion.  Removal of flow from the oxbow extirpated a federally listed orchid, and the waterfall has created a hazard resulting in over 15 
documented visitor injuries.  In cooperation with the Utah Department of Transportation, the park proposes to return the river into its natural 
channel through the construction of two bridges on Highway 24.  The proposed project would fill the man-made diversion channel that was 
constructed in 1962, which would eliminate the public safety hazard created by the waterfall at the end of the diversion channel.  In addition, 
this proposal would re-establish the natural hydrology and stream corridor of the Fremont River through a 0.9 mile section and re-establish 16 
acres of wetland habitat. 
 
 
INFLUENCE OF GLEN CANYON DAM OPERATIONS ON DOWNSTREAM SAND RESOURCES OF THE COLORADO RIVER IN GRAND 
CANYON  
 
WRIGHT, SCOTT, Ted Melis, David Topping, Rubin 
 
The U.S. Geological Survey’s (USGS) Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center and its cooperators have conducted extensive 
monitoring and research on fine-sediment transport and sandbar evolution in Grand Canyon. This talk presents a summary of the results of 
studies since the 1970s, as well as conclusions derived from recent syntheses of streamflow, sediment transport, and geomorphic data from 
1921 to 2004, including recent sediment budgets. The effects of the MLFF operating alternative at Glen Canyon Dam (1996–2004) on fine-
sediment transport and sandbars are examined in the context of these historical data. Finally, options identified by sediment scientists for 
testing alternative operations aimed at more effective conservation of fine-sediment resources are discussed.

There is little ecological information on caves of the Arizona Strip.  The few cave-related studies in the region represent opportunistic collecting 
of invertebrates and some limited bat inventories.  This region presents great opportunities for increasing the body of knowledge concerning 
the discovery of new species, as well as increasing the body of knowledge concerning Arizona cave ecology.  Additionally, information 
concerning cave use by bats will be an important contribution to better understanding bats of northwestern Arizona.  We will present 
information on previous cave research, and provide results of 2005 surveys where we either inventoried or conducted site visits to 30 caves on 
BLM lands and Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument.  During our inventories, we trapped invertebrates in all light zones, captured 

 
89 
and released bats and noted all wildlife activity.  To date, we have tentatively identified at least five caves as either ecologically sensitive or as 
containing significant ecological resources.

Spatially explicit predictive models are an important tool for understanding wildlife-habitat relationships and guiding natural resource 
management decisions.  For predictive models to be a useful tool in the decision making process, they must be accurate, general, and easy to 
apply.  Gap analysis involves developing and relating wildlife habitat relationship models to regional land stewardship; through this process, 
the results of a gap analysis may be used to delineate areas identified as containing high species richness.  Using the recently completely 
SWReGAP analysis data, we will examine the relationship between species richness indices and land stewardship on the Colorado Plateau.  
In so doing, we will delimit areas considered ecological “hotspots,” relate these areas to conservation-oriented land stewardship and discuss 
how well the two intersect.

Genetic diversity is the raw material for evolutionary processes and its understanding provides important information for forest conservation 
and restoration. The association between environmental heterogeneity and genetic diversity has been widely studied. However, little is known 
regarding genetic variation in forest canopy and understory species within the same community and how they may be related. We 
hypothesized there would be a correlation between genetic variation in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus 
elymoides), an understory species found in ponderosa pine forests in northern Arizona. We examined the genetic relationships using 
measures of genetic and geographic distance, and climatic conditions. Allozyme data show these two species exhibit different genetic 
structures, which is likely due to the fact they have different life histories and mating systems. Ponderosa pine exhibits relatively high genetic 
variation within populations and low variation among populations, while bottlebrush squirreltail shows low genetic variation within populations 
and high variation among populations. This difference may be due to relatively low gene flow between populations of bottlebrush squirreltail 
compared to ponderosa pine. These two species also show different relationships between geographic distance and climatic conditions. There 
is a positive correlation between genetic variation of ponderosa pine and geographic distance, but no correlation between genetic variation 
and climatic conditions. In contrast, genetic variation of bottlebrush squirreltail is significantly correlated with climatic conditions, but has no 
correlation with geographic distance. Based on these findings, we will make recommendations for seed transfer and conservation of 
ponderosa pine and bottlebrush squirreltail.
