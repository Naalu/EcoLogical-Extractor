Abstract
Soil seed banks are important to vegetation recruit-
ment, ecosystem functioning and land management.
We evaluated composition of 0–5 cm soil seed banks
and relationships of seed banks with forest community
types (ranging from low-elevation pinyon–juniper to
high-elevation bristlecone pine), vegetation cover and
environmental variables within a 40,000-ha relatively
undisturbed coniferous forest landscape in Nevada,
USA. We collected samples from 36 sites and used the
emergence method to assay seed banks. Seed
density averaged 479 seeds m22 across sites and a
total of 39 taxa were detected. Most (79%) of these
taxa were perennials and 35 of 39 (90%) were native.
Moreover, 62% of seed-bank taxa were in the
vegetation of mature forests, an uncommon ﬁnding in
studies of forest soil seed banks. Seed-bank density,
species richness and composition did not display
strong relationships with forest community types,
vegetation cover or environmental variables. Weak
relationships likely arose from the relatively uniform
seed-bank density among sites, where 50% of sites
had seed densities in the range of 106–282 m22.
Results suggest that while seed banks on this
landscape are not large, they provide recruitment
potential for some native perennial species of mature,
relatively undisturbed communities.

Introduction
Viable seeds stored in soil – soil seed banks – are
important features of plant communities that can
inﬂuence plant recruitment and dynamics (Warr et al.,
1993). A key principle regarding forest communities is
that seed banks typically contain few seeds of species
inhabiting mature forests (Warr et al., 1994; Bossuyt
and Hermy, 2001). Rather, forest seed banks are
normally dominated by early successional species,
often short lived (e.g. annual) and ‘ruderal’ (weedy)
species with abilities to colonize disturbed areas
rapidly (Grime, 2001). When disturbance reduces the
tree overstorey, these species recruit, produce seed to
replenish seed banks, and then often become sparse or
absent as forest cover re-establishes (Roberts and
Vankat, 1991). On the other hand, species of the mature
forest often do not rely on soil seed banks. Instead,
these species are usually long lived and regenerate via
short-lived seed, rendering persistent seed banks of
minimal importance to their population dynamics
(Chambers et al., 1999). As a result, seed banks of
mature forests are generally dominated by species
other than those of the extant mature vegetation
(Halpern et al., 1999; Bossuyt and Hermy, 2001).
There are exceptions, however, to the principle that
forest seed banks do not contain species of mature
communities. For example, Leckie et al. (2000) found
that 76% of taxa in the seed bank occurred in
vegetation of an old (.400 years), temperate decid-
uous forest in Quebec, Canada. Similarly, high
congruence between seed bank and vegetation taxa
was reported for some European forests (Brown
and Oosterhuis, 1981; Jankowska-Blaszczuk and
Grubb, 1997; Olano et al., 2002; Wo´dkiewicz and
Kwiatkowska-Falin´ska, 2010). Additional research
might help illuminate how common this exception is
and what types of forests do contain seed banks that
harbour species of mature vegetation.
Another potentially important, but poorly under-
stood, aspect of soil seed banks is spatial variation
within landscapes. Some studies suggest that seed-
bank density and species composition can vary
substantially
among
sites
within
landscapes
(Thompson, 1978; Ortega et al., 1997; Ashton et al.,
1998). This variation might be linked to the presence of
different forest community types and correlated with

variation in environment (e.g. elevation and soil
texture) and vegetation variables (e.g. tree canopy
cover) (Thompson, 1978; Ortega et al., 1997; Cummins
and Miller, 2002). Topographic gradients could affect
seed banks by inﬂuencing the vegetation that provides
inputs to seed banks and by affecting seed retention
through soil deposition, erosion, decomposition or
wind (Ashton et al., 1998). Soil texture can inﬂuence
seed bank formation by affecting vegetation and
trapping different-sized seeds (Chambers, 1995;
Benvenuti, 2007). While past vegetation inﬂuences
seed-bank formation by providing seeds that persist in
the soil, current vegetation also provides inputs and
inﬂuences seed banks through other mechanisms. In
forests, tree canopy cover can affect seed banks
through inﬂuences on understorey vegetation and
other properties (Abella et al., 2007; Allen et al., 2008).
There are many practical purposes to understand-
ing soil seed banks for environmental management,
including evaluating plant recruitment potential and
exotic species abundance (Bakker et al., 1996).
Coniferous forests of western North America, for
example, are under active ecological restoration, which
beneﬁts from knowledge of seed banks. Beginning in
the late 1800s and early 1900s, Euro-American
settlement brought new land-use practices to the
region,
including
intentional
ﬁre
suppression
(Covington and Moore, 1994). During this time period
and through the 1900s, tree density and fuel loads
sharply increased, concomitant with the size and
severity of wildﬁres. Many western coniferous forests,
such as those containing Pinus ponderosa and dry mixed
conifers, formerly sustained frequent, low-severity ﬁre
and not the extensive crown ﬁres occurring today
(Covington and Moore, 1994). Consequently, mechan-
ical thinning of trees is a major ecological restoration
treatment currently being performed for re-balancing
ecosystem biomass to reduce canopy fuels and
promote understorey vegetation (Graham et al., 2010).
Understanding soil seed banks could facilitate
assessing recruitment potential of plant species, includ-
ing those of mature forest communities and exotic
species, following forest management. The objective of
this study was to determine soil seed-bank composition
on a western North American coniferous forest land-
scape and relationships to forest community types,
vegetation cover and environmental variables.
Materials and methods
Study area
We collected samples within a 40,000-ha area on the
east side of the Spring Mountains, within Spring
Mountains National Recreation Area of the Humboldt-
Toiyabe National Forest in southern Nevada, USA
(Fig. 1). The 5500-km2 Spring Mountains rise to 3632 m
above sea level (Charleston Peak) over surrounding
desert shrubland 750 m in elevation in the northern
Mojave Desert (Niles and Leary, 2007). Along an
elevational gradient from low to high, predominant
forest
types
include
pinyon–juniper
(Pinus
monophylla–Juniperus osteosperma), pinyon, ponderosa
pine (Pinus ponderosa), mixed conifer (several conifers
such as P. ponderosa, Abies concolor and Pinus ﬂexilis)
and bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva). The climate in
2009–2010 at a pinyon site (Lovell Summit, 2010 m
elevation) included the following averages: 51 cm yr21
of precipitation, 238C January daily low temperature
and 318C July daily high temperature (NWCC, 2011).
At a higher elevation of 2738 m at a mixed conifer site
(Bristlecone Trail), the following averages were
reported from an available record in 2009–2010:
70 cm yr21 of precipitation, January daily low tem-
perature of 258C and July daily high temperature of
238C. Most precipitation falls in non-summer months,
with summer storms from May through August
delivering a 2009–2010 average of 9% of total annual
precipitation at the pinyon site and 11% at the mixed
conifer site. Topography consists of hillslopes dis-
sected by drainages, large canyons between major
slopes, and ridges and other convex landforms. Soils
are derived from limestone, dolomite and sandstone
and include Mollisols, Inceptisols, Aridisols and
Alﬁsols (Lato, 2006). Selective harvest of some timber
(primarily P. ponderosa) and fuel for charcoal kilns
(primarily of pinyon–juniper forest) was concentrated
from the mid-1800s to early 1900s, but less harvest has
occurred since. Some localized livestock grazing also
occurred but is not presently authorized. Major large
native herbivores inhabiting the area include mule
deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and bighorn sheep (Ovis
canadensis). Based on tree coring at study sites, the
oldest trees were a minimum of 150 years old and ages
of some trees exceeded 400 years (Abella et al., 2012).
At the highest elevations, P. longaeva trees of the
bristlecone forest type are among the oldest individual
plants on Earth, with life spans of several thousand
years (Thorne et al., 2007). Thus, our sample sites are
old, mature forests typical of this landscape.
Sample and data collection
As a framework for data collection, we used a network
of Terrestrial Ecological Unit Inventory (TEUI) sites
established by the US Forest Service to characterize
variability in environmental gradients and vegetation
across the landscape (Winthers et al., 2005). These sites
were established in the centres of mapping units
deﬁned by soil scientists on the basis of similarity in
climate, soil parent material and vegetation. We
collected samples from 36 of 42 TEUI sites (four were
not visited due to logistics and two were burned by
wildﬁre) in pinyon–juniper or higher forests on the
S.R. Abella and J.D. Springer

east side of the mountain range, for which complete soil
proﬁle descriptions and vegetation inventories were
available. With much of the study area roadless and in
designated wilderness (prohibiting mechanized equip-
ment), human disturbance at the 36 sites over the past
50–100 years is not extensive. Sample sites encom-
passed broad environmental and vegetation gradients
across the landscape, ranging in elevation from 2146 to
3292 m, forest type from pinyon–juniper to bristlecone
pine, and slope gradient from 8 to 64% (Table 1).
We collected seed-bank samples, soil samples and
other environmental data at each site from 3 May to 29
May 2009. This was early spring, during or shortly after
snowmelt, and thus seed-bank collections represent
accumulated seeds and seeds from the previous
growing season that persisted through the winter and
would be available for germination. We chose this
sampling time to occur before current-year seed
dispersal (Baskin and Baskin, 1998), which can be
both in early summer for early ﬂowering species and in
late summer post-monsoon (Niles and Leary, 2007).
One TEUI plot, 20 m £ 20 m (0.04 ha) in size, had been
established at each site. We collected seed-bank
samples at 15 locations within each plot, with one
sample collected every 4 m along the bottom and top
plot boundaries and the centreline parallel to these
boundaries. We collected samples of the 0–5 cm soil
layer, which included mineral soil and could include
the duff layer (Oe þ a horizon), if present, but not litter
(Oi horizon), which we brushed away if present.
Samples of 200 cm3 each were collected using a
cylinder 7 cm in diameter and were thoroughly mixed
to result in a total of 3000 cm3 per plot of seed-bank soil.
We collected 0–5 cm mineral soil samples for labora-
tory analysis using the same methods, and we collected
0–5 cm mineral soil for bulk density analysis from four
cores, with one collected from each plot corner.
At the centre of each plot, we recorded location [in
Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) m, North
American Datum 1983] and elevation using a Global
Positioning System, aspect [linearized to range from
0–2 following Beers et al. (1966)] using a compass, and
slope gradient and landform index using a clinometer.

where low values indicate exposed convex landforms
and high values indicate high protection, and was
based on the average of eight measurements every 458
to the horizons of surrounding landforms (McNab,
1993). From the location, aspect and slope gradient
data, we calculated potential direct incident radiation
and heat load, following McCune (2007).
Soil samples were air dried, sieved through a 2-mm
sieve and analysed for texture (hydrometer method)
following Tan (2005); pH and electrical conductivity
(1:1 soil:water); available P (Olsen sodium bicarbonate
extraction); CaCO3 (manometer method); total C, N
and S (dry combustion, CNS analyser); organic C
(difference between total and inorganic C); NO3, SO4
and Cl (ion chromatography); and the water-soluble
concentrations of Na, K, Mg, Ca, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn,
Co, B, Mo, Pb and Cd (1:3 soil:water extracts,
inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy)
following Burt (2004). Bulk density was estimated for
the bulk density samples by sieving through a 2-mm
sieve, oven drying the ,2-mm fraction at 1058C for
24 h, and including volume of coarse fragments .2 mm
in the total soil volume. Bulk density was used to
convert nutrient concentrations to volumetric contents
(Burt, 2004).
We obtained soil characterization and vegetation
data sets for each TEUI plot from the US Forest Service
(Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest, Las Vegas,
Nevada, USA). Based on a soil pit described by soil
scientists using standard procedures (Soil Survey
Division Staff, 1993), we obtained data on A- and
B-horizon thickness, pH and texture; and on depth to a
root-restricting layer (e.g. bedrock or an indurated
horizon). We obtained data on areal cover of each
understorey vascular plant species rooted in each plot
and canopy cover of overstorey trees (.5 m in height)
in total and by species (Abella et al., 2012). Vegetation
data were collected in summer 2004 to 2006 and thus
represent vegetation before seed-bank sampling.
Seed-bank processing
Seed-bank samples were processed within a week of
ﬁnishing sample collection by placing eight sub-
samples each of 177 cm3 (translating to a 2-cm thick
layer) of seed-bank soil per site in separate 4-litre
cylindrical pots. Pots were ﬁlled two-thirds full with
sterile potting soil (United Industries Co., St. Louis,
Missouri, USA), and the seed-bank soil was placed on
top of the potting soil. Pots were randomly arranged
on a bench in a greenhouse and were kept moist by
daily watering. The start of the emergence period
(June) corresponded to the natural photoperiod for
germination, so no supplemental lighting was pro-
vided in the greenhouse. Seedlings were counted and
pulled every 2 weeks when identiﬁed to the ﬁnest
taxonomic level possible using local ﬂora descriptions
(Niles and Leary, 2007) as soon as plant parts required
for accurate identiﬁcation appeared. Of 488 total
seedlings emerging, 427 (88%) were identiﬁed to genus
or species, with the remainder identiﬁed only to
growth form (forb, graminoid or shrub). A forb
comprised 53 of 61 (87%) of the unidentiﬁed seedlings,
with the remainder being two unknown seedlings of a
fern and six of a graminoid. Unidentiﬁed seedlings
were included in total seed densities but not in species
richness or compositional data. Pots containing only
potting soil were established to check for greenhouse
seed contamination, which was not detected. Nomen-
clature, growth form and native/exotic status follow
the National Resources Conservation Service database
(NRCS, 2011).
Data analysis
We converted seedling counts from the eight sub-
samples per site into a single seeds m22 (0–5 cm depth)
estimate per site. Species richness, based on the

cumulative number of species in the 1416 cm3 volume
of the eight subsamples/site, was calculated for each
site. Sample volume was identical across all sites to be
compared, so we report richness as species/volume, as
is customary for seed-bank studies and analogous to
species/area in vegetation studies (Gotelli and Colwell,
2001). We compared median seed density and species
richness among forest types using Kruskal–Wallis tests
(SAS Institute, 2009). We further computed the
proportion of seed bank species at each plot that were
detected in vegetation of at least one plot.
We constructed a matrix of seed-bank measures
(density, richness and proportion of species in
vegetation), together with the 2 location (UTM x, y),
6 topographic (elevation, transformed aspect, slope
gradient, landform index, potential direct incident
radiation and heat load), 40 soil (our 0–5 cm soil lab
measures including bulk density and coarse fragment
content, and the TEUI A and B horizon thickness, pH, %
sand, silt, and clay, and depth to root restriction) and
8 tree variables (total tree canopy cover and canopy
cover of seven individual tree species). To derive a
smaller number of composite variables portraying
variability
within
the
environmental
data,
we
performed a principal components analysis (cross-
products matrix calculated from correlation) on the
location, topographic and soil variables using PC-ORD
(McCune and Mefford, 1999). We then calculated
Spearman correlation coefﬁcients between all seed
bank, environmental (including the ﬁrst three principal
components) and vegetation variables (SAS Institute,
2009).
To portray species composition, we calculated
species £ site matrices of relative seed density (speciesi
/sum all species) on a site basis and relative under-
storey plant cover. The seed bank matrix was weakly
structured and a signiﬁcant non-metric multidimen-
sional scaling ordination was not derived (P . 0.40 all
three axes, PC-ORD’s slow and thorough mode). Thus,
we used Bray–Curtis ordination (Sørensen distance,
variance–regression endpoint selection, and city-block
axis projection geometry and residual distances) for
both the seed bank and vegetation matrices in PC-ORD
(McCune and Mefford, 1999). We used joint plots to
identify relationships of the species and environmental
variables to gradients in community composition.
Results
Seed-bank characteristics
Native perennial taxa dominated the seed bank. A total
of 39 taxa emerged, consisting of 5 (13%) annual, 1 (3%)
annual-biennial, 2 (5%) biennial, 5 (13%) annual-
perennial, and 26 (67%) perennial taxa (Table 2).
Twenty-four (62%) of the 39 taxa were forbs, 5 (13%)
were graminoids, 9 (23%) were shrubs and 1 (3%) was a
cactus. The most frequent species, detected at .10% of
sites, were Conyza canadensis, Poa fendleriana, Arabis
fendleri, Gutierrezia sarothrae, Draba californica, Arabis
spp., Cercocarpus ledifolius and Lactuca serriola. Only four
exotic species emerged, with only one (L. serriola,
detected at four sites) emerging from more than one site.
Seed density among sites ranged from 71 to 3814
seeds m22, with 1518 seeds m22 being the second most
dense site, and richness from 1 to 9. Across all sites,
seed density averaged 479 (SD ¼ 662) and species
richness 4.3 species per site (SD ¼ 2.1). Half of the sites
exhibited densities in the range of 106–282 seeds m22.
Environment and vegetation relationships
The ﬁrst three principal components portrayed 42% of
the variation in the environmental data set, and many
different variables exhibited high loadings on com-
ponents. For example, coarse fragment content and
sand had the largest positive loadings and a suite of
soil nutrients (e.g. S, N and organic C) the largest
negative loadings on component 1 (21% of variance).
Component 2 (12% of variance) exhibited large
positive loadings of topographic variables (e.g. land-
form index and slope gradient) and large negative
loadings of several soil variables such as CaCO3.
Relationships of seed-bank measures with environ-
mental (including principal components) and vegeta-
tion variables were not strong. Considering seed-bank
density and richness and the proportion of seed-bank
species in the vegetation, no Spearman rho of these
measures with any environmental or vegetation
variable exceeded j0.42j. Soil silt was the environmen-
tal variable most strongly correlated with seed-bank
measures (Table 3). Similarly, median seed-bank
density (Kruskal–Wallis x2 statistic ¼ 5.61; P ¼ 0.231,
df ¼ 4) and species richness (x2 ¼ 3.68; P ¼ 0.451) did
not differ among forest types. Seed density ranges
overlapped and medians spanned 141–530 seeds m22
(Table 1). A pinyon forest site contained the highest
seed-bank density (3814 seeds m22) among sites, but
this forest type also contained sites exhibiting among
the lowest seed densities. The ordination further
suggested that seed-bank species composition showed
little tendency to group according to forest type, and no
environmental variables exhibited an r 2 value greater
than the 0.25 cutoff with either ordination axis (Fig. 2a).
This differed from vegetation species composition
aboveground, which grouped by low- and high-
elevation forest types (Fig. 2b).
Seed bank:vegetation relationship
A high proportion (62%) of taxa in the seed bank
occurred in aboveground vegetation (Table 2).

Congruence of seed bank and vegetation occurrence
was especially common (71%, 22 of 31 taxa) for native
perennial taxa or those capable of perennial life spans
(annual–perennial). Native perennial seed-bank taxa
also frequent aboveground included Poa fendleriana,
Arabis sp., Gutierrezia sarothrae, Cercocarpus ledifolius,
Elymus elymoides and Ribes cereum.
Considering the ten most frequent species above-
ground, ﬁve occurred in the seed bank. These species
were Poa fendleriana (the most frequent species in
vegetation, inhabiting 78% of sites), Hymenoxys cooperi
(44%), Ribes cereum (42%), Elymus elymoides (42%) and
Purshia stansburiana (28%). The ﬁve other species not
detected in the seed bank were conifer trees, including
Abies concolor (47%), Pinus monophylla (44%), Pinus
longaeva(31%)andJuniperusosteosperma(28%),inaddition
to the perennial grass Achnatherum hymenoides (28%).
Discussion
Representation of mature forest species
The seed bank was dominated by native perennial
species that also occurred in vegetation of these old
forests. This ﬁnding is uncommon but is consistent
with a limited number of other studies of forest seed
banks, such as Leckie et al. (2000) in a temperate
deciduous forest of Quebec, Canada, and Brown and
Oosterhuis (1981) in old coppice woods of eastern
England. Potential commonalities in factors related to
the high representation of mature forest species among
these studies and ours remain unresolved. However,
Leckie et al. (2000) hypothesized that a contributing
factor to high representation of mature forest species in
their study was that the forest had never been
harvested, as opposed to old secondary forests that
earlier had been harvested and disturbed by humans.
With the exception of selective logging of largely Pinus
ponderosa at some (though not all) sites, our study sites
can likely also be classiﬁed as primary forest. This lack
of past acute disturbance (e.g. clear cutting, clearing
for agriculture) might partly explain the observed
scarcity of ruderal species in seed banks.
There are some possibilities as to why species of
mature forests were well represented in the seed bank
in our study. For instance, while the forests are much
moister than the surrounding arid Mojave Desert, they
are still semi-arid. Thus, seed banks might be more
important to re-establish populations following
droughts than in more temperate forests. Extensive
die-offs of perennial species have been recorded in
low-elevation ecosystems of the Mojave Desert during
recent decades (Hereford et al., 2006), but it is unclear if
similar die-offs occurred at the higher elevations and
whether drought-related mortality provides sufﬁcient
evolutionary pressure to select for seed banks. With
tree canopy cover at a maximum of 50% (Table 1), these
forests are more open than many temperate forests.
This openness might make germination from soil seed
banks a viable recruitment strategy in these forests
compared to more closed-canopy forests. Some of the
major perennial species in the seed bank are intolerant
or only moderately tolerant of shade, suggesting that
the forest openness was important for their persist-
ence. For example, the three most frequent shrub
species
–
Cercocarpus ledifolius, Ribes cereum and
Purshia stansburiana – in soil seed banks are, at most,
moderately shade tolerant (FEIS, 2011). The possibility
that incomplete canopy closure in these forests

Seed banks of coniferous forests

facilitated greater use of seed banks by mature forest
species warrants additional research.
The sparseness of exotic and ruderal species partly
meant that mature forest species proportionally
dominated seed banks and could also be related to
several factors. The aboveground vegetation at the
sites was not dominated by exotic or annual species,
which might have limited inputs to the seed bank.
Livestock grazing does not occur in the study area and
is known to promote short-lived plants in other forests
(Bakker et al., 2010). Similarly, Allen et al. (2008) found
that burning a Great Basin Desert pinyon–juniper
woodland site to the north of our study area reduced
soil seed-bank density of the shrub Artemisia tridentata
(a species also found in our samples) by fourfold and
increased the annual forb Descurainia pinnata fourfold.
These results are consistent with the observation that
ﬁre frequently increases abundance of annual plants in
western coniferous forests (Laughlin and Fule´, 2008).
Our study sites are not known to have burned for at
least decades, potentially contributing to the low
abundance of short-lived species. This mountain range
also is isolated, surrounded by desert land and
contains extensive roadless area, which might serve
to reduce seed dispersal from surrounding lands.
Species of the mature vegetation that were
conspicuously absent from the seed bank were the
conifer tree species, consistent with small seed banks
of conifer trees reported by previous studies. For
example, using the extraction method in Idaho mixed
conifer forests, Kramer and Johnson (1987) extracted
2038 seeds of seven conifer tree species from samples,
but only one seed was viable. Viable seeds of Pinus
ponderosa were detected in the spring seed-bank
sampling of Washington conifer forests by Pratt et al.
(1984) and the study of northern Arizona P. ponderosa
forests by Abella et al. (2007), but at low densities
averaging ,20 seeds m22. Many conifer tree species
have short-lived seeds with low dormancy, often
germinating in the fall of dispersal or the following
spring, thus not forming a persistent seed bank
(Chambers et al., 1999). Some species of Juniperus,
present in the pinyon–juniper forests of our study
area, exhibit longer lived seed, but no Juniperus
seed was detected in seed banks. It is possible
that germination requirements were not met for
these species if their seeds were present (Chambers
et al., 1999).
Comparison to other western conifer forests
A comparison of our results to a sampling of the
previously published literature reveals that the
composition of life-history traits in soil seed banks in
western North American coniferous forests is highly
variable. In mature mixed conifer forests in Idaho,
nearly 50% of seed-bank species were perennial forbs,
but three genera accounted for 50% of the viable seeds
(Ceanothus, Physocarpus and Carex; Kramer and
Johnson, 1987). Wienk et al. (2004) also noted that

perennial species dominated soil seed banks in South
Dakota P. ponderosa forests. Pratt et al. (1984) observed
that 44% of species in a P. ponderosa forest soil seed
bank were perennial forbs, but annual forb seeds
comprised 45% of the density of seeds and woody
species less than 1%. Sixty-three per cent of species in
the seed bank were also present in the aboveground
vegetation. Koniak and Everett (1982) reported that
89% of emerging plants in a California Pinus
monophylla woodland were annuals. In contrast,
Allen et al. (2008) reported a majority of perennial
species (including many Artemisia tridentata seeds) in
pre-ﬁre seed banks in a Nevada P. monophylla wood-
land. In meadows of the Cascade Mountains, ruderal
species were dominant and only approximately 30% of
species in the aboveground vegetation were also in the
seed bank (Lang and Halpern, 2007). Korb et al. (2005)
also noted large amounts of ruderals in seed banks of
three P. ponderosa sites in northern Arizona. Abella et al.
(2007) reported that 40% of species in soil seed banks of
a wide range of P. ponderosa sites were annuals and
33% were perennials, a much lower percentage of
perennial species than in the present study. Resolving
reasons for the apparent large variability in plant life
forms dominating seed banks among different land-
scapes within this coniferous forest region warrants
additional research.
Environment and vegetation
Seed-bank characteristics did not display strong
relationships with environmental variables, vegetation
cover or forest community types. Soil texture, shown
experimentally to be important for seed retention
(Chambers, 1995; Benvenuti, 2007), exhibited the
strongest correlation with seed density of any
environmental variable, but the correlation was still
weak at #0.42. Despite sampling sites that spanned an
elevation range of 2146–3292 m, elevation was not
related to any seed-bank characteristic, contrasting
with some previous studies of European soil seed
banks (Ortega et al., 1997; Cummins and Miller, 2002).
The Spring Mountains are also topographically diverse
(Niles and Leary, 2007), but no topographic measures
were correlated with seed banks. Our study did not
systematically sample along topographic gradients in
the way that Ashton et al. (1998) did. They found that
seed banks differed from valleys to ridge tops in
eastern USA deciduous forests. Using a systematic
gradient design might be useful to explore potential
ﬁner-scale variation in seed banks in our study area.
Lack of relationship between seed banks and site-level
tree canopy cover contrasts sharply with a previous
study 250 km to the south-east of ours, on a P. ponderosa
forest landscape, where seed density was threefold
greater below open compared to dense canopies
(Abella and Springer, 2008). Some previous studies in
western USA coniferous forests found that, contrasting
with our results, seed banks differed among ecosystem
and forest types within landscapes (Kramer and
Johnson, 1987; Abella et al., 2007). While vegetation
in our study segregated by forest type, which would be
expected to result in seed bank differences via seed
inputs, the rarity of most species within the seed-bank
data made composition of sites mostly individualistic.
With 50% of sites within the narrow range of 106–282
seeds m22, spatial variability in seed banks also was
low. This low variation would temper relationships to
environmental and vegetation variables and likely
accounts for the low bivariate correlations and the lack
of difference in seed banks among forest types.
Considerations for forest management
Soil seed banks are a central consideration for
ecosystem management strategies and forecasting
potential plant recruitment after disturbance (Bossuyt
and Hermy, 2001). Findings of this study suggest
several considerations for forest management to
understand plant regeneration potential, disturbance
regimes and exotic species management. Land
managers have considered fuels and ﬁre potential to
be hazardous on our study landscape, and thus are
thinning trees to decrease fuel loads (Graham et al.,
2010). This also creates opportunities for understorey
plant recruitment. Our results suggest that while the
seed bank is not large, more than half of the species
detected in the seed bank are present in existing
vegetation and the seed bank may be important to
population dynamics following tree thinning. The
seed bank was especially rich in perennial species and
contained seeds of such predominant species as Poa
fendleriana, Arabis fendleri, Draba californica and Cerco-
carpus ledifolius, representing a range of grass, forb and
shrub growth forms. Examining successional path-
ways, such as after wildﬁres and tree thinning, may be
useful in future research to evaluate the correspon-
dence of seed banks with actual successional patterns
(Wienk et al., 2004). The general structure of the seed
bank (forb- and shrub-dominated with a component of
graminoids) mirrored and reinforced the physiog-
nomy of the vegetation. This physiognomy could have
important
implications
for
disturbance
itself,
especially ﬁre, which can behave differently in
shrub–forb versus grass fuels (Graham et al., 2010).
An additional important ﬁnding of this study was that
exotic species were sparse in the seed bank. Only four
exotic species were detected and all occurred at #11%
of sites. Sample sites were not located along roadsides,
on wildﬁres or on other heavily disturbed sites, which
might have potential to contain greater exotic seed-
bank densities. Much of the landscape, however, is
Seed banks of coniferous forests
215

currently in a relatively undisturbed state, represented
by our sample sites where exotic species in the
vegetation were also sparse. Results suggest that soil
seed banks were dominated by native perennial
species characteristic of mature forests.
