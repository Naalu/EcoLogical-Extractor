Introduction 
The Flagstaff Watershed Protection Project (FWPP) represents a unique partnership between 
the City of Flagstaff, the State of Arizona, and Coconino National Forest to help reduce 
hazardous forest fuels and potential for uncontrollable wildfire and flooding on approximately 
10,544 acres of Coconino National Forest land. Two general areas of the Forest were identified 
for fuels reduction treatment -- Dry Lake Hills and Mormon Mountain. Much of this land is 
important habitat for the Mexican spotted owl (MSO), a federally threatened wildlife species. 
Habitat characteristics that are preferred by MSO for nesting and roosting include complex, 
multi-layered, mixed conifer and pine-oak forests on steep slopes. High quality habitat tends to 
have higher large tree densities and canopy cover, an abundance of large live trees and standing 
dead snags, and an abundance of large logs (Ganey and Balda 1994, Ganey et al. 1999, May et 
al. 2004). Although Mexican spotted owls are often found in forests with higher tree density and 
canopy cover, two primary threats to MSO populations are timber harvest (i.e., logging of larger 
trees) and stand-replacing wildfire.  
The recently revised MSO Recovery Plan (USFWS 2012) describes how hazardous fuels 
treatments may be conducted within Protected Activity Centers (PACs), i.e., designated 
protected sites where owls have been observed (US Fish and Wildlife Service 2012). However, 
presently there is very little information regarding how owls may respond to fuels treatments. 
Essentially no research has been conducted to test MSO responses to alternative treatment 
prescriptions and intensities within PACs.  
In collaboration with the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), US Forest Service (FS), City 
of Flagstaff, and Greater Flagstaff Forests Partnership (GFFP), the Ecological Restoration 
Institute (ERI) at Northern Arizona University is helping to investigate MSO responses to 
changes in habitat characteristics associated with FWPP hazardous fuels treatments. Due to the 
importance of MSO conservation, findings from this work likely will serve as one benchmark for 

 
2 
 
evaluating success of FWPP. In summer of 2014, the ERI initiated installation of forest structure, 
vegetation, and fuels monitoring plots, and collected pre-treatment data in the Dry Lake Hills 
(DLH) area of FWPP. Specific objectives of 2014 work were to do the following: 1) quantify 
forest structure, vegetation, and fuels characteristics in PACs before hazardous fuels reduction 
treatments are implemented; 2) quantify forest structure, vegetation, and fuels characteristics in 
reference PACs that will not be treated under FWPP; and 3) make data summaries available to 
USFWS researchers and US Forest Service staff for their analysis.  
Funding for plot installation, data collection and analysis, and production of this pretreatment 
summary report was provided by FWPP bond funds (City of Flagstaff), Arizona Technology 
Research Initiative Funds (TRIF), and a USDA Forest Service grant (USDA-FS #14-DG-
11031600-055) awarded to the Southwest Ecological Restoration Institutes (SWERI) under 
authorization of the Southwest Forest Health and Wildfire Prevention Act.  
 
Methods 
 
Study Sites 
In summer of 2014 the ERI installed long-term monitoring plots and sampled attributes of 
forest structure, vegetation, and fuels within three PACs to be treated in Dry Lake Hills area of 
FWPP as well as three PACs that are to remain untreated (reference) and are located outside of 
FWPP (Figure 1). The three sampled PACs within FWPP were “Mt Elden”, “Orion Spring”, and 
“Schultz Creek”. The three Control PACs outside FWPP were “Little Springs”, “East Bear Jaw”, 
and “Snow Bowl”.  PACs were 600-659 acres in size and ranged from 7,361 to 8,998 ft in 
elevation, with East Bear Jaw being the lowest in elevation and Orion Spring the highest (Table 
1). Annual precipitation varies from approximately 20 to 31 inches across the six PACs. Soils are 
derived from primarily mixed igneous parent material, and are classified in the Alfisol and 
Mollisol soil orders (Table 1). Common forest overstory species include ponderosa pine (Pinus 
ponderosa Lawson & C. Lawson.), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), limber 
pine (Pinus flexilis James), white fir (Abies concolor (Gord. & Glend.) Lindl. ex Hildebr.), and 
quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.). Although limber pine and southwestern white pine 
co-occur in habitats across the study sites, they are difficult to distinguish from one another and 
may naturally hybridize (K. Waring personal communication). In this work, we did not attempt 
to separate the two species and categorized all as limber pine.  
 
Field Sampling 
To characterize forest structure, vegetation, and fuels, we established 21-36 long-term 
monitoring plots in each of the six PACs. We used a stratified random sampling design with an 
intensity of approximately one plot per 22 acres. Plot stratification was based on treatment type 
within PACs. Plots were randomly located within treatments using a geographic information 
system (GIS; ArcView 9.3).  
In the field, we navigated to plot locations using handheld geographic positioning system 
(GPS) units. We used Garmin 12 GPS units that have a nominal accuracy of 15 m (root mean 
square error; rms). At each location, we drove a small piece (3/4” x 8”) of steel rebar into the soil 
to monument the plot for future relocation. On each piece of rebar, we affixed an aluminum tag, 
on which the site and plot number was embossed. We also nailed an aluminum reference tag to 
the base on a large, live tree nearby and embossed the distance and direction to the rebar on this 
tag. Tree reference information was recorded in an electronic database. Using the rebar as the 

 
3 
 
center point, we sampled forest structure, and vegetation using nested, circular plots (Fig. 2). 
Within a 0.2-ac plot, we located “large” snags (standing dead trees ≥ 16 diameter at breast height 
(dbh; 4.5 ft above the ground surface). Each large snag was identified to species and measured 
for dbh and height. Within a nested 0.10-ac plot, we located all live trees ≥ 1 in dbh. Trees 
species was recorded and all live trees were measured for dbh, total height, and crown base 
height. Also with the 0.1-ac plot, we located large dead and down logs (≥16 inches diameter at 
stump height (dsh) measured at 40 cm above root collar) and measured dsh. Logs were measured 
if they had been once live trees rooted within the plot. Coarse woody debris (e.g., tree branches, 
chunks of wood, etc.) that could not be identified as an individual tree originating in the plot was 
not sampled. Numbered aluminum tags were nailed to all snags and trees in the plots.  
In smaller nested plots (0.025-ac) centered on the rebar, we tallied small trees (< 1 inch dbh) 
and tree seedlings (< 4.5 ft height) (hereafter “regeneration”). For each of these tallied, we 
recorded species and condition (live or dead). We also tallied shrubs by species in these plots. 
We did not assign numbered tags to small trees, seedling. 
On each plot, we sampled dead, woody, surface fuels on two 50-foot planar transects 
according to methods described in Brown (1974). The two transects were systematically oriented 
along south and west cardinal directions, respectively, radiating outward from the center point 
rebar. Woody fuels were tallied by the following moisture lag classes: 1) 1-hour (0.0.25 inches in 
diameter); 2) 10-hour (0.25-1.0 inches diameter); 3) 100-hour (1.0-3.0 inches diameter); and 4) 
1000-hour (> 3 inches diameter). The largest class (1000-hour) was additionally subdivided into 
sound and rotten categories. Planar transects used for surface fuels measurements were also used 
to estimate canopy cover. On each transect, canopy cover “hits” (yes/no) were determined at 10 
equally spaced points using a sighting tube-type densitometer. Thus, 20 canopy cover points 
were sampled on each plot. 
Lastly, we collected digital photographs at each plot. Photos were taken from two cardinal 
points (north and east) on the boundary of the nested overstory plot. Photos were taken from 
points toward the center rebar. Digital photos and all data described above were archived and 
stored electronically on a data server at Northern Arizona University. 
 
Analysis 
For pretreatment summaries, we calculated means and standard deviations of forest structure, 
vegetation and fuels variables for individual PACs. Forest structure variables included trees ac-1, 
basal area (BA; ft2 ac-1), large (> 16 in) snags ac-1, large (>16 in) logs ac-1, density (no. ac-1) of 
live shrubs and tree regeneration. We calculated mean relative importance (RI) index values for 
species within PACs following methods adapted from Curtis and McIntosh (1951). This index 
was calculated for each species as the relative density ((species trees ac-1/total trees ac-1)*100) 
plus relative dominance ((species BA/total BA)*100). Thus, importance index values for each 
species within PACs ranged from 0 (not occurring) to 200 (completely monotypic). To classify 
composition of PACs based on importance values, we included overstory species with 
importance values > 20. We calculated canopy cover as: (no. canopy “hits”/20)*100. To provide 
baseline summaries for monitoring potential fire hazard, we calculated both crown and surface 
fuel loading. We used species-specific component biomass equations given in Ter-Mikaelian and 
Korzukhin. (1997) to calculate individual tree foliage mass, then summed these amounts to 
calculate crown fuel loading (kg m-2) on plots. Note that crown fuel load is commonly expressed 
in Standard International units; however, conversion to English units is the following: 1 kg m-2 = 

 
4 
 
0.2048 lb ft-2. We used equations in Brown (1974) to calculate woody surface fuel loading (t ac-
1) by moisture-lag class.  
Data were summarized for each PAC in terms of habitat elements described in the MSO 
Recovery Plan (US Fish and Wildlife 2012). In addition, we also provide summaries for the nest 
core area of the Schultz Creek PAC (Appendix 1).  
 
Results 
Stand structure and vegetation 
Tree species composition varies across the six PACs sampled (Table 1). Based on relative 
importance (RI) values, all with the possible exception of the Little Springs PAC, should be 
considered warm/dry mixed conifer forests (see Reynolds et al. 2013). For example, ponderosa 
pine is common (RI > 20) in all PACs except Little Springs. This species was more important 
than other species in Orion Spring, Schultz Creek, and East Bear Jaw PACs. Douglas-fir also 
was common and showed RI values > 20 in all PACs. This species had the highest relative 
importance in the Snowbowl PAC. White fir and limber pine were less important than ponderosa 
pine and Douglas-fir; however, white fir was more important than other species in the Mount 
Elden PAC. Limber pine was the most important species in the Little Springs PAC. Aspen 
occurred in all PACs except East Bear Jaw but was least important overall. Aspen showed RI 
values >20 in both the Little Springs and Snowbowl PACs (Table 1).  
Tree density across the six PACs ranged from 253 trees ac-1 (Snowbowl) to 495 trees ac-1 
(Little Springs) (Table 2). The Little Springs PAC was at least 49% greater in tree density than 
all other PACs sampled. Smaller trees (< 8 inches dbh) were more abundant than large size 
classes in all PACs (Fig. 3). Schultz Creek and East Bear Jaw PACs had the fewest numbers of 
large trees (> 16 inches and > 24 inches dbh) (Table 2). Basal area (BA) showed a similar pattern 
to tree density, and ranged from 97 ft2 ac-1 (Schultz Creek) to 207 ft2 ac-1 (Little Springs). BA 
among the other four PACs ranged 123-164 ft2 ac-1 (Table 2). East Bear Jaw had noticeably 
lower percentages total BA comprised of large trees (> 16 inches dbh and > 18 inches dbh) than 
the other PACs (Table 2.). Canopy cover for all PACs except Little Springs (81%) was below 
60% (Table 2). The Mount Elden PAC had the lowest canopy cover (46%).  
Tree heights were variable across the six PACs (Fig. 4). Orion Spring, Little Springs, and 
Snowbowl PACs tended to have proportionally greater numbers of taller trees as well greater 
ranges (interquartile) of tree heights than the other three PACs. The Mount Elden and Schultz 
Creek PACs had the lowest tree height medians (20.3 ft and 22.3 ft, respectively), whereas the 
East Bear Jaw PAC had the smallest interquartile range (23.3 ft) of tree heights (Fig. 4). 
Density of large (> 18 inches dbh) standing dead snags was similar and ranged 6.8-7.9 snags 
ac-1 across all PACs except East Bear Jaw, which showed only 4.2 snags ac-1 (Table 3). Density 
of large dead and down logs (> 18 inches dsh) was similar among PACs and ranged 11.5-15.5 ac-
1 (Table 3).  
Tree regeneration was by far highest (2476 ac-1) in the Orion Spring PAC, and lowest (128 
ac-1) in the East Bear Jaw PAC (Table 3). Regeneration in the Orion Spring PAC was composed 
primarily of small (1-2-year-old) ponderosa pine seedlings. Ponderosa pine (5-1717 ac-1) as well 
as Douglas-fir (18-565 ac-1) regeneration was found in all PACs. White fir regeneration was 
found in meaningful numbers only in Mount Elden and Schultz Creek PACs (220 ac-1 and 119 
ac-1, respectively), but was also observed in Orion Spring and East Bear Jaw PACs (32 ac-1 and 
1 ac-1, respectively). Both limber pine (8-164 ac-1) and aspen (16-361 ac-1) regeneration was 
found in all PACs except East Bear Jaw.   

 
5 
 
Shrub density ranged from 1194 individuals ac-1 (East Bear Jaw) to 4961 ac-1 (Snowbowl) 
(Table 3). Oregon grape (Berberis repens) was the most abundant shrub observed (371-4691 ac-
1) and was found in all six PACs. Other common shrubs included mountain snowberry 
(Symphoricarpus oreophilus), wild raspberry (Rubus idaeus), and Fendler’s ceanothus 
(Ceanothus fendleri).    
 
 
Fuel loading 
Crown fuel loads across the six PACs ranged from 0.80 kg m-2 (Snowbowl) to 1.20 kg m-2 
(Mount Elden) (Table 4) (for conversion to English units, see Methods Analysis). Crown fuel 
load of individual species within PACs generally followed orders of relative importance. One 
exception was the Little Springs PAC, within which Douglas-fir (0.65 kg m-2) had a greater 
crown fuel load than limber pine (0.29 kg m-2) (Table 4).  
Dead woody surface fuels ranged from 15.9 t ac-1 (East Bear Jaw) to 237.8 t ac-1 (Little 
Springs) across the six PACs (Table 5). All PACs except Little Springs showed total woody 
surface fuel loads less than 65 t ac-1. Thus, the total surface fuel load at Little Spring was more 
than 275% greater than any other PAC (Table 5). The high total value at Little Springs was due 
to larger amounts of coarse woody debris (CWD; i.e., wood pieces > 3 in (diameter), not 
necessarily logs of trees originating on the plot. See Methods Field Sampling). The Snowbowl 
PAC also showed larger amounts of CWD, relative to the other PACs (Table 5). Forest floor 
depths ranged from 1.1 in (Mount Elden and East Bear Jaw) to 2.1 in (Little Springs) across the 
six PACs (Table 5).    
 
Discussion 
Protected Activity Centers sampled in this work varied in terms of forest species 
composition, structure, and fuel loading. For example, among PACs to be treated as a component 
of FWPP, the Orion Spring PAC is primarily composed of relatively large ponderosa pine and 
Douglas-fir trees, with a dense understory of ponderosa pine regeneration. In contrast, the 
Schultz Creek PAC has proportionally more white fir in the overstory, smaller trees, and lower 
density of tree regeneration in the understory. Reference PACs showed similar variability, with 
the Little Springs and East Bear Jaw PACs apparently occupying opposite ends of an 
elevation/productivity gradient. At this time, it is unclear how this variability may affect baseline 
owl responses such as occupancy and fledging success.  
Tree densities in PACs were similar to those in other warm/dry mixed conifer forests in 
northern Arizona. For example, Cocke et al. (2005) found 293-332 trees ac-1 in ponderosa pine 
and mixed conifer forests, respectively, on the south slopes of the San Francisco Peaks near the 
Dry Lake Hills area. Cocke et al. (2005) reported basal area to range 150-197 ft2 ac-1. 
Contemporary conditions reflect substantial structural changes compared with conditions 
occurring in the late 1800s (Cocke et al. 2005). These changes were likely brought on by 
interruption of surface fire disturbance regimes, and existing conditions warrant restoration and 
fuels reduction treatments. For example, Chancellor et al. (2013) found that the NEXUS fire 
behavior model predicted active crown fire for warm/dry mixed conifer forests with similar 
crown fuel loading in the White Mountains of Arizona. Differences among PACs in 
composition, structure, and fuel loading require site-specific prescriptions to effectively reduce 
fuel hazards while also attempting to maintain MSO habitat quality. Fuel hazard reduction 
prescriptions developed to address site-specific characteristics of the individual PACs will likely 
vary in several important ways, including treatment intensity, tree size class and species targets, 

 
6 
 
and type (e.g., manual thinning and/or prescribed fire). To account for this variability, long-term 
monitoring forest dynamics and MSO responses in both FWPP PACs as well as untreated 
reference PACs is of critical importance.  
Pretreatment data summaries presented in this report provide an initial baseline for 
monitoring, and can help in adapting treatment plans and future studies. Monitoring of both 
structural changes and effects of treatments on fuel loading can be assessed using these data.   
 
Monitoring Recommendations 
Work on this project led to two main recommendations for adjusting monitoring methods and 
measurements. The following adjustments will be made in future work: 
1. Decrease minimum standing dead snag size to 11.8 inches (30 cm) dbh 
2. Incorporate coarse woody debris (CWD) sampling. CWD should be tallied on 0.10-
ac nested overstory plot in the following classes: 
a. Small logs: 3.3-9.7 ft (1.0-2.95 m) length, and 7.9-18 in (20.0-45.7 cm) 
diameter large end 
b. Medium logs: ≥9.8 ft (3.0 m) length, and 7.9-18 in (20.0-45.7 cm) diameter 
large end; Or, 3.3-9.7 ft (1.0-2.95 m) length and ≥18 in (45.7 cm) diameter 
large end 
c. Large logs: ≥9.8 ft (3.0 m) length, and ≥18 in (45.7 cm) diameter large end
