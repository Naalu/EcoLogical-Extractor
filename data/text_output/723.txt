Summary
1. Historical reference conditions have long been used to guide the restoration of degraded
ecosystems. However, a rapidly changing climate and altered disturbance regimes are calling
into question the usefulness of this approach. As a consequence, restoration goals are increas-
ingly focused on creating communities that are resilient to novel environmental stressors and
emphasis is being placed on deﬁning functional targets through the use of plant traits. While
changes in forest structure and composition have received much attention, long-term changes
in stand-level functional traits are not well understood.
2. We used dendrochronology to reconstruct historical forest structure and composition in
1880, the year immediately following the disruption of the natural ﬁre regime in a mixed
conifer forest in Arizona, USA. We analysed the differences in pre-settlement and contem-
porary forest composition, structure and community-weighted mean (CWM) traits, and
functional diversity metrics (Rao’s Q and functional richness) for four plant functional
traits: leaf nitrogen content (leaf N), speciﬁc leaf area (SLA), wood density and bark
thickness.
3. We observed signiﬁcant shifts in forest composition, structure, CWM traits and functional
diversity from 1880 to 2011. These changes reﬂect a reduction in ﬁre and drought tolerance,
driven largely by increases in the relative importance of Abies concolor and Pinus strobiformis.
Compositional changes were associated with declines in CWM leaf N, SLA, wood density
and bark thickness. We found lower multitrait functional diversity (Rao’s Q) in contemporary
forests driven primarily by leaf N; however, bark thickness variation was greater in contem-
porary forests than in 1880.
4. Synthesis and applications. Compositional shifts towards reduced average bark thickness
and wood density in contemporary forests driven by land-use change have likely reduced
forest resilience to both ﬁre and drought. Managers can manipulate forest structure and
species composition to achieve functional objectives by increasing stand-level bark thick-
ness to promote ﬁre tolerance and increasing stand-level wood density to promote drought
tolerance. Forecasts for extended ﬁre seasons along with declining precipitation are pro-
jected for many ecosystems around the planet. A focus on restoring optimal functional
trait combinations may be as important as managing ecosystem structure for restoring
resilient ecosystems.

Introduction
Synergistic effects of climate and wildﬁre constrain the
distribution and abundance of tree species around the
world (Bond, Woodward & Midgley 2005). As weather
patterns trend towards warmer and drier conditions, the
size and severity of forest wildﬁres will intensify in many
regions (Westerling et al. 2006), and ecosystems are likely
to experience novel combinations of environmental condi-
tions and disturbances (Hobbs, Higgs & Harris 2009).
Anticipating ecological responses to these processes is
relevant to restoration practitioners attempting to meet
multiple management objectives. Recent advances in trait-
based restoration ecology offer promise in addressing
these problems (Laughlin 2014; Ostertag et al. 2015).
Mixed conifer forests of the western United States are
complex in terms of structure and disturbance regimes
(Romme, Floyd & Hanna 2009). Based on the variation
in abiotic and biotic conditions, two major mixed conifer
subtypes are widely recognized: a ‘warm/dry’ type and a
‘cool/moist’ type. This study focuses on the former of the
two forest types. Warm/dry forests were historically domi-
nated by ﬁre-tolerant Pinus ponderosa Lawson & C. Law-
son and Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco but also
included Quercus gambelii Nutt., Abies concolor (Gord. &
Glend.) Lindl. ex Hildebr., Pinus strobiformis Engelm.
and Populus tremuloides Michx. (Romme, Floyd & Hanna
2009). There is strong evidence that composition was reg-
ulated by frequent, low-intensity surface ﬁres that burned
at mean return intervals ranging 2–30 years. (Grissino-
Mayer et al. 2004; Huffman, Zegler & Fule 2015).
Over the last century, intensive land uses including
unregulated livestock grazing, selective timber harvesting
and active ﬁre suppression have resulted in signiﬁcant
shifts in forest composition and structure in warm/dry
mixed conifer forests (Fule, Korb & Wu 2009). A major
consequence of this has been large increases in tree densi-
ties and a shift in dominance towards more shade- and
ﬁre-intolerant species (Huffman, Zegler & Fule 2015). In
turn, wildﬁres in these forests have become increasingly
more severe (Westerling et al. 2006). There is a concerted
effort
to
mitigate
this
risk
through
landscape-scale
restoration efforts (Schultz, Jedd & Beam 2012). Restora-
tion treatments are based largely on applying the concept
of reference conditions and the natural range of variabil-
ity, deﬁning targets based on historical forest structure
and composition (Roccaforte et al. 2015).
Although recent changes in contemporary forest struc-
ture and composition have received much attention, func-
tional trait responses related to these changes are not
fully understood. Studies have shown that shifts in struc-
ture and composition have been primarily due to decreas-
ing relative importance of ﬁre-tolerant P. ponderosa and
P. menziesii (Korb, Fule & Wu 2013; Huffman, Zegler &
Fule 2015). A signiﬁcant decline of the historically domi-
nant species can restrict the ability of practitioners to
deﬁne species-speciﬁc targets using historical composition
and structure. Additionally, as climate change progresses,
forest ecosystems in many regions are expected to experi-
ence conditions outside of their natural range of variabil-
ity, increasing the probability of widespread mortality and
large-scale disturbance events (Williams et al. 2010). As a
consequence, deﬁning restoration targets based on histori-
cal conditions might become less relevant. One alternative
is for restoration practitioners to focus on restoring resili-
ent ecosystems by targeting functional attributes better
adapted to anticipated future environmental conditions.
A trait-based approach offers a complementary alterna-
tive that focuses restoration efforts on meeting functional
targets (Ostertag et al. 2015). Functional targets can be
deﬁned based on historical reference conditions or future
desired
conditions
under
anticipated
environmental
changes (Laughlin et al. 2016). Deﬁning functional targets
based on historical conditions would provide a useful
complement when the loss of historically dominant species
makes it difﬁcult to restore past forest composition and
structure. In this case, species abundance distributions can
be targeted that meet historical wood density, bark thick-
ness or ﬁre tolerance indices. Alternatively, in systems that
lack reference information, practitioners may want to
increase ﬁre tolerance by targeting species abundance dis-
tributions that increase stand-level bark thickness (Pausas
2015), or may want to increase wood density to enhance
drought tolerance (Laughlin et al. 2011). Applying a trait-
based framework requires an understanding of how traits
confer ﬁtness under different environmental conditions
and management practices (Garnier & Navas 2012).
Recent work in comparative ecology has identiﬁed two
independent axes of plant specialization. The leaf eco-
nomics spectrum (LES) describes a gradient from species
with short-lived leaves that allow for the acquisition and
processing of carbon, nutrients and water more rapidly
than those with longer-lived leaves that reduce carbon and
nutrient turnover (Reich 2014). Species with leaf traits that
allow for the quick acquisition of resources tend to domi-
nate in early successional, higher resource environments
compared to species that use a more conservative resource
use strategy (Reich 2014). Leaf traits associated with the
LES such as speciﬁc leaf area (SLA, ratio of leaf area to dry
mass) and nutrient concentrations have also been shown to
inﬂuence litter ﬂammability (Grootemaat et al. 2015). This
has important implications in semi-arid environments
where litter accumulation is high and ﬁne surface fuels are
the primary source of surface ﬁre spread (Bradstock &
Cohn
2002).
The
wood
economics
spectrum
(WES)
describes a gradient from species with dense wood with low
tissue moisture content to species with lower wood density
and higher moisture content (Baraloto et al. 2010). Higher
density wood confers greater resistance to drought-induced
cavitation (Hacke et al. 2001) and may also play a role in
ﬁre tolerance by allowing species to compartmentalize dam-
age and reduce the risk of mortality (Romero & Bolker
2008; Brando et al. 2012). Bark thickness has been shown
to align with the WES (Baraloto et al. 2010) and represents

a key adaptation related to ﬁre resistance (Jackson, Adams
& Jackson 1999).
Our objective was to assess century-long changes in
overstorey forest composition, structure and functional
diversity in a warm/dry mixed conifer forest where the
historical surface ﬁre regime was interrupted ca 1880 and
where subsequent selective harvesting occurred in the
mid-1900s (e.g. Huffman, Zegler & Fule 2015). This land-
use history is common in mixed conifer forests of the
western
United
States.
Community-weighted
mean
(CWM) traits are useful for assessing the changes in the
dominant trait values within a community and can be
related to successional shifts in plant strategies (Lohbeck
et al. 2013). Functional diversity reﬂects the variation in
trait values present within a community (Mason & de
Bello 2013) and can be useful for understanding how envi-
ronmental
ﬁltering
inﬂuences
community
assembly
(Enquist
et al.
2015).
We
analysed
four
traits
that
together represent the LES and WES and reﬂect impor-
tant characteristics of species adapted to semi-arid, fre-
quent-ﬁre ecosystems. We asked the following questions:
(i) ‘How have forest composition and structure changed
since ﬁre exclusion in 1880?’; (ii) ‘How have community-
level SLA, leaf N, wood density, bark thickness and func-
tional diversity changed since ﬁre exclusion in 1880?’; and
(iii) ‘Do the long-term changes reﬂect a shift in ﬁre toler-
ance on the landscape?’
Materials and methods
STUDY SYSTEM
We conducted our study within a 1135-ha warm/dry mixed coni-
fer ecosystem on the Black Mesa Ranger District of the Apache-
Sitgreaves National Forest in northern Arizona (34°2203857″N &
111°001518″W). Elevation on the site ranges from 2313 to
2405 m with an average annual precipitation of 695 mm and
average temperature of 55 °C (Laing et al. 1987; Fig. 1). Over-
storey community composition was composed of the following
tree species: P. ponderosa, P. menziesii, Q. gambelii Nutt., Pinus
strobiformis Engelm., Abies concolor (Gord. & Glend.) Lindl. ex
Hildebr., Populus tremuloides Michx., Acer grandidentatum Nutt.
and Robinia neomexicana A. Gray (Table 1). Topography of the
site is characterized by gently sloping terrain bisected by small,
steep drainages with infrequent rock outcroppings present.
Huffman, Zegler & Fule (2015) found that the last major ﬁre
at the site occurred in 1879; only one scar recording a ﬁre date
after this time was identiﬁed across 133 wood samples (1023
cross-dated ﬁre scars). Similar ﬁre regime disruptions have been
widely documented in western frequent-ﬁre forests and linked to
intensive, unregulated livestock grazing associated with industrial-
ization as well as active ﬁre suppression (Covington & Moore
1994). Recent livestock grazing has not occurred at the site. In
addition, large cut stumps of P. ponderosa and P. menziesii trees
at the site evidenced extensive selective timber harvesting that
took place across the Mogollon Rim in the mid-1900s (Huffman,
Zegler & Fule 2015; Rodman et al. 2016).

FOREST STRUCTURE
Current overstorey composition and structure were determined
using 146 permanent 004-ha plots, arrayed on a 250-m system-
atic grid originating from a randomly selected starting point
within the project area. Grid point locations were generated using
a geographic information system (ARCGIS 9.3; Environmental
Systems Research Institute, Redlands, CA, USA) and overlaid on
a site map. Points were used as centres of circular (1128-m-
radius) sample plots on which species and condition for all trees
present, both living and dead, were recorded. Diameter at breast
height (dbh, measured at 137 m height on stem) was recorded
for live trees, and diameter at stump height (dsh, measured at
40 cm above root collar) was recorded for dead trees. Increment
cores were collected at dsh from all live trees presumed to be
≥130 years old and a random sample (10%) of younger trees.
For conifers, increment cores were collected from all live trees
≥375 cm dbh; we collected cores from all aspen trees ≥20 cm
dbh, and from all oak, maple and locust ≥17 cm dbh, following
the methods described in Fule, Covington & Moore (1997).
In the absence of ﬁre, wood decomposition in the south-west is
extremely slow and evidence of remnant tree structures (i.e.
stumps, snags, logs) from the late 1800s is still readily apparent
(Fule, Covington & Moore 1997; Sanchez Meador & Moore
2010). This remnant evidence in combination with contemporary
forest structure can be used to develop reliable forest reconstruc-
tions (Huffman et al. 2001). To quantify the forest composition
and structure prior to ﬁre exclusion, we used techniques of den-
drochronology (Stokes & Smiley 1996) and the process outlined
by Bakker (2005) and Fule, Covington & Moore (1997) to recon-
struct historical tree basal area, density and composition on each
plot. In brief, we used live and dead (stumps, snags, logs, etc.)
tree morphological characteristics combined with increment cores
to determine tree age, with species-speciﬁc basal area increment,
tree allometry (e.g. bark thickness equations from Laughlin et al.
2011) and snag and log decomposition (Rogers et al. 1984) equa-
tions to determine the historical status (live or dead) and size of
all trees sampled prior to ﬁre exclusion. These methods have been
validated and are widely used in P. ponderosa and mixed conifer
forests in the south-west. Comparisons of reconstructed stand
conditions with actual historical data indicate that these methods
are reliable within 10% (Huffman et al. 2001; Moore et al.
2004) and robust to assumptions (Fule, Covington & Moore
1997; Sanchez Meador & Moore 2010). We chose to reconstruct
forest conditions in the year 1880, which represented conditions
at the time of disruption of the natural ﬁre regime at our site
(Huffman, Zegler & Fule 2015). Reconstructing forest structure
to an earlier date would not be appropriate given that the fre-
quent ﬁres during this time would have likely consumed much of
the downed woody material.
FUNCTIONAL STRUCTURE
We assessed the changes in functional structure using four func-
tional traits: leaf nitrogen content (leaf N), speciﬁc leaf area
(SLA), wood density and bark thickness. Trait values were
obtained
for
each
species
using
standardized
methods
as
described in Appendix S1 (Supporting Information).
Two important metrics were calculated to describe the changes
in overstorey functional structure. First, we calculated a commu-
nity-weighted mean (CWM) trait value for each trait in both the
reconstructed historical forest and the contemporary forest. A
CWM trait value was calculated as:
X
s
i¼1
tijpik;
eqn 1
where tij is the average value of trait j for species i and pik is the
relative abundance of species i in plot k. In this study, we used
importance values (IV)s as our measure of abundance and calcu-
lated the proportions of relative abundance based on IVs for each
species at the plot level. Importance values represent a measure
of dominance of species in a given community by combining tree
density and basal area. Plot-level species importance values (IV:
sensu Curtis & McIntosh 1951) were calculated as:
IVi ¼
BAi
BAk total


 100


þ
Di
Dk total


 100

;
eqn 2
where BAi is the basal area (m2 ha1) and Di the density
(trees ha1) of species i, respectively, and BAk total and Dk total are
the total basal area and tree density in plot k. Therefore, a CWM
trait value (i.e. eqn 1) calculated using relative importance (i.e.
pik eqn 1) can be interpreted as the CWM value expressed by an
individual of average importance.
To examine the inﬂuence of species dominance on plot- and
landscape-scale ﬁre tolerance, a plot-level ﬁre tolerance index was
calculated as:
FTI ¼
X
n
i
ðIV  wFTÞ;
eqn 3
where IV is the importance value for species i calculated using
eqn 2, wFT are the species-speciﬁc ﬁre tolerance weights from
Table 1. Fire tolerance weights range in value from 12, signifying
high species ﬁre tolerance, to 1, signifying low species tolerance,
and were determined from the information provided in Reynolds
et al. (2013). The resulting plot-level FTI values represent a mea-
sure of relative ﬁre tolerance, ranging from ≤1000 (highly ﬁre-
intolerant plot-level importance values) to ≥2000 (highly ﬁre-tol-
erant). Lastly, we examined the changes or heterogeneity in ﬁre
Table 1. Names, codes and ﬁre tolerance weights (wFT) for tree
species occurring at the Black Mesa mixed conifer study site. Spe-
cies are sorted from most ﬁre-tolerant to ﬁre-intolerant based on

tolerance variability, both temporally and spatially, by quantify-
ing and comparing the observed change in plot-level FTI value
frequency and autocorrelation (Moran 1950) for the landscape in
1880 and 2011.
Next, we quantiﬁed the functional trait diversity for each trait
using
two
indices:
functional
richness
and
Rao’s
quadratic
entropy (hereafter referred to as functional diversity; Botta-Dukat
2005). Functional richness is calculated as the minimum convex
hull that includes all species in T-dimensional space. Functional
richness describes the volume of trait space ﬁlled by the commu-
nity and has been shown to perform well in communities with
low richness (Mouchet et al. 2010). Calculations of multitrait
functional richness require the number of species in a community
to be greater than the number of traits. Because this was not
strictly the case (i.e. many plots had fewer than ﬁve species), we
chose to calculate single-trait functional richness indices. For a
single trait, functional richness indices represent a measure of the
range of trait values within a community. Functional diversity
(i.e. Rao’s quadratic entropy) is a measure of functional diver-
gence and takes into account both the range of functional space
and the similarity between species weighted by their relative
abundance. As such, diversity characterizes the degree to which
the species are distributed towards the most extreme values
within the community (Mouchet et al. 2010). Because diversity is
not limited by species richness, we calculated both multitrait and
single-trait
diversity
indices.
Both
diversity
and
functional
richness were calculated using the FD package in R (Laliberte,
Legendre & Shipley 2014).
DATA ANALYSIS
First, we examined the differences between the reconstructed 1880
(i.e. pre-settlement) and contemporary 2011 forest composition
and structural attributes using permutational multivariate analysis
of variance (PERMANOVA; Anderson 2001). This method is appropri-
ate for ecological data because it avoids strict assumptions of nor-
mality. A dissimilarity matrix can be obtained using distance
measures appropriate for multivariate (i.e. Bray–Curtis distance)
data. Differences in basal area, trees ha1 and importance values
were examined with time as a ﬁxed effect. Next, differences in com-
munity-weighted mean (CWM) trait values, functional diversity
(i.e. Rao’s quadratic entropy) and functional richness before (1880)
and after (2011) ﬁre exclusion were tested using a paired Wilcoxon
signed-rank test. All analyses were conducted at a = 005 in R ver.
3.1.3 (R Core Development Team 2015). Lastly, changes in ﬁre tol-
erance were explored by computing a single-step transition matrix
(Asmussen 2003) for species dominance of FTI on all plots as
reconstructed following ﬁre exclusion. That is, the transition matrix
is the matrix consisting of the transition probabilities from state x
to state y, rxy, based on estimates derived from changes in species
dominance in FTI for each plot over the 132-year study period
(from 1880 to 2011). Because the sum total probability of transi-
tioning from an initial state i to some state j must be 1, this matrix
is a right stochastic matrix, so that the P
y rxy ¼ 1.
Results
OVERSTOREY COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE
We found signiﬁcant differences between pre-settlement
(1880) and contemporary (2011) forest composition in
terms of basal area, tree density and species importance
values (Table 2). Pre-settlement basal area was dominated
by P. ponderosa and P. menziesii with average contribu-
tions of 39% and 28%, respectively. Abies concolor and
Q. gambelii each contributed 11%. Pinus strobiformis,
P. tremuloides and A. grandidentatum represented minor
components, averaging <1% of the total basal area
(Table 3).

Pre-settlement size distribution was heavily right skewed
(Fig. 2a). Pinus ponderosa dominated the 15-cm to 35-cm
and ≥75-cm size classes, P. menziesii and Q. gambelii were
consistently represented across all size classes, and A. con-
color was present in most size classes, including 017
tree ha1 in the 95-cm size class (Fig. 2a). By 2011, over-
all basal area had increased from 918 to 3163 m2 ha1.
Pinus ponderosa basal area had more than doubled yet its
overall contribution declined to 26% (Fig. 2b). Pseudot-
suga menziesii also increased in absolute terms, yet its
average contribution to basal area declined 13%. Abies
concolor basal area increased to an average of 23% of
total basal area, whereas the basal area contribution of
Q. gambelii decreased from pre-settlement to make up 1%
of total BA. Pinus strobiformis represented an average of
14% of the total basal area in 2011, with marked
increases in tree densities under the 25-cm size class.
Reconstructed pre-settlement tree density averaged 140
trees ha1 (Table 3). Pinus ponderosa accounted for the
majority (32%) at 45 trees ha1, followed by Q. gambelii
(22%) at 31 trees ha1, P. menziesii (29 trees ha1) and
A. concolor (19 trees ha1). Mean tree density increased
to 844 tree ha1 by 2011. Abies concolor was the domi-
nant species numerically and contributed an average of
31% to total tree density, followed by P. menziesii (22%)
and P. ponderosa (20%). Quercus gambelii’s contribution
declined to 6%. Acer grandidentatum increased in both

Prior to ﬁre exclusion, P. ponderosa was the most
important species in the pre-settlement 1880 forest, fol-
lowed
by
P. menziesii,
Q. gambelii,
A. concolor
and
P. tremuloides, respectively (Table 4). By 2011, A. concolor
was the most important species in contemporary forests,
followed by P. menziesii, P. ponderosa, P. strobiformis and
Q. gambelii. The majority of P. ponderosa-dominated FTIs
(ﬁre tolerance index) remained dominated by ﬁre-tolerant
species (i.e. P. ponderosa and P. menziesii) with a third
transitioning to A. concolor and the remainder becoming
P. strobiformis. Contemporary FTIs were clearly domi-

nated by A. concolor (55 plots or 38% of the landscape),
with the majority of these transitioning from either P. pon-
derosa (42%) or P. menziesii (18%). Lastly, the majority
of the historically aspen-dominated plots (10 plots or 7%
of the landscape) transitioned to have FTIs dominated by
either A. concolor (60%) or P. menziesii (30%). While the
landscape as a whole transitioned from largely ﬁre tolerant
to intolerant, areas of higher ﬁre tolerance persisted and
overall heterogeneity in ﬁre tolerance increased from 1880
to 2011 (Fig. 3). Spatially, the historical FTI values for
the landscapes were found to be independent, with con-
temporary conditions exhibiting statistically signiﬁcant
spatial autocorrelation at distances at or below 250 m
(Fig. 3d,e).
FUNCTIONAL TRAITS
We found signiﬁcant directional shifts in all four CWM
traits between 1880 and 2011 (Table 5). Bivariate trait
densities (Fig. 4) revealed that contemporary forests con-
verged on lower SLA, leaf N, wood density and bark
thickness. Since the late 1800s, community-weighted mean
SLA declined by 7%, leaf N by 10%, wood density by
4% and bark thickness by 11% (Table 5).
Shifts in trait means over time were accompanied by
shifts in trait variances as well. Contemporary forest con-
ditions exhibited signiﬁcantly lower multitrait functional
diversity, indicating that the volume of trait space was
more fully occupied in pre-settlement forests. Lower mul-
titrait diversity was driven by a signiﬁcant decline in
the individual diversity of leaf N. Functional richness of
leaf N also declined, indicating a narrower range of values
in the contemporary forest compared with the forest of
1880. In contrast, both functional richness and diversity
of bark thickness increased in the contemporary forest.
No difference in individual trait diversity of SLA or wood
density was detected; however, functional richness of both
traits increased from 1880 to 2011 (Table 5).

Plant traits reveal changes in ﬁre tolerance
7

contemporary mixed conifer forest was signiﬁcantly differ-
ent in overstorey composition, structure, ﬁre tolerance,
CWM traits and functional diversity than the 1880 forest.
Forests in 1880 appeared relatively open, largely ﬁre toler-
ant and dominated by shade-intolerant, ﬁre-tolerant spe-
cies (Reynolds et al. 2013). Multitrait diversity was high
as were CWM SLA, leaf N, wood density and bark thick-
ness. Over the last 132 years, signiﬁcant increases in tree
densities and basal area have altered the distribution of
species relative importance resulting in lower CWM trait
values and diversity. Together, this has led to increases in
both heterogeneity in ﬁre tolerance at the landscape scale
(up to 2500 9 2500 m or 650 ha, distance across study
site)
and
homogeneity
at
small
scales
(≤
below
250 9 250 m or 625 ha, distance between plots). These
changes likely resulted from the combined impacts of ﬁre
suppression and selective harvesting practices that began
in the late 19th century (Huffman, Zegler & Fule 2015).
Greater CWM SLA and leaf N in 1880 reﬂected greater
dominance of Q. gambelii and P. tremuloides. These spe-
cies resprout rapidly after ﬁre, reﬂecting a key adaptation
for persistence in ﬁre-prone ecosystems (Pausas & Brad-
stock 2007). This corresponds to the ﬁndings of Huffman,
Zegler & Fule (2015), who noted large increases in tree
establishment following ﬁre regime disruption and sug-
gested that historical surface ﬁres likely maintained more
open forest conditions. Greater light availability would
have allowed Q. gambelii and P. tremuloides to pre-emp-
tively acquire resources and out-compete slower-growing,
shade-tolerant species. Leaves with higher SLA and nutri-
ent concentrations (e.g. leaf N) have faster ignition rates
but lower ﬂame and smouldering durations (Murray,
Hardstaff
&
Phillips
2013;
Grootemaat
et al.
2015).
Although herbaceous understorey species, which con-
tribute ﬁne fuels needed for frequent surface ﬁres, exhibit
these traits to a greater degree than woody species (Reich,
Walters & Ellsworth 1997), our ﬁndings suggest that these
functional adaptations also extend to the overstorey com-
munity. Selective harvesting of P. ponderosa and P. men-
ziesii in the mid-1900s (Huffman, Zegler & Fule 2015)
likely allowed for an increase in establishment of ﬁre-
intolerant species and a greater range of SLA values. We
also found a lower range of leaf N values along with a
reduction in leaf N diversity, which indicated that the
community became functionally more homogeneous in
terms of leaf N.
Higher CWM wood density in 1880 forests corre-
sponded to a greater importance of P. ponderosa, P. men-
ziesii and Q. gambelii. Wood density is associated with
hydraulic properties and drought tolerance (Chave et al.
2009). Our results suggest that the overstorey community
may have been more tolerant to drought historically. In
addition, wood density has been shown to inﬂuence
wound closure rates, and species with denser woody could
have a competitive advantage in isolating decay from sur-
face ﬁre wounds and thereby reducing mortality (Romero
& Bolker 2008). Shifts in functional richness and diversity
can be attributed to both ﬁre exclusion and selective har-
vesting. These factors would have promoted the recruit-
ment and establishment of additional species, leading to a
greater range of wood density values and functional rich-
ness
in
contemporary
forests.
However,
our
results
showed lower diversity and a more even distribution of
trait values, indicating a community dominated by species
similar in average wood density. Thus, historically ﬁre
was likely a strong environmental ﬁlter, which selected for
higher mean wood density within a narrower range of val-
ues. Under these conditions, there was a greater relative
abundance of species with unique trait values, namely
P. ponderosa, P. menziesii and Q. gambelii.
Bark thickness was also thicker historically than in con-
temporary forests at the site. Lower CWM bark thickness
in 2011 was driven primarily by lower relative importance
of P. ponderosa (bark thickness mean = 199 mm) and
increases
in
P. strobiformis
(bark
thickness
mean =
76 mm). Bark thickness confers resistance to surface ﬁre
(Lawes et al. 2011). Our ﬁndings further indicate that ﬁre
played an integral role in determining the functional and
taxonomic
composition
of
forests
at
the
study
site.
Increases in functional richness of bark thickness suggest
that historically frequent surface ﬁres restricted the viable
range of trait values across these communities. In addition,
a lower diversity of bark thickness in 1880 indicates that
the forest was dominated by a few species with similar bark
thickness.
The importance values used in our analysis accounted
for relative species abundance in terms of both tree den-
sity and basal area. This is important in mixed species
stands in which species differ in important life-history

characteristics such as regeneration and growth. For
example, within our community, Q. gambelii regenerates
primarily through re-sprouting and as a result can be
found at higher densities for a given area than P. pon-
derosa. In contrast, P. ponderosa is a larger species and
will obtain a greater basal area at a given density com-
pared to Q. gambelii. Analysis using a single metric, such
as relative basal area (i.e. BAi=BAk total, eqn 2), yields
qualitatively similar results to those using an importance
index; however, there are differences that highlight the
need to account for relative density (i.e. Di=Dk total, eqn 2)
as well (see Table S1). For example, when relative basal
area is used to calculate CWM traits, SLA does not differ
between time periods. In this case, no change in CWM
SLA reﬂects a greater contribution, in terms of relative
abundance, of larger growing species in both time periods.
Furthermore, pre-settlement CWM SLA and leaf N are
lower when using only basal area because the contribu-
tion, in terms of relative abundance, of species such as
Q. gambelii and P. tremuloides, is not accounted for ade-
quately. Using basal area alone does not account for
important life-history differences between species and may
bias results towards larger species.
Our approach assumes that the temporal variation in
intraspeciﬁc mean trait values was negligible. Historical
climate and disturbance regimes experienced by individu-
als could have resulted in different average trait values
than those expressed by individuals in contemporary for-
ests. While the direction of change may be similar across
species, trait plasticity may differ substantially between

trait values.

species which could inﬂuence the rate at which trait values
change (Enquist et al. 2015).
CONCLUSION AND MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS
Current conditions in temperate mixed conifer forests put
them at increased susceptibility to high-severity ﬁres and
drought as a result of signiﬁcant increases in tree densities
and a shift in dominance towards more ﬁre- and drought-
intolerant species (Fule, Korb & Wu 2009; Huffman, Zeg-
ler & Fule 2015). These compositional and structural
changes were associated with declines in CWM leaf N,
SLA, wood density and bark thickness, and coincide with
an overall decline in functional diversity.
Strategies for restoring ecological resilience and sustain-
ability are a top priority for natural resource managers
(Suding 2011), and a focus on plant traits may be useful to
achieve this goal (Ostertag et al. 2015). This is due in part
to recent advances in trait-based models that provide a
mechanism for translating functional targets into distribu-
tions of species abundance (Laughlin 2014). Deﬁning
appropriate functional targets is fundamental to this
approach. This study integrated historical changes in com-
position with shifts in community-level functional traits of
a mixed conifer forest in western North America, but his-
torical reference information is not always available. Func-
tional traits are being applied in the restoration of multiple
ecosystems throughout the planet (Ostertag et al. 2015;
Cole et al. 2016), by basing restoration treatments on eco-
physiological principles to achieve functional outcomes.
Ecophysiological adaptations to ﬁre and drought pro-
vide a robust framework for restoring ecosystems under
global change. Fire and drought are globally important
disturbances that are projected to increase as a result of
longer ﬁre weather seasons in many ecosystems around
the world (Jolly et al. 2015). Manipulating forest structure
and composition to increase wood density and bark thick-
ness could be a ﬁrst step in restoring forests that are more
resilient to increased ﬁres and drought. Implementing this
new framework will be challenging and require innovative
approaches. A high priority for future research is to test
the success and efﬁcacy of restoring ecosystem resilience
when management objectives are focused on functional
traits.
