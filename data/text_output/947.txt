Our New Website: an
easy-to-use resource for
information about ecology
based restoration
 
Check out our new website! 
The Ecological Restoration Institute is happy to
announce the launch of its new, redesigned
website. The new site displays easy-to-navigate
content that features key research information on
ponderosa pine, mixed-conifer, and pinyon-
juniper ecosystems. Visitors can also easily
access more than 700 ERI publications, read
about the latest news on restoration, and learn
about ERI’s new program area on forest
operations and biomass utilization. The site now
offers land managers online information about
planning for, implementing, monitoring, and
partnering on restoration projects.
