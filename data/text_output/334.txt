Abstract.
Increasing size and severity of wildfires have led to an interest in the effectiveness of forest fuels treatments on
reducing fire severity and post-wildfire fuels. Our objective was to contrast stand structure and surface fuel loadings on
treated and untreated sites within the 2002 Rodeo–Chediski Fire area. Data from 140 plots on seven paired treated–
untreated sites indicated that pre-wildfire treatments reduced fire severity compared with untreated sites. In 2011, coarse
woody debris loading (woody material .7.62 cm in diameter) was 257% higher and fine woody debris (woody
material ,7.62 cm) was 152% higher on untreated sites than on treated sites. Yet, in spite of higher levels of coarse
woody debris on untreated sites, loadings did not exceed recommended ranges based on published literature and many
treated sites fell below recommendations. By 2011, basal area and stand density on treated sites and stand density on
untreated sites met management guidelines for ponderosa pine forests, but untreated sites had basal areas well below
recommendations. Snags declined over this period and only three plots had snags that met minimum size and density
requirements for wildlife habitat by 2011. The effects of pre-wildfire treatments are long-lasting and contribute to changes
in both overstorey and understorey fuel complexes.

Introduction
There is widespread interest in the effectiveness of fuels reduc-
tion treatments in mitigating fire hazard, especially in the face of
increasing size and severity of wildfires in recent decades
(Westerling et al. 2006; Littell et al. 2009). Numerous studies
have examined the effectiveness of variousfuels treatments, both
through modelling and field sampling. Most research has found
that subsequent wildfire severity and crown fire susceptibility
decreased consistently in forests that were thinned and burned to
reduce tree density and stand basal area (Deeming 1990; van
Wagtendonk 1996; Stephens 1998; Fule´ et al. 2001, 2012; Brose
and Wade 2002; Omi and Martinson 2002; Pollet and Omi 2002;
Korb et al. 2012; Prichard and Kennedy 2012; Safford et al.
2012). Yet such treatments may not always be effective,
especially in cases where thinning occurred without the removal
or burning of slash (Raymond and Peterson 2005; Stephens and
Moghaddas 2005; Prichard and Kennedy 2012). Additionally,
in terms of wildlife values and soil protection, there is some
trade-off to thinning, illustrated primarily by the decline in snag
density and sometimes persistent surface fuel loadings below
desired ranges (Raymond and Peterson 2005).
Immediate post-fire effects in treated v. untreated areas have
been widely studied but few studies have analysed the longer-
term effects of fuels treatments on stand dynamics and fuel
loading. Most studies have focussed on burned sites shortly after
the wildfire and used modelling projections to predict recovery
trajectories on longer time scales (Pollet and Omi 2002; Finney
et al. 2007; McIver and Ottmar 2007; Strom and Fule´ 2007).
Some studies have illustrated the longer-term changes in pine
forests after wildfire through chronosequence studies and
modelling (Foxx 1996; Gracia et al. 2002; Greene et al. 2004;
Passovoy and Fule´ 2006; Roccaforte et al. 2012; Stevens-
Rumann et al. 2012) and some have shown that alternative
ecotypes such as grasslands or shrublands may persist in
severely burned areas (Barton 2002; Savage and Mast 2005).
However, few studies have supplied empirical evidence for how
fuels change over time on a single fire, particularly in relation to
the effect of pre-wildfire treatment on post-wildfire fuels and
stand structure over time. Understanding the effect of thinning
and other fuels reduction treatments on post-wildfire recovery
will be critical given recent trends of larger and more severe
wildfires (Westerling et al. 2006; Littell et al. 2009). Thus, in the

present study, we examined the effectiveness of fuel treatments
longer term in reducing fuel loadings and thus preserving forest
structures more resilient to wildfires.
The Rodeo–Chediski Fire, which burned 189 000 ha in 2002
and was at the time the largest wildfire in south-western US
history, has been included in multiple studies on fuels and fire
hazards. Cram and Baker (2003) concluded that pre-wildfire
treatments as much as 20 years previously successfully
decreased crown fire hazard. Finney et al. (2005) and Roccaforte
et al. (2012) also included the Rodeo–Chediski Fire in their
studies and discussed the dynamics of woody debris accumula-
tion. Roccaforte et al. (2012) studied untreated areas of the
Rodeo–Chediski Fire and found woody accumulation similar to
loadings on other fires throughout Arizona. Finney et al. (2005)
compared pre-wildfire treatments and found that the size of
pre-fire treatments affected the longevity and effectiveness of
reducing fire behaviour. In 2011, we remeasured seven paired
treated–untreated sites installed in 2004 by Strom and Fule´
(2007) to assess the differences between short- and longer-term
fuel responses. Strom and Fule´ (2007) found that untreated
stands burned more severely, had lower tree survival and overall
less pine regeneration than treated stands. For the present
subsequent study, we asked: (1) how did fuel complexes differ
between pre-fire-treated and -untreated areas post-wildfire
(2004) and (2) how did fuel complexes (stand structure and
surface fuels) change through time (2011)? We then used these
results to ask: (3) how do permanently marked and tracked
datasets compare with chronosequence studies and (4) how do
these respective post-fire fuel complexes meet forest structure
and wildlife habitat goals 9 years after wildfire?
Methods
Study area
The Rodeo–Chediski Fire burned along the Mogollon Rim in
east-central Arizona. Climate averages for 1950–2012 from the
Heber Ranger Station within the burn area were: July maximum
temperature 29.28C, January minimum temperature 8.78C, and
an annual precipitation of 43.9cm (Western Regional Climate
Center, http://www.wrcc.dri.edu, accessed 25 May 2012; Fig. 1).
Elevation of the study sites ranged from 1990 to 2138 m. The soil
type varies from clay substrates to sandy loams, depending on the
parent material; alluvial gravels are present in drainages, and the
Mogollon Rim itself has a limestone bed. Forests were dominated
by ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) with Gambel oak (Quercus
gambelii) and New Mexico locust (Robinia neomexicana).
Study sites
After the wildfire, Apache–Sitgreaves National Forest managers
identified 14 sites where non-commercial thinning for fuel
reduction and slash disposal through pile burning were con-
ducted between 1990 and 1999, of which seven were randomly
selected for measurement. Untreated sites were chosen adjacent
to the treated sites. The untreated sites had similar topography
and pre-thinning forest structure, with no road or other firebreak
in between to control for other causes of variable fire behaviour
(L. Wadleigh and C. Hoffman, pers. comm., 2003, 2006). In
2004, Strom and Fule´ (2007) established 10 plots in systematic
grids within each of the seven paired study sites, for a total of
140 plots. Plots were permanently marked with a tagged iron
stake sunk to ground level at each plot centre in 2004. We were
able to relocate and measure 135 of the original 140 plots
between May and August of 2011.
Measurements
Downed woody debris, and litter and duff depths were measured
along a 15.2-m planar transect within each plot, using methods
established in Brown (1974). Fine woody debris (FWD) was
classified by size class (0–0.64, 0.65–2.54, 2.55–7.62 cm),
which corresponds to 1-, 10- and 100-h moisture time-lag
classes (Fosberg 1970). Coarse woody debris (CWD, or 1000-h
fuels), were inventoried as logs .7.62 cm and categorised by
sound and rotten classes (Fosberg 1970).

We measured overstorey trees on a variable-radius plot from
the centre of each permanently marked plot using a prism with a
basal area factor of 2.2 m2 ha1 tree1. Tree measurements
included species, condition and diameter at breast height
(DBH). Tree condition classes followed Thomas’ (1979)
description: live, declining and four stages of snags (recent
snag, loose-bark snag, clean snag and snag broken above breast
height). We used a hemispherical fisheye lens on a digital
camera (FC-E8 Fisheye Converter Lens and Nikon CoolPix
E4300, Nikon, Melville, NY, USA) to photograph canopy cover
and analysed these photographs using the Gap Light Analyzer
(Frazer et al. 1999) to quantify percentage canopy openness.
In addition, we rephotographed each plot overview horizontally
to record a series of plot images through time.
Data analysis
In all analyses, sites were the experimental units, resulting in a
total samplesizeofn ¼ 14. Eachplot, 135 intotal,was treated asa
subsample and all analyses were carried out as a paired design.
We tested differences between treated and untreated sites in stand
structure characteristics (canopy cover, basal area and tree den-
sity) and surface fuels (forest floor depth (sum of duff and litter
depths), 1-, 10-, 100-, 1000-h sound and rotten). All residuals met
the assumptions of parametric statistics, based on visual inspec-
tion of q-q plots and histograms. We used repeated-measures
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with site as a blocking factor. Our
model tested the main effects of treatment and year, plus year-by-
treatment interaction. We also used a one-way ANOVA to test
the treated v.untreatedeffect withineachyearseparatelyand year
effect on each treatment separately when we observed a
treatment-by-year interaction (a ¼ 0.05). Additionally, owing to
contract tree removal (G. Richardson, US Forest Service, pers.
comm., 15 March 2012) that occurred on two of the seven
untreated sites since 2004, we performed all individual-year
analysis from 2011 without these sites to determine if there were
significant differences as a result of this activity. Excluding these
two sites did not change the significance of any variable; there-
fore, we chose to include these sites in our analyses to increase
our degrees of freedom. We used JMP (SAS Institute Inc. 2007)
for all these analyses. The F- and P-values shown in Figs 1–2 are
from the repeated-measures analysis, whereas the F- and
P-values expressed in the text are from the one-way ANOVAs.
Results
Surface fuels
All categories of surface fuels had significantly higher loadings
on both treated and untreated sites in 2011, compared with 2004;
however, forest-floor depth did not vary significantly (P . 0.05)
between 2004 and 2011 in either treated or untreated sites. The
increases in fuel loads over time were significantly greater on
untreated sites than treated sites, with differences between
treated and untreated sites becoming more pronounced by 2011,
in all size classes except 10-h fuels. There was significantly more
fuel on both untreated sites and treated sites in several woody
fuel categories in 2011 than 2004, indicating a time-since-fire
effect. We detected a significant year-by-treatment interaction in
the repeated-measures analysis for 1- and 1000-h sound fuels;
thus, we analysed data from the 2 years and two treatments
separately. In all other surface fuel categories (10-, 100- and
1000-h rotten), there was not a significant treatment effect or an
interaction effect. In 2004, mean loadings in all time-lag classes
were slightly, but not significantly, higher on treated sites than
on untreated sites. However, in 2011, mean fuel loadings in all
size categories were higher on untreated sites with significant
differences detected in 1-h fuels (P ¼ 0.0016) and 1000-h sound
fuels (P ¼ 0.0084; Fig. 2). On untreated sites, loadings in all
three of these fuel categories increased significantly between
2004 and 2011 (P , 0.0008), but there were no significant dif-
ferences on treated sites across this time period (P . 0.1).
Forest floor depth did not vary significantly between treated
and untreated sites in either year of sampling. Treated stands had
slightly higher means, but the difference was not significant.
There was a significant increase in depths between years from
1.4  0.4 to 1.7  0.7 cm on treated sites and from 0.9  0.4 to
1.6  1.2 cm on untreated sites.
Stand structure
The analysis of canopy cover revealed a significant year-by-
treatment interaction due to the slight increase in percentage
cover in treated areas and a decrease on untreated areas in 2011
compared with 2004. Thus canopycover wassignificantly higher
on treated sites than on untreated sites in the individual-year
analysis of both 2004 (P ¼ 0.0044) and 2011 (P ¼ 0.0002), with
larger mean differences in 2011. Between 2004 and 2011, can-
opy cover significantly declined (P ¼ 0.0087) on untreated sites,
but significantly increased on treated sites (P ¼ 0.013; Fig. 3a).
Live basal area was relatively unchanged between 2004 and
2011, and ranged from 1.1 to 6 m2 ha1 on untreated sites and
from 3 to 22 m2 ha1 on treated sites. These basal areas were
significantly higher on treated sites than on untreated sites over
both years. There was no significant year or year-by-treatment
interaction between 2004 and 2011 (Fig. 3b). The differences
between untreated and treated sites were not as pronounced in
terms of live stand density, with no significant differences
between treatments. The mean stand density ranged from 47
to 621 trees ha1 on treated sites and 40 to 2166 trees ha1 on
untreated sites. As with basal area, there was not a significant
year effect or a year-by-treatment interaction for live tree
density (Fig. 3c).
There was a significant year-by-treatment interaction for
snag basal area. Snag basal area was significantly higher on
untreated sites than on treated sites in 2004 (P ¼ 0.0067), but not
by 2011 (P ¼ 0.078). The mean snag basal area on untreated
sites declined significantly from 2004 to 2011 (P ¼ 0.0002);
however, on treated sites the decline in snag basal area was not
significant (P ¼ 0.071; Fig. 3d). Snag density did not have a
significant year-by-treatment interaction and was higher on
untreated plots in the repeated-measures analysis. The year
effect was also significant, with snag density significantly
declining on treated and untreated sites from 2004 to 2011. This
low observed snag density in 2011, on both treated and untreated
sites, illustrated that few snags remained standing by this time
(Fig. 3e). We also compared snag stages in 2004 with those
recorded in 2011 and found that most snags were ‘recent snags’
in 2004, but by 2011 most were ‘broken snags’. There were more
snags observed in every category on untreated sites, in both
years (Fig. 4a, b). Finally, in the analysis of snags only .40-cm

DBH, we found mean snag densities of 5.82 snags ha1 on
untreated sites and 2.41 snags ha1 on treated sites (Fig. 4c).
Discussion
Pre-wildfire treatments reduced original fire severity and a
decade later continue to have significant, persistent effects on
post-wildfire fuel complexes when compared with untreated
sites. Tree mortality was high on untreated sites, which resulted
in CWD loads averaging 257% higher than treated sites. How-
ever, these higher surface fuel loadings may not pose a major
management or containment threat because they do not exceed
recommended loadings (Brown et al. 2003).

Changes in fuel complexes
To address our first and second questions of how fuel complexes
differed between pre-fire-treated and -untreated areas following a
wildfire and how these complexes changed through time, we
contrasted surface fuel loadings and stand structure character-
istics. Higher surface fuel loads on both treated and untreated
sites in 2011 compared with 2004 are a product of fire-killed trees
falling over this time period. Pre-wildfire thinning did not have
immediately discernible effects on post-fire surface fuels, but the
difference became more pronounced over time as fire-killed trees
fell, particularly in the untreated areas. Overall, the long-term
effects of pre-wildfire treatment on surface fuels are substantial,

especially on the accumulation of 1000-h sound fuels. These
findings were similar to other studies on pre-wildfire fuels
treatments (Omi and Martinson 2002; Pollet and Omi 2002).
Stand structural attributes differed slightly over the study
period. The observed increase in mean live basal area on treated
sites was likely fostered post-wildfire by reduced overstorey
cover and increased available resources (Fule´ et al. 2005).
However, in untreated sites, the mean live basal area decreased,
indicating residual tree death occurred after the 2004 sampling.
In similar fashion, canopy cover increased in treated areas from
2004 to 2011, whereas it decreased in untreated areas. Thus,
treated sites are recovering and the canopy is filling in the space
left open by fire-killed trees. However, untreated sites continue
to have a smaller overstorey component with decreasing canopy
cover and less basal area in 2011 than in 2004. This canopy
recovery on treated sites and continued canopy decline on
untreated sites is consistent with vegetation simulation model
predictions made by Strom and Fule´ (2007).
Snag basal area and density decline was similar to that
observed by Chambers and Mast (2005) and Passovoy and Fule´
(2006). Both of these studies showed that by 7 years post-
wildfire, the majority of fire-created snags had fallen. In both
years of sampling, untreated plots had more snags than treated
plots. Snag decline lead to higher surface fuel loads from 2004 to
2011, with greater increases on untreated sites. Loadings in all
fuel size classes significantly increased over the study period,
illustrating the increase in fuel common in any forest without
additional removal or fuel consumption from fire.

Chronosequence comparison
To examine our third question of the effectiveness of chron-
osequence studies in predicting changes in fuel complexes over
time, we compared our permanent plots with three studies within
the South-west. Our primary comparison was with Passovoy and
Fule´ (2006), Roccaforte et al. (2012) and Stevens-Rumann et al.
(2012) because these studies examined fires in northern Arizona
and employed similar methods of fuels sampling. We compared
fires within Passovoy and Fule´ (2006) and Roccaforte et al.
(2012) datasets that were 1–3 years and 7–12 years post-fire with
our data from 2 and 9 years after the Rodeo–Chediski Fire.
Stevens-Rumann et al. (2012) quantified fuel loading 10 years
post-fire, so we used their data in our comparison of the later
time period. None of these studies included areas that had pre-
wildfire fuels reduction treatments so for this comparison, we
only used untreated sites within our study (Table 1).
We found that immediately post-fire, FWD (,7.62 cm) was
low in all studies, ranging from ,1 Mg ha1 (Roccaforte et al.
2012) to 3 Mg ha1 (Passovoy and Fule´ 2006). Our data fell
between these values at 1.3 Mg ha1. By 2011, FWD loadings
had increased on our untreated sites to 7.6 Mg ha1, whereas
Roccaforte et al. (2012) reported a mean loading of 7 Mg ha1
and the Passovoy and Fule´ (2006) sites had mean loadings of
7.8 Mg ha1, with the highest FWD loadings on the Stevens-
Rumann et al. (2012) sites at 10 Mg ha1. By this measure, it
appears the increases in FWD were fairly consistent regardless
of whether the study was a repeated-measures analysis or a
chronosequence of fires.
CWD was lower on our sites in 2004 and 2011 compared with
loadingsintheother three studies. At bothtime periods, Passovoy
and Fule´ (2006) and Roccaforte et al. (2012) reported higher
loadings based on their sites than observed on our sites. The fires
studied by Passovoy and Fule´ (2006) had the highest CWD
loadings immediately post-fire in the three studies, but in the later
time period, Roccaforte et al. (2012) and Stevens-Rumann et al.
(2012) recorded loadings double those observed by both
Passovoy and Fule´ (2006) and us, with ,60 Mg ha1 CWD
loads. The increase in CWD across the study period was the
greatest in the case of Roccaforte et al. (2012), increasing by
55 Mgha1, whereas our sites were similar to Passovoy and
Fule´’s (2006) sites with respective changes in fuel loads of 28.9
and 25.2Mg ha1 in the same time period. This indicates that
CWD loadings may be very fire-specific, depending on initial
densities and the size of trees pre-fire. Unharvested ponderosa
pine forests, like some of the study sites from Roccaforte et al.
(2012), will create higher loadings following high tree mortality
compared with high-density, small-diameter, second-growth for-
ests studied in Passovoy and Fule´ (2006) and our study (Table 1).
Snag densities also tended to be higher on the chronose-
quence sites that Passovoy and Fule´ (2006) and Roccaforte et al.
(2012) studied compared with our data at both time periods.
Across the 7-year time period, snag density declined by 90% on
our sites on the Rodeo–Chediski Fire, compared with an 80%
decrease on fires studied by Passovoy and Fule´ (2006) and a
50% decrease on the study sites of Roccaforte et al. (2012).
Again, the differences in fall rates may be a result of the tree size,
as Roccaforte et al. (2012) had sites with generally larger-
diameter trees. This shows that fall rates across study sites are
fairly similar, though highest in our study. These fall rates are
also higher than those discussed by Chambers and Mast (2005),
who showed a 41% decline in snags 7 years after a fire.
Trends in basal area and stand density varied in each study,
but tended to be very low across all burned sites. Overall, basal
area was very low on all study sites, with the only increase over
the study period seen on the sites of Roccaforte et al. (2012). One
to two years post-fire, mean basal area was 0.6 m2 ha1, whereas
7–11 years post-fire, mean basal area was 2.7 m2 ha1. In
comparison, our untreated sites on the Rodeo–Chediski Fire
had a mean basal area of 3.0 m2 ha1 in 2004, and 2.9 m2 ha1 in
2011, and thus were statistically unchanged over this time period
and similar to basal areas from the sites of Stevens-Rumann
et al. (2012), with basal areas of 2.5 m2 ha1 10 years post-fire.
Passovoy and Fule´ (2006) did not provide basal areas, but
presented high stand densities (370.4 trees ha1) on the fire that
occurred 3 years before sampling, with significantly lower
densities in older fires (81.5 trees ha1). We observed stand

Comparison among studies
Data were averaged across the fires within the specified time frame within each fire. 1–3 year data from Passovoy and Fule´ (2006) are from 3 years after a
wildfire and Roccaforte et al. (2012) present data from 1–2 years after wildfires. 7–11 year data from Passovoy and Fule´ (2006) are from 8–9 years after wildfire
and Roccaforte et al. (2012) have data from 7–11 years after fires. FWD, fine woody debris; CWD, coarse woody debris

densities of only 61.3 trees ha1 in 2004, which increased by
2011 to just under 400 trees ha1, which was consistent with
increases observed by Roccaforte et al. (2012). Yet, in spite of
the increases in stand densities in our study over the study
period, the changes were not significant and were not substantial
enough to change basal area at this time period. The changes in
basal area observed by Roccaforte et al. (2012) are likely an
artefact of sampling different fires or more prolific regeneration,
rather than an observed trend of decreasing densities over the
study period. Once again, these differences are due more to
specific site conditions (even within a single fire), sporadic
regeneration, pre-fire stand densities and fire severity and less to
do with time since fire.
This comparison between chronosequences and repeated-
measures studies illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of both
types of studies, but also confirms that our study sites are similar
to fires across ponderosa pine forests of the South-west. Estab-
lishing a baseline density and basal area for chronosequence
studies is essential, as it will greatly affect the amount of tree
survival, snag densities and ultimately differing surface fuel
loadings over this time period, thus the accuracy of inferences
from one burned area to another. We also advocate repeated-
measures studies on existing plots whenever possible.
Meeting management goals
To address our fourth question, we assessed how post-fire fuel
complexes met forest structure and wildlife habitat goals 9 years
after wildfire. We compared post-wildfire fuel loads with
acceptable ranges for management, as outlined in several sci-
entific studies and National Forest guidelines.
To understand the implications of our CWD loadings, we
compared our data with the ‘optimum’ CWD suggested by
Brown et al. (2003). This ‘optimum’ range is a combination of
the CWD needed for wildlife and understorey productivity,
without presenting excessive fire hazard and soil heating poten-
tial (Brown et al. 2003), building on the management recom-
mendations set forth by Graham et al. (1994). Unlike Roccaforte
et al. (2012) and Fule´ et al. (2002), we found that none of the
sites exceeded the upper limit of 11.2–44.8 Mg ha1, and in fact
several treated sites fell below the minimum of the target range.
The lower CWD loadings (30.2 Mg ha1 on untreated sites) may
be due in part to post-fire firewood-cutting by the public as well
as contract tree removal for fuel reduction that occurred on some
sites since 2004. However, removing those plots and sites that
we know experienced contract cutting only raised the mean
CWD loading to 32.8 Mg ha1. Although we did not study the
fuels spatial arrangement, overall CWD loadings do not appear
to exceed recommended levels currently on treated or untreated
sites. Because we do not expect CWD to continue to increase,
owing to the minimal number of snags remaining, sites will not
exceed the ‘optimum’ range in the future and may not be a
source of concern for managers on either the treated or untreated
sites. We did not measure live fuel biomass, but Shive et al.
(2013a) reported total understorey percentage cover (regenerat-
ing trees, shrubs, forbs and graminoids). Total understorey cover
averaged 18% in the untreated areas and 9% in the treated areas
in 2011, suggesting live understorey species are unlikely to
contribute substantially to fire spread.
To understand how the fire and thinning treatment affected
the resulting live overstorey, we established thresholds for
maximum basal area and tree density using similar methods to
Stevens-Rumann et al. (2012). A basal area range of 9.2 and
18.4 m2 ha1 and tree density range of 140 and 250 trees ha1
for ponderosa pine forests in the south-western US were based
on historical norms for the region, as well as fuels reduction
targets outlined by studies in this area of the US (Fule´ et al.
1997, 2002). In 2011, treated sites fell within this basal area
range, but untreated sites fell below the target range (Fig. 3b).
This illustrates that the treatments increased tree survival post-
fire, whereas untreated sites were well below the minimum
target basal area owing to high tree mortality. However, stand
densities on both treated and untreated sites were within the
target range.
Snags provide ecosystem functions as habitat for cavity-
nesting birds and other wildlife (Bull et al. 1997); thus, we
examined the densities of larger-diameter snags because those
are often considered of most value. We examined quantities of
ponderosa pine snags .40-cm DBH, as this is the minimum
snag size desired for many National Forests in the region
(Kaibab National Forest Plan 1986, see http://www.fs.usda.
gov/main/kaibab/landmanagement/planning/,
accessed
25
May 2012; Apache–Sitgreaves National Forest Plan 1987, see
http://www.fs.usda.gov/main/asnf/landmanagement/planning/
accessed 28 June 2012). The higher mean snag density on the
untreated sites is unsurprising given that they also experienced a
higher rate of tree mortality. The low mean snag density on
treated sites may illustrate how pre-wildfire treatments can be a
trade-off between conflicting resource-management objectives.
Such treatments are beneficial in creating fire-resilient forests,
yet they can be also detrimental, if thinning prescriptions result
in fewer snags that are valued for wildlife (Stephens and
Moghaddas 2005; McIver et al. 2013). The observed large snags
were primarily ponderosa pine, with several Gambel oak and
alligator juniper (Juniperus deppeana) and occurred on only a
few plots. A total of 84% of the treated plots and 80% of the
untreated plots lacked snags .40-cm DBH, meaning, overall,
few large snags existed across sites. The average large-snag
density met the desired density of ,5 snags ha1 on untreated
sites but fell below this density on treated sites (Apache–
Sitgreaves National Forest Plan 1987; Fig. 4c).
Pre-wildfire thinning and pile-burning treatments decreased
fuel loading and increased tree survival compared with untreated
areas 9 years post-wildfire. These trends persisted and the
differences between treated and untreated areas were more
prevalent over time. Treatments such as these can ultimately
change the stand trajectory after a large wildfire. Given that
most forests of the south-western US are at high risk of severe
crown fire (Fiedler et al. 2002; Schmidt et al. 2002), extensive
fuel reduction treatments are needed to reduce the potential for
high-severity fires. We have illustrated, as have many other
studies across the western US, that pre-wildfire fuels treat-
ments can result in reduced fire severity and long-term differ-
ences in stand recovery. Even in the face of extreme fire events
that occur during severe fire weather conditions, like the
Rodeo–Chediski
Fire

recent
fires
like

C. Stevens-Rumann et al.

(Williams et al. 2010), there is evidence that pre-wildfire fuels
treatments help maintain forest structure and reduce future
surface fuel loadings compared with untreated sites.
