Abstract
We examined age structure and spatial arrangement of pin˜on–juniper woodlands and savannas on six plots distributed across
three different soil types in northern Arizona. These stands, as typical of many others in pin˜on–juniper ecosystems, have
experienced increases in tree densities since the arrival of European settlers. The goal of this study was to reconstruct stand
conditions in 1860, prior to livestock grazing, using stem-mapping to determine tree arrangement and tree-ring analysis to
examine age structure and density. Ripley’s K(t), Ripley’s K12(t), and Moran’s I were used to analyze nearest neighbor distances,
spatial association, and spatial autocorrelation, respectively. All sites have long term presence of juniper and pin˜on trees, with a
pulse of establishment and survival occurring between 1860 and 1880 on basalt- and sandstone-derived soils. In contrast,
limestone-derived soil had no pulse of tree establishment in 1860, but rather a steady increase in tree establishment since ca.
1700. Spatial arrangement of juniper trees in 1860 showed strong clumping patterns from a minimum distance of 15 m to all
spatial scales. Pin˜on pine varied in spatial arrangement from clumping at all spatial scales to random at all spatial scales. Positive
spatial autocorrelation was determined for age of juniper trees to a minimum distance of 21 m in current stand conditions, in
contrast to no strong trends of spatial autocorrelation in 1860. By comparing the age structure and spatial results for the forest
reconstruction of 1860 to current conditions, we were able to show variation among soil types in nurse tree association between
pin˜on and juniper trees and unable to support the density dependent mortality hypothesis for these sites. Presettlement (1860)
diameter distributions and basal areas can be used to develop structure control (BDq) prescriptions unique to each soil type to
restore either savanna or woodlands condition. However, identifying one blanket prescription for tree reduction in pin˜on–juniper
ecosystems of the southwestern United States, or even the Anderson Mesa landscape, would reduce the range of variability
present in the form of woodlands and savannas.

1. Introduction
The rapid rates of change in tree density and extent
over
the
past
century
in
many
pin˜on–juniper
ecosystems are often credited to the anthropogenic
inﬂuence of livestock grazing and ﬁre suppression
(Cottam and Stewart, 1940; Blackburn and Tueller,
1970; Burkhardt and Tisdale, 1976; Tausch et al.,
1981; Gottfried et al., 1995). Although not all areas
have experienced increased tree density (Ffolliott and
Gottfried, 2002) the large areas that have increased in
density have caused concern for many ecologists and
managers since pin˜on–juniper ecosystems cover a
signiﬁcant land mass in the western United States,
estimated at nearly 30 million hectares (West, 1999a).
In addition, this increase in tree density and extent has
led to many undesirable effects: an increase in rates of
soil erosion (Carrara and Carroll, 1979; Price, 1993), a
decrease in understory herbaceous cover and diversity
available for forage (Pieper, 1990; Tausch and West,
1995), a change in hydrological processes (Wilcox,
1994; Baker et al., 1995), and in some regions an
alteration of the ﬁre regime due to a change in fuel
structure (West, 1999b; Miller and Tausch, 2001).
The typical response to these changes in pin˜on and
juniper tree densities has been wholesale removal of
the trees from the landscape (Arnold et al., 1964; Clary
et al., 1974; Tausch and Tueller, 1977). This causes
further major disruption to the system and eliminates
the trees, which provide microhabitat for a variety of
plant species, cover for wildlife, and nesting for birds;
therefore, it is not an appropriate treatment for all
areas that have experienced increased canopy cover.
More recently, treatments are being implemented that
restore a certain density of trees thought to be
consistent with presettlement conditions (Jacobs and
Gatewood, 1999; Brockway et al., 2002; Jacobs and
Gatewood, 2002). All too often, however, we have
only a vague understanding of those conditions.
Reconstructing stand age structure provides a
reference point to guide treatments and long-term
management of forested systems that have been
altered by anthropogenic means (Foster et al., 1996).
Information
from
historic
age
distributions
can
support inferences pertaining to temporal patterns
of tree establishment, regeneration patterns, and
disturbance histories of presettlement forests (Lor-
imer, 1977; Mast et al., 1999; Bailey and Covington,
2002). Age structure can be extended when dead trees
are included in the analysis (Johnson et al., 1994; Mast
et al., 1999). Incorporating the age of presettlement
trees with their spatial location allows for inferences
concerning potential changes of spatial patterns in
forests over a given period of time (Frelich and
Graumlich, 1994; Antos and Parish, 2002).
Although reconstruction of ﬁre occurrences on
Anderson Mesa is beyond the scope of this study of
forest structure it is important to recognize the
potential variability of ﬁre. Floyd et al. (2000) found
a ﬁre return interval of 400 years, characterized by
stand-replacing ﬁres in the pin˜on–juniper woodlands
at Mesa Verde National Park, Colorado, USA, by
constructing time since ﬁre maps. These long ﬁre
intervals are driven partially because of rocky soil and
highly dissected topography. Another study on the
Colorado Plateau determined the ﬁre return interval in
a Juniperus osteosperma/Pinus edulis stand to be
approximately 25 years (Despain and Mosely, 1990).
A recent review of all the literature pertaining to ﬁre in
pin˜on–juniper concluded little to no evidence exists
documenting a low intensity, surface ﬁre regime
(Baker and Shinneman, 2004). However, Romme et al.
(2003) hypothesized that a wide range of disturbance
regimes are possible in the pin˜on–juniper ecosystems
of the Colorado Plateau, but that much research is
needed to identify distinguishing characteristics of
different ﬁre frequencies. Because of a wide range of
possible ﬁre regimes across the landscape it is
important to consider other potential indicators of
ﬁre regime frequency, such as topography, soil type,
and change in forest structure (Romme et al., 2003).
When determining historic forest structure, it is
also essential to examine the variation in vegetation
types that are controlled by soil inﬂuences. The pattern
of woody plants and grass distribution is highly
inﬂuenced by the topography and edaphic features of
the landscape (Archer, 1994). Throughout the south-
western United States, pin˜on–juniper woodlands are
diverse, containing assemblages of various species of
pin˜on and juniper trees. According to Moir and
Carleton (1987), pin˜on–juniper woodlands of the
Southwest feature 70 plant associations and upwards
of 280 ecosystem types. Work by Thatcher and Hart
(1974) in a pin˜on–juniper relict site shows a link
between grass or tree cover and corresponding soil
types.

Forest reconstruction to establish reference condi-
tions for pin˜on–juniper ecosystems is a critical part of
the restoration process. Our study began this process
by reconstructing age structure and spatial arrange-
ment of pin˜on–juniper woodlands and savannas of
Anderson Mesa prior to 1860, the estimated time of
arrival of livestock (Carlock, 1994). We assessed
changes and patterns in age structure and spatial

arrangement across three different soil types. Pre-
scriptions can be developed from this information that
are essential to scientiﬁcally-based restoration treat-
ments and long-term management.
2. Methods
2.1. Study area

areas
are
located
on
Anderson
Mesa, approximately 150 km southeast of Flagstaff,
Arizona (Fig. 1). We chose three different soil types

material
types
on
Anderson Mesa (Taylor, 1983) (Table 1). One plot
is located on private property owned by the Flying M
Ranch, a member of the Diablo Trust Collaborative
Land Management group, and the other two soil types
are located on Arizona State Trust Land, just below the
rim of Anderson Mesa. All sites were chosen for
reconstruction in part because their remote locations
have resulted in little to no previous fuel wood
harvesting, indicated by a lack of stumps from cut
trees. Choosing sites undisturbed by human wood
harvesting ensured that evidence from presettlement
woodlands was not missing, allowing for a complete
reconstruction of these tree populations Fig. 2.
2.2. Field data collection
In 2001 and 2002 we randomly chose two plots
within each soil type in which to reconstruct age
structure and spatial arrangement. At each soil type,
one of the plots was 1.56 ha (125 m  125 m) and the
other plot was 0.78 ha (125 m  62.5 m). According
to Despain (1989), to accurately date juniper trees it is
best to take a cross-section of the stem for examination
due to the fact that Utah juniper trees do not grow
concentrically and produce many lobes and stems. All
juniper and pin˜on trees were felled with chainsaws,
and a 3–10 cm wide disc was cut from the bole as close
to the ground as conditions safely allowed (Tausch and
West, 1988). We originally planned to core pin˜on trees
since they can be readily cross-dated, however, an Ips
pini outbreak killed the majority of the pin˜ons and thus
we decided to fell the trees to obtain a reliable pith
date. Juniper and pin˜on seedlings and small saplings
were cut using lopping shears as close to the ground as
possible. In areas with abundant pin˜on seedlings the
trees were surveyed and automatically placed in
the ﬁrst 20-year age class. All tree diameters were
measured at root collar to the nearest half centimeter;
crown radii and tree height were measured on a
subsample of trees to the nearest tenth meter.
All trees, living and dead, in the plots were mapped
using a Criterion Laser mounted on a tripod (Laser
Technology, 1997). The southwest corner of the plot
was the starting station for mapping. All distances
were recorded to the nearest half centimeter, and all
the azimuths were recorded to the nearest minute.
Distance and azimuth measurements were converted
to a Cartesian coordinate system for analysis.
2.3. Laboratory techniques
All pin˜on and juniper discs were returned to the lab
for processing. They were sanded with progressively
ﬁner grits of sandpaper. We counted rings for each
juniper tree cross-section using a binocular micro-
scope. Great effort was made to avoid counting false
rings by counting on the radius of the cross-section
that exhibited the most uniform growth characteristics
(Tausch and West, 1988); however, juniper samples
could not be cross-dated to identify missing rings due
to limitations of time, cost, and difﬁculty (Gottfried
et al., 1995). Pin˜on pine samples were visually cross-
dated, using standard methods (Stokes and Smiley,
1968). After determining ages, trees were placed in

twenty-year age classes for analysis. To reconstruct
tree diameter of specimens established before 1860,
their diameters were measured inside the bark at
the ring that represented the year 1860 on all trees
from the 62.5 m  125 m plots. Using the regression
relationship between the outside diameter and the
inside diameter we were able to predict the inside
diameters for trees on the larger plots (125 m
 125 m). To aid in tree reconstruction, we developed
a bark thickness equation speciﬁc to each soil type for
both tree species by measuring bark thickness on a
random distribution of diameter classes in order to
regress the two variables, bark thickness and diameter
at root collar (r2 = 0.73, 0.85, 0.92 for limestone,
basalt, and sandstone-derived soils, respectively).
Canopy cover as a percent of total plot size was
estimated from crown diameter for all soil types in
1860 and 2002. Since juniper trees tend to grow in
clumps we assumed 20% canopy overlap for all sites.
2.4. Statistical analysis
We analyzed pin˜on and juniper spatial patterns
using Ripley’s K(t) and Ripley’s K12(t) and measured
pin˜on and juniper tree spatial autocorrelation using
Moran’s I, for both the 2002 and 1860 stands (Ripley,
1981). Dead juniper trees that contained at least 140
rings were assumed to be alive in the analysis of 1860

spatial arrangement. Analyses were performed using
Duncan’s spatial software (Duncan, 1990). We did all
tests using increasing step size of 1 m (t) for up to a 31
or 62 m distance for each stem. These distances
are half the length of the shortest side of the plot and
were used to reduce the error induced by edge effect
(Boots and Getis, 1988). The remaining edge effect
was adjusted through the use of a toroidal correction
factor.

location
and
association,
respectively are graphed by plotting the derived
sample statistic L(t) and L12(t), (Haase, 1995; Wells
and Getis, 1999). Positive values that appear above the
upper conﬁdence interval represent plants arranged in
clumps or that two species are aggregated; negative
values that appear below the lower conﬁdence interval
represent regularly dispersed plants or that the two
species are segregated (Skarpe, 1991). We calculated
Moran’s I for tree age (years) and tree size (diameter at
root collar) and plotted the results as standard normal
deviates, z(d), for each distance class (t) at a
signiﬁcance level of 0.05 (Friedman et al., 2001).
Signiﬁcant positive and negative spatial autocorrela-
tion occur when the standard normal deviate is above
or below 1.96 and 1.96, respectively (Duncan and
Stewart, 1991). Positive spatial autocorrelation occurs
when trees at a distance of t are similar in age or size
and negative spatial autocorrelation when trees at a
distance of t are dissimilar in age or size.
3. Results
3.1. Age structure and density
Under current conditions, Utah juniper was the
dominant tree species at each site, occupying 89–
99.5% of the basal area (Table 2). Total current tree
density on basalt and limestone-derived soils are equal
and more than twice as high as tree densities on
sandstone-derived soil. The highest basal area and
canopy cover is currently found on limestone-derived
soil (Table 2). Historical stand structure varied among
soil types with tree densities approximately equal on
basalt-
and
sandstone-derived
soils.

derived soil contained average densities that were
twice as high as the other stands.
Starting in the 20-year period between 1860
and 1880, there is a distinct pulse in the establishment
and survival of Utah juniper trees on both the
sandstone- and basalt-derived soils that has continued
at high levels until the present (Fig. 3). These stands
showed low levels of continuous Utah juniper tree
establishment and survival over the past several
hundred years, then a marked increase after 1860. The
oldest evidence of juniper trees at these sites
established ca. 1494 and 1405 for basalt- and
sandstone-derived soil, respectively. The age structure
of the stand located on limestone-derived soil differed
from the others, showing a marked increase in trees
starting 300 years ago (Fig. 3). A steady increase of
tree establishment at this site continued to the present.
The oldest juniper tree on this soil type dated to
approximately 1411.
In contrast to juniper trees, establishment of pin˜on
pine occurred at different rates across various soil
types. Pin˜on pine trees at all sites were not as long
lived as juniper trees with the oldest pin˜on evidence
establishing in 1645 on basalt-derived soil, 1751 on
sandstone-derived soil, and 1549 on limestone-derived
soil. Basalt- and limestone-derived soils both showed
establishment of pin˜on pine for at least the past 300
years (Fig. 3). Trees on both soil types showed an
increase in density occurring around the start of
livestock grazing approximately 140 years ago, as
compared to the prior decades. The highest rates of
pin˜on pine establishment started in the period between
1940 and1960. Pin˜on pines growing on sandstone-
derived soil were present in the stand at extremely low
numbers and showed no clear trend (Fig. 3).
Skeletons of dead trees, both pin˜on and juniper,
were scattered throughout all plots. Dead evidences,
either still standing or lying on the ground, ranged
from 2–37 stems/ha for juniper trees and 0–14 stems/
ha for pin˜on pine based on our plots (Table 2). None of
these dead evidences were those created by Ips pini
infestation. Sandstone-derived soil showed the highest
level of dead juniper trees, comprising 3–10% of the
total juniper trees with an average drc of 35.0 cm. The
highest densities of dead pin˜on pine were on lime-
stone-derived soils, comprising 4.4–6% of the total
pin˜on trees/ha, with an average drc of 8 cm (Table 2).
The range of drc for dead juniper trees across all sites

classes.

was 0.25–110.5 cm and for pin˜on the size range was
0.5–32.5 cm.
3.2. Spatial arrangement
Examination of tree arrangement in 1860 indicated
clumping for juniper trees at all spatial scales on
basalt- and sandstone-derived soils (Fig. 4). On
limestone soil, spatial arrangement of juniper trees
was clumped up to distances of 13–45 m and random
at larger distances. Ripley’s K(t) statistical assessment
of presettlement pin˜on pine on all soil types in 1860
was not feasible because of too few trees for analysis.
Utah juniper trees on all three soil types currently
displayed clumped distributions at all spatial scales as
did pin˜on pine arrangement on basalt-derived soil
(Fig. 4). In contrast, pin˜on pines found on sandstone-
derived soil were randomly distributed at all scales.
Limestone-derived soil represented an intermediate
pattern between random and clumped, with clumping
at distances of 10–40 m and random distributions at
greater scales.
Ripley’s K12(t) was used to compare the spatial
association of pin˜on trees versus juniper trees at two of
the sites. Analysis was limited on sandstone-derived
soil because of too few pin˜on trees. The 1860
associations were characterized by a positive relation-
ship at distances of 4–10 m for both basalt- and
limestone-derived soils (Fig. 5). Current pin˜on and
juniper trees on the basalt-derived soils showed
positive association up to a distance of 38 m and
random association at greater distances (Fig. 5). One
plot on limestone-derived soil displayed positive
association between the current pin˜on and juniper
trees up to distances of 10 m.
In 1860 there were only a few instances of positive
spatial autocorrelation for Utah juniper ages at small
distance classes (<10 m) (Fig. 6). Beyond these
occurrences, the analysis of presettlement arrange-
ment indicated largely random associations for both
pin˜on and juniper trees.

the current spatial arrangement of trees and the right column is the 1860 spatial arrangement of trees. Dashed lines are the upper and lower
conﬁdence intervals and the solid line represents L(t).

Current Utah juniper tree ages were positively
spatially autocorrelated on all three 1.56 ha plots up to
a minimum distance of 21 m (Fig. 6). Using diameter
to determine the level of autocorrelation for juniper
trees indicated the same pattern of development as age
only on limestone-derived soils; other soil types
exhibited no distinct pattern. For pin˜on pine, Moran’s I
showed positive spatial autocorrelation of tree ages on
basalt-derived soil consistently at distances of <4 m,
with an intermixing of positive and random auto-
correlation at larger distances (Fig. 6). Pin˜on pine on
the other soil types did not show consistent positive
spatial autocorrelation.
4. Discussion
In our reconstruction of past forest structure we
used dead material to help assess presettlement
densities
and
arrangement
in
juniper;
however,
because of difﬁculty in cross-dating juniper trees,
we were not able to obtain an extended juniper age
structure.
Another
difﬁculty
in
the
process
of
assessing the establishment date of juniper trees
was the presence of Phellinus texanus Murr. rot
(Gilbertson and Lindsey, 1975). This rot tended to
affect older and larger trees within our study areas
with only 6.25–21% of total trees affected younger
than 140 years. This ensured that the identiﬁed
regeneration pulses since settlement were mostly
unaffected by rot, with the vast majority having center
dates. Although not all trees dated to establishment,
due to either death or rot, we were able to obtain
accurate spatial locations at the time of European
settlement. It is important to note that our age structure
diagrams should not be used to deduce multiple-
century patterns of regeneration, because there are
gaps created in this presettlement structure that could
be caused by trees lacking pith and dead wood and
because of the potential for missing cohorts of smaller
trees (Johnson et al., 1994).
4.1. Age structure and density
Tausch et al. (1981) determined that the highest
level of juniper species establishment throughout the
Great Basin occurred from 1870–1920, the period
most impacted by European settlers. The results from
our study agreed with those ﬁndings, with a large pulse
of establishment increasing tree density across all soil
types as compared to 1860 densities. Sites character-
ized by Tausch et al. (1981) were dominated by pin˜on;
in contrast, all of our study sites were clearly
dominated by juniper in both number of trees/ha
and in amount of basal area each species comprised.
Although their data is from the Great Basin it reﬂects
the widespread nature of increasing tree numbers at
the time settlers arrived in the western U.S. In both
studies it is difﬁcult to determine the exact density of
historical trees because it is impossible to reconstruct

seedlings and saplings. Typically they occur in high
densities and experience higher rates of mortality and
decay. However, the occurrence of a pulse indicates that
ecosystem dynamics changed from previous times to
allow for greater numbers of trees to survive into older
age classes. Although the role and frequency of ﬁre is
uncertain, it is known that livestock entered the area
concurrently with the pulses, suggesting that grazing
reduced grasses’ ability to compete with the trees.
West (1999a) claimed that many pin˜on–juniper
areas throughout the Intermountain West formerly
were savanna systems and that many fewer woodlands
existed. He deﬁned savannas as grass-dominated
ecosystems that have a woody overstory with a
continuous grass understory and woodlands as tree
dominated
systems
with
a
discontinuous
grass
understory. Other savanna ecosystems (non pin˜on–
juniper) deﬁne the parameters more narrowly, with

savannas containing 5–30% canopy cover, woodlands
containing 30–80% canopy cover, and all cover
greater than 80% as forest (Heidorn, 1994). However,
in pin˜on–juniper ecosystems Milne et al. (1996)
determined the critical value of tree cover of 59.3% at
which woodlands change abruptly from a fragmented
collection of small patches of trees to a network of
connected canopies. For pin˜on–juniper ecosystems,
therefore, a more appropriate range for woodland
canopy cover in the Southwest might be from 30–
60%. In 1860, canopy covers on all soil types from our
study fell into the savanna category, ranging on
average from 4.5% on basalt-derived to 11.5% on
sandstone-derived soil, and 14.7% on limestone-
derived
soil.
However,
by
2002
canopy
cover
increased so that all sites had neared or crossed the
threshold into woodland—basalt-derived soil with
canopy cover of 29.9%, sandstone with 33.8%, and
limestone-derived with 44.3%. None of these stands,
currently or historically, represent pin˜on–juniper
forest conditions, conﬁrmed by the classiﬁcation of
Romme et al. (2003), which asserts that pin˜on–juniper
forests typically have not experienced a change in tree
density since the time of settlement. Additionally,
none of the sites have extremely rocky soil nor is the
topography such that would prevent the spread of ﬁre,
another potential indicator of pin˜on–juniper forest
(Romme et al., 2003).
Although all 1860 stands ﬁt the savanna category
according
to
canopy
cover,
tree
densities
and
clumping patterns place them differently on the
gradient between savanna and woodland. In 1860,
the limestone-derived soil had twice the tree density of
other plots and also smaller, more evenly distributed
clumps than other plots as demonstrated by clumping
from 13–45 m in 1860. These characteristics identify
the limestone-derived soil sites as being closer to the
woodland end of the gradient before settlement, which
had a less contiguous understory (Romme et al.,
2003). In contrast the basalt- and sandstone-derived
soils
averaged
110
and
122 trees/ha
in
1860,
respectively, which were found in larger clumps
located on a smaller portion of the plot as demon-
strated by clumping at all spatial scales in 1860.
Theoretically, the lower tree densities found in clumps
of greater size allowed for a much larger and more
contiguous grass community, more indicative of a
savanna-like system.
Disturbance history, in addition to edaphic features,
is an important factor in controlling stand structure in
the pin˜on–juniper ecosystem (Romme et al., 2003).
The primary natural disturbance factors affecting tree
densities in savanna ecosystems are ﬁre, drought, and
herbivory (van Langevelde et al., 2003). Large
quantities of dead material, as a percent of the total
trees, located on sandstone-derived soil type could
have been indicative of more recent disturbance(s),
either drought or ﬁre. However, this soil type was the
only one containing evidence of ﬁre scars on juniper
trees (personal observation). This perhaps implies that
ﬁre is a factor in conjunction with edaphic features, in
maintaining stand structure in pin˜on–juniper ecosys-
tems on Anderson Mesa (Miller and Tausch, 2001).
4.2. Spatial arrangement
On basalt- and sandstone-derived soils, juniper
trees were clumped at all scales, both historically and
currently, indicating the presence of very large clumps
in 1860 that are still evident on stands today. On
limestone-derived soil, the change from random at
larger scales in 1860 to the current clumping at all
spatial scales indicated that this site was comprised of
smaller sized clumps, and through time, encroaching
trees ﬁlled in the interspaces, causing clumps to reach
maximum spatial scales. This differed from the
ﬁndings of Martens et al. (1997), which showed
current Utah juniper clumped at a scale of 2–5 m,
indicating very small clumps of trees.
Current pin˜on pine varied in its pattern of spatial
distribution and, due to limited sample size, little was
determined about 1860 spatial arrangements. How-
ever, the lack of pin˜on pine in these plots, especially
the sandstone-derived plots, indicated that pin˜on pine
had more recently become an increasingly important
part of the structure at these sites.
Physiological characteristics of juniper trees, such
as drought tolerance and ability to obtain water from
shallow soil, allow them to establish in harsh
interspaces in pin˜on–juniper ecosystems (Nowak et
al., 1999). In comparison, pin˜on pine is typically more
highly dependent on microhabitat created by a nurse
plant and will rarely establish in interspaces (Callaway
et al., 1996). Microclimate provided by nurse plants
signiﬁcantly
reduces
temperature
and
increases
moisture, which can allow for successful pin˜on

231

seedling establishment. Padien and Lajtha (1992)
determined that pin˜on seedlings showed a trend
toward a more positive association with established
juniper canopies.
Trees on basalt-derived soils best followed this
nurse tree theory of establishment. Currently trees of
both species were clumped, and there was positive
association between species, indicating that pin˜on and
juniper trees could be found growing together in
clumps up to distances of 27 m. Nurse tree coloniza-
tion was consistent with the Morans I analyses, which
showed a shift from no autocorrelation in 1860 to
positive autocorrelation with age of both pin˜on and
juniper trees in current stand arrangement. This
indicated that recently established trees were growing
in clumps of similarly aged trees. This hypothesis was
further supported by the age structure. A large pulse of
pin˜on pine established during the past 60 years; these
pin˜on trees appeared to be responding to the pulse of
juniper trees that started post-1860. Juniper trees were
able to colonize open spaces in the community, and
after a lag time of approximately 60–80 years became
large enough to alter the microclimate beneath their
canopy. As a result, starting approximately 60–80
years ago, pin˜on trees had larger amounts of growing
space available for establishment and thus could more
rapidly colonize the site.
According to these principles it would seem logical
that the stand on sandstone-derived soil should have
large amounts of younger pin˜on pine responding to the
pulse of post-1860 juniper, and the growing space it
provided, but it did not. These plots had only a total of
14–25 pin˜on trees/ha. The lack of pin˜on pine could be
attributed to the level of erodability of this soil type,
which was greatest among the three series (Table 1) and
could be detrimental the to establishment of pin˜on pine.
Limestone-derived soil type differed from the
others in the long-term occupation of the site by both
pin˜on and juniper trees. The dynamics seemed to
represent increasing tree density in a woodland, not
colonization of the grass understory in a pin˜on–juniper
savanna. In contrast to the other stands, substantial
microsite under juniper trees had long been available
for
pin˜on
trees
to
use
for
establishment.
The
colonization of these microsites was evident by the
large number of older pin˜on trees and the positive
association found historically between the pin˜on and
juniper trees.
5. Management implications and strategies
One goal of restoring pin˜on–juniper ecosystems is
to prevent the occurrence of irreversible changes so
that they do not cross thresholds that would lead to
trajectories outside their natural range of variability
(Laycock, 1991; SER, 2002). It is essential to develop
reference conditions to do this properly (White and
Walker, 1997; Stephenson, 1999). This study shows
that forest reconstruction is necessary at various
locations throughout the landscape, such as various
soil types, aspects, elevations, and topography, in
order to capture the heterogeneity in stand structure
typically represented by a gradient ranging from
savanna to woodland. Identifying a blanket prescrip-
tion for pin˜on–juniper ecosystems of the southwestern
United States or even the Anderson Mesa landscape
would reduce the range of variability present in the
form of woodlands and savannas.
Restoration of the structure in pin˜on–juniper
ecosystems on the Anderson Mesa landscape ﬁrst
will require thinning, primarily of juniper trees,
regardless of whether the site was formerly savanna
or woodland. However, not all trees establishing after
1860 should be removed. A component of younger
trees needs to be retained to match the uneven-aged
distribution of presettlement pin˜on–juniper ecosys-
tems, which showed few gaps in establishment across
multiple centuries.
Selection silviculture is a valuable tool for meeting
uneven-aged forest objectives, which prioritize long-
term forest cover, biodiversity, and sustainability
(O’Hara, 1998). Structure control is one method of
uneven-aged management, based on a BDq: basal
area, maximum diameter, and q-ratio, that achieves a
sustainable distribution of ages/sizes (Nyland, 1996).
The q-factor produces a reverse J-shaped distribution
because it is the ratio of trees in a diameter class to
number of trees in the next largest diameter class; as
diameter classes get smaller, number of trees increases
(Bailey and Covington, 2002). The ultimate goal of
using a BDq or any of several other approaches is
simply to regulate standing tree density distributions.
This management technique can be used to meet any
objectives (e.g., wildlife habitat) where speciﬁc
structural goals are required.
The overarching landowner goal that prompted this
research was to restore presettlement structure to

232

pin˜on–juniper woodlands and savannas. The plan for
executing restoration treatments will be based on
multi-aged group-selection siliviculture and, speciﬁ-
cally, a BDq that mimics the reverse-J-shapes of
juniper diameter distributions in 1860. BDq equations
were developed for juniper trees at all three soil types
due to the variation in site productivity and stand
dynamics (Fig. 7). Equations were only developed for

juniper trees because they comprise the vast majority
of basal area and encroachment in the treatment areas
of Anderson Mesa.
Maximum diameter usually represents the size at
which trees are harvested, but in this management
setting trees over the maximum diameter (100 cm)
are not considered for harvest because of their value in
the ecosystem. The basal area of trees >100 cm
was subtracted from the basal area of trees establish-
ing before 1860. The q-factor was developed to ﬁt as
closely as possible the diameter distribution of
trees present in 1860. A BDq was developed ﬁrst
by using the whole plots (125 m  125 m) that had
predicted diameters for the 1860 distribution. The
determined BDq was then veriﬁed by plotting it on the
half plot (62.5 m  25 m) that had actual diameters
from 1860. The ﬁt was then adjusted to better fulﬁl
diameter distributions of both plots within each soil
type.
BDq’s of 10-100-1.5 for basalt-derived soil, 20-
100-1.25 for sandstone-derived soil, and 30-100-1.4
for limestone-derived soil using 10 cm diameter
classes were determined to be the closest approxima-
tion to structural conditions in 1860 (Fig. 7) from the
half plots. The full sized plots in 1860 in all cases had
higher levels of basal area than the half plots. The q-
factor was developed by ﬁtting the curve between the
two data sets. Land managers can use their best
judgment as to what conditions were historically
appropriate for the stands that they manage, or
determine a desired future structure, and choose a BDq
that best meets these objectives. Most importantly,
managers should vary intensity of thinning treatments
across the landscape to account for variation in
presettlement trees/ha due to changes in soil type,
aspect, and elevation and to mimic spatial patterns.
In addition to thinning, ﬁre has often been used as
an important tool for restoring ecological function to
woodland and Savanna ecosystems (Covington et al.,
1997; Peterson and Reich, 2001). However, caution
should be exercised if ﬁre is to be used as a tool for
restoration work in pin˜on–juniper ecosystems, espe-
cially concerning the frequency of ﬁre use, because the
role of ﬁre is poorly understood throughout the
Intermountain West (Baker and Shinneman, 2004);
what
is
known
indicates
considerable
variation
throughout the range of pin˜on–juniper ecosystems
(Miller and Tausch, 2001). Although West (1999a)
claimed that many areas throughout the Intermountain
West were formerly savannas, and our sites conform to
this classiﬁcation, many areas were also pin˜on–juniper
forests, which have not experienced change in tree
densities and are not in need of restoration through
thinning and burning (Romme et al., 2003). This
emphasizes the importance of assessing site speciﬁc
changes in stand structure and ﬁre history for best
restoration results. Understanding changes, if any, in
presettlement forest structure, as well as landscape
characteristics (topography, soils, etc.), can perhaps be
an initial step in understanding the potential role and
frequency of ﬁre in pin˜on–juniper ecosystems and
determining if ﬁre is an appropriate tool to use in
restoration (Romme et al., 2003).
We chose the date of 1860 for our reconstruction
because it provides the best, latest evidence of pin˜on–
juniper stands on a natural evolutionary trajectory. Our
goal in reconstructing and restoring pin˜on–juniper
ecosystems was not to reverse time, because clearly
we live in a dynamic world that includes dramatic
climate ﬂuctuations. Our goal, rather, was to identify
and understand a time period when healthier, more
intact, functioning ecosystems dominated the South-
west landscape, a goal that is tangible and can be
informed by ecological evidence. Using this time
period to guide management and treatments should
promote the ‘health’ of pin˜on–juniper ecosystems so
they can better respond to current and pending
environmental changes by maintaining plant and
animal biodiversity and watershed resources.
