Modeled Changes to Canopy Fuels in Arizona Estimate Crown Fire Behavior Over Time and Assess Ecological and 
Management Implications 
This study modeled changes in canopy fuels (canopy biomass, canopy bulk density, species composition) and potential fire 
behavior (crowning index) over a 160-year period from 1880 to 2040 utilizing study sites located on the North Rim of Grand 
Canyon National Park in northern Arizona. The study spanned a 500-meter gradient in elevation to include ponderosa pine 
forests through higher elevation mixed conifer, aspen and 
spruce-fir vegetation types.  
A schematic diagram is included here that depicts the forest 
data collection and modeling process used. Forest change was 
simulated on a per-plot basis (166 plots total) at 10-year 
intervals using the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) with the 
Central Rockies variant. Simulations were initialized with 
reconstructed 1880 conditions and then run adding regeneration 
data until 2040. Simulations were found to be relatively accurate 
(+ 20% of field values for tree density and basal area) after 
comparing outputs for the year 2000 with field data collected 
from 1998-2002. The Nexus Fire Behavior and Hazard 
Assessment System was used to model fire behavior under 
extreme (90th and 97th percentile weather) conditions. The 
project focused on crown fire behavior, measured by the crowning index (CI), since it was thought to be a reliable fire behavior 
variable. Crowning Index is defined as the wind speed at which active canopy burning could be sustained. 
The most dramatic changes in canopy biomass were found to 
be at the higher elevation sites. On average, canopy biomass 
increased 279% on these sites compared to an average 
increase of 122% at the lower elevation sites. As expected, 
canopy bulk density values closely paralleled canopy 
biomass values with minor variations. Species composition 
also differed by elevation. Very high wind speeds were 
required for crown fire spread at all sites in 1880. However 
wind speeds needed to sustain crown fire spread decreased 
from 23% to 86% by the end of the simulation period (2040), 
depending on the site. Modeled across the entire North Rim 
area, 33% of the landscape was susceptible to crown fire 
spread at a wind speed threshold of 45 km/h (28 mi/h) in 
2000, compared to less than 6% in 1880 (see figure at right). 
Wind speeds of 45 km/h or more have been found to be common 
as gusts and occasionally as sustained winds in northern Arizona 
during severe fires. 
There are numerous ecological and management implications 
from this study. For example, the historical shift towards mesic species is likely to have lowered crown base heights facilitating 
an increase in crown fire initiation. Also, the data suggest that in ponderosa pine dominated sites even if relatively intense fires 
resulted in a substantial reduction of canopy biomass (up to 40-50%), the resulting forest conditions could still be within the 
range of historic conditions if older trees tended to survive.

Comparison of crowning index values, km/h, on North 
Rim forests in 1880 (relatively resistant to crown fire) 
and 2040 (relatively susceptible to crown fire). The 
large area classified as “burn” is the outlet fire, which 
burned in May, 2000.
