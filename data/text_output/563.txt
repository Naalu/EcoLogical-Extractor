Abstract
The Rodeo–Chediski ﬁre burned approximately 189,650 ha in east–central Arizona from June 18 to July 7, 2002, 113,700 ha of it on White
Mountain Apache tribal land. In 2004 and 2005, we measured plant canopy cover and richness in areas of high and low burn severity in each of two
treatments: (1) cutting and prescribed burning, or (2) untreated, in the 11 years prior to the wildﬁre. Total understory plant canopy cover was
signiﬁcantly higher in areas of high severity ( p = .0002 in 2004 and p = .0001 in 2005). Overall, there was high richness of exotic species but cover
was surprisingly low at <3% across all years, severities, and treatments. There were no signiﬁcant differences in exotic species cover between high
and low severity or between treated and untreated areas. Areas of high severity burn were seeded after the ﬁre with several native grasses, native
forbs, and common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Wheat had a strong presence in the plant community in 2004, but was uncommon by 2005.
Indicator Species Analysis showed the indicators of high severity were seeded or early successional species. In contrast, indicators of low severity
included several perennial bunchgrasses. While our results show that wheat declined quickly and exotic plants were uncommon, any longer-term
impacts of the ﬁre on the plant community can only be addressed by continued monitoring of these sites.

1. Introduction
Increasing numbers of large wildﬁres in western U.S. forests
in recent decades (Westerling et al., 2006) have raised concerns
about long-term ecological consequences. In addition to the
loss of timber and increased soil erosion, large wildﬁres may
greatly alter post-ﬁre plant communities by providing ideal
habitat for a number of exotic species (Keeley et al., 2003;
Crawford et al., 2001). When existing plant biomass is removed
by a disturbance resources become available to invading exotic
plants (Bataineh et al., 2006; Swope, 2003). Exotic plant
invasions threaten the ecological health of forests world-wide
and can alter ﬁre regimes (Brooks et al., 2004; Lake and
Leishman, 2004).
Grime (1977) outlined three strategies for plant establish-
ment in response to stress and disturbance, the ruderal
(R-selection), competitive (C-selection), and stress-tolerant
(S-selection) strategies of plant evolution. Ruderal species are
adapted to environments with high disturbance but low stress,
and therefore colonize areas that are high in nutrients and other
resources after disturbance. These species are often considered
‘‘early successional’’ species and are commonly annual or
biennial herbs (D’Antonio and Chambers, 2006; Lake and
Leishman, 2004).
In southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. & C.
Lawson) forests, Grifﬁs et al. (2001) compared understory
response between stands that were thinned, thinned and
prescribed burned, burned by stand-replacing wildﬁre, and
unmanaged control stands. They found that while overall
plant canopy cover increased with treatment intensity (the
most intense being stand-replacing wildﬁre, the least intense
being thinned only), exotic species cover and species richness
increased dramatically after wildﬁre. Native graminoid cover
and species richness were higher on forested stands compared
to areas severely burned in the 1996 wildﬁre. Crawford et al.
(2001) noted that higher species richness after moderate to
high severity ﬁre was due to exotic species and native ruderal
species such as Conyza canadensis (L.) Cronq. (Canadian

horseweed). In contrast, a study by Huisinga et al. (2005)
found that native plants were the key taxa that increased total
plant species richness and abundance after a high intensity ﬁre
in Grand Canyon National Park. They attributed the limited
exotic species response to the fact that this area was never
logged and rarely grazed by livestock (grazing in GCNP
ceased in the mid 1930s), so there were few or no exotic
species seeds present in the seed bank. Other factors, such as
the remoteness of their study area, lack of nearby roads, and
the Park policy of not seeding after ﬁre, may have contributed
to the paucity of exotic species. A 16-year study by Foxx
(1996) on the 1977 La Mesa ﬁre in Bandelier National
Monument, NM, also found few exotic species, perhaps
because of the ‘‘preservation’’ management strategy of the
National Park Service. One seeded species, slender wheat-
grass (Elymus trachycaulus (Link) Gould ex Shinners), was
initially a dominant species after the ﬁre but dropped out
within a decade. Native ruderal species, such as fetid
goosefoot (Chenopodium graveolens Willd.), were also
dominant right after the ﬁre and eventually disappeared.
The Rodeo–Chediski ﬁre is the largest and most severe
wildﬁre on record in the Southwest. It burned approximately
189,650 ha in east–central Arizona from June 18 to July 7,
2002, leaving a mosaic pattern of burn severity on 113,700 ha
of White Mountain Apache tribal land. The ﬁre burned through
several vegetation types including chaparral, pin˜on-juniper
woodland (Pinus edulis Engelm.-Juniperus spp.), ponderosa
pine forest, and isolated pockets of mixed conifer (Finney et al.,
2005; Strom, 2005; USDA Forest Service, 2002). Many
forested stands within the ﬁre’s perimeter had been managed by
the tribe for decades, utilizing commercial timber harvests,
non-commercial thinning, and prescribed burning. The severity
of the Rodeo–Chediski ﬁre was substantially reduced in areas
that had received recent (<11 years pre-ﬁre) management
treatments (Finney et al., 2005; Strom, 2005). Management
treatments that reduce fuels and thus the severity of subsequent
wildﬁre can have multi-century impacts.
We investigated the effect of the pre-ﬁre forest manage-
ment and ﬁre severity on plant community recovery after the
Rodeo–Chediski ﬁre. Given the timber management on the
White Mountain Apache tribal land and the varied severity
patterns created by the Rodeo–Chediski ﬁre, a matrix of
conditions was present. We hypothesized that ﬁre severity
would override pre-ﬁre timber management practices in
affecting the post-ﬁre plant community. That is, severely
burned areas would resemble each other whether or not pre-
ﬁre treatments had occurred. We hypothesized that high burn
severity areas would have: (1) higher total plant canopy
cover; (2) greater representation of ruderal and seeded
species as indicators; and (3) higher exotic species richness
and plant canopy cover, compared to areas classiﬁed as low
burn severity, based on the plant colonization strategies
outlined by Grime (1977). We also expected that species
seeded post-burn would attain higher cover in high severity
areas, and that Triticum aestivum L. (common wheat), seeded
post-ﬁre, would be a prominent species in seeded areas, but
would not persist over time.
2. Methods
2.1. Site selection
The White Mountain Apache tribal lands lie south of the
Mogollon Rim in central-eastern Arizona. Maximum and
minimum temperatures for the region, as reported at the Heber
Ranger Station by the Western Regional Climate Center
(www.wrcc.dri.edu) range from 29.3 8C in July to 8.8 8C in
January, based on 1950–2005 averages. Average total annual
precipitation is 44.4 cm (standard deviation 11.5 cm). Total
annual precipitation during the years of data collection was
lower than the 55-year average: 33.3 cm in 2004 and 40.7 cm in
2005. Total snowfall in winter of 2003/2004 was 50.3 and
22.9 cm in winter of 2004/2005, compared to the long term
average of 97.3 cm. Elevation for the study area ranges from
2000 to 2295 m. All sites were above 2000 m to ensure they fell
in a ponderosa pine-dominated ecosystem, and at less than 45%
slope. The average slope was 17.2%. Study sites were randomly
selected within the combinations of two levels of ﬁre severity
(low and high) and two types of pre-ﬁre forest management
practices (cut and burned and untreated; henceforth referred to
as treatments). Fire severity was determined from a remotely
sensed Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (DNBR) map. This
map shows the difference between the infrared and near
infrared wavelengths emitted by pre-ﬁre and post-ﬁre vegeta-
tion (DNBR = NBRpre-ﬁre  NBRpost-ﬁre). High severity areas
show a greater difference than low severity areas due to greater
vegetation die-off. The thresholds for high and low severity
were based on Cocke et al. (2005), who classiﬁed burn severity
in a nearby national forest. Low severity included unburned
areas and areas that had a DNBR of less than 570; high severity
areas had a DNBR greater than 570. The treatment categories
were ‘cut and burned’ within 11 years prior to the ﬁre or ‘no
treatment’ within the same period. The 11-year time period was
determined by Strom’s (2005) analysis of treatment boundaries
compared with burn severity; forest areas treated >11 years
were indistinguishable in the severity of burn from untreated
areas. The boundaries of these treatments were provided by the
tribe. For consistency, plots were restricted to soil types of the
Overgaard series including Overgaard gravelly ﬁne sandy loam
and Overgaard gravelly loam. This was the most common soil
type found within the ﬁre perimeter. These are well-drained
alluvial soils derived from sandstone, quartzite, and granite
(Mitchell, 1981) and are classiﬁed as ﬁne, mixed, active, frigid
Typic Paleustalfs (Soil Survey Staff, 2006).
High severity areas of the Rodeo–Chediski ﬁre were seeded
during Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation (BAER) in 2002
after the ﬁre. The seed mix used on White Mountain Apache
triballandsincludedthe exoticspeciescommonwheat,appliedat
a rate of 16.8 kg ha1. Common wheat is often seeded in order to
create a non-persistent ground cover to control erosion and
noxious weed invasion (Keeley, 2004). The remainder of the seed
mix included: E. trachycaulus (3.8 kg ha1), western wheatgrass
(Pascopyrum smithii (Rydb.) A. Lo¨ve) (2.8 kg ha1), switch-
grass (Panicum virgatum L.) (0.8 kg ha1), green needlegrass
(Nassella viridula (Trin.) Barkworth) (1.6 kg ha1), mountain

brome (Bromus marinatus = Bromus carinatus H. & A.) (Welsh
et al., 1993) (2.7 kg ha1), sideoats grama (Bouteloua curti-
pendula (Michx.) Torr.) (0.4 kg ha1), sand dropseed (Spor-
obolus cryptandrus (Torr.) Gray) (0.005), plains coreopsis
(Coreopsis tinctoria Nutt.) (0.07 kg ha1), purple prairie clover
(Dalea purpurea Vent.) (0.04 kg ha1), blue ﬂax (Linum lewisii
Pursh) (0.06 kg ha1), and black-eyed susan (Rudbeckia hirta
L.) (0.03 kg ha1) (J. A. Youtz, pers. comm., 2003).
2.2. Measurement
We used a stratiﬁed random design with two levels of pre-
ﬁre treatments (treated/untreated) and two levels of ﬁre
severity (low/high). Six study sites, with three plots each,
situated 200 m apart, were measured in each severity and
treatment combination. Plot centers were a subset of those used
by Strom (2005) to assess overstory tree structure after the
wildﬁre. At each plot center, we established two 44.8-m
transects,
crossing
perpendicularly,
resulting
in
a
31.7 m  31.7 m square, approximately 1000 m2. We mea-
sured plant canopy cover in 20 cm  50 cm quadrats spaced at
4-m intervals along each transect, for a total of 20 quadrats for
each plot. Within each quadrat, we measured total plant canopy
cover, cover of forbs, exotic forbs, graminoids, exotic
graminoids, shrubs, and trees <1.4 m tall, plus cover by
species using six cover classes (Daubenmire, 1959). We also
estimated cover of litter, rocks, logs, bare ground, and moss.
Plant nomenclature and classiﬁcation of species as native or
exotic follows USDA-NRCS (2006) and Welsh et al. (1993);
one exception was Portulaca oleracea L. (little hogweed),
which was listed as ‘introduced’ on the PLANTS database, but
we classiﬁed as ‘native’ based on Byrne and McAndrews’
(1975) evidence that it was present in North America before the
late 1400s. Voucher specimens are stored at the White
Mountain Apache Tribe’s ofﬁce in Whiteriver, Arizona. We
grouped species to the generic level when vegetative
characteristics were insufﬁcient to identify to the species
level. In addition, we quantiﬁed plant species richness for the
entire plot by recording all species that occurred within each
1000-m2 plot. Overstory canopy cover was estimated from a
hemispherical photograph at each plot center using a digital
camera with a 1808 ﬁsheye lens (Nikon CoolPix E4300 and
FC-E8 Fisheye Converter Lens). Hemispherical photos were
analyzed using Gap Light Analyzer (Institute of Ecosystem
Studies, 1999) to quantify percent canopy openness. Overstory
data and physical characteristics (aspect, slope) were measured
in 2004. Pre-ﬁre basal area was calculated by adding the basal
areas of surviving and ﬁre-killed trees. Our measurements took
place from mid-July to early September in 2004 and 2005, in
order to coincide with monsoonal rain.
2.3. Statistical methods
We analyzed the data using DISTLM (Anderson, 2001), a
non-parametric,
permutation
procedure
for
analysis
of
variance for multivariate data. We used DISTLM to test for
multivariate differences between plant communities in high
and low severity areas to test our hypothesis that ﬁre severity
would override pre-ﬁre timber management practices in the
post-ﬁre plant community. We also used DISTLM to test our
hypotheses that high burn severity areas would have higher
total plant canopy cover and higher exotic species richness
and plant canopy cover, compared to areas classiﬁed as low
burn severity. DISTLM was used for analyzing univariate
measures for richness and abundance because these data
evidenced non-normality and heterogeneous variances. We
carried out 9999 permutations for each test. Euclidean
distance was used for univariate data and the Bray-Curtis
dissimilarity measure was used for plant community data. The
alpha level was 0.05.
We performed non-metric multi-dimensional scaling ordi-
nation of the cover data by species using PC-ORD software
(McCune and Mefford, 1999). This was done as a qualitative
measure in order to provide a visual display of the data and the
factors driving the differences between the plant communities.
The ordination was done using the Bray-Curtis distance
measure (Faith et al., 1987). The parameters were set such that
40 runs were performed with real data, 50 runs were performed
with randomizations (to determine how likely the observed
stress value of the ﬁnal solution would be by chance alone), a
maximum of 400 iterations per run, and an instability criterion
of 0.00001. Finally, we used PC-ORD to identify Indicator
Species of treatments and ﬁre severity classes. Indicator species
values were calculated for each species as relative frequen-
cy  percent canopy cover. Species with p < .05 and an
indicator value >25 (Dufreˆne and Legendre, 1997) were
identiﬁed as indicator species. The threshold value of 25 was
arbitrarily set by Dufreˆne and Legendre, supposing that an
indicator species is present in at least 50% of the sites in one
group (in this case the treatment and ﬁre severity classes) and
that its percent canopy cover in that group reaches at least 50%.
The Indicator Species Analysis allowed us to see if species

including Triticum aestivum L. (common wheat).
3. Results
The pre-ﬁre forest was composed mainly of ponderosa pine,
but also included Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel)
Franco), Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt.), white ﬁr
(Abies concolor (Gord. and Glend.) Lindl. ex Hildebr.), and
junipers (Juniperus osteosperma (Torr.) Little and Juniperus
deppeana Steud.). There was no signiﬁcant difference in pre-
ﬁre basal area between treatment types ( p = .563) or between
ﬁre severities ( p = .136). After the ﬁre, in high severity areas
across both treatments, live tree density declined by 95% and
basal area of live trees declined by 90% (Table 1). In low
severity areas live tree density declined by 40% and basal area
of live trees declined by only 18%. Post-ﬁre high severity areas
had no living A. concolor or P. menziesii trees. Basal area of
live trees was signiﬁcantly lower in high severity areas
compared to low severity areas ( p = .039) after the ﬁre. There
was no signiﬁcant difference for treatment effect ( p = .781).
Canopy
openness
post-burn
was
signiﬁcantly
higher
( p = .019) in high severity areas (>65%) than in low severity
areas (<46%).
We found a total of 310 plant species across all sites and
years, but we focused on the 151 species found on at least 5% of
the plots and for analysis of cover we used only the 87 species
found within at least 5% of the transect quadrats. Removal of
species that occur at frequencies of <5% is often recommended
to avoid having the analysis driven by very uncommon species
(Gauch, 1982). Total plant species richness was not signiﬁ-
cantly different for any combination of severity and treatment
in either year (Table 2, Fig. 1a). Analyzing differences in
richness for all forbs and all graminoid species separately, there
were no differences in forb richness for severity or treatment
but graminoids were signiﬁcantly richer in high severity burns
in 2005 and in areas that had been cut and burned in 2004
(Table 2).
Fig. 1. (a) Average (+S.E.) richness on 1000 m2 plot by ﬁre severity (H = high,
L = low), treatment, and year. No signiﬁcant difference was found for treatment
or severity in either year. (b) Average (+S.E.) canopy cover on 20- by 50-cm
quadrats by ﬁre severity (H = high, L = low), treatment, and year. In 2004, a
signiﬁcant difference was found for the severity effect ( p = .0002). The
interaction between severity and treatment was signiﬁcant ( p = .0233) in 2005.

Total plant cover was signiﬁcantly higher in high severity
areas than on low severity areas in 2004, supporting our
hypothesis that ﬁre severity was more inﬂuential than pre-
wildﬁre forest management practices (Table 2, Fig. 1).
However, the interaction between severity and treatment was
signiﬁcant for total plant cover in 2005. Contrary to our
hypothesis that high severity areas would have more exotic
cover than low severity areas, neither exotic forbs nor exotic
graminoids showed signiﬁcant differences for severity or
treatment effect (Fig. 2a and b). There were 35 exotic species
overall, but 13 were found on at least 5% of the plots and were
included in analyses (Table 3). Total forb, graminoid, and shrub
cover was signiﬁcantly higher in high severity areas but showed
no signiﬁcant difference for treatment effects, for both 2004 and
2005 (Fig. 2c–e). Tree regeneration cover had a signiﬁcant
interaction between severity and treatment effects in both 2004
and 2005, indicating that the response to ﬁre severity was not
consistent between treatments (Fig. 2f).
Multivariate assessment of plant canopy cover of individual
species showed signiﬁcant differences for severity effect
( p = .0001 in both years). Plant community composition based
on cover data by species was signiﬁcantly different for
treatment effect in 2004 ( p = .044), but not in 2005 ( p = .10).

neomexicana Gray (New Mexico locust), which had nearly 32
times more cover in untreated areas than in areas that were cut
and burned. Our analysis of composition of the plant
community based on presence/absence of species indicated
signiﬁcant differences for both treatment (2004, p = .0036;
2005, p = .0046) and severity effects ( p = .0001 both years). In
each case, the difference was driven by very few species.
Ordinated plant communities were separated by severity-
level based on plant canopy cover data, providing a qualitative
illustration of the differences in plant community cover data
(Fig. 3a and b). However, when grouped by treatments instead
of by severities the distinction could not be made, supporting
the results of the permutation procedure. No separation was
evident
using
presence/absence
data
either,
although
a
signiﬁcant
difference was
found
using
the
permutation
procedure.
We identiﬁed 9 indicator species for high severity in 2004
and 10 in 2005 (Table 4). B. carinatus, E. trachycaulus, and
common wheat were seeded species. Chenopodium album L.
(lambsquarters), Chenopodium graveolens, Cirsium wheeleri
(Gray) Petrak (Wheeler’s thistle), and Conyza canadensis were
indicator species in both 2004 and 2005 on high severity sites.
In 2005, additional high severity indicator species were Bahia
dissecta (Gray) Britt. (ragleaf bahia), B. curtipendula, P.
smithii, and Pseudognaphalium macounii (Greene) Kartesz
(Macoun’s
cudweed).

Classiﬁcation of ‘noxious’ is based on designation in at least one of four southwestern states (Sieg et al., 2003). Species in the ‘seeded’ category may have been seeded
throughout the known history of the White Mountain Apache tribal lands, not uniquely as part of the BAER efforts (pers. comm., J. A. Youtz, 2006). A total of 31
exotic species were found on high severity plots and 24 on low severity plots.

severity areas in 2004, wheat was only detected in areas that had
not received treatment, and was not detected at all on low
severity sites in 2005.
4. Discussion
Our comparison of areas of high and low burn severity
within areas that had been previously cut and burned (treated)
and untreated areas provided support for the hypothesis that ﬁre
severity would play a more important role in the post-wildﬁre
plant community than treatment. There was signiﬁcantly higher
plant canopy cover in 2004 in high severity sites compared to
low severity burned sites, but no difference due to treatment
effect. Sabo (2006) found that basal area must be reduced to
8 m2 ha1 or less to result in an increase in understory
production. Clary and Ffolliott (1996) found an understory
response at 5–18 m2 ha1. Basal area in the high severity sites
after the ﬁre was 1.9 m2 ha1 in untreated sites and 0.9 m2 ha1
in treated sites, clearly low enough to result in an understory
response. In low severity areas basal area was 21.6 and
14.0 m2 ha1, respectively.
We predicted that there would be greater cover of exotic
plants in areas that burned with higher severity; to our surprise,
this hypothesis was not upheld. Other studies in national parks
and monuments, which are managed for preservation, have
shown relatively low cover of exotics. Several studies in more
actively managed landscapes, including national forests, have
shown higher exotic cover (however, see Fornwalt et al., 2003).
This study and the accompanying research we did on the
Apache-Sitgreaves NF have shown low exotic cover despite
active management and ﬁre use over a long period of time
(Table 5). Huisinga et al. (2005) found 28% total plant cover 6
years after an intense prescribed ﬁre, and of that, <1% was
exotic plant cover. Eight years post-burn, they found 50% total
plant cover, and only 1.0% was exotic species. They attributed
the near absence of exotic plants in their study to the fact that
the area had not been heavily managed or grazed. In contrast,
the lands of the White Mountain Apache reservation have been
managed for decades for timber and grazing. Therefore, there is
reason to suspect that propagule pressure of exotic species
would be sufﬁcient for populations of a number of previously
introduced exotic species to expand following the ﬁre, but the
exotic species cover is similar with <1% cover in both 2004 and
2005.
Our results contrast with those of Crawford et al. (2001),
who found twice as much exotic cover on high severity burns as
on moderate burns within 2 years of the wildﬁre. Some of the
difference between our study and Crawford’s was due to
different authorities for whether a species was exotic. Crawford
et al. (2001) classiﬁed Conyza canadensis and Chenopodium
graveolens as exotics. We classify both species as native based
on USDA-NRCS (2006). The exotic species we found on at
least 5% of plots, and therefore included in analysis, included
only four designated as noxious in one or more southwestern
state, Bromus tectorum L. (cheatgrass), Cirsium vulgare (Savi)
Ten. (bull thistle), Erodium cicutarium (L.) L’He´r. Ex. Ait.
(redstem storksbill) and Verbascum thapsus L. (common
mullein). Other noxious species, Onopordum acanthium L.
(Scotch thistle) and Convolvulus arvensis L. (ﬁeld bindweed)
were found on fewer than 5% of plots. Noticeably absent were
other noxious species adapted to high ﬁre severity conditions:
Linaria dalmatica (L.) P. Mill. ssp. dalmatica (Dalmatian
toadﬂax) (Dodge et al., in press), Salsola tragus L. (Russian
thistle) (Crawford et al., 2001), and Centaurea diffusa (Wolfson
et al. (2005). Most of the exotic species we found are not
considered noxious in southwestern states, were found in very
low cover, or were seeded (Table 3, Fig. 2a and b).
Uncertainties about plant identiﬁcation and whether plant
species are native or exotic can make an assessment of the role

of wildﬁres in enhancing exotic species confusing. Using
different authorities can lead to different conclusions about
whether or not a species is classiﬁed as exotic. Similar to
Crawford et al. (2001), Barclay et al. (2004) classiﬁed Conyza
canadensis as an exotic species, which comprised most of the
total exotic cover on their sites (Table 5). Had they classiﬁed C.
canadensis as a native species, their assessment of the
abundance of exotic species would have been different. Some
papers do not give their source for whether a species is
classiﬁed as native or exotic, and others do not provide lists of
species classiﬁed as exotic. Researchers can help clarify some
of these issues by collecting voucher specimens, identifying
their source used to identify exotic species, and providing a list
of species classiﬁed as exotic and their contribution to total
exotic abundance.
It might have been logical to expect that some exotic plant
species would establish following disturbances due to seed
bank germination. While we had no pre-ﬁre vegetation data,
seeding had been done in past decades as part of rehabilitation
after logging operations on skid trails, log landings, and roads.
Exotic species were used for seeding until the late 1990s, when
the policy was revised to using only native species. In the mid
1990s the White Springs ﬁre was revegetated using a seed mix
that included Agropyron desertorum (Fisch. ex Link) J. A.
Schultes (desert wheatgrass), Dactylis glomerata L. (orchard-
grass), and Bromus inermis Leyss. (smooth brome). Eragrostis
curvula (Schrad.) Nees (weeping lovegrass) was also seeded on
road closures on the eastern side of the ﬁre, but did not spread
across the landscape (J. A. Youtz, personal communication,
2006). While these species were detected in our plots, they were
minor species.
Precipitation and droughts greatly affect understory plant
community composition and productivity in the southwest
(Milchunas, 2006; Moore et al., 2006). The study area received
more total precipitation in 2005 than it did in 2004, but there
was over twice as much snowfall in 2004. These levels of

precipitation were less than the 55-year averages. Perhaps
insufﬁcient precipitation, especially snowfall, played a role in
limiting the response of annual species, including exotics.
When we looked at the plant community data by species
composition, we found the species with signiﬁcantly higher
cover in high severity sites matched closely with the results from
the Indicator Species Analysis. Of the 13 species found to be
indicator species for high severity (Table 4), 5 were speciﬁcally
seeded in high severity areas (Bouteloua curtipendula, Bromus
carinatus, E. trachycaulus, P. smithii and common wheat).
Whether these seeded native grass species will remain dominant
over time remains to be seen. Foxx (1996) observed that the
seeded grass, E. trachycaulus, was dominant in the years after
the 1977 La Mesa ﬁre, but was not observed after 1985. The
remaining eight species are disturbance adapted, or increase in
response to ﬁre. Ceanothus fendleri Gray (Fendler’s ceanothus)
resprouts vigorously after ﬁre, and dormant seeds in the seed
bank are stimulated to germinate by heat (Huffman and Moore,
2004). Both Chenopodium album and Chenopodium graveolens
are disturbance adapted (Laughlin et al., 2004), and Crawford
et al. (2001) found C. album to have a strong response to high
severity burn. B. dissecta, Cirsium wheeleri, Conyza canadensis,
and P. macounii are disturbance tolerant or dependent on
disturbances for their establishment, following the Grime (1977)
model of ruderal species establishment. Lotus wrightii (Gray)
Greene (Wright’s deervetch) was shown to be a dominant species
on the La Mesa ﬁre by Foxx (1996) and DiTomaso et al. (1999)
report Lotus spp. increase in response to ﬁre.
Four species were indicators of low severity sites. K.
macrantha, M. longiligula, and P. fendleriana are all perennial
bunch grasses, which are adapted to low severity ﬁre by
sprouting from leaf bases insulated by old leaf sheaths (Bond
and van Wilgen, 1996) or from below the soil surface where
they are protected (Young, 1983). In addition, R. neomexicana
was an indicator of low severity in 1 year.
The signiﬁcant differences in plant species composition
based on presence or absence of species for treatment and
severity effects were driven by few species in each case. Of the
155 species found on at least 5% of the plots, 14 were unique to
untreated areas, 8 unique to cut and burned, 8 unique to high
severity areas, and 4 to low severity areas. These small
differences can probably be accounted for more by the pre-
existing plant community than it can to actual wildﬁre or
treatment effects. An exception may be some of the species that
occurred in high severity but not on low severity in 2005. These
included Amaranthus hybridus L. (slim amaranth), Ambrosia
acanthicarpa Hook. (ﬂatspine burr ragweed), and P. oleracea
which are known to grow in disturbed areas (Ecological
Restoration Institute, 2005).
Our hypothesis that wheat would not persist over time was
upheld. Wheat nearly disappeared from our plots by 2005.
Keeley (2004) suggested that the large die-off of wheat could
create
‘‘an
ecological
vacuum,’’
and
therefore
present
opportunity for invasion of exotics. While our research can
not fully address this concern, we observed a minor, but non-
signiﬁcant increase in exotic forb cover in 2005 in only one

category, untreated/high severity, which increased from 1.15%
cover (S.E. = 0.87) to 2.1% cover (S.E. = 1.47) in 2005. All
other combinations of severity and treatment showed slight
declines in exotic forb cover in 2005. Exotic graminoid cover
also showed a non-signiﬁcant but slight decline in all
categories, except low severity/cut and burn sites, where exotic
graminoid cover increased by about 1% in 2005. These short-
term data do not show support for the dieoff of wheat resulting
in an ecological vacuum that is subsequently ﬁlled with exotics,
but future monitoring would be useful to assess any longer-term
consequences of seeding.
5. Conclusions
Our results supported the hypothesis that severely burned
areas, regardless of previous forest treatments, would be
characterized by higher plant canopy cover compared to low
severity burn areas and have mostly ruderal colonizing species
as indicator species. However, exotic plant species cover was
not signiﬁcantly higher on severely burned areas compared to
areas classiﬁed as low burn severity. It was gratifying to observe
that cover of exotic species was low in the ﬁrst 3 years after the
Rodeo–Chediski ﬁre, despite our expectations to the contrary.
While our study was short-term in scope during a drought
period, other studies have seen an explosion of exotic species
populations within 2 to 3 years following ﬁre (Crawford et al.,
2001; Floyd et al., 2006; Wienk et al., 2004). The White
Mountain Apache tribal land has been managed for logging,
grazing, and hunting, unlike preserves that had similar low
post-ﬁre responses by exotics. Management practices such as
thinning and prescribed burning do have the potential to
increase exotics due to disturbance, but tend to not have as
detrimental effect as severe wildﬁre (Hunter et al., 2006). Our
results show that seeding both post-ﬁre and previously,
contributed to the exotic species richness in the area. Although
wheat largely died off within a growing season, other perennial
exotic grasses which had been seeded in the area persisted and
were indicator species in high severity burn sites. There were 13
exotic species found on 5% or greater of the plots in this study.
Of those, three had been seeded in past management practices
(A. desertorum, D. glomerata, and wheat). In addition, B.
inermis, E. curvula, and Lolium perenne L. (perennial ryegrass)
had been seeded in past years but were found on less than 5% of
plots. Most of the remaining exotic species include ﬁre-
followers, or other species such as common mullein, which is
listed as noxious in Colorado, but tends to be ephemeral a few
years after disturbances (Sieg et al., 2003). The possibility of a
sudden and rapid proliferation of existing exotic species such as
Floyd et al. (2006) observed can only be addressed by
continuing to monitor these sites in the future.
