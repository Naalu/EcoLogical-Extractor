The inﬂuence of tree age on climate sensitivity is of central importance in dendrochronology. Recent research
has highlighted the disparate nature of age-dependent growth responses across species and geographic locations.
We compared growth sensitivity and the inﬂuence of climate in Pinus edulis (Piñon) of varying ages at Dinosaur
National Monument (DINO, northwestern Colorado, USA. Piñon is a particularly good species for this study
because of its long life-span and climate sensitivity, and the DINO site is at the northern extreme of the current
distribution. We evaluated changes in climate-growth relationships in piñon using total ring-width measure-
ments and running averages of chronology statistics, mean sensitivity (MS) and coeﬃcient of variation (CV), and
we investigated growth response to climate variability as trees age. These measures indicated initial low growth
sensitivity, increasing as trees reached mid-life stages, approximately 200–250 years, then relatively constant
sensitivity from 250-800+ years. First order partial auto correlation (PAC1) declined throughout the life stages
of piñon at DINO. The trend in declining autocorrelation leads to higher MS values in the older age classes.
Greater year to year variation indicates less persistence in the study population, hence lower autocorrelation.
We investigated the degree to which this relationship could be explained by the summer Palmer Drought
Severity Index (PDSI) and whether this relationship varied with tree age. The strength of the tree-ring growth
response to PDSI was at a maximum during the ﬁrst two centuries of growth (R2 = 0.54). between two and six
centuries (R2 = 0.48), after which we detected a decline in the sensitivity of tree growth to PDSI with increasing
age (R2 = 0.41). This study adds to the literature on age-related climate sensitivity in trees; our ﬁndings indicate
that age-related changes in climate-tree-ring growth responses should be considered when climate variables are
reconstructed from tree-ring width chronologies, and speciﬁcally from Pinus edulis.
1. Introduction
Tree-ring chronologies are widely used as indicators of ecological
responses to environmental variability (Fritts and Swetnam, 1989;
Hofgaard et al., 1999; Ogle et al., 2000; Peterson and Peterson, 2001;
Suarez
et al., 2004; Speer, 2010; Swetnam
and Brown,
2011;
Copenheaver et al., 2011). It is often assumed that tree growth re-
sponses to climate are independent of tree age, but disparate age-re-
lated trends in climate sensitivity (i.e., diﬀerential growth response to
climate variation) have been documented (Szeicz and MacDonald,
1994, Carrer and Urbinati, 2006; Esper et al., 2008; Vieira et al., 2009).
For example, age-related sensitivity to climate occurred in Larix decidua
but not in co-dominant Pinus cembra in high altitude forests of the
Italian Alps (Carrer and Urbinati, 2006). Similarly, Esper et al. (2008)
found similar climate signals across age groups in Pinus cembra in the
central
European
Alps.
Young
Pinus
sylvestris
in
Scandinavia
(< 100 years
old)
had
a
higher
climate
sensitivity
than
older
(100–250 years old) trees (Linderholm and Linderholm, 2004). Climate
sensitivity of Juniperus thurifera in Spain decreased with increasing age
(Rozas et al., 2009). Radial growth response to climate diﬀered in
trees > 200 years old and < 200 years old in Picea glauca from the
Northwest Territories, Canada (Szeicz and MacDonald, 1994). Such
ﬁndings suggest that age-dependent responses to climate are common,
but could be site and species speciﬁc.
This research focused on Pinus edulis Engelm., piñon, one of the
most ubiquitous tree species of the southwestern North American.
Piñon, along with several species of juniper (Juniperus osteosperma, J.
monosperma, J. scopulorum, and J. deppeana) dominates one of the most

T

important ecosystems in the Southwest. Piñon-juniper woodlands are
valuable for multiple ecological services, including providing structure
for wildlife habitat, hydrologic regulation, and biogeochemical cycling
in the arid regions of the Southwest. They are also of signiﬁcant cultural
importance for indigenous peoples in the region (Gottfried et al., 1995;
Floyd, 2003; Romme et al., 2009).
Despite its abundance in drought-prone, high water stress areas,
piñons are among the most long-lived trees in the world (Brown, 1996)
and are highly resilient to drought. Even the best-adapted and resilient
species are not, however, exempt from severe natural disturbances.
Increasing temperatures and drought in recent decades have created
conditions that challenge this resiliency (Breshears et al., 2009;
McDowell et al., 2008; Looney et al., 2012; Gaylord et al., 2013; Hicke
and Zeppel, 2013; Allen et al., 2015). One result has been massive bark
beetle (Ips confusus) outbreaks on millions of hectares of piñon-juniper
woodland in New Mexico, Colorado, and Arizona (Breshears et al.,
2009; Floyd et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2010). In addition, large ex-
panses of western forests including large areas of piñon-juniper wood-
lands have burned (Flannigan et al., 2000; Floyd et al., 2004;
Westerling et al., 2006). Williams et al. (2010) estimate up to 18% of
forest and woodland area in the Southwest incurred moderate to high
tree mortality due to ﬁre, bark beetle and other drought-related mor-
tality eﬀects between 1984 and 2008. Regionally synchronous natural
disturbances are generally driven by climate variation, and in the
Southwest such distinct changes have been shown to occur on decadal
scales throughout much of the last 2000 years (Swetnam and
Betancourt, 2010). Disturbance regimes (frequency, intensity, severity,
duration, and seasonal timing) are changing rapidly, reﬂecting regional
and global climate inﬂuences (Dale et al., 2001; Allen et al., 2010,
Williams et al., 2010; Stephens et al. 2013, Macalady and Bugmann,
2014). Thus, an understanding of piñon responses to climate variation
over the lifespan of a tree is critical to predicting the species’ long term
prospects in the region.
As well as disturbance events, populations can be adversely eﬀected
by progressively more challenging environmental conditions. Extreme
drought episodes can lead to widespread tree death. A clear example of
drought-induced die-oﬀin piñon was demonstrated by shifts at the
ponderosa-pine/piñon woodland ecotone following the 1950′s drought
in northern New Mexico (Allen and Breshears, 1998). While piñon is
considered highly adapted to drought (Lanner and Van Devender, 1998;
Floyd, 2003), Breshears et al. (2005) showed that lethal sensitivity to
climate ﬂuctuations can nonetheless occur. Ogle et al. (2000) suggest
that growth sensitivity to climate variability is an important factor that
could pre-dispose piñon to mortality; in trees < 200 years old, reduced
ring growth in the 10–15 years preceding the 1996 drought was evident
in piñon that died as a consequence of drought. Alongside the physio-
logical response to drought stress, tree species including pinon are
susceptible to insect outbreaks increasing the likelihood and extent of
mortality events (Anderegg et al., 2015; Cliﬀord et al., 2013).
Populations that are most adversely aﬀected by climate variability
are often those at the geographic extremes of a species range (Bugmann
and Pﬁster, 2000; Camarero and Gutiérrez, 2004; Ogle et al., 2000;
Jackson et al., 2009; Sánchez-Salguero et al., 2012). The location of our
study, Dinosaur National Monument, CO (DINO) is at the northernmost
range of Pinus edulis, (Gray et al., 2006) where, at the margin of its
current distribution, trees may experience signiﬁcant climate-related
stress. Other studies have found elevated climate sensitivity in alpine
species
at
tree
line
(Lloyd
and
Fastie,
2002;
Linderholm
and
Linderholm, 2004; Esper et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2008; Takahashi et al.,
2011), another line of evidence that marginal populations may be more
sensitive to extremes in climate variability.
In DINO, piñon trees generally coexist with juniper species
(Juniperus osteosperma, J. scopulorum). Macrofossils from these species
preserved in packrat middens show J. osteosperma arriving in the area
9000 years before present (B.P.) while piñon arrived in the area only by

personal
communication). Romme et al. (2013) found that piñons reach ages of
greater than 800 years; the oldest known crossdated living piñon is
1101 years old and is in close geographic proximity to the DINO study
site (Brown, 1996). The samples assessed in this study constitute a
unique tree-ring data set from ancient piñons, approaching the max-
imum recorded age of the species.
Our primary objective in this study was to investigate age-related
tree-ring width responses to climate (climate sensitivity) in piñon across
a broad range of tree ages in a population on the margin of its dis-
tribution. We aimed to characterize how trees of various ages diﬀered
in the magnitude of their response to past climate variability, using a
variety of statistical measures. Speciﬁcally, this study addressed three
questions about age-related climate sensitivity in piñon (1) How does
climate sensitivity change as trees age? (2) How have trees of diﬀerent
ages responded to the climate variability of the most recent century? (3)
Does the variation in growth explained by the Palmer Drought Severity
Index (summer PDSI) vary across age classes? By increasing under-
standing of factors that may inﬂuence piñon time series interpretation,
we aim to highlight the potential importance of incorporating the in-
ﬂuence of tree age when selecting series for chronology building.
2. Methods
2.1. Study area
Dinosaur National Monument (DINO) is located in northwestern
Colorado
and
northeastern
Utah,
USA,
spanning
elevations
of
1400–2700 m. All sampling for this study was conducted in Colorado.
The study area was the southeastern portion of DINO, an area of
28,144 ha bounded on the south and east by the Monument boundary,
the Yampa River to the north, and the western boundary by the
Monument roadway to Harper’s Corner, known as the “Yampa Bench”
(Fig. 1). Four sample points were located south of the monument
boundary on adjacent and ecologically similar Bureau of Land Man-
agement (BLM) land. The landscape is a patchwork of piñon and juniper
woodland, Artemisia shrublands, grasslands, and the occasional Dou-
glas-ﬁr stand on high north facing slopes (Coles, 2008).
2.2. Research procedures
We used a recently completed vegetation map of DINO to locate
piñon-juniper woodlands, and randomly generated 5–10 sample loca-
tions within each of ﬁve deﬁned piñon-juniper vegetation types using
ARC GIS (Coles, 2008; ESRI 2010), resulting in a total of 53 sampling
locations. At each point the oldest age class, estimated visually in the
ﬁeld by diameter and growth form, was selected (Floyd et al., 2004).
We used increment borers to extract one core from 10 to 15 trees at
each sample location. Cores were extracted as close to the ground as
possible, at a mean sampling height of 30 cm. In the lab, cores were
mounted and sanded with increasingly ﬁne grits of sandpaper until the
ring structure was clearly visible. Each core was then crossdated using
standard dendrochronological techniques (Fritts and Swetnam, 1989;
Speer, 2010). Crossdating was checked visually against a master
chronology provided by CA Woodhouse, University of Arizona (for lo-
cation see Grissino-Mayer and Fritts, 1997; Woodhouse and Lukas,
2006). To select trees for the climate sensitivity analysis, individual
trees were grouped in 100-year age classes (0–100, 101-200…701-
800+). A random sample of 5–20 trees were selected per age class with
the greatest sample density in the younger classes. The number of trees
selected for each age class generally represented the proportion of trees
in each age class of the approximately 800 total trees sampled. The ﬁnal
test sample consisted of 131 trees representing the full spectrum of ages
(Fig. 2).
Annual ring width year was measured for each core to the nearest
0.001 mm, creating a time series of annual growth for each tree. Ring
widths were measured on a Velmex TA linear encoder in conjunction

with Measure J2X software to record all series measurements in decadal
format (VoorTech Consulting, 2007). The quality control program
COFECHA was used to ensure accuracy in crossdating (Holmes, 1983)
by comparing measured ring widths to an existing site chronology from
the region (Grissino-Mayer and Fritts, 1997; Woodhouse and Lukas,
2006). Problem cores were inspected and any dating errors identiﬁed in
COFECHA were corrected. Two cores were removed because of un-
resolvable crossdating errors and missing sections of outermost rings,

leaving a total core sample size of 129.
2.3. Statistical analysis
2.3.1. Climate sensitivity and tree age
Tree age was deﬁned in this study as beginning with the innermost
full ring in each series. Because our focus was on multi-century growth
relationships, we did not adjust for missing rings in cores that did not
reach pith, nor for years to coring height.
Raw ring widths in decadal format were converted into columns
using the program YUX (Holmes, 2001) and then aligned in separate
sets based on either calendar or growth year. In the latter case, in-
dividual ring-width series from each sampled tree were ordered from 1
to n, 1 being the innermost (oldest) full ring of each series and n being
the outermost full ring. These data were used to analyze growth sen-
sitivity by tree age regardless of calendar year (for example, the
1–100 year group includes the ﬁrst 100 years of growth of all trees; the
101–200 year group includes the second century of growth of all trees;
and so on). Growth data were then ﬁltered into 100 year groups over-
lapping by 50 years (i.e. 1–100, 50–150, 100–200,…750-850) and re-
formatted into compact format, readable by programs such as ARSTAN
(Cook and Holmes, 1986), using the program CASE (Holmes, 2001).
ARSTAN standardizes each individual series, removing the low
frequency trend associated with the geometry of tree growth, while
high frequency (year to year) variation in each series is preserved (Cook
and Holmes, 1986). Within ARSTAN each series was detrended by ﬁt-
ting a cubic smoothing spline preserving 50% of the variation at a
wavelength of 50 years. An index value with a mean of 1 was created by
dividing the raw ring width by the ﬁt line value. The 50 year wave-
length was chosen to remove the low frequency trends associated with
stand dynamics, highlighting the high frequency (interannual) varia-
tion associated with climate (Cook and Peters, 1997). Using ARSTAN
we calculated descriptive statistics for the detrended series, including
mean, median, standard deviation, mean sensitivity (MS) and ﬁrst,
second and third order partial autocorrelation. The running averages of
these statistics created by shifting the 100 year groups 50 years were
used to quantify the growth response across tree age which might be
attributed to climate variability.
We used mean sensitivity (MS) as an index of climate sensitivity
across a broad range of tree ages piñon at DINO. MS is a widely-used
statistical measure of the year to year variations of ring growth (Fritts,
1976; Peterson and Peterson, 2001; Linderholm and Linderholm, 2004;
Suarez et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2008; Rozas et al., 2009; Copenheaver
et al., 2011), and thus an indicator of the climate sensitivity of tree
growth (Eq. (1)):Stokes aHanse

where n = series length, t = year from 1…n, and y = annual measured
ring width. The MS of a given series is a function of the mean, standard
deviation, and ﬁrst order auto correlation in a series, comparing the
growth of one year relative to the growth of the previous year (Hoﬀ,
1983; Bunn et al., 2013). While widely used in dendrochronology lit-
erature, some authors (Strackee and Jansma, 1992, Bunn 2013) have
suggested that MS does not provide additional information beyond
standard deviation, c.v., and ﬁrst order autocorrelation, so these were
calculated separately. Because our use of MS was for within-tree com-
parisons across ages, it remains a useful metric of changing growth
sensitivity to climate. We also calculated the coeﬃcient of variation
(CV, the standard deviation from the mean divided by the mean of a
series) and ﬁrst order correlation (PAC1) to characterize growth var-
iations and characteristics. We tested for normality using Kolmogorv-
SmirnoﬀGoodness of Fit tests for each dependent variable. We used the
Kruskal-Wallace alternative to ANOVA where data were not normal to
determine whether the dependent variables MS and CV varied across
the running average created by the overlapping age-groups (Sokal and
Rohlf, 1995). 1st order autocorrelation (PAC-1) statistics were used to
verify trend apparent in the MS and CV statistics. PAC-1 is deﬁned as
the correlation between one time series and itself shifted or “lagged”
one time unit (Hoﬀ, 1983).
2.3.2. Growth response to climate during the most recent century
To investigate the growth response of individuals to the climatic
environment of the most recent century, we analyzed growth response
(raw ring width) with respect to tree age in calendar year 2009 using
the program ARSTAN (Cook and Holmes, 1986). The same detrending
methods used in the ﬁrst objective were applied and the detrended
descriptive statistics were used to characterize the climate/growth re-
lationship of each tree-ring series. We ran simple linear and logarithmic
regressions on the dependent variable (MS) against the independent
variable (tree age) in 2009 for the entire data set.
2.3.3. Age-related variation in ring growth response to PDSI
Historical PDSI data were obtained from the North American
Drought Atlas; grid point 102 was selected because of its proximity to
our study site (Dai 2004, www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/pdsidata.html).
For recent growth analysis we used PDSI data from 1900 to 2003. We
grouped the 129 trees in 8 age classes (0–100 years, 101–200 years,
201–300
years, 301–400
years, 401–500
years,
501–600
years,
601–700 years, 700+ years). ARSTAN was used to create standardized
(Std) chronologies for each age class. Linear regressions were run for
ring growth index values as a function of summer PDSI. The proportion
of variance explained (R2) for all age groups greater than 100 years was
used to evaluate the strength of the relationship between ring growth
and PDSI across age groups.

normality (K–S = .049, p < .05); therefore, we used the non-parametric
Kruskal-Wallace to test for diﬀerences across overlapping age classes.
There was a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in MS across the age classes
(H = 120.0, p <
.001) (Fig. 3A). Non-parametric post-hoc tests de-
termined that the youngest (1–100 and 50–150) age classes diﬀered
signiﬁcantly from the older age classes (trees 150–600 years old); there
were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences among age classes between150 and 600
years old. The distribution of coeﬃcient of variation (CV) and ﬁrst-
order partial autocorrelation (PAC-1) (Table 1) were normal; therefore,
we applied ANOVA to test for diﬀerences across overlapping age
classes. There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the average CV across
tree age (F = 1.2, p > .05), (Fig. 3B). First order partial auto corre-
lation (PAC1) declined steadily with age PAC-1 in the older trees
(F = 14.3, p < .05) (Fig. 3C). Post-hoc Bonferroni tests indicate that
the signiﬁcant diﬀerences were among the youngest age classes when
paired with all age classes greater than 250 years (Appendix A).
3.2. Response of trees of diﬀerent ages to the climate variability of the most
recent century
Tree age explained 23% of the variation in sensitivity (logarithmic
ﬁt, R2 = 0.23, p < 0.05, n = 96; Fig. 4A [weaker linear ﬁt not
shown]). Logarithmic regression of ﬁrst order autocorrelation (PAC-1)
with age (Fig. 4B) showed a declining trend with age (R2 = 0.26,
p < 0.05, n = 96).
3.3. Relationship of tree age to instrumental summer PDSI response
The greatest increase in variation explained occurs in the ﬁrst two
centuries of tree growth (R2 = 0.36 in trees less than 100, increasing to
R2 = 0.49 in trees between 101–200 years), followed by a steady de-
cline in trees from 200-700+ yr (Table 2).
4. Discussion
Age-related climate sensitivity in trees is a potentially confounding
factor in chronology development. We investigated age-dependent
growth sensitivity in a long-lived species near the northernmost extent
of its distribution. Pinus edulis, Colorado piñon, is a long-lived conifer
(Mirov, 1967) and very old individuals occur frequently in DINO,
especially in undisturbed and ﬁre protected sites (Romme et al., 2013).
The age structure of the population studied here suggests that some of
our oldest trees may be from the pioneering population in the region
that arrived approximately 1100 years BP (Sharpe 2002).
Our results in piñon mirror ﬁndings in Larix decidua, where the
magnitude of climate-growth response functions were lower but in-
creasing in younger trees (< 200years) and stabilized at a higher level
in older trees, up to 600 years (Carrer and Urbinati, 2004). In contrast,
climate accounted for a substantial amount of the variation in ring
growth in Sabina przewalskii, but mean sensitivity (MS) did not change
signiﬁcantly with age (Yu et al., 2008). Trees in this study were com-
parable in age to piñons at DINO (100-500 years) and similar in the
stability of growth sensitivity, yet in this study piñon was less sensitive
in early life stages and more sensitive in later life stages. These diﬀer-
ences highlight the species-speciﬁc nature of tree-climate growth
trends.
There has been some useful discussion on the descriptive statistics
used for evaluating growth response and climate/growth relationships
in tree rings. For this study, we used MS as our primary statistic for
comparative purposes to assess relative growth variability among age
classes. Although widely used, mean sensitivity (MS) has been formally
critiqued as a measure of variable growth response (Strackee and
Jansma, 1992; Bunn et al., 2013). Mean sensitivity continues to be used
widely to describe the inherent variability in tree-ring chronologies that
may be indicative of the potential strength of the climate/growth re-
lationships (Peterson and Peterson, 2001, Carrer and Urbinati 2004,
Linderholm and Linderholm, 2004; Suarez et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2008;
Rozas et al., 2009; Copenheaver et al., 2011). To address the concerns
over the usefulness of the MS statistic we also evaluated trends in other

closely related statistics (coeﬃcient of variation and ﬁrst order auto-
correlation) in piñon of diﬀerent ages.
Growth responses detected in tree-ring widths at DINO by all three
measures (MS, CV, PAC1) suggest that sensitivity of growth to climate
variability changes with age in piñon. All measures of growth sensi-
tivity were lower in early life stages (< 200–250 years), but did not
diﬀer among ages > 200–250 years. In the growth response of in-
dividual trees during the current (20th century) climatic environment,
growth sensitivity to climate was also lowest in younger trees (up to
approximately 250 years in age) and stabilized at a higher level in older
trees.
We used common-period analysis to determine how much of the
variation in growth response could be attributed to the Palmer Drought
Severity Index (PDSI) and whether this varies across age classes
(Table 2); a higher variance explained by PDSI might reﬂect growth
responsiveness to the high frequency component of PDSI. Our data
suggest that there is variation in the responses to PDSI across age classes
(36–56% of variance in growth explained by tree age), although no

strong diﬀerence is apparent in trees less than 200 years (R2 = 0.54)
compared with trees older than 200 years (R2 = 0.48).
While climate-growth relationships are one driver of ring growth
variability, age-dependent physiological factors not addressed in this
study could have equal bearing on growth response. Some evidence
suggests that older trees (> 200 years) may devote more energy pro-
portionally to physiological processes such as masting cone production
(Krebs et al., 2012; Redmond et al., 2016), herbivore defenses, or car-
bohydrate storage as a buﬀer to adverse climate conditions (Huang
et al., 2010), leading to a slight reduction in PDSI response.
Our evidence suggests that patterns of growth response to climate
are age-dependent in this long-lived species. Even with an increasing
trend in climate sensitivity in ring growth as some trees age, the oldest
trees could be responding to internal physiological changes or factors
other than climate variation. The implication is that piñon chronologies
including only centuries-old trees from the DINO area may not be as
robust if the changing sensitivity of younger trees is not accounted for.
This study suggests that trees of all ages should be utilized in chron-
ology building and dendroclimatology studies.
