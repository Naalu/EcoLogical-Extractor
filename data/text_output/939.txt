Abstract.
Statistical descriptions of reconstructed ﬁre regimes are often extrapolated from a composite of
small forest stands to represent extensive geographical areas. However, statistical properties of ﬁre regimes
are scale-dependent, thus causing some extrapolations from ﬁne scale to coarse scale and comparisons
between ﬁre-scar-based reconstructions to be inappropriate. We assessed landscape ﬁre regimes of the
Sacramento Mountains, in southern New Mexico, using dendrochronological methods and a variety of ﬁre
statistics and analysis ﬁlters. We reconstructed historical and recent ﬁre regimes for the Mescalero Apache
Tribal Lands (MATL) at tree and site scale (25 ha). We then estimated the Sacramento Mountains historical
and recent ﬁre regimes by combining paleo ﬁre data from this study with published data from the adjacent
Lincoln National Forest (LNF). We applied ﬁlters to provide ﬁre statistics that are relatively unbiased to
the different spatial measurement extent of the studies. This is the ﬁrst study to assess ﬁre regime in the
MATL over multiple spatial and temporal scales. The results show that frequent surface ﬁres occurred at
all scales in the Sacramento Mountains until ﬁre was excluded from the landscape in the early 1900s.
Historical ﬁres were found to be synchronous with drought years, typically La Ni~na events, and often
preceded by wet years. We did not ﬁnd evidence supporting differences in ﬁre regimes between the MATL
and the LNF, suggesting that ﬁre cessation following intensive Euro-American settlement was widespread.
The interruption of frequent surface ﬁres, together with other changes in forest structure and climate, pose
a signiﬁcant threat to sustainability of forest ecosystems on Native American tribal lands.

INTRODUCTION
Landscape ﬁre ecology is the study of ﬁre at
multiple
scales,
both
spatial
and
temporal
(McKenzie et al. 2011). Fires have shaped and
continue to shape ecosystems at different spatial
scales, generating the highly diverse forest struc-
ture and landscape mosaic found in ponderosa
and mixed conifer forests. The southwestern Uni-
ted States has the world’s highest density of ﬁre-
scar-based reconstructions, but most ﬁre statistical
outcomes from reconstruction studies are extrapo-
lated from a composite of small forest stands to
represent extensive geographical areas or moun-
tain ranges. Statistical properties of ﬁre regime,
such as mean ﬁre interval (MFI), are spatially
explicit
and
scale-dependent
(Swetnam
and
Baisan 1996). Extrapolation from ﬁne-scale ﬁre-
scarred tree studies to coarse-scale regional pat-
terns can be inaccurate (Morgan et al. 2001).
Altered ﬁre regimes often lead to a cascade of
ecological effects (Leopold 1924). Southwestern

U.S. landscapes have experienced major alteration
of ﬁre regimes since the late 19th century due to
the introduction of livestock grazing, selective
logging, and ﬁre suppression (Allen et al. 2002,
Swetnam
and
Baisan
2003).
Geographically
and/or policy isolated landscapes offer examples
of ﬁre regime contrasts. For example, Baisan and
Swetnam (1995) and Fule et al. (2012) carried out
comparisons across the international U.S./Mexico
border of mountain ranges with similar topogra-
phy, climate, ﬁre-adapted ecosystems, and histori-
cal ﬁre frequency. While the U.S. sites underwent
ﬁre interruption in the late 19th century, ﬁres per-
sisted up to the 21st century in the Mexican sites.
This divergence was explained by differences in
land use between the two countries: early, heavy
grazing, and effective ﬁre suppression on the U.S.
side vs. extensive agricultural management and
minimal ﬁre suppression on the Mexican side
(Marshall 1962). Native American Tribal Lands
are also examples of landscapes isolated by geog-
raphy and/or policy. In Arizona, Stan et al. (2014)
reconstructed pine forest ﬁre regimes on Hualapai
Tribal Lands, a sovereign Native American nation
that has implemented frequent prescribed ﬁres
since the 1960s. In contrast with the continuous
public land forest management of ﬁre suppression
policy since early 1900s, the Hualapai tribe has
used prescribed ﬁre for the last six decades as a
forest management tool, a practice encouraged by
leadership in the Bureau of Indian Affairs at the
time (Weaver 1951, Stan et al. 2014). Geographical
differences in ﬁre regime were reported by Savage
and Swetnam (1990) and Whitehair et al. (2018)
on the Navajo Nation, the largest sovereign
Native American nation in the United States,
where landscapes differed from public lands in
ﬁre regime as early as the 1830s likely due to dif-
ferences in sheep pastoralism. Apache lands in
Arizona were considered examples of continued
ﬁre regimes into the 20th century (Weaver 1951,
Cooper 1960), and the San Carlos Apache Tribe is
a national leader in applying wildland ﬁre as a
management tool (Pyne 2014).
The Sacramento Mountains (NM) have both
policy and geographic isolation, offering a poten-
tial example of ﬁre regime contrast. The mountain
range is a Sky Island, an isolated forested moun-
tain surrounded by desert. Brown et al. (2001)
reconstructed the historical ﬁre regime across an
elevational gradient of woodland, ponderosa, and
mixed conifer forests in the Lincoln National
Forest (LNF), adjacent to the Mescalero Apache
Tribal Lands (MATL). They did not ﬁnd conclu-
sive evidence of Native American-induced ﬁre,
but Kaye and Swetnam (1999) in a canyon near
the MATL interpreted the locations and timing of
certain ﬁre events as evidence of ﬁre use by
Mescalero Apache people. Asynchronous ﬁre
dates among neighboring sites and ﬁre frequency
change in areas highly used by Native Americans
were hypothesized to be related to indigenous ﬁre
use (Kaib et al. 1996, Morino 1996, Seklecki et al.
1996). Given the differences in ﬁre management
policy observed on many Native American lands
in the Southwest and the geographic isolation of
the
Sacramento
Mountain
range,
we
asked
whether they resulted in differences in the histori-
cal ﬁre regime. The combination of annually
resolved ﬁre data from multiple studies, including
the previous work in the region by Brown et al.
(2001) and Kaye and Swetnam (1999), provides a
valuable means to extend ﬁre reconstructions to
large landscapes (Metlen et al. 2018) and regions
(Falk et al. 2011). We used this approach to study
ﬁre regimes at the mountain range scale.
We reconstructed ﬁre regimes on the MATL at
multiple spatial and temporal scales to increase
our understanding of forest ﬁre in Native Ameri-
can tribal lands and assess landscape ﬁre ecology
for discerning future management options. The
objectives of the present study were (1) to recon-
struct the ﬁre regimes at tree and site scale on the
MATL, (2) to relate ﬁre regimes with climate
and/or human drivers, and (3) to compare the
MATL ﬁre regimes with adjacent National Forest
ﬁre regimes and reconstruct the Sacramento
Mountains ﬁre regime.
STUDYAREA
The MATL is located in the Sacramento Moun-
tains in south-central New Mexico. The Apache
historically ranged over vast areas in the south-
western United States and northern Mexico (Son-
nichsen 1973). The Mescalero Apache Reservation
was established in 1873. The tribe is a sovereign
nation that is comprised of three sub-tribes: Mes-
calero, Chiricahua, and Lipan Apache.
The climate is semi-arid with an average
annual precipitation of 640 mm occurring mostly
in the summer, during the monsoon season

(June–September), jointly with frequent lightning
strikes. The highest temperatures occur in June
averaging
26°C
and
minimum
temperatures
reach 6.8°C in December–January (temperature
averages from three climate stations in and near
the Sacramento Mountains. Stations are: Mesca-
lero at 1897 m, Cloudcroft at 2639 m, and Rui-
doso at 2097 m; data from wrcc).
The MATL ranges in elevation from 1200 to
3650 m and includes large landscapes of mixed
conifer forests, pinyon–juniper woodlands, desert
shrubs, and grasslands. The highest and coolest
north-facing slopes are dominated by mixed coni-
fers including Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii
Mirbel Franco), southwestern white pine (Pinus
strobiformus Engelm.), and white ﬁr (Abies concolor
Gord. & Glend. Lindl. ex Hildebr. var. concolor).
Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) is
found in post-stand replacing wildﬁre areas.
Above 2000 m, the dominant plant species is the
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum
Engelm.), frequently accompanied by oak (Quer-
cus sp.). On mid-elevations, 1300–2100 m, pon-
derosa pine stands are surrounded by woodland,
where one-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma
Engelm. Sarg.) and pinyon pine (Pinus edulis
Engelm.) are the dominant species. At lower
elevations, grasslands are dominated by blue
grama (Bouteloua gracilis Willd. ex Kunth. Lag. ex
Grifﬁths) associated with other grasses and by
semi-desert brush in poor soil conditions, primary
mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa Torr. var. glandulosa),
cholla (Cylindropuntia spp.), and yucca (Yucca bac-
cata Torr. var baccata).
METHODS
Field sampling
We established eight ﬁre scar sampling sites in
2015 and 2016 in the ponderosa and dry mixed
conifer forest to characterize ﬁre regimes at tree
and site scale in the MATL (Fig. 1). To represent
the geographic range and forest diversity, we
used a vegetation cover map and ﬁeld reconnais-
sance to locate potential sampling sites. Sites
were ﬁrst inspected to ensure that they retained
tree-ring evidence from old trees, mostly in the
form of stumps. We avoided sampling on recent
severe wildﬁres because of the loss of old wood
(Swetnam
and
Baisan
1996),
although

burned site (Turkey Canyon) was included in
order to maintain an adequate geographical rep-
resentation across the MATL.
Each site was 25 ha (500 9 500 m) in size, for a
total of 200 ha sampled. We thoroughly searched
each site for ﬁre-scarred trees and cut partial cross
sections from scarred snags, logs, and stumps of
conifers that apparently contained more extensive
ﬁre records. We collected 192 partial cross sections
with a chainsaw, ten of which were from living
trees. This procedure does not require felling the
tree and rarely damages large pine trees (Heyer-
dahl and McKay 2001). The characteristics of the
study sites are summarized in Table 1.
Laboratory methods
We mounted and sanded the samples until the
cell structure was clearly visible under a binocular
microscope. We crossdated the samples visually
using characteristic patterns of narrow marker
years (Stokes and Smiley 1968). We used a master
tree-ring chronology developed in Sacramento
Mountains to crossdate the samples (M. Wilkinson
Kaye, C. H. Baisan, T. W. Swetnam-West Side
Road Sacramento Mountains-PIPO-ITRDB NM573.
Online resource: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/
study/5253 [Kaye et al. 2002]). We measured the
tree-ring widths of each sample and checked the
crossdating with the COFECHA software program
(Holmes 1983). We estimated the season of ﬁre
occurrence based on the relative position of each
ﬁre lesion within the annual ring according to the
following categories: EE (early earlywood), ME
(middle earlywood), LE (late earlywood), L (late-
wood), and D (dormant; Baisan and Swetnam
1990). We assigned scars positioned at the ring
boundary to the following year. We listed the ﬁre
scar as undetermined when the position of the scar
was not clear.
Statistical analysis
Fire at tree scale.—We analyzed the individual
tree scale ﬁre regime in the MATL calculating the
point MFI as the best estimator of single-tree ﬁre
interval (Dieterich 1980, Van Horne and Fule
2006). We calculated the distribution of tree ﬁre

intervals for all recording years and within a
commonly used analysis period, from 1700 to
1900.
Fire at site scale.—We analyzed ﬁre recurrence
at site scale using the R package burnr (Malevich
et al. 2015). We analyzed each site starting at the
ﬁrst ﬁre year recorded by two or more of the
total number of recording trees at each site.
Recording trees are those with open ﬁre scars or
other injuries (e.g., lightning scars); the presence
of these open wounds makes the trees more
likely to record scars in subsequent ﬁres (Swet-
nam and Baisan 1996).
We carried out the statistical analysis by site
with three ﬁlters: (1) all ﬁre years, with at least
two scarred sample trees; (2) ﬁre years in which
10% or more of the recording sample trees were
scarred; and (3) ﬁre years in which 25% or more
of the recording sample trees were scarred, rep-
resenting extensive ﬁre years (Swetnam and Bai-
san 1996). For each ﬁlter, we calculated the MFI,
as well as the standard deviation and minimum–
maximum ﬁre intervals. We also calculated the
Weibull median probability interval, considered
a better estimator than MFI because ﬁre intervals
are often not normally distributed (Grissino-
Mayer 2001).
Fire–climate relationship
We evaluated the ﬁre–climate relationship dur-
ing reconstructed ﬁre events as well as antece-
dent and subsequent years with two proxy
indices: one of drought, Palmer Drought Severity
Index (PDSI: Cook et al. 2004), and one of the El
Ni~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Index (Ni~no-3
Sea Surface Temperature; Cook 2000).
We analyzed the inﬂuence of mean climate on
ﬁre occurrence with a non-parametric statistical
tool, Superposed Epoch Analysis (SEA: Swetnam
1993), using the R package burnr (Malevich et al.
2015) to test the null hypotheses that there is no
relationship between climate conditions and ﬁre
occurrence in years prior, during, and after ﬁre
years. We determined signiﬁcant climate anoma-
lies using bootstrap simulation because anomalies
from average climate conditions are associated
with ﬁre occurrence. Superposed Epoch Analysis
was used to assess ﬁre as a response of drought
and ENSO for 5 yr pre-ﬁre and 2 yr post-ﬁre, a
period that covers the range of ENSO oscillations
(Grissino-Mayer 2001).
We carried out statistical analysis considering
the same three different ﬁlters (≥2%, ≥10% and
≥25%) described in the section above.
Fire at Sacramento Mountains landscape scale
We estimated the ﬁre regime at mountain
range scale by combining the data from all eight
sites within the MATL and 17 sites previously
collected in the adjacent LNF (Kaye and Swet-
nam
1999,
Brown
et al.
2001;
Fig. 1).
We
obtained the LNF ﬁre scar chronologies from the
International
Multiproxy
Paleoﬁre
Database
(www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search).
To compare our results at the MATL with the
results previously obtained at the LNF, we deter-
mined a common temporal and spatial scale. We
selected a period of analysis from 1700 to 1900
for all the MATL and the LNF sites together. This
period was analyzed because there was adequate
sample depth across sites to 1700 and because
ﬁre was generally excluded from the landscape
by 1900. Our eight study sites had the same grain
(tree) and measurement extent (25 ha), but the
Kaye and Swetnam (1999) and Brown et al.
(2001) study sites ranged from 10 to 30 ha. The
25%-scarred
ﬁlter
eliminates
ﬁre
dates
that
appear only in one or few samples, providing a
ﬁre statistic that is relatively consistent over a
range of scales (Van Horne and Fule 2006).
RESULTS
Mescalero Apache Tribal Lands fire regime
reconstruction
We collected 192 partial cross sections from
three
species:
ponderosa
pine,
southwestern
white pine, and Douglas-ﬁr (Table 1). Nineteen
could not be crossdated because of a short ring
series and/or wood deterioration; these cross sec-
tions were excluded from the study. The earliest
ﬁre date was 1549, and the latest was 2004. Dur-
ing this period, we identiﬁed 1138 ﬁre scars rep-
resenting 114 distinct ﬁre years. The oldest
sample was from a 150 cm diameter ponderosa
pine that lived from 1372 until at least 1964 and
recorded 19 ﬁre events. The analysis of ﬁre inter-
vals started in the mid-1600s at most study sites
except for Turkey Canyon (TC), which was
burned in the 1971 Elk Springs Fire, apparently
consuming the oldest evidence of historical ﬁres.
We only found one sample older than 1750. As a

result, the period of analysis for this site starts in
1801.
Fire at tree scale.—Fires were frequent until early
1900s. Trees within site Turkey Pen (TP) recorded
the longest mean and maximum ﬁre interval, 27
and 133 yr, respectively. Trees within sites TC and
Potato Patch (PP) recorded the shortest mean, 12.2
and 12.6 yr, respectively, and shorter maximum
ﬁre interval, 59 and 54 yr, respectively (Fig. 2).
Fire at site scale.—Historical ﬁres were frequent
at the site scale until the early 1900s (Fig. 3).
Trees at three sites (Turkey Spring [TS], Turkey
Track [TT], and PP) did not record any ﬁre after
early 1900s while the rest of the sites experi-
enced at least one recent ﬁre in different time
periods (Fig. 3). The historical MFI ranged from
6 to 18 yr when considering all ﬁres (Table 2),
from 4.4 to 16 yr when considering the 10% ﬁl-
ter, and from 6 to 17 yr when considering the
25% ﬁlter (Table 2). A ﬁre-free gap of 24–26 yr
in the early 1800s was observed at four sites, TS
and Snow Canyon in the north (1806–1832) and
TT and TP in the south (1806–1830). The other
four sites did not show an apparent ﬁre gap
(Fig. 3).
Many extensive ﬁres, ﬁre dates scarring 25%
or more of recording trees, occurred in the
MATL. For example, in 1684, four sites out of the
seven sites with recording samples recorded a
ﬁre. In 1736 and 1773, ﬁve out of the seven sites
with recording samples recorded a ﬁre. The
highest degree of synchrony in ﬁre dates across
the MATL sites was in the 1800s when 58% and
23% of the recording samples recorded a ﬁre in
all eight sites in 1806 and 1836, respectively.
These extensive ﬁres also deﬁned the limits of
the 24- to 26-yr ﬁre-free gap noted above. In the
remaining years of the 1800s, 43%, 36%, and
29% of the samples recorded a ﬁre in 1870, 1879,
and 1893, respectively, in seven of the eight sites
(Fig. 3).
Fire–climate relationship
Fires tended to occur in drought years along
with a wetter than normal condition two years
before ﬁre. The results of the SEA for all the
MATL sites indicate that ﬁres occurred in signiﬁ-
cantly lower than average moisture (PDSI 99%
conﬁdence interval [CI]) when considering all
ﬁre events (Fig. 4a), ﬁre events scarring 10% or
more of recording trees (Fig. 4b), and ﬁre events
scarring 25% or more of recording trees (Fig. 4c).
Superposed Epoch Analysis results also indicate
a wetter than normal condition (PDSI 95% CI)
two years before ﬁre years when considering ﬁre
events scarring 10% or more of recording trees
(Fig. 4b) and ﬁre events scarring 25% or more of
recording trees (Fig. 4c).
The results of the SEA for all the MATL sites

events for the full data set of the eight MATL
sites plus the 17 LNF sites. The average MFI was
18 with a minimum interval of 2 and a maximum
of 33 yr.
Extensive ﬁres occurred until the early 1900s.
The ﬁre scar composite from the MATL and the
LNF shows many synchronous ﬁre years at the
mountain range scale. We identiﬁed 1748, 1773,
1806, 1832, 1847, and 1879 as extensive ﬁre years
within the Sacramento Mountains. Five of the six
extensive ﬁre years correspond to regional years
described by Swetnam and Baisan (2003; Fig. 5).
Small ﬁres, burning one or two sites, were
numerically dominant. The ﬁre-size distribution
as inferred from the number of sites burned was
skewed indicating a higher number of small ﬁre
years (Fig. 5).
Fire dates were highly synchronous between
the MATL and the LNF during drier than normal
years. Our ﬁndings show that the MATL and the
LNF samples recorded ﬁre in unison during
years with PDSI values ranging from moderate,
2, to extreme, 4.9, droughts (Fig. 6).
Fire seasonality was similar in the MATL and
the LNF. Fires in the MATL occurred mostly dur-
ing the dormant to early growing season. From
the 1138 total number of ﬁre scars, we were able
to identify the seasonality of 62% of the ﬁre scars.
The 28% of the ﬁre events occurred during dor-
mant season, 30% during early-earlywood, 22%
during mid-earlywood, 11% occurred during
late-earlywood, and 10% during latewood. Fig. 7
summarizes the ﬁre seasonality for MATL and

portions between the MATL and the LNF could
be due to subjective differences in the den-
drochronologists’ criteria in the assignment of
the scar position.

DISCUSSION
The overall goal of our ﬁre reconstruction
study was to estimate tree-to-mountain range ﬁre
regimes, from spatially explicit measurements.
On the MATL, ﬁres were frequent and often
extensive. Fire was the dominant disturbance in
ponderosa and mixed conifer forests in the
MATL, occurring at least on a 20-yr interval. The
ﬁre intervals in our study are consistent with
other ﬁre reconstructions in ponderosa and
mixed
conifer
forests
(Swetnam
and Baisan
2003). The highly ﬁre-scarred trees indicate that
low severity ﬁres, predominantly surface ﬁres,
removed ﬁne fuels, seedlings, and saplings and
maintained an open ponderosa-dominated old-
growth forest. The severity of these ﬁres cannot
be measured directly, but the fact that individual
trees survived dozens of burns indicates that
they
were
predominantly
low-severity
ﬁres.
Many
ﬁres
were
synchronous
within
and
between sites showing that ﬁres were extensive
in many cases. In addition, numerous localized
ﬁres burned in interspersed sites which suggest
that ﬁres were patchy within the MATL.
A ﬁre-free gap occurred in the early 1800s, but
it was not consistent in all sites. Many studies
have observed a similar ﬁre gap during the late
1700s and early 1800s, also known as late
eighteenth early nineteenth century transition
(LEENT). Grissino-Mayer and Swetnam (2000)
observed a longer than average gap between
1780 and 1794; Kitzberger et al. (2001) and
Skinner et al. (2008) observed a decrease in ﬁre
occurrence between 1780 and 1830 and 1770 and
1800, respectively. These authors suggested that
the unusual gap was related to a change in
ENSO activity that affected the ﬁre–climate

relationship. Farther south in Nuevo Leon, Mex-
ico, Yocom et al. (2010) documented a shift circa
1830 in the ENSO phase associated with ﬁre.
However, numerous other studies in the South-
west have not found evidence of a gap or shift in
the LEENT period in northern Arizona (Fule
et al. 2002, Stan et al. 2014) or northern New
Mexico (Touchan et al. 1996, Rother and Gris-
sino-Mayer 2014). Our study showed that sites
with and without a gap between 1806 and 1830
are interspersed and therefore not necessarily
consistent with a change in ENSO alone. A nota-
ble shift from one of the wettest years in the PDSI
reconstruction, 1816, to one of the driest, 1818,
occurred in the middle of the gap period (Fig. 6).
This type of wet-to-dry shift was associated with
ﬁre years during other time periods, but no ﬁres
burned at the MATL sites in 1818 or nearby
years. While the ﬁre-free gap remains elusive to
explain, it likely had ecological consequences
such as those reported by Brown and Wu (2005)
in Colorado, where pulses of pine regeneration
became established between ﬁres. The ﬁre-free
gap could have allowed the accumulation of con-
tinuous ﬁne fuels and saplings explaining the
extensive ﬁres that occurred in 1832 and espe-
cially in 1836, when all the eight MATL sites
recorded a ﬁre.
There was a clear ﬁre regime alteration after
1900. Three sites do not record any ﬁre after early
1900s while the rest of the sites experienced at
least one recent ﬁre in different time periods.
These recent ﬁres were recorded by multiple
trees within sites but were not synchronous
between sites, which might indicate prescribed
burning or small wildﬁres. This is a generalized

pattern found in other ﬁre reconstruction studies
in southwestern ponderosa and mixed conifer
forests (Swetnam and Baisan 2003). In addition
to a strict policy of ﬁre control beginning in the
early twentieth century (Pyne 1982), livestock
such as sheep, cattle, and horses overgrazed
grasses and selective old-growth logging chan-
ged forest structure and fuel loads (Covington
and Moore 1994).
Climate was a major driver of historical ﬁres at
all
scales.
Extensive
ﬁres
were highly
syn-
chronous with La Ni~na positive phase of ENSO.
This regional periodic ﬂuctuation inﬂuences ﬁne
fuels availability in Arizona and New Mexico
and explains the synchronous ﬁre activity in the
Southwest (Swetnam and Betancourt 1990). We
also found that historical ﬁres were highly syn-
chronous with a wetter than normal condition
two years before the ﬁre. This was evident in the
analysis of ﬁre events scarring 25% or more of
recording trees but was still important for ﬁre
events scarring 10% or more of recording trees.
Wet years increased ﬁne fuel availability favoring
the spread of ﬁre during dry condition (Swetnam
and Baisan 2003). All six years identiﬁed as the
most extensive ﬁre years at mountain range
scale, 1748, 1773, 1806, 1832, 1847, and 1879,
were consistent with extensive ﬁre years within
the MATL sites, LNF sites, and the list of the top
20 regional ﬁres identiﬁed by Swetnam and Bai-
san (2003) across the Southwest.
Landform, vegetation composition, ignitions,
and the legacy of past ﬁre occurrence were prob-
able drivers of localized ﬁres, since we could not
identify any single factor explaining the variety
of ﬁre interval between sites. Native American-
set ﬁres could also be drivers of historical local
ﬁres, but we could not distinguish human-
caused from lightning-caused ﬁres using the ﬁre-
scarred tree samples. Based on conifers’ cambial
phenology (Stephens et al. 2017), ﬁre scars in
early earlywood to latewood interannual posi-
tion form in the summer, which suggests light-
ning ignition during the summer monsoon,
while ﬁre scars in the dormant position form
during the fall and winter, which Kaye and Swet-
nam (1999) attributed to human ignition.
Although the MATL was recognized as a Native
American sovereign land since the 1870s, the colo-
nial structure of reservations and management
requirements forced the tribe to comply with the
general federal ﬁre policy, which would explain
why there is no evidence of a distinct ﬁre regime
between the MATL and the LNF. Some argued
against the exclusion of surface ﬁres from Native
lands (Weaver 1951) and in a few places in the
Southwest ﬁre continued to be used, on Western
Apache lands (Cooper 1960) and Hualapai lands
(Stan et al. 2014), as well as in some similar forests
in adjacent Chihuahua, Mexico (Fule et al. 2011).
We collected ﬁre-scarred tree samples from
sites with the same scale (grain: tree; extent:
25 ha), which enabled us to establish compar-
isons between sites at tree and site scale. Sample
sites within the LNF had different extent. While
it is not possible to adjust the sizes of previously
measured sites, it is appropriate to acknowledge
this potential source of error. To overcome the
problem of different scales, we selected a com-
mon temporal scale, 1700–1900, and we used a
ﬁlter of 25% or more recording trees for compar-
isons across spatial scale. The ﬁlter eliminates ﬁre
dates that appear only in a few samples, provid-
ing a ﬁre statistic that is relatively indifferent to
the
potential
spatial-confounding
bias

Horne and Fule 2006). The use of a coarse-scale
ﬁlter to analyze ﬁre years from multiple sites
with different spatial measurement scale has
been widely used in the literature to represent
regional ﬁre regimes (Swetnam and Baisan 2003).
The legacy of recent history forest manage-
ment has altered forest fuel loads and has chan-
ged ﬁre behavior in ponderosa and mixed
conifer forest of the southwestern United States.
Fire exclusion in ﬁre-prone forests, coupled with
warming climate (Westerling et al. 2006), has
many negative ecological, cultural, and economic
impacts. Recent ﬁres, such as the 2012 Little Bear
Fire adjacent to the MATL, are not only expen-
sive to contain, but the intensity of the ﬂames is
capable of destroying thousands of houses and
structures. After these severe wildﬁres, ecosys-
tem productivity, timber and non-timber forest
products, and traditional and medicinal plants,
and water resources are degraded.
Severe wildﬁres are predicted to increase sub-
stantially in the next few decades due to warming
climate (Kitzberger et al. 2017). Managers and
policymakers in the southwestern United States
face grave challenges in seeking forest manage-
ment alternatives that conserve natural resources
(Loehman et al. 2018). The reintroduction of ﬁre
in the landscape does have demonstrable effect in
reducing the risk of severe wildﬁres and its
adverse consequences (Walker et al. 2018). The
ﬁndings of our study provide data on the histori-
cal ecological role of ﬁre over multiple scales. Tri-
bal
leaders,
forest
managers,
and
regional
stakeholders can apply landscape disturbance
data together with climate-sensitive ecological
simulation models to develop strategies for forest
restoration and adaptation in warming climate.
