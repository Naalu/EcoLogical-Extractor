Abstract.
We reconstructed historical fire regimes and contemporary and historical stand structures in two stands
of ponderosa pine–mixed conifer forests on the San Francisco Peaks in northern Arizona, USA. Thirty-four fire-
scarred specimens recorded 256 fires from the EAST and WEST study sites. Fires were recorded between 1739
and 1903 for the EAST site and between 1548 and 1947 for the WEST site. The mean fire return interval (MFI:
≥25% scarred) for the period 1690–1892 was 10 years with a range of 3–21 years for the EAST site. The WEST
site MFI (period 1612–1876) was 9 years with a range of 3–21 years. Seasonal patterns of fire occurrence showed
that the majority of fires burned during the summer months. Fire interval (years) means, variances and distributions
between the EAST and WEST sites were not statistically different from one another for the common analysis period
of 1690–1876. Historically, both the EAST and WEST sites were dominated by ponderosa pine, with scattered
individuals of Douglas-fir, limber pine and white fir, with tree densities that ranged from 43 to 60 trees per hectare
(TPH). Current forest composition has shifted from fire-tolerant ponderosa pine to less fire-tolerant, more shade-
tolerant species, with tree densities ranging from 928 to over 1700 TPH. We suggest that the dramatic structural
changes recorded at our study sites occurred since fire regime disruption.

Introduction
Mixed conifer forests of the American Southwest, similar to
other western coniferous forests, have been impacted by fire
exclusion that occurred in the late 1800s and fire suppres-
sion practices of the 20th century (Cooper 1960; Parsons
and DeBenedetti 1979; Arno 1980; Dieterich 1983; Stein
1988a, 1988b; Goldblum and Veblen 1992; Covington et al.
1994; Grissino-Mayer et al. 1995, 2004; Minnich et al. 1995,
2000; Wolf and Mast 1998; Taylor 2000; Beaty and Taylor
2001; Fulé et al. 2003b; Stephens et al. 2003; Swetnam and
Baisan 2003). In the absence of a natural fire regime, many
mixed conifer forests have developed into dense, structurally
homogeneous ecosystems. Individual landscape elements
including meadows, clumpy patches of large trees and aspen
communities have all declined as an interlocking understory
of shade-tolerant and fire-intolerant tree species increased
in density and expanded their ranges (Stein 1988b; White
and Vankat 1993; Johnson 1994; Minnich et al. 1995, 2000;
Brown et al. 2001; Fulé et al. 2003b; Mast and Wolf 2004;
Cocke et al. 2005).
Managers are increasingly interested in describing ref-
erence conditions (Kaufmann et al. 1994; Morgan et al.
1994; Fulé et al. 1997; Landres et al. 1999; Moore et al.
1999), including fire frequency and intensity for both pre-
and post-fire-suppression periods. However, fire history ref-
erence conditions for south-western mixed conifer forests
are incomplete since few fire history studies have been con-
ducted for this type (Dieterich 1983; Grissino-Mayer et al.
1995; Swetnam and Baisan 1996, 2003; Wolf and Mast 1998;
Brown et al. 2001; Fulé et al. 2003a).
Thepurposeofthisstudywastoreconstructthefirehistory
and forest structure of two areas of the ponderosa pine–mixed
conifer forest type on the San Francisco Peaks in northern
Arizona.The fire regime reconstruction includes estimates of
fire intervals and the seasonal timing of fires for the past 300–
400 years, while the forest reconstructions include estimates
of forest composition, tree density, size and age-class. We
asked the following questions:
• What were the characteristics of the past fire regime (fire
frequency, variability, seasonality) between sites located
on opposite sides of the San Francisco Peaks?
• Have fire patterns changed, especially since recent fire
exclusion?

• What is the relationship between the mixed conifer fire
regime and that of the ponderosa pine forest below it?
• How does the current forest composition and structure
data compare with forest conditions at the onset of fire
exclusion?
• How can this information be applied to long-term
management?
Methods
Study area
The San Francisco Peaks are an isolated group of mountain
peaks, occupying an extinct composite volcano in north-
central Arizona (Fig. 1). Rising more than 1800 m above
surrounding desert grassland and pinyon–juniper woodlands,
these mountains support ponderosa pine, montane, subalpine
and alpine plant communities. The montane or mixed conifer
forests on the San Francisco Peaks occupy a zone from
∼2250 to 3000 m between ponderosa pine and spruce–fir
forest types.
This study was conducted on the lower half of the mixed
conifer belt between 2370 and 2700 m.Two 160-ha study sites
were selected on opposing sides of the San Francisco Peaks
within the drier ponderosa pine–mixed conifer zone resulting
in east (north-east aspect) and west (south-west aspect) ori-
ented sites (Fig. 1). Hereafter, these sites are called the EAST
site and theWEST site, respectively.The EAST site is located
on the edge of the southeastern quarter of the San Francisco
Peaks at ∼35◦19′00′′ latitude, 111◦36′30′′ longitude; and
the WEST site is located on the edge of the south-western
quarter of the San Francisco Peaks at ∼35◦18′30′′ latitude
and 111◦43′00′′ longitude. In addition, both sites occurred
entirely within a distinct sub-basin to facilitate logical extrap-
olations about the extent of specific fire disturbances.
Both study sites have similar tree species composition.
The most common tree species are ponderosa pine (Pinus
ponderosa Lawson var. scopulorum Engelm.), Douglas-fir
(Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco var. glauca (Beissn.)
Franco), aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), limber pine
(Pinus flexilis var. reflexa Engelm.) and white fir (Abies con-
color Gordon & Glendinning). White fir is locally absent on
the south- and west-facing flanks of the San Francisco Peaks;
therefore, this species does not occur on the WEST site.
The sites were categorized as ponderosa pine–mixed conifer
based on the dominance of pine in the overstory (sensu Swet-
nam and Baisan 1996). Neither the EAST nor WEST sites
were commercially harvested, although some stumps were
present due to isolated firewood cutting (Timber Atlas on
file, Peaks Ranger District, Coconino National Forest 1996).
Both study sites have similar parent material and soil type.
The soils of both sites are derived from basalt and andesite
parent material. Two closely related Terrestrial Ecosystem
Units (TEUs 653 and 654, USDA Forest Service 1995) form
the majority of soils in each study site. TEU 653 soils are

eutric glossoboralfs occupying areas with average slopes
from 0 to 15%, while TEU 654 soils are lithic glossoboralfs,
which occupy steeper slopes from 15 to 40%.
In general, the precipitation pattern for the mixed conifer
type on the San Francisco Peaks is described as having
a bimodal distribution with 40% falling during the sum-
mer monsoons (July to September) and 60% falling during
the winter months (October to March), averaging 64–72 cm
annually (USDA Forest Service 1995). Annual snowfall
averages 200 cm (USDA Forest Service 1995).
Field methods
We used grid-based sampling (Arno et al. 1995), a type of
systematic targeted sampling (Heyerdahl 1997), to collect

fire-scarred specimens at each 160-ha study site. The grid
points were 350 m apart and the search radius around each
grid point was ∼200 m.
Fire-scarred specimens were taken from stumps, logs,
snags and live trees. We used a chainsaw to extract full cross
sections from stumps and logs and partial cross sections were
taken from snags and living trees (Arno and Sneck 1977). We
sampled primarily dead material to extend fire chronologies
as far back in time as possible (and limit cutting live trees); but
some older live trees were sampled to extend the fire histories
to the present (Baisan and Swetnam 1990). The geographic
location of each fire-scarred specimen was mapped and addi-
tional information about each scar (i.e. stump, log, aspect of
the catface, number of visible scars) was documented.
We also collected tree overstory and seedling data to
describe the forest structure at each study site. Data were
collected on 13 plots on the EAST site and 14 plots on the
WEST site. Each forest structure plot was centered on one
of the grid points described above for fire-scarred specimen
collection; therefore, these plots were systematically located
and relatively evenly distributed across each study site.
Overstory trees were sampled on a fixed 400-m2 (11.28 m
radius) circular plot, while seedlings were tallied on a nested
40-m2 plot(3.57 mradius).Anytreereaching1.37 minheight
ordiameterbreastheight(DBH;treediameterat1.37 mabove
ground level) was included in the overstory tree component.
For living and dead overstory trees in each plot, we recorded
the species, condition class (e.g. live, declining, recent snag,
down log, stumps; see Maser et al. 1979;Thomas et al. 1979)
and size (diameter at 40 cm above ground level and at DBH).
We also cored overstory trees to determine the age struc-
ture, which is discussed in more detail below. All trees below
1.37 m in height at DBH were added to the tree regenera-
tion category. We tallied tree regeneration by species and
by three height classes: (1) <40 cm; (2) 40.1–80 cm; and
(3) 80.1–137 cm.
We were interested in assessing changes in forest com-
position and structure between trees established prior to the
fire regime disruption date (defined as 1892–EAST site and
1876–WEST site; termed presettlement trees for this study)
and those trees established after fire exclusion (defined as
post-settlement trees). We determined a presettlement–post-
settlement tree diameter breakpoint of 40 cm (at DBH) for all
tree species in this study using locally developed diameter–
age relationships (Heinlein 1996). Conservative identifica-
tion of presettlement trees in the field ensured that all trees of
presettlement origin were cored to determine tree age. Previ-
ous research in northernArizona showed that ponderosa pines
with DBH ≥37.5 cm or ponderosa of any size with yellowed
bark could be conservatively identified in the field as being of
pre-1880 origin (White 1985; Mast et al. 1999).Tree status of
pre- or post-settlement was later corrected in the laboratory
using age data. In addition, a random 10% subsample of all
post-settlement trees was cored on each plot.
Coring height was 40 cm above ground level. This coring
height was chosen to meet two objectives: first, to measure
tree age, and second, to measure growth between the fire
regime disruption date and the present (needed for forest
reconstruction). We recognize that the ideal coring height
for age is ground level, and that the 40 cm coring height is
a compromise that allowed us to core above the butt swell
of the trees, but low enough on the tree bole to obtain reli-
able growth measurements (Fulé et al. 2003a). Finally, we
destructively sampled 30 seedlings of each tree species to
develop age–height relationships at the 40 cm coring height
(Heinlein 1996).
Laboratory methods
Fire scars
In the laboratory, fire-scarred specimens were air dried
and then cut to a uniform thickness (5 cm) with a table saw.
The specimens were then mounted on plywood and repeat-
edly surfaced with finer-grained grit (up to 400 grit) using an
electric belt sander until the cells were visible.
The fire scars within the annual rings were measured with
anAcu-Rite glass scale and encoder with 2 µm precision and
Measure J2X software. Then all fire scar specimens were
cross-dated using standard techniques (Stokes and Smiley
1968; Graybill 1987). The COFECHA program (Grissino-
Mayer and Holmes 1993) was used to assist with cross-dating
when necessary. In addition, all fire-scarred specimens were
visually cross-dated by another dendrochronologist.
Fire scars were dated to year and then identified to season
of fire occurrence based on the relative position of each fire
scar within the annual ring (Dieterich and Swetnam 1984;
Baisan and Swetnam 1990). Fire seasonality was catego-
rized using the following codes: D, dormant (fire scar located
between previous year’s latewood and the current year’s ear-
lywood); E, earlywood (fire scar located between in the early
one-third portion of the earlywood); M, middle earlywood
(fire scar located in the middle portion of the earlywood);
L, late earlywood (fire scar located in the latter one-third
of the earlywood); and A, latewood (fire scar located in the
latewood) (Grissino-Mayer 2001). Scars were also grouped
into spring fires (dormant + early earlywood) and summer
fires (middle earlywood + late earlywood + latewood). Dor-
mant fires are generally considered to be spring fires in the
Southwest (Baisan and Swetnam 1990).
Forest structure
Tree increment cores were mounted and surfaced with
increasingly finer sandpaper. Then all tree increment cores
were visually cross-dated using standard techniques (Stokes
and Smiley 1968; Graybill 1987).Tree rings were counted on
cores that could not be cross-dated, especially for younger
trees. Additional years to the center were estimated with

a pith locator (concentric circles matched to the curvature
and density for the inner rings) for cores that missed the pith
(Applequist 1958).
Past forest structure (or presettlement) was reconstructed
to the fire regime disruption date for each site, which was
determined from the fire scar data (above). The disruption
date was determined to be 1892 for the EAST site and 1876
for theWEST site (Figs 2, 3). Forest structure in 1892 or 1876
was reconstructed using dendroecological methods following
methods described in detail by Fulé et al. (1997, 2002), and
summarized here. First, tree size at the time of fire exclu-
sion was reconstructed for all living trees by subtracting the
radial growth measured on increment cores since 1892 or
1876, for the EAST and WEST sites, respectively. To esti-
mate past growth for living trees without increment cores
(rotten centers), we used locally developed species-specific
relationships between tree diameter and basal area increment
and applied these relationships to estimate growth. For dead
trees (e.g. snags, logs), the date of death was estimated based
on tree condition class using diameter-dependent decompo-
sition rates (Maser et al. 1979; Thomas et al. 1979; Rogers
et al. 1984) or historical harvesting records for stumps. To
estimate growth between the fire exclusion date and death
date, we used the same species-specific growth relationships
discussed above to estimate past diameters.
Data analyses
Fire scar dates were entered into a database, composite
fire chronologies were created (Dieterich 1980), and statis-
tical analyses of the fire return interval distributions were
performed on each site using the FHX2 fire analysis soft-
ware (Grissino-Mayer 1995, 2001). We created master fire
chronologies (graphs) for each site that depict the temporal
patterns of past fires (Dieterich 1980). Statistical analyses
of the fire return interval distributions were based on the
202-year period from 1690 to 1892 for the EAST site and
the 264-year period from 1612 to 1876 for the WEST site.
Some fire-scarred specimens recorded fires as far back as the
mid-16th century, but we considered the initial start date in
the analyses to be the first fire event that scarred at least three
recording trees at each site.This represented a minimum sam-
ple depth of 15% of the total sample size at each site. Ending
dates were selected based on the number of recording trees
and the interruption of the frequent fire regime and historical
changes in land use due to livestock grazing in the Flagstaff
area (Dieterich 1980; Schlegel 1992; Fulé et al. 1997).

period of each scarred specimen; vertical bars are fire events.Years in which fires scarred 10% or more of the specimens are shown on the lower axis.
The statistics used to describe the fire interval distribu-
tions were: the mean fire interval (MFI), the median fire
interval and theWeibull median probability interval (WMPI).
The MFI and the median are the average and the median,
respectively, number of years between fire dates during each
period of analysis; while the WMPI is the 50 percentile value
(median) of a non-symmetrical distribution (Johnson andVan
Wagner 1985; Grissino-Mayer 1999). The WMPI may be the
preferred statistic over the MFI since fire return intervals are
rarely normally distributed, although values are often similar
(Grissino-Mayer 1999).
We evaluated probable fire extent within each site by
examining the number of recorder trees scarred during a fire
event.To estimate the extent, fire scar data are filtered to look
at progressively greater proportional scarring. This approach
has been widely used to assess the ability of fire to spread
within a study site (Swetnam 1990; Swetnam and Baisan
1996; Fulé and Covington 1997; Veblen et al. 2000; Baker
and Ehle 2001; Fulé et al. 2003a, 2003b; Grissino-Mayer
et al. 2004). First, any fire year is considered, even those
represented by a single scarred specimen (termed ‘any’; no
filter). Second, those fire years were examined in which 10%
or more and 25% or more of the recording specimens were
scarred (Swetnam and Baisan 1996).When sample size is less
than ten specimens, then the ‘any scars’ and ‘10% scarred’
give the same answer.
We compared fire interval distributions between the
EAST and WEST sites during the common analysis
period of 1690–1876. The fire return interval distribu-
tions from the EAST and WEST sites were tested for
significantly different means (t-test using two-tailed with
unequal variances), variances (F-test) and distributions
(Kolmogorov–Smirnov test). The alpha level for all tests
was 0.05.
We also compared fire occurrence at the EAST and
WEST sites with that of the nearby Chimney Spring (CS)
site (Dieterich 1980). The CS area is a pure ponderosa for-
est located at ∼5.5 km south-east and at a lower elevation
(∼2270 m) than the WEST site (Fig. 1). We used the same
common period of 1690–1876 for the comparison of the
EAST and WEST sites with the CS site.
Last, we calculated the structural characteristics of trees
per hectare (TPH) and basal area (BA; m2/ha) for the
post-settlement (current) and presettlement (reconstructed)
forest by species for the EAST and WEST sites. Differences
in structural characteristics on the same plots over time (that
is, current and reconstructed) were compared using multivari-
ate analysis of variance (MANOVA). The alpha level for all
forest structure tests was 0.05. If an overall significant differ-
ence was detected (Wilk’s lambda statistic), univariate F-test
results were explored for significant differences by individual
species.

Results
Fire scar data
We cross-dated a total of 34 fire-scarred specimens, which
had recorded 256 fire scars from the EAST and WEST sites
combined (Table 1). Master fire chronologies for both San
Francisco Peaks study sites are summarized in Figs 2 and 3.
EAST study site
Although the first fire recorded on the site occurred in
1639, the fire history was reconstructed for the period 1690–
1995 from 18 fire-scarred trees (Fig. 2). Fires occurred
frequently until 1892. The EAST site also recorded a fire
in 1903, but it scarred only two recorder trees and these two
trees were adjacent to one another (Fig. 2; specimens SFPE6
and SFPE7). The following statistics apply to the 1690–1892
period: the MFI calculated from the ‘any fire’ category was
5.2 years (Table 1), while theWMPI for the same data was 4.7
years. For fires scarring 25% or more of the samples, MFI
increased to 10.0 years and WMPI was 9.3. The minimum
fire-free interval was 1 year, maximum 17 years, rising to
3 and 21 years, respectively, under the ‘25%-scarred’ filter.
The ratio (2.0) between the ‘25%-scarred’and the ‘any scars’
WMPI categories indicates that about half (51%) of the fires
were relatively large (Table 1) (Fulé et al. 2003b).
Table 1.

Statistical analysis was carried out in three categories: (1) any fire year represented by a single fire scar (any scars); (2) fire
years in which 10% or more of the recording trees were scarred; and (3) fire years in which 25% or more of the recording
trees were scarred. MFI = mean fire interval; WMPI =Weibull median probability interval. Sample size of recorder trees is:

Fire seasonality was determined on 43% of the samples
(Table 2). The majority of intra-ring position fire scars were
not classified because of such factors as very small rings and
decay. Few samples recorded dormant season fires (6%) and
none recorded latewood fires.Twenty-two percent of the fires
burned in the spring and the majority (78%) occurred during
the summer months.
WEST study site
Fires were detected as far back as 1548 on this site. The
fire history was reconstructed for the period 1612–1995 from
16 fire-scarred trees (Fig. 3). Fires occurred frequently until
1876. Only one scar occurred after 1876 (in 1947). The fol-
lowing statistics apply to the 1612–1876 period: the MFI
calculatedfromthe‘anyfire’categorywas5.4years(Table1),
while the WMPI for the same data was 5.1 years. For fires
scarring 25% or more of the samples, MFI increased to 9.1
years andWMPI was 8.8.The minimum fire-free interval was
2 years, maximum 13 years, rising to 3 and 21 years, respec-
tively, under the ‘25%-scarred’filter. The ratio (1.7) between
the ‘25%-scarred’ and the ‘any scars’WMPI categories indi-
cates that over half (58%) of the fires were relatively large
(Table 1) (Fulé et al. 2003b).
Fire seasonality was determined on 48% of the samples
(Table 2). Few samples recorded dormant season fires (16%)

and none recorded latewood fires. Forty-one percent of the
fires burned in the spring and the majority (59%) occurred
during the summer months. These results suggest that, for
fires where season could be determined, the majority of fires
for both sites occurred in the summer months, but spring fires
occurred more often on the WEST site.
Fire regime comparisons between sites
The fire interval (years) means, variances and distributions
between the EAST and WEST sites were not statistically dif-
ferent from one another for the common analysis period of
1690–1876 (Table 3). The synchrony of the mean fire inter-
vals and distributions for the EAST site and Chimney Spring
were statistically different from one another, but the variances
were not. The mean fire intervals, variances and distributions
between the WEST and Chimney Spring sites were statis-
tically different from one another. Therefore, these results
suggest that the fire intervals of the EAST and WEST sites
were the same, yet the intervals of these lower-mixed conifer
sites were not similar to the pure ponderosa pine site below it.

A common analysis period from 1690 to 1876 was used for all
comparisons. The fire return interval distributions from the EAST and
WEST sites, EAST and CS sites, and WEST and CS sites were tested
for significantly different means (t-test using two-tailed test with
unequal variances), variances (F-test), and distributions
(Kolmogorov–Smirnov test; K-S). P-values are in parentheses

Overstory forest structure
EAST study site
Current and past (reconstructed) forest overstory struc-
tures for the EAST study site are summarized in Table 4. The
current overstory is composed primarily of white fir, pon-
derosapineandDouglas-fir,withwhitefircomprising46%of
the live tree component at 740TPH. Ponderosa pine and white
fir contribute the greatest amount of basal area on the site,
15 m2/ha and 12 m2/ha, respectively. Limber pine and aspen
are scattered and minor components (4%) of the overstory
composition, with the aspen occurring in distinct clumps.
Tree regeneration was moderate with >2100 seedlings or
suckers per ha (Table 5). White fir was the most prolific
species totaling >1460 seedlings/ha (69% of the regenera-
tion) across all height classes. Ponderosa pine and limber
pine contributed 76 seedlings/ha (4%) and 19 seedlings/ha
(<1%), respectively.
Age distributions (center date at the 40-cm sampling
height in 1995) are expressed on a per-hectare basis in Fig. 4a.
Forest distributions on the EAST site were uneven-aged and
generally dominated by relatively young trees that established
during varying periods after fire regime disruption at this
site. Ponderosa pine made up the majority of trees prior to
the fire regime disruption at this site. The earliest establish-
ment dates by species were: ponderosa pine 1716, limber
pine 1886, white fir 1896 and Douglas-fir 1916. Aspen may
not be accurately represented by this distribution due to a
high occurrence of heart rot, which prevents accurate dating,
although the occurrence of aspen was much less frequent on
this site than on the WEST site. It is also important to realize
that these ages were obtained from increment cores taken at
the 40-cm level. The establishment dates of these cohorts are
as much as 11–17 years earlier for ponderosa pine and white
fir and 14–21 years earlier for Douglas-fir. Limber pine may
take as long as 25 years to attain a 40-cm height because

limber pine establishment sites are often dry and rocky. By
applying these correction factors, it appears that population
irruptions of ponderosa pine and white fir began in the early
1890s, with Douglas-fir pulsing ∼10 years later. The limber
pine cohort probably established between 1900 and 1910.
Obviously, trees established and survived prior to the fire
disruption date of 1892 and are the result of favorable cli-
matic conditions, surface fires and safe sites. For example,

the 1860s cohort of ponderosa pine (1866 in Fig. 4a) is likely
the result of fires in the 1850s (perhaps the 1857 fire). But the
regeneration and density of trees after fire regime disruption
on this site is from 10 to 40 times that prior to the late 1800s.
Reconstructed forest overstory structure for the EAST
study site in 1892 forest was dominated by ponderosa pine
with 43 TPH (84%) and the majority (60%) of the BA
(5.5 m2/ha) (Table 4). White fir, Douglas-fir and limber pine
were also part of the presettlement forest composition but
were lesser components. Total TPH were estimated at ∼52 in
1892 and 9 m2/ha of BA.
The current and reconstructed TPH and BA for all species
and totals were statistically different for the EAST site,
except for limber pine and aspen basal areas, which were
not different from current conditions.
WEST study site
Current and past (reconstructed) forest overstory struc-
tures for the WEST study site are summarized inTable 4.The
current overstory is composed primarily of Douglas-fir com-
prising49%ofthelivetreecomponentat491TPH.Ponderosa
pine, limber pine and aspen contribute ∼161 TPH (16%),
177 TPH (18%) and 179 TPH (18%), respectively. Douglas-
fir and ponderosa pine contribute the greatest amount of
basal area on the site, 22 and 17 m2/ha, respectively. Tree
regeneration was moderate with 2419 seedlings or suck-
ers per ha (Table 5). Aspen was the most prolific species
totaling >1940 suckers/ha (80% of the regeneration) across
all height classes. Douglas-fir had 301 seedlings/ha (12%),
while ponderosa pine and limber pine contributed very lit-
tle to regeneration with 18 seedlings/ha (<1%) and 160
seedlings/ha (7%), respectively. White fir did not occur on
the WEST site.
Age distributions (center date at the 40-cm sampling
height in 1995) are expressed on a per-hectare basis in Fig. 4b.
Forest distributions on the WEST site were uneven-aged and
generally dominated by relatively young trees that established
during varying periods after fire regime disruption at this site.
Ponderosa pine made up the majority of trees prior to fire
regime disruption at this site.The earliest establishment dates
by species were: ponderosa pine 1736, Douglas-fir 1766, lim-
ber pine 1776 and aspen 1846.Again, aspen had a high occur-
rence of heart rot, which prevented accurate dating. If we
correctforthefactthattheseincrementcoresweretakenatthe
40-cm level, the establishment dates of the small population
irruption of ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, and limber pine in
1886 may have established around 1869–1875, 1865–1872,
and 1861, respectively, while the larger cohorts of ponderosa
pine and Douglas-fir from 1896 (Fig. 4b) may have estab-
lished closer to 1879–1885 and 1875–1882, respectively.
Again, trees certainly established and survived prior to the fire
disruption date of 1876 and are the result of favorable climatic
conditions, surface fires, and safe sites. For example, the 1846
cohort of limber pine, aspen and ponderosa pine (1846 in
Fig. 4b) is likely the result of fires in the 1830s (perhaps the
1835 fire). Likewise, the 1876 cohort of Douglas-fir, pine
and aspen likely established after fires in the 1860s. But the
regeneration and density of trees after fire regime disruption
in the late 1800s is much greater than that prior to that time.
Reconstructed forest overstory structure for the WEST
study site in 1876 was dominated by ponderosa pine with 25
TPH (48%) and the majority (59%) of the BA (7.3 m2/ha)
(Table 4). Aspen made up 24% of the reconstructed forest
density averaging 12.5TPH, but made up only 10% of the BA
(1.3 m2/ha). This may be due to the small size of the aspen
trees in 1876 on this site or the fast decay rates that made
reconstruction of this species imprecise. Douglas-fir and
limber pine were also part of the reconstructed forest com-
position at ∼7 TPH (14%) each. Total TPH were estimated
at ∼52 in 1876 and 12 m2/ha of BA.
The current and reconstructed TPH and BA for all species
and totals were statistically different for the WEST site.
Discussion
Fire scars
Although the study sites were on opposing sides of the San
Francisco Peaks, the pre-1900s or presettlement mean fire
intervals were similar at both sites (MFI = 10 and 9, EAST
and WEST sites, respectively; ≥25% scarred). The MFIs
determined for these ponderosa pine–mixed conifer sites
are similar to the range of presettlement MFIs reported for
other ponderosa pine, ponderosa pine–oak, ponderosa pine–
mixed conifer and mixed conifer stands in the Southwest
(Table 6). More specifically, when we report any samples
scarred (MFI = 5.2 and 5.4, EAST and WEST sites, respec-
tively), our mean fire intervals are similar to the MFI ranges
reported by Brown et al. (2001) for east side (MFI = 4.8–
13.8) and west side (MFI = 4.1 and 6.4) mixed conifer sites
in the Sacramento Mountains of south-eastern New Mexico,
and similar to the Swamp Ridge mixed conifer MFI (5.5)
reported by Fulé et al. (2003b) in Grand Canyon National
Park. It is not unusual for mixed conifer stands in the South-
west, particularly stands where ponderosa pine is a dominant
overstory component, to sustain fire frequencies similar to
(and sometimes shorter than) lower-elevation pure ponderosa
pine (Swetnam and Baisan 1996, 2003; Brown et al. 2001;
Swetnam et al. 2001).Although our MFIs compare relatively
well with ponderosa pine–mixed conifer sites in Arizona
and New Mexico, they are shorter than the ‘mixed conifer
with ponderosa pine’ sites reported by Grissino-Mayer et al.
(2004; MFI range: 19–30 years) in the San Juan Mountains
of south-western Colorado.
The seasonal distribution of past fires, based on the relative
position of each fire scar within the annual ring, showed that
a majority of fires occurred in the summer months on both
the EAST and WEST sites. The WEST site, however, had a
greater percentage of spring fires than the EAST. Spring fires

in the Southwest would likely occur sometime between late
April and early June, which corresponds to the typical dry
period of late spring; while the summer fires occur between
late June and early September (Grissino-Mayer et al. 1995;
Swetnam et al. 2001).This is not a surprising result, however,
since the north-east-facing EAST site likely retains a snow
pack longer than the WEST, and the drier WEST site likely
has a fuel matrix and microclimate that is more receptive
to early season lightning ignitions. These results should be
viewed with caution as we could not determine season in the
majority of fire scars.
We found a fire disruption pattern at our study sites that
is typical of frequent fire regimes in the northern Arizona
(Swetnam and Dieterich 1985; Swetnam and Baisan 1996,
2003; Fulé et al. 1997, 2003a, 2003b), northern New Mex-
ico (Grissino-Mayer 1995; Touchan et al. 1995; Swetnam
and Baisan 1996, 2003), southern Arizona and New Mex-
ico (Swetnam and Baisan 1996, 2003; Brown et al. 2001)
and in south-western Colorado (Grissino-Mayer et al. 2004).
The pattern is one of an abrupt cessation of widespread sur-
face fires after c. 1900. We noted that fires ended relatively
abruptly around 1892 on the EAST site and around 1876 on
the WEST site (Figs 2, 3). The fire cessation at the EAST site
at 1892 is also the latest date, by five years, of fire exclusion at
any Flagstaff or Grand Canyon study site to date. For exam-
ple, Fulé et al. (1997) report a fire cessation date of 1882
at Camp Navajo (Bellemont, AZ; ∼21 km west of Flagstaff)
and Fulé et al. (2003b) report an 1887 fire cessation date

AZ mixed conifer: fire history and stand structure

at Grandview on the South Rim of Grand Canyon National
Park (∼126 km north of Flagstaff). However, Grissino-Mayer
(1995) and Grissino-Mayer and Swetnam (2000) found that
fire occurrence abruptly ended between 1881 and 1892 at El
Malpais National Monument in north-western New Mexico.
And,interestingly,widespreadfiresoccurredintheponderosa
pine and lower-elevation mixed conifer of the Mogollon
Mountains (Gila Wilderness) of New Mexico in 1892 and
ended in 1904 (Swetnam and Baisan 2003).
Swetnam and Baisan (1996, 2003), Brown et al. (2001)
and Fulé et al. (2003a, 2003b) examined fire chronologies
from a variety of elevations, forest types (ponderosa pine to
spruce–fir) and spatial scales in the Southwest and noted this
same abrupt fire disruption that occurred between the 1870s
and 1900s on their sites. These authors attributed this sud-
den fire regime disruption to the onset of intensive livestock
grazing and associated human land uses in the American
Southwest. Livestock grazing removes grasses and forbs,
which are the fine fuels essential for carrying frequent sur-
face fires (Leopold 1924; Humphrey 1958; Cooper 1960;
Savage and Swetnam 1990). In addition, the numerous trails,
roads, railroad lines and livestock driveways that accompa-
nied early settlement divided the landscape and disrupted fuel
continuity (Swetnam and Baisan 1996; Fulé et al. 1997; Swet-
nam et al. 2001). Although climate plays a major role in fire
regimes, it is not credited for the abrupt fire regime disruption
found throughout the Southwest in the late 1800s and early
1900s. The relationship of the drastic fire regime change and
climatic events during this period are often not synchronous
(Swetnam et al. 2001; Swetnam and Baisan 2003). There is
no doubt, however, that it is a combination of forcing factors,
primarily fire regime change and favorable climatic condi-
tions that allowed more fire-intolerant, more shade-tolerant
tree species to establish, survive and regenerate on these sites
over the past 100+ years (discussed further below).
Although the date of initiation of livestock grazing on the
EASTsideoftheSanFranciscoPeaksisnotwelldocumented,
widespread fires continued to occur in 1879, 1883 and 1892,
indicating that a receptive fuel matrix continued to exist. The
access to the east side (EAST) of the San Francisco Peaks is
more difficult and slopes are steeper than the western side.
This access problem was an important factor in the decision
of several scientific expeditions (e.g. Merriam 1889, 1890)
to ascend on the western side of the San Francisco Peaks
in the late 1800s (Cline 1976). The steeper slopes may have
also deterred livestock grazing on the eastern side of the San
Francisco Peaks, although a bigger deterrent was the lack of
permanent and accessible water sources for livestock. The
south-western (WEST) portions of the San Francisco Peaks
have more springs including Leroux Spring and Chimney
Spring; both were famous watering places for livestock in
the late 1800s (Cline 1976). Swetnam and Baisan (1996,
2003) also noted that fire regime disruption was delayed
until around 1900 in more remote mountain ranges in the
Southwest. The presettlement fire regime may in fact have
ended on the EAST site around 1900. This site recorded a
fire in 1903, but it scarred only two adjacent trees (Fig. 2).
The fire disruption date for the WEST site of 1876 is often
cited as the starting point of fire regime alteration in pon-
derosa pine ecosystems in northernArizona (Dieterich 1980;
Smith 1983; Savage and Swetnam 1990).The 1876 date coin-
cided with the documented introduction of large numbers
of livestock to nearby Fort Valley and Chimney Spring areas
of northern Arizona (Dieterich 1980; Smith 1983; Schlegel
1992).
The presettlement fire regimes of our two ponderosa pine–
mixed conifer sites on the San Francisco Peaks were quite
similar. In contrast, there was a significant difference between
the fire regimes for our mixed conifer sites and the pure
ponderosa pine (Chimney Spring) site below. Although it
is tempting to conclude that fires originating in the nearby
lower-elevation ponderosa pine swept upward into the mixed
conifer stands, this speculation is not supported by our anal-
ysis. An elevational gradient study is needed to confirm such
a speculation. In a gradient study in Grand Canyon National
Park, Fulé et al. (2003a) confirmed that widespread burning
occurred in high-elevation forests only in very dry years when
ponderosa forests were also burning. Brown et al. (2001)
examined the fire history along environmental gradients in
the Sacramento Mountains of New Mexico and found no dif-
ferences in fire frequency between ponderosa pine and mixed
conifer stands and a weak relationship between fire frequency
and elevation.
The precision of the fire history procedures used in this
study and the uncertainties and caveats of interpreting fire-
scar chronologies are discussed by Arno and Sneck (1977),
Swetnam (1990), Swetnam et al. (1999), Baker and Ehle
(2001) and Swetnam and Baisan (2003). We acknowledge
here that there are uncertainties in the fire disruption dates
we report for our study sites due to the decline in fire spec-
imen sample depth through the 20th century. We sampled
primarily dead fire-scarred trees (i.e. stumps, logs, snags) to
maximize the fire chronology depth into the past, but also to
avoid unnecessary impact on living trees. Sampling live trees
allowed us to extend the fire chronology into the 20th century
and, although the sample size was small (n = four to six trees
during this period), all of these living trees recorded fires in
the 1700s and/or 1800s and then suddenly stopped recording
fires in the late 1800s.Therefore, although the declining sam-
ple size is real, we do not feel it greatly affected our ability
to detect 20th century fires.
Another source of uncertainty, and confusion, is that of
the MFI. MFI is a point-based estimate of fire frequency
(Agee 1993). MFIs can be determined for one tree (combi-
nation of all fire scars on one tree) or for an entire study
site (a composite, see Figs 2, 3 for examples). A composite
MFI typically results in a much shorter interval compared
to that of an individual tree. The MFI is not area-explicit

(Swetnam et al. 1999; Baker and Ehle 2001; Swetnam and
Baisan 2003) and, therefore, more fires are encountered as
the size of your study site is increased. One approach used
to reduce this source of error is the filtering approach (fil-
tering the composite MFI to exclude the fires that occur on
less than a determined percentage of trees (Grissino-Mayer
1995)). We used the filtering approach in this study. But, as
Swetnam and Baisan (2003) caution, MFIs ‘estimated from
composite fire-scar chronologies should not be interpreted to
indicate that every square meter burned within the study area,
on average, at those intervals’.
Forest structure
Dendroecological reconstruction showed that forest tree
structure had changed substantially since the fire disrup-
tion dates on both the EAST and WEST sites (1892 and
1876, respectively). Historically, our data suggest that both
the EAST and WEST sites were dominated by ponderosa
pine, with scattered individuals of Douglas-fir, limber pine
and white fir. Present-day species composition has shifted
from being dominated by very fire-tolerant ponderosa pine to
less fire-tolerant, more shade-tolerant Douglas-fir and white
fir (EAST site), a trend seen elsewhere in northern Arizona
(White and Vankat 1993; Fulé et al. 2002; Cocke et al. 2005)
andtheSouthwest(SwetnamandBaisan1996;Swetnametal.
2001). Historically, tree densities on our study sites ranged
from 43 to 60TPH, while current densities have increased and
range from 928 to over 1700 TPH. These historical and cur-
rent tree densities are within the ranges reported from other
ponderosa pine (Fulé et al. 1997; Mast et al. 1999) and mixed
conifer (Fulé et al. 2003a; Cocke et al. 2005) sites in northern
Arizona.
Forest composition and structure are dynamic in any
ecosystem; however, we infer that the dramatic changes we
recorded at our study sites have occurred since fire regime
disruption in the late 1800s.The present-day ponderosa pine-
mixed conifer forests in northern Arizona are denser, more
homogeneous and more fire-intolerant than in presettlement
times and, therefore, more prone to crown fire, insect and
disease outbreaks, and other ecosystem function changes
(Covington et al. 1994; Keane et al. 2002; Fulé et al. 2003a).
The precision of the forest reconstruction procedure used
in this study is discussed by Fulé et al. (1997, 2002, 2003a).
These types of reconstructions are reliable if the forest has
not been disturbed, if the reconstruction period is not exces-
sive relative to the lifespan of the trees, and if evidence of
dead trees is likely to persist (Fulé et al. 2003a). In our study,
neither the EAST nor WEST sites were commercially har-
vested, although some stumps were present due to isolated
firewood cutting (TimberAtlas on file, Peaks Ranger District,
Coconino National Forest 1996). The WEST site had a small
fire in 1947, recorded by a single scar, but otherwise there was
no evidence of fire over the reconstruction period. Individuals
of ponderosa pine had the longest lifespan, although some
Douglas-fir, limber pine, white fir, and even one aspen had
a lifespan longer than the reconstruction period. The per-
sistence of evidence of dead ponderosa pine trees is well
documented in northernArizona (Mast et al. 1999), although
the persistence of other species is not well known, especially
for small trees. However, the striking changes in forest struc-
ture would still be evident from the fire disruption date to the
present, even if groups of small trees had been missed in the
reconstruction.
Conclusions and management implications
The natural range of variability (also known as historical
range of variability or reference conditions) concept has taken
on an increasingly important role in natural resources plan-
ning and management (Morgan et al. 1994; Landres et al.
1999; Moore et al. 1999; Parsons et al. 2000). The underly-
ing theme of this concept is that one must know and manage
within the range of past forest structures, species composition
and disturbance regimes to ultimately restore or conserva-
tively manage an ecosystem.A comparison of the fire regimes
forourstudysitestootherfirehistorystudiesfromthroughout
the Southwest help delineate the natural range of variability
of fire occurrence in south-western ponderosa pine–mixed
conifer ecosystems (Table 6; see also Swetnam and Baisan
1996).
This study demonstrated that the contemporary fire regime
and forest structure of the ponderosa pine–mixed conifer
forests of the San Francisco Peaks, and likely throughout
northern Arizona, lies outside its natural range of variabil-
ity. As a result of the last 100+ years being essentially a
fire-free period, unusually high amounts of ladder, forest
floor and down woody fuels have accumulated. For exam-
ple, Heinlein (1996) found that the EAST site averaged 37
metric tons/ha (s.e.m. ± 10 tons/ha) and the WEST site aver-
aged 95 metric tons/ha (s.e.m. ± 29 tons/ha), respectively, of
forest floor and down woody fuels. Consequently, contem-
porary fires are likely to be less frequent, but more intense
and widespread (Covington et al. 1994; Fulé et al. 2003a,
2003b; Swetnam and Baisan 2003; Grissino-Mayer et al.
2004). Keane et al. (2002) also describe the many cascading
effects of fire exclusion at the stand, ecosystem and land-
scape scales in many Rocky Mountain forested ecosystems.
The information gleaned from these historical fire regimes
on the San Francisco Peaks will help us better understand the
structure, composition and dynamics of the contemporary
mixed conifer forests we have inherited.
