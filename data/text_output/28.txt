Introduction
 It is well documented that small-diameter ponderosa 
pine (Pinus ponderosa) trees have increased in density in 
southwestern forests since the late 1800s. It may be less 
well known, however, that dramatic changes in Gambel 
oak (Quercus gambelii) densities have also occurred dur-
ing this period in these forests. Gambel oak is one of only 
a few deciduous trees in ponderosa pine forests and has 
numerous ecological and human values (Reynolds and 
others 1970). This understory or mid-story tree provides 
mast, forage, and habitat for wildlife and is prized by 
humans for fuelwood and aesthetics (Harper and others 
1985). However, Gambel oak is often passively man-
aged in ponderosa pine forests. This may partly result 
from poorly known treatment effects on Gambel oak or 
a perception that oak abundance has decreased.
Changes in Gambel Oak Densities in 
Southwestern Ponderosa Pine Forests 
Since Euro-American Settlement 
Scott R. Abella and Peter Z. Fulé
 In this note, we review published literature to ascertain: 
(1) changes in Gambel oak densities in ponderosa pine 
forests since Euro-American settlement in the late 1800s, 
(2) the timing and possible mechanisms responsible for 
these changes, and (3) whether data exist to substanti-
ate a hypothesis that densities of large-diameter oaks 
have decreased. We begin by briefly reviewing the basic 
characteristics of Gambel oak’s biology, specifically for 
the frequent-fire pine-oak forests (such as in Arizona and 
New Mexico) that are the focus of this synthesis.
Biological Characteristics
 In ponderosa pine forests, Gambel oak stems can exceed 
36 inches (91 cm) in diameter at breast height and 400 
years in age (Reynolds and others 1970; Swetnam and 
Brown 1992). This clonal oak recruits new stems by vig-
orous sprouting, particularly after existing stems are top 
killed (Brown 1958; Harper and others 1985). Regenera-
tion by seedlings to produce new genets, however, does 
occur. Neilson and Wullstein (1986) found that seedling 
densities ranged from 49 to 534/acre (120 to 1320/ha) on 
15 plots in Arizona and New Mexico pine-oak forests. 
Fire can kill more than 50 percent of small stems less than 
2 inches (5 cm) in diameter (Harrington 1985), but mor-
tality probably decreases with increasing diameter (Fulé 
and others 2005). This observation concurs with Gambel 
oak’s persistence in pine-oak forests that often burned at 
least once every 10 years before Euro-American settlement 
(Fulé and others 1997; Madany and West 1983).
Abstract––Densities of small-diameter ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) trees have increased in south-
western ponderosa pine forests during a period of fire exclusion since Euro-American settlement in the 
late 1800s. However, less well known are potential changes in Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) densities 
during this period in these forests. We reviewed published literature to summarize changes in oak den-
sity in ponderosa pine forests over the past 140 years and evaluated the possibility that large-diameter 
oaks have decreased in density. All nine studies examining oak density changes found that densities of 
small-diameter oaks have escalated. Increases ranged from 4- to more than 63-fold. These increases are 
comparable on many sites to those of ponderosa pine. Studies in northern Arizona, which analyzed cut 
stumps and past and present diameter distributions, did not find strong evidence that large-diameter oaks 
on average have declined in density. However, since oak cutting varied across the landscape, this important 
question needs additional study. Actively or passively managing Gambel oak requires decisions about 
desired future conditions and how to attain them. A possible contention for passive management—that 
the overall abundance of oak has decreased—is not supported by research published to date.

Density Changes
 Our literature review uncovered nine studies recon-
structing Gambel oak densities in the late 1800s in 
southwestern pine-oak forests. We were able to obtain 
numerical data from eight of the nine studies (table 1). 
The other study (Ruess 1995) provided graphical data 
with results consistent with those of the other studies. All 
studies reported increases in Gambel oak densities since 
settlement. Magnitudes of the increases ranged from 16 
to 450 trees/acre (40 to 1112 trees/ha). These increases 
were often comparable to irruptions in ponderosa pine 
densities (table 1). While these studies were performed in 
northern Arizona, except for one in southern Utah, these 
increases are probably representative of upsurges in other 
pine-oak forests due to the nearly ubiquitous exclusion of 
historically frequent surface fires (Grissino-Mayer and 
others 2004). These fires probably partly kept woody 
regeneration in check (Fulé and others 1997).
Timing and Mechanisms for 
Increased Densities
 Data from Fulé and others (1997) provide insight into 
the timing and probable mechanisms for the oak density 
increases. At Camp Navajo in northern Arizona, Fulé and 
others (1997) found that 40 percent of the 32 oaks/acre 
(80/ha) at the site in 1883 were less than 2 inches (5 cm) 
in diameter in 1883. Prior to 1883, frequencies of surface 
fires averaged 4 years, but 1883 represented the start of 
fire exclusion associated with settlement. The authors 
hypothesized that many of the small oaks present in 1883 
would have been killed had frequent fires continued. This 
hypothesis concurs with prescribed burning experiments 
in southwestern Colorado (Harrington 1985) and north-
ern Arizona (Abella and Fulé 2008) that documented 
fire-induced mortality of small stems less than 4 inches 
(10 cm) in diameter. Further augmenting oak densities in 
the study by Fulé and others (1997), a pulse of new stems 
also established from about 1885 to 1914 shortly after fire 
exclusion began. Several factors could have contributed to 
recruitment of these new stems. Pine logging and livestock 
grazing may have reduced tree and herbaceous competition 
with the oaks. Cutting of large oaks possibly stimulated 
dense sprouting. Finally, fire exclusion likely facilitated 
survival of the fire-susceptible small stems. In summary, 
the elevated oak densities of 191/acre (417/ha) at the site 
in 1994 probably arose due to survival of small-diameter 
oaks on-site in 1883, followed by the establishment of new 
stems during a period of fire exclusion.
 Waltz and others (2003) reported a similar sequence 
of events in pine-oak forests in Grand Canyon-Parashant 
National Monument in northern Arizona. Their study 
documented a large irruption in oak density around 
1870 coinciding with the cessation of frequent fires. 
Additional oaks recruited after that time. In south-
ern Utah, Madany and West (1983) hypothesized that 
livestock grazing made grassy interspaces between oak 
clumps more susceptible to invasion by oak stems whose 
survival was facilitated by fire exclusion. Historical pho-
tos also suggest that any early post-settlement increases 
were further augmented by later stem recruitment during 
the 1900s (fig. 1). Stem maps shown in Ruess (1995) 
suggest that oak increases may have resulted from both 
vegetative expansion of existing clones and increased 
seedling establishment.

Large-Diameter Oaks
 Research published to date suggests that densities of 
small-diameter oaks have sharply increased in the past 140 
years in ponderosa pine-Gambel oak forests. Less clear, 
however, is whether large-diameter oaks have dwindled 
because of fuelwood harvest or other factors (Mast 
2003). Diameter distributions at Camp Navajo, Arizona, 
in 1883 and in 1994/1995, suggest that densities of oaks 
greater than 10 inches (25 cm) in diameter have actually 
increased slightly since 1883 (fig. 2). Brischler (2002) 
analyzed densities of oak cut stumps in seven stands on 
the Coconino National Forest in northern Arizona and 
found that stump densities averaged 13/acre (33/ha). 
Figure 1––Ninety-three year photo series of a Gambel oak clump (left center) that increased in density by approximately 
75 percent from 1913 to 2006. The photos were taken near Coulter Cabin in the Coconino National Forest, 12 miles (19 km) 
south of Flagstaff, Arizona. The 1913 photo was taken following a group selection harvest of ponderosa pine. The 1913 and 
1928 photos were taken by Hermann Krauch (U.S. Forest Service photo 16491A), the 1959 photo was taken by M.M. Larson 
(U.S. Forest Service photo LA-86), and the 2006 photo was taken by A.J. Sánchez Meador. Photos provided by A.J. Sánchez

More than 70 percent of stumps, however, were less 
than 8 inches (20 cm) in diameter (inside bark at stump 
height), consistent with the high proportion of live stems 
and snags in these size classes (fig. 3). Brischler (2002) 
hypothesized that harvesting was greater for small- to 
medium-diameter (4 to 8 inch diameter) oaks than for large 
oaks because smaller oaks were more available, easier to 
cut and remove, less likely to be hollow, or less likely to 
be noticed as missing (in the case of illegal cutting). On 
the Kaibab National Forest near the South Rim of the 
Grand Canyon, Fulé and others (2002b) found that oak 
stumps less than 16 inches (40 cm) in diameter averaged 
6/acre (15/ha) compared to 0.7/acre (1.7/ha) for stumps 
greater than 16 inches in diameter.

 In forest reconstruction studies, it is possible that stumps 
from long-ago oak harvesting (for example, at the time 
of settlement) have decomposed and are missing from 
tree density estimates (Brischler 2002, Fulé and others 
1997). However, Fulé and others (1997) noted that old 
oak stumps could be identified on their plots. Their 
observation is corroborated by Long’s (1941) study of 
different-aged fences composed of oak posts in Arizona 
and New Mexico. He found that while 90 percent of the 
fence posts were from oaks less than 7 inches (18 cm) 
in diameter, posts persisted for more than 60 years (the 
oldest fences examined). A study on ponderosa pine by 
Moore and others (2004) provides additional support 
for the accuracy of forest reconstruction methods. By 
comparing reconstructed tree densities with quantita-
tive forest inventory reports from the early 1900s, these 
authors found that reconstruction methods were accurate 
to within 10 percent for ponderosa pine tree density.
 Past oak cutting varied across the landscape, making 
generalizations difficult about the possible losses of 
large oaks due to cutting from place to place (Brischler 
2002). However, evidence has not been published to date 
indicating that densities of large oaks on average have 
diminished, certainly not to the extent that densities of 
large ponderosa pine have diminished due to harvesting 
(Covington and Moore 1994; Mast 2003). Nevertheless, 
additional research is needed to enrich our understand-
ing of the demographics of large oaks in the past and the 
present. Furthermore, consideration should be given to 
conserving existing large oaks because of their ecologi-
cal value for plant and animal habitat (Harper and others 
1985, Reynolds and others 1970).
Management Implications
 On many sites in the past 140 years, small-diameter 
stems of Gambel oak have increased in density as dra-
matically as those of ponderosa pine. Although additional 
research is needed to better understand the long-term 
dynamics of oak density and sprouting under different 
fire frequencies, there is evidence that the exclusion of 
fire since settlement has allowed many of these small 
oak stems to become established. Establishment of these 
stems probably would have been limited had a frequent-
fire regime continued. Prescribed fire or mechanical 
thinning of small oak stems can temporarily reduce oak 
density while stimulating sprouting to provide a variety 
of shrubby and tree forms of oak. However, any type of 
disturbance that stimulates sprouting, but is followed by 
a disturbance-free period, is likely to further increase the 
density of small stems.
 Although published evidence is limited for decreases 
in large Gambel oak since settlement, maintaining exist-
ing large oaks could be a priority because of their high 
ecological value. Tactics to protect large oaks during 
prescribed fire might include avoiding lighting near the 
bases of large oaks and keeping fuels (for example, pine 
slash) away from oaks (Abella and Fulé 2008). To further 
maintain health and crown vigor of large oaks, thinning 
competing trees (such as ponderosa pine) appears effec-
tive (Fulé and others 2005). Due to oak’s clonal habit, it 
is unclear if the small stems that have proliferated since 
settlement compete for resources with large, old oak 
stems. This is an important research need. Managing 
Gambel oak, including the option of passive manage-
ment, requires decisions about desired future conditions 
and how to attain them. A possible reason for passive 
management, that overall oak abundance has decreased, 
is not supported by published research.
