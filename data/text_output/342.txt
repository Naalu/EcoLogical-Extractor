Northern Arizona University physics major Brent Tyc is quite the employee.  
He was recognized as the NAU Student Employee of the Year Award and the first NAU 
student to receive the State of Arizona Student Employee of the Year award.  
The 21-year-old is being acknowledged for his efforts as an undergraduate research 
assistant with the Ecological Restoration Institute, where he played a critical role in the 
collection of forest research data using electronic equipment in the field.  
"Last summer was the first time the ERI began using electronic data collection techniques 
in our remote field sites," said ERI research specialist Chris McGlone.  
McGlone and ERI applications systems analyst Scott Curran, nominated Tyc for the 
awards.  
"Brent took the responsibility of maintaining the computers and electronic equipment, 
managing the data and troubleshooting problems in the field," McGlone said.  
"The isolated nature of these study sites presented a particularly difficult challenge for the 
ERI. Brent often had to find creative methods of problem-solving to make the data 
collection process flow smoothly."  
Curran said Tyc's work saved hundreds of hours of data entry time and also increased 
accuracy.  
"Brent is a person you can count on to get the job done," Curran said.  
Tyc helped field crews collect information such as tree sizes, forest fuel loads and 
vegetation types on more than 100 plots on Mount Trumbull, a remote area in 
northwestern Arizona. He is planning to take a lead role in the training of ERI field staff 
this summer.  
"The awards mean a lot to me," Tyc said. "I've never been honored like this in my life."  
Tyc, an honor student, also has served as a volunteer for Habitat for Humanity, Goodwill 
Industries and the City of Flagstaff Fuels Management Crew. He came to Flagstaff from 
Montgomery, Ala., where he attended Montgomery Catholic High School
