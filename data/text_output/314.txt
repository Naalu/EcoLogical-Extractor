The multiparty monitoring handbook series
This multiparty monitoring handbook is part of a series of guides to
monitoring collaborative forest restoration projects. The series was written
specifically for projects funded through the USDA Forest Service’s
Collaborative Forest Restoration Program (CFRP). The Handbooks in the
series are:
Handbook 1 – What is multiparty monitoring?
Handbook 2 – Developing a multiparty monitoring plan
Handbook 3 – Budgeting for monitoring projects
Handbook 4 – Monitoring ecological effects
Handbook 5 – Monitoring social and economic effects
Handbook 6 – Analyzing and interpreting monitoring data
Multiparty monitoring is required of all CFRP grantees; however, the
methods and approaches presented in these workbooks are to serve as
guides and references only. The specific methods are NOT required.
Because there is a wide diversity of projects funded through the CFRP,
many grantees will have different requirements for monitoring and/or
monitoring assistance.
The content of these handbooks was largely conceived at a series of
workshops held in 2003 that were sponsored by the following:
Ecological Restoration Institute (ERI), Forest Trust, Four Corners
Institute, National Forest Foundation, Pinchot Institute for
Conservation, USDA Forest Service—Collaborative Forest
Restoration Program.
These handbooks are updated periodically and the latest versions will
be available on the Collaborative Forest Restoration Program Web site
at www.fs.fed.us/r3/spf/cfrp/monitoring. For more information on this
series, contact the Ecological Restoration Institute, Box 15017, Flagstaff
AZ 86011-5017.
CFRP grantees are also eligible for multiparty monitoring training
workshops and technical assistance from the CFRP monitoring team. This
free service will be provided through September 2006. Call 866.614.8424
for details.

Introduction
Monitoring social and economic goals of
forest restoration
What are social and economic goals of forest restoration?_____
Forest restoration projects frequently have social, economic, and
cultural goals as well as ecological goals. For instance, project
partners may hope that their project will provide new jobs and
reduce local unemployment, keep youth in the community,
reduce the wildfire risk to human lives and property, or increase
public involvement in national forest planning and decision
making.
The social and economic goals of the Collaborative Forest
Restoration Program (CFRP), listed in the legislation that created
the program, may also be goals of individual restoration projects.
These include:
w Encourage sustainable communities and forests through
collaborative partnerships
w Improve local management skills
w Improve the use of small-diameter trees, or add value to
products made from these trees
w Improve communication and joint problem-solving among
forest restoration stakeholders
Why monitor social and economic goals?___________________
Monitoring provides a way to determine whether you are headed
toward or away from your goals. For example, your monitoring
group might want to ask, “Is our community becoming more or
less sustainable?” “Are local management skills improving or
getting worse?” or “Is the use of small-diameter trees increasing or
decreasing?”
1

How to measure social and economic goals?_______________
To answer questions like these, a multiparty monitoring team
must select indicators that will measure changes in each goal. An
indicator is a unit of information measured over time that
documents changes in a specific condition. The most useful
indicators are expressed in specific terms and measure aspects of
the goal that people care about. For instance, an indicator of
community sustainability might be local wage rates or the quality
of the water. To monitor a goal, you periodically measure the
indicator and document changes in the indicator over time. In this
example, you would measure changes in local wages or water
quality to determine if community sustainability is increasing or
decreasing.
For project-level monitoring, it is very important that your team
select indicators that are linked to your project. If you don’t think
that water quality will be affected one way or another by your
project, then don’t choose this as an indicator of community
sustainability. A better indicator might be the number of people
employed in forest restoration, or the number of value-added
wood products businesses in the community.
Part 1 of this handbook describes indicators that can help
community-based
multiparty
monitoring
groups
measure
changes in common forest restoration project goals. Part 2
describes specific methods for measuring change in each
indicator.
In addition to this handbook, there are a number of publications
that describe how to choose social and economic monitoring
approaches and variables. Some of these are listed in the reference
section at the back of this handbook.

To monitor a goal, periodically
measure its indicator and
document changes in the indicator
over time.

Part 1
Social and economic goals and indicators of
forest restoration
Each CFRP project has a different set of partners, a unique
community, a unique forest site, and its own restoration goals that
reflect the values of its collaborative partnership. The specific
restoration goals that your group chooses to monitor will depend
on all these factors.
The following goals were developed by a multiparty group of
researchers, land managers, and community members with
experience in collaborative forest restoration and monitoring. The
group considered many goals, including those identified by the
Community Forest Restoration Act.
The following list is therefore slightly broader but may reflect
goals and interests of your multiparty monitoring group. Your
group can choose from the following sample goals or define your
own as you develop your monitoring plan:
w Enhance community sustainability
w Build restoration business and workforce skills
w Improve or maintain local quality of life
w Ensure equal access to restoration jobs and decision making
w Improve capacity for collaboration
w Build support for forest restoration
Explanations of each goal, and indicators that you can use to
measure change toward or away from that goal, are provided on
the next few pages. You will note that some of the indicators can be
used to measure more than one goal. Methods used to measure
each indicator are provided in Part 2 of this handbook.
3

Enhance community sustainability_________________________
In recent decades, many small, rural forest communities have
experienced a decline in both employment opportunities and
population. As jobs and businesses are lost, these communities
have fewer economic resources for community infrastructure and
social services. Indicators of sustainability typically track a
community’s ability to achieve or sustain local workforce,
businesses, and investments over years or even decades. At the
project level, you may want to track wages and employment rates
by month or season, to measure job stability. For forest-dependent
businesses, supply of materials and the existence of a market for
wood products are important contextual factors that can affect
sustainability, and you may want to track these as well. You could
also track educational and training opportunities as an indicator of
people’s ability to earn a living wage. Training opportunities may
be particularly important to keep youth in the community. Sample
indicators you might use to track changes in community
sustainability include:
w Total number of workers employed by the project each
month, season, or year
w Amount paid to project workers each month, season or year
w Timeliness of payments
w Number and type of restoration-related trainings completed
by project workers
w Number and type of training opportunities for youth
w Number and diversity of wood products that can be processed
locally
w Number and size of contracts offered each year to do
restoration work on public lands
w Percent of all contracts awarded locally that go to local
contractors
Improve local restoration business and workforce skills_______
One goal of the Collaborative Forest Restoration Program is to
train a local workforce in forest restoration methods. Local people
may build CFRP-related job skills when they are employed on a
4

restoration or utilization project, or by attending workshops or
classes. Specific training topics might include sound ecological
principles of restoration, how to operate mechanized equipment
and chainsaws, or workplace safety procedures. Because forest
restoration is a new kind of business, many communities and
CFRP project teams will also benefit from developing their
business skills, such as bookkeeping, grant writing, and product
marketing skills. Indicators that could be used to measure change
in business and workforce skills include:
w Total number of workers employed by the project each
month, season, or year
w Number and type of restoration-related trainings completed
by project workers
w Type of equipment used (such as chainsaws, harvesting
equipment, skidding and loading equipment)
w Existence and use of written organizational procedures, rules,
and operational guidelines
w Existence and use of system for books, receipts, and grant
management
Improve or maintain local quality of life_____________________
For many people, employment conditions, like access to
restoration-related jobs, money earned in those jobs, job stability,
benefits received, and job safety, are indicators of quality of life.
When people must work long hours, be away from home over
night, or travel long distances to work, the quality and quantity of
time available for their families and community are diminished.
This in turn takes away from the overall quality of life in the
community. Quality of life may also depend on public access to
and the condition of nearby forests. In many southwestern
communities, access to public forest land is critical to residents’
ability to heat their homes and access food, medicines, and fuel for
cooking.
The
threat
of
catastrophic
fire
is
a
significant
quality-of-life issue in many communities, and reducing this
threat is a goal of many restoration activities in the Southwest.
5

Indicators you could use to track changes in quality of life include:
w Amount paid to project workers each month, season, or year
w Extent that project employees receive health benefits
w Extent that project workers are trained to use and do use
appropriate safety gear
w Extent that project workers are able to participate in family
and community life
w Opportunities for locals to recreate in the forest
w Availability of and access to medicinal, food, heating, or
building materials from the forest
w Number of acres protected from fire through the creation of
defensible space, fuelbreaks, or other fuels reduction projects
w Location of the project’s fuels reduction acres in relation to
areas considered to be at highest risk from wildfire
Ensure equal access to restoration jobs and decision making__
The distribution of social and economic opportunities is an
important issue in many southwestern communities, where some
groups have at times been excluded from jobs and natural resource
planning
decisions.
The
CFRP,
through
its
collaborative
structure, provides opportunities to overcome these social and
economic
inequities.
CFRP
projects
can
involve
people
traditionally excluded from restoration-related work, and can
include traditional forest users’ values in forest restoration
projects. Indicators that could be used to measure this goal
include:
w Extent that traditional forest users’ knowledge and practices
are part of the project
w Number of youth, minority group representatives, or people
from low-income communities hired to work on the project,
and type of work they are conducting
6

Improve capacity for collaboration_________________________
The success of collaborative restoration efforts is closely linked to
the quality and types of communication used by project team
members, stakeholders, and the broader public. Openness to
external input and willingness to consider different perspectives
are important aspects of collaboration and are necessary for
adaptive management. If there are strong and different opinions
about your project, your multiparty monitoring team may be
particularly interested in monitoring changes in the level of
conflict among stakeholders. Indicators you could use to track
changes in this goal include:
w Level of commitment to communication and group learning
(in time and money)
w Quality and timeliness of communication among all project
partners
w Extent that different perspectives are represented on the
project team and in project activities
w Extent of community, agency, or environmental group
participation in project activities
w Extent that stakeholders previously in conflict are now
working together on this project
Build support for forest restoration_________________________
Restoration projects require high levels of support from
stakeholders if the projects are to be implemented and completed
successfully and in a timely manner. Projects without public
support are vulnerable to appeals and litigation or vandalism.
Failure to engage the community before implementing a forestry
project may also damage relationships among community
members or groups. Examples of indicators for this goal include:
w Extent that different perspectives are represented on the
project team and in project activities
w Extent of community, agency, or environmental group
participation in project activities
7

w Extent of tree poaching from restoration sites
w Acceptance of frequent, low-intensity wildfire or prescribed
fire
w Perceived benefits of restoration activities
w Public attitudes toward the project and project collaborators
Summary of goals and indicators_________________________
Table 1 (pages 10–11) lists the sample indicators for each of the
possible
project-level
goals
discussed
above.
Monitoring
groups may find that many of the indicators listed are relevant
to their community and restoration project. However, not all
indicators will apply to all situations, and there will likely be
others, not included here, that are more directly applicable to
your particular situation.
The authors of this handbook do NOT recommend that any
group try to monitor all of the social or economic indicators
listed. Each multiparty monitoring group will want to select or
develop indicators specific to the local community and
restoration effort being monitored.

Part 2
Monitoring design and data collection
methods
Creating a sampling design_____________________________
Before beginning to gather data, your monitoring team should
create a sampling design that can become part of the monitoring
plan. Sampling designs provide information about the number,
location, and type of measurements to be taken at any given time.
When creating a sampling design, your group will need to
determine:
1 – What indicators will be monitored
2 – Methods to measure each indicator
3 – Where data will come from
4 – When and how often to measure each indicator
5 – Who will take the measurements
6 – When and how data will be analyzed
7 – Where and how data will be stored
1 — What indicators will be monitored
When your multiparty team selects goals, it should also select the
indicators it will use to measure each goal. If your group is having
difficulty choosing indicators, you may find it useful to review the
measurement methods discussed in this section and then discuss
what would be most useful and reasonable for your project.
2 — Methods to measure each indicator
Methods for each indicator listed in Part 1 are discussed in the final
section of this handbook. They include document analysis,
participant observation, surveys, interviews, focus groups, and
community mapping. Table 2 on pages 12–14 shows which methods
can be used to measure each of the indicators discussed in this
15

handbook. Your monitoring team should decide which method(s) it
will use for each indicator and use these consistently. In some cases,
you may want to measure the same indicator using two or three
different methods, to cross-check and confirm the data.
3 — Where data will come from
Before gathering any data, you need to know the scope and size of
your monitoring effort. Do you want to study changes for the
project only, for the community, or for a larger region, like a
national forest district? Your monitoring team will need to define
the geographic boundaries of the study area for each indicator it
wants to monitor. For example, if your indicator is diversity of
restoration and wood-products businesses, you may want to know
how many different kinds of businesses exist in your town, or you
may want to know how many exist within 50 miles of your project
site. Choosing the right scale for monitoring is important.
Changes that have a large impact on a village, for example, may not
have much of an impact on the county as a whole.
Your monitoring team will also want to identify all potential
sources and methods for gathering data on a specific indicator. For
many indicators, there will be more than one data source. The
team will need to consider the reliability of each data source and
the cost (in time and money) of obtaining data. These factors
should help the group choose which sources to use for
monitoring.
Whatever method you use, there are two distinct ways of
determining where your data will come from: random sampling and
non-random sampling.
Random sampling uses some kind of unbiased system to choose
objects of study. In a random sample, every individual has an equal
chance of being selected. For example, to select a random sample
of survey recipients from all the residents of a town, you could
assign each individual a number, and use a random number
generator to select a sample from that population. Random
16
A population is all of the members
of a group that you want to
monitor; for example, a population
might include all adult residents of
a community, or all members of an
environmental organization.
A sample refers to the people you
choose to gather information from.
It is usually a subset of the
population, and should be similar
to the population as a whole.

sampling allows you to gather information from a relatively small
number of individuals to draw conclusions about the larger
population from which they were drawn. Random sampling can
be used for any of the methods described in this handbook, but is
most commonly used for surveys.
Non-random sampling occurs when a researcher selects particular
individuals to study, or when some individuals have a greater
chance of being selected than others. Non-random sampling is
most appropriate when the sample size is small, or when some
individuals or documents are particularly important to include in
the sample. It is possible to draw important conclusions based on
non-random samples, but they cannot be said to represent the
population as a whole. Non-random sampling can be used for any
of the methods described in this handbook. If you are using
non-random sampling, it is very important that your entire
multiparty group works together to select a sample. This will
increase the quality of your data and help to minimize the
possibility that your results will be biased.
4 — When and how often to take each measurement
Exact dates or seasons may vary by the indicator to be measured.
Some indicators may need to be measured monthly, some yearly,
and some at the beginning and end of a project. It can be important
to gather data at the same time, such as the beginning of a month
or year, so that data are comparable.
At a minimum, you will want to take measurements before a project
starts and after it is completed. It is important to document conditions
before beginning the project to have some basis for comparison later.
Gathering baseline data means measuring indicators before starting
the project. It is equally important to collect data the exact same way
after a project has been carried out as it was collected before the
project started. Comparisons of data collected before and after a
project can demonstrate changes that result from the project or that
happen at the same time the project is implemented.
17
Random sampling means that every
member of the population has an
equal chance of being selected. A
random sample is considered to be
representative of the entire
population.
—
If your sample is selected through
non-random sampling, your
sample is representative only of
people very similar to those you
sampled.
Baseline data provide
information about the conditions in
a project area before the project was
started.

5 — Who will take the measurements
It is a good idea to have at least one person who is consistently
involved in collecting data and training others throughout the
monitoring project. People have slightly different ways of taking
measurements, and keeping a consistent person involved with the
project helps to minimize these differences.
6 — When and how data will be analyzed
When a monitoring team has collected data before and after a
project, they will need to analyze the data in order to see what
changes the project actually produced. While some information
may be fairly easy to compare before and after a project, other
information may require more complicated analysis.
7 — Where and how the data will be stored
It is important to store monitoring data in a permanent place so
that it can be used for future project activities. Any data should be
carefully labeled and placed in notebooks. A second, photocopied
set of the data should be stored in another location. Electronic data
should be backed up on computer disks or CDs. Electronic data,
including electronic spreadsheets and photographs, can be stored
with local resource management agencies, such as the Forest
Service or a local non-profit organization, if desired.
18
See Handbook 6 for more information on analyzing your data

Data collection methods
In this handbook, we describe five methods for analyzing social
and economic data: document review and secondary data analysis,
participant
observation,
community
mapping,
surveys
and
interviews, and focus groups. As shown in Table 3, the best
method depends on the type of information you are looking for.
For many of the indicators described in this handbook, you will
find the information you need in project documents or agency
reports, and you will want to use document review and secondary data
analysis to track these indicators.
The participant observation method is commonly used to document
project information that might not otherwise be recorded, such as
the extent that project workers use safety gear or the extent that
different perspectives are represented in project planning.

For
some
indicators,
your
best
source
of
data
will
be
knowledgeable people, and for these you may want to use some
method
of
systematically
asking
questions
to
obtain
the
information you need. There are several ways to ask questions to
get information and opinions from people. In general, they fall on
a spectrum from highly structured to very flexible, as shown in
Figure 1.
Figure 1 —  Types of questioning
The most structured form of questioning is the survey. Surveys
typically use closed-ended questions to gather information about
the beliefs, attitudes, behaviors, or other characteristics of a
relatively large group, such as all households or all high school
students in a community. Survey design can be very technical,
particularly if you are trying to find out information about an
entire population by asking questions of a random sample of that
population.
Surveys are most appropriate when you already know what the
important questions are, and can devise a set of answers which
capture the range of public opinion. For instance, if you want to
monitor recreational use of the forest and you know that people
primarily use the forest for hiking, riding off-road vehicles, and
camping, you could develop a survey to determine what
proportion of the community does each of these activities, and
how often. Surveys are also useful when you think that people are
more likely to share information in writing than when talking to
other people.
20
Closed-ended questions work best
for questions with clear-cut
answers.
—
Open-ended questions are used to
get more complex information.

The focus group method brings together several people who share
a common interest in or perspective on a topic to have a group
discussion. Questions are generally open-ended and designed to
encourage
discussion
among
group
participants,
so
that
perspectives can be explored and developed.
Interviews fall between surveys and focus groups on the spectrum
of questioning methods. In an interview, you ask detailed
questions of knowledgeable people on an individual basis. This is a
good method to use if a relatively small number of people have the
information you are seeking or if you want to be able to gain a
deeper understanding of complex issues.
For information with a strong spatial component, such as the
relationship of treatment areas to areas considered to be at highest
risk from wildfire, you may want to use community mapping. This
method is particularly useful for encouraging dialogue about
potential interactions among project activities and other uses of
the forest, such as the relationship between traditional firewood
collecting areas and treatment areas.
Table 2 on pages 12–14 shows the recommended methods for
each of the indicators discussed in this handbook. You will note
that most of the indicators can be measured using more than one
method. In these cases, you may choose to use more than one
method as a way to cross-check the accuracy of your data.
Document review and secondary data analysis______________
In some cases, you may be able to gather the data you need from
existing reports. Some monitoring data may already exist in
project records. These could include planning reports, meeting
minutes and semi-annual reports. Other useful data may be found
in a company’s employment records or business plan, or an agency
or school’s training records.
21

The basic method for document review and secondary data
analysis is:
1 – Identify possible data sources
2 – Access documents with the information you need
3 – Evaluate and extract the data you need
Step 1 — Identify possible data sources
There are many possible sources of data for document review, but
those you are most likely to use are the USDA Forest Service
(district, forest, or regional offices), the New Mexico Department
of State Forestry, and the CFRP project itself. For example, you
might examine project budgets and employee job descriptions to
measure the level of commitment to communication and group
learning. To measure public attitudes toward the project and
project collaborators, you could examine records of complaints or
other comments received by
authorities. You could also use
records of public comments to measure changes in attitudes
toward prescribed fire. Use the list in the sidebar for guidance in
identifying data sources for your indicators.
Step 2 — Access the documents with the information you need
In most cases you will need to contact an agency, organization, or
individual to obtain the documents you are seeking. Some data
may also be available on the Internet, on sites like the CFRP Web
site.
If information is from a private source, such as a business, you will
want to explain the monitoring project and build relationships
with business owners or agency staff in order to obtain access to
these reports. You may want to spend some time thinking about
how you can assure confidentiality for private information.
22
Indicators that can be measured using
document review include:
w
Total number of workers employed
w
Amount paid to project workers
w
Timeliness of payments
w
Number and type of trainings
w
Number and diversity of wood products
that can be processed locally
w
Number and size of contracts offered
w
Percent of all contracts awarded to locals
w
Type of equipment used
w
Existence and use of written procedures
w
Existence and use of accounting system
w
Extent that project employees receive
health benefits
w
Extent that project workers are trained to
use and do use safety gear
w
Number of acres protected from fire
w
Location of defensible space created by the
project in relation to areas considered to be
at highest fire risk
w
Number of youth, minority group
representatives, or people from low-income
communities hired to work on the project,
and type of work they are conducting
w
Level of commitment to communication
w
Extent that different perspectives are
represented
w
Extent of community, agency, or
environmental group participation
w
Acceptance of low-intensity wildfire or
prescribed fire
w
Public attitudes toward the project and
collaborators

Step 3 — Evaluate and extract the data you need
Once you have accessed the documents, review them carefully to
make sure that the data they contain matches your need. This is
particularly important when you are reviewing data gathered by
someone else for a different purpose (secondary data).
Make sure that you know what was measured. For example, “U.S.
poverty” is based on income only. It does not include housing
security, quality of life, or many other things that people associate
with poverty.
Make sure you understand how the data were collected. This will give you
an idea of how useful they really are. It will also be helpful if you
have to gather the same kind of data later on in the project.
Make sure you know the reason the data were originally collected. You
want to be sure that the records do not exclude data that you need
or include data that is not relevant to your project. For example, if
you are looking for wages of people employed on a CFRP project,
make sure that you are not including wages of people who work
for the same organization but are not working on the CFRP
project. Also make sure that you can identify which data fit within
the geographic boundary of your monitoring area, and which data
come from sites outside of your study area.
Finally, be prepared to spend some time formatting data in a way that
is useful to your monitoring effort. When someone else collects data,
they format it for their own purposes. While their data may be useful
to your team, the form in which they store or present their data may
not be. Someone on the team may need to type data into a computer
program, figure averages or percentages, or delete extra information
that is not relevant to your monitoring project.

Say that your multiparty monitoring team has decided that it
wants
to

project’s
effects

amount paid to workers as indicators. Your group has decided to
monitor employment and wages on a monthly basis because it is
interested in whether the project is providing steady jobs at a
sustainable living wage or whether the jobs or pay rates are
seasonal or otherwise changing over time. Your group has set the
following targets for your project: 12 new jobs paying at least $13
per hour that are full-time for at least 10 months of the year.
Step 1 – Identify possible data sources
You could measure both the number of project workers employed
and the amount paid by reviewing project payroll records or
documents supplied by contractors who work on the project.
Step 2 – Access the documents with the information you need
You would need to access this information directly through
project payroll or from the contractors.
Step 3 – Evaluate and extract the data you need
You might need to convert the information available to reflect
monthly wages and employment. Once this has been done, your
multiparty monitoring group could examine the data for patterns,
such as inconsistent wages or periods of employment and
unemployment, and compare your data to your target values.
Participant observation
Participant observation involves one or more individuals tracking
the daily activities of a group of people, and recording information
of interest as it happens. This method can capture important
information that is not recorded elsewhere.
The advantages of participant observation are that it is low cost,
easy to do, helps validate data from other sources, and may not
require a large investment of time. The disadvantages are that it is
not useful for collecting certain types of data and can lead to biased
results if carried out incorrectly.
24

In many cases, participant observation may work best when
combined with document review. For example, to measure the
indicator, “extent the project workers are trained to use and do use
appropriate safety gear,” you might review project documents to
determine the extent that project workers have been trained to use
safety gear and participant observation to determine the extent
that they actually use it. In this example, a project or crew leader
who is consistently on-site during project implementation might
be a good person to carry out participant observation.
For an indicator like “extent of community, agency, or
environmental group participation in project activities” you might
choose to use document review of project meeting notes and
event sign-in sheets to determine whether people representing
these groups are involved. Participant observation could then be
used to determine how (or to what extent) they are involved.
The basic method for participant observation is:
1 – Choose a group of individuals, or an activity, to observe
2 – Record information as it happens or immediately afterward
Step 1 – Choose a group of individuals, or an activity, to observe
Your multiparty monitoring team should decide where and when
you can best observe your indicators. For example, if you want to
monitor the use of safety equipment by project workers, you
might decide to be present during restoration operations, as well
as at any safety trainings provided to workers. If, on the other
hand, you want to monitor the extent to which traditional forest
users’ knowledge and practices are part of the project, you will
probably need to practice participant observation throughout
planning and implementation of the project.
25
Participant observation may be used to
measure the following indicators:
w
Number and type of restoration-related
trainings completed by forest workers
w
Type of equipment used
w
Extent that project workers are trained to
use and do use appropriate safety gear
w
Extent that traditional forest users’
knowledge and practices are part of the
project
w
Level of commitment to communication
and group learning
w
Number of youth, minority group
representatives, or people from
low-income communities are hired to
work on the project, and type of work they
are conducting
w
Extent that different perspectives are
represented on the project team and in
project activities
w
Extent that stakeholders previously in
conflict are now working together on this
project
w
Extent of community, agency, or
environmental group participation in
project activities
w
Quality and timeliness of communication
w
Extent of tree poaching from restoration
sites

Step 2 – Record information as it happens or immediately
afterward
One of the biggest differences between participant observation
and casual observation is the deliberate recording of information
throughout
the
day.
In
most
cases,
you
should
record
observations, events, and other information as they happen, which
will mean always having a pen and paper handy. If you know ahead
of time what you are looking for, you may want to develop a
checklist so that the observer can simply check off each time
something occurs. For instance, you might create a checklist of
different kinds of safety equipment (hardhats, gloves, etc.) and
check whether or not the equipment is being used. Checklists are a
good way to ensure that the same data are recorded in the same
way each time, no matter who is doing the observing.
In certain cases, you may want to wait to write down your
observations, particularly if you believe taking notes will influence
the individuals you are observing. For example, project workers
may be more likely to wear and use safety equipment if they know
someone is watching and taking notes. Observing without
influencing is a major challenge of this method.
With the participant observation method, it is particularly
important for your multiparty monitoring group to help decide
who or what gets monitored, and by whom. Without soliciting the
input of others, it can be easy for someone to focus in on some
groups or activities while neglecting others. The diversity of
perspectives in your multiparty group can help to ensure that the
results of your participant observation are not biased.
If observers are not actively involved in project implementation,
they should ensure that their presence is welcome and will not
significantly affect the activities or individuals they want to
observe. For example, someone not employed by the project may
need special permission to be present during mechanical
operations, or to participate in the collection of culturally
important plants. In other cases, they may be able to gather data
just by recording what they observe during a normal day on the
project site or interacting with project partners.
26
Checklists can make data collection
quick and easy. Also, using a checklist
can help ensure that data are always
recorded in the same way, no matter
who is taking notes.

Example of using the participant observation method:
Say that your multiparty monitoring team chose to measure
improvement in local business and workforce skills by monitoring
the types of equipment used on the project using participant
observation. If your multiparty team includes a forest worker who
will be involved in the restoration work at all the sites, you might
decide that he or she is the best individual to carry out the
participant observation to monitor the types of equipment used.
He or she could bring a list of equipment to the project site each
day and check off when each type of equipment is used
throughout the day. Alternatively, you might enlist the help of a
Forest Service employee or someone else who will be present
throughout the project to keep track of the equipment used.
Surveys and interviews
Surveys can be used to gather information about the beliefs, attitudes,
behaviors, or other characteristics of a relatively large group, such as all
households or all high school students in a community. Surveys are also
useful when you think that people are more likely to share information
in writing than when talking to other people.
Interviews are similar to surveys in that you are asking people to
answer questions, but they tend to use open-ended questions,
which are more interactive and so allow you to gain a deeper
understanding of complex issues.
Both of these methods follow five basic steps:
Step 1 – Clarify your information needs
Step 2 – Select participants
Step 3 – Develop and test questions
Step 4 – Ask the questions
Step 5 – Record the responses
27
Surveys can be used to measure the
following indicators:
w Extent that project employees receive
health benefits
w Extent that project workers are able to
participate in family and community life
w Opportunities for locals to recreate in
the forest
w Availability of and access to medicinal,
food, heating, or building materials
from the forest
w Extent that traditional forest users’
knowledge and practices are part of the
project
w Extent that different perspectives are
represented on the project team and in
project activities
w Quality and timeliness of
communication among project partners
w Acceptance of low-intensity wildfire or
prescribed fire
w Perceived benefits of restoration
activities
w Public attitudes toward the project and
collaborators

Step 1 – Clarify your information needs
Before developing questions or identifying people to answer the
questions, your multiparty group should review the indicator or
indicators that you want to measure, and clarify what it is you are
trying to measure and what specific information you hope to
gather. An important part of this is ensuring a shared
understanding of important terms. For example, if you are
interested in measuring opportunities for locals to recreate in the
forest, you must define the term “local” and possibly explore
what kinds of “recreation” you are interested in monitoring.
Step 2 – Select participants
The rights of people who participate. It is important that monitoring
teams explain their project to anyone who participates in a
survey, interview, or focus group. It is also very important to
ensure
their
confidentiality.
The
person
asking
for
the
information should clearly explain:
w Who is involved in the multiparty monitoring
w What the information will be used for
w Why the particular information requested is important
w The individual’s right not to answer
w How the information provided will be handled to assure
confidentiality (for example: no name written down,
questionnaire kept in a locked filing cabinet and who has the
key, how the data will be compiled so that no one can identify
an individual).
Surveys tend to include a relatively large number of respondents
(several dozen to several hundred) and are often drawn from a
general population, such as all citizens of a community or all
members of an interest group. Interviews tend to focus on fewer,
more specialized respondents who give more detailed and
nuanced information than would be given in a survey. Both
methods may use either random or non-random sampling (see
pages 16–17).
28
Indicators that can be measured using
interviews include:
w
Number and type of training opportunities
w
Number and diversity of wood products
that can be processed locally
w
Number and size of contracts offered
each year
w
Percent of all contracts awarded locally
that go to locals
w
Extent that project workers are able to
participate in family and community life
w
Opportunities for locals to recreate in the
forest
w
Availability of and access to medicinal,
food, heating, or building materials from
the forest
w
Extent that traditional forest users’
knowledge and practices are part of the
project
w
Location of defensible space created by
the project in relation to areas considered
to be at highest fire risk
w
Level of commitment to communication
and group learning
w
Extent that different perspectives are
represented on the project team and in
project activities
w
Extent that stakeholders previously in
conflict are now working together on the
project
w
Quality and timeliness of communication
among project partners
w
Acceptance of low-intensity wildfire or
prescribed fire
w
Perceived benefits of restoration activities
w
Public attitudes toward the project and
collaborators
w
Extent of tree poaching from restoration
sites

If the population of interest is large, you may want to employ
random sampling to select a manageable number of respondents
that is representative of the population as a whole. For example, to
choose a random sample from the population of all high school
students in the community, you could assign a number to each
student and then use a table of random numbers to decide which
students you will survey. To select a random sample from a
population of households in your community, you might choose
the fourth house along every road. Random sampling allows you
to use the results of your sample to draw conclusions about the
larger population of interest. Whatever the approach to random
selection, it is essential to use the same method every time you
gather information.
The appropriate size of a sample depends on the size of the
community or other group to be monitored. The larger the sample
size, the more you can trust the data to be representative of the
entire population. You may want to get expert help determining
the optimal sample size and selecting your sample.
You can also use non-random sampling. For instance, you may
want to take advantage of gathering responses from people who
are already gathered together for some reason. Your monitoring
team might ask the people attending a workshop to answer specific
questions at the start of the workshop and again at the end, to see
what they have learned. Alternatively, interviewees may be
specifically chosen by the multiparty group, usually because they
have a depth of knowledge on the indicator of interest. When
using non-random sampling, it is important to keep in mind that
the results will only reflect the views of people very similar to
those you surveyed, and not the entire population of interest.
Step 3 – Develop and test questions
There are two basic kinds of questions you can ask: closed-ended and
open-ended. Closed-ended questions give people a limited number of
answers to choose from. With open-ended questions, people are asked to
provide their own answers. Open-ended questions often begin with
words like ‘why’, ‘what’, ‘how’, or ‘where’.
29
Examples of groups that can be
surveyed or interviewed:
USDA Forest Service
NEPA and planning personnel
CFRP program manager
Rural Community Assistance
(RCA) coordinators
District Rangers
Forest Supervisors
Fire management staff
Fuels specialists
Timber management staff
Contracting staff
Department of State Forestry
Timber staff
Restoration specialists
Forest products specialists
Fir and fuel specialists
Training specialists
CFRP project
Project manager(s)
Project participants
Workers/employees
General public
Community members

For example, a monitoring team might want to measure the
quality of communication among project partners. To get this
information with a closed-ended question, they might ask,
“Would you say communication among project partners is very
good, good, neutral, poor, or very poor?” An open-ended question
about the same issue might ask, “How would you describe the
quality of communication among project partners?”
Closed-ended questions are faster and easier to answer, and often
work better for written or telephone surveys and for fairly
clear-cut questions. For each closed-ended question, include a
means for the respondent to answer “don’t know” or “no
opinion.” You may want to engage the help of a surveying expert
(such as a CFRP technical assistant) to help you develop your
questions.
Interview questions can be either closed-ended or open-ended,
but in general tend to be less formal and structured than survey
questions. Interviews often use open-ended questions to allow
interviewees to go into detail on topics of interest. Interviewers
must know how to ask follow-up questions and must be careful to
ask them in a neutral way.
The questions you ask and the way that you ask them will greatly
affect the quality of the data you collect. For example, you should
be careful not to ask leading questions that could bias people’s
responses. An example of a leading question might be, “Don’t you
think that community participation has improved?” Respondents
are likely to answer “yes” to this question, even if that is not what
they truly believe.
Survey and interview questions should be developed and reviewed
by the entire multiparty group. You should aim to develop a
concise list of clear questions which directly relate to the indicator
you are measuring. Before conducting the survey or interview,
you should pilot, or pre-test, the questions on a small number of
people who will not participate in the survey but are similar to
your population of interest. Ask them to consider whether any of
the questions or answers are unclear or poorly written, whether
the questions address important issues and concerns, and whether
the survey is too long or confusing.
30
Examples of leading questions:
—
Have you had any problems with
extremist environmental groups?
—
Do you think our forests should
restored to a healthy state or left at
risk of catastrophic fire?
—
How has your project improved
communication between the Forest
Service and the community?
—
Was the operator driving
carelessly when he crashed the
skidder?
Closed-ended questions work best
for questions with clear-cut
answers.
—
Open-ended questions are used to
get more complex information.

Step 4 – Ask the questions
Surveys can generally be conducted in person, over the telephone,
or in writing. Interview questions are generally asked in person or
over the telephone. To make sure the results are comparable,
always use the same method as the first time the survey was
administered and take your sample from the same population. For
example, do not conduct the survey in person one year and in
writing the next. Similarly, you should not ask your questions of,
for example, agency staff one year and local residents the next.
In-person and telephone surveys and interviews involve the
interviewer reading the questions and recording responses.
Conducting the survey or interviews by telephone allows you to
reach a relatively larger number of people at relatively low cost.
However, using the telephone may be less appropriate for
personal or sensitive questions, does not allow the use of visual
aids, and may not reach important people who do not have a
telephone.
In-person surveys will generally get many more people to
respond, and are particularly important when you want to ask
open-ended questions. They are also time-consuming, however,
so should be used only when they are really needed. In-person
interviews are particularly appropriate when the topics of
discussion are complex, when there are a large number of
questions, or a large number of open-ended questions. This
method is more time-consuming, but can result in more complete
and nuance information than with phone interviews.
With written surveys, you have no personal interaction with the
survey respondents. People are given the questions and written
instructions for completing the survey. They then read the questions
and write down their individual responses. Written surveys can be
distributed by mail, at meetings, or on-site. On-site means the surveys
are made available in highly visible locations, such as a public library,
post office, trailhead, or visitor center. Surveys may be returned by
mail or in a secure container located next to the surveys.
31
Questions can be asked in person,
over the telephone, or in writing.
—
It is important to use the same
method of asking questions each
time you ask them.

Step 5 – Record the responses
When conducting a survey or interviews you will need to have a
reliable means of recording responses. The two most common
approaches are using an audio recorder and taking handwritten
notes.
Using an audio recorder, such as a cassette tape recorder or digital
voice recorder, is the most accurate method and allows the person
asking the questions to focus on the conversation rather than on
taking notes. After the survey or interview is over, the recorded
conversations can then be transcribed word-for-word into a
computer document. When using an audio recorder, make sure it
works, has adequate battery power, and that you know how to use
it prior to the interview. It is also a good idea to take brief notes of
the conversation in case of any technical problems with the
recording equipment.
When administering surveys via telephone, make sure you have a
consistent means of recording responses, either on a paper survey
sheet or directly into a computer database. Answers to open-ended
questions should be written down word-for-word whenever
possible and repeated to the respondent to confirm that they were
recorded correctly.
There may be cases where audio recording equipment is unavailable
or where it would be inappropriate to use. For example, some people
may not feel comfortable having their words recorded. In these cases,
you will need to take detailed notes during the interview.
When using the handwritten note method, it is important to read
your notes back to the participants throughout the conversation
(and at the end) to verify that you heard them correctly and to be
sure that you wrote down all relevant points. As you begin to
analyze the notes, you may need to contact the participants again
for further clarification. If you use a written survey format then
your answers are already recorded and you can move directly into
compiling and analyzing the results.
32

You should take care to protect both the confidentiality of your
sources and the quality of your data. This means making a copy of
all data sheets (such as transcripts or interview notes) and keeping
them in a locked drawer at a separate location from where the
originals are kept (also in a locked drawer).
Example of using the survey method:
Say your multiparty monitoring group is interested in monitoring
the project’s effects on local quality of life by measuring the extent
to which project workers are able to participate in family and
community life. If you feel that you are familiar enough with the
issue to assemble a list of specific questions, and want to be able to
generalize about all project workers, you might decide to use a
survey approach.
Step 1 – Clarify your information needs
Your multiparty group begins by discussing and clarifying the
term “project worker” in order to define the population of interest.
You also discuss what it means to participate in family and
community life by compiling a list of activities that represent
important elements of quality of life.
Step 2 – Selecting participants
Your group uses project documents and personal recollection to
assemble a list of all CFRP project workers. If the list is small (say,
20 people) you might decide to survey all of them. If the list is large
(over 100 people), you might decide to use random sampling to
choose a more manageable number to survey.
Step 3 – Develop and test questions
As a group, your multiparty team decides what questions are
most important to ask and how to ask each one. The draft
survey contains fifteen closed-ended questions relating to
family life, participation in community events, and quality of
life. Two community members who are not working on the
CFRP project, but have worked on similar projects in the past,
33

agree to answer the survey and provide advice on suggested
changes. Based on this feedback, you modify some of the
questions to make them more clear.
Step 4 – Ask the questions
Your group decides that the best way to administer the survey is
over the telephone. You call each of the respondents on your list,
keeping track of who has answered the survey, who wasn’t home,
and who declined to participate. The caller asks the questions and
writes down answers on a sheet of paper that does not contain the
respondent’s name or any identifying characteristics. After a week
of surveys and returned calls, you decide that there are a few
respondents that you will not be able to reach, and the group
decides it is satisfied with the number of responses received.
Step 5 – Record the responses
You review the data sheets to ensure that there is no information
that would identify any of the respondents. You make copies of
these sheets and keep the originals in a separate location. The
copies are used to begin analyzing the results.
Example of the interview method:
Imagine your multiparty monitoring group has chosen to monitor
changes in local capacity for collaboration by measuring the
number of people previously in conflict who are now working
together on this project.
Step 1 – Clarify your information needs
Your group begins by exploring what kinds of conflict have been
common in your community, and what individuals or groups have
been involved. You also discuss possible contexts for different
individuals working together.

Step 2 – Selecting participants
Your group discusses a list of possible interviewees, and you settle
on eight individuals who represent six different stakeholder
groups and two members of the general community. You contact
these eight people to ask whether they would be willing to
participate in interviews, and modify your list based on their
responses.
Step 3 – Develop and test questions
Your multiparty group agrees on five general topic areas that they
want covered in the interviews. For each topic area your group has
developed specific questions that will help to spur conversation.
Your intent is for the interviewees to do most of the talking, and
your role will be to keep them focused on the topics of interest.
You test these questions by conducting an interview with a local
stakeholder who will not be interviewed for actual monitoring
data.
Step 4 – Ask the questions
You invite the interviewees, one at a time, to join you and another
member of your multiparty team in a quiet, private location where
they will feel free to express their thoughts. You tell them that each
interview should take roughly one hour to complete, and that they
are free to stop the interview at any time and to refuse to answer
any question. You also explain how you will keep their answers
confidential. You use a cassette tape recorder to capture the
interviews.
After
the
interviews,
you
call
several
of
the
interviewees to clarify some of their responses.
Step 5 – Record the responses
You transcribe the recorded interviews into a word-processing
document for review and analysis.
35

Focus groups
Some information can best be gathered through small-group
discussions with people who share common experiences or
perspectives, also known as focus groups. For instance, you may hold
three separate focus groups with community elders, forestry
business owners, and environmentalists to better understand the
views of these three groups on a specific issue. You could also hold
a focus group composed of people with different perspectives and
interests. This would allow you to get a sense of the range of
concerns about a proposed project, for example. In most cases,
though, you will want each focus group to contain people with
similar interests.
In focus groups, a skilled facilitator guides the discussion using a
few specific questions about different aspects of a topic. Focus
group sessions typically last one to two hours, are and best used
to explore current conditions.
When a focus group discussion is to be used for monitoring, the
same group should be brought together to discuss the same
issues at least once a year. Focus groups are particularly useful
when:
w data is not available from official sources,
w data is very expensive to gather through random surveys,
w the information asked is something that individuals are
hesitant to share about themselves but are willing to discuss in
general, or,
w when groups together might generate more ideas and
thoughts about a topic than individuals would.
Like interviews and surveys, the focus group method has five
steps:
Step 1 – Clarify your information needs
Step 2 – Select participants
Step 3 – Develop and test questions
Step 4 – Ask the questions
Step 5 – Record the responses
36
To conduct a focus group, you will
need:
– a skilled facilitator
– a note-taker or tape recorder
– a neutral, accessible meeting place
– a group of 5–10 participants
– a focused set of questions
Indicators that can be measured using
focus groups include:
w
Number and diversity of wood products
that can be processed locally
w
Existence and use of written organization
procedures, rules, and operational
guidelines
w
Extent that project workers are able to
participate in family and community life
w
Opportunities for locals to recreate in the
forest
w
Availability of and access to medicinal,
food, heating, or building materials from
the forest
w
Extent that traditional forest users’
knowledge and practices are part of the
project
w
Level of commitment to communication
and group learning
w
Extent that stakeholders previously in
conflict are now working together on this
project
w
Acceptance of frequent, low-intensity
wildfire or prescribed fire
w
Perceived benefits from forest restoration
w
Public attitudes toward the project and
project collaborators

Step 1 — Clarify your information needs
Before inviting people to participate in a focus group, review the
indicator or indicators that you want to measure using this
method. Do not try to cover several different topics in one focus
group session.
Step 2 — Select participants
Ideally, focus groups contain five to ten people with similar
backgrounds, experience, and values. You may want to organize a
few different focus groups on the same topic in order to get
feedback from different groups. For example, if you are interested
in gathering data on the extent that traditional forest users’
knowledge and practices are part of the project, you may want to
hold one focus group with local project leaders, another with
members of local tribes, and a third with local land grant
members.
Meeting locations should be neutral and easily accessible to all
participants. Neutral means none of the participants will feel
uncomfortable going to this location and no one will feel
compelled to respond positively or negatively to the questions
because of who owns, lives in, or works in the building.
You will need a facilitator who is knowledgeable about the topic to
be discussed and skilled at asking questions without biasing
participants’ answers. The facilitator may be a project team
member, or you may choose to hire a professional facilitator.
When inviting people to participate, explain the purpose of the
focus group session and what will be expected of them. Because
you will be using the focus group(s) for monitoring, explain that
participants must be willing to meet periodically over the course
of the projects (e.g., once a year for three years). In some cases, it
may be necessary to compensate people for their travel expenses or
time. Explain the topic of discussion in general, but do not provide
too much information.
37
Examples of people who can be
recruited for focus groups:
USDA Forest Service
CFRP program manager
Rural Community Assistance
(RCA) coordinators
District Rangers
Forest Supervisors
Fire management staff
Fuels specialists
Timber management staff
Contracting staff
Financial officers
Department of State Forestry
Timber staff
Fire and fuel specialists
CFRP project
Project manager(s)
Project participants
Workers/employees
Local stakeholders
Local business people
Community members
Tribal representatives
Land grant representatives

Step 3 — Develop and test the discussion questions
Develop a series of open-ended questions that the facilitator can
use to get the data you need. The focus group should be asked
several related questions, to confirm what has been said in
different ways. For example, if the indicator is amount and
diversity of wood products that can be processed locally, the
facilitator should ask the focus group several questions about the
types and volumes of lumber, building materials, furniture, and
crafts that are made in the area.
You should pilot, or pre-test, the questions with people who will
not be participating in the focus group, to make sure that they can
be easily understood and are not misinterpreted.
Step 4 — Ask the questions
Set up the meeting room so that all participants can easily make
eye contact, with chairs evenly spaced around a table, for example.
If the participants do not all know each other, provide nametags
and start with small talk and introductions to make everyone
comfortable before the discussion begins. If desired, participants
can be given a short, written questionnaire at the start of the focus
group session, to get them thinking about the topic before they
start talking.
Before starting the discussion, the facilitator should explain how
the focus group will proceed and clarify the scope of the
discussion, such as whether the information being gathered is
about a subgroup within the community or the entire community.
The facilitator should explain how the discussion will be recorded
(usually a designated note-taker or a tape recorder) and whether or
not individual names will be attached to any comments.
As noted above, the facilitator should use several different kinds of
questions to get data about each indicator you are monitoring.
This will improve the validity of your data. Because you want to be
able to compare the focus group results from year to year, it is a
good idea to try to get the group to come to general agreement on
the current state of the indicator you are tracking.
38

Step 5 – Record the responses
As with interviews, conducting focus groups requires a reliable
means of recording responses. The two most common approaches
are using an audio recorder and taking handwritten notes.
Using an audio recorder, such as a cassette tape recorder or digital
voice recorder, is the most accurate method and allows the
interviewer to focus on the conversation rather than on taking
notes. After the end of the focus group, the recorded conversations
can then be transcribed word for word into a computer document.
However, there may be cases where audio recording equipment is
unavailable or where it would be inappropriate to use. For
example, some focus group participants may not feel comfortable
having their words recorded. In these cases, you (or an assistant)
will need to take detailed notes during the focus group.
When using the handwritten note method, it is important to read
your notes back to the participants throughout the conversation
(and at the end) to verify that you heard them correctly and to be
sure that you wrote down all relevant points. As you begin to
analyze the notes, you may need to contact the participants again
for further clarification.
You should take care to protect both the confidentiality of your
sources and the quality of your data. This means making a copy of
all data sheets (such as transcripts, or focus group notes) and
keeping them in a locked drawer at a separate location from where
the originals are kept (also in a locked drawer).
Example of using the focus group method:
Say that your multiparty group has chosen to monitor local quality
of life by keeping track of the extent that traditional forest users’
knowledge and practices are part of the project.
39

Step 1 – Clarify your information needs
Before you select focus group participants or develop questions
for them to answer, your multiparty monitoring group discusses
what it means by “traditional forest users’ knowledge and
practices.” It is agreed that for the purposes of this project,
“traditional forest users” are those community members who have
been working in or using the forest to gather materials, recreate,
or for spiritual reasons for at least 20 years, or whose families have
been doing so for more than one generation.
Step 2 – Select participants
Your group decides that the people best equipped to answer these
questions are community elders. You also decide that it would be
best to choose a facilitator who is a respected community member
and is not affiliated with the project—someone community elders
will feel comfortable talking to. Since the majority of community
elders attend monthly meetings at the community center, you
choose this as the best location for your focus group sessions.
Although most community elders attend the monthly meetings,
you want to be sure that all community elders are encouraged to
participate in your focus group session. To make sure that all
elders are invited to participate, you first make a list of all of the
elders in the community. Then you announce the purpose,
format, and data of the focus group session at the next monthly
community meeting and note which elders are there. Your team
reviews the list of elders and agrees to visit each elder who was not
at the community meeting, to tell them about the focus group and
offer to provide
transportation to the meeting. Based on the
response at the community meeting and individual discussions
with elders, your multiparty monitoring team can now compile a
list of people who will be participating in the focus group session.
Your multiparty monitoring team works with the facilitator to
develop three or four questions that will get information about the
extent that traditional forest users’ knowledge and practices are
40

part of your CFRP project. Together, you agree upon the
following questions:
w What are the important traditional uses of this forest?
w How might this CFRP project affect or be affected by those
traditional uses?
w How, if at all, is this project addressing these potential effects?
Step 4 – Ask the questions
You could initiate a series of focus groups with traditional forest
users, beginning before project planning and continuing during
and after implementation. Following each focus group, you could
use the information gained to modify your project to better meet
these needs. Remember that you want to get the same people to
attend each session.
Step 5 – Record the responses
If your focus group participants give you their unanimous
consent, you may decide to use a tape recorder or digital voice
recorder to record the conversations of the focus group. If consent
is not given, you may decide to enlist the help of another respected
community member to be present and take notes during the
session.
Visual aids for interviews and focus groups
There are many visual aids that can be used to help facilitate
interviews or focus groups. Among these are community mapping
(described
in
detail
beginning
on
page
44),
landscape
cross-sections, and matrices. These aids are particularly helpful
when you are working with a group of people who are
unaccustomed to answering interview questions. They are also
useful for facilitating focus-group discussions.
41

Landscape cross-sections: Landscape cross-sections are diagrams of a
particular area that help people describe the land uses, plant or animal
species, soil types, or other issues that relate to different parts of a project
area. Figure 2 shows a cross-section used to discuss historical uses of the
bosque. When using cross-sections, it is helpful to prepare a list of topics
to be discussed or drawn ahead of time. This method may also be used in
the field, with groups walking along actual transects and diagraming the
uses in a project area.
Figure 2 —  Landscape cross-section
Matrices: Matrices are essentially visual graphs of information that
allow for group participation. A sample matrix might be developed with
a group about historical uses of the bosque. The group could diagram
different uses of the bosque according to important time periods in
history. Each participant could then place a dot in each box that
represents a use that they themselves participated in during a certain
time period. The sample matrices in Figures 3 and 4 provide examples of
this.
42

According to the historical matrix shown in Figure 3, most uses of
the bosque have declined in the last 30 years. From interviews that
accompanied the creation of this matrix, the interviewer might
learn that these uses decreased primarily because desirable species
no longer existed along the bosque or because the vegetation was
so thick that it was no longer a good place to recreate.
According to the classification matrix shown in Figure 4, pinyon
pine was most useful species to participants for its wood and seeds,
juniper for its wood, and coyote willow for its bark and wood.
Interviews that would accompany the creation of this matrix
might give information about whether these products are readily
available.

For monitoring, visual aids like these can be used to facilitate
gathering information related to resource use over time or
perspectives on collaboration and conflict. The same variables
could be diagramed at the beginning of a project as well as one or
more years after the project was implemented.
Community mapping___________________________________
Community mapping can be useful for tracking some indicators.
It can also be used at the beginning of a project to discuss project
goals and to plan monitoring efforts. The process of map making is
often accompanied by rich conversation among project partners
and other stakeholders.
Community mapping involves having community members and
other stakeholders draw or help to draw maps. Community
members should be involved in identifying issues and deciding
what should go on the maps. These maps are usually drawn from
a “birds-eye” or aerial perspective and may or may not be drawn
to scale. They can be used to document important areas for
collecting medicinal plants or foods, areas that are important for
wildlife or recreation, areas of spiritual importance, or other
areas
that
are
significant
to
community
members
and
stakeholders. Usually, these maps are most appropriate for
information about an area that is larger than a project. For
example, maps might be created for a national forest district or
for a Native American tribe’s reservation and ancestral lands.
Maps can be made in a variety of ways. They can be simple,
hand-drawn maps, they can be drawn onto clear overlays in order to
compare different values that may be affected by a project, or they
can be put into a Geographic Information System (GIS) to make
more precise comparisons. Some resources that describe mapping
methods in detail are included in the references section of this
handbook.
If maps are to be used for monitoring, special care must be taken to
ensure that they are produced in the same way every time. At the
44
Indicators that can be measured using
community mapping include:
w
Number and size of contracts offered
each year to do restoration work
w
Opportunities for locals to recreate in the
forest
w
Availability of and access to medicinal,
food, heating, or building materials from
the forest
w
Location of defensible space created by
the project in relation to areas considered
to be at highest risk from wildfire
w
Number of youth, minority group
representatives, or people from
low-income communities hired to work on
the project, and type of work they are
conducting
w
Extent of tree poaching from restoration
sites

beginning of the monitoring period, the multiparty monitoring team
should select the symbols or colors that will be used to record
different kinds of information, so that all participants record the same
information with the same codes. Similar groups of people, such as
youth, elders, or Forest Service representatives should be involved in
the mapping process each time as well.
There are many ways to make maps, and groups who wish to include
mapping in their monitoring projects should refer to other resources,
such as those listed in the Reference section of this handbook, before
beginning the mapping process.
Some of the questions you will need to consider when beginning a
community mapping project include:
Who will be involved in the mapping process?
A community map is most effective when it includes broad
representation from the community. You will need to decide if
there will be a limit on the number of people participating, and
how participants will be chosen. Your multiparty monitoring
team can help determine the range of stakeholders who should be
involved in the mapping process.
What is the geographic scope of the map?
Are you only interested in mapping the CFRP project site, or
should
your
community
map
include
lands
immediately
surrounding the project, the local ranger district, or the tribal
reservation? Keep in mind the potential application of the
community map to future restoration projects.
What are the features to be mapped?
You should be able to describe, in general terms, what kind of
information should be mapped in order to provide information
about your specific indicators. Do not be overly prescriptive, as
this can cause participants to withhold important information that
45
Data sources for community
mapping:
USGS topographic maps
(free maps are available at
www.terra-server.com)
Project area maps
Aerial photographs (some aerial
photographs are available at
memory.loc.gov:8081/ammem/
award97/icuhtml/aephome.html)
Forest Service scoping letters
Forest Service Schedules of Proposed
Activities (SOPA)
Environmental Impact Statements
Wildland-Urban Interface maps
U.S. Census data (www.census.gov)

may not have been obvious at the outset. For example, if you want
a community map focused on defensible space and wildfire risk,
ask the participants to map any features relevant to those topics
and not to simply map the defensible space surrounding their own
homes.
What will be the format of your community map?
Community maps can range from simple hand-drawn sketches to
complex GIS-based documents. If using a hand-drawn approach,
you may want to start with a “base map” which includes simple
outlines of major features such as public land boundaries and
major roads. Or you may decide to use transparent overlays, with a
topographic map as a base layer. If you decide to use GIS for your
community map, be sure to conduct the community mapping
session in a way that does not confuse or intimidate those with
little computer experience. In these cases you may want to
conduct the mapping exercises on paper and later integrate the
results into a GIS map.
What symbols will be used for mapping relevant features?
It is a good idea to standardize the symbols that participants will
use to identify features of importance. For example, medicinal
plants might be marked with a series of green squares, old-growth
trees with brown dots, and fuelwood areas with orange circles. A
legend should be put on each map so that everyone can see what
these symbols mean. The multiparty monitoring team may want
to choose these symbols as a group.
What supplementary geographic information is needed?
Depending on the complexity and detail of the map you aim to
produce, you may need to invest time and energy into locating and
gathering geographic information to inform the community
mapping process. You may find it necessary to hold several
46

community
mapping
forums
where
participants
identify
information needs. For example, you may start your mapping
process with a simple outline of local public land boundaries and a
topographical map. After your first meeting with community
mapping participants, you may realize that they need aerial
photographs as well as information on forest road conditions,
areas of high fire risk, exotic plant densities, and private land
boundaries in order to better express their concerns and desires for
the landscape. Geographic information specialists with federal
agencies, local governments, or tribal offices can be great resources
for obtaining maps, GIS layers, and other geographic resources.
What information might be left out of the community mapping
process?
Some participants may not be comfortable identifying the
locations of certain features. For example, individuals who collect
ceremonial or medicinal plants may not want to share their
specific collection locations. Other people may not want to give
away a secret fishing hole or favorite hunting spot. Do not try to
force people to divulge information if they are not comfortable
doing so. Rather, try to get a general sense of what kinds of
information are unlikely to be shared, and tailor the map to the
features people feel comfortable discussing.
Community mapping sessions should be facilitated. While your
ultimate objective might be to produce a collaboratively-
developed map that can help guide and monitor your CFRP
project, recognize that the process itself is also important. Sharing
the locations of culturally important places, identifying areas of
concern, discussing popular recreational sites – these can all serve
as a basis for constructive conversation between different
stakeholders who do not normally interact (or who normally
interact antagonistically). Do not lose sight of the primary purpose
of the session—to develop a community map—but do allow
ample space and time for community interaction.
47

Example of using community mapping to determine acres of
defensible space, areas of high fire risk, and opportunities for local
families to recreate in the forest.
Your community mapping approach could include two sessions:
one prior to project implementation and another held one year
after completion of the treatments. In both cases, you could invite
members of the community to map areas of particular interest or
concern to them, areas which act as escape routes or defensible
space from wildfires, and areas where they enjoy recreating in the
forest. Spatial information from federal or state agencies,
including fire hazard information, could be integrated into these
maps to show the relationships between treatment areas, fire
hazards, and recreational areas. The “before” and “after” maps
could be compared as a means of monitoring the possible effects of
the project on fire risk and recreational opportunities.
