Abstract.
Burn severity can be mapped using satellite data to detect changes in forest structure and moisture
content caused by fires. The 2001 Leroux fire on the Coconino National Forest, Arizona, burned over 18 pre-
existing permanent 0.1 ha plots. Plots were re-measured following the fire. Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery and the
Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) were used to map the fire into four severity levels immediately
following the fire (July 2001) and 1 year after the fire (June 2002). Ninety-two Composite Burn Index (CBI) plots
were compared to the fire severity maps. Pre- and post-fire plot measurements were also analysed according to
their imagery classification. Ground measurements demonstrated differences in forest structure. Areas that were
classified as severely burned on the imagery were predominantly Pinus ponderosa stands. Tree density and basal
area, snag density and fine fuel accumulation were associated with severity levels.Tree mortality was not greatest in
severely burned areas, indicating that the NBR is comprehensive in rating burn severity by incorporating multiple
forest strata. While the NBR was less accurate at mapping perimeters, the method was reliable for mapping
severely burned areas that may need immediate or long-term post-fire recovery.

Introduction
Burn severity is a function of physical and ecological changes
caused by fire. Fires burn heterogeneously across landscapes,
withunburnedandlightlyburnedpatchesinterspersedamong
severely burned patches, due to variability in weather and
landscapepatterns(Halletal.1980;VanWagner1983;Turner
and Romme 1994; Cochrane and Schulze 1999). Fire spread
and severity have been associated with abiotic factors includ-
ing weather, moisture and slope (Romme and Knight 1981;
Christensen et al. 1989). Severity can also be highly influ-
enced by biotic conditions including tree size, successional
stage and pathogens (Turner et al. 1999). Mapping of burn
severity provides information to target recovery activities
efficiently (Lachowski et al. 1997; Sunar and Ozkan 2001;
Miller andYool 2002). Large burned patches may negatively
impact wildlife nesting and browsing (Romme and Knight
1981). Vegetation mortality changes water loss through
evapotranspiration, surface flow and subsurface flow. High-
severity burns often increase hydrophobic soil conditions,
leading to increased runoff and erosion compared to less
severely burned areas (Robichaud et al. 2000). Unburned and
low burn areas are seed sources for more severely impacted
areas, which usually have fewer surviving and re-sprouting
individuals (White et al. 1996).
In this study, burn severity is being measured in the con-
text of the fire’s ecological impacts (e.g. plant mortality,
understory and forest floor effects, etc.). Unfortunately, burn
severity is difficult to define and quantify. Key and Benson
(2005) observed that ‘no common standard’ exists. There-
fore, a number of quantitative and qualitative estimates are
often used to rate areas and the choice of fire-related variables
depends largely on management and ecological objectives,
and sampling scale (Ryan and Noste 1985; Key and Benson
2005). Differences may exist between assessing burn severity
from the ground compared to remotely sensed data. Imagery
integrates changes in all parts of the forest, such as those on
the ground and in the tree canopy (White et al. 1996); there-
fore, at least some field assessment is usually necessary to
clarify which parts of the forest strata were affected.
Image differencing is one of the most accurate methods of
change detection (Muchoney and Haack 1994; Coppin and
Bauer 1996; Kushla and Ripple 1998) and data normaliza-
tion may lead to higher accuracy (Bertolette and Spotskey
2001). The most frequently used technique in detecting

burn severity is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
(NDVI), which uses bands in visible and infrared parts of
the spectrum (Salvador et al. 2000). However, NDVI is inac-
curate where fires occur after vegetation has died (Eva and
Lambin 1998) as well as in areas that had little vegetation
before the disturbance (Rogan and Yool 2001). Wilson and
Sader (2002), however, found that differencing bands 4 and
5 had high accuracy to detect forest harvest. Likewise, Xiao
et al. (2002) found this combination useful when classifying
forest types. Chuvieco et al. (2002) examined indices using
combinations of bands 3 and 5 as well as bands 3 and 7 to
estimate water content of live fuels for fire danger. However,
any method using bands in the visible part of the spectrum is
susceptible to atmospheric interference from dust and smoke
(Avery and Berlin 1992; Eva and Lambin 1998).Accordingly,
several studies have concluded that using short-wave infrared
bands to analyse burn severity provides highest accuracies
(White et al. 1996; Roy et al. 1999; Rogan and Yool 2001).
Recently, the Joint NPS-USGS National Burn Severity
Mapping Project implemented a method called the Normal-
ized Burn Ratio (NBR) of bands 4 and 7 to map fires (Key and
Benson 2005). The difference between pre-fire and post-fire
NBR, NBR, is now the primary method for mapping large
remote fires on public lands. A ground assessment method,
the Composite Burn Index (CBI), was developed along with
the NBR. This method rates all layers of the forest that are
affected in a fire, resulting in a single value that can be com-
pared to the satellite imagery. Because there is no universal
definition of burn severity, neither NBR nor CBI can be
said to represent the ‘true’ severity. However, the degree to
which these two systems are related to each other is an impor-
tant question because of the high cost of fire rehabilitation
activities that are based on burn severity maps.
We compared NBR, CBI and permanent plots measured
before and after fire on a wildfire that burned over previously
measured plots covering a broad range of elevation, fuels, and
community types, resulting in varying burn severity levels.
We re-measured the permanent plots and compared the fire
severity with satellite imagery classified with NBR. Our
objectives were: (1) to assess the agreement between NBR
and CBI in differentiating burn severity levels; (2) to compare
pre-fire and post-fire measurements on permanent plots with
severity type as classified by the NBR; and (3) to evaluate
the characteristics of forest areas that burned with different
severity levels.
Study area
The study area was the Leroux fire on the south side of
the San Francisco Peaks, Coconino National Forest, north
of Flagstaff, Arizona (lat. 35◦18′ N, long. 111◦41′ W). Tree
species included ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa var. scop-
ulorum P. & C. Lawson), quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides
Michx.), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco
var. glauca (Beissn.) Franco), Limber pine (Pinus flexilis

James), and Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry
ex Engelm.). The closest available weather data were from
the Fort Valley weather station (www.wrcc.dri.edu); 1909–
2001 mean January temperatures were 5.2◦C maximum and
−12.3◦C minimum. Mean July temperatures were 26.7◦C
maximum and 7.1◦C minimum. Mean annual precipitation
was 56.9 cm.
The Leroux fire started on 11 June 2001 and was contained
by 19 June 2001. The interior continued to burn through
late June with some flare-ups in early July, eventually cov-
ering over 500 ha (Fig. 1). Maximum daily temperatures
measured at the Fort Valley weather station from 11 to 19
June 2001 ranged from 21.1◦C to 29.4◦C, with average max-
imum temperature of 26.5◦C. Minimum temperatures ranged
from −6.1◦C to 3.8◦C, with an average of −0.19◦C. Precip-
itation was minimal with less than 0.03 cm daily or a total
of 0.18 cm during the week before containment. Wind data
were not available at Fort Valley, but wind speeds averaged
13.5 km h−1 (kph) at Pulliam Airport in Flagstaff. Maxi-
mum wind speeds that held constant for 5 s reached up to

64.4 kph, and maximum wind speeds that held constant for
2 min reached 48.3 kph.
Methods
Image processing
Pre-burn imagery was acquired with Landsat 7 ETM+ path
37, row 35 on 6 June 2000. Following the recommendation of
Key and Benson (2005), we used a post-burn image (2001)
for immediate assessment after the fire as well as for choosing
ground-truthing sites (CBI), and a later image (2002) for a
1-year post-fire assessment. The 2002 image coincided with
re-measurement of permanent plots in that year. Post-burn
images were Landsat 7 ETM+ for path 37, row 35 from 27
July 2001 and 12 June 2002. Image date can affect NBR
analysis, so the 2000 and 2002 images were selected as close
together as possible (June). The July image in 2001 was the
earliest available after the fire. All images had 30-m resolu-
tion. Images were received terrain-corrected; this involved an
algorithm using digital elevation models to correct for dis-
placement. ERDAS Imagine (Erdas, Inc.,Atlanta, GA, USA)
was used to perform all image processing functions. The
images were registered to each other using nearest neighbor
re-sampling and a second-order polynomial model (Lillesand
and Kiefer 1994). We used at least 80 ground control points
for each image. Root mean square errors were 0.5 m for the
2000–2002 registration, and 4.0 m for the 2000–2001 regis-
tration (Lillesand and Kiefer 1994; Jensen 1996).
Raw DN values were converted to radiance values as
in Markham and Barker (1986). This conversion accounted
for gain and bias, daily sun angle variation, earth–sun dis-
tances, and exo-atmospheric solar irradiance. The need for
atmospheric normalization was tested (Eckhardt et al. 1991;
Jensen 1996) but found unnecessary because the coefficient
of determination was larger than 0.98 in each case (Jensen
1996; Key and Benson 2005).
The NBR was calculated for all three images using
the equation (TM4 −TM7)/(TM4 +TM7), where TM4 and
TM7 were Thematic Mapper bands 4 and 7 respectively
(Key and Benson 2005). Band 4 covered wavelengths 0.76–
0.90 µm (near-infrared) and band 7 covered wavelengths
2.08–2.35 µm (middle-infrared). We calculated NBR =
NBRprefire −NBRpostfire, for both 2000–2001 and 2000–
2002.Values of zero indicated no change and numbers farther
from zero indicated greater change. Resulting digital num-
ber values from NBR were divided into four burn severity
classes following the procedures suggested by the Fire Effects
Inventory and Monitoring Protocol (Key and Benson 2005),
except that we used only four rather than seven categories:
unburned (≤50), low (51–240), moderate (241–570), and
high (≥571). Aerial photos and field notes were used to help
interpret the satellite image and select burn thresholds. High-
severity areas were those that experienced the most alteration
following the fire, such as high tree mortality, high con-
sumption of ground fuels and lack of post-fire regeneration.
Low-severityareashadlowermortality,lowfuelconsumption
and higher amounts of regeneration. From here on, the 2000–
2001 differenced image will be referred to as the 2001 burn
map, and the 2000–2002 differenced image will be referred
to as the 2002 burn map.
Composite Burn Index plots
The CBI, a rating of up to 22 factors from overstory, shrubs
and saplings, herbaceous understory, soils and fuels, was used
to collect ground data (Key and Benson 2005). We selected
CBI locations from the 2001 burn map by stratified random
sampling in the four severity levels, choosing sites within
3 × 3 pixels (0.81 ha) (Congalton 2001) to reduce global
positioning system error and edge effects. A four-pixel filter
was used where CBI plots fell on severity level edges. Key
and Benson (2005) recommended sampling 20–40 plots per
severity type. However, the small size of the fire constrained
sample size because there were insufficient homogeneous
3 × 3 pixel areas. Therefore we carried out CBI sampling
with 17 unburned plots, 35 low severity plots, 25 moderate
severity plots, and 15 high severity plots.
The NBR and CBI values were compared with Kappa
analysis (KHAT). ‘Errors’were defined as misclassifications
in which the NBR analysis indicated burning at a point that
was found not to have been burned, or vice versa, when visited
on the ground for CBI sampling. Other instances of differ-
ences in classification between the NBR and CBI systems
were referred to as ‘inconsistencies’. KHAT was also used to
determine whether inconsistency matrices were significantly
different than each other (Congalton and Green 1999). An α
level of 0.05 was used for the Kappa statistic.
Permanent plots: pre-fire and post-fire measurements
Before the fire, we had established permanent study plots in
2000 for research on forest structure of the San Francisco
Peaks (Cocke 2004). Sampling plot centers were located
from a systematic grid 300 m N–S and 300 m or 600 m E–W.
Eighteen plots were within the perimeter of the Leroux Fire.
Plots were 0.1 ha (20 × 50 m) in size. Tree species, diameter
at breast height (dbh), height, and condition were mea-
sured. Seedling trees, those below 2.5 cm dbh, were tallied
by species, conditions, and height class in a 50 m2 subplot.
Importance values (the sum of the relative frequency and rel-
ative abundance for each species) were calculated for each
plot to determine dominant species (Taylor 2000). Under-
story vegetation cover and tree canopy cover were sampled
along point line–intercept transects (the two 50-m sidelines of
each plot). Canopy cover and understory herbaceous vegeta-
tion measurements had been completed on only 14 of the
18 plots before the Leroux Fire. Forest floor and woody
debris were measured along four 15.24 m planar intersect
transects per plot (Brown 1974). Woody debris was recorded

by size/timelag classes (Anderson 1982): 1, 10, 100, and
1000-h (sound and rotten) fuels and litter (L layer, unde-
composed material) and duff (F and H layers, decomposing
materials or humus) depths were measured.
In 2002, all 18 of the burned plots, and 6 unburned
plots that were randomly selected from near the fire, were
re-measured. For trees, we recorded condition class, char
and scorch heights, and percentage crown scorch following
procedures outlined by NPS (2003). Fuels were re-measured
along the original transects. We also recorded substrate burn
severity levels at the litter and duff measurement points.
These were rated on a scale of 1–4, with 1 being the most
affected (NPS 2003).
We used the 2002 NBR burn severity map to classify
the 24 permanent plots by severity level. Because perma-
nent plots were 50 × 20 m and centerline azimuth was based
on topography rather than on a specific bearing, plots did not
coincide with individual pixels.We used the pixel around plot
centre, as this 30 × 30 m area covered the greatest proportion
of the plot. However, if plot locations appeared unburned
according to the map, but were within one pixel of a burned
plot, then the plot was considered low severity. For the 2002
image,thereweresixlowseverityplots,eightmoderatesever-
ity plots, and four high severity plots. From here on, the
combination of high severity plots will be referred to as HI.
The other categories will be referred to as MD, LO and UN.
Statistical findings are presented only where there was
significance. Normality of the permanent plot data was
assessed graphically and values were logarithmically trans-
formed where necessary to meet assumptions of ANOVA.
Pre-fire differences in live tree density, live tree basal area,
snag density, seedling density, substrate, canopy cover, lit-
ter depths, duff depths, fine fuels, coarse fuels, percentage
scorch, and scorch and char heights between severity levels
were compared with ANOVA (e.g. to compare live tree den-
sities between severity levels before the fire). Following an
overall significantANOVA result,Tukey’s Honest Significant
Difference test was used to test for significant differences
between severity levels. Paired t-tests were used to test dif-
ferences before and after the fire on variables within each
severity type including live tree density, live tree basal area,
snag density, seedling density, canopy cover, litter depths,
duff depths, fine fuels, and coarse fuels. The α level for all
tests was 0.05.
Results
Comparison of NBR and CBI
The NBR and CBI methods had an overall agreement of
75% for the 2001 burn map and 73% for the 2002 burn
map (Table 1). Producer’s and user’s accuracies, calculated
with values in the error matrix (Table 2), present agreement
between the NBR and CBI in each severity level. For exam-
ple in 2001, 100% of the plots unburned on the ground were
also found to be unburned on the map. However, only 71% of
the plots that were unburned on the map were also unburned
on the ground. These accuracies show the inconsistencies
between all severity levels.
Scatter plots of NBR v. CBI by image year showed a rela-
tivelystrongcorrelation;r was0.84(P < 0.001)forboth2001
and 2002 (Fig. 2). In 2001, the largest source of error was
confusion between unburned and low severity areas (32% of
errors) when some low severity areas appeared unburned on
the imagery (Table 2). In 2002, most misclassifications also
occurred between unburned and low severity areas (40%) but,
unlike 2001, the analysis showed burns in unburned areas. In
2001, there were two cases where classifications differed by
more than one severity level (the ground data suggested that
these two plots had high severities while they appeared as low
severity on the map). Differences of more than one class did
not occur in 2002. High severity areas had the lowest degree
of inconsistent classification in both years.

KHAT (kappa analysis) statistics were 66% for the 2001
burn map and 62% for the 2002 burn map, showing that
the agreement of NBR and CBI in both maps was statisti-
cally better than chance (Table 1) (Lillesand and Kiefer 1994;
Congalton and Green 1999). Classifications for 2001 and
2002 were not significantly different from each other (Z =
0.442) (Congalton and Green 1999).
Permanent plot data: overstory
As measured on the 18 burned permanent plots, the fire
burned more severely in areas dominated by ponderosa
pine and areas located on flatter slopes and lower eleva-
tions. Ponderosa pine was always dominant in HI (in all
cases, importance value was >91% ponderosa pine). For
MD, four of the plots were predominantly ponderosa pine,
two were predominantly aspen, and two were mixed conifer
(Douglas-fir, limber pine, ponderosa pine). For LO, four were
dominated by ponderosa pine, one was mixed conifer, and
one was aspen. For HI plots average slope = 15%, followed
by MD = 17.8%, and LO = 18.3%. Elevations were also
lowest for HI, with average elevation 2594 m, MD = 2648 m,
and LO = 2624 m. All plots were south-facing and aspect
differences were minor.
Tree mortality was greatest in areas of high pre-fire tree
density, especially dense ponderosa pine (Fig. 3). Pre-fire
densities were greatest in HI (1400 trees ha−1) and lowest
in LO (638 trees ha−1) (Table 3). The fire reduced live tree

density in all severity levels. Because the HI plots were pre-
dominantly ponderosa pine before the fire, this resulted in
only 41% mortality of ponderosa, while limber pine experi-
enced 86% mortality. Similarly, all P. menziesii in HI plots
were killed.Thus, a higher proportion of the fire resistant pon-
derosa pine was killed in MD v. HI (Fig. 4). Overall percent
decrease was greatest in MD (69%).
High burn severity was associated with high pre-fire den-
sity and basal area of snags (Table 4). Pre-fire differences
were significant between HI and LO (Tukey, P = 0.027)
and HI and MD (Tukey, P = 0.006). Post-fire snag den-
sity was greatest in HI (880 trees ha−1), although post-fire
snag basal area was slightly lower in HI (19.9 m2 ha−1)
than MD (20.1 m2 ha−1). However, relative increase in snags
was greatest in MD (1162%) compared to HI (123%), LO
(196%) and UN (decreased by 25%). Snags with dbh ≥50 cm,
often the most important for wildlife, had high survival rates
(Table 5). About half of these large snags fell during the fire,
but more new large snags were created. On the 18 permanent
plots, only one of the 18 large trees that died during the fire
also fell; 17 remained standing.

depths of 0.7 cm, while LO maintained a slightly deeper duff
layer of 1.0 cm.
Fire severity had little relation to coarse woody debris. Pre-
fire fuels less than 7.6 cm diameter (0–100 h fuels) averaged
8.9 Mg ha−1 in MD, 7.0 Mg ha−1 in LO, 6.1 Mg ha−1 in HI
and 9.5 Mg ha−1 in UN. Decreases were significant only
in LO (paired t-test, P < 0.001), with post-fire values of
2.7 Mg ha−1 for LO (62% decrease), 6.0 Mg ha−1 for MD
(32%) and 3.1 Mg ha−1 for HI (49%). Similar to the finer
fuels, moderately burned areas had highest pre-fire heavy
fuels (greater than 7.6 cm diameter, 1000-h fuels), but expe-
rienced the greatest change and had least fuels following
the fire. MD had 119.8 Mg ha−1, LO had 94.8 Mg ha−1 and
HI had 22.9 Mg ha−1 of 1000-h fuels. UN had 60.0 Mg ha−1
before the fire. Change was greatest in MD (93%), then LO
(80%), and lowest in HI (47%). Decreases were significant in
LO (paired t-test P ≤0.001). Post-fire 1000 h fuel values were
18.6 Mg ha−1 for LO, 8.3 Mg ha−1 for MD and 12.1 Mg ha−1
for HI.
Understory herbaceous cover was lowest in severely
burned plots, both before and after the fire, but still expe-
rienced greatest overall change. HI experienced 69% average
cover decrease (from 18% to 5%), whereas MD and LO
decreased by 41% (from 40% to 24%) and 49% (from 28%
to 15%) respectively.
Summarizing the changes on permanent plots, most vari-
ables changed in a manner consistent with the burn severity
assigned to each plot in the NBR analysis (Table 7). The
substrate burn severity rating system, a qualitative measure-
ment, showed greatest severity in HI. The HI plots also
experienced the highest decline in understory cover and
regeneration (Table 7).
Discussion
Comparison of NBR and CBI
The NBR and CBI were relatively consistent in mapping
burn severity, especially in high severity areas, similar to the
findings of Van Wagtendonk et al. (2004) in a California fire.
Inaccuracies in NBR occurred between unburned and low
burn areas. One type of error, when areas that had burned
appeared unburned on the imagery, occurred on 7.6% of the
CBI plots in the 2001 map and 3.3% in the 2002 map. This
misclassification may be due to re-growth of vegetation after
the fire. Fuller and Fulk (2001) found that post-fire vegeta-
tion re-growth in Indonesia altered reflectances causing error
between unburned and burned areas; this has also occurred
within 1 year of a fire in Alaska tundra (Hall et al. 1980).
Detecting accurate fire perimeters is difficult if the post-burn
imagery is acquired at least one growing season following the
fire. Thus, if mapping fire perimeters is the main objective,
it should be done soon after the fire (White et al. 1996). In
northernArizona,mostfiresoccurinearlysummer(Grissino-
Mayer et al. 1995) before the monsoonal rains, when most
vegetation growth occurs. Within a few months of the fire,
some areas of the Leroux experienced high re-growth and the
burn became difficult to detect, especially in meadows. Rapid
initial assessment is therefore important for burn perimeter
mapping in the Southwest.
In the 2002 burn map, the largest errors occurred where
the imagery showed low severity burns in areas that did not
burn, occurring on 6.5% of the plots. During drought, mois-
ture content may be as low in areas that did not burn as areas
that were lightly burned. Because the two bands used in the
NBR are sensitive to vegetation and soil moisture, low
severity burns and unburned areas are less distinguishable
in extreme drought (Key and Benson 2005). Furthermore,
2001 was not an extremely dry year; there were no errors
where the NBR showed burns in areas that had not burned
on the 2001 burn map. However, perhaps the most common
reason to study burn severity is to target areas for recovery.
Detecting high burn areas was the most accurate and these
areas changed only 12.5% from 2001 to 2002. The borders
of severely burned areas continued to be distinct, while other
severity classes blurred at a faster rate, similar to the findings
of Hall et al. (1980). In sum, extended assessment performed
equally as well as initial assessment for high severity mapping
for the Leroux fire.
The use of fewer severity classes, such as combining low
and unburned classes, should increase consistency but may
reduce the utility of the map for managers. Miller and Yool
(2002) found that three burn classes had higher agreement
(KHAT > 0.7) than four burn classes. However, we used four
burn classes but obtained agreement similar to Miller and
Yool’s supervised classification.
Overall, the NBR was useful for examining immediate
effects of the fire and longer-term effects, as the 2001 and
2002 burn maps were not statistically different. However,
there were several sources of inconsistencies. The qualitative
series of estimates that comprise the CBI may have varied
over time and between measurers. Another concern in north-
ern Arizona results from the timing of fire season prior to
monsoonal rains. In 2001, rain caused considerable erosion
in the burned areas, as evidenced by exposed drainages and

196

roots, as well as very heavy litter and duff deposition on the
uphill sides of trees. Therefore, some evidence of fire sever-
ity may have been lost. The issue of edge was also a concern.
While we avoided edges when placing the CBI plots, this was
notpossiblewiththe24pre-existingpermanentplots,sosome
plots were on severity level edges. Using different size filters
(4 pixels and 9 pixels) produced variable results. Therefore,
scale must be carefully considered when performing this type
of analysis.
Comparing NBR with detailed ground measurements
Ground-basedfireseverityfrompermanentplotswasstrongly
associated with satellite-based severity in which multiple
variables, not just tree mortality, comprise burn severity. The
greatest tree mortality occurred in MD rather than HI, but
species composition played a large role. Many trees that were
killed in lower severity levels were aspen, which are more
susceptible to heat (Brown and DeByle 1987). For example,
one HI plot had 29% mortality but was dominated by pon-
derosa pine. Likewise, one MD plot had 80% mortality but
was dominated by aspen. Because less heat is required to
kill aspen (Jones and DeByle 1985), burn severity was not
necessarily higher where mortality was higher. Clearly, tree
mortality is not the only important factor in burn severity and
the imagery did detect a combination of factors. For exam-
ple, the HI plot with 29% overstory mortality experienced
70% decrease in understory cover, whereas the MD plot with
80% overstory mortality experienced an understory decrease
of only 5%. Similarly, plots with greatest mortality did not
necessarily have the highest substrate severity ratings. The
highestseverityratingoccurredonaplotwithlowtreemortal-
ity. Regeneration also demonstrated these patterns. Although
mortality was high on some MD plots, large amounts of aspen
re-growth may have dominated in the imagery. HI plots had
very little aspen regrowth. The data suggest that one attribute
of a plot can be severely affected while other attributes are
minimally affected and that the imagery is detecting these
combinations (Table 7).
Examining the multiple effects of a fire becomes a chal-
lenge as imagery cannot distinguish whether severity rat-
ings come from overstory, soils, or understory. Because the
NBR comprehensively assesses burn severity, managers
must understand the consequences of using this method.
Before management objectives are clarified, it is important
to assess areas on the ground. Procedures followed in Burned
Area Emergency Rehabilitation (BAER) include immediate
analysis of burned areas and rehabilitation (Robichaud et al.
2000). BAER measurements include severity, intensity, soil
color changes, grass root crowns, shrubs, channel bottoms,
water resources values and recovery. This type of ground
assessment can be used to select appropriate management
actions, minimizing the use of less desirable methods such
as using non-native seeds (Caetano 1995).
Can we determine what caused some areas to
burn with more severity?
The present study cannot be applied to predict effects of other
fires in the region, but it is of interest to evaluate the asso-
ciation between pre-fire forest structure, composition, and
fuels and fire severity. Because the size and intensity of wild-
fires are increasing in south-western forests (Covington 2000;
Swetnam and Baisan 2003), links between forest characteris-
tics and potential fire behavior could be useful for prioritizing
fuel treatments.
Despite its small size, the Leroux Fire burned in a mosaic
of unburned to severely burned areas at fairly fine scales, but
with some clear differences in severity that were related to
pre-fire conditions.
Burn severity was greatest in dense areas with high basal
areas, especially those that were dominated by ponderosa
pine. Ponderosa pine density is very high in the Southwest
due to fire suppression policies of the last century (Weaver
1951; Cooper 1960; Covington and Moore 1994). Increases
in tree density have lead to increases in canopy cover, fuel
loadings, and vertical and horizontal fuel continuity (Ander-
son and Brown 1988; Covington and Moore 1994). Severely
burned areas were also characterized by high pre-fire snag
densities and greater pre-fire litter and duff depths than other
severity levels. The loose arrangement of needles in pon-
derosa pine stands fosters greater flammability, compared
with shorter-needle pines (Anderson and Brown 1988) and
aspen stands (Jones and DeByle 1985; Dahms and Geils
1997). Duff serves as a relatively long-burning fuel, although
residence time is affected not only by depth (Sackett 1988)
but also by soil moisture content, duff moisture content, and
the ratio of organic to inorganic content (Frandsen and Ryan
1986; Frandsen 1987; Ryan and Frandsen 1991; Hartford and
Frandsen 1992).
In contrast, severe burning was not associated with stee-
per slopes, higher elevation, or pre-fire coarse woody debris,
which was actually lowest in the most severely burned areas.
These counter-intuitive results suggest that the influence of
flammable ponderosa pine vegetation and surface fuels was
greater than other factors in affecting severity of the Leroux
fire.As many mountain ranges in the Southwest share similar
elevational gradients from ponderosa pine up through mixed
conifer and aspen forests, fuel reduction treatments might
be most beneficial for the entire landscape if focused on the
low-elevation ponderosa pine vegetation type.
