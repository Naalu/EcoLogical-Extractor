Abstract We sought to understand differences in tree
response to meteorological drought among species and
soil types at two ecotone forests in northern Arizona, the
pinyon-juniper woodland/ponderosa pine ecotone, and the
higher elevation, wetter, ponderosa pine/mixed conifer
ecotone. We used two approaches that provide different
information about drought response: the ratio of standar-
dized radial growth in wet years to dry years (W:D) for the
period between years 1950 and 2000 as a measure of
growth response to drought, and δ13C in leaves formed in
non-drought (2001) and drought (2002) years as a measure
of change in water use efficiency (WUE) in response to
drought. W:D and leaf δ13C response to drought for Pinus
edulis and P. ponderosa did not differ for trees growing on
coarse-texture soils derived from cinders compared with
finer textured soils derived from flow basalts or sedimen-
tary rocks. P. ponderosa growing near its low elevation
range limit at the pinyon-juniper woodland/ponderosa pine
ecotone had a greater growth response to drought (higher
W:D) and a larger increase in WUE in response to drought
than co-occurring P. edulis growing near its high elevation
range limit. P. flexilis and Pseudotsuga menziesii growing
near their low elevation range limit at the ponderosa pine/
mixed conifer ecotone had a larger growth response to
drought than co-occurring P. ponderosa growing near its
high elevation range limit. Increases in WUE in response
to drought were similar for all species at the ponderosa
pine/mixed conifer ecotone. Low elevation populations of
P. ponderosa had greater growth response to drought than
high-elevation populations, whereas populations had a
similar increase in WUE in response to drought. Our
findings of different responses to drought among co-
occurring tree species and between low- and high-
elevation populations are interpreted in the context of
drought impacts on montane coniferous forests of the
southwestern USA.

Introduction
Drought is the most limiting factor to tree growth in
southwestern USA (Fritts 1976: Meko et al. 1995:
Swetnam and Betancourt 1998: Hidalgo et al. 2001).
Climate change models predict higher temperatures and
increased variability in precipitation in the future for the
Southwest (Gregory et al. 1997; Rosenberg et al. 2003).
These changes may increase the frequency and intensity of
drought (Lawford 1993; Hanson and Weltzin 2000) and
change the distribution of tree species and forest types
(Allen and Breshears 1998).
Tree rings have been widely used to understand
relationships between tree growth and climate factors
such
as
drought
(e.g.,
LeBlanc
and
Foster
1992;
Graumlich 1993; Loehle and LeBlanc 1996; Villalba et
al. 1994; Ettl and Peterson 1995; Barber et al. 2000; Cook
et al. 2001; Cullen et al. 2001; Peterson and Peterson
2001). The carbon stable isotope composition (δ13C) of
leaves is a time-integrated index of the ratio of leaf internal
to ambient CO2concentration that can be used to infer
photosynthetic
WUE
(Ehleringer
1991;
Pate
2001;
Dawson et al. 2002) and has been used to compare
response to drought among species and environments
(e.g., Lajtha and Getz 1993; Marshall and Zhang 1994;
Williams and Ehleringer 1996; Panek and Waring 1997;
Sparks and Ehleringer 1997; Leffler and Evans 1999;
Warren et al. 2001). The use of δ13C and tree ring data can
provide a rich perspective on differences and underlying
mechanisms of drought response in trees (Mazany et al.
1980; Livingston and Spittlehouse 1993; McNulty and
Swank 1995; Panek and Waring 1997; Saurer et al. 1997;
Brooks et al. 1998; Ferrio et al. 2003). δ13C can provide

information on WUE, whereas tree rings provide informa-
tion on carbon allocation to stem growth and character-
istics correlated with tree size, such as competitive ability.
Tree species that are sensitive to drought have been
reported to respond to drought with larger reductions in
growth and greater increases in WUE inferred from δ13C
than more drought tolerant species (e.g., Ferrio et al.
2003).
In this study, we used tree ring growth and leaf δ13C to
better understand differences in tree response to meteor-
ological drought among species at two ecotone forests in
northern Arizona, the pinyon-juniper woodland/ponderosa
pine forest ecotone, and the higher elevation, wetter,
ponderosa pine/mixed conifer forest ecotone. Trees in
ecotones are at the limits of their distributions growing
under stress (Shelford 1931; Allen and Breshears 1998).
Tree stress and mortality due to climate change and
drought are likely to occur first and be most severe at
ecotones (Allen and Breshears 1998; Loehle 2000).
Differences in mortality among tree species at the
pinyon-juniper woodland/ponderosa pine forest ecotone
in response to drought can cause dramatic shifts in the
spatial occurrence of forest communities (Allen and
Breshears 1998). Large inter-annual variation in tree ring
growth of P. edulis at this ecotone has been linked to high
mortality after drought (Ogle et al. 2000). In contrast,
effects of drought on higher elevation forests of south-
western USA are largely unknown.
We compared response to drought using leaf δ13C and
tree-ring growth: (1) among soils and species at the
pinyon-juniper/ponderosa pine forest ecotone, (2) among
species at the ponderosa pine/mixed conifer ecotone, and
(3) between high- and low-elevation populations of P.
ponderosa. We expected the greatest response to drought
in growth and WUE inferred from leaf δ13C for tree
species, or populations within a species, that occurred on
unusually dry sites, such as excessively drained soils, or at
low elevations within the range of a species, such as at
ecotones. At the pinyon-juniper/ponderosa pine ecotone
we hypothesized that response to drought would be
highest for trees growing on the coarsest soils which
were derived from volcanic cinders, intermediate for trees
growing on soils derived from flow basalts (moderate
texture), and lowest for trees growing on the finest texture
soils derived from sedimentary parent materials (H1). At
both ecotones, we hypothesized that a species growing
near its low elevation range limit would be more
responsive to drought than a species growing near its
high elevation range limit (H2). Thus, we predicted P.
ponderosa to be more responsive to drought than P. edulis
at the pinyon-juniper/ponderosa pine forest ecotone, and P.
menziesii and P. flexilis to be more responsive to drought
than P. ponderosa at the ponderosa pine/mixed conifer
forest
ecotone.
We
hypothesized
that
low-elevation
populations of P. ponderosa would be more responsive
to drought than high-elevation populations because of less
available soil water at low elevations (H3). Last, we
hypothesized that species with a large response of growth
to drought would have a large increase in WUE in
response to drought because of a large reduction in
stomatal conductance that decreases water loss and
photosynthate available for growth (H4).
Materials and methods
Study areas
We selected 12 sites near roads and hiking trails within the
Coconino National Forest in the vicinity of Flagstaff, Arizona. Nine
sites at the pinyon-juniper/ponderosa ecotone were located near the
low elevation range limit (2,000 m) of P. ponderosa. Accurate
characterization of the pinyon-juniper/ponderosa pine ecotone
required sampling over three soils. Three sites each were selected
on
soils
derived
from
sedimentary
bedrock
(limestone
and
sandstone), flow basalt, and basalt cinders. These soils differ in
texture; the sedimentary soils were classified as fine sandy loams,
the flow basalt soils as clay loams or coarse sandy loams, and the
cinder soils as loamy coarse sands or coarse sands. Previous studies
have shown lower levels of soil nitrogen mineralization, soil water
content, and tree predawn water potential in soils derived from
basalt cinders compared with sedimentary rocks near our study sites
(Mopper et al. 1991; Gehring and Whitham 1995). We selected three
additional sites at the ponderosa pine/mixed conifer forest ecotone
on the western side of the San Francisco Peaks near the low
elevation range limits of P. menziesii and P. flexilis and the high
elevation limit of P. ponderosa (2,600 m). All soils at the ponderosa
pine/mixed conifer forest ecotone are derived from andesite or
basalt. Geographical location, soil data, and other site characteristics
are summarized in Adams (2003).
Dendrochronological methods
At each site, we selected ten trees of each species in dominant or co-
dominant canopy positions and avoided trees with heavy insect or
other damage. Between July 2001 and February 2003, two
increment cores were sampled from each tree at 1.4 m above the
ground from the south and west sides of the tree, mounted, sanded
using successively finer sandpaper, and then polished. We measured
ring widths to the nearest 0.01 mm using a Microcode II measuring
banister system (Boeckler Instruments, Tucson, Ariz.) and the
Measure J2X computer software (Project J2X), and crossdated cores
visually using narrow marker years from a P. ponderosa chronology
at the Gus Pearson natural area (2,237 m in elevation) in the
Coconino national forest (Graybill and Rose 1989; P.Z. Fulé,
unpublished data ) available from the International Tree-Ring Data
Bank (World Data Center for Paleoclimatology, NOAA). Cross-
dating was validated using skeleton plots (Stokes and Smiley 1968;
Schweingruber 1988) and COFECHA computer software (Holmes
et al. 1986; Grissino-Mayer 2001, International tree ring data bank
program library). Cores that would not crossdate well were excluded
from further analysis.
We averaged pairs of ring-width series for each tree, and then
standardized series using linear regression and by dividing residuals
by predicted values to create a ring-width index (RWI) for each
annual ring (Schweingruber 1988; Fritts and Swetnam 1989). This
de-trending method results in a unitless RWI with a constant
variance. Only rings formed between 1950 and 2000 were
standardized because this period contained much variability in
precipitation and Palmer drought severity indent (PDSI), instru-
mental climate data are not available locally before 1909, and
because crossdating and measuring only these years on each core
made it possible to include more trees in the study.

Tree-ring data analysis
We used PDSI, a region-specific index of meteorological drought
calculated from precipitation, temperature, and potential evapotran-
spiration (Palmer 1965; Alley 1984), as a measure of drought. We
obtained instrumentally calculated PDSI data for Arizona region 2
from the National Climate Data Center at NOAA. Eight dry and
eight wet years were selected between 1950 and 2000 for
comparisons of tree radial growth (Fig. 1). Selected dry years had
an annual average PDSI less than −2.0 and selected wet years had an
annual average PDSI greater than 2.0. Between 1950 and 2000,
PDSI in Arizona region 2 was strongly related to winter precipi-
tation (r=0.76, P<0.01); dry winters were associated with low PDSI.
We calculated an average RWI for each tree for the eight dry years
and for the eight wet years, and then calculated the ratio of RWI in
wet years to dry years (W:D) (Fekedulegn et al. 2003). We
compared W:D among elevations, species, and soil parent materials
using ANOVA with SPSS 11.0 for Windows statistical software
(SPSS, Chicago). At the pinyon-juniper/ponderosa pine ecotone, we
used species, soil, site nested within soil, and the species × soil
interaction as sources of variation. At the ponderosa pine/mixed
conifer ecotone we used species, site, and the species × site
interaction in the ANOVA model. For the elevation comparison of P.
ponderosa, elevation and site nested within elevation were the
sources of variation in the ANOVA. Because differences in W:D can
be caused by a growth reduction during dry years, a growth increase
in wet years, or both, we also analyzed RWI separately for dry and
wet years using ANOVA.
Autocorrelation coefficients were calculated for each species at
each ecotone to understand how much radial growth in the previous
year influenced current year radial growth (Fritts 1976; Orwig and
Abrams 1997). Lag one autocorrelation was generally low, averaged
0.23 over all species and communities, ranged between 0.01 and
0.41, and 77% of all values were ≤0.3. Therefore, growth in the
previous year had a small effect on growth in the current year.
Leaf δ13C and N
Between November 2002 and February 2003, we sampled leaves of
eight trees per species that were previously cored at each site.
Nearby similar dominant trees were sampled to replace a few dead
trees. We sampled from mid-canopy branches exposed to full sun on
the south and west sides of each tree, and removed green leaves
formed during each of the 2001 and 2002 growing seasons. Annual
PDSI values indicated that 2001 (0.4) was much wetter than 2002
(−4.4) (Fig. 1). We sampled leaves formed during the entire length
of the growing season of each year to avoid intra-seasonal bias (Pate
2001).
We oven-dried leaves at 70°C, pooled samples from the south and
west sides of each tree, and ground samples to 40 mesh. Ground
samples were analyzed for δ13C and nitrogen concentration (N) at
the Colorado Plateau Stable Isotope Laboratory at Northern Arizona
University, Flagstaff Ariz. using elemental analyzer-continuous flow
isotope ratio mass spectrometry with an Erba NC 2100 EA (Carlo)
interfaced to a Finnigan Delta Plus XL IRMS (Thermoquest, San
Jose, Calif.).
We analyzed δ13C data with repeated measures MANOVA with
year as the repeated factor and species, soil, site nested within soil,
and all interactions with year as sources of variation, using SPSS for
Windows 11.0. Differences in carboxylation capacity can be a
source of variation in δ13C data (Dawson et al. 2002), and leaf
nitrogen concentration (N) is a good indicator of maximum
carboxylation capacity (Field and Mooney 1986). Thus, we tested
the assumption that carboxylation capacity was similar among
species, soils, sites, and elevations by comparing leaf N with the
same model.
We measured δ13C on whole leaf tissue rather than extracted
cellulose because δ13C of whole tissue and cellulose are often
positively and strongly correlated (Ehleringer and Osmond 1989;
Schleser 1990; McNulty and Swank 1995; MacFarlane and Adams
1998; West et al. 2001; Jaggi et al. 2002). Structural non-labile
carbon is a much larger proportion of whole leaf tissue than non-
structural, labile carbon and thus variation in whole tissue δ13C
reflects variation in isotopes of carbon used for leaf synthesis more
than variation in amounts of labile constituents (Pate 2001). The
effect of shading on leaf δ13C of older needles was not a
confounding factor because only current year (2002) and 1-year-
old (2001) needles were sampled on branches exposed to full sun.
Branch and leaf growth in 2002 were suppressed due to drought
which resulted in little shading of 2001 foliage.
Results
Tree ring W:D
At the pinyon-juniper/ponderosa pine ecotone, W:D did
not differ among soils (P>0.1). P. ponderosa had a higher
W:D than P. edulis at all soils (P<0.01, Fig. 2a). The low-
elevation population of P. ponderosa had a greater W:D
than the high-elevation-population (P<0.01, Fig. 2b).
At the ponderosa pine/mixed conifer ecotone a signif-
icant species × site interaction (P<0.05) complicated
interpretation of main effects, so ANOVA was performed
on data from each site separately (Fig. 2c). At site one, P.
menziesii had higher W:D than P. ponderosa and P. flexilis
(P<0.05). At site 2, P. flexilis had higher W:D than P.
ponderosa (P<0.05), and W:D for P. menziesii did not
differ from the other species (P>0.05). At site three, P.
menziesii and P. flexilis had higher W:D than P. ponderosa
(P<0.05).

growth comparisons. Leaf δ13C was measured in 2001 (non-
drought) and 2002 (extreme drought)
219

(P>0.1). P. ponderosa had a greater RWI in wet years than
P. edulis (P<0.001, Table 1). In contrast, P. edulis had a
greater RWI in dry years than P. ponderosa (P<0.001,
Table 2).
At the ponderosa pine/mixed conifer ecotone, P.
menziesii and P. flexilis had higher RWI in wet years
than P. ponderosa (P<0.001, Table 1). A significant
species × site interaction complicated interpretation of
main effects in an ANOVA on dry year RWI at the
ponderosa pine/mixed conifer ecotone, so separate ana-
lyses were performed at each site. Mean RWI in dry years
was greater for P. ponderosa than P. menziesii and P.
flexilis at site three (P<0.01), but there were no differences
among species at the other two sites (P>0.05, Table 2).
Low-elevation populations of P. ponderosa had higher
RWI
in
wet
years
than
high-elevation
populations
(P<0.001, Table 1). In contrast, low-elevation populations
had lower RWI in dry years than high-elevation popula-
tions (P<0.001, Table 2).
Leaf δ13C and N
For each species at each ecotone, leaf δ13C was less
negative in 2002 than 2001 (P<0.001, Fig. 3a–e). At the
pinyon-juniper/ponderosa pine ecotone, the year × species
interaction was significant (P<0.01), but the year × soil
interaction was not (P>0.1). P. ponderosa had a greater
response in leaf δ13C to the 2002 drought than P. edulis
(Fig. 3a–c). Average leaf δ13C was more negative for P.
ponderosa than P. edulis (Fig. 3a–c). Leaf N did not differ
among soils or between species at the pinyon-juniper/
ponderosa pine ecotone (P>0.05).
At the ponderosa pine/mixed conifer ecotone the year ×
species interaction in leaf δ13C was not significant (P>0.1,
Fig. 3e), indicating a similar change in leaf δ13C from
2001 to 2002 for all species. However, P. ponderosa had
more negative δ13C than P. flexilis and P. menziesii
(P<0.05). P. ponderosa had greater N for leaves formed in
2001 and 2002 (13.7 mg g−1, 12.8 mg g−1, respectively)
than P. flexilis (12.1 mg g−1, 12.2 mg g−1, respectively)
and P. menziesii (12.1 mg g−1, 10.5 mg g−1, respectively)
(P<0.05).

For P. ponderosa, the year × elevation interaction was a
significant (P<0.001) source of variation in leaf δ13C, and
high-elevation populations had a greater increase in leaf
δ13C in response to the 2002 drought than low-elevation
populations (Fig. 3d). There was no difference in leaf N
between populations for P. ponderosa (P>0.1).
Discussion
Our leaf N results suggest that variation in leaf δ13C
among species and between populations of P. ponderosa
was due to factors other than carboxylation capacity as leaf
N is a good indicator of maximum carboxylation capacity
(Field and Mooney 1986). Average N of current- and 1-
year-old P. ponderosa leaves sampled between November
and February in our study was similar to N of leaves
sampled in August in other studies in the vicinity of our
study sites (Feeney et al. 1998; Kolb et al. 1998; Kolb and
Stone 2000), suggesting little change in leaf N between
summer when most carbon assimilation occurs and winter
when we sampled for this species. Leaf N was similar
between species and among soils at the pinyon-juniper/
ponderosa pine ecotone, and between high- and low-
Table 2 Mean RWI in dry years for tree species at the pinyon-
juniper/ponderosa pine and ponderosa pine/mixed conifer ecotones,
and for low- and high-elevation populations of P. ponderosa. Lower
values of RWI indicate that a species or population had lower
growth during dry years relative to the overall growth trend between
years 1950 and 2000. At the ponderosa pine/mixed conifer ecotone a
significant species × site interaction (P<0.05) prevented interpreta-
tion of the main effects, so ANOVA was performed on each site.

elevation populations of P. ponderosa, which suggest
similar carboxylation capacity. However, differences in
leaf N occurred at the ponderosa pine/mixed conifer
ecotone where P. ponderosa had higher leaf N than P.
flexilis and P. menziesii. Higher leaf N and carboxylation
capacity for P. ponderosa compared with P. flexilis and P.
menziesii should have caused lower leaf internal CO2
concentration and less negative leaf δ13C for P. ponderosa
if all other influences on leaf δ13C were similar among
species. However, we found the opposite pattern; leaf δ13C
was more negative in P. ponderosa than P. flexilis and P.
menziesii in drought and non-drought years. This finding
suggest higher leaf internal CO2 concentration in P.
ponderosa than the other species because of higher
stomatal conductance, higher stomatal density (Hultine
and Marshall 2000), or because of differences in foliar
concentration of carbon compounds that differ in δ13C,
such as resins, lignin, and cellulose (Benner et al. 1987;
Ehleringer and Osmond 1989; Pate 2001).
Differences in photosynthetic WUE among plants can
be inferred from leaf δ13C because both are inversely
related to the ratio of leaf internal to ambient CO2-
concentration if ambient CO2concentration and leaf-to-air
vapor pressure deficit are similar (Farquhar et al. 1989;
Ehleringer 1991). Ambient CO2 concentration should have
been similar among the co-occurring species and between
sample years in our study because comparisons were made
with leaves from upper canopy, sunlit branches of trees in
the same stand. Leaf-to-air vapor pressure deficit also
should have been similar among co-occurring species
because leaf temperature of the needle-leaved species used
in our study is closely coupled with air temperature
(Campbell and Norman 1998).
Water use efficiency inferred from leaf δ13C was not
consistently associated with differences in elevation range
among species in the two ecotone forests we studied. At
the pinyon-juniper/ponderosa pine ecotone, WUE was
higher for P. edulis, which can grow on lower elevation,
drier sites than P. ponderosa. However, the pattern of
difference in WUE at the pinyon-juniper/ponderosa pine
ecotone—higher WUE for the species with a lower
elevation range—did not occur at the ponderosa pine/
mixed conifer ecotone, where P. flexilis and P. menziesii
had higher WUE than P. ponderosa, which has a lower
elevation range. Our results for photosynthetic WUE
inferred from leaf δ13C are the opposite of reports of lower
WUE for P. menziesii compared with P. ponderosa in the
northern Rocky Mountains (Pinol and Sala 2000).
Contrary to H1, response to drought measured by tree
ring W:D and leaf δ13C did not differ among soils derived
from volcanic cinders (coarse texture), flow basalts
(moderate texture), and sedimentary rocks (fine texture)
at the pinyon-juniper/ponderosa pine ecotone. Similar to
our results, other studies have shown little variation in leaf
δ13C of P. edulis across environmental gradients (Lajtha
and Getz 1993; Williams and Ehleringer 1996). However,
soil type can affect leaf-level gas exchange of P.
ponderosa in greenhouse experiments (Heidmann and
King 1992) and field plantations (Reynolds et al. 2000).
Other studies (Gehring and Whitham 1995; Ogle et al.
2000) have shown higher absolute radial growth rates of P.
edulis grown in soils derived from sedimentary compared
with
cinder
parent
materials
at
the
pinyon-juniper/
ponderosa pine ecotone near our study sites. However,
drought had similar negative effects on tree radial growth
and WUE at all soils at the pinyon-juniper/ponderosa pine
ecotone in our study.
Our second hypothesis (H2) was that a species growing
near its low elevation range limit would be more
responsive to drought than a co-occurring species growing
near its high elevation range limit. Consistent with H2,
both leaf δ13C and W:D showed that P. ponderosa was
more responsive to drought than P. edulis at the pinyon-
juniper/ponderosa pine ecotone. P. ponderosa had a larger
increase in leaf δ13C in response to the 2002 drought than
P. edulis, suggesting more stomatal closure and a larger
increase in WUE in response to drought for P. ponderosa.
Higher W:D of P. ponderosa compared with P. edulis was
due to a larger positive response of growth to wet years
and a larger negative response of growth to dry years for P.
ponderosa.
Support for H2 at the ponderosa pine/mixed conifer
ecotone varied between leaf δ13C and W:D. P. flexilis and
P. menziesii had a larger W:D than co-occurring P.
ponderosa. This difference in W:D was due to a larger
positive response of growth to wet years and a larger
negative response of growth to dry years for P. flexilis and
P. menziesii. However, all species had similar increases in
leaf δ13C between non-drought (2001) and drought (2002)
years which suggests similar increases in WUE in
response to drought.
Other research supports H2 and our interpretation from
tree ring W:D of a greater response to drought for P.
flexilis and P. menziesii compared with P. ponderosa. For
example, growth of P. menziesii was more responsive to
watering than P. ponderosa in a seedling study (Zhang et
al. 1996). P. flexilis had greater stomatal sensitivity to
vapor pressure deficit than P. ponderosa in a high-
elevation meadow in northern Arizona (Fischer et al.
2002). This finding suggests that drought, which is often
accompanied by high vapor pressure deficit, has a greater
negative effect on stomatal aperture and photosynthesis of
P. flexilis than P. ponderosa. Despite their high elevation
ranges on relatively mesic sites in southwestern USA, our
results and others (Biondi 2000; Hidalgo et al. 2001)
indicate that growth of P. menziesii and P. flexilis is clearly
sensitive to drought.
Our third hypothesis (H3) was that low-elevation
populations of P. ponderosa would be more responsive
to
regional
drought
than
high-elevation
populations
because of less soil water availability at low elevations.
This hypothesis was supported by the tree ring growth
results where low-elevation (2,000 m) populations had
higher W:D than high-elevation (2,600 m) populations
indicating greater growth response to drought at low
elevations. However, low-elevation populations had a
smaller increase of leaf δ13C between non-drought and
drought years than high-elevation populations, suggesting
222

less stomatal closure and a smaller increase in WUE in
response to drought at low elevations. In both drought and
non-drought years, leaf δ13 C of low-elevation populations
was less negative than high-elevation populations, and we
speculate that this pattern resulted from lower stomatal
conductance and higher overall WUE at low elevations.
Lack of variation in leaf δ13C among populations of P.
ponderosa from different elevations in common garden
tests (Zhang and Marshall 1995; Zhang et al. 1997)
suggests that the differences between elevations in our
study were due to differences in environmental factors, not
genetic differences among populations.
In contrast to our results for low- and high-elevation
populations of P. ponderosa in northern Arizona, leaf δ13C
has been reported to increase with elevation in other
studies of forest trees in western USA (Marshall and
Zhang 1993, 1994; Sparks and Ehleringer 1997; Hultine
and Marshall 2000). Such an increase may occur because
of factors that lower the ratio of leaf intercellular to
ambient concentration of CO2, such as higher photosyn-
thetic capacity (Marshall and Zhang 1993; Sparks and
Ehleringer 1997) and greater resistance to CO2 diffusion
into the leaf at high elevations because of a decrease in
stomatal density and increase in leaf mass per area
(Hultine and Marshall 2000). We speculate that the
decrease in leaf δ13C with elevation in our study was
caused by greater water availability at high elevations that
increased stomatal conductance and leaf internal CO2
concentration. Differences in water availability between
low and high elevations, and the influence of water
availability on elevation changes in leaf δ13C, may be
more pronounced in upland forests of southwestern USA
than in more northern forests of western USA (Marshall
and Zhang 1993, 1994; Hultine and Marshall 2000) or
wetter, riparian forests (Sparks and Ehleringer 1997)
where an increase in leaf δ13C with elevation has been
reported.
Our fourth hypothesis (H4) was that species with a large
growth response to drought (high W:D) would have a
large increase in WUE in response to drought because of a
large reduction in stomatal conductance that decreases
water loss and photosynthate available for growth. This
hypothesis was not consistently supported by all compar-
isons. Support for H4 was strongest at the pinyon-juniper/
ponderosa pine ecotone, where P. ponderosa had a greater
response to drought in W:D and WUE than P. edulis. In
contrast, at the ponderosa pine/mixed conifer ecotone, P.
flexilis and P. menziesii had a greater response to drought
in W:D than P. ponderosa, but the increase in WUE in
response to drought was similar for all species. Leaf δ13C
is an index of only one (i.e., WUE) of the many factors
that may influence tree growth response to drought. Our
results suggest that a large increase in WUE in response to
drought is associated with a large negative response of tree
growth to drought on dry sites, such as the pinyon-juniper/
ponderosa pine ecotone, but not on higher elevation,
wetter sites, such as the ponderosa pine/mixed conifer
forest ecotone.
Different effects of drought on growth and WUE of co-
occurring tree species demonstrated in our study suggest
that frequent intense droughts predicted in some climate
change scenarios may shift ranges of tree species in
montane ecotone forests of southwestern USA (e.g., Allen
and Breshears 1998). Specifically, we speculate that
intense drought will have greater negative impacts on
species and populations in our study with high sensitivity
of radial growth to drought than species or populations
with low sensitivity. This speculation is based on the key
role of tree growth in resource competition, and evidence
that radial growth rate of conifers is positively associated
with carbon allocation to resin defenses against bark
beetles that often kill trees during drought (Larsson et al.
1983; Mitchell et al. 1983). Our speculation is supported
by observations of droughts in the 1950s and 1996 in
southwestern USA. For example, several years of drought
in the 1950s changed the dominant tree species at the
pinyon-juniper/ponderosa pine forest ecotone in northern
New Mexico from P. ponderosa to P. edulis and Juniperus
species because of high mortality of P. ponderosa (Allen
and Breshears 1998). This report is consistent with our
finding of higher negative response of growth to drought
in P. ponderosa than P. edulis. Moreover, P. edulis trees
that died after the 1996 drought in northern Arizona had
greater inter-annual variation in tree radial growth than
trees that lived (Ogle et al. 2000); this result implies
greater response of growth to drought for the trees that
died because most inter-annual variation in tree ring
growth in upland forests of the southwestern US is caused
by variation in water availability (Fritts 1976). Conse-
quently, we predict that frequent severe drought will cause
the following changes: (1) decreased growth and domi-
nance of P. ponderosa at the pinyon-juniper/ponderosa
pine ecotone on a wide range of soil types, (2) decreased
growth and dominance of P. menziesii and P. flexilis at the
ponderosa pine/mixed conifer ecotone, and (3) a decline of
low-elevation populations of P. ponderosa. Evaluation of
these predictions is beyond the scope of our study, and
should be addressed in future studies of climate change
and drought on montane forests of southwestern USA.
