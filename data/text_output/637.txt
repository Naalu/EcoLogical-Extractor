Some warm/dry mixed-conifer forests are at increasing risk of uncharacteristically large, high-severity
ﬁres. As a result, managers have begun ecological restoration efforts using treatments such as mechanical
thinning and prescribed ﬁre. Empirical information on the long-term impacts of these treatments is
limited, especially in light of potential climate change. We assessed changes in forest structure and
composition ﬁve-years following three alternative restoration treatments in a warm/dry mixed-conifer
forest: (1) thin/burn, (2) prescribe burn, and (3) control. We used the Climate-Forest Vegetation
Simulator (Climate-FVS) model to quantify potential forest trajectories under alternative climate scenar-
ios. Five years following treatments, changes in forest structure were similar to initial post-treatment
conditions, with thin/burn being the only treatment to shift and maintain forest structure and composi-
tion within historical reference conditions. By 2013, the thin/burn had reduced basal area (11.3 m2 ha1)
and tree density (117.2 tree ha1) by 56% and 79% respectively, compared to pre-treatment values. In the
burn, basal area (20.5 m2 ha1) and tree density (316.6 tree ha1) was reduced by 20% and 35% respec-
tively, from 2002 to 2013. Mortality of large ponderosa pine trees (the most ﬁre-resistant species)
throughout the duration of the experiment, averaged 6% in the burn compared to 16% in the thin/burn
treatment. Changes ﬁve years following treatments were largely due to increases in sprouting species.
Shrub and sapling densities were approximately two to three times higher (respectively) in the thin/burn
compared to burn and control and dominated by sprouting oak and aspen. Under climate simulations, the
thin/burn was more resilient in maintaining forest conditions compared to burn and control which
approached meager forest conditions (3–4 m2 ha1). These results indicate that restoration treatment
that include both thinning and burning can maintain forest integrity over the next few decades.

1. Introduction
Recent regional climatic changes, coupled with uncharacteristi-
cally high and continuous fuel loads, have resulted in widespread
mortality events (e.g., ﬁre and insect outbreaks) and gradual shifts
in plant species distributions in numerous forest types across the
western United States (Covington, 2000; Breshears, 2005; Seager
et
al.,
2007;
Williams
et
al.,
2012;
Brusca
et
al.,
2013).
Management in dry coniferous forests has primarily focused on
tree thinning, followed by prescribed ﬁre, for reducing wildﬁre
severity, restoring forest structure and increasing resiliency across
landscapes (Fulé et al., 2012; Martinson and Omi, 2013; Waltz
et al., 2014). However, there is limited information on the longev-
ity of these treatments, speciﬁcally with respect to their effective-
ness in maintaining ecosystem integrity and increasing resilience
to disturbances under future climate conditions. In this study, we
examine alternative restoration treatments ﬁve years following
treatment and use climate-sensitive simulation modeling to pro-
vide insights on whether these treatments maintain ecosystem
integrity over the next few decades.
In the western U.S., mixed-conifer forests are generally divided
into two subtypes based on species composition and historical ﬁre
regime: (1) warm/dry, characterized as a frequent-ﬁre regime
where ponderosa pine is frequently the dominant conifer and (2)
cool/moist, typically an infrequent-ﬁre regime where ponderosa

pine is generally absent (Romme et al., 2009). Fire exclusion, inten-
sive livestock grazing and selective tree harvesting of the early
20th
century
created
conditions
ideal
for
the
ingrowth
of
shade-tolerant tree species across both warm/dry and cool/moist
forests (Fulé et al., 2009; Evans et al., 2011; Korb et al., 2013).
Restoration treatments that include thinning and/or reintroducing
low-intensity surface ﬁre have been demonstrated to restore eco-
logical integrity and increase resilience to disturbances, such as
severe crown ﬁres, insect outbreaks and drought in dry coniferous
forests (Kolb et al., 1998; Fulé et al., 2009; Stephens et al., 2013).
Thinning dense young trees and conserving old trees to within a
historical range of natural variability (NRV) are often targeted
objectives for restoring ecological structure and promoting forest
resiliency in ﬁre-adapted ecosystems (Covington and Moore,
1994; Allen et al., 2002; Waltz et al., 2014). Restoration treatments
and unmanaged forest conditions that resemble historical condi-
tions have been repeatedly linked with reductions in ﬁre severity
(Pollet and Omi, 2002; Cochrane et al., 2012; Fulé et al., 2012).
However, the relevance of historical conditions to promote
resilient ecosystems has been questioned, given the uncertainty
of global climate change, novel ecosystem assemblages and
uncharacteristic ﬁre regimes.
Long-term management plans often lack consideration of
climate change, a key factor driving disturbance regimes and
change in vegetation distributions (Harrison and Prentice, 2003;
Staver et al., 2011). In the southwest, temperatures have steadily
increased in recent decades and warming is predicted to continue
over the next century, intensifying regional drying (MacDonald,
2010; Seager and Vecchi, 2010; Hurteau et al., 2014). High forest
densities, coupled with predicted climate changes, are likely to
have increasingly detrimental effects on tree mortality, tree
growth and conifer species regeneration across numerous forest
types (Allen et al., 2010; Kerhoulas et al., 2013). While considerable
uncertainty remains regarding the magnitude of climate change,
model simulations that can account for the anticipated effects of
climate change are useful for assessing future trajectories of forest
communities and provide invaluable guidance for evaluating man-
agement scenarios.
We asked the following questions about observed and predicted
forest change in a warm/dry mixed-conifer forest:
1. How do forest characteristics, such as tree and shrub density,
mortality, growth rates, and regeneration, compare across alter-
native restoration treatments ﬁve years following treatment?
2. How might forest characteristics following restoration treat-
ments change under differing future climate scenarios?
2. Methods
2.1. Study area
We conducted the experiment in the San Juan Mountains, in
southwest
Colorado
(N37.296,
W107.228)
on
the
San
Juan
National Forest. Our sites ranged in elevation from 2438 to
2743 m. The most common soil type is Dutton loam, a silty clay
loam (USDA Forest Service, 2004). Average annual climate (1906–
1998) for the area is: precipitation 55.01 cm, snowfall 295.66 cm;
5.56 C (July maximum temperature 28.17 C). Over the study per-
iod (2009–2013), annual precipitation averaged 38.52 cm, 70% of
the long-term average (WRCC 2014F). Forest composition included
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), white ﬁr (Abies concolor),
Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii) quaking aspen (Populus tremu-
loides), and Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii). The understory
was dominated by a variety of shrubs including Gambel oak
(Quercus
gambelii),
snowberry
(Symphoricarpus
rotundifolius),
Woods rose (Rosa woodsii), and serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia).
2.2. Experimental design and ﬁeld measurements
We established four replicated experimental blocks of three
randomly assigned treatment units, each approximately 16 ha in
size. Treatment units were randomly assigned one of three possible
treatments: (1) thinning followed by prescribed ﬁre (thin/burn) (2)
prescribed ﬁre only (burn) and (3) no treatment (control). Twenty
400 m2 (11.28 m radius) permanent sample plots were established
on a 60-m grid in each of the 12 treatment units (240 total plots).
We
collected
data
in
2002
(pretreatment)
2009
(1-year
post-treatment) and 2013 (5 years post-treatment). Overstory
trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) >2.54 cm were mea-
sured on each plot including species, condition (living or snag/log
classes Thomas et al., 1979), and diameter at breast height (dbh).
We tallied tree regeneration for seedlings (<40 cm in height and
62.5 cm DBH), saplings (>40.1 cm in height and 62.5 cm DBH)
and individual shrub stems by species and condition on a nested
100 m2 (5.64 m radius) subplot.
Thinning prescriptions were based on a site-speciﬁc reconstruc-
tion of historical forest structure prior to ﬁre exclusion circa 1871
(Fulé et al., 2009). In addition to retaining all live trees established
before 1871, an average of two post-settlement trees were retained
for each dead presettlement remnant (e.g., snags, logs, stumps)
(see Korb et al. (2012) for a detailed description of the thinning
prescription). Retained trees were of the same species and within
20 m of dead remnants where possible. Wood was not removed
due to restrictions on road access, so logs and limbs were lopped
and scattered. Old-growth trees were not raked to remove fuels
around tree boles. Thinning was done in 2004 and prescribed burns
were implemented in
either
fall 2007
or
fall 2008. Initial
post-treatment
measurements
were completed
in
2009
and
described in Korb et al. (2012).
2.3. Statistical analysis
We analyzed post-treatment (2013) effects on forest character-
istics, regeneration and shrub densities for each treatment unit
(n = 4) using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Seedling con-
ifer and aspen densities were transformed (natural logarithm) in
order to meet assumptions of ANOVA. When signiﬁcant treatment
effects were found, Tukey’s honestly signiﬁcant difference (HSD)
post hoc multiple comparisons test was used to test for differences
among treatment groups. Initial pre- and post-treatment forest
structures were compared previously by Korb et al. (2012). We also
used post treatment (2009) data as a covariate (ANCOVA) to
account for differences in forest characteristics among treatments,
and test whether differences among treatments had changed over
time. All tests were conducted at alpha = 0.05 using SAS JMP (ver.
11) software (SAS Inc., 2004).
2.4. Simulating future conditions under differing climate scenarios
All simulations of future conditions were conducted using the
Central Rockies Variant of the Climate-Forest Vegetation Simulator
(Climate-FVS; Crookston, 2013). Climate-FVS is an extension to the
base FVS model, which is a deterministic, individual-tree growth
model (Dixon, 2013). FVS is a semi-distant-independent growth
model, meaning that tree growth and mortality rates are adjusted
based on density (i.e., competition) within the stand. Climate-FVS
uses changes in ‘‘species viability scores’’ (Crookston et al., 2010)
to modify species-speciﬁc tree-growth rates, site-index, and mortal-
ity rates of the base FVS model as a function of climate scenario
selection.
To address the uncertainty associated with future greenhouse
gas emissions and thus climate scenario selection, we used the
three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios

(IPCC, 2013) currently available in the Central Rockies Variant of
the Climate-Forest Vegetation Simulator (Climate-FVS; Crookston,
2013). The IPCC’s (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)
four RCP scenarios represent a range of conditions in which the
total radiative forcing increases by 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, or 8.5 Watts per
square meter (W/m2) by the year 2100 (Van Vuuren et al., 2011).
Three of the four RCP scenarios are included in the current version
of Climate-FVS: (1) RCP 4.5 which assumes 524 ppm CO2 by 2070
and stabilization at 650 ppm CO2 by 2100; (2) RCP 6.0 which
assumes 550 ppm CO2 by 2070 and stabilization at 850 ppm
CO2 by 2100; and (3) RCP 8.5 which assumes 766 ppm CO2 by
2070, 1370 ppm CO2 by 2100 and no indication of stabilization.
These models estimate a 2–5-fold increase of the pre-industrial
concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere (280 ppm) and project
average global temperature increases of 0.8 C to 2.6 C by 2070
or 1.1 C to 4.8 C by the end of the 21st century (Van Vuuren
et al., 2011).
The three available RCP scenarios and an additional ‘‘No
Climate’’ scenario (assuming current climate is constant) were pro-
jected from 2013 to 2063 (50 years). This simulation period was
selected to minimize over predictions in growth (Petrova et al.,
2014) and to correspond with typical forest planning horizons.
Regeneration events (rates and species) in the No Climate scenario
were based on observed 5-year post treatment data. When forest
conditions fell below 30% of full stocking (measured as a propor-
tion of maximum stand density) the following regeneration was
simulated:
ponderosa
pine:
92 trees ha1;
Douglas-ﬁr:
23 trees ha1;
white
ﬁr:
41 trees ha1;
and
quaking
aspen:
178 trees ha1.
For the RCP scenarios, regeneration was also simulated when
stocking thresholds fell below 30% for each species (four maximum
from a possible 37) and their proportion of total regeneration for
all species combined (333.8 tree ha1) were a function of the
species-speciﬁc viability scores. We scaled viability scores between
zero (all scores less than 0.4) and one (scores greater than 0.8). If
the viability score is less than 0.4 no trees are established, whereas
if the viability score is greater than 0.8 all allowable trees (the
maximum proportion of the total for that species) are established.
To compute the species speciﬁc proportion of total trees simulated
to be establish, the allowable proportion is multiplied by the scaled
viability score of the species with the highest score. Species with a
scaled viability scores less than 0.4 are ignored and a maximum of
four species are selected from the remaining composition by
decreasing viability score. As a result, most of the trees to be
established are those suggested by Climate-FVS as best suited for
the projected climate of the site.
3. Results
3.1. Post-treatment forest characteristics after restoration treatments
Five years after treatment implementation, mean basal area and
tree density were signiﬁcantly lower in the thin/burn treatment
(P < 0.0001, both variables) compared to burn and control and burn
was signiﬁcantly lower than control (Table 1). In 2013, total basal
area and density differences among treatments were driven by
white ﬁr and Douglas-ﬁr basal area and density (P < 0.0001 for
all variables). Mean basal area declined over the 2009–2013 time
period in all three treatments, decreasing 0.3 m2 ha1, 1.4
m2 ha1 and 2.0 m2 ha1, respectively in the control, burn and
thin/burn treatments. Changes in tree density varied among treat-
ments, increasing in both the control (11.9 tree ha1) and the
thin/burn (10.9 tree ha1) and decreasing in the burn (28.8 tree
ha1). Initial 1-year post-treatment forest structure measurements
explained all signiﬁcant 5-year post treatment differences in basal
area and tree density (P = 0.01 and P < 0.0001, respectively), indi-
cating no signiﬁcant changes occurred in basal area or tree density
in the four years following treatment.
There were no differences (P = 0.2) in overstory tree morality
among treatments from 2009 to 2013. Overstory trees that died
occurred largely in the burn treatment averaging 13.3 tree ha1,
followed by control (8.8 trees ha1) and thin/burn (5.7 tree ha1).
Tree mortality across both control and burn treatments occurred
primarily in the small size classes (<20 cm DBH), whereas mortal-
ity in thin/burn units occurred in the 20–40 cm range (Fig. 1). Tree
mortality was dominated by ﬁre-intolerant and shade-tolerant
species such as white ﬁr. Mean large tree mortality (deﬁned as
>40 cm DBH) that died over the 2009–2013 time period was
5.6 trees ha1, 3.8 trees ha1 and 2.2 trees ha1, in thin/burn, burn
and control treatments, respectively.
Total sapling densities were approximately three times higher
in
the
thin/burn
treatment
compared
to
control
and
burn
(Table 2), albeit not statistically signiﬁcant (P = 0.07). Sapling den-
sities were composed mainly of sprouting aspen, largely disrupted
in patches (found on 51% of the total plots). Aspen densities
increased by 168% and 38%, respectively in the thin/burn and burn
treatments since 2009, but in the control treatment aspen sapling
decreased by 22%. Conifer saplings were signiﬁcantly higher in the

control
and
burn
treatments
compared
to
the
thin/burn
(P = 0.0006). Initial one-year post-treatment (2009) conifer sapling
explained all of the signiﬁcant differences (P = 0.004) indicating no
signiﬁcant changes had occurred in the subsequent four year fol-
lowing treatment.
Seedling densities were signiﬁcantly higher (P = 0.04) in the
control treatment compared to thin/burn, with no differences
between control and burn (Table 2). Differences in total densities
among treatments were driven by differences in conifer seedlings
(P = 0.03), with control and burn treatments having approximately
eight times higher conifer seedlings than the thin/burn. Signiﬁcant
changes between 2009 and 2013 explained all the differences
(P = 0.004) among treatments. Pine seedling density increased by
an order of magnitude within the burn and control treatments
and two orders in the thin/burn treatment over the ﬁve year
period. The observed increases in seedling density were largely
reﬂected in an inﬂux of recently established (2013) seedlings.
Total shrub densities were signiﬁcantly higher (P = 0.01) in the
thin/burn treatment compared to control and burn (Table 2). Shrub
densities in thin/burn treatment were on average, 69% and 64%
greater than the control and burn, respectively. Total shrub differ-
ences among treatments were driven by both Gambel oak sprouts
(P = 0.03) and Woods rose (P = 0.009) (Table 2). Gambel oak stems
comprised nearly 40% of the mean total shrub density in the
thin/burn treatment and was found on 98% of the thin/burn plots
compared to 24% and 84% in the control and burn plots, respec-
tively. Initial one-year post-treatment (2009) shrub densities
explained all of the signiﬁcant differences (P = 0.02) indicating no
signiﬁcant changes had occurred in the subsequent four year fol-
lowing treatment. Although oak densities had increased by 576%
between 2009 and 2013 in the thin/burn treatment compared to
327% in the control and 292% in the burn, the changes between
treatments were statistically insigniﬁcant (P = 0.06). Increases in
Arizona rose densities over the four year period differed signiﬁ-
cantly (P = 0.005) from initial (2009) post-treatment conditions,
with signiﬁcant differences (P = 0.001) among all treatments
(Table 2).
3.2. Alternative climate change scenarios and future forest
characteristics
Modeling simulations suggested that the thin/burn treatment
was
the
most
resilient
to
climate
change,
with
average
mid-century (2063) simulated basal area decreasing less (45%)
than other treatments (82% in the burn and 88% in the control)
when compared to initial conditions in 2013 (Fig. 2). In addition,
the thin/burn treatment exhibited the highest (i.e., closest to
NRV) basal area (4.6–7.4 m2 ha1) at the end of the simulation per-
iod. When comparing differences within treatments and among
climate scenarios, a consistent pattern emerged in that RCP 8.5
exhibited the lowest basal area at the end of the simulation period.

Please cite this article in press as: Stoddard, M.T., et al. Five-year post-restoration conditions and simulated climate-change trajectories in a warm/dry
mixed-conifer forest, southwestern Colorado, USA. Forest Ecol. Manage. (2015), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2015.07.007

Basal area in all treatment types remained higher for RCP 6.0 until
approximately 2053, when the basal area in RCP 4.5 began to
climb, eventually yielding the highest basal area values in 2063
for both the burn and control scenarios (Fig. 2b and c). This is
largely a result of the CO2 emission assumptions used when devel-
oping RCP 4.5 and 6.0; namely RCP 6.0 assumes CO2 emissions
peak in 2060 at 75% above today’s levels, and then decline to
25% above today’s levels by 2100 while RCP 4.5 assumes CO2
emissions increase only slightly before declining around 2040.
This difference in the temporal change point where CO2 emissions
begin to decline (corresponding with the simulation time period)
resulted in RCP 6.0 being the simulation with the lowest reactive
forcing for this study.
Most of the changes in forest structure and composition were a
result of how Climate-FVS alters tree mortality, growth rates, site
suitability, and species composition according to selected climate
scenario. Fig. 3 shows changes in both structure (basal area) and
tree species composition. For example, when considering the
climate scenario with the most conservative simulated effect (least
radiative forcing consistent with the application of a range of tech-
nologies and strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions), the
RCP 6.0 has the highest basal area for 40 years of the 50-year sim-
ulation period. With respect to species composition (Fig. 3a–c), all
sites
became
consistently
less
suitable
for
ponderosa
pine,
Douglas-ﬁr, and white ﬁr and more suitable for aspen and
Gambel oak. One notable exception was observed: model simula-
tions suggested that ponderosa pine in the thin/burn treatment
may be retained at higher proportions of total stand basal area
(16.7%) than in the control and burn (9.1% and 2.3%, respectively).
4. Discussion
4.1. Forest structure and mortality
The thin/burn treatment was the only treatment that shifted
and maintained forest structure and composition within reference
conditions (9.9–13.3 m2 ha1 and 127.1–146.7 tree ha1, Fulé et al.,
2009). In contrast, ﬁve years after treatment implementation basal
area and tree density in the burn treatment were 1.5 and 2.2 times
higher, respectively, than reference conditions. Forest composition
following the thin/burn treatment was primarily ponderosa pine
and aspen species whereas composition in the burn treatment
was still mainly comprised of ﬁre-intolerant species such as white
ﬁr. A photo time series visually illustrates the reduction of tree
density, basal area and compositional differences following the
alternative treatments (Fig. 4). These results are consistent with
other restoration studies in western dry mixed-conifer ecosystems
(Youngblood et al., 2006; North et al., 2007; Fulé et al., 2012). By
reducing live and dead fuel loading and raising crown base heights,
a combined thinning and burning treatment has also been shown
to be consistently effective at mitigating uncharacteristic ﬁre
behavior (Martinson and Omi, 2013).
Tree mortality in thin/burn and burn treatments between 2009
and 2013 was presumably due to delayed treatment effects such as
cambial girdling and/or ﬁne root death from ﬁre, compounded by
long-term drought. Over the study period, precipitation was 70%
of the long-term average. The majority of tree mortality was
observed in smaller trees and less ﬁre-tolerant species, such as
white ﬁr, Douglas-ﬁr, and aspen (51%). Increased aspen mortality
in the southern Rockies is a concern where lack of high-severity
ﬁre is thought to be contributing to a long-term decline (Bartos
and Campbell, 1998), and recent episodes of landscape-scale mor-
tality appear to be closely related to extreme drought conditions
(Rehfeldt et al., 2009; Worrall et al., 2013). At our study site, mean
basal area decline in aspen was 37% from 2002 to 2012. Mortality
of aspen >20 cm during this period averaged 6.6, 4.1, 8.1 trees ha1,
respectively in thin/burn, burn and control treatments. The per-
centage of large aspen mortality was similar to the total aspen
mortality among treatments, ranging from 52% to 54%.
Large, old trees are often a conservation priority for restoration
projects, because they provided numerous ecosystem services, take
centuries to regrow and are instrumental to forest ecosystem resi-
lience (Franklin et al., 2008; Abella et al., 2007). Prescribed ﬁre
around large trees has been shown to lead to cambial girdling
due to decades of fuel accumulation (Sackett et al., 1996).
Throughout the duration of the experiment (2002–2014), a total
of 16% of the large ponderosa pine trees died in the thin/burn treat-
ment compared to 6% in the burn treatment. Roccaforte et al.
(2015) reported 25% presettlement pine mortality in thin/burn
treatments and 31% mortality in burn-only treatments, whereas
Fulé and Laughlin (2007) reported twice the mortality we found
following similar restoration treatment on the south rim of the
Grand Canyon. Both studies were conducted at drier ponderosa
pine sites where fuel loads had been removed from the base of
large trees. In our study, forest ﬂoor fuels were not raked away
from the base of larger ponderosa pine trees, yet mortality
remained low. Given these mortality rates, large ponderosa pine
trees remained within the reference conditions of a site-speciﬁc
diameter distribution (Fulé et al., 2009).
Changes in regeneration ﬁve years after restoration treatments
were largely due to increases in sprouting species. Total aspen
regeneration densities (sum of seedlings and saplings) increased
by 119% and 31% in the thin/burn and burn treatments, respec-
tively,
and
decreases
were
observed
in
the
control
units.
Although differences in total aspen regeneration were not signiﬁ-
cant among treatments, there were three times more aspen stems
in the thin/burn treatment (averaging 3024 stems ha1) as

compared to burn and control treatments. This response suggested
a persistent aspen community where mortality is counterbalanced
by recruitment. We surmise that overstory disturbance associated
with restoration treatments stimulated aspen regeneration despite
droughty conditions.
Gambel oak also proliferated in the understory of the thin/burn
treatment, and appeared to be the main driver of differences
among treatments in total shrub densities (Fig. 4). Although differ-
ences in oak densities among treatments were mainly seen in the
ﬁrst year post-treatment, oak densities continued to increase ﬁve
years following treatments. In 2013, oak densities were ﬁve, three,
and three times greater, respectively in the thin/burn, burn and
control treatments compared to initial post-treatment densities.
The proliﬁc response of Gambel oak following thinning and burn-
ing is well documented in southwestern Colorado (Brown, 1958;
Harrington, 1985). A few studies in frequent-ﬁre ecosystems sug-
gest a high severity ﬁre-catalyst is needed for resprouting species
to respond vigorously (Shive et al., 2013; Cocking et al., 2014).
Our thin/burn treatment was intended to be low severity, but in
many areas moderate to high ﬁre severity was observed and
resulted in a high density of oak sprouts. The burn treatment,
which was low intensity and patchy, exhibited minimal increases
in oak sprouts.
Proliﬁc shrub resprouting after disturbance often leads to con-
cerns over tree regeneration failure and potential for forest type
conversion (Savage and Mast, 2005; Haire and McGarigal, 2010).
One year following the thin/burn treatment, there was a vigorous
shrub response and no conifer regeneration. By the ﬁfth growing
season after treatment, ponderosa pine densities in thin/burn
treatment were 12.5 seedlings and 5.0 sapling ha1. Mast et al.
(1999) and Bailey and Covington (2002) suggest that pine estab-
lishment rates between 0.4–3.6 and 3.6–17 trees ha1 decade1
were sufﬁcient to maintain ponderosa pine ecosystems within
NRV of which our observed rates of pine regeneration fell within.
4.2. Alternative climate change scenarios and future forest
characteristics
All climate simulations, regardless of treatment, led to large
decreases in forest densities by the mid-century. However, simu-
lated changes for the thin/burn were less and future BA and TPH
were closer to NRV (9.9–13.3 m2 ha1, 127.1–146.7 tree ha1,
Fulé et al., 2009) in the thin/burn compared to burn and control
treatments. Limitations associated with the use of climate change
scenarios when modeling future forest structures are outlined in
detail by Shive et al. (2014). The purpose of our simulations was
not to exactly predict future forest conditions but rather to com-
pare
differences
among
restoration
treatments
in
terms
of
long-term resilience to possible climate scenarios. The effects of
increasing climate change on forest structure found in our analysis
were consistent with those reported by Fulé et al. (2004),
Crookston et al. (2010), Azpeleta Tarancón et al. (2014), Bagdon
and Huang (2014) and Shive et al. (2014). However, in several of
these studies forest treatments that were within NRV conditions
did have persisting effects over the next several of decades.
NRV represent a range of historical variability and evolutionary
adaptations over thousands of years, and are often used as a
management guide for developing ecological restoration and fuel
reduction prescriptions (Allen et al., 2002; Shive et al., 2014) as a
desired condition to ensure ecosystem resiliency (sensu Holling,
1973). Thus, it also seems appropriate to compare forest structure
projected under differing climate scenarios to NRV. For example,
no treatment-climate scenario in our study resulted in BA
values between the 25th and 75th percentiles of NRV for
southwestern-mixed conifer forests (9–15 m2 ha1; as summa-
rized by Stoddard (2011). Simulations for burn and control
treatments had basal areas well below NRV, and approached sparse
conditions (3–7 m2 ha1). Only in the thin/burn scenarios (regard-
less of climate scenario) were values close to NRV (RCP 4.5 and 6.0:
7.0 m2 ha1, RCP 8.5: 4.5 m2 ha1). Similar to the ﬁndings reported
by Azpeleta Tarancón et al. (2014), our results suggest that forest
conditions may undergo changes in species composition under
future climate change, becoming dominated by shrubs and sprout-
ing species (aspen and oak), with much lower tree densities and
increased mortality. Particularly noteworthy was the detail that
only the thin/burn treatment scenario resulted in ponderosa pine
persisting as a major component of density.
Other studies utilizing Climate-FVS to examine future scenarios
indicate that climate is expected to alter species viabilities, mortal-
ity may increase, and a gradual shift in species composition and
vegetation types is expected across landscapes (Crookston et al.,
2010; McDowell, 2011). Azpeleta Tarancón et al. (2014) used
Climate-FVS to examine post-wildﬁre forest trajectories under
alternative
climate
and
management
scenarios
in
northern
Arizona and concluded that severe climate change may lead to
non-forest conditions as early as the year 2100. Similar to our
ﬁndings Azpeleta Tarancón et al. (2014) suggest that treatments
targeting lower tree densities in dry forests are well suited to
mitigate forest conditions contributing to uncharacteristic distur-
bances and potential loss in forest cover under future climate
scenarios.
Four additional studies (Buma and Wessman (2013) in southern
Colorado; Bagdon and Huang (2014) and Shive et al. (2014) in
northern Arizona, and Hurteau et al. (2014) in the Tahoe Basin of
California) concluded that future climate is expected to exert a
strong inﬂuence on vegetation. Generally, the four studies’ man-
agement scenarios (including no-action) impacted the effects of
climate change little and in all studies forest landscapes transi-
tioned to non-forest or extremely open forest condition by the
end of the 21st century. However, Hurteau et al. (2014) reported
that projections of carbon stocks varied signiﬁcantly as a function
of thinning treatment intensity for differing GCM and emission
scenarios.
5. Conclusions
Considering global trends of increased numbers of large,
high-severity ﬁres, and the documented increases in tree densities
that have occurred in warm/dry mixed-conifer forests as a result of
decades of ﬁre exclusion, there is an urgent need for large-scale
implementation of ecological restoration treatments in these
ecosystems (Williams et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2014). Compounding
the urgency of these needs is the prospect of increased drought,
warmer temperatures, and more extreme weather events possibly
resulting in an increased probability of landscape-scale forest
dieback. Results from previous studies suggest restoration treat-
ments can increase forest resiliency, improve drought tolerance,
and improve ecosystem function. Our results, coupled with
climate-sensitive simulations of future forest conditions further
justify the use of restoration treatments for enhancing ecosystem
resilience.
Furthermore, our results suggest mixed-conifer restoration pre-
scriptions should include both thinning and burning (as opposed to
only burning) to increase ecosystem resiliency and hedge against
forest cover loss associated with climate change. Uncertainties of
how management actions and climate change interact and require
managers to adopt adaptive approaches. Long-term monitoring
studies should provide rigorous information to help managers
maintain forest integrity, conserve resource values and allow man-
agers to make informed decisions regarding the appropriateness
for
treatments
targeting
forest
restoration
and
ecosystem
resiliency.
