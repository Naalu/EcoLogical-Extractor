Abstract
We examined changes in small mammal habitat and densities of four small mammal species, including deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus),
gray-collared chipmunks (Tamias cinereicollis), golden-mantled ground squirrels (Spermophilus lateralis), and Mexican woodrats (Neotoma
mexicana), 2–3 years after thinning and prescribed ﬁre treatments in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of northern Arizona, US. These
treatments were designed to simultaneously reduce high-severity ﬁre risk while returning forests to conditions more representative of pre-European
settlement structure and function. Treatments resulted in changes in important components of small mammal habitat, including increased
herbaceous vegetation, decreased shrub density, and decreased woody debris. Deer mouse densities were negatively related to tree densities. Gray-
collared chipmunks were negatively affected by treatment, negatively related to tree density, and positively related to woody debris. Golden-
mantled ground squirrels did not appear to vary strongly with either treatment or treatment-related habitat changes, but appeared to be somewhat
positively related to shrub cover. Mexican woodrats were positively related to shrub cover, and were positively, but weakly, related to woody debris.
Overall, forest thinning can be expected to increase densities of small mammals in these forests, and retention of slash in fuel reduction/restoration
treatments may further increase small mammal densities in the post-treatment community. However, reduction of shrubs and woody debris with
overly frequent prescribed ﬁre entries may reduce small mammal densities.

1. Introduction
Changes in the structure and function of ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa) forests of the southwestern United States
(US) have been documented and discussed extensively, with
concerns over these changes increasing during the last decade
(Covington and Moore, 1994; Fule´ et al., 1997; Allen et al.,
2002). Historical data indicate that in the period before Euro-
American settlement, ponderosa pine forests in the region
experienced relatively frequent, low-intensity ground ﬁres
(Moore et al., 1999). This disturbance pattern resulted in open
stands of ponderosa pine with rich herbaceous understories.
Changes in land use and management since Euro-American
settlement in the mid-nineteenth century, including extensive
ﬁre suppression, grazing, and logging, are believed to have
resulted in loss of the open structure of forests, declines in
understory vegetation, and increased risk of high-severity
wildﬁre (Savage and Swetnam, 1990; Covington and Moore,
1994; Arno et al., 1995).
Researchers and managers have developed fuel reduction
treatments, frequently consisting of mechanical removal
(thinning) of smaller trees followed by prescribed burning,
to reduce the risk of high-severity wildﬁre (Covington et al.,
1997; Lynch et al., 2000; Fule´ et al., 2001), and these treatments
appear to be effective (Fule´ et al., 2001; Pollet and Omi, 2002;
Martinson and Omi, 2002). In some cases, fuel reduction
treatments are billed as forest restoration techniques designed
to replicate what is known about pre-Euro-American settlement
(hereafter, pre-Euro-settlement) forest conditions (Covington
et al., 1997; Moore et al., 1999; Lynch et al., 2000). Implicit in
the use of forest restoration as an ecological management
approach is the assumption that restoration of historic forest
conditions will provide for current forest ecological values
(e.g., wildlife diversity). Assessing this assumption is critical

to an evaluation of restoration as a method for maintaining
forest ecological values, especially in light of changing climatic
conditions and introduction of exotic species since Euro-
settlement (Wagner et al., 2000).
Small mammals are an important suite of species to consider
where maintenance of ecological values is a forest management
goal. Small mammals impact forest vegetation structure
through consumption and dispersal of seeds and hypogeous
fungi (Gashwiler, 1970; Maser et al., 1978; Price and Jenkins,
1986). Furthermore, small mammal populations are food
sources for various predator species in southwestern forests
(e.g., Mexican spotted owls, Strix occidentalis lucida, and
northern goshawks, Accipiter gentilis; Reynolds et al., 1996;
Ward, 2001; Block et al., 2005).
Ground-dwelling small mammal communities in northern
Arizona ponderosa pine forests include four relatively common
species: deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), gray-collared
chipmunks (Tamias cinereicollis), golden-mantled ground
squirrels (Spermophilus lateralis), and Mexican woodrats
(Neotoma mexicana). Deer mice are small (12–20 g) omnivor-
ous, nocturnal, murid rodents common throughout North
America and found frequently in early successional habitats
(Fitzgerald et al., 1994). Gray-collared chipmunks, native to
Arizona and New Mexico, are medium-sized (20–70 g) diurnal,
omnivorous, sciurid rodents that inhabit open woodlands
(Hilton and Best, 1993). Golden-mantled ground squirrels are
large (120–300 g), omnivorous, diurnal, sciurids native to the
western US and southwestern Canada; they inhabit meadows,
shrublands, open woodlands, and disturbed forest (Goodwin
and Hungerford, 1979; Bartels and Thompson, 1993; Fitzgerald
et
al.,
1994).
Mexican
woodrats
are
large
(70–200 g)
omnivorous, nocturnal, murid rodents inhabiting woodlands
of the southwestern US through Central America (Fitzgerald
et al., 1994).
Three broad categories of habitat components have been
consistently found to be important determinants of population
abundance of these four and closely related ground-dwelling
forest small mammal species, although the relationship
between abundance and the various habitat components is
not always consistent across studies. Important biotic habitat
components include herbaceous vegetation (Goodwin and
Hungerford, 1979; Bartels and Thompson, 1993; Kyle and
Block, 2000; Wilson and Carey, 2000; Manning and Edge,
2004; Block et al., 2005), shrubs (including small understory
trees; Carey and Johnson, 1995; Sureda and Morrison, 1999;
Ward, 2001; Block et al., 2005), and forest ﬂoor woody debris
(Graves et al., 1988; Bartels and Thompson, 1993; Hilton and
Best, 1993; Carey and Johnson, 1995; Ward, 2001; Carey and
Harrington, 2001).
Changes in these habitat components after fuel reduction
treatments should greatly inﬂuence changes in small mammal
populations (e.g., Bock and Bock, 1983; Wilson and Carey,
2000; Carey, 2001; Suzuki and Hayes, 2003), and expected
responses of herbaceous cover, shrubs, and woody debris to
various thinning/prescribed ﬁre treatments can be predicted.
High herbaceous cover is related to lower tree density in
southwestern ponderosa pine forests (Moore and Deiter,
1992), presumably due to increased light, water, and nutrient
availability under sparser tree canopies, and while burning
may reduce herbaceous cover in the immediate aftermath of
ﬁre, there is evidence that herbaceous vegetation quickly
recovers to greater than pre-ﬁre levels after prescribed burns
(Bock and Bock, 1983; Harris and Covington, 1983; Oswald
and Covington, 1984). Thus, increases in herbaceous cover
with thinning and prescribed burning treatments are expected.
Shrub cover also is related to lower tree density and thinning
activities (Sullivan et al., 2000; Carey and Wilson, 2001;
Suzuki and Hayes, 2003), but is reduced after ﬁre (Bock and
Bock, 1983; Arno et al., 1995) and likely recovers more
slowly than herbaceous vegetation. Thus, prescribed burning
should cause short-term declines in shrub cover. Woody
debris will also be inﬂuenced by treatments—post-thinning
slash should increase the amount of available woody debris
immediately after thinning to a variable degree, depending on
whether slash is removed, piled, or scattered. However,
prescribed ﬁre is expected to result in immediate reductions in
woody debris (Covington and Sackett, 1984; Arno et al.,
1995).
While changes in habitat after treatments should inﬂuence
small mammal populations, it is unclear how treatment-related
changes in habitat components will inﬂuence small mammal
populations, or whether changes in habitat components alone
can allow prediction of changes in small mammal populations.
Understanding how and whether habitat changes can be used to
predict changes in small mammal populations is critical to
management of small mammal populations in areas subject to
fuel reduction/restoration treatments. To address this informa-
tion need, we examined small mammal habitat and population
responses to fuel reduction/restoration treatments of varying
intensity in southwestern ponderosa pine forests. Varying-
intensity treatments provided us a greater range of changes in
habitat conditions to study. Our objectives were: (1) to examine
the effects of treatments, and treatment intensity, on critical
components
of
small mammal habitat
2–3 years after
treatments were completed; (2) to determine how habitat
changes inﬂuenced populations of deer mice, gray-collared
chipmunks, golden-mantled ground squirrels, and Mexican
woodrats, and whether changes in habitat components alone
were adequate to explain changes in these populations.
2. Methods
2.1. Study area
The Fort Valley Study Area (FVSA) was located on and
proximal to the Fort Valley Experimental Forest, Coconino
National Forest, approximately 15 km northwest of Flagstaff,
Arizona,US.TheFVSAwaslocatedat2300 melevationwithﬂat
to gently rolling topography. A small drainagewas located in one
part of the study area, with steep stream banks and associated
rocky outcrops. Ponderosa pine dominated the canopy in the
FVSA, with only an occasional southwestern white pine (Pinus
strobiformis) or tree-sized Gambel’s oak (Quercus gambelii).
Understory shrubs, besides small ponderosa pine, were sparse,
S.J. Converse et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 228 (2006) 263–273
264

but the most common species were Wood’s rose (Rosa woodsii)
and Gambel’s oak.
Three replicate blocks (Blocks 1, 2, and 3) comprised the
FVSA, and each block in turn consisted of four experimental
units, each 14.2 ha in size (Fig. 1). An experimental unit in
each block was assigned randomly to a control and to each of
three treatments (described below). Experimental units within
each block were <1.5 km from each other, and in most cases
were contiguous. Fule´ et al. (2001) provide further description
of the study area.
2.2. Treatments
Fuel reduction/restoration treatments were described by
Fule´ et al. (2001). During thinning, all trees were removed on
treated experimental units with the following exceptions. First,
all
pre-Euro-settlement
trees
were
retained;
trees
were
presumed to be of pre-Euro-settlement origin if they were
large and had yellowed bark (White, 1985). Second, around
each pre-Euro-settlement remnant (i.e., snags, logs, and stumps
of pre-Euro-settlement origin), a 9.1-m radius area was
searched (or, if that area did not provide the requisite trees,
an 18.3-m radius area was searched). In that area, post-Euro-
settlement trees were retained as follows: for the 1.5–3
treatment, 1.5 trees (i.e., 3 trees for every 2 pre-Euro-settlement
remnants) 40.6 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) or 3 trees
<40.6 cm dbh were retained; in the 2–4 treatment, 2
trees  40.6 cm dbh or 4 trees <40.6 cm dbh were retained;
and in the 3–6 treatment, 3 trees  40.6 cm dbh or 6 trees
<40.6 cm dbh were retained. Smaller trees (<40.6 cm) were
retained only if larger trees (40.6 cm) were not available.
Therefore, the 1.5–3 treatment represented nominally the
largest reduction in post-Euro-settlement trees, followed by the
2–4 treatments, and then the 3–6 treatments.
Thinning was conducted during 1999, but all treated
experimental units were not completed simultaneously. By
the time of small mammal trapping in 1999 (late summer), all
thinning was complete except for at the 3–6 experimental units
and half of the 1.5–3 experimental at Block 2. Thinning on
these units was completed in the fall of 1999.
Different thinning contractors and thinning methods were
used at the different blocks, with resulting differences in the
treatment of slash. Block 1 was thinned with a mechanical
feller and limbed at the tree, while Block 2 was thinned with
chain saws. Slash on Blocks 1 and 2 was later piled by hand
and bulldozer, but some slash was left scattered. Burning of
the slash piles at Blocks 1 and 2 was conducted in November
and December of 2000, and the treatment units at these
blocks were then broadcast burned between May and July of
2001. At Block 3, thinning was conducted with a whole-tree
harvesting operation in which trees were limbed in central
locations throughout each experimental unit, resulting in
large piles of slash. The slash piles at Block 3 were burned
in February 2000 and then the treatment units at this block
were broadcast burned in April 2000. Control experimental
units – one at each block – received neither thinning nor
burning.
2.3. Habitat sampling and variable construction
Two permanent sampling grids were located within each
experimental unit. Grids were located in the units by randomly

265
Fig. 1. Map of the Fort Valley study area, outside Flagstaff, Arizona. The 12 experimental units composing the study area were arranged in 3 blocks, designated B1,
B2, and B3 on the map. Within each block, an experimental unit was assigned to a control, designated as C, or one of three treatments, designated as 1.5–3, 2–4, and 3–
6. Treatments are described in detail in the text.

selecting a point for the SW corner of each sampling grid with
the restriction that the grid be at least 50 m from the
experimental unit boundaries and at least 100 m from the
other sampling grid in the unit; the grids were then oriented east
to west along their long axes. Grids consisted of 22 sampling
stations, arranged in 2 parallel lines spaced 20 m apart, each
with 11 sampling stations also placed 20 m apart–thus yielding
a sampling grid of 20 m  200 m, or 0.4 ha.
Five-meter radius habitat plots were centered on each of the
sampling stations. Pre-treatment vegetation sampling was
conducted from mid October to early December in 1998 and
post-treatment sampling was conducted from late September to
early November in 2003. All trees and shrubs in the habitat
plots were tallied. Trees were deﬁned as woody plants taller
than 2 m with dbh 10 cm, and shrubs were deﬁned as woody
plants at least 0.5 m tall with dbh <10 cm. Each log 2 m in
length and with a midpoint diameter 10 cm was measured. A
randomly-oriented transect 10 m long was placed across the
diameter of the habitat plot, and point intercept data were
recorded at 1-m intervals on grasses, forbs, woody debris, litter,
and woody vegetation cover.
We used the vegetation sampling data to construct four
variables designed to assess: (1) treatment intensity, and (2)
small mammal habitat. To assess treatment intensity we
calculated the average number of trees (TREE) in each of the 44
habitat plots within an experimental unit (22 plots per sampling
grid, 2 sampling grids per experimental unit). To assess small
mammal habitat, we constructed three variables: HERB,
SHRUB, and WOOD. We constructed an index of herbaceous
vegetation (HERB) by summing the number of points on each
of the 10-m point intercept transects that intersected either grass
or forb cover, then averaging these counts for each experi-
mental unit. We constructed the variable SHRUB by calculating
the average number of shrubs per habitat plot in each
experimental unit. We calculated woody debris volume
(WOOD) from log measurements by assuming that logs were
cylindrical, then averaging the volume of logs per habitat plot in
each experimental unit.
2.4. Habitat data analysis
As a measure of thinning intensity, we calculated the percent
change in the variable TREE from 1998 to 2003. We also
calculated changes in the three measures of small mammal
habitat: percent change in HERB, SHRUB, and WOOD from
1998 to 2003. We computed the percent change in the variable
for each experimental unit as
2003 metric  1998 metric
1998 metric
 100:
(1)
For each variable, the standard error of the percent change was
calculated based on a delta-method transformation of the
standard error of the original data (Seber, 1982), and 95%
conﬁdence intervals were constructed in order to examine
differences in the variables across different treatments and
the control; where disjoint conﬁdence intervals indicated a
statistical difference.
2.5. Small mammal trapping
Small mammal trapping was conducted at each of the
sampling grids. One large (7.6 cm  8.9 cm  22.9 cm) and 1
extra-large (10.2 cm  11.4 cm  38.1 cm) folding Sherman
live-trap were placed in the vicinity of each sampling station,
for a total of 44 traps per sampling grid. Traps were positioned
along small mammal trails and/or in proximity to rocks or
woody debris. A wood shingle was used to shade and insulate
traps. Cotton batting was placed at the back of each trap for
insulation, and approximately 20 mL of a bait mixture of rolled
oats and chicken feed was placed in each trap, with an
additional small amount of bait placed outside trap entrances.
Small mammal trapping was conducted during portions of
August through October from 1998 to 2003 during three
trapping sessions each year. Sampling grids were randomly
selected for trapping during one of the three trapping sessions,
with the two trapping grids within each experimental unit
precluded from being trapped in the same session. Trapping
sessions were terminated once approximately 90% of the
captured animals on a trapping occasion were recaptures,
yielding trapping sessions of between 8 and 11 trapping
occasions (i.e., 4–5.5 days of two trapping occasions per day).
Because thinning was not completed as of the beginning of
trapping in 1999, experimental unit 5 was not trapped and only
the completed half (i.e., one sampling grid) of experimental unit
6 was trapped in 1999. No trapping was conducted during 2000,
complete post-treatment trapping was conducted in 2001–2003.
Traps were checked in the morning and afternoon, and the
following data were recorded: trap location and size, species,
new or recapture, individual identity, age class, sex, mass, and
release condition. We classiﬁed animals as either adults or
subadults based on mass and external evidence of reproductive
status (McCravy and Rose, 1992). Animals were individually
identiﬁed with two unique ear tags.
2.6. Small mammal data analysis
The estimation of treatment effects on small mammal
densities was conducted in four steps, described in greater
detail by Converse (2005). First, we estimated abundance for
each sampling grid and year combination based on the mark-
recapture data for each species. Second, we estimated
effective trapping area at the same scale as for abundance.
Third,
we
calculated
species’ densities
and
variance–
covariance matrices at an experimental unit scale in each
year by combining abundance and area to calculate density
(individuals per ha) and then averaging density estimates over
the two sampling grids in each experimental unit. Finally, we
ﬁt models of the density estimates for each species from the
ﬁrst and last years of the study only (1998 and 2003) as a
function of year, block, treatment, treatment intensity, and the
habitat variables described above with weighted least-squares
regression analyses. We calculated species densities based
on the trapping data from all years to increase the precision
of the density estimates, but we conducted the weighted
least-squares regression analyses based on only the 1998 and
S.J. Converse et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 228 (2006) 263–273
266

2003 density estimates because our interest was in linking
densities to the habitat metrics which were measured in those
years.
Throughout the analyses, we employed an information-
theoretic philosophy of model selection with a focus on multi-
model inference (Burnham and Anderson, 2002). Tools
employed
included
model
selection
based
on
Akaike’s
Information Criterion (AIC; Akaike, 1973) corrected for small
sample size (AICc; Hurvich and Tsai, 1989), and model-
averaging based on Akaike weights (Burnham and Anderson,
2002).
2.6.1. Abundance estimation
Abundance estimates for each sampling grid in each year
were obtained through analysis of the mark-recapture data for
each small mammal species using the Huggins conditional
likelihood model (Huggins, 1989; Huggins, 1991). The
Huggins model provides for estimation of capture probabilities
and abundance estimates under the assumption of population
closure. The Huggins model estimates capture probabilities
based on animal encounter histories and produces a derived
abundance estimate based on capture probabilities and the
number of animals captured.
We proposed several a priori models of capture probabilities,
to account for the effects of variables that may have inﬂuenced
our ability to capture animals, and thus obtain unbiased
estimates of population abundance. Effects in models of capture
probability included two that were in all models based on a
priori considerations: behavioral responses to capture and time
of day (i.e., a.m. versus p.m. trap check). Additional effects
considered were age of animal, year, experimental unit, and two
variables to estimate the effects of treatments on capture
probabilities. The ﬁrst of these variables was a prescribed ﬁre
effect (applied on all treatment units beginning in 2001). The
second was the variable TREE, which was used to model
potential changes in capture probability due to changes in
habitat conditions related to thinning. Measures of the variable
TREE in 1998 were applied to estimation of capture
probabilities in 1998, and 2003 measures were applied in all
subsequent years, i.e., all years post-thinning (ﬁre did not result
in tree mortality, thus reductions in the variable TREE were
primarily related to thinning). We also modeled an interaction
effect between the ﬁre variable and the TREE variable, which
we modeled separately for each post-treatment year (ﬁre -
 TREE (year)), again to account for potential changes in
capture probabilities related to changes in habitat conditions. A
total of 36 models were considered. We ran this model set for
each of the four small mammal species.
Abundance estimation was conducted in Program MARK
3.2 (White and Burnham, 1999). Estimates from each model
were checked and models that produced nonsensical estimates
(i.e., estimates on the order of hundreds or thousands of
individuals) were deleted. Such nonsensical estimates occur
under the Huggins conditional likelihood when effects in the
models are inestimable or poorly estimable. We calculated the
model-average
abundance
estimates
and
their
variance–
covariance matrices for each species from the remaining
models based on Akaike weights (Burnham and Anderson,
2002, 2004).
2.6.2. Effective trap area estimation
We used the mean maximum distance moved (MMDM)
method to estimate effective trapping area (Wilson and
Anderson, 1985). We calculated the maximum distance moved
(in m) between any two traps for each marked animal with 2
captures in a given sampling grid in a given year. For each
species, we speciﬁed a set of regression models (PROC REG;
SAS Institute, 2003) to determine model weights and estimate
values of MMDM. Only single parameter models were
considered, including MMDM as a constant value across
sampling grids and years, and as a function of year, experimental
unit, prescribed ﬁre, the variable TREE, and the treatment
interaction effect (ﬁre  TREE (year)), for a total of six models.
Fewer, less complex models were considered than in the
abundance analysis because less information is available in the
mark-recapture data toestimate maximummovement distance as
compared to capture probabilities. We computed AICc for each
of the regression models (Burnham and Anderson, 2002).
We then calculated a vector of MMDM estimates under each
model across the sampling grids and years based on the
regression coefﬁcients, along with a variance–covariance
matrix based on a delta-method
transformation of the
variance–covariance matrix of the regression coefﬁcients
(Seber, 1982). We calculated effective trapping area under
each model by adding a buffer strip with a width of one-half the
model-averaged MMDM to the area of each trapping grid (Otis
et al., 1978; Wilson and Anderson, 1985), and calculated the
variance–covariance matrix of effective trap area under each
model using a delta-method transformation of the MMDM
variance–covariance matrix, which was then converted from m2
to ha. Finally, we calculated the model-average estimates of
effective trapping area and their variance–covariance matrix
across all models (Burnham and Anderson, 2002, 2004).
2.6.3. Density calculation
Species-speciﬁc densities were calculated on each sampling
grid in each year as the abundance divided by the effective
trapping area for that grid. These estimates were averaged
across the two sampling grids in each experimental unit to
calculate the average density within an experimental unit in
each year. A series of delta-method transformations was used to
convert the variance–covariance matrices of abundance and
effective trapping area at the grid scale to a variance–covariance
matrix of density at the experimental unit scale (Seber, 1982).
Weighted regression analysis cannot be conducted with
variances of 0 because the variance–covariance matrix is
singular. Variances of 0 occurred in the density variance–
covariance matrix when no animals of a species were caught on
a given experimental unit in a given year. To provide variances
in these cases, we ﬁt a linear regression (PROC REG; SAS
Institute, 2003) of the natural log of variances against their
corresponding density estimates and determined the regression
intercept (Franklin, 1997). The exponential of the regression
intercept then served as the variance for the 0 density estimates.

2.6.4. Treatment and habitat effects estimation
The analysis of treatment effects was conducted under a
weighted least-squares regression analysis (Draper and Smith,
1998) in PROC IML (SAS Institute, 2003). The computational
details of the analysis, including calculation of AICc, regression
coefﬁcients, and variance estimates are provided in Converse
(2005) and Converse et al. (in press).
We modeled species densities in 1998 and 2003 only so
that we could examine the impacts of the habitat variables
(HERB, SHRUB, and WOOD), and the treatment intensity
variable (TREE), which were measured in those years, on
population densities. Therefore, we extracted the 1998 and
2003 portions of the vectors of density estimates and
variance–covariance matrices from those for the vectors
and matrices for all years. We speciﬁed multiple models
describing relationships of small mammal densities to habitat
variables and to treatments. Effects considered in the models
included two blocking effects, year and block. We began by
determining which of these blocking factors should be
included in the models for each species; thus we ﬁrst con-
sidered four models: intercept + year + block, intercept +
year, intercept + block, and intercept. We used the top-ranked
(based on AICc) of these four models to build models with
habitat and treatment variables.
Treatment variables included two types: treatment intensity
(the variable TREE) and a bivariate treatment effect (TREAT;
applied to treated units in 2003). The treatment intensity effect
was constructed from the variable TREE because we believed
this to be a more accurate and direct measure of treatment
intensity than treatment category (i.e., 1.5–3, 2–4, and 3–6),
and because we found, based on our analysis of the percent
change in the TREE variable, that thinning intensity was not
directly related to treatment category (see Section 3.1).
Conversely, the TREAT effect did not differentiate the effects
of treatment across treated areas, and thus was used to model
the effect of any amount of thinning followed by prescribed
ﬁre. Each of the three measured habitat variables – HERB,
SHRUB, and WOOD – were also included in models. We
considered all combinations of the 5 effects (TREE, TREAT,
HERB, SHRUB, WOOD) for a total of 32 models of
population densities.
For each of the treatment and habitat effects in the analyses,
we computed relative importance values (Burnham and
Anderson, 2002), and used these metrics to rank the effects
in order of their importance in inﬂuencing densities. Relative
importance values are calculated by summing the Akaike
weights over all models in a balanced set which include a
given effect. Simulation studies have suggested that relative
importance values of 0.40 or higher indicate that a given
variable is inﬂuencing the process of interest (G.C. White,
Colorado State University, unpublished data). We also cal-
culated the model-average estimates of regression coefﬁcients
and their 95% conﬁdence intervals (Burnham and Anderson,
2002). We based our inference about treatment and habitat
effects on all available evidence, including AICc model
selection rankings, relative importance values, and 95%
conﬁdence intervals on regression coefﬁcients.

Conﬁdence intervals (95%) indicated that percent change in
thevariables TREE, HERB, SHRUB, and WOOD were different
between treated experimental units and controls. In some cases,
these variables also were different between treatment intensities.
On average, tree densities, measured by the variable TREE,
declined 71% on 1.5–3 experimental units, 75% on 2–4
experimental units, and 55% on 3–6 experimental units (Fig. 2).
As expected, the 1.5–3 treatment resulted in a larger decline in
the variable TREE than the 3–6 treatment, but, unexpectedly,
the 1.5–3 treatment resulted in a slightly smaller decline than
the 2–4 treatment, an apparent result of variations in the number
of pre-Euro-settlement remnants on the experimental units.
The percent change in tree densities on control units between
1998 and 2003 was not statistically different than 0. The value
of the variable ranged from 463 to 802 ha1 prior to treatment
(all experimental units). After treatment, the variable TREE
ranged from 101 to 234 ha1 on 1.5–3 units, 142–194 ha1 on
2–4 units, and 206–327 ha1 on 3–6 units.
Overall, herbaceous cover increased substantially with
treatments (Fig. 3). The index variable HERB increased
199% on the 1.5–3 treatment units, 208% on the 2–4 treatment
units, and 62% on the 3–6 treatment. The percent changes on
the 1.5–3 and 3–6 treatment units were statistically different
from each other, but neither was statistically different from
the change on 2–4 treatment units. The percent change in
HERB on control units did not differ statistically from 0.
The density of shrubs declined after treatments (Fig. 4).
The variable SHRUB declined 86% on the 1.5–3 treatment,
99% on the 2–4 treatment, and 96% on the 3–6 treatment. Each
of these differed statistically from each other, and from the
control. Shrubs on the control units also declined, on average,
by 36%, which may have represented either growth of shrubs
out of the shrub category, or high mortality of shrubs, perhaps

due to drought. Nearly all shrubs recorded in the experimental
units were shrub-sized ponderosa pines, particularly prior to
treatment, when ponderosa pine accounted for 96% (95%
CI = 96% and 97%) of all shrubs. After treatment, ponderosa
pine accounted for 84% (95% CI = 81% and 88%) of all
shrubs. The next most common species were Wood’s rose and
shrub-sized Gambel’s oak, but each of these accounted for
<2% of all shrubs pre-treatment, and <7% of all shrubs post-
treatment. Pre-treatment shrub densities ranged from 90 to
2246 ha1. After treatments, shrub densities ranged from 20
to 55 ha1 on 1.5–3 units, 0–23 ha1 on 2–4 units, and
3–104 ha1 on 3–6 units.
Finally, woody debris declined after treatments (Fig. 5). The
variable WOOD declined by 44% on 1.5–3 units, 78% on 2–4
units, and 78% on 3–6 units. There was no statistical difference
between the 1.5–3, 2–4, and 3–6 treatments, and the decline on
the 1.5–3 treatment units was not different from the control.
Change in woody debris on control units did not differ
statistically from 0. Pre-treatment woody debris volume ranged
from approximately 1280 to 4587 m3 ha1 (all experimental
units);

3.2. Small mammal populations
During small mammal trapping at the FVSA, ﬁve species
were captured and marked, including deer mice (n = 995
individuals), brush mice (Peromyscus boylii; n = 4), gray-
collared chipmunks (n = 474), golden-mantled ground-squirrels
(n = 137), and Mexican woodrats (n = 67). Deer mice and brush
mice were combined in all analyses, and are herein referred to as
deer mice, because brush mice constituted such a small number
of captures, and because, particularly with young animals,
Peromyscus spp. can be difﬁcult to distinguish reliably.
Among all species monitored, estimated densities were
generally higher in the ﬁrst 2 years (1998–1999) than in the last
3 years (2001–2003). These differences were most apparent for
deer mice, golden-mantled ground squirrels, and woodrats.
Deer mouse densities ranged from 5.46 to 31.20 individuals
ha1 in 1998–1999, and 0–17.35 in 2001–2003. Gray-collared
chipmunk densities ranged from 0.46 to 7.99 individuals ha1
in 1998–1999, and 0–7.01 in 2001–2003. Golden-mantled
ground squirrel densities ranged from 0 to 5.78 individuals ha1
in 1998–1999, and 0–3.36 in 2001–2003. Mexican woodrat
densities ranged from 0 to 6.06 individuals ha1 in 1998–1999,
and 0–1.79 in 2001–2003.
The top-ranked model of deer mouse densities was
(intercept + year + block + TREE) with a weight of 0.12
(Table 1). The second-ranked model, with nearly equal weight,
was model (intercept + year + block). Of the treatment and
habitat variables, the variable TREE had a relative importance
of 0.43 and a negative effect on deer mouse density (Table 2).
All other variables had relative importance values <0.40.

and control. Pre-treatment measurements were made in 1998 and post-treatment
measurements were made in 2003.

treatment measurements were made in 1998 and post-treatment measurements
were made in 2003.

coarse woody debris; m3/ha) and 95% conﬁdence intervals (95% CI) with three
levels of thinning treatment (1.5–3, 2–4, and 3–6; described in text) followed by
burning, and control. Pre-treatment measurements were made in 1998 and post-
treatment measurements were made in 2003.

The top-ranked model of gray-collared chipmunk densities,
with a weight of 0.33, was model (intercept + block + TREE +
TREAT + WOOD; Table 1). The second-ranked model, which
also had high weight (0.25), was model (intercept + block +
TREE + TREAT + HERB + WOOD). Of thevariables in the top
model, the variable with the largest relative importance was
WOOD (1.00), followed by the variable TREE (0.95), and
TREAT (0.84). HERB, which appeared in the second-ranked
model, had a relative importance of 0.45, while the variable
SHRUB had a relative importance <0.40 (Table 2). The variable
WOOD had a positive regression coefﬁcient, while TREE,
TREAT, and HERB had negative regression coefﬁcients.
For golden-mantled ground squirrels, the top-ranked model
included only the intercept term, and had a weight of 0.13
(Table 1). However, model (intercept + SHRUB) had a weight
(0.12) that was nearly as high. The variable SHRUB had a
relative importance value of 0.41 and a positive regression
coefﬁcient. All other variables had relative importance values
<0.40 (Table 2).
In the analysis of Mexican woodrat densities, the top-ranked
model was model (intercept + year + SHRUB) with a weight
of 0.18 (Table 1). The second-ranked model was (intercept
+ year + SHRUB + WOOD) with a weight of 0.13. The relative
importance value for the SHRUB variable was 0.90, and for the
WOOD variable it was 0.51 (Table 2). Both SHRUB and
WOOD had positive effect size estimates. All other variables
had relative importance values <0.40.
4. Discussion
The fuel reduction/restoration treatments examined in this
study resulted in changes in small mammal habitat components,
with herbaceous vegetation increasing after treatments, and
shrubs and woody debris declining. The greatest observed
increase in herbaceous vegetation was slightly more than a
doubling on the 2–4 treatment units, indicating that treatments
yielded large increases in herbaceous vegetation within 2–3
growing seasons. These ﬁndings are supported by studies
indicating increases in herbaceous vegetation in ponderosa pine
and other forests by 1–2 growing seasons after thinning and/or
prescribed ﬁre (Bock and Bock, 1983; Harris and Covington,
1983; Covington et al., 1997; Carey and Wilson, 2001). Less
information is available with which to compare our ﬁndings
on changes in shrub cover after treatments—it seems likely that
with more time after ﬁre, shrub densities would increase. In
the short term, however, ﬁre appeared to differentially reduce
the availability of common ponderosa pine seedlings and
saplings, with reductions in densities of 86–96%, whereas the
numbers of other less common shrub species did not appear to
change. Woody debris declined between 44% and 78% after
treatments. This decline was least pronounced with the 1.5–3
treatments, a result that was likely due to local variations in the
volume of deposited slash and ﬁre intensity. Covington and
Sackett (1984) documented declines of approximately 60% in
woody debris after prescribed ﬁre in southwestern ponderosa
pine. Overall, treatment-related changes in the habitat variables
were approximately as expected.
An important determinant of small mammal densities in this
study appeared to be annual variation unrelated to treatments,
particularly in the case of deer mice (see also Block et al.,
2005). Estimated densities of small mammals were generally
lower during the last 3 years of this study than during the ﬁrst 2
years. Reduced population densities in 2001–2003 may have
been due partly to weather patterns. The southwestern US was
experiencing a drought during the early 2000s, and lack of
rainfall may inhibit development of food sources for small
mammals. While the 50-year mean annual precipitation in the
Flagstaff area was approximately 55 cm, total precipitation for

2000–2003 was 39, 45, 33, and 45 cm, respectively (Flagstaff-
Pulliam Airport data, National Climatic Data Center, available
at http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/ncdc.html).
More interesting were the impacts of treatment and habitat
variables on densities of small mammal populations, because
each of the habitat and treatment variables considered can be
manipulated by forest managers through application of fuel
reduction treatments. We found that shrubs and woody debris
were the habitat components most strongly related to small
mammal densities, but we also found additional treatment-
related variation in densities that was best explained by the
treatment variables (TREE and TREAT).
Of the treatment and habitat variables examined, only the
treatment intensity variable (TREE) appeared to have power as
a predictor of deer mouse densities. This variable had a negative
estimated effect on deer mice, i.e., as tree densities decreased,
deer mouse populations increased. This ﬁnding is supported by
additional research that deer mice beneﬁt from thinning
(Goodwin and Hungerford, 1979; Wilson and Carey, 2000;
Carey and Wilson, 2001; Suzuki and Hayes, 2003; Converse
et al., in press). Changes in habitat variables – herbaceous
cover, shrubs, and woody debris – did not have power to explain
post-treatment deer mouse densities. Deer mouse populations
have been thought to respond to increases in herbaceous food
and cover, thus resulting in observed positive responses to
thinning (Wilson and Carey, 2000; Carey and Wilson, 2001)
and prescribed ﬁre (Tester, 1965; Bock and Bock, 1983; Kyle
and Block, 2000), but deer mouse populations have been linked
elsewhere with lower levels of herbaceous vegetation (Manning
and Edge, 2004; Hadley and Wilson, 2004; Block et al., 2005).
Deer mouse populations have been positively linked with the
availability of woody debris (Goodwin and Hungerford, 1979;
Carey and Johnson, 1995; Carey and Harrington, 2001; Suzuki
and Hayes, 2003) and shrub cover (Carey and Johnson, 1995;
Kyle and Block, 2000), but have also been linked with lower
levels of shrub cover (Block et al., 2005). Manning and Edge
(2004, p. 93) concluded that deer mice may be obligates of
‘‘relatively low amounts of woody debris and herbaceous
vegetation’’. Thus, there is complexity, as well as uncertainty,
in the effects of these habitat components on deer mouse
numbers, and apparently strong geographic variation in the
relationships between deer mice and forest habitats. Reduction
in tree densities appears to be the most consistent predictor of
increased deer mouse populations.
Woody debris was the best predictor of gray-collared
chipmunk densities. A positive relationship between gray-
collared chipmunk densities and woody debris was expected,
based on chipmunks’ use of logs and stumps for travelling,
nesting, and feeding platforms (Hilton and Best, 1993). Previous
research has also suggested that availability of slash from
thinning operations may have a positive impact on gray-collared
chipmunk populations in southwestern ponderosa pine forests
(Goodwin and Hungerford, 1979; Converse et al., in press).
Conversely, gray-collared chipmunk densities were negatively,
though weakly, linked with herbaceous cover. This result is
contrary to that found for chipmunks in the Paciﬁc Northwest,
where densities were highest in thinned stands with understory
development (Wilson and Carey, 2000; Carey, 2001). Treatment
effects, including thinning intensity (the variable TREE) and the
bivariate treatment variable (TREAT), were also important
predictors of gray-collared chipmunk densities. Lower tree
density was related to higher gray-collared chipmunk densities,
while at the same time the effect of any level of thinning and
prescribed ﬁre treatment was negative. The negative estimated
relationship between tree density and chipmunk populations
supports previous research that chipmunks beneﬁt from thinning
in southwestern ponderosa pine forests (Goodwin and Hunger-
ford, 1979; Converse et al., in press), and Paciﬁc Northwest
forests (Wilson and Carey, 2000; Carey, 2001; Carey and Wilson,
2001). However, while thinning reduces tree density (i.e., the
TREE variable), producing a positive impact on gray-collared
chipmunks, thinning and prescribed ﬁre combined (i.e., the
TREAT variable) had a negative impact on gray-collared
chipmunks, which was likely related to the reduction in woody
debris availability after prescribed ﬁre. This lends further support
to the result that woody debris is the strongest determinant of
chipmunk densities.
We had little power to predict densities of golden-mantled
ground squirrels. The only variable of, apparently minor,
importancewas shrub densities. Because golden-mantled ground
squirrels are residents of grassland/forest margins and shrubland
(Goodwin and Hungerford, 1979; Bartels and Thompson, 1993;
Fitzgerald et al., 1994), the positive relationship between golden-
mantled ground squirrels and shrubs could be expected.
Proximity to forest margins may be a critical determinant of
densities of this species, and thus populations may not be highly
sensitive to treatments or treatment-related habitat changes.
Shrub density was the best predictor of Mexican woodrat
densities, and woody debris also had power as a predictor.
Positive relationships between Mexican woodrats and shrub
density (Sureda and Morrison, 1999; Ward, 2001; Block et al.,
2005), as well as woody debris (Ward, 2001) have previously
been documented, though Mexican woodrats appear to be most
closely linked with rocky slopes and outcrops (Fitzgerald et al.,
1994; Sureda and Morrison, 1999; Ward, 2001; Block et al.,
2005). Block et al. (2005) suggested that management for
herbaceous
and
shrub
vegetation
through
thinning
and
prescribed burning near areas with rock cover could beneﬁt
Mexican woodrats.
5. Conclusions
Overall, our results indicate that some level of fuel reduction
may be beneﬁcial to small mammal populations in these forests.
Deer mice should increase with thinning and/or prescribed ﬁre
treatments in most areas. Mexican woodrats, and perhaps
golden-mantled ground squirrels, should beneﬁt from thinning,
or possibly prescribed ﬁre treatments that encourage shrub
densities in the long-term by reducing canopy cover, at least in
stands where pre-treatment pines are very dense. Furthermore,
retaining slash after thinning treatments may help to support
both gray-collared chipmunks and Mexican woodrat popula-
tions. However, design and application of fuel reduction
treatments may not best rely on a restoration philosophy.

Evaluating the assumptions of restoration as an appropriate
philosophy for management of southwestern ponderosa pine
forests is an important enterprise, given the strong interest in
fuel reduction/restoration treatments in these forests (Allen
et al., 2002). Indeed, questions exist over whether knowledge of
historical conditions in southwestern ponderosa pine forests is
adequate to restore these conditions. For instance, historical
mean ﬁre return intervals, as frequently reconstructed for
southwestern ponderosa pine forests using ﬁre scar techniques,
may underestimate the length of ﬁre-free intervals (e.g., Baker
and Ehle, 2001). If biased estimates are used to determine rates
of prescribed ﬁre entry in current forest management, the result
may be a reduction in shrub cover and woody debris cover
below levels historically experienced by small mammals in
these forests. Shrub and woody debris cover were the habitat
components that were overall the strongest predictors of small
mammal population densities in our study. Thus, our results
underscore how overly-frequent burning could negatively
impact at least two species (gray-collared chipmunks and
Mexican woodrats) in these forests through reduction of shrubs
and woody debris. However, some level of prescribed ﬁre may
increase shrub densities by opening up the forest canopy and
releasing nutrients (e.g., Harris and Covington, 1983).
Even if historical knowledge was adequate and restoration of
historical conditions was possible, it is unclear that restoring
historical conditions would result in conservation of forest
ecologicalvalues, e.g., wildlife diversity (Wagneret al., 2000). In
light ofchangingclimaticconditions,the presenceofexoticplant
species, and signiﬁcant land area in human uses, such as cities
and suburban areas, restoring conditions present in southwestern
forests prior to Euro-settlement may not be the best way to
conserve forest ecological values. Certainly, monitoring of
treated areas will be necessary, and an adaptive management
philosophy (Walters, 1986) may be beneﬁcial to the management
of forests to reduce ﬁre risk and provide for ecological values.
Potential problems with the study design we describe here
include the scale of small mammal and vegetation sampling,
which may have occurred on an overly small area to fully
capture the pre- and post-treatment dynamics of the system.
Furthermore, sampling was only conducted at one time during
each year in the experimental units, which limits the inference
to late summer and fall dynamics. Finally, inconsistencies in
the treatments also complicate the results, including variation
in the timing of thinning and burning activities and the variable
thinning methods used. However, our approach, by focusing
on relationships between small mammals and vegetation
components, should serve to elucidate the mechanisms which
drive small mammal responses to fuel reduction treatments.
There is a need to carefully assess ecological effects of fuel
reduction/restoration treatments over longer time periods. In
this study, major changes in population densities over the
course of the study may have masked additional effects of
treatments or habitat variables; studying populations over
longer time periods will reduce the impact of high temporal
variation on the estimation of treatment effects, and will give a
better sense of the long-term impacts of treatments (for
example, the length of time before shrub cover recovers after
prescribed ﬁre treatments). Longer-term experiments with
multiple re-entries of thinning and/or prescribed ﬁre are needed
to elucidate effects of potential southwestern ponderosa pine
management strategies on forest ecology. Researchers should
seek opportunities to partner with forest management agencies
to make such experiments feasible.
