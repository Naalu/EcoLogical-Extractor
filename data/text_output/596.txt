The Ecological Restoration Institute
The Ecological Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona University is a pioneer in 
researching, implementing, and monitoring ecological restoration of southwestern 
ponderosa pine forests. These forests have been significantly altered over the last century, 
with decreased ecological and recreational values, near-elimination of natural low-
intensity fire regimes, and greatly increased risk of large-scale fires. The ERI is working 
with public agencies and other partners to restore these forests to a more ecologically 
healthy condition and trajectory—in the process helping to significantly reduce the 
threat of catastrophic wildfire and its effects on human, animal, and plant communities.
The Program in Restoration Policy at the ERI strives to connect the ecological aspects of 
restoration with wider social and policy issues. The Program conducts a variety of social 
science research and outreach activities guided by the explicit assumption that 
ecological restoration and ecological sustainability are intricately linked to human 
community, society, and democratic processes. For more information contact us at the

ERI Papers in Restoration Policy
Introduction
Over the past thirty-five years, the U.S. has adopted an extensive network of laws, adminis-
trative regulations, and public participation requirements to make federal agencies consider
the environmental as well as economic and technical feasibility of their projects, and to hold
them accountable for their decisions. Requirements of the National Environmental Policy
Act of 1969 (NEPA), Endangered Species Act restrictions, the right to appeal projects, and
provisions for citizen suits open agency decisions to extensive public review, and force
agencies to revisit favored plans and projects. The USDA Forest Service (USFS) and Presi-
dent George W. Bush have argued that this plethora of laws and their misuse have resulted
in a “process predicament” and “analysis by paralysis” (USDA Forest Service, 2002a; USDA
Forest Service, 2002b; Bush, 2002). The legislatively-mandated appeals process of the
Forest Service, which allows parties to appeal a Forest Service decision to proceed with a
project, has been cited as a major impediment to moving fuels reduction and ecological
restoration projects forward—projects that would reduce the potential for catastrophic
wildfires, such as those the nation witnessed during the 2000 and 2002 fire seasons. Envi-
ronmental groups are most often painted as the culprits, using procedural requirements to
stall, delay, or cancel timber sales, fuels reduction activities, vegetation management, and
restoration projects.
 With Oregon’s largest ever fire—the 499,570-acre Biscuit fire—as a backdrop, Presi-
dent Bush announced his Healthy Forests Initiative in August 2002, recommending expe-
diting the environmental review of restoration projects, eliminating the Forest Service’s
statutorily-mandated project appeals process, and revising the criteria the judiciary could
use in deciding whether to grant injunctive relief to appellants. Legislation to implement
these policy recommendations was introduced into both the 107th and 108th Congresses. In
December 2002, the Bush administration proposed rule changes to part 215 of Title 36 of
the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)—the section pertaining to projects subject to the
NEPA planning process. The proposed rule would expand the definitions of “emergency
situation” and “categorical exclusion” to limit the current right to administratively appeal
project decisions (64 FR 77451). In addition, prior to announcing the Healthy Forests
Initiative, the President had convened a White House task force to review NEPA and make
further recommendations for regulatory revision. Not surprisingly, the Bush proposals have
created a political firestorm among various stakeholder groups.
This paper reports on the first phase of a project being conducted by the Ecological
Restoration Institute (ERI) at Northern Arizona University. This project is designed to
systematically document and analyze the outcomes and impacts of administrative appeals
and NEPA processes on the formulation and implementation of fuels reduction/ecological
restoration projects using a variety of evaluative measures, both quantitative and qualitative.
Such an analysis has not been previously conducted. This is indeed surprising given the
political attention appeals are receiving from policymakers, the public, and the media in

relation to the nation’s wildfire problems (as part of the larger picture of regulations for
environmental planning and analysis). For such a politically contentious issue, there has been
no comprehensive and systematic analysis of the outcomes of the appeals process, even
though selected anecdotal evidence is being abundantly cited and used as the basis for policy
changes.
The first phase of the ERI project consisted of outlining the overall appeals process.
Before selecting individual cases for in-depth examination we wanted to know, for example,
how many appeals are processed by the USFS each year, who the appellants are, whether
project delays are created by the appeals process, and the types of projects being appealed. We
discovered that answering these questions was not as simple as might have been expected, and
found it necessary to construct our own database of Forest Service appeals. This report
describes the process of constructing this database, the choices made, and the problems
encountered in making those choices. It also presents the results of analysis derived nationally,
for two Forest Service regions—Region 6 (Oregon and Washington) and Region 3 (Arizona
and New Mexico)—and for four forests in Arizona: the Apache-Sitgreaves, Coconino,
Kaibab, and Prescott1.
Both the General Accounting Office (GAO; 2001) and the Forest Service (2002a,
2002b) prepared reports discussing the magnitude of the appeals “problem,” but neither
report was generated from a comprehensive database. Two reports laid out the problem from
the Forest Service perspective. The first, The Process Predicament, provided largely anecdotal
evidence to conclude that appeals can greatly delay a project, sometimes with “disastrous
results” (USDA Forest Service 2002b, p. 29). The June 2002 report was followed by a July
2002 analysis, Factors Affecting Timely Mechanical Fuel Treatment Decisions, prepared in
response to a request from a member of Congress. Using information supplied by its regional
offices, the document examined 326 decisions to implement mechanical treatments for
hazardous fuels reduction on National Forest System lands in FY 2001 and FY 2002 (as of
June 27). Of the 326 projects it labeled as mechanical treatments of hazardous fuels, the
document concluded that approximately one-half (155) of all decisions were appealed;
Region 1 (Montana, Northern Idaho, North Dakota, and NW South Dakota) reported that
100 percent of its 53 projects involving mechanical treatments were appealed. Of the projects
appealed, the document indicated that six percent (21) have been litigated (USDA Forest
Service 2002a). On the basis of this data, the USFS concluded that “administrative appeals
and litigation contribute significantly to the time it takes to plan for and decide on fuels
projects prior to implementation” (USDA Forest Service 2002b, p. 4)2. The Forest Service
1 Region 3, and the four forests in northern Arizona, are of particular interest because of the
location of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona. Another phase of this project
involved a workshop in Troutdale, Oregon, to discuss development of an evaluative framework to
examine the impacts of appeals. Analysis of Region 6 is included in this report as it is of particular
interest to workshop participants in the Pacific Northwest.
2 The Forest Service subsequently revised the numbers in its Factors report. An agency spokesperson
stated the initial report was “compiled as a ’speedy response’ to a congressional inquiry” and the
Forest Service has since rechecked its numbers. The revised numbers include 206 (rather than 326)
mechanical thinning treatment projects, with 143 (or 69%) of them appealed (Stempeck 2002).

3
ERI Papers in Restoration Policy
documents were prompted, in part, by an earlier General Accounting Office (2001) report
that relied upon data supplied by Forest Service headquarters and regional offices. The GAO
analysis found that of 1,671 hazardous fuels reduction projects (not just limited to mechani-
cal treatments) identified for implementation during FY 2001, only 20 (one percent) had
been appealed and none litigated.
Subsequent to release of these reports, environmental organizations prepared their own
analyses to counter the Forest Service’s data about the extent to which project appeals and
litigation impede fuels reduction projects. Both the Forest Trust and the Wilderness Society
contended that the agency’s July 2002 report was characterized by biased sampling, unreli-
able data, and unsupported conclusions (Morton and McCarthy, 2002; Wilderness Society,
2002). Both organizations, for example, noted that the Forest Service’s report did not
include prescribed burn projects that were intended as fuels reduction projects, and in-
cluded projects that were not fuels reduction projects. Of the 155 projects that were admin-
istratively appealed, the Forest Trust identified several that were incorrectly included in the
USFS sample, as well as the lack of a consistent definition to identify mechanical treatments
to reduce hazardous fuels. The Forest Trust also pointed out that the Forest Service in-
cluded 37 projects in its analysis that it had not reported to investigators for the GAO
study. The Wilderness Society noted that the USFS report also failed to include projects not
subject to appeal, even though such projects are still subject to legal challenge.
The Forest Service and GAO reports focused primarily on the question of how many
fuels reduction projects (that presumably would lessen the risk of large wildland crown
fires) had been challenged by appeals and litigation, and not on the question of the overall
impacts and outcomes of appeals. There was a presumption in the Forest Service reports,
for example, that the filing of an appeal meant delay and that such delays were positively
correlated with exacerbating the wildfire problem. There was no attempt to take a more
expansive look at appeals to include their purpose and role in governance, or their costs and
benefits arrayed along a variety of criteria and indicators—economic, social and institu-
tional. That was not their purpose, but that is the overall intent of the ERI study.
ERI’s database, of course, does not answer questions about the outcomes and impacts of
the appeal process that the study ultimately wants to evaluate. During Phase II of the
project, participants in a January 2003 workshop in Troutdale, Oregon, discussed develop-
ment of an evaluative framework for determining the outcomes and impacts of appeals.
Once this framework is finalized, case studies from the database will be drawn during a
third phase of project work to ensure a representative sample. The database, however, does
provide a departure point for answering questions about the numbers of appeals the agency
has faced, and how they are distributed by year, region, CFR section, and types of appel-
lants.

4
Forest Service appeals: the database
The Database
The data set includes 3,635 administrative appeals records of decisions reached between
January 1, 1997, and September 30, 2002, and available on the Forest Service’s website,
www.fs.fed.us/forum/nepa. The Forest Service is required to post its appeal decisions
online, as the result of a 1999 court settlement between the Wyoming Outdoor Council
and the Forest Service:
The Forest Service agrees that…the Freedom of Information Act, as amended, requires
the Forest Service to make available by computer telecommunications or other
electronic means Forest Service administrative appeal final decisions issued on or after
November 1, 1996.    (Byrd 1999)
Because of the date stipulated in the agreement, as well as the 7-year file retention
policy for appeals (Segovia 2002), it is unlikely many records would be available prior to
1996. Although some decisions from 1996 were available online, this was not consistently
the case across National Forests or Regions. Consequently, we did not include 1996 records
in the study and began our analysis with 1997 data. We chose September 30, 2002, as the
ending point for the analysis to accommodate any lag time involved in posting appeal
documents on the Internet. The time lag varies greatly across National Forests and Re-
gions—in some instances, newly posted decisions were more than 18-months old. Several
records that are more recent were available, but again this was not consistent across Na-
tional Forests or Regions. In addition, some participants at the January 2003 workshop
expressed concern that not all decisions related to their appeals had been posted online.
Therefore, we can only say with confidence our data set includes all appeal records posted
on the Forest Service website as of January 17, 2003.
Unlike the GAO report or the Forest Service’s analyses of appeals filed in relation to
mechanical fuel treatments, our database focuses only on recorded appeals. We did not
attempt at this point, for example, to determine how many fuels reduction projects out of
the total number of project decisions made by the agency were, in fact, appealed.
Our analysis is limited to decisions made at the Regional level, and does not include
decisions made by the Washington, D.C. Office of the Forest Service. Washington Office
decisions include appeals of Land and Resource Management Plans (Forest Plans), as well as
discretionary reviews of regional decisions. This study concerns administrative appeals of
National Forest projects only; as such, we did not include appeals of Forest Plans in the data
set. However, Forest Plan amendments may be appealed as projects at the Regional level.
Therefore, appeals of Forest Plan amendments decided at the Regional level are included in
the database.
Decisions made by District Rangers, Forest Supervisors, or Regional Foresters under
Title 36 of the CFR (sections 217 and 251) are subject to multiple levels of review. For
instance, the Forest Service Chief, at his/her discretion, may review a dismissal or appeal

5
ERI Papers in Restoration Policy
decision made by a Regional Forester. The Forest Service refers to this as discretionary
review. Additionally, the Secretary of Agriculture may elect to review a dismissal or appeal
decision made by the Forest Service Chief. Federal regulations explain discretionary review
of appeals under 36 CFR 217.17(a):
Petitions or requests for discretionary review shall not, in and of themselves, give rise to
a decision to exercise discretionary review. In electing to exercise discretion, a Reviewing
Officer should consider, but is not limited to, such factors as controversy surrounding
the decision, the potential for litigation, whether the decision is precedential in nature,
or whether the decision modifies existing or establishes new policy.
Section 251.100(a) of CFR Title 36 uses identical language to explain discretionary
review of decisions related to permits and written authorizations. Regulations found under
36 CFR 215 do not mention discretionary review.
Discretionary reviews are made of the existing appeal record only. The Forest Service
does not reopen the appeal record for either the appellant or the original reviewing officer
to provide additional information. Consequently, including discretionary reviews conducted
by the Washington Office would result in double counting some appeal files. For instance,
if the Washington Office exercised discretionary review on an appeal filed by Appellant X
and decided in Region 3, then including the discretionary review in the database would
erroneously inflate the number of appeals filed by Appellant X because the appeal was
actually filed only once (in Region 3).
As mentioned previously, the database includes only those appeals processed at the
regional level. Discretionary review decisions have been included when exercised by a Forest
Supervisor (reviewing a District Ranger’s decision) or a Regional Forester (reviewing a
Forest Supervisor’s decision).
While not including Washington Office discretionary reviews, examination of data
presented on the website does give a general idea of the kinds of cases brought up for
discretionary review and their disposition. During the study period, for example, the
Minerals and Geology Management staff of the Washington Office exercised discretionary
review on 14 appeals. One decision was rescinded due to a procedural error and another was
not decided within the designated time (letting the Regional Forester’s decision stand). The
Regional Foresters’ decisions were reversed in three cases and affirmed in the remaining nine
cases. Thirteen decisions were reviewed in the area of Wildlife, Fish and Rare plants—all of
them addressing protection and recovery for the Mexican spotted owl and northern goshawk
in Region 3 (Arizona and New Mexico). The Regional Forester’s decision was affirmed in 12
of the 13 cases. One appeal was dismissed without review. The Lands and Realty Manage-
ment staff considered 93 appeals during the study period. More than 60 percent (58 of 93)
addressed land exchange decisions. During the study period, the Washington Office did not
exercise discretionary review for any decisions in the following areas: engineering, forest

management, range management, and watershed and air management. We could not deter-
mine the number of appeals considered in the area of Recreation, Heritage, and Wilderness
Resources because that link on the Forest Service website was not accessible.
Figure 1 provides an example of one appeal record developed as part of the ERI database.
Variables include: the CFR section under which the appeal was filed, the identifying appeal
number, Forest Service region, National Forest name, month and year of appeal, date of
decision, project type, appellants, disposition of the appeal and federal statutes cited in the
appeal.

ERI Papers in Restoration Policy
CFR Section
All administrative appeals of Forest Service decisions are reviewed in accordance with regula-
tions promulgated by the Forest Service in the Code of Federal Regulations (see Table 1).
Decisions related to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the National Forest
Management Act (NFMA) are subject to Forest Service appeals regulations found in Title 36
of the CFR, Parts 215 and 217 respectively. Decisions related to occupancy and use of
National Forest lands, such as rulings on special-use permits, are subject to appeal under 36
CFR 251, subpart C.
The CFR section under which the appeal was filed was explicitly mentioned in the vast
majority of appeal decision letters sent to the appellants. Of the 3,635 records in the data-
base, the CFR section was “undetermined” in only 121 cases. In these cases, the online record
did not mention any CFR sections.
Given the proposed rule changes to 36 CFR 215 published in December 2002, and our
particular interest in fuels reduction and ecological restoration projects, we paid particular
attention to administrative appeals filed under Part 215 in this report. Throughout the
report, appeals filed under 36 CFR 215 are referred to as “215 appeals.” In each section of the
report, we have compared the number of 215 appeals to the number of total appeals both by
year of decision and by appellant.

Forest Service appeals: the database
Appeal Number
Each Forest Service region assigns distinct record numbers to appeals of its decisions, which
are used as unique identifiers for each record. Some Regional Forester decisions referenced
multiple appeal numbers. In these cases, each appeal number was given a unique record in the
data set and marked as “consolidated.” (The check box marked “Interesting” was used for
internal ERI project notes on a record and contains no quantitative data.) Second level appeals
(when Forest Service officials exercised discretionary review) were also recorded separately, as
long as the appeal number was unique. The assumption was made if the Forest Service
official assigned a new appeal number, then the appeal was being treated as a new file. With-
out knowing the Forest Service rationale for assigning new or keeping existing appeal num-
bers for the purposes of discretionary review, we followed the Forest Service’s lead and only
counted as new those files for which a new number was assigned.
Region and Forest
There are nine Forest Service regions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10 (see Figure 2). Each appeal
was coded by Region and by the National Forest from which the appeal originated. Some
appeals were filed with multiple National Forests (when projects crossed Forest boundaries),
and they were documented accordingly by including both National Forest names in the
appeal record. For example, the database includes records of appeals filed with the “Prescott”
Figure 2.  Map of USFS Regions; www.fs.fed.us/contactus/regions.shtml

9
ERI Papers in Restoration Policy
National Forest, “Coconino” National Forest, and the “Prescott/Coconino” National Forests.
The records marked as “Prescott/Coconino” are unique records, i.e., they were not also
recorded for each Forest separately.
Appeal Date
One of the frequently asked questions in the debate over administrative appeals is how long it
takes to process an appeal, and therefore what degree of project delay can be attributed to the
administrative appeals process. However, we are unable to determine the answer at this point.
Because the filing dates of the original appeals were often not included in the publicly avail-
able electronic files, we could not address a key policy question—the average length of time
from filing of an appeal to the final appeal decision. For instance, of the 3,635 appeals in the
data set, original filing dates are not available for 2,265 records (or 62%). Consequently, we
used the date of decision to link an appeal to a particular calendar year. However, we did
include the filing data in the database when available.
Disposition of the Appeal
The analysis includes appeals either reviewed or dismissed by a Forest Service official, as well
as appeals filed and eventually withdrawn by the appellants themselves. The reviewed appeals
are categorized as one of four decision types: a) denied in full, b) granted in full, c) denied
with instructions, or d) partially denied or granted. The Appeal Deciding Officer is respon-
sible for either “denying” or “granting” the appeal. In some cases with multiple appeal issues,
the Deciding Officer denies some issues and grants others. In other cases, the appeal is denied
in full, but the Deciding Officer provides additional instructions to the Responsible Official
to modify the project. These designations were clear-cut in the vast majority of appeal
decision letters sent to the appellants.
Dismissals by Forest Service officials were generally the result of a choice not to exercise
discretionary review, decisions not subject to the appeals process, or procedural errors (e.g.,
timeliness, content requirements, project scope, and lack of standing). For example, project
appeals must meet content requirements outlined in 36 CFR 215.14, which require an
appellant to:
1) State that the document is an appeal filed pursuant to 36 CFR part 215;
2) List the name and address of the appellant and, if possible, a telephone number;
3) Identify the decision document by title and subject, date of the decision, and name
and title of the Responsible Official;
4) Identify specific change(s) in the decision that the appellant seeks or portion of the
decision to which the appellant objects;
5) State how the Responsible Official’s decision fails to consider comments previously
provided...and, if applicable, how the appellant believes the decision violates law,
regulation, or policy.

10
Forest Service appeals: the database
Section 217.9 of CFR Title 36 outlines similar content requirements. Any failure to meet
these criteria results in a dismissal. The Appeal Reviewing Officer determines an appellant’s
standing, or the right to file an administrative appeal, by whether the appellant submitted
comments or otherwise expressed interest during the comment period on the proposed action
or draft environmental impact statement (36 CFR 215.11(a)). Likewise, the appellant must
file the appeal within the designated 45-day filing period once a decision has been issued (36
CFR 215.13(a)).
Dismissals also include cases in which the parties informally settle contested issues
outside of the formal appeals process. Sections 215.16, 217.12, and 251.93 of CFR Title
36 provide for “informal disposition of appeals” or “resolution of issues.” Informal resolu-
tion involves a meeting between the appellant and the Forest Service official responsible for
the decision under appeal. If the issues are resolved, Section 215.16 states the appellant
must withdraw the appeal within 15 days of the meeting, at which time the Appeal Decid-
ing Officer closes the case. If the appeal is not then withdrawn, the formal appeal process
resumes and the Appeal Deciding Officer issues a decision on the initial appeal. The origi-
nal appeal number is retained throughout the process.
Appellants
Appellants were designated as either private citizens or organizations (names of organiza-
tions were included). The “private citizen” designation was used for individuals when there
was no evidence that they were filing on behalf of a group, and where there was no group
affiliation in the return address. In some records, it was not possible to determine whether
individuals were members of an organization, but the assumption was made that they were
not filing on behalf of an organization. The data set includes appeals filed by just one appel-
lant, as well as appeals filed by multiple appellants.
Project Type
The Forest Service lacks a standard system for defining project type. Some online appeal
files contained very clear descriptions of projects, while others did not mention the project
at all. Likewise, some appeal records were more than 60 pages long, while some were barely
one page. Forty-one of the 3,635 appeal records list “undetermined” as the project type.
Figure 3 provides an example of a dismissed appeal for which the project type is “undeter-
mined.” This is the only information contained in this particular appeal file online.
Because of the discrepancies in project descriptions from one record to the next, project
type designations are not consistent between Forests and/or Regions. For instance, a fuels
reduction project on the Superior National Forest in Region 9 was described as follows:
The Gunflint Corridor Fuels Reduction project aims to reduce the fuel and fire hazard,
provide and improve land-based infrastructure needs for fire suppression and/or public
evacuation, increase the acreage and component of longer-lived species, improve long-
term visual quality, and reforest the blowdown areas. As such, the objectives involve
reducing hazards as well as looking beyond to future vegetative composition.
[Appeal #00-09-0028-A215]

11
ERI Papers in Restoration Policy
A fuels reduction project on the Lassen National Forest in Region 5 contained far more
detail:
This alternative utilizes thinning to develop a fuels modification zone of 433 acres,
improve 160 acres of habitat in a Goshawk Management Area (GMA), develop a late
successional stand structure on 113 acres, and improve/maintain forest health and
growth on 1,046 acres. A seed step method will be used to reforest high site areas
understocked on 26 acres and group selection will be used to stimulate growth of aspen
stands on 2 acres. Activity and existing fuels will be treated through piling and
underburning; 400 acres of decadent brushfields will be burned. Approximately one
mile of existing roads will be reconstructed or closed.    [Appeal #98-05-00-0102-A215]
The Forest Service called both decisions fuels reduction projects. However, given the
descriptions above, it is difficult to determine whether the two projects involve the same
types of activities. Whenever possible, we deferred to the Forest Service label of the project
to assign a project type designation. If the Forest Service label was unclear, then we used
our best judgment to assign a project type designation, based on the appeal issues cited and
other background in the records. Most records fall into one of the 24 primary categories
listed in Table 2. Within the 24 primary categories identified, 64 subcategories provide
more detail about the project. For instance, the “Permits” category includes seven subcat-
egories: concessionaire, development, fees, mining, recreation, road-use, and special-use.

Federal Statutes Cited
As seen in Figure 1, if a violation of a federal statute was cited in the appeal, it was then
“checked” in the appeal record. Only federal statutes (and the other regulations shown in
Figure 1) specifically cited by the appellants are included. The list of statutes was not devel-
oped a priori, but rather developed as the appeal files were reviewed. For instance, the Clean
Water Act (CWA) was not added to the list of choices until the first time an appellant cited it
in an appeal letter. The database software allowed us to adapt the form with ease throughout
our initial review of cases. We also included a “Notes” section to capture references to region-
ally specific guidelines, agreements, and Forest Service manuals and handbooks.

Forest Service appeals: the database
Database Analysis
With the database constructed, we then sorted the data along several dimensions in order to
provide an overview of administrative appeals nationwide, within Regions 6 and 3, and for
four National Forests in Arizona: the Apache-Sitgreaves, Coconino, Kaibab, and Prescott.
National Overview
Between January 1, 1997, and September 30, 2002, a total of 3,635 appeals were processed
servicewide. This number includes both reviewed appeals and those dismissed by a Regional
Forester or withdrawn by the appellant.
When sorted by calendar year, the data show the highest number of decisions nation-
ally were made in 1998 (857; see Table 3). Calendar year 1999 had the next highest
number of decisions with 669; 580 appeals were decided in 2000 and 615 were decided
in 2001. Nationally, approximately 42 percent of all administrative appeals within the
database were decided in 1998 and 1999.
Of the 2,694 appeals reviewed nationwide between January 1997 and September 2002,
the appellants’ requested relief was denied in full in 2015 (74.8%) cases and granted in full in
285 cases (10.6%; see Table 4). Of the appeals dismissed, 34 percent (319 of 929) were
dismissed because the decision under appeal was withdrawn by a Forest Service Deciding
Officer. The issues raised by the appellant(s) were resolved informally in approximately 15
percent (139 of 929) of the dismissed cases. Five cases were dismissed because there was no
decision issued by the Forest Service within the legally-mandated period.
We were not able to determine the type of disposition in 12 cases. In these cases, project
descriptions and appeal numbers were included on the Forest website, but the hyperlinks did
not work correctly.

Forest Service appeals: the database
CFR Sections
Seventy-six percent of all appeals (2,763 of 3,635) nationwide were filed under 36 CFR
215 (see Table 5). Approximately 15 percent of appeals (562 of 3,635) were filed under 36
CFR 251, which pertains to decisions regarding special use permits and other authoriza-
tions for occupancy and use of National Forest lands. Five percent of appeals (189 of 3,635)
were filed under 36 CFR 217. The appropriate CFR section was unidentified for 121 cases.
Table 6 shows the number of 215 appeals by Forest Service Region, compared to the
total number of appeals in each Region. Region 6 has the highest proportion of 215 ap-
peals, accounting for 93.6 percent (395 of 422) of all its processed appeals. Over 90 percent
of all appeals processed in Region 9 were filed under 36 CFR 215. 42.6 percent of appeals
(66 of 155) in Region 10 were 215 appeals. Region 1 processed the most 215 appeals—
506—which accounts for 79 percent (506 of 642). Figure 4 provides a comparison of 215
appeals to the total number of appeals processed by each Region.

Appellants
Seven hundred thirty eight different appellants (not including “private citizens”) filed appeals
during the study period. Private citizens filed or joined in the most appeals (1,277 of 3,635,
or 35.1%) during the study period. Of the 1,277 appeals with a private citizen listed as an
appellant, 1,085 (84.9%) were filed independently, i.e., not filed jointly with an organization
or business—56.9 percent of those (618 of 1,085) were filed under 36 CFR 215. When all
appeals filed under 36 CFR 215 are considered, private citizens filed or joined in 28.9 percent
(800 of 2,763). Of all appeals with a private citizen appellant, 62.7 percent were filed under
36 CFR 215 (see Table 7). With the exception of private citizens, the most active appellants
were non-profit environmental organizations.
The Forest Guardians and the Ecology Center filed the most appeals; the Forest Guard-
ians filed 381 appeals, while the Ecology Center filed 236. The 18 most active appellants
nationally (i.e., “private citizens” plus 17 organizations) account for nearly 50 percent of all
appeals filed (including just those filed independently as an individual or an organization).
When we consider the number of appeals joined by one or more appellants, the percentage
grows beyond 50 percent. For example, the Ecology Center filed 29 appeals independently,
but joined with at least one other organization in filing another 207 appeals. The Forest
Guardians filed 294 appeals independently, but joined with at least one other group in
another 87 appeals. With the exception of the Southern Appalachian Biodiversity Project, all
of the most active non-profit organizations filed more than 90 percent of their appeals under
36 CFR 215 (see Table 7).

Project Types
Nearly 33 percent (1,190 of 3,635) of the appeals decided between January 1, 1997, and
September 30, 2002, related to timber sales—either solely or in conjunction with another
type of project (see Table 8). Almost fourteen percent of appeal decisions during this period
were related to grazing allotments. “Restoration” was cited as at least part of the project
objective in 139, or 3.8 percent, of decided appeals. As previously indicated, the project type
could not be determined in 41 of the appeal files, or 1.13 percent.
3   The total does not equal 3,635 (the number of appeals nationwide). This is the result of multiple
appellants filing some appeals jointly. Also, Table 7 does not include a comprehensive list of
appellants nationwide (only the top 18).

Regional Distribution
Comparing Forest Service Regions across the nation, the most appeals were decided in
Region 5 during the study period, with a total of 682 appeals (see Table 9). Region 1
recorded the second most decisions, with a total of 642. Of the nine Forest Service regions,
Regions 1 and 5 were responsible for 36 percent of appeals filed between January 1997 and
September 2002. However, Region 1 actually reviewed the most appeals (564), dismissing
only 78 appeals. Region 5 dismissed the most appeals, with 283 dismissals. The fewest
number of appeals were decided in Region 10 (155), with the next fewest number of cases
decided in Region 8 (215).

Region 6 (Oregon and Washington)
Between January 1, 1997, and September 30, 2002, officials in Region 6 processed 422
administrative appeals (see Table 10). 326 appeals were reviewed, while 96 were either
dismissed by the Forest Service or withdrawn by the appellant(s).
The most appeals—189—were decided in calendar year 1998 (Table 10). In calendar year
1999, 105 appeals were decided. Calendar years 1997, 2000, and 2001 each saw less than 35
appeal decisions. Fifty appeals were decided in Region 6 during the first nine months of
calendar year 2002.

ERI Papers in Restoration Policy
Of the 326 appeals reviewed in Region 6 between January 1997 and September 2002, the
appellants’ requested relief was denied in full in 314 cases and granted in full in eight cases
(see Table 11). Approximately 34 percent (33 of 96) of dismissed appeals were dismissed
as untimely, i.e., the appellant failed to file the appeal within the period allotted by law.
Twenty-nine percent (28 of 96) of the dismissed appeals were dismissed because the decision
under appeal was withdrawn by a Forest Service Deciding Officer.
By far, most appeals decided in Region 6 were during calendar years 1998 and 1999.
Tables 12 and 13 provide an overview of the types of decisions (and reasons for dismissal) for
each of these calendar years. In 1998, the appellants’ requested relief was denied in full in 159
of 163 reviewed cases (see Table 12).
The appellants’ requested relief was denied in all cases reviewed in calendar year 1999 (see
Table 13). Relief was denied in full in 61 of the 62 reviewed appeals. One additional appeal
was denied, although instructions were provided by the Forest Service Deciding Officer to
modify the project under appeal.
CFR Sections
Approximately 93 percent (395 of 422) of all appeals in Region 6 were filed under 36 CFR
215 (see Table 14); nearly six percent (25 of 422) of the appeals in Region 6 were filed under
Part 251. One appeal was filed under 36 CFR 217, and the CFR section was undetermined
in one case.
Table 15 provides an overview of the 215 appeals in Region 6, organized by year of
decision. By far, the most 215 appeals were processed in 1998, with 159 reviews and 22
dismissals. In 2001, 34 appeals filed under part 215 were reviewed, while none were dis-
missed.
Appellants
Eight-one different appellants (not including “private citizens”) filed appeals in Region 6
during the study period (see Table 16). Nearly 76 percent (320 of 422) of the appeals were
filed by single appellants. One hundred two appeals were filed jointly by two or more
organizations, businesses, or individuals. Sixty-nine percent (59 of 85) of appeals listing a

private citizen among the appellants were filed independently (i.e., not joined with an organi-
zation or business). Seventy three of the 85 appeals (85.9%) listing a private citizen among
the appellants were filed under 36 CFR 215.
During the period covered, the Forest Guardians was the only organization to file more
than 100 appeals (either independently or jointly with another organization). After the
Forest Guardians, the Oregon Natural Resources Council was the only organization to file
more than 50 appeals. Including the Forest Guardians and the Oregon Natural Resources
Council, only six organizations filed more than 20 appeals between January 1997 and
September 2002. The other four organizations are Northwest Ecosystem Alliance, North-
west Environmental Defense Center, Cascadia Forest Alliance, and the Sierra Club. With
the exception of the League of Wilderness Defenders and Western Radio Services, all of the
most active appellant organizations in Region 6 filed 100 percent of their appeals under 36
CFR 215 (Table 16).
Project Type
Approximately 52 percent of the appeals decided between January 1997 and September
2002 related to a timber project, whether a sale, salvage, or thinning (see Table 17). Nation-
ally, timber-related projects accounted for nearly 33 percent of all administrative appeals. It
is not surprising that the percentage is much higher in Region 6, given the large amount of
public lands available for timber harvest in the northwestern United States (see Figure 5).
Forty of the 422 regional appeal decisions (9.5%) explicitly mentioned “restoration” as
one of the project objectives. We were unable to determine the project type for 11 cases (see
Figure 3 for an example of an appeal with an “undetermined” project type).
Table 18 further breaks down timber-related appeals by year. The highest percentages
(60.3% and 66.7%) of timber-related appeals correspond with the high numbers of total
appeals filed in calendar years 1998 and 1999. In each of calendar years 1997, 2000, and
2001, more than 30 percent of appeal decisions concerned timber-related projects. During
the first nine months of 2002, only 20 percent of appeal decisions in Region 6 were timber-
related.

Table 19 shows the number of timber-related appeal decisions in Region 6, organized by
National Forest. The Gifford Pinchot National Forest decided the most timber-related
appeals (37) between January 1997 and September 2002, followed by the Willamette
National Forest (31). Ten of the 19 National Forests decided at least 10 timber-related
appeals during the study period. The Fremont National Forest decided the least timber-
related appeals (one). One timber-related appeal was filed jointly with both the Mt. Baker-
Snoqualmie and Mt. Hood National Forests.

By forest in Region 6, the Gifford Pinchot and Willamette National Forests processed
the most appeals (41 and 39, respectively) between January 1, 1997, and September 30,
2002 (see Table 20). The Willamette National Forest reviewed (rather than dismissed) 36 of
its 39 appeals, while the Gifford Pinchot National Forest dismissed more appeals than it
reviewed (22 vs. 19). Both the Deschutes and Siskiyou National Forests reviewed 28 appeals
between January 1997 and September 2002. Three appeals were filed jointly with the
Deschutes, Fremont, and Winema National Forests. One appeal was filed jointly with the
Mt. Hood, Deschutes, Gifford Pinchot, and Ochoco National Forests. Eight of the 19
National Forests in Region 6 decided fewer than 15 appeals during the study period.

Forest Service appeals: the database
Region 3 (Arizona and New Mexico)
Between January 1, 1997, and September 30, 2002, officials in Region 3 decided 497
administrative appeals (see Table 21). Four hundred and eleven appeals were reviewed,
while 86 were either dismissed by the Forest Service or withdrawn by the appellant(s). The
most appeals—143—were decided in calendar year 2000. Calendar years 1997, 1998,
1999, and 2001 each saw less than 100 appeal decisions. Only 26 appeals have been de-
cided in Region 3 during the first nine months of calendar year 2002.

ERI Papers in Restoration Policy
Of the 411 appeals reviewed in Region 3 between January 1997 and September 2002, the
appellants’ requested relief was denied in full in 258 cases and granted in full in 66 cases (see
Table 22). Nearly 28 percent (24 of 86) of dismissed appeals were dismissed because the
decision under appeal was withdrawn by a Forest Service Deciding Officer. Seventeen of the
86 dismissed cases (19.8%) were dismissed as untimely, i.e., the appellant failed to file the
appeal within the period allotted by law.
CFR Sections
Nearly 65 percent (323 of 497) of all appeals in Region 3 were filed under 36 CFR 215
(see Table 23). Approximately 26 percent (132 of 497) of the appeals in Region 3 were filed
under Part 251. Thirty appeals (6%) were filed under 36 CFR 217, and the CFR section
was undetermined in 12 cases (2.4%).
Table 24 provides an overview of the 215 appeals in Region 3, organized by year of
decision. The most 215 appeals were processed in 2000, with 81 reviews and one dismissal.
The fewest 215 appeals (38) during a complete calendar year were decided in 1998. Four-
teen 215 appeals were processed during the first nine months of 2002.

Forest Service appeals: the database
Appellants
Seventy-six different appellants filed appeals in Region 3 during the study period (see Table
25). Nearly 93 percent (461 of 497) of the appeals were filed by single appellants. Thirty-
six appeals were filed jointly by two or more organizations, businesses, or individuals. Of the
188 appeals, 165 (87.7%) listing a private citizen among the appellants were filed indepen-
dently (i.e., not joined with an organization or business). During the period covered, four
organizations filed more than 10 appeals (either independently or jointly with another
organization)—Forest Guardians, the Center for Biological Diversity, Gila Watch, and
Catron County. Nine of the 14 most active organizations and businesses filed 100 percent of
their appeals under 36 CFR 215.
4 The total does not equal 497 (the number of appeals in Region 3). This is the result of multiple
appellants filing some appeals jointly. Also, Table 25 does not include a comprehensive list of
appellants in Region 3 (only the top 15).

ERI Papers in Restoration Policy
Project Type
Approximately 58 percent of the appeals decided between January 1997 and September
2002 related to grazing allotments (see Table 26). Nationally, grazing allotments only
accounted for 13.6 percent of all administrative appeals. It is not surprising that the per-
centage is much higher in Region 3, given the large amount of public lands available for
grazing in the western United States (see Figure 5), and particularly in Southwestern forests.
Of the 291 appeals related to grazing allotments in Region 3, private citizens filed 81 of
them independently and joined with an organization in another 19. The Forest Guardians
filed 108 grazing related appeals, all of them independently.
Fifty-one of the 497 regional appeal decisions (10.3%) concerned a timber-related
project, whether a sale, salvage effort, or thinning project (Table 26). Eight appeal decisions
specifically mentioned “restoration” as one of the project objectives. We were unable to
determine the project type for six cases—five on the Gila National Forest and one on the
Tonto National Forest (see Figure 3 for an example of an “undetermined” project type).

Table 27 further breaks down grazing allotment appeals by year. In each of calendar years
1999, 2000, and 2001, more than 65 percent of appeal decisions concerned grazing allot-
ments. The data show the year 2001 with the highest number of grazing-related appeal
decisions—76.9 percent. In 1997, only 23.3 percent of appeal decisions in Region 3 were
related to grazing.
National Forest Distribution
By forest in Region 3, the majority of appeals (122) were processed by the Gila National
Forest between January 1, 1997, and September 30, 2002 (see Table 28). The Santa Fe
National Forest ranked second in terms of number of appeals decided, with 63 appeals—
nearly 50 percent less than the Gila—decided during the same period. The Lincoln,
Prescott, Kaibab, Cibola, and Carson National Forests each decided fewer than 30 appeals
over the study period.

Forest Service appeals: the database
Northern Arizona Forests
To further break down the data for purposes of analysis (and to assist us in selecting a
smaller set of appeal cases near our home base for subsequent in-depth analysis at the forest
level), we selected four of Arizona’s six national forests, the Apache-Sitgreaves, Coconino,
Kaibab, and Prescott. (The two other Arizona forests, the Tonto near Phoenix, and the
Coronado in southern Arizona, were not included in this analysis.) From this point on,
references to “northern Arizona” refer to these four forests.
Table 29 shows the number of appeals of all project types decided in northern Arizona,
organized by calendar year. Almost 52 percent of all appeals decided in northern Arizona were
decided during calendar years 1998 and 1999. Thirty-eight appeals were decided in 1998.
The most appeals, 41, were decided in 1999. For five years (1997–2001), the northern
Arizona forests decided at least 20 appeals per year among them.
When all project types are considered, nearly two-thirds of appeals (62.1%) in northern
Arizona challenge decisions on the Apache-Sitgreaves and Coconino National Forests (Table
30). Four appeals were filed jointly with the Prescott and Coconino National Forests. The

ERI Papers in Restoration Policy
Prescott National Forest processed 27 appeals from January 1, 1997, through September 30,
2002, and the Kaibab National Forest processed 26 appeals during the same period.
Of the 124 appeals reviewed in northern Arizona between January 1997 and September
2002, the appellants’ requested relief was denied in full in 95 cases and granted in full in seven
cases (see Table 31). Nearly 31 percent (nine of 29) of dismissed appeals were dismissed
because the decision under appeal was withdrawn by a Forest Service Deciding Officer. An
equal number of cases (nine of 29) were dismissed as untimely, i.e., the appellant failed to file
the appeal within the period allotted by law.
CFR Sections
Approximately 70 percent (107 of 153) of all appeals in northern Arizona were filed under
36 CFR 215 (see Table 32). Eighteen percent (28 of 153) of the appeals in northern Ari-
zona were filed under Part 251. Sixteen appeals were filed under 36 CFR 217, and the CFR
section was undetermined in two cases.
Table 33 provides an overview of the 215 appeals in northern Arizona, organized by
year of decision. The most CFR 215 appeals were processed in 1999, with 24 reviews and six
dismissals. During the first nine months of 2002, one 215 appeal was reviewed and one 215
appeal was dismissed.

Forest Service appeals: the database
Appellants
Twenty-five different appellants (not including “private citizens”) filed appeals in northern
Arizona during the study period (see Table 34). Similar to the situation in Region 3 as a
whole, nearly 92 percent (140 of 153) of the appeals were filed by single appellants. Thirteen
appeals were filed jointly by two or more organizations, businesses, or individuals. All of the
51 appeals listing a private citizen as the appellant were filed independently (i.e., not joined
with an organization or business). Among organizations filing in northern Arizona, the Forest
Guardians and Center for Biological Diversity were by far the most active, with 49 and 27
appeals filed respectively. The next highest number filed by an organization was four. With
the exception of “private citizens,” all appellants who filed 215 appeals filed 100 percent of
their appeals under 36 CFR 215. Twelve of the 26 appellants filing in northern Arizona did
not file any appeals under 36 CFR 215.
 Table 35 compares all project types appealed in Region 3 to those appealed in northern
Arizona. We compared the types of projects as well as the number of appeals filed for each
project type. Thirty-one percent (149 of 482) of appeals in Region 3 were filed in northern
Arizona. Nearly 100 percent of timber thinning projects, and 50 percent of timber sales,
appealed in Region 3 were filed in northern Arizona. Given the forested landscape in northern
Arizona compared to the rest of Region 3, these percentages are not surprising (see Figures 5
and 6).

Forest Service appeals: the database
Projects related to grazing, mining, species management, and recreation (30% or less for
each project type) were less prevalent in northern Arizona, compared to Region 3 as a whole.
Nearly 55 percent (28 of 51) of appeals of timber-related projects were filed in Northern
Arizona. This is not surprising given the relationship between forested land in Arizona and
the boundaries of the four forests in northern Arizona (Figure 6).

Forest Service appeals: the database
Subset within Northern Arizona
Because of our particular interest in fuels reduction and ecological restoration projects, we
took an extra step in analyzing the data for the four northern Arizona forests. We eventually
want to examine any projects that might be considered as fuels reduction/forest restoration
projects (or labeled as such by the Forest Service). However, because of the difficulties de-
scribed above in discerning from the online appeal records the exact scope of many projects,
we decided to draw a subset of projects to examine more closely to see if our initial judg-
ments about project classification could be verified. For this first-cut analysis we decided to
include projects listed in the following categories: ecosystem management, fuels reduction,
restoration, prescribed burns, vegetation management, and timber sales, salvage, and thinning.
We did not want to exclude prescribed burning projects that might have had a fuels reduction
or restoration purpose. Nor did we want to exclude timber and salvage sales, not because we
contend they are fuels reduction, but simply to make sure that those are straightforward
issues of timber sales and that the appeals are in no way intertwined with issues of fuels
reduction and restoration. Excluded project types are development, grazing, land exchanges,
mining, permits, plan amendments, recreation, and species management. As a result of this
winnowing down of cases, we were left with 43 appeal decisions to examine more closely.
Forty-two of the 43 appeals were filed under 36 CFR 215; one appeal of a project described
as “ecosystem management” was filed under 36 CFR 251.
When only projects in this subset of categories are examined, the majority of appeals were
decided in 1997, at 17 (see Table 36). The number of appeal decisions decreased each year,
with just two appeals decided in calendar year 2001. Nearly two-thirds (28 of 43) of these
appeals challenged decisions on the Coconino and Kaibab National Forests (see Table 37).
Overall, Forest Service officials reviewed 33 of these appeals and dismissed 10.
Of the 33 cases reviewed by the Forest Service, within our subset of 43, the appellants’
requested relief was denied in full in 25 cases and granted in full in two cases (see Table 38).
Five of the nine dismissed appeals (55.6%) were dismissed because the decision under
appeal was withdrawn by a Forest Service Deciding Officer. Five other cases were dis-
missed—two due to appellants’ lack of standing, two because the appeals were determined
to be untimely, and one because the appeal issues were resolved informally.

Table 39 compares appellants when all project types are considered to when only projects
in the subset of 43 are considered. The Forest Guardians filed the most appeals overall of any
organization, with 49. Private citizens filed 51 appeals—all 51 were filed independently (i.e.,
not jointly with an organization). Only two organizations filed or joined in more than 20
appeals—the Forest Guardians and the Center for Biological Diversity (formerly the South-
west Center for Biological Diversity). The next highest number of appeals filed or joined was
four each by the Forest Conservation Council, the Sierra Club, and the Southwest Forest
Alliance.

The picture changes somewhat when project types limited to the subset are examined. Private
citizens filed just two appeals of these project types (compared to 51 when all project types
are included). The Forest Guardians filed or joined in 14 appeals, or 28.6 percent of all
appeals filed or joined by the Forest Guardians in northern Arizona. Projects in this subset
also account for nearly 93 percent of all appeals filed or joined in by the Center for Biological
Diversity in northern Arizona. Four groups filed or joined in appeals exclusively in this
subset: the Forest Conservation Council, Southwest Forest Alliance, Sierra Club, and Flag-
staff Activist Network. Each of these four organizations participated in fewer than five
appeals in northern Arizona. The high degree of environmental group activity here is not
surprising, given the fact that the subset includes many types of projects that involve timber
management objectives.

Forest Service appeals: the database
Table 40 provides information similar to Table 35, with a more focused look at our subset of
43 projects. These tables show that of the 497 appeals filed in Region 3, 77 of them (15.5%)
were related to project types of particular interest in our subset. Of those 77 appeals, 43
(55.8%) were filed in northern Arizona.
Table 41 provides an overview of all appeals filed in northern Arizona in the subset of
43 projects, based on our initial classification of project type. The highest number of
appeals—10—were filed against timber sale projects. All 10 were reviewed (none were
dismissed or withdrawn). Six appeals challenging ecosystem management projects were
filed, but only one of the six was reviewed. We cannot tell from the online appeal record
whether the ecosystem management projects are directly related to fuels reduction or
restoration. However, there is enough information in the records that we do not feel com-
fortable excluding these projects from our subset at this point. Four of the six ecosystem
management appeals were dismissed by the Prescott National Forest. Forest Guardians filed
two of the six ecosystem management appeals. Thinning and burning projects and restora-
tion projects each had six appeals challenging them; only two of the 12 appeals were dis-
missed or withdrawn. The Forest Guardians, Center for Biological Diversity, and Prescott
National Forest Friends were the only groups who filed appeals independently (with only one
from Prescott National Forest Friends).
Table 41 also shows the only two appeals filed by private citizens challenged ecosystem
management projects on the Prescott National Forest, and both were dismissed. Both of the
appeals challenging projects that were clearly classified as fuels reduction projects by the
Forest Service were filed with the Kaibab National Forest—one by Forest Guardians and
one by the Center for Biological Diversity. The Flagstaff Activist Network appealed only
one restoration project (joined with the National Forest Protection Alliance, Forest Conser-
vation Council, and Forest Guardians).
The Center for Biological Diversity (Center) was the only organization to challenge the
following projects: combined timber sale/fuels reduction, combined timber thinning/forest
health project, combined timber thinning/species management project, and vegetation
management. Six of the 10 timber sale appeals reviewed by the Forest Service involved the
Center; the Center filed four of the six independently. The Forest Guardians filed the other
four timber sale appeals independently. The Center also filed the only two timber salvage
appeals reviewed by the Forest Service (one filed by the Forest Guardians was dismissed).
Four of the five timber thinning appeals involved the Center— three were filed indepen-
dently. The fifth was filed independently by the Forest Guardians. Only one appeal of timber
thinning projects was filed jointly by two appellants.

ERI Papers in Restoration Policy
Conclusion
A full accounting of the current administrative appeals process would begin with some basic
questions: who, what, where, and when. The database we have compiled begins to answer
some of these questions, especially 1) who files appeals, 2) what types of projects are ap-
pealed, 3) where the most appeals are filed, and 4) when most appeals are decided. It is
important to note there really was no easy way to answer these questions prior to construc-
tion of this database.
For instance, what did surprise us is the number of persons who filed administrative
appeals individually (not in conjunction with any identified organization). Individuals filed
35 percent of all appeals nationally, 20 percent in Region 6, and 38 percent in Region 3.
Nationally, a significant percentage (84.9%) of those appeals were not filed in conjunction
with any organization.
In addition, the proposed rule changes to 36 CFR 215 have the potential to affect a
significant percentage of appeals. Nationally, in Regions 6 and 3, and within northern
Arizona, at least 65 percent of all appeals filed were filed under 36 CFR 215. In fact, in
Region 6, 94 percent of all appeals filed were filed under 36 CFR 215. Both nationally and
in Region 6, more than 60 percent of all appeals listing a private citizen among the appel-
lants were filed under 36 CFR 215. In Region 3 and within northern Arizona, more than
40 percent of appeals involving private citizens were filed under 36 CFR 215. One could
surmise from this data that there are significant public interests (and not all of them envi-
ronmental) that are likely to be affected by proposals to change the current appeals process.
With the exception of private citizens, the most active appellants for all project types
nationwide are non-profit environmental organizations. The Forest Guardians are the most
active organized appellant group nationally, regionally and within northern Arizona. In fact,
in Region 6, the Forest Guardians filed more appeals than did private citizens. Based in
Santa Fe, New Mexico, the Forest Guardians focus on the forests of the southwestern
United States, but only 135 of the group’s 381 appeals were filed in Region 3 (Arizona and
New Mexico). This could mean the organization has broadened its geographical reach to
other parts of the country, or that it is filing appeals on behalf of or in conjunction with
other groups outside Region 3. The Ecology Center, based in Missoula, Montana, filed 236
appeals: 204 in Region 1, none in Region 3, and three in Region 6.
Nationally, approximately 42 percent of all administrative appeals were decided in 1998
and 1999. Of the nine Forest Service regions, Regions 1 and 5 were responsible for ap-
proximately 36 percent of appeals filed between January 1997 and September 2002. While
there is a decrease in overall appeal activity (since the high of 857 appeals in 1998), there
could, however, also be an increase in the complexity of the appeal cases being brought
forward, but we would hypothesize that this is not the case. In the discussion over appeals,
concern over a rising number of appeals nationally would not seem to be warranted by the
data.

Forest Service appeals: the database
In terms of the types of decisions made by the Forest Service, the database presents infor-
mation about both reviewed cases and dismissed cases. Nationally, regionally, and in north-
ern Arizona, more than 55 percent of all reviewed appeals were denied in full. In fact, with
the exception of Region 3, at least 75 percent of reviewed cases were denied in full. In
Region 3, 63 percent of all reviewed cases were denied in full. A significantly large number
of cases were dismissed because the decision under appeal was withdrawn by a Forest
Service Deciding Officer. Nationally, in Regions 3 and 6, and in northern Arizona, at least
28 percent of dismissed appeals fell within this category. This relationship merits further
examination. Likewise, further examination is needed of the reasons why appeals were
granted, and how the granted appeals affected the projects’ eventual implementation.
The database has also provided some evidence of the types of projects being appealed.
As could be expected, our analysis of northern Arizona forests shows projects that poten-
tially involve the cutting of trees appear to be a lightning rod for environmental groups.
Recall also, however, that for Region 3 nearly 59 percent of the appeals decided during the
study period related to grazing permits, compared to nearly 14 percent nationwide. While
the Forest Guardians did file approximately 37 percent of these, another 34 percent of the
grazing appeals involved private individuals. We would hypothesize that further investiga-
tion would reveal most of the grazing allotment appeals involving individuals challenged
agency decisions adverse to individual grazing permittees.
However, preliminary examination of project types has also led to more questions about
how the Forest Service designates and defines activities within a project. For example, is
there a consistent suite of activities included in all “fuels reduction” projects across Forest
Service Regions or Forests? As the Forest Trust pointed out in its critique of the Forest
Service’s report on mechanical fuels treatment, the agency “lacks a consistent system for
tracking and analyzing its projects” (Morton and McCarthy 2002). Since appeals have long
been such a controversial element in Forest Service planning and management, it is surpris-
ing that the agency has not developed a better record-keeping system. This lack of consis-
tency in reporting project types makes it difficult to discern the appeal issue from some of
the records posted on the website. Inconsistencies in definition also limit the ability of non-
Forest Service researchers to replicate agency results and the conclusions drawn from them.
While we found some projects relatively easy to classify, e.g., grazing allotment, mining
and special-use permit decisions, we found the task of identifying fuels reduction/forest
restoration projects more problematic. It is difficult to have complete confidence in the
determination of what projects might actually be related to fuels reduction and/or forest
restoration, given the intertwining of timber sales, thinning, and prescribed burning, and
restoration and fuels reduction projects into the overall fuels reduction/restoration debate.
After constructing the database, we could see why, for example, Forest Service personnel
encounter difficulties when asked to provide hard, numeric data specific to “fuels reduc-
tion” or “mechanical treatment” projects. Because of the difficulties in discerning project
type from the agency’s online records, we therefore decided that we would need to make a
closer examination of project case files. For northern Arizona, we identified 43 projects for
further study. Not all of these projects ultimately will fall into the category of fuels reduc-
tion or restoration. Controversy surrounds the Forest Service’s own reports about whether

53
ERI Papers in Restoration Policy
projects can be considered fuels reduction. The agency has been accused of counting
commercial timber sales as fuels reduction projects, which, environmental groups argue, is
then used to inflate the number of fuels reduction projects the agency can claim are ap-
pealed. Thus, we again caution against using our subset of 43 projects as generalizations
about fuels reduction/restoration projects. What we can and do say about this subset is only
about the subset. Because many of the projects in this subset (thinning, salvage, timber
sales) involve the cutting of trees, a high level of environmental group participation could
be anticipated.
Another question the database has not been able to answer at this point includes how
long an appeal takes from filing to decision. Policy makers and Forest Service officials have
used this issue repeatedly as justification for changes in the NEPA appeals process. The
Forest Service has argued that “administrative appeals and litigation contribute significantly
to the time it takes to plan for and decide on fuels projects prior to implementation”
(USDA Forest Service 2002a, p. 4). However, no data have been made available from the
Forest Service to indicate just how long these delays are, and it is impossible to answer this
question based on the data posted on the agency’s website. Examination of primary source
records to determine the time spans between initial filing and appeal decisions, as well as
the actual number of projects with fuels reduction/forest restoration objectives (as opposed
to the recollections of individual regional and forest personnel) is the only way to make this
determination. This data will be collected as case studies are done during subsequent phases
of the project.
In addition, it can be argued that fear of appeal also prolongs the analysis and pre-
decision process and that this must also be considered. But this cuts both ways. It may
indeed prolong the process, as many people feel that a contributing factor to the painfully
slow process of document preparation (“bullet-proofing”) is the fear of appeals and lawsuits.
However, as has been argued elsewhere (Culhane 1981; Jones and Taylor 1995), this fear
can also prompt the agency to build a stronger scientific justification for its decision and to
be more sensitive to public objections to proposed projects. Obviously, the interplay of
these factors is an exploration that goes beyond information contained in the database. This
point is certainly an important and valid line of future inquiry.
Finally, as we stated at the outset, construction of the database alone does not allow any
definitive conclusions to be made about the outcomes and impacts of appeals either ecologi-
cally, economically, socially, or politically. Such determinations will require further analysis,
including a systematic examination of a representative sample of cases. Only then can
questions about how appeals contribute to action or inaction on Forest Service lands, and
with what consequences and for whom, be addressed more fully. Factors other than appeals,
for example, may also contribute to project delay, such as slow or poor preparation of
NEPA documentation, the reallocation of personnel during fire seasons from document
preparation to fire fighting, or insufficient  funding. To tell a more complete story about
contributions of appeals to project outcomes and delays will require a much more detailed
assessment of appeals records, project descriptions, and participants in the administrative
appeals process.
