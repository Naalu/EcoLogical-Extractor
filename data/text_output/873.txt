ABSTRACT 
 
POPULATION ECOLOGY OF FENDLER CEANOTHUS: RESPONSES TO 
HERBIVORY AND FOREST RESTORATION TREATMENTS 
 
DAVID W. HUFFMAN 
 
 
To understand responses of Fendler ceanothus to forest restoration treatments and 
large ungulate herbivory, I focused research on four areas: 1) effects of large ungulate 
herbivores on Fendler ceanothus stem size, morphology, and flower production, 2) 
production, fate, and germination of Fendler ceanothus seeds, 3) importance of overstory 
density, ungulate herbivory, prescribed fire, and drought for Fendler ceanothus growth 
and regeneration, and 4) simulation of population dynamics under various management 
scenarios. 
 
After two seasons (1999, 2000), plants protected from large ungulate herbivores 
were larger and produced greater biomass, leaf area, and flowering stems than plants that 
were not protected.  These results showed that large herbivores such as mule deer 
(Odocoileus hemionus) and Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus) constrained growth 
and reproduction of Fendler ceanothus in thinned forest units. 
 
Fendler ceanothus stems that were not protected from large herbivores did not 
produce fruit over the four-year study (1999-2002).  Seed production (2000-2001) was 
affected by stem size and probably drought.  Predispersal seed parasites and post-
dispersal predators were important sources of ovule loss.  Seed germination after 

 
iii
exposure to 90ºC (10-minute duration) was greater than without heat treatment.  These 
results increase our understanding of Fendler ceanothus seed production and losses. 
 
 
Stand density index (SDI) and browsing by ungulates were negatively related to 
Fendler ceanothus growth.  Prediction of growth from SDI and browsing was poor in 
years of drought.  Plant mortality was positively related to depth of forest floor consumed 
in experimental burning.  Fendler ceanothus seedlings emerged on burned plots but not 
on unburned plots.  These results indicate that overstory tree thinning and prescribed fire 
can increase growth and reproduction of Fendler ceanothus but responses are constrained 
by herbivory and drought. 
 
Simulation of Fendler ceanothus population dynamics suggested that restoration 
treatments and herbivory interact to affect long-term persistence and population structure.  
Populations that did not experience fire were generally dominated by dormant seeds 
whereas burned populations had relatively even life stage structures at the end of the 25-
year simulation.  Frequent fire (2-5 yr) stimulated growth of protected populations but 
negatively affected populations exposed to intense herbivory.

PREFACE 
 
The following dissertation was written in journal format and main chapters were 
meant as stand-alone manuscripts for publication.  For this reason, there are some 
redundancies among chapters, particularly in Methods sections where the study area and 
experimental designs are described.  I have attempted to reduce these redundancies in 
later chapters by referencing the earlier ones.   
For all the studies presented, I received generous help from my major professor, 
Dr. Margaret Moore, as well as, students, staff, and faculty in the Ecological Restoration 
Institute and School of Forestry at Northern Arizona University.  I have used a first-
person, active voice throughout this dissertation with no intention of ignoring this much 
appreciated assistance.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 
 
“One for the rook, one for the crow, one to rot, and one to grow” 
 
The research presented in this dissertation was conducted within a larger 
experiment designed to study ecological restoration of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa 
Laws.) forests of northern Arizona.  Ecological restoration is defined as, “the process of 
assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed” 
(SER 2002).  Whether or not an ecosystem has been degraded or damaged, and therefore 
is in need of restoration, is determined through analysis of present conditions and 
comparison with the system’s historical range of natural variation (Landres et al. 1999, 
Moore et al. 1999, Allen et al. 2002).  In ponderosa pine ecosystems of northern Arizona, 
historical range of natural variation for overstory structure has been described as open 
stands of mainly ponderosa pine and Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt.) with densities 
of 7-116 trees per hectare (Covington and Moore 1994a) distributed in scattered, uneven-
aged groups (White 1985, Mast et al. 1999).  Fire was a dominant disturbance process in 
the evolutionary environment of species in these forests and burned through fine fuels of 
herbaceous and shrubby understories at intervals of 3-6 years (Fulé et al. 1997).  
Surprisingly, very few details are available concerning predegradation composition or 
structure of understory plant communities in this area.  These communities, however, are 
thought to have been much more diverse and productive than they are today (Covington 
and Moore 1994b, Covington et al. 1997). 
Degradation of ponderosa pine ecosystems in northern Arizona began with the 
onset of Euro-American settlement around 1870 and industrial exploitation of forest 

 
3
resources (Cooper 1960, Covington and Moore 1994b, Kolb et al. 1994, Covington et al. 
1997, Allen et al. 2002).  Dense forest overstories developing from these land use 
practices create critical problems with respect to biological diversity and an increased risk 
of large, stand-replacing, crown fires.  Forest restoration treatments presently underway 
in ponderosa pine forests are aimed at reestablishing more natural overstory density and 
spatial patterns, increasing native plant diversity and productivity, and assisting 
successional trajectories (Covington et al. 1997, Allen et al. 2002, SER 2002).  The most 
basic of these treatments include thinning of young, small-diameter trees and application 
of surface fire.   
Monitoring protocols and adaptive feedback mechanisms are critical in any 
effective land management practice (Walters and Holling 1990).  Restoration ecology 
provides restoration programs with theoretical frameworks, practical tools, and 
methodologies for implementing and monitoring activities (SER 2002).  Restoration 
science is conducted at various levels of biological organization and spatial and temporal 
scales.  It can focus on ecosystem structure, process, or function.  Ideally, restoration 
programs should make use of a diverse array of studies at various scales to gain the most 
complete understanding of ecosystem recovery.  
This dissertation presents four ecological studies of the shrub, Fendler ceanothus 
(Ceanothus fendleri Gray: Rhamnaceae), which is common in ponderosa pine forests of 
western North America from Mexico to South Dakota (Conard et al. 1985).  The four 
studies focus on autecological and population responses to forest restoration treatments. 
Autecological and population research can provide insight into patterns of ecosystem 
development and dynamics (Whittaker 1975, Harper 1977).  For example, research at this 

 
4
scale of biological organization can reveal species’ life history traits and mechanisms for 
persistence, population dynamics and constraints to population growth, morphological 
responses to changing environmental conditions, and trophic interactions important in 
food web dynamics. By providing this type of information, population-level studies can 
link to broader scales of investigation such as community ecology (Montalvo 1997).  
These studies are central to monitoring programs and evaluation of ecological restoration 
projects (Clewell and Rieger 1997, Montalvo et al. 1997).   Further, it should be noted 
that ecological restoration projects, in turn, provide experiments within which to test 
hypotheses and theoretical models.  
Fendler’s ceanothus was selected for study due to its importance and uniqueness 
in ponderosa pine forests as well as its heuristic potential.  Few studies of this species 
have been conducted (but see Vose and White 1987 and 1991) although the importance 
of this genus in other western ecosystems is widely recognized (Conard et al. 1985).  
Overall study of Fendler ceanothus provides basic information regarding its growth 
characteristics and strategies for regeneration and persistence.  Further, detailed 
examination of this species provides information regarding the nature and magnitude of 
constraints to understory development after forest restoration treatments.  Central 
objectives in this research were: 1) quantify growth potential and constraints imposed by 
large herbivores after restoration thinning; 2) quantify and describe seed production and 
fate of seeds in restoration treatment units; 3) compare regeneration and growth of plants 
under restoration thinning and prescribed fire treatments; and 4) model population 
dynamics and compare restoration management scenarios in terms of population 
abundance and structure.   

 
5
The four studies presented in this dissertation correspond to these objectives, 
respectively.  Chapter two quantifies the impacts of large herbivores on Fendler 
ceanothus growth and potential reproduction.  Chapter three quantifies seed production 
and describes losses from development through dispersal.  Chapter four describes growth 
across a gradient of overstory density and demographic responses to prescribed fire.  
Chapter five reports results from 25-year simulation modeling of populations under a set 
of restoration management alternatives.  Finally, Chapter six summarizes some important 
results from the preceding chapters and explores questions in need of future research.

CHAPTER 2: UNGULATE HERBIVORY ON FENDLER CEANOTHUS IN AN 
ARIZONA PONDEROSA PINE FOREST 
 
Abstract 
 
Monitoring processes that affect plant population dynamics and community 
structure is central in forest restoration ecology.  To study effects of mule deer 
(Odocoileus hemionus) and elk (Cervus elaphus) on Fendler ceanothus (Ceanothus 
fendleri Gray), I built 90 exclosures in 3 ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) forest 
restoration management units and compared vegetative and flowering characteristics with 
unprotected plots for 2 years.  On unprotected plots, 69% of current-year branches were 
browsed the first year and 44% were browsed the second year; 2-3% of stems on 
protected plots had terminal buds removed, apparently by invertebrates, over the two 
years, respectively.  There was no difference in number of aerial stems or current-year 
branches between protected and unprotected plots in the first year, yet stems on protected 
plots were longer (24.1 cm; p<0.01) and retained more than 4 times the current-year 
biomass (1.4 g stem-1; p<0.01) than stems on unprotected plots (12.9 cm and 0.3 g stem-1, 
respectively).  Stem number, length and diameter, number of current-year branches, and 
current-year biomass on protected plots were all greater (p<0.01) than on unprotected 
plots in the second year.  Stems on protected plots had significantly higher (p<0.01) 
length-diameter ratios and had fewer (p<0.05) current-year branches per unit length than 
unprotected stems.  Flowering stems were found on significantly (p<0.05) more protected 
plots (55%) than unprotected plots (8%) in the second year.  Ungulate herbivory is an

important constraint to early understory development and restoration of Fendler 
ceanothus in this Southwest ponderosa pine forest. 
 
Introduction 
 
It is widely recognized that large mammalian herbivores, through selective 
grazing and site disturbance, often play key roles in ecosystems and affect community 
composition, structure, and development as well as various ecological processes 
(Anderson and Loucks 1979, Naiman 1988, Augustine and McNaughton 1998).  Under 
episodic or light herbivory, browsed plants may compensate for tissue loss by increasing 
production of biomass or reproductive structures (Paige and Whitham 1987, Rosenthal 
and Kotanen 1994, Augustine and McNaughton 1998, Throop and Fay 1999). Intense 
herbivory can lead to decreased stature and reproductive output, regeneration failure, and 
population decline (Strohmeyer and Maschinski 1996, Kay 1997, Augustine and Frelich 
1998, Augustine and McNaughton 1998, Suzuki et al. 1999, Opperman and Merenlender 
2000).  Through direct competition with other herbivores and indirect effects such as 
changes in plant phenological characteristics or site modification, large herbivores can 
affect population dynamics and distribution of other members of the food web (Baines et 
al. 1994, Rooney 2001, Stewart 2001).  The array of potential ecosystem-level 
consequences makes assessment and monitoring of herbivore impacts particularly 
important for ecological restoration programs and forest management in general.   
 
An extraordinary increase in tree density over the last century has led to critical 
conservation problems in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) ecosystems of the 
southwestern United States (Arnold 1950, Covington and Moore 1994a, 1994b, Kolb et 

 
10
al. 1994, Biondi 1996, Savage et al. 1996, Fulé et al. 1997, Mast et al. 1999).   Among 
other effects, dense forest conditions have reduced forage abundance and habitat quality 
for wildlife that rely on understory vegetation (Covington and Moore 1994a).  In concert 
with forest structural changes, Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsonii) were 
introduced to the region in the early 1900s to replace the extirpated Merriam’s elk (C. e. 
merriami).  Numbers of elk have increased over the last 100 years to around 30,000 
animals in Arizona and 40,000-50,000 animals in New Mexico (Truett 1996).  Although 
restoration treatments such as thinning small diameter trees and reintroducing low-
intensity surface fires have been suggested to restore ecological structure and function to 
these forests (Kolb et al. 1994, Covington et al. 1997, Moore et al. 1999), research on the 
impacts of herbivory on plant species’ response to restoration thinning is presently 
lacking. 
 
  Fendler ceanothus (Ceanothus fendleri Gray), is a semi-evergreen, nitrogen-
fixing shrub common in ponderosa pine forest understories of the Southwest (Story 1974, 
Conard et al. 1985).  As a shrub species in primarily herbaceous understory communities, 
Fendler ceanothus can provide structural heterogeneity and enhance ecological diversity.  
Although Fendler ceanothus has been reported as an important browse plant for mule 
deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and other animals including elk consume its leaves, stems, 
fruit, and seeds (Urness et al. 1975, Epple 1995, Allen 1996, Huffman 2002), effects of 
herbivory on Fendler ceanothus growth and reproduction have not been studied.  
Information concerning intensity of wild ungulate herbivory and its effects on important 
understory species can help land managers interpret trends in community development 
and better understand processes constraining restoration of ecosystems.   My objectives 

 
11
in this study were to: 1) quantify the effects of large ungulate herbivory on Fendler 
ceanothus vegetative characteristics such as size, production, and morphology; and 2) 
examine herbivory effects on Fendler ceanothus potential reproduction.   
 
Methods 
Study Site 
 
I conducted my study from 1999-2000 on the Fort Valley Experimental Forest 
(35° 16' N, 111° 41' W) in Coconino County approximately 10 km northwest of Flagstaff, 
Arizona.  The area receives around 52 cm of precipitation annually with a distinct dry 
period in May and June.  Precipitation falls in late summer as rain from monsoonal 
thunderstorms and in winter as snow.  The study area was located from 2225 to 2380 m 
above mean sea level.  Aspect was generally southern and the topography was gentle 
with average slopes of approximately 5-10%.  Soils are classified as Brolliar clay loams 
(fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Argiustolls) developed on tertiary basalt parent material and 
are moderately well drained (Covington et al. 1997).   
 
Overstory vegetation was nearly pure ponderosa pine less than 120-years-old with 
scattered old-growth trees.  Common understory species included the grasses Arizona 
fescue (Festuca arizonica Vasey), mountain muhly (Muhlenbergia montana (Nutt.) A.S. 
Hitchc.), bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus elymoides (Raf.) Swezey) and pine dropseed 
(Blepharoneuron tricholepis (Torr.) Nash); forbs such as lupine (Lupinus spp.), fleabane 
(Erigeron spp.), buckwheat (Eriogonum spp.), yarrow (Achillea millifolium L.), and 
pussytoes (Antennaria spp.); and shrubs Fendler ceanothus and woods rose (Rosa woodsii 

 
12
Lindl.).  Large mammalian herbivores present on the site included mule deer and elk.  
Cattle were excluded from the study site.  
 
Experimental Design  
 
In late winter 1998, tree thinning was initiated on the study site in forest units of 
14-16 hectares each.  Thinning reduced tree density by about 80%.  Trees retained in 
thinning included large (≥41 cm at breast height) and old (> about 130 years) trees, as 
well as, smaller, younger trees that were left to replace evidence of presettlement trees 
such as dead and downed logs, snags, and stumps (see Fulé et al. 2001 for restoration 
guidelines).  Residual tree densities in forest units varied with presettlement forest 
structure (live trees plus dead evidence) and number of trees left as presettlement 
evidence replacement.  I selected three of these forest units for my study and each 
represented a different rate of presettlement replacement (1.5-6 replacement trees per 
evidence; see Fulé 2001).  Across the three selected units, overstory density was 
approximately 111-210 trees per hectare.  Units were separated by at least one kilometer.    
 
In early spring 1999, I located 60 Fendler ceanothus clonal assemblages in each of 
the three units (180 total).  Circular plots, 1 m2, were established around one or more 
existing stems and contained 1-25 Fendler ceanothus stems.  Fendler ceanothus can 
expand vegetatively (Vose and White 1987) and sprouting occurs from belowground 
branches and a pronounced root crown (Huffman pers. obs.).  Thus, it is not known how 
many clones produced the aerial stems I sampled.  Selected stem assemblages were 
spatially discrete and generally covered an area less than 2 m2.  Hereafter, I refer to stem 

 
13
assemblages within plots as “plants.”  Stems on plots were counted, average stem height 
was estimated, and notes were collected regarding signs of previous herbivory. 
 
Herbivore protection treatment (exclosure) was randomized assigned to plots 
within each unit.Herbivore exclosures 4 m2 in area and 1.4 m in height were constructed 
around plots receiving the protection treatment.  Mesh size used for fencing exclosures 
was 5 x 10 cm.  This allowed entry of small mammalian and invertebrate herbivores but 
excluded large ungulates.   
 
In each of the 2 study years, I collected data on flower production and vegetative 
characteristics.  In June of each year, I examined stems in all plots for production of 
inflorescences. For stems producing flowers or flower buds, I measured total stem length 
and basal diameter.  I also counted number of inflorescences on flowering stems.  In 
September, measurements collected for flowering stems were taken for all stems on the 
plots.  I classified stems into 4 relative age groups according to stem base characteristics 
as follows: Class-1) first-year stems, not suberized, generally supple, gray-green 
pubescence at stem base; Class-2) bright green, not suberized, previous year’s growth of 
lateral branches present, generally lacked pubescence; Class-3) similar to Class-2 with 
bark developing in patches at stem base; Class-4) stem bases dark brown to black, fully 
suberized, bark often furrowed.  Although Fendler ceanothus plants monitored on long-
term plots at other sites appear to follow a similar developmental sequence (Moore pers. 
obs.), I was not able to confirm actual stem ages through ring counts or meristem scars.    
Additionally, number of current-year branches, average length of current-year branches, 
and longest current-year branch were measured.   

 
14
 
For all stems, biomass and leaf area (LA) of current-year branches were estimated 
using predictive relationships developed from separate sampling in the study units.  
Forty-five to 50 current-year stems were collected from clonal assemblages outside the 
experimental plots.  For biomass determination, length of current-year stems (n = 50) was 
measured, oven-dried (70° C for 48 h), and weighed to the nearest 0.01 g.  For LA 
determination, length of current-year stems (n = 45) was measured, leaves were removed, 
and projected leaf area for each stem was measured using a video projection system 
(AgVision, Ankeny, IA).  The equation to predict current-branch biomass was: Ln 
Biomass = -4.919 + 1.395(Ln Branch Length) (r2=0.94, p<0.001) (Fig. 2.1a).  The 
equation to predict current-branch LA was: Ln LA = 0.663 + 0.827(Ln Branch Length) 
(r2=0.91, p<0.001) (Fig. 2.1b).  
 
Data Analyses 
 
One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for effects of 
protection on vegetative characteristics of Fendler ceanothus plants within study years 
(1999 and 2000).  Overstory unit was included in the ANOVA model as a blocking 
factor.  Paired t-tests were used to test (p<0.10) between-year differences in vegetative 
parameters within treatment (protected and unprotected) groups.  Data for individual 
stems (i.e., length, number of current-year branches, length of current-year branches, 
biomass and leaf area per stem) were averaged at the plot level and analyses were 
performed on these values.  Additionally, stem diameter, current year biomass, and 
current-year leaf area were summed at the plot level prior to analysis.  Two 
morphological characteristics, “branchiness” and stem height-diameter ratio, were also 

 
15
compared between treatments with ANOVA.  Branchiness was calculated as the number 
of current-year branches divided by stem length.  Data met distribution and variance 
assumptions for ANOVA tests and were not transformed.  In April 2000, 24 of the plots 
were burned as part of another experiment.  These plots were excluded from analysis in 
year 2000.   
 
A Mantel-Haenszel test was used to compare (p<0.05) proportions of unprotected 
and protected plots with flower-producing stems.  Mann-Whitney nonparametric tests 
were used to compare (p<0.05) differences in number of stems and current-branches 
between treatments.     
 
Results 
Plant Size and Current-Year Biomass 
 
Analysis of pretreatment data indicated no difference in stem length or number of 
stems between treatments.  Stem height averaged 7.6 cm (SE=0.30) and number of stems 
per plot averaged 4.9 (SE=0.31) in May, 1999, before exclosures were erected.   
 
By the end of the first growing season (September, 1999) after treatment, 69% of 
the current-year branches on unprotected plots had been browsed.  Two percent of the 
new branches inside exclosures had terminal buds removed, apparently by invertebrates.  
I did not observe signs of small rodent herbivory inside exclosures although mesh size 
permitted rodent access.  Herbivory on unprotected plants appeared consistent with 
browsing from large ungulates; current-year branches were nipped roughly, often near 
their bases, and I did not find discarded shoots or leaves that might suggest herbivory by 
rodents (Bullock 1991, Balgooyen and Waller 1995).  In addition, deer and elk were 

 
16
frequently observed on the study site and their tracks and scat were noted near 
experimental plots.   
 
One growing season after installing the herbivore exclosures, plant size was 
significantly different between protected and unprotected treatments.  Lengths of stems 
and current-year branches of protected plants were from 1.9 to 2.8-fold greater than those 
of unprotected plants (Table 2.1).  Average stem diameter was also greater for protected 
plants than unprotected plants.  Differences in current-year branch lengths between 
protected and unprotected plots translated directly to differences in biomass and leaf area 
(Table 2.1).  Individual stems on protected plots had more current-year biomass by a 
factor of 4.7, and leaf area by a factor of 2.5, compared to stems on unprotected plots.  
No difference was found in average number of stems on plots or the number of new 
branches produced by stems on protected and unprotected plots in 1999.  All stems 
produced an average of 5.3 (SE=0.2) new branches during the first growing season.       
 
In 2000, growing season precipitation (20.4 cm; March-September) was about 
66% of the 91-year average (31.0 cm; Western Regional Climate Center 2000) and both 
protected and unprotected Fendler ceanothus plants showed varying degrees of stem 
dieback.  In September 2000, 44% of current-year branches had been browsed on 
unprotected plots whereas terminal buds had been removed on 3% of the protected stems.  
Average total stem length on protected plots increased (p=0.05) slightly from the 
previous year and was significantly greater than that of unprotected plots, which 
decreased (p=0.06) (Table 2.1).  Similarly, average stem diameter was greater on 
protected plots than unprotected plots.  Although current-year branch lengths on both 
protected and unprotected plots decreased (p<0.001 for both treatments) in 2000 from 

 
17
1999, number of current-year branches increased (p<0.001 and p=0.003 for protected and 
unprotected plots, respectively).  Average number of current-year branches produced by 
stems on protected plots nearly tripled in 2000 from 1999 and was significantly greater 
than the number produced by stems on unprotected plots (Table 2.1).  Both average 
length and length of the longest current-year branch were greater on protected plots than 
unprotected plots by a factor of 2 or greater.  Individual stems on protected plots 
comprised significantly more current-year biomass than stems on unprotected plots by a 
factor of 8 (Table 2.1).  Large differences also existed between protected and unprotected 
stems for current-year leaf area.   
 
Average number of stems did not change significantly (p=0.31) from 1999 to 
2000 on protected plots, but decreased on unprotected plots (p=0.002).  More stems of 
larger average diameter led to significantly greater sum stem diameter (sum of all stems 
on a plot) on protected than unprotected plots in 2000 (Table 2.1).  Similarly, sum 
current-year biomass on protected plots in 2000 did not change from 1999 (p=0.81), 
whereas biomass decreased significantly (p<0.001) on unprotected plots.   In 2000, 
current-year biomass summed on protected plots was greater than that on unprotected 
plots by a factor of 12 (Table 2.1).  Similar patterns existed between protected and 
unprotected plots for sum current-year leaf area (Table 2.1).  Sum leaf area significantly 
increased (p=0.014) from 1999 to 2000 on protected plots but decreased (p<0.001) on 
unprotected plots.

Stem Morphology 
 
Herbivory of current-year branches on Fendler ceanothus stems led to noticeable 
differences in stem morphology.  Stem height-diameter ratio was significantly greater for 
plants on protected plots than for plants on unprotected plots (Table 2.2).  Stems within 
herbivore exclosures typically appeared long and drooping whereas stems exposed to 
herbivores were most often short and stubby in appearance.  Although protected plants 
produced more current-year branches than unprotected plants in 2000, the number of 
branches relative to stem length was significantly greater for stems on unprotected plants 
in both 1999 and 2000 (Table 2.2).   
 
Flower Production 
 
In June 1999, three months after exclosures were established, no difference in 
flower production was found between protected and unprotected Fendler ceanothus plots.  
Stems produced flowers on just 2 of 180 total plots (1.1% overall). 
 
In June 2000, flowering stems were found in a significantly greater proportion of 
protected plots (55%) than unprotected plots (8%).  On average, 22% (SE=3.6) of stems 
on protected plots produced flowers whereas 0.8% (SE=0.4) of stems produced flowers 
on unprotected plots.  In protected plots, up to 11 (maximum) stems produced flowers 
whereas no more than 1 stem flowered in any unprotected plot. 
 
Stems that produced flowers tended to be the larger and apparently older stems on 
plots (Fig. 2.2).  No stems under 20 cm in length produced flowers and 85% of the 
flowering stems were greater than 30 cm in length.  Similarly, 82% of the flowering 
stems were greater than 4 mm in diameter.  No current-year stems flowered and more 

 
19
than 90% of the flowering stems had suberized bases (age classes 3 and 4).  The mean 
number of inflorescences (panicles) produced per flowering stem was 7.3.  Inflorescences 
were comprised of many individual flowers although these were not counted.  An average 
of 2 branches per stem flowered; the maximum number of flowering branches was 9 per 
stem.   
 
Discussion 
 
Mule deer and Rocky Mountain elk appeared to be the primary large herbivores 
of Fendler ceanothus and caused significant reduction of current-year biomass in both 
study years.  Plants that were not protected from large herbivores had small, branchy 
stems, decreased aerial stem survival, and limited flowering compared with protected 
plants.  Reduced flowering and stem survival could in turn lead to declines in local 
Fendler ceanothus abundance, affect community successional dynamics, and have 
indirect effects on other ecosystem components (Baines et al. 1994, Augustine and 
Frelich 1998).  It is clear that herbivory by deer and elk is limiting development of 
understory structural diversity by constraining Fendler ceanothus growth and flower 
production.  I did not examine interactions of herbivory and low-intensity fire, although 
prescribed burning is an important component of Southwest ponderosa pine restoration 
programs (Covington et al. 1997).  Fire often leads to increases in vegetative and sexual 
regeneration through sprout production and seed germination, however, it can also 
increase palatability of plant tissues and create conditions that attract herbivores (Whelan 
1995).  My results indicate that deer and elk herbivory after forest thinning should be 
considered an important constraint to the ecological restoration of these ecosystems. 
 

 
20
 
Intensity of deer and elk herbivory on Fendler ceanothus and other species varies 
with season, site conditions, and ungulate population characteristics (Reynolds 1964, 
Patton 1974, Urness et al. 1975, Furniss et al. 1978, Allen 1996, Throop and Fay 1999).  
For example, Urness et al. (1975) found that Fendler ceanothus comprised up to 6.9% of 
mule deer summer diet and was a consistently important browse species throughout the 
year at Beaver Creek, a site located around 55 km south of ours.  Other woody species 
preferred by mule deer at Beaver Creek were Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt.), 
mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus breviflorus Gray), and Utah serviceberry 
(Amelanchier utahensis Koehne).  These species are not commonly found on my study 
site and thus preference for Fendler ceanothus may be greater at Fort Valley than reported 
by Urness et al. (1975).  Allen (1996) noted severe browsing of Fendler ceanothus 15 
years after an extensive wildfire in New Mexico and related intensity of herbivory to a 
dramatic elk population increase.  Patton (1974) found that mule deer use increased in 
ponderosa pine forests after overstory thinning.  Thus, in my study, deer and elk may 
have been attracted to the open conditions created by forest thinning treatments.   
 
Levels of herbivory that stimulate flower production or enhance plant growth may 
positively contribute to ecological restoration goals by increasing plant resources for 
various organisms in the food web (Jackson et al. 1995).  Paige and Whitham (1987) 
reported increased flower production after experimental clipping as well as natural 
herbivory by deer and elk for a northern Arizona forb, scarlet gilia (Ipomopsis aggregata 
(Pursh) V. Grant).  Similarly, Throop and Fay (1999) found that browsed New Jersey tea 
(Ceanothus herbaceous Raf. var. pubescens (T. & G.) Shinners) produced a greater 
number of inflorescences than unbrowsed plants on a tallgrass prairie site.  In contrast, by 

 
21
reducing plant biomass, production of reproductive structures, and fitness, intense 
herbivory may be a constraint to ecosystem restoration.  Stein et al. (1992) noted that elk 
completely consumed arroyo willow (Salix lasiolepis Benth.) resprouts after experimental 
burning in northern Arizona.  Similarly, Strohmeyer and Maschinski (1996) reported both 
wild and domestic herbivores reduced total shoot length and number of branches of 
Arizona willow (Salix arizonica Dorn).   Intense herbivory by deer and elk is known to 
limit production of flowers, seeds, and vegetative regeneration of various plant species in 
other western ecosystems (DeByle 1985, Dunlap 1988, Mitchell and Freeman 1993, 
Hoffman and Wambolt 1996, Kay 1997, Opperman and Merenlender 2000).  In my 
study, Fendler ceanothus flowers were observed on less than 10% of the unprotected 
plots.  Low flower production may affect populations of species, such as Eurytoma 
squamosa Bugbee (Hymenoptera) that feed on seeds of Fendler ceanothus (Huffman 
2002).  This suggests that ungulate herbivory may affect diversity and composition of 
invertebrate communities through direct competition and/or indirect effects (e.g., reduced 
production of seeds, alteration of microsite characteristics, etc.) (Baines et al. 1994, 
Rambo and Faeth 1999, Rooney 2001, Stewart 2001).   
   
Further research is needed to explore the roles of wild ungulate herbivory in 
conservation and ecological restoration of Southwest ponderosa pine ecosystems.  
Current understanding of presettlement conditions – attributes that provide baselines to 
guide ecological restoration – is greatest for overstory characteristics and fire regimes 
(Covington and Moore 1994a, Covington et al. 1997, Fulé et al. 1997, Mast et al. 1999). 
Little is known regarding presettlement understory composition and diversity (but see 
Kerns et al. 2001).  Moreover, information concerning population dynamics and spatial 

 
22
distribution of large herbivores or the range of historical variability for their effects in 
Southwest forest ecosystems is lacking (but see Truett 1996).  On some landscapes, 
including that of my study area, elk are thought to be more abundant and distributed more 
evenly than they were for possibly the last 800 years (Allen 1996, Truett 1996, Kay 
1997).  Indeed, ungulate herbivory in combination with forest structural changes appears 
to be exacerbating conservation problems in these ecosystems.  For ecological restoration 
activities that seek to reestablish ecosystem integrity and function, it is important to 
understand evolutionary environments of native species and emulate historical conditions 
of landscape-scale processes that include herbivory by large, wild ungulates.

CHAPTER 3: SEED ECOLOGY OF FENDLER CEANOTHUS: IMPLICATIONS 
FOR FOREST RESTORATION 
 
Abstract 
 
In the initial stages of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) forest restoration 
in the Southwest, understory environments are typically characterized by: 1) low plant 
abundance due to previously dense overstory conditions; and 2) highly disturbed forest 
floors due to mechanical tree thinning and application of prescribed fire.  Herbaceous and 
shrub understory recovery on these sites appears to be limited, in part, by propagule 
abundance.  To quantify flower, fruit, and seed production for an important shrub, I 
monitored Fendler ceanothus (Ceanothus fendleri Gray) plants for four years on 90 plots 
in three forest units undergoing restoration treatments in northern Arizona.  I examined 
ovule and seed losses in predispersal and post-dispersal stages.  I also conducted seed 
germination tests and examined effects of heat, heat duration, and cold stratification.  
Fendler ceanothus flowering generally increased over the four study years although fruit 
production appeared to be related to precipitation.  Mean fruit production varied from 7 
to 39 fruits per stem.  In a year of high fruit production, distributions of fruiting stem 
sizes significantly (p<0.001) deviated from those of the overall stem population and were 
shifted toward larger length and diameter classes.  A weak (p<0.05) positive relationship 
was found between fruit and seed production and stem diameter. Ovule losses during fruit 
set were 23-35%.  Of the total number of seeds produced, 50-58% were undeveloped.  Of 
seeds that appeared normally developed, 7-71% were parasitized by a seed chalcid 
(Eurytoma squamosa Bugbee).  An additional 1-3% of seeds were otherwise hollow.  

 
34
Post-dispersal seed predation varied from 2-24 % and predation was significantly 
(p<0.05) greater on charred forest floor substrate from prescribed fire than on unburned 
ponderosa pine litter.  Laboratory tests showed significantly (p<0.05) higher germination 
for seeds exposed to 90ºC compared to no-heat treatment (~20ºC).  Seeds exposed to 
temperatures greater than 120ºC did not germinate.  Information from this study can help 
managers determine strategies for increasing Fendler ceanothus seed production and 
regeneration while providing for ecosystem diversity and function.          
 
Introduction 
 
One of the primary goals of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) forest 
restoration in the southwestern United States is to increase understory plant community 
productivity and diversity to levels more closely reflecting conditions that existed prior to 
ecosystem degradation (Covington and Moore 1994, Kolb et al. 1994, Covington et al. 
1997, Moore et al. 1999).  Plant phytolith analyses revealed that an abundant understory 
of grasses, forbs, and shrubs associated with open forest conditions likely prevailed 
before ca 1870 (Kerns et al. 2001).  These communities have been severely reduced over 
the last ~130 years by population irruptions of ponderosa pine trees that resulted from 
overgrazing, exclusion of natural surface fires, and selective timber harvesting associated 
with EuroAmerican settlement of the region (Arnold 1950, Cooper 1960, Fulé et al. 1997, 
Mast et al. 1999).   Treatments to restore these forests include: 1) thinning of young 
(postsettlement) trees to emulate pre-degradation density and spatial pattern or to recreate 
more open conditions; and 2) application of low-intensity fire to reduce accumulated 
woody fuels and reintroduce a critical ecosystem process (Covington et al 1997, Moore et 

 
35
al. 1999).  Remnant populations of plants, dormant seeds stored in soil, and wind-blown 
seed serve as propagule sources for understory recovery after restoration activities.  
Disturbances associated with mechanical thinning and reintroduction of fire, in 
combination with low understory plant abundance before treatment, result in an 
abundance of safe sites (sensu Harper 1977) and population recruitment of individuals 
and maintenance of soil seed banks appear to be limited by seed supply (Springer et al. 
2000).  Under these conditions, seed production, fate, and viability are important 
determinants of population growth, replacement of individuals, and colonization of new 
sites (Andersen 1989).   
 
Fendler ceanothus (Ceanothus fendleri Gray) is a small shrub common to 
ponderosa pine forests in the Southwest (Epple 1995).  Like other species in its genus, 
Fendler ceanothus is a nitrogen-fixer (Story 1974, Conard et al. 1985) and provides 
various important structural and habitat elements to understory communities.  In 
particular, its values as wildlife browse and woody growth in predominantly herbaceous 
understories make it a key species in these ecosystems. 
 
Fendler ceanothus flowering can occur April-October but tends to peak in late 
June (Kearney and Peebles 1964, Epple 1995, Huffman pers. obs.).  Flowers are small 
(~2 mm), borne in panicles, and can be prolific; many species in the genus are cultivated 
for ornamental purposes and some are commonly referred to as “mountain lilac” 
(Kearney and Peebles 1964, Epple 1995).  In a previous study (Chapter 2 this 
dissertation), I reported that flowering stems tended to be larger and older members of 
stem populations.   

 
36
 
Fendler ceanothus fruits are 3-celled capsules (Kearney and Peebles 1964) that 
ripen August-September.  At present, I am not aware of any fruit or seed production data 
for Fendler ceanothus.  Predispersal seed parasitism by a chalcidoid wasp (Eurytoma 
squamosa Bugbee) can destroy as much as 71% of developed seeds (Huffman 2002).  At 
full development, seeds are dark brown in color and about 2 mm diameter.   
 
Seeds are dispersed by ballistic expulsion as fruits dehisce (Kearney and Peebles 
1964).  Although Fendler ceanothus stems and leaves are eaten by large ungulates such as 
mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus) (Urness 
1975, Conard et al. 1985, Allen 1996, see also Chapter 2 this dissertation), no 
information is currently available regarding rates of post-dispersal seed predation.   
 
After fire, Fendler ceanothus utilizes a dual regeneration strategy consisting of 
sprout production and seedling establishment (Pearson et al. 1972, Vose and White 1987, 
Vose and White 1991).  Seed germination requirements of Fendler ceanothus have not 
been studied in detail (Story 1974, Krishnan 1989), although heat treatments and cold 
stratification have been found to improve germination of several other Ceanothus species 
(Hadley 1961, Quick and Quick 1961, Gratkowski 1974).   
 
The main objectives of my study were to: 1) quantify Fendler ceanothus flower, 
fruit, and seed production in forest stands undergoing ecological restoration treatments; 
2) quantify ovule and seed losses during development and dispersal; and 3) evaluate 
germination characteristics of Fendler ceanothus seeds.  Information concerning seed 
output, relative importance and variability of seed losses, and seed dormancy traits can 
help ecologists and resource managers understand successional trends manifested on sites 
for which ecological restoration is a goal.  Further, this information can help managers 

 
37
formulate prescriptions aimed at manipulating Fendler ceanothus population 
characteristics.     
 
Methods 
Study Site 
 
The area used for studies of Fendler ceanothus reproductive capacity (flower, 
fruit, and seed production), seed parasitism, and seed predation was the Fort Valley 
Experimental Forest about 10 km northwest of Flagstaff, AZ.  This study site was 
previously described in detail in Chapter 2 of this dissertation.   
 
Flower, fruit, and seed production were measured on Fendler 180 plots, 1 m2 in 
size, in three experimental forest restoration units 1999-2002.  Plot establishment and 
design are described in detail in Chapter 2.  In each forest unit, plots were randomly 
assigned to herbivore protection and experimental burning treatments in a 2x2 factorial 
design.  Plots selected for herbivore protection were surrounded by wire mesh exclosures 
(“cages”) (see Chapter 2 this dissertation).  Herbivore protection and burning treatment 
combinations resulted in four treatments hereafter referred to as NCNB (no cage, no 
burn), NCB (no cage, burn), CNB (cage, no burn) and CB (cage, burn).  Experimental 
burning of plots was conducted in April of 2000 (24 plots) and May of 2001 (65 plots) 
when U.S. Forest Service staff implemented prescribed fire within the forest units.  More 
detail regarding experimental burning is given in Chapter 3, this dissertation. 
  
 
Germination experiments were done using seeds collected from four sites near 
Flagstaff, Arizona: 1) Bear Jaw Canyon (BJ); 2) Dutton Hill (DH); 3) Fort Valley (FV); 
and 4) Obsidian Tank (OT).  All sites had large (≥1 ha) populations of Fendler ceanothus 

 
38
that produced abundant seeds. The sites were separated by at least 21 km and represented 
a range of management histories and stand structure (Table 3.1).  Four sites were selected 
to provide a general description of Fendler ceanothus seed germination characteristics.   
 
Sampling and Laboratory Procedures 
Flower, Fruit, and Seed Production  
 
Fendler ceanothus plants plots were examined in June 1999-2002 for flowering 
stems.  Length, diameter, and age class were recorded for flowering stems found on these 
plots each year (see Chapter 2 this dissertation).  In July, I identified all stems with fruits.  
In 1999 and 2002, fruits were found on less than 0.05 stems per plot and seed production 
was not sampled.  Fruit and seed production was intensively sampled in 2000 and 2001 
when fruits were produced in greater abundance.  In 2000, all stems bearing fruit were 
sampled.  In 2001, fruit production was prolific and fruiting stems were randomly 
sampled at a rate of 43%.  For each sampled stem, number of fruits and empty receptacles 
were counted.  In 2001, I also recorded length, diameter, and age class on fruiting stems.  
 
   To estimate seed production, fruits were surrounding with nylon mesh (mesh 
size < 2 mm) “traps” that caught seeds as they were dispersed.  In 2000, all stems bearing 
fruit were sampled and fitted with seed traps.  In 2001, stems randomly selected for 
sampling (see above) were fitted with seed traps. 
 
In late August of both sample years, seed trap contents (seeds, debris, and fruit 
remaining on stems) were collected and taken to the laboratory for analysis.  Seeds 
collected from traps were separated from plant debris and counted.  Seeds were classified 
as “developed” or “undeveloped”.  Developed seeds were approximately 2 mm diameter 

 
39
with smooth, full seed coats and glossy brown in appearance (Fig. 3.1a).  In contrast, 
undeveloped seeds were typically smaller than 2 mm, flattened, and had wrinkled, 
yellowish appearing seed coats (Fig. 3.1b).   Number of seeds per hectare (SPH) was 
calculated using the following: 
 
SPH = (seed producing stems · m-2) * (seeds · stem-1) * 10,000 m2 · ha-1 
Seed Parasitism  
 
Developed seeds collected in traps were examined under a dissecting scope (10-
20 power) for parasite emergence holes or other signs of damage.  Seeds were dissected 
to determine embryo condition and presence of parasite larvae/pupae.  A small sample 
(n=10) of undeveloped seeds also were dissected.  To identify seed parasites, I monitored 
(1999-2001) seeds collected from Fendler ceanothus shrubs growing on microsites 
adjacent to the restoration units.  Adult parasites emerging from seeds were captured and 
preserved in 70% isopropyl alcohol.  Specimens were sent to Dr. Robert Zuparko at the 
California Academy of Science (CAS), San Francisco, CA, USA, and to the USDA 
Systematic Entomology Laboratory (SEL) (specimens identified by E. Eric Grissell, 
Research Entomologist), Bethesda, MD, USA for identification.  
 
Seed Predation 
 
To study rates of post-dispersal seed predation, removal of Fendler ceanothus 
seeds (collected 1999) from experimental seed depots at the Fort Valley site was 
quantified in September 2000 and 2001.  Seed predation transects, 250 m in length, were 
systematically established in the three forest restoration units used for herbivory studies 
(see Chapter 2 this dissertation).  Transects were located near Fendler ceanothus plots 

 
40
used for herbivory studies and systematically oriented in directions that assured they 
remained within the forest restoration units (i.e., transects did not extend into adjacent 
forest areas).  At 50-m intervals (five points) along transects, seed depots were 
established and Fendler ceanothus seeds were placed on substrate-filled Petri dishes.  
Because I wanted to understand how seed predation varied with substrate, 2 dishes at 
each seed depot were filled with charred forest floor or unburned ponderosa pine needles 
substrates.  Charred forest floor substrate was collected on-site from forest units that had 
been burned with prescribed fire.  Ten Fendler ceanothus seeds were placed on the 
substrate surface of each dish.  In 2001, an additional dish of each substrate was added to 
randomly selected points along each transect and sunflower (Helianthus sp.) seeds were 
placed on these.  Sunflower seeds were added to provide an indication of seed predator 
activity and relative preference for Fendler ceanothus seeds; sunflower seeds were 
presumed to be preferred by many generalist seed predators (C. Chambers pers. comm.).   
 
Seed depots were left in place for 8-10 days.   At collection, Petri dishes were 
covered and transported to the laboratory for analysis.  Seeds remaining in dishes were 
sieved from substrate and counted to determine the number removed at depots.  
 
Seed Germination 
 
Fendler ceanothus capsules were collected in late August 2001 from each of the 
four sites described in Table 3.1.  Capsules from at least 5 shrub patches per site collected 
and stored in paper bags until processed.  In the laboratory, seeds were separated from 
capsules by gently grinding with a mortar and pestle.   

 
41
 
To broadly identify requirements for Fendler ceanothus seed germination, I 
conducted a pilot experiment in 2001.  The objectives of the experiment were to examine 
the effects of heat and heat duration on seed germination.  Five samples of 9-17 seeds 
each were separated from each of the four seed collection sites (BJ, DH, FV, OT) and 
dissected as described above (see Methods: Seed Production and Parasitism).  
Dissections allowed me to select a collection with a relatively high proportion of filled 
seeds.  Based on these dissections, seeds from the DH site (87% filled) were used.  Seeds 
(n=10-21) were randomly assigned to one of 18 treatments in a factorial temperature (6 
levels) x duration (3 levels) design.  Seeds were placed in shallow aluminum pans and 
heated in an electric drying oven at one of six temperatures: 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, or 
210ºC.  The duration of heating was: 1, 10, or 20 minutes. Each temperature x duration 
combination was replicated twice with separate applications of heat.  Four seed samples 
were left unheated as controls. Seeds were germinated on moistened filter paper in Petri 
dishes in a controlled incubation chamber (Percival Scientific Inc., model 1500).  Day 
length and temperature in the chamber were set to 14 hours, and 30ºC, respectively.  Full-
spectrum, fluorescent lighting was provided during day periods.  Night length and 
temperature were 10 hours and 20ºC, respectively.  Seeds were examined approximately 
every two days until germination was completed (about 24 days).  Germination was 
defined as successful if radicals extended beyond the seed coat by at least 2 mm. 
 
Based on pilot study findings (see Results), a germination experiment was 
designed with better understanding of heat duration effects and effective temperature 
range.  In this study, I tested a narrower temperature range and also examined effects of 
cold stratification on seed germination.  Seed samples (n = 10) were separated from each 

 
42
of the four collection sites and randomly assigned to one treatment using a 6 
(temperature) x 2 (cold stratification) factorial design. Each treatment was replicated 
three times for each site by separate applications of heat. Temperatures tested were the 
following: no heat, 50, 70, 90, 110, and 130ºC.  Seeds were heated for 10 minutes in an 
electric drying oven following the procedures described above.  Similar methods have 
been used to test fire-related germination cues for seeds of other shrub species (Kenny 
2000).  Seeds were then either cold-stratified or left unstratified.  Stratified seeds were 
placed between moistened filter papers in Petri dishes and allowed to imbibe water at 
room temperature (~ 20ºC) for 24 hours.  Petri dishes were then sealed in black plastic 
and placed in a cooler at approximately 4ºC for 60 days.  Seeds were germinated in a 
controlled incubation chamber as described above. 
 
To test their germinability, 100 undeveloped seeds were separated from each of 
the DH and FV collections.  Lots of 50 seeds each were randomly assigned to either heat 
treatment (90ºC) or control (no heat).  Germination tests followed the procedures 
described above.    
 
    
Data Analysis 
 
Proportion of stems producing flowers and fruits was calculated for individual 
plots within herbivore protection x burning treatments.  Chi-squared tests were used to 
analyze distributions of fruiting stem sizes versus sizes of all stems in the population (all 
stems on protected, unburned plots) (Devore and Peck 1986).  Normality of stem size 
distributions was assessed using normal probability plots.  Stem length data were 
separated into 5-cm classes (df = 12) and stem diameters were placed in 0.1-mm (log10-

 
43
transformed to approximate normality) classes (df = 12) for analysis.  A 0.05 probability 
level was used to determine significant deviation from chi-squared critical values.   
 
Linear regression was used to examine relationships between fruit and seed 
production in 2001 and stem length and diameter.  Data were natural-log transformed 
when residual plots showed increasing variance with increasing values of the independent 
variable.  Relationships were considered significant at a 0.05 probability level.   
 
Mann-Whitney nonparametric tests were used to test differences in number of 
seeds removed from charred forest floor and unburned pine litter substrates in the post-
dispersal seed predation experiments.  A 0.05 probability level was used for tests of 
statistical significance. 
 
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test effects of heat duration (3 levels) 
and temperature (6 levels) on seed germination in the pilot study.  A probability level of 
0.05 was used for significance tests of main effects and temperature x duration 
interaction.  One-way ANOVA was also used to test for main effects of temperature 
alone on germination.  Bonferroni post-hoc tests were used to compare mean differences 
between temperatures (Kuehl 1994).  Germination values (proportions of seeds 
germinating) were arcsine-transformed to stabilize variances and allow values of 
observations to more closely conform to assumptions of the linear model (Kuehl 1994).   
 
ANOVA was used to test for effects of cold stratification (2 levels) and 
temperature (6 levels) on seed germination.  Collection site was used as a blocking factor 
in the ANOVA model.  Seed germination values were square-root, arcsine-transformed 
and a probability level of 0.05 was used to determine significance of main effects.  One-

 
44
way ANOVA was used to test for main effects of temperature alone.  Bonferroni post-
hoc tests were used to compare mean differences between temperatures (Kuehl 1994).  
 
Results 
Flower, Fruit, and Seed Production 
  
Fendler ceanothus flower production generally increased over the four study years 
although herbivory and burning affected the proportion of stems on plots that flowered 
(Fig. 3.2).  In 1999, approximately three months after overstories in the forest units had 
been thinned, only two stems on 180 plots (less than 0.05 stems/plot) were found with 
flowers.  In 2000, mean proportion of stems producing flowers varied with treatment 
(Fig. 3.2).  First-year resprouts arising on plots that were burned in spring of 2000 did not 
produce flowers.  Flowering occurred on 14.6-28.8% of stems on protected plots and 1.3-
2.3% of stem on unprotected plots that were not burned (Fig. 3.2).  Flowering in 2001 
showed a similar pattern as observed in 2000; no first-year resprouts and very few (0-
2.3%) stems not protected from herbivores produced flowers (Fig. 3.2).  In 2002, 0.8-
8.9% of stems on unprotected plots and 7.8-52.4% of stems on protected plots produced 
flowers.   
 
In 1999, I observed empty receptacles on the two stems that had produced flowers 
earlier in the spring.  Thus, it appeared that one or more fruits had been produced (Fig. 
3.3).  In the following three years (2000-2002) no fruit were found on stems that were not 
protected from large herbivores.  Field observations suggested that lack of fruiting on 
unprotected plots was primarily due to direct herbivory of inflorescences as well as fruit-

 
45
set failure.  Proportion of stems that produced fruit on unburned, protected plots ranged 
from 2.4 to 5.6% in 2000 and from 11.2 to 20.9% in 2001 (Fig 3.3).   
 
Across all treatments, from 1 to 28 fruits per stem were produced in 2000 
(mean=7.4; SE=3.2).  This amount represented 3-84 potential seeds per stem 
(mean=22.2; SE=9.6) as based on 3 ovules per fruit (Kearney and Peebles 1964).  In 
2001, fruit production increased and from 1 to 408 fruits per stem were observed 
(mean=39.4; SE=7.4).  This amount represented 3-1,224 potential seeds per stem 
(mean=118.2; SE=22.2).  In 2002, I recorded what appeared to be near complete failure 
of Fendler ceanothus fruit set (Fig. 3.3). Although not statistically analyzed, fruit 
production appeared to be positively related to winter plus growing season (Jan.-Sept.) 
precipitation.  In the last three years of study (2000-2002), growing season precipitation 
was 60, 93, and 50% of the long-term average for the site, respectively (Western 
Regional Climate Center 2003).  Flower production appeared to be independent of 
growing season precipitation (Fig. 3.4).   
 
 
Fruiting stem sizes (2001) were large relative to the total population of stems on 
plots (Fig. 3.5).  Distributions of fruiting stem length and diameter were shifted towards 
the larger size classes in the population.  No stems less than 20 cm in length produced 
fruit, although these sizes comprised approximately 15 % of the total population.  
Similarly, no fruit was found on stems less than 3 mm basal diameter, although these 
stems comprised just over 28% of the total population.  Although fruiting stems were 
relatively large, number of fruits produced per stem was not significantly (p>0.05) related 
to stem length.  A weak positive relationship (r2=0.06; p=0.02) existed between fruit 
production and stem diameter. 

 
46
 
Patterns of seed production followed patterns for fruiting.  In 2000, seed-bearing 
stems produced 14.4 (SE=7.8) total seeds per stem on average.  This represented a 35% 
ovule loss from the potential number of seeds (Table 3.2).  Of the total seeds produced in 
2000, 50.0% were undeveloped.  Dissections of undeveloped seeds typically showed no 
embryo present (i.e., hollow seed) or small flattened embryos that were apparently not 
viable (see Seed Germination below).  More than one-third (35.4%) were parasitized by 
a chalcidoid wasp (Eurytomidae: Eurytoma squamosa Bugbee).  Parasitized seeds from 
which adults wasps had emerged were always found to be hollow.  Diagnostic emergence 
holes were evident on many parasitized seeds although immature (larvae or pupae) wasps 
were also found during seed dissections.  Seeds housing immature wasps showed no 
visible signs of infestation without dissection, suggesting that oviposition occurred during 
early stages of seed ripening.  Loss of otherwise normally developed seeds (i.e., 
excluding undeveloped seeds) due to parasitism was 70.8%.  Hollow seeds comprised 
1.3% of all seeds produced.  Filled seeds with apparently healthy embryos comprised 
13.2% of all seeds collected (Huffman 2002).  On average, 1.9 (SE=1.6) sound seeds 
were produced per stem in 2000, an amount that represented an ovule loss of 91.4% 
based on seed production potential (Table 3.2). Number of sounds seed per hectare in 
2000 was approximately 3,410. 
 
 
In 2001, an average of 90.9 (SE=26.8) total seeds per stem were produced.  
Similar to 2000 patterns, this number represented a 23% ovule loss from the potential 
seed number based on fruit production (Table 3.2).  Undeveloped, parasitized, hollow, 
and filled seeds comprised 58.1, 3.1, 0.7, and 38.0%, respectively, of the total number 
produced in 2001.  Loss of otherwise normally developed seeds due to parasites was 

 
47
7.5%.  Number of sound seeds produced in 2001 averaged 34.6 per stem (SE=11.6), an 
amount that represented a loss of 70.4% based on seed production potential (Table 3.2).  
Number of sound seeds per hectare in 2001 was approximately 9.04 × 105. 
 
Similar to fruit production, linear regression analysis showed no significant 
(p>0.05) relationship between total number of seeds produced and stem length.  A weak 
(r2=0.09; p=0.005) positive relationship was found between number of seeds produced 
per stem and stem diameter.   
 
Post-Dispersal Seed Predation 
 
In 2000, few Fendler ceanothus seeds were removed from seed depots in the three 
experimental restoration units.  I found no significant (p>0.05) difference in counts of 
seeds removed from charred forest floor or unburned litter substrate (Table 3.3).  Seed 
removal averaged 1.0% (SE=1.0) across all samples. 
 
 Significantly (p<0.05) more seeds were removed from dishes containing charred 
forest floor substrate than those with unburned litter in 2001 (Table 3.3).  On charred 
forest floor substrate, nearly one-quarter of Fendler ceanothus seeds were removed 
whereas removal on unburned litter was less than 3%.  Discarded Fendler ceanothus seed 
coats at depots indicated that predators, probably rodents, immediately consumed seeds 
as they found them.  Although low sample size made sunflower seed removal patterns 
difficult to assess, trends similar to those observed for Fendler ceanothus occurred.  No 
sunflower seeds remained in charred forest floor dishes (n=3), whereas all 10 seeds 
remained in one dish (n=3; removal=66.7%) containing unburned litter.   

 
48
 
Accounting for post-dispersal losses, estimates of Fendler ceanothus seed inputs 
to soil seed banks were approximately 3,329-3,410 and 6.9 x 105-8.9 x 105 seeds per 
hectare in 2000 and 2001, respectively.  These values represent cumulative ovules losses 
of 71.2-91.6% from the number of seeds potentially produced based on mean number of 
fruit per stem (Table 3.2).     
 
 
Seed Germination 
 
Condition of seeds from the four collection sites was dramatically different as 
demonstrated by dissection of random samples (Table 3.4).  For example, parasitism and 
otherwise unfilled seeds comprised 57-84 % of the total number of seeds from BJ and OT 
sites.  In contrast, over 75 % of the seeds from DH and FV sites were sound.   
 
The pilot study using seeds from the DH site indicated that temperatures of 150ºC 
or greater were lethal to Fendler ceanothus seeds (Table 3.5).  Effect of heat duration on 
germination was not significant (p>0.05).  Interestingly, a temperature effect was 
apparent when seeds were exposed to heat for just one minute. Across all durations, 
germination was significantly (p<0.05) affected by temperature and significantly 
(p<0.05) more seeds germinated when heated to 90ºC than all other treatments (Table 
3.5).  Undeveloped seeds (FV and DH collection sites) did not germinate regardless of 
whether they were subjected to heat treatment or not. 
 
No effect (p > 0.05) of cold stratification on Fendler ceanothus germination was 
found in the larger experiment using seeds from all four collection sites.  For cold-
stratified and not stratified seeds combined, heat (10 minute duration) significantly 
(p<0.05) affected germination (Fig. 3.6).  Seeds exposed to 90º C had higher germination 

 
49
rates than seeds receiving no heat, or those exposed to 50, 110, or 130º C.   Temperatures 
of 70 and 90ºC had a similar effect on germination.  No seeds germinated after exposure 
to 130ºC.   
 
Discussion 
Herbivory and Fire Effects on Flower and Fruit Production 
 
Reduced flower production associated with intense herbivory by large mammals, 
such as mule deer and Rocky Mountain elk, during the first two years after restoration 
tree thinning was described earlier (Chapter 2 this dissertation).  This trend continued into 
the third and fourth years of observation.  Although flower production appeared to 
increase slightly over the four years on unprotected plots, mean proportion of stems 
producing flowers was never greater than about 9%.  This contrasted sharply with 
protected plots where mean proportion of stems producing flowers reached about 52% on 
unburned plots in 2002 (Fig. 3.2).  Intense herbivory on other woody plants has been 
shown to decrease flower production and stem recruitment in Southwest and other 
ecosystems (Stein et al. 1992, Hoffman and Wambolt 1996, Strohmeyer and Maschinski 
1996, Opperman and Merelender).  
 
Experimentally burned plants produced resprouts that did not flower during their 
first growing season.  Flower production on these stems appeared to recover to unburned 
levels within one to two years.  I did not observe patterns that suggested that flower 
production was enhanced by fire although other studies have shown this to be common 
(Miller 2000).  Season of burning may play a large role in determining whether fire 
enhances flower production.  For example, Platt et al. (1988) found fires during the 

 
50
growing season increased flowering synchronization and decreased flowering duration 
for understory species in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) forests.  Burning in my 
study was done in the dormant season (spring) and thus may not have coincided with 
phenological or environmental cues that affect flowering.  In addition to release of 
dormant buds that may be stimulated to flower, production may increase after fire due to 
changes in microclimate (e.g., increased light and soil temperature) or soil properties 
(e.g., increased soil moisture and soluble nutrients) (Miller 2000). 
     
Reproductive Capacity and Ovule Losses 
 
Large differences in flower, fruit and seed production between the two study 
years (2000 and 2001) likely reflected combined influences of release from overstory tree 
competition and drought.  For example, flower production generally increased for four 
years since time of overstory thinning in 1998-1999, likely because of improved 
microsite conditions such as increased light, soil moisture, and nutrient availability 
(Covington et al. 1997, Kaye and Hart 1998, Meyer et al. 2001).  For example, negative 
relationships between vegetative production of understory plants and ponderosa pine 
overstory density have been widely reported (Ffolliott and Clary 1975, Ursek and 
Severson 1989, Tapia et al. 1990 Moore and Deiter 1992).  Further, precipitation (Jan.-
Sept.) in 2002, a year of abundant flower production but massive fruiting failure, was 
about 50% of the sites long-term average (Western Regional Climate Center 2003).  In 
2001, precipitation was nearly (91%) normal and both flower and fruit production were 
relatively high.  Variability in fruit production has been linked to previous-year 
precipitation for other species of Ceanothus in chaparral ecosystems (Keeley 1977, 

 
51
Keeley 1987, Zammit and Zedler 1992).  For these chaparral species, floral buds are 
produced in the year prior to flowering.  Although my four-year study was not long 
enough to clearly assess effects of precipitation on fruit and seed production, my results 
did show that widespread fruit failure can occur in an extremely droughty year even 
though rates of flower production in that year were similar to the previous year when 
precipitation was closer to normal (Fig. 3.4).  In years of adequate precipitation, fruiting 
appeared to be related to stem size.  Although I found only a weak relationship between 
number of fruits produced and stem diameter, fruit production was observed on only the 
largest stems (both length and diameter) of the overall population.  Similarly, Zammit 
and Zedler (1992) found that shrub size was the primary determinant of seed production 
for C. greggii plants that ranged from about 50-300 cm in height.   
 
Differences between potential and actual seed production indicated that about 1 
ovule per fruit failed.  Causes for ovule loss in this study are not known.  In general, 
ovule losses are thought to be linked to lack of pollination, resource limitation, fruit 
abortion, and/or predation (Stephenson 1981).  In 2001 and 2002, I observed flower 
visitation by various adult insects (Huffman unpublished data) in the Lepidoptera and 
Apidae (Hymenoptera); both groups are potential pollinators (Borror et al. 1989).  
Number and diversity of adult Lepidoptera have been found to increase after restoration 
treatments in ponderosa pine forests (Waltz 2001).  I also observed species of 
Chrysomelidae, insects that often feed on flowers and pollen (Huffman unpublished 
data).  Furniss et al. (1978) speculated that psyllids may have contributed to ovules losses 
of redstem ceanothus (Ceanothus sanguineus).  

 
52
 
Incomplete seed ripening was another consistently important (50-58% loss of total 
seeds) source of seed loss in 2000 and 2001.  Dissection and germination tests confirmed 
that seeds classified as undeveloped were not viable.  Abnormal seeds with shriveled seed 
coats have been classified for other Ceanothus species as “unsound” (Furniss et al. 1978) 
and “aborted” (Zammit and Zedler 1992).  Additionally, Keeley (1977) scored Ceanothus 
sp. seeds as “inviable” if embryos were shrunken or discolored as indicated by seed 
dissection.  For redstem ceanothus, unsound seeds comprised 52-86% of the total crop 
over a three-year period at three sites in Idaho (Furniss et al. 1978).  Zammit and Zedler 
(1992) reported that from 1 to 2 seeds per capsule were aborted for C. greggii over five 
study years; fewer seeds were aborted in stands of young (6-32 years) shrubs.  Similarly, 
Keeley (1977) found that at least half the seeds produced by both Ceanothus greggii and 
C. leucodermis were not viable over three study years on a chaparral site in California.  
Causes for undeveloped seeds in my study are not known although other authors 
hypothesize that interactions of precipitation and plant carbohydrate stores determine 
seed outputs for Ceanothus species in chaparral (Keely 1977, Zammit and Zedler 1992). 
 
Predispersal parasitism was variably important (7-71 % loss of developed seeds) 
in further reducing number of viable seeds.  The chalcidoid wasp, Eurytoma squamosa, 
was the only predispersal seed parasite found.  In an early note, Huffman (2002) 
documented Fendler ceanothus in Arizona as an extension of the known host and range 
record for this insect.  Parasitic wasps of the Eurytoma genus have been reported feed on 
seeds of several Ceanothus species and members of the Rhamnaceae family (Bugbee 
1967, 1971, Furniss and Krebill 1972, Furniss et al. 1978, M. Gates pers. comm.).  A lack 
of ceanothus congeners on my site suggests an important linkage between Fendler 

 
53
ceanothus and Eurytoma squamosa.  Further research is needed to describe temporal and 
spatial dynamics of this host-parasite system and the importance of seed parasitism in 
population dynamics of Fendler ceanothus.  My data indicate that more than two-thirds of 
otherwise normally developing seeds can be consumed in a given year by this insect. 
 
Similar to predispersal seed parasitism, post-dispersal seed predation was a 
variably (2-24% of dispersed seeds) important source of seed loss.  Although I did not 
attempt to determine identities of seed predators, discarded seed coats left at depots 
suggested that rodents were responsible for some predation.  Rodents such as Tamias 
cinericolis, T. dorsalis, Peromyscus maniculatus, and Neotoma spp. are common in these 
forests and have been implicated in high (~80% removal) rates of seed predation in other 
studies (Compton unpublished data).  In chaparral, harvester ants were found to be more 
important than vertebrates in removing Ceanothus seeds from experimental depots in 
nighttime hours.  Further, vertebrate predators were poor at locating seeds buried under 
plant litter (Mills and Kummerow 1989).  My results corroborate these findings and 
suggest that risks of predation are lowest when seeds disperse onto pine litter.  Seeds 
rapidly percolate into this coarse substrate whereas on charred forest floor seeds are more 
exposed to predators.    
 
Seed Germination          
 
 
Results from laboratory experiments showed that application of moderate heat 
(70-110ºC) for periods of 1-20 minutes stimulated Fendler ceanothus seed germination.  
Many Ceanothus species require heat to allow opening of seed coats, although a few 
show adverse response to heating (Hadley 1961, Quick and Quick 1961, Reed 1974).  I 

 
54
found 90ºC to be optimal for stimulating germination regardless of duration of heat (up to 
20 minutes) or cold stratification, whereas temperatures greater than 120ºC caused seed 
mortality.  These results indicate that Fendler ceanothus utilizes a dormant-seed 
regeneration strategy.  This is a common trait of the Ceanothus genus in ecosystems 
ranging from coastal chaparral to ponderosa pine forests of the northwestern United 
States (Gratkowski 1974, Keeley 1977, Conard et al. 1985).  The dormant-seed strategy 
is advantageous for recolonizing sites after severe disturbances such as infrequent fire.  
Temperatures in soil environments during fire vary greatly depending on fuel conditions, 
fire behavior, and depth in profile (Whelan 1995).  Although Fendler ceanothus has been 
reported to increase after prescribed burns and wildfires in ponderosa pine forests of the 
Southwest (Pearson et al. 1972, Ffolliott et al. 1977), few studies have documented 
germination and seedling emergence from seed banks (but see Vose and White 1987).  In 
other ecosystems, Ceanothus seeds are thought to remain viable in soil for decades 
(Gratkowski 1974, Keeley 1977).  In this way, ceanothus can persist in the seed bank 
through periods of potentially high levels of competition from full understory 
communities or dense overstory conditions (Gratkowski 1974).  Fire or other 
disturbances that stimulate germination also can create favorable microsites for seedling 
establishment (Keeley 1977).  Long-term seed viability of Fendler ceanothus seeds is 
unclear although 40-year-old seeds can be successfully germinated (Huffman 
unpublished data).  In the present study, a fraction (20%) of seeds germinated without 
being heated and thus these seeds may have short-term residence in seed banks.  Findings 
from these germination tests suggest that Fendler ceanothus regeneration strategies allow 

 
55
for both immediate colonization of microsites and simultaneous development of a 
dormant seed bank.     
 
   
Management Implications 
 
Management activities that facilitate growth and retention of large Fendler 
ceanothus stems can increase seed inputs to soil seed banks.  Protecting plants from 
intense ungulate herbivory may allow rapid development of large fruit-producing stems 
(see Chapter 2 this dissertation).  Although not tested in this study, operational 
approaches to herbivore protection may include strategic piling of thinning slash, 
modification of hunting regulations, or use of commercially available ungulate deterrent.  
 
Gross fruit production as an indicator of viable seed inputs may be misleading 
since ovule and seed losses from abortion and predispersal parasitism can be high.  Rapid 
estimates of viable seeds can be made by examination of mature fruit contents before 
dehiscence.  A subsample of normal-appearing seeds should be dissected to determine 
degree of parasitism.  Managers also should note that seed predators may consume a 
significant proportion of dispersed seeds and predation can vary widely among years.  
Fendler ceanothus flower, fruit, and seed use by various organisms demonstrates the 
importance of each of this species’ reproductive stages in contributing to overall 
ecosystem function.   
 
Germination of Fendler ceanothus seeds can be accomplished using heat 
treatments of temperatures between 70 and 90ºC.  Assessments of seed bank composition 
for these forests should include heating as a germination cue or otherwise risk 
underestimating Fendler ceanothus viable seed abundance.  Managers wishing to increase 

 
56
Fendler ceanothus on sites can pre-treat seeds before sowing, or use low severity 
prescribed fire to stimulate natural seedling emergence (Vose and White 1987).

CHAPTER 4: RESPONSE OF FENDLER CEANOTHUS TO FOREST 
THINNING, PRESCRIBED FIRE, AND DROUGHT 
 
Abstract 
 
Overstory tree thinning and prescribed fire are used to restore ecosystem structure 
and function in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) forests of the Southwest.  In 
order to examine the effects of these restoration treatments on growth and reproduction of 
a common shrub species, I monitored Fendler ceanothus (Ceanothus fendleri Gray) plants 
from 1999 to 2002 in thinned and unthinned forest restoration units. I evaluated the 
importance of stand density (Reineke’s SDI) and ungulate herbivory in predicting 
current-year branch length, number of branches, biomass, and leaf area.  I also 
experimentally burned plants and studied mortality, seedling emergence, and growth 
response.  SDI was negatively (p<0.05) correlated with current-year branch length, 
branch number, biomass, and leaf area but explained only up to 23% of variation in 
simple linear regressions.  Proportion of current-year branches browsed improved models 
and r-squared values increased to 0.47.  Model predictions of growth were highest in 
years with near normal precipitation and lowest in drought years.  Mortality was 17-32% 
and 0-5% for burned and unburned plants, respectively.  Mortality was significantly 
(p<0.05) related to amount (cm) of forest floor consumed.  Surviving burned plants 
responded by producing long resprouts and current-year branches were significantly 
(p<0.05) longer than unburned plants although fewer in number.  Unburned plants had 
greater current-year biomass and leaf area than burned plants one growing season after 
fire, but differences were short-lived.  Seedlings emerged on 44% of burned plots and a 

 
75
quadratic relationship (p<0.05) represented the relationship between emergence and 
forest floor consumption.  No seedlings were observed on unburned plots.  Results 
indicate that forest restoration treatments can help increase abundance of Ceanothus 
fendleri but growth responses are constrained by ungulate herbivory and severity of 
prescribed fires.   
 
Introduction 
 
It is well known that tree thinning and opening of dense overstory canopies alters 
understory microclimate by allowing greater light transmission and increasing throughfall 
precipitation and soil temperatures (Anderson et al. 1969, McLaughlin 1978, Vales and 
Bunnell 1988, Groot and Carlson 1996).  Reduction of overstory density can also 
increase available soil moisture and nutrients (Covington et al. 1997, Kaye and Hart 
1998).  These changes can be beneficial to understory plants and increased community 
production is commonly observed after overstory thinning (Jameson 1967, Ffolliott and 
Clary 1975, Uresk and Severson 1989).  Response of understory communities to changes 
in overstory density can be expressed by negative linear or curvilinear functions (Ffolliott 
and Clary 1975).  For example, in northern Arizona ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa 
Laws.) forests, forage production increased linearly as values of Reineke’s stand density 
index (SDI; Reineke 1933) decreased below 400-550 (Moore and Deiter 1992).  At 
higher SDI values, understory production responses to variations in stand density were 
minimal.    
 
Quantification of overstory-understory relationships allows forest managers to 
predict outcomes of ecological restoration treatments that use thinning to reduce 

 
76
overstory densities to levels more like those of presettlement forests (Covington and 
Moore 1994, Covington et al. 1997, Moore et al. 1999).  In some cases, however, other 
interactions may be as important as stand density in constraining understory plant growth 
and reproduction.  For example, I previously showed that Fendler ceanothus (Ceanothus 
fendleri Gray) not protected from browsing mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and Rocky 
Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus) had around one-fourth the current-year biomass as 
protected plants in ponderosa pine stands that had been thinned as part of an  ecological 
restoration experiment (see Chapter 2 this dissertation).  Additionally, severe drought 
may override potential benefits of forest thinning in these semi-arid ecosystems (Fulé et 
al. 2002).  Finally, seeds of plants with seedbank strategies often require scarification or 
other cues to initiate germination (Harper 1977).  For these species, recruitment of new 
genets into populations may not occur as a result of overstory thinning alone.  
 
Prescribed fire is often used with thinning as an ecological restoration tool in 
ponderosa pine forests of the Southwest (Covington et al. 1997, Moore et al. 1999, Allen 
et al. 2002).  Low intensity fire can mineralize accumulated forest floor litter layers, 
release nutrients bound in detritus, reduce slash fuel loads that are created from tree 
thinning, and stimulate plant sprouting and germination of dormant seeds (Whelan 1995).  
Importantly, low-intensity fire was common in presettlement ponderosa pine forests of 
the Southwest, returning at mean intervals ranging from 2 to 20 years (Fulé et al. 1997) 
Thus, fire is a critical process to be reintroduced when restoration of functional attributes 
in these ecosystems is a goal (Kauffmann et al.1994, Covington et al. 1999).  
 
Presettlement fires likely burned quickly through abundant grassy fuels and 
transferred little heat to soil systems in Southwest ponderosa pine forests.  Low fuel 

 
77
loads, high fuel moistures, high relative humidity, low daytime temperatures, and low 
wind speed are needed to safely reintroduce fire in these forests where it has been 
excluded for nearly 130 years (Sackett et al. 1996, Fulé et al. 1997).  These initial fires 
can smolder in slash and deep layers of accumulated forest floor debris and release lethal 
levels of heat into soils (Covington and Sackett 1990, Sackett et al. 1996).  Thus, fire 
behavior and severity may be important determinants of successional trajectories for 
understory communities after prescribed burning.  Development of easily measured fire 
behavior variables predictive of effects on understory species can help land managers 
prescribe burns that both reduce accumulated fuels and accomplish ecological objectives 
related to vegetation structure and composition.   
 
My objective in this study was to quantify the effects of overstory density and 
prescribed fire on Fendler ceanothus, a semi-evergreen, nitrogen-fixing shrub common in 
understories of ponderosa pine forests throughout the Southwest (Story 1974, Conard et 
al. 1985).  Scattered populations of Fendler ceanothus provide structural heterogeneity 
and wildlife habitat particularly browse for mule deer and elk, in these plant communities 
(see Chapter 2 this dissertation).  Resprouting of Fendler ceanothus after disturbances 
such as fire appears to be common (Pearson et al. 1972, Ffolliott et al. 1977, Vose and 
White 1991) although detailed descriptions of vegetative characteristics and variation of 
response to fire behavior is presently lacking.  Its seeds are forcibly ejected from 
dehiscing capsules and likely remain in forest floor seed banks for years until stimulated 
by heat from fire to germinate similar to congeneric species (Kearney and Peebles 1951, 
Quick and Quick 1961, Reed 1974, Krishnan 1989).  Here I report Fendler ceanothus 
growth and reproduction under various forest stand densities and the importance of 

 
78
herbivory and drought in constraining response.  I also describe mortality, production, 
and seedling recruitment on experimentally burned plots.

N, 111° 41' W) in Coconino County approximately 10 km northwest of Flagstaff, 
Arizona.  Elevation of the study area was around 2300 m above mean sea level.  Aspect 
of the site was generally southern and the topography was gentle with average slopes of 
approximately 5-10%.  Soils are developed on tertiary basalt parent material and are 
moderately well drained.  Annual precipitation at the site averages around 52 cm and is 
typically bimodal in distribution with July-September rain and December-March snow.  
In 1999, precipitation was 96% of the long-term (51 y) average of 41.3 cm for January-
September (Western Regional Climate Center 2003).  In 2000, 63% of the long-term 
average fell in these months. In 2001, precipitation was 91%, but in 2002 only 54% of the 
long-term average for January-September occurred.  Thus, 1999 and 2001 had near 
average precipitation whereas 2000 and 2002 were droughts. 
 
Forest overstories were comprised of ponderosa pine and common understory 
species included the grasses Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica Vasey), mountain muhly 
(Muhlenbergia montana (Nutt.) A.S. Hitchc.), bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus elymoides 
(Raf.) Swezey) and pine dropseed (Blepharoneuron tricholepis (Torr.) Nash); the forbs 
lupine (Lupinus spp.), fleabane (Erigeron spp.), buckwheat (Eriogonum spp.), yarrow 
(Achillea millifolium L.), and pussytoes (Antennaria spp.); and shrubs Fendler ceanothus 

 
79
and woods rose (Rosa woodsii Lindl.).  No domestic livestock were present at the study 
site and primary large herbivores were mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and Rocky 
Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus).  
 
Design  
 
Fendler ceanothus patches were located in three forest units undergoing 
ecological restoration treatments and three adjacent untreated (control) units in March 
1999.  Forest restoration units were 14-16 hectares in size and were thinned in late winter 
1998.  Before thinning, basal area was 34-38 m2/ha and density was 955-1492 trees/ha.  
Thinning from below reduced basal area by 35-56% and left 140-243 trees/ha in scattered 
groups to emulate presettlement spatial structure (Fulé et al. 2001).      
 
Ten discrete patches of Fendler ceanothus were found in each of the forest 
restoration and control units (N =60).  Patches were generally no more than 2 m in area 
and comprised 1-15 Fendler ceanothus stems.  Fendler ceanothus can expand vegetatively 
and sprout from belowground branches and root crowns (Vose and White 1987, Huffman 
pers. obs.).  It is not known whether patches comprised more than one clone.  Hereafter, I 
refer to stems populations in these patches as Fendler ceanothus “plants”. Circular plots 
(1 m2) were established at the center of Fendler ceanothus patches and metal rebar was 
used to mark plot centers for relocation.  These plots were used to examine effects of 
overstory density on Fendler ceanothus growth and reproduction.   
 
I established an additional 50 Fendler ceanothus plots in each of the restoration 
units and used these to study effects of prescribed fire (N=150) and interactions with 
herbivory on growth and reproduction.  Effects of prescribed fire could only be examined 

 
80
within the thinned forest units due to extreme fuel hazard in control units.  Forest floor 
depth was estimated to the nearest 0.1 cm at plot center.  In restoration units, plots were 
randomly assigned to herbivore protection and experimental burning treatments in a 2x2 
factorial design.   
 
 
Herbivore Protection 
 
Fenced exclosures, 2x2 m in area and 1.4 m in height, were constructed in spring 
1999 around plots selected for herbivore protection.  Exclosures were made of wire fence 
(5x10 cm mesh) and T-bar posts.  The small size of the fenced area discouraged deer and 
elk from jumping over the fencing and large mammal herbivory was effectively 
eliminated within exclosures.  From 0.6-5% of terminal buds on current-year branches 
were damaged or removed, apparently by invertebrates, within exclosures across the four 
study years.   
 
Experimental Burning 
In order to burn selected plants, fire lines were constructed around all Fendler 
ceanothus plots in restoration units.  Fire lines were continuous fuel breaks approximately 
25-50 cm in width wherein all vegetation and forest floor material was removed exposing 
the mineral soil.  The area protected by fire lines, and which encompassed each Fendler 
ceanothus plot, was approximately 4 m2.  Additionally, all downed woody debris larger 
than 5 cm in diameter was removed from plots in order to control fire behavior and 
severity.   

 
81
Fendler ceanothus plots were experimentally burned in April 2000 and May 2001 
in coordination with United States Forest Service’s (USFS) broadcast burning of the 
larger forest units.  In April 2000, 24 Fendler ceanothus plots (12 protected from 
herbivores, 12 unprotected) were burned in one of the restoration units (called unit 3T).  
Drip-torches filled with a diesel-gasoline mixture were used to ignite forest floor material 
around edges of the plots and fires were allowed to burn until naturally extinguished.  
Due to extreme fire danger in spring 2000, the USFS halted all prescribed fires before I 
could complete treatments and no other plots were burned in this year.  I was able to 
resume experimental burning in May 2001.  At this time, sixty-five additional plots (33 
protected from large herbivores, 32 unprotected) were burned in the two remaining 
restoration units (called units 1T and 2T).  
Average and maximum flame lengths on plots were estimated during burning.  To 
assess fire behavior, forest floor depth on plots was measured within 2 months of burning 
following methods used at plot establishment.  Additionally, burn severity for vegetation 
and substrate was categorized using a 5-class rating system (USDI 1992; e.g., 1 = most 
severe, 5 = unburned).   
 
Fendler ceanothus Measurements   
Length and number of Fendler ceanothus stems on plots were measured in March 
1999 (pretreatment).  Subsequently, Fendler ceanothus stems were measured annually in 
September each year from 1999 to 2002.  Stem length, basal diameter, current-year 
branch length (estimated average and longest), and number of current-year branches were 
measured.  Stems were classified into relative age groups according to stem base 

 
82
characteristics (see Chapter 2 this dissertation).  First-year stems (Class-1) lacked dark 
patches of bark, were gray-green, and pubescent at the base.  Class-2 stems also lacked 
bark patches, were bright green, and generally lacked pubescence at base. Class-3 stems 
were similar in color to Class-2 stems, or yellowish, with bark patches noticeable at the 
base. Class-4 stems were dark brown to black and were fully surrounded by bark at the 
base.  Age classification allowed me to identify current-year stems and estimate stem 
recruitment.  Current-year biomass and leaf area (LA) were estimated from stem length 
relationships developed from separate destructive sampling (see Chapter 2 this 
dissertation).   
Fendler ceanothus seedling recruitment was assessed twice per year (July and 
September) and emerging seedlings were counted at each plot within the 2x2-m areas 
encompassed by fire lines and herbivore exclosures.  Emergent seedlings were identified 
by their small stature (stem diameter<0.5 mm, length<5 cm) and the presence of 
cotyledons.   
Overstory density was measured in 2001 at each plot using point sampling (Avery 
and Burkhart 1983).  Wedge prisms of 20 basal area factor (BAF) were used for tree 
tallies.  All tally trees were measured for diameter at breast height (1.37 m) and recorded 
in 4-cm diameter classes. 
 
Data Analyses 
Linear regression was used to analyze relationships between Fendler ceanothus 
growth variables and overstory density and browsing.  Significance level selected for 
regressions was 0.05.  Fendler ceanothus growth variables analyzed were stem number, 

 
83
current-year branch length (average and longest), current-year biomass, and current-year 
leaf area for each of the four years of the study.  Overstory density values were derived 
using Reineke’s stand density index (SDI; Reineke 1933) and tree diameters from point 
samples.  Browsing values were calculated as the number of current-year branches 
browsed divided by the total number of current-year branches counted on each plot.  
Additionally, relationships between SDI and net change in Fendler ceanothus aerial stem 
density (number of 2002 stems ÷ number of 1999 stems) were tested (alpha=0.05).  Data 
were natural log-transformed when examination of residual plots indicated increasing 
variance with increasing estimated values.   
One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for effects of prescribed 
burning within restoration units (no plots were burned in untreated units).  Since 
significant differences in stem number, size, and current-year biomass and leaf area had 
developed between protected and unprotected plots by the time they were burned (see 
Chapter 2 this dissertation), effects of burning were analyzed for these two groups 
separately.  Further, effects of burning were analyzed separately for the two burn years 
(2000 and 2001).  To analyze fire effects in 2000, data from burned and unburned plots in 
unit 3T were used.  To analyze fire effects in 2001, data from burned and unburned plots 
in units 1T and 2T were used.  In ANOVA tests for burn-year 2001 plots, overstory unit 
was included as a blocking factor.  Fendler ceanothus response variables analyzed were 
stem number, population change, current-year branch number and length (average and 
longest), current-year biomass, and current-year leaf area.  Data were natural-log 
transformed when necessary to normalize data distributions and homogenize variances.  
Significance level for tests was 0.05. 

 
84
Logistic regression was used to test for relationships between Fendler ceanothus 
mortality (categorical) and flame length and amount (cm) of forest floor consumed in 
burning.  Linear regression was used to analyze the relationship between seedling 
emergence and forest floor consumption.   
Seedling establishment was assessed by evaluating: (1) emergence, defined as the 
number of first-year seedlings counted on a plot. Such seedlings typically had cotyledons 
and one or more true leaves; (2) one-year survival, defined and the number of seedlings 
counted for emergence divided by the number of seedlings remaining on the same plot 
after the next growing season multiplied by 100 (e.g., [emergence 2000/remaining 2001] 
* 100); (3) two-year survival, defined as the number of seedlings counted for emergence 
divided by the number remaining on the same plot after two growing seasons multiplied 
by 100 (e.g., [emergence 2000/remaining 2002] * 100).  Two-year survival assessment 
only applied to plots in the unit (3T) that was burned in 2000. 
 
Results 
 
Overstory Density, Herbivory, and Drought  
Values for SDI ranged from 124 to 1754 across all plots (thinned and control 
forest units) sampled.  Although SDI contributed significantly (p<0.05) to models and 
was negatively related to Fendler ceanothus growth, its importance was generally low 
compared to that of Browse (proportion of current-year stems browsed) (Table 4.1).  In 
1999, a year of near normal (96%) precipitation January-September, the full model (both 
SDI and Browse included as predictors of growth) explained up to 60% of data variation.  
Neither SDI nor Browse was significantly related to number of current-year branches in 

 
85
1999 (Table 4.1).  In 2000, a drought year (63% normal precipitation January-September) 
SDI was only significantly (p<0.05) related to current-year biomass and leaf area on 
plots.  Browse in 2000 was significantly (p<0.05) related to all growth variables except 
longest current-year branch length, number of current-year branches, and current-year 
leaf area on plots (Table 4.1).  In 2001, a year of near normal (91%) precipitation, results 
were similar to those of 1999 and the full model generally provided the best predictions 
of growth (Table 4.1).  In 2002, a year of extreme drought (54% normal precipitation 
January-September) SDI was significantly related to number of current-year branches and 
current-year biomass and leaf area on plots.  Browse was not significantly (p≥0.05) 
related to any growth variable in 2002. 
Values of r-squared for growth models were generally higher in years 1999 and 
2001 than in 2000 and 2002.  Annual precipitation played a significant role in 
determining the importance of overstory tree density and browsing on Fendler ceanothus 
growth parameters.  Although only four growing seasons were available to assess the 
relationship, a significant (p<0.05) positive trend was observed between correlation 
coefficients of Fendler ceanothus growth models (current-year branch length response 
variable) and percent of average long-term precipitation for the months January-
September (Fig. 4.1).  
  
 
Experimental Burning 
In general, fire behavior and severity were similar on plots burned in 2000 and 
2001 (Table 4.2). In 2000, burning resulted in morality of 17% (4 of 24 burned) of 
ceanothus plants whereas no plants died that were not burned in forest unit 3T.  In 2001, 

 
86
32% (21 of 65) of the burned plants died whereas 5% of plants died that were not burned 
in units 1T and 2T.  For all burned plots combined, probability of mortality was 
significantly (p<0.001) related to amount of forest floor consumed (Fig. 4.2).  Probability 
of plant death increased dramatically after about 3 cm of forest floor consumption and no 
plants survived on plots where more than 6 cm of forest floor was consumed.  Mean 
amount of forest floor consumption that resulted in mortality was 4.7 cm (SE = 0.4).   
Fendler ceanothus plants died on 6 of 37 (16%) plots for which vegetation burn 
severity was rated as “scorched” (vegetation burn severity class 4; USDI 1992).  Depth of 
forest floor consumption on these plots averaged 1.3 cm (SE=0.2).  On plots for which 
vegetation burned severity was rated as “lightly burned” (vegetation burn severity class = 
3), plants died on 12 plots (28%).  On lightly burned plots, depth of forest floor 
consumption averaged 2.6 cm (SE=0.3).  Fendler ceanothus plants died on 8 of 9 (89%) 
plots for which vegetation burn severity was rated as “moderately burned” or “heavily 
burned (vegetation burn severity classes 2 and 1, respectively).  On plots for which 
vegetation burn severity was rated as class 2, mean depth of forest floor consumption was 
4.2 cm (SE=0.7) and for severity class 1, consumption averaged 5.5 cm (SE=0.5).  
Average and maximum flame lengths observed during experimental burning were not 
significantly related to Fendler ceanothus mortality.  Maximum flame lengths recorded 
were 91 and 117 cm on plots burned in 2000 and 2001, respectively.  Mean flame length 
in the two burn years ranged from 13 to 19 cm. 
Across all burned plots, 66-96% of the aerial stems died back to ground level (4-
34% escaped fire-related mortality).  On plots where burning did not result in Fendler 
ceanothus mortality, plants resprouted from aerial stem bases or belowground structures 

 
87
within about 60 days from burning.  In general, burning converted Fendler ceanothus 
patches from all-aged stem assemblages to those dominated by first-year sprouts (Figs. 
4.3 and 4.4).    
 
Protected Plots   
 
Experimental burning did not significantly (p≥0.05) affect number of stems on 
plots protected from large herbivores.  Similarly, burning did not affect net change in 
stem populations for protected plots.  Mean stem number generally increased on 
protected plots from 1999 to 2002 regardless of burning and net change ranged from 140 
to 300% across burned and unburned plots (Fig. 4.3).   
Burned Fendler ceanothus plants produced longer current-year branches than 
unburned plants one growing season after treatment (Fig. 4.5).  Current-year branches of 
burned plants were mainly sprouts originating from stem bases or belowground 
structures.  These were long stems with relatively few lateral shoots.  On protected plots 
burned in 2000, I measured current-year branches up to 43 cm in length.  
Stems of unburned plants had significantly (p<0.05) more current-year branches 
than those of burned plants one growing season after burning (Fig. 4.5).  For plots burned 
in 2000, differences in current-year branch number persisted for two growing seasons. 
More current-year branches on stems of unburned plants translated to significantly 
(p<0.05) greater current-year biomass and leaf area than on burned plants (Fig. 4.5).  No 
significant difference in current-year stem biomass was found between burned and 
unburned plants for those burned in 2000 (Fig. 4.5).  Current-year leaf area on stems was 
significantly (p<0.05) greater on unburned (95.8-138.0 cm2) than burned (40.1-59.4 cm2) 

 
88
plants one growing season after burning for both years (2000 and 2001 burns).  In 2002, 
no significant differences were found between protected burned and unburned plots for 
any variable analyzed (Fig. 4.5).   
 
Unprotected Plots   
 
On plots that were not protected from large herbivores, stem number was 
significantly greater in 2000 (pre-burn; p<0.05) and 2001 (first-year post-burn; p<0.01) 
for plots burned in 2001 (Fig. 4.4).  Although pretreatment (2000) differences were 
present, paired t-tests showed a significant (p<0.05) increase in number of stems on 
burned plots whereas stem number did not significantly (p≥0.05) change on unburned 
plots in 2001.  Stem number was not significantly (p≥0.05) different between unprotected 
burned and unburned plots in any of the four years for those burned in 2000 (Fig.4.4).  
Similar to protected plots, net change in stem populations on unprotected plots was not 
affected (p≥0.05) by burning and ranged from 120 to 140% across all unprotected burned 
and unburned plots. 
One growing season after burning, mean current-year branch length was 
significantly greater on plants burned in 2000 than unburned (Fig. 4.6).  In units burned 
in 2001, there were no significant differences in current-year branch length between 
burned and unburned plants (Fig. 4.6).  Similar to protected plots, branch number on 
unprotected plots was greater on unburned plants than burned plants one growing season 
after burning for both burn years (Fig. 4.6).  Pretreatment (1999) differences for current-
year branch number existed for those burned in 2000, however, branch number 
significantly (Mann-Whitney test; p<0.05) decreased on these burned plots but did not 

 
89
significantly change on unburned plots one growing season after prescribed fire.  
Current-year biomass was significantly (p<0.05) greater on unburned stems than burned 
stems one growing season after burning for those burned in 2001 (Fig. 4.6).  For plots 
burned in 2000, burning had no significant effect on current-year stem biomass after one 
growing season.  Current-year stem biomass was, however, significantly (p<0.05) greater 
on unburned than burned stems two growing seasons after burning (Fig. 4.6).  In 2002, no 
differences in current-year stem biomass were found between burned and unburned plots 
for either burn year.  Current-year leaf area on Fendler ceanothus stems followed a 
similar pattern as biomass showing lower values on burned stems one growing season 
after burning with no differences between burned and unburned stems in 2002. Current-
year leaf area on unprotected stems that were not burned ranged from 3.1 to 73.2 cm2 
across the four study years. 
 
Seedling Establishment   
No seedlings emerged on unburned plots in any of the four study years. On plots 
burned in 2000, seedlings emerged on nearly half (45.8%) the plots and a mean of 1.0 
(SE=0.3) seedlings per plot (2,500 seedlings per ha) occurred.  Seedlings were found on 
55% of plots burned in 2001 and emergence averaged 5.1 (SE=1.4) seedlings per plot 
(12,750 per ha).  The maximum seedling emergence occurred on a plot burned (in 2002 
where 53 seedlings (132,500 per ha) occurred.  Protection from large herbivores did not 
significantly (Mann-Whitney; p≥0.05) affect the number of seedlings per plot for either 
burn year.  Therefore, summaries for seedling emergence and survival are given for 
protected and unprotected plots combined (N=89).   

 
90
Number of seedlings emerging on plots was not significantly related to amount of 
forest floor consumed.  However, a significant (p<0.05) relationship was found between 
probability of seedling emergence on plots (proportion of plots on which seedlings 
emerged) and amount of forest floor consumed in 0.5-cm classes (Fig. 4.7).   The form of 
the relationship was quadratic (i.e., yi = b0 - b1xi
2 + b11xi); seedlings were observed on a 
relatively small proportion (0-45%) of plots with either low (<2 cm) or high (>7 cm) 
amounts of forest floor consumed.  Probability of emergence was greatest (45-100%) on 
plots with moderate (2.5-6.5 cm) amounts consumed.   
Fire severity rating also corresponded to probability of emergence.  Seedlings 
emerged on 18% (5 of 27) of the plots were rated as “scorched” (substrate burn severity 
class 4; USDI 1992).  On these plots, mean depth of forest floor consumption was 0.8 cm 
(SE=0.1).  On plots rated as “lightly burned” (severity class 3), seedlings emerged on 
66% (37 of 56) of the plots.  Mean amount of forest consumed on substrate burn severity 
class 3 plots was 2.5 cm (SE=0.2).  Seedlings emerged on 83% (5 of 6) the plots rated as 
“moderately” or “heavily burned” (severity classes 2 and 1, respectively).  On these plots, 
forest floor consumption averaged 5.6 cm (SE=0.3). 
One-year seedling survival was 26.7% (SE=9.4) on plots burned in 2000.  Live 
seedlings were found on 45% (5 of 11) of plots on which emergence was observed the 
previous year.  Mean seedling density was 0.4 per plot (SE = 0.2) (1000 per ha).   
One-year survival on plots burned in 2001 was 11.0% (SE=4.7).  Seedlings were 
found on 55% (20 of 36) of the plots where they emerged and mean density was 0.5 per 
plot (SE=0.3) (1250 per ha).  Mean first-year survival was not significantly (p≥0.05) 
affected by protection from large herbivores for plots in either burn year.   

 
91
Two-year seedling survival on plots burned in 2000 was 3.6% (SE=3.6).  In 2002, 
two seedlings remained on just one plot.  Average number of seedlings per plot was 0.08 
(SE=0.08) (200 per ha). 
 
Discussion 
Fendler ceanothus Growth as Related to Overstory Density  
 
Growth of Fendler ceanothus, in terms of current-year branch length and number 
and current-year stem biomass and leaf area, was inversely related to overstory stand 
density and browsing.  Similar results relating understory production to overstory 
structure have been reported for Arizona ponderosa pine forests (Arnold 1950, Ffolliott 
and Clary 1975, Tapia et al. 1990).   Values of SDI in this study were within the range 
reported by Moore and Deiter (1992) who found a slight negative relationship between 
Fendler ceanothus growth and overstory density in ponderosa pine forests of the North 
Kaibab National Forest in Arizona.  In my study, browsing was generally more important 
than SDI in explaining variations in Fendler ceanothus growth on plots.  In other studies, 
shrubs have been found to respond weakly to changes in ponderosa pine forest density.  
For example, Moore and Deiter (1992) found that understory response was dependent on 
functional group (i.e., grass, forb, shrub, etc.) but it was not clear if this was due to 
factors related to plant physiological characteristics or extrinsic factors such as species 
interactions.  The authors implied that domestic grazers were not present on their study 
site and elk were likely absent from their site on the North Kaibab National Forest in the 
early 1990s.  In a study of ponderosa pine stands in South Dakota, 6-8 shrub species were 
present yet only bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi), a species unavailable to browsers in 

 
92
winter due to snow cover, made significant contributions to production differences 
between overstory growing stock levels (Ursek and Severson 1989).  Patton (1974) 
reported that grass and forb production, numbers of browse plants (woody sprouts 30-137 
cm in height), and large ungulate use all increased after harvesting ponderosa pine in 
patches 2-32 acres in size.  I previously reported that Fendler ceanothus plants protected 
from large herbivores retained nearly five times more current-year biomass than plants 
exposed to browsing by mule deer and elk (Chapter 2 this dissertation).  Allen (1996) 
speculated that severely browsed Fendler ceanothus plants on a large wildfire site in New 
Mexico were the result of rapid post-fire increases in elk populations.  These results 
suggest that restoration thinning of dense forests has the potential to enhance growth of 
Fendler ceanothus plants; however, response is constrained by large ungulate herbivory.  
Herbivore preferences and changes in use patterns can result in minimal benefit from 
changes in stand density for some understory species, especially shrubs.  
 
Climate affected relationships between Fendler ceanothus growth, overstory stand 
density, and browsing.  In drought years, models were insignificant or explained no more 
than 14% of the variation in Fendler ceanothus growth (Table 4.1).  A positive linear 
association between model correlation coefficients and percent of normal precipitation 
for important months showed that effects of overstory stand density and browsing were 
muted by severe droughts in 2000 and 2002. Similarly, Fulé et al. (2002) suggested that 
droughty conditions in 2000 could have been, in part, responsible for no differences in 
understory cover between thinned and unthinned forests at Grand Canyon National Park.  
 

 
93
Vegetative Response to Prescribed Fire 
 
More than one-fourth of all Fendler ceanothus plants experimentally burned in my 
study did not resprout and mortality was positively related to amount of forest floor 
consumed.  Although maximum flame length was never greater than 117 cm, which 
indicated relatively low fire intensity (Pyne et al. 1996), lethal temperatures were 
apparently generated belowground by smoldering combustion in deep forest floor layers.  
On a similar site, Vose and White (1987, 1991) reported substantial Fendler ceanothus 
mortality (55-67%) when consumption of heavy (46.2-145.9 Mg/ha) forest floor fuel 
loads during prescribed fire was 55-95%.  Smoldering combustion in duff layers during 
prescribed fires has also been indicated as the cause of mortality for presettlement-age 
ponderosa pine trees (Covington and Sackett 1984, 1990).  Subsequently, land managers 
interested in forest restoration rake forest floor debris away from bases of presettlement 
trees before burning to reduce heat-related mortality (Fulé et al. 2001, 2002).  To reduce 
severe effects on the entire understory community, complete removal of the duff layer 
prior to initial reintroduction of surface fire has been tested (Covington et al. 1997).   It is 
clear that initial reintroductions of fire in these ponderosa pine forests with deep forest 
floor fuel accumulations can be detrimental to remnant plant communities if burn 
conditions allow high rates of fuel consumption.  Activities that result in high mortality 
of existing native plants, particularly for species that are not overabundant, may be 
counter to most ecosystem restoration goals. 
 
Fendler ceanothus plants that survived prescribed fires resprouted readily and 
aerial stem populations were converted from all-age to even-age structures.  Unburned 
populations remained all-age and stem number appeared to be stable over the four years 

 
94
of study.  Annual recruitment of new stems in burned and unburned plots appeared to 
allow persistence by replacing stems lost to mortality.  After two growing seasons, 
burned plants appeared to be regaining an all-age population structure. Sprouting and 
annual stem recruitment are important strategies for persistence in other competitive plant 
communities (Keeley 1977, Kurmis and Sucoff 1989, Huffman et al. 1994, Tappeiner et 
al. 2001).  Keely (1992) identified various vegetative strategies for shrubs after fires in 
chaparral including pulse recruitment of stems immediately after fire, continual turnover 
of stems through time similar to my findings for Fendler ceanothus, and continual stem 
recruitment with little mortality.  In general, sprout production after disturbance may be a 
viable strategy for persistence when safe sites for seedling regeneration are rare (Keeley 
1977).   
 
Persistence of Fendler ceanothus in understories may be further accomplished by 
production of long, unbranched sprouts after fire.  Vigorous production of long sprouts 
may allow plants to quickly occupy growing space.  Vose and White (1987) reported 
burned Fendler ceanothus plants were similar in size to unburned plants one year after 
fire.  In the present study, I found longer current-year branches on burned plants than 
unburned plants.  Sprouts arising from belowground buds were up to 43 cm in length.  
Throop and Fay (1999) hypothesized that long sprouts produced after fire by New Jersey 
Tea (Ceanothus herbaceous) could confer reproductive advantage over seedling 
establishment since stem size is often positively related to flowering.  Indeed, in Chapter 
2 of this dissertation, I found that more than 80% of Fendler ceanothus stems producing 
flowers were relatively large (>30 cm length; >4 mm diameter).  In the present study, 
there were fewer current-year branches and less biomass and leaf area on burned plants 

 
95
than unburned plants but these differences were short-lived.  Rapid recovery of Fendler 
ceanothus to pre-burn size and production may allow this species to persist in understory 
communities that naturally burned at intervals less than 20 years before Euro-American 
settlement of the region.   
 
Regeneration from Seed  
 
Similar to plant survival, probability of Fendler ceanothus seedling emergence 
was related to depth of forest floor consumed during experimental burns.  Probability of 
emergence was greatest at moderate depths (>2 and <7 cm) of consumption.  Dormant 
Fendler ceanothus seeds in soil seed banks were apparently stimulated to germinate after 
exposure to heat from fire (Story 1974, Krishnan 1989).  Although no attempt was made 
to correlate fire behavior and emergence, Vose and White (1991) reported fewer Fendler 
ceanothus seedlings on plots where fire intensities were low (open sawtimber) than on 
plots with high fuel loads and heat yield (below canopy sawtimber and pole).  Other 
Ceanothus species utilize a similar buried seed strategy and can form extensive brush 
fields on severely burned sites (Gratkowski 1974, Keeley 1977, Noste 1985, Conard et al. 
1985, Keeley 1992).   
 
I did not measure temperature profiles in forest floor and soils, although 
temperature required to break seed coat dormancy and stimulate germination is around 
90ºC (see Chapter 3 this dissertation.  Story (1974) reported germination of Fendler 
ceanothus seeds after treating with boiling water (100ºC).  Quick (1935) found 
temperature and cold stratification requirements varied for several Ceanothus species; 
some species showed negative responses to low (>70ºC) levels of heat.  Gratkowski 

 
96
(1974) found optimal temperatures for germination of mountain whitethorn (Ceanothus 
cordulatus) ranged between 90 and 105ºC.  Conard et al. (1985) generalized that 
temperatures greater than 120ºC are lethal to Ceanothus seeds, which is supported by my 
research with Fendler ceanothus (see Chapter 3 this dissertation). 
 
Management Implications  
 
My results indicate that tree reduction and prescribed fire treatments used to 
restore ponderosa pine forest ecosystems have potential to increase Fendler ceanothus 
growth and reproduction.  Large herbivores, however, such as mule deer and Rocky 
Mountain elk, and drought limit Fendler ceanothus response to forest treatments.  
Protection of understory plants against large herbivores could allow plants to retain 
greater current-season production and accelerate understory development.  Although my 
study did not address operational-scale herbivore protection, use of logging slash (e.g. 
tree limbs and tops) to influence ungulate movement patterns and browse availability 
could be tested where desired or sensitive understory species are present.   
 
Effects of fire on demographic structure of Fendler ceanothus populations depend 
on depth of forest floor consumed during burning.  Preburn fuel measurements can be 
used to develop burn plans that encourage Fendler ceanothus sprouting and seeding 
establishment and limit detrimental effects.  As additional programs are established to 
restore ecological function in ponderosa pine forest ecosystems, further research should 
examine response patterns for other important understory species.

CHAPTER 5: POPULATION DYNAMICS OF FENDLER CEANOTHUS: 
SIMULATION OF FOREST RESTORATION SCENARIOS    
 
Abstract 
Plant population models provide insight concerning plant life history patterns and 
life stage transitions important for persistence and recovery in changing environments 
and are valuable tools for assessing ecological tradeoffs between forest management 
approaches.  In order to evaluate a set of ecological restoration alternatives, I constructed 
simple stage-based models and simulated 25-year dynamics for Fendler ceanothus 
(Ceanothus fendleri Gray), a shrub common in understories of ponderosa pine (Pinus 
ponderosa Laws.) forests of the southwestern United States.  I tested the following 
management scenarios: 1) control (no forest or shrub treatments); 2) overstory thinning 
(NCNB); 3) overstory thinning plus prescribed fire (NCB); 4) overstory thinning plus 
protection from large herbivores (CNB); and 5) overstory thinning, prescribed fire, and 
protection from large herbivores (CB).  I also analyzed effects of fire return intervals (2-, 
5-, 10-, and 25-year) on protected and not protected populations.  Results showed that CB 
populations had more than 20-times the abundance of aerial stems and more even life 
stage distribution (J′=0.657) than control (J′=0.105) populations.  Elasticity analyses 
indicated that vegetative stem recruitment was most important for growth of CB 
populations whereas seed survival was most important for persistence of control 
populations.  Populations in management scenarios that did not include protection from 
herbivores did not differ in abundance from control populations although burning 
resulted in greater life stage evenness due to emergence of seedlings from dormant seed 

 
114
banks.  For protected populations, burning at 2-year frequencies increased abundance and 
life stage evenness compared with longer return intervals.  For populations not protected 
from herbivores, high fire frequency resulted in population decline.  These results suggest 
that forest restoration treatments and herbivory interact to affect long-term population 
dynamics of Fendler ceanothus.   
 
Introduction 
Life history traits help determine plant survival, growth, and reproduction in 
changing environments.  In particular, regeneration strategies, such as resprouting and 
seed production, play a large role in determining plant population dynamics and structure 
after disturbances or for persistence in highly competitive environments (Bellingham and 
Sparrow 2000).  For example, shrubs in fire-prone environments are commonly classified 
by regeneration response after fire (Keeley 1977, 1998).  Although life history traits are 
of primary importance in dictating population dynamics, demographic patterns are often 
affected by disturbances such as herbivory (Bullock 1991).  Herbivory can affect (both 
positively and negatively) plant flowering, seed production, and vegetative recruitment 
(Paige and Whitham 1987, Stein et al. 1992, Augustine and Frelich 1998, Throop and Fay 
1999, Ch 2 this dissertation).  Because herbivory often affects reproductive processes, 
assessment of population-level effects of herbivory is best conducted over multiple 
generations (Verkaar 1987).  Understanding regeneration strategies and long-term 
population dynamics of key species in changing environments is of special importance to 
ecologists and land managers engaged in forest restoration programs.  In ponderosa pine 
(Pinus ponderosa Laws.) forests, where ecological restoration treatments are urgently 

 
115
needed (Covington and Moore 1994, Moore et al. 1999), population modeling may be a 
valuable tool for assessing long-term effects of management alternatives.        
Treatments aimed at restoring more natural conditions to ponderosa forests are 
underway on many sites in the southwestern United States (Covington et al. 1997, Fulé et 
al. 2002, Allen et al. 2002).  Forest tree densities in this forest type have increased by an 
order of magnitude or more over the last century due to harvesting of large trees, 
intensive livestock grazing, and elimination of frequent surface fires (Covington and 
Moore 1994, Fulé et al. 1997, Mast et al. 1999, Allen et al. 2002, Moore et al. in press).  
Dense forests and exclusion of surface fire have reduced understory plant community 
diversity and abundance, slowed nutrient cycles, lowered habitat quality for various 
wildlife species, and created an environment ripe for occurrence of devastating 
crownfires (Covington and Moore 1994, Covington et al. 1997, Kaye and Hart 1998, 
Covington et al. 2001, Fulé et al. 2001).  Thus primary goals for restoration programs are 
to reverse these trends and reestablish forest structural attributes and process that are 
more like those that prevailed prior to degradation (Moore et al. 1999).  
Although debate continues regarding details of treatment implementation, most 
ecological restoration approaches call for decreasing tree density, usually by thinning 
trees in younger age classes, and reintroduction of surface fire (Allen et al. 2002).  
Treatment options that have been tested include overstory thinning alone, use of fire 
alone, and combinations of thinning intensities and prescribed fire (Sackett et al. 1996, 
Covington et al. 1997, Allen et al. 2002, Fulé et al. 2002).  In general, understory 
communities in these forests increase production after overstory thinning and low-
intensity fire (Jameson 1967, Ffolliott and Clary 1975, Uresk and Severson 1989, Moore 

 
116
and Deiter 1992, Covington et al. 1997).  Little is known, however, concerning the long-
term dynamics of plant populations in response to these management activities.   
 
 
Ecology of Fendler ceanothus  
 
Fendler ceanothus (Ceanothus fendleri Gray) is a common shrub found 
throughout northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests.  It is an important species in 
understory communities; it is actinorhizal and capable of nitrogen-fixation (Story 1974), 
provides important browse for ungulates such as mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and 
elk (Cervus elaphus) (Urness et al. 1975, Allen 1996, Ch 2 this dissertation), and 
provides structural heterogeneity in the predominantly herbaceous understories of these 
forests.   
Fendler ceanothus is a small shrub that grows up to 1.5 m in height.  It forms 
discrete patches of up to 104 aerial stems m-2.  Aerial stems are produced annually or 
semiannually from belowground buds on branches and root crowns.  Fendler ceanothus 
also resprouts after fire from these belowground buds and from stem bases (Vose and 
White 1987, Chapter 4 this dissertation).  Undisturbed patches of aerial stems are 
typically all-aged whereas populations produced from resprouting after low-severity fire 
or similar disturbances are even-aged for at least the first year (Chapter 4 this 
dissertation).  Fendler ceanothus is somewhat sensitive to heat and moderate-intensity fire 
can cause mortality (Chapter 4 this dissertation).  Sprouting after low-severity fire can be 
prolific and stem populations can increase in density compared with pre-fire stem 
numbers (Chapter 4 this dissertation).  Sprouts produced after fire are typically long and 
generally unbranched, often reaching lengths similar to undisturbed stems within one 
growing season (Chapter 4 this dissertation).  Intense herbivory can dramatically reduce 

 
117
stem length, current-year branch production, and recruitment of new vegetative stems 
(Chapter 2).  Overstory density also negatively affects aerial stem density in Fendler 
ceanothus patches.    
 
Flowering of Fendler ceanothus begins in mid June.  Flowers are borne in 
panicles on stems usually greater than 20 cm in length (Chapter 2 this dissertation).  
Flower production appears to depend on stem age and size (Chapter 2 this dissertation).  
Small, browsed stems, and resprouts arising immediately after fire, have not been 
observed to flower (Chapter 4 this dissertation).  Fruit set typical occurs in Mid July to 
early August.  Like flowering, fruit production is positively related to stem size.  Fruits 
are 3-celled capsules and seed dispersal is by ballistic expulsion as fruits dehisce in late 
August to early September.   
 
Fendler ceanothus appears to utilize a dormant seed strategy and seedling 
emergence is often observed after fire (Vose and White 1991, Chapter 4 this dissertation). 
Seeds are ~ 2 mm in diameter and a dark, glossy brown when fully developed.  Most 
seeds in an annual cohort require heat to germinate although some seeds can germinate 
without heat (Ch 3 this dissertation).  Seeds enter the soil seed bank and apparently 
remain dormant until moderate-intensity fire allows germination (Huffman unpublished 
data).  Seed germination is enhanced by exposure to temperatures of 70-100º C (Story 
1974, Krishnan 1989, Chapter 3 this dissertation).  After low-severity fire, seedlings 
emerge with the onset of seasonal monsoon rains in late July or August.  Seed longevity 
under field conditions is not known.  Specific microsite characteristics that affect 
seedling survival have not been studied.  Seedlings can reach heights of 20 cm by their 

 
118
second growing season (Huffman unpublished data) although time or size required for 
seedlings to attain sexual maturity is not known.    
My objectives in this study were the following: 1) construct stage-based 
population models for Fendler ceanothus from demographic field data collected 1999-
2002 (Chapters 2, 3, and 4 this dissertation); and 2) analyze relative effects of forest 
restoration alternatives (i.e., overstory thinning and prescribed fire), and interactions with 
ungulate herbivory, on long-term population dynamics.  Analysis of effects of restoration 
treatment on plant population dynamics can help resource managers refine management 
approaches and better understand community patterns.  Further, these studies can 
illuminate important life history traits and stage transitions that facilitate population 
persistence under varying environmental conditions.     
   
Methods 
Demographic and Life Stage Data 
 
I collected demographic and life stage data 1999-2002 on field plots and in 
laboratory studies for modeling Fendler ceanothus population dynamics.  These studies 
were described in earlier chapters (Chapters 2, 3, and 4) of this dissertation.  Field plots 
were located on the Fort Valley Experimental Forest in northern Arizona (35º 16’ N, 111º 
41’ W).  Overstories of forest units were comprised of nearly pure stands of ponderosa 
pine.  Understories were sparse and comprised of mainly the grasses (e.g., Festuca 
arizonica, Muhlenbergia montana, and Elymus elymoides) and the forbs (e.g., Lupinus 
spp., Antenaria spp., and Erigeron spp.).  Scattered populations of shrubs included 
mainly Fendler ceanothus, and woods rose Rosa woodsii.   

 
119
 
Sixty plots (1 m2) centered on patches of Fendler ceanothus stems were 
established in three forest units (~14 ha in size) in 1999.  Overstory trees in these units 
were thinned from below 1998-1999 as part of a larger forest restoration experiment (see 
Fulé et al. 2001).  Overstory density after thinning ranged from 177 to 310 trees per 
hectare (TPH) (tree quadratic mean diameter (QMD) was 36-45 cm at 1.37 m height 
above ground).  Thinned units were broadcast burned by the U.S. Forest Service in spring 
(April-May) 2000 and 2001.   
 
Fendler ceanothus plots in the thinned units were randomly assigned to one of 
four treatments in a 2x2 factorial design.  Treatments were protection from large 
herbivores (exclosures), and experimental burning.  Treatments were applied on 2x2-m 
areas centered on Fendler ceanothus plots.  Large ungulate exclosures were built around 
30 plots per unit (N=90) in spring 1999.  Experimental burning of plots (24-35 plots per 
unit) was done in spring 2000 and 2001 (see Chapter 4 this dissertation).   
I also established 10 plots in each of three forest units that were not thinned 
(“Control”).  Overstory densities in Control units ranged from 984-3450 TPH (QMD=19-
26 cm).   Control units were not burned and Fendler ceanothus plots in these units were 
neither protected from large herbivores nor experimentally burned.  
 
Demographic characteristics of Fendler ceanothus stem populations were 
measured on plots 1999-2002.  In June each year, I visited plots and tallied flowering 
stems (Chapter 2 this dissertation).  I returned to plots in July to assess fruit production 
and install seed traps around fruiting stems to estimate seed production (Chapter 3 this 
dissertation).  In September, I tallied total number of stems on plots and collected seed 
traps. At each field measurement throughout the growing season, I searched plots for 

 
120
seedlings.  Seedlings were identified by their size at emergence (<4 cm height) and 
presence of cotyledons.  When found, seedlings on plots were mapped to allow 
subsequent assessment of survival (see Chapter 4 this dissertation).   
 
Viable seed production per stem was estimated in the laboratory by dissecting 
seeds from seed traps and tallying the number filled. To estimate the number of seeds 
successfully dispersed, I experimentally tested post-dispersal seed predation (Chapter 3 
this dissertation).  Ten seed depots were installed along one 250-m transect in each 
treated (thinned and burned) forest unit (2000 and 2001).  Fendler ceanothus seeds were 
placed in Petri dishes and left at depots for 8-10 days.  At the end of this period, dishes 
were collected and seed removal was assessed.  Seed germination characteristics, 
including response to heat and cold stratification, were determined in the laboratory 
(Chapter 3 this dissertation).  
Treatment combinations imposed on Fendler ceanothus plots allowed me to 
model population dynamics for five distinct management scenarios.  Scenarios were the 
following: 1) no thinning, no herbivore protection, and no burning (Control); 2) overstory 
thinning, no herbivore protection, and no burning (no cage, no burn; NCNB), 3) 
overstory thinning, no herbivore protection, and experimental burning (no cage, burn; 
NCB); 4) overstory thinning, herbivore protection, and no burning (cage, no burn; CNB); 
and 5) overstory thinning, herbivore protection, and experimental burning (cage, burn; 
CB).

Simulation Models  
Transition Matrices 
 
To model management effects on population dynamics, the life cycle of Fendler 
ceanothus was simplified into four discrete stages: seed, seedling, vegetative adult, and 
reproductive adult (Fig. 5.1).  Since the species sprouts from belowground branches and 
identification of individual plants was problematic without excavation, aerial stems were 
selected as the unit of analysis for population modeling.  Stage-based transition matrices 
(Caswell 2001) were built from 1999-2002 field and laboratory data (Table 5.1).   
 
Vital Rates 
 
Vital rates are probabilities for survival and transition into subsequent life stages. 
I calculated vital rates for stage elements as the average of the annual changes for each 
life stage transition over the four years of field study (Table 5.2).  Each forest unit was 
treated as a separate and independent population. Vital rates for stage transitions were 
determined by analyzing changes in total numbers of seedlings and aerial stems within 
forest units.  Calculations and assumptions are described as follows: 
1) Seed germination of Fendler ceanothus is facilitated by heat (~70-100ºC; see 
Chapter 3 this dissertation).  In field studies (see Chapter 4 this dissertation), I 
observed no seedlings over four years on unburned plots and I assumed that 
seed dormancy was high in seed banks.  Seeds of other ceanothus species are 
thought to remain viable in seed banks for decades (Conard et al. 1985).  
Thus, I assumed little seed mortality over 25 years for seed banks and set seed 

 
122
survival rate (P1) for no-burn scenarios to 0.99.  Further, I set seed-seedling 
transition (G1) for no-burn scenarios (i.e., Control, NCNB, and CNB) to 0.01 
(non-zero vital rates allowed a somewhat conservative approach to projection 
of population dynamics).  Seed-seedling vital rate for scenarios that included 
prescribed fire (i.e., CNB, CB) was set to 0.60.  This value was the average 
germination rate found for seeds from the Fort Valley site exposed to 90ºC 
heat (10 minute duration) in laboratory studies (Chapter 3 this dissertation).  
Seed survival (P1) for prescribed fire scenarios, was set to 0.10. 
2) Probability for seedling-seedling (P2) transitions was average one-year 
survival observed in the field (Chapter 4 this dissertation). Although survival 
was nil in one unit, I set the minimum probability for P2 to 0.01.  The highest 
one-year survival was 0.267.  I did not have two-year survival rates for two 
forest units where plots were burned in 2001.  Therefore, I used average 2-
year seedling survival from one unit as the best approximation of transition 
vital rate (0.061) for seedling-vegetative adult (G2) for all units.  I did not 
observe flower production for any seedlings over the study period although 
seedlings can begin to develop adult-like morphological characteristics, such 
as thick (>2 mm) stem bases and heights of up to 20 cm, within two years of 
emergence (Huffman pers. obs.). There is evidence that seedlings of at least 
one species of ceanothus (Ceanothus integerrimus H. & A.) can produce 
flowers within three growing seasons and new vegetative stems and root 
crowns within one growing season (McDonald et al. 1998).  In my model, I 

 
123
assumed very few seedlings transitioned to reproductive stems (G4) in two 
years and thus set G4 values to 0.01 for simulations. 
3) Probability of vegetative stem survival (P3) was calculated as Vti+1/ Vti; where 
Vti = number of non-flowering stems tallied on plots in year i.  Range of 
values for P3 was 0.44-2.53 (vegetative regeneration allowed P3 > 1.0).  
4) Transition from vegetative to reproductive adult stem (G3) was calculated as 
Rti+1/Vti; where Rti+1 = number of flower-producing stems in year i + 1.  No 
flowering stems were observed in Control units in any of the four study years 
(Chapter 4 this dissertation).  Similar to other low vital rates, I set G3 for 
Control units to 0.01.  Survival of reproductive stems (P4) was calculated as 
Rti+1/Rti.  Since previous studies indicated that flowering and fruit production 
was related to stem size and age, I assumed that, once stems were observed 
flowering, little retrogression (G5) to vegetative stage occurred.  Thus, I set G5 
values to 0.01 for all simulations. 
5) Fendler ceanothus fertility (F1; the number of seeds successfully dispersed) 
was estimated from previously described studies of seed production.  Values 
used in matrices for this study reflected production of developed seeds minus 
losses due to predispersal parasitism and post-dispersal predation (Chapter 3 
this dissertation). The number of seeds per stem used to estimate fertility was 
16.1 (Table 5.2).  
  

 
124
Model Projections 
 
Population dynamics of Fendler ceanothus were modeled for the five management 
scenarios using the computer software RAMAS Metapop (Akçakaya 1998).  Transition 
matrices were projected using the general population growth model: 
Nt+1 = A(Nt) 
where: N = population size; t = time, and A = matrix of vital rates.  Time step used was 
one year and duration (time period of projection) modeled was 25 years.  For each 
population, 1,000 model simulations were run.   
 
Environmental stochasticity was incorporated into model projections by inputting 
matrices of vital rate standard deviations (Akçakaya 1998).  For invariable vital rates 
(e.g., P1 and G1) standard deviations were set to 0.01. 
 
Populations among field units varied in size (25-218 aerial stems) and were 
initially (1999) dominated by vegetative stems (i.e., no seedlings or reproductive stems.  
Thus, in order to make reasonable comparisons between management scenarios a 
hypothetical population structure was constructed and used for all projections.  This 
initial population represented a diverse structure with all life stages in the following 
abundances: seeds=500; seedlings=100; vegetative stems=50; reproductive stems=25.  
This starting point allowed me to fairly judge effects of management scenarios on 
population characteristics such as relative abundance of life stages.   It should be noted 
that initial population structure does not affect estimates of finite rate of increase (λ) 
(Silvertown and Charlesworth 2001),  
A carrying capacity (K) value of 2500 was used as a population “ceiling” to 
simulate density-dependent effects.  Although population responses of Fendler ceanothus 

 
125
to increasing density are not known, this ceiling roughly allowed a quadrupling of 
population size from initial conditions. Density dependence affected all vital rates as 
population size approached K (Akçakaya 1998).   
 
Prescribed burning scenarios were modeled by treating fire as a “catastrophe” 
(Akçakaya 1998).  For comparisons of management scenarios, probability of fire was set 
to 0.20 to simulate a five-year burn interval.  This probability corresponded with 
presettlement fire return intervals found on nearby sites and restoration management 
alternatives that include frequent application of prescribed fire (Covington et al. 1997).  
In years when fire occurred, matrix element multipliers were used to adjust vital rates to 
reflect values derived from field and laboratory observations of fire response (Chapters 3 
and 4 this dissertation).  Important fire effects included increased seed germination from 
seed banks (G1), reduced survival of seedlings (P2), and reduced probability of transition 
from vegetative to reproductive stems (G3).  Since my field studies indicated that these 
fire effects were short-lived and observable in the growing season immediately after 
burning, vital rates in years without fire remained the same as for unburned plots. 
 
In addition to modeling population dynamics within the five basic management 
scenarios, I also examined effects of fire frequency and herbivory on population structure 
and abundance.  Model parameters described above were held constant for NCB and CB 
scenarios while probability of fire was varied.  Fire probabilities (Pr=0.5, 0.2, 0.1, and 
0.04) simulated burn frequencies of 2, 5, 10, and 25 years.  Population dynamics were 
simulated as described above for other scenarios. 
 

 
126
Statistical Analysis 
 
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate differences in population 
characteristics resulting from management scenarios.  Model output averages for 
populations in each forest unit were used as replicates (n=3) for each management 
scenario.  Parameters tested were: 1) finite rate of increase (λ); 2) population size (i.e., 
sum abundance of all stages); 3) total number of plants (i.e., sum all stages minus 
abundance of seeds); and 4) relative abundance of each life stage in modeled populations 
(i.e., number of individuals in a given life stage divided by total number of individuals in 
the population).  Additionally, I tested effects of management scenarios on evenness of 
life stage distribution.  Evenness was calculated as: J′=H′/H′max; where: H′=Shannon’s 
Index of Diversity, and H′max=maximum value for H′ (Hunter 1990).  When main 
effects (p<0.05) were found in ANOVAs, Bonferroni adjusted pairwise comparisons 
were used to test for differences among management scenario means (Kuehl 1994). 
 
 
Similar analyses were conducted to test effects of fire frequency and herbivory on 
population dynamics.  ANOVA was used to examine main effects (p<0.05) of fire 
frequency on population size, relative abundance of life stages within populations, and 
life stage evenness.  Post-hoc tests of mean differences were conducted using Bonferroni 
adjusted pairwise comparisons.  
 
Results 
Effects of Forest Thinning, Fire, and Herbivory on Population Structure 
 
Mean finite rate of increase (λ) was significantly (p<0.05) greater for scenarios 
that included protection from large herbivores (CNB, CB; λ=1.33) than those that did not 

 
127
include protection (Control, NCNB, NCB).  There was no significant (p>0.05) difference 
in λ between Control (λ=0.99) and NCNB (or NCB) scenarios (λ=1.06) (Table 5.3).  
Prescribed fire was modeled as a probabilistic event that only affected vital rates during 
the year of occurrence.  Furthermore, λ was calculated using vital rate matrices and 
calculations did not include matrices used to adjust vital rates for simulation of fire 
effects.  Therefore, adding fire to a management scenario (i.e., protection and no 
protection from herbivores) did not change model estimates of λ relative to those that did 
not include burning.  Population trajectories, however, showed considerably different 
patterns among the five management scenarios (Fig. 5.2).   
 
At the end of the 25-year duration, abundance was greater (p<0.05) for 
populations with herbivore protection with no burning (CNB) than Control and no 
herbivore protection with burning (NCB) scenarios (Table 5.4).  Similarly, CB 
(protection and burning) and NCNB (no protection, no burning) had significantly 
(p<0.05) greater total abundance than NCB.  Scenarios NCNB, CNB, and CB generally 
increased population abundance over the 25-year simulation whereas populations in 
Control and NCB scenarios declined (Fig. 5.2).  Population size of NCNB, CNB, and CB 
doubled in roughly 2-5 years.  Mean size of CNB populations tripled in about 3 years. 
 
Relative abundance of life stages in populations was also affected by management 
scenarios.  Although most populations were dominated by dormant seeds, NCB 
populations had significantly (p<0.05) fewer seeds than all other scenarios with the 
exception of Control (Fig. 5.3).  Relative to total population size, NCB and CB 
populations had significantly (p<0.05) fewer seeds in comparison with other scenarios 
(Fig. 5.3).  Control populations had less than 3% of their total abundance comprised by 

 
128
life stages other than seeds.  Significantly (p<0.05) more seedlings were found for CB 
populations than all other scenarios, which were statistically similar (Fig. 5.3).  
Populations of NCB and CB scenarios had a significantly (p<0.05) greater proportion of 
their total abundance comprised of seedlings than other scenarios (Table 5.4).  Similar 
(p>0.05) numbers of vegetative stems were found for all scenarios (Fig. 5.3).  As a 
proportion of total population size, however, NCB had significantly (p<0.05) greater 
relative abundance of vegetative stems than Control and CNB populations (Table 5.4).  
Populations in the CB scenario had a significantly greater mean number of reproductive 
stems than all other scenarios (Fig. 5.3).  Additionally, populations in the CNB scenario 
had significantly more reproductive stems than other scenarios with the exception of CB.  
A significantly (p<0.05) greater relative abundance of reproductive stems was present in 
CB populations than those of other scenarios (Table 5.4).   
 
Structural diversity differed among the five management scenarios showed (Table 
5.4).  Evenness of life stages among the populations was greatest for NCB and CB 
scenarios.  These two scenarios showed evenness values greater than 65% of the 
theoretical maximum (H′ max; see Hunter 1990) for a completely even population.  In 
contrast, evenness for Control, NCNB, and CNB scenarios showed values 10.5-24.5% of 
H′ max.  
 
Proportional sensitivity of λ to small changes in life stage vital rates is expressed 
as model elasticities (Caswell 2001).  Examination of elasticities suggested differences 
among management scenarios for model sensitivity to life stage transitions (Table 5.5).  
For example, λ for the Control scenario was nearly completely dependent on transition 
values for P1 (seed survival) whereas other matrix elements made relatively small 

 
129
contributions to λ.  In contrast, λ for the other management scenarios was relatively less 
sensitive to changes in P1 than the Control scenario and more sensitive to changes in P3 
(vegetative stem survival and recruitment).   
 
Fire Frequency and Herbivory 
  
 
Fire frequency and protection from herbivores interacted to affect Fendler 
ceanothus population size and structure.  Total population abundance of both protected 
and not protected populations was significantly (p<0.05) greater for the lowest 
probability of fire (Pr=0.04; i.e., 25-year simulated frequency) than for the highest 
probability (Pr=0.50; i.e., 2-year simulated frequency) (Table 5.6).  Population 
trajectories, however, showed different patterns for protected and not-protected plots 
within the four fire frequencies (Fig. 5.4).  Protected populations increased from initial 
size over the 25-year simulation for all fire frequencies simulated.  Populations that were 
not protected from herbivores generally decreased in abundance for simulations of 2-year 
and 5-year fire frequencies.  A fire probability of 0.50 (i.e., 2-year frequency) was 
associated with a drastic population decline (Fig. 5.4).  For longer fire return periods (i.e., 
10-year and 25-year frequencies), populations that were not protected increased in 
abundance.   
 
In addition to patterns observed for population trajectories, interactions between 
fire frequency and protection from herbivores were observed in life stage abundances 
(Fig. 5.5). Both protected and not-protected populations showed a pattern of increasing 
seed abundance with decreasing fire frequency.  Protected populations had significantly 
(p<0.05) more seeds than not-protected populations at fire frequencies of 2 and 5 years 

 
130
(Fig. 5.5).  Similarly, relative abundance of dormant seeds in populations decreased with 
increasing fire frequency (Table 5.6).  Seedling abundance tended to decline for protected 
populations as fire frequency decreased (Fig. 5.5).  In contrast, seedling abundance 
increased with decreasing fire frequency for populations that were not protected from 
herbivores.  Significantly (p<0.05) more seedlings were present in protected populations 
than not-protected populations for 2-year fire frequencies but there were no differences 
when fire was less frequent (Fig. 5.5).  Similarly, relative abundance of seedlings of 
protected populations was significantly (p<0.05) greater for a frequency of 2 years than 
for a 25-year frequency (Table 5.6).  No significant (p≥0.05) differences were found 
among fire frequencies for relative abundance of seedlings in populations not protected 
from herbivores (Table 5.6).  Similar interactions between herbivore protection and fire 
frequency were found for abundance of vegetative and reproductive stems (Fig. 5.5).  
Abundance of these stages tended to decrease with decreasing fire frequency for 
protected populations whereas, for not-protected populations, abundance increased as fire 
frequency decreased (Fig. 5.5). 
 
Evenness of life stages decreased with decreasing fire frequencies for populations 
protected from herbivores (Table 5.6).  Evenness was significantly greater for frequencies 
of 2 and 5 years than for a 25 year frequency.  No differences were found for population 
evenness among fire frequencies for populations not protected from herbivores (Table 
5.6).

Discussion 
Management Alternatives 
 
My results suggest that Fendler ceanothus populations benefit from restoration 
treatments that include overstory thinning, prescribed fire, and protection from large 
mammal herbivory.  In CB populations burned at 5-year frequency, more than 20 times 
more aerial stems were present at the end of the 25-year simulation than in Control 
populations.  The aboveground fraction of CB populations was even larger when burn 
frequency was two years.  For CB populations burned at 2-5-year frequencies, aerial 
stems were distributed evenly among life stages compared with Control populations.  
Large populations of aerial stems in CB populations resulted from three main processes: 
1) seedling emergence (G1=0.60) in years of fire; 2) recruitment of vegetative stems from 
belowground buds in years without fire (P3=1.11-1.37) and increased recruitment from 
resprouts in years with fire (P3=1.40-2.50); and 3) recruitment of reproductive stems 
(G3=0.18-0.80) in years without fire.   Elasticity analysis showed that recruitment of 
vegetative stems was most important in affecting finite rate of increase for CB 
populations.  These patterns differed substantially from those of Control populations, 
which had little seedling emergence, declining vegetative stem numbers, and little 
reproductive stem recruitment.  Elasticity analysis for Control populations showed that 
seed survival in seed banks was most important for population persistence.  
Although increased abundance of Fendler ceanothus after fire has been previously 
reported (Pearson et al. 1972), effects of disturbance and forest management practices on 
population structure has been minimally researched.  After thinning, increased aerial stem 
recruitment might be expected since other studies in ponderosa pine forests have shown 

 
132
negative relationships between overstory density and understory production (Arnold 
1950, Ffolloitt and Clary 1975, Tapia et al. 1990, Moore and Deiter 1992).  Similarly, 
aerial stem density in clonal shrub patches of other ecosystems has been shown to be 
greater in thinned forests than in unthinned forests (Tappeiner et al. 1991, Huffman et al. 
1994, Huffman and Tappeiner 1997, Tappeiner et al. 2001).  Tappeiner et al. (2001) 
hypothesized that reduced annual production of aerial stems in populations of 
salmonberry (Rubus spectabilis Pursh) and salal (Gaultheria shallon Pursh) growing in 
dense coastal Northwest forests of was likely due to low levels of nonstructural 
carbohydrates in rhizome and low rhizome density as compared with thinned forests.  In 
forests that have been burned, seedling recruitment might be expected since seed 
germination is stimulated by heat (Chapter 3 this dissertation).  Vose and White (1991) 
found both resprouts and seedlings of Fendler ceanothus after prescribed burning in 
ponderosa pine forests that had not been thinned, although in their study population 
abundance generally decreased.  In my study, low rates of aerial stem survival and 
reproductive stem recruitment in Control (not thinned) units were likely due to 
competitive and amensalistic effects of dense forest overstories. I was not able to evaluate 
effects of fire in unthinned forests.   
In my study, populations that were not protected from large herbivores showed no 
difference in aerial stem or seed abundance after 25-year simulations than populations in 
the Control scenario.  Other studies in southwestern ponderosa pine forests have shown 
that intense deer and elk herbivory can lead to decreased stem recruitment and flower 
production for various woody species (Stein et al. 1992, Strohmeyer and Maschinski 
1996, Ch 2 this dissertation).  It is clear that selective browsing by ungulates can limit 

 
133
stem size, reduce leaf area, remove floral buds, and constrain vegetative regeneration of 
plants in many western ecosystems (Debyle 1985, Dunlap 1988, Hoffman and Wambolt, 
Kay 1997, Oppermann and Merenlender 2000).  These results suggest that intense 
herbivory can limit any beneficial effects that may be associated with overstory thinning 
and prescribed burning.  Further, populations not protected from herbivores may, in fact 
decline, if fire is applied frequently (2-5 yr) as a management alternative.  Protecting 
Fendler ceanothus from herbivores allowed plants to complete life cycles whereas 
populations not protected had low recruitment of reproductive stems, which apparently 
lead to depletion of seed banks in frequent fire scenarios.  
 
  
Life History Strategies 
 
Analysis of population dynamics under simulated management scenarios provided 
insight regarding Fendler ceanothus’ life history and strategies for persistence.  Sprouting 
and seedling establishment from a dormant seed bank appears to allow this species to 
persist under a wide range of overstory and disturbance conditions.  For example, under 
dense overstory conditions with infrequent disturbance (e.g., Control scenario), 
aboveground stems decline yet dormant seeds provide potential for site recolonization.  
This strategy is known for other species of ceanothus in ecosystems characterized by 
infrequent and/or high intensity fire regimes (Gratkowski 1974, Keeley 1977, Noste 
1985, Montygierd-Loyba and Keeley 1987, Morgan and Neuenschwander 1988, Keeley 
1992).  For example, Gratkowski (1974) described dense stands of ceanothus cordulatus 
that develop after overstory cutting and slash burning in mixed conifer forests of the 
Pacific Northwest.  In these forests, reproductive plants are typically absent from 

 
134
understories before disturbance.  Similarly, post-fire seedling emergence of Fendler 
ceanothus has been noted on sites where adult plants were scarce before fire (Vose and 
White 1987, Huffman pers. obs.).   
 
 
In addition to a dormant seed strategy, Fendler ceanothus can persist under open 
overstories in the absence of disturbance (e.g., NCNB and CNB scenarios).  This appears 
to be facilitated by two processes: 1) frequent vegetative production of aerial stems from 
belowground buds (Chapter 4 this dissertation), and 2) stems that can live for four years 
or more (Huffman unpublished data).  Similarly, Ceanothus spinosus periodically recruits 
aerial stems in chaparral communities and stem populations are uneven-aged more than 
50 years after fire (Keeley 1992).  Ceanothus greggii establishes from dormant seed after 
fire and its stems can persist for at least 90 years in the absence of disturbance (Keeley 
1977).  In contrast, Ceanothus megacarpus stands develop after fire from dormant seed 
banks yet, in the absence of fire, populations of this species apparently decline from 
density dependent competition and infrequent vegetative stem recruitment (Montygierd-
Loyba and Keeley 1987).  Annual stem production in clonal shrub populations has been 
described as a means of persistence for various other species such as hazel (Corylus 
cornuta) in Minnesota (e.g., Balogh and Grigal 1987, Kurmis and Sucoff 1989) and salal 
(Gaultheria shallon) in the Pacific Northwest (e.g., Huffman and Tappeiner 1997, 
Tappeiner et al. 2001).   After low severity fire (e.g., NCB and CB scenarios), Fendler 
ceanothus can produce abundant sprouts from belowground branches or root crowns 
(Vose and White 1987, 1991, Chapter 4 this dissertation).   
Based on work with shrubs (including Ceanothus spp.) in chaparral ecosystems, 
Keeley (1977, 1992, 1998) has described four “evolutionary options” related to life 

 
135
history traits and recovery from disturbance: 1) sprout and seedling production (i.e., 
facultative seeders; 2) abundant seedling production (“obligate seeders”); 3) low seedling 
production but high seedling survival; and 4) predominantly sprouting (“obligate 
resprouters”).  Obligate seeding species are likely to have evolved in environments 
characterized by infrequent, intense fire.  These species (e.g., Ceanothus greggii) cannot 
resprout and must recolonize sites through seedling establishment.  Obligate resprouting 
species are likely to have evolved in frequent, low intensity fire environments.  These 
species recruit few seedlings and persist on sites through vegetative regeneration (Keeley 
1977).  The two opposing strategies theoretically confer unique ecological advantages; 
obligate seeders can recolonize a site after an intense disturbance that produces high 
mortality in the vegetative community.  Seedling recruitment can also increase genetic 
variability in populations and allow maximum potential for adaptation.  Conversely, 
sprouting allows rapid reestablishment in competitive communities and can decrease time 
to reproduction relative to seedling development (Keeley 1977, Throop and Fay 1999).  
Fendler ceanothus appears to behave as a facultative resprouter; seedling establishment as 
well as resprouting can occur after fire (Chapter 4 this dissertation).  This dual strategy 
allows the species to persist under a range of conditions including frequent and infrequent 
fire. 
 
 
 
Ecological Restoration Implications 
 
A basic goal in ecological restoration is to enhance native biodiversity (Allen et 
al. 2002).  Biodiversity includes not only richness of species but also of structural 
attributes and genotypes (Spies and Franklin 1996).  My study suggests that ponderosa 

 
136
pine restoration treatments are likely to achieve biodiversity goals with respect to Fendler 
ceanothus population abundance and population structure if plants are protected from 
herbivory, at least for the first few years after thinning and burning.  For Fendler 
ceanothus, as well as other plant species, treatments that initiate establishment of 
seedlings, and thus increase genetic diversity, are likely to enhance the ability of 
populations to adapt to changing environments (Keeley 1977).  Further, treatments that 
allow full expression of plant life cycles may benefit other species in these ecosystems.   
For example, in early studies I documented seed parasitism on Fendler ceanothus by a 
chalcidoid wasp (Eurytoma squamosa) (Huffman 2002).  The host-parasite linkage 
appeared to be relatively tight as this wasp parasitizes seeds of a limited number of plants 
species, mainly those in the family Rhamnaceae (M. Gates pers. comm.).  Studies in 
progress indicate that herbivory of Fendler ceanothus may reduce diversity of other 
arthropods (Huffman unpublished data).  More studies are needed to describe ecosystem-
level effects of changes in population dynamics for important understory plant species.  
Population analyses, such as those presented in my study, are good starting points for 
understanding ecological tradeoffs associated with various restoration treatments and 
dissecting complex community response patterns as ecosystems are assisted in recovery 
from processes of degradation.

CHAPTER 6: FUTURE RESEARCH NEEDS 
 
 
As is often the case, the research conducted for this dissertation was effective in 
answering a predefined set of questions but, in the process, also uncovered questions 
beyond the scope of the project’s objectives.  Unanswered questions related to population 
ecology of Fendler ceanothus and study approaches that may be used to address these 
questions are discussed in this chapter.  Studies addressing these questions would provide 
new information for land managers and forest ecologists and improve our understanding 
of Fendler ceanothus autecological characteristics and long-term population dynamics.  
Moreover, these studies could better elucidate linkages among species and increase 
understanding of processes occurring in ponderosa pine ecosystems undergoing 
ecological restoration treatments.   
 
Herbivory: Spatial and Temporal Considerations  
 
Growth, stem recruitment, and flower production of Fendler ceanothus were 
negatively affected by large mammal herbivory in forest units thinned for ecological 
restoration (Chapter 2).  Simulation modeling indicated that intense herbivory adversely 
impacted long-term population abundance of Fendler ceanothus, particularly when 
prescribed fire was applied frequently (Chapter 5).  Herbivore effects on population 
growth appeared to be due to a combination of stem mortality and reduced flowering. 
Several spatial and temporal questions arose from these results.   
Q1: Are ungulate herbivory effects dependent on forest treatment unit size 
or distance to the forest edge?  The relatively small size (~14 ha) of the treated forest 

 
157
units provided a large amount of edge relative to interior habitat and were likely attractive 
to mule deer and elk (Patton 1974, Clary and Larson 1971, Severson and Medina 1983).  
Reynolds (1962) noted that mule deer use in natural forest openings was generally similar 
across a distance of about 200 m from the forest edge.  From these results, he concluded 
that mule deer use in forest openings of about 14 ha would be evenly distributed.  Both 
mule deer and elk use generally declined past distances greater than 200 m from the 
forest edge (Reynolds 1962).  Thus, browse plants located toward the interior of treated 
forest areas larger than 14 ha may experience less herbivory than those near the forest 
edge.  Less herbivory may allow plants to complete their life cycle or even enhance 
flower production (Paige and Whitham 1987, Throop and Fay 1999).  Plants located 
farther from the forest edge may therefore function as sources for population growth and 
persistence.  
Experiments to examine spatial patterns of herbivory and effects on plant life 
cycles and population dynamics could be tested at the Fort Valley study area.  For 
example, the Greater Flagstaff Forests Partnership (GFFP) is continuing to treat forest 
areas near and adjacent to the experimental units described in this dissertation (GFFP 
2003).  These treatment areas create larger forest openings, which may be used to study 
spatial questions related to herbivory of Fendler ceanothus.  Answers to these questions 
could help land mangers determine minimum size of treatment areas needed to reduce 
herbivore effects and promote development of Fendler ceanothus populations.        
Q2: Does intensity of herbivory decrease over time as understory 
communities develop?  Fendler ceanothus plants I examined in this dissertation research 
were remnants from depauperate understory communities existing before forest 

 
158
treatment.  The studies were conducted during the early stages of understory recovery 
after treatments and, in the first two years after overstory thinning, understory community 
structure was similar between treated and untreated forest units (Korb 2001).  Under 
these conditions, large herbivores may have been initially attracted to openings created 
by forest thinning and preferential selection of Fendler ceanothus plants may have 
resulted from low availability of other forage.  In studies of mule deer diets in the 
Southwest, several other browse species have been reported to be higher in importance 
than Fendler ceanothus (Hungerford 1970, Neff 1974, Urness et al. 1975, McCulloch 
1978).  Although surprisingly few studies have documented elk diets in the Southwest, 
examination of rumen contents indicate similar patterns with respect to Fendler ceanothus 
use (i.e., elk select other plants more frequently) (Severson and Medina 1983).  Highly 
preferred species, such as aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), mountain mahogany 
(Cercocarpus spp.), cliffrose (Purshia spp.), and oak (Quercus spp.) are infrequent or 
nonexistent at the Fort Valley study site.  Thus, although Fendler ceanothus is an 
important browse plant, intense herbivory at my study site may reflect necessity rather 
than herbivore preference as other foods were scarce (e.g., McCulloch 1978).   
Various research approaches might be used to address temporal questions related 
to herbivory on Fendler ceanothus. The most obvious of these would be to study 
herbivore effects over a longer (e.g., more than four years) period of time and test 
relationships between herbivory and understory community characteristics.  
Alternatively, one might introduce preferred browse plants in arrays of varying density 
and diversity near Fendler ceanothus plants in order to test selection patterns and 
resulting effects on growth and reproduction.  Information provided by these studies 

 
159
could help land mangers determine time frames required for protection of key browse 
species if these actions were deemed necessary.  Additionally, such information could 
alert land managers to habitat deficiencies and supplemental treatments needed, such as 
seeding or transplanting of important browse species, to support local populations of 
large ungulate herbivores.   
        
Herbivory: Indirect Effects 
 
Reduced flowering was found in all years (1999-2002) for Fendler ceanothus 
plants not protected from large herbivores (Chapter 3).  For stems that were reproductive, 
parasitism of seeds by the chalcidoid wasp, Eurytoma squamosa, accounted for varying 
amounts of ovule loss and over two-thirds of the developed seeds produced in a given 
year could be eaten by this invertebrate. Experiments of post-dispersal predation 
indicated that other organisms, such as birds and rodents, could remove about one-quarter 
of the annual cohort of seeds dispersed to the forest floor.  These interactions raise 
questions regarding direct and indirect competition among various species for Fendler 
ceanothus reproductive structures. 
 
Q3: What are the effects of intense ungulate herbivory on food web 
dynamics?  Research in other ecosystems has indicated that activity of large herbivores 
such as deer and elk can have significant effects on invertebrate communities (Baines et 
al. 1994, Rooney 2001, Stewart 2001).  These effects can be in the form of direct 
competition for plant resources such as biomass, pollen, nectar, or seeds (e.g., Baines et 
al. 1994). Interactions can also impact species composition in plant communities, 
predator-prey relationships, or microclimate conditions (e.g., Rooney 2001).  Changes in 

 
160
invertebrate communities can further cascade through higher trophic levels in the 
ecosystem (Stewart 2001).   
 
Studies to examine effects of herbivory on invertebrate communities could be 
easily conducted on experimental plots established for research presented in this 
dissertation.  Various sampling techniques would likely be needed in order to gain a 
comprehensive inventory of species associated with Fendler ceanothus plants.  All 
sampling techniques, when used independent of complimentary methods, are likely to 
miss some invertebrate species due to the great variety of behavioral characteristics found 
in insect communities (Borror et al. 1989).  Other temporal constraints (e.g., ontological, 
seasonal, diurnal, etc.) affect the compositional fraction of insect communities sampled 
with any given technique (Southwood and Henderson 2000).  In northern Arizona, 
Rambo and Faeth (1999) sampled insect communities inside and outside grazing 
exclosures using sweep netting and found greater insect abundance associated with areas 
that had been excluded from livestock and wild ungulate use.  This technique was also 
used successfully to sample insects associated with flowers, fruit and seeds of Ceanothus 
sanguineus (Furniss et al. 1978).  Other techniques that may be used to increase sampling 
depth for invertebrates associated with Fendler ceanothus include seed dissection and 
rearing insects from tissues such as galls formed on leaves and stems. 
 
Information provided by such studies is particularly relevant for restoration 
programs attempting to increase sources of native biodiversity on degraded sites.  
Additionally, basic information can be gained related to species interactions and food 
web structure.  This type of information is exemplified by initial investigations of seed 
parasitism that revealed a close linkage between Fendler ceanothus and Eurytoma 

 
161
squamosa, a species not previously reported in Arizona or associated with this host 
species (Huffman 2002).         
 
Seed Production 
 
In studies of seed production, variation appeared to be related to stem size and 
annual precipitation (Chapter 3).  Although seed production varied substantially, the 
proportion of seeds that were undeveloped varied relatively little and accounted for 50-
58% of the total yield from fruits in the two years when samples were collected.  Little is 
known regarding causes of ovule failure for Fendler ceanothus.  Fruit predation and seed 
parasitism are important factors to which ovule loss can be attributed; however, further 
research is needed to identify the importance of pollinators and abiotic resources in 
determining fruit and seed development (e.g., Stephenson 1981).   
 
Q4: Are Fendler ceanothus plants pollinator-limited at the Fort Valley 
restoration site?  Few studies have been undertaken to describe pollinator distribution in 
southwestern ponderosa pine forests or invertebrate responses to ecological restoration 
treatments.  Waltz and Covington (2001) showed that butterfly (Lepidoptera) species 
richness and abundance increased after restoration treatments comprised of thinning and 
burning.  Further, microclimatic changes associated with ponderosa pine restoration 
treatments increase activity of butterflies (Meyer and Sisk 2001).  Information concerning 
restoration treatment effects on abundance and richness of other pollinators, such as 
species of Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Coleoptera, is presently lacking. 
 
Experiments could be designed to examine relative importance of pollination 
versus resources in affecting Fendler ceanothus seed production. These studies could test 

 
162
treatment combinations of pollinator exclusion, hand pollination, and supplementation of 
resources such as water and nutrients. Information gained from such research could help 
restoration practitioners identify constraints to Fendler ceanothus population growth as 
well as general processes that may be lacking on restoration sites. Assessment of 
mutualistic interactions is critically important in evaluation of restoration success (e.g., 
Korb et al. 2003). 
 
Regeneration Niche 
 
Fendler ceanothus seedlings emerged on 46-55% of the plots that were 
experimentally burned at the Fort Valley study site in 2000 and 2001, respectively 
(Chapter 4).  No seedlings emerged in any of the four years on plots that were not burned.  
Seedling emergence was related to depth of forest floor consumed in burning and 
seedlings occurred most frequently on plots with moderate burn depths (3.5-5.0 cm).  
Extreme drought in 2002 made analysis of microsite effects on seedling survival difficult; 
mortality of seedlings that emerged on sample plots in 2001 averaged 89%.  Although 
drought (i.e., soil moisture) obviously plays a large role in affecting seedling survival, 
other microsite characteristics may assume pivotal roles in years of adequate 
precipitation.  Presently, microsite characteristics that affect survival of Fendler 
ceanothus are not known. 
Q5: What microsite factors are important in affecting Fendler ceanothus 
seedling establishment?  Grubb (1977) described the importance of species’ 
“regeneration niches” in determining diversity and persistence in plant communities.  A 
species’ regeneration niche includes important influences on seedling emergence and 

 
163
survival such as microclimatic characteristics (e.g., light, temperature, moisture), 
substrate, and predators.  Similarly, Harper (1977) described “safe sites” as microsites 
with conditions conducive to germination and establishment and thus lacking mortality 
agents.  For some species, narrow environmental parameters associated with germination 
and establishment suggests high levels of specialization (e.g., Harmon 1987, Huffman et 
al. 1994, Keeley and Fotheringham 1998).  This in turn suggests that seed germination 
and establishment characteristics are commonly traits that experience a high degree of 
selection pressure (Silvertown and Charlesworth 2001).  Little information is presently 
available concerning seedling establishment of species common in ponderosa pine forests 
of the Southwest.  Korb (2001) found that emergence of several grass and forb species 
was higher on native soil than on soils that experienced severe heat from burning of 
logging slash.  Vose and White (1987) noted emergence of Fendler ceanothus seedlings 
after prescribed fire in northern Arizona but did not present data on seedling survival. 
Studies to examine conditions influencing Fendler ceanothus seedling survival 
could be conducted using several approaches.  Field studies could be designed such that 
Fendler ceanothus seeds (pretreated – see Chapter 3) could be sowed on various 
microsites.  Microsite characteristics that might be varied include overstory density and 
substrate conditions.  Since seeds of this species have higher rates of germination when 
they are exposed to heat such as that from fire (Chapter 3), microsite conditions that 
include ash and charred litter from forest floor burning or mineral soil substrate might be 
of particular interest.  Controlled experiments to examine environmental conditions that 
influence survival could be conducted in a greenhouse or outdoor nursery beds.  

 
164
Information regarding Fendler ceanothus seedling establishment would help land 
managers predict development of local populations on sites for which environmental 
conditions are known.  In turn, these predictions could provide insight regarding 
understory community development and long-term patterns.   
 
Mechanisms of Resprouting 
Mortality of Fendler ceanothus plants after fire was positively related to depth of 
forest floor consumed in burning.  Probability of resprouting was near 1.0 when less than 
about 3 cm of forest floor was consumed during burning.  Resprouting decreased to zero 
when burn depth on plots was 5 cm or greater (Chapter 4).  Fire converted patches of 
Fendler ceanothus stem from all-aged to even-aged.  Resprouts on plots protected from 
large herbivores were typically long and unbranched.  This research suggested that burn 
severity can be high when prescribed fire is applied in forests having over 100 years of 
forest floor fuel accumulation (Fulé et al. 1997).  Also, vigorous resprouting after fire 
allows Fendler ceanothus to rapidly reoccupy space and quickly regain reproductive 
potential.  Greater understanding of Fendler Ceanothus response to disturbance could be 
gained by posing questions related to pre-burn conditions that may influence resprouting.    
Q6: What site and/or plant characteristics determine production of new 
sprouts after fire?  Little research has been done to quantify resprouting of Fendler 
ceanothus after fire.  Pearson et al. (1972) reported increases in abundance of this species 
after wildfire but did not describe whether changes were due to seedling emergence or 
resprouting.  Vose and White (1991) found vigorous resprouting of Fendler ceanothus 
after prescribed fire but no attempt was made to correlate response to pre-burn plant 

 
165
characteristics. In other species, resprouting can be related to plant age, size, and 
carbohydrate reserves in belowground structures (Zasada et al. 1994, Landhäusser and 
Lieffers 1997, Hodgkinson 1998, Bellingham and Sparrow 2000). 
Studies to examine relationships between pre-burn plant characteristics and 
resprouting after fire might be simple to design.  In the field, a range of plant sizes and 
ages could be selected and fire behavior could be controlled by limiting the amount of 
fuel consumed during burning.  To examine effects of available resources on 
repsprouting, a subset of the selected plants could be restricted in access to light (e.g., by 
using shade cloth) or moisture.  Samples of belowground tissue could be carefully 
collected before burning to quantify carbohydrate reserves in belowground branches or 
root crowns.  More complicated experimental designs would include variation in season 
of burn to determine phenological effects that might interact with resource availability 
and plant age.  
Information concerning mechanisms that control resprouting of Fendler ceanothus 
could help land managers formulate restoration burns plans that encourage population 
growth through vegetative recruitment.  Additionally, better understanding of resprouting 
mechanisms for Fendler ceanothus could help generate hypotheses related to recovery 
strategies for other species in these plant communities.    
 
Population Dynamics 
Simulated growth of Fendler ceanothus populations was significantly affected by 
management alternative; growth was highest for populations burned and protected from 
large herbivores in thinned forest units (Chapter 5).  These populations had relatively 

 
166
even distribution of life stages and represented the greatest potential for persistence and 
adaptation to environmental changes.  Size of populations that were not protected from 
herbivores and burned frequently (e.g., every 2-5 years) declined dramatically.  
Herbivory dramatically lowered probability of stem transition to the reproductive stage 
and this disruption of Fendler ceanothus’ life cycle inhibited population recovery after 
fire.   
In simulation models, one-year-old Fendler ceanothus seedlings were assumed to 
suffer high rates of mortality (P2 = 0.01; Chapter 5) when fire occurred.  Seedlings could 
potentially transition to a vegetative adult stage (G2) in their second growing season and 
to reproductive adults (G3) in their third year.  These assumptions were based on limited 
observations of Fendler ceanothus seedlings in greenhouse and field studies as well as 
research of Ceanothus integerrimus (McDonald et al. 1998), a species common in mixed 
conifer forests of California.  Faster or slower rates of transition to a reproductive stage 
may affect population structure and long-term dynamics. 
Q7: What is the maximum rate of transition from seedling to reproductive 
life stage?  McDonald et al. (1998) found that out-planted seedlings of C. integerrimus 
produced multiple stems from incipient root crowns during their first growing season.  By 
the third year, 42% of the plants produced flowers. Large herbivores were excluded from 
the study site, most competing vegetation was removed, and seedlings were given 
supplemental water and nutrients during the first six weeks of the study.  Thus, these 
results likely represent the maximum rate at which young plants of this species develop 
adult characteristics.  For salal (Gaultheria shallon Pursh.), a clonal shrub species of the 
Pacific Northwest, production of rhizomes and vegetative expansion can occur within 

 
167
about six years of seedling emergence (Huffman et al. 1994).  Flowering of this species 
can occur within four years of emergence (Bunnell 1990).  Such information is not 
available for Fendler ceanothus.    
Field and laboratory studies could be designed to test the maximum rate (i.e. 
minimum age) at which young Fendler ceanothus plants could attain adult characteristics 
such as root crowns, flowers, and the ability to expand vegetatively.  Seedlings could be 
grown in nursery beds under controlled conditions and effects of constraints to 
development, such as resource availability, herbivory, or disturbance such as fire, could 
be assessed.  These results could be compared with those from studies of field grown 
seedlings to generate further hypotheses concerning constraints and rate of plant 
development.  Information from this research could help land managers better predict 
changes and growth of Fendler ceanothus populations given known environmental 
conditions.  Monitoring plan development and testing predictions related to population 
dynamics could be used to evaluate management strategies.         
Another assumption used in simulation models was related to density-dependent 
effects on vital rates.  A “ceiling” carrying capacity (K) was set at 2500 individuals 
(aerial stems and seeds), roughly four-times the initial population size (Chapter 5). The 
value for K and the type of density-dependence were arbitrarily selected since no 
information was available on true density-dependent relationships for Fendler ceanothus.  
Further, since forest units were in early stages of development, population growth was 
assumed to be unaffected by interspecific competition.  Potential for Fendler ceanothus 
density in these forests and intra-specific density regulation mechanisms are not known. 

 
168
Q8: Do Fendler ceanothus populations exhibit density-dependence as 
population size approaches carrying capacity?  Maximum aerial stem density on any 
sample plot studied was 104 per square meter (Chapter 4). This represented 1.04 x 106 
stems per hectare.  Whether or not this was a “crowded” condition is not known; longer-
term data are needed to assess stem recruitment in this patch.  Crowding in populations 
can affect plant growth, which in turn can affect size, mortality, and fecundity 
(Silvertown and Charlesworth 2001).  Further, whether the stem density observed 
represented one or more clones (or clonal fragments) is not known.  It is generally 
thought that intra-clonal competition is rare and cooperative integration among ramets 
might be typical for clonal plants, even in stressful environments (Pitelka and Ashman 
1985).  Thus, whether an stem populations are comprised of one or several clones may 
affect maximum density and density-dependent processes.  Information concerning 
maximum densities for other understory species in ponderosa pine forests is not 
available.   
Studies to determine maximum density and density-dependent effects on 
population dynamics are most easily done by experimentally controlling population 
density (Silvertown and Charlesworth 2001).  Fendler ceanothus seedlings could be 
planted in a common garden at different densities and monitored over a period of years.  
A common garden study would allow control over other, density-independent processes 
that affect population growth.  Further, experiments could be designed to test maximum 
stem density attained by individual clones versus clonal assemblages.  Information from 
these studies could help land managers determine potential forage and habitat resources 
for wildlife as well as assess condition of local Fendler ceanothus populations.  

 
169
Information concerning density dependent effect could also help ecologists develop more 
precise population models and better predict population dynamics. 
 
Conclusion 
The research presented in this dissertation answered several questions related to 
Fendler ceanothus autecology and population dynamics in ponderosa pine forests treated 
for ecological restoration.  Several new questions were generated from this research and 
most could be addressed experimentally.  Answers to these questions would increase our 
basic understanding of Fendler ceanothus as well as provide details concerning processes 
important in ponderosa pine ecosystems.  Information generated by these studies would 
help land managers make more informed decisions and evaluate techniques designed to 
restore ecological diversity to understory plant communities in these forests.
