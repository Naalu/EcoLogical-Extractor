Evaluating treatment effectiveness following the 2014 San Juan Fire,  
White Mountains, Arizona 
 
By John Paul Roccaforte, Senior Research Specialist 
Introduction 
The San Juan Fire burned 6,975 acres of ponderosa pine/mixed conifer forest on the White Mountain Apache 
Reservation and the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests (ASNF) between June 26 and July 5, 2014 (Reidy 
2014). The fire burned through an area where restoration treatments had recently been implemented as part 
of study established by Northern Arizona University’s Ecological Restoration Institute and the ASNF 
(Roccaforte et al. 2015; Roccaforte 2015). In the study, we compared ecological conditions in full restoration 
(thinning based on historical spatial patterns plus prescribed burning), burn-only (prescribed fire without 
thinning), and untreated control units, and found that the full restoration treatment was the only one that rap-
idly shifted forest structure, diameter distributions, and canopy fuels values to levels near or within the his-
torical reference conditions (see Roccaforte et al. 2015). The San Juan Fire burned portions of five of the 
study units (Fig. 1), providing a rare opportunity to examine treatment effectiveness using an actual wildfire 
event. 
 
Research Findings 
 Only surface fire occurred in both full restoration study units. Low tree mortality was observed in 
units that had been thinned and burned. The proportion of density (3–26 percent) and basal area (BA) 
(0.5–18 percent) killed in the San Juan Fire was lowest in the full restoration units. Live seedlings (437–
1,356 stems/acre) and coarse woody debris (CWD) (>3 inches diameter; 0.08–5.5 tons/acre) were found 
only in these units (Table 1). 
 
 Higher tree mortality occurred in the burn-only treatment unit. Although post-fire forest structure 
values (126 trees/acre, 87 ft2/acre BA) in the burn-only study unit were shifted toward the historical ref-
erence conditions, tree density and BA values remained more than two times greater than the mean re-
constructed values estimated in 1880 (Roccaforte et al. 2015). All trees were killed on two of the 20 
plots in this unit representing a high-severity patch of approximately 1.8 acres, or 10 percent of the area 
sampled. Live seedlings and CWD were absent in the burn-only unit (Table 1).

 Crown fire was the predominant fire 
type in the control units. The proportion 
of tree density (93 percent) and BA (88 
percent) killed was highest in the northern 
control unit (C1, Fig. 1). All trees were 
killed on 16 of the 20 plots in this unit rep-
resenting a high-severity patch of approxi-
mately 14.2 acres, or 80 percent of the area 
sampled. The southern control unit (C2, 
Fig. 1) burned on the second day of the fire 
when fire weather and winds were less ex-
treme and slightly lower mortality oc-
curred: the proportion of density (77 per-
cent) and BA (51 percent) killed was sec-
ond highest in this unit. All trees were 
killed on five of the 20 plots in this unit 
representing a high-severity patch of ap-
proximately 4.5 acres, or 25 percent of the 
area sampled. Live seedlings and CWD 
were absent in both control units (Table 1). 
 
Conclusions 
The San Juan Fire provided an opportunity to examine restoration treatment effectiveness using an actual 
wildfire event because it burned through an area where previous treatments had been implemented and stud-
ied. Fire behavior and post-fire effects on forest structure and tree mortality varied by treatment. Low-
severity surface fire occurred in the full restoration treatment units; passive and active crown fire was not 
observed. The limited tree mortality and presence of live seedlings and CWD observed in these units sug-
gests that the full restoration treatment produced stand conditions that were resistant to an actively burning 
wildfire. Although passive and active crown fire occurred in the burn-only unit resulting in high-severity 
patches with 100 percent tree mortality, post-fire forest structure and diameter distributions were shifted to-
wards historical reference conditions. Fire behavior and post-fire effects were variable in the control units, 
but active crown fire was the predominant fire type with high tree mortality, large high-severity patches, and 
an absence of seedlings and CWD. Results from this study show that full restoration treatments increase eco-
system resilience to wildfire.
