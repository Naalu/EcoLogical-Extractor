Abstract
Forests provide climate change mitigation beneﬁt by sequestering carbon during growth. This beneﬁt can be reversed
by both human and natural disturbances. While some disturbances such as hurricanes are beyond the control of
humans, extensive research in dry, temperate forests indicates that wildﬁre severity can be altered as a function of
forest fuels and stand structural manipulations. The purpose of this study was to determine if current aboveground
forest carbon stocks in ﬁre-excluded southwestern ponderosa pine forest are higher than preﬁre exclusion carbon
stocks reconstructed from 1876, quantify the carbon costs of thinning treatments to reduce high-severity wildﬁre risk,
and compare posttreatment (thinning and burning) carbon stocks with reconstructed 1876 carbon stocks. Our ﬁndings
indicate that preﬁre exclusion forest carbon stocks ranged from 27.9 to 36.6 Mg C ha1 and that the current ﬁre-
excluded forest structure contained on average 2.3 times as much live tree carbon. Posttreatment carbon stocks ranged
from 37.9 to 50.6 Mg C ha1 as a function of thinning intensity. Previous work found that these thinning and burning
treatments substantially increased the 6.1 m wind speed necessary for ﬁre to move from the forest ﬂoor to the canopy
(torching index) and the wind speed necessary for sustained crown ﬁre (crowning index), thereby reducing potential
ﬁre severity. Given the projected drying and increase in ﬁre prevalence in this region as a function of changing climatic
conditions, the higher carbon stock in the ﬁre-excluded forest is unlikely to be sustainable. Treatments to reduce high-
severity wildﬁre risk require trade-offs between carbon stock size and carbon stock stability.

Introduction
Carbon sequestration is one of a suite of ecosystems
services that forests provide. Climate change mitigation
using forests can be accomplished by reducing emis-
sions from deforestation and degradation, increasing
forested land area via afforestation or reforestation,
increasing carbon density through improved forest
management, and sustainably using forest biomass to
replace fossil fuel-based energy sources (Canadell &
Raupach, 2008). Estimates of the US forest carbon sink
indicate that forest carbon stocks have been increasing
in part as a result of in-growth due to ﬁre exclusion and
regrowth due to land abandonment (Hurtt et al., 2002)
and now sequester approximately 10% of annual
anthropogenic emissions (Woodbury et al., 2007).
However, storing carbon in forests is not without risk.
Disturbances that kill trees represent a risk to forest
carbon sequestration because the carbon stored in trees
can be released back to the atmosphere (Galik & Jackson,
2009; Hurteau et al., 2009). While regulations can limit the
risk of human-caused reversals, natural disturbances
continue to pose a risk to forest carbon projects even in
the well-regulated US forest sector. Some of these dis-
turbances, such as storms and insect outbreaks, are
difﬁcult if not impossible to manage for. Chambers
et al. (2007) estimated that Hurricane Katrina resulted
in a loss of 105 Tg of forest carbon. Kurz et al. (2008)
estimate that the mountain pine beetle outbreak in British
Columbia will result in a 270 Tg loss of forest carbon over
a 20-year period. However, some reversal risks, such as
wildﬁre, can be managed for. Fires emitted approxi-
mately 4–6% of US carbon emissions from 2001 to 2007
(Wiedinmyer & Neff, 2007), a relatively small fraction
compared with anthropogenic fossil-fuel derived carbon
emissions, but still a substantial amount of C.
Wildﬁres release carbon to the atmosphere as a func-
tion of direct biomass combustion and indirectly
through the decomposition of ﬁre-killed trees. Indirect
emissions from wildﬁre have been estimated at as much
as three times the amount of carbon lost in direct
emissions (Auclair & Carter, 1993). Measurements of
postwildﬁre net ecosystem productivity indicate that

following wildﬁre, forests can continue to be a source of
carbon to the atmosphere for a number of years (Dore
et al., 2008; Meigs et al., 2009).
In the western United States, forest ﬁres have been
increasing in size and severity as a result of past manage-
ment actions to exclude ﬁre and on-going climate change
(Covington et al., 1997; Fule´ et al., 1997; Westerling et al.,
2006; Miller et al., 2009). Area burned by wildﬁre in the
western United States correlates with climate variability
and in forested systems is mechanistically explained by
low fuel moisture and fuel quantity and continuity
(Keane et al., 2008; Littell et al., 2009). Future climate
projections for southwestern North America suggest that
increasing temperature will likely result in regional
drying (Seager et al., 2007). Regardless of the atmospheric
carbon dioxide emission scenario, the occurrence of large
ﬁres is projected to increase (Westerling & Bryant, 2008).
Thus, taking action to mitigate high-severity wildﬁre risk
is not solely in the domain of forest conservation, but
also pertinent to climate change adaptation.
Altering forest structure and reducing surface fuels
have proven effective at reducing ﬁre severity (Agee &
Skinner, 2005; Stephens & Moghaddas, 2005; Roccaforte
et al., 2008; Collins et al., 2009). In addition to reducing
ﬁre severity, these treatments can also reduce wildﬁre
related carbon emissions (Hurteau et al., 2008; Hurteau &
North, 2009; Mitchell et al., 2009; Stephens et al., 2009a;
Wiedinmyer & Hurteau, 2010). However, the reduction
in risk comes at a carbon cost because of the associated
reduction in tree biomass, waste as a function of mill
efﬁciency, and fossil fuel emissions from harvesting
(Finkral & Evans, 2008; Mitchell et al., 2009; North et al.,
2009). The preﬁre exclusion structure of these forests,
which was maintained by frequent, low-severity ﬁre, is
often the reference or target condition used as a marker
against which treatments are measured. The purpose of
this research was threefold (1) to quantify the live tree
carbon in the reconstructed forest in 1876, before the
exclusion of frequent surface ﬁres; (2) to quantify above-
ground forest carbon both before and after wildﬁre risk
mitigation treatments; (3) to compare pre- and posttreat-
ment live tree carbon stocks with the reconstructed 1876
forest carbon stock for four levels of thinning in a
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest in northern
Arizona. Speciﬁcally, we sought to determine if postﬁre
exclusion, pretreatment live tree carbon stocks were
larger or smaller than preﬁre exclusion carbon stocks.
Materials and methods
Study area
This study was conducted within and adjacent to the Fort Valley
Experimental Forest, a 2003ha mixed-age ponderosa pine re-
serve located approximately 15km northwest of Flagstaff,
Arizona
in
the
Coconino
National
Forest
(3511601900N,
11114102200W).
The study
area
elevation
is
approximately
2250 m with average slopes of 5–10%. Mean annual precipitation
is 57 cm of which roughly half falls as rain in July and August
and half as snow during winter months (National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, 2005). The forest overstory is
dominated by mature ponderosa pine, intermixed with dense
thickets of smaller ponderosa pine and a primarily herbaceous
understory. Before ﬁre exclusion, this area was characterized by
an open forest canopy, dominated by large trees, and maintained
by frequent surface ﬁres (Covington et al., 1997).
Treatments and data collection
In 1998, three experimental blocks were established, consisting
of four 14 ha treatment units. Each treatment unit was ran-
domly assigned one of four thinning treatments. Tree thinning
treatments were based on a site-speciﬁc reconstruction of
preﬁre exclusion forest structure using principles described
by Moore et al. (1999) and included a no-thin control, and three
levels of thinning that used evidence of old-growth indivi-
duals as a basis for retention. In addition to retaining all trees
that had established before 1876, the thinning treatments had
variable levels of retention per evidence (e.g. snags, logs,
stumps) of an old-growth individual (Covington & Moore,
1994; Fule´ et al., 2001). The three levels of retention are based
on the number of trees retained for each piece of evidence (e.g.
snag, log, etc.) of an old-growth individual, with the retained
trees essentially serving as replacements for the old-growth
individual. The heaviest thinning treatment retained 1.5–3
trees, the moderate thinning treatment retained 2–4 trees,
and the lightest thinning treatment retained 3–6 trees per
evidence of each old-growth individual. The number of young
trees retained depended on tree size; when the young trees
were small [o40.6 cm diameter at breast (dbh)], the higher
retention rate in each range was used. Tree retention was also a
function of proximity to the evidence of an old-growth in-
dividual, whereby trees that were closest to each piece of
evidence were retained to approximate the preﬁre exclusion
spatial pattern. Thinning treatments were implemented in
1999 and prescribe burned in either spring 2000 or spring 2001.
Twenty 400 m2 (11.28 m radius) ﬁxed area monitoring plots
were established on a 60 m  60m grid in each of the 12
treatment units (240 total plots). Plot centers were permanently
marked with iron stakes and all trees were tagged to ensure
exact relocation for sampling in subsequent years. Sampling
took place in 1998 (pretreatment) and 2006 (posttreatment).
Overstory trees taller than breast height (137 cm) were mea-
sured on each plot, including species, condition (living or
snag/log condition class), dbh and a preliminary ﬁeld classi-
ﬁcation of pre- or postﬁre exclusion (1876) origin. Trees likely
to have originated before 1876 were identiﬁed based on size
(440 cm diameter at stump height) or yellow bark (White,
1985). All potentially preﬁre exclusion trees, as well as a 10%
random subsample of other live trees, were cored with an
increment borer at 40 cm in height. Dead woody biomass and
forest ﬂoor fuel loads were measured on a 15.2 m planar
transect in a random direction from each plot center. Woody

debris biomass was calculated using procedures in Brown
(1974) and Sackett (1980). Forest ﬂoor fuel loading (e.g. surface
organic matter comprised of litter and duff) was calculated
using equations from Ffolliot et al. (1968). Understory vegeta-
tion was sampled in each plot on a 50 m point-line intercept
transect oriented along the plot aspect and centered on plot
center. Herbaceous plants were recorded every 30 cm along
each transect for a total of 166 points per plot. Plant foliar cover
(%) was estimated by dividing the number of plant occur-
rences along the point-intercept transect by 166 points.
Collecting vegetation data using quadrats has been shown to
provide a more accurate estimate of understory cover com-
pared with the point-line intercept method in southwestern
ponderosa pine forest (Korb et al., 2003; Abella & Covington,
2004). Conversions of ocular cover estimates to plant biomass
for the general location have been developed using 1 m2 quad-
rats (Laughlin, 2009). Therefore, in 2006, we additionally
sampled ten 1 m2 quadrats per plot arranged along the center
of each point-line intercept transect. Understory cover data for
1998 were estimated using a linear regression equation between
2006 quadrat cover and point-line cover data (quadcover
5 8.9227 1 3.7040  point-line cover, Po0.0001, r2 5 0.80). Plant
biomass was then calculated using equations from Laughlin
(2009).
Forest reconstruction and carbon concentration
Increment cores were surfaced and cross-dated with local
chronologies. Rings were counted on cores that could not be
cross-dated. For cores with missing pith, additional years to
the center were estimated with a pith locator consisting of
concentric circles matched to the curvature and density of the
inner rings. Preﬁre exclusion forest structure was recon-
structed at the time of disruption of the frequent ﬁre regime,
circa, 1876, following dendroecological methods described in
detail in Fule´ et al. (1997). Tree diameters for 1876 were
reconstructed for both living and dead trees as a function of
inventoried diameter and/or radial increment using methods
described in Bakker et al. (2008). Dendroecological reconstruc-
tions in this forest type and locality have been shown to be
accurate within
 3 trees ha1 as compared with historical
forest measurement plot data (Moore et al., 2004).
We used allometric equations developed locally by Kaye
et al. (2005) to calculate total above ground carbon biomass for
pretreatment (1998), posttreatment (2006) and reconstructed
(1876) live trees and snags. To quantify carbon in coarse
(47.62 cm in diameter) and ﬁne woody debris (o7.62 cm in
diameter), we used a biomass-to-carbon conversion factor of
50% (Penman et al., 2003). Forest ﬂoor fuel loads (e.g. litter and
duff) were converted to carbon biomass assuming a carbon
concentration of 37% (Smith & Heath, 2002). We assumed the
carbon concentration in understory plant biomass to be 43%
(Laughlin, 2009).
Results
Reconstructed 1876 aboveground live tree carbon (C)
stocks ranged from 27.9 to 36.6 Mg C ha1. On average,
pretreatment aboveground live tree C was 2.3 times
greater than the reconstructed 1876 live tree carbon and
ranged from 69.5 to 75.1 Mg C ha1 (Fig. 1a). Posttreat-
ment mean aboveground live tree C values ranged from
37.9 Mg C ha1 in the 1.5–3 tree retention prescription,
to 50.6 Mg C ha1 in the 3–6 tree retention prescription
(Fig. 1b). Paired t-test comparisons of the posttreatment
and reconstructed 1876 live tree C indicated that only
the 3–6 leave tree prescription was signiﬁcantly greater
than the reconstructed live tree C stock. The difference
between pre- and posttreatment control C stock values
is due to live tree growth and a reduction in snags over
the 8 years between measurement periods.
Tree frequency by diameter class tended to be more
evenly distributed in the 1876 reconstruction (Fig. 2).
In pretreatment stands, smaller diameter classes were
disproportionally represented. Posttreatment diameter
distributions approximated the 1876 reconstruction,
because smaller trees were preferentially harvested
(Fig. 2b–d). However, all thinning levels had a greater
number of individuals in each diameter class as com-
pared with the reconstruction because the treatments
were designed to leave greater than one tree for evidence
of each tree that was present in 1876.
Before treatment, litter and duff, ﬁne woody debris,
coarse woody debris, and understory vegetation com-
prised between 21% and 28% of the aboveground
carbon stock (Fig. 1a). Posttreatment, the contributions
of these pools to the total carbon stock was a function of
thinning intensity, ranging from 23% in the 1.5–3 leave
tree prescription to 17% in the 3–6 leave tree prescrip-
tion (Fig. 1b).
Discussion
The carbon carrying capacity of a forest represents the
amount of C that can be maintained in the system given
climatic conditions and natural disturbance regimes,
and barring human disturbance (Keith et al., 2009,
2010). Fire is a natural disturbance in the ponderosa
pine forests of the southwestern United States. How-
ever, the frequency and intensity of ﬁre in these systems
has been fundamentally altered by human intervention,
causing a transition from frequent, low-severity ﬁre to
infrequent, high-severity ﬁre (Covington et al., 1997;
Fule´ et al., 1997). As a result, live tree C stocks at the
Fort Valley study site have increased on average by
231% since ﬁre exclusion in 1876. The results of this
study contrast with research in the Sierra Nevada
mountains
of California that indicates
while tree
density has increased as a result of ﬁre exclusion, live
tree carbon stocks have decreased because of a reduc-
tion in the number of large trees which contain a

disproportionate amount of the live tree C (Fellows &
Goulden, 2008; North et al., 2009).
Torching and crowning indices are commonly used
metrics for quantifying the 6.1 m wind speed required
for ﬁre to move from the surface into the forest canopy
(torching) and for the occurrence of an active crown ﬁre
(crowning) (Scott & Reinhardt, 2001). Previous ﬁre
modeling work conducted by Fule´ et al. (2001) at this
site indicated that increased tree density due to ﬁre
exclusion had resulted in a decrease in torching and
crowning indices, suggesting that this system has ex-
ceeded the carbon carrying capacity (Fig. 1). Fule´ et al.
(2001) found that these treatments were effective at
increasing both torching and crowning indices over
pretreatment values, with the greatest posttreatment
increases in the 1.5–3 tree retention prescription (Fig.
1b). Achieving these increases in torching and crowning
indices required a reduction in the live tree C pool.
Mean live tree C reductions ranged from 17.7 to
32.6 Mg C ha1 and were equivalent to 41.5%, 43.4%,
and 25.6% of pretreatment live tree C in the 1.5–3, 2–4,
and 3–6 tree retention prescriptions, respectively.
The concept of surpassing the carbon carrying capa-
city in this system is further supported by two other
recent studies in the region. A survey of 10 ponderosa
pine sites that burned under stand-replacing ﬁre con-
ditions across Arizona and New Mexico found that only
50% of the sites had sufﬁcient tree regeneration to lead
to forest recovery (Savage & Mast, 2005). The remaining
sites showed limited or no regeneration indicating a
shift toward a nonforest type. Dore et al. (2008) report
that 10 years following a stand-replacing wildﬁre in
northern Arizona, the site continues to be a source of C
to the atmosphere, with little evidence of transition to a
carbon sink in the near future.
Before recent human intervention, high-severity ﬁres
in southwestern ponderosa pine forests were rare (Swet-
nam et al., 1999). Given the recent evidence of increasing
ﬁre size in the western United States, coupled with
projections of further regional drying due to changing
climatic conditions (Westerling et al., 2006; Seager et al.,
2007), large ﬁres are likely to become more prevalent on
the landscape (Westerling & Bryant, 2008). As a result,
we need to view the climate change mitigation potential
of these forests in the context of the potential for C loss
due to wildﬁre. The results of this research and work by
Fule´ et al. (2001) indicate that high-severity wildﬁre
resistance can be restored to southwestern ponderosa
pine forests. However, this increased resistance comes
with a C stock reduction cost.
Are the forest management goals of high-severity
wildﬁre risk reduction, carbon sequestration to mitigate
climate change, and capacity building for system level
climate change adaptation mutually exclusive? Forest
structure can be manipulated to reduce the risk of
stand-replacing wildﬁre, but at the cost of a reduction
in C stocks (Finkral & Evans, 2008; Hurteau & North,
2009; Mitchell et al., 2009; North et al., 2009; Stephens
Fig. 1. The stacked bars are the pretreatment (a) and posttreatment (b) carbon stocks in live trees, litter and duff, ﬁne woody debris,

reconstructed 1876 live tree carbon stocks with standard errors. The pre- and posttreatment torching indices and crowning indices from

et al., 2009a, b; Reinhardt & Holsinger, 2010). However
in dry forest types, such as ponderosa pine, these
carbon stock reductions can have a net carbon beneﬁt
if wildﬁre emissions reductions are larger than the
carbon removed during treatment (Hurteau & North,
2009; Mitchell et al., 2009). Furthermore, the trees re-
tained during treatment continue to grow and sequester
carbon (Hurteau & North, 2010). Climate change adap-
tation adds another level of uncertainty to management.
Recent increases in western US wide tree mortality have
been attributed to increasing temperature and the asso-
ciated water stress (van Mantgem et al., 2009). Work
in northern Arizona indicates that forest thinning
increased the carbon sink strength compared with un-
thinned forest during the driest summer months (Dore
et al., 2010), suggesting that this management option
adds system level resilience to drought.
Given the potential for high-severity ﬁre in south-
western ponderosa pine forests to yield a vegetation
type conversion and an associated reduction in the
carbon stock and carbon stock potential, wildﬁre risk
mitigation treatments could be viewed in the context of
reducing emissions from deforestation and degrada-
tion, whereby high-severity ﬁre is the agent of change.
While the carbon stock per unit area arising from ﬁre
exclusion may be higher in postﬁre exclusion forest, it is
likely to be unsustainable in the face of changing
climatic conditions and ﬁre, and therefore counter-
productive for climate change mitigation. In contrast,
managing the system to be within the natural range of
variability for carbon stock size offers the opportunity
to restore ﬁre as a natural process, improve carbon stock
stability, and potentially to build climate change adap-
tation capacity.
