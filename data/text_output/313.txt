ABSTRACT 
PRE-FIRE TREATMENTS HAVE PERSISTENT EFFECTS ON POST-FIRE PLANT COMMUNITIES 
Kristen L. Shive  
 
Wildfires characterized by large areas of high severity are increasingly occurring in 
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson) forests of the Southwest to extents that are 
out of the natural range of variability.  Managers are now routinely applying thinning and/or 
burning treatments to reduce fire severity.  To investigate the effects of pre-fire treatments and 
fire severity on post-fire vegetation recovery, we re-measured established plots on the 2002 
Rodeo-Chediski Fire on the White Mountain Apache Tribal (WMAT) lands eight years post-fire 
and the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest (ASNF) nine years post-fire. 
 
On the WMAT lands we re-measured 70 plots stratified by fire severity (high, low) and 
pre-fire treatment (untreated, and cut/burned).  We found significantly higher overall plant 
cover, exotic forb cover (although this was still low, <1%) and pine regeneration frequency in 
high severity areas, and highly significant overall differences in plant community composition 
and abundance between severity classes.  Pre-fire treatment also influenced vegetation 
response within fire severity class.  In particular, pine regeneration was more frequent in pre-
fire treated areas than untreated areas for both severity classes, which we linked to a generally 
more open canopy in treated low severity fire areas and to a more heterogeneous 
neighborhood severity pattern in treated high severity areas. 
 
On the ASNF portion of the study, we re-measured 80 plots in paired pre-fire thinned 
sites, which were less severely burned, and pre-fire unthinned sites that were more severely 
burned.  Plant community composition and abundance in thinned and unthinned areas were 

3 
 
converging nine years post-fire; however, persistent differences included significantly higher 
overall plant cover, as well as higher mean shrub cover in the untreated areas. 
 
A low exotic species response was observed on both study areas, but we did detect an 
increased frequency of some exotic species compared to the initial observations. Studies 
throughout the Southwest have documented varying rates of exotic species invasions, 
suggesting there is no clear pattern between fire severity and exotic species response. Although 
high severity fire can increase growing space for exotic species, post-fire management practices, 
on-site propagules and weather patterns may be the more important drivers of exotic response.

PREFACE 
 
This thesis contains two manuscripts intended for publication, and these chapters both 
use “we” instead of “I” because they will include co-authors.  These manuscripts are Chapter 2: 
“The influence of pre-fire treatment on post-fire plant community dynamics through time” and 
Chapter 3: “Pre-fire management treatments have lasting effects on post-fire plant community 
response.”  The literature cited in each chapter is listed at the end of that chapter.

CHAPTER 1 
Introduction 
 
In much of the western United States, global climate change has been linked to 
increased fire severity (Miller et al., 2009), frequency and extent (Westerling et al., 2006; Littell 
et al., 2009). This trend is expected to continue in the Southwest, where a warmer and drier 
climate is predicted (Seager et al., 2007). Southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. & C. 
Lawson) forests are at particularly high risk, since these forests are now characterized by high 
densities of small trees with closed canopies (Cooper 1960, Covington and Moore 1994). Large 
scale, stand-replacing fires are of concern because they are out of the range of natural variability 
for these ecosystems (Fulé et al. 2003), which means that the post-fire landscapes are 
necessarily recovering under novel conditions, and their future trajectories are not easily 
predicted.  
Rather than regenerate as forest, these areas have the potential to persist as vegetation 
type conversions to shrublands or grasslands (Savage and Mast, 2005), for several reasons. First, 
pine recruitment may decline under warming climate, since successful seedling establishment is 
sensitive to moisture and temperature (Puhlick et al., 2012). Second, high severity fire may 
promote species that have the ability to resprout post-fire. Early site capture by sprouting 
species may limit the establishment of seeder species such as ponderosa pine through 
competition for resources (Fulé and Covington, 1998; Barton, 2002). In addition, these novel 
post-fire communities may be more susceptible to frequent high severity fire, which could limit 
tree recruitment and create positive feedbacks between climate, vegetation and fire (Fried et 
al., 2004). Even where forest structure eventually does re-establish, it is likely to take decades 
(Haire and McGarigal, 2008, 2010), and the plant communities in severely burned areas are 

11 
 
likely to remain distinct from those in forested areas for many years (Bataineh et al., 2006). Such 
changes to native vegetation could have significant ramifications for many trophic levels, 
including herbivores, pollinators, as well as native wildlife communities (Beier et al., 2008). 
High severity fire may also promote exotic species invasions, which are of concern 
because they can negatively impact native plant communities (Levine et al., 2003) and alter 
future fire regimes (Brooks et al., 2004). These high severity disturbances are extensive enough 
to open up growing space for early seral colonizers that are generally ruderal, annual/biennial, 
shade-intolerant species (Egler, 1954; Grime, 1977; Keeley et al., 1981). Although exotic species 
exhibit a myriad of plant strategies and tolerances, many of them are well-suited to fill this role 
(Sutherland, 2004; Martin et al., 2009). In addition, the degree to which invasions occur is not 
limited to disturbance severity; weather patterns and propagule pressure are also important 
factors (Lockwood et al., 2005; McGlone et al., 2009). In the Southwest, several studies have 
linked high severity fire with exotic species invasions in semi-arid ecosystems (Crawford et al., 
2001; Floyd et al., 2006; Dodge et al., 2008; Rew and Johnson, 2010). However, other studies 
have documented minor responses by exotic species (Huisinga et al., 2005; Kuenzi et al., 2008; 
McMaster, 2010), thus limiting our ability to predict exotic species invasions in relation to fire.  
In response to the threat of high severity fire and these undesirable consequences, 
managers are increasing applying fuels treatments, such as thinning and burning, in ponderosa 
pine forests. These treatments generally reduce fire severity where applied (Pollet and Omi, 
2002; Finney et al., 2005; Fulé et al., 2012). Unfortunately, the disturbance caused by the fuels 
reduction treatments can also lead to exotic species invasions (Keeley, 2006; McGlone et al., 
2009; Sabo et al., 2009). 
 
The 2002 Rodeo-Chediski Fire of east-central Arizona burned approximately 189,000 
hectares in ponderosa pine forests and pinyon-juniper (Pinus edulis Engelm.–Juniperus 

12 
 
deppeana Steud.) woodlands. At the time, this fire was the largest fire on record in the 
Southwest by an order of magnitude, and much of it burned severely. Since the fire burned over 
areas where landscape-scale fuels treatments were conducted, it offered an exceptional 
opportunity to examine the effects of fire severity and pre-fire treatment on vegetation 
response. We re-measured existing plots in the Rodeo-Chediski Fire in order to examine longer-
term trends, specifically focusing on patterns of exotic species invasions and pine regeneration. 
The plots were originally established in 2004, when both overstory, understory and fuels 
characteristics were measured, and re-visited in 2005, when the understory characteristics were 
measured again (Strom, 2005; Kuenzi, 2006; Strom and Fulé, 2007; Kuenzi et al., 2008).  
Chapter 2 presents data from the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest portion of the fire, 
where we re-measured paired pre-fire thinned and unthinned sites in 2011. In order to assess 
how pre-fire treatment, and the resultant severity, influenced plant communities through time 
we conducted a repeated measures analysis on the three years for which we have data (2004, 
2005, 2011). Chapter 3 presents data from the White Mountain Apache Tribal land, where we 
re-measured plots stratified by fire severity (low and high) and pre-fire treatment (untreated, or 
cut and burned). This allowed us to more discretely quantify vegetation response in relation to 
severity. It also enabled us to examine how treatment influenced the vegetation response 
within both low and high severity burned areas. Finally, Chapter 4 offers management 
recommendations based on our findings. We hope our analyses of these longer-term datasets 
help managers to better understand how pre-fire treatments may influence post-fire plant 
communities and future forest regeneration.

CHAPTER 2 
 
The influence of pre-fire fuel reduction treatments on post-wildfire plant community dynamics 
through time 
 
ABSTRACT 
We used a multi-year dataset from the 2002 Rodeo-Chediski Fire to detect post-fire 
trends in plant community response in burned ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson) 
forests of east-central Arizona. Within the burn perimeter, we examined the effects of pre-fire 
fuels treatments on post-fire vegetation recovery by comparing paired thinned and unthinned 
sites on the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest. We sampled these paired sites in 2004, 2005 
and 2011. There were significant differences in plant community composition by species cover 
data in 2004 and 2005, but community composition in treated and untreated plots was 
beginning to converge in 2011. Total plant cover was significantly higher in untreated areas for 
all three years. Plant cover generally increased between 2004 and 2005 and markedly decreased 
in 2011, with the exception of shrubs which steadily increased through time. The sharp decrease 
in forb and graminoid cover in 2011 is likely due in part to the well below-average precipitation 
in the previous year. Annual/biennial forb and graminoid cover decreased relative to perennial 
cover through time, consistent with the patterns predicted by the initial floristics hypothesis. In 
contrast to our expectations, exotic plant response on these sites was highly variable and not 
limited to the immediate post-fire, annual/biennial community. Mean exotic species cover was 
slightly higher in the untreated areas, and this difference approached significance, but the 
overall cover values were quite low for all years (<2.5%). Despite these low cover values, 
Tragopogon dubius (yellow salsify), Verbascum thapsus (common mullien), Bromus inermis 
(smooth brome) and Eragrostis curvula (weeping lovegrass) increased in frequency and the 

17 
 
relative cover of exotic to native forbs and graminoids also increased through time. These 
patterns may be cause for concern, since a continual build-up ofpropagules could enable 
significant invasions in the future. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Throughout the western U.S., fuels treatments such as thinning and burning are being 
increasingly applied in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson) forests to reduce overly 
dense stands and reduce crown fire risk. Several studies have documented significant reductions 
in fire severity where pre-fire fuels treatments had been conducted (Pollet and Omi, 2002; 
Finney et al., 2005; Fulé et al., 2012). Reducing the risk of high severity burning in ponderosa 
pine forests is of particular concern because these ecosystems are poorly adapted to such large-
scale stand replacing fires, due to their evolutionary history of frequent, low severity surface 
fires (Cooper, 1960; Covington and Moore, 1994; Fulé et al., 2003). 
Large, stand replacing fires in southwestern ponderosa pine forests are creating novel 
conditions, and thus future plant community trajectories are not easily predicted. These areas 
have the potential to convert to persistent shrublands or grasslands (Savage and Mast, 2005), 
and even if pines do recapture these sites, it could take decades (Haire and McGarigal, 2008, 
2010). Plant communities in severely burned areas are likely to remain distinct from those in 
forested areas for many years (Bataineh et al., 2006) and such changes to native vegetation 
could have significant ramifications on a number of trophic levels, including herbivores, 
pollinators, as well as on native wildlife communities (Beier et al., 2008). 
Given the predictions for a warmer and drier climate in the Southwest (Seager et al., 
2007), these large-scale high severity fire events are likely to continue, which means that fuels 
treatments are also likely to become more and more prevalent on the landscape. A number of 

18 
 
studies have examined plant community responses to fire severity (Foxx, 1996; Crawford et al., 
2001; Griffis et al., 2001; Barclay et al., 2004; Laughlin and Fulé, 2008), or to fuels reduction 
treatments (Laughlin et al., 2004; Moore et al., 2006; Stoddard et al., 2011). However, few 
studies have examined post-wildfire plant community response relative to pre-fire treatment 
(but see Hunter et al. 2006 and Kuenzi et al. 2008). In addition, most of these previous studies 
were carried out only in the first few years post-fire, limiting our understanding of post-fire 
successional change through time (but see Foxx 1996 and Bataineh et al. 2006). 
The initial floristics hypothesis predicts that post-disturbance plant community dynamics 
are determined in large part by life history characteristics (Egler, 1954). Under this hypothesis, 
early post-disturbance communities are dominated by annual/biennial forbs and graminoids 
that are well suited to the immediate post-disturbance environment. The dominance of these 
species then give way to the slower growing, later successional species such as perennial 
herbaceous plants and woody shrubs. Observational studies generally support this hypothesis, 
at least in terms of the prevalence of annual/biennial species in the early post-fire environment 
(Keeley et al., 1981; Turner et al., 1997; Crawford et al., 2001; Barclay et al., 2004; Schoennagel 
et al., 2004; Bataineh et al., 2006; Laughlin and Fulé, 2008; Sabo et al., 2009). Similarly, 
annual/biennial species can also respond positively to lower-severity disturbances such as 
prescribed fire (Laughlin et al., 2004; Moore et al., 2006; Sabo et al., 2009), although this 
response is less consistent, since at least one study did not detect differences between areas 
that were or were not treated with prescribed fire (Scudieri et al., 2010). 
 
This successional pattern is important in part because some exotic species may fill such 
opportunistic roles immediately post-fire.  Although exotic species exhibit a myriad of plant 
strategies and tolerances (Martin et al., 2009), many are ruderal, annual or biennial species, that 
are well adapted to colonizing disturbed areas (Grime, 1977; Sutherland, 2004). In addition, 

19 
 
many exotic species are also shade-intolerant, making severely burned sites more suitable 
habitat than forests with an intact canopy for these species (Weaver et al., 2001; Sutherland, 
2004). A recent review by Moles et al. (2012) found that changes to a disturbance regime 
explained more variation in exotic response than disturbance per se. Ponderosa pine forests of 
the Southwest have indeed experienced a change in the disturbance regime with the onset of 
large-scale, high severity fires. Numerous studies have linked high severity fire with exotic 
species invasions in semi-arid ecosystems (Crawford et al., 2001; Floyd et al., 2006; Dodge et al., 
2008; Rew and Johnson, 2010), but others have documented a limited exotic response (Fornwalt 
et al., 2003; Huisinga et al., 2005; Kuenzi et al., 2008; McMaster, 2010), making predictions 
about exotic response to fire difficult. In addition to fire severity, disturbances associated with 
fuels reduction treatments may also facilitate exotic species response (Sieg et al., 2003; Korb et 
al., 2005; McGlone et al., 2009; Sabo et al., 2009). Increasing our understanding of exotic 
response to fire and fuels treatments is crucial, because exotic species invasions have the 
potential to displace native species (Rejmanék et al., 2005) and some can alter future fire 
regimes (Brooks et al., 2004). 
In this study, we examine the effects of pre-fire treatment on plant community response 
over time. We build on an investigation by Strom and Fulé (2007), who examined the effects of 
pre-fire treatment on fire severity and post-fire forest structure on the 2002 Rodeo-Chediski fire 
of east-central Arizona. They observed that the untreated areas were generally severely burned, 
where there were few surviving overstory trees and the associated near-total loss of canopy 
cover (Strom and Fulé, 2007). To examine understory plant community response to treatment, 
we measured understory plant community characteristics in 2004, 2005 and 2011, using a 
subset of the plots installed by Strom and Fulé (2007). Our objective was to address the 
following questions:  

20 
 
1)  How did understory plant community response differ between the pre-fire treated  
areas that generally burned less severely, and the pre-fire untreated areas that were 
generally more severely burned? Were these differences consistent through time?  
2)  Did annual/biennial cover decrease relative to perennial cover as expected under the 
initial floristics hypothesis, and was this pattern more pronounced in the pre-fire 
untreated areas?  
3)  Was exotic species response stronger in the early post-fire community, or was it 
persistent through time?  
 
METHODS 
Study area 
The study area lies south of the Mogollon Rim in east-central Arizona in the Black Mesa 
and Pinedale Ranger Districts of the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest. Precipitation by water 
year was well below the 60-year average for measurement years 2004 and 2011, above average 
for 2005, and generally below average for the nine years of post-fire vegetation recovery (Figure 
1). The average water year precipitation was 45.0 cm, and individual measurement year 
precipitation was as follows: 31.6 cm in 2004, 54.1 cm in 2005 and 30.6 cm in 2011. Average 
annual snowfall for 1950-2011 was 102.4 cm. Winter snowfall was significantly lower than the 
61-year average for all three measurement years, ranging from approximately 49% of average in 
the winter of 2003/2004, 22% of average for 2004/2005 and 18% of average for 2010/2011. The 
maximum average monthly temperature was 29.2° C, which occurred in July and the minimum 
average monthly temperature was -8.7° C, which occurred in January. Weather data from 1950-
2011 recorded at the Heber Ranger Station are available from the Western Regional Climate 
Center (www.wrcc.dri.edu).

Site selection 
We used the same 14 paired sites sampled by Strom and Fulé (2007). The treated sites 
were originally selected where treatment had occurred within 12 years prior to the fire. The 
untreated sites were in adjacent untreated areas of similar topography with no natural firebreak 
between the treated and untreated areas. The treatments were non-commercial thinning, 
followed by pile burning of the slash (except for one site where slash was lopped and scattered 
and one where slash was crushed) (Strom and Fulé, 2007). In addition, ongoing fuelwood 
collection and salvage logging has taken place in some of these areas, as well as intermittent 
livestock grazing (Gayle Richardson, U.S. Forest Service, Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, 
personal communication). 
The entire burn area on the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest was seeded immediately 
after the wildfire in 2002 and again in 2003. In 2002 the seed mix contained: Hordeum vulgare L. 
(common barley), Lolium perenne L. (annual rye), Elymus trachycaulus (Link) Gould ex Shinners 
(slender wheatgrass), and Bromus marginatus Nees ex Steud. (mountain brome) (B. marginatus 
= B. carinatus Hook. & Arn. (Welsh et al., 1993)). In 2003 the seed mix where our plots were 
located contained: Pascopyrum smithii (Rydb.) A. Löve (western wheatgrass), Bouteloua 
curtipendula (Michx.) Torr. (sideoats grama), Festuca ovina L. (sheep fescue), Koeleria 
macrantha (Ledeb.) J.A. Schultes (prairie junegrass), Penstemon palmeri Gray (Palmer’s 
penstemon), and H. vulgare (Kuenzi, 2006).  
Measurement  
We measured overstory structure in 2004 and 2011, and understory plant community 
characteristics in 2004, 2005 and 2011. Understory characteristics were measured on a subset of 
the plots established by Strom and Fulé (2007). Each of the 14 sites originally had six subsample 

22 
 
plots, for a total of 42 plots per pre-fire treatment (84 plots total). In 2005 one plot was not re-
located, and in 2011 we were unable to re-locate three additional plots, so that two untreated 
sites had five subsample plots and one site had only four, for a total of 80 plots. We used a 
variable-radius prism plot (basal area factor 2.3 m2/ha) for overstory trees, on which we 
recorded the tree species and measured diameter at breast height (DBH, 1.37 m) for each tree 
in the plot. We used a hemispherical fisheye lens (Nikon CoolPix E4300 and FC-E8 Fisheye 
Converter Lens) to photograph canopy cover, and analyzed these photographs using the Gap 
Light Analyzer (Institute of Ecosystem Studies, 1999) to quantify percent canopy openness. In 
addition, we re-photographed the plot overview to record a series of plot images through time. 
We measured understory characteristics using two perpendicular 44.8-m transects to 
create the 1000-m2 plot. Along each transect, we measured plant canopy by six cover classes in 
ten 20- X 50-cm quadrats, for a total of 20 quadrats per plot (Daubenmire, 1959). Cover data 
was recorded by life form and nativity as well as by species, including trees shorter than 1.37 m. 
We estimated cover by species and by life forms separately, so cover of overlapping plants was 
not counted twice. We estimated cover by life history strategy (annual/biennial, perennial) post-
hoc by adding the individual species cover data, so totals may include overlapping plants. Finally, 
we generated a species occurrence list for the entire plot area. 
Plant nomenclature and nativity followed the USDA-NRCS PLANTS Database (USDA-
NRCS, 2011). One exception was Portulaca oleracea L. (little hogweed), which was listed as 
“introduced” on the PLANTS database, but along with Kuenzi et al. (2008) we classified it as 
“native” based on Byrne and McAndrews (1975). When we were unable to identify plants to 
species, we classified them to the lowest taxonomic level we could identify with certainty, 
generally to the genus level.  
 

23 
 
Statistical Methods 
Since the measurement plots at each site were subsamples, we averaged them to the 
site level for all analyses (total n = 14). We based all plant community analyses on the subset of 
species that occurred in at least 5% of the plant cover quadrats, and richness analyses on 
species that occurred on at least 5% of the plot species lists, in order to reduce the influence of 
uncommon species (McCune and Grace, 2002). We conducted multivariate analyses of plant 
community differences for each year separately. We analyzed each year with a one-way 
perMANOVA, a non-parametric permutation procedure, on pre-fire treatment (treated, 
untreated) in PC-ORD (McCune and Mefford, 1999) using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measure 
with 9999 permutations at an alpha level of 0.05 (n = 14). 
We graphically displayed the plant community data at the plot level in ordination space, 
using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). We conducted 250 runs with real data and 
250 runs on randomizations from a random starting point, with an instability criterion of 
0.00001. We chose the final number of axes based on stress levels <15 with p-values <0.05 
(Peck, 2010). Finally, we used PC-ORD to identify indicator species for each treatment, based on 
relative frequency and percent cover for each species. Species with an indicator value ≥ 25 and a 
p-value (based on a Monte Carlo test) < 0.05 were considered indicator species for that 
treatment (Dufrene and Legendre, 1997). Since we suspected that plant community differences 
may be related to overstory structure variables, we overlaid tree density, basal area and canopy 
openness on the multivariate ordinations of the sampling plots. 
For all univariate response variables, such as cover by life form and life history strategy, 
species richness, tree density, canopy openness and basal area, we used a generalized linear 
model to perform repeated-measures tests on year and treatment in SAS, Version 9.2 (SAS 
Institute, 1999). Based on inspection of the data, we selected distributions for tree density 

24 
 
(negative binomial), richness (Poisson) and basal area (lognormal). For plant canopy cover data, 
we used a beta distribution since it is customarily used to model continuous percentages. 
Because this distribution is not inclusive of the end points (0 or 1), we re-scaled the data to 
eliminate zero values, using the transformation method described in Smithson and Verkuilen 
(2006). We evaluated pairwise comparisons for year when the main effect was significant. 
Where an interaction was significant at alpha = 0.05 (or approached significance at alpha ≤ 
0.10), we generated post-hoc contrasts for treatment within year, and between years for a given 
treatment. 
 
RESULTS 
We documented the presence of a total of 384 species from 199 genera and 51 families; 
of these, there were a total of 39 exotic species from 11 families, mostly from Poaceae (14). For 
multivariate plant community analyses on cover we focused on the 104 species found on at 
least 5% of the quadrats, and for richness analyses we focused on the 163 species found on at 
least 5% of the plots, of which 16 were exotic species (Table 1).  
Overall plant community response 
To assess treatment effects on the overall plant community, we focused on plant 
composition from species cover data, the related overstory structure variables, species richness 
and cover by life form. We detected significant differences in plant cover by species between 
treated and untreated plant communities in 2004 (p = 0.039) and 2005 (p = 0.025), but this 
difference waned in 2011 (p = 0.10). The ordinations for each year reflect the distinction 
between treated and untreated plant communities of 2004 and 2005 and the less distinct plant 
communities in 2011 (Figure 2). The overstory structure variables we overlaid on these 

25 
 
ordinations (basal area, tree density and canopy openness) varied in how they changed between 
the 2004 and 2011 measurements. 
Basal area was significantly lower in untreated areas (p = 0.0004) but did not differ by 
year (Figure 3). Since there were significant treatment-by-year interactions for both tree density 
and canopy openness (Table 2), we investigated contrasts for treatment differences within years 
and within treatment through time. Canopy openness was significantly greater in untreated 
areas in both 2004 (p = 0.0017) and 2011 (p = 0.0007); however when looking at treatments 
through time, canopy openness did not differ between years in untreated areas, but the canopy 
openness decreased from 2004 to 2011 in treated areas (p = 0.0029; Figure 3). Tree density was 
significantly lower in untreated areas in 2004 (p = 0.0001) when compared to treated areas. In 
2011, this trend reversed in terms of mean tree density, but the difference was not significant (p 
= 0.89, Figure 3). This reversal was driven by one plot each at two of the sites, where the density 
counts of Juniperus deppeana Steud. (alligator juniper) were exceptionally high (271 trees ha-1 at 
one plot and 2,955 trees ha-1 on another). Tree density in treated areas did not change 
significantly between 2004 and 2011 (p =1.00). 
Total plant cover was significantly higher in untreated than treated areas, and was 
highest in 2005 and lowest in 2011, and these differences were also significant (Table 2, Figure 
4). We also examined plant cover differences by life form. Since the treatment-by-year 
interaction was significant for tree regeneration cover, we conducted post-hoc contrasts and 
found significantly higher cover in untreated areas in 2011 over 2004 (p = 0.0054) and 2005 (p = 
0.0018). Mean shrub cover was higher in untreated areas, although this difference only 
approached significance (p = 0.058); however, mean shrub cover increased through time and in 
2011 was significantly higher than in 2004 and 2005 (Table 2, Figure 4). Shrub species 
dominance shifted from slightly higher cover of Ceanothus fendleri A. Gray (Fendler’s ceanothus) 

26 
 
over Arctostaphylos pungens Kunth (pointleaf manzanita) in 2004, to five times greater cover of 
A. pungens relative to C. fendleri in 2011. 
Forb cover was significantly higher in untreated areas (p = 0.0046). This was driven 
primarily by four annual or annual/biennial species, Bahia dissecta (A. Gray) Britton (ragleaf 
bahia), Chenopodium graveolens Willd. (fetid goosefoot), Conyza canadensis (L.) Cronquist 
(Canadian horseweed) and Polygonum douglasii Greene (Douglas’ knotweed), as well as the 
perennial Heliomeris mulitflora Nutt. (showy goldeneye). H. multiflora was an indicator species 
of untreated areas for all three years. Forb cover was also significantly different for all years, 
where the mean trend followed that of total cover (highest in 2005, lowest in 2011). Forb 
species with the highest cover values generally followed this trend with the exception of annual 
species P. douglasii and C. graveolens, which steadily declined over time.  
Graminoids also followed this general pattern of mean cover over time (highest in 2005, 
lowest in 2011), and this difference was significant among all years. Of the individual graminoid 
species, only the annual Muhlenbergia minutissima (Steud.) Swallen (annual muhly), 
consistently declined in cover over the years. Of the higher cover graminoid species (>1%), the 
seeded B. carinatus did increase in 2005 but declined much more markedly in 2011 than the 
other graminoids, to <0.1%. Although mean graminoid cover was slightly higher for untreated 
areas, this difference was not significant (p = 0.44).  
Overall species richness was not significantly different by treatment, but was 
significantly higher in 2005 than 2004 (p = 0.0011).The indicator species for each treatment 
varied through time (Table 3). As noted above, the only consistent indicator species for all three 
years was the perennial forb H. multiflora for untreated areas. The untreated areas had more 
indicator species than untreated areas, including one seeded species (B. carinatus) in 2005, and 
one exotic species, Tragopogon dubius Scop. (yellow salsify), in 2011. Treated sites had no 

27 
 
indicators for 2004, the seeded perennial grass, K. macrantha, for 2005, and the perennial forb, 
Packera neomexicana (A. Gray) W.A. Weber & Á. Löve (New Mexico groundsel), for 2011. 
Annual/biennial and perennial response 
Mean annual/biennial cover (both forbs and graminoids) was significantly lower in 2011 
than in the previous measurements, and the higher mean response in untreated areas 
approached significance (p = 0.073) (Figure 5, Table 2). Perennial plant cover was significantly 
higher in untreated than treated areas, and also significantly different for each year. The ratio of 
perennial cover to annual/biennial cover changed dramatically over time, from the 2004 ratios 
1.6:1 and 1.7:1 in untreated and treated areas, respectively, to 9.0:1 and 10.4:1 in 2011 (Figure 
5). The changes in annual/biennial cover relative to perennial cover was not markedly more 
pronounced in the untreated areas, but the perennials to annual/biennial ratio was slightly 
lower in the untreated areas. For all years and both treatments, the majority of annual plant 
cover was from forb species, but the majority of perennial cover was from graminoid species. 
Exotic species response 
Exotic forb cover was significantly higher in 2005 than in 2004 or 2011, and the higher 
mean exotic forb cover in untreated areas approached significance (p = 0.071) (Figure 6, Table 
4). Mean exotic forb cover values for all years were consistently low, <2.5%. Exotic graminoid 
cover did not differ significantly by treatment or among years, and mean cover values were all 
<1%. Exotic species richness was not significantly different among years, but higher mean exotic 
species richness in untreated areas approached significance (p = 0.071) (Figure 5, Table 4). Mean 
exotic species richness was more similar between treatments in 2004 and 2005, but was 
somewhat higher in untreated areas (4.9) versus treated areas (3.0) in 2011. 
In addition to cover, we also examined turnover of exotic species in terms of frequency 
(presence/absence by plot) (Table 1). Several exotic forb species decreased between 2004 and 

28 
 
2011, including Chenopodium album L. (lambsquarters), Cirsium vulgare (Savi) Ten. (bull thistle), 
and Lactuca serriola L. (prickly lettuce). We note that identification uncertainties may confuse 
the trend for C. album. This species may have still been present in 2011, but along with Huisinga 
et al. (2005), the Chenopodium plants we encountered were juveniles that were not 
distinguishable from native Chenopodium species. If we were to assume our Chenopodium 
species were indeed C. album, then there was still an overall decrease from 34 of 80 plots in 
2004 and 15 of 80 plots in 2011. Verbascum thapsus L. (common mullein) and Taraxacum 
officionale F.H. Wigg. (common dandelion) frequency remained relatively constant, although 
mean V. thapsus cover increased slightly through time in untreated areas. T. dubius had the 
greatest consistent increase in frequency through time, from 37 of 80 plots in 2004 to 49 of 80 
plots in 2011, although overall cover changes were minimal. 
Exotic graminoid species decreasing in frequency between 2004 and 2011 were the 
annuals Bromus arvensis L. (field brome) and Bromus tectorum L. (cheatgrass), despite the slight 
increase in B. tectorum frequency in 2005. The perennial grasses Poa pratensis L. (Kentucky 
bluegrass) decreased while Poa compressa L. (Canada bluegrass) increased, but we suspect 
there may have been identification errors between these similar species; when combined, there 
was an increase from 10 to 26 of 80 plots. In addition, two other perennial grass species strongly 
increased in frequency. The strongly rhizomatous Bromus inermis Leyss. (smooth brome) 
increased from 4 to 19 of 80 plots, and Eragrostis curvula (Shrad.) Nees (weeping lovegrass) was 
first detected in 2011 on a total of 18 of 80 plots. Of the two exotic species seeded as part of the 
post-fire rehabilitation effort the annual L. perrene was detected in early years, but was absent 
from any plots by 2011. In contrast, the seeded perennial F. ovina was first detected on 2 plots 
in 2011.

DISCUSSION 
Overall plant community response 
Plant community composition by species cover data was distinct between pre-fire 
treated and untreated areas in 2004 and 2005 but not in 2011, and ordinations reflected this 
trend toward convergence. We suspected that the differences in the plant communities were 
driven by overstory structure differences, yet these overstory structure variables did not change 
much through time, with the exception of slightly less canopy openness in treated areas and 
increased tree density in untreated areas (which was driven by two plots). Since the relative 
differences between these plant communities did change, other factors likely influenced this 
convergence through time. 
We speculate that our study design may be one of these factors. First, unlike some of 
the high severity burn areas sampled on the White Mountain Apache Tribal lands (Chapter 3), 
the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest study design is based on paired sites, where the 
untreated areas are all in close proximity to areas that burned less severely. This proximity likely 
facilitated faster colonization than may have occurred in the interior of larger high severity burn 
patches (Turner et al., 1998). However, the convergence in the understory herbaceous 
communities is only part of the picture. The lack of overstory structure and shrub dominance 
still indicate a different overall vegetation community compared to the treated areas, when 
considering all strata.  
We also suspect that our sampling protocols, which were adequate in 2004 and 2005, 
may have underestimated the regeneration of several important tree species in 2011. Our cover 
transects only sampled tree regeneration under breast height, because of the intention to 
sample species defined as trees, that are also above breast height, in the variable radius plots. 
Several important species in this community are sprouting species that are considered trees as 

30 
 
adults but have a shrub-like habit during early growth stages (such as Quercus gambelii Nutt. 
(Gambel oak), J. deppeana, and Robinia neomexicana A. Gray (New Mexico locust)), as shown in 
the photographs in Figure 7. Because many of these species were over breast height in 2011, 
they were not included in our understory cover estimates. However, because of their shrub-like 
habit at this stage of growth, the small diameter leaders were rarely included in the variable 
radius plots, and thus this component of the vegetation community was probably under-
represented in our results. If these were species had been included in the quadrat cover 
estimates, this may have resulted in a significantly different plant community in 2011. 
Alternatively, if they had been accounted for in the overstory structure estimates, we may have 
detected greater and clearer trends in the overstory data used as vectors. We recommend an 
additional protocol to estimate this intermediate stratum in the future. Despite these caveats, in 
terms of future trajectories of these severely burned, untreated areas, it is encouraging that the 
understory herbaceous community is becoming more similar to that of the less severely burned, 
treated areas. 
We detected consistently higher total plant cover in the more severely burned areas, 
similar to patterns observed by Baitenah et al. (2006). Over time, mean total plant cover and 
cover by life form increased between 2004 and 2005, when higher plant cover in untreated 
areas was mostly forb species. The dramatic decrease in total plant, forb and graminoid cover in 
2011 may be related to competitive effects from increasing shrub cover on the untreated sites. 
The continual increase in shrub cover may be due to the slower-growing strategy of many shrub 
species that are likely to become stronger competitors later in time. Whereas A. pungens 
dominated the 2011 shrub community, C. fendleri was more strongly established in the first 
years post-fire, which may be related to heat-stimulated germination (Huffman and Moore, 
2004).  

31 
 
In addition to competition with shrubby species, several other factors are likely related 
to the dramatic decrease in forb and graminoid cover in 2011. First, droughty conditions in the 
years post-fire (Figure 1) likely further suppressed herbaceous response over time. Many studies 
in the Southwest have detected decreases in cover which they have linked with persistent 
drought (Bataineh et al., 2006; Moore et al., 2006). Second, herbaceous plants can respond 
positively to nitrogen pulses that occur in the first few years post-fire (Esque et al., 2010), and it 
is possible that the higher cover on our sites was responding to some degree to increased 
nutrient availability in 2004 and 2005 that may have been unavailable in 2011. Third, 
intermittent grazing in the area by both livestock and wild ungulates may also have reduced 
understory cover, but detailed records of grazing history were unavailable.  
Annual/perennial response 
The first interesting trend in annual/biennial forb and graminoid cover was higher mean 
annual/biennial cover in the untreated areas. Although this difference only approached 
significance, it is consistent with our expectations of a greater ruderal response in more heavily 
disturbed areas. It may also be related to the ongoing fuelwood collection and salvage logging 
that has taken place in some of these areas, which has likely created an ongoing, low-intensity 
disturbance.  
The second finding is that annual/biennial cover decreased relative to perennial species 
over time. In untreated areas, this offers general support for Egler’s initial floristics hypothesis, 
and emphasizes the importance of life history strategies in trends of secondary succession 
(Egler, 1954). In treated areas that were not set back to such an early seral stage, the post-fire 
response was similar to that observed in other ponderosa pine forests with more open stand 
structures that burned less severely. Moore et al. (2006) observed an increase in the standing 
crop of annuals/biennial forbs in thinned ponderosa pine stands that had forest floor 

32 
 
manipulation and burning, followed by a subsequent decline. In addition, in two studies from 
the North Rim of the Grand Canyon found increases in annual/biennial forb richness (Laughlin et 
al., 2004) as well as increases in annual/biennial forbs and grass cover (Laughlin and Fulé, 2008) 
in the first few years post-fire. 
Exotic species cover and richness  
Exotic species response was not limited to a ruderal, immediate post-fire role. In 
general, the exotic response was quite low (≤2.5% for all years) and highly variable, making the 
comparison of trends by life history strategy interesting, but not definitive. One general trend 
worth reporting, despite these limitations, is the higher proportion of mean exotic 
annual/biennial cover relative to native annual/biennial cover in 2011, particularly in untreated 
areas. This may suggest that the annual/biennial exotic species are more persistent than the 
native annual/biennial species through time.  
When considering exotic cover by life form, exotic forb cover was significantly higher in 
2005 than either of the other two years. These species were likely responding to increased 
moisture in 2005 and to droughty conditions in 2011, just as native forbs were. This is consistent 
with studies that demonstrate that exotic species generally respond to the same environmental 
conditions as native species (Meiners, 2007), although exotic graminoids did not show any 
consistent trend.  
The low overall exotic response on our sites is consistent with some other studies on 
high severity fires in the region (Foxx, 1996; Huisinga et al., 2005; Kuenzi et al., 2008; McMaster, 
2010). With the exception of Kuenzi et al. (2008), many of these areas were not as heavily 
managed as our study sites, which have been subjected to grazing, recreation, logging and road-
building (Kuenzi, 2006). When this is coupled with disturbance, our results are somewhat 
surprising as a number of studies have documented exotic species invasions in severely burned 

33 
 
ponderosa pine forests (Crawford et al., 2001; Griffis et al., 2001; Barclay et al., 2004; Dodge et 
al., 2008). However, it is problematic to compare the exotic response in our study to other 
studies in this region, because of differences in species classification. Some studies do not 
provide lists of observed exotic species (Griffis et al., 2001), and still others classified species 
such as Conyza canadensis (L.) Cronquist (Canadian horseweed) as exotic (Crawford et al., 2001; 
Barclay et al., 2004), which we consider native based on the USDA Plants database (USDA-NRCS, 
2011), local floras (Kearney et al., 1961) and field guides (Springer et al., 2009).  
Despite the overall low cover values we observed, there may be some cause for concern 
about exotic species on these sites. First, we detected an increase in the amount of exotic cover 
relative to overall cover by life form in untreated areas. The portion of exotic forb cover that 
comprises the overall forb cover increased from 1.6% in 2004 to 7.9% in 2011; relative exotic 
graminoid cover increases were slightly smaller, from 4.2% in 2004 to 5.9% in 2011. Although 
these numbers are not exceptionally large, these increases may allow exotic species to build up 
enough propagule pressure to facilitate a stronger invasion following another, future 
disturbance event, or significant precipitation (McGlone et al., 2009).  
The increase in frequency of certain exotic species through time also raises concerns. An 
experimental study in semi-arid sagebrush ecosystems found that T. dubius, a deeply tap-rooted 
perennial forb, could out-compete native grasses after disturbance due to its ability to access 
deep water resources that were available after the loss of the foundation species (Prevey et al., 
2010a; Prevey et al., 2010b). This species was an indicator species in 2011 and had the greatest 
increase in frequency on untreated sites during our study; since droughty conditions are 
expected to continue in the Southwest (Seager et al., 2007), this species may further proliferate 
in the future. Finally, the appearance of the exotic perennial bunchgrass, E. curvula, in 2011 may 
also be of concern. This species was seeded on the Dude Fire, and remained the dominant cover 

34 
 
(93%) 15 years post-fire, suggesting it can persist on the landscape (Leonard, 2007). In addition, 
it responds well to burning (McFarland and Mitchell, 2000), and since it is now established in the 
area, future fires may greatly increase the presence of this species on the local landscape. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
There is now a substantial body of research on exotic species invasions after severe fire 
in the Southwest, yet no clear patterns have emerged. Studies have found varying rates of 
invasion on landscapes that both were and were not heavily managed (disturbed pre-fire). Given 
the differences in exotic species composition and abundance across such fires, local site-specific 
factors are likely driving exotic response. Although the disturbance of high severity fire can open 
up growing space for exotic species, on-site propagules, post-fire management practices and 
weather patterns may be the more important drivers of exotic response. 
Our data dosuggest that even if exotic species do not heavily invade such an intensely 
disturbed ecosystem immediately post-fire, they have the potential to increase over time. These 
sites should be monitored for further increases in exotic cover, since they are at risk for heavier 
invasions in the future. In addition, many of the exotic species we observed have been either 
seeded as part of post-fire rehabilitation or otherwise intentionally introduced (E. curvula, P. 
pratensis, Melilotus officinalis (L.) Lam. (sweetclover), D. glomerata ) (Fowler et al., 2008; 
Wolfson and Sieg, In prep); more generally, since seed mixes can be contaminated with exotic 
species, past seeding practices in the area may have introduced some of the exotics we detected 
(Fowler et al., 2008; Peppin et al., 2010). Seeding exotic species in the future is not 
recommended, and even native seed should be applied with caution due to the potential for 
exotic seed contamination. 

35 
 
Finally, Strom and Fulé (2007) detected significant reductions in fire severity in areas 
treated before the Rodeo-Chediski Fire, and our data show that those treatments also had a 
persistent effect on vegetation response nine years post-fire. Our data suggest that pre-fire 
treatments can help maintain native plant communities associated with an intact ponderosa 
pine forest.

CHAPTER 3 
Pre-fire management treatments have lasting effects on post-fire plant community response 
 
ABSTRACT 
High severity fires in ponderosa pine forests of the Southwest have been increasing in 
frequency and extent. Severely burned areas have the potential to result in persistent type 
conversions to shrublands or grasslands, and they have also been associated with exotic species 
invasions. In response to the risk of high severity fire, land managers are routinely applying fuel 
reduction treatments to increase forest resilience, yet how these treatments may influence 
post-fire recovery in the longer-term is not well known. We re-measured existing plots on the 
2002 Rodeo-Chediski Fire eight years after burning to detect longer-term trends in pine 
regeneration, as well as plant community and exotic species response. We compared high and 
low severity burned areas, and also examined how pre-fire treatment (cutting in an uneven-
aged harvesting system with prescribed fire) modified vegetation response within severity class. 
We detected persistent differences between low and high severity areas, including significantly 
higher overall plant cover and shrub cover, and higher species richness on high severity areas. 
We also detected significantly higher exotic forb cover in high severity areas than in low severity 
areas, although overall exotic response was generally quite low (<1%). This represents a slight 
decrease in exotic cover since the initial 2004/2005 measurements; however, the frequency of 
several exotic species increased through time. On finer scales, pre-fire treatments modified 
several vegetation response variables that are ecologically important due to their influence on 
future reforestation in high severity areas. Where the burning conditions resulted in high 
severity fire in pre-fire treated areas, the overall patch size of high severity was reduced and 
resulted in a more heterogeneous mixture of low and moderate severity burning in the 

54 
 
neighborhood. This pattern decreased distance to seed source and was linked to higher 
frequency of pine regeneration. Fuels treatments are important because they reduce fire 
severity where applied. Our data provide additional support for conducting these treatments, 
because even where treated areas do burn severely, pre-fire treatments modify the 
heterogeneity of severity patterns to include more low and moderate severity areas in the 
neighborhood, which can influence forest regeneration. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Severe large-scale fires, linked to uncharacteristically high fuels (Covington and Moore, 
1994) and climate warming (Westerling et al., 2006), have raised several important concerns 
about post-fire plant communities in the ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson) 
forests of the Southwest, three of which we examine here. First, extensive forest areas that 
have burned severely may result in persistent conversions to shrublands or grasslands, rather 
than regenerate as forest (Savage and Mast, 2005), particularly under a warmer and drier 
climate (Seager et al., 2007). The unprecedented size of high severity burned areas necessarily 
means that post-fire pine regeneration in these areas is not well understood, because it is 
occurring in relatively novel conditions. In addition, high severity fire may promote sprouting 
species over seeding species (such as ponderosa pine), because early site capture by sprouting 
species may limit seeder species establishment through competition for resources (Fulé and 
Covington, 1998; Barton, 2002). Furthermore, ponderosa pine can be considered a foundation 
species in these communities because it defines community structure by creating locally stable 
conditions for other species, and modulates fundamental ecosystem processes. The loss of a 
foundation species over large, landscape-scale areas can create novel species assemblages and 
degrade native habitats (Ellison et al., 2005). 

55 
 
Exotic species invasions are another important concern since numerous studies have 
documented invasions following high severity fire events (Crawford et al., 2001; Griffis et al., 
2001; Floyd et al., 2006; Dodge et al., 2008), which may not only impact native plant 
communities, but may also alter future fire regimes (Brooks et al., 2004). Yet these invasions are 
not entirely predictable, since other high severity fire studies in the Southwest have 
documented a low exotic response (Foxx, 1996; Huisinga et al., 2005; Kuenzi et al., 2008). Lastly, 
the extent to which pre-fire treatments will influence post-fire successional pathways is of 
concerns as land managers are routinely applying fuel reduction treatments (thinning and/or 
burning) to increase forest resilience and reduce high severity fire risk (Baron et al., 2009). These 
treatments generally reduce fire severity by reducing surface fuels, and reducing tree density 
and canopy connectivity (Pollet and Omi, 2002; Finney et al., 2005; Strom and Fulé, 2007; 
Cochrane et al., 2012; Fulé et al., 2012), yet the influence of extreme fire weather conditions 
and topography can occasionally result in high severity fire in treated areas. Whether they burn 
under low or high severity, pre-fire treatments are likely to have long-term influences on post-
fire recovery.  
To investigate the longer-term effects of pre-wildfire treatments on pine regeneration 
and exotic response, we re-measured existing plots established after the 2002 Rodeo-Chediski 
Fire of northeastern Arizona (Strom, 2005; Kuenzi et al., 2008). These plots were originally 
installed in 2004, when herbaceous understory, fuels, and forest structure response variables 
were measured in relation to fire severity and pre-fire treatment. Kuenzi et al. (2008) found that 
low and high severity areas had markedly different plant communities two and three years post-
fire, which they primarily attributed to the near-complete loss of overstory trees in high severity 
areas (Kuenzi et al., 2008). These early differences indicated two drastically different vegetation 
types on the landscape: (1) in the absence of another high severity fire event, the low severity 

56 
 
areas are likely to remain pine-dominated systems, whereas (2) high severity areas have the 
potential to convert to other vegetation types (Savage and Mast, 2005; Strom and Fulé, 2007; 
Haire and McGarigal, 2010). Our first hypothesis was that marked differences in plant 
communities between low and high severity areas would persist eight years post-fire 
(Hypothesis 1: Low versus high severity fire areas). 
The 2004 data also show that low severity treated areas that were treated pre-fire had a 
more open structure (lower tree density and basal area, and higher canopy openness) than 
untreated low severity areas (Kuenzi et al., 2008). We hypothesized that these trends in 
overstory structure variables would persist through 2010, leading to higher plant canopy cover, 
greater species richness, and higher frequencies of pine regeneration in relation to reduced tree 
canopy cover and a lower density of competing trees (Hypothesis 2: Treatment effects in low 
severity areas). 
Third, the initial investigations documented that pre-fire treated areas had a lower 
percentage of high severity burning than untreated areas (Strom, 2005). We hypothesized that 
pre-fire treatment mitigated high severity fire and resulted in a more diverse mosaic of low and 
moderate severity in the “neighborhood” of our sampling sites. We then predicted that 
vegetation retention in low and moderate severity areas would provide both more seed sources 
and greater competition for resources in the neighborhood of treated sites, which would result 
in lower total plant cover, higher species richness and a higher relative frequency of pine 
regeneration (Hypothesis 3: Treatment effects in high severity fire areas). 
We deliberately discuss some of the same response variables (pine regeneration relative 
frequency, plant foliar cover, etc.) in separate hypotheses because, as noted above, we predict 
some response variables will behave differently based on treatment within each severity class.

METHODS  
Study area 
The study area lies south of the Mogollon Rim in east-central Arizona on the White 
Mountain Apache Tribal (WMAT) lands. For the eight years of post-fire vegetation recovery, 
precipitation by water year has generally been below the 60-year average (Figure 1). The 60-
year average by water year during this period was 45.0 cm, and total precipitation during 2010 
was 35.2 cm. Average annual snowfall in the area was 102.4 cm, and there were 99.8 cm of 
snow over the winter of 2009/2010, which is only slightly below the 60-year average. The 
average maximum and minimum monthly temperatures were 29.2° C in July and -8.7° C in 
January. Weather data were recorded at the Heber Ranger Station by the Western Regional 
Climate Center (www.wrcc.dri.edu). This weather station is located above the Rim at an 
elevation of 1,984 m (16-311 m lower than the range of our study sites), approximately 12 km 
north of the study sites, on the edge of a ponderosa pine/pinyon-juniper transition zone and so 
may have recorded less precipitation and higher temperatures than our study sites experienced.  
The study sites were selected in 2004, ranging in elevation from 2,000 to 2,295 m, on 
slopes <45% (average slope was 17.6%) (Strom, 2005; Kuenzi et al., 2008). Study sites were 
stratified by severity classes (low and high), and by pre-fire management of (1) no treatment or 
(2) cut in an uneven-aged harvesting system and subsequently burned under prescription 
(hereafter: untreated, treated). Fire severity classes were determined by a combination of 
remotely sensed Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (ΔNBR) maps and ground-truthing (Strom 
2005). Pre-fire treatment areas were selected using treatment history data provided by the tribe 
and only included treatments conducted within 11 years prior to the Rodeo-Chediski Fire.  
The high severity study areas were seeded immediately post-fire. The seed mix used on 
the WMAT lands included Triticum aestivum L. (common wheat), an exotic, but sterile, species 

58 
 
applied at a rate of 16.8 kg ha-1. The remainder of the seed mix included species native to the 
region, but the seed source is unknown and therefore may not represent locally native 
genotypes: Elymus trachycaulus (Link) Gould ex Shinners (slender wheatgrass), Pascopyrum 
smithii (Rydb.) A. Löve (western wheatgrass), Panicum virgatum L. (switchgrass), Nassella 
viridula (Trin.) Barkworth (green needlegrass), Bromus marginatus Nees ex Steud. (mountain 
brome) (Bromus marginatus = Bromus carinatus H. & A. (Welsh et al. 1993)), Bouteloua 
curtipendula (Michx.) Torr. (sideoats grama), Sporobolus cryptandrus (Torr.) Gray (sand 
dropseed), Coreopsis tinctoria Nutt. (plains coreopsis), Dalea purpurea Vent. (purple prairie 
clover), Linum lewisii Pursh (blue flax), and Rudbeckia hirta L. (black-eyed susan) (Kuenzi et al., 
2008).  
Measurement  
Six sites were originally installed within each of four treatment and severity 
combinations (total N = 24), with three subsample plots at each site. In 2010 we re-located 70 of 
the 72 original plots, such that two sites had only two subsample plots. All field protocols follow 
the original studies (Strom, 2005; Kuenzi et al., 2008). We used a variable-radius prism plot 
(basal area factor 2.3 m2/ha) for overstory trees, on which we measured diameter at breast 
height (DBH, 1.37 m) and tree height. We tallied all pine regeneration shorter than breast height 
in a 3.1-m radius circle. Since smaller seedlings generally have high mortality rates (Smith et al., 
1997), we were interested in separating the more established seedlings from the very small 
seedlings, and so divided them into two height classes, 0-40 cm and 41-137 cm. We used a 
hemispherical fisheye lens (Nikon CoolPix E4300 and FC-E8 Fisheye Converter Lens) to 
photograph canopy cover, and then quantified canopy openness using the Gap Light Analyzer 
(Institute of Ecosystem Studies, 1999). In addition, we re-took the plot overview photos in order 
to create a photograph series through time. 

59 
 
We measured understory characteristics using two perpendicular 44.8-m transects to 
create the 1000-m2 plot. Along each transect, we measured plant canopy cover from ten 20- X 
50-cm quadrats, for a total of 20 quadrats per plot (Daubenmire, 1959). We recorded cover data 
by life form and nativity as well as by species, including trees shorter than 1.37 m, and recorded 
a species list for the entire plot area.  
To directly compare our data, we followed Kuenzi et al.’s (2008) taxonomic and nativity 
classification which was based on the USDA-NRCS PLANTS database (USDA-NRCS, 2006). One 
exception they made was Portulaca oleracea L. (little hogweed), which was listed as 
“introduced” on the PLANTS database, but Kuenzi et al. (2008) classified it as “native” based on 
Byrne and McAndrews (1975). For species that were first detected in 2010, we used the more 
current USDA-NRCS PLANTS database (USDA-NRCS, 2011). When we were unable to identify 
plants to species, we classified them to the lowest taxonomic level we could identify with 
certainty, generally to the genus level.  
To quantify neighborhood severity surrounding high severity sampling sites, we defined 
the potential seed contribution area for a site based on seed dispersal distances, which have 
been estimated at 1.5 times tree height (McDonald, 1980). Since there is some variability in the 
literature regarding the minimum seed tree size (Pearson, 1950; Larson and Schubert, 1970) we 
selected an intermediate DBH of those reported, 40.6 cm (16 in). We calculated the average 
height of trees this size or larger across our entire study area and calculated the estimated 
dispersal distance to be approximately 36 m. We then generated a buffer at least 36 m from any 
subsample plot at each study site, which resulted in an overall circular site buffer of 180 m from 
site center (Figure 2). Then we used the dNBR severity map to count the number of low, 
moderate and high severity pixels within the potential seed contribution area, and averaged 

60 
 
these by treatment. For consistency, all pixels that partially intersected the buffer were also 
included in the pixel counts. 
Statistical Methods 
For all analyses, we used site level means (n = 24). For Hypothesis 1 (Low versus high 
severity), we analyzed plant community data using a combination of univariate and multivariate 
statistical tests as well as ordination techniques. All plant community analyses were based on 
the subset of species that occurred in at least 5% of the plant cover quadrats, and richness 
analyses were based on species that occurred on at least 5% of the plot species lists, in order to 
reduce the influence of uncommon species (McCune and Grace, 2002). For overall plant 
community composition we used PC-ORD software (McCune and Mefford, 1999) to perform 
two-way PerMANOVA tests, a non-parametric permutation procedure, on burn severity (high, 
low) and pre-fire treatment (untreated, treated). We used the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measure 
with 9999 permutations, with α = 0.05. We analyzed differences among univariate response 
variables such as cover by life form and nativity, species richness and pine regeneration relative 
frequency with PerMANOVAs in PC-ORD, using Euclidean distance (Anderson, 2001). 
To further examine our first hypothesis, that low and high severity areas remain distinct 
eight years post-fire, we graphically displayed community data in ordination space, using non-
metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). We conducted 250 runs with real data and 250 runs on 
randomizations from a random starting point, with an instability criterion of 0.00001. We chose 
the final number of axes based on stress levels <15 with p-values <0.05 (Peck, 2010). Finally, we 
also used PC-ORD to identify indicator species by severity, since the previous study documented 
that severity class had the strongest influence on the plant community (Kuenzi et al., 2008). 
Indicator species analysis yields a value based on relative frequency and percent cover for each 

61 
 
species. Species with an indicator value > 25 and a p-value (based on a Monte Carlo test) of < 
0.05 were considered indicator species for that severity class (Dufrene and Legendre, 1997).  
We examined the same vegetation response variables in hypotheses two (Treatment 
effects in low severity) and three (Treatment effects in high severity) as we did for hypothesis 
one. However, since we were interested in treatment effects within severity class, here we first 
examined the interaction of treatment and severity. Where the interaction was significant (α = 
0.05) or approached significance, we tested treatment effects within severity class with a 
PerMANOVA and generated an NMDS ordination, both with the same parameters outlined 
above for the full model. We used a liberal definition of approaching significance because we 
were concerned about missing important differences by treatment within severity class, so we 
further explored any variable with an interaction p-value ≤ 0.20.  
Finally, to test for differences in neighborhood severity for hypothesis 3 (Treatment 
effects in high severity), we lumped the low and moderate severity pixel percentages, since both 
severity classes were considered proxies for seed sources. We then tested the differences in the 
proportion of low/moderate severity area between treated and untreated areas with a t test 
using JMP (JMP, Version 7). 
 
RESULTS 
We documented the presence of a total of 329 species from 190 genera and 60 families. 
For multivariate plant community analyses on cover we focused on the 104 species found on at 
least 5% of the cover quadrats, and for richness analyses we focused on the 172 species found 
on at least 5% of the plot census data. There was a total of 22 exotic species from 8 families, 
most from Poaceae (9) and Asteraceae (5); 10 of these were found on at least 5% of the plots 
(Table 1). The results below are presented as they relate to each hypothesis. 

62 
 
Hypothesis 1: Low versus High Severity Fire Areas 
Low and high severity plant communities had significant differences in composition 
based on cover data by species (p = 0.0001). The NMDS ordination displays this distinction 
between low and high severity plant communities and how they align with differences in tree 
density, basal area and canopy openness, which are overlaid as vectors (Figure 3). PerMANOVA 
univariate tests for these vectors were all highly significant (p = 0.0001) between low and high 
severity areas, due to the loss of most overstory trees in high severity areas (Figure 4). These 
overstory structure drivers were linked with significantly higher total cover in high severity than 
low severity areas, a pattern reflected in the mean values for all life forms other than exotic 
graminoids. Shrub cover was a substantial component of the high severity area plant 
community, comprising nearly half of the mean total cover (Table 2, Figure 5). Additionally, the 
indicator species analysis included three shrub species for high severity areas: Arctostaphylos 
pringlei Parry (Pringle manzanita), Arctostaphylos pungens Kunth (pointleaf manzanita) and 
Ceanothus fendleri A. Gray (Fendler’s ceanothus). Other indicator species for high severity 
included three native graminoid species seeded post-fire: P. smithii, Panicum virgatum, B. 
curtipendula. Notably, no indicator species were detected for low severity areas due to highly 
variable plant community composition.  
Cover of exotic forbs was significantly higher (p = 0.004) in high severity areas but 
averaged <1% in both severities (0.66% in high severity areas and 0.008% in low severity areas). 
This difference was driven primarily by two species, Tragopogon dubius Scop. (yellow salsify) 
and Verbascum thapsus L. (common mullein), that were commonly found on high severity plots 
(32 of 35 plots and 30 of 35 plots, respectively). Although their overall cover values were low, 
the prevalence of these species is reflected in their designation as an indicator species of high 
severity areas (Table 3). 

63 
 
High severity areas also had significantly higher species richness than low severity areas 
(p = 0.0071). This was driven primarily by greater forb richness in high severity areas, where 
approximately 37 forb species were observed, versus 31 forb species in low severity areas. Pine 
regeneration density was highly variable. For the combined height classes, seedlings ha-1 ranged 
from 0 to 4283.2 in high severity areas and from 0 to 659.0 in low severity areas. In the 41-137 
cm height class, density averaged 888.9 (S.E. 309.5) seedlings ha-1 in high severity areas and 
13.73 (S.E. 13.73) seedlings ha-1 in low severity areas. To test our hypothesis, we focused on 
relative frequency of seedlings in the 41-137 cm height class, which were significantly more 
frequent (p = 0.0056) in high severity areas (0.51) compared to low severity areas (0.31) (Table 
4). 
Hypothesis 2: Treatment Effects in Low Severity Areas 
None of the forest structure variables in low severity areas were significantly different 
between treated and untreated areas (Table 2). However, treated areas had lower mean tree 
density and basal area, and higher mean percent canopy openness (Figure 4). Significant 
differences were detected for plant community composition based on cover data by species 
between treated and untreated areas in low severity (p = 0.047). We attempted to generate an 
NMDS ordination and list of indicator species, but the data were too variable to detect patterns 
in either case. 
Only forb cover was significantly higher in treated areas (p = 0.039), although mean 
cover values were higher in treated areas for all other metrics other than shrubs. Higher mean 
exotic graminoid cover in treated areas did approach significance (p = 0.057). This was driven 
primarily by one site with high cover values of Eragrotis curvula (Shrad.) Nees (weeping 
lovegrass), and several other sites with relatively high cover of Poa pratensis L. (Kentucky 
bluegrass).  

64 
 
Mean species richness was only slightly higher in treated areas (approximately 48 
species versus 45 in untreated) and this difference was not significant (p = 0.57). Pine seedling 
density was extremely variable in the combined height classes, ranging from 82.4 to 659.0 
seedlings ha-1 on treated sites versus 0 to 329.47 on untreated sites. In the 41-137 cm size class, 
there was an average of 123.6 (S.E. 84.4) in treated areas and 13.7 (S.E. 13.7) in untreated areas 
(Table 4). To test our hypothesis we focused on the average relative frequency of seedlings in 
the 41-137 cm height class, which was higher (0.17) in treated areas compared to untreated 
areas (0.06), although this difference was not significant (p = 0.73) (Table 4).  
Hypothesis 3: Treatment Effects in High Severity Areas 
The combined amount of low and moderate severity areas averaged 47.2% of the 
projected seed contribution area for untreated sites. This was significantly lower (p = 0.03) than 
the average of low and moderately burned areas (73.1%) at the treated high severity sites 
(Figure 6). Plant community composition based on cover data by species was significantly 
different between treated and untreated areas in high severity areas (p = 0.01), which is 
reflected in the NMDS ordination (Figure 7). Total cover was significantly higher in untreated 
areas (p = 0.03). The cover of other life forms did not differ significantly by treatment, although 
the means for all were higher in untreated areas as predicted (Table 2, Figure 5). Exotic forb and 
exotic graminoid cover also followed this trend, but the differences in means were < 0.07% and 
the standard errors were greater than their means, indicating exceptionally high variability. 
There was no significant difference in plant species richness between high severity 
treated and untreated areas, although mean richness was slightly higher in treated areas 
(approximately 59 species) versus untreated areas (approximately 53 species) (Table 2, Figure 
5). Pine seedling density in the combined height classes on treated sites ranged from 164.7 to 
4283.2 seedlings ha-1 versus 0 to 2347.5 seedlings ha-1 on untreated sites. In the 41-137 cm size 

65 
 
class, there was an average of 1345.4 (S.E. 435.7) seedlings ha-1 in treated areas and 432.44 (S.E. 
385.1) in untreated areas (Table 4). To test our hypothesis, we focused on relative pine 
regeneration frequency in the 41-137 cm height class, and found significantly more frequent 
pine regeneration in treated areas (0.67) than untreated areas (0.19) (p = 0.027) (Tables 2, 4).  
 
DISCUSSION  
Hypothesis 1: Low versus High Severity Areas 
Our hypothesis that fire severity had a persistent impact on post-fire vegetation 
characteristics eight years post-fire was upheld. We observed large and significant differences 
between low and high severity areas for almost all variables measured. In high severity areas, 
the resources made available after the loss of mature trees likely enabled higher understory 
plant canopy cover, of which nearly half was comprised of shrubs. The combination of few to no 
overstory trees and high shrub cover has resulted in shrub-dominated communities, unlike low 
severity areas where mature ponderosa pine dominance was maintained post-fire.  
These distinct high severity fire areas are of particular concern in part because high 
severity fires have been implicated in exotic species invasions in the ponderosa pine forests of 
the Southwest (Crawford et al., 2001; Griffis et al., 2001; Barclay et al., 2004; Dodge et al., 
2008). We found very low cover of exotic species overall, similar to findings by Huisinga et al. 
(2005) on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon and Foxx (1996) in northern New Mexico. Our 
2010 overall exotic cover value for all severity/treatment combinations was <2%, which is 
slightly lower than the <3% observed in 2004 and 2005 (Kuenzi et al., 2008), yet this difference is 
certainly within the range of potential observer differences. Drought conditions for the period of 
recovery may be contributing to the overall low exotic response, and low propagule pressure 
may also play a role (Lockwood et al., 2005).  

66 
 
In addition to low exotic cover, we found slightly lower exotic species richness than that 
reported in the initial investigation by Kuenzi et al. (2008). We observed a total of 23 exotic 
species, 11 of which were on at least 5% of the plots, whereas Kuenzi et al. (2008) observed 35 
species overall and 13 that occurred on at least 5% of the plots. Of the exotic species found on 
at least 5% of the plots, five species observed in 2004 and 2005 were not included on the 5% 
subset list in 2010: Agropyron desertorum (Fisch. ex Link) Schult. (desert wheatgrass), Dactylis 
gomerata L. (orchardgrass), T. aestivum, Cirsium vulgare (Savi) Ten. (bull thistle), and 
Chenopodium album L. (lambsquarters). Our lack of detection of C. album may not represent an 
actual change, since the Chenopodium plants we encountered were in a juvenile stage that did 
not allow us to distinguish between native and exotic Chenopodium species. The common wheat 
seeded immediately post-fire was frequent in 2004, infrequent in 2005 (Kuenzi et al. 2008), and 
entirely absent in 2010. Our data show that the annual cereal grain did quickly exit the system 
as intended by managers (Peppin et al., 2010). The remaining three exotic species from the 
2004/2005 observations were still observed in 2010, but they occurred on less than 5% of the 
plots. In addition, four exotic species that were observed infrequently in 2004/2005 were 
detected on at least 5% of plots in 2010: E. curvula, Poa compressa L. (Canada bluegrass), P. 
pratensis, and Erodium cicutarium (L.) L'Hér. ex Aiton (redstem stork's bill). Only the perennial 
forb, Sanguisorba minor Scop. (small burnet), was completely new in 2010, yet it occurred on 
only two plots. The perennial grass E. curvula was seeded in the course of past management 
activities before the Rodeo-Chediski Fire (Kuenzi et al. 2008). Many of the other exotic species 
we found are known to have been seeded as part of management activities throughout the 
Southwest: P. pratensis, S. minor, Melilotus officinalis (L.) Lam. (sweetclover), D. glomerata 
(Fowler et al., 2008; Wolfson and Sieg, in prep). Also, seed mixes can be contaminated with 

67 
 
exotic species, so past seeding practices in the area may have introduced some of the exotics we 
detected (Keeley, 2006; Fowler et al., 2008; Peppin et al., 2010). 
In contrast to earlier measurements, exotic forb cover was significantly higher in high 
severity fire areas, although it was still quite low at <1%. This difference was driven by the 
prevalence of two exotic forbs, T. dubius and V. thapsus. Although cover values for each were 
relatively low, the number of plots with these species steadily increased since the initial 
investigation in 2004, particularly for T. dubius. This species was found on 51.4% more high 
severity plots in 2010 than in 2004, and V. thapsus was found on 11.4% more high severity plots. 
This pattern is further reflected in by the designation of both species as indicator species for 
high severity in 2010, which was not the case in 2004 or 2005. The increase of V. thapsus 
through time in cover and frequency among plots was also observed on the Apache-Sitgreaves 
National Forest portion of this fire (discussed in Chapter 2), but is in contrast to the reductions 
detected elsewhere on the Rodeo-Chediski Fire. Ffolliot et al. (2011) found reductions in V. 
thapsus by five years post-fire, which is consistent with the reductions observed by Stoddard et 
al. (2010) after low severity restoration treatments. On our sites, the current prevalence of 
either T. dubius or V. thapsus may become cause for concern in the future if it enables 
widespread buildup of sufficient propagule pressure that could facilitate more significant 
invasions (Lockwood et al., 2005; Moles et al., 2012).  
Tracking these exotic species on high severity fires through time is important for 
management and for our understanding of invasion patterns, since the prevalent notion that 
high severity fire results in exotic species invasions is not always the case. Not only have several 
studies documented a low exotic response, but our ability to compare our data with other 
studies is limited because several studies that documented heavier invasions in the Southwest 
did not explicitly state which exotic species were observed (Griffis et al., 2001) and some used 

68 
 
different definitions of species’ nativity (Crawford et al., 2001; Barclay et al., 2004). Finally, the 
degree to which exotic species invasions are facilitated by disturbance has been called into 
question. A recent review by Moles et al. (2012) found that changes to disturbance regimes in a 
given ecosystem explained nearly twice as much variation in invasion events than historical 
disturbance regimes, but that the total variation explained by any sort of disturbance was <7%. 
Although we did find higher exotic cover in the high severity areas that would represent the 
changed disturbance regime, this difference was small, making the link with a changed 
disturbance regime unclear on our sites. 
Hypothesis 2: Treatment Effects in Low Severity Areas 
Our hypothesis that forest structure was more open in pre-fire treated areas than 
untreated areas within low severity was not upheld, so it is not surprising that the subsequent 
predictions about the effects of a more open structure were also generally not upheld. 
However, although not significantly different, trends in mean tree density, basal area, and 
canopy openness did indicate a more open structure. In turn, mean understory response was 
more abundant as expected, similar to what has been reported in previous studies (Moore and 
Deiter, 1992; Moore et al., 2006). 
Finally, although also not significant, the higher frequency of pine regeneration in low 
severity treated areas versus low severity untreated areas may be important for concerns about 
seedling recruitment in post-settlement forests. In addition to reducing forest fire risk, thinning 
and burning treatments are also applied to promote recruitment of the next cohort of the 
shade-intolerant ponderosa pine. We detected no significant differences in relative frequency of 
regeneration in the 41-137 cm height class (“established” seedlings). However, when both 
classes were combined, the mean relative frequency was higher in treated areas, where every 

69 
 
site had regeneration on at least one plot. In contrast, four of the six untreated low severity sites 
completely lacked ponderosa pine regeneration.  
The pine regeneration densities we detected are difficult to compare directly to other 
studies due to differences in the definition of seedling size and so we report them along with 
their seedling definitions. Studies on the 2000 Jasper Fire in the Black Hills observed ponderosa 
pine regeneration densities up to 2,000 seedlings ha-1 five years post-fire (Keyser et al., 2008), 
and 612 seedlings ha-1 three years post-fire (Lentile et al., 2005) in low severity burned areas. 
Both studies defined seedlings as <1.4 m tall, which is most similar to our definition. In the 
Southwest, Puhlick et al. (2012) observed 536-14,184 seedlings ha-1, but defined seedlings as 
≥20 cm in height and < 2.54 cm DBH, considerably larger than our upper limit. Bailey and 
Covington (2002) examined regeneration in thinned as well as in thinned and burned stands and 
found much lower rates of regeneration, from 18-60 seedlings ha-1 in two study areas. These 
numbers are considerably lower than we observed, despite their more inclusive definition (≥ 20 
cm in height, ≤ 5 cm DBH). In contrast to these studies, we detected an average of 96 seedlings 
ha-1 in untreated low severity areas and 288 seedlings ha-1 in treated low severity areas, for both 
classes combined. Although these numbers are higher than Bailey and Covington’s (2002), they 
are much lower than other studies included here. However, a historical ecology study by Mast et 
al. (1999) near Flagstaff, AZ determined that ponderosa pine trees recruited into the overstory 
at a rate of 0.4-3.6 trees ha-1, per decade under the pre-European fire regime. Although 
significant mortality is likely, our seedling densities may be adequate to provide for future 
recruitment into the overstory in the treated areas (Mast et al., 1999). 
Hypothesis 3: Treatment Effects in High Severity Areas 
Our hypothesis that treated high severity areas would have more low and moderate 
severity in proximity of our sampling sites was upheld. Our related hypothesis that this would 

70 
 
result in lower overall plant cover, and higher plant species richness and relative frequency of 
pine regeneration, was also predominantly upheld. There was significantly lower total cover and 
higher relative frequency of pine regeneration in treated areas, and the remaining variable 
mean responses were as predicted (although not significant). On the basis of relative frequency 
of pine regeneration, which likely best reflects broader landscape patterns, our data indicate 
that untreated areas are more likely to remain shrub-dominated, whereas treated areas have a 
better chance of recruitment back to pine-dominated forest.  
Relative frequency is a good reflection of pine regeneration across the landscape, but 
density estimates may provide insights on localized patterns. Specifically, two of the treated 
sites had relatively high pine seedling densities, which may indicate a trajectory towards dog-
hair thickets. The densities at these sites (>2000 seedlings ha-1) greatly exceed the ~809 
seedlings ha-1 Pearson (1950) recommended to fully re-stock clearcut areas. These numbers are 
well beyond those required for current goals of uneven-aged stands with historical structures 
(although we note that Pearson does not specify size class in this recommendation). Similarly 
high densities have also been reported in two longer-term investigations. Savage and Mast 
(2005) examined ten high severity fires 24-53 years post-fire and found exceptionally dense 
ponderosa pine stands in four sites. In order to directly compare our data with Savage and 
Mast’s (2005), which is reported by adult, sapling and seedling densities, we summed these 
three categories for a total of 1,597 to 7,912 stems ha-1 (however, two of these sites had minor 
tree planting post-fire). Finally, Haire and McGarigal (2010) also reported relatively high 
densities on two fires that burned 28 and 45 years prior: 8,000 and 2,000 ha-1, respectively. They 
defined pine regeneration was defined via quantification of tree ages and included any trees 
that established in the post-fire years (Haire and McGarigal, 2010). These studies suggest that 

71 
 
without management intervention, our high-density high severity treated sites are likely to 
remain dense doghair thickets, and therefore at risk of high severity re-burning in the future. 
Both the frequency and density measures of seedlings on untreated high severity sites 
indicate a high likelihood of conversion to shrublands. In the larger 41-137 cm size class, only 
two of six sites had any ponderosa pine regeneration. For both sizes combined, regeneration 
occurred on three of six sites, averaging 446 seedlings ha-1 for both size classes (14 of which 
were in the 0-40 cm class). Two of the three sites had densities < 250 seedlings ha-1. Since these 
areas are devoid of overstory trees, these numbers may be too low to regenerate a forested 
landscape in the near future. This number is slightly higher than those reported in several other 
studies in the ponderosa pine type. On the La Mesa Fire in northern New Mexico, Foxx (1994) 
reported roughly 81-121 seedlings ha-1; whereas in high severity areas of the 2000 Jasper Fire in 
the Black Hills, no seedlings were detected in severely burned areas in either year five post-fire 
(Keyser et al., 2008) or year three post-fire (Lentile et al., 2005).  
We attribute the low relative frequency and density of pine recruitment in our high 
severity untreated sites in part to distance to seed source and early site-capture by shrubs and 
sprouting species. Other studies in ponderosa pine have shown decreased recruitment with 
increasing distance from unburned, or lightly burned, edge (Bonnet et al., 2005; Lentile et al., 
2005; Haire and McGarigal, 2008, 2010). Like other studies of high severity fire in ponderosa 
pine, we observed lower rates of recruitment in areas farther from lesser-burned edges (in our 
study, the proxy for this was the low and moderate severity areas that were less prevalent 
around the untreated sites). By increasing high severity patch size, these recent “mega-fires” are 
increasing the distance to edge/seed source, which may impact future forest regeneration, 
particularly given predictions of warmer and drier conditions in the future (Seager et al., 2007). 

72 
 
However, it is important to note that patterns of both burning and regeneration are 
complex processes that are not entirely predictable, and all high severity patches may not face 
the same limitations. Several studies in historically frequent-fire systems have noted the 
difficulties in modeling post-fire long-distance seed dispersal, which may be important for long-
term recruitment patterns by minimizing distance to seed source in the interior of high severity 
patches (Bonnet et al., 2005; Haire and McGarigal, 2010). Similarly, some overstory trees 
occasionally survive within a high severity patch, which may act to reduce the effective patch 
size in terms of distance to seed source. 
In addition to recruitment limitations due to distance to seed source, site capture by 
shrubs or grasses may inhibit future regeneration. Several studies have linked increased shrub 
cover to decreased pine regeneration (Strom and Fulé, 2007; Haire and McGarigal, 2008, 2010). 
We observed significantly higher total plant canopy cover on untreated high severity sites, 
where regeneration was lower. Means by life form suggest this is primarily driven by trees, 
shrubs and graminoids. We note that we used the same protocols to define “tree” species as the 
initial study but observed that much of the cover of “trees” under breast height is from 
sprouting species that are considered trees as adults but have a shrub-like habit during early 
growth stages (such as Quercus gambelii Nutt. (Gambel oak), Juniperus deppeana Steud. 
(alligator juniper) and Robinia neomexicana A. Gray (New Mexico locust)). These values then 
may be more complementary than distinct from the shrub cover values. Additionally, trees 
above breast height were not measured in the cover quadrats because they were intended to be 
sampled in the variable radius prism plots. However, these plots often will not include the 
extremely small diameter leaders of these young trees that are growing into the overstory. In 
that sense, our measurements may have underestimated the strength of this early site capture 
by sprouting species on our sites. 

73 
 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
Not only did we detect important, persistent differences in vegetation response by 
severity, we also found important differences by pre-fire treatment within severity class. This 
demonstrates that landscapes that burned under a given severity class are not necessarily alike. 
As such, managing post-fire landscapes under the assumptions that all low or high severity areas 
are the same may ignore important differences in plant communities, exotic response and 
future trajectories. 
Given the likelihood of more intense and severe fires in the future, concerns about 
exotic species invasions and future reforestation are mounting. Our data fit into a body of 
literature that does not indicate a straightforward or easily predictable pattern of exotic 
response, suggesting more intensive investigations are needed. Where existing plots burn over 
on public lands, managers and scientists should make re-measurements a priority in order to 
better understand how pre-fire species assemblages interact with severity and management 
treatments to influence post-fire plant communities and exotic response.  
Re-measurements into the future, beyond the first few years post-fire, will be necessary 
to better understand future successional trajectories. Although future forest regeneration is not 
always predictable, our data are supported by other studies that show treatments such as 
thinning and burning are important to the persistence of ponderosa pine forests for two 
reasons. First, these treatments generally reduce fire severity and therefore retain the 
foundation tree species post-fire. Second, even where burning conditions permit high severity 
fire in treated areas, patch size is likely to be small, which may significantly impact post-fire 
trajectories through increased rates of pine regeneration.

CHAPTER 4 
Management Implications  
 
 
Changes in vegetation structure and composition as a result of the 2002 Rodeo-Chediski 
Fire offer strong support for fuels reduction treatments in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. & 
C. Lawson) forests of the Southwest. The post-fire effects of these treatments have important 
management implications at a number of scales. At the broadest scale, pre-fire treatments 
generally reduced fire severity, whereas untreated areas more often burned under high severity 
crown fire (Strom, 2005; Strom and Fulé, 2007). The preceding chapters documented how lower 
severity areas maintained overstory structure and mature ponderosa pine dominance. Severely 
burned areas generally lack overstory structure and many are shrub-dominated, some of which 
may remain persistent shrublands (Savage and Mast, 2005). This is significant because the loss 
of ponderosa pine as a foundation species in these areas may have significant cascading effects 
on other trophic levels (Ellison et al., 2005). Furthermore, a few high severity areas have the 
potential to become doghair thickets of high density pine. These forests are at risk of another 
episode of high severity fire, thus perpetuating the cycle and potentially altering fire regimes. 
 
High severity areas may also be an avenue for exotic species invasions, yet patterns of 
invasion in the Southwest have been highly variable. We observed significantly higher cover of 
exotic forbs in high severity areas compared to low severity burned areas on the White 
Mountain Apache Tribal (WMAT) land in 2010, whereas no difference was detected between 
high and low severity areas for 2004 or 2005. Although exotic cover was <3% for all years, this 
trend through time suggests that these species are maintaining a greater presence in the highly 
disturbed, high severity areas where there is generally more sunlight and potentially reduced 
competition from overstory trees for resources. On the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest 

91 
 
(ASNF), mean exotic forb cover was also quite low for all years, at < 2.5%, but generally higher in 
untreated areas than in treated areas, and this difference approached significance. In addition, 
although overall exotic forb cover did not change dramatically in either study over time, there 
was an increase in the presence of several species across sampling plots. Tragopogon dubius 
Scop. (yellow salsify) increased in frequency by plot over the three measurement years in both 
study areas. Verbascum thapsus (common mullein) also increased in frequency on WMAT lands.  
Overall exotic graminoid cover was highly variable in both study areas, and through 
time. Two species increased in either frequency or cover and may be cause for concern in the 
future. Eragrostis curvula (Shrad.) Nees (weeping lovegrass) increased in cover on WMAT lands 
in low severity areas. On ASNF lands, it first appeared on 18 of 80 measured plots in 2011. This 
grass is a robust perennial species that responds positively to fire (McFarland and Mitchell, 
2000). In addition, the highly rhizomatous smooth brome (Bromus inermis Leyss.) increased in 
frequency on the ASNF in 2011. These two species are among the suite of cool-season 
graminoids that have been seeded in past decades in the Southwest (Wolfson and Sieg, In prep). 
Therefore, in areas where the goal is to maintain native species composition, we recommend 
using native seed only. However, any seeding has the potential to introduce exotic species as 
seed contaminants, and should be applied with caution (Keeley, 2006; Fowler et al., 2008; 
Peppin et al., 2010). In addition, these increases in exotic forb and graminoid frequency and 
cover over time suggest that long-term monitoring of high severity fire areas is important, 
particularly in order to track potentially problematic species.  
 
Overall, the vegetative communities of more severely burned areas were relatively 
distinct from low severity areas. Yet, composition of understory herbaceous plant communities 
on the treated ASNF sites, which generally burned more severely than untreated sites, was 
converging with composition on untreated areas nine years post-fire. This convergence is likely 

92 
 
related to the proximity of the paired treated and untreated sites, such that the untreated, 
higher severity areas were never far from a lesser-burned edge. This suggests that treatments 
which minimize high severity patch size, and therefore distance to lesser-burned edge, may also 
minimize overall vegetation differences between severely burned and less severely burned 
areas. Therefore, conducting strategic treatments may be particularly important when 
treatment across an entire landscape is not feasible (Finney et al., 2007).  
 
These considerations relate to the broad scale effects of fire severity, which is generally 
mitigated by pre-fire treatment. The WMAT study design offers an exceptional opportunity to 
examine finer scale effects of treatment within severity class. Since weather conditions, 
topography and time of day also affect how severely areas burn, occasionally treated areas may 
burn severely. Ponderosa pine regeneration was less frequent in high severity areas that had not 
been treated before the wildfire than in the high severity pre-fire treated sites. In addition, pre-
fire untreated sites had higher total plant cover and higher shrub cover. Lower frequency of pine 
regeneration in severely burned untreated areas was likely linked to the neighborhood severity 
surrounding the sampling sites, where untreated sites were surrounded by significantly greater 
area that burned severely than treated sites. Even within high severity fire areas, pre-fire 
treatments mitigated the effects of high severity fire by mitigating high severity patch size and 
increasing heterogeneity in the neighborhood of these sites. Ultimately, the untreated sites, 
which were generally in larger patches of high severity, are more likely to remain persistent 
shrublands. These areas, therefore, may be priorities for tree planting if the ultimate goal is to 
re-forest these areas.  
Finally, post-fire seeding may have impacted native plant communities at both the 
broader scale of fire severity and the finer scale of treatment effects within severity class. Seed 
mixes were applied only in high severity fire areas on the WMAT lands, but throughout the ASNF 

93 
 
lands. Two exotic annual grass species, Triticum aestivum L. (common wheat) (seeded on the 
WMAT) and Lolium perenne L. (annual rye) (seeded on the A-S) were infrequent by 2005 and 
absent by 2010 and 2011. The exotic perennial grass Festuca ovina L. (sheep fescue) was also 
seeded on the ASNF, but was not detected until 2011, and then on only two plots. The 
remaining seeded species were native to the region, making it difficult to attribute their 
presence to either post-fire seeding or natural assembly. Further, we do not have any data from 
unseeded areas to assess how and if the early presence of these seeded species impacted the 
native plant communities in the long run. In light of this, the fact that the seeded annual cereal 
grains did exit the system as intended should not be simplistically interpreted as a success story; 
instead other studies that better evaluate the differences between seeded and non-seeded 
areas should be relied on for guidance (Stella et al. 2010; Peppin et al., 2010). 
Climate change has been linked with increases in high severity fire, and these fires are 
likely to continue to increase in the ponderosa pine type under the warmer and drier climate 
predicted for the Southwest (Westerling et al., 2006; Seager et al., 2007). In order to avoid the 
problematic outcomes examined in the last two chapters, such as exotic species proliferation or 
potential vegetation type conversions, management actions that reduce the incidence and 
extent of high severity crown fire and increase forest resilience will best protect native plant 
communities and vegetation types, on both broader and finer scales. Although restoring 
historical stand structures is one important way of creating more resilient ponderosa pine 
ecosystems, given the variability of the landscapes in the Southwest and the changing climate, a 
certain amount of flexibility may improve future successes. Adaptive management that 
incorporates a wide range of approaches to creating resilience can give managers a valuable 
toolbox for managing forests into the future (Millar et al., 2007; Baron et al., 2009).
