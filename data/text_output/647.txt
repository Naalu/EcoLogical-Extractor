Introduction
Southwestern ponderosa pine forests support a wide
diversity of understory vegetation, including grasses, forbs,
shrubs, and cacti.  Plant identification is important in moni-
toring following a disturbance event or in conducting ecolog-
ical restoration.  The purpose of this photographic guide is
to assist ecologists and land managers in seedling identifica-
tion and restoration monitoring.  
Methods
I performed surveys with botanists employed with the
Ecological Restoration Institute (ERI) in order to determine
the range of species common to the greater Flagstaff area to
include in the field guide.  I then obtained seeds for the
selected species from botanists employed with the ERI and
from seed outlets in the Flagstaff area.  I performed the nec-
essary pre-germination treatments for each species, then
germinated the seeds by placing them on wet filter paper in
petri dishes.  I also germinated seeds by planting them in
potting soil in seed flats.  I manually watered the petri dish-
es and kept the seed flats in a Northern Arizona University
greenhouse where they were watered by a timed sprinkler
system.  When the seedlings began to grow, I photographi-
cally documented  each species, focusing on distinctive char-
acteristics.  I photographed the species with a Leica micro-
scope fitted with an Optronics MagnaFire Sp camera, Model
S99805, located in the ERI ecology lab.  I also measured
characteristics of each species, such as stem size and leaf
size, and pressed samples of each stage. 
The guide is organized in three sections--grasses,
forbs, and shrubs.  Each section is organized alphabetically
by species.  Two photographs of each plant species accompa-
ny descriptions of the species at different developmental
stages (Note: certain species only have one photograph due
to complications in the growing process).  
This is the 1st edition of this guide, and will hopefully
serve as a template for further editions.

Glossary
Awn- A needle-like extension of the grass floret.
Bract- A modified leaf at the base of a flower or flower clus-
ter. It may resemble a normal leaf, be reduced and scale-like
in appearance, or large and brilliantly colored.
Ciliate- Fringed with hairs on the edge.
Cotyledon- The first leaf, pair or whorl of leaves to show
after germinating; a seed leaf.
Culm- The jointed stalk or stem of grasses, usually hollow
except at the nodes.
Floret- A small flower, usually one of a dense cluster.
Glume- The bracteal covering of the flowers or seeds of
grain and grasses.
Ligule- The projecting, usually tongue-like, membranous
end of the lining of the leaf sheath, seen at the base of the
leaf, between it and the stalk.
Node- Points on a stem from which leaves, shoots, or flow-
ers grow.
Petiole- The stalk of a leaf.
Pubescent- Fuzzy, covered with down or hairs.
Sessile- Leaves and other plant parts that have no stalk, but
instead grow directly from the stem of the plant.
Simple leaf- This is a leaf that consists of a single blade,
unlike a compound leaf, which has two or more. 
Ternate- Arranged in three's; especially said of a leaf with
three leaflets, or of leaves whorled in three's.
