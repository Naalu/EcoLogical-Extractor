Abstract
Question: How are the effects of mineral soil properties on 
understory plant species richness propagated through a network 
of processes involving the forest overstory, soil organic matter, 
soil nitrogen, and understory plant abundance?
Location: North-central Arizona, USA.
Methods: We sampled 75 0.05-ha plots across a broad soil gra-
dient in a Pinus ponderosa (ponderosa pine) forest ecosystem. 
We evaluated multivariate models of plant species richness 
using structural equation modeling.
Results: Richness was highest at intermediate levels of un-
derstory plant cover, suggesting that both colonization success 
and competitive exclusion can limit richness in this system. 
We did not detect a reciprocal positive effect of richness on 
plant cover. Richness was strongly related to soil nitrogen in 
the model, with evidence for both a direct negative effect and 
an indirect non-linear relationship mediated through understory 
plant cover. Soil organic matter appeared to have a positive 
inﬂuence on understory richness that was independent of soil 
nitrogen. Richness was lowest where the forest overstory was 
densest, which can be explained through indirect effects on 
soil organic matter, soil nitrogen and understory cover. Finally, 
model results suggest a variety of direct and indirect processes 
whereby mineral soil properties can inﬂuence richness.
Conclusions: Understory plant species richness and plant cover 
in P. ponderosa forests appear to be signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by 
soil organic matter and nitrogen, which are, in turn, related to 
overstory density and composition and mineral soil properties. 
Thus, soil properties can impose direct and indirect constraints 
on local species diversity in ponderosa pine forests.

Introduction
 
The dominant theories that seek to explain patterns 
of species diversity often focus on one or two important 
factors such as productivity and disturbance (e.g., Grime 
1979; Huston 1979, 1994; Tilman 1982; Rosenzweig 
1995). However, ecological systems are too complex for 
these elegant, yet simple, models to always have predic-
tive power since diversity is likely under multivariate 
control (Grace 1999; Weiher 2003). Indeed, the generality 
of the relationships between diversity and disturbance and 
between diversity and productivity has been called into 
question by reviews, meta-analyses (Gross et al. 2000; 
Mackey & Currie 2001; Mittelbach et al. 2001), and a 
modeling study (Cordonnier et al. 2006). Other factors, 
such as abiotic gradients, species pools, and spatial het-
erogeneity have been proposed as factors that regulate 
plant diversity patterns across landscapes (see reviews 
in Grace (1999) and Keddy (2005)). Recent efforts to 
understand diversity have begun to incorporate a variety 
of factors in multivariate models (Grace and Pugesek 
1997; Grace & Jutila 1999; Gough & Grace 1999; Grace 
et al. 2000; Weiher 2003; Weiher et al. 2004; Laughlin 
& Grace 2006).
 
Grace & Pugesek (1997), for example, have pro-
posed a multivariate model of plant species richness 
that incorporates several interacting factors, including 
community biomass, disturbance history, and abiotic 
environmental conditions. Richness is often, but not 
always, highest at intermediate levels of biomass (Grime 
1979; Keddy 2005) and disturbance (Connell 1978), 
and can be regulated by spatially heterogeneous soil 
resources (Tilman 1982; Grace et al. 2000). In addi-
tion, several experiments have suggested that richness 
positively affects primary production (e.g., Tilman et 
al. 2001; Spehn et al. 2005). Thus, the debate about di-
versity-productivity relationships suggests that richness 
and production may be reciprocally related. Structural 
equation modeling (SEM) permits the simultaneous 
statistical evaluation of these many plausible relation-

230

ships, including reciprocal relationships (e.g., Weiher et 
al. 2004; Kline 2005; Laughlin & Grace 2006). Grace & 
Pugesekʼs (1997) model, which was originally developed 
in herbaceous communities, was recently expanded to 
include overstory trees as factors controlling understory 
plant communities (Weiher 2003; Weiher et al. 2004; 
Laughlin & Grace 2006). These new models for forested 
systems illustrate the importance of overstory structure 
in explaining diversity patterns across landscapes.
 
In this study, we consider how mineral soil properties 
can interact with forest structure and organic soil proper-
ties to inﬂuence understory plant abundance and richness. 
We used SEM to evaluate the a priori statistical model 
(Fig. 1). Our primary purpose was to gain insight into the 
relative importance of various processes that may inﬂu-
ence understory richness by partitioning covariances 
among variables into pathways. In this model (Fig. 1), 
soil organic matter and total soil nitrogen are presumed 
to be inﬂuenced by both mineral soil conditions and for-
est density and composition (Harradine & Jenny 1958; 
Ovington 1968; Welch & Klemmedson 1975; Kaye & 
Hart 1998; Abella & Covington 2006). Consistent with 
previous models (e.g., Weiher et al. 2004), we hypoth-
esized that mineral soil components and forest overstory 
are capable of inﬂuencing understory conditions (e.g., plant 
cover and litter) as well as understory species richness.
 
Structural equation modeling analyses range from 
conﬁrmatory to exploratory. This particular analysis was 
exploratory in nature since the effects of soil properties 
on understory plant communities in western US pine 
forests have been little studied. Hence, each pathway in 
Fig. 1 represents an individual question that we sought 
to answer by evaluating how well the proposed model 
ﬁts the data. Speciﬁcally, we asked:
 
1. Does richness increase monotonically with increas-
ing understory plant cover or is there a point above which 
richness declines, indicating competitive regulation at 
high levels of cover (Grime 1979)?
 
2. Is cover greatest where richness is highest (Tilman 
et al. 2001; Spehn et al. 2005)?
 
3. Do deep litter layers beneath dense Pinus ponde-
rosa var. scopulorum stands depress richness (Laughlin 
et al. 2004)?
 
4. Is richness lower in soils having high concentra-
tions of soil nitrogen, as often observed (e.g., Tilman 
1987; Foster &Gross 1998; Collins et al. 1998; Seastedt 
& Vaccaro 2001)? Can such an effect be explained by 
high levels of understory cover or is there evidence for 
an inﬂuence of nitrogen on richness that is independent 
of cover (Gough & Grace 1999)?
 
5. Can the association between organic matter and 
richness be explained by relations with nitrogen, or does 
it have independent effects?
 
6. How does overstory composition and density relate 
to soil organic matter and nitrogen? Do forests contain-
ing Populus tremuloides (quaking aspen) trees have 
higher levels of soil organic matter and nitrogen than 
those dominated primarily by pine (Daubenmire 1953; 
Reich et al. 2001), and do such stands have elevated rich-
ness (Langenheim 1962; Fonda & Bliss 1969; Despain 
1973)?
 
7. To what degree does understory richness change 
with variations in mineral soil properties (Grace et al. 
2000; Weiher 2003; Weiher et al. 2004)?
Methods
Study system
 
The Pinus ponderosa forest ecosystem covers mil-
lions of hectares of land across uplands in the southwest-
ern United States. Our study was conducted within a 110 
000 ha landscape on the Northern Arizona University 
Centennial Forest and on the Coconino National Forest 
at elevations from 1920 to 2660 m. P. ponderosa (ʻpineʼ) 
is the dominant tree species and forms extensive pure 
stands, but sometimes occurs with Populus tremuloides 
(quaking aspen, ʻaspenʼ) or Quercus gambelii. Annual 
precipitation ranges spatially throughout the study area 
from 42-56 cm/year, snowfall from 152-233 cm/year, 
and mean maximum daily temperatures from 15.7-
17.5 °C (Western Regional Climate Center, Reno, NV, 
USA). Topography is primarily ﬂat or undulating (slope 
gradients < 10%), occasionally punctuated by cinder 
cones, ravines, and low hills. Volcanic activity has been 
widespread, with the most recent eruptions occurring ca. 
Fig. 1. A priori structural equation model. Model structure is 
based on earlier work in grasslands (Grace & Pugesek 1997; 
Weiher et al. 2004), savannas (Weiher 2003) and pine forests 
(Laughlin & Grace 2006).  Each arrow drawn from the ʻmineral 
soil propertiesʼ construct indicates that pathways from each 
of the two variables were included in the model (e.g., the two 
paths from silt and gravel to organic matter are represented 
by a single arrow).

900 years ago in the Sunset Crater Volcanic Field in the 
northeastern part of the study area (Moore et al. 1976). 
Pine forest occurs on a wide variety of soil parent materi-
als including basalt, volcanic cinders, benmoreite, mixed 
igneous rocks, limestone, and mixed limestone/sandstone 
(Welch & Klemmedson 1975; Miller at al. 1995). Major 
soil subgroups are Typic and Udic Argiborolls, Typic and 
Mollic Eutroboralfs, Typic Ustorthents, and Vitrandic 
Ustochrepts (Miller et al. 1995). Lightning-ignited sur-
face ﬁres in pre-settlement forests on average occurred 
historically at least once every 10 years, maintaining open 
forest structure (Fulé et al. 1997; Heinlein et al. 2005). 
The study area, however, has experienced ﬁre exclu-
sion, timber harvest, and heavy livestock grazing since 
settlement, which may have inﬂuenced contemporary 
understory structure (Covington & Moore 1994). 
Data collection
 
We used a digital Terrestrial Ecosystem Survey (TES) 
map (Miller et al. 1995) in a GIS to randomly select 
mapping units for sampling in each of 11 TES types (out 
of about 40 total types within our targeted elevational 
belt on the Coconino National Forest) that encompass a 
range of soil types in ponderosa pine forests (Abella & 
Covington 2006). We sampled 0.05 ha (20 m × 25 m) 
plots that were randomly located within each mapping 
unit. At least six plots were sampled in separate mapping 
units within each TES type, but we were able to sample 
three additional plots in 3 of the 11 TES types for a total 
of 75 plots.
 
Plots were sampled in May-August 2003. At each 
plot, we collected composite soil samples of 0-15 cm 
depths from two pits per plot. Soil samples were air dried, 
sieved through a 2-mm sieve, and analysed for texture 
(hydrometer method), gravel content (by weight), total N 
(with a C/N analyzer), and loss-on-ignition (LOI; heating 
5 g of each sample in a mufﬂe furnace at 300 °C for two 
hours), following methods outlined in Sparks (1996) and 
Dane & Topp (2002). We used LOI as a surrogate measure 
of soil organic matter (Schulte & Hopkins 1996).
 
We visually estimated plant cover to the nearest per-
cent in 15 1-m2 subplots per 0.05-ha plot. The average 
cover across these subplots was used as the value of plant 
cover for each plot. We also conducted a plant species 
census of the entire plot to determine understory plant 
species richness per 0.05 ha. We measured tree densities 
and diameters for all tree species over breast height. We 
used pine basal area as our measure of pine abundance. 
Aspen was present on only six of the 75 plots; therefore, 
we used aspen presence as a categorical variable, rather 
than basal area of this species, in our analyses because 
of the distributional properties of this variable.
Data analysis
 
If continuous soil properties could accurately predict 
the correct soil type from which the sample was taken, 
we felt it could be appropriate to use the continuous 
soil variables to explain patterns of richness across 
the landscape. We used stepwise discriminant analysis 
(Anon. 2005) to determine how well the continuous soil 
variables could predict the correct TES soil type (Miller 
et al. 1995). Discriminant analysis showed that continu-
ous soil properties correctly predicted the soil type 88% 
of the time. An alternative, non-parametric discriminant 
analysis test (Anon. 2005) indicated that predictions were 
correct 100% of the time. As a result of these ﬁndings, we 
felt justiﬁed in using continuous soil variables in lieu of 
soil types to represent the relationship between mineral 
soil variation and richness.
 
Prior to evaluating multivariate models, bivariate 
relations between richness and the other variables in 
the model were assessed. We examined bivariate plots 
for the presence of outliers, evidence of skewness or 
kurtosis, and for non-linear relations up to third-order 
polynomials.
Structural equation modeling
 
Structural equation modeling is an extension of 
regression and path analysis that can be used to model 
multivariate relations and to evaluate multivariate hy-
potheses (Bollen 1989). Maximum likelihood solution 
procedures were used (data distributions were sufﬁciently 
normal) and we relied on χ2 goodness of ﬁt measures to 
evaluate model adequacy. Residuals and modiﬁcation 
indices were also examined to determine if there were 
obvious model-data discrepancies, which in turn could 
be used to identify new alternative models for considera-
tion.
 
The structural equation model initially evaluated 
is shown in Fig. 1. Variables associated with various 
constructs (mineral soil properties, organic soil proper-
ties, overstory, and understory) were incorporated into 
the model. The model represents what we believed to 
be the most plausible structural relations based on a 
priori knowledge. We acknowledge that not all causal 
processes that act in this system are represented in Fig. 
1. Indeed, disturbance processes such as ﬁre and grazing 
were not included in this study. Rather, our objective was 
to determine whether the data were consistent with the 
expectations of the proposed model.
 
It should be clear that good-ﬁtting structural equation 
models do not prove causal relationships (Bollen 1989). 
Inferences about the sign and strength of directional paths 
in SEM can only be made if sound theory guides both the 
model-building and the model-ﬁtting processes (Grace 

232
Laughlin, D.C.  et al.
2006). Ultimately, our goal was to arrive at a model 
consistent with the data using the fewest modiﬁcations 
of the initial model as possible, thereby preserving the 
ability to draw inferences from model parameters. The 
ﬁnal structural equation model predicts a covariance 
structure that is consistent with the covariance structure 
of the dataset; therefore, theory can guide our interpreta-
tion of the mechanistic nature of the directional paths. 
 
Our initial model included a squared term for plant 
cover since there was an expectation of a non-linear 
relationship between cover and richness. In this model, 
the cover2 variable was allowed to freely intercorrelate 
with cover and with the predictors of cover. Since silt 
was highly negatively collinear with sand and since clay 
was not correlated with richness, we used percent silt to 
represent soil texture. Because presence of pine repre-
sents a categorical response variable, special solution 
procedures were used to model the effects of mineral 
soil properties on aspen using a probit procedure, which 
correctly estimates parameters of categorical outcomes. 
Analyses were performed using Mplus software (Muthén 
& Muthén 2005).
 
In our ﬁnal model, a composite variable was used to 
model the endogenous quadratic relationship between 
cover and richness (Grace & Bollen in press). The 
purpose of including the composite was to capture the 
combined effects of the multiple parameters used to ﬁt 
the non-linear effect. The composite modeling procedure 
used involves a two-stage approach in which models are 
ﬁrst estimated without composites to validate that the 
individual terms are statistically signiﬁcant. In the second 
stage, composites are included with zero error variance 
and with one incoming path ﬁxed to a value of 1 so as 
to set the scale for the composites. The single path from 
the composite to the response variable then represents 
the overall non-linear effect of the predictor.
 
We calculated the so-called ʻtotal effectsʼ, which are 
the total sum of direct and indirect pathways from the 
predictors to richness. Indirect effects equal the total sum 
of the products of all path segments from a predictor 
to richness. Total effects are a simple summary of the 
complex and sometimes dual nature (opposing signs) of 
the relationship between the factors and species richness. 
They also provide a calculation of the net effect (i.e., 
strength and sign) of a relationship. Estimates of these 
effects and their standard errors were calculated with 
Mplus software (Muthén & Muthén 2005).

Results
Bivariate correlations
 
Bivariate correlations between richness per 0.05 ha 
and the other variables indicated that ﬁve of eight vari-
ables had signiﬁcant (P < 0.05) relationships to richness 
(Fig. 2). Understory plant cover exhibited a quadratic 
relationship with richness, where maximum richness 
occurred at approximately 30% aerial plant cover. Lit-
ter depth was not signiﬁcantly correlated with richness. 
Soil total nitrogen was not correlated with richness, but 
soil organic matter exhibited a second-order polynomial 
relationship to richness. Presence of aspen was negatively 
correlated with richness, and abundance of pine was 
not correlated with richness. Silt exhibited a quadratic 
relationship with richness, and gravel was negatively 
correlated with richness.
 
Bivariate correlations between plant cover and the 
other variables in the model indicated that seven of the 
eight variables had signiﬁcant (P < 0.05) relationships to 
plant cover (Fig. 3). Species richness was weakly posi-
tively related to plant cover. Litter depth was negatively 
correlated with plant cover. Soil nitrogen and organic 
matter exhibited positive linear relations with plant cover. 
Aspen presence was positively correlated with plant 
cover, and pine density was negatively correlated with 
plant cover. Silt exhibited a second-order polynomial 
relationship to cover, but gravel was not correlated with 
cover.
Structural equation model
 
The results from the a priori structural equation model 
(Fig. 1) are summarized in Table 1. While the χ2 of the 
initial model was not indicative of major discrepancies 
between data and model (χ2 = 27.7, df = 17, P = 0.049), 
results suggested that seven pathways were nonessen-
tial to the model (Table 1). Litter depth did not have 
signiﬁcant relationships with either cover or richness. 
In addition, modiﬁcation indices suggested that adding 
a path from gravel to soil nitrogen might substantially 
improve model ﬁt. 
 
With non-sigiﬁcant paths eliminated and with litter 
dropped from the model, the addition of a path from 
gravel to soil nitrogen reduced the χ2 by 5.68 units, 
indicating a signiﬁcant improvement in model ﬁt (the 
criterion for a signiﬁcant change in model χ2 for a single 
change = 3.84). However, the standardized path coef-
ﬁcient (0.14) was rather weak. Theoretical justiﬁcation 
for including this path is not well developed, so we added 
this pathway provisionally. This relationship is in need of 
further substantiation in future multivariate analyses.
 
Examination of the revised model revealed that the 
path from silt to aspen was not stable (did not retain its 
signiﬁcance) and also indicated the need to add a second 
pathway, this one from soil organic matter to richness. 
The inclusion of a direct pathway from organic matter 
to richness was considered for theoretical signiﬁcance 
and found to have merit. 
 
The changes made to the second model led to a stable 
model that only included essential pathways. To obtain 
the ﬁnal model used for reporting results, a composite 
variable was added to capture the effects of cover and 
cover squared on species richness. This had no effect on 
model ﬁt or on the values of the other path coefﬁcients. 
The resulting model showed good consistency with the 
data (χ2 = 15.2, df =13, P = 0.30) and explained 41% of 
the variation in richness, 48% of the variation in plant 
cover, 58% of the variation in organic matter, and 77% 
of the variation in nitrogen (Fig. 4).
 
The total, direct, and indirect ʻeffectsʼ of factors on 
richness are presented in Table 2. Understory plant cover 
had a positive (yet non-linear) total effect on richness. 
Nitrogen had strong negative total effects on richness, 
which included a strong direct negative path and indirect

non-linear paths mediated through plant cover (Fig. 4). 
Soil organic matter had a non-signiﬁcant positive total 
effect on richness because its positive direct path was 
offset by its negative indirect paths mediated through 
nitrogen (Fig. 4). Pine basal area had negative total ef-
fects on understory species richness, driven primarily by 
a negative effect on plant cover, though total effects were 
slightly offset by indirect effects mediated through soil 
organic and nitrogen content (Fig. 4). Aspen had non-
signiﬁcant total effects on richness since aspenʼs effects 
on organic matter and nitrogen were offsetting. Soil silt 
content had a positive total effect on richness, despite a 
negative indirect effect mediated through nitrogen. Soil 
gravel content had a negative effect on richness, and these 
effects were entirely indirect through its association with 
plant cover and soil nitrogen.
Discussion
Understory
 
Species richness per 0.05 ha was highest at interme-
diate levels of plant cover. The bivariate second-order

correlation between richness and plant cover (r = 0.39; 
Fig. 2) underestimated the strength of the residual quad-
ratic relationship between these two variables (standard-
ized coefﬁcient = 0.57; Fig. 4). Multivariate analyses 
that evaluate residual relationships in the presence of 
important covariates provide a more comprehensive 
and accurate result (Grace 2006). This ʻhump-backedʼ 
relationship (sensu Grime 1973, 1979) between cover 
and richness suggests that both colonization success and 
competitive exclusion can limit richness in open stands 
where pine abundance is generally low and also where 
aspen is present.
 
The results of this analysis indicate a central role of 
understory plant abundance in the regulation of richness.

non-signiﬁcant effects can be the result of offsetting effects.

Laughlin, D.C.  et al.
Thus, factors that inﬂuence understory abundance (as 
indicated by plant cover) can be seen as indirect drivers 
of richness patterns. Approximately half of the variation 
in plant cover appears to be related to positive relations 
with nitrogen, and negative relations with pine abundance 
and gravel content. This suggests that soils with greater 
nitrogen content can sustain greater understory plant 
abundance, and that soils with greater gravel content 
impede plant establishment and production independent 
of overstory densities. Consistent with earlier studies, 
sites with high pine densities are unable to sustain abun-
dant understory plant growth due to intense competitive 
effects from trees (McLaughlin 1978; Moore & Deiter 
1992; Riegel et al. 1995; Moore et al. 2006).
 
Recent studies have suggested that biodiversity may 
maintain ecosystem functions. Speciﬁcally, a few experi-
ments have suggested that species richness has a positive 
effect on plant production (e.g., Tilman et al. 2001; Spehn 
et al. 2005). Thus, we modeled the possibility that rich-
ness and cover (a surrogate measure of plant production 
in this system) could have reciprocal relations. However, 
despite a signiﬁcant positive linear bivariate relationship 
(Fig. 3), we did not detect a reciprocal positive path from 
richness to cover in the context of the model. Similar 
to Weiher et al. (2004), when the non-linear effect of 
production on richness has been accounted for, the data 
do not indicate a reciprocal positive effect of richness 
on production.
 
Litter depth did not explain unique variation in plant 
cover or species richness in the presence of pine. This 
result contrasts with a univariate analysis that suggested 
litter (i.e., duff) reduction with ﬁre might stimulate 
richness (Laughlin et al. 2004). This implies that litter 
accumulation has less of an effect on plant abundance 
than pine density at the scale of 0.05 ha. This ﬁnding 
may have implications for ecological restoration efforts 
since the reduction of pine densities through thinning 
and the consumption of litter through prescribed ﬁre are 
both common treatment prescriptions (Covington et al. 
1997). Moore et al. (2006) demonstrated that thinning-
only treatments produced equal increases in herbaceous 
production compared to thinning plus burning treatments, 
and Abella & Covington (in press) detected no increase 
in plant cover or richness after two years of pine litter 
removal. Perhaps pine basal area reduction is more im-
portant for increasing understory production and species 
richness than reducing litter depths.
Soil nitrogen and organic matter
 
Richness at the 0.05 ha scale was lower in soils with 
greater nitrogen content, as observed in studies across 
many ecosystems (Tilman 1987; Foster & Gross 1998; 
Collins et al. 1998; Seastedt & Vaccaro 2001). Soils with 
greater nitrogen content can sustain increased herbaceous 
production, which is often the proposed mechanism 
behind the non-linear relationship between productivity 
and diversity (Huston 1979; Tilman 1982). However, 
we detected an additional direct, negative association 
of nitrogen with richness (standardized coefﬁcient = 
–0.72) independent of effects on plant cover. These 
multivariate relations were also detected in structural 
equation model results from coastal wetlands (Gough 
& Grace 1999). Such a strong direct path from nitrogen 
to richness independent of cover is intriguing and it may 
represent ﬁltering effects on the species pool (Gough & 
Grace 1998, 1999; Foster & Gross 1998). Further study 
is needed, however, to ascertain why richness was de-
pressed by elevated soil nitrogen in this system.
 
Interestingly, the bivariate correlation between ni-
trogen and richness was not signiﬁcant. However, once 
the covariation among predictors was controlled in the 
context of the multivariate model, the path from nitrogen 
to richness was the strongest path. This result illustrates 
the capacity of SEM to reveal masked and suppressed 
relationships within multivariate space (Grace & Pugesek 
1998; Grace 2006). 
 
Organic matter was strongly and positively correlated 
with total nitrogen, and regressing nitrogen on organic 
matter resulted in a y-intercept that was not signiﬁcantly 
different than zero (data not shown), suggesting that most 
total nitrogen in these forest soils is derived from organic 
matter. This concurs with Welch & Klemmedsonʼs (1975) 
ﬁnding that only 2% of total nitrogen in this system was 
inorganic nitrogen. Soil organic matter also contributes 
to soil fertility by contributing other nutrients and by 
increasing both cation exchange and water holding ca-
pacity (Brady & Weil 1999). In addition to these indirect 
associations with richness, the initially hypothesized 
structural equation model was inconsistent with the data 
until we included a direct path from organic matter to 
richness. This suggests that organic matter has effects on 
richness independent of its association with nitrogen. We 
interpret its inclusion as allowing for a greater number of 
species to occur on soils richer in organic matter, while 
at the same time, for organic-rich soils to include higher 
levels of nitrogen, which can be detrimental for species 
coexistence (Bobbink et al. 1998). It would seem, in 
retrospect, that a direct pathway from organic matter 
to richness in such models should be expected in many 
circumstances based on underlying mechanisms. Soils 
with abundant organic matter might provide additional 

- Species richness and soil properties in Pinus ponderosa forests -
237
nutrients to plants besides nitrogen and might provide 
more suitable sites for successful establishment than do 
soils with low organic matter.
Overstory
 
The effects of aspen and pine trees on understory spe-
cies richness were entirely indirect within the context of 
the model (Table 2), which is consistent with the results 
found by Laughlin & Grace (2006). This implies that 
the effects of the overstory on understory richness in 
ponderosa pine forests can be explained by the mediating 
inﬂuences on soils and understory cover.
 
The presence of aspen in the overstory has complex 
implications for understory structure. Many studies 
have suggested a positive relationship between aspen 
abundance and understory production and species rich-
ness (Langenheim 1962; Fonda & Bliss 1969; Despain 
1973; Reich et al. 2001), likely due to higher litter quality 
(Daubenmire 1953) and greater litterfall nitrogen (Reich 
et al. 2001) in aspen stands compared to conifer stands. 
Recently, understory species richness at scales > 1 m2 
has been reported to be generally moderate to low in the 
presence of aspen in northern Arizona forests (Fisher & 
Fulé 2004; Abella & Covington 2006; Laughlin et al. 
2005). Our model suggests that if such a general result 
holds, it may be the ability of aspen to increase soil nitro-
gen that causes a reduction in understory richness. Such 
a mechanism is supported by the results from a study 
in boreal forests that determined that aspen forests had 
greater litter nitrogen concentrations and total litter ni-
trogen than conifer forests (Reich et al. 2001). However, 
these negative indirect inﬂuences are partially offset by 
the greater abundance of organic matter in aspen stands 
(Table 2).
 
Dense pine forests contain fewer understory species 
than open pine forests (Laughlin et al. 2005; Laughlin & 
Grace 2006). In this case, model results imply that pine 
densities indirectly reduce richness by reducing under-
story plant cover, but that these inﬂuences are partially 
offset by the lower levels of organic matter and nitrogen 
found in dense pine stands.
Mineral soil properties
 
In this study, sampling was conducted across a broad 
range of soil conditions. Sites included in the sample rep-
resent inﬂuences from both recent and ancient volcanic 
activity as well as from weathering of sedimentary ma-
terials. Soil texture (silt content, speciﬁcally) and gravel 
content were found to be the mineral soil properties most 
associated with variations in the other system properties 
examined. The results suggest a variety of mechanisms 
whereby mineral soil properties can inﬂuence richness 
in this system. These mechanisms involve the forest 
overstory and the effects it has on soils and understory 
plant abundance. However, we found that the overstory 
was only weakly related to mineral soil properties, con-
sistent with the notion that Pinus ponderosa and Populus 
tremuloides have broad soil tolerances.
 
Model results suggest that high gravel content is asso-
ciated with low species richness (Table 2). Gravel might 
inhibit herbaceous plant growth by reducing establish-
ment sites and by altering soil moisture availability and 
drainage properties. We observed low species richness 
on black cinder soils that contained high gravel content 
and high species richness on other soils that contained 
lower gravel content (Abella & Covington 2006).
 
The results of our analyses suggest that mineral soil 
properties can have speciﬁc inﬂuences on understory 
richness in this system. While siltier soils have a higher 
density of pine, higher organic matter, higher nitrogen, 
and support greater understory cover, we found evidence 
of a speciﬁc enhancement of richness by silt independ-
ent from the inﬂuences of other variables. Inﬂuences of 
gravel on richness, in contrast, can be explained by its 
association with lower understory cover. These results, 
and in particular speciﬁc effects of soil properties on rich-
ness, are consistent with previous studies in grasslands 
(Grace & Jutila 1999; Grace et al. 2000). Grace (2001) 
suggested that such speciﬁc effects represent a ﬁltering 
of the species pool by abiotic inﬂuences, which is why 
they operate independently from associations with plant 
abundance. The overall importance of abiotic conditions 
as ﬁlters of richness patterns has received increasing 
support in multivariate studies, and additional support 
for this idea can be found in our results for ponderosa 
pine ecosystems.
Conclusions
 
This study demonstrates how traditional univariate 
analyses can sometimes be misleading when studying 
complex natural systems (Grace 2006). The incorporation 
of covariates into an analysis strengthens the validity of 
the results, especially when factors are not experimen-
tally controlled (Weins & Parker 1995). The bivariate 
correlations examined in this study suggested that a 
few variables were only weakly or not correlated with 
richness. However, if we limited the analysis to bivariate 
relationships, we would have erroneously concluded 
that nitrogen had no effect on richness, contrary to 
many experiments and diversity theories (e.g. Bobbink 
et al. 1998; Tilman 1982). This SEM analysis revealed a 
strongly negative residual relationship between richness 
and nitrogen. In addition, the SEM analysis showed a 
stronger non-linear relationship between richness and 

238
Laughlin, D.C.  et al.
plant cover than was suggested by bivariate plots. Further, 
ponderosa pine exhibited no bivariate relationship to 
richness, yet pine was found to be indirectly negatively 
related to richness in the context of the model.
 
The southwestern ponderosa pine forest ecosystem 
occurs across a wide breadth of soil variation, and our 
results suggest that soil properties can impose direct 
and indirect constraints on local species diversity. These 
constraints should be considered when setting targets for 
understory plant abundance and diversity in restoration 
and management projects. Other multivariate studies in 
the ponderosa pine system (e.g., Laughlin & Grace 2006) 
have suggested that disturbance factors, such as ﬁre, have 
strong effects on species richness. Future studies should 
consider abiotic and disturbance effects simultaneously 
to determine the relative importance of each in regulat-
ing richness patterns. In all cases examined thus far, 
understory richness is under multivariate control with 
overstory and understory abundance having predictable 
roles mediating the inﬂuences of disturbance history and 
abiotic environmental conditions.
