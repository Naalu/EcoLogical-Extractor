Abstract 
Background:  Forest and nonforest ecosystems of the western United States are experiencing major transformations 
in response to land-use change, climate warming, and their interactive effects with wildland fire. Some ecosystems 
are transitioning to persistent alternative types, hereafter called “vegetation type conversion” (VTC). VTC is one of the 
most pressing management issues in the southwestern US, yet current strategies to intervene and address change 
often use trial-and-error approaches devised after the fact. To better understand how to manage VTC, we gathered 
managers, scientists, and practitioners from across the southwestern US to collect their experiences with VTC chal-
lenges, management responses, and outcomes.
Results:  Participants in two workshops provided 11 descriptive case studies and 61 examples of VTC from their own 
field observations. These experiences demonstrate the extent and complexity of ecological reorganization across the 
region. High-severity fire was the predominant driver of VTC in semi-arid coniferous forests. By a large margin, these 
forests converted to shrubland, with fewer conversions to native or non-native herbaceous communities. Chaparral 
and sagebrush areas nearly always converted to non-native grasses through interactions among land use, climate, 
and fire. Management interventions in VTC areas most often attempted to reverse changes, although we found that 
these efforts cover only a small portion of high-severity burn areas undergoing VTC. Some areas incurred long (>10 
years) observational periods prior to initiating interventions. Efforts to facilitate VTC were rare, but could cover large 
spatial areas.
Conclusions:  Our findings underscore that type conversion is a common outcome of high-severity wildland fire in 
the southwestern US. Ecosystem managers are frontline observers of these far-reaching and potentially persistent 
changes, making their experiences valuable in further developing intervention strategies and research agendas. As 
its drivers increase with climate change, VTC appears increasingly likely in many ecological contexts and may require

Introduction
When disturbances overwhelm resilience mechanisms, 
vegetative communities change in composition, struc-
ture, and trajectory (Beisner et al. 2003; Millar and Ste-
phenson 2015; Coop et al. 2020; Falk et al. 2022). If the 
new state is persistent and resilient to, or reinforced by, 
further disturbance, it can be considered a vegetative 
type conversion (VTC, Syphard et  al. 2019; van Man-
tgem et  al. 2020). Key drivers of VTC in the south-
western US are associated with climatic warming, 
land-use change, introductions of non-native species, 
and anthropogenically-altered fire regimes. Throughout 
semi-arid forests of the region, the widespread disrup-
tion of historical fire regimes in the late 19th century 
has led to increased stand densities (Covington and 
Moore 1994), increasingly large and severe fires (Miller 
et  al. 2009; Singleton et  al. 2019), and accelerating fire 
frequencies in shrub-dominated landscapes subject to 
high numbers of anthropogenic ignitions (Balch et  al. 
2017). Simultaneously, climate change facilitates VTC 
by producing “hotter droughts” that stress existing veg-
etation (Williams et al. 2013; Allen et al. 2015), increase 
management paradigms to transition as well. Approaches to VTC potentially include developing new models of 
desired conditions, the use of experimentation by managers, and broader implementation of adaptive management 
strategies. Continuing to support and develop science-manager partnerships and peer learning groups will help to 
shape our response to ongoing rapid ecological transformations.

Resumen 
Antecedentes:  Los ecosistemas boscosos y no boscosos en el oeste de los EE.UU. están experimentando grandes 
transformaciones en respuesta al cambio de uso de la tierra, el calentamiento del clima y sus efectos interactivos 
con los incendios naturales. Algunos ecosistemas están en transición hacia tipos alternativos persistentes, a partir del 
ahora denominado “conversión del tipo de vegetación” VTC, por sus siglas en inglés. VTC es uno de los temas que más 
presión ejerce en cuestiones de manejo en el sudoeste de los EEUU, aunque las estrategias actuales para intervenir y 
abordar el cambio usan frecuentemente acercamientos de prueba y error ideados después del evento. Para entender 
mejor cómo manejar el VTC, reunimos gestores, científicos y practicantes de todo el sudoeste de los EEUU para 
recolectar sus experiencias con desafíos de la VTC, respuestas de manejo, y resultados.
Resultados:  Los participantes en dos talleres proveyeron 11 casos descriptivos y 61 ejemplos de VTC de sus propios 
campos de observación. Estas experiencias demostraron la amplitud y la complejidad de la reorganización ecológica 
a través de la región. Los incendios de alta severidad fueron los conductores predominantes del VTC en bosques 
semiáridos de coníferas. Por un amplio margen, estos bosques se convirtieron en arbustales, con algunas conver-
siones a comunidades herbáceas nativas y no nativas. Áreas de chaparral y de artemisia casi siempre se convirtieron 
en pastizales no nativos a través de interacciones como el uso de la tierra, el clima y el fuego. Las intervenciones de 
manejo en áreas de VTC intentaron más frecuentemente revertir cambios, a pesar de que encontramos que estos 
esfuerzos cubrieron solamente una pequeña porción de áreas quemadas con alta severidad que experimentaron VTC. 
Algunas áreas tuvieron largos períodos de observación (>10 años), previos a iniciarse las intervenciones. Los esfuerzos 
para facilitar el VTC fueron raros, pero pudieron cubrir áreas amplias.
Conclusiones:  Nuestros resultados ponen en relieve que este tipo de conversión es una consecuencia común de 
fuegos de alta severidad en el sudoeste de los EE.UU. Los que manejan los ecosistemas son observadores de primera 
línea de estos cambios de largo alcance y potencialmente persistentes, haciendo que sus experiencias sean además 
valiosas para desarrollar estrategias de intervención y en agendas de investigación. A medida que las causas se incre-
mentan con el cambio climático, los VTC aparecen cada vez más probables en varios contextos ecológicos, y pueden 
requerir también paradigmas de manejo hacia la transición. Acercamientos al VTC incluyen potencialmente nuevos 
modelos de desarrollo con condiciones deseadas, el uso de la experimentación por parte de los gestores, y una 
amplia implementación de estrategias de manejo adaptativas. El continuo apoyo y desarrollo a las asociaciones cientí-
ficas y de gestión y de grupos de aprendizaje entre colegas ayudará a formar nuestra respuesta a las transformaciones 
ecológicas rápidas que están ocurriendo.

fire severity (Mueller et al. 2020; Parks and Abatzoglou 
2020), and limit the success of ecosystem re-establish-
ment and recovery (Keeley 1991; Keeley et al. 2019; Ste-
vens-Rumann and Morgan 2019; Davis et al. 2019). Novel 
drought effects are now emerging as a consequence of 
interactions between climate change, land-use change, 
and human-induced declines in water availability, par-
ticularly in arid environments with growing human 
populations (Crausbay et al. 2020). Acute moisture defi-
cits are increasingly recognized as a driver of ecological 
transformation that may be irreversible (Crausbay et al. 
2017; Batllori et  al. 2020). As anthropogenic climate 
change continues to amplify these trends (Nolan et  al. 
2018; Williams et al. 2020), transitions to novel ecosystem 
types can be expected to become increasingly common.
Conifer-dominated, historically frequent-fire forests in 
the southwestern US are particularly vulnerable to VTC. 
Here, we focus on Arizona, California, Colorado, and 
New Mexico, but many events and trends we discuss are 
relevant elsewhere in western North America (Hessburg 
et al. 2019). Southwestern dry-conifer forests are defined 
as those dominated by ponderosa (Pinus ponderosa) or 
Jeffrey pine (P. Jeffreyi) and often include associated spe-
cies such as Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), red fir 
(Abies magnifica), southwestern white pine (P. strobi-
formis), limber pine (P. flexelis), and white fir (A. con-
color). Over the last century or more, these forests have 
undergone significant changes in structure and function, 
mainly due to the lack of recurrent fire activity (Allen 
et al. 2002; Hagmann et al. 2021). Throughout the region, 
loss of Native American burning practices, industrial log-
ging, livestock grazing, and active fire suppression dis-
rupted historical fire regimes (Swetnam et al. 2016). With 
climate warming, recent fires often include large areas of 
high-severity (stand-replacing) fire effects that can result 
in rapid post-fire transitions to hardwood-, shrub-, herb-, 
or grass-dominated ecosystems (Savage and Mast 2005; 
Airey Lauvaux et al. 2016; Tepley et al. 2017; Coop et al. 
2020). Post-fire recovery depends largely on the extent of 
parent tree survival, understory composition, and local- 
to micro-scale temperature and soil moisture conditions. 
Recovery is most challenged in uncharacteristically large 
high-severity burn patches that include spatially exten-
sive mortality of parent trees and potentially severe and 
long-lasting impacts to the soil (Shive et al. 2018; Safford 
and Vallejo 2019; Dove et al. 2020). In warm and semi-
arid regions, higher elevation and north-facing localities 
within a species distribution tend to be more favorable 
for post-fire recovery (Collins and Roller 2013; Korb et al. 
2019; Stevens-Rumann and Morgan 2019). Fire-catalyzed 
VTC may be most common at warm/dry ecotones or in 
areas experiencing drought events, where low moisture 
availability had already stressed or killed overstory trees 
prior to burning (Allen et  al. 2015) and subsequently 
reduced post-fire regeneration rates (Rother and Veblen 
2016; Young et al. 2019; Davis et al. 2019; Rodman et al. 
2020). However, these same ecotonal forests are often 
resilient to recurrent low-severity fire, even with climate 
warming (Harris and Taylor 2020).
Recovery following stand-replacing disturbances in 
dry conifer forests can include successional pathways 
through aspen (Populus tremuloides), hardwood, or 
shrub-dominated stages, but current climatic and fire 
regime trends are enhancing the likelihood of perma-
nent conversion and the spatial extent of hardwood and 
shrub dominance in many parts of the southwestern 
US. In portions of the Colorado Plateau and southern 
Rockies, ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forests are 
converting to shrublands of Gambel oak (Quercus gam-
belii) and New Mexico locust (Robinia neomexicana) 
(Guiterman et al. 2015, 2018; Coop et al. 2016; Rodman 
et al. 2020). In the Sky Island ecosystems of southern Ari-
zona and New Mexico, Madrean oak woodland species 
(e.g., Q. arizonica and Q. hypoleucoides) and Ceanothus 
shrubs are replacing conifers, even where a resprout-
ing pine species (P. leiophylla) is common (Minor et al. 
2017; Barton and Poulos 2018). In parts of southern 
Oregon and northern California, repeated high severity 
fires are helping to expand the colonization of knobcone 
pine (Pinus attenuata), a serotinous-cone species that is 
highly adapted to such a fire regime (Reilly et al. 2019). 
Elsewhere in California, severe fires typically induce a 
strong shrub response, often from Ceanothus or Arcto-
staphylos species, which compete intensively with conifer 
regeneration (Helms and Tappeiner 1996). Because they 
resprout, hardwoods—especially oaks—can benefit from 
conifer mortality, and their density has been generally 
increasing in California montane forests for decades due 
to interactions between forest disturbance and climate 
warming (Dolanc et al. 2014; McIntyre et al. 2015). Sub-
sequent burning tends to reinforce hardwood and shrub 
response (Coppoletta et al. 2016; Haffey et al. 2018; Key-
ser et al. 2020), especially where other factors including 
sparsity of parent trees already inhibit conifer recovery. 
Reburning at low- to mixed-severity within decades of 
the initial high-severity fire may explain centuries-long 
persistence of shrublands in which fire was historically 
frequent (Iniguez et al. 2009; Guiterman et al. 2018; Roos 
and Guiterman 2021). As these examples illustrate, there 
is no intrinsic, single time scale that can be used to define 
when a type conversion has occurred without impos-
ing an arbitrary standard. The distinction between tran-
sient and persistent reorganization depends more on the 
mechanisms at work, in particular, if the converted state 
is reinforced by altered climate or disturbance regimes 
(Falk et al. 2022).

The spread of non-native grasses and forbs (e.g., Bro-
mus spp., Avena spp., Erodium spp.) due to interactions 
among land uses, climate, and changing fire regimes is 
generating substantial change in chaparral and sagebrush 
areas. These herbaceous species can support uncharac-
teristically frequent fire relative to historical intervals, 
resulting in positive feedback with fire that is driving 
extensive VTC (Balch et  al. 2013; Syphard et  al. 2019). 
The mechanism for woody decline and conversion is the 
relatively long period of recovery required to regener-
ate post-fire. Chaparral requires 10–15 years for recov-
ery (Keeley et al. 2011; Keeley and Brennan 2012; Lippitt 
et al. 2013), while sagebrush may require several decades 
under favorable conditions (Shriver et  al. 2018). These 
lapse periods are outpaced by the spread of non-native 
species such as cheatgrass (B. tectorum) that invade 
under and throughout shrub ecosystems, increase flam-
mability, and set the stage for post-fire community reor-
ganization (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992).
Prevention of VTC is emphasized in forest and shrub-
land management in the southwestern US through meas-
ures that promote species or community resistance or 
recovery (e.g., Franklin et al. 2018). Current intervention 
strategies that include fuel reduction and repeated low-
severity fire have a strong scientific foundation (Allen 
et al. 2002; Prichard et al. 2021) and are effective (Stod-
dard et al. 2021). These strategies often accord with the 
cultural burning activities of many Indigenous groups 
across the southwestern US (Kimmerer and Lake 2001; 
Roos et  al. 2021), and, where they are conducted in 
diverse collaborations with tribes and other stakeholders, 
can have benefits to social systems that extend beyond 
ecosystem resilience (Lake et al. 2017).
Management after extensive high-severity fires is more 
challenging than prevention because we simply have not 
obtained adequate knowledge or experience. Research 
on VTC is relatively new, and we have yet to capture 
the scale of the phenomenon in space and time, includ-
ing how many areas are undergoing VTC and how many 
areas might not experience VTC despite major post-fire 
changes. Studies on both natural and managed recovery 
following fires have yet to answer how future climate and 
disturbances interact with treatments to either promote 
recovery or reorganization.
To better understand the challenge of managing ongo-
ing VTC, we held two multi-day workshops in 2019 that 
brought together managers, scientists, and practition-
ers to discuss their observations of, perspectives on, and 
experiences with VTC events (Gregg and Marshall 2020a, 
2020b). Participants voiced a need for greater clarity on 
the regional extent of VTC and responses to it, felt that 
focusing on their own management units (though many 
are quite extensive) limited their understanding of others’ 
experiences with similar challenges, and found limited 
resources in the scientific literature to help answer ques-
tions. In this paper, we address these concerns by pre-
senting the firsthand experiences of the workshop 
participants through a series of 11 case studies and a 
summary of 61 VTC examples (Fig. 1). During the work-
shops and throughout this paper, we categorized man-
agement responses to VTC as (i) Reverse change: restore 
pre-fire conditions or manage recovery such that the 
affected ecosystem is brought to a recognizable (perhaps 
pre-fire exclusion) and ideally more resilient composition 
and structure; (ii) Observe change: exercise patience and 
monitor the system and its post-disturbance trajectory; 
and (iii) Facilitate change: push the system along a new, 
potentially novel, trajectory (Table 1). We recognize that 
these responses generally align with the resist-accept-
direct (RAD) framework (Schuurman et  al. 2020) and 
chose to maintain our classifications because many of 
the VTC examples lack a specific management response, 
which may or may not constitute intentional selection of 
“accept” as the desired future condition. Below, we sum-
marize the VTC case studies and the individual exam-
ples, then synthesize these in the context of pressing 
management challenges and opportunities. The full case 
study descriptions and details regarding our approach 
are provided in the online Supplemental Information that 
accompanies this article.
Case studies
Participant-provided case studies of VTC demonstrate 
the profound complexity of ecological reorganization 
in the region. For example, the conversion of forests by 
high-severity wildfire illustrates that history and land-
use changes are important. In each case, processes that 
led to VTC started a century or more earlier with the dis-
ruption of historical fire regimes and associated changes 
to composition and structure. This slow but profound 
change set the stage for multiple disturbance agents often 
acting in conjunction to fundamentally shift the ecosys-
tem type or its dominant species. Management responses 
have been similarly diverse, reflecting individual situa-
tions, constraints, and goals. We note that in several case 
studies, more than one category of management response 
is described, representing the evolving nature of VTC 
management and its trial-and-error approach.
Reversing change
One possible management response to VTC is to actively 
attempt to reverse changes. Such responses are high-
lighted by recovery efforts on the Klamath Reservation 
in southern Oregon (case study #1) where long-term fire 
exclusion allowed tree encroachment into important

Reverse change
Actively try to reverse change via:
• Coupled thinning and prescribed fire treatments to reduce fuel loads 
and fire severity and promote fire-dependent species and ecosystem 
recovery (Stephens et al. 2009)
• Planting or seeding pre-VTC species
• Removing or managing new or undesirable species (e.g., non-native 
grasses and shrubs that may increase fire frequency and/or severity)
• Fire suppression to reduce fire extent and allow for recovery time
• Preventing post-disturbance soil loss to sustain ecological functions

2. Southern Front Range, Colorado
3. Laguna Mountain, California
Observe change
Take no active intervention measures and adopt monitoring to assess 
ecosystem trajectory over time. This approach may be most appropriate 
where there is:
• Limited management capacity (e.g., high upfront and maintenance 
costs of active intervention, limitations to access in sites such as those in 
wilderness or roadless lands) (Rother et al. 2015; Aplet and Mckinley 2017)
• High uncertainty of unintended consequences of active intervention 
(e.g., one workshop participant noted that “sometimes doing something 
is worse than doing nothing”) (Landres 2010). This approach is consistent 
with restoration paradigms emphasizing a spectrum of approaches to 
spread risk (Aplet and Mckinley 2017).

tions by:
• Planting or seeding with focus on more drought- and fire-tolerant spe-
cies compared to pre-disturbance species (e.g., assisted gene flow; Young

• Follow-up wildfires with ecologically-credible fuel reduction activities

wetland and moist forest areas, altering the hydrology of 
the ecosystem and triggering the loss of culturally-impor-
tant plants and environments. Tribal forest managers 
are working to restore forest structure and composition, 
improve wetland habitats, and recover the historical for-
est resilience and ecosystem services of the area. These 
efforts will hopefully stave off the kind of high-severity 
fires that are affecting areas of the southern Front Range 
in Colorado (#2). There, managers are achieving relatively 
high survival of planted ponderosa pine and Douglas-
fir seedlings in the footprint of the 2002 Hayman Fire, 
despite years of drought since the planting operations 
(Fig. 2A). The success to date is credited to early spring 
planting operations targeted to the most productive sites, 
often at higher elevations and on northerly slopes, and 
using coarse-woody debris or other objects for additional 
shade. On Laguna Mountain in southern California (#3), 
however, a series of droughts, fires, and bark beetles 
have slowed or stopped post-fire recovery efforts in Jef-
frey pine forests (Fig. 2B). Years of drought following the 
2003 Cedar Fire prevented any tree recruitment and all 
planting operations failed. As managers were accepting 
the conversion to shrubland and herbland with scattered 
black oak (Q. kelloggii) and Coulter pine (P. coulteri), 
the newly established non-native goldspotted oak borer 
(Agrilus auroguttatus) decimated mature oaks (Safford 
and Vallejo 2019).
Observing change
The complexity of compounding disturbances including 
fire, insects, and climate warming can incapacitate recov-
ery efforts. In many cases, observing changes is necessary 
to gauge ecological trajectories, decide whether and how 
far outside of the natural range of variation the system 
has moved (Jackson 2012), and plan future manage-
ment actions. In the eastern Jemez Mountains of New 
Mexico (#4), a series of high-severity fires culminating 
in the 2011 Las Conchas Fire left tens of thousands of 
hectares depleted of living conifers (Fig. 3A). Nearly 10 
years post-fire, a coalition of stakeholders emerged with 
diverse plans to employ a variety of actions across the 
RAD framework based on variability in post-fire environ-
ments, community needs, tribal resources, and the risks 
of floods and debris flows originating from the burned 
area. Managers at the Devils Postpile National Monument 
in California (#5) found an array of post-fire trajectories 
in the decades following a mixed-severity fire. The pre-
fire forest was recovering in lower-severity burn areas, 
but extensive shrublands were developing following com-
plete overstory mortality in high-severity patches. Simi-
lar findings come from Lassen Volcanic National Park in 
California (#6) where mixed-conifer forests were widely 
transformed into shrublands, except where earlier pre-
scribed fires reduced the intensity and severity of wildfire. 
In lodgepole pine (P. contorta) forests, low to moderate 
fire severity in 1984 generated legacy effects in a 2012 fire 
in which recent post-fire regeneration is abundant eve-
rywhere except for areas twice-burned at high-severity. 
The trajectory of these un-regenerated lodgepole pine 
forests is uncertain in light of warming temperatures, and 
may not return to pre-fire conditions. The same is true 
for subalpine forests in the San Juan Mountains of south-
ern Colorado (#7) where a severe bark beetle outbreak 
and subsequent high-severity fire resulted in high aspen

by an oak borer outbreak (credit: Hugh Safford)

reproduction in some areas and a variety of herbaceous 
vegetation in others (Fig.  3B). That these VTC events 
occur in designated wilderness areas can limit manage-
ment including fire suppression, prescribed fire, and tree 
planting. In one of the largest wildland-urban interface 
regions of the United States, the Inner Coast Range of 
California (#8), VTC has only recently emerged following 
the disruption of historical fire regimes and associated 
reduction in the spatial diversity of the grassland-wood-
land-forest mosaic. The devastating “wine country” 
wildfires in 2017 marked the return of fire to this cou-
pled human-natural ecosystem. Some areas have now 
experienced four fires in the last 5 years. Beyond losses 
to human life and property, the entire ecological mosaic 
has been affected, with major loss of chaparral communi-
ties, fundamentally changing the landscape to non-native 
grasslands and leaving human infrastructure vulnerable 
to flooding and debris flows.
Facilitating change
Facilitation of VTC is the least common management 
response documented in our study, though ideas of 
when, where, and how to direct changes are becoming 
clearer (Millar and Stephenson 2015). The facilitation

case studies we present include management actions 
that direct change knowingly but perhaps without the 
explicit intention of promoting type change. In the case 
of the North Rim of the Grand Canyon in Arizona (#9), 
fire managers successfully reintroduced fire in ponderosa 
pine forests following many decades of fire exclusion. 
However, with more recurrent fire activity, they noted 
higher-than-expected conifer mortality in surface fires, 
which is benefiting Gambel oak and slowly convert-
ing the forests to shrubby woodlands (Fig.  4A). Some 
of the small shrubland patches that are established in 
high-severity burn areas are expanding as large, downed 
fire-killed trees burn in subsequent fires with enough 
intensity to expand the shrubland gaps, sometimes merg-
ing into large patches. Frequent fire may be more in 
line with projected climate conditions but also threat-
ens large, old trees. The management goal to maintain 
fire as an ecological process (https://​www.​nps.​gov/​grca/​
learn/​manag​ement/​upload/​grca_​fmp.​pdf) is promoting 
this ecological transition. In the southern Sierra Nevada 
of California (#10), a decade of drought and recurrent 
fires is rapidly removing conifers from commercial forest 
areas where thinning has reduced relative mortality but 
progressed the transition from conifer-dominated forests 
to oak- and hardwood-dominated woodlands (Fig.  4B). 
Now, unthinned areas are vulnerable to fire due to their 
composition of dense fire-intolerant tree species and 
heavy loading of drought-killed trees, but thinned stands 
dominated by oak trees are vulnerable to the advance of 
goldspotted oak borers. Finding a balance between these 
options is challenging, so managers are utilizing new 
decision support tools to guide post-fire recovery efforts 
and the facilitation of VTC in some areas to be used as 
fuel breaks in generating a landscape mosaic. Along the

spruce-fir (Picea engelmannii and Abies lasiocarpa var. 
arizonica) forests are critical habitat for the endangered 
Mount Graham red squirrel (Tamiasciurus fremonti gra-
hamensis) (USFWS 2011) but were decimated by two 
fires in 2004 and 2016 (Merrick et  al. 2021). Managers 
recognize that re-planting a spruce-fir forest will neither 
rapidly re-establish habitat nor be resilient and produc-
tive given the changing climate. They have therefore 
opted to plant a native, but more drought- and insect-
resilient, mix of conifer species (including spruce and fir) 
that could, once mature, potentially aid in the return of 
the spruce-fir type. The key idea here is to help push the 
system in a trajectory of conifer forest, rather than shrub 
or grassland conditions.
VTC examples
In order to capture the regional scope and diversity of 
VTC, workshop participants identified sites undergo-
ing VTC on printed maps that we later geolocated in a 
geographic information system. Each workshop had a 
subregional focus (Fig. 1). The workshop in Tucson, AZ 
(March 2019) focused mainly on Arizona, New Mexico, 
and Colorado (Southwest (SW) study region). The work-
shop in Sacramento, CA (December 2019) focused on 
California and adjacent environments (CA study region). 
For each location they marked, participants described 
their observations on paper forms that included the (1) 
location of the VTC, (2) land ownership of the area, (3) 
ecosystem types before and after the VTC, (4) year of 
any precipitating event(s), (5) driving mechanism(s) of 
change, (6) species of interest in the area, and (7) man-
agement actions, if any, taken to address the VTC. We 
emphasize that these examples of VTC represent the site-
specific knowledge and expert opinion of scientists and 
practitioners who attended the workshops and are not an 
attempt to identify or quantify the true extent of regional 
VTC. The examples were summarized in the context of 
two large-scale spatially explicit data sets, Monitoring 
Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS, Eidenshink et al. 2007) 
and the US Forest Service Activity Tracking System 
(FACTS) (https://​data.​fs.​usda.​gov/​geoda​ta/​edw/​datas​ets.​
php), to describe broad patterns in the VTC observations 
(see online supplemental information for details).
Workshop participants provided 61 examples of VTC 
across six southwestern US states (Fig. 1), with 26 in the 
CA study area and 35 in the SW (each example is pro-
vided in the online Supplemental Table). The vast major-
ity (80%) of these examples related to high-severity fire 
(Fig.  5A). Drought, biotic agents, high-frequency fire, 
and land use each account for <10% of the identified 
VTC drivers. Some examples represent changes across 
vast areas that could not be accurately portrayed by our 
approach. For example, within the land-use category, only 
a single record in southern CA describes widespread fuel 
breaks in which repeated disturbances including bulldoz-
ing, prescribed fire, herbicide applications, and mastica-
tion of vegetation have converted chaparral within the 
fire lines to herbaceous dominance, predominantly non-
native grasses. Although these actions were intentional, 
they were not necessarily intended for the establishment 
of non-native vegetation.
Trajectories of VTC underscore the commonality of 
forest-to-shrubland transitions (Fig.  5B). In total, 59% 
of the examples include conversion to shrubland. In the 
SW, both ponderosa pine and dry mixed-conifer for-
ests (which often include ponderosa pine, Romme et al. 
2009), are seen to almost always transition to shrub-
lands. In CA, 54% of the examples include the shrub-
land trajectory, predominantly resulting from fire-driven 
conversions of mixed-conifer and Jeffrey pine forests. 
Grasslands dominated by mostly native herbaceous veg-
etation are the next most common post-VTC type, with 
non-native grass making up 15% of the examples, all of 
which were reported in CA. This latter group includes 
a variety of pre-VTC vegetation communities such as 
chaparral, Jeffrey pine forest, and sagebrush.
Reversing change was the most common management 
response to VTC (Fig.  5C). The second most common 
response was either no management (often written as 
“none”) or was not provided. If we could not supplement 
the participant’s entry with information from FACTS, 
we report what the participants provided, leaving 13 
examples in which a management action was not pro-
vided. There were three examples that included observ-
ing change, and one example (the fuel breaks described 
above) of facilitate change. These examples show that 
interventions to reverse change were more common in 
CA than in the SW, and by contrast, observing change 
was more common in the SW than in CA. These sub-
regional differences were notable in our analysis of the 
FACTS data (Fig. 6), in which we explored 34 examples 
of VTC that were within patches of high-severity fire, 
as recorded in MTBS. We identified 55 high-severity 
burn areas over the 34 individual sites, suggesting that 
repeated high-severity fire may have been a factor in 
some examples of VTC. FACTS data show that in CA, 
most post-fire management interventions occur within 5 
years of the fire and aim to reverse change (commercial 
tree removal, fuel reduction, and tree establishment). Lit-
tle observation of change was recorded for CA, and none 
occurred after 5 years, whereas in the SW, observation 
was more common than tree removal or fuel reduction, 
and could last as long as 20 years post-fire. The rate of 
tree establishment dwindled in CA after 15 years post-
fire, while it only increased in the SW through 20 years

post-fire. Across all of these management responses, 
however, the spatial coverage of treatments recorded 
in FACTS shows that less than 25% of individual high-
severity burn areas saw any treatment.
Synthesis
Across the breadth of ecosystems represented in our case 
studies and VTC examples, we found that forests typi-
cally convert to shrubland, and chaparral or sagebrush 
communities convert to herblands, often dominated by 
non-native grasses. The post-fire types represent transi-
tions to vegetative states that are shorter in height, better 
adapted to disturbance and drought, and, as more areas 
are affected, reduce landscape-scale diversity in ecologi-
cal structure. Our findings emphasize that altered fire 
regime characteristics, including frequency and sever-
ity, are likely to generate novel transitions. In general, 
these processes increase overstory mortality among trees 
and chaparral, which is the key trigger of a state transi-
tion, especially in larger patches (Chambers et al. 2016; 
Falk et al. 2022). Other mortality agents, such as insect 
outbreaks, often in combination with fire, further pro-
mote transitions. Recovery to the initial state is likely to 
be inhibited by a hotter and drier climate (Davis et  al. 
2019; Stewart et al. 2020). When all of these factors align, 
as they have in recent decades across most of the South-
west, VTC is the likely outcome.
Once converted, new vegetative states are highly per-
sistent. This underscores the need for management to 
consider undertaking preventive strategies that capital-
ize on the persistence mechanisms of intact vegetative 
types (Falk et al. 2022), if these are the desired long-term 
communities (see Matonis and Binkley 2018). Effec-
tive prevention strategies often include fuel reduction 
and re-introduction of recurrent low-severity fire (Stod-
dard et al. 2021), which can be accomplished in diverse 
partnerships that promote important ecocultural prod-
ucts and values along with a suite of ecosystem services 
(Hessburg et al. 2021; case study #1). Treatments are ide-
ally conducted at landscape scales, but smaller, targeted 
actions can be undertaken to promote refugia areas fol-
lowing future wildfires that would help recovery efforts 
by providing seed sources (Krawchuk et al. 2020).
While some prevention strategies are effective, they 
do not address all concerns regarding VTC. Participants 
in our workshops are frontline observers to ecological 
changes rarely witnessed until recent decades. As the 
case study descriptions echo, there is a palpable sense 
of futility when confronting the scale and uncertain eco-
logical trajectories of VTC. Indeed, in many cases, lit-
tle can be done to reverse changes wrought by multiple 
compounding disturbances and long-term drivers. The 
rapid and stubborn spread of non-native species fur-
ther frustrates recovery and intervention strategies. This 
emphasizes the importance of management frameworks 
that have an option to accept rapid and profound change 
(Lynch et  al. 2021) and calls on increasing research to 
evaluate a variety of approaches (Crausbay et al. 2021).
Reversing change is often resource intensive. To expand 
recovery efforts and maximize often limited resources, it 
may be critical for managers to prioritize particular sites. 
Recovery via planting conifers has received mixed suc-
cess (Ouzts et al. 2015; case studies #2, 3, 11), and thus 
more focus is currently being placed on targeted plant-
ing operations that have the highest potential for survival 
through drought and subsequent fire (Dumroese et  al. 
2016; North et al. 2019). Recovery efforts will have to rely 
on appropriate seed sources and planting stock, but the

necessary infrastructure has declined in recent decades 
(Fargione et  al. 2021), as has the availability of appro-
priate species. Opting to plant more drought-tolerant 
or more commercially-desired species could represent 
a choice to facilitate change rather than resist it (case 
study #3). Federal support and local efforts are needed 
to re-establish nursery production capacity, and doing 
so could present an opportunity to invest in underrep-
resented groups such as Native American communities 
and tribal forestry programs that have the capacity but 
may lack market demand to re-establish their nurseries. 
Open Source tools are also emerging that help to iden-
tify potential seed sources for planting operations (e.g., 
https://​seedl​otsel​ectio​ntool.​org/​sst/, 
https://​clima​teres​
torat​ionto​ol.​org/​csrt/) as well as where natural regenera-
tion after disturbance may be insufficient (https://​code.​
usgs.​gov/​werc/​redwo​od_​field_​stati​on/​poscr​ptr) 
and 
when and where planting operations may be most effica-
cious (e.g., https://​refor​estat​ion.​shiny​apps.​io/​preset/).
The option of observing change may be determined by 
a desire to “wait and see,” a lack of the resources needed 
to take more deliberate intervention measures to reverse 
change or by constraints in land designations, such 
as in wilderness areas. Uncertainties regarding unin-
tended consequences of active intervention (e.g., mov-
ing towards “undesired” conditions, “sometimes doing 
something is worse than doing nothing”) may also delay 
or prevent other actions. Allowing managers time to 
observe change is a valid approach to informed adap-
tive management (Sagarin and Pauchard 2010; Halofsky 
et al. 2018; Chazdon et al. 2021), especially given highly 
variable seasonal climates of recent years. Observing an 
ecosystem’s trajectory and understanding the dynamics 
of the developing community will help managers gain a 
general sense of the probability of type conversion, and 
whether the site risks invasion by problematic non-native 
species. However, institutional constraints may limit the 
ability to experiment with different approaches, particu-
larly with wildfire management (e.g., Abrams et al. 2021). 
For example, most agency mandates and funding streams 
are directed toward fire suppression rather than preven-
tion or recovery, leading to a mismatch between policy 
directives and ecological needs in some cases. In other 
cases, the number of agency staff available to support 
fire prevention or recovery may be limited by budgetary 
constraints.
Choosing to facilitate or direct change depends on 
agency mandates, site objectives, individual manag-
ers’ risk tolerance, and values. While examples of and 
research on intentional on-the-ground facilitation of 
VTC are generally lacking to date, more flexibility in 
management directives would allow for opportunities to 
better understand the dynamics of novel systems (Millar 
and Stephenson 2015). Findings from other efforts to 
facilitate change (e.g., assisted gene flow, assisted range 
expansion), while not specific to fire-driven VTC, may 
be useful for inspiration and lessons learned (McLane 
and Aitken 2012; McPherson et al. 2017; Richardson and 
Chaney 2018; Crotteau et al. 2019).
Trepidation in confronting the scale of VTC stems in 
part from the uncertainty of its trajectory given slow 
and variable recovery processes. Insights from Indig-
enous knowledge can aid in understanding the degree 
of a possible departure from historical ranges of vari-
ability, whether changes are undesirable from an eco-
cultural perspective, and options for management that 
proved effective in the past (Lake et al. 2017). Paleoeco-
logical and historical studies are helpful in gauging the 
long-term dynamics and persistence of various ecologi-
cal communities (Jackson 2012). Our understanding of 
the mechanisms and drivers of VTC is improving apace, 
with critical reviews on resilience and its properties (Falk 
et  al. 2019; Syphard et  al. 2019; Coop et  al. 2020; Falk 
et al. 2022) that provide a basis for comparison among 
events, and a focused language by which managers can 
compare events and areas (Stevens et  al. 2021). Efforts 
are also underway to estimate landscape resilience or lack 
thereof, and thus the probability of VTC ahead of distur-
bance (Walker et al. 2018; Marshall and Falk 2020).
As management paradigms shift to accommodate 
impending change (e.g., Truitt et  al. 2015; Schuurman 
et al. 2020), decisions around whether and how to accept 
or direct change will require new datasets and detailed 
models of plausible future ecological scenarios. Defin-
ing “desired conditions” may necessitate new models of 
collaboration that deeply engage stakeholders including 
local communities, tribes, and the broader public to bet-
ter incorporate social and economic considerations in 
ecological management discussions. Manager-scientist 
collaborations such as the Fire Science Exchange Net-
works (https://​www.​fires​cience.​gov/​JFSP_​excha​nges.​cfm) 
provide opportunities for workshops and field gatherings, 
peer-to-peer efforts such as the Burned Area Learning 
Network 
(https://​www.​conse​rvati​ongat​eway.​org/​Conse​
rvati​onPra​ctices/​FireL​andsc​apes/​FireL​earni​ngNet​work/​
Regio​nalNe​tworks/​Pages/​BALN.​aspx), and regional and 
place-based nongovernmental group initiatives help to 
promote awareness and readiness for VTC events. These 
efforts are changing the perceptions of managers, scien-
tists, and the public, helping to incorporate VTC into the 
planning and decision making of agencies and land man-
agers as they strive for “desired conditions” in a changing 
climate. Developing and assessing the capacity for man-
agement to achieve these conditions will require abun-
dant experimentation within a co-production framework 
and social license for less-than-certain success.

Opening the door to accepting and directing VTC has 
potentially far-reaching and long-lasting implications for 
species, ecosystems, and society. Managing for change 
represents a potentially dramatic departure from tradi-
tional land management philosophy, especially in areas 
designated as natural areas or wilderness. Engaging with 
VTC may require more intensive intervention in ecosys-
tem processes in many cases, but foundational principles 
for how to do this do not exist as yet. New and shared 
ethical frameworks drawing on science, Indigenous 
knowledge, and social consensus will be needed to guide 
this transition.
Future directions
VTC is among the most pressing issues for ecosys-
tem management in the southwestern United States. 
Although the phenomenon eludes a simple definition 
(van Mantgem et al. 2020), land managers “know it when 
they see it,” and there is a strong sense of alarm at what 
they have been witnessing in recent years. The experi-
ences and stories captured in 11 case studies presented 
here underscore that VTC is occurring at broad spatial 
and temporal scales (e.g., large patches to regional eco-
logical ranges, from decadal land-use changes to rapid 
post-fire transitions) across most southwestern forest and 
woodland types to grasslands, shrublands, and chapar-
ral. The rising sentiment among many managers appears 
to be that VTC at some scales and across many sites is 
a foregone conclusion following many high-severity fires 
in the study region. As VTC areas grow larger and more 
common, managers will increasingly need to shift their 
focus from persistence measures to recovery efforts in 
type-converted areas (Falk 2016). And as our collective 
understanding of VTC drivers, trajectories, and persis-
tence mechanisms grow, options for its management will 
expand. Some may prove to be ineffective, such as tradi-
tional plantation layouts in large patches far from par-
ent trees, while others may emerge that provide multiple 
benefits but might be considered acceptance or facilita-
tion of VTC by current standards. More systematic col-
lection and analyses of observations and on-the-ground 
experiences will be important to provide clarity and 
direction for research efforts that will help guide man-
agement. Land managers, practitioners, and scientists 
share many of the same trepidations regarding VTC, and 
the pace at which land management agencies are adapt-
ing to current conditions, but may also find strength in 
the collective experience and freedom to discuss experi-
ences. Future adaptive management of VTC-prone areas 
and areas that are undergoing VTC depends on co-pro-
duction and collaboration among managers, scientists, 
and stakeholders, particularly as we contend with rapid 
environmental changes.
