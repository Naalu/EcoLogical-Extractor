PERFORMANCE OF SCREENING BIOMASS 
FEEDSTOCKS USING STAR AND  
DECK SCREEN MACHINES 
H. Woo,  H.-S. Han 
ABSTRACT. The most commonly traded forms of biomass energy feedstock are chipped (wood chips) and ground (hog fuel) 
materials. Of these two feedstocks, particle size distribution is one of the key characteristics that affect efficient feedstock 
handling and biomass conversion. This paper compares productivity and effectiveness of star screener and deck screeners 
in separating chipped and ground material. Both machines were set up to separate feedstock into three different size cate-
gories: unders (<10 mm), accepts (10-51 mm), and overs (>51 mm). Results from the study indicated that the star screener 
(62.61 and 50.95 tons/h) was more productive than the deck screener (26.80 and 15.63 tons/h) when separating wood chips 
and hog fuel. Also, there was additional cost to apply screening systems to distribute the size of the materials; $3.53/ton 
and $6.05/ton for deck screen with wood chips and hog fuel and $1.61/ton and $1.98/ton for star screen with wood chips 
and hog fuel. For size distribution of screened materials, the 13-mm size materials had the highest portion of the accept size 
class, and the 25-mm size materials were primarily found in the oversize class, and pan size materials (e.g., sawdust) had 
the highest portion of the under size class. The feedstock materials screened using star and deck screening machines still 
had size variations exceeding over or under sizes in the under, accept, and over size classes. To improve the quality of 
screened materials, definitions of the size (under, accept, and over) should to be further refined.

orest residues including non-merchantable trees, 
small-diameter trees, tops, limbs, and chunks pro-
duced from mechanical thinning and conventional 
saw-timber harvesting operations provide an oppor-
tunity to produce bioenergy and bio-based forest products 
(Kizha and Han, 2016). Due to increasing fuel costs and en-
vironmental concerns, renewable biomass energy is an ap-
pealing alternative to fossil fuels (Han and Murphy, 2012). 
New technologies that are capable of converting forest resi-
dues into bioenergy and bioproducts are being developed. 
The most commonly traded forms of solid biomass feed-
stocks used to make these products are chips and hogfuel 
(ground material) (CEN/TS-14961, 2005). Each of these 
feedstocks have unique size characteristics that make them 
acceptable or not acceptable to different biomass conversion 
technologies (BCTs). Therefore meeting the feedstock spec-
ification requirements (e.g., size, moisture content, and con-
taminants) for specific BCTs becomes increasingly 
important. 
The distribution of particle sizes in a feedstock can di-
rectly affect its handling and utilization efficiency (Jensen 
et al., 2004). Fine materials, under 3 mm in length, have been 
shown to reduce air circulation during storage, which can in-
crease the risk of combustion and affect decay rate and du-
rability (Jirjis, 2005). Conversely, oversized materials, such 
as sticks or non-comminuted materials, often leads to bridg-
ing which blocks or hinders conveyance leading to ineffec-
tive handling (Mattsson, 1990). 
To increase biomass feedstock quality and productivity of 
BCTs, matching the specific feedstock size to BCTs is nec-
essary to improve consumer confidence in fuel quality assur-
ance (Han et al., 2015). Emerging conversion technologies 
such as combustion, gasification, pelletization, pyrolysis, 
briquettes, and torrefaction require specific size, moisture 
content, species, and contamination levels. Using those 
BCTs and optimized biomass operations logistics can en-
hance the economic viability of forest residue utilization by 
converting forest residues into value added and quality en-
ergy feedstock (table 1). 
Feedstock specifications for BCTs can be achieved by uti-
lizing new chipping, grinding tools, and screening technolo-
gies. Chippers and grinders are common machinery used for 
biomass size reduction (Han et al., 2015). Wood chip material 
is produced by cutting wood using knives in a chipper while 
hog fuel is produced by hitting wood using bits (or hammers) 
in a grinder, and each of the processes has advantages and dis-
advantages. Wood chips (chipped material) produced by a 
chipper are usually more homogeneous in shape and particle 
size compared to hog fuel (ground material).

APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE 
Particle size distribution is also affected by species (i.e., 
hardwood or softwood), type of logging residues (limbs, 
tops, stems, and chunk) (Spinelli et al., 2011), machine type 
(Spinelli et al., 2005), comminution device (Mattsson and 
Kofman, 2003), and cutting tool wear such as knives, bits, 
and anvils (Nati et al., 2010). Size distribution using me-
chanical screening is cost-effective (Sultanbawa et al., 2001) 
and is widely used in many different industries (Spinelli 
et al., 2011), and commonly used in handling and refining 
solid fuels such as coal (Govender and Van Dyk, 2003). 
There has been increasing interest in incorporating new 
screening technologies into biomass operations to improve 
product quality and to meet feedstock size requirements for 
emerging BCTs. The goals of this study were: (a) comparing 
screening productivity of different types of screening ma-
chines (star and deck screens) for two feedstock material 
types (wood chips and hog fuel) and (b) comparing screen-
ing results of wood chips and hog fuel size distribution after 
sorting by two different screen machines. 
METHODS AND MATERIALS 
MATERIAL SPECIFICATION 
Both ground material (hog fuel) and chipped material 
(wood chips) were classified into three different feedstock 
sizes. Wood chips used for this study were produced using a 
Peterson 5900EL disc chipper with a 765 horsepower en-
gine. The chipper was a standard three knife configuration 
set to produce 22-mm (7/8 in.) size chips. The chipped ma-
terials were Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and west-
ern hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) tops that ranged from 6 to 
17 cm in diameter. The hog fuel was ground with a horizon-
tal Peterson 4710 grinder (Peterson Pacific Corp., Eugene, 
Ore.) that had a 765-hp engine. The grinder setting included 
a solid anvil and three grates with two different sizes (one 8-
cm and two 10-cm grate holes) and produced hog fuel for 
our screening experiments. The outer bits on the rotor were 
carbide hammer bits, and the inner bits were chipper bits. 
The hog fuel and wood chips materials were stored sepa-
rately and were each mixed before applying screen machines 
to reduce sampling bias. The ground materials included all 
types (tops, branches, and chunks) of logging residues from 
a mixed conifer stand in western Oregon. 
SCREEN MACHINES SPECIFICATION 
Star Screen 
The Terra select S6-E star screen Peterson (Peterson Pa-
cific Corp., Eugene, Ore.) has a 74-hp engine with 3-fraction 
screening. The material was screened through each rolling star 
disc and was distributed out into three different size classes, 
under, accept and over. The Terra select S6-E star screen sys-
tem is operated with star disc roller. The screening process is 
operated with controlling speed of star discs. The space be-
tween the star discs determine the range of the screened parti-
cle size. Also, the speed of star discs rotating of the shaft affect 
the size distribution of screened material. For instance, slower 
the rotating shafts, the more opportunity material has a chance 
to pass and screen through the gap between the star discs. Hog 
fuel and wood chips were screened with different disc rolling 
speed to find optimized screen settings. 
Deck Screen 
The DS6162 deck screen machine is assembled by Peter-
son Co. (Eugene, Ore.) and is a self-contained screening 
tool. The deck screener has a 130-hp engine and productivity 
up to 500 ton/h. The deck screen is assembled with four sets 
of screen sieves. The screen sieves are quick and simple to 
convert to different sieve sizes. The material size is con-
trolled by different screen size settings on the top and bottom 
of the screening area. In this study, the screen sieve size was 
set to 5 × 5 cm on the top and 1 × 1 cm on the bottom (fig 1).  
The under size class was defined as under 1 × 1 cm di-
mension, accept as 1 × 1 cm to 5 × 5 cm and over size was 
any material bigger than 5 × 5 cm. 
FIELD PRODUCTIVITY MEASUREMENT AND  
FEEDSTOCK SAMPLING 
Productivity of Screen Machines 
The screeners tested were set to sort three different size 
classes: under, accept, and over size. After a material type 
(wood chips or hog fuel) was screened, the different size 
classes were weighed independently in their bins using a 
nearby weigh station. These weights, along with the time it 
took to complete the screening were used to measure produc-
tivity. Only the screening operation time was recorded be-
cause the study was focused on screening machine operation 
productivity (i.e., not logistics of screening operations). Ma-
chine hourly costs were estimated based on methods de-
scribed by (Miyata, 1980) (table 2). 
The cost of the loader operation was assumed to be 
$121.5/PMH for both screeners (Harrill and Han, 2012). 
Fuel consumption of the operation was estimated by starting 
the screen machine with a full fuel tank and recording the 
refilled fuel level using a 1000-mL marked container at the 
end of each cycle. To estimate the screening productivity of 
each machine, a time-motion study was conducted during 
the screening operations. The operation was repeated three 
times for each screener and material type (wood chips and 
hog fuel) for a total of 12 trials. Each screening operation 
cycle time started when the 20 yd3 container was empty and 
ended when it was fully loaded. 
The wood chip and hog fuel piles used for this experiment 
weighed approximately 5 tons each. They were independently

mixed with a front-end loader before screening to reduce sam-
pling bias. The initial material pile for each material type was 
divided into two piles for the star and deck screen machines. 
Screened materials (wood chips and hog fuel) were collected 
during the screening operation to evaluate size distribution and 
moisture content (MC) for each size class (under, accept, and 
over). Moisture content samples were collected from each size 
categories for each cycle and were then stored in 0.5-L plastic 
bags with tight lids. Each bag was sampled at the beginning of 
the fill of the bin container, the middle of the fill, and when the 
bin container was full. Ten samples were collected using 3-L 
plastic bags for evaluating size distribution. Each sample con-
sisted of 3 L of chips and hog fuels, which were tightly sealed 
after collection to avoid drying. The bags were marked with the 
sequence of sampling, material types and machine types. In to-
tal, 120 samples were collected for moisture content and 
240 samples were collected for size distribution. Moisture con-
tent was measured based on the European standard (CEN/TS-
14774-1, 2004). Moisture content samples were placed in pa-
per bags and weighed with a precision balance before putting 
the samples the air drying oven at 103±2°C. The biomass sam-
ples were dried for no longer than 24 hours to minimize losses 
of volatile compounds. Also according to standards, constancy 
in mass is defined as a change not exceeding 0.2% of the total 
loss in mass (CEN/TS-14774-1, 2004). 
To analyze the accuracy of size distribution performance 
of the screen machines, the samples were brought into the 
laboratory and rescreened using an oscillating sieve shaker 
(fig. 2). There were six, seven, and eight different sieve sizes 
combination used in the shaker for under-, accept-, and over-
sized materials, respectively (table 3). Oscillating screening 
operation time was set to 2 min for each screening perfor-
mance. Each screened material in the fraction mass was 
measured to the nearest 0.1 g with precision mass balance 
(15149-1, 2006). 
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
Data analysis was performed using R statistics package. 
T-tests were used to compare productivity, fuel consumption 
of machines, and moisture content. One-way analysis of var-
iance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the effect of moisture 
content and size classes (under, accept, and over) on screen-
ing productivity for each screening machine. 
Material size distribution was analyzed using a linear 
model on distributed size weight with categorical variables 
of machine type, material type, screen setting, and size clas-
ses. The model used a general linear model (GLM) with a 
logit transformation function to fit the 0 to 1 distribution of 
proportions (proportion of size distributed materials) into a 
normal distribution (Hoffmann, 2004). To avoid the inherent 
problem of applying the log function to a zero value, 0.16667 
was added to all zero values (Mosteller and Tukey, 1977). A 
linear regression model was used to determine the relation-
ship among size distribution and machine types, material 
types, screen setting at a 95% confidence interval (α= 0.05). 
To test interaction terms between independent variables, 
two-way interactions (machine types with size distribution 
and material types with size distribution) were tested. In ad-
dition, the model tested 3- and 4-way interaction terms in the 
analysis, however, there were no significant interactions 
terms in 3- and 4-way interaction terms test. Because of this, 
3- and 4-way interaction terms were not included in the re-
sults of this analysis. 
Sampling efficiency was evaluated for each size distribu-
tion class based on bootstrap variances generated with data

sampled from each material types (wood chips and hog fuel) 
and machines types (star and deck screen). Sample size was 
determined using bootstrap analysis by randomly sampling 
points with replacement from the original dataset (Kane 
et al., 2009). For this study, 2000 random data points were 
generated from bootstrap repetition through the sample size 
for each material type (wood chips and hog fuel) and ma-
chine type (star and deck). 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
PRODUCTIVITY, COST, AND FUEL CONSUMPTION  
OF THE SCREENING MACHINES 
The star screener’s productivity was two times greater 
than the deck screener, and fuel consumption was three times 
less than the deck screener (table 4). The screening produc-
tivity and fuel consumption for both machines were highly 
affected by the screening mechanisms and engine sizes used 
in each machine. There were differences in the screening 
mechanism processes between deck and star machines, the 
deck screener required feeding time to completely screen 
materials, while the star screen rolling disc supported feed-
ing process from the hopper onto the screen. In addition, the 
deck screen machine was equipped with a larger-sized en-
gine compared to the star screen. The star screen also used 
efficient diesel-electric drives. The deck screen used less ef-
ficient diesel-hydraulic drives with open-loop flow control 
valves. The less efficient drive system on the deck screen 
was part of the reason for the increased fuel consumption. 
The results also showed that wood chips had a higher 
productivity than hog fuel for both machines, but hog fuel 
consumed less fuel compared to wood chips in the deck 
screen. 
As a results, there was an additional cost to apply the 
screening system to distribute the size of the materials; 
$3.53/ton and $6.05/ton for the deck screen with wood chips 
and hog fuel and $1.61/ton and $1.98/ton for star screen with 
wood chips and hog fuel, respectively. The star screen is a 
better option for maximizing the productivity of screening 
products compared to the deck screen system. However, the 
maintenance cost of the deck screen is less than the star 
screen. To improve the system balance, the deck screen is 
suitable for small scale biomass size distribution.  
MOISTURE CONTENTS OF THE BIOMASS MATERIALS 
AMONG THE SIZE CLASS 
The results of the mean moisture content values among 
the size classes and different materials are shown in table 5. 
Oversize material has the highest moisture content propor-
tion in both wood chips (54%) and hog fuel (58%) materials. 
The results of the ANOVA test of size classes shows that 
there was a significant difference between accept-, over-, 
and under-size materials. When comparing wood chips and 
hog fuel moisture contents, hog fuel had higher moisture 
contents than wood chips in all size classes. Unfortunately, 
effect of moisture contents of screening performance was not 
tested in this research. To test effect of moisture contents of 
screening operation, the biomass feedstock samples were to 
be controlled with different contents of moisture. However, 
this experimental design was not captured controlling mois-
ture contents of the biomass feedstock. 
RESULT OF BIOMASS FEEDSTOCK SIZE DISTRIBUTION  
In the accept-size class (10 to 50 mm), material type had 
a significant effect on the proportion of materials captured 
on the different sieves (P<0.05). There was a significant in-
teraction between material type (hog fuel and wood chips) 
and machine type (deck and star screen) (P<0.05) (table 6). 
This was primarily caused by two different reasons. First of 
all, star and deck screens have different mechanical systems 
to distribute the size of biomass material. Deck screens are 
operated with different settings of screen sieves which have 
modular decks wire or punch plates. However, the star 
screen controls feedstock size by changing the speed of the 
star disc roller. The characteristics of hog fuel materials, 
which include a spear shape and small-sized wood chips, 
caused it to dive into sieve holes and it produced less accu-
rate results in deck screened products. The differences in the

combination of machines and materials caused the interac-
tion term in accept- and under-size classes. 
Based on size distribution results, star screening is rec-
ommended for screening hog fuel material. The heterogene-
ous size and shape of the biomass materials, especially in 
hog fuel, make it necessary to study the relation between 
shape and size distribution of screening materials. 
The different machine and material combinations tested 
in this experiment showed similar size distribution patterns 
in the accept size class (fig. 3). The star screen with wood 
chips showed the highest amount of 13- and 19-mm size ma-
terials. The deck screen with wood chips showed the second 
highest amount for 13- and 19-mm sizes. The star screen 
with hog fuel had the highest amount of materials within pan 
sizes (under 6-mm), 19-, 25-, 38-, and 51-mm sizes. The 
deck screener and hog fuel in combination showed the high-
est proportion in 6- and 51-mm sizes. The 13-mm size ma-
terial had the highest proportion in overall machine and 
material combinations. In the accept size class, 13- and 19-
mm size materials were the dominate size classes. 
In the over-size class, size distribution of samples was sig-
nificantly influenced by material type and machine type. 
There wasn’t a significant two-way interaction between mate-
rial type (hog fuel and wood chips) and machine type (deck 
and star screen) (P>0.44). In the deck and wood chips combi-
nation the 25- and 51-mm materials dominated the oversize 
class. In this combination there were no materials from pan 
(<6-mm), 6-, 10-, 13-, and 19-mm size materials. The star 
screen and wood chip combination had similar patterns to the 
deck and wood chip combination. The dominant size materi-
als were found in 38- to 25-mm and 76- to 51-mm size sieves. 
Also, there were no materials from pan (<6-mm) and 6- to  
13-mm size materials. The combination of the deck screen and 
hog fuel had the highest proportion in the 25- to 38-mm size 
sieve. Compared to wood chip materials, hog fuel materials 
were found in all different sieves except the 10- to 6-mm sieve 
size. Except for the 19- to 13-mm, 25- to 19-mm, and 38- to 
25-mm sieve sizes, the hog fuel and star screen combination 
had a higher proportion in material in all sieve size classes 
than the hog fuel and deck screen combination. 
ANOVA tests for the under size class showed that there 
were significant effects on the amount of under size class 
materials by material size (s2), material types (M), and ma-
chine types (MT) (P < 0.05). The pan size (<6-mm) and 10- 
to 6-mm materials were the most prominent classes in under-
size material. The deck screener and hog fuel combination 
had the highest amount in the pan size and star-hog fuel, star-
chip, and deck-chip combinations had the next greatest 
amounts, respectively. There were few materials obtained 
from 13- to 10-mm, 19- to 15-mm, and 25- to 19-mm size 
classes. Also, there were no materials from the above 25-mm 
size class. The deck and wood chip combination had the 
highest proportion in the 10- to 6-mm size sieve, followed 
by deck hog fuel, star hog fuel, star chip, respectively. 
When separating wood chips, the deck screener had an 
overall 84% accuracy in the accept-size class. This means 
that 84% of the total sample consisted of particles within the 
accept size range (10 to 51 mm) after being screened. 
Among the different material types (wood chips and hog 
fuel) and screen machines (deck and star), deck screen with 
wood chip material had the highest accuracy in the accept 
class. The deck screen with hog fuel material had the lowest 
accuracy compared to the other combinations. This was due 
to the high variability in the particle size of hog fuel. Among 
accept-, under-, and over-size classes, the under-size class 
had the greatest accuracy for all machine and material com-
binations (table 7). 
When separating hog fuel the deck screener had a prob-
lem with long and narrow “spear-like” particles “diving” or 
vibrating end up and in the small screen holes. The deck 
screen had a 9% accuracy when screening over size with 
wood chip materials. Based on the size distribution results, 
38- to 51-mm size materials should belong in the over-size 
material class. When using screen machines for size distri-
bution, the screened size should be further defined as under 
<10 mm, accept 10 to 38 mm, and over >38 mm. 
In the accept size of hog fuel materials using the star 
screen, 77% of the hog fuel materials were located in the 10- 
to 51-mm range. Compared to hog fuel deck screening, star 
hog fuel screening had an increased accuracy of 17%. The 
characteristics of hog fuel materials, which include a spear 
shape and small-sized wood chips, caused it to dive into 
sieve holes in the deck screen. This produced less accurate 
results in the screened products. The star screen would be a 
better option to use if diving long, spear-shaped hog fuel ma-
terials became an issue in feedstock quality in size distribu-
tion. However, star screen maintenance costs are much 
higher than deck screen, and the maintenance cost needs to 
be considered in machine selection.

Common screens used for wood chips and hog fuel in-
clude deck, trommel, and star screen machines. Each 
screener has various factors that affect screening perfor-
mance. For instance, the unbalanced rotating weights that 
generate the screen box vibration can rotate about a horizon-
tal axis or a vertical axis. The type of screening (various wire 
designs, punch plate, plastics medium) also affects the deck 
screen productivity and accuracy. The screen openings in the 
top deck are typically varied so the first section of the deck 
screen sieve has smaller openings to minimize spearing. The 
results from these experiments on both deck and star screen-
ers are specific to the setups listed within this paper and 
should not be generalized for all deck and star screeners. The 
deck angles, frequency and hopper of the DS6162 were op-
timized for compost screening. Changing any of the varia-
bles listed above could have a significant effect on the 
productivity and classification results if they were optimized 
for wood chips or hog fuel. 
Inclined deck screens DS6162 are very common, eco-
nomical, and productive. They are commonly used in the ag-
gregate industry where most material is closer to a spherical 
shape. Wood chips typically have one short orthogonal di-
mension (thickness). The length/thickness ratio is typically 
4 to 5. Hog fuel typically fractures into long cylindrical 
shapes with two of the three orthogonal dimensions much 
smaller than the third dimension. Deck screens of the 
DS6162 type screen the material such that longer slender 
particles can “spear” through the screen openings 
(Cummings, 2015). 
The star screens and disc screens separate material based 
on the space between the stars or discs. The rotational speed 
and inclination of the screening deck also impact the classi-
fication accuracy. Star screens, especially if they are lightly 
loaded can also be susceptible to “spearing”. Both star and 
deck screens will produce more uniform classification if they 
are optimally and uniformly loaded. If they are overloaded, 
some of the fine and accept fractions will end up in the overs 
fraction. It they are under loaded, more “spear” will end up 
in the fine and accepts fraction. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The results of this study show similar patterns in size dis-
tribution between star and deck screens but the star screen 
had more accurate size distributions in hog fuel materials. 
The star screener also had significantly greater productivity 
compared to the deck screener. When looking at the produc-
tivity of the machines with different material types wood 
chips had a higher productivity than hog fuel in both ma-
chines. The star screener also consumed significantly less 
fuel compared to the deck screener. Fuel consumption of the 
star and deck screener were affected by the different size of 
engines and the less efficient diesel hydraulic system of the 
deck screener compared to diesel electric drives on the star 
screener. To test the effect of screening performance of 
moisture contents, the biomass feedstock samples are should 
to be controlled with different contents of moisture. In future 
study, controlled moisture contents of the biomass feedstock

are needed to test for effect of moisture contents on the 
screening performance. When looking at size distribution of 
the screened material, there were size variations in both 
wood chip and hog fuel materials among under, accept, and 
over size. To increase the accuracy of size distribution re-
sults using screen machines, the definition of the size range 
can be modified as under <10 mm, accept 10 to 38 mm, and 
over >38 mm. The results of this study provide valuable in-
formation when considering the supply of quality (i.e., uni-
form in size) biomass feedstock that meets the requirements 
for various biomass conversion technologies such as torre-
faction and gasification.
