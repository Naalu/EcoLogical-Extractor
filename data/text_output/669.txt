Abstract
Effective management and restoration of ponderosa pine forests requires an understanding of the heterogeneity of
contemporary and historical stand structures. We assessed spatial and temporal patterns of tree establishment, mortality
and size structure over a 30-year period in an old-growth ponderosa pine stand in the mid-montane zone of the Colorado Front
Range. We analyzed spatial patterns and spatial associations using Ripley’s K(t) and K12(t) and then modeled the patterns using
point process models. Forest age structure was estimated by aging a sub-sample of trees in the stand. Climate appeared to play a
signiﬁcant role in the coarse-scale temporal pattern of regeneration events. Stand structure (distribution of patches, light
availability, and seed trees) inﬂuenced the spatial and temporal pattern of more recent regeneration events. Patchy regeneration
resulted in spatial independence and some segregation of size classes. Older trees in the stand (40–55 cm dbh) exhibited some
regularity in their spatial distribution at short distances indicating that patterns of mortality had been historically patchy.
Contemporary patterns of mortality were mostly patchy, and mountain pine beetles caused a signiﬁcant amount of mortality in
the 1970s and 1980s. Both establishment and mortality retained spatial patterns that were somewhat consistent with pre-
settlement forests, despite changes in driving processes.

clearer understanding of the role of structure in
mediating
key
ecosystem
processes.
Traditional
descriptions of stand structure have focused on
stand-level collective attributes such as average tree
size, density, and basal area. However, the horizontal
and vertical heterogeneity of forest structure inﬂu-
ences tree growth, plant species diversity, wildlife
habitat, and ﬁre behavior (Harrod et al., 1999; Ehle
and Baker, 2003; Waltz et al., 2003; Homyack et al.,
2004; Youngblood et al., 2004). Spatially explicit
geostatistical tools characterize forests as composi-
tions of individual trees, with unique spatial arrange-
ments and patterns. Spatial pattern is one component
of forest structure that may reveal insights about the
historical and environmental processes, such as
regeneration, climate, mortality and competition,
which have shaped current stand structure (Moeur,
1993; Pretzsch, 1997; Youngblood et al., 2004). This
knowledge can help facilitate the development of
silvicultural systems and management strategies to
meet changing objectives and goals for forested lands.
Many ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.)
forests have undergone major changes in stand
structure since Euro-American settlement, including
increases in tree densities and near-elimination of the
natural ﬁre disturbance regime (Cooper, 1960; White,
1985; Savage and Swetnam, 1990; Savage, 1991; Fule
et al., 1997). A number of studies have inferred
historical patterns of regeneration and stand develop-
ment
for
southwestern
ponderosa
pine
systems
(mainly Arizona and New Mexico) for restoration
and ﬁre management purposes (Cooper, 1960; White,
1985; Covington and Moore, 1994; Savage et al.,
1996). Much less is known about the historical
structure of ponderosa pine forests along the Front
Range
of
Colorado,
which
is
the
easternmost
mountain range of the Rocky Mountains, north of
the Arkansas River. Differences in climate, soils, and
topography result in different disturbance regimes and
patterns of stand development in Colorado than in the
Southwest (Peet, 1981; Goldblum and Veblen, 1992;
Shinneman and Baker, 1997; Mast and Veblen, 1999).
While southwest ponderosa pine forests are thought to
have burned with frequent, low-severity surface ﬁres
(Cooper, 1960; Swetnam, 1990; Covington and
Moore, 1994; Fule et al., 1997; Moore et al., 1999),
Front Range ponderosa pine forests in the lower to
mid-montane zone appear to have had less frequent
mixed-severity ﬁres displaying a greater range in ﬁre
behavior (Brown et al., 1999; Kaufmann et al., 2000).
This regime may have resulted in more spatially
variable patterns of stand structure across the land-
scape (Turner and Romme, 1994; Brown et al., 1999).
Despite differences in ﬁre return intervals and ﬁre
behavior, regeneration of ponderosa pine in both the
Southwest and the Colorado Front Range is a patchy,
episodic event that is largely driven by climatic
conditions and disturbance events (Pearson, 1923;
Peet, 1981; Savage et al., 1996; Mast et al., 1998; Mast
and Veblen, 1999). Ponderosa pine patch structure has
been described as even-aged (Cooper, 1960, 1961) or
uneven-aged (White, 1985) depending on the severity
of the overstory mortality, and the intensity and spatial
pattern of the ﬁre which prepared the mineral seedbed
for germination. Mast and Veblen (1999) demon-
strated that in the pine-grassland ecotone of the
Colorado Front Range competition and self-thinning
resulted in mixed-size, but even-aged patches of
mature trees. The limited number of studies of
ponderosa pattern and stand development along the
Front Range means we have little understanding of
how elevation, disturbance history, and other site
differences are likely to change these expectations.
Our objective in this study was to use spatially
explicit, individual tree data to describe and interpret
spatial patterns and interactions of tree establishment,
mortality and size structure over a 30-year period in an
old-growth ponderosa pine stand in the mid-montane
zone of the Colorado Front Range. We addressed three
questions: (1) what role has ﬁre and climate played in
structuring the current forest? (2) what are the
contemporary
patterns
of
recruitment
and
tree
mortality and how do they compare to our under-
standing of historical ponderosa pine patterns? (3) do
size classes of trees differ in spatial patterning as a
result of recruitment and mortality processes?
2. Methods
2.1. Study area
The study was conducted in the Manitou Experi-
mental Forest, 40 km northwest of Colorado Springs,
CO. The elevation is 2500 m, and the study area has a
very mild slope to the southeast. Average precipitation
S. Boyden et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 219 (2005) 43–55
44

is 40 cm/yr, 25% of which falls as snow, and the mean
monthly temperature is 5 8C, with an average growing
season high of 16 8C. Soils of this region are primarily
developed from alluvial deposits of Pikes Peak
granite. Soils in our study plot are a complex of
Boyett series (coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive,
frigid Typic Haplustalfs) and Frenchcreek series
(Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic
Haplustolls) formed in arkosic sandstone alluvium
(Moore and Deiter, 1992).
Commercial logging of this region of the Colorado
Front Range began in the late 1800s, and most of the
current Experimental Forest area was heavily thinned
of large diameter trees between 1880 and 1886
(Parker, 1930). There have been no other logging
operations in the stand, so we assumed that all visible
stumps dated to this time period. Our mapping of the
residual stumps in 2002 showed that about 30 trees/ha
were removed, which represents about 15% of the
estimated stand density at that time. It is unlikely that
many more trees were cut than what we observed
because the generally dry climate and the large size of
many of the stumps suggest that decomposition has
been relatively slow. There had been no recorded
wildﬁres in the Manitou Experimental Forest since
1846, until the recent Hayman ﬁres of 2002 which
burned a portion of the Northwest part of the forest,
outside of our study plot. The study plot has a pure
overstory of ponderosa pine, with an understory
dominated by perennial grasses such as Arizona
fescue (Festuca arizonica) and mountain muhly
(Muhlenbergia montana), as well as forbs, and a
small number of common juniper (Juniperus commu-
nis) shrubs.
2.2. Sampling and analysis
In 1974, a 9.3 ha square plot was established by the
USDA Forest Service and all stems taller than 1.37 m
were tagged and mapped using an XY-coordinate
system (Fig. 1). The diameters of tagged trees were
measured in 1974, 1983, 1991, and 2001. New trees
reaching 1.37 m height were mapped, and diameters
recorded in 1991 and 2001. The mortality of tagged
stems was recorded in 1983, 1991 and 2001.
The distribution of tree ages in the plot was
determined from 18 random points, with cores taken to
the pith on all trees counted by a prism (4.59 m2/ha
basal area factor). One hundred trees were cored at
30 cm above ground level. Cores were surfaced,
crossdated and aged according to standard procedures
(Stokes and Smiley, 1968). We grouped the estimated
pith dates into 10-year age classes for assessing
temporal patterns in tree establishment. A detailed
study of destructively harvested pines in a ponderosa
pine stand about 30 km away (Kaufmann et al., 2000)
estimated that the difference in the pith date from
30 cm to the ground (actual germination) was 10
years. Using the prism method to reconstruct age
structure assumes that there is a strong relationship
between tree age and size. Age and size were
correlated (n = 100, r2 = 0.54), but the variability in
the relationship means that inferences about age
structure should be limited to only large scale
temporal patterns.
2.3. Describing spatial patterns
Tree patterns were analyzed using Ripley’s K
functions (Moeur, 1993). The K(t) function estimates
spatial dependence between points of the same type
(e.g., one size class) at a range of spatial scales. The
K(t) function produces a cumulative distribution
function that represents the expected number of trees
within a given distance of an individual tree, and is
weighted to correct for edge effects (Ripley, 1981;
Fortin, 1994; Chen and Bradshaw, 1999). We report
results as L(t), which is a square root transformation
that linearizes K(t) and stabilizes its variance. The
model can be used to test point data for departure from

a spatially random pattern, as described by a Poisson
process. We computed 95% conﬁdence intervals on a
Monte Carlo simulated Poisson process using 99
simulations (Besag and Diggle, 1977). Observed
patterns differ from random at P = 0.05 where the plot
of L(t) falls outside the simulated conﬁdence envelope.
Clustered arrangements are indicated by an L(t) above
the envelope, and regular tree spacing occurs where
L(t) falls below the envelope.
Spatial associations of trees of different size classes
were analyzed using a bivariate K-function, Ripley’s
K12(t) (Lotwick and Silverman, 1982; Diggle, 1983;
RowlingsonandDiggle,1993).Thisfunctioncalculates
the expected mean number of individuals of type two
within a given distance of an arbitrary individualof type
one. The null hypothesis of spatial independence
betweenthe twogroupsisrefutedwherevaluesofK12(t)
fall above or below a 95% conﬁdence envelope,
indicating a positive (attraction) or negative (repulsion)
spatial association between the two groups. A 95%
conﬁdence interval is calculated using random toroidal
shifts of one pattern relative to the other during each of
99 Monte Carlo iterations. L(t) and K12(t) were
calculated for lag distances up to 150 m (half the
distance of the shortest plot axis), but if spatial patterns
were consistent at all lag distances, results were plotted
at shorter distances for easier viewing.
2.4. Point-process models
Clumped trees, as identiﬁed by the K(t) function,
were modeled using a Neyman–Scott point-process
model in order to gain more insight into the nature and
intensity of the patterns, and therefore the mechanisms
that drive them (Ripley, 1981; Cressie, 1993; Geyer,
1999). The Neyman–Scott distribution is routinely used
to describe clumped spatial patterns, particularly for
plants that are patchy as a result of their regeneration
methods (Neyman, 1939; Neyman and Scott, 1957).
The algorithm generates a Poisson process with a
certain intensity (l) to describe the distribution of the
parents, and then replaces each parent point by a
randomclusterof offspring.Theoffspringarelocated in
a radially symmetric way around the parents according
to a bivariate Gaussian distribution, and the number of
offspring per parent follows a Poisson distribution.
The process of testing whether a point pattern ﬁts a
Neyman–Scott process is identical to the method for
using
a
K-function
for
testing
departure
from
randomness. In this case the conﬁdence envelope is
generated using the Neyman–Scott rather than the
Poisson distribution, after the parameters have been ﬁt
to the data. Input parameters for simulating the
Neyman–Scott process can be estimated by looking at
the plots of the original L(t) functions. The lag
distance and value of L(t) at the point of maximum
divergence from a random process can be used to
estimate the average cluster size and cluster intensity.
Providing the initial parameter estimates, the Ney-
man–Scott process is then ﬁt to observed point
patterns using least squares techniques (Diggle, 1983;
Batista and Maguire, 1998; Reich and Davis, 1998) to
optimize the model parameters. The K-function for a
Neyman–Scott process is given by
Kðh; s2; rÞ ¼ ph2 þ r1f1  expðh2=4s2Þg
where r is the intensity of the parent process, and 2s2
is the mean squared distance to an offspring.
A 95% conﬁdence envelope for the ﬁnal point
process model is generated through 99 iterations of a
Monte Carlo simulation. If the L(t) plot for the observed
data falls within the simulated envelope for the
Neyman–Scott process, it suggests that the pattern
has the properties of that speciﬁed model. We also
tested how well an observed point pattern ﬁt a given
model using the Cramer–von Mises goodness-of-ﬁt
test, which compares the simulated and observed point
patterns and tests the null hypothesis that the two
patterns are signiﬁcantly different (Cressie, 1993).
Trees were grouped into six diameter classes (0–6,
6–15, 15–25, 25–40, 40–55, and >55 cm dbh) to
identify patterns and mechanisms that may operate on
cohort age or canopy position. We used narrower size-
ranges for the smaller diameter classes because of the
large number of small trees, and in order to separate the
saplings as much as possible from the pole-sized trees.
L(t) functions and point process models were generated
for all size classes in 1974 and 2001, as well as for
establishment data from 1991 and 2001, and mortality
data from 1983, 1991, and 2001. Bivariate K-functions
were done for all logical pairwise combinations of size
class, establishment and mortality, although not all
results are reported. All spatial statistics were computed
using Reich and Davis’s online spatial library (Reich
and Davis, 1998) in S-Plus 2000 (Mathsoft, 1999).

3. Results
3.1. Density, size and age structure
The study plot contained 3657 live trees in 2001,
with an average density of 420 stems/ha, and 21 m2/
ha of basal area. The diameter distribution (Fig. 2)
was multimodal; discounting the large number of
trees less than 5 cm dbh, the older size classes were
approximately normally distributed, rather than
classically J-shaped, as would be expected in an
uneven-aged forest. Fig. 3B shows the current age
distribution in the stand, estimated from our tree
cores, and therefore represents the cumulative effects
of successful germination and survival. Some tree
establishment occurred every decade until the early
1900s, with larger cohorts of trees dating to periods
beginning around 1780, 1880, and 1960 (these dates
include the germination correction factor, but are not
precise given the limitations of our reconstruction
method). There are few or no remaining trees dating to
the early to mid-1900s, suggesting low regeneration
and/or survival during this time. Stand density in 1870
was estimated to be about 200 stems/ha, determined
by adding the number of living stems that predate
1870 with the number of stems harvested in the late
1800s, and assuming a low level of non-sapling
mortality of 10 stems/decade. A ﬁre chronology was
reconstructed for the plot by cross-dating ﬁre scars
from a sub-sample of trees in the stand (methods in
Brown and Shepperd (2001)). The chronology
showed six ﬁres had burned in the stand since 1600
(Fig. 3B). A few old-growth trees remained from
the early 1600s and many trees established in the 80
years prior to the last documented ﬁre in the stand in
1846.
3.2. Contemporary patterns of recruitment
The low density of small trees in 1974 (Fig. 4)
suggests that recruitment was slow in the early to mid-
1900s (absolute regeneration numbers could differ
widely due to seedling mortality). The density of small
trees doubled over 20 years, from 1974 to 1991, and
then dramatically tripled in the subsequent decade
(Fig. 4). Given that it takes 20–25 years for pine
seedlings to reach 1.37 m (Shepperd, unpublished),
these small trees would have germinated in the 1960s
through 1980s. This new cohort of small trees
increased stand density by 30% over 30 years, though
basal area increased by only 10% during the same
period (data not shown). The trees themselves were
highly clumped (Table 2). Fig. 5 gives an example of a
clumped L(t) function (using the 1991 establishment
data) that was best modeled with a Neyman–Scott
point process model. New saplings were not only more
numerous in 2001, but the patches were smaller and
denser, with nearly twice as many trees per patch than
in 1991 (Table 1).
Bivariate
K-functions demonstrated
that trees
which established from 1983 to 1991 were spatially
associated with trees in the 6–15 cm size class in 1991
(Fig. 6) at all scales up to 30 m, and with the largest
canopy trees >55 cm dbh at scales of 20–35 m
(Table 2). There was repulsion between the establish-
ing trees and all other size classes in 1991. The pulse
of 1991–2001 establishment showed almost identical
spatial patterns (Table 2), associated with 6–15 cm
trees at scales from 3 to 25 m, and with trees >55 cm
at 15–20 m distances. The association between 1991
and 2001 establishment and all other tree size classes
was also negative at a similar range of scales as
observed for the 1983–1991 data.
3.3. Patterns of mortality
Rates of mortality were low but variable in
magnitude and pattern over 30 years (Fig. 7).
Mortality was near 9% from 1974 to 1983, or less
than 1% per year, dropping to less than 0.01%

mortality per year in the last two decades. Trees that
died between 1974 and 1983 occurred in large,
aggregated patches across the stand, with an average
patch radius of 20 m and approximately 16 trees per

Fig. 3. The age structure (B) showed a large spike of recent recruitment, preceded by substantial recruitment and survival in most decades
between 1800 and 1930. Tree ages shown are based on the age-size relationship (n = 100, r2 = 0.56) for a sub-sample of trees selected by a prism
(4.59 m2/ha basal area factor). Ages are not adjusted for the germination correction factor (10 years earlier). Fires recorded as scars on two or
more trees are indicated by (~). The three clearest peaks in recruitment and survival are associated with periods of wet climate (A) (indicated by
a large Palmer drought severity index (PDSI for the Colorado Front Range; Cook et al., 1999; Cook, 2000)).

bounds of the Neyman–Scott model, conﬁrming that the data are
spatially clumped at all distances.

patch (Table 1). Mortality patterns viewed individu-
ally for each size class (data not shown) showed that
it was primarily the 25–40 cm trees that died in large
patches (30 m radius) consisting of 12 trees on
average. Smaller and larger trees died in small
patches of only a few individuals each. A Poisson
model best described 1983–1991 mortality patterns,
indicating spatial independence in the location of
tree deaths (Table 1). Mortality from 1991 to 2001
was slightly clumped, primarily in the 25–40 cm size
class. Other size classes had an overall random
pattern of mortality.
Surprisingly, tree establishment was not spatially
associated
with
areas
of
high
tree
mortality
(Table 2). Areas of tree establishment were either
segregated or spatially independent from areas of
tree mortality, depending upon the pairwise combi-
nation.
3.4. Structural patterns
Spatial patterns varied across tree size classes in
2001. Trees less than 6 cm dbh occurred in dense
clusters across the stand. With increasing size class,
the patchiness diminished (Fig. 8), with the average
number of trees in a patch decreasing from 21 to 3 in
the 15–25 cm size class (Table 1). There was only
slight clustering in the 25–40 cm size class, which
disappeared entirely from the 40 to 55 cm trees that
were regularly spaced (Fig. 8 and Table 1). A
Poisson model best described trees larger than 55 cm
dbh, which is probably due to the smaller sample
size.
The overall patterns of stand structure did not
change considerably over the 30 years of observation,
though some details of patch structure varied for the
smaller size classes (Table 1). Patches of trees 0–
15 cm in diameter were smaller and denser in 2001
than 1974. Trees 15–25 cm dbh were more strongly
clumped in 2001 than in 1974.

Spatial patterns are clustered (C), random (R), or regular (dispersed,

Neyman–Scott (N) or Poisson (P). Reported point-process models
all had signiﬁcant ﬁt to the data (Cramer–von Mises goodness-of-ﬁt
test; p < 0.05).
a These size classes had inhomogeneous clustered patterns which
violate the assumptions of the Neyman–Scott model and therefore
could not be modeled. This type of pattern is often caused by a
gradient in tree density across a stand.

the upper 95% conﬁdence envelope for a spatially independent

ted at scales from 0 to 30 m, and independent at larger lag
distances.

4. Discussion
4.1. Density, size and age structure
Climate appears to have played a signiﬁcant role in
driving pine establishment and survival in this stand. A
large number of surviving trees appear to have
established in the late 1700s to early 1800s. The
Palmer drought severity index for the region (Cook
et al., 1999; Cook, 2000) indicated that this was also a
period of wet climatic conditions (Fig. 3A). Cooler
temperatures and adequate summer moisture create
opportunities for successful germination and higher
survival
rates
in
pine.
These
were
wet
years
throughout the Great Plains and Front Range, and
abundant establishment during this time period has
been documented in the Southwest and in the Black
Hills, SD (Swetnam and Betancourt, 1998; Mast and
Veblen, 1999; Brown, 2004). The long ﬁre-free
interval from 1774 to 1846 was probably conducive
to higher seedling and sapling survival during this
time. Drought conditions from the 1830s to 1870s may
also have contributed to the 1846 ﬁre (Fig. 3A and B).
A large number of surviving trees also dated to the
1880s and 1890s (based on the germination correction
factor) (Fig. 3B). A pulse in tree establishment has
been clearly observed in other Front Range ponderosa
pine stands during this time period (Veblen and
Lorenz, 1986; Mast et al., 1998; Brown et al., 1999;
Mast and Veblen, 1999), and has been attributed to the
favorable climate, as well as the grazing, logging, and
ﬁre suppression that accompanied Euro-American
settlement of these areas during the late 19th century
(Peet, 1981; Mast et al., 1998). We know that some
selective logging was done in our stand in the 1880s,
and this may have contributed to the successful
recruitment of a cohort of trees. The explosion of new
trees to the stand in the late 20th Century (Fig. 4)
coincided with a very wet climate, following drought
years in the 1950s and 1960s when there appears to
have been little successful establishment, or high
mortality, of trees (Fig. 3A and B). The lack of ﬁre or
other major disturbance in the stand to trigger this
release of trees supports the idea that climate plays a
major role in pine establishment (Mast et al., 1998).
These sorts of highly episodic recruitment events
driven by a combination of climate, ﬁre (although
there is little evidence for that from our limited
reconstruction) and anthropogenic disturbance are
consistent with Southwest (Savage et al., 1996;
Swetnam and Betancourt, 1998) and Front Range
(Mast et al., 1998; Brown et al., 1999; Kaufmann et al.,
2000; Brown, 2004) reconstructions.

4.2. Contemporary patterns of recruitment
From the 1980s to the1990s recruitment in the
stand tripled, and occurred in denser and more
numerous patches (Fig. 4 and Table 1). Regeneration
tended to occur near small established trees (6–15 cm
dbh), and roughly 15–35 m from the largest canopy
trees (>55 cm). Our descriptive study cannot address
the causes of patterns of tree recruitment within the
stand, but we can offer some speculations. Successful
ponderosa pine seedling germination and establish-
ment generally requires a large supply of seed, a
mineral seedbed, sufﬁcient moisture, reduced unders-
tory cover, and light (Larson and Schubert, 1969;
Schubert, 1974; White and Pickett, 1985; Kolb and
Robberecht, 1996; Stein and Kimberling, 2003).
Areas15–30 m from the largest trees may be optimal
for regeneration because these trees are likely to be the
best seed producers, and this distance is still within the
dispersal distance for ponderosa pine (Oliver and
Ryker, 1990), yet is beyond the inﬂuence of the
canopy where shading and heavy litterfall may prevent
successful germination or seedling survival (Coving-
ton and Sackett, 1986; Stein and Kimberling, 2003). A
regression of tree regeneration as a function of litter
depth (data not shown) showed a weak, negative
relationship between litter depth and regeneration
(r2 = 0.16, p < 0.001). We speculate that patches of 6–
15 cm trees may be conducive to establishment since
they provide some degree of shading, which is
important for reducing grass cover as well as
protecting seedlings from moisture stress (Larson
and Schubert, 1969; White and Pickett, 1985; Stein
and Kimberling, 2003), yet are too small to contribute
signiﬁcant amounts of litter to the forest ﬂoor. The
segregation of tree establishment from all other size
classes similarly suggests that new cohorts are
forming in patches that are spatially distinct from
pre-existing clumps or areas of high density, possibly
where competition for light and water is reduced. This
pattern of establishment supports Cooper’s (1960)

scale of the axes differs in (E). In (A)–(D) the plot of the actual data
falls above the upper limit for a Poisson model at some range of
distances, indicating that the data are spatially clumped. In (E) the
plot of the actual data falls below the lower limit for a Poisson
model, indicating that 40–55 cm trees are regularly dispersed at
5–7 m neighbor distances.

description of even-aged patches of ponderosa pine in
Arizona.
Contrary to expectations for gap dynamics, tree
establishment was never associated with areas of high
tree mortality (Table 2). Canopy gaps created by
individual tree mortality may be important for tree
recruitment in shade intolerant species, yet we saw
that areas of higher tree mortality were sometimes less
likely to promote new establishment into the stand. It
is possible that areas of higher tree mortality are also
less conducive to seedling establishment and growth
due to micro-environmental conditions. The fact that
historical recruitment seems strongly inﬂuenced by
climate rather than disturbance also suggests that the
processes of mortality and regeneration in this pon-
derosa pine stand may be temporally uncoupled
processes (Brown, 2004), but both of these theories
need further exploration.
Cattle grazing may also have played a role in pine
recruitment in our stand. Intensive grazing began in
the late 19th Century in the South Platte basin (Jack,
1900), and cattle may have had opposing effects of
increasing seedling mortality (by trampling or occa-
sional browsing) and fostering seedling success by
reducing competing grasses and ﬁne fuels that would
have carried surface ﬁres (Rummell, 1951; Johnson,
1956; Madany and West, 1983; Belsky and Blu-
menthal, 1997).
4.3. Size patterns and mortality
Recruitment was highly clumped across the stand,
but that pattern slowly disappeared from successively
larger size classes as the patches thinned, eventually
becoming random and then regular in the 40–55 cm
trees. We can assume that historical regeneration
patterns were clumped (White and Pickett, 1985; Mast
and Veblen, 1999), which means that the regularity in
the old trees appeared over the past several centuries.
Regular spatial patterns are often taken as an indicator
of competitive self-thinning (Kenkel, 1988; Moeur,
1993; Mast and Wolf, 2004). In truth, any patchy
mortality that leads to thinning of dense, aggregated
stands can result in more regular spacing of the
survivors (Kent and Dress, 1980). Although there are a
number of ways for patchy mortality to occur, ﬁre
probably played a signiﬁcant role in structuring the
current spatial pattern of the large trees since we can
assume that most of them predate the 1846 ﬁre. When
a low intensity surface ﬁre burns through a stand (such
as the 1846 ﬁre) clumps of smaller trees are killed
because they are not yet ﬁre-resistant, leaving larger
trees alive and possibly more regularly spaced as a
result.
It is possible that the regularity in the large trees
was partly caused by the selective thinning in the
1880s. We mapped the locations of all visible stumps
in the stand and determined that they were randomly
spaced. This means that their removal had little to no
impact on the regularity we observed in the current
large canopy trees since random mortality will not
drive a clumped or random pattern towards greater
regularity (Kent and Dress, 1979, 1980).
In the absence of ﬁre in this stand, the question
remains how current mortality patterns compare to
historical ones? Contemporary mortality patterns were
still predominantly patchy (Fig. 7), although the scale
and extent of mortality is likely lower than it was
historically, with ﬁre. There were particularly large
patches of mortality from 1974 to 1983, indicating a
fairly large scale disturbance. Records indicate that an
outbreak of mountain pine beetles caused considerable
mortality in the experimental forest and across the
Front Range in the early 1980s (Shepperd, pers.
communication, McCambridge et al., 1982). Moun-
tain pine beetles infest high density patches of pine
and, depending upon the severity of the outbreak, will
kill some of the trees in the patch, creating more
regularity in the survivors (McCambridge et al., 1982;
Logan et al., 1998). Smaller patches of mortality, like
we documented from 1991 to 2001 and in smaller size
classes from 1974 to 1983, could be a sign of self-
thinning. A binomial logistic regression of trees that
died versus trees that survived from 1983 to 2001
showed no relationship between the probability of
mortality and local tree density (data not shown).
Although this is not a conclusive test, we should
clearly be cautious about inferring ecological pro-
cesses, such as competitive self-thinning, from pattern
alone.
Spatial analysis of regeneration, mortality and size
structure can help us to reconstruct a story of stand
development for this mature ponderosa pine forest.
Climate appears to have had a major inﬂuence,
historically and more currently, on the timing of
recruitment events, with stand structure (distribution
S. Boyden et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 219 (2005) 43–55
52

of patches, light availability, and seed trees) playing a
signiﬁcant role in the pattern of regeneration. The
patchy process of regeneration results in spatial
independence and some segregation of size classes
(data not shown). White (1985) found that ponderosa
pine grew in small groups that ranged from 0.02 to
0.3 ha (8–30 m radius) in size with 3–44 trees per
group. Overall, our data reﬂect very similar patterns
with patch sizes ranging from 9 to 35 m radius, and
anywhere from 1 to 21 trees per patch. The relatively
even ages of trees within a patch, however, is more
consistent with the even-aged mosaic patterns that
Cooper (1960) described for ponderosa pine in
Arizona.
Both the scale and nature of disturbances have
changed in contemporary forests. In the absence of
recent natural wildﬁres in this stand, historically patchy
mortality resulting from tree scorch and crown ﬁres
(Brown et al., 1999; Ehle and Baker, 2003) has been
replaced with mostly random individual tree mortality,
and the potential for smaller patches of mortality
resulting from self-thinning or disturbance events such
as mountain pine beetle outbreaks or drought. These
events probably have a lesser impact on spatial pattern
than historical surface ﬁre, but may still create and
maintain some regular spacing of the older trees as the
stand matures. Despite the loss of ﬁre to this system, the
highly episodic and clumped patterns of regeneration
events, and the spatially and temporally patchy pattern
of mortality, are somewhat consistent with our idea of
pre-European stand structure patterns for the Colorado
Front Range (Peet, 1981; Brown et al., 1999; Mast and
Veblen, 1999; Kaufmann et al., 2000).
