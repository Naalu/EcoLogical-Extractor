ABSTRACT. We compared historical (1909–1913) and contemporary (1997–1999) forest struc-
ture and composition on 15 permanent plots in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex
Laws.) forests of Arizona and New Mexico. We used the same sampling methods as in the early
1900s and compared stand density, diameter distributions, species composition, and broad age
classes from the two periods. Stand density (trees 9.14 cm dbh) significantly (P  0.001)
increased on plots from an average of 77.4 trees per plot (s  49.9) at plot establishment in
1909–1913 to 519.1 trees per plot (s  252.3) at remeasurement in 1997–1999. Basal area
significantly (P  0.001) increased from 8.0 m2 per plot (s  3.5) to 28.5 m2 per plot (s  10.1).
Contemporary tree diameter distribution shifted toward smaller size classes as demonstrated by
a significant (P  0.001) decrease in quadratic mean diameter from 38.5 cm (s  7.5) in
1909–1913 to 28.6 cm (s  7.1) in 1997–1999. Broad age classes yielded an average of 61.5 (s 
49.5) residual live trees classified as “blackjack” ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa 150 years) and
13.3 (s  11.9) “yellow pine” (P. ponderosa 150 years) in 1909–1913. In 1997–1999, 416 live
trees (s  229.6) were “blackjack” and 57.2 (s  28.5) trees on average were “yellow pine.”
Twelve of the 15 plots were not invaded by other tree species (remained pure ponderosa pine
type), while composition shifted slightly on three plots toward more shade-tolerant and fire-in-
tolerant species. Ninety-one percent of the historically (1909–1913 or older) mapped tree struc-
tures (live trees, snags, logs, stumps, etc.) were relocated, which suggested that the forest
reconstruction field techniques are reliable within 10%. Dramatic increases in tree densities may
represent an increased potential for bark beetle epidemics and stand replacing wildfire over
large areas in the Southwest. FOR. SCI. 50(2):162–176.

P
ONDEROSA PINE (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.
var. scopulorum) forest ecosystems of the Southwest
have undergone dramatic changes in forest structure
since Anglo-American and Hispanic settlement of the re-
gion around 1870–1890 (Cooper 1960, Covington and
Moore 1994a, 1994b, Fule´ et al. 1997, Mast et al. 1999).
Structural and functional changes were driven by an irrup-
tion of pine regeneration resulting from disruption of the
frequent, low-intensity fire regime, in addition to livestock
overgrazing and high-grade logging in the late 19th century
(Pearson 1910, Arnold 1950, Cooper 1960, Savage and
Swetnam 1990, Savage 1991, Covington and Moore 1994b,
Swetnam and Baisan 1996). Ecologists and natural resource
professionals generally agree that these changes have and
continue to occur throughout North America’s frequent fire
ecosystems; however, surprisingly little quantitative infor-
mation is available about the magnitude and extent of these
changes (Covington et al. 1994). Some scientists have used
forest reconstruction techniques, which employ dendroeco-
logical analysis of live and dead trees, and report that tree
densities on pine and pine-oak study sites in northern Ari-
zona increased by an estimated two to seven times since
EuroAmerican settlement (Covington and Moore 1994b,
Fule´ et al. 1997, Mast et al. 1999). Similar increases in tree
numbers were reported for forests throughout the south-
western region (Johnson 1994).
A combination of dendroecological and repeat forest
inventory
approaches
is
recommended
for
evaluating
changes of forest structure at annual and decadal scales
(Biondi 1999). In this study, the emphasis is placed on one
repeat measurement from a set of long-term permanent
plots. We relocated and remeasured a subset of the oldest
known forest inventory plots in the American Southwest,
established from 1909–1913 in ponderosa pine forests of
Arizona and New Mexico. Historical records in the US
Forest Service (USFS) Rocky Mountain Research Station
(RMRS)–Fort Valley archives allowed detailed compari-
sons between historical and present-day forest attributes.
Information from historical, permanent plot research pro-
vides valuable data on forest dynamics prior to contempo-
rary management practices and can help describe the natural
range of forest structure (Minnich et al. 1995, Biondi 1996,
Biondi 1999, Kipfmueller and Swetnam 2001). These data
can, in turn, be used to evaluate ecological changes and
guide management prescriptions (Kauffmann et al. 1994,
Morgan et al. 1994, Moore et al. 1999, Landres et al. 1999,
Kipfmueller and Swetnam 2001, Allen et al. 2002).
The main objective of this study was to quantify forest
structural (tree density, size, and age) and compositional
differences on a subset of permanent plots between the
original plot establishment date (1909–1913) and our re-
measurement date (1997–1999). A secondary objective was
to evaluate our ability to relocate and identify structural
evidence (e.g., live trees, stumps, logs, etc.) of historically
mapped trees after 80 years of change, because forest
reconstruction analysis often relies on this information.
Methods
Background
In 1909, T.S. Woolsey, Jr., Assistant District Forester
and Chief of the Office of Silviculture, District 3 (South-
western District now Southwest Region 3), USFS; and G. A.
Pearson, Director, Fort Valley Forest Experiment Station
(Flagstaff, AZ), USFS, drafted a set of instructions that led
to establishment of a network of permanent plots in pon-
derosa pine forests of the Southwest. The need for such a
series of plots on the National Forests was recognized at
least since 1906 because little was known about western
yellow pine (now ponderosa pine) and its management
(Pearson 1910, Woolsey 1911, Woolsey 1912). Between
1909 and 1915, approximately 50 plots ranging in size from
2 to 6 ha were established to evaluate stand growth, com-
mercial potential, and natural regeneration (Woolsey 1911,
Pearson 1923, 1933). An important criterion for plot estab-
lishment included location on areas where a timber sale had
occurred within the last 5 years that followed current (early
1900) National Forest harvest practices. In several cases,
harvesting occurred simultaneously with plot establishment.
Cutting followed the general practice in the National Forests
in which one-third of the merchantable volume was left,
mainly in the form of immature trees (Pearson 1933). “So-
called sample plots were established on logged over areas to
ascertain how fast residual stands would grow, whether they
could produce merchantable timber, and whether natural
restocking would take place” (Pearson 1933). Five plots
were also logged by private companies to various degrees
between 1890 and 1900, which predated the establishment
of USFS National Forests (Table 1).
All live conifers of 9.14 cm (3.6 in.) diameter at breast
height (dbh; 1.37 m or 4.5 ft) were measured and their
spatial locations on the plots were recorded (stem-mapped).
Data were recorded only for commercially valuable conifers
in the early 1900s, although other species occurred on the
site. Other data recorded included species, age class, height,
diameter, and condition class. Additionally, location and
diameter of standing dead trees, logs, and cut stumps were
recorded on several plots.
Study Area
The study area included the network of 50 permanent
plots on the National Forests of Arizona and New Mexico
(USFS Southwestern Region; now USFS Region 3) (Figure
1). Between 1997 and 1999, we used historical descriptions
of plot locations and searched these areas for original tree
tags and monumented plot corners. Out of 27 plots we were
able to relocate by 1999, we selected a subset for remea-
surement. Criteria used for selecting plots were: (1) histor-
ical stem map (tree locations) existed, (2) overstory trees
were historically dominated by ponderosa pine (70% of
the plot basal area (BA)), and (3) in cases of extreme
disturbance (e.g., roads, urban development, etc.) that a
minimally disturbed 1.01-ha subplot could be captured. We
accepted plots that had received a precommercial or selec-
tive thin or light surface fire. We identified 15 plots that met
all criteria. Plot locations, descriptions, and disturbance

(primarily cutting) history are listed in Table 1. The Arizona
plots (COC prefix) examined in this study fall within the
Colorado Plateau physiographic region, while the New
Mexico plots fall within two physiographic regions, the
southern tip of Southern Rocky Mountains (JEM plots), and
Basin and Range (GILA). The CIB plots, located southwest
of Magdelena, NM, lie in an interesting transition zone
between the Colorado Plateau to the north and the Basin and
Range to the South (Chronic 1987). The plots examined in
this study represented six ponderosa pine habitat types of
the Southwest (Moir 2000).
Field Measurements
We used survey and forest inventory methods originally
employed at plot establishment in the early 1900s. Histori-
cal stem maps were used to precisely reestablish the original
plot layout of continuous 1 chain by 1 chain quadrats (0.04
ha or 0.10 ac; Figure 2). Most of the original plot corners
and many of the interior markers were evident and aided in
plot reestablishment. To achieve our secondary objective
without bias, the historical maps were not consulted again
until contemporary measurements were completed. This
allowed us to test our ability to locate and identify structural
evidence of the former stand after 80 years of change.
Because the original plots ranged in size from 2.0 to 6.1
ha, we standardized remeasurement by delineating one
1.01-ha (2.5-ac) subplot within each historical plot. Each
subplot was subdivided into 25 grid cells, each cell was 1
square chain (20.1  20.1 m; 0.10 acre; or 66 ft on the side),
which duplicated the original plot layout and facilitated
remeasurement. The 1.01-ha subplot will hereafter be re-
ferred to as “plot.” An area of 1.01 ha: (1) ensured that
presettlement ponderosa pine tree groups (0.1–0.3 ha in
size; White 1985) were captured in the data, (2) reduced
edge effect, thereby minimizing problems of comparisons
with the historically mapped data, and (3) allowed remea-
surement of a relatively large unit within time and funding
constraints. For consistency, the northwest corner of the
original plot was randomly selected as the origin for estab-
lishment of each contemporary plot. If this corner was
disturbed, then alternate origins were selected by progress-
ing clockwise to successive corners of the same plot.
Grid cells within each 1.01-ha plot were searched and all
evidence of living or dead tree structures, either presently or
at some past time reaching at least 1.37 m height, were
numbered and tagged. Structures included live trees, snags,
logs, stumps, and stump holes. Dbh and condition class
(1–9; see below) were recorded for all structures. Diameters
were measured at dbh to the nearest tenth of an inch with a
diameter tape and then converted to metric units. If the
original tree tag still existed, however, we measured diam-
eter at the nail and tag.

Trees were cored at 40 cm above ground level to deter-
mine tree age. Ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga
menziesii var. glauca (Beissn.) Franco), white fir (Abies
concolor Gord. & Glend.), limber pine (Pinus flexilis
James), or southwestern white pine (Pinus strobiformis En-
gelm.) with dbh  37 cm or ponderosa pine of any size with
yellowed bark (White 1985, Mast et al. 1999) were consid-
ered potentially presettlement trees or at least established at
the time of original plot establishment. All living potentially
presettlement or original plot establishment trees were cored
for determination of age and past size. Trees that established
after the original plot establishment date were randomly
sampled at a sampling rate that averaged 20%.
Tree condition classes followed a classification system
commonly used in ponderosa pine forests (Maser et al.
1979, Thomas et al. 1979). The nine classes were: (1) live,

snag, (6) snag broken above breast height, (7) snag broken
below breast height, (8) dead and down, and (9) cut stump.
Definitions
To make the best comparisons possible with the histor-
ical data, tree structures were classified into broad age
classes (Table 2). We used the descriptions provided by
White (1985) to classify trees as postsettlement and pre-
settlement in origin. These classifications were thought to
correspond well with Woolsey’s (1911) description of trees
as “blackjack” and “yellow pine,” respectively. Woolsey
(1911) wrote, “Blackjack is merely the form which yellow
pine assumes before it reaches 125 or 150 years, during
which period its bark is dark red-brown or blackish, with
narrow furrows, in strong contrast to the lighter, widely
furrowed bark of mature trees.”
Location of Historically Measured Trees
When remeasurement was completed, we used the orig-
inal maps to systematically visit the location of each his-
torically measured tree and evaluate our success in locating
these same trees after 80–90 years. We identified histori-
cally measured trees on the basis of their mapped locations
in conjunction with the bark characteristics, sizes of trees,
and presence of historical tree tags. Historically measured
trees that were missed during remeasurement were recorded
and notes were made regarding tree attributes (historical and
current) or condition class (e.g., live, dead and down, no
evidence). Hereafter, these trees are labeled “missing.”
Analyses
To describe structural changes that had occurred on the
plots since their original establishment, comparisons were
made using paired t-tests (P  0.05) for data collected at
plot establishment (1909–1913) and those collected during
remeasurement (1997–1999). All tests were conducted on
log-transformed (ln) data. Means and standard deviations in
tables and figures, however, are raw data. Parameters ana-
lyzed were: (1) mean number of trees per 1.01-ha plot, (2)
BA (m2 per 1.01-ha plot) for all conifers 9.14 cm dbh, and
(3) quadratic mean diameter (QMD). Numbers of standing
dead trees, dead and down, and cut stumps were compared
on plots where these data had been recorded historically.
Diameter and age class distributions were summarized by
number of trees per plot. Conifer species composition and
broad age classes were summarized by number of trees and
BA per plot. Standard deviations (s) are given as a measure
of mean variability because plot locations were not histor-
ically chosen at random and thus it is not clear whether they
represented general conditions of ponderosa pine forests in
the early 1900s. Linear regression was used to test (P 
0.05) relationships between number of trees measured on
the plots in 1909–1913 and the number of missing trees at
plot remeasurement.
Results
Structure and Composition on Plots in 1909–1913
Number of live trees 9.14 cm dbh on all plots at
establishment (1909–1913) averaged 77 (s  49.9) and
ranged from 20 to 222 (Table 3). On the plots (n  12) that
were a “pure” ponderosa pine forest type in the early 1900s,
the number of trees averaged 65 trees per plot (s  31.4)
and ranged from 20 to 125 (Table 4). Mean BA and QMD
for all plots in 1909–1913 were 8.0 m2 per plot (s  3.5)
and 38.5 cm (s  7.5), respectively (Table 3). While on the
plots that were “pure” ponderosa pine, the mean BA per plot
and QMD were 7.9 m2 per plot (s  3.3) and 40.8 cm (s 
6.5), respectively in the early 1900s (Table 4). For plots
where dead tree structures were historically recorded, num-
ber of standing dead (n  10 plots), dead and down trees
(n  8 plots), and cut stumps (n  11 plots) averaged 5.8
(s  4.2), 6.8 (s  5.8), and 30.1 (s  10.7) per plot,
respectively, in 1909–1913 (Table 3).

Diameter (dbh  9.14 cm) distributions at time of plot
establishment varied, but generally were regularly distrib-
uted in all diameter classes (Figure 3). All plots had diam-
eter distributions that are similar to those of multicohort
stands (Oliver and Larson 1996). Several plots (esp.
COCS1B) were missing or had low establishment in the
smallest diameter classes in 1909–1913. COCS5A2 was

harvest was applied to this latter plot when it was estab-
lished in 1913, where all trees 27.9 cm were harvested,
and a few scattered large trees were left as seed trees
(Krauch 1926).
Conifer
(9.14
cm
dbh)
species
composition
in
1909–1913 was essentially dominated by ponderosa pine,
which comprised 96% of the BA on all plots (Table 4).
“Blackjack” ponderosa pine (trees 150 years of age in
1909–1913; Woolsey 1911) was 71% (s  23.1) of the
overstory BA per plot across the plots on average, whereas
“yellow pine” (ponderosa pine trees 150 years of age in
1909–1913) comprised 26% (s  21.1), on average (Table
5). Douglas-fir comprised 11%, 31%, and 2% of the respec-
tive overstory BA per plot on the three plots where it
occurred (CIBS1A, GILAS1A, and JEMS3A) in the early
1900s. Southwestern white pine was 18% and 2% of the
overstory BA per plot on CIBS1A and GILAS1A, respec-
tively. Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt.) and juniper
(Juniperus spp.) occurred on several plots, but data on these
noncommercial
tree
species
were
not
recorded
in
1909–1913.
Structure and Composition on Plots in 1997–1999
Average number of trees across plots was significantly
different (t  6.79; P  0.001) between time of establish-
ment and remeasurement. Average density of live trees
(9.14 cm dbh) on plots at remeasurement (1997–1999)
was 519 trees per plot (s  252.3) and ranged from 91 to
928 trees per plot (healthy and fading condition classes
combined) (Table 3). On average, this represented more
than a sixfold increase in tree density. Nine plots remained
ponderosa pine (had no other tree species invasion) since
1909–1913, and the average density of live trees on these
“pure” pine plots in 1997–1999 was 511 (s  295.7) and
ranged from 91 to 928 trees per plot (same as all plots;
Tables 3 and 4). The tree density did not change drastically
on two ponderosa pine plots (COCS4A and COCS4B) that
were located on dry sites with coarse, cinder soils.
As expected, the mean BA per plot of 28.5 m2 (s  10.1)
was significantly higher (t  7.57; P  0.001) at remea-
surement than at plot establishment (Table 3). Increased BA
was observed on all plots and ranged from 1.5- to 37.1-fold
since plot establishment with an average increase of
6.7-fold. Basal area of plots that were “pure” ponderosa
pine in 1909–1913 and remained ponderosa pine in
1997–1999 averaged 29.7 m2 (s  11.1) in the 1990s,
slightly higher than plots with other conifer species.
Quadratic mean diameter (QMD) was significantly lower
(t  3.95; P  0.001) at remeasurement than at time of plot
establishment (Table 3). Mean QMD across all plots aver-
aged 28.6 cm (s  7.1) at remeasurement and had decreased
by approximately 8.0 cm across 10 of the 15 plots since plot
establishment. On plots that remained “pure” ponderosa
pine in 1997–1999, the average QMD at remeasurement
was 30.6 cm (s  8.3), a slightly larger QMD at remea-
surement than plots with other conifer species. On plots
COCS4A and COCS4B, the plots on cinder soils, the QMD
actually increased between original plot establishment and
remeasurement date.
Number of standing dead, dead and down, and cut
stumps averaged 31.1 (s  37.6), 88.5 (s  78.2), and 112.0
(s  151.5) per plot, respectively (Table 3). Significantly
more standing dead trees (t  3.17; P  0.011), dead and
down (t  7.80; P  0.001), and cut stumps (t  2.96; P 
0.014) occurred on plots at remeasurement than at plot

establishment, as 12 of the 15 plots received some type of
silvicultural treatment between these two periods. Treat-
ments included precommercial thinning or thinning from
below that took place as early as 1939 (COCS3A and
COCS3B; Pearson and Wadsworth 1941), but mostly
between 1950 and 1970 (Pearson 1950, Schubert 1974)
(Table I).
Diameter (dbh  9.14 cm) distributions at time of re-
measurement were generally left-skewed from average and
dominated by large numbers of small diameter trees (Figure
3). The number of small diameter trees (14.0–22.0 cm)
ranged up to 500 times greater at remeasurement than the
number
recorded
at
plot
establishment.
Two
plots
(COCS4A and COCS4B) had distributions that appeared
more bell-shaped in 1997–1999 and lacked large numbers
of trees in the small diameter classes. Similar to time of plot
establishment, few (1.6 trees per plot) very large (75 cm
dbh) trees existed at time of remeasurement.
Conifer species composition at remeasurement was sim-
ilar to that recorded at plot establishment for pure ponderosa
pine plots (Table 4). On the three plots where Douglas-fir
was originally (1909–1913) measured, the relative propor-
tion of BA increased and was 4.0–37.1% at remeasurement
(1997–1999). At remeasurement, southwestern white pine
was 9.7% of total BA on GILAS1A, but only 3.7% of BA
on CIBS1A. White fir was not recorded on plots GILAS1A
and JEMS3A in 1911–12, but it was found there in
1997–1999, where it comprised 1.0 and 2.6% of the total
BA per plot, respectively.
Forest age distributions at each plot were multiaged and
generally dominated by trees that established from around
1920 (the 1917–1919 seed crops are included here) until
around 1960 (Figure 4). “Blackjack” pine (P. ponderosa
150 years of age in 1997–1999) increased from an aver-
age of 62 residual trees (s  49.5) and 5.7 m2 (s  3.3) of
BA per plot at time of plot establishment to 416 trees (s 
229.6) and 16.6 m2 (s  7.9) of BA at remeasurement
(Table 5). Similarly, number of “yellow pine” (P. pon-
derosa 150 years of age) trees and BA increased from an
average of 13 residual trees (s  11.9) and 2.1 m2 (s  2.1)
of BA per plot at time of plot establishment to an average of
57 trees (s  28.5) and 10.3 m2 (s  5.1) of BA at
remeasurement. Because these plots were either logged in
the late 1800s or at plot establishment, these age distribu-
tions are not a complete record of old trees. In addition,
some plots received precommercial thinning between 1940s
and 1970s, so the age distributions (Figure 4) also did not
include the trees that established (or became ingrowth) and
then were cut during this time period. Lastly, the ages were
based on cores taken at 40 cm from ground level and it may
take these tree species from 11 to 21 years to reach that
coring height (ponderosa pine may take 3–5 years in open
conditions; 11–17 years at higher elevations) (Heinlein
1996).
Field Identification of Historically Measured Trees
Successful identification of historical trees was possible
at the time of remeasurement (1997–1999). During the
remeasurement period, we relocated 91% (1060 of 1161) of
the total trees historically measured on all plots. Success at
relocating these trees ranged 81–100% on individual plots.
Live trees in 1909–1913 were found in all structural con-
dition classes from live trees still bearing original tags to
highly decomposed materials evidenced mainly by forest
floor depressions (i.e., stump holes) in 1997–1999.
On average, 6.7 trees (range 0–33) per plot were not
identified (“missing”) during the remeasurement across the
15 plots. We found a significant positive relationship be-
tween the number of missing trees and the number histori-
cally measured (Figure 5). Fewer trees were missing on the
Arizona plots (mean  3.2, range 0–9) than on the New
Mexico plots (mean  13.9, range 1–33). Trees that were
missing during the 1997–1999 remeasurement tended to
have been small at time of plot establishment; ledger data
indicated that 83% of the missing trees were less than 30.0
cm dbh in 1909–1913 (ledger data located at Fort Valley
Archives, USFS-RMRS). Additionally, periodic remeasure-
ments through the 1950s showed that 52% of the missing
trees died between 1915 and 1940. The greatest number of
missing trees (33 trees) was on plot JEMS3A, which had a
surface fire in 1977.
Discussion
Current structure and species composition of southwest-
ern ponderosa pine forests reveal much about stand history
and provide critical information for silvicultural prescrip-
tions and restoration projects. Just as the contemporary
forest structure is a product of its past, the structural char-
acteristics of the 1909–1913 forest were also the result of
stands substantially altered from 30–40 years of fire exclu-
sion and livestock overgrazing, and 15–20 years of high-
grade logging (Pearson 1910, Arnold 1950, Cooper 1960,
Savage 1991, Covington et al. 1997, Moore et al. 1999,
Allen et al. 2002). Fire scar studies in southwestern pon-
derosa pine forests have shown that disruption of the long-
term frequent, low-intensity, surface fire regime in Arizona
and New Mexico occurred between 1870 and 1900 (Diet-
erich and Swetnam 1984, Swetnam and Dieterich 1985,
Swetnam and Baisan 1996, Touchan et al. 1996, Fule´ et al.
1997). Intense livestock grazing, associated with Anglo-
American and Hispanic settlement of the region, reduced
cover of herbaceous understory communities, which carried
surface fires (Cooper 1960, Dieterich and Swetnam 1984,
Savage and Swetnam 1990, Covington and Moore 1994a,
Swetnam and Baisan 1996, Fule´ et al. 1997) and also
inhibited tree seedling establishment (Pearson 1923, Pear-
son 1942, Arnold 1950). High-grade logging occurred over
most of the accessible forestlands in the Southwest during
the 1870s and 1880s when the construction of the transcon-
tinental railroad began and demands for railroad ties and
bridge timbers were high (Pearson 1910, Pearson and Marsh
1935, Pearson 1950, Cooper 1960, Schubert 1974). Thus,
structural attributes of stands at the time of original plot
establishment (1909–1913) reflect conditions associated
with anthropogenic disturbances and do not represent pre-
settlement forests. Our results demonstrated a significant

difference in postsettlement forest structure on our perma-
nent plots between the early 1900s and 1997–1999.
Structure on Plots in 1909–1913
In general, the residual tree densities on our permanent
plots in 1909–1913 were comparable with those reported in
the literature. Selection cuts on our plots resulted in residual
stand densities that averaged around 77 trees per plot (77
trees per ha) for both Arizona and New Mexico. In Arizona,
Krauch (1926) reported an average of 46 residual trees per
hectare (range 22–72) in 1909–1913 after partial cutting on
much larger “extensive” plots (the extensive plots ranged
from 45 to 185 ha in size and contained the smaller inten-
sive plots that were the focus of this study). Our Arizona
plots averaged 56 residual trees per 1.01-ha plot (56 trees
per ha), slightly higher than the densities reported by
Krauch (1926).
The New Mexico plots were generally located at higher
elevations and were compositionally more diverse than the
Arizona plots. Pearson (1944) also noted that the New
Mexico ponderosa pine stands are “conducive to lighter
volumes per acre, smaller trees, and better reproduction than
prevail in Arizona.” In New Mexico, our residual tree
densities for five plots averaged 120 trees per plot (range
59–222). Pearson (1944) reported an average of 170 resid-
ual trees per ha (range 83–408) in 11 stands in ponderosa
pine plots of New Mexico in the early 1900s. Four of our
New Mexico plots were subplots taken from the exact
locations as data reported by Pearson (1944) (CIBS1A,
CIBS2A, JEMS2A, JEMS3A), where he reported 124 trees
per ha (range 86–160), and we obtained 135 residual trees
per plot (135 trees per ha; range 89–222).
The harvests in the late 1800s and early 1900s also
resulted in residual stands of smaller and probably younger
trees. Wadsworth (1943) reported, for a stand of ponderosa
pine on the Fort Valley Experimental Forest near Flagstaff,
AZ, an average of 30 “blackjack pine” trees per ha (150
years; Woolsey 1911) and 4 “yellow pine” trees (150
years) per ha on average in a stand harvested in 1925 (trees
30.5 cm). This harvest resulted in a stand where 89% of
the trees were less than 150 years of age. Pearson and
Wadsworth (1941) reported that 93% of the residual trees
were in the immature or “blackjack” age classes after har-
vest in northern Arizona. Using the same broad age classes,
our plots from across Arizona and New Mexico yielded an
average of 62 (s  49.5) residual live trees per 1.01-ha plot
classified as “blackjack” and 13 residual trees per plot (s 
11.9) classified as “yellow pine” in 1909–1913.
To determine the impact of tree harvest on stand struc-
ture in the early 1900s and understand how this type of
disturbance influenced the forest structure we see today, it is
helpful to investigate uncut stands that existed at the same
time our plots were established. Needless to say, very few
uncut stands exist in contemporary times, but Wadsworth
and Pearson (1943) compared the number of trees and
volume of a cutover stand (65 ha) with an adjoining uncut
stand (65 ha, the Gus Pearson Natural Area (GPNA); Avery
et al. 1976, Biondi 1996) of ponderosa pine in northern
Arizona in the early 1900s. Trees per ha were approximately
49 and 54 (all trees dbh 9.14 cm) for the cutover stand and
the uncut stand, respectively. They noted that the total
number of residual trees was only slightly less in the cutover
stand than the unharvested stand, and said that, “cutting
noticeably lowered the number of trees 18 inches [45.7 cm]
d.b.h. and over, but as it happens the cut-over area originally
had a larger number of trees below 18 inches, which almost
offsets the loss in higher diameter classes” (Wadsworth and
Pearson 1943). Although the number of trees was compa-
rable between the cutover and uncut stand, the changes in
the diameter distribution and volume of the cutover stand
were very pronounced. The two stands began with similar
volume, yet when the cutover stand was harvested (1915),
approximately 69% of the volume was removed. Broad age
class comparisons were also included for trees 30.5 cm
dbh, with approximately 30 and 4 trees per ha remaining for
“blackjack” and “yellow pine,” respectively, in the cutover
stand, while the adjacent uncut stand contained approxi-
mately 23 and 26 trees per ha for “blackjack” and “yellow
pine,” respectively. These results suggest that approxi-
mately 22 trees per ha of trees 150 years old were re-
moved from harvested sites in northern Arizona in the early
1900s. These trees were most likely the large, commercially
valuable yellow pine that dominated presettlement pon-
derosa pine forest structure in the Southwest (Woolsey
1911, White 1985).
In our study, we obtained a reasonable estimate of pre-
harvest tree density and BA in Arizona and New Mexico by
adding the number and size of older cut stumps to the living
tree data of 1909–1913: (1) based on the number of stumps
recorded on plots at establishment compared with numbers
of live trees, an average of 35% (range 15–62%) of the trees

field during remeasurement (1997–1999) and the number of
trees originally measured (1909–1913) on permanent plots in

were removed by the initial harvests; and (2) from the size
of these stumps, we estimated that an average of 7.8 m2 per
plot (range 2.9–12.4) of BA was removed with these cuts.
Therefore, the approximate average tree density on our 15
1.01-ha plots in Arizona and New Mexico in the absence of
harvest was 101 trees per plot (s  59.3), while the approx-
imate average BA was 15.8 m2. We did not reconstruct the
plot structure in 1909–1913, nor could we account for
mortality in this study (for instance, it was a common Forest
Service practice to fell all snags immediately after cutting in
the early 1900s (Pearson 1939)).
Structure and Composition on Plots in 1997–1999
Comparing our remeasurement data with the historical
records of the same plots allowed us to document differ-
ences between the number of residual trees per area, BA,
diameter and age distributions, and species composition
between the early 1900s and the late 1900s. Differences in
forest structure between these two points in time were
striking. Compared with conditions at plot establishment in
1997–1999, most plots had high stem densities despite
precommercial and selective thinning that occurred several
decades prior to remeasurement.
Our contemporary plot densities and BAs are compara-
ble to other studies conducted in northern Arizona. Coving-
ton et al. (1997) estimated tree densities (trees 10.2 cm
dbh) of 762 trees per ha in 1992 on an unharvested site
(GPNA) near Flagstaff, AZ. Fule´ et al. (1997) estimated
density (trees 2.54 cm dbh) and BA of ponderosa pine to
be 720 trees per ha and 18.2 m2 BA in 1994–1995 on a site
near Bellemont, AZ. In general, our results show a trend
toward higher numbers of smaller trees on all plots in
Arizona and New Mexico. There were site differences,
however, as indicated by two of our plots, COCS4A and
COCS4B, which did not change as drastically over this 80-
to 90-year period. The tree density and BA on these plots
rose slightly, and QMD actually increased from 1909 to
1999. These plots were located at slightly lower elevations
and on dry cinder soils, which are considered harsh sites for
tree recruitment. Harsh sites often have low tree recruit-
ment, but also lower density-dependent mortality (Oliver
and Larson 1996).
We attribute the greater number of trees in the late 1900s
to large pulses in tree establishment over an 80- to 90-year
period. The unusual magnitude of the 1919 pine regenera-
tion pulse across the Colorado Plateau has been discussed
elsewhere (Pearson 1950, Arnold 1950, Schubert 1974,
White 1985, Biondi 1996, Savage et al. 1996). Savage et al.
(1996) found 73 of 166 trees (44%) sampled on a site near
our Arizona plots had germination dates of 1919. We also
noticed a large pulse in tree recruitment in the 1920–1940
establishment class. This class also included 1918, 1921,
1927, 1929, 1931, 1936, and 1937, also years of good
regeneration in northern Arizona (Pearson 1950, Schubert
1974). Many Arizona plots also showed large pulses of
recruitment in 1900–1920 and 1940–1960 establishment
classes. Recruitment into the 9.14-cm diameter class ended
in 1960–1980 on 11 of our 15 plots.
Five of our plots had trace amounts or no tree recruit-
ment in establishment classes from 1840 until around 1920.
Many factors could be responsible for this lack of regener-
ation including climate, surface fire, browsing, soil type,
and harvesting (we only sampled live trees and did not
account for age of cut stumps) (Harcombe 1986, Johnson et
al. 1994, Oliver and Larson 1996, Mast et al. 1999). Pearson
(1933) also noticed a lack of regeneration on COCS3A and
COCS3B, and stated that in 1909, “seedlings and saplings
below 20 years of age [established after 1889] were almost
entirely absent and the number below 60 years [established
after 1849] were relatively small.” In the years following
plot establishment, the rate of pine regeneration was de-
scribed as “slow” even though the plots were fenced from
livestock grazing (Pearson 1933). But by 1933, Pearson
described these plots as “adequately stocked” and he attrib-
uted most seedling and sapling establishment to an extraor-
dinary regeneration pulse in 1919.
The broad age classes for ponderosa pine also differed
from the early 1900s to the late 1900s. “Blackjack” and
“yellow pine” densities increased between the two measure-
ment dates. Compared with plot establishment conditions,
plots in 1997–1999 were dominated by a greater number of
younger trees, but there were also a greater number of older
trees (150 years) as well.
Species composition remained similar from time of es-
tablishment to remeasurement for most plots. However,
three plots showed an increase in basal area of the more
shade-tolerant species, Douglas-fir and/or white fir. These
plots were located above 2,600 m elevation, which was high
relative to other plots, and shade-tolerant species were
present at time of establishment. Similar compositional
changes have been documented for ponderosa pine-domi-
nated stands on moist and high-elevation sites in other
regions (Weaver 1961, Stein 1988, Minnich et al. 1995,
Fule´ et al. 2002). These changes represent a potential for
type conversion from forest communities dominated by
fire-resistant trees to those supporting denser populations of
shade-tolerant, fire-sensitive species since Anglo-American
and Hispanic settlement.
Relocation of Historical Tree Structures
Location of forest structural evidence allows spatial pat-
terns of presettlement stands to be emulated during resto-
ration activities (Covington et al. 1997) by leaving younger
trees in spatial locations close to individual presettlement
trees or tree groups that have died or been cut. Tree struc-
tural remains are also important in forest reconstruction to
determine fire history, and tree sizes and density of former
stands (Fule´ et al. 1997, Mast et al. 1999), or to determine
the effects of partial cutting on tree composition and stand
growth (Deal and Tappeiner 2002). A potential source of
error in stand reconstruction approaches, however, is a
failure to recognize the evidence of former tree structures or
locations in the field (e.g., snags, stumps, down logs, stump
hole, etc.), which would lead to an underestimate of former
stand or presettlement tree densities (Fule´ et al. 1997, Mast
et al. 1999). Our results demonstrated that most structures

from trees that were alive in 1909–1913 were readily iden-
tified during remeasurement approximately 80–90 years
later. The mean percentage of missing trees per plot (7%)
appeared to remain constant across the plots as the number
of trees originally on the plot was correlated with the
number of trees not found during the remeasurement. Fac-
tors that appear to affect identification of historical tree
structures on other sites include disturbance such as a sur-
face fires, plots located at more mesic sites or higher ele-
vations, and experience level of field personnel.
Forest Reconstruction on Permanent Plots
The forest structure of southwestern ponderosa pine re-
sembles multiaged or multicohort forests—especially in
Arizona (sensu Oliver and Larson 1996), whose regenera-
tion comes in pulses when favorable climate, seedbed, and
seed year are simultaneous (Pearson 1923, Pearson 1950,
Schubert 1974, White 1985, Mast et al. 1999). Clear stages
of postsettlement stand development are difficult to discern
from this study, however, because we only compared two
sampling periods. Forest stand reconstruction using dendro-
chronological techniques, together with repeated forest in-
ventory data, should include residual stand information
(e.g., data used in this study), plus cut trees (estimated in
this study), ingrowth, and mortality to develop a precise
picture of stand development. Only when these data are
included in the estimates can we determine the stand dy-
namics over this 80- to 90-year time period, more precisely
estimate presettlement forest structure before fire exclusion,
overgrazing, and high-grade logging in the late 1800s, and
eventually project future stand development scenarios.
Ecological Implications
The dramatic increases in stand density and BA over the
last 80–90 years, such as those we found in the majority of
our long-term permanent plots, represent an increased sus-
ceptibility for bark beetle epidemics (Schmid and Mata
1992) and stand-replacing wildfire (Covington et al. 1994,
Fule´ et al. 1997). Ecological consequences of fire exclusion
and massive irruption of ponderosa pine regeneration have
been previously discussed for southwestern ponderosa pine
forests (Covington and Moore 1994a, Kolb et al. 1994,
Covington et al. 1994, Covington et al. 1997, Allen et al.
2002). In fact, four of the 15 plots examined in this study
were eventually affected to varying degrees by the large
wildfires that occurred in Arizona and New Mexico during
the summer of 2000; mortality of overstory trees was near
100% for COCS3B and 68% for JEMS2A (Moore et al.,
unpublished data).
Changes from historically more open to relatively
closed-canopied forest structure today have also reduced
cover and diversity of understory plant communities in
these ecosystems (Covington and Moore 1994a). Nutrient
cycling has also been affected by the exclusion of frequent,
low-intensity fire and increased stand density (Covington
and Sackett 1990, Kaye and Hart 1998). Relatively large
inputs of decay-resistant plant litter and lack of mineraliza-
tion by fire or microbial activity reduce nutrient availability
in soils beneath denser stands. Thus, the dense stand con-
ditions we found on many plots in the late 1990s are
characteristic of forests that fail to meet several forest health
criteria suggested by Kolb et al. (1994). The information
gleaned from these historical plots on logging intensity and
initial stand conditions, however, will help us better under-
stand the structure and dynamics of the contemporary for-
ests we have inherited, and how to better manage or restore
them. In response to these potentially unsustainable condi-
tions, ecological restoration experiments aimed at reestab-
lishing structural characteristics and processes are underway
in ponderosa pine forests in various locations of northern
Arizona (Covington et al. 1997, Moore et al. 1999).
