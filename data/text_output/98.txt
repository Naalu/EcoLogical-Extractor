TREE THINNING AND PRESCRIBED BURNING EFFECTS ON GROUND FLORA IN
ARIZONA PONDEROSA PINE FORESTS: A REVIEW
SCOTT R. ABELLA, Ecological Restoration Institute, Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, AZ 86011-5017
ABSTRACT
Ground flora is an important response variable to monitor after tree thinning and prescribed burning treatments de-
signed to restore Arizona ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P.& C. Lawson) forests. This paper reviews published liter-
ature on the effects of thinning and burning on ground flora in Arizona ponderosa pine forests in five main categories
of research: ground flora biomass, species diversity, plant community composition, population processes, and individual
species ecology. Research published to date suggests that thinning and burning generally increase ground flora biomass,
whereas other categories of research such as community composition and population processes have been little studied
in Arizona ponderosa pine forests. Additional research needs include determining the relative importance of soil seed
banks, seed dispersal, and site conditions in post-treatment ground flora compositional dynamics using a demographic
approach; developing predictive models for exotic species distribution and containment; monitoring long-term (>5 years)
treatment effects; and geographically replicating experiments at dispersed sites differing in ecological conditions to deter-
mine the spatial and contextual applicability of research findings. To meet desired outcomes of ecological restoration
including criteria for high native and low exotic species diversity, treatments supplementary to thinning and burning such
as seeding of native species and life-history specific control methods of exotic species might be needed on some restora-
tion sites.
INTRODUCTION
As ecological restoration, including tree thin-
ning and prescribed burning, is increasingly pro-
posed and implemented to reverse undesirable
changes in Arizona ponderosa pine (Pinus ponder-
osa P.& C. Lawson) forests, a review of thinning
and burning effects on ground flora in ponderosa
pine forests is timely. Similar to many other savanna
and open-forest ecosystems, including longleaf pine
(Pinus palustris P. Mill.) savannas in the south-
eastern United States and oak (Quercus) woodlands
in southern Arizona (McClaran and McPherson
1999, Platt 1999), ground flora is a dominant com-
ponent of open-structured ponderosa pine ecosys-
tems (Weaver 1951, Cooper 1960, Ffolliott 1983).
Ground flora is a critical response variable for mon-
itoring the effects of treatments during ponderosa
pine forest restoration experiments.
Restoration is proposed for many Arizona pon-
derosa pine forests because over the past century
there have been dramatic ecosystem changes in-
creasingly expressed as destructive crown fires
(Covington et al. 1994, Allen et al. 2002). Based on
historical accounts and tree density reconstructions,
presettlement (ca. 1880) ponderosa pine forests
were generally less dense and more open-structured
than current forests (Cooper 1960, Biswell 1972).
Low-intensity but frequent fires (often multiple fires
per decade on a site) historically were key processes
in these ecosystems (Fulé et al. 1997). After settle-
ment in the late 1800s, fire exclusion and other fac-
tors resulted in overall increases in tree densities
(Cooper 1960, Biswell et al. 1973, Wright 1978).
These higher tree densities combined with livestock
overgrazing and fire exclusion were associated with
declines in ground flora cover during the 1900s (Ar-
nold 1950, Moir 1966). Fuel buildups and concerns
about crown fires, which apparently were rare or
absent in presettlement ponderosa pine forests, have
provided impetus to reduce small-diameter (<40 cm)
tree densities using restoration thinning and pre-
scribed burning (Covington et al. 1997, Allen et al.
2002, Fulé et al. 2002).  
Understanding ground flora responses to thin-
ning and burning is fundamental to better compre-
hend the ecology of ponderosa pine ecosystems, and
is of practical importance for predicting vegetation
changes after treatments to improve outcomes of
ecological restoration. This paper reviews mechan-
ical tree thinning and prescribed burning effects on
ground flora in five main categories of research that
have been conducted in Arizona ponderosa pine for-
ests: above-ground vegetation biomass (dry weight/
unit area), species diversity (species richness or di-
versity indices), community composition (species
present and their abundances), population processes
(e.g., seed production and seed bank ecology), and
the ecology of individual species.  Based on pub-
lished literature, I evaluate the null hypothesis that
thinning and burning do not change ground flora
measures such as species diversity or composition.
I also identify areas in need of additional research
and provide suggestions to improve ground flora
research methods.

DESCRIPTION OF THE LITERATURE
Arizona forests dominated by ponderosa
pine occur discontinuously and are concentrated
in north-central and eastern Arizona (Fig. 1).
Most ground flora research in Arizona ponder-
osa pine has occurred in northern Arizona in the
Coconino National Forest near Flagstaff and in
the Grand Canyon area. In evaluating thinning
and burning effects on ground flora biomass and
diversity, some authors stratified study sites into
different categories (e.g., overstory character-
istics, treatment intensities) and occasionally for
biomass data presented results for different sam-
pling dates within a year (e.g., early and late
summer). To develop overall summary tables of
published findings for this review, I averaged
results for overstory and treatment categories and
for seasonal sampling dates within treatments.
VEGETATION BIOMASS
Ground flora standing crop biomass has gener-
ally increased after thinning or burning in Arizona
ponderosa pine forests, but inference could be im-
proved in many studies by collecting pre-treatment
data and repeated temporal measurements (Table 1).
One study reporting pre-treatment data (Oswald and
Covington 1984) illustrates how an absence of pre-
treatment data could have influenced conclusions.
Oswald and Covington (1984) found that post-
treatment average biomass on burn plots was 195
kg/ha greater than on control plots, but biomass on
burn plots had increased only 44% over pre-treat-
ment levels compared to 53% on control plots. This
discrepancy occurred because pre-treatment biomass
on control plots was only 51% that of burn plots. In
studies where pre-treatment data are collected but
pre-treatment means are unequal, common in vege-
tation studies, statistical methods like analysis of
covariance can be employed that adjust for pre-
treatment differences (Sokal and Rohlf 1995).    
Several authors (Harris and Covington 1983,
Andariese and Covington 1986, Covington et al.
1997) have reported variations in biomass after pre-

70
TREE THINNING AND PRESCRIBED BURNING EFFECTS g ABELLA
scribed burning among different overstory patches
(e.g., sawtimber patches [dominated by trees
>30 cm diameter], and pole patches [10-30 cm dia-
meter]). For example, Andariese and Covington
(1986) found that at a site burned two years pre-
viously, total ground flora biomass averaged
53.5 kg/ha greater in sawtimber patches than in pole
patches. Harris and Covington (1983), in contrast,
reported that ground flora biomass differed between
burned and control plots one year after prescribed
burning in pole and sapling (trees <10 cm diameter)
patches but not in sawtimber patches. These differ-
ential changes were attributed to variations among
overstory patches in fuel loading, fire behavior, and
pre-burn ground flora composition (Harris and Cov-
ington 1983).  
The interactive effects on plant biomass of pre-
scribed burning and residual tree densities after
mechanical thinning have not been fully explored
(Clary et al. 1975, Bojorquez Tapia et al. 1990). In
a non-manipulative study on the Kaibab Plateau,
Moore and Deiter (1992) published equations show-
ing sharp declines in ground flora biomass with in-
creasing stand density indices. Clary and Ffolliott
(1966) found that ground flora biomass was higher
in thinned than unthinned stands with residual basal
areas of 5-18 m2/ha, but there was no significant dif-
ference among treatments when post-thinning basal
area exceeded 18 m2/ha. Covington et al. (1997)
reported that in patches dominated by postsettle-
ment-origin trees, ground flora biomass in thinning
only treatments was almost four times greater than
in thin + prescribed burn treatments. In other studies
such as in Andariese and Covington (1986), spora-
dic thinning that occurred before planned burning
treatments makes it difficult to separate the effects
of thinning only from burning and of prescribed
burning under different stand densities. From an
ecological restoration perspective, where burning
may be reintroduced on sites with a variety of over-
story characteristics (e.g., natural openings, former-
ly dense stands that are thinned to varying den-
sities), future research could examine thin + burn
interactions and the effects of mechanical thinning
without prescribed burning. 
In a retrospective study, Andariese and Cov-
ington (1986) is one of the few studies that has eval-
uated the effects of time since thinning or burning
on ground flora biomass. These authors found that
in mature stands ground flora biomass did not differ
significantly between burn and control plots at sites
burned 2 and 5 yr before sampling in 1981 but did
differ at a site burned 7 yr previously. Additional
retrospective studies combined with planned, long-
term experiments are needed to ascertain how long
the benefits of thinning or burning persist on ground
flora biomass and how frequently burning should
occur to optimize benefits for ground flora (Rey-
nolds 1962). Ground flora biomass in Arizona pon-
derosa pine can vary seasonally and among years
depending on precipitation (McLaughlin 1978), so
long-term monitoring is needed to more carefully
distinguish time from treatment effects (Ffolliott
and Gottfried 1989).  
In all studies reviewed, except for Covington et
al. (1997) whose study area was excluded from
large herbivore grazing, grazing either before or
after treatment has apparently affected post-treat-
ment standing crop biomass estimates. Available
soil nutrients often increase following burning
(Raison 1979, Covington and Sackett 1992), and
this was expressed by greater concentrations of
nutrients such as N and K in grass foliage after a
northern Arizona burn (Harris and Covington 1983).
Higher foliage nutrient concentrations can make
plants more susceptible to grazing (Clary 1975).
Landscape grazing influences on ground flora bio-
mass and on species composition are not well quan-
tified for Arizona ponderosa pine (Arnold 1953,
Clary 1975, Rambo and Faeth 1999), and it is desir-
able to understand to what extent restoration sites in
a matrix of denser forest containing little forage be-
come targets for heavy grazing (Reynolds 1966,
Ffolliott et al. 1977). Grazing use may have implica-
tions for restoration landscape planning of the size,
dispersal, and spatial patterns of treated and untreat-
ed areas should restoration thinning and burning be
applied at broad scales.
SPECIES DIVERSITY
Research published to date does not indicate
that thinning or prescribed burning consistently in-
crease ground flora diversity in Arizona ponderosa
pine forests (Table 2). In northern Arizona, for ex-
ample, Griffis et al. (2001) reported similar post-
treatment mean native forb species richness
(375 m2) of 18 in control stands (mean basal
area=32 m2/ha), 17 in thinned stands (residual mean
basal area=19 m2/ha), and 19 in thinned and burned
stands (residual basal area=15 m2/ha). Abella and
Covington (in press) found that total mean species
richness/m2 did not differ significantly among con-
trol, low-, and medium-intensity thinning treat-
ments, but a richness of 4 species/m2 in a high-
intensity thin (reducing density 85% to 140 trees/ha)
was twice as high as in the other treatments. This
finding suggested that a lower-limit stand density
threshold needed to be passed before species rich-
ness increased, but experimentation with a wider
range of stand densities and on different soil types
is needed to test this hypothesis. Near the Grand
Canyon, Fulé et al. (2002) reported sharp post-

treatment declines in Simpson's diversity index both
in control and thin/burn treatments. Precipitation
only 61% of the average in the post-treatment year
(2000) was hypothesized to have caused the decline,
and counteracted any detectable treatment effects. 
COMMUNITY COMPOSITION
By including both the species present and their
abundances, composition is one of the best single
measures for characterizing vegetation communities
(McCune and Grace 2002). Community composi-
tional change after thinning and burning has been
rarely studied in Arizona ponderosa pine. Tables of
species composition have been presented only in
Oswald and Covington (1983), Vose and White
(1987), and Abella and Covington (in press). Such
tables are important for comparisons among study
areas and for meta-analyses of regional species com-
position (Gurevitch et al. 2001). Abella and Coving-
ton (in press) is the only study that has statistically
evaluated overall community compositional differ-
ences among treatments. They reported subtle but
positive native species compositional differences
between control plots and thin + burn plots 3 years
after treatment, and concluded that multivariate
methods were needed to detect these differences.  
Increasing concern about exotic species in Ariz-
ona ponderosa pine forests (Sackett et al. 1996, Sieg
et al. 2003) provides added incentive for detailed
analyses of community compositional shifts after
restoration treatments for early detection of exotics.
Exotic species common at Abella and Covington's
(in press) northern Arizona study area included
common mullein (Verbascum thapsus L.), dalmatian
toadflax (Linaria dalmatica (L.) P. Mill.), and bull
thistle (Cirsium vulgare (Savi) Ten.). Sieg et al.
(2003) provide a general list of potential exotic spe-
cies of concern in Arizona ponderosa pine forests.
POPULATION PROCESSES
Vose and White (1987) found that soil seed
banks averaged 8.4 viable seeds/m2 in a northern
Arizona prescribed burn area 1 year after the burn
and concluded that seed banks contributed little to
post-burn vegetation dynamics. In ponderosa pine
forests near the Grand Canyon, Springer (1999)
reported a much higher viable seed density of 3,152
seeds/m2 in the seed bank in September after over-
story thinning that summer. Maiden blue-eyed Mary
(Collinsia parviflora Lindl.) comprised 45% of
these seeds, redstem monkeyflower (Mimulus rubel-
lus Gray) 17%, while the exotic common mullein
comprised 30%. Of 14 species emerging in germina-
tion tests, 11 were annuals or biennials, three were
perennials, and all species were forbs. Viable seed
estimates in Arizona ponderosa pine seed banks are
lower than estimates of 13,052 to 14,463/m2 report-
ed by Pratt et al. (1984) in an eastern Washington
ponderosa pine forest. Research published to date
suggests that seed banks may not be primary factors
influencing post-thinning or burning vegetation
dynamics in Arizona ponderosa pine forests.  
During 1 year after a northern Arizona pre-
scribed burn in open sawtimber, Vose and White
(1987) reported a total seed rain of 244/m2 for
grasses, 303/m2 for forbs, and none for shrubs. A
main conclusion of this study was that pre-existing
vegetation and vegetation surviving the burn most
strongly controlled post-burn vegetation dynamics
by producing seed or by expanding vegetatively
(e.g., buckbrush [Ceanothus fendleri Gray]). At the
same study area, White et al. (1991) found that

72
TREE THINNING AND PRESCRIBED BURNING EFFECTS g ABELLA
Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica Vasey) and
mountain muhly (Muhlenbergia montana [Nutt.]
A.S. Hitchc.) did not flower the first year after a
burn in sawtimber and pole patches. Both species
resumed flowering the second year, while squirrel-
tail (Elymus elymoides [Raf.] Swezey) and mutton-
grass (Poa fendleriana [Steud.] Vasey) exhibited no
apparent phenological differences between burned
and unburned areas. Community demographic
studies (Vose and White 1987) over several years
are needed in Arizona ponderosa pine to test
hypotheses about fine-scale processes such as seed
dispersal in burned areas from on- and off-site vege-
tation, phenological and seed production changes
after burns, and the survival and growth of vege-
tation after fire (Harper 1977). These studies also
could facilitate the reintroduction of native plant
populations in treatment areas, which has been suc-
cessful in longleaf pine savannas (Glitzenstein et al.
2001). 
INDIVIDUAL SPECIES
As predicted from general ecological theory
(Whelan 1995), thinning and burning in Arizona
ponderosa pine increases some ground flora species,
has no apparent impact on others, and negatively
affects some species (Gaines et al. 1958, Phillips et
al. 1993, Maschinski et al. 1997). In interpreting
results, however, one should consider short- and
possible long-term effects; most studies have evalu-
ated only short-term effects.  One year after burning
in northern Arizona, squirreltail exhibited a mean
biomass of 112 kg/ha in open sawtimber burned
areas compared to 40 kg/ha in controls (Vose and
White 1991). Biomass did not differ significantly
between burned and control plots in below-canopy
sawtimber, pole, or sapling patches. Research in
other regions has generally found that squirreltail
biomass and density increase after burning (Young
and Miller 1985), probably partly because the
species contains a low density of dead plant material
that does not burn hot enough to appreciably
damage the plant (Wright 1971). Mountain muhly,
in contrast, exhibited significantly lower biomass in
open sawtimber between burn (mean biomass=40
kg/ha) and control plots (mean biomass=58kg/ha) 1
year after fire (Vose and White 1991). Muttongrass
and buckbrush biomass did not differ significantly
between treatments, although resprouting of
buckbrush was observed at the end of the study and
may have resulted in long-term increases in
buckbrush biomass (Vose and White 1991).
In a comprehensive study of Sunset Crater pen-
stemon (Penstemon clutei A. Nels.), a species en-
demic to the Sunset Crater volcanic field of northern
Arizona, Fulé et al. (2001) reported that prescribed
burning resulted in a 75% decrease in penstemon
density. Trenching to reduce root competition from
overstory ponderosa pine, however, resulted in a
1200% increase in penstemon density. This is one
of the few studies in Arizona ponderosa pine that
has attempted to separate the effects of burning
from overstory competition. Most other studies have
variously had some type of mechanical tree thinning
occur before prescribed burning (e.g., Andariese and
Covington 1986), and Fulé et al. (2001) suggests
that research distinguishing the effects of thinning
only from thinning + burning might be insightful
both ecologically and for applied management.
ECOSYSTEM PERSPECTIVE
Ground flora research as part of a multifactor
ecosystem perspective might be the most rewarding
because of the difficulty of separating treatment
effects on ground flora from treatment effects on
other interrelated ecosystem components. Examples
include effects on ground flora of O-horizon thick-
ness, soil nutrients and plant-mycorrhizae associa-
tions, and historical factors like seed-source limita-
tions. Clary et al. (1968), for example, found that
ground flora biomass was negatively correlated with
O-horizon thickness. O-horizon thickness in ponder-
osa pine has increased during the past century
because of fire suppression and increased tree den-
sities, and prescribed burning might benefit ground
flora only if O horizons are reduced (Covington and
Sackett 1984). Korb et al. (2003) reported that
arbuscular mycorrhizae were more abundant on
thinned and burned plots than on control plots, and
some plant species are associated with mycorrhizae
for nutrient and water uptake. Since two studies in
Arizona ponderosa pine suggest that perennial
species are sparse in seed banks (Vose and White
1987, Springer 1999), seed source limitations might
constrain ground flora responses to thinning and
burning more than we realize. Seeding experiments
could be used to better understand the relative roles
of seed limitations from other limitations such as
safe-site or light availability (Naumburg et al.
2001). 
REGIONAL COMPARISONS
Most ground flora research in southwestern
ponderosa pine forests has occurred in Arizona, so
few comparisons to other southwestern states can be
made (Lynch et al. 2000). In thinned Pacific North-
west ponderosa pine stands in central Oregon, Busse
et al. (2000) concluded that prescribed burning had
little influence on ground flora biomass and cover,
with the exception that bitterbrush (Purshia triden-
tata (Pursh) DC.) declined significantly. In Montana

ponderosa pine, Newland and DeLuca (2000) found
that N-fixing plants were 195% more frequent in
burned than in unburned plots and hypothesized that
N-fixers were important in maintaining site produc-
tivity in these often N-limited forests. McConnell
and Smith (1970) found that in eastern Washington,
thinning ponderosa pine to >45% canopy cover
caused higher forb than grass biomass, whereas
thinning to <45% canopy cover resulted in greater
grass than forb biomass. In Idaho ponderosa pine,
Armour et al. (1984) reported that post-treatment
graminoid cover was 5-10% lower on high-intensity
than on low-intensity burn plots. Consistent with
Vose and White (1987) in Arizona ponderosa pine,
Armour et al. (1984) concluded that ground flora
species occurring on plots before treatment most
strongly affected post-burn vegetation dynamics,
apparently by increasing reproduction. Similar to
Fulé et al.'s (2001) study of Sunset Crater pen-
stemon in northern Arizona, Riegel et al. (1995)
found that trenching to reduce ponderosa pine root
competition increased ground flora cover in Oregon.
FUTURE ARIZONA RESEARCH
Multivariate statistical methods need to be used
more frequently in combination with univariate
methods in Arizona ponderosa pine vegetation
research. Unless part of a larger multivariate anal-
ysis, useful measures like total ground flora biomass
and species richness are univariate approaches to the
multivariate problem of plant communities and their
relationships with other ecosystem components
(Abella and Covington in press). It remains unclear
how season of burn, burn intensity, and mechanical
thinning + burning interactions differentially affect
ponderosa pine ground flora. Ground flora re-
sponses to restoration treatments also have not been
compared on different soil types, and replicating re-
search sites across the landscape to evaluate the
geographic consistency of research findings is one
of the greatest research needs in Arizona ponderosa
pine. In a nonmanipulative study, for example, Ffol-
liott and Clary (1975) reported generally greater
ground flora biomass on sedimentary than on igne-
ous soils. Differences in vegetation responses to res-
toration may also occur among different soil types.
Research published to date suggests that thin-
ning and burning treatments have great potential to
improve native ground flora communities, providing
support for implementing monitored, broad-scale
restoration experiments in Arizona ponderosa pine
forests. These experiments should also test treat-
ments additional to thinning and burning, such as
seeding of native species and life-history specific
control methods of exotic species. In an earlier
review of fire effects in ponderosa pine forests,
Wright (1978) noted that questions about specific
responses of individual species and long-term,
community-level transitions had been little studied.
These specific questions remain little studied to
date. Specific data about demographics and seed
dispersal of individual species, the role of seeding
native species, and detailed multivariate analyses of
community dynamics could advance ecological res-
toration's ability to assist recovery of native ground
flora vegetation in Arizona ponderosa pine forests.
