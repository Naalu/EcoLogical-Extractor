Abstract
Fire regimes in North American forests are diverse and modern fire records
are often too short to capture important patterns, trends, feedbacks, and
drivers of variability. Tree-ring fire scars provide valuable perspectives on fire
regimes, including centuries-long records of fire year, season, frequency, sever-
ity, and size. Here, we introduce the newly compiled North American tree-ring
fire-scar network (NAFSN), which contains 2562 sites, >37,000 fire-scarred
trees, and covers large parts of North America. We investigate the NAFSN in
terms of geography, sample depth, vegetation, topography, climate, and human
land use. Fire scars are found in most ecoregions, from boreal forests in north-
ern Alaska and Canada to subtropical forests in southern Florida and Mexico.
The network includes 91 tree species, but is dominated by gymnosperms in the
genus Pinus. Fire scars are found from sea level to >4000-m elevation and across
a range of topographic settings that vary by ecoregion. Multiple regions are
densely sampled (e.g., >1000 fire-scarred trees), enabling new spatial analyses
such as reconstructions of area burned. To demonstrate the potential of the net-
work, we compared the climate space of the NAFSN to those of modern fires
and forests; the NAFSN spans a climate space largely representative of the for-
ested areas in North America, with notable gaps in warmer tropical climates.
Modern fires are burning in similar climate spaces as historical fires, but dispro-
portionately in warmer regions compared to the historical record, possibly

observations of changing fire regimes. The historical influence of Indigenous
and non-Indigenous human land use on fire regimes varies in space and time. A
20th century fire deficit associated with human activities is evident in many
regions, yet fire regimes characterized by frequent surface fires are still active in
some areas (e.g., Mexico and the southeastern United States). These analyses
provide a foundation and framework for future studies using the hundreds of
thousands of annually- to sub-annually-resolved tree-ring records of fire span-
ning centuries, which will further advance our understanding of the interactions
among fire, climate, topography, vegetation, and humans across North America.

INTRODUCTION
Fire regimes in forests of North America vary across
space and time in response to a complex suite of environ-
mental controls and human activities. In western North
America, fires are increasing in size and severity,
driven by both climate change and increased fuel loads
resulting from anthropogenic fire exclusion (Abatzoglou &
Williams, 2016; Covington & Moore, 1994; Hanes et al.,
2019; Parks & Abatzoglou, 2020; Westerling et al., 2006).
The direct impacts of these changing fire regimes include
losses and alterations of forest cover, and vegetation type
conversions at many sites (Coop et al., 2020; Girard et al.,
2008; McLauchlan et al., 2020). Emissions from increasing
wildfires are moving carbon from ecosystems into the atmo-
sphere (Hurteau et al., 2019; Liang et al., 2018), with smoke
affecting public health (Burke et al., 2021) and impacting
air quality both nearby and far from active fires (Baars
et al., 2011; Brey et al., 2018). In temperate forests of eastern
North America, where recent large fires are relatively rare,
historically recurrent fires were important in some locations
and the lack of fire over the last century is driving ecosys-
tem changes that include the loss of open forest communi-
ties and pyrophilic species, with a consequent decline in
vegetation flammability (Hanberry et al., 2018; Nowacki &
Abrams, 2008). In many locations in the southeastern
United States, the Great Plains, and northern Mexico fire
regimes have been maintained for centuries, often reflecting
human land use practices, including intentional burning,
and limited fire suppression (Allen & Palmer, 2011; Fule
et al., 2011; Rother et al., 2020; Stambaugh et al., 2009;
Villarreal et al., 2020). Despite this diversity in fire regime
characteristics and influences, fire risk is projected to
increase in much of North America due to climate change
(Gao et al., 2021; Kitzberger et al., 2017; Krawchuk et al.,
2009; Stephens et al., 2020), increasing lightning ignitions
coupled with longer droughts (Fill et al., 2019; Romps
et al., 2014), and increasing human ignitions coupled with
fire suppression that increases fuel loads (Balch et al., 2017).
However, uncertainties remain about the effects of climate
change across the diversity of fire regimes in North Amer-
ica, particularly due to the variability, interactions, and
complex nonlinear relationships between climate, fire, vege-
tation, topography, and human land use (Littell et al., 2018;
Riley et al., 2019; Tepley et al., 2018). Our understanding of
these mechanistic drivers of fire regimes is limited by the
relatively short modern fire atlas and satellite records of
fire that are entirely contained within a period highly
influenced by humans.
Records of past fires that span centuries to millennia
can be preserved in the annual growth rings of trees.
Tree-ring fire scars provide spatially explicit records of
nonlethal fire (i.e., the tree must survive the fire to record
a scar) that can be dated to the year of burning using den-
drochronology (Figure 1; Dieterich & Swetnam, 1984). In
some circumstances, fire scars can also be used to esti-
mate other information on past fires, such as fire inten-
sity and spread direction (Bergeron & Brisson, 1990), or
the seasonal timing of fires (Rother et al., 2018). Heat
from the fire kills cambial cells to produce a scar that is
covered by subsequent growth (Gutsell & Johnson,
1996; Smith et al., 2016), and in some cases, the scars can
be completely internal, with no evidence of scarring
on the outside of the trunk (e.g., Huffman, 2006;
Lombardo et al., 2009; Taylor & Skinner, 1998). Fire-
scarred trees are most common in low- to moderate-
severity fire regimes, where many trees survive fires
(Harley et al., 2013; Kipfmueller et al., 2017; Swetnam &
Baisan, 1996), but they are also found in mixed- and high-
severity regimes at the edges of high-severity fire patches
(Guiterman et al., 2015; Heon et al., 2014; Heyerdahl
et al., 2019; Margolis et al., 2007). The strength of fire-scar

records comes from the annual to sub-annual precision that
enables compiling many point records into networks that
span scales from individual trees, to landscapes, to regions,
and to continents (Falk et al., 2011; Swetnam et al., 2016;
Trouet et al., 2010). These spatially distributed, multicentury
records of fire provide valuable, long-term context for mod-
ern fire records derived from satellites and mapped fire
atlases that generally span from 1984 to present. Excep-
tional, multimillennial fire histories have been developed
from giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum; Swetnam,
1993) and 200 million-year-old fire scars have even been
found in late Triassic petrified wood in Arizona (Byers
et al., 2020). Combining tree-ring records of fire with mod-
ern records, as well as longer Indigenous oral histories, and
charcoal and pollen records from bogs, lakes, soils, or gla-
ciers that span 10,000 years or more, enables analyses of
patterns and drivers of fire regimes over the Holocene (e.g.,
Allen et al., 2008; Fule et al., 2011; Higuera et al., 2010,
2021; Hoffman et al., 2017; Larson et al., 2021; Roos &
Guiterman, 2021).
The ability of trees to record a history of fires has
been recognized scientifically for over a century by iconic
ecologists, naturalists, and foresters including Frederick
Clements, Aldo Leopold, and Gifford Pinchot (Clements,
1910; Leopold, 1924; Swetnam & Baisan, 1996). The first
crossdated fire-history study was published by Harold
Weaver (1951) using cross sections of ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa) from northern Arizona that were dated
by the founder of dendrochronology, Andrew Douglass.
The first fire-history workshop was convened in 1980 at
the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research in Tucson, AZ, to
discuss the newly emerging field (Stokes, 1980). For over
40 years, tree-ring fire-history research has expanded in
terms of number and spatial coverage of sites and

researchers across North America and around the world.
New tools have been developed to facilitate analysis of
the growing volume of fire history data—including
graphical user interface software, FHAES (Fire History
Analysis Exploration System; Sutherland et al., 2014),
and a tree-ring fire-history R package, burnr (Malevich
et al., 2018)—which has advanced the field through ana-
lyses of large fire scar networks to address important new
research questions (Harley et al., 2018).
Tree-ring fire-scar networks enable the exploration of
mechanistic drivers of spatiotemporal variability in fire
dynamics and place modern changes in a long-term con-
text. Fire-scar networks were vital for increasing the
understanding of climate drivers of fire regimes. This
includes the effects of equatorial Pacific Ocean sea sur-
face temperatures associated with large-scale climate
modes, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, on fire
regimes in the United States (Beckage et al., 2003;
Heyerdahl et al., 2008; Swetnam & Betancourt, 1990,
1998) and synchronizing fire occurrences in parts of
North and South America (Kitzberger et al., 2001), as
well as identifying the North Pacific jet stream as a driver
of wildfire extremes in California (Wahl et al., 2019).
Guyette et al. (2012) identified major climate drivers of
historical fire frequency for the United States using the
physical chemistry fire frequency model and a network
of 170 fire history sites. Fire-scar networks have also rev-
ealed important contexts for changing vegetation and land-
scape dynamics (Dewar et al., 2021; Lafon et al., 2017;
O’Connor et al., 2017) and human influences on fire regimes
(Collins & Stephens, 2007; Guyette et al., 2002; Kipfmueller
et al., 2021; Kitchen, 2015; Swetnam et al., 2016). Regional
fire-scar networks were key to identifying the anomaly of
20th century fire exclusion in large parts of the United States
(Guyette et al., 2002; Swetnam & Baisan, 1996), thereby
shaping national fire policies. Insights such as these, realized
only as data were compiled over expanding geographic
scales, attest to the potential of a continent-wide fire-scar
synthesis initiative. A North American tree-ring fire-scar
network that spans multiple centuries and covers the broad
diversity of climate, forest biomes, topography, and human
influences,
is
necessary
to
identify
patterns,
trends,
and drivers of fire as a fundamental ecological process
(McLauchlan et al., 2020). Such evidence and understanding
are key for predicting future fire activity and effects, and for
informing management and policy decisions in an era of
rapid change (Guyette et al., 2014; Hessburg et al., 2019).
In this paper, we present a newly compiled continental-
scale network of tree-ring fire-scar collections, the North
American tree-ring fire-scar network (NAFSN). We analyze
the spatiotemporal patterns of the NAFSN (e.g., using
state-space analyses) for the following key components and
influences on fire regimes: (1) geography, (2) vegetation,
(3) sample depth, (4) topography, (5) climate, and
(6) humans. For each topic, we describe background, ana-
lyses, findings, and interpretations, including future direc-
tions. We include an example application of the NAFSN to
place the climate space of modern fires in a historical con-
text. By analyzing key influences on fire regimes, we
illustrate the potential of the NAFSN to advance our under-
standing of the past, present, and future role of fire in for-
ested ecosystems, including promoting future research on
the spatiotemporal relationships between fire, climate,
vegetation, and humans across multiple scales.
COMPILING THE TREE-RING
FIRE-SCAR NETWORK
The NAFSN builds on previous efforts to compile and
synthesize tree-ring fire-history data. The largest existing
data source is the International Multiproxy Paleofire
Database
(IMPD;
https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/
paleoclimatology/fire-history). The IMPD and other data
compilations
provide
coverage
across
the
western
United
States
and
northern
Mexico
(e.g.,
Marlon
et al., 2012; Swetnam et al., 2016; Yocom Kent et al., 2017),
while other North American regions remain sparsely repre-
sented. The tree-ring fire-history community, largely repre-
sented here in our authorship, added >1750 sites and many
of those are located outside of the western United States,
making the network truly North American in scope.
We compiled data from all available tree-ring fire-scar
sites or plots (hereafter “sites,” discussed further below)
in North America (Canada, United States, and Mexico,
and Indigenous Nations). We included completed studies
going back to 1980, as well as dated sites from ongoing
studies. We did not limit sites by the number of trees, or
the area sampled, although these attributes were quanti-
fied when available. We only included records from fire-
scarred trees and excluded tree-ring fire history derived
from tree ages. Tree ages are important for determining
fire severity, and are commonly used to study high-
severity fire regimes, but unlike fire scars, tree ages often
do not indicate the exact year a fire occurred, and there-
fore have different data structures and analysis methods
(Margolis et al., 2007). All fire-scar sites in the NAFSN
are crossdated to provide annually precise dates.
The NAFSN currently includes 2562 sites and >37,000
fire-scarred trees. The metadata include site name, contrib-
utor, geographic coordinates, tree species of fire-scar sam-
ples, area sampled, number of trees, years of first and last
tree ring, years of first and last fire scar, and published refer-
ences (https://doi.org/10.5066/P9PT90QX). We included all
known dated fire-scar collections as of August 2020. Area
sampled was the least reported metric (64% of sites). Eight

hundred of the NAFSN sites are publicly available on the
IMPD, primarily representing western North America. We
added 1762 sites to the network, which includes 491 sites
compiled by the Fire and Climate Synthesis (FACS) project
focused on the western United States (Swetnam, Falk,
Sutherland, et al., 2011). One goal of the NAFSN project is
to increase the number and spatial representation of sites
publicly available, which is ongoing through facilitation of
the process to contribute data to the IMPD.
GEOGRAPHY
The use of fire scars in fire-history studies, fire-regime
analysis, and fire climatology is deeply rooted in geogra-
phy; all of the themes of the NAFSN described hereafter are
inherently spatial. To describe the basic geography of the
network, we mapped the site locations and calculated the
density of sites and fire-scarred trees within 10,000-km2
hexels (Figure 2). We also compared the NAFSN site loca-
tions with other available data sets that have potential for
cross-disciplinary analysis, including paleo-charcoal, paleo-
pollen, and tree-ring width sites (e.g., Marlon et al., 2008,
2012; Appendix S1: Figures S1–S3).
The NAFSN sites are broadly distributed across large
areas of North America (Figure 2a). Variability in sam-
pling intensity is evident in both the density of sites
(Figure 2b) and the density of sampled trees (Figure 2c).
Several areas of particularly high sampling density are
found in ponderosa pine and dry mixed conifer forests of
the western United States, including: (1) The Jemez
Mountains of northern New Mexico (1645 trees at
117 sites), (2) the southern Cascades/northern Sierra
Nevada of northern California (1502 trees at 115 sites),
(3) the Sky Islands of southeastern Arizona (1426 trees at
234 sites), (4) the Colorado Front Range (1352 trees at
95 sites), (5) the Blue Mountains of eastern Oregon (1151
trees at 61 sites), and (6) the San Juan Mountains of
southwestern Colorado (1135 trees at 43 sites). Areas of
high sample density in boreal and northern forest regions
include a ca. 150-km-long transect in northwestern Que-
bec (1269 trees at 93 sites), the Lake of the Woods along
the Ontario/Manitoba border (1227 trees at 8 sites), the
Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness of northern
Minnesota and Quetico Provincial Park of southwestern
Ontario (596 trees at 103 sites), and 778 trees at 241 sites
in Alaska. In the eastern United States, fire scars were
sampled from more than 1800 trees along the Appala-
chian Mountains and more than 600 trees in the Ozarks
of southeastern Missouri and northern Arkansas. In
Mexico, almost 3000 trees have been sampled at more
than 100 sites. There are notable spatial gaps or low den-
sities of sample sites in some forested regions, including
sections of the eastern United States, southern Mexico,
and boreal Canada (Figure 2).
The area sampled and the number of sampled trees in
a site varies across North America. For sites where area
sampled was reported (n = 1628), the median area sam-
pled per site is 3.2 ha (mean = 199.2 ha; range = 0.0015–
75,000 ha). Small sample areas are generally associated
with sampling designs using networks of small (1–2 ha)
plots, whereas larger sample areas often indicate “targeted”
designs where trees were sampled opportunistically across
large areas (Farris et al., 2013). The median number of fire-
scarred trees in a site is eight (mean = 14.8; range = 1–250).
Although a site with a single tree may seem too small for
inclusion, a single giant sequoia, ponderosa pine, or longleaf
pine (Pinus palustris) can provide a rich record of 30 or more
fire scars (e.g., Guiterman et al., 2019; Huffman, 2006;
Swetnam et al., 2009).
The spatial distribution of fire-scar sites across North
America provides insights into factors that affect fire-scar
formation, preservation, and sampling. Most areas with
high sample density are in dry conifer forests of western
North America where a seasonally warm and dry climate
historically promoted low- to moderate-severity fire, and
tree species are well-suited to recording and preserving fire
scars (Dieterich & Swetnam, 1984; Keeley et al., 2011). In
contrast, sampling density is lower in noncoastal plain
regions of the eastern United States, where forests are domi-
nated by angiosperm tree species that compartmentalize
fire scars less effectively and decay quickly (Smith &
Sutherland, 1999). Moreover, few mature forests remain in
this region following centuries of extensive Euro-American
land-clearing, logging, and settlement (see Vegetation
section for further discussion). In areas such as boreal and
subalpine landscapes where fires typically burn at high
severity and kill most mature trees over large areas, sub-
stantial effort may be required to find fire-scarred trees, and
those trees typically record few fires (Heon et al., 2014;
O’Connor et al., 2014). Finally, the fire-scarred trees must
produce annual rings that can be crossdated to provide
annually resolved fire dates. Crossdating is typically not a
limitation in much of North America, as illustrated by the
spatial distribution of existing tree-ring width chronologies
(Appendix S1: Figure S1), but there may be problems in cer-
tain regions where tree growth continues year-round
(e.g., tropical Mexico), or with certain species (e.g., Coast
redwood, Sequoia sempervirens; Brown & Swetnam, 1994).
Future sampling to fill spatial gaps in the southeastern
United States, northwestern Canada, and southern Mexico
would provide valuable new data on fire regimes in under-
studied ecosystems and coupled human-natural systems.
The variability in sample area and sample density
among NAFSN sites reflects variation in study design as

composition, wood preservation, land use, and fire
regimes across North America. For instance, in a rela-
tively homogeneous landscape with a frequent fire
regime, if the vegetation is dominated by trees that easily
record and preserve fire scars, it may be possible to char-
acterize attributes of the fire regime, such as mean fire
interval or fire season, with a small number of sites or
relatively few trees (Van Horne & Fule, 2006). More
intensive sampling is needed, however, to address more
specific questions, such as the relationships among fire,
climate, and tree establishment (Brown & Wu, 2005), the
spatial extent of individual fires (Farris et al., 2010; Hessl
et al., 2007; Huffman et al., 2015; Marschall et al., 2019;
O’Connor
et
al.,
2014;
Swetnam,
Falk,

Farris, 2011), landscape variability in fire regime metrics
(Kernan & Hessl, 2010), or uncertainty in estimates of
fire regime metrics for a given degree of sampling effort
(Farris et al., 2013; Van Horne & Fule, 2006). A higher
density of sample sites is typically needed in more topo-
graphically complex landscapes, or when seeking to
quantify variation in fire regimes across biophysical gra-
dients (Caprio & Swetnam, 1995; Heyerdahl et al., 2011;
Huffman et al., 2020; Kellogg et al., 2007; Kitchen, 2012;
Margolis & Balmat, 2009; Odion et al., 2014; Taylor &
Skinner, 1998). To address questions of spatial scaling of
fire-regime metrics, spatially explicit tree locations are
valuable (McKenzie et al., 2006; McKenzie & Kennedy,
2012). Different sample designs are likely necessary to meet

different study objectives, but where possible, standardized
sampling (e.g., small plot reconstructions, along with
recording individual tree locations) will facilitate future
meta-analyses and data comparisons, making it a priority
for the fire-history community.
Although the network is composed of sites collected
with different methods and objectives, which can pose
some challenges for meta-analyses, the common standard
of crossdating that results in annually resolved fire dates
is one reason that many of the potential limitations can
be overcome. Tree ring fire scars are unequivocal point
records of fire occurrence, which allows them to be com-
bined and analyzed across scales (e.g., Falk et al., 2011;
Swetnam & Baisan, 1996). This is why tree-ring fire-scar
network analyses have provided important insights into
fire–climate relationships, as described above, in addition
to the broad spatial scales over which many components
of the climate system operate. Analyses across large areas
will require different techniques (e.g., filtering to includ-
ing fires recorded by >x% of trees) applied to the different
components of a fire regime to minimize the differences
and possible limitations of the original data. Not all fire
regime metrics are equally comparable across the net-
work. For example, fire interval analyses may need care-
ful assessment of covariates such as area sampled (Falk &
Swetnam, 2003) or vegetation type for valid comparisons.
Statistical assessments of sample-size relationships or col-
lector’s curves can help quantify, model, and correct for
differences among sampling procedures or changing sam-
ple depth to ensure robust comparisons across sites and
through time (e.g., Swetnam et al., 2016). Overall, these
challenges can be addressed with multiple methods,
including validations of the fire-scar record with modern
fire data.
The increasing number of regions with high sample
densities presents new opportunities to advance our
understanding of scaling properties of fire regimes
(Lertzman et al., 1998; McKenzie & Kennedy, 2012). An
important question, even for well-sampled ecoregions, is
what is an appropriate spatial scale of inference beyond
the immediate stand or vegetation patch where trees
were sampled? This can be tested through combinations
of fire history, stand reconstructions, and modeling
(e.g., Kennedy & McKenzie, 2010; Maxwell et al., 2014).
The answer to this question undoubtedly depends on fire
size and frequency and varies among landscapes within the
continent, with important implications for ongoing debates
in fire science and management (e.g., Fulé et al., 2014;
Lafon et al., 2017; Matlack, 2013; Oswald et al., 2020). Addi-
tionally, the large scope of this collection provides the
opportunity for studies of fundamental scaling properties of
fire regimes, such as relationships between fire frequency
and area—similar to species–area relationships (Arabas
et al., 2006; Falk et al., 2007; Falk & Swetnam, 2003;
McKenzie et al., 2006). Such relationships may provide criti-
cal information for effective fire management, especially in
frequent fire regions where prescribed fires or lightning
ignited wildfires are needed to maintain habitats (e.g., Fill
et al., 2015; Huffman et al., 2017; Noss et al., 2015).
Comparing the fire-scar network to other continental
paleodata networks suggests possible directions for future
syntheses and collaborations (Appendix S1: Figures S1–S3).
For example, the Global Charcoal Database v3 includes
211 lake-sediment charcoal sites in North America (Marlon
et al., 2015). Twenty (9%) of these sites are within 10 km of a
fire-scar site, 27 (13%) sites are within 15 km, and 40 (19%)
sites are within 20 km. Thus, without collecting additional
data there may be numerous opportunities to combine tree-
ring and lake-sediment records of fire. Combining the
centuries-long annual to sub-annual resolution tree-ring
fire-scar data with the multimillennial length lake sediment
and alluvial charcoal data can inform a more complete
understanding of patterns and drivers of fire regime
changes (Allen et al., 2008; Beaty & Taylor, 2009; Bigio
et al., 2010; Higuera et al., 2010, 2021; Leys et al., 2019;
Waito et al., 2018; Whitlock et al., 2004). There are also
254 fire-scar sites located within 10 km of a lake-sediment
pollen site in the Neotoma Paleoecology Database (https://
www.neotomadb.org/; Appendix S1: Figure S3), providing
the potential to evaluate fire history within the context of
long-term vegetation change. Some potential challenges for
combining tree-ring and sediment records include different
temporal resolutions (e.g., annual to sub-annual vs. mul-
tidecadal
to
centennial,
although
annually
resolved
“varved” lake sediments do exist), different spatial resolu-
tions (systematic grids covering thousands of hectares
vs. single sediment cores), potential differences in ecological
settings (e.g., mid-elevation montane forests vs. high-
elevation alpine lakes). Many of these challenges can be
addressed with careful site selection, analysis methods, and
calibration with modern fires (e.g., Allen et al., 2008).
VEGETATION
Fire is a fundamental driver of plant evolution and ecol-
ogy (Bond & Keeley, 2005; Mutch, 1970), promoting a
diverse suite of adaptations for survival and reproduction
(Keeley et al., 2011; Pausas et al., 2004; Poulos et al.,
2018), and shaping global patterns of terrestrial vegeta-
tion (Bond et al., 2005; McLauchlan et al., 2020; Noss
et al., 2015). Across a wide range of North American eco-
systems, studies of fire scars have demonstrated how dif-
ferent vegetation patterns and processes are linked
ecologically and evolutionarily to particular fire regimes
(Heinselman, 1973; Johnston et al., 2016; Myers, 1985;
ECOSPHERE
9 of 36

O’Connor et al., 2017; Stephens et al., 2003; Tande, 1979;
Wright & Agee, 2004). Such studies also demonstrate
how fire regimes have changed in association with
human land use and climate, shedding light on attendant
vegetation shifts (Bergeron, 1991; Brown & Sieg, 1999;
Guyette et al., 2002; Huffman et al., 2004; Iniguez
et al., 2016; Larson et al., 2021; North et al., 2005;
Savage & Swetnam, 1990; Taylor et al., 2016). In addition
to the effects of fire on vegetation, fire regimes them-
selves are strongly modulated by vegetation composition
and
structure,
creating
fire-vegetation
feedbacks
(e.g., Platt et al., 2016) that are increasingly recognized as
important ecological processes (Hoctor et al., 2006) as
well as important determinants of forest resilience and,
conversely, vulnerability under climate change (Hurteau
et al., 2019; Kitzberger et al., 2016; Liang et al., 2017;
Odion et al., 2010; Strahan et al., 2016). Fire-scar analysis
can provide critical insights into a full range of fire-
vegetation feedbacks, including fuel limitations (Erni
et al., 2017; Guyette et al., 2002; Scholl & Taylor, 2010;
Taylor & Skinner, 2003) and the development and main-
tenance of alternate vegetation types (Flatley et al., 2015;
Guiterman et al., 2018), thus contributing to the scientific
foundation for restoring fire-dependent ecological com-
munities (Swetnam et al., 1999). We anticipate that the
NAFSN
will provide opportunities
to develop new
insights into the importance of fire-vegetation interac-
tions across scales and disciplines. To illustrate some of
these opportunities, we characterize the forest types and
tree species of the NAFSN at continental and ecoregional
scales.
Ecoregions are areas in which local ecological types
recur predictably on comparable sites (Bailey, 1995), and
generally represent geographic areas that integrate broad
similarities in climate and biogeographic affinity. We
used North American Level 1 Ecoregions (https://www.
epa.gov/eco-research/ecoregions), recognizing a trade-off
between accuracy at the continental scale and high vari-
ability in forest types and ecology at the landscape to
local scales. We constrained the spatial extent of our
analysis to areas mapped as forest based on a 500-m reso-
lution
MODIS
vegetation
product
(Friedl
&
Sulla-
Menashe, 2019). We used the resulting forested portions
of ecoregions to define areas of interest for vegetation
analyses, as well as for subsequent analyses in the paper
(e.g., the topographic and climate spaces of fire regimes).
A small percentage of sites (1.4%) were in areas not
mapped as forests. Some of these represent inaccuracies
or mismatches of spatial resolution in the MODIS prod-
uct, but others may represent shifts to nonforest follow-
ing recent high-severity fires or other human land use.
Broad groupings of gymnosperm and angiosperm fire-
scarred trees were compared to current forest cover from
the North American Land Cover Monitoring System
(http://www.cec.org/north-american-environmental-
atlas/land-cover-30m-2015-landsat-and-rapideye/) to
look for potential differences between the present forest
cover and the forest type sampled in the fire-scar record.
To describe the patterns and variability of fire-scarred
tree species across North America, we determined the
relative proportion of species sampled for all sites and
by ecoregion. Samples at each study site were also
grouped by phylum, genus, and species to examine pat-
terns by ecoregion.
Tree-ring fire-scar sites are present across a broad range
of gymnosperm and angiosperm dominated forests in
North America (Figure 3a). Fire-scar sites occur in 13 of
15 ecoregions, ranging from boreal forests in northern
Alaska and Canada to subtropical forests in southern
Mexico (Figure 3b, Table 1). The Northwestern Forested
Mountains ecoregion contains nearly half (46%) of the total
number of fire-scar sites (1182 sites) and has the second
highest density of sites (6.6 per 10,000 km2; Table 1). The
highest density of sites (9.5 per 10,000 km2) is in the South-
ern Semi-arid Highlands in the US/Mexico borderlands,
the second smallest ecoregion. The Northern Forests,
Taiga, Temperate Sierras, and Eastern Temperate Forests
ecoregions contain 170–258 sites (Table 1). The North
American
Deserts,
Mediterranean
California,
Hudson
Plain, Great Plains, Marine West Coast Forest, Tropical
Wet Forests, and Tundra have the fewest sites (2–73 sites).
The NAFSN includes 91 species of fire-scarred trees,
but only a small number were commonly sampled. The
10 most common species were sampled at 75% of the
sites, and 71 species (78% of the total) were sampled at
25 or fewer sites (Figure 4; Appendix S1: Table S1). Most
sites in the network (73%) contain fire-scarred gymno-
sperms from the genus Pinus (Figure 3a). Pinus species
(n = 39) account for 43% of the total tree species and
were sampled in all ecoregions except for Tundra
(Figure 4). Ponderosa pine was the most sampled species
in the NAFSN and was present at 39% of all sites (1005
out of 2562). Other gymnosperm genera represented by
three or more species include Abies, Juniperus, Tsuga, Larix,
and Picea. The following gymnosperm species are important
regionally: Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), black spruce
(Picea mariana), lodgepole pine (P. contorta), southwestern
white pine (P. strobiformis), pitch pine (P. rigida), red pine
(P. resinosa), shortleaf pine (P. echinata), bigcone Douglas-fir
(Pseudotsuga
macrocarpa),
and
Table
Mountain
pine
(P. pungens; Figure 4). Fire-scarred angiosperms were less
commonly sampled (24 species at 8% of the sites), but are
important regionally (e.g., Great Plains). Quercus was the
most-commonly sampled angiosperm genus, represented by
12 species sampled at 122 sites. Other angiosperm genera
included Populus (n = 52 sites) and Carya (n = 11 sites).

An interesting mismatch exists in multiple regions
between the general forest type of the current dominant
tree species and the species of fire-scarred trees (e.g., the
eastern United States and the southern Great Lakes
regions; Figure 3a). Although current forests in large
parts of these regions are dominated by angiosperms, the
fire-scar collections are dominated by gymnosperms. This
mismatch has multiple probable causes. First, gymno-
sperms are less common than they were historically due
to widespread logging and fire exclusion, especially
where Pinus communities were maintained by frequent
fire (Nowacki & Abrams, 2008). Second, isolated individ-
uals or patches of gymnosperms are the best recorders of
fire in angiosperm-dominated landscapes, because of the
relatively poor preservation of scars by angiosperms,
making gymnosperms the primary target for sampling
(Lafon et al., 2017; Marschall et al., 2019). A more subtle
change in species composition from fire-tolerant to fire-
intolerant gymnosperms has also occurred in response to
over a century of fire exclusion in many western forests
(Hagmann et al., 2021; Johnston et al., 2016; Margolis &
Malevich, 2016; Merschel et al., 2014; Metlen et al.,
2018). In these locations, fire scars are present on the
more fire-tolerant species, despite their reduced and
declining proportion in the current forest.
The spatial pattern of fire-scar samples in the NAFSN
is largely determined by broad biogeographic patterns of
vegetation and fire regimes. Conifers, and particularly
pines, are common in seasonally warm, surface fire-
prone ecoregions and dry topographic positions such as
exposed uplands and ridgetops (e.g., Fule et al., 2011;
Lafon et al., 2017; Marschall et al., 2019). The distribution

of dry conifer forests, which includes ponderosa pine and
the associated frequent fire regimes, is a primary reason
for the high density of sites in the Northwestern Forested
Mountains ecoregion and other ecoregions of western
North America (Figures 2 and 3). Other factors, such as
naturally low tree cover or conversion to agriculture, con-
tribute to the low sampling density in the Tundra, North
American Deserts, and Great Plains ecoregions. This
means that few fire-scar records exist for some of the
most fire-dependent vegetation on the continent, such as
the expansive grasslands of the Great Plains. Fire-scar
sites are also rare in some regions with abundant conifer
forests, such as the Eastern Temperate Forest ecoregion,
where current forests are relatively young due to centu-
ries of extensive human land use. Stumps of pine species
such as longleaf pine, which dominated the southeastern
Coastal Plain before logging, can contain numerous fire
scars (Huffman, 2006; Huffman et al., 2004; Rother et al.,
2020), but most stumps were removed or have been con-
sumed by prescribed fires, and in some stands stumps
rarely contain scars because of the historically low inten-
sity, frequent fires (Huffman et al., 2004; Rother et al.,
2020; Stambaugh, Guyette, & Marschall, 2011). Finally,
there are more fire-scar records from the Taiga and
Northern Forests than might be expected given that these
forest types are generally expected to burn at high sever-
ity and consequently produce relatively few surviving
trees to record fire (e.g., de Groot et al., 2013). In these
forests, fire scars can sometimes be found on scattered
surviving trees within high-severity patches or along fire
boundaries where fire intensity drops as a result of a fuel
break (e.g., less productive surficial deposits) or an
increase in soil moisture along the edges of peatlands or
lakes
(Bergeron,
1991;
Heon
et
al.,
2014;
Rogeau
et al., 2016). In boreal ecoregions, islands and lakeshore
landscapes are areas where mixed fire severities and fuel
breaks can result in abundant fire scars (Bergeron, 1991).
Plant traits also have a large influence on the distribu-
tion of sites and species in the NAFSN. The predomi-
nance of pine species such as ponderosa, longleaf, pitch,
and red pine among the fire-scar sample sites reflects the
presence of traits that may promote relatively frequent
and low-intensity fires (Mutch, 1970; Platt et al., 2016),
including high energy content in the litter and dead bra-
nches (Reid & Robertson, 2012), concentrations of
flammable chemicals, especially terpenes (Varner et al.,
2015), and long pyrogenic needles that minimize fuel
bulk density and fire intensity (Schwilk & Caprio, 2011).
Many pines and other conifers also have traits suiting
them to record and preserve fire scars, such as thick,
insulating bark (Keeley, 2012), and resinous wood and
secondary compounds (e.g., terpenes) that provide resis-
tance
to decay
after
scarring (Smith
et
al.,
2016;
Verrall, 1938) and postmortem. These traits enable pines
to survive and preserve fire injuries more often than angio-
sperms, leading them to be the most represented fire-
scarred trees even in angiosperm-dominated ecoregions
(e.g., the Eastern Temperate Forests; Figure 3a). Quercus
and other angiosperm genera are more susceptible to dis-
ease and rapid decay (Lafon et al., 2017; McEwan

et al., 2007). Additionally, many hardwood species lack
the long lifespans ideal for reconstruction of historical fire,
although
there
are
important
exceptions
(Shumway
et al., 2001; Stambaugh, Sparks, et al., 2011; Wolf, 2004).
The presence of fire-scarred trees across different
ecoregions, genera, and species in the NAFSN indicates
that fire was historically an important ecological compo-
nent of diverse ecosystems across North America, even in
areas where fire scars were previously thought to have
been uncommon. The dataset revealed a remarkably high
diversity of tree species that can be used for fire-scar anal-
ysis. Recent advances in the use of new species, including
Pinus species in Mexico and angiosperms in eastern
North America, indicate great potential for expanding
the fire scar network. It is likely that fire-scarred trees
and remnants exist in ecosystems and regions that lack
the widely sampled conifers, such as near-coastal forests
containing knobcone pine (P. attenuata) in California, or
sagebrush and other nonforested ecosystems where for-
ested islands contain conifers that can record fire scars.
In addition, fire-scar sites in locations that currently do
not contain forests due to recent, repeated high-severity
fires (e.g., the Southern Semi-arid Highlands) provide
important context for increasing disturbance-catalyzed
vegetation changes (Coop et al., 2020) and projected
future
changes
(Keyser
et
al.,
2020;
O’Connor
et al., 2020). Further innovative uses of tree-rings and fire
scars to address pressing vegetation questions have the
potential to further unravel complex feedbacks between
fire regimes, vegetation, and human influence in a
changing climate.
SAMPLE DEPTH
The multicentennial to millennial length of tree-ring fire-
scar records is a primary reason they are valuable for
understanding patterns and drivers of variability of fire
regimes (Marlon et al., 2012; Swetnam, 1993; Taylor
et al., 2016). The potential temporal depth of fire-scar
records across North American forests is dependent on
numerous factors previously discussed, such as species
composition and age, wood preservation, or logging and
land use history. The location of research programs
focused on fire-scar analysis, with strong roots in the
western United States and more recent expansion else-
where, also influences the sample depth of fire-history
studies. Recent high-intensity fires, or even low-intensity
fires burning during drought can kill fire-scarred trees,
can burn off fire scars on live trees, or consume dead
wood containing the oldest fire records (Heyerdahl &
McKay, 2008). Given the diversity and overlap of these
variables across North America, diversity in the length of
fire-scar records is considerable. Here, we evaluate the
NAFSN with respect to the sample depth and temporal
extent of fire history data by ecoregion to identify areas of
particular value to focus future sampling to better iden-
tify fundamental properties of North American fire
history.
Fire-scar dates range from 1237 Before the Common
Era to 2017 Common Era (CE). The earliest fire scars
were recorded in giant sequoia trees in the Sierra Nevada
of California (Swetnam, 1993; Swetnam et al., 2009). Ten
percent of the sites (243) have fire scars dating to 1500
CE or earlier (Figure 5a), most of which are located in
western ecoregions; 647 (25%) have fire scars prior to
1600 CE, including numerous sites in the Northern For-
ests and Eastern Temperate Forests ecoregions; and 1297
(51%) sites have fire scars earlier than the year 1700 CE
and span much of North America. The Northwestern
Forested Mountains has the oldest records (Figure 5a,b),
largely
due
to
giant
sequoia
sites.
Multiple
other
ecoregions demonstrate the potential for fire records back
to the 1400s (e.g., North American Deserts and the Tem-
perate Sierras), even with relatively few sites. Although
tree-ring and fire records tend to be shorter in the eastern
and northern ecoregions, the interval between the start
of the tree-ring record and the first fire scar at sites
throughout the network was similar (Figure 5b), poten-
tially indicating a property of fire-scar formation in sur-
face fire regimes that should be investigated further. The
notable exception is in the Taiga, where the length of the
fire-scar records is relatively short, even where the tree
ages extended multiple centuries. The year of the most
recent fire per site varies within and among ecoregions.
Fire declined in some ecoregions ca. 1900 CE (e.g., North-
western Forested Mountains and Northern Forests),
whereas other regions have relatively continuous fire
records up to the present (e.g., Southern Semi-arid High-
lands of Mexico; Figure 5b). When summed across the
NAFSN, a peak in the most recent fire year occurred
ca. 1900 CE, coincident with land use changes and wide-
spread
fire
exclusion.
Another
peak
ca.
2000 CE
(Figure 5c) represents uninterrupted fire regimes and
recent increases in fire activity (see Humans section for
further discussion of patterns and drivers of fire regime
changes).
Variation in the length of the fire-scar records reflects
spatial patterns of many variables that influence fire
regimes (e.g., climate, species traits, and land-use his-
tory). Records are longer in drier ecoregions where sites
and favorable tree species for fire scar sampling and
wood preservation were associated with frequent, low-
severity fire regimes (e.g., Mediterranean California,
Temperate Sierras, North American Deserts, and North-
western Forested Mountains). In contrast, records are

shorter in wetter ecoregions where decomposition is
more rapid (Eastern Temperate Forests) and where
mixed- or high-severity fire regimes are more common
(e.g., Taiga, Northern Forests). Although older records
(>400 years old) do exist in these wetter environments,
a strategic approach may be required to find them. The
difference between the length of the tree-ring record
and the fire-scar record in the Taiga may be the result
of a higher-severity regime. It could also represent a
changing fire regime driven by climate change or
changing human ignitions, or an incomplete fire record
related to the species sampled (e.g., spruce vs. pine).
There is great potential to expand the spatial and tem-
poral coverage of fire history in the Taiga and Northern
Forests (Figures 3a and 5), although challenges include
the rarity of long-lived species, remoteness, relatively
poor preservation of wood, greater potential for high-
severity fire that creates fewer fire scars, and the recent
increase in fire activity that destroys wood containing
fire scars.
The broad spatial coverage of the NAFSN back to
1700 CE and earlier provides new opportunities for
continental-scale analysis of fire regimes and drivers of
spatiotemporal variability in fire regimes. Increased cov-
erage in Canada and Alaska is ongoing and should be
prioritized to better understand these important regions
where climate change is rapidly increasing fire activity
(Whitman et al., 2019). Targeting areas with the poten-
tial for longer records (i.e., prior to 1700 CE) in eastern
North America would be beneficial for studying the
changes in ecosystems and fire regimes related to
European colonization and displacement and decline of
Native American populations and cultural practices
(Guyette et al., 2002; Kipfmueller et al., 2021; Stambaugh
et al., 2018). Characterizing the environmental condi-
tions of existing older sites in undersampled regions
(e.g., topography or geologic features such as exposed
rock that can reduce rates of wood decay or moderate fire
behavior) could be fruitful to systematically target poten-
tial new areas for older fire records. Similar systematic or
spatial modeling approaches could also be used to extend
fire records prior to the Spanish influence in southern
North America ca. 1500–1600 CE. Finally, it is important
to recognize that we are on the “tip of the iceberg” in
terms of the potential for tree-ring fire-scar records in
much of North America, even in well-sampled regions or
heavily logged forests (e.g., Taylor, 2004). For example, a
recent collection from the cold and dry Taos Plateau of
northern
New
Mexico,
a
region
with
a
long
dendropyrochronological history, is revealing some of
the longest, most-interesting fire histories in the region
(i.e., multiple sites with replicated fire scars back to the
1400s and individual scars in the 1100s).
TOPOGRAPHY
Topography is a primary influence on fire regimes and
fire-scar formation through direct effects on the physics
of fire behavior and indirectly through effects on vegeta-
tion and fuels (Agee, 1993; Rothermel, 1983). Slope,
aspect, elevation, and topographic roughness directly and
indirectly influence fire frequency, severity, and fire size
(Cansler & McKenzie, 2014; Dillon et al., 2011; Heyerdahl
et al., 2001; Iniguez et al., 2008; Kellogg et al., 2007; Kitchen,
2012; Stambaugh & Guyette, 2008; Taylor & Skinner, 1998).
For example, flatter areas on ridge tops or valley bottoms
may be more likely to burn with lower intensity or at longer
intervals (e.g., Romme & Knight, 1981; Van de Water &
North, 2010), whereas steeper slopes can increase the
probability of high-severity fire (Swanson, 1981), leaving
fewer surviving trees. Slope also affects the process and pat-
tern of fire-scar formation. In flat terrain, fire scars are com-
monly found on the leeward side of trees, in relation to the
direction of the flaming front, due to increased heat and resi-
dence time that can be explained by fluid dynamics and heat
transfer (Gutsell & Johnson, 1996; Rothermel, 1983). In
sloped terrain, fire scars commonly form on the upslope side
of the tree, regardless of the direction of the wind or the flam-
ing front (Yocom Kent & Fulé, 2015). This is due to multiple
processes, including increased convective heating and
upslope vortices, and the effect of gravity on downslope
movement of fuel that accumulates on the upslope side of
the tree and increases heat and the residence time of burn-
ing. Elevation likewise affects productivity, fuel loads, and
plant species composition, and thus influences fire intensity
and creates patterns of fire-scarred trees along elevational
gradients (Guyette et al., 2012). Topographic complexity
overall, measured at multiple spatial scales, is reflected in
spatiotemporal patterns of fire scars (Kellogg et al., 2007;
Kennedy & McKenzie, 2010; McKenzie & Kennedy, 2012).
The broad range of topographic conditions represented by
the NAFSN provides new opportunities to explore the effects
of topography on fire regimes and fire-scar formation.
We characterized topographic variables associated
with the NAFSN to identify patterns and variability in
the fire-history record across North America. We derived
topographic data for North America from a mosaic of
90-m resolution digital elevation models from Mexico,
the conterminous United States, Canada, and Alaska. For
Mexico and the conterminous United States, we used
Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data (https://
www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/). Due to a lack of high latitude
SRTM data for Canada and Alaska, we used 90-m resolu-
tion Multi-Error-Removed Improved-Terrain digital ele-
vation data (Yamazaki et al., 2017). We used the
combined elevation data to derive two additional topo-
graphic variables, slope angle and slope aspect. We then

extracted values for the three topographic variables for
the point location of all fire-scar sites. In some cases,
there may be considerable variation in topographic con-
ditions within individual fire-scar sites, and future fine-
scale
studies
of
fire-topography
interactions
using
NAFSN will be important for understanding cross-scale
influences of topographic conditions on historical fire
regimes. The analysis presented herein offers a prelimi-
nary look at topographic influences on the continental-
scale fire-scar record.
To compare the topography of sampled fire-scar sites
with the background topography of forests across North
America, we derived a topographic state space. The topo-
graphic state space of North American forests was pro-
duced by extracting elevation, slope angle, and slope
aspect from 330,000 random points within the MODIS
North American forested area (described in Vegetation
section). The topographic variables were then compared
between NAFSN sites and the random points to identify
the topographic conditions with relatively high or low
numbers of fire scar sites.
Tree-ring fire-scar sites in North America are found
across a broad range of topographic settings. Fire scars
are present in flat and steep terrain, across all slope
aspects, and from sea level to more than 4000 m above
sea level (asl; Figure 6a). When compared to the back-
ground forested landscape, fire-scar sites are found in
greater abundance on steeper slopes (between 10 and
30) and at higher elevations (between 1000 and 3000 m
asl, Figure 6a,b). Fire-scar sites in low-elevation, flat, for-
ested areas of eastern and northern North America are
rare in the NAFSN, although there were large areas of
forest in this topographic setting (Figure 6b). Fire-scar
sites are located more often on southerly aspects and less
on
northerly
aspects
than
North
American
forests
(Figure 6c).
The topography of forests and fire-scar sites indicates
important variability within and among North American
ecoregions. Fire-scar sites at relatively high elevations are
concentrated in four ecoregions in southwestern North
America: Mediterranean California, North American
Deserts, Southern Semi-arid Highlands, and the Temper-
ate Sierras (Figure 7). There is a unique bimodal distribu-
tion in the elevation of fire-scar sites in the Northern
Forests ecoregion, which represents low-elevation sites in
the glaciated Great Lakes region and ridgetop sites in the
Appalachian Mountains of the northeastern United States.
The slope angle of fire scar sites (typically between 0 and
30) is relatively similar among ecoregions, except where
steeper terrain was rare (e.g., Taiga and Hudson Plain,
Figure 7). The slope aspect of fire-scar sites is highly vari-
able among ecoregions. The pattern of fire-scar sites on
south-facing slopes in the full network (Figure 6c) is
concentrated in four ecoregions: Northwestern Forested
Mountains, Northern Forests, Temperate Sierras, and Hud-
son Plain (Figure 7). In contrast, the North American
Deserts, Mediterranean California, Southern Semi-arid
Highlands, and the Great Plains show the opposite pattern,
higher concentrations of fire-scar sites on north-facing
slopes when compared to the slope aspect of forests in those
ecoregions.
The topographic patterns and variability in the
NAFSN are a function of (1) the pattern of fire-scarred
trees on the landscape and (2) where fire scars were sam-
pled. It is not possible to determine whether patterns in a
certain topographic variable indicate a pattern in the
location of fire-scarred trees or a pattern in the sampling;
both are present in the data. For example, in some
ecoregions (e.g., Northwestern Forested Mountains) some
of the wetter, north-facing slopes were historically more
likely to burn at higher severity or longer intervals and
have fewer fire-scarred trees; conversely the adjacent
drier, south-facing slopes were less likely to burn at high-
severity and have more fire-scarred trees (e.g., Margolis &
Balmat,
2009;
Marschall
et
al.,
2016;
Taylor
&
Skinner, 1998). In this example, if the goal of sampling is
to capture the longest record with the most fire scars in
an area, then a south-facing slope would be preferred.
Random or spatially systematic samples of fire scars
across large, topographically diverse areas (e.g., Farris
et al., 2010; Heyerdahl et al., 2011; Merschel et al., 2018;
Scholl & Taylor, 2010) can be used to objectively charac-
terize and better assess topographic variables associated
with fire-scar formation. Spatially systematic samples can
also illuminate cross-scale patterns on landscapes (Falk
et
al.,
2007;
Kernan
&
Hessl,
2010;
McKenzie
&
Kennedy, 2012). Increased understanding of topographic
controls on fire-scar formation at multiple scales would
increase confidence in the extrapolation of fire-scar
derived fire regime metrics across topographically com-
plex landscapes.
The ecoregion-level analysis revealed interesting pat-
terns of variability in topography associated with fire-scar
sites. These likely reflect regional differences in the pat-
terns and drivers of fire regimes (e.g., influences of cli-
mate, vegetation, and humans). For example, in cooler,
wetter, flatter environments, such as the Great Lakes
sites within the Northern Forests ecoregion, topography
likely amplified human impacts on fire regimes at south
and southwest-facing sites that were edaphically more
amenable to frequent surface fire (Larson et al., 2021).
North American Deserts ecoregion, fire-scar sites are con-
centrated at circa 2500 m asl, 1000 m higher than the
peak density of forests. This likely represents the conflu-
ence of multiple bio-climatic phenomena unique to this
semi-arid region that affect fire regimes and tree growth.
ECOSPHERE

These relatively high-elevation fire-scar sites indicate the
zone where moisture is sufficient to produce enough fuel
to support recurring fire, yet still sufficiently arid to dry
out the fuels so they can burn frequently (Martin, 1982;
North et al., 2009). In addition, forests located below this
zone of peak density of NAFSN sites may have fewer
trees that can be crossdated, because of abundant missing
or false rings associated with opportunistic growth during
the summer North American monsoon rains (Meko &
Baisan, 2001).
The topographic patterns revealed in the NAFSN
have practical utility to guide future research. Gaps in

topographic space may indicate targets for future sam-
pling and may represent new, unrecognized fire regimes
(e.g., within the under-sampled flat, low-elevation forests,
especially in dissected coastal regions, or on different
aspects). Some of these areas may be where human
populations are currently concentrated; while this creates
challenges related to finding old wood with fire scars,
information on historical fires in these areas will be
important for contextualizing the growing fire problems
in the wildland urban interface. Ecoregional patterns of
topographic variables where fire scars are most likely to
be found, or refinements of these patterns for a specific
study area, can also be used to systematically map and
model potential fire-scar locations and develop predictive
frameworks for hypothesis testing. Future research could
also link topography and fire regime characteristics
(e.g., fire frequency or severity) based on mechanisms of
fire behavior that were not part of this synthesis. For
example, topographic controls may be superseded by
extreme fire behavior in a warming climate, leading to
“no-analog” patterns of fire frequency and severity being
reflected
in
the
fire-scar
record
(McKenzie
&
Kennedy, 2012). Capitalizing on the new network and its
diversity in fire regimes and topography could provide
valuable insights on the role of topographic variability in
historical and future fire occurrence and severity, espe-
cially in the context of changing fuel structures and
warming climate.
CLIMATE
Climate is an important driver of fire regimes that regu-
lates fuels and fire behavior on time scales ranging from
seasons within individual years to millennia. Weather
and climate variations directly influence the length and
severity of the fire season (Parisien et al., 2014; Parks
et al., 2018; Westerling, 2016; Westerling et al., 2006), the
progression of individual fires (Wang et al., 2017), fire fre-
quency (Guyette et al., 2012), and the variability and effi-
ciency
of
lightning
ignitions
(Romps
et
al.,
2014;
Veraverbeke et al., 2017). Climatic influences can also
include lagging relationships that develop over multiple
years. For example, antecedent wet conditions in fuel-
limited systems often result in greater abundance and
continuity of herbaceous and fine fuels that increase the
probability of fire spread in subsequent dry years (Dewar
et al., 2021; Howard et al., 2021; Littell et al., 2009, 2018;
Margolis et al., 2017; Pohl et al., 2006; Swetnam &
Betancourt, 1998). Prolonged, multiseason or multiyear
drought can also increase fire occurrence in cooler, wet-
ter, climate-limited systems (e.g., subalpine and boreal
forests; Flannigan et al., 2009; Gedalof et al., 2005;
Schoennagel et al., 2007). Over longer time scales of cen-
turies to millennia, climate affects not only fire regimes
(Marlon et al., 2008; Marlon et al., 2012; Swetnam, 1993),
but also the spatial distribution of vegetation itself
(e.g., Nolan et al., 2018), thus modulating the fuelscapes
that fires burn. For example, sparser fuels in a warmer
drier future may reduce total area burned in some
regions, even though wildfire is forecasted to increase
globally (Kennedy et al., 2021; Mckenzie & Littell, 2017).
Increased understanding of the effects of ocean–atmosphere
teleconnections (e.g., the El Niño–Southern Oscillation;
Beckage et al., 2003; Swetnam & Betancourt, 1990, 1998;
Trouet et al., 2010; Yocom et al., 2010) and jet stream dynam-
ics (Wahl et al., 2019) on fire regimes can provide forecasting
opportunities and mechanisms to model future climate-
driven changes in fire regimes (Westerling et al., 2003).
To enhance our mechanistic understanding of how cli-
mate influences fire regimes across the continent, we sum-
marized the climate space of North American forests,
compared this to the climate space of NAFSN sites and to
that of modern fires recorded by satellites. The climate-
space analysis was conducted at continental and eco-
regional scales (Figure 3b). Using a state-space or climate-
space approach, as we did with topography, allowed us to
better understand climate domains that may be more or
less common in the NAFSN than would be expected from
the background climate of forests. The characterization of
modern fires enabled us to ask whether there is a consis-
tent climate domain that supports surface-fire regimes
across North America, and whether that has changed
through time. We acknowledge that comparisons between
tree-ring fire-scar sites—areas that have burned in the
past—and satellite-derived fire records are imperfect due
to limitations of both records (e.g., Farris et al., 2010), but
think that it is informative.
We analyzed four annual climate variables that influ-
ence modern fire occurrence: (1) mean annual tempera-
ture
(in
degrees
Celsius;
MAT),
(2)
mean
annual
precipitation (in millimeters; MAP), (3) the Hargreaves
climatic moisture deficit (in millimeters; CMD), and
(4) actual evapotranspiration (in millimeters; AET) calcu-
lated as the Hargreaves reference evapotranspiration
minus CMD. We used ClimateNA (Wang et al., 2016) to
extract 1-km resolution annual data for the period 1981–
2010 and calculated mean values of each variable to rep-
resent climatic normals. We square-root transformed
MAP because the raw values were highly skewed. We
then extracted the climate normals for these four vari-
ables at each of the 2562 NAFSN sites to compare with
335,375 randomly selected points in forested areas and
the centroids of 366,581 satellite detected modern forest
fire perimeters (see Appendix S1 for data sources used to
assemble the modern North American fire atlas).

MARGOLIS ET AL.

To represent and compare the climate space of North
American forests and the NAFSN we plotted MAP versus
MAT and AET versus CMD for the random points in the
forest layer and the fire scar sites. We made similar com-
parisons for each of the 11 individual ecoregions with >2
fire-scar sites. We used a two-dimensional kernel density
estimation to calculate probability density functions for
the random “background” forest points. To facilitate
comparison between ecoregions, density estimates were
scaled from 0 to 1, with the value 1 representing the area
in the climate space with the highest density of points.
Additionally, we drew convex hulls enclosing 95% of the
fire-scar sites and modern forest fire sites.
The climate space of the NAFSN is largely representa-
tive of the core climate space of existing forested areas
(Figure 8a; Appendix S1: Figure S4). The major gaps in
the NAFSN are in the hottest (MAT > 18C) and driest
(MAP < 20 mm/year, CMD > 1000 mm/year) climates
(Figure 8a; Appendix S1: Figure S4), as well as in areas
with AET >1000 mm/year, likely corresponding to the
southeastern United States and southern Mexico. Among
ecoregions, there is variability in the degree to which the
fire-scar sites represent the climate space of forests
(Figure 8). For example, fire scar collections represent
the majority of the climate domain of the Northwestern
Forested Mountains, Eastern Temperate Forests, North-
ern Forests, and Taiga ecoregions. In contrast, fire scars
are lacking from portions of the forested climate space in
the Great Plains, Marine West Coast Forest, North Amer-
ican Deserts, Southern Semi-arid Highlands, and Tem-
perate Sierras (Figure 8; Appendix S1: Figure S4). In most
cases (e.g., Temperate Sierras and Great Plains), fire scars
were not sampled in the warmest range of forests. In
other cases, sampling was concentrated at the climatic
edge of the range of forests (e.g., Southern Semi-arid
Highlands). It is worth noting that the climate space of
the NAFSN extends beyond the climate space of existing
forests in the Southern Semi-arid Highlands (Figure 8h;
Appendix S1: Figure S4), and to a lesser degree in the
Temperate Sierras. This may indicate recent forest loss
due to high-severity fire (see discussion in Vegetation sec-
tion), or that fire scars were found in areas with little rep-
resentation regionally, for example, small high-elevation
bands of forest in the Temperate Sierras.
The core climate space of modern fires overlaps with
the
fire-scar
record
of
historical
fires
(Figure
8;
Appendix S1: Figure S4). The exception is in warmer cli-
mates (e.g., MAT > 20C), where there are modern fires
but few fire-scar sites. This is likely due to undersampling
of fire scars in these warmer climates and ecoregions
(e.g., Tropical Wet and Tropical Dry Forests), but in some
locations could also indicate changing fire regimes, or dif-
ferences in fire regimes recorded by fire scars versus the
modern satellite records. Despite the differences in the
warmer climate space, there is broad similarity between
the core climate spaces of North American forests, histor-
ical fire regimes represented by fire-scar sites, and mod-
ern fires (Figure 8; Appendix S1: Figure S4). This
suggests a common range of climate variables associated
with fire occurrence, both historically and for modern
fires. There are also interesting differences, particularly
within and among ecoregions, between historical and
modern fires. For example, there is less overlap between
modern fires and NAFSN sites in the Northern Forests,
Eastern Temperate Forests, and Semi-Arid Highlands
ecoregions compared to other ecoregions. These findings
suggest abundant possibilities for future research, from
analyses of fire-climate associations utilizing the new,
continental data set, to consideration of changes in the
driving factors of fire regimes over time, to opportunities
for expanding the network via more intensive and exten-
sive
sampling
of
underrepresented
climates
and
ecoregions.
The overlap between the core climate space of forests,
modern fires, and historical fires in North America is
broadly consistent with previous work exploring the cli-
mate space of fire regimes; while many terrestrial vegeta-
tion types can support fire, fire is most abundant where
temperature and moisture gradients optimize a combina-
tion of fuel availability, flammability, and ignition
(Archibald et al., 2013; Guyette et al., 2012; Krawchuk &
Moritz,
2011;
Parisien
&
Moritz,
2009;
Whitman
et al., 2015). However, the NAFSN tends toward lower
values of moisture and temperature (and CMD and AET)
than that represented by the full spectrum of North
American forests (Figure 8a). The NAFSN sites in the
drier climate space are likely more conducive to fire if
fuel is not limiting. The low number of NAFSN sites in
the warmer portion of the climate space of forests is
likely due to a combination of factors. The highest con-
centrations of these undersampled, warmer, forested cli-
mate spaces occur in lower latitude subtropical forest
ecoregions in Mexico (Figures 3b and 8a). Mexico is an
expanding frontier for dendrochronology (e.g., Arizpe
et al., 2020; Cerano-Paredes et al., 2019; Fulé et al., 2005;
Yocom Kent et al., 2017) and should be a focus of future
work for multiple reasons, but also contains climatic con-
ditions and species where crossdating can be challenging,
where human land use has removed old trees that may
have had evidence of fire, or where fires within the life
spans of trees were infrequent to nonexistent. In addition,
parts of Mexico may have similarities to the future cli-
mates, vegetation, and fire regimes for more northern lat-
itudes (Gomez-Pineda et al., 2020). Because we used
modern climate data to describe the climate space of the
NAFSN, it is also possible that some differences between
ECOSPHERE
21 of 36

modern and historical fires could be related to climate
shifts to warmer conditions compared to prior centuries
when the fires recorded in the NAFSN were burning.
Lastly, microsite climates that were conducive to histori-
cal fires and fire scars, such as dry ridges in otherwise
mesic areas, may not be reflected by the coarse climate
data in the analysis.
Our climate analyses highlight interesting patterns
and tantalizing research potential, as well as potential
limitations of the NAFSN. Insights provided by the fire-
scar network have applicability primarily across the sam-
pled range of forest types and climate spaces it represents.
This calls for research efforts to fill data gaps (e.g., sites in
warmer or wetter climates), but acknowledges that some
regions and forest types may not contain tree-ring fire-scar
records, necessitating other approaches such as paleo-
charcoal (Girardin et al., 2019), forest age structure-derived
fire history (Drobyshev et al., 2017; Johnson & Larsen,
1991; Van Wagner, 1978), or the use of precisely dateable
anatomical indicators of fire exposure (Arbellay et al.,

2014a, 2014b). We also note that we characterized the
NAFSN in the context of contemporary climate space,
whereas historical fires may have burned under different
climate conditions centuries ago. Next steps include build-
ing upon existing tree-ring fire-climate network analyses
(e.g., Kitzberger et al., 2007; Trouet et al., 2010) to conduct
regional and continental assessments of the historical cli-
matic drivers of fire using historical climate data, such as
the tree-ring based North American Drought Atlas (Cook
et al., 2004) or the many new seasonal paleo-climatic
reconstructions (e.g., Stahle et al., 2020). As complete fire
chronologies from NAFSN sites become available for anal-
ysis, there is great potential to develop a deeper under-
standing of the relationships between climate, ecoregional
variation, and fire regimes.
HUMANS
Humans have influenced fire regimes across the globe for
millennia (Bond & Keeley, 2005; Bowman et al., 2009,
2011; Guyette et al., 2002). In North America, evidence of
human presence extends to the Pleistocene with the earli-
est evidence during the Last Glacial Maximum circa
24 kyr BP (Bourgeon et al., 2017). Throughout the Holo-
cene, Indigenous peoples managed ecosystems with fire
for multiple benefits, affecting pyrodiversity and biodiver-
sity (Bowman et al., 2016; Huffman, 2013; Lake &
Christianson, 2019; Roos et al., 2021; Stewart, 2002). In
some places, Indigenous fire use has adapted to changing
ecological, climatological, and social factors through the
present, whereas in others, fire use declined due to Indig-
enous population decline, land dispossession, and cul-
tural
suppression
after
European
contact
(Lake
&
Christianson, 2019). European exploration and settle-
ment altered fire regimes via land clearing, intensive agri-
culture, and livestock grazing, and as a consequence, fire
regime changes have continued with increased industri-
alization and fire exclusion policies (Borman, 2005;
Guyette et al., 2002; Pyne, 1997; Waito et al., 2018).
Humans have profoundly modified basic components of
fire regimes, including fire frequency, ignition source,
seasonality, size, and severity, at a continental scale
(Balch et al., 2017) to the point of overriding fire–climate
relationships in many areas (Chavardès et al., 2018;
Higuera et al., 2015; Parks et al., 2015; Platt et al., 2015;
Syphard et al., 2017; Wahl et al., 2019). Although the effect
of humans on fire regimes is complex and highly variable
across North America, evidence suggests that contempo-
rary anthropogenic activities generally limit fire activity
across much of the continent (Parisien et al., 2016).
We explored the potential human influences on fire
regimes
recorded
in
the
NAFSN
in
terms
of
(1) Indigenous territories and influences, (2) spatiotempo-
ral variability in human population, (3) the timing of
land use transitions, and (4) the last fire year recorded by
fire scars. We use these topics to identify patterns of
human-related processes that affected past fire regimes,
influence current patterns of fire and vegetation, and will
continue to affect future fire regimes.
Across North America, fire-scar records commonly
pre-date European colonization, back to a time when a
complex geography of intersecting Indigenous territories
existed (Larson et al., 2021; Stephens et al., 2003;
Swetnam et al., 2016). We mapped a spatial database of
>600 North American Indigenous territories (www.
native-land.ca, Figure 9a) to generate hypotheses related
to Indigenous influences on fire regimes. Many territories
overlap in space and time under an ongoing dynamic of
cultural change. In some cases, fire-scarred trees recorded
fires that occurred prior to European contact and some
surely reflect fire use by Indigenous peoples across these
territories, in practices related to hunting, agricultural
land clearing, culturally important plants, pest manage-
ment, warfare and signaling, and clearing areas for travel
(e.g., Huffman, 2013; Lewis & Ferguson, 1988; Pyne, 1997;
Roos et al., 2021). The majority of records, however, cover
time periods of Indigenous displacement and increased
Euro-American influences prior to the 20th century
(Figure 5). Fire regime changes coincident with this transi-
tion are often indicative of anthropogenic factors that may
override the climatic influence. Post-colonial fire regimes
may contrast with earlier periods due to European influ-
ences or mirror historical conditions through the adoption
of Indigenous land use practices by settlers (Pyne, 2000;
Roos et al., 2021).
Fire-scar sites exist across a range of human popula-
tion densities before and after European contact. Regions
with
the
highest
documented
pre-contact
human
populations are located on the west coast and in south
central Mexico and smaller areas with high densities
including Chesapeake Bay, upstate New York, and the
upper Rio Grande Valley (Driver & Massey, 1957;
Figure 9b). Inland Alaska, northern Canada, the Ohio
River Valley, and the Great Basin are thought to repre-
sent the regions of lowest pre-contact populations. Since
European arrival, increases in human population have
largely
been
focused
in
the
eastern
half
of
the
United States, southern Canada, the west coast of North
America, and scattered regions in the western and central
United States (CIESIN, 2016, Figure 9c). Many areas with
high current human populations have a history of fire
recorded in the NAFSN, indicating the potential for fire
burning through modern communities, as we are increas-
ingly observing (e.g., recent large wildfires in California,
Oregon, British Colombia, and Tennessee). In this
ECOSPHERE
23 of 36

context, fire-scar data will be increasingly informative for
urban planning, land management, and health and safety
concerns (e.g., smoke exposure, wildfire risk mitigation).
Increasing populations and associated anthropogenic
activities continue to influence and modify fire regimes,
both directly through the ignition and suppression of
fires, and indirectly through the alteration of the amount
and spatial arrangement of fuels.
Major human demographic changes may be reflected
in the fire-scar record. We mapped the spatiotemporal

variability of the timing of major land use transitions
across North America (Figure 9d) to frame hypotheses
regarding fire regime changes that could be tested with
the NAFSN. The map was created using direct reports
or by proximal information including: land cession
dates, treaty dates from Canada, railway establishment
timing from Canada and the United States, post office
establishment dates from the western United States,
timing of smallpox outbreaks across North America,
and timing of European settlement or disruption of tra-
ditional
Indigenous
practices
(see
Appendix
S1:
Table S2 for data sources). This land-use transition map
reflects the complex historical events that followed ini-
tial European contact in the late-15th century. Contours
were interpolated by inverse distance weighting using
multiple data sources at a 100-km2 spatial resolution. In
cases of overlapping lines of evidence, the minimum
date was selected.
Broadly, current-day Mexico was the first area to
experience widespread land-use transition, in an already
densely populated area, during the establishment of New
Spain throughout the 16th century (Figure 9b,d). The
gradual establishment of colonies by Spain along the East
Coast and Gulf of Mexico also occurred farther north in
eastern North America by England and France in the
17th century, with subsequent intrusions within the con-
tinent in the Midwest and Great Lakes. While European
settlement in the western half of what is now the
United States and Canada mostly came later (as recently
as the early 20th century in some localities), substantial
areas of Spanish colonization predated this westward
wave of establishment, notably in parts of what is now
California and the southwestern United States. In addi-
tion, impacts on Indigenous peoples and associated fire
regimes generally preceded the advancing front of settle-
ment and associated colonial policies of relocation, accul-
turation, and fire exclusion, primarily through the spread
of introduced diseases that decimated populations and
entire cultures before settlers arrived in large numbers
(Jones,
2017;
Lake
&
Christianson,
2019;
Murphy
et al., 2007). Northern areas were generally the most
recently settled by non-Indigenous peoples, although
these settlements were relatively small and sparse. The
land-use transition map attempts to characterize phe-
nomena affecting patterns of interactions with the land
(and by extension, fire regimes), although at any given
location many other factors or events may have affected
fire regimes through time (e.g., agrarian reforms, urban
development, and fire suppression policies). Future stud-
ies of human effects on historical fire regimes in North
America could consider (i.e., map) these and other factors
to paint a more complete picture of fire regime change
through time.
To explore one aspect of the spatiotemporal variabil-
ity of human influence on North American fire regimes,
fire regime decline, we mapped the year of the most
recent fire scar recorded by the NAFSN sites. We
acknowledge multiple limitations of using this metric.
First, it may not represent the actual last fire at a site,
because of the wide range of fire-scar sample collection
years, or different sampling strategies (e.g., dead wood
vs. live trees) in the NAFSN, which can result in different
lengths of tree-ring records. In other cases, the last fire
date may be a modern fire that was purposely sampled
for corroboration with fire-scar records (e.g., Farris
et al., 2010). Therefore, these data may not always repre-
sent the actual timing of a major disruption in the fire
regime, such as the onset of 20th century fire exclusion.
We did, however, find general patterns in the aggregate
of all last fire dates in relatively large spatial areas
(10,000-km2 hexels, minimum of 2 sites per hexel). We
then calculated the median year of the most recent fire
scar as a measure of central tendency within these
hexels.
The date of the most recent fire scar varies spatially
across North America. The contrast at the US/Mexico
border is perhaps the most obvious feature (Figure 9e),
which can be attributed to different land use history pri-
marily related to the timing of intensive livestock grazing
(Fulé et al., 2012). Fires were largely eliminated by 1900
throughout the southwestern United States primarily due
to widespread overgrazing that removed fine fuels and
inhibited fire spread (Allen, 2007; Dewar et al., 2021; Fulé
et al., 2012), while fires continued to burn across many
sites in northern Mexico until the mid-1900s, and in some
cases without disruption to the present (Arizpe et al., 2020;
Fule et al., 2011; Heyerdahl & Alvarado, 2003; Meunier
et al., 2014; Poulos et al., 2013; Skinner et al., 2008; Yocom
Kent et al., 2017). It was not until the redistribution of
lands to communal ejidos in 1934 and 1940 (Lopez &
Bernardino Mata, 1992) and subsequent increased live-
stock grazing, that fire frequency decreased across many
sites in Mexico (Heyerdahl & Alvarado, 2003; Poulos
et al., 2013). There are also concentrations of most recent
fire scars ca. 1900 in the western United States and the
Great Lakes region. The latter is likely related to the
restriction of Indigenous populations coincident with
Euro-American settlement (Kipfmueller et al., 2021). Inter-
estingly, in some regions where the most recent fire scar
dates are close to the present, European settlement was
the earliest (in the 15th–17th centuries); this encompasses
areas with intact traditional fire use (e.g., in Mexico; Martí-
nez-Torres et al., 2016) or where prescribed and resource
benefit fires are a priority for local stakeholders (e.g., the
southeastern and south-central United States; Rother
et al., 2020). Future research using the full fire-scar record
ECOSPHERE
25 of 36

will help identify the timing of shifting fire regimes,
including increasing fire (e.g., Stambaugh et al., 2018), and
the role of humans, or other factors in driving these
changes.
The NAFSN shows tremendous potential to advance
our understanding of the roles that humans have played
in shaping fire regimes and ecosystems of North America.
Local to regional studies have demonstrated the ability to
use fire-scar data to identify human influence on histori-
cal fire regimes (Guiterman et al., 2019; Hoffman
et al., 2017; Huffman et al., 2004; Kitchen, 2015; Roos
et al., 2021; Stambaugh et al., 2018; Swetnam et al., 2016;
Taylor et al., 2016). To better understand the anthropo-
genic component of historical fire regimes, it is necessary
to disentangle the spatiotemporal variability caused by
climate and vegetation, the other major drivers of fire
regime change, from that of human activities (Bowman
et al., 2020; Fulé et al., 2012; Whitlock & Knox, 2002).
With this network, new opportunities become available
for the multidisciplinary examination of historical fire
regimes and their associated cultural phenomena. The
key to disentangling the influence on fire regimes of
humans from climate lies in the emerging methodologies
that allow the analysis and interpretation of tree-ring
based fire histories in the context of other forms of knowl-
edge and historical ecology data. Specifically, these include
multiproxy approaches that incorporate different lines of
evidence of human land use (e.g., palaeoecological and
archeological data; Whitlock et al., 2010, Carter et al., 2021),
multidisciplinary approaches that draw on expertise from,
among others, anthropology and human geography, and
collaborative methodologies that engage directly with
Indigenous fire knowledge keepers and scholars (Lake
et al., 2017; Roos et al., 2021). Recognizing the nuanced con-
tributions of people to fire regimes across North America
will rely on future research that is place-based, scale-appro-
priate, and reflects the spatiotemporal variability of the rela-
tionship between people and fire (McWethy et al., 2013).
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE
DIRECTIONS
The NAFSN and our broad analyses of the key influences
on fire regimes, (1) vegetation, (2) topography, (3) climate,
and (4) humans, provide a foundation and framework for
many new opportunities to advance fire research. Future
analyses of the NAFSN will facilitate increased under-
standing of the patterns and drivers of spatiotemporal
variability
in
fire
regimes,
including
relationships
between fire, climate, humans, topography, and vegeta-
tion at local to continental scales. Great potential exists
for
future
analyses
of
the
full
fire-scar
data
sets
containing >300,000 annually to sub-annually resolved
fire records over the past several hundred years. These
newly compiled data will provide insights into important
fire-related topics, including: climate influences on fire
regimes (Guyette et al., 2012; Kitzberger et al., 2017);
changing fire severity and fire-catalyzed vegetation type
conversion (Coop et al., 2020; Guiterman et al., 2018);
cross-scale spatial analyses (Falk et al., 2007; Kennedy &
McKenzie, 2010), including area burned reconstructions
that can place current fire trends and the fire deficit in a
multicentury context (Farris et al., 2010; Swetnam, Falk,
Hessl, & Farris, 2011); broader context on topographic
controls of fire occurrence and severity (Heyerdahl
et al., 2001; Kellogg et al., 2007); and deeper insights into
human influences on past, present, and future fire
regimes, including Indigenous burning and European
settlement (Howard et al., 2021; Stambaugh et al., 2018;
Taylor et al., 2016). Fire scars can also record sub-annual
(or seasonal) variability in fire occurrence, an under-
studied topic that can inform seasonal fire–climate rela-
tionships
(Margolis
et
al.,
2017),
identify
human
influences
on
fire
regimes
(Kitchen,
2015;
Rother
et al., 2020; Seklecki et al., 1996), and possibly detect
other patterns, drivers, and trends related to modern
changes in fire season (e.g., Westerling et al., 2006). Fur-
thermore, analysis of data in the fire-scar network can
reveal previously unrecognized changes in other vari-
ables and processes, such as climate, vegetation, or
human land use (Swetnam & Brown, 2011), because of
strong
interdependencies
with
fire
regimes
(Taylor
et al., 2016).
The potential to build upon the NAFSN and collect
new fire scar samples to fill important data gaps identi-
fied in this paper may have a shrinking window of oppor-
tunity.
Tree-ring
fire-scar
collections
and
analyses
commonly are limited more by institutional factors and
resources, such as the limited pool of skilled scientists
and resources, than by the availability of fire-scarred
trees. Nonetheless, there is urgency to sample and extract
tree-ring records of fire from the great, ephemeral, old-
wood in “unread” forest libraries across North America.
Increasing fire activity, climate- and insect-induced mor-
tality of old trees, logging, decay, and development are
erasing old tree-ring fire records that have existed for cen-
turies. These threats highlight the need to collect and
securely archive tree-ring records of fire, as well as other
tree-ring records, including for climate or forest stand
reconstructions, which will be essential for future studies.
Gaps in geographic, ecoregional, or climatic and topo-
graphic state space identified in this paper can be the
beginning of a road map for fire-scar collections to fill
spatial, temporal, and knowledge gaps before the records
are lost.

DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT
The fire-scar site metadata (Margolis & Guiterman, 2022)
analyzed in this study are available in a USGS data
release
(https://doi.org/10.5066/P9PT90QX).
The
full
tree-ring fire-scar records for the NAFSN sites have vary-
ing stages of availability. The current repository for tree-
ring fire-scar data is the IMPD, where 800 sites in the
NAFSN are publicly available and >300 additional sites
are being processed as part of the NASFN effort (https://
doi.org/10.25921/pef0-zz47).
The
compilation
of
the
NAFSN has engaged the broad community of fire-history
researchers to expand the data available through the
IMPD, which is ongoing. The site-level metadata struc-
ture that we developed, which links directly to the spe-
cific tree-ring fire-scar data files, has increased the utility
of the fire-scar data for network analyses. We also recom-
mend that all future submissions to the IMPD contain
tree-level metadata, which greatly expands the research
potential by facilitating re-grouping of fire-scar trees as
appropriate for different research questions. By utilizing
the expanded NAFSN, researchers and others (e.g., fire
managers) will have better access to locally relevant data
on fire history, including fire-regime metrics, or area and
species sampled. We are also developing new tools and
resources that build on existing software (e.g., Malevich
et al., 2018; Sutherland et al., 2014) to facilitate online
exploration, data queries and extraction, and analyses of
the IMPD fire-history archive to promote the use within
and beyond ecological fields of study.
