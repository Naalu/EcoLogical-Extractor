Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in the
southwestern United States historically were more
open and park-like, with a stand structure main-
tained through frequent,
low-intensity fires
(Covington and Moore 1994, Swetnam and Baisan
2003).
Frequent fires maintained grass cover
(Covington 2000) and created a clumped, uneven-
aged forest dominated by large,old ponderosa pine
trees (Mast et al. 1999). However, fire suppression,
livestock grazing,and logging over the past century
have led to increased tree density, smaller mean
tree diameter, and reduced understory plant pro-
ductivity, as well as a greatly increased hazard of
stand-replacing fire (Moore et al. 1999).
Recent
management efforts have focused on thinning and
burning in these forests to create stands more simi-
lar to those believed to have dominated the area
historically (Fulé et al.2001). As the move to imple-
ment these forest restoration projects over broader
areas grows, understanding how such treatments
affect wildlife during and immediately after their
implementation becomes an important question.
The historical range of Merriam’s wild turkey
(Meleagris gallopavo merriami) largely coincides
with that of ponderosa pine (Ligon 1946,Shaw and
Mollohan 1992). As a result, restoration treatments
in this habitat could alter a number of habitat
parameters important for turkeys, including cover,

Ponderosa pine restoration and turkey
roost site use in northern Arizona
Steven L. Martin, Tad C. Theimer, and Peter Z. Fulé
Abstract Ecological restoration of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in the southwestern
United States is a relatively new, adaptive management practice that potentially alters
wildlife habitat during and immediately after restoration treatments.  To determine
whether restoration treatments affected Merriam’s wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo mer-
riami) use of roost sites, we relocated 91 of 120 turkey roost sites that originally had been
mapped in 1985 in the Uinkaret Mountains of northern Arizona.  We compared current
turkey use of historical roost sites in stands that had been thinned and burned between
1995 and 2002 to adjacent (<800 m away) and distant (>800 m) stands.  In 2002, 23 his-
torical roosts were still in use, and in 2003, 13 were still in use, 5 of which had not been
used in 2002.  The number of historical roost sites still in use among treated, adjacent,
and distant stands did not differ from that expected based on the total number of histori-
cal roosts in each stand type.  We also searched for new roosts while traveling between
historical roost sites and found 2.2 new roosts per hour searched in treated stands, 1.5 in
adjacent stands, and 1.0 in distant stands.  As expected, active roost sites in treated stands
had significantly lower basal area, fewer stems, and less canopy cover compared to roost
sites in untreated areas.  However, roost trees in treated and untreated stands did not dif-
fer in diameter at breast height, height, or distance to the lower limb, indicating that treat-
ment did not affect these characteristics.  Several factors unique to our study site may
have influenced our results: treated areas represented only 5% of total habitat available,
treatments occurred primarily on flat areas and not on ridges or slopes, and treatments
were implemented over several years.
Key words Meleagris gallopavo, Pinus ponderosa, restoration, roost site

food abundance and diversity, and roost-site avail-
ability. Restoration treatments involve thinning of
small-diameter trees followed by low-intensity sur-
face fires, both of which reduce stem density, basal
area, and canopy cover, 3 attributes often reported
in descriptions of turkey roost sites (Hoffman 1968,
Boeker and Scott 1969, Mackey 1984, Mollohan et
al. 1995,Wakeling and Rogers 1998).
The largest forest restoration experimental site in
the southwestern United States (Mount Trumbull)
was initiated in an area where Merriam’s turkeys
were successfully introduced in the 1960s. A sur-
vey of turkey roost sites was conducted in this area
in 1985 (Moeller et al. 1985), and restoration treat-
ments were implemented between 1995–2000,
providing a unique opportunity to compare how
use of historical roost sites was affected by restora-
tion treatments. Our objectives were to 1) deter-
mine the number of historical roost sites still in use
in treated and untreated areas, 2) search for new
roost sites in treated and untreated areas, and 3)
determine whether roost trees in treated and
untreated areas differed in diameter at breast height
(DBH), height, or distance to lowest branch. Our
null hypothesis was that there would be no differ-
ence in the proportion of historical roosts still in
use or of new roosts in treated and untreated areas.
Study area
The study site occupied an “island” of approxi-
mately 6,900 ha of ponderosa pine forest mixed
with gambel oak (Quercus gambelli) and New
Mexican locust (Robinia neomexicana) that rises
out of surrounding desert. It was located in the
Grand Canyon’s Parashant National Monument in
the Uinkaret Mountains of northwestern Arizona
between the Colorado River and the Utah border
(36o20′N, 113o10′W, and was managed by the
Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Merriam’s wild
turkeys were initially introduced into this area in
1961.
The population was isolated from other
turkey populations due to surrounding unsuitable
desert habitat. Between 1995 and 2002, selected
areas were treated with thinning and low-intensity
burning prescriptions designed to emulate the his-
torical forest composition and structure that pre-
vailed prior to disruption of the frequent fire
regime, livestock grazing, and logging beginning
circa 1870 (Moore et al.1999). All old-growth (pre-
dating 1870 A.D.) trees were retained, as well as 3
younger trees of the same species within a 9–27-m
radius of all pre-settlement evidences (stumps,logs,
and snags). Tree thinning substantially reduced the
hazard of stand-replacing fire (Fulé et al. 2001), but
thinned stands were highly diverse in structure,
reflecting the historical variability across the land-
scape (Waltz et al.2003). Thinned slash was lopped
and broadcast-burned.
Of the total area of pon-
derosa pine forest in the area (approximately 6,900
ha Moore et al.2003),approximately 1,900 ha were
included in the restoration experiment, of which
untreated controls and areas with slopes steeper
than 40% comprised approximately 50%.
Slopes
steeper than 40% were not treated due to logistical
difficulties in moving equipment through these
areas and the potential for increased soil erosion.
As of the end of 2003,approximately 330 ha (5% of
the total available) had been fully treated with thin-
ning and burning.
Methods
Moeller et al.(1985) divided 4,700 ha of the pon-
derosa pine habitat on our study area into 27 com-
partments of varying size and searched each com-
partment for 1–2 days for turkey roosts during the
summer of 1985. They recorded the location of
each roost site on a topographic map and made a
number of measurements at each roost, including
basal area and number of scats and feathers below
roost trees.
We attempted to relocate the 120
roosts they found by calculating Universal
Transverse Mercator coordinates based on the orig-
inal topographic maps. When we located these
coordinates in the field, if a single stand of large
trees was within 50 m,we assumed this group to be
the historical roost site. If there was more than 1
group of large trees or no trees within 50 m, the
location was not used in our analysis regardless of
whether turkey sign was present under 1 of the
groups of trees.
This conservative approach
reduced the chance of misidentifying new roosts as
historical roosts.
Instead we classified these
ambiguous historical roost sites with turkey sign as
new roosts.
To compare the relative abundance of historical
roost sites in areas impacted by restoration treat-
ments, we designated roosts as either 1) treatment
roosts if they were located within restoration treat-
ed stands, 2) adjacent roosts if they were <800 m
from treated stands,or 3) distant roosts if they were
>800 m from a treated stand. The number of his-
torical roosts still in use in treatment, adjacent, and
2

untreated categories was then compared to the
number expected to be in use based on the relative
number of both used and unused historical roosts
in each treatment category using chi-square.
We also searched for new roosts while traveling
between historical roost locations by searching the
ground under all large ponderosa pine within 20 m
of our search path for turkey sign. Total time of
these searches for new roosts across both years was
11 hours in treated stands, 30 hours in adjacent
stands, and 6 hours in distant stands (relatively few
historical roosts were located in distant stands). To
test whether treatment,adjacent,and distant stands
differed in number of new roosts detected,we com-
pared the number of new roosts found in each area
to the number expected based on search effort
using chi square.
An index of the level of current turkey use of
roosts was determined by counting scat and feath-
ers under both historical and new roost trees.
Following Moeller et al. (1985), we considered 1–3
scats or feathers to indicate low use,4–10 moderate
use, and >10 high use. To determine whether rela-
tive roost use (as measured by scat and feathers)
differed in treated,adjacent,and distant stands com-
pared to relative use for these roosts in 1985, we
compared the number of roosts in use in either
2002 or 2003 in each use category in treated, adja-
cent, and distant stands and to the number expect-
ed based on the percentage originally recorded for
historical roosts (Moeller et al. 1985) using chi
square.
To determine whether historical roosts in the
interior of treated areas were more likely to be
abandoned, we compared the numbers of active
historical roosts that were either >500 m or <500 m
from a treatment edge to the expected number
based on the number of historical roosts originally
described in each area.
To determine whether treatment had altered
roost-site or roost-tree characteristics, we randomly
selected 28 of the historical and recent roost sites
in use during 2002–2003 in untreated areas (adja-
cent and distant) and compared them to 14 of the
historical and new roost sites in use in 2002–2003
in treated areas. At each of these sites,we recorded
tree basal area, number of stems, and canopy cover
within an 11.28-m fixed-radius plot at each relocat-
ed roost site. Canopy cover was estimated as the
mean percentage covered of 4 spherical densiome-
ter readings taken at the 4 cardinal directions from
the center of each plot. In addition, we measured
tree DBH, height, height of the lowest branch, and
tree age for 1 roost tree at each of these sites. To
determine tree age, we mounted and surfaced the
increment cores from each tree to view all the rings
clearly, then cross-dated the rings with a local tree-
ring chronology. Rings were counted for cores that
could not be cross-dated.
We compared DBH,
height, and height of the lowest branch of roost
trees in treated versus untreated roosts using two-
sample t-tests.
Results
In 2002 we relocated 91 of the 120 roost sites
described by Moeller et al. in 1985 (Figure 1).
Those not relocated were locations at which >1
group of large trees was present, making it impos-
sible to unambiguously assign 1 group as the his-
torical roost site or locations at which no obvious
roost stand was present and no evidence of stumps
could be found. Two historical roost sites had been
destroyed; a roost site consisting of a single roost
tree was broken at 5 m,apparently due to lightning
strike, and a roost site consisting of small-diameter
trees was destroyed due to thinning,but the stumps
remained.
Twenty-three of the unambiguously
determined historical roost sites were used by
turkeys in 2002 based on presence of scat and
feathers, and an additional 5 were used in 2003.
The number of historical roosts still in use in treat-
ed (7 out of 23), adjacent 16 out of 52), and distant
stands (5 out of 14) combined across both years did
not differ from that expected based on the relative
proportion of total historical roosts in each area (χ2
=0.08, P>0.75) (Figure 2).
We located 72 new roost sites in 2002, and an
additional 4 new roost sites in 2003, with similar
search effort expended in both years (Figure 1). Of
the 72 new sites located in 2002, 24 remained in
use in 2003. Of the 76 new roosts we located, 24
were in treatment stands, 46 were in adjacent
stands, and 6 were in stands >800m from a treated
area. When the number of new roosts found in
each treatment was compared to that expected
based on search effort expended in each stand
type, we found no significant difference among
stand types in the number of new roosts found (χ2
=3.72, P>0.10). The number of historical roosts
sites still in use in the interior of treated areas (1/6)
or near the edge (8/15) was not significantly differ-
ent (χ2=1.12, P>0.10), but test power was limited
by small sample size. The number of low-, moder-

ate-, and high-use roost sites (based on the feather
and scat index) in treated, adjacent, and distant
areas did not differ from that expected based on
the relative number of each type in the original
census in 1985 (Table 1). Older scats observed at
roost sites indicated roosts were used in the fall and
winter while more recent scats indicated roosts
were currently in use during the summer as well.
Turkeys on our study site apparently do not move
to separate wintering areas due to the limited area
of ponderosa pine available in this relatively isolat-
ed 6,800-ha “island” of habitat.
Based on the randomly selected subset of roost
sites in treated (n=14) and untreated (n=28) stands
at which we recorded site and tree characteristics,
roost sites in treated stands had lower basal area,
lower canopy cover, and fewer stems than roosts in
adjacent and distant stands (Table 2). Roost trees in
treated stands did not differ in DBH, tree height, or
distance to lowest limb from those in untreated
areas (Table 2). All roost trees (n=130) were mature
ponderosa pines, with mean age of 263 years, rang-
ing from 60 to at least 561 years of age.
Discussion
Several lines of evidence indicated that the
restoration treatments implemented on this study
site did not result in abandonment of roost sites by
turkeys in treated areas. First, the number of his-
torical roost sites still in use in treated,adjacent,and
distant locations did not differ from that expected
based on the relative abundance of historical sites
in each area. Second,the number of new roosts we
found in treated, adjacent, and distant stands did
not differ when these numbers were controlled for
search time in each stand type. Finally, the relative
number of high-,moderate-,and low-use sites found
in each stand type did not vary from that expected
based on historical roost sites. If treatment caused

turkeys to reduce use of roosts but not abandon
them entirely,we would have expected the number
of low-use roosts to have increased in treated areas
relative to that expected based on historical (pre-
treatment) use of roosts in these areas.
Roost trees in treated areas were as large in both
diameter and height as trees in untreated areas and
within the ranges reported in other studies of

turkey

selection
(Hoffman 1968, Boeker and Scott 1969, Mackey
1984, Mollohan et al. 1995, Wakeling and Rogers
1998). This was most likely due to the retention of
large- diameter trees as part of the treatment proto-
col. Likewise, although tree basal area, number of
stems and canopy cover were all significantly lower
on roost sites in treated areas, these parameters
remained at or above the minimums reported for
Merriam’s turkey roost sites in other areas
(Hoffman 1968, Boeker and Scott 1969, Mackey
1984,Wakeling and Rogers 1998) and were above
the 21 m2/ha often recommended for roosting site
management (Rumble 1992, Mollohan et al. 1995,
Wakeling and Rogers 1995).
Within both treated and untreated areas, turkey
roosts occurred in areas with higher basal area than
reported for other locations on our study site. The
mean basal area of our roost sites in treated areas
(26.4 m2/ha) was 40% higher than the mean of 18
m2/ha documented on 4 experimentally treated
blocks scattered across the study area in a separate
study (Waltz et al. 2003). Likewise, the basal area of
our roost sites in untreated areas was 46 m2/ha,25%
higher than the mean basal area of 32 m2/ha in ran-
domly selected untreated areas (Waltz et al. 2003).
Several unique aspects of this study caution
against generalizing too greatly from these results.
First, restoration efforts on our site created treated
stands within undisturbed matrix,and made up only
approximately 5% of the entire habitat available.
Thus, treatments potentially could have reduced
habitat quality in terms of nesting and brooding
cover, but if turkeys simply shifted use to untreated
areas while maintaining roost fidelity, we would not
have detected this important effect. Likewise, most
of the turkey roosts on our site were on ridges or
slopes,consistent with other studies of turkey roost-
site characteristics, while treatment areas were con-
fined to areas with slopes with less than 40% grade.
As a result, most of our roosts were located on the
edges of treated areas,increasing the opportunity for
turkeys to utilize nontreated habitat while maintain-
ing roost-site fidelity. Although most of the active
roosts on our sites were along the edges of treat-
ments, suggesting that turkeys may avoid the interi-
or of treated areas, the number of active roosts near
the edge of treatments did not differ significantly

from that expected based on the location of histori-
cal roosts relative to treatment boundaries.
However,given our small sample size of active roosts
within treated areas, this test was limited in power.
Finally,treatments on our site were implemented
over several years, potentially allowing turkeys to
shift areas of use from one area to another from
year to year. Further studies are needed to docu-
ment how restoration treatments affect other
parameters important to wild turkeys such as nest,
escape and brood-rearing cover, and food availabili-
ty and how restoration at larger spatial scales,under
different temporal patterns, may influence turkey
habitat use and productivity.
