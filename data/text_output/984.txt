Abstract
Removing submerchantable size trees and forest residues as well as sawlogs is preferred in fuel reduction thinning because
it improves treatment effectiveness and avoids slash burning. Fuel reduction thinning was investigated to describe integrated
harvesting machine processes and productivity and to characterize stump-to-truck costs for sawlogs and biomass for energy
production. This system was studied in mixed-conifer forest on land owned by the US Forest Service in northern California
and southern Oregon. Detailed time-study methods were paired with standard machine rate calculation methods to evaluate
productivity and costs for the system. Sensitivity analysis and a standardized comparison were performed to evaluate costs
and productivity under varying operation parameters. Treatment costs (stump-to-truck; without mobilization, overhead, or
profit) were US$0.42/ft3 for sawlogs and US$52.41 per bone dry ton (BDT) for biomass. Standardized unit production costs
for sawlog skidding varied little, but the smaller skidder was clearly preferable for biomass tree skidding when external
skidding distances exceeded 200 feet. The grinder had the highest hourly cost of any machine in the system and its unit
production cost (US$/BDT) was sensitive to changes in utilization rate. Evaluations on system balance showed that improved
utilization of the grinder could be accomplished as the grinder and loader often waited for a chip van. Integrated harvesting
was a cost-effective way of implementing fuel reduction thinning method because of the potential for sawlog revenues to
offset some of the biomass extraction cost.
Effective ﬁre suppression and high grading are among
factors that have led to dense, overstocked stands with an
increased chance of canopy ﬁre (Agee and Skinner 2005,
Metlen and Fiedler 2006). Abundant small trees and shrubs
function as ladder fuels, providing vertical continuity of
fuels and allowing surface ﬁres to climb into the canopy as
they consume the smaller trees (Van Wagner 1977).
Seasonally dry forests such as those in northern California
and southern Oregon have more small trees and fewer large
trees as well as more fuels than before European settlement
(Parsons and DeBenedetti 1979, Bonnicksen and Stone
1982, Parker 1984, Chang 1996, Stephens and Ruth 2005).
Resulting catastrophic canopy ﬁres cause great economic
damage and ecological disruption. Design and implementa-
tion of appropriate silvicultural and harvesting methods can
be effectively used to reduce wildland ﬁre hazard in these
ﬁre-prone ecosystems (Keyes and O’Hara 2002).
Timber harvesting systems have traditionally been
developed to produce wood crops but are now used as a
tool to accomplish varied stand management objectives. In
addition to wood production, these systems can be used to
prevent high-intensity ﬁres, restore late-seral characteristics,
and enhance wildlife habitat (Keyes and O’Hara 2002, Agee
and Skinner 2005, Adebayo et al. 2007). Harvesting systems
can be used as a tool to manage forest fuels because we have
limited control over other inﬂuences on ﬁre behavior, such
as topography and weather (Rothermel 1972).
Conventional sawlog harvesting methods are relatively
costly when used in fuel reduction thinning. Forest products
produced in fuel reduction operations are primarily from the
utilization of smaller trees (,9 in.), and much of this wood
is not used to produce dimensional lumber. Lower
production with small-wood handling increases the costs

of ﬁre hazard reduction operations (Han et al. 2004).
Additional costs may occur when residues left from sawlog
processing and whole trees not producing sawlogs (typically
,9 in. diameter at breast height [dbh] in northern
California) need to be removed with no burning option.
Products such as chips or hog fuel (ground submerchantable
trees and logging slash; hereafter ‘‘biomass’’) have
relatively low value, volatile markets, and a limited number
of markets (Hartsough et al. 2008).
When biomass has to be removed mechanically from the
site, the overall economics of fuel reduction thinning
becomes negative because of the low market value of
biomass and increased handling costs. Harvesting system
selection and methods, biomass moisture content, and truck
travel time substantially affect the cost of small-wood
harvesting, particularly when biomass is the primary forest
product (Gingras and Favreau 1996; Han et al. 2004, 2010).
The biomass harvesting cost is also sensitive to the
utilization rates of the machines, especially the grinder’s
cost and utilization rate, both of which are often heavily
inﬂuenced by availability of chip vans (Gingras and Favreau
1996, Spinelli and Visser 2008).
Integrated harvesting is a harvesting operation in which a
combustible energy product (biomass) is produced in
conjunction with sawlogs (Hudson et al. 1990). Integrated
harvesting systems are often used in fuel reduction thinning
treatments to utilize both sawlog-sized trees and submer-
chantable trees, removing them from the stand and reducing
ﬁre hazard. Integrated harvesting can be a more cost-
effective way of treating hazardous fuel conditions than
conventional sawlog harvesting because it eliminates the
cost of pile-burning slash and risk of ﬁre escape (Pan et al.
2008). Integrated harvesting costs are allocated to either
sawlog or biomass functions depending on the machine’s
activities handling one or both of these products. Machines
that handle both sawlogs and biomass have their costs
apportioned based on the production amount of each of the
products, referred to as the joint product cost estimation
approach (Puttock 1995). The cost of machines that handle
only one product are charged solely to the production of that
product. Stump-to-truck costs for integrated harvesting
operations have been reported to range from US$0.59 to
US$0.82 per ft3 for sawlogs and US$30.00 to US$38.51 per
bone dry ton (BDT) for biomass (Hartsough et al. 1997, Han
et al. 2004, Largo and Han 2004, Harrill and Han 2010).
These costs are higher than those found in sawlog-only
harvests due to high costs associated with biomass handling
activities (Stuart et al. 1981, Adebayo et al. 2007).
Integrated harvesting is an effective way to supply
biomass for energy production and leaves stands clear of
residues and submerchantable trees. The application of an
integrated harvesting approach in fuel reduction thinning
treatment effectively reduces the fuel in the stand and
eliminates smoke production and the risk of ﬁre escape
associated with prescribed burning (Hakkila 1989, Hudson
et al. 1990, Nelson and Dutch 1991, Hudson 1995, Han et al.
2004). Drawbacks to integrated harvesting mainly involve
increases in overall treatment costs compared with removal
of sawlogs only (Hudson et al. 1990, Nicholls et al. 2008).
There is limited information on removing biomass and
sawlogs with one entry, especially in mixed-conifer stands,
which are present throughout the US West.
The aim of this study was to develop an understanding of
factors affecting the function of each individual component
of an integrated harvesting system and evaluate how the
components work together, leading to appropriate machine
selection and aiding future cost estimation. The speciﬁc
objectives of this study were to (1) describe the process and
productivity of machines used in an integrated fuel
reduction thinning and (2) characterize stump-to-truck costs
for integrated harvesting. These results may be used by
researchers and land managers to estimate the cost of
reducing hazardous fuel conditions given consistency of
parameters such as mixed-conifer forest type, similar
silvicultural prescription, and similar integrated harvesting
system machines.
Methods
Study site and harvesting system
This study took place on the Klamath National Forest as a
part of the Mt. Ashland Stewardship Contract (T41S, R1W,
Sec. 12, Willamette Meridian). The focus of this vegetation
management contract was to restore and create stand
structure characteristic of late successional stands, reduce
ﬁre hazard, and improve wildlife habitat. Much of the Mt.
Ashland area is currently composed of mixed-conifer forests
including white ﬁr (Abies concolor), Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudot-
suga menziesii), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), incense-
cedar (Calocedrus decurrens), and sugar pine (Pinus
lambertiana). The harvest unit represented differing
amounts of heterogeneity as the majority of the area (.45
ac) was residual white ﬁr, Douglas-ﬁr, and sugar pine
displaying late-seral characteristics. Another small (,10-ac)
area was plantation ponderosa pine that had been planted in
1963. Variable density thinning was implemented to restore
late-successional stand structure as well as create defensible
fuel proﬁle zones by thinning.
The study of this ground-based, whole-tree, mechanized
harvesting system was conducted on a large (55-ac) thinning
unit with gentle slopes (0% to 32%). The initial thinning
operation involved several machines working in a decoupled
fashion to complete the work over 10 12-hour working days.
The feller-bunchers operated a few days ahead of the
extraction machines in order to maintain a buffered wood
supply between harvesting functions to maximize produc-
tivity as well as address skidder operator safety concerns.
The stages of this operation collectively constituted an
integrated harvesting system for fuel reduction thinning
because of the extraction of both large trees (9 in. dbh)
containing sawlogs and small-diameter (3- to 9-in.-dbh)
trees for production of combustible wood products (bio-
mass).
The ﬁrst machines to enter the stand were three zero tail-
swing tracked, ‘‘hot saw’’ feller-bunchers (Timbco/Valmet
445EXL). The feller-bunchers began the thinning process
by cutting the marked (.9-in.-dbh) trees and unmarked
biomass-sized (3- to 9-in.-dbh) trees and laying them in
bunches (either sawlog or biomass) along the predesignated
skid trails. All trees less than 3 inches dbh were left uncut
according to the silvicultural prescription. The skid trails
were located by the contractor and approved by the Forest
Service timber sale administrator, with a preference for
using existing skid trails when available if their slopes were
less than 35 percent. The feller-bunchers started cutting at
the landing and followed the skid trails as they radiated out
toward the unit boundaries. Upon reaching a boundary they
turned around and began cutting a large swath of trees on

either side of the skid trail and worked their way along the
skid trails back to the landing. This process was repeated on
all skid trails until the silvicultural prescription was
accomplished.
Upon completion of the timber-falling, a Cat 527
hightrack swingboom grapple skidder, along with John
Deere 648E and 748GIII rubber-tired dual-stage grapple
skidders, were used to complete the task of skidding larger
trees, which would become sawlogs, to the landing. Three
skidders were used for sawlog extraction to supply the
processor with sufﬁcient wood for minimal idle time.
Skidders utilized the predesignated main skid trails for the
majority of the turns and used random skids to collect wood
to build turns. Skidding distances ranged between 30 and
850 feet and averaged 374 feet. The tracked skidder was
used more often than the wheeled skidders on the steeper
slopes (between 25% and 35%) due to its superior traction
and stability.
Machines on the central landing worked in concert with
skidders to make room for the subsequent turns of sawlogs.
Logs were manufactured using a Waratah dangle-head
processor attached to a John Deere 2554 log loader base
machine. The limbs and tops were processed into a slash
pile, but the roundwood of the tops were kept separate and
decked in a large pile for subsequent utilization as biomass
or ﬁrewood. Production of commercial ﬁrewood was
proposed but was not realized in the thinning study unit
during the period of allowable operations.
The deck of processed sawlogs was then separated into
seven different sorts by a John Deere 2054 log loader. Logs
were sorted by species and by lengths to facilitate rapid
loading of log trucks. Logs from this thinning unit were
taken to their respective markets based on species and were
hauled either to a sawmill in White City, Oregon (51.5 mi
one-way distance) or a sawmill in Yreka, California (48.6
mi one-way distance).
The subsequent biomass operation began after sawlog
extraction had been completed. Two rubber-tired skidders
(John Deere 648E and 848H) were used to extract biomass
tree bunches left along skid trails by the felling operation.
There was an average of 13.9 trees per bunch as they were
small (3- to 9-in.-dbh) trees. The skidders often built turns
that averaged 1.9 bunches (averaged 26.4 trees per turn).
The observed skidding distances ranged from 50 to 650 feet
and were limited to slopes less than 35 percent. These
skidders used the existing skid trail pattern to bring the
biomass to the landing where a John Deere 2054 log loader
was feeding the grinder (Morbark 4600 XL tracked, 1,050
horse power grinder).
The grinding of biomass was maximized by using both
‘‘hot loading’’ directly into chip vans as well as creation of a
large pile of ground material at the landing. When chip vans
were present, the grinder loaded the comminuted material
into the van directly via a conveyor belt to minimize
material handling cost. If the landing was large enough, and
in the absence of chip vans, the ground material would be
deposited into a large pile until there was no room left on
the landing.
Data collection and analysis
Stand inventory was conducted prior to and immediately
following thinning to quantify stand conditions and evaluate
differences in volume (cubic feet per acre), basal area
(square feet per acre), density (trees per acre) and species
composition. The inventory included all trees down to 3-
inch dbh since any trees below this size were retained as
advanced regeneration and for wildlife value as cover for
terrestrial fauna. A systematic sampling design made up of
0.10-acre ﬁxed-area circular plots (n ¼ 12) was established
with spacing between plots being 330 by 330 feet. Plot
centers were ﬂagged to locate the plots after the thinning
had been completed.
Pre- and postharvest stand volumes were estimated to
evaluate the impact of the fuel hazard reduction thinning
treatment. Multiple-entry form factor equations developed
by MacLean and Berger (1976) were used to determine tree
volumes in cubic feet (to a 4-in. top). Equations were listed
by MacLean and Berger (1976) for all of the species present
in the treatment unit (ponderosa pine, Douglas-ﬁr, incense-
cedar, white ﬁr, and sugar pine). Form factors were
calculated for each individual tree in the cruise data set as
a function of tree total height and diameter at breast height.
These were limited for certain species to ensure reasonable
extrapolation beyond the limits of the data used to develop
the equations.
Time and motion study methods using a stopwatch (Olsen
and Kellogg 1983) were conducted on each of the machines
in the harvesting operation. The resulting data allowed
characterization and understanding of the relative frequen-
cies of machine activities (i.e., cycle components) for each
phase of the thinning operation as well as recording delays.
Additionally, delays were captured and delay-free machine
cycle times were calculated along with stand and operations
variables. Operational delays were deﬁned as any time a
machine was detracting from its own productivity but not
detracting from the productivity of the system (e.g., waiting
for skid trail to clear or waiting for wood to process).
Mechanical delays included fueling, maintenance, cooling
down, and repairing machines. Personal delay included
lunch time, personal time, and breaks.
Predictive equations were developed for machine cycle
times to understand machine production rates (cubic feet per
productive machine hour [PMH]) as well as understand
what factors affected machine operation. The feller-buncher
cycle began as the machine traveled away from the bunch
and toward the standing tree, cut the trees, and then ended
with traveling back to the bunch and laying the trees down
in the bunch. The skidder cycle began as the skidder left the
decking area of the landing, traveled to the next turn, built
the turn, grappled the turn, and then returned to the landing.
The processor cycle began when the processor grappled a
tree, processed the tree into logs, piled the tops, and then
returned for another tree. Log loader cycle began with
swinging empty grapples to the deck, grappling, swinging
logs toward the truck, log branding, and bunking the logs.
Independent variables, such as skidding distance and the
number of trees per turn that affected machine productivity
were recorded and related to each machine activity.
Predictive models were developed using analyses of
covariance (ANCOVA) using ordinary least squares with
Minitab 16 statistical analysis software (Minitab Inc. 2010).
ANCOVA predictive models were trained using 70 percent
of the data; 30 percent were randomly selected to be set
aside for model validation (Adebayo et al. 2007). Equation
coefﬁcients were then calculated using the entire data set in
the validated model. Data were transformed and standard-
ized residual plots were reviewed using visual inspection of
residuals to minimize heteroscedasticity (Ramsey and
666
VITORELO ET AL.

Schafer 2002). In order to evaluate and reduce multi-
collinearity of the covariates, matrix plots, variance inﬂation
factors, and Pearson correlation values were generated.
Moderate correlation values among covariates led to the use
of stepwise regression methods to minimize Mallows’ Cp
values, thus maximizing adjusted r2 values. Mallows’ Cp
value is a criterion that focuses on the trade-off between bias
due to excluding explanatory variables and extra variance
caused by multicollinearity (Mallows 1973).
Once the best model was identiﬁed by stepwise
regression, ANCOVA analyses were run by including both
the categorical variable as well as the best model of the
covariates. Categorical variable coefﬁcients were given with
exception of the ﬁnal factor in each category which were
aliased (omitted because it can be calculated from the
coefﬁcients of the other factors in the category; Minitab Inc.
2010). The ﬁnal predictive equations developed were then
validated by generating predicted delay-free cycle times for
the machines using predictor variable values. These were
then tested against the observed delay-free cycle times using
a paired t test (a ¼ 0.05; Adebayo et al. 2007, Spinelli and
Visser 2008).
Hourly cost ﬁgures (US dollars per scheduled machine
hour (SMH) and per PMH) were calculated using standard
machine rate methods (Miyata 1980, Brinker et al. 2002).
Initial purchase price information and interest rates were
obtained from local equipment dealers and lenders,
respectively, to reﬂect general machine process for broader
application of the results. Salvage values, utilization rates,
tax information, lubrication costs, repair and maintenance
costs, and economic lives were obtained from Brinker et al.
(2002). Fuel consumption rates (gallons per hour) were
calculated as a function of machine horsepower and
transmission type and were checked for accuracy with
contractor estimates (Brinker et al. 2002). Overhead,
mobilization, support vehicles, and proﬁt allowance were
not included in hourly machine cost estimates.
Production rates for sawlog and biomass operations were
derived by using ﬁeld data collected from this study
combined with biomass (weight of trees) prediction
equations (Jenkins et al. 2003). Production rates for the
sawlog operation were calculated using log scaling data
derived from log deck sampling at the end of each day. Log
sampling was stratiﬁed by species and then again by log
length. Volume per log (cubic feet) was calculated using
Smalian’s cubic volume formula (Dilworth 1954). The
number of trees or number of logs per cycle were recorded
and used to determine volume per cycle for each machine. A
combination of observed cycle time, utilization, and volume
per cycle data resulted in machine production estimates,
expressed as cubic feet per PMH.
Biomass production rates were obtained different ways
based on the machine in question. Using species-speciﬁc tree
mass equations (Jenkins et al. 2003), moisture content, and
inventory data for trees thinned from the stand, we estimated
the dry weight for each small (3- to 9-in.-dbh) tree removed.
Feller-buncher productivity was calculated using the average
dry weight per tree and the number of trees cut per cycle. The
average dry weight per tree, the number of trees per bundle,
and the number of bundles per turn were used to calculate
skidder productivity. An average of the chip van weights was
used for calculation of the productivity for the other machines
used for biomass production. The chip van weights were
obtained from the scaling information catalogued by the
Klamath National Forest.
Operator skill inﬂuences the cost and productivity of
forest operations and should be considered when estimating
treatment costs. An experienced crew can have a direct
effect on planning and layout time and cost as well as
lowering unit production cost by increasing the level of
productivity (Murphy et al. 2003). Bolding (2002) deter-
mined that operator skill was most important in loading and
unloading as well as machine maneuverability in the study
of a forest fuel reduction resulting in energy wood
production. The work experience of the operator for each
machine in this study is presented in Table 1.
Moisture content measurements of the ground material
were used to convert the cost of the operation from green
tons to BDT and were obtained by sampling. Six samples
were taken during the grinding operation by placing hog
fuel into sealed plastic bags to prevent evaporative loss of
moisture. Sampling times were stratiﬁed throughout the day
(morning, midday, and afternoon) to ensure accurate
representation of the entire operation. Dry weights were
obtained by oven drying samples at 608C and weighing
periodically until no additional mass was lost.
Standardized skidding comparison evaluated each of the
skidders using the productivity equations developed for the
three sawlog and two biomass skidders with standardized
predictor variables for each of the machines. Values of the
variables used for the standardized comparison for sawlog
skidding were 61.67 percent utilization rate, 5.5 trees per
cycle, and external skidding distance ranging from 100 to
600 feet; the variables for biomass skidder comparison were
60 percent utilization rate and the skidding distances
previously mentioned.
Results and Discussion

mechanical fuel reduction thinning
Stand conditions and thinning operations.—The initial
stand condition showed both horizontally and vertically
continuous fuels, with abundant ladder fuels as illustrated by
the numerous small-diameter trees shown in the reverse-J
diameter distribution (Fig. 1). The silvicultural prescription
truncated the distribution, raising the canopy base height
and lowering the canopy bulk density by introducing large

gaps, resulting in an aggregated or patchy stand structure
(Table 2). The thinning resulted in a 33.3 percent basal area
reduction from 272.0 to 181.4 ft2/ac, after removal of
2,442.0 ft3/ac of stemwood volume (Table 3).
The sawlog extraction phase operated in a decoupled
fashion with the feller-bunchers ahead of sawlog extraction
machines by 3 days. This decoupling ensured a sufﬁcient
supply of wood to allow skidding to proceed at maximum
productivity. The felling of trees is also dangerous when
many pieces of equipment are present, and this decoupling
served also to enhance skidder operator safety. Processing
of trees into logs and loading of logs onto trucks was
simultaneous with skidding. The biomass extraction phase
was also decoupled in that it began after the sawlog
extraction machines had left the unit. The biomass
extraction machines were not decoupled from one another;
they worked together to skid, process, and load biomass.
Comparisons of machine operation activities were not
included because they would not be valid comparisons;
operations such as this have not been captured in previous
studies.
Felling.—The three feller-bunchers concurrently per-
formed the felling and handling of sawlogs and biomass
trees so that only a single machine pass was necessary in
any given area. The sawlog-sized trees and biomass-sized
trees were cut in alternating cycles and laid in separate
bunches. Bunches were placed at a 458 angle to the skid trail
to facilitate the skidding of bunches while keeping them out
of the road. The amount of time spent performing each of
the several activities shows relatively little time spent
handling sawlogs as compared with biomass (Fig. 2). The
average delay-free cycle times for sawlog and biomass
cutting cycles were 0.51 and 0.82 minutes, respectively.
Within the categories of sawlog and biomass handling,
felling activity was further divided into the components of
the harvesting process. The machine processes for sawlog
and biomass handling were similar except for the difference
in cutting time (Fig. 3). Much more time was spent cutting
biomass material because more stems were cut during a
biomass machine cycle. The average number (6standard
deviation) of stems cut per cycle for the sawlog cycle was
1.2 6 0.09 stems and for the biomass cycle was 4.6 6 0.20
stems.
Skidding.—Skidding for sawlog production was done in
concert with the processor and loader to extract large trees
(.9 in. dbh). Three skidders were used by the contractor in
an effort to balance the production of the different
harvesting functions because too few skidders would leave
the processor waiting for wood and underutilized. The
machine-speciﬁc activity allocations reveal that traveling
loaded and operational delays were common activities for
skidders (Table 4). Skidder delays were primarily a result of
waiting on the processor to clear the landing area, waiting
for another skidder to clear the trail, or handling slash
(64.21%, 3.32%, and 19.42%, respectively; percentage of
total delay time). In consideration of the subsequent biomass

operation, skidders handled slash by piling with their
grapples instead of pushing slash with their blades to
minimize incorporation of soil and thus maximize biomass
feedstock quality.
Extraction of the biomass-sized tree bunches (3 to 9 in.
dbh) from the thinning was concurrent with production of
woody biomass for energy production. The two skidders
used for primary transport (stump to landing) of the biomass
differed substantially in size, yet their machine-speciﬁc
activity allocations showed strong similarities (Fig. 4).
Average skidding turn times for large and small skidders
were 5.75 and 5.35 minutes, respectively. This similarity in
skidding times was likely due to highly comparable turn
volumes. Because of the low density of the biomass bundles,
the smaller skidder was not limited by turn weight and
forced to skid less volume than the large skidder (turn
weights for large and small skidders were, respectively, 1.41
and 1.37 BDT).
Processing.—The processor manufactured logs of differ-
ent lengths (35, 26, and 17 ft) down to a small-end diameter
of 6 inches outside bark. The logs were then decked between
the processor and loader for the loader to sort and load. The
processor was supplied with whole trees continuously by the
skidders with few instances (7.9% of total time observed) of
the processor having to wait for trees. The processor spent
additional time piling biomass, primarily tops, to streamline
subsequent utilization (Fig. 5).
The processing of residual biomass (i.e., slash) from
sawlog manufacturing and smaller trees (3 to 9 in. dbh) into
a marketable forest product was accomplished using a
grinder. A Morbark 4600XL hammer grinder (1,050 hp)
produced woody biomass for energy production. Quality
control of biomass feedstock size was accomplished using a
screen in which two-thirds was perforated with 4-inch
apertures and one-third had 6-inch apertures.
Screen size affected production rate because larger screen
sizes allowed passage of larger particles, thus increasing
production. The grinder took, on average, 24.35 minutes to
hot load 23.1 green tons or 16.0 BDT (30.8% moisture
content conversion factor used) into chip vans. Harrill and
Han (2010) found similar chip van loading times for a
comparable grinder in a forest residue recovery operation.
They reported 21 minutes for the grinder to load 14.1 BDT
into a chip van. Pan et al. (2008) provided a predictive

equation where the green weight (pounds) of hog fuel was a
signiﬁcant (P , 0.05) predictor of the time the grinder
required to load a chip van. The van weights in this study
were within the range of the model training data Pan et al.
(2008) used to develop this equation, but we found no
signiﬁcant relationship between chip van weight and loading
time (n ¼ 7).
The operator’s strategic utilization of the landing area
aided in increasing the grinder’s production rate. Hot
loading of chip vans was preferred because it required less
material handling, but in the absence of chip vans the
biomass was blown into a large pile to avoid idle time for
the grinder. This pile began at the corner of the landing
farthest away from the skidders’ decking area and
progressed toward the skidders, ﬁlling the landing, with
the exception of a lane just wide enough for chip van access.
Having a grinder that was self-mobile (on tracks) was
important in grinder positioning for efﬁcient use of the
landing area.
To comminute the roundwood of the tops of sawlog trees
and whole biomass trees, a chipper might have been more
favorable; however, a chipper would have been less
effective at converting slash into a biomass. Hammer
grinders often have higher energy requirements than
chippers but have greater ﬂexibility in the material they
can accept and have lower maintenance due to rugged
design (Pottie and Guimier 1985).
Loading.—Sawlogs were loaded onto stinger-steered
double-bunk log trucks and occasional short-log trucks.
The loading process was slowed by the need to brand logs
(8.53% of the loader’s time was spent branding), which was
required for the timber sale in the National Forest. Log
trucks were loaded until the onboard scales read a load
weight of approximately 25 tons (or 35 tons if the truck was
specially equipped and traveled to the Oregon sawmill).
The machine activities captured for the loader during the
biomass operation were during hot loading of chip vans.
Interestingly, swinging the empty grapples toward the wood
took more time than swinging the loaded grapples (10.95%
as opposed to 7.97%, respectively) toward the infeed table
of the grinder. This phenomenon was due to the operator
swinging the empty loader slowly to evaluate which pieces
would maximize the grinder’s productivity without over-
loading the grinder and slowing it down.
Predictive equations for harvesting productivity.—Pre-
dictive models for the machines estimate delay-free cycle
time for a machine, using the corresponding independent
variables for each cycle element (Table 5). Assumptions
used for the data analysis were met because data were
independent, heteroscedasticity was minimal, and models’
multicollinearity was mild or moderate. These models were
all validated using a paired t test (a ¼ 0.05) comparing
observed with predicted delay-free cycle time for the
reserved data (30% of observed data). Following validation,
equation coefﬁcients and P values were calculated using the
entire data set in the validated models (Table 5).
Production costs for sawlogs and biomass
Sawlogs.—The overall unit production cost for sawlog
production was US$0.42/ft3 (Table 6). Skidding had the
highest harvesting function cost at US$0.17/ft3. This
represents 40 percent of the total sawlog system production
cost. Production rates for all of the machines in the sawlog
harvesting operation ranged from a maximum of 1,456.45
ft3/SMH to a minimum of 366.20 ft3/SMH at 60 to 65
percent machine utilization rates.
The sawlog harvesting unit production cost developed
here was lower than those found in past studies (Hartsough
et al. 1997, Han et al. 2004, Largo and Han 2004). The
decoupled nature of this integrated harvesting system that
resulted in high production rates lowered the cost observed
in this study. As found in other studies (e.g., Han et al.
2004), skidding was more costly than any other sawlog
harvesting function such as felling and processing.
The system balance of the sawlog harvesting system was
particularly interesting and telling of the efﬁciency of the
system (Table 6). Production rate totals for harvesting
system functions (i.e., skidding, felling, etc.) illustrate
system balance more clearly than individual machine
production rates (i.e., large-wheeled skidder, tracked
skidder, small-wheeled skidder, etc.). The total felling
production was the highest of all the harvesting functions,
but it did not affect productivity of the follow-up harvesting
because it was decoupled from the remaining extraction
functions. Skidding had the second highest production rate,
illustrating a slight system imbalance. Processing had the
lowest production rate of all the harvesting functions,
indicating the bottleneck (lowest production rate) in the
system. Despite the bottleneck, the system seemed relatively
well balanced, and the addition of another processor would
have resulted in excessive production and led to lower
utilization due to idle time waiting for skidders to deliver
trees. Additionally, excessive production of two processors
would have overwhelmed the log loader because its
production capability was lower than the capability of two
processors.
Utilization rates used in the cost calculations are standard
rates described by Brinker et al. (2002) to represent typical
operations. These cost ﬁgures should result in greater
applicability for future cost estimation. Observed utilization
rates were not used in cost calculations to minimize
potential bias resulting from a short observation window
(10 days) because the delays recorded may not be
representative of the operation as a whole (Table 7). Felling

production used was an average of the production of the rate
across the three machines.
Biomass harvesting.—The biomass harvesting cost esti-
mate (US$52.41/BDT stump to truck) in this study was
higher than those found in literature (Hartsough et al. 1997,
Rummer et al. 2003, Han et al. 2004, Largo and Han 2004,
Pan et al. 2008, Harrill and Han 2010). A low utilization rate
of the grinder may cause increased unit production cost;
Spinelli and Magagnotti’s (2010) ﬁgure of 75 percent
utilization (based on 63 chipping and grinding operations)
was used to broaden the applicability of our cost ﬁgures for
future cost estimation. It is important note that the use of a

team consisting of a grinder and a loader has a direct impact
on grinding costs, as illustrated in Figure 6. The delivered
softwood biomass/hogfuel prices for the Paciﬁc Northwest
ranged from US$34 to US$51 per BDT during the period of
operation (Glass 2010), meaning that the revenues from the
removal of biomass from the stand would be less than the
total cost of biomass harvesting and transportation.
The biomass phase of this integrated harvesting system
for fuel hazard reduction had unique attributes to its
production analysis. The feller-bunchers, loading, and
grinding functions were well matched in terms of bone
dry ton per scheduled machine hour, with the skidding being
less productive. The skidding appeared to be the bottleneck
(lowest productivity) in this system, but it was mainly due to
the skidders’ lower utilization rate because their production
capability was much higher at 27.41 BDT/PMH (Table 8).
Based on ﬁeld observations, the main system inefﬁciency
was caused by the lack of chip vans available for hot loading
(an average of 3.35 h of chip van availability in a 12-h
workday). The deﬁciency of landing area to accommodate
biomass piling on the ground in absence of a chip van also
contributed to its inefﬁciency. This unit was one of many in
the area. Thus, the grinding phase crew had to travel from
landing to landing in search of free space to operate. The
average landing size in the area was 0.43 acre and the
average distance that the machines (two skidders, loader,
and grinder) had to travel between these landings was 0.26
mile. With additional chip vans or larger landings, the unit
production cost of the grinder would have been lower, and
thus the stump-to-truck cost of the operation would have
been lower than US$52.41/BDT (Fig. 6).
Standardized comparison for skidding
Standardized sawlog skidding costs were the same or
similar to each other for different sizes and types of skidders
in this standardized comparison (Table 9). The small-
wheeled skidder (John Deere 648E) was consistently
slightly more costly than the other two throughout all of
the skidding distances. The two larger skidders (John Deere
748GIII and Cat 527) had the same or similar unit
production cost throughout all skidding distances. The
similarity in unit production costs among these skidders was
a function of size (horsepower and physical size/mass). The
smaller skidder (648E) had a lower hourly cost (US$77.19/
SMH), but it had lower turn volume (147.09 ft3 per turn)
because of horsepower restriction, whereas the 527 had
higher hourly cost (US$110.36/SMH) and larger turn
volume (161.49 ft3 per turn). The large-wheeled skidder
(748GIII) was more cost effective not because of larger turn
volume (hourly cost and turn volumes of US$83.35/SMH
and 138.41 ft3 per turn, respectively), but because it was
able to travel faster due to its higher horsepower. Based on
these results, any of these machines appeared to be a good
choice for this harvesting operation.
Biomass skidding unit production costs revealed an
intuitive preference for the smaller skidder. The larger
skidder was more costly across all external skidding
distances. The difference in turn volumes between large
and small skidders was less noticeable than with sawlog
skidding because the material was much less dense. Field
observation showed that turn volume for the biomass
skidders was primarily dictated by grapple size and the
grapple sizes of these machines were similar. Based on these
results, the smaller skidder (John Deere 648E) is far more
economical to use for biomass skidding than the large
skidder (John Deere 848H).

Conclusions
The integrated harvesting system accomplished the
silvicultural prescription for this stand and the management
objectives. This treatment minimized the vertical continuity
of fuels by removing the majority of ladder fuels as well as
lowering the canopy bulk density by thinning and
introducing gaps in the canopy to reduce the horizontal
continuity of canopy fuels. The variable density thinning
prescription for this stand retained several cohorts of trees
while opening gaps for advance regeneration to establish yet
another cohort of trees. Additional cohorts enhance the
structural heterogeneity and habitat value of the stand. As a
result, the mean diameter of the stand increased to function
also as restoration to a more ﬁre-resilient stand structure.
The harvesting costs developed here represent a unique
pairing of sawlog and biomass product extraction in an
integrated harvesting system. The sawlog extraction phase
had a stump-to-truck cost of US$0.42/ft3, which was lower
than the unit production costs reported by similar studies.
Biomass production costs (stump to truck) were higher than
reported in previous studies at US$52.41/BDT. Integrated
harvesting operations may become more common as they
represent a way to remove small-diameter fuels from the
forest without the smoke and risk of ﬁre escape associated
with prescribed burning, while having the potential to
produce energy from a renewable source.
System balance can affect productivity, a major inﬂuence
of unit production cost. The sawlog extraction phase of this
integrated harvesting operation showed only slight system
imbalance where the processor had a slightly lower
production rate than the other harvesting functions. The
biomass utilization phase had a substantial system imbal-
ance that affected the unit production cost of the whole
system. Lack of chip vans and (or) lack of landing space
caused a severe bottleneck in the system that led to low
observed grinder utilization. Grinding unit production cost
was sensitive to machine utilization; given the high hourly
cost of this machine it is important to minimize its delay
time.
Results of this study will help inform researchers and land
managers of the cost of fuel reduction thinning for future
treatment cost estimation. With increased accuracy in cost
estimation, the funding may be used to treat more of the
high-risk areas across the forests of the western United
States.
