ABSTRACT
Arizona ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests have undergone dramatic changes since the late nineteenth
century. Management practices such as fire exclusion have resulted in increased surface and tree crown fuel loads.
Consequently, large and severe wildfires have been occurring more frequently in the ponderosa pine forests of Arizona.
Furthermore, prescribed fire, both with and without tree thinning, is being applied to ponderosa pine forests to mitigate
the risk of wildfire. Increasingly, nonnative plant species are spreading into burned forests regardless of fire type. In this
article, we review recent literature on nonnative establishment in the post-fire plant community. Current research
suggests an increasing risk of nonnative establishment is associated with increasing fire severity. Furthermore, wildfires
seem more likely to promote nonnative species establishment than prescribed fires. The results are inconsistent, however,
with some high-severity fires having few nonnatives and some prescribed fires strongly promoting invasion. Further
research is needed to understand the mechanisms of invasion. In the 23 studies we examined, a total of 43 nonnative
plant species were reported in post-fire communities. Of these, only three species were listed as noxious in Arizona: field
bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis), Dalmatian toadflax (Linaria dalmatica), and Scotch cottonthistle (Onopordum
acantium). Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis), and common mullein (Verbascum
thapsus) were the most commonly observed species in burned areas, regardless of natural or anthropogenic ignition.
Generally, nonnative presence increased after fire, but abundance of these species remained low (< 10% cover). Changes
in nonnative populations reported in Arizona are consistent with those seen in ponderosa pine forests of other regions,
with nonnatives tending to increase with increasing fire severity.
INTRODUCTION
Fire plays an integral role in Arizona ponderosa
pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests by regulating and
maintaining tree density, understory species abun-
dance and composition, litter accumulation, and
many ecosystem processes (Weaver 1951, Cooper
1960, Hart et al. 2005, Laughlin and Fulé 2008).
Starting in the late 1800s, ponderosa pine forests in
Arizona were heavily grazed by livestock, reducing
the fuels that carried surface fires through the sys-
tem. In the early twentieth century, active fire sup-
pression further reduced the acreage burned each
year (Cooper 1960, Covington and Moore 1994). As
a result, the forests have become densely stocked
with ponderosa pines and depauperate of understory
species. As in many western states, the increased
density of trees, coupled with changes in climate,
has led to a commensurate increase in the number of
hectares annually burned by wildfire (Swetnam
1990, Covington et al. 1997, Westerling et al.
2006). In addition, more land is treated each year
for fuels management and ecological restoration
with prescribed fire (Interagency Fire Center;
www.NIFC.gov), often in combination with mech-
anical tree thinning prior to burning. Wildland fire
use (allowing naturally caused fire to burn for
resource benefit) is also becoming a more wide-
spread management practice. Disturbances created
by these fires may facilitate the spread of undesir-
able nonnative plant species (hereafter nonnatives)
into the burned landscapes (D'Antonio and Vitousek
1992, Keeley 2006). Regardless of whether the fire
is prescribed or wild, nonnatives are frequently doc-
umented in the post-fire understory community of
these forests.
Many nonnatives are well adapted to fire
(D'Antonio and Vitousek 1992, Brooks et al. 2004).
They are generally early successional species that
can capitalize on open niches created by fire faster
then their native counterparts (Rejmanek 1995). The
impact of nonnatives in the post-fire community is
highly variable. Some species, such as prickly
lettuce (Lactuca serriola) and common dandelion
(Taraxacum officinale), tend to have a subordinate
role in the disturbed ecosystem. Conversely, other,
more aggressive invaders, such as cheatgrass
(Bromus tectorum), can dominate an ecosystem,
altering fire cycles and belowground processes, and
reducing herbaceous diversity (Whisenant 1990,
Knapp 1996, Evans et al. 2001, Belnap et al. 2005).
Nonnatives are generally considered an undesir-
able component of the post-fire plant community
(Allen et al. 2002, D'Antonio and Meyerson 2002).
Understanding how nonnatives respond to pre-
scribed burning and wildfire provides insight into
the range of potential plant communities that may
establish after fire. In this paper we will review the
recent literature on nonnative response to fire in
Arizona ponderosa pine forests. We will discuss the

influence of wildfire on the spread of nonnative
species, the role of post-fire seeding, and provide a
long-term perspective on post-wildfire, nonnative
communities. We will also examine areas burned by
prescribed fire, both with and without mechanical
tree removal, to assess nonnative spread. Addition-
ally, we will discuss the most common nonnative
species reported in burned forests. Lastly, we will
discuss topics in need of further research.
Since Arizona ponderosa pine forests have
experienced a dramatic increase in fire activity in
recent times, we have elected to include only
research results reported in journal articles, theses,
dissertations, or other research outlets since 2000.
Our review is restricted to those studies that
occurred in burned ponderosa pine forests of
Arizona and that report, either quantitatively or
qualitatively, the status of the nonnative plant com-
munity in relationship to fire. In total, we review the
results of 23 studies in this article. We have elected
to retain the Latin nomenclature used in the articles
we have reviewed. Nativity of the various species is
based on the USDA, NRCS PLANTS Database
(USDA, NRCS 2009).
WILDFIRE AND NONNATIVES
Wildfires are often associated with increases in
nonnative plant species (the statistics associated
with the following studies are reported in Table 1).
Crawford et al. (2001) reported more than 100%
cumulative cover (i.e., the sum of individual species
cover instead of a total cover measurement) for
nonnatives in high-severity areas of three wildfires
in northern Arizona. Several studies of wildfire
areas on the North Rim of Grand Canyon National
Park show higher amounts of nonnatives than in
similar unburned areas (Laughlin et al. 2004,
Laughlin and Fulé 2008). Furthermore, when com-
pared with prescribed fires, with or without tree
removal, areas burned in wildfires often contain
substantially more nonnatives (Griffis et al. 2001,
Bataineh et al. 2006).
Wildfire Severity and Nonnatives
Many of the differences observed in the studies
mentioned above are associated with the differing
severity of various fires. For example, numerous
studies have documented an increased risk of inva-
sion with increasing fire severity. Crawford et al.
(2001) examined the Hochderffer, Bridger-Knoll,
and Pot fires (see Fig. 1 for the locations of the
wildfires mentioned in this section) 2 years after
burning and found that while nonnative forbs com-
prised the majority of the understory community,
regardless of fire severity, there was a two-fold
increase in nonnative cover in high-severity burns
compared to moderate-severity areas within the
same fires. The list of nonnative species presented
by the authors, however, contained several species
generally considered as native. Reassessing the data
using more conservative yields similar trends,
although they are less dramatic (Table 1). A later
study of the Hochderffer Fire reported that non-
native grasses and forbs comprised 38% of the
standing biomass crop (Sabo et al. 2009). Other
studies have shown differential increases in non-
native forbs along a fire-severity gradient when
monitored a few years after burning. Examining the
Leroux Fire on the San Francisco Peaks, Dodge et
al. (2008) observed an increase in Dalmatian toad-
flax (Linaria dalmatica) in the high-severity burn
class. Common mullein (Verbascum thapsus) spread
into areas burned in the Rattle Burn Fire after 2
years, with greater biomass production in the high-
severity burned areas as compared to low-severity
burned areas (Bataineh et al. 2006).
Not all wildfires have resulted in dramatic
increases in nonnative species. In 2002, the Rodeo-
Chediski Fire burned nearly 500,000 acres on the
White Mountain Apache Reservation and Apache-
Sitgreaves National Forest. The area was seeded
with sterile hybrid wheat (Triticum aesativa) for
erosion control. This species dominated the under-
story temporarily, but was uncommon by 2005.
Aside from an increase in goosefoot (Chenopodium
album) in 2004, no other nonnatives were reported
to be abundant within the fire perimeter (Kuenzi
2006, Kuenzi et al. 2008). Likewise, Crawford and

Straka (2004) reported a slight increase in cheat-
grass abundance after the Outlet Fire on the North
Rim, but total cover remained low. The lack of
nonnative establishment is inherently difficult to
explain, but several possible causes have been
proposed, including lack of seed source, pre-burn
understory conditions, and unfavorable climatic
conditions for nonnatives after the fire. Further
research is needed on this topic.
The Influence of Time since Fire
As we have stated, most studies have shown an
increase in nonnative forbs shortly after wildfire.
With greater time-since-burn, however, the non-
native community consistently becomes dominated
by perennial grasses. For instance, in their 30-year
study of the Rattle Burn Fire, Bataineh et al. (2006)
report a transition in dominance from common mul-
lein to Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis),
although cheatgrass was also prevalent on the site.
The burned area was seeded with nonnative inter-
mediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium), an
indicator species of high-severity burns after 30
years. The Dude Fire in 1990 was seeded with
weeping lovegrass (Eragrostis curvula), an African
grass that comprised 93% of the herbaceous under-
story cover 15 years after the fire, although total
cover was only 3.9% (Leonard 2007). Successional
trends do not always favor nonnative perennial
grasses over short-lived species. Cheatgrass can
interrupt succession, often persisting as the domi-
nant nonnative in a system for many years. On two
isolated plateaus of the North Rim, cheatgrass was
prevalent more than a decade after the last fire.
Laughlin et al. (2004) detected cheatgrass on
approximately 50% of their study plots on Rainbow
Plateau (last fire in 1993) and Powell Plateau (last
fire in 1987). Cheatgrass became more abundant on
both plateaus over time, occurring on 100% of the
plots on Powell Plateau 2 years after the 2003
Powell Fire (Laughlin and Fulé 2008).
PRESCRIBED FIRE AND NONNATIVES
Land managers use prescribed fire to proac-
tively reduce forest fuels, thus lowering the poten-
tial impacts of future wildfires. Increasingly, fuels
reduction treatments incorporate tree thinning prior
to burning to allow for recovery of the understory
vegetative community and better control of the post-
fire forest structure. As with wildfires, prescribed
burning creates a disturbance that may facilitate the
spread of nonnatives into the understory.
Prescribed burning or thinning-and-burning
projects often experience less encroachment by
nonnatives than wildfires, frequently due to the
decreased severity of the fires. Griffis et al. (2001)
compared wildfires with prescribed burns, thinned-
and-burned, and unburned sites (data from studies
on prescribed burning and nonnatives are presented
in Table 2). They observed greater nonnative forb
abundance within the area affected by wildfire than
in the two management treatments and the unburned
areas, which were not detectably different. Non-

native species richness did increase in burned areas,
regardless of whether or not the fire was wild or
managed, but the numbers were low on all sites.
Sabo et al. (2009) reported that more than one-third
of the aboveground biomass on a wildfire site was
nonnative, while few nonnatives were detected on
thinned and burned sites and none on untreated and
thin-only sites. Nonnative biomass production was
also lower on prescribed burns when compared to
the Rattle Burn Fire (Tables 1 and 2; Bataineh et al.
2006).
Thinning and Prescribed Burning
Mechanical thinning of overstocked trees prior
to burning has been shown to improve understory
response when compared to only burning. Reduced
competition with remaining trees and increased light
infiltration play an important role in promoting the
understory. Many nonnatives, however, are shade-
intolerant, ruderal species. This can lead to a greater
risk of invasion as light intensity increases with
increased tree removal. On the South Rim of Grand
Canyon National Park, Fulé et al. (2005) compared
understory response to prescribed burning with two
levels of thinning (full and minimal), burn-only, and
untreated control plots. After 5 years, nonnative
cover and species richness had increased signifi-
cantly in the full-thin treatments. The minimal-thin
had no change in nonnative cover but an increase in
nonnative richness, while burning without thinning
reduced nonnative cover. The control plots had the
lowest nonnative cover and species richness. In a
study at the Fort Valley Experimental Forest outside
of Flagstaff, Arizona, nonnative cover and richness
increased along an increasing thinning-intensity
gradient the first year after treatment (Stoddard et al.
2008). After 6 years, nonnative richness remained
higher in the high- and medium-thinned plots,
although nonnative cover on these plots did decrease
by at least half of the 1-year, post-treatment levels.
Additionally, at the same location, Abella and Cov-
ington (2004) reported an increased frequency of
three nonnative species – Circium vulgare, Linaria
dalmatica, and Verbascum thapsus – along the
thinning-intensity gradient.
Disturbance Severity and Prescribed Fire
As with wildfire, the severity of disturbances in
conjunction with prescribed burning can influence
the level of nonnative establishment in the post-burn
community. This is of particular concern when the
site is thinned prior to burning. Slash piles are a dis-
turbance commonly associated with thinning-and-
burning projects. In the Fort Valley Experimental
Forest, Korb et al. (2004) observed increases in non-
native cover on slash pile scars even when soil and
native seed amendments were applied. In another
north-central Arizona study, diffuse knapweed
(Centauria diffusa) seeds had higher germination
rates in slash pile scars than in neighboring unburn-
ed areas (Wolfson et al. 2005). Moreover, germina-
tion rates of diffuse knapweed increased with
increasing burn severity. Many thinned-and-burned
areas of a large-scale ecological restoration project
on Mt. Trumbull in northern Arizona were seriously
invaded by cheatgrass in 2002 and 2003 (McGlone
et al. 2009). Fuel loads at the time of burn were
heavy, often resulting in high-severity fires. While
many factors were involved in the spread of cheat-
grass across the landscape, nonnative invasion on this
site was higher than others of similar design.
DOMINANT NONNATIVE 
SPECIES ON BURNED SITES
Northern Arizona post-fire communities support
a wide variety of species (Tables 3 and 4). The
studies we reviewed report the presence of only
three species that are listed as noxious in Arizona:
field bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis), Dalmatian
toadflax, and Scotch cottonthistle (Onopordum
acanthium). Many of the nonnative species detected
after fire are, however, listed as noxious in at least
one western state. Several species warrant indi-
vidual discussion.
Cheatgrass
Cheatgrass is an overwintering annual grass
from the Mediterranean and Russian Steppe regions.
During the past century it has invaded large areas of
the Great Basin Desert from southern British
Columbia to northern Arizona (Mack 1981, Knapp
1996). Curiously, it is only listed as a noxious weed
in Colorado and Connecticut. While cheatgrass is
not fire dependent, it is a fire-adapted species that
can alter the frequency and intensity of indigenous
fire regimes because of fine-fuel production (D'An-
tonio and Vitousek 1992). Cheatgrass is generally
associated with lower-elevation life zones such as
desert grasslands, shrublands, and pinyon-juniper
woodlands. The species is, however, becoming
established at higher elevations (~2000m) across a
wide range of fire and other disturbance regimes
(Fisher and Fulé 2004, Loeser et al. 2007, Laughlin
and Fulé 2008, McGlone et al. 2009).
The ability of cheatgrass to persist as an under-
story dominant in ponderosa pine forests is uncer-
tain. The species is generally shade intolerant and
experiences high winter mortality, particularly in
years with a long-lasting snowpack (Pierson et al.
1990, Pierson and Mack 1990). Disturbances and
management activities that increase light infiltration
may promote the establishment and spread of cheat-
grass. Ponderosa pine forests seem to be the highest
elevation life zone that can support an expanding

population of cheatgrass under current climate con-
ditions (Pierson and Mack 1990, Fisher and Fulé
2004).
 Common Mullein
Common mullein, a biennial forb species with
high seed production, enters the plant community
quickly after fire, often becoming the most preva-
lent nonnative species (Crawford et al. 2001, Korb
et al. 2004, Korb et al. 2005, Bataineh et al. 2006,
Stoddard et al. 2008, Sabo et al. 2009). At the Mt.
Trumbull experiment, for example, common mul-
lein seeds comprised 60% of the post-fire seed bank
(Korb et al. 2005). Studies have shown that, with
time, common mullein often reduces in abundance,
becoming a minor component of the post-fire com-
munity (Bataineh et al. 2006, Stoddard et al. 2008).
It is possible, however, that this species could
become an important understory constituent if fires
burn through ponderosa pine forests more fre-
quently. Common mullein is currently listed as
noxious in Colorado and Hawaii.
Kentucky Bluegrass
Kentucky bluegrass is a rhizomatous, mat-
forming grass species usually associated with lawns
and turf applications. While it is commonly perceived
as a nonnative, there is little agreement about its
actual origin. The USDA, NRCS PLANTS Datasbase
(USDA, NRCS, 2009) lists the species as native, but
the Manual of Grasses for North America (Grass
Manual on the Web; http://herbarium.usu.edu/
webmanual) states that the species is native to
Eurasia, except for two arctic and subarctic sub-
species. Studies have shown that a) the species can
persist for many years after fires, and b) it does not
require fire to maintain it in the system (Fisher and
Fulé 2004, Bataineh et al. 2006). Kentucky bluegrass
is not listed as noxious in any state.
Dalmatian Toadflax
Only 6 of the 23 Arizona ponderosa pine post-
fire studies discussed in this article had Dalmatian
toadflax in the herbaceous community, and it was
the dominant nonnative in only one study (Dodge et
al. 2008). The paucity of occurrences of Dalmatian
toadflax in fire studies, however, should not give the
impression that Dalmatian toadflax is an irrelevant
species. It is listed as a noxious weed in 12 states.
Furthermore, it had the second highest post-fire
cover of any species reported in the studies we
reviewed behind lambsquarters (Chenopodium
album) in Crawford et al. (2001).
Dalmatian toadflax is a rhizomatous perennial
forb in the same plant family as common mullein
(Scrophulariaceae). It is a vigorous resprouter that
also produces large quantities of seeds. Dalmatian
toadflax can resprout quickly after fire (Dodge et al.
2008) and can also saturate the seed bank (Korb et al.
2005), giving the species two strategies for estab-
lishing dominance in the understory community.
Other Species
Of the 43 nonnative species reported in articles
reviewed here, few of them beyond the ones men-
tioned above are considered a serious threat to
ponderosa pine ecosystems. Very common after fire
are members of the Cichorieae tribe of the Aster-
aceae family, including common dandelion, prickly
lettuce, yellow salsify (Tragopogon dubius), and
spiny sowthistle (Sonchus asper). None of these
species are listed as noxious weeds in any state.
Field bindweed is listed as a noxious weed in 22
states, more than any other on the post-fire sites
reviewed here. It is primarily an agricultural pest

83

and only two studies report it occurring in post-fire
communities. Bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare) is cap-
able of heavily invading a burned area, although it
does not seem to persist as a dominant in the under-
story. This scenario was observed on the 2000 Pipe
Fire (a wildfire). By 2003, bull thistle was the domi-
nant herbaceous plant on the site, but it was reduced
to only a few individuals by 2007 (Ecological Res-
toration Institute, unpubl. data). 
Another nonnative species of interest is diffuse
knapweed. While this species was not reported on
any of the fires cited here, there is evidence of a
positive relationship between burn intensity and
seed germination in ponderosa pine forests (Wolf-
son et al. 2005). Diffuse knapweed is common in
and around Flagstaff, Arizona, providing a seed
source for spread and establishment of the species in
this region after fire. An extensive list of nonnative
species reported in ponderosa pine forests through-
out the Southwest (i.e., not limited to Arizona) can
be found in Sieg et al. (2003).
FIRE AND NONNATIVES IN 
OTHER NORTH AMERICAN REGIONS
The interactions between fire and nonnatives in
Arizona forests are similar to those seen in other
ponderosa pine ecosystems in the West. In Sierra
Nevada ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forests
burned in prescribed and wildfires, Keeley et al.
(2003) detected significant increases in nonnatives
only in high-severity fires, 3 years after burning.
Cheatgrass was the dominant nonnative on these
burned sites. Prescribed fires in ponderosa pine
forests of the same region were heavily invaded by
cheatgrass 1 year after burning (Keeley and McGin-
nis 2007). Cheatgrass was already established in
nearby areas, so rapid invasion was not surprising.
Bull thistle and cheatgrass invaded ponderosa pine
forests in Oregon after prescribed burns in the fall,
but not after spring burns (Kerns et al. 2006). This
was positively related to the severity gradient of the
fires. In Montana, thinned-and-burned ponderosa
pine forests had significantly higher cover of trans-
former species (i.e., plants that substantively alter
the ecosystem they invade [Richardson et al. 2000])
3 years after burning than was detected in thin-only
and untreated control plots (Dodson and Fiedler
2006). Logged areas in South Dakota also experi-
enced an increase in nonnatives, but this invasion
followed a cutting-severity gradient first, with
burned sites having more nonnative biomass than
unburned sites except in clearcut areas where the
reverse was true (Wienk et al. 2004). The gradients
were driven primarily by prickly lettuce, which is
not usually considered a management priority.
FUTURE CONCERNS AND RESEARCH NEEDS
While nonnative species continue to be a major
cause for concern in post-fire ponderosa pine for-
ests, their impact in these ecosystems has been
limited so far, especially when compared to the sit-
uation in lower-elevation ecosystems. Only three
studies reported having greater than 10% cover of
nonnative species in burned areas by the end of the
study. Of these, two were on wildfires (Crawford et
al. 2001, Dodge et al. 2008; Table 1) and one on a
tree thinning and prescribed fire study (McGlone et
al. 2009; Table 2). Several studies reported a
species-rich, nonnative community (Crawford et al.
2001, Bataineh et al. 2006, Kuenzi 2006, Fowler et
al. 2008, Kuenzi et al. 2008, McGlone et al. 2009),
while other sites have widely distributed, but
species poor, nonnative communities (Crawford and
Straka 2004, Laughlin and Fulé 2008). This sug-
gests that these communities may be at risk of future
invasion given the proper ecological or climatic
conditions. To date, however, severe invasions have
been rare in Arizona ponderosa pine forests.
Mechanisms for Nonnative Invasion
The mechanisms for nonnative invasion are
poorly understood. A facilitative disturbance cou-
pled with the availability of propagules is generally
viewed as essential for a successful invasion (Hobbs
and Huenneke 1992, Williamson 1996), although
there are documented invasions in relatively
undisturbed areas (Belnap and Phillips 2001, Evans
et al. 2001). Some of the studies included here
conform to the classic paradigm of a severe disturb-
ance coupled with propagule availability leading to
a nonnative species invasion (Crawford et al. 2001,
Dodge et al. 2008, McGlone et al. 2009). The
results of several studies do not conform to this
paradigm, however, with only low levels of non-
natives establishing after fire (Fulé et al. 2005,
Kuenzi 2006, Kuenzi et al. 2008, Stoddard et al.
2008). Further study is needed to understand the
role of disturbance, timing of climatic conditions,
predisturbance management practices, and post-fire
successional trends in facilitating or inhibiting the
spread of nonnative plants into burned areas.
Climate Change
Climate change may alter invasion dynamics in
Arizona ponderosa pine forests, as well as in many
other systems and regions. Current climate change
trends may lead to an increase in wildfire activity
(McKenzie et al. 2004, Westerling et al. 2006). This
could increase nonnative establishment and spread
into forested areas. Additionally, warmer and drier
conditions are predicted for the Southwest in gen-
eral (Seager et al. 2007), making forests more hos-

pitable to lower-elevation species. Bradley et al.
(2009) propose that species distributions will shift
to make some habitats more suitable for nonnative
species, while other nonnatives will decline in some
areas of their current distribution. For example,
yellow starthistle (Centauria solstitialis), a minor
component of the understory around Flagstaff, but
a serious invasive in California grasslands, has a
high likelihood of retreating from the mountainous
areas of Arizona with a moderate risk expanding
into the grasslands of the Four Corners and many
western states. Cheatgrass, on the other hand, may
expand in the northern half of the western United
States, but higher temperatures may actually restrict
its range in the Southwest.
This suspected shift in nonnative ranges may be
somewhat of an academic point when discussing
ponderosa pine ecosystems since most models also
predict shifts in coniferous tree distributions with
climate change, including ponderosa pine forests
(Shafer et al. 2001, Lenihan et al. 2003). While cli-
mate change may indeed promote nonnative species
range expansion into current ponderosa pine forests,
the pines may be exiting the region at the same time.
