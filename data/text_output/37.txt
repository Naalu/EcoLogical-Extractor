ABSTRACT: Thinning and burning treatments based on forest conditions present before Euro-American
settlement have been proposed to improve growth of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) in northern Arizona.
We examined tree growth response to different levels of such treatments and compared growth response
between old trees that established before Euro-American settlement (presettlement trees) and younger trees
that established after Euro-American settlement (postsettlement trees). We made these comparisons for 3
years of posttreatment growth in northern Arizona stands subjected to four levels of thinning. Thinning
treatments varied the number of postsettlement trees retained to replace dead presettlement trees. Thinning
increased radial growth at breast height of postsettlement trees in all 3 years after treatment, and growth
response was negatively correlated with posttreatment stand basal area. In contrast, growth of presettle-
ment trees was not affected by thinning in most years, and there was no relationship between growth and
posttreatment stand basal area. Application of the same thinning prescription to stands with different
management history resulted in different posttreatment basal area and consequently different growth
response to thinning for postsettlement trees. Our results show that growth of 80-year-old, postsettlement
ponderosa pines is more responsive to restoration thinning than older presettlement trees, and provide
guidelines for thinning levels needed to stimulate growth of presettlement trees. West. J. Appl. For. 20(1):

Changes to ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of
the southwestern United States due to past and current land
management practices are well documented (Cooper 1960,
Covington and Moore 1994, Covington et al. 1997, Fule´ et
al. 1997). Fire suppression, overgrazing, and other factors
produced today’s dense forests that are characterized by
stunted young trees, declining old trees, and dangerously
high fuel loading (Covington and Moore 1994, Covington et
al. 1997, Dahms and Geils 1997). Forest and wildlife man-
agers, researchers, and concerned citizen groups are strug-
gling to agree on solutions to improve forest health and
reduce threats of fire and insect outbreak. Such solutions
should reduce forest floor fuel loading, reduce “ladder fu-
els” in the understory, and increase the growth and insect
resistance of trees. Furthermore, because large, old trees are
scarce in the southwestern United States due to past har-
vests, management to reinvigorate declining old trees and
stimulate growth of young trees as replacements is desired.
Most solutions to improve the condition of southwestern
ponderosa pine forests include thinning, prescribed fire, or a
combination of the two. Some researchers and managers
advocate the use of conditions that occurred prior to Euro-
American settlement (i.e., presettlement) as a model for
today’s forest management (Covington et al. 1997, Moore et

al. 1999). Such a model has been justified because presettle-
ment conditions and processes are assumed to best represent
factors that shaped the evolution of forest communities
(Covington et al. 1997, Moore et al. 1999). Questions about
such models center on the difficulty in knowing presettle-
ment conditions, the relevance of presettlement conditions
to current and future desired conditions and environments
(Wagner et al. 2000, Baker and Ehle 2001), and the effec-
tiveness of such models in moving forests toward desired,
healthier conditions.
Ponderosa pines growing in dense, highly competitive
stands grow slowly and are thought to be more susceptible
to attack by insects and diseases that favor stressed trees
(Larsson et al. 1983, Schmid and Mata 1992, Olsen et al.
1996). Thinning crowded stands of ponderosa pine in the
Southwest reduces competition and increases tree water and
nitrogen uptake, growth, and resistance to some insects
(Feeney et al. 1998, Kolb et al. 1998, Stone et al. 1999).
Both presettlement and postsettlement ponderosa pines
grow slowly when stressed by competition, and may be
released from competition by appropriate thinning (Ronco
et al. 1985, Cochran and Barret 1993, Kolb et al. 1998,
Feeney et al. 1998, Stone et al. 1999, Latham and Tappeiner
2002, McDowell et al. 2003). Previous studies of thinning in
ponderosa pine forests in the Southwestern United States
focused on either postsettlement trees (i.e., established after
Euro-American settlement) that were evenly spaced (Ronco
et al. 1985, Kolb et al. 1998), or on presettlement trees in
areas restored to presettlement stand structure (Feeney et al.
1998, Stone et al. 1999). No previous work in the Southwest
has compared growth response to restoration treatments
between presettlement and postsettlement trees that have
subsisted for 80 or more years under intense competition.
Old trees may differ physiologically from young trees.
Old trees may have higher maintenance respiration demands
due to a lower ratio of photosynthetic to nonphotosynthetic
tissue (Ryan et al. 1997). A longer path length for water
flow from soil to leaf for old trees decreases hydraulic
conductance, which may limit water supply to foliage and
thereby limit photosynthetic rate (Ryan and Yoder 1997).
Slow growth of old ponderosa pines has been attributed to
these and other factors (Yoder et al. 1994, Hubbard et al.
1999, Williams et al. 2001, McDowell et al. 2003).
This study examines the efficacy of forest thinning treat-
ments based on site-specific, presettlement conditions mod-
ified to leave more trees than the estimated presettlement
density. These treatments are lower-intensity alternatives to
the heavy thinning treatments required to restore stand
density and stocking to presettlement levels (Covington et
al. 1997, Feeney et al. 1998), which are objectionable to
some citizens groups. Thinning treatments based on evi-
dence of presettlement trees are not homogenous across the
landscape, even within a prescription, because of variations
in density and spatial pattern of presettlement tree evidences
such as stumps, snags, stumpholes and downed logs. We
compared the same thinning prescriptions among three dif-
ferent sites to assess the influences of landscape variability
on treatment effects on tree radial growth. We expected
heavier thinning to decrease competition and increase radial
growth for both presettlement and postsettlement trees. We
also predicted a greater radial growth response to thinning
by postsettlement than presettlement trees.
Methods
Study Site
The Fort Valley Experimental Forest is located 10 km
NW of Flagstaff, AZ (35°15 58 N lat. and 111°4213 W
long., elev. 2,200 m). Mean annual precipitation is 57 cm
with roughly half falling as snow in the winter and half as
rain during the summer monsoon season (July-Sept.; Schu-
bert 1974). The basalt-derived soils are classified as fine
montmorillonitic complex of frigid Typic Argiboroll and
Mollic Eutroboralf (Mast et al. 1999). The average frost-
free season is 94 days (Schubert 1974). Ponderosa pine is
the dominant tree species (99.8% of trees in plots). Table 1
shows pretreatment stand conditions (Fule´ et al. 1999).
Postsettlement trees 30 cm diameter at breast height (1.4
m above the base of each tree, dbh) dominate this forest, but
larger, presettlement trees (dbh  40 cm) also occur.

Thinning and Burning Treatments
Treatments included three levels of thinning followed by
prescribed fire and an unthinned and unburned control. Each
treatment was implemented on three different sites in a 10
km2 area within or adjacent to the Fort Valley Experimental
Forest (Coconino National Forest). Site 1 had flat topogra-
phy, Site 2 had 5–15% slope, and Site 3 had 6% slope.
Each site was divided into four units, each approximately
17 ha, and thinning treatments were randomly assigned to
the units. Treatments consisted of an unthinned control, 3–6
treatment, 2–4 treatment, and 1.5–3 treatment. Unthinned
controls consisted of a dense stand of pole-sized postsettle-
ment trees with some larger, interspersed presettlement
trees. All presettlement trees were retained in thinned treat-
ments. Postsettlement trees left after thinning were selected
to replace dead presettlement trees based on the occurrence
of snags, downed trees, stumps, and stumpholes. Postsettle-
ment leave trees were located within a 60-m radius of each
presettlement tree evidence. The 1.5–3 treatment retained an
average of 1.5 leave trees 40 cm dbh or three smaller trees
for every evidence of a dead presettlement tree. The 2–4
treatment retained two trees 40 cm dbh or four smaller
trees for every evidence of a dead presettlement tree. The
3–6 treatment retained three leave trees 40 cm dbh or six
smaller trees for every evidence of a dead presettlement
tree. In every case, larger postsettlement trees were favored
for retention over smaller trees. All thinning treatments
included understory broadcast burns (described below), but
unthinned controls were not burned.
Thinning occurred between Dec. 1998 and Sept. 1999.
Trees were felled by chainsaws (Site 2), a feller-buncher
vehicle (Site 1), and a cut-to-length head on a small exca-
vator (Site 3). All the treatments within a site were thinned
with the same equipment. Boles were hauled to landings by
rubber-tire skidders and small dozers and removed from the
sites. All thinning treatments were completed before the
1999 growing season except for the 2–4 treatment in Site 1
and the 3–6 treatment in Site 2. These were thinned during
the 1999 growing season.
Table 1 shows pre- and posttreatment average stand
basal area (BA), stand density index (SDI), and trees per
hectare (TPH) in each site and treatment. Stand density
index is a measure of stand stocking relative to a theoretical
optimal stocking such that SDI  TPA(Dq/10)1.605 where
TPA is trees/acre and Dq is quadratic mean diameter
(Reineke 1933). Thinning reduced BA least at Site 1, most
at Site 3, and Site 2 was intermediate. Thinning had a
greater impact on BA and SDI of Site 3, which had fewer
large old trees than on Site 1, which had many (Table 1).
Branches in thinned treatments at all sites were piled and
burned. At Site 3, branches were piled in the summer of
1999 and burned in the winter of 2000 under snowy con-
ditions. At Sites 1 and 2, branches were piled by hand and
machine in the summer of 2000, and burned in Feb. 2001.
After slash piles were burned, low-intensity, understory
broadcast burns were conducted in the remaining fuel bed
(duff, litter, remaining branches). Broadcast burns used
spot/strip-firing techniques with drip-torches. Before burn-
ing, duff and needle litter were raked away from the base of
every presettlement tree to minimize heat girdling. This was
not necessary for postsettlement trees because they did not
have large amounts of litter at their base due to smaller
crowns and fewer years of needle accumulation. Broadcast
burns of all treatments occurred Spring 2000 at Site 3 and
Spring 2001 at Site 2. At Site 1, the 1.5–3 treatment was
broadcast burned Spring 2001 and the other treatments were
burned July 2001. These burns were of low intensity to
minimize damage to tree roots, boles, or crown. Flame
lengths were 15–30 cm in needle litter and 60–120 cm in
woody slash. Rate of fire spread was between 0 and 40
m/hour. Grassy areas did not carry fire. Crown and bole
scorch was less than 10% on all sampled trees, and none of
our study trees died between burning and 2002.
Radial Growth Data
Increment cores were collected between Nov. 2001 and
Jan. 2002. Ten representative presettlement and ten post-
settlement trees were selected in each treatment at each site
(n  80 per site). Selected postsettlement trees were 19–39
cm dbh and 14–22 m tall. Selected presettlement trees were
55–80 cm dbh and 22–32 m tall. Most postsettlement trees
in this area established around 1919 in a regeneration event
that combined favorable climate for seedling establishment
with a lack of fire to thin seedlings (Savage et al. 1996).
Therefore most postsettlement trees were approximately 80
years old at the time of our study. Presettlement trees in this
area are 150–450 years old (Mast et al. 1999). Each tree
was cored in three locations around the circumference at
breast height: 0°, 120°, and 240° relative to true north.
Cores were shallow to sample growth since treatment and
10–20 years before treatment.
Cores were mounted and sanded with increasingly finer
grit sandpaper (120, 220, 320, and 400 grit) and ring widths
were measured using a banister-type dendrometer (0.001
mm accuracy) and MeasureJ2X software (ProjectJ2X,
Voortech Consulting, Sandwich, NH). Particular care was
taken to identify small or missing rings for 1996 and 2000,
which were the only severe drought years between 1989 and
2001. We averaged yearly radial growth for the 10 years
before treatment (1989–1998) for each core. This average
provides a summary of the recent growth of each individual
tree over a variety of weather conditions.
Years 1999, 2000, and 2001 were considered posttreat-
ment years, except for the 2–4 treatment in Site 1 and the
3–6 treatment in Site 2, which were completed during the
1999 growing season. Thus, care should be taken in inter-
preting results for 1999 and posttreatment average growth
of these two treatment areas. Posttreatment growth in each
year was divided by the average 10-year pretreatment
growth to produce a proportional change in radial growth in
response to thinning for each tree. We calculated this
growth response to thinning for each posttreatment year
because the years differed in weather characteristics (see
results) and time since thinning. This proportional change in
radial growth allowed us to compare the growth response of
pre- and postsettlement trees, which have different annual
38
WJAF 20(1) 2005

growth increments. Differences in climate between pre- and
posttreatment years may have influenced this measure of
growth response, but these effects should be similar for all
treatments and tree sizes. Similar methods of using each tree
as its own control have been used in previous studies
(Salonius et al. 1982, Reinhardt and Ryan 1988). Propor-
tional changes calculated from radial growth increment may
be less than those calculated from basal area increment, but
Salonius et al. (1982) found similar changes in both of these
proportions in response to treatments that stimulated tree
growth.
Data Analysis
We used SAS JMP software (SAS Institute Inc. Cary,
NC) to perform repeated measures analysis of variance
(ANOVA) on radial growth data with site (1, 2, and 3),
treatment (control, 3–6, 2–4, 1.5–3), tree size (pre versus
postsettlement), and their interactions as factors, and with
year (1999, 2000, 2001) as the repeated factor. We used t
tests to compare means. We also used multiple regression
models to analyze effects of stand density and stocking on
average and yearly percent change in growth response to
thinning.
Results
Year and all its interactions (except year  site  tree
size) were significant sources of variation in radial growth
(Table 2). Interactions between site and treatment, year, and
tree size were also significant (Table 2), which indicates that
differences in growth among treatments, years, and tree
sizes differed among sites. Thus, we present differences
among treatments separately by site and year for each tree
size (Figures 1–3).
Year 1999 was the first growing season after thinning
and was before burning. The Palmer Drought Severity
Index (PDSI, http://lwf.nedc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/onlineprod/
drought/xmgrgl.html) was 0.83 for 1999 in the Flagstaff
area (National Climate Data Center, http://www.lfw.ncdc.
noaa.gov/servlets/ACS?stnid20001230). PSDI is an index
of drought based on temperature and precipitation with 2
defined as moderate drought, 4 as extreme drought, and
positive numbers indicating wet conditions. Year 2000 was
a severe drought year with a PSDI of 3.34 (National
Climate Data Center). Year 2001 was the third year after
thinning and was somewhat dry with a PDSI of 1.14
(National Climate Data Center).
In 1999, average radial growth was greater in all thinned
treatments versus the control for presettlement trees in Site
1 and for postsettlement trees in Site 2 (Figure 1). Radial
growth also was greater for postsettlement trees in the 2–4
and 1.5–3 treatments versus the control in Site 3 (Figure 1).
The later thinning of the 2–4 treatment in Site 1 and the 3–6
treatment in Site 2 apparently did not strongly affect the

growth response in these treatments, as they were not sig-
nificantly different from the other thinned treatments at
those sites in 1999.
In 2000 and 2001, radial growth of postsettlement trees
was greater in all thinned treatments than the control in Sites
1 and 2 (Figures 2 and 3). In Site 3, growth of postsettle-
ment trees was greater in the 2–4 and the 1.5–3 treatments
than in the 3–6 or control treatments (Figures 2 and 3).
Radial growth of presettlement trees in 2000 and 2001 did
not differ among treatments at any site (Figures 2 and 3).
In Site 1, growth of postsettlement trees was greater than
growth of presettlement trees in the control and 2–4 treat-
ment in 1999 (Figure 1) and in the 3–6 treatment in 2000
(Figure 2). In Site 2, postsettlement trees had greater growth
than presettlement trees in all thinned treatments in every
year (Figures 1–3). In Site 3, postsettlement trees had
greater growth than presettlement trees in the 2–4 and 1.5–3
treatments in 1999 (Figure 1), in the 1.5–3 treatment in 2000
(Figure 2), and in the 2–4 treatment in 2001 (Figure 3).
Tree radial growth after thinning was related to charac-
teristics of tree density and stocking (Figure 4). In every
regression, the interaction between characteristics of stand
stocking level (posttreatment BA, percent reduction in BA,
posttreatment SDI) and tree size was significant (Figure 4),
indicating that tree growth response to changes in stand
stocking differed between post and presettlement trees. For
example, growth of postsettlement trees was negatively
correlated with posttreatment BA in every year, but growth
of presettlement trees was not (Figure 4). The growth re-
sponse of postsettlement trees to posttreatment BA did not
differ significantly among years, as indicated by a compar-
ison of slope coefficients among years (P  0.10). Rela-
tionships between growth and posttreatment SDI or percent

change in BA (data not shown) were similar to relationships
shown for posttreatment BA in Figure 4.
Discussion
Radial growth varied among the posttreatment years of
our study. Available water is the greatest limiting factor to
tree growth in many forests in the Southwestern United
States (Fritts 1974), which likely explains the common
occurrence of posttreatment to pretreatment ratios of radial
growth  1.0 in 2000, the driest year in our study (PDSI 
3.34). In that year, posttreatment growth was lower than
pretreatment growth in all sites and treatments, except for
postsettlement trees in the 2–4 and 1.5–3 treatments at Sites
2 and 3 in which pre- and posttreatment growth were
approximately equivalent (ratio near 1.0). Similar results
occurred in the next year (2001) under milder drought
conditions (PDSI  1.14), which suggests a carry-over
effect of the severe 2000 drought on tree growth. These
results suggest that the 2–4 and 1.5–3 thinning treatments
ameliorated impacts of the severe 2000 drought on growth
of postsettlement trees, whereas little amelioration occurred
for presettlement trees.
Growth response to thinning treatments typically was
greater for postsettlement than presettlement trees. Radial
growth of postsettlement trees generally responded posi-
tively to thinning, whereas growth of presettlement trees did
not respond to thinning except at Site 1 in 1999 and Site 3
in 2000 and 2001. There are several possible explanations
for the lack of growth response to thinning of presettlement
trees in our study. Several studies of ponderosa pine have
examined the role of increased hydraulic resistance in slow-
ing growth and photosynthesis in large, old trees compared
to smaller, younger trees (Yoder et al. 1994, Ryan and
Yoder 1997, Hubbard et al. 1999, Kolb and Stone 2000,
Williams et al. 2001). These studies suggest that resistance
to water movement from soil to leaf limits stomatal con-
ductance and photosynthesis more in old than young trees.
Skov et al. (2004) found that hydraulic conductance of
presettlement trees was lower than that of postsettlement
trees in these thinned and burned treatments. Hydraulic

constraints on photosynthesis associated with large tree size
may have limited growth response to thinning of presettle-
ment trees in our study.
Another possible explanation is delayed growth response
to thinning by older trees. Latham and Tappeiner (2002)
measured increased bole radial growth in 160- to 380-year-
old ponderosa pines in Oregon, 20–30 years after thinning
to medium (28–58 m2/ha) and low (4–18 m2/ha) basal
areas. Increased growth after thinning usually did not start
until 5 years after treatment, with the greatest growth re-
sponse occurring 20 years after treatment. These results
suggest a lag in radial growth response to thinning in old
ponderosa pine when measured at breast height. For exam-
ple, thinning increased stomatal conductance and net pho-
tosynthesis 3 years before radial growth increased for old
ponderosa pines in eastern Oregon (McDowell et al. 2003),
and in our study, thinning increased stomatal conductance
and photosynthesis of presettlement trees in the first year
after thinning (Skov et al. 2004). Thus, it is possible that
future growth of the presettlement trees in our study will
increase in response to this thinning. Also, thinning may
have increased wood growth higher on the bole, or in-
creased growth of other tissues (leaves, roots) of presettle-
ment trees that we did not measure
At the Gus Pearson Natural Area near our study area,
Feeney et al. (1998) found that presettlement ponderosa
pine trees in thinned treatments based on the presettlement
restoration model had significantly more radial growth at
breast height than presettlement trees in an untreated control
within 2 years of thinning. These trees grew in a previously
unharvested area with a pretreatment basal area of 34.5
m2/ha and posttreatment basal area of 13.0 m2/ha. In our
study, only the 2–4 and 1.5–3 thinning treatments at Site 3
had posttreatment basal areas this low. Radial growth of
presettlement trees in these treatments increased compared
with the control only in year 2000, the driest year included
in our study. The results of Feeney et al. (1998) and our
study suggest that thinning based on the presettlement res-
toration model must reduce basal area below about 16 m2/ha
to quickly increase radial growth of presettlement pon-
derosa pines in northern Arizona. Effects of restoration
thinning and burning treatments on radial growth of pre-
settlement trees in the Feeney et al. (1998) study were also
greater in a dry (1996) versus a wet (1995) year, which is
similar to our finding of a growth increase in response to
thinning by presettlement trees only in the driest year
(2000). Thus, competition between mature postsettlement
and presettlement ponderosa pines at our study sites in
northern Arizona appears to be greatest in severe drought
years.
Local competition (within 0.04-ha circular plots around
study trees) explained 25% of the variation in growth re-
sponse to thinning of old ponderosa pines in Oregon
(Latham and Tappeiner 2002). Thus, the clumped occur-
rence of presettlement trees and deliberately clumpy ar-
rangement of leave trees in the thinning treatments in our
study may be another factor explaining the lower growth
response of presettlement trees compared with postsettle-
ment trees. Average stand BA and SDI may be insufficient
measures of the actual competition experienced by these old
trees after thinning.
The method of leave-tree selection used in our study can
produce differences in tree density, basal area, and tree
spatial arrangement among sites after thinning. These post-
treatment differences can result from variations in density
and spatial arrangement of evidences of dead presettlement
trees, and from variations in density of living presettlement
trees, which are always retained in these thinning prescrip-
tions. For example, the thinning treatments on Site 1, which
had more living presettlement trees than the other sites,
reduced stand BA and SDI least of all sites, and tree growth
response to thinning was smallest on this site. Also, man-
agement history may influence the number of presettlement
snags, stumps, and stumpholes found on a site, and therefore
the number of leave-trees assigned to that site. For example,
most presettlement trees were harvested in the past from
Site 3, thus thinning treatments decreased BA and SDI most
at this site, and tree growth responses were greater.
Our results have important management implications.
First, the postsettlement trees in our study increased radial
growth in response to thinning in the first year after treat-
ment and did not experience “thinning shock,” or a reduc-
tion in growth after thinning, even after about 80 years of
growing at a high density. As presettlement trees decline,
increasing growth rates of replacement postsettlement trees
becomes more important for producing stands with old-
growth characteristics. Second, growth of presettlement
trees generally did not increase after these thinning treat-
ments within 3 years of treatment. These old trees require
heavy thinning to quickly stimulate growth, such as the
treatment used in the Gus Pearson Natural Area (Feeney et
al. 1998), which attempted to completely restore presettle-
ment stand structure, rather than mimic such structure at
higher densities as was done in our study. It is possible that
these old presettlement trees will show a delayed growth
response to thinning, or obtain benefits from thinning not
measured by this study. Nevertheless, if quick stimulation
of radial growth in presettlement trees is a management
priority, thinning intensity must be considered carefully.
Finally, although we could not isolate effects of the low-in-
tensity prescribed burns used in these treatments, most
postsettlement trees grew faster after thinning and burning
than before treatment. Thus, any potential negative effects
of fuel reduction burns on tree growth were offset by
thinning treatments that increased growth.
