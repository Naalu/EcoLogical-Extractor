Budgeting for monitoring
Collaborative Forest Restoration Program
January 2005

The multiparty monitoring handbook series
This multiparty monitoring handbook is part of a series of guides to
monitoring collaborative forest restoration projects. The series was written
specifically for projects funded through the USDA Forest Service’s
Collaborative Forest Restoration Program (CFRP). The Handbooks in the
series are:
Handbook 1—What is multiparty monitoring?
Handbook 2—Developing a multiparty monitoring plan
Handbook 3—Budgeting for monitoring projects
Handbook 4—Monitoring ecological effects
Handbook 5—Monitoring social and economic effects
Handbook 6—Analyzing and interpreting monitoring data
Multiparty monitoring is required of all CFRP grantees; however, the
methods and approaches presented in these workbooks are to serve as
guides and references only. The specific methods are NOT required.
Because there is a wide diversity of projects funded through the CFRP,
many grantees will have different requirements for monitoring and/or
monitoring assistance.
The content of these handbooks was largely conceived at a series of
workshops held in 2003 that were sponsored by the following:
Ecological Restoration Institute (ERI), Forest Trust, Four Corners
Institute, National Forest Foundation, Pinchot Institute for
Conservation, USDA Forest Service—Collaborative Forest
Restoration Program.
These handbooks are updated periodically and the latest versions will
be available on the Collaborative Forest Restoration Program Web site
at www.fs.fed.us/r3/spf/cfrp/monitoring. For more information on this
series, contact the Ecological Restoration Institute, Box 15017, Flagstaff
AZ 86011-5017.
CFRP grantees are also eligible for multiparty monitoring training
workshops and technical assistance from the CFRP monitoring team. This
free service will be provided through September 2006. Call 866.614.8424
for details.

In-kind contributions refer to
project expenses that are paid for or
donated from a source other than
the CFRP grant.

Since CFRP grants are federal
funds, the in-kind match cannot
come from another federal source.
How big is the monitoring bank?
As part of the planning process, monitoring teams select goals and
indicators that are important to their group. Many times, groups
create a lengthy list of items only to find that they have neither the
time nor the money to carefully monitor all that is on the list.
There are helpful examples from existing CFRP grantees that
show ways to make monitoring budgets work. This handbook
provides the following information:
w How to establish realistic budgets,
w Sample budgets from existing projects, and
w Potential sources of funding to supplement ambitious
monitoring efforts.
Establishing realistic budgets______________________________________
Monitoring budgets vary, depending on what exactly a group
chooses to monitor. The primary costs associated with monitoring
are salaries, equipment, and transportation. Some people estimate
that monitoring efforts should be roughly ten percent of the total
budget for any given project. However, ten percent may not
always be enough to complete a large monitoring project. The
sample budgets in this handbook fall within the range of one
percent to ten percent of overall project costs.
One of the ways to bring creativity to a budget and stretch it
considerably, is to use in-kind (non-CFRP) sources for salaries,
equipment, or transportation. For example, a teacher who is
already receiving a school salary may contribute to a project
without using any CFRP funds. The teacher’s time and other
project-related expenses could then be counted as an in-kind
contribution. Borrowing equipment from a local nonprofit
organization is another example of an in-kind contribution to a
project. In-kind contributions are a requirement of all CFRP
projects.

2
Salary costs_____________________________________________________
Some CFRP projects hire an individual specifically to carry out
monitoring work once their multiparty monitoring team has
selected goals and indicators. Other groups rely on many people,
each of whom works on certain aspects of a monitoring project.
Regardless, salaries for monitoring efforts can add up quickly.
There are many options for hiring or paying people to lead a
monitoring effort or collect data. Some examples include:
w Hiring a consultant who has particular expertise in the
areas to be monitored
w Working with a science class and/or hiring a school
teacher part time to collect data with the class or on
his/her own time
w Employing or working with nearby youth crews to carry
out data collection
w Involving a project member or stakeholder who also
works on other aspects of the project
Of these examples, the most expensive is hiring a consultant,
but this may also be the most efficient way to get monitoring
done. Consultants shouldn’t require training and should be
able to step right into a monitoring project. For others, it may be
necessary to provide training, and this could increase the cost to
the project.
The amount required for salaries will vary based on the type of
workers used to collect and analyze monitoring data and the
extent of the monitoring program. This makes it very difficult
to generalize about salary costs. The sample monitoring
budgets in the next section show salary costs associated with
three different monitoring projects. Table 1 on page 3
summarizes rates of pay for a variety of personnel, based on
actual project budgets.
It is important to keep in mind that even fairly extensive
monitoring projects may not require more than two or three
weeks of full-time work, or 80–120 hours to complete

monitoring in a given season. This would put salary costs at
anywhere from $800–$12,000 per year, depending on the type
of worker employed and the amount of time required to carry
out monitoring tasks.
Equipment costs_________________________________________________
Equipment costs for ecological monitoring can range from a few
hundred dollars to a few thousand, depending on the type and
amount of equipment needed. Table 2 on the next page lists
common types of monitoring equipment and their costs. It may be
possible to locate or borrow at least some equipment from local
sources. These might include a collaborating agency, such as the
Forest Service, or a nonprofit organization or university that is
involved with the project.
The
most
expensive
pieces
of
equipment
for
ecological
monitoring are a Global Positioning System (GPS) unit and
photographic equipment. These items can cost anywhere from
$150–300 or more. Along with the initial purchase of equipment,
there is an additional expense of the software and computer
technology necessary to use the data collected with GPS or digital
cameras. Film processing for 35 mm cameras can also become very
expensive. It may be worthwhile to borrow or share these items

with other agencies, organizations, or projects, whenever possible.
It may be that your monitoring team decides that some equipment
is not essential to the project. GPS, while producing useful maps
of the locations of data, does not currently have the precision
necessary to replace stakes or other physical markers of plots, and
it may be that foregoing the latest in technology can save your
project money.
The Ben Meadows Company is a good source of equipment for
ecological field sampling. They can be contacted at Box 5277,
Janesville WI 53547; 1.800.241.6401; or www.benmeadows.com.
Another good equipment source is Forestry Suppliers, Inc., 205
West Rankin St., Box 8397, Jackson MS 39284, 610.354.3565,
www.forestry-suppliers.com. Items such as field notebooks,
permanent-ink markers, tape recording, or camera equipment
may be found at most office supply stores. Some on-line retailers
offer good deals on camera equipment and other items.
Transportation costs______________________________________________
Transportation costs for monitoring include vehicle gas and
maintenance for people using personal vehicles to commute to
and from a worksite. Transportation costs can become significant
for projects located in more remote areas of national forest land,
where distances can add up. Your monitoring budget should
include the cost of reimbursing monitoring team members and
other workers for their driving expenses. If consultants are hired,
they may also request payment for transportation, and if the
consultant does not live very close to the site this can become a big
expense.
The most common way of estimating transportation costs is by
mile, and the current standard reimbursement rate is $0.36/mile.
So, to calculate the total transportation costs for one season of
monitoring, use the following formula:
(number of miles round-trip) x (number of trips per season)  x ($0.36/mile)
Equipment suppliers include:

For example, if the project site is located 20 miles from town and
10 trips are estimated, this would be:
Sometimes it is possible to negotiate a lower transportation
reimbursement rate or to have a project member donate this cost
as an in-kind expense. The cost is a real one, though, so it is a good
idea to budget a certain amount for transportation so that people
can afford to stick with the project.
Sample monitoring budgets
The following budget examples are from projects funded by the
Collaborative Forest Restoration Program. Some of the budgets
have been slightly modified, and organization names have been
removed simply to put focus on the budgets rather than on the
projects or certain groups. These examples represent a range of
projects, both in the extent of the monitoring and in the number
of individuals involved.
Project #1 – Budgeting for consultants
For this project, both ecological and economic data were to be
monitored. The project planned to hire two separate consultants,
one to collect and analyze ecological data, and one to monitor
economic impacts. The project leaders calculated a total
monitoring budget of $19,000 for four years, which was five
percent of the total project budget.
Ecological monitoring was to evaluate the following:
w changes in overstory canopy cover;
w changes in woody species density, basal area, and
composition;
40 miles/round-trip x 10 trips x $0.36/mile = $144 for the season

7
w changes in understory canopy cover including grass, forb,
and shrub density and composition;
w changes in overall species richness;
w changes in soil stability and susceptibility to erosion; and
w The project’s effectiveness at increasing understory
complexity while reducing the likelihood of unnatural
crown fire.
Baseline data for all of these indicators were to be collected in Year
1, and post-treatment data were to be collected in Years 2, 3, and 4.
Total time estimates were greater for Years 1 and 4, when transects
and plots needed to be established or greater amounts of
information were to be collected.
Table 3 shows the project’s budget for hiring an ecological
monitoring consultant. Rather than being paid on an hourly basis,
the ecological consultant was paid a lump sum for monitoring
work each year. For example, in the first year, two weeks of work
were budgeted at $5,000. The cost for hiring an ecological
monitoring consultant totaled $15,000 over four years, accounting
for less than five percent of the total project budget.

Economic monitoring for this project was to evaluate the
economic benefit related to:
w the volume of wood extracted, and the value to local
residents of this resource;
w the supply of existing markets and any new strategies or
businesses that developed to use small diameter wood;
w the number of service contracts offered to commercial
operators from adjacent communities;
w the number of additional jobs supported by fuelwood
collection during the project;
w the number of youth trained in forest restoration
practices; and
w the value of acreage restored and/or treated for fuel
management.
In order to achieve this, the project hired a community member to
collect and analyze data from Years 2–4. The budget provided a
lump-sum payment to this economic consultant of $4,000, or
approximately one percent of the total project budget.
Project #2 – Budgeting for a youth crew
This project called for monitoring of three ecological variables:
w Changes in overstory canopy cover
w Changes in woody species density, basal area, and
composition
w Changes in understory canopy cover including grass,
forb and shrub density
The project coordinator worked to identify youth to participate in
monitoring and coordinated their training and the timing of
monitoring. Training was provided by an outside source at no
charge to the project. Youth worked for one week each in Years 1
and 2 and for two weeks in Year 3, and were paid at a rate of
$8/hour. Because the project area was small, the amount of time,
including youth training, was also small, as is reflected in the

9
budget shown in Table 4. The monitoring budget was just under
$4,000, or approximately one percent of the total project budget.
Project #3 – Budgeting for many collaborators
The final example is from a project that began a few years before
it received CFRP funding. Many funding sources contributed
to the project, including the CFRP grant; private foundation
grants; in-kind salaries of a local YCC crew, school teachers,
federal agency personnel, and nonprofit organizations; and
donated
(unpaid)
hours
from
project
participants.
This
example also shows how monitoring plans may evolve over
time.
This monitoring team began by working with a local youth
crew and a middle school class to examine ecological effects of
restoration work, including:
w Changes in overstory canopy cover
w Changes in woody species density, basal area, and
composition

w Changes in understory canopy cover, including grass,

w Changes in riparian cover and species composition.
Later, a socioeconomic component was added to the project.
This involved mapping the distribution of grant funds in the
project area and monitoring forest restoration jobs created in
the community.
In the fourth year of the project, the team began monitoring
changes in medicinal plant composition.
Because of the large number of partners involved in this
monitoring effort, the budget is rather complex. The estimates
on the next page, in Table 5, are an attempt to replicate the true
costs of this monitoring effort.
The scope of this monitoring project was large, and there were
many costs. If monitoring expenses had come entirely from the
CFRP project, they would have been approximately ten percent
of the overall budget. However, because the monitoring project
drew from a wide range of sources, the overall cost from CFRP
funds was actually quite small, accounting for approximately
one percent of the total budget.

Potential funding sources to support CFRP
monitoring
There are two important reasons to consider seeking additional
sources to support your monitoring effort. First, as the above
examples show, there are many ways to expand your monitoring
budget by using CFRP funds in combination with other sources
of support. Second, for monitoring data to be meaningful, it is
often important to extend monitoring efforts well beyond current
CFRP grant cycles. Many scientists estimate that in order to
document real changes it is necessary to collect data periodically
over 10–20 years or more. Other sources of support thus become
even more important to sustaining a monitoring effort.
CFRP projects have relied on the following sources of funding to
supplement monitoring budgets:
w New Mexico Youth Conservation Corps (YCC)
w Federal funding from other, non-CFRP sources
w Charitable foundations
w Nonprofit organizations that provide training and
technical assistance
New Mexico Youth Conservation Corps_____________________________
Many YCC crews run each year throughout the state. Check to see if
there is an existing crew nearby that could participate in your project’s
monitoring efforts. If not, your group may decide it is worthwhile to
apply for a crew. YCC funding requires an extensive application
process. However, the program can provide funds to involve youth in
a wide range of forest restoration work, including monitoring.
Because the funds are from state revenues, YCC funds may also be
used as in-kind contributions to a project. YCC applications are
generally due at the beginning of August for the following summer.
Applications may be obtained off the YCC website, or by contacting
the agency directly at:

Federal funding__________________________________________________
The primary federal funding source is the USDA Forest Service.
The amount of federal funding available for your project will
depend on what your local forest district or national forest may be
able to contribute. Funding may come through the contribution
of vehicles, equipment, or personnel. Some districts have been
able to acquire cooperative agreements or National Fire Plan
funding to contribute additional money to a project. These funds
can be very limited, but it is worth exploring federal funding
options with agency project partners.
Charitable foundations___________________________________________
Finally, charitable foundations may be viable sources for
community-based monitoring projects. Relevant foundations will
vary based on the type of monitoring and who will be carrying out
the work. Foundations which have provided funding to small
community organizations for natural resources work in the past
include the following:

Glossary
Basal area: Basal area is the cross section at the root crown of
the tree, expressed as square feet per acre or square meters per
hectare. A measure of stand biomass.
Baseline data: Data collected at the beginning of a project on
the existing situation. These data provide a benchmark against
which change that occurs during the project period can be
assessed.
Canopy: The overstory comprised of the dominant and
co-dominant trees.
Canopy cover: The  percentage of a fixed area covered by tree
crowns, measured as the horizontal cover of the ground that the
canopy covers.
Composition: A list of all the species that grow in an area.
Cover: The amount of the ground that is shaded by living
plants, usually expressed as a  percentage. Also, the cover of the
ground by dead plants and plant parts, usually called litter cover,
also usually expressed as a  percentage.
Data: A set of observations collected through monitoring.
Information is derived from data through analysis.
DBH: Diameter at breast height.
Diameter at breast height: The diameter of a tree at breast
height (approximately 4.5 feet above the ground on the uphill
side of the tree).
Erosion: The movement of particles of soil across the surface of
the ground or into watercourses; usually caused by water, but
also by wind, gravity, and other factors.
Forb:  A broad-leafed green plant whose stems are not woody,
but not including grasses, sedges or rushes.

Goal: A general summary of the desired state that a project is
working to achieve. A good goal meets the criteria of being
visionary, relatively general, brief, and measurable.
Implement: To put a plan or agreement into action.
Indicator: A unit of information measured over time that
documents changes in a specific condition. A good indicator
meets the criteria of being measurable, precise, consistent, and
sensitive.
Monitoring: The periodic collection and evaluation of data
relative to stated project goals, objectives, and activities.
Implementation monitoring is important for multiparty monitoring
groups because it simply asks, ‘Did we do what we said we
would do?’ Effectiveness monitoring helps determine whether or
not the project goals were attained by asking the question ‘Did it
work?’ Reducing the small trees that compete with old-growth
ponderosa pine and increasing forage for deer are examples of
project goals that can be measured through effectiveness
monitoring. Validation monitoring involves checking the
assumptions upon which our restoration efforts are based. ‘Did
reducing crown cover actually reduce the threat of catastrophic
wildfire?’ is a validation monitoring question.
Monitoring plan: An outline for the steps you will undertake
to ensure that the project is on track.  It lists a project’s audience,
their information needs, the strategies that will be used for data
collection, the indicators, the methods that will be used to collect
data, and when, by whom, and where data will be collected.
Multiparty: Involving members from a variety of backgrounds
and perspectives.
Objective: A specific statement detailing the desired
accomplishments or outcomes of a project. If the project is well
conceptualized and well designed, realization of a project’s
objectives should lead to the fulfillment of the project’s goal.
Objectives are more specific than goals.

Participation: Active involvement in the design, management,
and monitoring of a project.
Resources: Items that a project needs, such as staff time,
managerial time, local knowledge, money, equipment, the
presence of trained people, and social and political opportunities.
Riparian plant species: Plant species that are found growing
along the edges of streams, rivers and other watercourses, often
including dry streambeds.
Sampling: Measuring a subset of individuals, households, trees
or other factors in a population like a community, forest,
watershed, or transect.
Stakeholder: Person who has vested interest in the natural
resources or who potentially will be affected by project activities.
Treatment: A management action intended to address a health
problem; often used synonymously with  prescription.
Unit: A single item or individual. For example, a community, a
household, a person, a garden plot, or a tree.
Variable: A particular characteristic of a unit that an observer is
interested in measuring.
