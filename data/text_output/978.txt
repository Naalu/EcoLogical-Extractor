ABSTRACT
Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens (D. Don) Endl.) responds
favorably to sprout clump thinning in clearcut environments,
but appropriate silvicultural techniques for this practice have
not been developed. Four power tools for this unique applica-
tion were evaluated: standard mid-sized chainsaw (long saw),
small arborist chainsaw (short saw), power hedge trimmer, and
a customized power brushcutter. Linear mixed effects model
analysis was conducted to determine tool differences in clump
processing speed, transit time, cycle time, and worker difficulty
(peak heart rate).Machine costs and unit production costs were
calculated separately for each tool,and perceived ease-of-use by
workers was noted. Clump difficulty (sprout clump size) was a
strong determinant of processing time and affected the perfor-
mance of each tool differently. The long saw performed well
across the range of clump difficulties but forced the highest
heart rates in operators and was the most costly. The short saw
was especially proficient on easy to moderate clumps, was
among the least difficult,and was the least costly; it was the clear
favorite for easy clumps. The hedge trimmer was among the
fastest and least difficult, but its capability was constrained by
sprout caliper. The brushcutter’s lackluster performance and
several inadequacies prevent its recommendation. Regardless
of tool selection, the condition of the sprout clump is a factor
that must be taken into consideration since it strongly affects
average production rates (clumps processed per productive
machine hour) and area costs. Sprout age and clump size
should guide tool selection, but should also be considered by
operators in selectively choosing a subset of crop stumps for
sprout clump thinning.

Introduction
The capacity of redwood (Sequoia sempervirens (D. Don)
Endl.) to regenerate vegetatively from epicormic basal sprouts
(stump sprouts) is a rare characteristic among conifer species of
major commercial importance. Like redwood, oak species
(Quercus spp.) of eastern North America sprout vigorously af-
ter cutting, and sprouts are actively managed in coppice-based
silvicultural strategies (Johnson 1975, Gardiner and Helmig
1997, Cook et al. 1998). There, the practice of thinning oak
sprout clumps at an early age has been deemed a valuable tool
for increasing volume growth in commercial oak forests
(Lamson 1988, Lowell et al. 1989, Groninger et. al. 1998), even
resulting in modelsof growth that are specific tothinned sprout
clumps (Johnson and Rogers 1984). To date, however, little at-
tention has been given to the operational potential of sprout
clump thinning on redwood timberlands.
Sprouting,as an alternative to sexual reproduction,provides
redwood with high levels of productivity, a competitive advan-
tage following disturbance, and the ability to survive a wide
range of disturbances (Douhovnikoff et al.2004).Often emerg-
ing from stumps within weeks of cutting (Olson et al. 1990),
and prolifically within 2 years (Barrette 1966), redwood stump
sprouts have long been depended upon to complement planted
seedlings and contribute to full stocking following harvest.His-
torically, establishment of redwood seedlings from seedfall in
clearcuts has been infrequent, whereas redwood sprouts have
established successfully under a wide variety of disturbance
conditions (Fritz 1951). One survey of 163 second-growth
stands revealed that stump sprouts comprised the majority of
stems in fully stocked stands following harvest and reforesta-
tion (Lindquist and Palley 1963).
Sprout clump thinning is a form of early competition con-
trol that is analogous to stand density management and is in-
tended to expedite the natural thinning process that sprout
clumps undergo as sprouts compete within clumps. In partial
cuttings, shade from overstory trees reduces sprout density and
growth (O’Hara et al.2007),and voids gains from sprout clump
thinning (Cole 1983), but in the full-light environment that is
typical of intensive forestry, all studies indicate that sprouts re-
spond favorably to early clump thinning (Barrette 1966, Boe
1974, Cole 1983). All sprout clump thinning studies were con-
ducted on clumps emerging from old-growth stumps, and
none on sprout clumps from the smaller and more vigorous

second-growth stumps that are now populating the region’s
third-growth forest.
In addition to growth enhancement, early thinning of
sprout clumps can be seen as a form of forest protection that
helps stands avoid or resist redwood’s primary damaging agen-
cies. Because redwood often sprouts prolifically, and with
sprouts originating from the root collar, side, and top of a par-
ent stump, early thinning of sprout clumps allows for selection
of future crop trees that have favorable stability properties
(Keyes and Matzka 2005). Foresters have routinely observed
mechanical instability in sprouts that do not develop an inde-
pendent root system and are prone to eventually “peeling off”
the parent stump. Thinning at a young age also avoids bear
damage common in older pre-commercially thinned redwood
stands. Young redwoods are routinely targeted for cambium
feeding by black bears (Ursus americanus) (Glover 1955, Olson
et al. 1990), and the occurrence of such feeding damage is often
intensified by local thinning activity (Russell et al. 2001).
Very little is known about the operational aspects of red-
wood sprout clump thinning despite its apparent potential
value. In other regions, the novelty of the practice has invited
the development of innovative silvicultural techniques. For ex-
ample, in Appalachian mixed oak forests, Groninger et al.
(1998) determined that selective herbicide stem spray and in-
jection treatments were cost-effective alternatives to chainsaw
thinning for 12-year-old oak sprout clumps, with comparable
(positive) effects on residual sprout diameter growth. Others
have focused on the sprout-generating harvest,assessing stump
height, cutface angle, cutting year, and timing of cutting as
means of reducing sprouts (Roth and Hepting 1943, Harring-
ton 1984, Ducrey and Turrel 1992, Tappeiner et al. 1996).
Knowledge of the costs and gains associated with alternative
sprout treatments (Dwyer et al.1993) is equally important yet is
rarely addressed. In the redwood region, only Boe (1974)
touched upon this subject with scant anecdotal information on
the labor costs for five tools – all manual, none motorized –
used to thin sprout clumps on old-growth stumps of 60 to 300
cm in diameter. That information is clearly outdated now.
Understanding the efficiency and accuracy of the tools capa-
ble of sprout clump thinning is important for guiding land
managers’ decisions regarding the thinning process. Since the
potential economic benefits from thinning redwood sprout
clumps at an early age remain unknown, any investment in the
practice of sprout clump thinning will seek to minimize costs as
much as possible. To address this need, this study was designed
to evaluate the efficiency and thinning capabilities of four tools
in a typical clearcut of 2-year-old redwood stump sprout
clumps.
Methods
Study Area
The study site is located in the Freshwater Creek watershed
of Humboldt County, California (N1/2 of SE1/4 of Section 27,
T5N, R1E, Humboldt base and meridian). At the time of the
study, the timberland lands were owned and operated by The
Pacific Lumber Company; the current owner is Humboldt Red-
wood Company. In nearby Eureka, California, mean annual
precipitation is 96.8 cm, varying in its seasonal distribution
from 0.41 cm in July to 16.1 cm in December, and daily mean
temperatures range from 8.8°C (December and January) to
14.8°C (August) (based on 1971 to 2000 monthly normals of
Station EKA, National Climatic Data Center ID No. 042910).
The site had been clearcut in 2005 and broadcast-burned in
2006 (Fig. 1). Slash depth at the time of the study varied from

several centimeters to more than 2 meters,but typically was ap-
proximately 60 cm deep. Stumps numbered approximately 247
to 296 per hectare with an average diameter of 83.1 cm (± 53.1
standard deviation [SD]) and height of 72.9 cm (± 47.0 SD).
More than 95 percent of stumps exhibited sprouting around 25
percent or more of the stump circumference. The mean sprout
density was 17 stems per clump but varied widely (± 19.7 SD).
Basal sprouts accounted for 77.6 percent of all stump sprouts,
the remainder emerging from the tops and sides of stumps.The
mean sprout height was 323.6 cm (± 70.1 SD).
In addition to redwood and tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus)
stump sprouts, vegetation included planted redwood seedlings
and evergreen huckleberry (Vaccinium ovatum), but stump
sprout clumps were free from external competition. A few
overstory trees had been retained in the clearcut but none of
these were in the vicinity of this study’s experimental units
(stumps).
Treatments and Data Collection
The attributes of four sprout thinning tools were quantified
based on timing and operator heart rate. All of the tools were
tested by two technicians on 2-year-old sprouts on a single uni-
form site. Tools included
• a small engine arborist’s chainsaw with a 35.5 cm bar
(Echo CS-341; 33.4cc engine; “short saw”),
• a typical mid-sized chainsaw with a 71 cm bar (Husqvarna
359; 59.0cc engine; “long saw”),
• a power hedge trimmer (Stihl HS-80; 25.4cc engine;
“hedge trimmer”), and
• a power string trimmer modified for this purpose into a
brushcutter with a shortened shaft and a rotary toothed
cutting blade (Husqvarna 324LDx; 25.0cc engine; “brush-
cutter”) (Fig. 2).
Each operator used each tool in a monitored trial of approxi-
mately 2 hours. A total of 157 sprout clumps were processed.
A timekeeper assigned to each operator recorded shift times
with a stopwatch and distinguished each cycle element
(clump-to-clump transit, clump processing) in addition to any
mechanical or personal breaks. Each equipment trial began
with an unmonitored clump thinning to warm up the operator.
The first cycle was initiated when the operator began his tra-
verse from the warm-up clump to the next nearby clump. Op-
erators were required to carry all tools, fuel, and bar oil during
operation.They worked simultaneously in different areas to re-
duce any potential influence of worker competition on perfor-
mance and speed.The operators worked with each tool at a typ-
ical working pace and did not interact with timekeepers except
to read and announce peak heart rate during operation. Time-
keepers also determined the distance and average percent slope
of each clump-to-clump traverse with the use of an Impulse
200 LR laser rangefinder and a Suunto clinometer.
Each clump’s processing time was calculated as the total
time necessary to thin the sprout clump down to the two largest
and vigorous-appearing basal sprouts. Any effort necessary to
clear stumps of thinning debris was included in processing
time. Treatment success was determined by timekeepers ob-
serving the condition of the two residual sprouts following
treatment. If both sprouts remained intact and undamaged af-
ter processing, the processing at that clump was considered
“successful.”Each tool was graded on overall success rate,with a
grade of Excellent for an overall success rate of 95 percent, Ac-
ceptable at 90 percent, and Unacceptable below 90 percent.
In addition to processing time, timekeepers recorded transit
time as the duration of the clump-to-clump traverse (inclusive

of any pre-processing brushing around clumps). Each clump’s
cycle time was calculated as the sum of its processing time and
antecedent transit time. Based on cycle time, production rate
was calculated as the number of clumps processed per produc-
tive machine hour (PMH). Timekeepers noted any personal
breaks taken by operators,as well as delays due to maintenance,
refueling, and mechanical adjustments.
To further explain variability in responses and help isolate
tool type as an explanatory factor, clump difficulty was visually
rated by labeling them “Easy,”“Moderate,”or “Hard”based on
the stump size and density of sprouts that comprised a clump.
“Easy” clumps included stumps ≤61 cm in diameter with less
than 100 percent sprout cover by stump circumference; “Mod-
erate” clumps included stumps ≤61 cm in diameter with 100
percent sprout cover; and “Hard” clumps consisted of any
stump with a diameter greater than 61 cm.
As an estimate of worker difficulty, peak heart rate during
clump processing was measured using a chest-mounted pulse
monitor with digital wristwatch-style recorder. Heart rate has
been used as a proxy for worker difficulty in a wide range of
studies measuring physical stress and intensity during athletic
training (Jeukendrup and Van Diemen 1998). In a workplace
example comparable to the present study, Sicking (1995) used
heart rate to test firefighter response to various tool types. Dif-
ferent vibration frequencies also play a role in heart rate, a con-
sideration given the variety of vibration levels of the tools used
in this study (Jiao et al. 2004).
Following the standard method described by Miyata (1980),
machine rate calculations were conducted to determine each
tool’s hourly cost in dollars ($USD) per PMH and per sched-
uled machine hour (SMH). The relatively short duration of the
study precludes any determination of a tool-specific utilization
rate, so a constant utilization rate of 80 percent was used for all
four tools. Production rates calculated from this study’s cycle
times enabled calculation of per-tool unit production costs in
dollars per treated clump. All machine cost input assumptions
and value assignments are provided in Table 1.
Statistical Analysis
There were four responses of primary interest. Transit time
was analyzed as a response to determine whether tool weight/
balance affected a worker’s clump-to-clump traverse. Process-
ing time described the efficiency of tools in thinning clumps.
Cycle time, calculated as the sum of each clump’s processing
time and its antecedent transit time, determined the overall
per-clump processing time per tool, and allowed calculation of
production rates. Peak heart rate (measured immediately fol-
lowing clump processing) was analyzed as a metric indicating a
tool’s ease-of-use.
Linear mixed effects model analysis (McLean et al. 1991) was
conducted as a hypothesis-testing instrument, with F-tests (α =
0.05) utilized to determine the significance of differences among
the four response (dependent) variables. Three factor (categori-
cal) variables (tool type, clump difficulty, operator) and two
covariate (continuous) variables (traverse distance, traverse
slope) were included in models as fixed effects.In order to deter-
mine whether there was any difference between tools for differ-
ent types of clumps, the (tool type) × (clump difficulty) interac-
tion term was also included. The statistical software package
NCSS (Hintze 2007) was used to conduct all of the mixed model
analyses. The Newton-Raphson method was used to solve re-
stricted maximum likelihood equations. Results are reported as
means followed by standard errors in parentheses.
Results
Attributes of the working conditions and work performed,
including aspects of the clump-to-clump traverse, are summa-
rized separately for each tool in Table 2. Transit time between
clumps averaged 74 (± 5.3) s but varied with a distribution that
was non-normal (Fig. 3). Slope did not affect transit time (p >
0.3392), but distance did (p < 0.0001), and the distribution of
traverse distances resembled transit time (Fig. 3). There were
substantial differences in the mean transit time between tools

significant even after accounting for operator,distance traveled,
and the slope of terrain traveled (p > 0.1376). The two opera-
tors moved at a similar pace and were distinguished by an aver-
age difference of just over 9 s per transit, an amount that was
not statistically significant (p > 0.4106). Tool hauling time ap-
peared to depend in part upon the quantity of slash and brush
the operators needed to traverse through,but this study did not
account for those factors.
Processing time averaged 207 (± 9.3) s per clump (Table 3).
Despite differences in the mean per-clump processing rates be-
tween tools (long saw fastest at 179 s; brushcutter slowest at 219
s), a high degree of clump-to-clump variability, even after ac-
counting for operator and clump difficulty, resulted in no sta-
tistically significant difference between them (p > 0.3226).
Clump difficulty proved to be a strong determinant of process-
ing time (p < 0.0001; Fig. 4). “Moderate” clumps averaged 186
(± 14.3) s per clump; “Easy”clumps required just 100 (± 16) s;
“Hard” clumps required 335 (± 17.3) s. For the two operators
involved in the study,processing speeds were comparable: their
mean difference was just 2.5 s, a difference that was negligible
and not statistically significant (p > 0.8964).
Operator success rates were generally high, with just three
cases of failure for the brushcutter and two for the hedge trim-
mer. But, the high proportion that they represented resulted in

a grade of Unacceptable for the brushcutter (87% success rate)
and Acceptable for the hedge trimmer (94% success rate). Both
chainsaws thinned all of the clumps successfully and were
graded Excellent on performance.The small number of failures
prevents statistical analysis, but failure seemed associated with
clump difficulty, as all but one of the failures occurred on
clumps rated as Hard.
As a composite response characterizing per-clump produc-
tion rates, cycle time was calculated as the sum of transit time
and processing time for each clump.The average cycle time was
281 s (Table 3), for a production rate of 12.8 clumps per PMH.
Distance and clump difficulty were significant factors in this
composite productivity response (p < 0.0011 and p < 0.0001,
respectively), as well as the tool × difficulty interaction term (p
< 0.0169). The latter indicated differences in cycle time among
tools depending upon clump difficulty.
Multiple comparison tests revealed the effect of clump diffi-
culty level on each tool’s performance, and differences among
tools for each level of difficulty (Table3).In comparing levels of
difficulty on tool performances, it was found that hard clumps
significantly slowed the brushcutter (p < 0.0003), long saw (p <
0.0013),and short saw (p < 0.0001) (Fig.5).For the hedge trim-
mer the hike in cycle time occurred even with the shift from
easy to moderate clump difficulty level (p < 0.0046). For easy
clumps, which averaged 177.3 s each, there were no differences
between tools (p > 0.1009). For moderate clumps, the hedge
trimmer (308.2 s) was more than 1.5 min slower than both the
short saw (208.9 s; p < 0.0436) and the long saw (216.7 s; p <
0.0306). But the promising efficiency of the short saw faltered
with hard clumps.For hard clumps,the short saw had the slow-
est mean time (495.5 s), significantly slower than the hedge
trimmer (361.5 s; p < 0.0181) and long saw (370.0 s; p <
0.0178). Overall, the brushcutter had the greatest mean cycle
time (307 s) but high variance (greatest of all tools; 23.1 s S.E.).
This high variance obscured any differences from the other
tools at any clump difficulty, but its mean cycle time was slow-
est or second-slowest at each clump difficulty level, further
eroding its appeal for this practice.
Peak heart rate averaged 145.4 beats per min (bpm) but var-
ied widely depending upon clump difficulty level and tool type
(Fig. 6), even after adjusting for operator (p < 0.0002) and the
slope of the antecedent traverse (p < 0.0205). Distance of the
traverse was not a significant factor (p > 0.1525).For all levels of
clump difficulty,the highest levels of stress were induced by the
long saw, which averaged 154.5 bpm (Table 3). This result cor-
roborated the impressions of the operators, both of whom re-
ported fatigue at the end of the long saw trial. The short saw
produced the lowest average heart rate overall (139.8 bpm),and
the lowest found in this study: 125.8 bpm for easy clumps. The
hedge trimmer produced the lowest heart rates for moderate
clumps (137.5 bpm) and hard clumps (143.3 bpm),though not
statistically different from the short saw for the former, and the
short saw and brushcutter for the latter.
Machine cost analysis (Table 4) revealed that the lowest
treatment costs were associated with the short saw and hedge
trimmer. Unit production costs for those tools ($1.70/clump
and $1.77/clump, respectively) were notably less (on average,
$0.31 less per treated clump) than the brushcutter ($2.01/
clump) and long saw ($2.08/clump). Comparing the two ex-

nificant (p < 0.0169), and differences were identified for
specific tool contrasts within each clump difficulty level. By its
strong influence on processing time, clump difficulty re-
mained a strong determinant of cycle time overall (p <

down occurred even at the moderate clump difficulty level.

similar to this study’s project area (247 to 296 per ha),operators
can anticipate that the corresponding per ha treatment cost
would be as little as approximately $169 to $203 for the short
saw and as great as $208 to $250 for the long saw.
Discussion
For all of the tools, the majority of total trial time was taken
up by clump processing followed by transit time. Thinning
sprouts was the primary activity assigned to the operators and
the tools were primarily dedicated to this focus during each
trial. Hence the primary focus in assessing tool properties is ap-
propriately aimed at the processing effort.
Operators were the most familiar with the long saw and
comfortable with its use. The long saw could easily cut through
all of the stem diameters and had a long reach, reducing the
amount of operator movement during thinning. It proved a
strong performer on difficult clumps in particular due to its
ease in reaching distant sprouts and in thinning quantities of
sprouts quickly.The long saw,however,caused the highest peak
heart rates during thinning. The long saw was the heaviest tool
used during this study, requiring more strength to lift and ma-
neuver around clumps, which could slow cycle times and in-
crease personal time over longer timeframes.Both operators re-
ported fatigue after the 2-hr-long saw trials were over.Although
not statistically significant due to high variance, the mean tran-
sit time was high and exceeded only by the brushcutter.
The short saw was the lightest tool to carry, and the design
was balanced to be operated at eye level,a cutting position used
frequently by the operators. Though the shorter bar on the ar-
borist chainsaw was an initial safety concern with regard to po-
tential kickback, operators in this study found the small saw
comfortable and convenient. It provided operators with greater
cutting precision due to its shorter bar length, and operators
found they could easily select and thin around desired residual
sprouts. This ease of use was reflected in the lowest heart rates
of all four tools (although oddly, the greatest range in heart
rates came with the short saw). Although its gas tank was
smaller than the long saw, its substantially lower fuel use rate
(the lowest of all four tools) indicates that refueling frequency
over longer timeframes is expected to be low.The saw’s size was
a drawback only on larger, more difficult clumps, which slowed
its speed considerably relative to the other tools.
During processing with the hedge trimmer, the operators
could assume comfortable standing and sitting positions that
were not possible with the other tools. The hedge trimmer of-
fered operators the greatest protection from injury with its inte-
grated guard that covers nearly three-quarters of the cutting
teeth. Hence, operators could sit on stumps being processed
and allow the hedge trimmer to cut through sprouts using the
weight of the tool.But the hedge trimmer worked best on small
clumps with sparse sprout coverage and was overwhelmed by
clumps with large and numerous sprouts. Operators reported
dissatisfaction with the extra effort necessary to make the tool
cut through larger sprouts. If a sprout caliper was too large, the
hedge trimmer could not cut through it and it had to be left on
the stump, constraining the operator’s ability to select desirable
residual sprouts. Operators felt that the hedge trimmer could
prove an efficient tool if restricted to younger, smaller 1-year-
old sprouts. In transit, the hedge trimmer was the safest tool to
walk with and demanded less care by operators during its
conveyance.
The brushcutter was the least familiar tool used during the
study: both blade type and angle were unfamiliar to operators.
It was the only tool with a four-stroke engine, making it more
fuel efficient, noticeably quieter during processing, and less
cumbersome during transit (fewer maintenance items). It also
produced less noxious fumes during operation, a valuable at-
tribute because tools in the study were frequently operated at
eye level and exhaust may be a problem for health over long pe-
riods of use. Blade jamming, however, was a problem with the
brushcutter as it was occasionally with the hedge trimmer.
Small sprouts and slash occasionally jammed the teeth, requir-
ing the operator to stop and remove the debris.The highest fre-
quency of residual sprout damage occurred with the brush-
cutter,primarily because the blade was difficult to angle for cer-
tain cuts and the blade had no brake to stop the saw between
cuts. The brushcutter had less power than the other tools and
sometimes required revving before cutting larger sprouts.
The exposed blade of the brushcutter had no brake,and dur-
ing processing operators had to wait for it to slow before safely
moving around the clump perimeter to treat other sprouts.The
operators felt it to be imbalanced and potentially dangerous, as
it tended to kick if the blade caught on a sprout. Care was re-
quired by the operators during transit with the brushcutter due
to its imbalance and exposed blade; the lack of a brake on the
blade resulted in operators waiting until the blade slowed be-
fore walking safely to the next clump.
The strong relationship of perceived sprout clump difficulty
to processing time warrants consideration in tool selection and
in clump selection during operations. Processing time, cycle
time,and worker heart rates for all of the tools were strongly in-

fluenced by clump difficulty (used here as an integrative indica-
tor of stump size and sprout density).More difficult clumps de-
layed the operator’s selection of desired residual sprouts, were
more cumbersome to walk around during processing, and re-
quired a longer period of active cutting. Operators often took
breaks after treating particularly difficult clumps.
This factor is worth considering in the context of opera-
tional efficiency, especially given the relatively low overall pro-
duction rate of 12.8 clumps per PMH. Stand-level treatment
costs could be cut by the treatment by the operators of a subset
of clumps representing crop trees. Given a choice among
clumps to select for thinning, and assuming equivalent capaci-
ties for treatment growth response, operators could favor the
selection of easy clumps,and thus enjoy measurably substantial
gains in efficiency at the stand level.For example,in the time re-
quired to thin 10 hard clumps,an operator could complete over
17 moderate clumps or nearly 24 easy clumps (those numbers
are inclusive of average transit times).
Favoring moderate and easy clumps for selection would also
enable the use of the arborist saw,which had several advantages
(including rapid processing and transit times), but which was
slowed considerably by difficult clumps. But, opportunities for
clump selection will be constrained by their density and spatial
distribution. It could also prove true that hard sprout clumps
are the manifestation of a more powerful root system that
would favor growth response to thinning. If that is the case,
losses in growth by selecting easy clumps would run counter to
any gains in thinning efficiency.These findings also suggest that
thinning younger sprouts would offer advantages in efficiency
(the difficulty of all clumps should be lesser) that would further
favor the arborist saw, as well as the hedge trimmer, which had
several favorable properties and which was a strong performer
on easy clumps.
It is an interesting finding of this study that the two tools
demonstrating the greatest overall appeal for this practice
(short saw and hedge trimmer) were also the lowest in cost.The
short saw in particular, with highest production rates for easy
and moderate clumps, lowest overall impact on worker heart
rates, and lowest production costs, offers the greatest promise
among these four tools for effective and efficient sprout clump
thinning on an operational basis.
Although not a subject of this study, observations with re-
gard to mechanical servicing needs were noted by the operators
and timekeepers. Operators noted that the Echo CS-341 arbor-
ist saw requires a non-normal wrench size to adjust the bar.The
hedgetrimmerfrequently hadtroublestarting.Thebrushcutter
appeared to require the least mechanical service time: its blade
teeth were designed to be sharpened by a common long file, it
has better gas efficiency than the other tools,and it has no chain
or other components requiring adjustment during operation.
Had this study not illustrated serious deficiencies in the brush-
cutter’s potential that eliminates its further consideration for
this type of work, detailed study of mechanical service time in a
study of longer duration would probably have been warranted.
The focus of this study was on the operation of sprout thin-
ning, and observed differences in tool performance and effi-
ciency were operationally significant. These differences, how-
ever, must also be considered in light of sprout clump thin-
ning’s effect on stand growth and yields for an adequate assess-
ment of the practice’s potential profitability. In oak stands of
Missouri,a present net worth assessment by Dwyer et al.(1993)
determined that sprout clump thinning,even when the practice
was constrained to as few as 247 crop trees per hectare,is not an
economical management practice for their local market condi-
tions. In redwoods, mitigating future problems associated with
dense third-growth sprout clump crops may be more
important than any growth enhancements (Keyes and Matzka
2005).
From previous studies conducted in second-growth, the
magnitude of the sprout clump thinning effect on residual stem
diameter growth (28.6%) and height growth (35.3%) in clear-
cuts appears substantial (Cole 1983).If maintained to maturity,
this realized gain could substantially reduce rotation length and
reimburse sprout clump thinning costs. A parallel long-term
study of third-growth redwood sprout growth in a clearcut lo-
cated nearby the present study site has been established with
treatments of no-thinning, thinning to 1 residual sprout, and
thinning to 2 residual sprouts. That study is expected to con-
sider the issue of profitability. Given the rapid rate of redwood
growth, any realized gains associated with sprout clump
thinning should soon be apparent.
Conclusions
This study provided useful insights into the practical opera-
tion of sprout clump thinning. Clump difficulty (stump size
and sprout density) was a strong determinant of processing
time,and affected the performance of each tool differently.The
long saw is a common tool used by thinning crews, and it per-
formed well across the range of clump difficulties, with high
processing speeds and success rates. But, it forced the highest
heart rates in operators at all three levels of clump difficulty,
and its unit production cost was the highest.Fatigue over a lon-
ger period of time could further erode the production rates of
the long saw. The arborist saw and hedge trimmer offered sev-
eral advantages that support their recommendation. Operators
felt both to be mechanically stable and safe, and both enabled
stable and comfortable working positions during processing.
The hedge trimmer was among the fastest and yielded low heart
rates in operators, but its capability was constrained by sprout
caliper. It has promise if sprouts are to be thinned at a younger
age, and its efficacy on 1-year-old sprouts is worth investigat-
ing. The arborist saw was especially proficient on easy to mod-
erate clumps, was accurate, was among the least difficult for
workers,and had the lowest production cost; it was the clear fa-
vorite for easy clumps. The brushcutter was not outstanding in
any regard,had the lowest success rate,and poses potential haz-
ards to operators.Given its many drawbacks and the worthiness
of alternative tools, the brushcutter is not recommended. Re-
gardless of tool selection, stump sprout condition is a factor
that must be considered, since average production rates

(clumps processed per PMH) ranged widely for clumps rated as
easy (20.3), moderate (14.8), and hard (8.6). Sprout age and
clump size should guide tool selection, but should also be
considered by operators in selectively choosing a subset of crop
stumps for sprout clump thinning.
