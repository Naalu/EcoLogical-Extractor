evegetating burned areas is a for-
midable challenge facing resource
managers in arid lands of the south-
western US. Southwestern deserts, such
as the Sonoran, are not generally
thought to have a history of frequent
burns. Multiple ignition sources com-
bined with increased fuel loads (often
resulting from invasion of exotic annu-
al grasses and increased density of non-
palatable 
shrubs),
however,
have
increased frequencies, sizes, and severi-
ties of wildfires (Schmid and Rogers
1988). Many long-lived native species in
these deserts are not considered fire
adapted (Brown and Minnich 1986).
Natural revegetation of desert burns by
native species may be slow or dominat-
ed by exotic annual grasses that perpet-
uate a frequent-fire regime (Cave and
Patten 1984). For example, Guo (2004)
found that species richness of native
perennial plants continued to increase
up to 60 y following protection from
disturbance in the Sonoran Desert. This
implies a long recovery time for these
native perennial communities.

Revegetating burns is a major challenge facing resource managers in the low- and
unpredictable-precipitation deserts of the southwestern US. We monitored the
effectiveness of using a diverse, 28-species seed mix for establishing native plants on
a 1.5-ha (3.7-ac) burn in the northern Sonoran Desert. Our objective was to com-
pare species performances, which we assessed by measuring species frequencies
and cover on 5 sampling dates to capture variation during a 32-mo period follow-
ing seeding. By 15 mo after seeding, desert senna (Senna covesii (Gray) Irwin &
Barneby [Fabaceae]) established best, with a frequency of 91% (based on 22, 10-
m2 plots) and a relative cover of 19%. Four other seeded species also became estab-
lished in   50% of plots by 32 mo after seeding. Several seeded species, including
desert senna (which flowered only 7 wk after seeding) and purple threeawn (Aristida
purpurea Nutt. [Poaceae]), were observed with seed heads during one or more sam-
pling periods. Although precipitation was only 67% of normal for 21 mo following
seeding and 71% of species established in < 10% of plots, we consider the seeding
to have met short-term management objectives because of the subset of highly suc-
cessful species. Our results also illustrate the caution that should be used when eval-
uating seeding success: conclusions would have differed if the diversity of the seed
mix had not included the successful species, and longer term monitoring was need-
ed to detect some species in the seed mix that did not establish until 32 mo after
seeding.

another example, Brown and Minnich
(1986) reported little to no recovery of
pre-burn native perennial communities
and 7 times greater exotic grass cover
than native perennial cover at 4 Sonoran
Desert sites 3 to 5 y after fire. Resource
managers may have several reasons for
actively revegetating burns with native
species: to provide competition with
exotic species, minimize soil erosion
and dust pollution, improve aesthetics,
forestall further land degradation such
as that caused by unauthorized off-road
driving, and increase native species
diversity (Roundy and Biedenbender
1995; Bean and others 2004).
Although not widely evaluated for
its effectiveness or value in revegetating
burns in southwestern deserts, seeding
has long been assessed for revegetating
other disturbed areas, such as aban-
doned farmland or depleted rangelands
(Cox and others 1982). Many past seed-
ing projects used cultivars or exotic
species, however, including relatively
recent examples of seeding the highly
flammable and invasive exotics known
as Mediterranean grass (Schismus bar-
batus) and red brome (Bromus rubens)
(Jackson and others 1991; Grantz and
others 1998) (see Table 1). The use of
native species has been limited by a lack
of available seeds and by findings that
native desert species are difficult to
establish (Judd and Judd 1976;
Bainbridge and Virginia 1990; Banerjee
and others 2006). Consequently, several
syntheses have discouraged seeding as a
revegetation option in southwestern
deserts (Cox and others 1982; Monsen
and others 2004; Bainbridge 2007). Yet,
seeding (for example, by aircraft) may
be one of only a few feasible options for
reintroducing propagules to large
desert burns covering thousands of
hectares in remote or rugged terrain.
Furthermore, many factors (other than
climate) that resource managers can
manipulate can influence the outcome
of seeding projects (Glendening 1942;
Jackson and others 1991). Species selec-
tion, seeding rate and timing, method
of seeding (for example, bare seed ver-
sus pelleting), site preparation, and
supporting treatments (such as, tilling,
mulching, and grazing protection) all
can 
influence 
seeding 
success
(Montalvo and others 2002). These
observations suggest that seeding has
the potential for meeting revegetation
objectives, given some combinations of
favorable factors, but these combina-
tions remain poorly understood.
Our study objective was to assess the
factor of native species selection by
monitoring the outcome of a 28-
species operational seeding on a north-
ern Sonoran Desert burn. We quantify
seeding success by measuring species-
specific frequencies using permanent
monitoring plots sampled 5 times to
capture intra- and inter-annual vari-
ability during 32 mo following seeding.
SITE AND BURN
DESCRIPTION 
This study occurred on a 1.5-ha (3.7-
ac) burn (UTM, NAD83: 408300 m E,
3741370 m N, zone 12, 595 m [1952 ft]
elevation) in the southeastern corner of
the 928-ha (2293-ac) Cave Creek
Regional Park,
managed by the
Maricopa County Parks and Recreation
Division. This park is 5 km (3.1 mi)
west of the town of Cave Creek and 15
km (9.3 mi) north of the city of
Phoenix suburbs. The study site lies
within the Arizona Upland subdivision
of the Sonoran Desert (Brown 1994),
which is characterized by a diverse veg-
etation structure including giant
saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea (Engelm.)
Britton & Rose [Cactaceae]), various
small trees (for example,
yellow
paloverde
[Parkinsonia
microphylla
Torr. (Fabaceae)]), cacti (for example,
Opuntia Mill. [Cactaceae] and Cylin-
dropuntia spp. [Cactaceae]), shrubs
(such as creosote bush [Larrea tridenta-
ta (DC.) Coville (Zygophyllaceae)]),
and annual and perennial herbaceous
plants. At the closest long-term weather
station, the Carefree station 8 km (5 mi)
east of the study site but 176 m (577 ft)
higher in elevation, precipitation has
averaged 33 cm/y (13 in/y) for the past
46 years (Western Regional Climate
Center, Reno, Nevada). Average tem-
peratures range from a July high tem-
perature of 39 °C (102 °F), to a January
low temperature of 5 °C (41 °F). Except
for the driest months of April to June,
which receive only 7% of the total
annual amount, precipitation is rela-
tively evenly distributed throughout the
year. Soils at the study site are mapped
in the Carefree series and classified as
fine, mixed, superactive, hyperthermic
Vertic Haplargids (Camp 1986).
The human-caused burn started on
private land on 1 June 2005, burned 1.5
ha (3.7 ac) of the park, and was con-
tained the same day it started. Weather
conditions at the time of the fire includ-
ed an air temperature of 40 °C (104 °F),
relative humidity of 8 to 10%, and > 30
km/h (18.6 m/h) wind speeds. As
observed by JL Gunn, flame heights
during the fire were 1 to 1.3 m (3.3 to
4.3 ft). Based on observations following
the fire, most shrubs were top-killed or
killed entirely, including creosote bush,
triangle bur ragweed (Ambrosia del-
toidea), and foothill paloverde (Parkin-
sonia L.) (Figure 1).
SEEDING PROCEDURES 
To assess feasibility of direct seeding
and to avoid impacts to soil and arche-
ological resources, no site preparation
was done before seeding. Seeding was
performed as a hydroseeding directly
on the burn surface on 31 July and 1
August 2005, about 60 d after the fire.
The hydroseed slurry, applied by truck
using a hose connected to a continu-
ously blending tank, consisted of seeds,
tackifier (ground Plantago spp.), and
fertilizer (112 kg/ha [100 lb/ac] of
16N:20P2O5:0K2O ammonium phos-
phate). A mulch was applied after seed-
ing, consisting of 3900 kg/ha (3470

lb/ac) of straw stabilized by a top coat of
560 kg/ha (500 lb/ac) of wood fiber and
168 kg/ha (150 lb/ac) of tackifier.
A total of 28 species (Table 1) were in
the seed mix, with each species seeded at
rates of 0.3 to 7.5 kg/ha (0.27 to 6.7
lb/ac) pure live seed (based on tetrazoli-
um tests). Species were chosen based on
4 main factors. First, all species were
native to the Arizona Upland subdivi-
sion, which we determined using pub-
lished floras and range maps (Shreve
1951; Kearney and Peebles 1960; Turner
and others 1995). Second, species were
chosen based on their occurrence at the
site prior to the fire, or on their histori-
cal presence at the site, which managers
suspected had declined in abundance
due to past land uses. For example,
managers included many of the peren-
nial grasses in the seed mix because
these species were thought to have
declined because of past grazing or
other ecological changes (Guo 2004).
Third, managers wished to include a
diverse array of plant lifeforms and
longevities (annuals and perennials) in
the seed mix. Fourth, the practical con-
straint of seed availability partly dictat-
ed composition of the seed mix. Seeds
were purchased from a variety of ven-
dors, and unfortunately the precise
genetic origin of
the seeds was
unknown. The seeding rates were cho-
sen for practical reasons to include the
greatest representation of species as pos-
sible within funding and availability
constraints. Samples of seed matter of
native species were analyzed for possible
exotic species content, with only a trace
amount (0.16% by weight) of buffel-
grass (Pennisetum ciliare (L.) Link
[Poaceae]) detected in one sample
(Arizona Department of Agriculture,
State Agricultural Laboratory, Phoenix,
Arizona, and Hulsey Seed Laboratory
Inc, Decatur, Georgia). Exotic seeds
were removed from the seed mix prior
to seeding.
MONITORING AND
ANALYSIS
To assess species establishment on the
seeded burn, we established two 100-m
(328-ft) long transects that started 15 m
(49 ft) inside the burn and were separat-
ed by 15 m (49 ft). At the beginning of
each transect and at 10-m (33-ft) inter-
vals, we established a 1.785-m circular
(10 m2) plot, resulting in a total of 11
plots per transect. In each plot, we
recorded live plant species rooted in
plots and visually categorized aerial
cover of each species using cover classes
(Peet and others 1998): 1 = trace (0.1%),
2 = 0.1 to 1%, 3 = 1 to 2%, 4 = 2 to 5%,
5 = 5 to 10%, 6 = 10 to 25%, 7 = 25 to
50%, 8 = 50 to 75%, 9 = 75 to 95%, and
10 = > 95%. Cover classes were used
only to rank-order species coverages by
computing relative percent cover, sum-
ming to 100% for all species including
both seeded and non-seeded volunteer
species. To measure seasonal and yearly
variation in species composition after
seeding, we conducted sampling during
a 32-mo period on 2 November 2005, 1
May 2006, 12 October 2006, 2 May 2007,
and 27 March 2008. On the first sam-
pling, some plants, especially grasses,
were in cotyledon or early seedling
stages, making accurate identification
difficult. We collected, pressed, and
identified unknown specimens to
species when possible, but sufficient
plant material was not available for
identifying 15 of the collected speci-
mens from the first sampling. Fewer
than 5 specimens could not be accurate-
ly identified on the other 4 sampling
dates. Unidentified specimens were not
included in the data set. We were also
not able to reliably differentiate the 2
seeded Penstemon
species,
so we
grouped these species for analysis. For
both seeded and non-seeded species, we
calculated percentage frequency based
on presence/absence in 22 plots. We
classified non-seeded species as native
or exotic following USDA NRCS (2007).
On each plot, we also visually catego-
rized mulch cover in 5% classes.
On the last monitoring date (27
March 2008), we also sampled five 10-
m2 plots in each of a burned, non-seed-
ed, and an unburned, non-seeded area
for comparison with the burned, seeded
plots. These areas were immediately
adjacent to the burned, seeded area, and
the area available for sampling limited
the number of plots to 5 spaced every 10
m (33 ft) along a 50-m (164-ft) long
transect. We sampled these plots using
the same methods as for the burned,
seeded plots. Because of the close prox-
imity of the seeded and non-seeded
burn areas, it is possible that seeds of
some seeded species were transported
between areas by way of wind, animals,
or other factors.
ASSESSMENT CONTEXT
As is often the case in studies of
unplanned wildfires, our study is limited
by a lack of quantitative pretreatment
data and the fire is not replicated (van
Mantgem and others 2001). Our results
apply only to the particular weather
conditions characterizing our study
period. In 21 mo following seeding, pre-
cipitation was only 67% of normal at
the long-term Carefree weather station,
and only 53% of normal if the unusual-
ly wet month of September 2006 is not
included (Figure 2). In addition, several
exceptionally 
severe 
dry 
periods
occurred, such as a 3-mo period
(December 2005 to February 2006)
beginning 4 mo after seeding, when only
0.025 cm (0.01 in) of precipitation fell.
This period normally receives 33% of
the total annual precipitation. A weather
station with shorter term records, but
only 3 km (1.9 mi) from the study site
and with a more comparable elevation
and weather pattern, registered even less
precipitation (Maricopa County Flood
Control District, Phoenix, Arizona).
This station recorded only 70% (29 cm

[11.4 in]) of the already below-average precipitation recorded
at the longer term station during 21 mo after seeding.
However, in months 22 through 32 after seeding and preced-
ing our last monitoring date, precipitation was 132% of the
long-term average.
SEEDED SPECIES ESTABLISHMENT 
Among the 28 species that were seeded, species exhibited sev-
eral different establishment patterns through time on the burn
(Table 1). Some species, such as several of the seeded grasses
including tanglehead (Heteropogon contortus) and curly-
mesquite (Hilaria belangeri), had emerged by the first fall sam-
pling 3 mo after seeding, yet did not result in established plants
at the time of the last sampling 32 mo after seeding. Other
species (for instance, creosote bush) were not observed or were
rarely observed in all 5 sampling periods, although it is possible
that seedlings emerged and died between monitoring dates. The
perennial Penstemon species (eatonii and parryi) typified an
episodic emergence pattern in which seedlings were recorded
the first spring after seeding, subsequently disappeared, were
recorded again during the second spring, then were absent dur-
ing the third spring.Another category of species, exemplified by
the perennial desert senna (Senna covesii) and the annual desert
bluebells (Phacelia crenulata), had established plants recorded
throughout the monitoring period.
Considering seeded plant groups (grasses, forbs, shrubs),
forbs established best by the end of the monitoring period
(Table 1). Only one grass (purple threeawn [Aristida pur-
purea]) exhibited substantial establishment by the end of the
study. Purple threeawn was among the most successful of all
species, however, because not only did it become established
on 27 to 50% of the plots on the last 2 sample dates but also
those plots contained fruiting individuals. Because most other
grass species germinated but did not produce mature plants,
apparently they are more establishment- than seed-limited at
this site (Turnbull and others 2000). There could be many
causes for this, such as herbivory, inhospitable soil conditions,
unfavorable post-seeding weather, or possibly genetic stock
poorly adapted to the site.
No seeded shrubs became established in more than 9% of
burned + seeded plots during any monitoring period.One of the
seeded shrubs not detected on any plots,creosote bush,is a dom-
inant species in North American warm deserts, but it reestab-
lishes slowly after disturbances and is considered a late-succes-
sional species (Brown and Minnich 1986). This species is
thought to germinate only sporadically and has exhibited mixed
success in seeding trials (Bean and others 2004; Banerjee and
others 2006). Creosote bush may not be well matched to our
site’s early successional conditions, although it also is possible

that the particular seeds used were not
suited to germinate at our site.
We judge desert senna to be the most
successful species, not just among forbs
but among all species (Table 1). In addi-
tion to occupying    59% of plots in all 5
sampling times, this species exhibited
the highest relative cover of any seeded
species, ranging from 19 to 64% among
monitoring dates. Furthermore, we
observed desert senna flowering just 7
wk after seeding and during each mon-
itoring period. By 21 mo after seeding,
this species had attained a density of
approximately 2000 plants/ha (810/ac).
Several other seeded forbs exhibited
establishment more episodic than
desert senna but were still successful
during multiple monitoring periods.
Except for one sampling date in which
no plants were detected, for example,
Gordon’s bladderpod (Lesquerella gor-
donii) occupied    59% of plots (Table
1). California poppy (Eschscholzia cali-
fornica) became established in    73% of
plots in 3 of 5 monitoring periods.
Coulter’s lupine (Lupinus sparsiflorus)
and Penstemon spp. occurred in 
27%
of plots in 2 sampling times. Under-

through seeding, exserted Indian paint-
brush (Castilleja exserta) was detected
on only one plot in only one sampling
time during the first 21 mo after seed-
ing. This species, however, occupied 21
of the 22 plots by 32 mo after seeding.
Presumably seeding allowed this species
to create a persistent seedbank that
awaited suitable emergence conditions
(Bowers and others 2004).
NON-SEEDED SPECIES
Non-seeded species composition on the
last monitoring date was generally simi-
lar on the seeded and non-seeded burn
area. Native annuals such as curvenut
combseed (Pectocarya recurvata) and
desert Indianwheat (Plantago ovata)
occurred at high frequencies in both
areas (Table 1). Exotic species occur-
rences were similar between the 2 areas.
Exotic species richness also was similar
between the seeded and non-seeded
burn but was proportionally lower on
the seeded burn due to its higher total
richness (Figure 3). Although exotics
were present on the seeded burn, the
suite of treatments (mulching, seeding,
and fertilization) did not increase fre-
quencies above those on the non-treated
burn. Nevertheless, a concern is whether
the abundance of Mediterranean grass
and red brome will increase, possibly
competing with native plants and accru-
ing fuel. By 32 mo after seeding,
Mediterranean grass attained a frequen-
cy on both burned areas similar to its
frequency on the surrounding non-
burned area.
MULCHING AND SEEDING
PROCEDURE
Mulching and hydroseeding were cho-
sen as the revegetation treatments for
this burn, and it would be useful for
future research to examine whether
these relatively intensive methods
improved establishment relative to less-
intensive methods, such as simply
broadcast seeding. Percentage of mulch
cover was not strongly correlated
(Pearson’s r2 < 0.11) with the total num-
ber of species occurring/plot in any of
the sampling periods. Mulch persisted at
2 to 50% cover among plots 21 mo after
seeding and still averaged 5% cover in
our plots 32 mo after seeding. Jackson
and others (1991) found that mulching
with 900 kg/ha (800 lb/ac) of straw
increased plant establishment after
seeding 3 to 4 times on abandoned
Sonoran Desert farmland. Similarly,
Glendening (1942) found that straw
mulching enhanced establishment of 10
seeded grasses in southern Arizona. It
also is possible that our seeding method
(hydroseeding) could have differentially
affected seeded species. For example,
Montalvo and others (2002) concluded
that small-seeded species established
better from hydroseeding than from
drill seeding, whereas the opposite was
true for large-seeded species. Drill seed-
ing was not an option in our study
because equipment running over the
site was considered undesirable.

COSTS AND OVERALL
SEEDING EFFECTIVENESS
By ascribing a monetary value to large
perennial plants (such as cacti and
shrubs) that were killed on park land by
the fire, an insurance settlement pro-
vided funding for the seeding in the
amount of US$ 9900/ha ($4000/ac).
Although only 7 (25%) of the 28 seeded
species became established in 25% or
more of plots by the end of the moni-
toring period, the site appeared well
vegetated and contained flowering indi-
viduals (see Figure 1). This aesthetic
component, and the avoidance of bar-
ren land that may encourage illegal
dumping or other abuses, is a positive
outcome of this seeding for park man-
agement. Ecologically, desert senna,
which has been cited to live for 10 y
(Bowers and others 2004), may have
initiated the establishment of a fertile-
island structure that is key for plant
regeneration and ecosystem function in
these desert systems (Carrillo-Garcia
and others 2000). Seeded species com-
prised 54% of total plant richness per
plot 21 mo after seeding and 29% of
richness after 32 mo even with elevated
richness of non-seeded annuals follow-
ing a moist period (Figure 3). This sug-
gests that the seeding treatment sub-
stantially boosted species richness rela-
tive to no management. Long-term suc-
cess of the seeding depends on the abil-
ity of seeded species to persist above-
ground or in the seedbank (Judd and
Judd 1976; Price and Reichman 1987),
or to facilitate the establishment of
other native species. One concern is
that the exotic annual Mediterranean
grass is the most prominent volunteer
(see Table 1), and it is unclear whether
competition from seeded plants has
affected, or will affect, its abundance.
Longer term monitoring is needed to
ascertain outcomes of interactions
between seeding and community suc-
cession on this burn. Future research
also could compare community func-
tional variables (for example, insect
community composition or small
mammal abundance) between seeded
and non-treated areas to assess possible
benefits of revegetation beyond the
plant community.
CONCLUSION
Many variables can affect seeding suc-
cess, such as species selection, genetic
stock and germinability, associated
treatments (such as mulching and weed
control), environmental site conditions,
timing of seeding, and precipitation.
For example, if we had not selected any
of the approximately 7 species that we
consider productive in this particular
seed mix, our conclusion about the
effectiveness of the entire seeding
would probably be different. Seeding
has typically been largely discouraged
as an option for revegetation of native
species in North American warm
deserts (Bainbridge 2007), but this area
of research needs further study. Our
data suggest that seeding native species
may have potential as a revegetation
tool in these deserts. Our viewpoint is
that in evaluating seeding as an option,
we need a better understanding of
which species are amenable to seeding
given current technology, which treat-
ments can promote success, and under
which environmental site conditions
particular combinations of seeding
components can be effective. This seed-
ing also could be viewed as only an ini-
tial intervention designed to align the
site on a desirable successional trajecto-
ry, and further treatments could build
on the productiveness of seeded species
that did establish.
