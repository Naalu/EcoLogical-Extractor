Financial Feasibility of a Log Sort Yard Handling
Small-Diameter Logs: A Preliminary Study
Han-Sup Han, E.M. (Ted) Bilek, John (Rusty) Dramm, Dan Loefﬂer, and Dave Calkin
The value and use of the trees removed in fuel reduction thinning and restoration treatments could be enhanced if the wood were effectively evaluated and
sorted for quality and highest value before delivery to the next manufacturing destination. This article summarizes a preliminary ﬁnancial feasibility analysis
of a log sort yard that would serve as a log market to buy and sell small-diameter logs in western Montana. We based our evaluations on equipment for a
medium-sized log sort yard that would preprocess and sort 33 million board feet of small-diameter logs per year to seven different products. The delivered
log input costs represent 78.1% of the total sales revenue, whereas the yard’s operating costs account for 17.7% of the revenue. The log sort yard’s operating
cost would be $3.74/piece or $79.53/thousand board feet. Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii) would make the biggest contribution to the yard’s gross margin
because this species both represents the largest volume (45% of the input log volume) into the yard and produces high-value products (house and veneer logs).
Improved knowledge regarding wood market conditions and local log supplies is a prerequisite to understanding a log sort yard’s ﬁnancial feasibility.

A
necdotal observations in the US West indicate that value
recovery of sawlogs resulting from stewardship contracts,
including forest restoration and fuel reduction thinning
treatments, as well as traditional timber sales, are limited for various
reasons, including small landing size and relatively small harvest
volume per treatment unit. Logs produced from those treatments
are often small (12 in. dbh) in diameter, with a minor component
of some large-diameter trees (12 in. dbh). It becomes impractical
or not economically viable to sort these materials at small landings
while trying to maximize operational efﬁciency in those treatments.
Small amounts of harvestable volume from each treatment unit
make it difﬁcult to justify intensive in woods sorting practices.
During the course of providing sort yard technical assistance, the
authors have found a general lack of understanding of the basic
principles of planning log sort yard projects. Deﬁciencies include
poor layout and design, selecting the wrong merchandising and
sorting equipment, inadequate consideration of the available log
resource, lack of market planning and feasibility, poor siting, poorly
developed ﬁnancial analysis, and lack of sound business planning.
Many of these deﬁciencies are rooted in (1) planning by subjective
opinions instead of informed decisionmaking, (2) using poorly
thought out assumptions, or (3) deﬁciencies in one or more of
several critical factors to log sort yard success.
The direct beneﬁts of log merchandising at a log sort yard have
been generally recognized, and interest in commercial log sort yards
has increased because of a decline in timber resource quality and
availability, diversiﬁed log and ﬁber markets, and the need to recover
more value from the available resources (Williston 1988, Dramm et
al. 2002). Log sort yards provide beneﬁts in (1) facilitating better
utilization and marketing of logs through optimization in sorting
logs for highest market values, (2) revitalizing forest-dependent rural
communities by offering a diversiﬁed and dependable supply of raw
material (Sunderman 2003), and (3) providing options for effective
marketing of underutilized small-diameter materials and woody
biomass from fuel reduction thinning operations and timber sales
(Dramm et al. 2002).
The value of the wood removed in fuel reduction thinning and
restoration treatments can be enhanced if the trees are efﬁciently
merchandised and logs are sorted for special products before delivery
to the next manufacturing destination. However, past studies indi-
cate that costs of operating a small-diameter log sort yard often
outweigh the revenue generated by sorting and preprocessing those
logs (Sedney 1992, Dramm et al. 2004, Sessions et al. 2005). Small-
diameter logs often yield lower product value and cost substantially
more to process on a per unit (volume) basis than large-diameter
logs. For example, it takes about four times as many 6-in. small-end
diameter logs to equal the same cubic volume found in 12-in. small-
end diameter log of the same length (Barbour 1999). Small soft-
wood logs also have relatively uniform log quality, leaving less op-
portunity to improve value recovery that may cover expenses
incurred in preprocessing and sorting these logs into different grades
(Dramm et al. 2002).
To make economically viable the running of a sort yard that
handles mostly small-diameter logs, every consideration should be
driven by the need to procure and process these logs at the lowest
possible per unit cost ($/green ton) while minimizing inventory and
overhead costs. More speciﬁcally, the economics of sort yards are
determined by several factors, including (Dramm et al. 2002) log
procurement costs, including stumpage, harvest, and haul costs;
processing and sorting costs; value recovery of log products sold; and
logyard inventory cost, overhead charges, depreciation, and business
taxes and fees.

ABSTRACT

Log procurement costs and value recovery of log products are
highly variable depending on local forest products industry condi-
tions and resource availability, whereas log sort yard operating costs
can be controlled by effective business and operations planning. The
business objectives of a log sort yard should be clearly identiﬁed, and
a preliminary evaluation of ﬁnancial feasibility should be under-
taken. A preliminary study lies somewhere between a “back of the
envelope” calculation and a full business plan. A full business plan of
running a log sort yard could be developed if the preliminary anal-
ysis of ﬁnancial feasibility indicates a favorable return (Safranski and
Kwon 1991, Howe and Bratkovich 2005).
The concept of a sort yard had been proposed in western Mon-
tana to (1) improve utilization of small logs from stewardship con-
tracts including fuel reduction thinning and restoration treatments,
(2) improve and expand local wood processing business by provid-
ing a steady supply of raw material, (3) process a mix of logs with
various quality and wood properties to desired speciﬁcations for
diverse wood processing ﬁrms, (4) provide inventory and sorting
services, and (5) contribute to value added by allocation of resources
to optimum end-uses.
With these objectives in mind, a team of US Forest Service and
university researchers was assembled to conduct a market analysis
for small-diameter log products and evaluate the potential costs and
beneﬁts of a merchandising and sorting system (log sort yard) in
conjunction with a series of treatment and stewardship contracting
scenarios on a landscape level in western Montana. As part of that
overall project, this article presents the results of the prefeasibility
ﬁnancial analysis of the theoretical sort yard operation using actual
empirical market and processing data. Given the uncertainties of
resource supply, forest products market volatility, and ﬁnancial vi-
ability of log sort yard operations, the speciﬁc objectives of this study
were to (1) evaluate the ﬁnancial prefeasibility of running a log sort
yard using the log sort yard cash ﬂow analysis (LSY) model (Bilek
2009), (2) assess key cost and revenue factors that critically affect
ﬁnancial prefeasibility, and (3) examine cost components in log sort
yard operations using empirical data.
Study Method
Supply of Logs and Sort Yard Product Output Values
For a log sort yard to be successful, the yard must have a steady
supply of logs with varying desirable characteristics (size, species,
grade, etc.) that are recognized in a marketplace. The size of the sort
yard is determined in part by the available log supply, number of log
sorts, log scaling method, and types of capital equipment that would
be needed to efﬁciently handle logs (Dramm et al. 2002). A parallel
study (Chung et al. 2010) has been conducted to evaluate how
improved value recovery through various log sorting strategies
would increase the residual value of forest health restoration treat-
ments to landowners relative to a traditional sort at landing. To
estimate the quantity of timber harvested from forest restoration
thinning treatments, Chung et al. (2010) developed restoration
thinning prescriptions speciﬁc to each forest type and simulated
each prescription using the Forest Vegetation Simulator (Dixon
2003) and US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis plot
data. We used the following summary of log supply information
from Chung et al.’s study:
•
Thirty-three million board feet/year, or about 29 truck
loads/day (4.5 thousand board feet [mbf]/truck load)
•
Operating 250 days/year to handle 664,063 tree-length logs per
year, or 2,656 pieces/day
•
Small-diameter logs: 65% of logs produced from trees with
dbh  9 in.

•

•
Redcedar (RC; Thuja plicata, 0.3%)
•

In this feasibility analysis, the log supply (Figure 1) was based on the
assumption that a whole tree harvesting method is used in fuel
reduction and restoration treatment operations to effectively reduce
fuel loading. Trees are felled and skidded to a landing, where they
are processed to 21⁄2-in. top diameter to produce logs up to 40 ft long
that could be hauled using standard stinger-steered logging trucks.
Log sorting at a landing is often limited during restoration thinning
operations in US Forest Service and nonindustrial privately owned
areas because of small volumes that are generated at small and nar-
row landings.
However, some presorting of material can be and frequently is
done at the landing to improve the overall economics of merchan-
dising and sorting. Presorting is typically limited to major sorts
(separating pulpwood from high-valued logs) to improve the overall
economics and efﬁciency of log merchandising and sorting. The
concept is to minimize expensive double handling of lower-valued
material (e.g., pulpwood). Pulpwood, including nonsawlog materi-
als (i.e., woody biomass for energy), would be marketed directly to a
pulp mill or energy plant from the landing, whereas all other logs
(sawlogs, veneer and peelers) are sent to a log sort yard for further
merchandising and sorting. Therefore, in our log supply analysis, we
further assume that there would be an initial presort with two piles
(pulpwood and sawlogs) of wood at landings.
A log sort yard would not be successful without diversiﬁed log
markets that require logs with different characteristics (size, length,
diameter, species, grade, etc.). We performed a market survey in
western Montana to understand the 2007 market value and demand
for raw materials of wood (e.g., sawlogs, veneer logs, and hog fuel).
The market analysis indicated that there are seven major products
that could potentially be produced and sold in western Montana
(Table 1). The delivered product output values shown in Table 1
represent revenues that could be realized after making allowances for
log hauling costs from the sort yard to each of the candidate markets.
The same survey also found that a typical average value of nonsorted
logs that were produced from restoration thinning operations in
western Montana in 2007 was around $300/mbf, and this was the
average log input value that is the price the sort yard pays for deliv-
ered logs. We used the following product speciﬁcations:

An Overview of Log Sort Yard Operation
Log sort yard design considerations and operations are highly
dependent on the volume and number of logs to be handled, sorting
and processing requirements, and inventory options. Based on the
log supply information, we concluded that a medium-sized dry sort
yard (unsurfaced, 40 ac), as described by Sinclair and Wellburn
(1984), would efﬁciently handle up to 250 mbf/day of log volume.
The basic functions of a log sort yard include receiving/scaling,
unloading, transport, grading, merchandising, sorting, reloading,
and log storage/inventory (Figure 2). Log sort yard equipment for
each function was selected on the basis of the equipment selection
guide from Dramm et al. (2002) and personal communications with
log sort yard operators and forest products professionals.
Receiving and Scaling
Tree-length logs arrive at a sort yard and are purchased on a
weight scale basis because 65% of logs are produced from the trees
with dbh less than 9 in. One out of every the 10th truck load may be
check scaled (load is spread out and stick scaled) to determine log
volume to weight relationships and log quality and diameter distri-
butions. A mixed load of small and large logs may also require more
effort in spreading, grading, and sorting of individual logs.
Unloading
One front-end loader (CAT 980-size) makes multiple passes
(three to six cycles) to unload a logging truck after weight scaling of
logs. It is necessary to bring the loaded truck into the middle of the
yard to minimize unloading time, and it would take a little over 10
minutes for a skilled operator to complete unloading (Sinclair and
Wellburn 1984). Another front-end loader (CAT 966) provides
assistance in unloading process, as well as handling other miscella-
neous tasks, such as cleaning the yard and transporting sorted logs to
storage decks.
Transporting and Spreading
The CAT 980 front-end loader picks up logs from the logging
truck (i.e., unloading) and transports the logs to grading/sorting
area. In case that logs are directly fed into a merchandiser, the
front-end loader transports the logs to the feeding deck area of the
merchandiser.
Grading
Short logs and mixed log loads (species, wide range of log diam-
eters) arriving in the yard may require sorting prior to merchandis-
ing. Grading logs (i.e., marking logs for sorting) is an essential step
to improve log values and effectively use logs for a particular use.
This begins by spreading out the logs to facilitate the grading process
and determine the best use of each log.
Merchandising (Bucking and Sorting Tree-Length Small-Diameter
Logs)
Small logs (12 in. in diameter) go through merchandising
(bucking and sorting) to be processed into six log products (sawlogs,
stud logs, veneer logs, house logs, post and pole, and pulp log). For
the purpose of our data analysis, we selected the Precision Sawmill
System, which can be programmed up to 10 different cut lengths,
based on the digital read of log length and diameter. Wood residues
and trim ends (smallwood chunks) are ground and sold as hog fuel
to the market.
Processing/Sorting (Merchandising Medium to Large Logs)
For somewhat larger diameter (12 in.) tree-length logs, a cut-
to-length (CTL) processor is used to merchandise (buck and sort)
the logs. After logs are ﬁrst spread and graded in the sorting bay, each
log is individually processed by the CTL processor to recover the
highest value of log products, which are the end sort categories. The
area required for sorting increases with the number of sorts (seven in
our study) and the volumes/pieces processed per shift (2,422
pieces/shift in our study). Using the graph that is used to estimate
the area required for sorting (Sinclair and Wellburn 1984), we esti-
mated that 10 ac would be needed to handle the sorting
requirements.
Decking/Reloading
Although log inventory should be kept to a minimum, some log
storage is necessary. Logs are decked in the yard to temporarily to
provide surge for unsorted logs and to accumulate enough sorted
logs for loads. This allows addressing the unbalanced tasks between
machines and improving safety in the yard, as well as providing a
steady supply of raw material to local wood processing business.

Both the CAT 980 front-end loader and CAT 325D log loader are
used to load trucks.
Grinding Wood Residues and Logyard Debris
We estimate that the volume of wood debris is, on average, 5% of
the log volume processed through the yard (Sinclair and Wellburn
1984). This includes log tops and wood chunks that result from log
merchandising or log breakage, as well as sawdust and bark. A me-
dium-size (475 hp) grinder (bought used) is used to convert this
wood debris into hog fuel, which is stored on a paved pad. Hog fuel
is sold to locally energy plants, sawmills, or other wood energy using
facilities.
Log Sort Yard Financial Analysis
The ﬁnancial analysis was performed using the LSY model (Bilek
2009). LSY is an integrated ﬁnancial model that provides 10-year
cash ﬂows and before- and after-tax net present values, internal rates
of return (IRR), and other ﬁnancial information. The model in-
cludes the following cost and revenue items: log input volumes and
costs; revenues from marketing various products; capital invest-
ments on equipment and tools; equipment operating costs, includ-
ing replacements; land purchase or leasing cost; construction costs;
deconstruction costs (if needed); labor (hourly workers and salary-
based administrative workers); and ﬁnancial costs (e.g., interest pay-
ments and working capital requirements).
The LSY model can also be effectively used for break-even and
sensitivity analysis to estimate maximum log procurement costs that
maintain a desired return on investment. We performed our ﬁnan-
cial analyses on the basis of a 10-year project period because many
machines used in a log sort yard need to be replaced or refurbished
within 10 years. Furthermore, the forest products business sensi-
tively responses to market conditions, and a ﬁnancial analysis of a
log sort yard over an extended period (10 years) would not be
informational. We used a weighted average nominal before-tax dis-
count rate of 11.6% to calculate before-tax present values. Taxes
were estimated on the basis of a combined state and federal income
tax rate of 39.7%. Labor costs include charges for 12 hourly wage
employees and the four salaried employees. The estimated costs for
equipment used in a log sort yard handling small-diameter logs are
summarized in Table 2.
Results and Discussion
Financial Feasibility of Running a Log Sort Yard
Based on the log input and commercial equipment data supplied,
the ﬁnancial feasibility of a log sort yard processing a mix of mostly
small-diameter logs in western Montana looks promising (Table 3).
The project’s internal rate of return was 24.3% after accounting for
inﬂation and income taxes from the log sort yard business given our
assumptions. The present value of additional after-tax proﬁts was
about $2.38 million. Of greater concern, however, was the sensitiv-
ity of the ﬁnancial feasibility of running a log sort yard to changes in
operational factors, including costs, revenues, and log supply. A way
of measuring the importance of costs in a business enterprise is to
divide them by sales revenue. The larger the percentage of costs in
relation to total sales revenues, the more sensitive net proﬁts (or
losses) will be to changes in those costs.
The delivered log input cost ($300/mbf) represents 78.1% of the
total sales revenues that would be earned by the proposed sort yard

direct production cost, ﬁxed costs and overhead, and working capital (Table 4).

over a 10-year period (Figure 3 and Table 4). The percentage of
delivered log input costs to the total cost is quite sensitive to the price
change for the logs being delivered to the log sort yard. This explains
why the real after-tax IRR would sharply decrease with increases of
the average delivered log input costs, shown in Figure 4, and rein-
forces the importance of procuring logs at the lowest possible per
unit cost. The maximum break-even log input cost, which is the
average cost at which the owners receive exactly their desired rate of
return, would be $314.53/mbf in year 0.
The second largest cost factor would be the sort yard operating
cost ($79.53/mbf or $3.74/piece), which would represent 17.7% of
the total sales revenue (Figure 3 and Table 4). Within the operating
cost, the direct production costs ($41.75/mbf), including wages for
hourly employees and machine operating cost, share the largest
component (10.2% of the total sales revenues), followed by the
capital investment ($15.28/mbf) in major equipment (3.8% of the
total). The operating cost could be controlled and minimized
through well-designed project planning and efﬁcient operations.
For example, a used grinder ($150,000) would not be necessary if
the residues generated from wood processing were contracted to a
local ﬁrm, and this might lower the operating cost.
The real after-tax IRR would also be quite sensitive to the
changes of revenues that the log sort yard would earn from selling
output products (Figure 5). For example, the real after-tax IRR
would decrease to negative 3.4% or increase to 48.1% if the revenue
dropped or increased by 5%, respectively. We also found from the
breakeven analysis that the log sort yard as conﬁgured should annu-
ally process at least 22,709 mbf of logs to earn the minimum after-
tax required rate of return on investments. This would also mean
that the yard must operate at 68% of its full-time capacity, or 170
shifts per year. These results indicate that accurate information re-
garding wood market conditions and local log supplies is a prereq-
uisite to understanding the true ﬁnancial viability of a log sort yard.
Over the 10-year project planning period, annual cash ﬂows were
projected to be positive from the second year of the project, except in
year 6 (2013), when a major expense would be incurred to replace
the equipment that has a 5-year economic life (Figure 6). This
would be a critical time to do a major reassessment of the yard’s
ongoing ﬁnancial feasibility. Another critical time would be in year
8 (2015) when equipment with an estimated 7-year economic life is
scheduled for replacement (Figure 6).
Product Value Recovery at the Log Sort Yard
Gross margin is the difference between the sales revenues re-
ceived for the log products and the delivered log input costs. It
represents what is left over to cover all other costs, including variable
processing, capital, administration, ﬁnancing, etc. The log sort yard
would make its largest margins by handling Douglas-ﬁr (Figure 7
and Table 5). This species accounts for 45% of the total volume and
produces high-value products, such as stud, house logs, and veneer
logs. In contrast, subalpine ﬁr and grand ﬁr would have negative
gross margins, at an input cost of $300/mbf. This means that the
yard would be losing money by processing these latter species.

Veneer logs and sawlogs provide the highest values and make the
largest contribution to gross margin (Figure 8). Post and poles also
generate a positive contribution to the gross margin. Pulp log and
hog fuel would cause large losses if these were the primary products
for logs delivered to the yard. That is the reason that these products
should be presorted and delivered directly to market from the forest
landing. These low-valued products are inevitably produced as a
result of the yard’s merchandising process, but their production
should be minimized.
Looking at the products by their contributions to unit gross
margin, house logs look even more proﬁtable than veneer logs (Ta-
ble 6). However, house logs would make up only 0.2% of the yard’s
total volume output. If the yard could produce more house logs, or
if the yard could develop more markets for house logs if market
demand is the limiting factor, then this would represent a possible
opportunity for the yard to improve its overall proﬁtability. Looking
at these products’ contributions in another way, if these higher-val-
ued logs were removed in a presort from the sort yard’s log input
mix, then the yard’s ﬁnancial viability would be threatened.
The success of any log sort yard greatly depends on the ability of
the yard to either ﬁll a marketplace function that is not currently
being ﬁlled, or perform a function more efﬁciently than the systems

currently in place. Logs are probably being sorted somewhere in
western Montana already, either on log landings or perhaps in mill
yards. If these are inefﬁcient operations or if there is waste in these
operations (e.g., by using higher-grade logs for lower-grade uses),
then there may be an opportunity for a specialized log sort yard to
perform this function more economically and provide a more efﬁ-
cient market for logs. In such circumstances, a logyard would be able
to pay a bit more for logs or sell them for a bit less than current
market conditions dictate and make up its margin by having tighter
product speciﬁcations and lower-cost sorting. However, the yard’s
manager must always be aware of what the alternative markets are
and also be aware of what the alternative systems are to keep the log
supplies coming and thereby to ﬁll a market need.
This preliminary analysis of ﬁnancial feasibility should be further
reﬁned and updated with the objective of developing ﬁnancial anal-
ysis for a full business plan before any investment takes place. Inves-
tors would need assurance that log supplies from federal lands will be
there through stewardship contracts in place and that projects have
cleared the National Environmental Protection Act (National En-
vironmental Policy Act of 1969) standards. Prices should be up-
dated to account for the recent downturn in wood markets. The
yard’s location should be reﬁned so that transportation costs can be
more accurately estimated. Location on a rail head would further
change the location economics, although these factors could easily
be incorporated into the planning model. If a yard were located near
an urban area, there may be opportunities to accept urban logs for a
tipping fee. Such factors can also be incorporated into the planning
model.
Conclusion
The ﬁnancial feasibility of a log sort yard that processes primarily
small-diameter logs largely depends on prices that the yard needs to
pay and product revenues that the yard would receive from selling
product outputs. Under most scenarios, delivered log input prices
represent two-thirds to three-quarters or more of the total log sort
yard cost, and it is critical for a log sort yard to procure logs at a
minimum cost to be successful. The operating cost of a log sort yard
represented 17.7% of the total cost, including the direct production
cost (10.2% of the total cost) and capital investment on major
equipment (3.8% of the total). The projected log sort yard operating
costs of $3.74/piece or $79.53/mbf indicate the magnitude of value
that must be added by the sort yard operation in order for it to be
ﬁnancially viable. A well-designed log sort conﬁguration that effec-
tively reﬂects delivered log input supply and product market condi-
tions not only allows efﬁcient sort yard operations but also reduces
requirements for initial capital investments.
The direct beneﬁts of log merchandising at a sort yard could be
accomplished by maximizing revenues that cover all the log sort yard
costs and generate proﬁts as a result of the sort yard operation.
Species and product types are important factors determining gross
revenues. Douglas-ﬁr, accounting for 45% of the total volume, gen-
erates the largest margins by sorting and merchandising those logs in

a log sort yard. Subalpine ﬁr and grand ﬁr have negative gross mar-
gins at an input cost of $300/mbf. Sawlogs made the highest con-
tribution to the total gross margin (42%), followed by veneer logs
(40%) and post and pole (14%). House logs generated the highest
individual product proﬁt margin, but the total volume of house logs
represented only 0.2% (or 3% of the gross margin).
It would be critical for management to closely monitor log costs
as well as gross margins on both log species groups and products to
ensure that the yard adds value and not just cost to the logs that it
processes. It should be further noted that the success of any log sort
yard would be highly dependent on the ability of the yard to ﬁll a
function of improving value recovery and utilization that is not
being realized in the marketplace. A sustainable supply of logs to a
sort yard for extended years is not part of this study, but it remains
as an important question that is difﬁcult to answer.
