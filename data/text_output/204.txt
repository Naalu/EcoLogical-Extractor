Abstract. Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) is widely distributed in the Southwestern 
United States, where it frequently occurs in association with ponderosa pine (Pinus pon- 
derosa). Fire suppression and fuelwood harvest likely have reduced oak abundance within 
the pine-oak type. Gambel oak occurs in multiple age-related growth forms, from small 
shrubs to large, old trees, and may provide important foraging and nesting habitat for breed- 
ing birds. I compared attributes of breeding bird communities in 16 northern Arizona pon- 
derosa pine stands from 1993-1995, that were structurally similar except for the presence 
or absence of Gambel oak. Overlap in bird species composition was high; pine and pine- 
oak stands had a mean Jaccard similarity value of 0.67. Five species were unique to pine 
stands, whereas 10 species were largely restricted to or only found in pine-oak stands. 
Overall bird diversity was significantly higher in pine-oak stands, which also had more 
species of Neotropical migrants, ground nesters, primary cavity excavators, and secondary 
cavity users than did pine stands. Pine and pine-oak stands had similar species evenness 
and similar rates of annual species turnover. Total bird abundance did not differ between 
cover types; however, primary cavity excavators were more abundant in pine-oak stands. 
Because of the apparent positive influence of oak on breeding birds, forest managers are 
encouraged to use treatments that retain and enhance the various growth forms of Gambel 
oak found in pine-oak stands.

INTRODUCTION 
Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) is widely dis- 
tributed in lower transition zone vegetation types 
of Southwestern North America, primarily in 
Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico 
(Harper et al. 1985). At elevations of 2,000- 
2,800 m, Gambel oak frequently is associated 
with ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) (Hanks 
et al. 1983). In central and northern Arizona, 
pure ponderosa pine stands have relatively sim- 
ple physiognomy, consisting of various-aged 
ponderosa pine trees and an open herbaceous 
understory (Hanks et al. 1983). Where Gambel 
oak is present, it dramatically changes the struc- 
ture of the stand. Gambel oak occurs in multiple 
age-related growth forms, including shrub-like 
young plants, saplings, and trees up to 90 cm in 
diameter. In some pine-oak stands, Gambel oak 
may comprise up to 30% of total tree basal area 
(Reynolds et al. 1970). 
For many years, Gambel oak was considered 
a “pest” species and considerable effort was de- 
voted to oak control (Engle et al. 1983, Lauver 
’ Received 27 October 1997. Accepted 14 April 
1998. 
et al. 1989). Because of its high heat content and 
availability 
near human population centers, 
Gambel oak is a popular source of fuelwood 
(Wagstaff 1984). However, Reynolds et al. 
(1970) suggested that timber harvest and other 
management practices could negatively impact 
wildlife associated with pine-oak stands. Re- 
cently, the management of Gambel oak in 
Southwestern forests has become an important 
issue. Loss of oaks, particularly large, old trees, 
may have negative impacts on passerine birds, 
raptors, and other wildlife (U.S. Fish and Wild- 
life Service 1995, Block and Finch 1997). Fire 
suppression has dramatically increased the den- 
sity of Southwestern ponderosa pine stands 
(Harrington and Sackett 1992, Covington and 
Moore 1994), which also may have contributed 
to oak declines in the pine-oak type (Moir et al. 
1997). 
Birds have evolved a high degree of habitat 
selectivity, using habitat features that increase 
survival and reproductive output (Cody 1985). 
An important consequence of this selectivity is 
the strong influence of habitat composition and 
physiognomy on avian populations and com- 
munities (Robinson and Holmes 1984, Wiens

1989). Studies in other North American forests 
have found that the presence and physiognomy 
of deciduous trees in a conifer stand affect 
breeding bird abundance and community com- 
position (Morrison and Meslow 1984, Dickson 
et al. 1995). Brawn and Balda (1988b) and 
O’Brien 
(1990) suggested that Gambel oak 
might similarly influence breeding bird com- 
munities in ponderosa pine forests of northern 
Arizona. 
This study was initiated in 1993 as part of a 
larger project examining habitat relationships of 
breeding passerine birds in ponderosa pine for- 
ests of northern Arizona (Rosenstock 1996). My 
objective in the present study was to quantify 
the influence of Gambel oak on breeding bird 
communities. I predicted that the presence of 
Gambel oak would alter the composition of the 
breeding avifauna, and that it also would in- 
crease avian abundance and diversity. My null 
hypothesis was that there were no significant 
differences in bird community variables between 
ponderosa pine stands that were structurally sim- 
ilar except for the presence or absence of Gam- 
be1 oak. 
METHODS 
STUDY AREA 
Research was conducted on the Coconino Na- 
tional Forest and Camp Navajo, 
an Arizona 
Army National Guard facility. Both study areas 
were within a 60-km radius of Flagstaff, Ari- 
zona. The study areas have a long history of 
commercial sawtimber harvest, beginning in the 
late 1800s (Scurlock and Finch 1997). Common 
silvicultural treatments have included single-tree 
selection, shelterwood, group selection, patch 
cuts, and pre-commercial thinning (Schubert 
1974). Non-sawtimber products (pulp, fuel- 
wood, poles, and Christmas trees) have com- 
prised a large proportion of wood fiber harvest 
in recent years (Raish et al. 1997). Wildfires on 
the study areas have been actively suppressed 
since the late 1800s. Prescribed fire was used in 
some areas, primarily for removal of woody de- 
bris resulting from timber harvest and thinning 
activities. The study areas have been grazed in 
summer by domestic livestock (primarily cattle) 
since the 1800s. 
Data were collected from 1993-1995 in 16 
stands representing two naturally occurring for- 
est cover types: ponderosa pine and ponderosa 
pine-Gambel oak. Both cover types had an her- 
baceous understory dominated by grasses, pri- 
marily Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica) or 
blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis). Eight stands 
were located within the pine cover type, and 
eight were in the pine-oak type. Stands were de- 
fined as contiguous areas of structurally similar 
forest 2 20 ha in size. Study stands in both cov- 
er types occurred on similar aspects and topo- 
graphic positions, and on sites of comparable 
growth potential (site index). The two groups of 
stands were not significantly different with re- 
spect to the density of ponderosa pine, pine can- 
opy cover, pine diameter, pine basal area, and 
density of snags (Table 1). These habitat vari- 
ables were correlated with many breeding bird 
community attributes across a larger set of study 
stands (Rosenstock 1996). Stands in the pine-

oak cover type had a well-developed Gambel 
oak component that included shrub-like and tree 
growth forms (Table 2). Gambel oak was absent 
from all stands in the pine cover type. To min- 
imize potential confounding by recent habitat 
disturbance, I selected study stands that had no 
fire, commercial sawtimber harvest, or other sil- 
vicultural activity for 2 5 years prior to, and 
throughout the duration of the study. 
AVIAN SAMPLING 
Within each stand, I established eight bird sam- 
pling stations originating at a random location. 
This sample size yielded 
stable estimates of 
abundance and diversity in other western mon- 
tane forests, including ponderosa pine (Morrison 
et al. 1981). Stations were spaced 200 m apart 
along two parallel transect lines, also spaced 200 
m apart. Breeding birds were sampled using 
100-m radius point counts (Ralph et al. 1995). 
Observers counted all birds seen or heard, and 
estimated their distance to the nearest 5 m, using 
marked trees at known distances as a reference. 
Each stand was visited three times during the 
peak breeding season (June l-July lo), once by 
each of three observers. Counts were 8 min long 
and conducted within the 3-l-n period beginning 
30 min after sunrise. Counts were not done dur- 
ing periods of wind (> 15 km hr ‘) or rain, that 
could alter avian activity or detectability. To re- 
duce interobserver variability, field personnel re- 
ceived extensive training in bird identification 
and point count methodology (Kepler and Scott 
1981). 
For many species, frequency distributions of 
observation distances violated assumptions of 
commonly used density estimators (Buckland et 
al. 1993). Therefore, I used total counts (Vemer 
and Ritter 1985, Raphael 1987) to derive an in- 
dex of avian density. To minimize repeat counts 
of individual birds from adjacent stations, I re- 
moved all detections beyond 75 m from the data 
set. “Flyover” observations and birds identified 
as juveniles also were excluded from analysis. 
Density index values were calculated as the 
mean number of individuals observed in each 
stand across the three annual census visits, di- 
vided by the total area sampled. 
DATA ANALYSIS 
Similarity in bird species composition between 
stands in pine and pine-oak cover types was 
measured with Jaccard’s Index (J) (Ludwig and 
Reynolds 1988). Total density was calculated as 
summed density index values for all species 
present within a stand. Metrics describing diver- 
sity, evenness, and species turnover were used 
to quantify community structure. I used Hill’s 
diversity number Nl as a measure of species di- 
versity. Nl represents the number of “abun- 
dant” species in a given sample, and is more 
directly interpretable than dimensionless diver- 
sity indices (Ludwig and Reynolds 1988). The 
modified Hill’s ratio E5 was used as a measure 
of evenness among species’ relative abundances. 
E5 approaches zero as a single species becomes 
numerically dominant, and unlike other com- 
monly-used evenness indices, is relatively insen- 
sitive to differences in species richness (Ludwig 
and Reynolds 1988). Percent annual turnover in 
overall species composition was calculated fol- 
lowing Diamond (1969). 
I divided breeding avifauna into two classes 
based upon migration patterns. Classes were: (1) 
species that occur year-round in the study area 
or migrate short distances to wintering habitats 
within the continental U.S. (hereafter referred to 
as residents), and (2) species that migrate into 
Mexico and Central America (Neotropical mi- 
grants). I also classified the breeding avifauna 
with respect to nest location (ground, foliage, or 
tree cavity). Cavity nesters were further divided 
into species that excavate their own nest cavities 
(cavity excavators) and species that use previ- 
ously excavated cavities (secondary cavity 
users). Finally, I examined the subset of breed- 
ing species that forage primarily by gleaning in- 
sects from tree and shrub foliage (foliage glean- 
ers). Guild assignments were based upon Szaro 
and Balda (1979), Ehrlich et al. (1988), Corman 
(1996), and observational data collected during 
this study. 
I used repeated measures analysis of variance 
(Neter et al. 1990) to compare bird assemblage

variables between pine and pine-oak cover 
types, using stands as replicates, cover type as 
the main effect, and year as the repeated mea- 
sures factor. Interactions were tested with the 
multivariate Wilk’s Lambda statistic. Main ef- 
fects and interactions were considered signifi- 
cant at P 5 0.05. 
RESULTS 
SPECIES COMPOSITION 
I observed 42 breeding bird species during point 
counts (Table 3); of these, 25 were resident spe- 
cies and 17 were Neotropical migrants. Seven 
species were ground nesters, 20 were foliage 
nesters, 5 were cavity excavators, 9 were sec- 
ondary cavity users, and 1 parasitized ground 
and foliage nests of other species (Table 3). 
A total of 36 breeding bird species was found 
in the pine cover type, and 37 species in pine- 
oak. Overlap in species composition between 
cover types was high, mean (2 SE) similarity 
between pine and pine-oak stands was J = 0.67 
? 0.01. Nineteen species were present in nearly 
all stands in both cover types (Broad-tailed 
Hummingbird, Northern Flicker, Hairy Wood- 
pecker, Western Wood-pewee, Violet-green 
Swallow, Steller’s Jay, Mountain Chickadee, 
White-breasted Nuthatch, Pygmy Nuthatch, 
Western Bluebird, American Robin, Plumbeous 
Vireo, Yellow-rumped Warbler, Grace’s Warbler, 
Dark-eyed 
Junco, Brown-headed Cowbird, 
Western Tanager, Pine Siskin, and Red Crossbill 
[scientific names are given in Table 31). 
Pine-oak stands had more distinct species 
composition than did pine stands. Ten species 
occurred more frequently in, or were restricted 
to, pine-oak stands (Acorn Woodpecker, Downy 
Woodpecker, Cordilleran 
Flycatcher, House 
Wren, Rock Wren, Ruby-crowned Ringlet, War- 
bling Vireo, Virginia’s Warbler, Red-faced War- 
bler, and Black-headed Grosbeak). In contrast, 
five species (Williamson’s Sapsucker, Clark’s 
Nutcracker, Red-breasted Nuthatch, Hepatic 
Tanager, and Cassin’s Finch) were detected only 
in pine stands (Table 3). 
DIVERSITY 
Breeding bird diversity was higher (F, ,4 = 16.7, 
P < 0.001) in pine-oak compared to pine stands 
(Table 4). Pine-oak stands also had more species 
of Neotropical migrants (F,,,, = 12.1, P < O.Ol), 
ground nesters (F,,,, = 5.4, P < O.OS), cavity 
excavators (F,,,, = 4.5, P < O.OS), and second- 
ary cavity users (F,,,4 = 9.0, P < 0.01) than did 
pine stands. Species richness of residents varied 
among years (F2,28 = 12.1, P < 0.01). Species 
richness did not differ between cover types for 
resident species (F,,,, = 2.5, P > 0.05), foliage 
gleaners (F,,,, 
= 3.8, P > O.OS), and foliage 
nesters (F,,,, = 1.5). Pine and pine-oak stands 
also were not significantly different with respect 
to evenness (F,,,, 
= 0.6) and annual species 
turnover (F,,,, = 0.1). All year x cover type in- 
teractions for the above response variables were 
nonsignificant (P > 0.05). 
DENSITY 
The most abundant birds in both cover types 
were resident species (Table 4). Cavity excava- 
tors were significantly more abundant in pine- 
oak stands (F,,,, = 4.4, P < 0.05). Total bird 
density did not differ between the two cover 
types (F,,,, = 0.5), but varied among years (F2,28 
= 6.3, P < 0.01). Pine and pine-oak stands also 
did not differ with respect to density index val- 
ues for resident species (F,,,, = OS), Neotropical 
migrants (F,,,, = O.l), ground nesters (F,,,, = 
l.l), foliage nesters (F,,,, = 0.3), secondary cav- 
ity users (F,,,, 
= O.Ol), and foliage gleaners 
(F,,,, = 0.8). Density index values varied among 
years for resident species (F2,28 = 11.0, P < 
O.OOl), ground nesters (F2,28 = 6.7, P < O.Ol), 
and foliage gleaners (F2,28 = 4.7, P < 0.05). Year 
x cover type interactions were nonsignificant (P 
> 0.05) for all bird density variables. 
DISCUSSION 
My results suggest that although ponderosa pine 
and ponderosa pine-Gambel oak forest stands in 
northern Arizona support similar breeding bird 
assemblages, they differ with respect to species 
composition and diversity. Previous studies in 
northern Arizona forests have reported apparent 
correlations between bird abundance and Gam- 
be1 oak. O’Brien (1990) reported that three sec- 
ondary cavity nesters (Pygmy Nuthatch, White- 
breasted Nuthatch, and Mountain Chickadee) 
were more abundant in a study area that had a 
more well-developed Gambel oak component, 
compared to another site with fewer oaks. 
Brawn and Balda (1988b) found that insectivor- 
ous bird species were more abundant on a study 
plot with higher Gambel oak density, compared 
to another plot that had fewer oaks, but similar 
numbers of live pines and snags.

factors may have influenced apparent differ-

pine and pine-oak stands. Although not statisti- 
cally significant, the two groups of stands dif- 
fered in the density and basal area of ponderosa 
pine, which may have affected habitat suitability 
for some species. However, stands were quite 
similar with respect to pine canopy cover, pine 
diameter, and snag density; habitat characteris- 
tics that were correlated with many breeding 
bird community attributes across a larger set of 
study areas (Rosenstock 1996). Therefore, the 
observed differences were due at least in part to 
the presence or absence of Gambel oak. 
The influence of Gambel oak on breeding 
birds likely is due to the additional nesting and

foraging substrates that oaks provide for ground, 
foliage, and canopy nesting species. Ground 
nesting species, such as Virginia’s Warbler (Zys- 
kowski 1993) and Red-faced Warbler (pers. ob- 
serv.) commonly place their nests under small, 
shrub-like oaks. Although we did not conduct 
nest searches, oaks likely were used by foliage 
nesting species found in the pine-oak cover type. 
The multiple layers of deciduous foliage provid- 
ed by Gambel oak increase potential nest sites, 
and may thereby increase species diversity 
(Martin 1988). 
Gambel oak also is used by cavity excavators 
and secondary cavity users. Compared to pon- 
derosa pine, smaller oak trees provide usable 
substrates for cavity nesters. Mean diameters of 
oaks and pines used by cavity nesters in northern 
Arizona were 38 and 71 cm, respectively (Cun- 
ningham et al. 1980). Live oaks often contain 
nest cavities, which are comparatively uncom- 
mon in live ponderosa pines (Rosenstock 1996). 
In ponderosa pine forests of northern Arizona, 
nest sites apparently are limiting for some cavity 
nesting species (Brawn and Balda 1988a), which 
have been adversely affected by historical man- 
agement practices that reduced the abundance of 
snags (Brawn and Balda 1988b). The presence 
of an alternate cavity substrate in Gambel oak 
may increase the diversity and abundance of 
cavity nesting species. Gambel oak may be par- 
ticularly important to cavity nesters in areas 
where pine snags are uncommon (Cunningham 
et al. 1980). 
Gambel oaks also provide foraging substrates 
for foliage and bark gleaning birds. Oaks on the 
study areas were used as foraging substrates by 
numerous species, including Red-faced Warbler, 
Mountain Chickadee, Pygmy Nuthatch, White- 
breasted Nuthatch, Plumbeous Vireo, Virginia’s 
Warbler, Grace’s Warbler, Yellow-rumped War- 
bler, and Western Tanager (pers. observ.). Szaro 
and Balda (1979) found that 15 breeding bird 
species generally used Gambel oak foliage in 
greater proportion than its availability. Because 
oak foliage supports more insect species (South- 
wood 1961) and greater insect biomass than 
does pine (Clary 1978), Gambel oak may be a 
preferred or higher quality foraging substrate for 
foliage gleaning birds. Studies elsewhere have 
found that the presence of a deciduous tree for- 
aging substrate affects avian community struc- 
ture and species diversity (Robinson and Holmes 
1984). 
Results of this study have implications for fu- 
ture research and management in Southwestern 
ponderosa pine forests. The differences I found 
may be limited to the season and geographic 
area encompassed by my research. Therefore, 

GAMBEL OAK INFLUENCE ON BREEDING BIRDS

studies of bird communities need to be under- 
taken during migration and winter periods, as 
well as in other forest types that have a Gambel 
oak component. Because Gambel oak appears to 
be an important habitat component, studies are 
needed to quantify specific resources provided 
by oaks, and their use by nesting and foraging 
birds. 
1997). Because of their apparent value to breed- 
ing birds, pine-oak stands should be given spe- 
cial consideration in management planning. I 
Compared to pure ponderosa pine stands, 
pine-oak stands had higher breeding bird diver- 
sity and more species of Neotropical migrants, 
ground nesters, primary cavity excavators, and 
secondary cavity users. Five Neotropical mi- 
grants that were considerably more common in, 
or restricted to the pine-oak cover type are spe- 
cies of special management concern in Arizona 
and New Mexico (Cordilleran Flycatcher, War-
