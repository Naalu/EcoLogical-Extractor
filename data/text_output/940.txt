Abstract
Fire has played an important role in the evolutionary environment of global ecosys-
tems, and Indigenous peoples have long managed natural resources in these fire-
prone environments. We worked with the Navajo Nation Forestry Department to 
evaluate the historical role of fire on a 50 km2 landscape bisected by a natural moun-
tain pass. We used fifty 5-ha circular plots to collect proxy fire history data on fire-
scarred trees, stumps, logs, and snags in a coniferous forest centered on a key 
mountain pass. The fire history data were categorized into three groups: All (all 50 
plots), Corridor (25 plots closest to Buffalo Pass drainage), and Outer (remaining 25 
plots, farther from pass). We assessed spatial and temporal patterns of fire recur-
rence and fire-climate relationships. The landscape experienced frequent fires from 
1644, the earliest fire date with sufficient sample depth, to 1920, after which fire 
occurrence was interrupted. The mean fire interval (MFI) for fire dates scarring 10% 
or more of the samples was 6.25 years; there were 13 large-scale fires identified with 
the 25% filter with an MFI of 22.6 years. Fire regimes varied over the landscape, with 
an early reduction in fire occurrence after 1829, likely associated with pastoralism, in 
the outer uplands away from the pass. In contrast, the pass corridor had continuing 
fire occurrence until the early 20th century.Synthesis. Fires were synchronized with 
large-scale top-down climatic oscillations (drought and La Niña), but the spatially ex-
plicit landscape sampling design allowed us to detect bottom-up factors of topogra-
phy, livestock grazing, and human movement patterns that interacted in complex 
ways to influence the fire regime at fine scales. Since the early 20th century, how-
ever, fires have been completely excluded. Fuel accumulation in the absence of fire 
and warming climate present challenges for future management.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Fire has played an important role in the evolutionary environment 
of global ecosystems, and Indigenous peoples have long managed 
natural resources in these fire- prone environments (Davidson- 
Hunt, 2003; Ens et al., 2015; Marsden- Smedley & Kirkpatrick, 2000; 
Mistry et al., 2005). The semi- arid forests of southwestern North 
America, with a long history of Indigenous occupation in fire- prone 
landscapes, provide an excellent opportunity in which to assess the 
role of fire in complex interactions of people and their environments 
(Fulé, Ramos- Gómez, Cortés- Montaño, & Miller, 2011). After centu-
ries of pressure for changes in land uses and management practices 
from the Euro- American majority in the U.S.A. and Mexico, only a 
few Indigenous societies in this region have maintained or restored 
the role of frequent surface fire regimes in dry coniferous forests 
(Fulé et al., 2011; Pyne, 2014; Stan, Fulé, Ireland, & Sanderlin, 2014; 
Weaver, 1951). As a result of extended fire exclusion, changes in land 
use and management practices, as well as warming climate, unchar-
acteristically severe wildfires are increasingly affecting southwest-
ern landscapes and Native nations are bearing substantial damage 
to natural resources and traditional ways of life. Several large fires 
in the southwestern region occurred on Native nations, such as the 
Rodeo- Chediski (2002) and Wallow (2011) fires on White Mountain 
Apache lands, the 2012 Las Conchas fire at Santa Clara Pueblo, and 
the 2014 Asaayi Lake fire on the Navajo Nation.
Changes in fire regimes have been widely studied in western 
North America, with the greatest number of study sites in the south-
western United States (Falk et al., 2011). However, only 3% percent 
of fire- scarred tree chronologies in Arizona and New Mexico rep-
resent tribal forests (our calculation from studies reported in Falk 
et al., 2011), although tribal forests and woodlands are about 4.7 mil-
lion ha, which is half of the size of the area that the US Forest Service 
manages in the southwest (Mason, 2014). The lack of attention to 
fire regimes on Native American lands is of particular concern be-
cause Native citizens are often closely reliant on natural resources 
and thus relatively vulnerable to catastrophic change (Voggesser, 
Lynn, Daigle, Lake, & Rance, 2013). Also, understanding changes 
in Indigenous management practices and their impacts can help us 
better manage resilient forests in fire- prone environments under 
changing climates, as suggested by application of traditional fire 
knowledge for ecological restoration at a variety of sites around 
the world (Huffman, 2013). Among the few studies that have been 
carried out on tribal lands, fire regimes were found to differ from 
the general trends in the Southwest (Savage & Swetnam, 1990; Stan 
et al., 2014), highlighting the value of increased collaboration with 
Native nations for further research.
Past fire regimes in ponderosa pine and mixed- conifer for-
ests of the southwest were characterized by frequent, relatively 
low- severity fires with mean fire intervals (MFI) ranging from 2 to 
20 years (see regional summary in Swetnam & Brown, 2011). These 
fire events were often synchronized across multiple mountain re-
gions by climatic oscillations, particularly the El Niño- Southern 
Oscillation (ENSO; Grissino- Mayer, Romme, Lisa Floyd, & Hanna, 
2004; Swetnam & Betancourt, 1990). The arrival of Euro- American 
colonists coupled with livestock grazing, logging, and fire suppres-
sion policies promoted a decline in fires beginning in the late 19th 
century (Ryan, Knapp, & Varner, 2013; Savage & Swetnam, 1990). 
Since the exclusion of fire from the landscape, there has been an ac-
cumulation of forest fuels (Hurteau, Bradford, Fulé, Taylor, & Martin, 
2014). Combined with heavy contiguous fuel loads and warming cli-
mate, this has resulted in larger and more severe fires (Dillon et al., 
2011; Westerling, Hidalgo, Cayan, & Swetnam, 2006).
The Navajo (Diné) Nation of the Southwest stands out due to 
a relatively early interruption of the fire regime circa 1830 in the 
Chuska Mountains, believed to be due to the increase in sheep graz-
ing by Navajo people (Savage & Swetnam, 1990). In the same region, 
Guiterman (2016) confirmed a post- 1830 fire decline in study sites 
where grazing was likely, based on water availability. Other sites, 
which likely had less use, did not show a decline in fire occurrence 
until circa 1870, when almost all fires ceased, similar to most other 
southwestern forests (Guiterman, 2016).
We carried out a systematic grid- based, spatially explicit sam-
pling of fire- scarred trees on a large landscape (50 km2) surround-
ing a topographic feature, Buffalo Pass, in the previously unstudied 
Lukachukai Mountains, which comprise the northern portion of the 
Chuska Mountains. Buffalo Pass is a natural corridor connecting 
Arizona to New Mexico. Historically and today, it serves as a pas-
sageway in crossing the mountain range. Our objectives for the study 
were to determine the fire regime for the Lukachukai Mountains 
landscape in order to test the following hypotheses: (H1) Fires de-
clined in our study site in the 1830s due to pastoralism, as suggested 
by other studies in the Chuska Mountains, (H2) Buffalo Pass corridor 
had a higher frequency of fire occurrence than the surrounding outer 
uplands, due to topographic influences of the pass itself as well as 
high human use which is often associated with high rates of ignition 
(Allen, 2002). Finally, we hypothesized that (H3) forest fires within 
the Lukachukai Mountains were synchronized with climatic variation 
such as drought and the El Niño/Southern Oscillation, as commonly 
observed in the Southwest (Swetnam & Betancourt, 1990).
2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 | Study area
The study area comprised the high terrain of the northern portion 
of the Chuska Mountains, often called the Lukachukai Mountains, 
located on the Navajo Nation. The Chuska Mountain range is situ-
ated within the Colorado Plateau, encompassing the northeastern 
region of Arizona and extending into northwestern New Mexico. 
Soils are primarily sandy loam soils derived from Chuska Sandstone 
parent material. Dispersed throughout the mountain range are py-
roclastic lava flows and protrusions from the Pliocene Navajo- Hopi 
volcanic region (Appledorn & Wright, 1957). The total extent for our 
Lukachukai study site is ~50 km2, with an elevational range of ap-
proximately 2,340–3,710 m. Pinus ponderosa (Lawson & C. Lawson) is

the dominant tree species, along with patches of Populus tremuloides 
(Michx.), Quercus gambelii (Nutt.), and mixed conifer stands including 
Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Beissn.) and Abies concolor (Gord. 
& Glend.) Lindl. ex Hildebr on the north- facing slopes. The study area 
is centered on Buffalo Pass, a topographical watershed divide, and 
travel corridor between Arizona and New Mexico. Average annual 
precipitation in the community of Lukachukai (elevation: 1,996 m, 
approximately 8.8 km southwest of study site) is 240 mm (1914–
2010) with average winter snowfall of 43 cm (Western Regional 
Climate Center, 2010). Precipitation follows a bimodal annual pat-
tern with winter precipitation influenced by the El Niño- Southern 
Oscillation (ENSO) and summer precipitation in the form of mon-
soonal rain from July to September. Historic fire regimes in the re-
gion are linked to La Niña, the negative phase of ENSO (Swetnam & 
Betancourt, 1990).
Management includes sheep grazing beginning in the early 19th 
century and continuing to the present day on an annual cycle from 
June to September for the high country of the Chuska Mountain 
range (Savage & Swetnam, 1990; Strawn & Littrell, 2007). There 
are large open meadows dispersed throughout the study site with 
a small perennial stream running through the Buffalo Pass drainage. 
Water tanks, livestock herds, ranchers, sheepherders, and ances-
tral homesteads are found throughout the study site, evidence of 
grazing, and social influences that are still occurring on the land-
scape. Timber harvesting on the Navajo Nation began in the 1880s 
(Einbender- Velez, 1993). The Navajo Forest Products Industries 
reached the level of harvesting and processing 40–50 million board 
feet of ponderosa yearly (10- year Forest Management Plan, 1983) 
before its closure in the early 1990s; remnant stumps from these 
harvests are present throughout the site. According to the manage-
ment plan, fire management for this region of the Navajo Nation is 
based on a policy of fire suppression, although limited prescribed 
burning is carried out on a few areas.
2.2 | Field sampling
We selected grid- based sampling in order to systematically assess 
temporal and spatial patterns over a large contiguous landscape 
(Farris, Baisan, Falk, Yool, & Swetnam, 2010; Farris et al., 2013; Fulé, 
Moore, & Covington, 1997; O′Connor, Falk, Lynch, & Swetnam, 
2014). We created a 1 × 1 km grid of fifty plots within the study area 
starting from a randomly selected point. At each gridpoint, we cre-
ated a circular 5- ha plot (126.2 m radius) within which we searched 
for fire- scarred trees. We aimed to collect approximately 4–6 sam-
ples per plot. When more scarred trees were available, we selected 
those which had the highest number of scars to best capture the 
full sequence of past fire events. Tree structures known to record 
the oldest fires, such as fallen logs, were sampled when available 
(Yocom Kent & Fulé, 2015). Past harvesting had removed the major-
ity of old trees, so most samples were taken from stumps. Fire scars 
were almost never encountered on living trees, but we did sample a 
partial section from two living trees; this technique causes minimal 
injury (Heyerdahl & McKay, 2017). The landscape was dominated by 
coniferous forest but in some cases, the plot centers fell in meadows, 
rocky areas, or wetlands. Our protocol for fire- scar collection was 
that such plots were moved 150 m north of grid center and contin-
ued in each cardinal direction if no samples were obtained. In total, 
the area searched for fire- scarred trees was 50 × 5 ha = 250 ha, 
spaced on a regular 1 × 1 km grid representing 5,000 ha. Past har-
vesting had removed the majority of old trees, so most samples were 
taken from stumps. In the following text, each sample means an in-
dividual tree.
2.3 | Laboratory, statistical, and modeling analysis
Cross- sectional samples were glued to wooden mounts and trimmed 
flat with a table saw or bandsaw. We then sanded cross sections 
with progressively finer grits of sandpaper until wood cells were 
clearly visible under magnification. Tree rings were visually cross- 
dated (Stokes & Smiley, 1968) with a tree- ring chronology from the 
Chuska Mountains (Guiterman, Swetnam, & Dean, 2016) and an un-
published local tree- ring chronology that we developed. We meas-
ured tree rings to the nearest 0.001 mm with a Velmex measuring 
stage and Measure J2X software. COFECHA software (Grissino- 
Mayer, 2001) was used to check the quality of cross- dating. Many 
samples were difficult to cross- date visually. Tree rings of these 
samples were measured as floating chronologies, and the COFECHA 
software was used to identify likely dates. All dating was confirmed 
visually, and all samples were checked by a second dendrochronolo-
gist. Fire- scar locations within the annual growth rings were desig-
nated as: D (Dormant), EE (Early earlywood), ME (Middle earlywood), 
LE (Late earlywood), and L (Latewood) (Baisan & Swetnam, 1990). 
Following Baisan and Swetnam (1990), we interpreted intraring 
positions as being related to the timing in the growing or dormant 
seasons when the injury occurred; however, we acknowledge that 
these estimates are approximate. Some scar positions were labeled 
as “Undetermined” if the position was difficult to detect, especially 
in very narrow rings, or if the scarred area had been eroded by fire 
or weathering.
Fire history data were categorized in three groups: All (all 50 
plots), Corridor (the 25 plots closest to the Buffalo Pass drainage), 
and Outer (the remaining 25 plots to the north and south, farther 
from the pass) (Figure 1). The pass corridor itself is relatively nar-
row but we divided the plots into two equal groups so that the fire 
histories could be compared on an equal- area basis. We analyzed 
spatial and temporal fire patterns using FHAES software (Brewer, 
Velásquez, Sutherland, & Falk, 2016). We calculated fire regime 
statistics based on fire dates recorded by ≥2 fire scars recorded on 
different trees. Recording trees are those with an existing scar, mak-
ing them relatively sensitive recorders of fire (Farris et al., 2013). In 
addition to considering all fire dates, we also applied proportional 
filters to assess fire years in which scarring affected ≥10% of the 
recording samples and ≥25% of the recording samples. The 10% 
and 25% scarred filters represent proportionately more widespread 
fires across the landscape (Farris et al., 2013). We applied the filters 
at the tree level (e.g., the ≥10%- scarred filter required ≥21 trees of

the 201 sample trees, as opposed to five of 50 plots) (Van Horne 
& Fulé, 2006) rather than compositing fire histories by plot (Farris 
et al., 2010; O′Connor et al., 2014). Either approach could be ap-
propriate or both can be readily calculated from the online dataset 
at the International Multiproxy Paleofire Database (IMPD; https://
www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/paleoclimatology-data/datasets/
fire-history). The method we used is relatively conservative, mean-
ing that fire intervals tend to be longer for the 10% and 25% cate-
gories than if plot composites were used, because there is a higher 
minimum number of scarred samples to meet for each filter. We as-
sessed the fire interval data with parametric statistics and also fit a 
Weibull distribution, which is often applied to fire interval distribu-
tions because they tend to be skewed (Grissino- Mayer, 1999).
Fire and climate relationships were tested on fires that scarred 
a minimum of two trees and the all fires, 10%, and 25%- scarred fil-
ter using Superposed Epoch Analysis (SEA) in the package “burnr” 
for R (Malevich, Guiterman, & Margolis, 2018). We used the SEA to 
determine the mean value of a climatic variable before, during, and 
after the years of fire events. The analysis period extended from 
5 years prior to the fire year, the fire year, and 2 years after the fire. 
Statistical significance was determined with a 95% confidence in-
terval using bootstrap methods with 1,000 simulations. The climate 
variables were a Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) reconstruc-
tion averaged from the four nearest 2. 5° × 2.5° gridpoints (numbers 
103, 104,118, and 119) from the North American Drought Atlas 
(Cook & Krusic, 2004). These four gridpoints are highly intercor-
related over the period 1644–1920, average r = 0.90. We also used 
the NINO3 reconstruction of the Southern Oscillation Index (Cook, 
2000).
3 | RESULTS
We collected 243 samples of P. ponderosa and five of P. menziesii; we 
cross- dated and used 201 of the 248 collected samples (81%) in this 
study. The unused samples were undateable due to short, compla-
cent, and/or decayed tree rings. The 201 fire- scarred trees included 
two live trees, 35 snags, 45 logs, and 119 stumps. Results in the fol-
lowing sections are presented in three categories. The category “All” 
includes all 50 plots. The category “Corridor” comprises the 25 plots 
closest to the Buffalo Pass canyon, while the category “Outer” con-
sists of the remaining 25 plots in the uplands farther from Buffalo 
Pass (Figure 1).
3.1 | Fire regime changes
Fire occurrence within the full Lukachukai landscape (All 50 plots) 
was frequent until the late 19th century, after which there was a 
decline in fire events (Figure 2). At the scale of the full study area, 
therefore, our first hypothesis that fires would decline after ≈1830 
was not confirmed. Nonetheless, a reduction in fire occurrence 
was apparent in the mid- 1800s compared to the preceding century 
(Figure 2), which we discuss below. The earliest fire dated from the 
201 samples occurred in 1472; the final fire date was 1920. We as-
sessed the fire interval distribution during the period 1644–1920, 
the earliest and latest fire dates representing a sample depth of 
10% or more of the recording samples. The mean fire interval (MFI) 
for the full site ranged from 3.17 years for all fire events, approxi-
mately double (6.25 years) when using the 10%- scarred filter, and 
22.60 years using the 25%- scarred filter. The minimum fire interval 
was 1 year for all- scarred and 10%- scarred filter and increased to 
2 years when using the 25%- scarred filter. A Weibull distribution 
model fit the data for all filters. The Weibull median probability in-
terval (WMPI) was within <2.5 years of the MFI, a similarity which 
indicated that the fire interval distributions were not substantially 
skewed (Table 1).
Seasonal position of the fire injury could be determined for 759 
(66%) of the total of 1,153 fire scars (Figure 3). Most fires occurred 
in the dormant season (36%) or in the early (20%) to middle (24%) 
part of the growing season. Late earlywood accounted for 16% of 
scarring and latewood totaled 4% (Figure 3).
3.2 | Corridor versus outer regions
Differences in nineteenth- century fire regimes were revealed by 
separating the landscape into the Buffalo Pass corridor versus the 
outer portion. Smaller fires occurred slightly more frequently in the 
corridor compared to the outer portion of the landscape, partially 
supporting our second hypothesis, as shown by the approximately 
6%–10% shorter mean fire intervals for all fires and those scarring 
10% of the samples (Table 1). In the 25%- scarred category, the cor-
ridor had a 26% lower MFI when compared to the outer region.
More important, the landscape separation revealed a key spatial 
difference in terms of the initial fire regime interruption. Changes 
in fire regime were distinctly different between the regions: After 
1829, the outer portion had only one fire that exceeded the 10% 
filter, in the year 1870. In contrast, the corridor had a pattern of 
frequent fires exceeding the 10% filter which continued until the 
last fire in 1916 (Figure 2). The difference in landscape patterns of 
burning after 1829 means that while the first research hypothesis 
was not confirmed across the full landscape, the outer region farther 
away from the Buffalo Pass corridor did experience a clear reduction 
in fire occurrence in this time period.
3.3 | Fire–climate relationship
The SEA results showed significant interannual variability of drought 
as assessed by reconstructed PDSI before and during fire years 
(1644–1920). Fire years were generally preceded by wet conditions, 
switching to significantly dry conditions (negative PDSI) in the fire 
year and subsequent years. Fires were more likely to occur in La 
Niña years (negative values of NINO3, Figure 5). The 13 fire dates 
that met the 25%- scarred filter across the entire study area were 
1685, 1698, 1708, 1727, 1729, 1748, 1768, 1772, 1778, 1795, 1824, 
and 1870; ten of these thirteen fires occurred in years with notably 
below- average PDSI values (Figure 6).

4 | DISCUSSION
The historical fire regime of the Lukachukai Mountains bears many 
similarities to fire patterns reported in the Chuska Mountains and 
broadly across the Southwest. However, the spatially explicit land-
scape sampling method used in this study showed unique fine- scale 
differences associated with topographic and land- use features. The

4.1 | H1: Fires declined in the 1830s due to 
pastoralism
From 1644, the earliest fire date with sufficient sample depth for 
statistical analysis, until 1920, the last fire date with ≥2 fire- scarred 
samples, the landscape experienced frequent fires, with an MFI of 
6.25 years for fire dates in which 10% or more of the recording sam-
ples were scarred and 22.6 years for the 25% filter. There was not 
a detectable reduction in fire frequency in the mid- 18th century at 
the scale of the entire landscape, although there were differences at 
finer scales, discussed in the following section.
Overall, the fire regime was broadly similar in terms of frequency 
and dates of fire regime shifts to those reported in nearby forests, 
albeit with the latest date of complete fire exclusion (1920) reported 
in the closest sites in the Four Corners region. Guiterman (2016) re-
ported fire intervals in the 10%- scarred category as ranging from 
6.8 to 26.8 years at seven sites, including the site previously de-
scribed by Savage and Swetnam (1990) in the Chuska Mountains. 
An additional site had a much longer MFI of 78.0 years (Guiterman, 
2016). Several fire regime reconstructions have been carried out 
in mountains around the Chuska range. To the south in the Zuni 
Mountains (NM), Rother and Grissino- Mayer (2014) reported MFI 
values (25%- scarred) of 6.1–7.9 years in ponderosa forests with fires 
ceasing after 1880. To the northeast in the San Juan Mountains 
(CO), in relatively mesic mixed- conifer forests, Grissino- Mayer et al. 
(2004) found average fire return intervals of 21–30 years (final 
fire dates 1880 or 1890) and Fulé, Korb, and Wu (2009) reported 
MFI values (10%- scarred) of 32.3 years (final fire in 1868). To the 
northwest, Heyerdahl, Brown, Kitchen, and Weber (2011) reported 
“plot- composite low- severity fire intervals” averaging 31 years in the 
Abajo Mountains (UT), with fire exclusion after about 1895. In sum-
mary, the Lukachukai Mountains fire regime was relatively  similar 
in broad strokes to the regimes reconstructed from surrounding 
forests, despite specific details such as the early alteration of fire 
regime after 1830, the somewhat late fire interruption date of 1920, 
and the fire variation between the Buffalo Pass versus the outer up-
lands. In contrast to the notably different modern fire patterns on 
Hualapai Tribal lands (Stan et al., 2014) or San Carlos Apache Tribal 
lands (Pyne, 2014), the Lukachukai Mountains underwent a long fire- 
free period after the early 20th century similar to that of southwest-
ern public lands.
4.2 | H2: Buffalo Pass corridor has a higher 
frequency of fire occurrence than surrounding 
outer uplands
The data supported the second hypothesis that the Buffalo Pass cor-
ridor had higher fire occurrence than the outer boundaries of the 
study site, although the difference had more to do with the temporal 
duration of the fire regime than the statistical attributes of fire fre-
quency prior to 1830. Fires in the 10% fire- scarred category on the 
outer boundary of the Lukachukai study site ceased after 1870 but 
in the Buffalo Pass corridor fires persisted until 1916 (the 1920 fire 
was recorded on at least two trees but did not reach the 10%- filter 
threshold). Furthermore, the division of the landscape into corridor 
versus outer regions provided support for the pastoralism hypoth-
esis, H1, because the fire regime in the outer region did decline nota-
bly after 1829. Only a single fire, in 1870, exceeded the 10%- scarred 
threshold (Figure 2). In sum, the fire regimes of the corridor and 
outer regions were not distinguishable prior to 1829 but after that 
date the outer region underwent a fire reduction while the corridor

continued to burn frequently. Burning in the corridor was sufficient 
to maintain the fire regime across the entire study area, causing us to 
reject the pastoralism hypothesis in the preceding section. However, 
in the outer region of the landscape, the reduction in surface fuel 
associated with pastoralism post- 1829 is a plausible factor in fire re-
gime change (Savage & Swetnam, 1990).
The Buffalo Pass corridor and outer regions appear to pro-
vide a finer- scale contrast in nineteenth- century fire regimes than 
the differences observed at coarser scales by Guiterman (2016). 
Guiterman (2016) separated the Chuska and Defiance Plateau 
mountain ranges into areas that were likely used for livestock 
grazing as evidenced by the presence of water and settlements 
versus probably unused areas, showing that fires were reduced in 
used areas beginning around 1830 but not in unused areas until 
around 1880. At Buffalo Pass, we found both patterns, fire reduc-
tion and fire continuity, in close proximity. Furthermore, the entire 
Lukachukai landscape meets Guiterman′s criteria for a “used” site: 
There is water at least seasonally in the pass drainage as well as 
several springs and shallow lakes scattered throughout the up-
lands, while the pass provides access to well- established settle-
ments on either side.
Given that pastoralism is a plausible cause for the post- 1829 
fire decline observed in the Lukachukai outer region, why does 
not the Buffalo Pass corridor exhibit this same trend? Fires con-
tinued in the corridor not only between 1830 and 1870 but also 
for several additional decades later. Our finding suggests that 
there are additional natural and human- caused factors driving 
the prolonged fire events in the corridor. Differences in topo-
graphic position from the pass bottom to the ridge top and the 
“chimney effect” of wind drawn through a canyon have been doc-
umented as major influences in fire behavior in other southwest-
ern forests (Holsinger, Parks, & Miller, 2016; Iniguez, Swetnam, & 
Yool, 2008). Possibly, there was more surface fuel in the Corridor 
plots due to more mesic conditions (shading, higher water table). 
The fact that people have moved through the Pass throughout 
the past, providing additional ignition sources, likely also contrib-
uted to prolonging fire in the Buffalo Pass corridor. In sum, even 
though grazing likely occurred in the Buffalo Pass corridor after 
1830, as in the outer region, the fire- favoring factors of topogra-
phy and ignition may have maintained the fire regime for nearly a 
century after it was first interrupted circa 1830.
4.3 | H3: Forest fires within the Lukachukai 
Mountains were synchronized with climatic variation
We found strong evidence that forest fires within the Lukachukai 
Mountains were synchronized by climate. Climatic oscillations that 
affected fires across the southwestern United States (Swetnam 
& Brown, 2011) were evident in the Lukachukai Mountains with

Oscillation (ENSO) being strong drivers of large- scale fires. SEA results 
show that fires occurred primarily during significantly dry years and 
were preceded by above- average wet years. This pattern is consist-
ent with trends seen in other southwestern forests in which a buildup 
of surface fuels is antecedent to a switch to drier years (Swetnam & 
Baisan, 1996; Swetnam & Betancourt, 1998). The pattern of fire–cli-
mate synchrony at Buffalo Pass was highly similar to that reported by 
Guiterman (2016) in the nearby Chuska Mountains. Fire seasonality 
was broadly consistent with results from other southwestern sites, 
with most fires occurring in the dormant season and early to middle 
growing seasons, consistent with the premonsoonal dry period and 
onset of lightning storms. Patterns of human- caused versus lightning- 
ignited fires are difficult to distinguish in fire- scar reconstructions 
(Kaye & Swetnam, 1999); we did not observe any distinct patterns 
that would permit identification of fire causes.
Within the period of study (1644–1920), our sites recorded ap-
proximately 50% of the largest fire years and only one of the small-
est fire years (1649) captured in the southwestern United States 
from 1600 to 2000 (Swetnam & Brown, 2011). Comparing the 
largest fire years in the Southwest to large fires at our landscape 
(25% fire- scarred filter), there are only eight fire years: 1698, 1708, 
1727, 1768, 1772, 1778, 1795, and 1824 recorded in our site which 
do not coincide with other large fire years of the southwestern 
United States. The high synchrony of burning between the isolated 
Lukachukai/Chuska Mountains and other widely scattered south-
western sites is consistent with the argument by Swetnam and 
Betancourt (1990, 1998) that large- scale synoptic climate forcing 
associated with ENSO entrains large- scale patterns of fire (La Niña) 
and lack of fire (El Niño).
5 | CONCLUSIONS
First, the fine- scale differences between the corridor and the 
outer region on a 50 km2 landscape show that in addition to the 
top- down driver (climate), there are bottom- up drivers (fuel con-
tinuity, people, landscape configuration, etc.) affecting fire at 
local to landscape scales (Ireland, Stan, & Fulé, 2012). The results 
confirm differences in fire regime between Indigenous lands ver-
sus neighboring non- Indigenous lands in the Southwest, a char-
acteristic observed at other places worldwide (Mistry, Bibiana, & 
Berardi, 2016). Our findings underscore the needs for increasing 
knowledge on fire regimes and management practices using fire in 
Indigenous social- ecological systems using paleoecological, his-
torical, and social science research (Huffman, 2013; Trauernicht, 
Brook, Murphy, Williamson, & Bowman, 2015). Second, spatially 
explicit sampling of fire regime patterns over large landscapes re-
veals detailed patterns that may not be detected by coarser or 
finer- scale approaches. Burning patterns interact with climate 
variation over space and time to produce a self- limiting effect on 
fire characteristics (Parks, Parisien, Miller, Holsinger, & Baggett, 
2018) that may be critical to avoid fuel buildup resulting in large 
crown fires such as the Asaayi Lake fire. Even the largest fire 
event—1748—recorded at 41 of the 50 gridpoints (also the largest 
historical fire year in the entire Southwest, Swetnam & Brown, 
2011) left behind a legacy of fire- surviving scarred trees at nearly 
every sampling point on the 1 × 1 km grid, showing that this large 
fire was not “stand- replacing.” In contrast, the Asaayi Lake fire 
burned 59.5 km2 in the Chuska Mountains in 2014 with mostly 
lethal intensity, leaving large patches of complete tree mortality. 
Third, while the past fire regime of the Lukachukai Mountains 
was complex and affected by human activities at different spa-
tial and temporal scales, since the early twentieth- century fires 
have been completely excluded. This extended fire- free period is 
unprecedented in the past several centuries in which fire history 
can be reconstructed from tree rings, and probably much longer 
back in ecological and evolutionary history (Anderson, Allen, 
Toney, Jass, & Bair, 2008). Since the last fire event to occur in the 
Lukachukai Mountains was approximately a century ago, forest 
managers should take account the wide departure from past fire 
patterns. It is likely that forest structural change and fuel accumu-
lation due to fire exclusion, in combination with warming climate, 
present a hazardous situation favoring future severe burning. The 
loss of forest ecosystem services is particularly acute in Native 
communities due to the traditional cultural and spiritual value of 
the landscape, a high incidence of poverty which makes it difficult 
to substitute for local natural resources (Voggesser et al., 2013), 
and anticipated further losses due to warming climate (Azpeleta 
et al., 2014). Forest fuels treatments such as tree thinning and 
fire use, together with climate- sensitive modeling of future forest 
change, are important to consider in guiding future management.
