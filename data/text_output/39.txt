Abstract.
Forests adapted to frequent-fire regimes are being treated to reduce fuel hazards and restore ecosystem
processes. The maintenance of treatment effects under future climates is a critical issue. We modelled forest change under
different climate scenarios for 100 years on ponderosa pine landscapes in the south-western USA, comparing management
regimes that included prescribed burning, tree cutting, and no-management. We applied the Forest Vegetation Simulator
(1) in its standard form, and (2) with modifications of reduced tree growth and increased mortality to simulate the effects of
two levels of climate change. Without climate change effects, several management regimes, including the use of frequent
burning similar to the historical fire frequency (,5 year), maintained future forest structure within a target range of
variability. In contrast, simulations that accounted for climate change effects indicated that burning intervals should be
lengthened (,20 year) and future tree thinning should be avoided to minimise forest decline. Although it has been widely
predicted that future climate conditions will support more burning (warmer, drier fuels, longer fire season), our modelling
suggests that the production of fuels will decline, so there will eventually be a trade-off between increased fire, driven by
climate, v. reduced fuel, also driven by climate.

Introduction
Prescribed thinning and burning treatments have been used in
many ponderosa pine forests in an effort to decrease unchar-
acteristically severe stand-replacing fires and restore ecosystem
function (Covington et al. 1997; Allen et al. 2002; Moore et al.
2003). Implementing these treatments is only a first step towards
sustainable management, however. Long-term maintenance of
treated ecosystems presents challenges including the choice
of treatments, scheduling future actions, estimating future costs
and benefits, and accounting for uncertainty. Vegetation simu-
lation modelling, which incorporates fire and other management
actions, is a useful tool for forecasting the effects of treatments
under alternative future scenarios (Keane et al. 2004; Hurteau
and North 2009).
Modelling for long-term management requires consideration
of climate change. The climate of the south-western United
States is predicted to become drier over the next century as
higher temperatures result in greater evaporative loss, increas-
ing the potential for severe drought (Seager et al. 2007). Drought
can lead to forest dieback, higher susceptibility to disturbance,
and species migration, changing the structure and composition
of forests (Allen and Breshears 1998; Mueller et al. 2005).
The predicted increase in the frequency and intensity of future
droughts in the south-west is likely to increase tree mortality
(Allen and Breshears 1998; Gitlin et al. 2006) and reduce
growth.
The Mount Trumbull restoration site located on the Arizona
Strip in north-western Arizona is the largest long-standing
(since 1995) ponderosa pine restoration project in the south-
west (Friederici 2003). This well-monitored project has been a
pioneer site for landscape data on forest restoration effects on
vegetation, wildlife and fire hazard (Germaine and Germaine
2002; Roccaforte et al. 2008, 2009). Although the site has been
managed for the first stages of restoration, the future of the
Mount Trumbull forest ecosystem depends on the strategy to
maintain restored sites. We selected Mount Trumbull to model
the effects of alternative practical management approaches
because it is a realistic landscape example, useful for both the
south-west and the Great Basin in the USA, where treatments
have already been implemented and measured.
Our goal in this study was to compare treatment methods and
schedules for long-term maintenance of forest restoration treat-
ments. We applied a forest simulation model both (1) in its
standard form, and (2) with modifications to account for climate
change effects to forecast changes in tree structure, potential
forest products and carbon under alternative scenarios. Our
specific objectives were to (1) forecast tree growth for 100 years
under alternative climate and management scenarios using the
Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS); (2) estimate changes in
forest structure, biomass, carbon and wood removed under the
different scenarios; and (3) use this information to compare
management alternatives.

Methods
Site description
The Mount Trumbull ecosystem restoration project covers over
1200 ha in the Grand Canyon–Parashant National Monument
(latitude 368220N, longitude 113870W), managed by the Bureau
of Land Management (BLM) and the National Park Service
(NPS) (Moore et al. 2003). The Mount Trumbull site was chosen
for the present study because (1) it is a deliberately designed
ecological restoration experiment based on historical forest
pattern and process, an approach that has been advocated for
western forests (e.g. Allen et al. 2002); (2) the site has a com-
prehensive dataset with pretreatment measurements beginning
in 1995 and a landscape-scale control area; and (3) it is a real
project with the work completed on the ground, not a hypothe-
tical analysis.
The dominant vegetation type is pine–oak (Pinus ponderosa
and Quercus gambelii) forest. Other species include New
Mexican locust (Robinia neomexicana), Utah juniper (Juni-
perus osteosperma) and pinyon pine (Pinus edulis). Soils parent
material is basalt or volcanic cinders. Elevation at the study
site ranges from 2000 to 2250 m. Weather data were taken from
remote automated weather stations (RAWS) within 3 km of
the study area. The average temperature ranged from 0.298C in
January to 20.98C in July (Western Regional Climate Center
2008). Precipitation averaged 430 mm annually between 1992
and 2005 (Nixon Flats) and 326 mm annually between 1985 and
2005 (Mount Logan).
Field methods
A total of 117 permanent plots, each 20  50 m, were established
on a 300-m grid. There are 55 control plots, 61 treated plots,
and 1 plot that crossed the treatment–control boundary. These
plots were established from 1995 to 1997, before treatments.
Beginning in 1995, ecological restoration treatments of tree
cutting and prescribed burning were applied. Treatment details
were described by Roccaforte et al. (2009). Forest floor fuels
were raked away from the boles of trees that pre-dated the onset
of fire exclusion (1870) to minimise heat damage. Younger trees
were thinned, maintaining a residual density of 150–300% that
of the pre-fire-exclusion forest. Slash was lopped and scattered,
followed by prescribed burning.
Overstorey trees with diameter at breast height (DBH)
15 cm were measured on each plot (0.1 ha). Pole-sized trees
between 2.5 and 15 cm DBH were measured on one-quarter
of each plot (0.025 ha). All of the measured trees were tagged
and tree attributes (species, DBH, height, crown base height and
condition) were measured. Seedlings and saplings o2.5 cm
DBH were counted as regeneration and measured in a 0.005-ha
subplot.
Forest simulation modelling
The FVS, an individual tree growth and yield statistical model
(Dixon 2003), was used to project future stand conditions under
different scenarios (Table 1). This model was chosen because it
is widely available and used by many scientists and management
agencies. Robinson and Monserud (2003) developed criteria to
determine the adaptability of forest growth simulation models
and concluded that FVS was the most adaptable of the
models, especially because of its source code availability, well-
documented fitting process, and broad geographical coverage
with independent development of variants for populations in
different regions. We used the Central Rockies variant of FVS
with the south-west Ponderosa Pine model, which uses local tree
growth, mortality and volume equations from national forests in
the south-west (Arizona and New Mexico). The south-western
Ponderosa Pine model is considered highly precise in this region
(Edminster et al. 1991). We used the Kaibab National Forest
code for our models because it is on the Arizona Strip and shares

similar elevations with Mount Trumbull, providing local coef-
ficients for growth and volume equations (Keyser and Dixon
2010). Model simulations were projected in 10-year increments
for 100 years into the future (2008–2108). We calculated the
ponderosa pine site index as 33.4 m at the 100-year index age
(Minor 1964). The maximum Stand Density Index when pon-
derosa pinecomposed81–100% ofthe stand was1269trees ha1,
assuming trees of 25.5-cm DBH (Woodall et al. 2005).
Statistical models are not normally applied to predict the
effects of climate change because these models are only accurate
under environmental conditions similar to those that charac-
terised the datasets from which they were built. However,
statistical models have importance in verifying the potential
impacts of climate change. These models use empirical relation-
ships of current climate–vegetation patterns, which may be
useful in predicting vegetation distribution following climate
change (Iverson and Prasad 2001). The effects of climate change
on stand development can be predicted with FVS by specifying
how tree growth and mortality will respond to changing climate
(Crookston and Dixon 2005). We modified the standard FVS
model to simulate the effect of predicted climate change,
following the example of Stage (2002), who modified FVS to
reflect the ecological effects of climate change. We manipulated
two FVS keywords regulating tree growth and mortality (Stage
2002). These changes simulated effects of warmer and drier
conditions predicted for the south-western United States in the
21st century (Seager et al. 2007).
Reduced tree growth expected under climate change was
simulated with the FVS keyword BAIMult, a multiplier used to
change basal area increment. Severe drought in south-eastern
pine forests resulted in average growth reductions of ,36%
(Klos et al. 2009). Data from ponderosa pine in northern Arizona
presented by McDowell et al. (2006) showed reductions in
basal area increment by 36–50% in the recent severe drought
years 1996 and 2000. We tested a range of increments, ranging
from 0.25 to 0.75, where 1 represents normal growth (Fig. 1).
We chose BAIMult ¼ 0.5 for modelling the climate scenarios,
selecting the more severe end of the previously observed range
because Seager et al. (2007) forecast drought in the 21st century
‘worse than any since the Medieval period, because the La Nin˜a
conditions will be perturbing a base state that is drier than any
state experienced recently’.
Tree mortality is expected to increase under drought
conditions (Breshears et al. 2005), so we used the keyword
FIXMORT to set a defined proportion of additional mortality.
Mortality in severe drought in south-eastern pine forests aver-
aged 1% per year (Klos et al. 2009), 12% over 7 years in an
oak–pine forest (Elliott and Swank 1994). The study closest to
Mount Trumbull looked at drought-caused mortality following
the severe 2002 drought in northern Arizona (Gitlin et al. 2006).
Mortality ranged from 1 to 83% and the average mortality
was 15.9% for ponderosa pine (Gitlin et al. 2006). Sites that
suffer high mortality during one drought event are considered
more likely to suffer higher mortality in future drought events
(Mueller et al. 2005). We selected a range of 0–30% mortality
per decade for our analysis. We considered this range to be
reasonable because it included the 15.9% mortality observed by
Gitlin et al. (2006) as well as the potentially higher mortality of
pine during more severe droughts.
Model results are reported in three categories related to
climate effects. The standard FVS simulations are called ‘No
climate’ scenarios. The climate scenarios include reduced
basal area increment and increased mortality, compared with
the standard simulations. The ‘Climate low’ and ‘Climate high’
scenarios are 15 and 30% mortality respectively. All simulation
conditions are described in Table 1.
The Central Rockies variant of FVS requires users to specify
regeneration. Regeneration in the south-west is strongly episo-
dic and infrequent (Savage et al. 1996), and synchronous
regeneration events are reflected in even-aged cohorts across
the south-west, notably in the White Mountains (Cooper 1960),
Chuska Mountains (Savage 1991) and near Flagstaff (White
1985). Gaps between regeneration events that can last for a few
decades have been documented (Lieberg et al. 1904; Savage
et al. 1996). To simulate synchronous regeneration events and
gaps, we chose two regeneration scenarios that were used for
all modelling scenarios: ‘Regen low’ (regeneration established
in 2008) and ‘Regen high’ (regeneration established in 2008 and
2058). We initialised the regeneration with field data from
Mount Trumbull (Roccaforte et al. 2009). A previous study
using FVS to model ponderosa pine forests with historical data
in northern Arizona found that regeneration inputs to the model
had to be increased by 40% over measured seedlings and sprouts
to produce realistic results (Fule´ et al. 2004). We followed the
same procedure and set survival of regeneration to be 100%,
meaning that young trees were allowed to survive until simu-
lated density-dependent mortality or treatment effects (e.g.
simulated mortality from fire or thinning) impacted them.
We included oak regeneration in model scenario but used the
NoSprout keyword to avoid unrealistic increases in density.
Management scenarios
We met with BLM and NPS land managers to develop realistic
management scenarios. Ecological restoration is an explicit goal
in the mission of Grand Canyon–Parashant National Monument,
suggesting that there will be administrative support for sus-
taining the effects of treatments over time.

Future climate affects management strategies

No-management scenarios
After the first implementation of restoration treatments to the
treated area, the simulation was run without applying future
treatments to either the control (No-management Control) or
treated area (No-management Treated). This was the base model
with which the other treatments were compared and it was the
only management scenario for the control area.
Burning with three different fire return intervals
The treated area had three simulations with different pre-
scribed burning intervals: 5, 10 and 20 years. The 5-year burning
interval is within the range of natural variability for ponderosa
pine forests near Mount Trumbull; historical mean fire intervals
in ponderosa pine forests nearby at Grand Canyon ranged from 3
to 8.6 years (Fule´ et al. 2003). The managers were interested in
exploring fire use at longer intervals because prescribed burning
is costly, produces smoke, and has a risk of escaped fire. The
10-year burning interval was just above the maximum fire-free
interval of 9 years for Grand Canyon (Fule´ et al. 2003). Finally,
we chose a longer 20-year interval because of evidence that even
fires occurring at extended intervals can maintain open forest
structure and reduce fuels (Fule´ and Laughlin 2007), while
reducing negative impacts such as enhancing non-native species
(Keeley 2006).
We selected the Burn Frequency option to control fire
intervals. Each fire interval had the same weather and burning
conditions: wind speed was 4 km h1, moisture level was 2
(‘Dry’), temperature was 17.98C, and the area of the stand
burned was 70%. The weather data were taken from the 10-year
(1998–2007) average October RAWS data from Nixon Flats and
Mount Logan (Western Regional Climate Center 2008).
Burn during different seasons
Land managers wanted to test the application of prescribed
burns in the summer to replicate the natural fire season, as
opposed to the current practice of burning in the spring or fall.
Therefore, we tested three different burning seasons: spring,
summer and fall (autumn). Each simulation was run with a fire
return interval of 10 years. The percentage of area of the stand
burned remained the same for all three simulations (70%).
The moisture level was 2 (‘Dry’) for the spring and fall burns,
whereas it was 3 (‘Very dry’) for the summer burn. The spring
burn had a wind speed of 5.3 km h1 and average temperature of
14.78C, whereas summer burn had a wind speed of 3.4 km h1
and an average temperature of 29.98C. The fall burn was the
same as described in the test of burn frequencies above. The
spring, summer and fall temperature and wind data were taken
from the months of April, July and October respectively.
Thinning
Fuel reduction treatments via thinning could reduce the need
to burn as often. However, thinning treatments are expensive
and the trees to be removed are of low economic value (Hjerpe
et al. 2009). Ponderosa pine was the only species thinned
(Roccaforte et al. 2009). We designed two Thin Only fuel
treatments, 50 years apart, in 2048 and 2098. The ‘Thin 60%’
scenario had 60% of basal area removed. The ‘Thin 40%’
scenario had 40% of basal area removed. Pine trees o70 cm
DBH were available to be thinned whereas trees 70 cm DBH
were left on the landscape, matching the diameter limits used
during the initial restoration (Moore et al. 2003).
Burn and thin
Forest restoration in much of the south-west involves both
tree thinning and prescribed fire (Covington et al. 1997; Allen
et al. 2002); our final management scenario linked these treat-
ments to emulate the original restoration treatment and to
compare with burning or thinning alone. The treated area had
the two thin-from-below treatments (Thin 40% and 60%) with
prescribed burning every 10 years.
Assessing model outcomes
To assess the outcomes of the scenarios, simulated future
forest characteristics were compared with the range of varia-
bility in historical forest characteristics. Within the Mount
Trumbull landscape, Waltz et al. (2003) reconstructed basal
area values ca. 1870 of 4.6–13.8 m2 ha1, whereas Roccaforte
et al. (2009) found landscape averages ca. 1870 of 8.2–
10.9 m2 ha1 and tree densities of 85–109 trees ha1. After
restoration treatments, the post-treatment landscape was inten-
tionally denser than historical conditions, averaging 19.4m2 ha1
and 416 trees ha1. Tree density is a problematic variable for
comparisons, because it is the least precise in reconstructions
(Moore etal. 2004) and numericallydominatedbysmall-diameter
trees that contribute little to basal area or biomass. Therefore, we
focussed on basal area as a relatively stable criterion over time,
familiar to forest managers, and consistently related to above-
ground biomass and carbon.
The original goal of the forest restoration initiative at the
Grand Canyon–Parashant National Monument was to sustain
conditions similar to the range of historical variability (Moore
et al. 2003). Therefore, at the end of the 100-year simulation
period, landscape basal areas within 20% of the minimum
and maximum reconstructed or post-treatment values (range
6.6–23.3 m2 ha1) were considered to represent ‘success’ in
terms of sustainability.
Ponderosa pine trees cut in simulated thinnings were
assessed in terms of wood volume (m3) and sawn wood products
(board-feet). The current market for small-diameter wood pro-
ducts in the south-west is in considerable flux and values depend
on haul distance and geographical area as well as tree diameter.
We approximated the value of wood at a rate of US$17 per m3,
an average of US Forest Service estimates (Waring et al. 2009).
Values are shown in current dollars.
Biomass and carbon measurements
We selected local species-specific aboveground biomass for-
mulae for each tree species and then calculated carbon as 48% of
the total biomass (Kaye et al. 2005). Ponderosa pine allometric
equations for biomass were taken from Kaye et al. (2005).
Gambel oak equations were from Clary and Tiedemann (1987).
The trees at our research site were originally measured at DBH,
so we converted DBH to diameter at root collar (DRC) using a
model from Chojnacky and Rogers (1999). Utah juniper bio-
mass was estimated with the formula from Chojnacky and
Moisen (1993). For pinyon pine, we used models from Grier
et al. (1992), again correcting for DBH measurements with a
formula from Chojnacky and Rogers (1999). We found no

biomass models for New Mexican locust. This species plays an
important ecological role in nutrient cycling (N fixation) and
wildlife habitat, but the plants are small and comprise a negli-
gible percentage of basal area, so the lack of a model minimally
impacts the estimation of overall biomass and carbon on the
landscape.
Results
Forest structure
Future forest structure varied in consistent ways among the
various scenarios of climate, management and regeneration
(Table 2): (1) simulated effects of warming climate consistently
reduced forest density; (2) No-management consistently resul-
ted in the most dense forests, whereas burning resulted in the
least dense forests; and (3) high regeneration scenarios had
higher tree densities – though not necessarily higher basal
areas – than low regeneration scenarios.
Climate scenarios had the greatest impact on the sustain-
ability of treatments over the 100-year simulation period
(Fig. 2). Under the most severe condition, Climate high, only
4 of the 12 management scenarios ended the simulation with
basal area within the target range (6.6–23.3 m2 ha1) using the
Regen low category (Table 2). Seven scenarios had very open
forest savannas, below 6.6 m2 ha1. Only the treatment that
started at the highest density, the No-management Control,
ended up exceeding the target range. Even this treatment
scenario experienced a substantial decline, of 51%, in basal
area over the 100 years. Using the Regen high category, Climate
high still had the lowest basal areas at the end of the simulation
but all were above the minimum target.

Initial basal area (BA) for control was BA ¼ 32.6 m2 ha1, and for treated was BA ¼ 19.4 m2 ha1. The percentage difference from initial BA shows how the
basal area for each scenario varies from the initial BA in percentages. Basal areas are in bold format if they fell within 20% of reconstructed or post-treatment
BA values (range 6.6–23.3 m2 ha1), which we considered ‘successful’ in terms of sustainability (see text)

Fire treatments also had substantial impact, with prescribed
burning treatments in any combination (including Burn þ Thin)
leading to the least dense forests of any scenarios. Averaged
across all climate and regeneration combinations, the burn
treatments resulted in a mean basal area of 12.7 m2 ha1,
compared with a No-management average of 40.5 m2 ha1 and
a Thin-only average of 36.8 m2 ha1. In contrast, thinning alone
had almost negligible impact, with basal area and other forest
structural characteristics ending up nearly indistinguishable
from the No-management treatments (Table 2, Fig. 3). Compar-
ing burning alone with the Burn þ Thin combination in Fig. 3,
there is also almost no difference, indicating that the treatment
effects were due primarily to fire. Burn frequency was impor-
tant. In the Regen low scenario, basal area was 50% lower when
the landscape was burned every 5 years v. every 20 years. Under
Climate high, the difference increased to 70%. Burn season had
almost no impact on the simulation results.
Climate affected the sustainability of management treat-
ments. For example, using the target basal area values (6.6–
23.3 m2 ha1) as a guide to treatment success, restoration of a
5-year burn interval produced a landscape basal area after
100 years averaging 13.6–13.8 m2 ha1 depending on the regen-
eration scenario (Table 2). However, under the Climate high
scenario in Regen low, the 5-year fire interval resulted in a very
open savannah (3.0 m2 ha1) and even the 10-year interval fell
below the target (5.3 m2 ha1), whereas the 20-year interval
maintained forest structure within the appropriate range
(9.9 m2 ha1).
Wood removed
Regeneration scenarios and climate scenarios changed the
amount of wood harvested during the simulation (Table 3).
The restrictions on species thinned (ponderosa pine only) and
maximum size (70 cm DBH) resulted in great variability in
the numbers of trees thinned, ranging from as few as 2.5 to
over 3000 pine trees ha1 (Table 3), but relatively little impact
of thinning treatments on total basal area (Fig. 3). Ponderosa
pine volume removed ranged from ,1900 to over 6300 m3 ha1
in
2048,
the
first
thinning,
and
a
broader
range
of
700–8800 m3 ha1 in 2098, the second thinning entry (Table 3).
Sawn wood products, expressed in board-feet ha1, depend on
the diameter of the material removed, so they did not vary
consistently with thinned volume, expressed in m3 ha1
(Table 3). Revenues from thinned products, in contemporary
dollars, ranged from approximately US$42 to $181 ha1 for
wood cut in 2048, up to a maximum of US$641 ha1 for wood
cut in 2048 under the Regen high condition (Table 4).
Carbon stocks
Changes in carbon (Table 5) paralleled changes in basal area
(Figs 2, 3), with climate, fire treatment, and regeneration sce-
nario having the greatest effects. There was a great range in
aboveground C stocks after 100 years, from a high of
,115 Mg ha1 to a low of 8.4 Mg ha1 (Table 5). Biomass in
both the control and treated areas reached high levels
(180–239 Mg ha1 in the No-management scenarios without
climate change; data not shown), indicating that a lack of
management actions reversed the effects of the original
restoration treatments relatively quickly. Under increasingly
severe climate change, however, the No-management scenarios
were reduced in carbon by as much as 58% compared with the
standard model (Table 5). Oak, pinyon and juniper carbon were
higher in scenarios that did not have burning as a treatment.
Discussion
Simulation reliability and climate impacts
Simulation results should be quite precise – apart from climate
change – because the tree growth models in the FVS variant we
used were developed from sites that are geographically and
edaphically similar to our study area (Edminster et al. 1991).
Modifying FVS variables to reflect the effects of climate change
is inherently more uncertain (Stage 2002), which is why we
analysed two different levels of potential climate impact. As
with any modelling exercise, the relative differences between
different scenarios are probably more reliable indicators than the
actual numbers predicted by the model.
Given this caveat, the simulation results show that climate
effects are the single biggest factor affecting future forest
outcomes. Current conditions (no climate change) are the
No-management control

most favourable for tree growth, leading to extraordinarily
dense forests after 100 years in the absence of management
intervention. Owing to the high loading of continuous fuels
(Fule´ et al. 2004), high likelihood of mortality from forest
pathogens (Breshears et al. 2005; Waring et al. 2009), and
increased probability of drought and severe fire weather in the
coming decades (Westerling et al. 2006; Seager et al. 2007), it is
unlikely that such forests could be sustained for as long as
100 years.
Under current climate, management regimes of frequent
surface fire at 5- or 10-year intervals, similar to the historical
fire patterns (Swetnam and Baisan 1996), would be suitable for
maintaining the effects of the original restoration treatment for
at least a century and presumably indefinitely. This finding is
consistent with our understanding of the long-term effects of the
historical fire regime, which appears to have been in place since
the arrival of the modern vegetation 10 000–12 000 years ago
(Weng and Jackson 1999) and has much longer antecedents in
evolutionary history (Covington 2003).
Climate change effects interact with management regimes,
however, to alter the selection of management strategies for
maintaining restored pine forests. Although considerable uncer-
tainty surrounds the specifics of future forest conditions, the two
climate-related scenarios we used should give an idea of the
extent of relatively moderate and more severe changes.
Under the climate change scenarios, forest density, biomass
and C stocks were all reduced relative to the current condition
scenario. This reduction in potential fuel would counteract
the expected increase in severe fire weather conditions
(McKenzie et al. 2004), suggesting that there may be a balance
point between future fuel availability and future fire weather.
Climate effects amplified the lethal effects of disturbance:
thinning and fire, especially the latter, had more severe impacts
in the climate-stressed forest than under current conditions.
Surface fires at 5- or 10-year intervals served to maintain the
forest under current climate but caused degradation to open
savannah conditions (o6 m2 ha1) under the higher level of
climate change. Fire intervals had to be lengthened to 20 years,
well above the historical south-western average, to have the
desired maintenance effect.
Management scenarios
The No-management scenario showed that without any further
management, a restored forest will return to the same density as
an unrestored forest. This indicates that the initial restoration
treatment was not sufficient in itself to keep a forest in a restored
state. This point had long been recognised by practitioners;
Roccaforte et al. (2009) concluded that the key point of their
study at Mount Trumbull was that the first implementation
of restoration treatments had not ‘restored’ the forest because
ongoing management consistent with historical ecosystem
processes was needed.
The effects of burning and thinning treatments varied with
climate and frequency. Burn seasonality made minimal differ-
ence. There is little research to support or refute the lack of

seasonality impact, even in the case of animals that might be
expected to be seasonally sensitive (Monroe and Converse 2006).
Although thinning products may help offset the cost of
restoration, the cost of thinning is probably higher than can be
recovered from the harvested products. Thinning costs US$750–
1750 ha1 in current dollars (Hjerpe et al. 2009). As thinning
revenues varied widely (Table 4), the best-case scenario might
only lose a few hundred dollars per hectare but the typical
thinning revenues were oUS$100. Note that values are
expressed in current dollars. Future costs and revenues will be
different in absolute values but they are likely to be stable
relative to each other, indicating that future thinning is unlikely
to make a substantial economic contribution to offset main-
tenance treatment costs. Thinning alone did not regulate forest

density under the constraints we imposed and would not re-
establish the ecological role of fire disturbance regimes (Allen
et al. 2002).
Carbon management is an increasingly important goal of
forest conservation, but large amounts of carbon can be lost
owing to wildfire or other sources of mortality (Dore et al. 2008).
The use of prescribed fires will release carbon to maintain
restored sites, but at much lower levels than the sudden increase
of released carbon from wildfires (Hurteau and North 2009),
which are the primary source of unintentional carbon emissions
from forested ecosystems in the western United States (Stephens
2005).Ecologicalrestorationandfueltreatmentsaimtomaintain
carbon stocks in a frequent-fire-adapted forest by making it more
resistant to fire, drought and disease, typically by reducing the
density of small-diameter trees (Covington et al. 1997; Millar
et al. 2007). Our analysis shows that there are several feasible
management strategies to maintain these desirable characteris-
tics in the future, but they are sensitive to climate-change effects.
Under current climate, restoring the historical frequent-fire
regime is sufficient to maintain the open forest conditions found
after restoration treatments at this south-western landscape. If
climate change reduces tree growth and increases mortality,
however, then the superior management strategy shifts to a
lesser-impact regime of more widely spaced fires. This differ-
ence implies two key findings: (1) the management strategies
for conserving treated forests are sensitive to climate change,
so managers should consider basing actions on a combination
of historical reference data and predicted climate effects, and
(2) although it has been widely predicted that future climate
conditionswillsupportmoreburning(warmer,drierfuels,longer
fire season), our modelling suggests that the production of fuels
will decline, so there will eventually be a trade-off between
increased fire driven by climate v. less fuel, also driven by
climate.
