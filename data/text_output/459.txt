This paper adds to the limited knowledge of stand dynamics in pinyon-juniper woodlands by
reporting on the changes in species composition, numbers of trees, arrangements of trees, and
total height and volume in a stand from late 1938 to early 1991. This information should be
helpful in managing pinyon-juniper woodlands to sustain their productivity and maintain their
multiple-use values. The annual increase of 1.2 trees per acre does not reflect the massive
invasion of trees suspected by many people.

Introduction ____________________
Pinyon-juniper woodlands of the southwestern
United States provide wood products, livestock forage,
wildlife habitats, and watershed protection (Aldon
and Shaw 1993; Everett 1987; Gottfried and Pieper
2000; Monsen and Stevens 1999; Shaw and others
1995). Knowledge of how these woodland stands change
in composition and structure promotes understanding
of ecological processes, ensures sustainability of prod-
ucts and amenities, and helps to plan and evaluate
land management activities. Ecologists and land man-
agers also use long-term study results to outline the
development of stands and depict tree and stand
responses to climatic variability and interspecific
competition.
Earlier Studies __________________
Results of only a few long-term studies of the stand
dynamics in the pinyon-juniper woodlands of the
southwestern United States are available. Herman
(1953) and Myers (1962), respectively, reported on 10
and 20 years of growth and mortality in a stand com-
prised mostly of Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma)
trees near Sedona, Arizona. Jameson (1965) described
20 years of total height growth in a stand north of
Flagstaff, Arizona, that was dominated by one-seed
juniper trees J. monosperma (see below). Little (1987)
outlined the growth patterns of individual pinyon
trees for a 47-year period in two stands near Santa Fe,
New Mexico. Conner and others (1990) presented vol-
ume, growth, and mortality estimates of all woodland
types in Arizona from the results of the continuing
forest survey in the State. Gottfried and Ffolliott
(1995) described the dynamics of a 24-year growth
period for two stands dominated by alligator juniper
(J. deppeana) trees on the Beaver Creek watershed in
north-central Arizona.
This paper adds to the existing knowledge of stand
dynamics in the pinyon-juniper woodlands of the
southwestern United States by reporting on changes
in a stand of pinyon and one-seed juniper trees located
on Deadman Flat about 20 miles north of Flagstaff,
Arizona, from late 1938 to early 1991. This is the same
stand upon which Jameson (1965) reported earlier.
Land-Use History of
Deadman Flat___________________
Little is known about the land-use history of the
Deadman Flat area before the early 1850s. Jameson
(1965), in citing Woodhouse (1853), deduced from
reports of the Sitgreaves Expedition to northern Ari-
zona that Deadman Flat was a savanna or open
woodland that was “covered with fine grama grasses
and cedars” at this time. Navajo people herded sheep
in the area from the 1850s until the 1980s. Ranching
by Euro-Americans began in the late 1870s and large
herds of cattle were introduced onto the area in the
early 1880s (Wyllys 1960). The heaviest livestock
grazing likely occurred between the 1890s and 1920s
(Trimble 1982, as cited by Cinnamon 1988). Cinnamon
(1988) suggested that the cool and moist climatic
conditions between the 1890s and 1920s period were
probably “ideal” for the germination of juniper seeds
throughout the region. The earlier heavy livestock
grazing had reduced the cover of competing herba-
ceous plants, providing suitable regeneration niches
for juniper. Reduced frequencies of naturally occur-
ring fire largely because of the fire suppression poli-
cies of the land management agencies also contributed
to successful establishment and subsequent survival
of juniper seedlings at the same time. Jameson (1965)
observed that most of the trees on the Deadman Flat
area were “young” in 1958. It is possible that many of
the trees on Deadman Flat originated from a similar
sequence of climatological and biological events that
resulted in an “abundance” of ponderosa pine regen-
eration in the adjacent, higher-elevation montane
forests in 1919 (Pearson 1950; Schubert 1974). This
being the case, the “young” trees observed by Jameson

(1965) could have been about 40 years old in the late
1950s.
Deadman Flat is part of a USDA Forest Service
grazing allotment on the Coconino National Forest.
This allotment was grazed heavily for short periods in
the summer months by bands of 500 to 800 sheep until
1984. At that time, the rancher holding the allotment
permit converted to a cattle operation, although his
permit allowed both cattle and sheep to graze. How-
ever, no sheep have grazed on the area since the early
1990s. The ranch adjacent to the allotment was bought
by the Navajo Nation in 1986. The general Deadman
Flat area has not been used heavily by livestock since.
There is also little evidence of recent harvesting of
pinyon and juniper trees in area.
Stand Studied __________________
The stand studied is located on an alluvial fan
extending outward from the north side of the San
Francisco Peaks, near Flagstaff, Arizona. Soils on the
site are derived from alluvial or dacite/andesite (Miller
and others 1995) and the underlying bedrock is basalt
that came from volcanic eruptions 20,000 to 200,000
years ago. At the present time, the soil surface compo-
nents are 50 percent rock fragments, 35 percent bare
soil, 10 percent litter, and 5 percent vegetation. The
soils are classified as Typic Argiustolls, loamy skel-
etal, mixed, mesic and, in general, are more than 40
inches deep. The elevation of the site is approximately
6,500 feet, slope is about 2 percent, and the aspect is
northeast.
The site is classified in the Juniperus monosperma/
Bouteloua gracilis habitat type (plant association) by
the USDA Forest Service (1997). This habitat type is
found throughout the southwestern United States
where annual precipitation averages 14 to 16 inches
and winters are relatively cool and dry. An “undis-
turbed plant community” on these sites is generally
open, with individual species canopy covers of 15
percent juniper, 10 percent pinyon, 20 percent blue
grama, and less than 5 percent other species (Miller
and others 1995).
Methods _______________________
A 2-acre plot was established in the stand in Septem-
ber 1938. All of the trees on the plot were numbered
and tagged. Observations and measurements made of
each tree included species, total height, and crown
diameter. These observations and measurements were
repeated at the end of the 1948 and 1958 growing
seasons and at the beginning of the 1991 growing
season. Tally trees that were missing and presumed
dead (mortality) and regeneration (in-growth) were
recorded in 1948, 1958, and 1991. Arrangements of the
tally trees with respect to surrounding trees were
noted at the time of some (but not all) of the observation
and measurement periods. A limited number of re-
peated stem diameter measurements were obtained
on a small sub-sample of trees. The gender of a sub-
sample of the dioecious one-seed juniper trees was
noted in 1991; these trees were considered female if
berries were present and male if berries were absent.
The limited stem diameter measurements precluded
the use of this variable as a basis to estimate indi-
vidual tree volumes from a standard volume table,
which is the common procedure in tree inventories
(Avery and Burkhart 1994; Husch and others 1982). It
was necessary, therefore, to derive estimates of indi-
vidual tree volumes from the succession of total height
measurements taken in 1938, 1948, 1958, and 1991. A
volume table constructed by Howell (1940) for pinyon
and juniper trees in northern Arizona and northern
New Mexico, and reprinted by Barger and Ffolliott
(1972), presents average cubic-foot volumes of indi-
vidual trees in terms of their total height in feet. All
pinyon and juniper species were grouped together into
their respective genera in this volume table. Cubic-
foot volume and total height values from the volume
table were regressed against each other to derive an
equation to estimate individual tree volumes as a
function of the total heights of the tallied trees. A
standard error or other measures of accuracy for this
equation is meaningless because the source data that
Howell used in constructing the original volume table
are not available.
Results and Discussion __________
Species Composition, Numbers of Trees,
Arrangements of Trees
Pinyon trees comprised 25 percent of the woodland
overstory on the 2-acre plot in 1938, 25 percent again
in 1948, 28 percent in 1958, and 36 percent in 1991,
with one-seed juniper trees representing the recipro-
cal proportions. A greater proportion of pinyon trees
were found in the younger age classes in 1991 than in
the earlier observation and measurement periods,
suggesting periods of episodic establishment. There
was little evidence of recent reproduction of one-seed
juniper trees in 1991, and the juniper trees present
appeared to be aging. A greater success of pinyon
establishment relative to juniper trees has been ob-
served throughout the pinyon-juniper woodlands of
the southwestern United States (Barger and Ffolliott
1972). Juniper species are often more common in the
larger size classes of trees. Juniper trees usually
become established first but are often followed and
replaced by pinyon (Gottfried 1992). While birds dis-
perse seeds of both species, pinyon germination is

3
USDA Forest Service Res. Pap. RMRS-RP-35. 2002
greater (about 85 to 95 percent) than most juniper
species; one-seed juniper germination ranges from 20
to 75 percent. However, Gottfried and Ffolliott (1995)
found that there was no significant increase in the
density of pinyon trees in the 24-year growth period
studied, although these authors reported average an-
nual increases of 2.2 alligator juniper and 0.5 Utah
juniper trees per acre.
The total numbers of trees on the plot increased
steadily (if slightly) from 597 trees in 1938 to 639 trees
in 1948, to 678 trees in 1958, to 717 trees in 1991.
These increases translate into an average annual
increase of 1.2 trees per acre over the 50 years. In
terms of species, there were 148 pinyon and 449 one-
seed juniper trees on the plot in 1938. The numbers
were 160 and 479 pinyon and one-seed juniper trees in
1948. There were 188 pinyon and 490 one-seed juniper
trees on the plot in 1958 and 258 pinyon and 459 one-
seed juniper trees in 1991. Average annual increases
of 1.1 pinyon and 0.1 one-seed juniper trees per acre
are reflected by these changes.
Arrangements of trees on the plot in 1991 were largely
the same as the general distribution patterns described
by Jameson (1965). The arrangements included isolated
trees at a distance of 1 tree-height or more from other
trees; small groups of essentially the same-sized trees
with their crowns often intermingling; and smaller
trees becoming established and growing under larger
trees. These arrangements have probably persisted
throughout the half-century even though trees present
through the 50 years increased in their crown vol-
umes, total heights, and diameter. The evolution of
these arrangements through time is illustrated by the
series of photographs presented in figures 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Total Height Growth
Total heights of the pinyon and one-seed juniper
trees on the plot increased steadily throughout the 50
years (table 1). The average annual total height growth
was 0.07 foot and 0.08 foot for pinyon and one-seed
juniper trees, respectively, for the half-century. Little
(1987) measured about 0.09 foot of average annual
total height growth of pinyon trees in his 47-year study
period. The trees sampled by Little were taller at the
start of his study than the pinyon trees on Deadman
Flat in 1938, however. Little did not measure juniper
trees since there only were a few Rocky Mountain
juniper (J. scopulorum) trees on the plot.
Growth in total height of the pinyon and juniper
trees on Deadman Flat is also reflected by the fre-
quency distributions of numbers of trees by total
height classes for the series of measurements in 1938,
1948, 1958, and 1991. As might be expected, the
mode(s) for these frequency distributions continu-
ously shift to the right, indicating the increasing total
height growth of the trees (fig. 5 and 6). It also appears
that these frequency distributions are evolving from a
skewed to more “normal” distributions through time.
Volume Growth
The estimated volume of pinyon trees on the plot
was 6.9 cubic feet in 1938, 11.1 cubic feet in 1948, 14.3
cubic feet in 1958, and 32.0 cubic feet in 1991. The
estimated volume of one-seed juniper trees was greater
for each of the measurements, totaling 43.5 cubic feet
in 1938, 72.2 cubic feet in 1948, 110 cubic feet in 1958,
and 288 cubic feet in 1991. Average annual volume
growth of the pinyon trees was 0.25 cubic foot per acre
for the 50 years, while the corresponding average
annual volume growth of the one-seed juniper trees
was 2.45 cubic feet per acre. Total growth was, there-
fore, 2.70 cubic feet per acre, which is less than that of
“commercial woodlands” in the region.
The estimated average annual volume growth of the
trees on Deadman Flat plot was similar to that re-
ported by Herman (1953) and Myers (1962), who found
(respectively) that the average annual volume growth
of a stand of mostly Utah juniper for 10- and 20-year
growth periods remained unchanged at 2.9 cubic feet
per acre for both periods of measurement. The average
annual volume growth rates on Deadman Flat were
lower than the estimated annual growth rate of 6.4
cubic feet for all Arizona pinyon-juniper woodlands
(Conner and others 1990). However, the growth rates
presented by Conner and others included all pinyon-
juniper and pure juniper woodlands of all age and size
classes on all productivity sites and ownerships.
Gottfried and Ffolliott (1995), in their study of stand
dynamics on the Beaver Creek watershed, reported
average annual growth rates of 0.2 cubic feet per acre
for pinyon trees, 13.5 cubic feet per acre for the domi-
nating alligator juniper, and 3.4 cubic feet per acre for
Utah juniper. However, the alligator juniper trees in
the stands measured by Gottfried and Ffolliott were
much larger than the trees measured on Deadman
Flat, ranging up to 50 inches in stem diameter and 35
feet in height. The Beaver Creek stands sampled also
receive a higher amount of annual precipitation than
Deadman Flat because of their location immediately
below the Mogollon Rim, a major topographic feature
that influences storm activities.
Gender
One-seed juniper are dioecious, that is, berries are
found on female trees and pollen on male trees. Essen-
tially, equal numbers of female and male trees were
observed in 1991. It is believed, therefore, that the one-
seed juniper component of the stand studied on Dead-
man Flat will likely be able to sustain itself into the
future.
Management Implications ________
Information on stand dynamics can help determine
the proper time for harvesting trees for fuel and other
products, predict future stand conditions and silvicul-
tural treatments needed to maintain the production of
forage species, maintain healthy wildlife habitats, and
protect fragile watershed values (Aldon and Shaw
1993; Everett 1987; Gottfried and Pieper 2000; Monsen
and Stevens 1999; Shaw and others 1995). The infor-
mation presented in this paper follows the half-cen-
tury development of a pinyon-juniper woodland stand
from relatively immature trees estimated to be about
20 to 30 years of age into a maturing stand in which the
trees are approaching 80 years of age. The annual
increase of 1.2 trees per acre does not reflect the
“massive invasion” of trees suspected by many people
(Gottfried 1992). The common perception that pinyon-
juniper woodlands are occupying more land might be
related more to the observed increases in crown diam-
eter and total height of existing trees than to an

The Rocky Mountain Research Station develops scientific information
and technology to improve management, protection, and use of the
forests and rangelands. Research is designed to meet the needs of
National Forest managers, Federal and State agencies, public and
private organizations, academic institutions, industry, and individuals.
Studies accelerate solutions to problems involving ecosystems,
range, forests, water, recreation, fire, resource inventory, land reclama-
tion, community sustainability, forest engineering technology, multiple
use economics, wildlife and fish habitat, and forest insects and dis-
eases. Studies are conducted cooperatively, and applications may be
found worldwide.
