2005.—Intense prescribed ﬁre has been suggested as a possible method for forest restoration in mixed conifer
forests. In 1993, a prescribed ﬁre in a dense, never-harvested forest on the North Rim of Grand Canyon National
Park escaped prescription and burned with greater intensity and severity than expected. We sampled this burned
area and an adjacent unburned area to assess ﬁre effects on understory species composition, diversity, and plant
cover. The unburned area was sampled in 1998 and the burned area in 1999; 25% of the plots were resampled
in 2001 to ensure that differences between sites were consistent and persistent, and not due to inter-annual
climatic differences. Species composition differed signiﬁcantly between unburned and burned sites; eight species
were identiﬁed as indicators of the unburned site and thirteen as indicators of the burned site. Plant cover was
nearly twice as great in the burned site than in the unburned site in the ﬁrst years of measurement and was 4.6
times greater in the burned site in 2001. Average and total species richness was greater in the burned site,
explained mostly by higher numbers of native annual and biennial forbs. Overstory canopy cover and duff depth
were signiﬁcantly lower in the burned site, and there were signiﬁcant inverse relationships between these vari-
ables and plant species richness and plant cover. Greater than 95% of the species in the post-ﬁre community
were native and exotic plant cover never exceeded 1%, in contrast with other northern Arizona forests that were
dominated by exotic species following high-severity ﬁres. This difference is attributed to the minimal anthro-
pogenic disturbance history (no logging, minimal grazing) of forests in the national park, and suggests that park
managers may have more options than non-park managers to use intense ﬁre as a tool for forest conservation
and restoration.

After a century or more of ﬁre exclusion in
ecosystems adapted to frequent surface ﬁre re-
gimes, forests in southwestern North America
are increasingly burning in large and severe
wildﬁres (Swetnam and Betancourt 1998). The
response of understory vegetation to severe
burning has been assessed at several sites in Ar-
izona and New Mexico (Pearson et al. 1972,
Beaulieu 1975, Harris and Covington 1983, Os-
wald and Covington 1984, Foxx 1996, Crawford
et al. 2001, Grifﬁs et al. 2001). Earlier studies

focused on productivity of forage species (e.g.,
Oswald and Covington 1984), but more recent
research has expanded to community structure
and dynamics (e.g., Crawford et al. 2001).
Research suggests there is an inverse relation-
ship between disturbance history and post-ﬁre
successional dominance by native species. For-
ests with relatively little disturbance from live-
stock grazing and logging are dominated by na-
tive species following severe ﬁres, but forests
with greater disturbance histories are dominated
by exotic species. For example, native forbs and
grasses dominated the post-ﬁre community after
a 1977 wildﬁre in Bandelier National Monu-
ment, a relatively undisturbed plant community
in northern New Mexico (Foxx 1996). In con-
trast, a comparison of three large wildﬁres in
forests outside of preserves in northern Arizona
found that exotic species (mostly annuals) dom-
inated the post-ﬁre plant communities (Crawford
et al. 2001). Similarly, Grifﬁs et al. (2001) re-
ported that species diversity and abundance in-
creased with higher levels of disturbance but
that the rise in diversity was driven primarily by
exotic species. They concluded that thinning

combined with prescribed burning could posi-
tively affect native species but that high inten-
sity, stand-replacing ﬁres facilitated exotic spe-
cies establishment (Grifﬁs et al. 2001).
The relationship between ﬁre severity and
plant community response is relevant not only
in wildﬁre settings but also for assessing man-
agement actions such as prescribed burning.
Miller and Urban (2000) used ecological simu-
lation modeling in forests of the Sierra Nevada,
California, to suggest that the intentional appli-
cation of intense burning in dense, ﬁre-excluded
stands could result in restoration of historically
open forest structure. This suggestion is of in-
terest because managers of preserves such as na-
tional parks or wilderness areas often face policy
constraints against the use of tree thinning or
other mechanical fuel treatments. However,
whether intense burning would result in forest
‘‘restoration’’ would depend on both tree and
ground-ﬂora responses. In particular, an under-
story community comprised of invasive exotic
species would not be desirable, even if the his-
torically open forest structure was restored.
Testing Miller and Urban’s (2000) hypothesis
would be helpful but experimental application of
intense ﬁre is fraught with risk, so it is very
rarely attempted. However, on September 20,
1993, a 490-ha prescribed ﬁre unit called
‘‘Northwest III’’ was ignited in a mixed conifer
forest in Grand Canyon National Park. Surface
fuels averaged 66 Mg ha21. High winds gusting
up to 48 km hr21 and low humidity led to rela-
tively intense ﬁre behavior, including torching
(ﬁre passing up into canopies of trees) and spot-
ﬁres. The prescribed burn was declared a wild-
ﬁre on September 23 and was suppressed by
September 30 (Nichols et al. 1994). The ﬁre did
not escape the original prescribed ﬁre boundar-
ies but mortality was considered high: the ﬁre
killed approximately 67% of the trees. However,
the post-ﬁre tree density (averaging 331 trees
ha21) and basal area (averaging 28.5 m2 ha21)
were similar to pre-ﬁre-exclusion reference con-
ditions as reconstructed in an adjacent unburned
stand (Fule´ et al. 2004). High mortality of ﬁre-
susceptible species such as Abies concolor re-
stored dominance to the ﬁre-resistant Pinus pon-
derosa (Fule´ et al. 2004).
Recognizing that the Northwest III ﬁre pro-
vided a rare opportunity to examine effects of
intense burning in the relatively undisturbed na-
tional park, we took advantage of the ﬁre to
compare the vegetation in the burned and an ad-
jacent unburned area. We sought to answer the
following questions: 1) How did species com-
position, plant cover, richness, and diversity dif-
fer between unburned and burned sites? 2) Were
invasive exotic species more abundant on the
burned site? 3) What inferences useful to man-
agers—such as the viability of intense burning
as a management technique—could be drawn
from current and projected community charac-
teristics of these sites?
Methods. STUDY SITE. This study was con-
ducted at Swamp Ridge on the North Rim of
Grand Canyon National Park (GCNP) in north-
ern Arizona (Fig. 1). Elevation ranged from
2420 to 2550 m. Soils were classiﬁed as ﬁne,
mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Paleustalfs (A.
Dewall, National Resource Conservation Ser-
vice, personal communication 2002) and were
derived from Kaibab limestone. Dominant tree
species included Pinus ponderosa, Abies con-
color, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Picea engelman-
nii, and Populus tremuloides; common understo-
ry species included Carex siccata, C. rossii, Poa
fendleriana, Fragaria virginiana, Elymus ely-
moides, and Antennaria marginata.

Average annual precipitation at the North Rim
ranger station (elevation 2564 m, approximately
20 km from the study area) is 64.7 cm, with an
average annual snowfall of 356 cm. Tempera-
tures range from an average July maximum of
25.18 C to an average January minimum of
28.28 C (Western Regional Climate Center,
www.wrcc.dri.edu). Mean growing-season pre-
cipitation (May–September) at the North Rim
ranger station was 19.3 cm during the period
1948–2002. In the three sampling years of 1998,
1999, and 2001, growing-season precipitation
totaled 22.4 cm, 32.2 cm, and 12.3 cm, respec-
tively, amounting to 116%, 167%, and 64% of
the long-term average.
Surface ﬁre regimes at Swamp Ridge were in-
terrupted in 1879 (Fule´ et al. 2003). Prior to
1880, ﬁre return intervals averaged 5.1 years for
all ﬁres and 8.7 years for ﬁres scarring 25% or
more of the sample trees, which are assumed to
be larger ﬁres. No post-1879 ﬁre was recorded
on the site in ﬁre scars or in park records, except
for a ﬁre scarring a single sample tree in 1954
(Fule´ et al. 2003).
These forests have never been commercially
harvested (Warren et al. 1982). Evidence exists
for limited livestock grazing on the Kaibab Pla-
teau as early as 1871 (Woodbury 1944) and sig-
niﬁcant cattle grazing by 1885 (Rasmussen
1941). However, cattle and sheep grazing essen-
tially ceased in GCNP in the mid-1930s, when
a fence was built along the northern boundary
of the park to exclude domestic animals.
DATA COLLECTION. Study sites were selected
in the geographic center of the burned site and
an adjacent unburned site, 270 ha each, separat-
ed by a road. Sixty plots were sampled on a
systematic 300 3 300 m grid; thirty plots oc-
curred in each of the unburned and burned sites
(Fig. 1). Because of the logistical difﬁculties in
supporting a research crew at these remote areas,
the unburned site was sampled in 1998 and the
burned site was sampled in 1999. Eight plots in
the unburned site and seven plots in the burned
site were remeasured in 2001 to determine if the
observed differences between the sites were
consistent and persistent and not merely due to
inter-annual climatic differences, which have
been shown to have substantial effects on plant
productivity and community composition in this
region (Gildar et al. 2004, Fule´ et al. 2002b,
Korb et al. 2003). Remeasured plots were se-
lected on the basis of aspect, slope, and distance
from the road to adequately represent the het-
erogeneity of the landscape. The invasive exotic
species Bromus tectorum L. was also a focus of
the remeasurement. We remeasured plots in the
burned site where it was previously recorded
and plots in the unburned site where it was not
previously recorded but where the species might
be likely to expand (e.g., closer to the road;
Schmidt 1989).
Sampling plots were 0.1 ha (20 3 50 m) in
size, with the 50 m sides oriented uphill-down-
hill to maximize variability along the elevational
gradient. Belt and point intercept transects were
used to sample plant cover and distribution (Na-
tional Park Service 1992). Complete species lists
were collected in two 10 3 50 m belt transects
per plot. Each species occurred on zero, one, or
two belt transects per plot; these data were used
for the analysis of community, functional group,
and species responses.
A 50 m point-line intercept transect was es-
tablished in the center of each belt transect, and
species presence and forest ﬂoor substrates (soil,
litter, rock, wood) were recorded at a point every
30 cm along each transect (166 points per tran-
sect). We summed the data from the two tran-
sects per plot, yielding a total of 332 points per
plot. Cover estimates for each species and sub-
strate were calculated by dividing the number of
points containing that attribute by the total num-
ber of points on both transects (Barbour et al.
1999). All vascular plant species shorter than
breast height (1.37 m tall), including trees and
shrubs, were included in the analysis. Calcula-
tions of Shannon’s H9 diversity index used point
intercept data. Overstory canopy cover was
measured by vertical projection (Ganey and
Block 1994) at each point intercept location.
Forest ﬂoor characteristics, including litter (Oi),
duff (Oe 1 Oa), were measured on four perma-
nent 15.24 m planar transects per plot using the
method outlined in Brown (1974). The litter lay-
er was composed of freshly fallen organic ma-
terial, and the duff layer was the combined fer-
mentation and humus layers located between the
litter layer and mineral soil. Forest structure and
fuel loads of the study sites are reported by Fule´
et al. (2004).
NOMENCLATURE. Plant nomenclature follows
USDA-NRCS PLANTS Database (2004). We
lumped species to the generic level when vege-
tative characteristics were insufﬁcient to warrant
a species-level identiﬁcation. The comparison of
nativity in post-ﬁre communities is complicated
by the taxonomically poor-deﬁned distinction

between Chenopodium album, considered an ex-
otic species by Crawford et al. (2001), and the
native broad-leaved Chenopodium species. Four
species of broad-leaved Chenopodium can occur
in our study area: the native C. berlandieri, C.
fremontii, and C. incanum, and the exotic C. al-
bum var. album. Plasticity in the vegetative mor-
phology and hybridization makes reliable iden-
tiﬁcation impossible in the absence of mature
fruits (Welsh 1984, Welsh et al. 1993) and hy-
bridization further complicates identiﬁcation
(Ruas et al. 1999). We chose to combine these
species at the generic level and take a conser-
vative approach by considering them native. It
should be recognized that some exotic Cheno-
podium species may be occurring on our plots,
but were included with the native species. For
all other species, we follow the USDA-NRCS
PLANTS Database (2004) classiﬁcation of plant
nativities.
DATA ANALYSIS. This study used a ‘refer-
ence-impact’ design to examine the impact of
the ﬁre on the vegetation of the site (van Mant-
gem et al. 2001). The scope of statistical infer-
ence is narrow because this study is a single-site
burn/no-burn comparison, and the measurement
plots are pseudoreplicates (Hurlbert 1984). As-
sessment of ﬁre effects is based on the assump-
tion that the unburned and burned sites were
similar before burning, since no pre-ﬁre data ex-
ist. However, we feel this assumption is reason-
able in light of the close proximity, similar to-
pography (Fig. 1), and shared management his-
tory of the sites.
We used non-metric multi-dimensional scal-
ing (MDS) to illustrate differences in commu-
nity composition among sites and years (Clarke
1993). Non-metric MDS ordinations were con-
ducted using PC-ORD software (version 4.25;
McCune and Mefford 1999). Non-metric MDS
arranges the plots in a conﬁguration that mini-
mizes the inter-plot distances (stress). We used
the Bray-Curtis distance measure with random
starting conﬁgurations, 100 runs with real data,
a maximum of 400 iterations per run, and a sta-
bility criterion of 0.00001. A Monte Carlo test
with 100 randomizations was used to determine
how likely the observed stress value of the ﬁnal
solution would be by chance alone. Species that
occurred on less than 5% of the plots were omit-
ted from the ordination but all 112 species were
included in the analysis of species richness
(McCune and Grace 2002). Omitted species in-
cluded two exotics: Cirsium vulgare and Tra-
gapogon dubious.
We used a distance-based multivariate analy-
sis of variance in DISTLM software (version
2.0; Anderson 2003) to compare species com-
position and forest ﬂoor substrates. This soft-
ware permits the analysis of multivariate data
using any distance measure and linear model
and requires no assumptions about the distribu-
tional form of the data. The calculated statistic
is termed a ‘pseudo-F’ and is calculated in a
similar fashion as a traditional F-statistic, as the
sum of the squared distances among groups di-
vided by the sum of the squared distances within
groups (see Anderson [2001] and McArdle and
Anderson [2001] for details). Data were untrans-
formed and unstandardized. Dissimilarities were
calculated using the Bray-Curtis distance mea-
sure, which is appropriate for most ecological
data (Faith et al. 1987). P-values were calculated
by permuting the observations 9999 times. We
compared community composition of unburned
and burned sites with data from 1998 and 1999,
respectively, and also with data collected in
2001.
We identiﬁed four categories for our analysis
of functional groups: annual and biennial forbs,
perennial forbs, graminoids, and woody species.
Shrubs and tree seedlings below breast height
were combined in the woody category due to
low numbers of each. One fern (Pteridium aquil-
inum) and two subshrubs (Mahonia repens and
Paxistima myrsinites) were included in the pe-
rennial forb category.
Univariate analyses of community and forest
structural characteristics (e.g., species richness,
plant cover, fuel depths) were made using the
nonparametric Wilcoxon 2-sample test as our
data did not meet assumptions of normality or
equal variances. We compared unburned and
burned sites with data collected in 1998 and
1999, respectively, and also with data collected
in 2001. We used the 15 remeasured plots to
compare differences in rates of change of com-
munity characteristics between unburned and
burned plots. Since post-ﬁre data were collected
in 1998, 1999 and 2001, the repeated measures
analysis compares rates of change of variables
between post-ﬁre years 5–8 in the unburned site
and post-ﬁre years 6–8 in the burned site. Since
these involved univariate response variables, the
dissimilarities between measurement dates were
the differences between the two values for each
plot (Green 1993); Wilcoxon 2-sample tests

were used to compare the rate of change be-
tween sites.
We used the Indicator Species Analysis (Duf-
reˆne and Legendre 1997) routine in PC-ORD to
identify individual plant species associated with
the unburned or burned sites. This analysis was
performed on data collected in the ﬁrst years of
measurement. We restricted our attention to spe-
cies with P , 0.05 (assessed using Monte Carlo
randomizations with 10000 permutations) and
Indicator Values (INDVAL) . 25. Since IND-
VAL is the product of the relative abundance
and relative frequency of a species, a species
could have an INDVAL of 25 if, for example,
it occurred on 50% of the plots in a group and
had a relative abundance of at least 50% in that
group (Dufreˆne and Legendre 1997). Species-
accumulation curves were also generated in PC-
ORD.
We used linear regression (JMP IN 2002) to
examine the relationships between understory
variables such as species richness and plant cov-
er and forest structural variables such as duff
depth and canopy cover. Duff depths (cm) were
natural log (ln) transformed for regression anal-
ysis to improve model ﬁt.
Results. UNDERSTORY COMMUNITY. A total of
112 plant species were identiﬁed across all sites
and years. The analysis of community compo-
sition focused on the 66 species that occurred on
at least 5% of the plots. Species composition
differed signiﬁcantly between treatments in the
ﬁrst years of measurement (pseudo-F 5 15.2, P
, 0.001) and the differences persisted in 2001
(pseudo-F 5 8.2, P , 0.001). The non-metric
MDS ordination illustrates the clear composi-
tional difference between unburned and burned
plots in both years of measurement (Fig. 2).
The Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) identi-
ﬁed eight indicators of the unburned site and 13
indicators of the burned site (Table 1). While
most species occurred on both sites at varying
abundances and frequencies, ﬁve species indic-
ative of the burned site were absent from the
unburned site: Pseudognaphalium macounii,
Chenopodium spp., Taraxacum ofﬁcinale, Bro-
mus tectorum, and Houstonia wrightii. One in-
dicator of the unburned site (Kellogia galioides)
was absent from the burned site.
Species richness was signiﬁcantly greater in
the burned site in both comparison periods (Ta-
ble 2). This resulted primarily from more annual
and biennial forbs and graminoids in the burned
site in both comparison periods (Table 2). Three
indicator species of the burned site were native
annuals: Pseudognaphalium macounii, Cheno-
podium spp., and Gayophytum diffusum. Bromus
tectorum was the only indicator species of the
burned site that was a grass. We detected a total
of 75 species in the unburned site and 96 species
in the burned site across all years of measure-
ment. Species-accumulation curves illustrate
that more species were detected per area sam-
pled in the burned area than in the unburned
area; standard deviations of the curves do not
overlap if an area . 1.5 ha was sampled (Fig.
3). Plant diversity, measured as Shannon’s H9
index, was also signiﬁcantly greater in the
burned site in the ﬁrst years of measurement
(Table 2) but was marginally not signiﬁcant (P
5 0.056) in 2001, likely due to the reduced sam-
ple size. Plant cover was nearly twice as great
in the burned site than in the unburned site in
the ﬁrst years of measurement and was 4.6 times
greater in the burned site in 2001 (Table 2).
Repeated measurements indicated that plant
cover increased signiﬁcantly more in the burned
site (mean change 5 113% cover) compared to
the unburned site (mean change 5 25% cover)
between measurement dates (Z 5 2.8, P ,
0.004). Species richness increased at a margin-
ally greater rate in the burned site (mean in-
crease 5 7.3 species) compared to the unburned
site (mean increase 5 1.3 species) (Z 5 1.8, P

5 0.071). Changes over time in plant diversity
did not differ between unburned and burned
sites (Z 5 20.6, P 5 0.524).
Only four exotic species were recorded: Bro-
mus tectorum, Cirsium vulgare, Taraxacum of-
ﬁcinale, and Tragopogon dubius. In the ﬁrst
years of measurement, both unburned and
burned sites had low percentages of exotic spe-
cies (,3%) and low exotic species richness (,
1 exotic per plot) (Table 2). The percentage of
exotic species differed signiﬁcantly in 2001 be-
cause the remeasured unburned plots contained
zero exotic species; 5% of the species on the
burned plots in 2001 were exotic. Exotic species
richness increased to 1.9 per plot in 2001, due
mostly to a few occurrences of Cirsium vulgare
and Tragopogon dubius. Exotic plant cover was
greatest in the burned site in both years of mea-
surement, but never exceeded 1% in either site
(Table 2). Repeated measurements indicated that
the percentage of exotic species increased more
in the burned site (mean change 5 11%) than
the unburned site (mean change 5 23%) be-
tween measurement dates (Z 5 2.2, P 5 0.031),
but exotic plant cover did not increase more at
the burned site (Z 5 0.5, P 5 0.630).
CANOPY COVER AND FUEL LOAD. Forest ﬂoor
substrates were signiﬁcantly different between
sites in the ﬁrst years of measurement (pseudo-
F 5 24.8, P , 0.001). In the burned site litter
cover was lower, bare soil cover was higher, and
wood cover was lower than in the unburned site
(Table 3). In 2001, substrate cover was not sig-
niﬁcantly different (pseudo-F 5 2.9, P 5 0.068),
so comparisons of individual substrates were not
warranted.
Overstory canopy cover was signiﬁcantly
greater in the unburned site at both measurement
dates (Table 3). Annual and biennial forb species
richness, graminoid species richness, and plant
cover were inversely related to canopy cover
(Fig. 4).
Forest ﬂoor fuel depths were signiﬁcantly dif-

ferent between the unburned and burned sites.
Litter depth was marginally lower, duff depth
was 2.8 times greater, and the duff:litter ratio
was 4.2 times greater in the unburned site (Table
3). Annual and biennial forb species richness,
graminoid species richness, and plant cover
were inversely related to duff depth (Fig. 4).
Multiple regression indicated that duff depth
(P 5 0.009) and canopy cover (P , 0.001) were
both signiﬁcant in explaining the variation in an-
nual and biennial forb richness (adjusted r2 5
0.59). However, multiple regression indicated
that the variation of graminoid richness was best
explained by duff depth alone, and the variation
in plant cover was best explained by canopy
cover alone.
Discussion. COMMUNITY RESPONSE. Since com-
positional differences between the unburned and
burned sites were consistent and persistent, the dif-
ferences were most likely due to the intense pre-
scribed ﬁre and not due to inter-annual climatic
differences. Species composition of severely
burned sites measured by Crawford et al. (2001)
were also distinct from unburned communities
several years after ﬁre.
The compositional differences between the
unburned and burned sites largely resulted from
differences among indicator species. Some in-
dicator species of the unburned forest have pre-
viously been observed to be ﬁre intolerant. For
example, Goodyera repens, a close relative of

1 Results of multivariate tests of substrates were not signiﬁcant for data collected in 2001; therefore, univariate
tests of substrates in 2001 are not reported. Percentages do not add up to 100 since a few minor substrates are
omitted from discussion.
2 Forest ﬂoor fuels and canopy cover were not measured in 2001; also reported in Fule´ et al. (2004).
G. oblongifolia, is usually killed by ﬁre (Kreft-
ing and Ahlgren 1974). Abies concolor saplings
are often killed by ﬁre (Thomas and Agee 1986)
and regeneration of A. concolor seedlings was
less dense in the burned areas (Fule´ et al. 2004),
likely because of the open canopy (Barbour et
al. 1990). Mahonia repens was absent following
high-intensity ﬁres in Idaho (Armour et al. 1984)
but is thought to be resistant to moderate ﬁres
(McLean 1968, Armour et al. 1984). Pteridium
aquilinum is also usually favored by moderate
ﬁres, but its rhizomes can be killed in intense
ﬁres (Flinn and Pringle 1983).
Several indicator species of the burned site
have previously been reported to increase after
ﬁre. Ceanothus fendleri sprouts after ﬁre and
seeds have higher germination success if they
are heated (Huffman 2003). Taraxacum ofﬁcin-
ale responds favorably to disturbances and in-
creased after a ﬁre in Montana (Eichhorn and
Watts 1984). The exotic annual Bromus tecto-
rum is known to invade burned areas in Arizona
(Crawford et al. 2001) and Chamerion angusti-
folium is well-known as a strong colonizer after
severe ﬁres (Bartos and Mueggler 1981, Armour
et al. 1984). Rubus idaeus regeneration from
seeds was most vigorous in severe burns in the
Black Hills (Bock and Bock 1984) and it also
sprouts readily from belowground structures that
are protected from heat (Johnson and Woodward
1985).
The greater abundance and diversity of un-
derstory plants in the burned site was related to
the opening of the tree canopy and reduction of
duff by ﬁre. Plant cover and species richness
remained higher in the burned site in 2001 in-
dicating that climatic differences in the two sam-
pling years did not signiﬁcantly affect these var-
iables. The burned site had a lower mean basal
area (28.5 vs. 41.3 m2 ha21; Fule´ et al. 2004)
and lower mean canopy cover (30 vs. 63%) than
the unburned site. The inverse relationship be-
tween annual and biennal forb richness, grami-
noid richness, and plant cover with overstory
canopy cover likely results from the greater light
availability, water yield, and nutrient availability
found with reduced tree cover (Brown 1976,
Ffolliott and Gottfried 1989, Gottfried 1989,
Naumburg and Dewald 1999). Moreover, in
ponderosa pine forests, forage production gen-
erally increases with decreasing stand density
(Moore and Deiter 1992). We also found that
reduced duff depth following ﬁre strongly af-
fected the understory plant community. Annual
and biennial forb species richness were related
to both duff depth and canopy cover. However,
the variation of graminoid species richness is ex-
plained mostly by duff depth and the variation
of plant cover is explained mostly by canopy
cover. Other studies have also detected negative
relationships between duff depth and species
richness (Laughlin et al. 2004, in review).
EXOTIC SPECIES. In the ﬁre-adapted forests of
northern Arizona, native and exotic ruderals of-
ten establish quickly following moderate to
high-intensity ﬁres (Crawford et al. 2001). How-
ever, this study demonstrates that an intensely

burned mixed conifer forest on the North Rim
contained high numbers of native annuals and
biennials and relatively few exotics. Moreover,
native annuals also increased after a low-inten-
sity wildﬁre in a nearby ponderosa pine forest
on the North Rim (Laughlin et al. 2004).
The exotic species were present only in the
burned site. Exotic species richness 0.1 ha21 in-
creased from 0.9 to 1.9 between 1999 and 2001
in the burned site, but exotics were never abun-
dant (, 1% of plant cover) in either year of
measurement. This contrasts with the ﬁndings of
Crawford et al. (2001) who reported 26 exotic
species totaling 116% cover in high severity
burn plots. However, if Crawford et al. (2001)
had treated Chenopodium album as a native,
their ﬁndings of exotic species would have been
reduced to 25 exotic species totaling 77% cover
in high severity burn plots. If we had treated
Chenopodium spp. as an exotic, the occurrence
of exotics would have been more widespread
throughout the burn, but exotic plant cover
would have remained very low (, 1%). Irre-
spective of the treatment of the Chenopodium,
therefore, the post-ﬁre North Rim plant com-
munities were much more strongly dominated
by natives than were other northern Arizona for-
ests with a history of recent human-caused dis-
turbance (Grifﬁs et al. 2001, Crawford et al.
2001). The relatively undisturbed North Rim site

2005]
599
HUISINGA ET AL.: FIRE IN MIXED CONIFER FOREST
serves as a rare example in northern Arizona
where native plants are the primary colonizers
following an intense ﬁre. A few other ecosys-
tems responded similarly: Keeley et al. (2003)
observed low exotic richness (3.4%) in post-ﬁre
conifer forests of the Sierra Nevada, but exotic
richness was still greater in burned than un-
burned forests, and Greenberg et al. (1995) ob-
served recovery of native species assemblages
after high-intensity ﬁres in sand pine scrub for-
ests located in Florida. Presumably, native spe-
cies have always recovered in ecosystems adapt-
ed to high-severity ﬁre (e.g., lodgepole pine,
chapparal), but the recent increase in exotic spe-
cies has allowed exotics to dominate post-ﬁre
recovery in many ecosystems.
Exotics may expand their dominance in the
burned site, however. Bromus tectorum is one of
the most invasive exotics in western North
America and it is found in forests and grasslands
in northern Arizona. We recorded B. tectorum
on 40% of plots in the burned site, but its av-
erage cover per plot was , 1%. The species has
the potential to increase and inﬂuence the ﬁre
regime, thereby altering forest structure and un-
derstory composition. In a sagebrush ecosystem
in Idaho, Whisenant (1990) reported that areas
infested with B. tectorum burned more frequent-
ly than native grassland ecosystems. If native
shrubs and perennial grasses fail to recover
quickly, B. tectorum could colonize large areas
and affect the ﬁre regime (Whisenant 1990).
While there is no evidence that B. tectorum-sup-
ported ﬁres could adversely affect the ﬁre-adapt-
ed plant community in ponderosa pine and
mixed conifer forests at GCNP, continued mon-
itoring is warranted.
FUTURE MANAGEMENT. Historically, the high-
elevation forests on Swamp Ridge were open
and dominated by old-growth Pinus ponderosa.
Since the onset of ﬁre exclusion in 1880, ﬁre-
intolerant tree species such as Abies concolor
have increased dramatically, causing forest den-
sities to increase to unusually high levels (Fule´
et al. 2004). The intense ﬁre reduced tree den-
sities and basal area to levels similar to preset-
tlement reference conditions (Fule´ et al. 2004)
and the understory vegetation responded to the
dramatic changes. However, future patterns of
vegetation change depend primarily on oversto-
ry structure and forest ﬂoor fuel depths. Estab-
lishment and growth of trees in the burned site
may soon have substantial effects on the under-
story. Fule´ et al. (2004) found an average of
6834 seedlings or sprouts ha21 in the burn, most-
ly Abies concolor (53%) and Populus tremulo-
ides (31%). Using a forest simulation model to
project future stand development, tree basal area
in the burned site was forecast to be indistin-
guishable from that of the unburned site within
50 years (; 43 m2 ha21) (Fule´ et al. 2004). Re-
establishment of dense forest cover would pre-
sumably result in a reduction in understory plant
richness, diversity, and cover to levels compa-
rable to the unburned site.
Management strategies could be implemented
to affect the development of canopy species and
the understory community. First, prescribed
burning may be used to maintain the open forest
canopy in the burned site. This option was sup-
ported by simulation modeling showing that sur-
face ﬁres at 15-year intervals would forestall in-
creases in tree basal area and maintain forest
structural characteristics similar to those found
in this area prior to ﬁre exclusion (ca. 1880; Fule´
et al. 2002, 2004). The combination of an open
forest canopy and a diverse, productive under-
story of native plants would lend support to
Miller and Urban’s (2000) suggestion that eco-
logical restoration can be achieved through the
use of relatively intense ﬁre. However, we urge
caution when extrapolating these results to other
forest types in other regions of the western Unit-
ed States since this was a single, unreplicated
example of understory development after an in-
tense ﬁre. Second, managers could apply wild-
land ﬁre management techniques such as ‘‘burn-
ing out’’ of fuels (intentional ignition of fuels
adjacent to a control line) (Farnsworth 2001)
with relatively strong conﬁdence that post-burn
native plant communities would be productive
and diverse. In contrast, Crawford et al. (2001)
cautioned managers about burning in non-park
forests where invasive plants could colonize.
This contrast illustrates that while management
activities are often constrained by policy in pre-
serves compared to multiple-use forests, the
greater ecological integrity of preserves may ex-
pand the options available to managers. We do
not intend to suggest that relatively intense burn-
ing is necessarily suitable as an intentional prac-
tice at Grand Canyon or similar forests. But
managers are likely to need some degree of ﬂex-
ibility to respond to the major threat facing these
ecosystems: forest disturbances are expected to
increase in severity and to interact in novel ways
due to climate change (Flannigan et al. 2000,
Dale et al. 2001). As severe large-scale ﬁres
continue to occur in the forests of southwestern

600
[VOL. 132
JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY
North America, forests such as those of GCNP
are more likely to maintain the biological legacy
of native plant communities in the face of shift-
ing forest distributions (Shafer et al. 2001). Per-
petuation of these ecosystems through frequent
prescribed burning and other conservation activ-
ities such as control of exotic species should be
a high priority.
