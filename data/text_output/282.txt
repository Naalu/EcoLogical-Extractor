ABSTRACT Fire-adapted forests in the western United States have dramatically departed from the natural
or evolutionary environment over the past century because of ﬁre suppression, logging, grazing, and other
management practices. In particular, most southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests are
characterized by dense stands of small-diameter trees that are susceptible to stand-replacing crown ﬁres and
ensuing damage to watersheds, wildlife habitat, and communities at the wildland-urban interface.
Restoration treatments using mechanical thinning and prescribed ﬁre have become the dominant
management paradigm in this forest type, with landscape-scale projects being implemented over the next 20
years. Although many studies have examined wildlife responses to restoration treatments, single-species
information is difﬁcult for managers to synthesize and incorporate into management decisions made at large
scales. Our goal was to investigate responses of breeding birds in ponderosa pine forests to forest stand
characteristics modiﬁed by restoration treatments. We sampled birds in 23 stands for 3 years in northern
Arizona, and used multi-season and multi-species occupancy models to determine relationships between
avian occupancy and stand attributes affected by treatment. Increasing occupancy rates and species richness
were associated with decreasing canopy cover, increasing density of mature trees, and increasing density of
snags. Occupancy rates and species richness were negatively associated with quadratic mean diameter,
medium-sized trees, and downed woody material. Associations of the avian community and individual
species with herbaceous cover and tree clumping were less consistent. Our results support the implementation
of forest restoration treatments for restoring avian community occupancy in ponderosa pine forests, and
emulating the evolutionary environment is likely the best approach. We recommend reducing canopy cover
via thinning, and retaining trees >45.7 cm diameter at breast height and snags. A commonly-proposed
diameter cap for retaining large trees after thinning (40.6 cm dbh) seems unlikely to beneﬁt nesting
passerines, as resulting tree densities would remain too large. We recommend occupancy modeling as an
efﬁcient method for assessing wildlife-habitat relationships at large scales.  2013 The Wildlife Society.

In the western United States, over 12 million hectares of
conifer forest have co-adapted with ﬁre over a >10,000-year
period (Covington 2003). Prior to Euro-American settle-
ment (hereafter presettlement, ca. 1890), frequent ﬁres were
the dominant disturbance regime, exerting a strong inﬂuence
on forest structure and ecosystem function. In southwestern
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests, low-intensity ﬁres
occurred at a 2–25-year return interval (Moore et al. 1999),
maintaining a largely open, patchy forest dominated by
mature trees and well-developed herbaceous understory
(Covington and Moore 1994, Waltz et al. 2003). Because
of the patchy spatial and temporal nature of ﬁre, ponderosa
pine trees often grew in uneven-aged clumps (Cooper 1961,
White 1985), and snags and downed wood were unevenly
distributed on the landscape (Knapp et al. 2005). Following a
century of ﬁre suppression, logging, and grazing, ponderosa
forests exhibit conditions outside their natural range of
variability (Cooper 1960, Covington and Moore 1994,
Swetnam et al. 1999). Contemporary ponderosa pine and
pine-oak forests are characterized by homogenous, dense
stands
dominated
by
small-diameter
trees,
conditions
that facilitate uncharacteristically large and intense stand-
replacing crown ﬁres (Fule´ et al. 1997, Abella and Fule´ 2008).
To reduce threat of wildﬁre, ecological restoration projects
are being implemented in these forest ecosystems. Treat-
ments typically include the use of mechanical thinning and
burning to reduce heavy fuel loads, followed by regular
application of prescribed ﬁre to approximate the natural ﬁre
regime (Moore et al. 1999, 2006b). These treatments are also
designed to restore ecosystem function, by increasing rates of

decomposition and nutrient cycling, water availability,
carbon storage, plant biodiversity, and populations of native
wildlife species (Allen et al. 2002, Finkral and Evans 2008,
Boerner et al. 2009, Schwilk et al. 2009). Understanding
treatment effects is particularly important as restoration
efforts are implemented at increasingly larger scales (West-
erling et al. 2006). For example, the 2010 Collaborative
Forest Landscape Restoration Project (Omnibus Public
Land Management Act 2009) supports restoration on 9
National Forests across the western United States at scales of
10,000s of hectares. One such project, the Four Forests
Restoration Initiative, will treat >400,000 ha of ponderosa
pine and pine–oak forest in Arizona alone.
Post-European
settlement
changes
in
southwestern
forests have signiﬁcant implications for breeding songbirds,
which use a variety of patch types and microhabitats for
nesting and foraging. Quantitative studies of avian com-
munities in these forests are relatively recent, so our
understanding of presettlement avian communities is limited
at best (Block et al. 1997). Similarly, studies of avian
responses to forest management have largely focused on
silvicultural treatments and commercial harvest (Finch
et al. 1997, Kalies et al. 2010). Few studies have explicitly
examined avian community responses to restoration treat-
ments (but see Gaines et al. 2007, 2010). Until large-scale,
replicated experimental studies are conducted, inferences
concerning avian responses to post-settlement changes in
forest structure and inversely, restoration, can be derived
from extant information on habitat relationships (Block
et al. 1997).
We used an extensive, pre-restoration data set to assess
avian responses to stand attributes affected by restoration
treatments such as tree density, size, and spacing. Because
breeding birds in ponderosa pine forests exploit distinct
niches (Szaro and Balda, 1979a), we expected both positive
and negative associations with alteration of stand structure.
We hypothesized that most species would respond positively
to attributes characteristic of presettlement forests, for
example, open canopy, mature and old-growth trees,
clumped tree distribution, large snags, and a well-developed
herbaceous understory. We also evaluated 1 stand attribute
prominent in current debates over forest restoration practices
in the Southwest: the density of large, non old-growth trees.
The presumed scarcity and ecological importance of such
trees has spurred calls for diameter caps that prohibit cutting
of live trees above a certain diameter (typically >40.6 cm)
during thinning operations (Allen et al. 2002, Abella et al.
2006). Our speciﬁc objectives were to 1) quantify the
inﬂuence of treatment-affected stand attributes on occupan-
cy rates of individual species and on species richness; and
2) derive inferences from these relationships to inform future
restoration of ponderosa pine forests.
STUDY AREA
We sampled avian communities and forest structural
characteristics at 23 randomly-selected stands in northern
Arizona, which represented existing, pre-restoration con-
ditions within ponderosa pine and ponderosa pine–Gambel
oak (Quercus gambelii) forest cover types (Fig. 1). Stands in
the ponderosa pine cover type had overstory composed of
ponderosa pine and herbaceous understory dominated by
grasses, primarily Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica) and blue
grama (Bouteluoa gracilis). Pine–oak stands also had a well-
developed Gambel oak component that included shrub-like
clumps of smaller plants and trees of varying sizes (Rosen-
stock 1998). Per current United States Forest Service criteria,
stands were classiﬁed as pine–oak if >10% of tree basal area
was comprised of oaks >13 cm in diameter, measured at root
collar. Most stands were managed for commercial timber
production and had received prior pre-commercial thinning
or tree harvest by single-tree selection, group selection,
patch-cut, or shelterwood methods. Prescribed ﬁre was
commonly applied to reduce woody debris following harvest
or thinning treatments. Three stands were research or natural
areas not managed for timber production that had a history
of natural or prescribed ﬁre. Each stand was 40 ha in size
and had no silvicultural treatment or ﬁre for 5 years prior to
the study.
METHODS
Data Collection
Within each stand, we randomly placed a 2  4 rectangular
grid of sampling points spaced 200 m apart, for a total of 184
points in the 23 stands. We conducted bird sampling at the
point scale, which is appropriate to the home range size of
focal organisms, and also to capture the considerable within-
stand variability in forest structure. We used a differentially-
correcting global positioning system (GPS) receiver to obtain
Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates of each
point. We surveyed each point for birds 3 per year, once by
each of 3 observers, between 1 June and 31 July, from 1993 to
1995. Surveys occurred during a 3-hour period beginning 30
minutes after sunrise, but not during periods of strong wind
or rain. Upon arriving at a point, the observer waited for 3
minutes, and then conducted an 8-minute count of all birds
seen or heard within a 100-m radius. We did not count birds
ﬂying overhead or detected between points.
We tallied live trees and measured their diameter at breast
height in 3, non-overlapping, 0.1-ha circular subplots, 1
centered on the point, the others randomly placed within a
100-m radius. We sampled tree spacing in each subplot,
measuring distance from the live tree closest to plot center to
the nearest live tree in each of the 4 cardinal directions. We
counted all snags within a 100-m radius of the point,
excluding those unlikely to provide nesting substrate
(<20 cm dbh, displaced >458 from a vertical position, or
having extensive ﬁre char and exterior hardening). We
sampled understory vegetation and downed woody material
at 100-point intercepts, spaced 0.5 m apart on 2 perpendic-
ular transects centered on the point. We measured canopy
cover of live trees using a spherical densiometer (Strickler
1959), collecting 5 measurements within each 0.1-ha circular
plot, 1 at plot center, and 1 along each of the 4 transect radii
15 m from the center.

Data Analysis
We used an occupancy modeling framework that allowed
robust estimation of probability of occupancy by individual
species, given a suite of covariates expected to inﬂuence
habitat suitability and detectability during repeated surveys
(MacKenzie et al. 2006). For each point, we quantiﬁed
overstory and understory characteristics using variables
commonly used to describe stand structure and that

We
diagnosed
univariate correlations using a Pearson correlation matrix,
and omitted variables correlated at >0.60. The remaining
variables used in our analysis (hereafter, habitat covariates;
Table 1) included percent canopy cover of ponderosa pine
(canopy cover); ponderosa pine quadratic mean diameter
(QMD; cm); density of medium-sized (40.6–45.7 cm dbh)
ponderosa pines, to simulate a diameter cap (cap trees);
density of mature and old growth ponderosa pine (>45.7
cm dbh; Youtz et al. 2008; large trees); spatial aggregation of
ponderosa trees, using the Clark and Evans (1954) index
(tree spacing); density of snags; percent cover of downed
woody material; and percent cover of herbaceous understory
(Table 1). Because forest cover type has a strong inﬂuence on
breeding birds (Rosenstock 1998), we included a binary
variable classifying each stand as ponderosa pine (0) or pine–
oak (1; see Study Area). Finally, we used the UTM nothing
coordinate (latitude) of the stand center as a surrogate for
unmeasured habitat variables (Rahbek and Graves 2001) and
to account for expected latitudinal differences in avian
community composition.
We hypothesized that percent canopy cover, year, and
survey number within a year could cause heterogeneity in
detection, colonization, or extinction probability. Canopy
cover can obscure birds both visually and audibly, reducing
detection probabilities in dense stands. Year and survey
number can capture variability in weather and other
attributes that are difﬁcult to measure (e.g., changing
resource availability), all of which can affect animal behavior
and detectability (Karplus 1952). Observer effects also
inﬂuence bird detection during surveys (Link and Sauer
1998). We attempted to control this variable by carefully
selecting and training observers and allocating survey effort
equally across them, rather than include observer as a
detection covariate. We controlled time and weather-related
effects by limiting surveys to a 3-hour period beginning 30
minutes after sunrise and days without strong wind or rain.
We standardized all continuous habitat and detection
covariates.
We ﬁrst analyzed data for each species in a multi-season
framework MacKenzie et al. (2003, 2006), estimating
detection probability (p), the probability of detecting each
species at a point if it was present; occupancy (c), the
expected probability that a given point was occupied;
colonization (g), the probability that an unoccupied point
was occupied in the following season; and local extinction (e),
the probability that an occupied point was unoccupied in the
following season. If multi-season models
were
over-
parameterized (i.e., insufﬁcient points for the number of
detections) as indicated by large standard errors, we
substituted single-season models (MacKenzie et al. 2002,
2006). In these cases, we treated each point and year as an
independent observation and used year as a detection
covariate.
We used all combinations of covariates to identify the most
parsimonious models of detection, extinction, and coloniza-
tion. We then applied an all-subsets approach to assess
inﬂuence of habitat covariates on occupancy by each species.
We constructed these models (n ¼ 1,024 per species) using
the RMark package (Laake 2011) in R (R Development
Core Team 2011). For each model, we computed Akaike’s
Information Criterion adjusted for small sample size (AICc),
difference in AICc (DAICc), and Akaike weights (wij, weight
of covariate i for species j; Burnham and Anderson 2002),
and used these values to assess model ﬁt. We ranked relative
covariate importance by summing wij, across all models in
which a given covariate occurred and used cumulative
weights to rank relative covariate importance for each
species. Larger values of wij are indicative of greater
importance for covariate i relative to other variables in the
model (Burnham and Anderson 2002). We considered
wij  0.50 indicative of a strong occupancy response to the
covariate and wij < 0.50 a weak response. For each covariate,
we averaged wij across species to estimate overall importance
(Dickson et al. 2009). We also calculated model-averaged
parameter

of species. We included forest cover type and latitude in the
models,
to
account
for
these
inﬂuential
sources
of
heterogeneity, but because of convergence problems with
these parameters in some models, we did not attempt to
interpret their averaged wij weights relative to other
covariates. We do not expect that these problems with
convergence affect our interpretation, since we are only
interested in the relative importance of variables rather than
estimates of effect sizes.
To examine patterns of species richness, we used a multi-
species hierarchical model that estimated individual species
occurrences, while accounting for imperfect detection of
species (Dorazio et al. 2006, Zipkin et al. 2010), thus
allowing us to remain consistent with our single species
occupancy models. We analyzed the model using methods of
data augmentation, which allows for estimation of the
number of species in the community not detected during
sampling (Royle et al. 2007, Ke´ry and Royle 2009). We ran
the model in a Bayesian framework using programs R and
WinBUGS
(Spiegelhalter
et
al.
2003)
following
the
approach of Zipkin et al. (2010). We ran 2 chains of length
20,000 with a burn-in of 5,000 and thinned the posterior
chains to 10. We estimated point-level species richness as a
function of all continuous habitat covariates and year as a
detection covariate, in a single-season modeling framework.
We excluded forest cover type as a covariate, because a
number of species occurred only in the pine–oak type,
causing the model to fail to converge. Visual examination of
modeled versus observed species richness suggested that
omission of this covariate did not affect our results. As in
Zipkin et al. (2010), the model does not build in explicit
relationships between point-speciﬁc richness and covariates;
thus, we estimated richness at each point and determined the
direction of the response of species richness versus each
covariate.
RESULTS
We sampled all 184 points in each of 1993, 1994, and 1995,
losing only 8 points in the last survey of 1995 because of
inaccessibility. We detected 48 species, and obtained 12,848
total detections (Appendix A, available online at www.
onlinelibrary.wiley.com).
We developed multi-season occupancy models for 14
species and single-season models for 2 additional species
(yellow-rumped warbler [Setophaga coronata] and Steller’s jay
[Cyanocitta stelleri]; Appendix B). All 16 species had
detection probabilities >0.20, adequate for building robust
occupancy models (MacKenzie et al. 2006). Western
bluebirds (Sialia mexicana) and broad-tailed hummingbirds
(Selasphorus platycercus) had >300 detections but occupancy
rates approaching 1.0 (>0.95), precluding reasonable models
of occupancy (MacKenzie et al. 2003). The remaining
species had detection probabilities <0.20 and could not be
modeled individually using these methods.
For the 16 species, habitat covariates associated with
occupancy (most to least important, based on average wij)
were
QMD,
downed
woody
material,
canopy
cover,
herbaceous cover, snags, large trees, cap trees, and tree
spacing (Table 2). All covariates except cap trees and tree
spacing had a strong association with species’ occupancy.

Most species had a positive association with large trees and
snags, and a negative association with canopy cover, QMD,
cap trees, downed woody material, and herbaceous cover
(Table 2). Half the species were positively associated with
tree spacing and half negatively (Table 2). Although we did
not attempt to interpret the importance of forest cover type,
relative to the other variables, all species except for 2 (yellow-
rumped warbler and Steller’s jay) were positively associated
with the presence of Gambel oak (Appendix B, available
online at www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com). Finally, for latitude,
the direction of association was not as important as using this
variable to account for spatial variation in species occupancy;
we would expect that some species are found in more
northern habitats and some in more southern.
In the species richness model, habitat covariates positively
associated with occupancy were large trees, herbaceous cover,
and snags; covariates negatively associated with occupancy
were canopy cover, QMD, cap trees, tree spacing, and
downed woody material (Table 2).
DISCUSSION
Southwestern ponderosa pine forest overstory has little
compositional variation; therefore, the relatively small
component of Gambel oak provides critical foraging and
nesting microhabitats provided by oak trees of various
growth forms (1979b; Wightman et al. 2007). Consistent
with the literature (Brawn and Balda 1988, Rosenstock 1998,
Jentsch et al. 2008), we found that most avian species’
occupancy was positively associated with the presence of
Gambel oak. Loss of oak from fuelwood harvesting in
southwestern forests has not been quantiﬁed but is a
management concern (Abella and Fule´ 2008).
Structural attributes of forests are directly affected by
thinning, and we found that many such attributes had strong
associations with species occupancy of the breeding bird
community in our study stands. Most bird species (11/16; 7
strongly) were negatively associated with canopy cover, and
overall
species
richness
was
negatively
associated.
In
addition, most bird species (11/16 species; 6 strongly)
were positively associated with the density of large trees, and
species richness was positively associated. In contrast, cap
tree density had a negative association with most species (11/
16; 4 strongly) and species richness, reﬂecting low avian
diversity and abundance in stands dominated by medium-
sized ponderosa pines that also had minimal horizontal or
vertical heterogeneity. Critics of diameter caps have noted
that size thresholds are arbitrary and lack scientiﬁc support
(2006a). Moreover, caps can reduce within-stand diversity
and create post-treatment stand structure considerably
different from the evolutionary environment of ponderosa
pine forests (Abella et al. 2006). We also detected a negative
association with QMD by most species (12/16; 7 strongly),
and a negative association with species richness. Although
the negative association with QMD seems contradictory to
overall positive associations with mature and old-growth
trees,
QMD
values
were
skewed
downward
by
the
preponderance of small diameter trees and relative scarcity
of large, old trees in our study stands (average QMD across
all stands was 27.5 cm). Although widely used for forest
inventory purposes (Curtis and Marshall 2000), our results
suggest that QMD is not well suited for describing the
habitat value of large trees to nesting songbirds, due to
difﬁculties in its interpretation.
We found an overall positive association between snag
density and bird species richness. Snags were strongly
associated with occupancy of species (11/16; 6 strongly),
particularly of cavity-nesters, which is a relationship well
documented in previous studies of breeding birds in
ponderosa pine forests (Cunningham et al. 1980). Our ﬁnal
analysis included 5 cavity nesters: pygmy nuthatch (Sitta
pygmaea),
white-breasted
nuthatch
(Sitta
carolinensis),
mountain chickadee (Poecile gambeli), and northern ﬂicker
(Colaptes auratus), all of which were strongly associated with
snags; and violet-green swallow (Tachycineta thalassina),
which was weakly associated with snags. The western
bluebird and other woodpecker (Melanerpes, Picoides) species
likely would have demonstrated similar relationships, had
they been included among the ﬁnal models; other studies
have reported positive responses to restoration treatments by
these species (Wightman and Germaine 2006, Hurteau et al.
2008).
The only variable that clearly had a consistently opposite
relationship with occupancy than we hypothesized was
downed wood. Most species (12/16; 8 strongly) and species
richness had a negative association with downed woody
material. Most downed wood in our study stands was
comprised of boles and branches from small diameter
(<20 cm) pines felled by natural mortality or during pre-
commercial thinning operations; materials that would be
relatively ephemeral under a more natural, frequent-ﬁre
regime. However, we caution that our sampling approach for
downed woody material was designed to measure fuels
(materials >5 cm diameter), not wildlife habitat per se.
Thus, we could not distinguish between large logs and other
woody structures providing foraging or nesting micro-
habitats and responses of species that use them (e.g., house
wren [Troglodytes aedon]).
Two habitat covariates had opposite relationships with
species richness than with the majority of species occupancy
results. Most species (13/16; 8 strongly) exhibited a negative
association with herbaceous cover, a primary feature of
presettlement ponderosa pine forests (Covington and Moore
1994). However, overall species richness was positively
associated with herbaceous cover. This may be because only 1
species in the ﬁnal model set (dark-eyed junco [Junco
hyemalis]) nests and forages on the ground, but we assessed
more ground-dwelling species using the species richness
model. Although other studies in these forests (e.g.,
Rosenstock 1996) have not reported signiﬁcant correlations
between understory variables and breeding birds, we caution
that herbaceous cover may inﬂuence less-studied species, as
well as other wildlife (Kalies et al. 2012). Species richness and
half the modeled species (8/16; 3 strongly) responded
positively to clumping (i.e., negatively to tree spacing) of
ponderosa pine trees, another common though not ubiqui-
tous feature of presettlement forests in the Southwest (Abella
1162
The Journal of Wildlife Management  77(6)

and Denton 2009). This weak relationship by many species
likely reﬂected the relatively high tree density and uniform
distribution in our study stands. Well-deﬁned clumps of
mature and old-growth trees, like those reported by White
(1985) were uncommon. Where present, these groups
typically had numerous younger trees embedded within
that also were included in our spacing metric. In general,
although we were able to assess species’ associations with
individual attributes of the evolutionary environment of
ponderosa pine forests, these components rarely occurred
together in our study stands.
Overall, our ﬁndings are consistent with previous studies of
breeding birds in managed and old-growth ponderosa pine
forests (Szaro and Balda 1986, Block et al. 1997, and
references cited therein). Although we were able to explicitly
model only a third of the breeding avifauna detected during
surveys, the species richness results indicate that most other
species would also beneﬁt from restoration treatments
designed to create conditions resembling the evolutionary
environment of southwestern ponderosa pine forests. The
single relationship that does not match that expected in the
evolutionary environment is the negative association between
birds (individually and collectively) to downed woody
material, which we caution may be a sampling artifact. In
addition,
even
if
perfectly
restoring
the
evolutionary
environment was possible, this approach would not beneﬁt
every single species. Some songbird species (e.g., western
wood-pewee [Contopus sordidulus] and black-headed gros-
beak [Pheucticus melanocephalus]) likely have beneﬁtted from
post-settlement changes in ponderosa pine forests, particu-
larly increased tree density and canopy cover (Brawn and
Balda
1988),
and
thus might respond negatively
to
restoration treatments. Since all of these species are
abundant, widely distributed, and lack special conservation
status (i.e., are not listed as threatened or endangered), we
consider this an acceptable tradeoff to restore ecosystems
outside their range of natural variability and at risk of further
degradation from stand-replacing crown ﬁres. The inherent
natural heterogeneity of ponderosa pine forests suggests that
a variety of restoration treatments may best meet conserva-
tion objectives and minimize risk of failure as managers
undertake the considerable challenge of landscape-scale
forest restoration (2006a).
Large-scale implementation of forest restoration treat-
ments necessitates a habitat-focused; multi-species approach
to monitor wildlife responses (Lambeck 1997, Lindenmayer
et al. 2002). Occupancy modeling is suited for such
applications and gaining popularity. In our study, however,
we were only able to ﬁt models for about half of the species
reasonably well-detected (i.e., >60 total detections) during
surveys. Although the number of species we modeled was
similar to that of other avian studies of comparable spatial
and temporal scale (e.g., Kotliar et al. 2007, Dickson et al.
2009), our inability to model additional species was likely due
to low detection probabilities for some species, widespread
generalist species that occurred at nearly all sampling points,
and the large sample size required when ﬁtting multi-season
models with a large set of habitat covariates. Although
conducting more surveys would have increased the number of
rare species we were able to model, we had to consider the
tradeoff between modeling rare species and over sampling
more common species. Thus, the implementation of the
species richness model was a good compromise, in that we
kept our sampling at a manageable level of effort yet could
still draw conclusions at the community level.
MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS
Restoration treatments that return southwestern ponderosa
pine forests to conditions within their natural range of
variability will likely beneﬁt a substantial portion of the
breeding songbird community. Tree size and species should
be considered when undertaking thinning operations. We
recommend retaining ponderosa pine trees >45.7-cm
diameter at breast height, Gambel oaks, and snags. The
commonly advocated 40.6-cm (16 inches) diameter cap may
not beneﬁt breeding songbirds and begs further evaluation
for potential adverse effects to other wildlife species.
Downed woody material provides habitat for other forest
wildlife species such as small mammals; the negative
association reported here should be interpreted with caution,
especially given constraints of our sampling design. We
recommend occupancy modeling (both at the species and
community level) as an efﬁcient method for assessing
wildlife-habitat relationships at large scales.
