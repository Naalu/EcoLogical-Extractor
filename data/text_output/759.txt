Abstract
We review current knowledge about the use of management treatments to reduce human-induced threats to old ponderosa pine (Pinus
ponderosa) trees. We address the following questions: Are ﬁre-induced damage and mortality greater in old than younger trees? Can management
treatments ameliorate the detrimental effects of ﬁre, competition-induced stress, and drought on old trees? Can management increase resistance of
old trees to bark beetles? We offer the following recommendations for the use of thinning and burning treatments in old-growth ponderosa pine
forests. Treatments should be focused on high-value stands where ﬁre exclusion has increased fuels and competition and where detrimental effects
of disturbance during harvesting can be minimized. Fuels should be reduced in the vicinity of old trees prior to prescribed burns to reduce ﬁre
intensity, as old trees are often more prone to dying after burning than younger trees. Raking the forest ﬂoor beneath old trees prior to burning may
not only reduce damage from smoldering combustion under certain conditions but also increase ﬁne-root mortality. Thinning of neighboring trees
often increases water and carbon uptake of old trees within 1 year of treatment, and increases radial growth within several years to two decades after
treatment. However, stimulation of growth of old trees by thinning can be negated by severe drought. Evidence from young trees suggests that
management treatments that cause large increases in carbon allocation to radial xylem growth also increase carbon allocation to constitutive resin
defenses against bark beetle attacks, but evidence for old trees is scarce. Prescribed, low-intensity burning may attract bark beetles and increase
mortality of old trees from beetle attacks despite a stimulation of bole resin production.

1. Introduction
Much of past forestry research has focused on obtaining
information to increase the efﬁciency of wood commodity
production. Consequently, the majority of past silvicultural
research has been directed at treatments to hasten regeneration
and improve the growth and wood properties of young trees
(Smith et al., 1997; Nyland, 2002). Large, old trees were rarely
included in this research agenda.
Interest in using silviculture to perpetuate the vigor and
longevity of existing old trees is growing. This interest has
arisen from the recognition that old trees are rare on the
landscape (Bailey and Ide, 2001; Sesnie and Bailey, 2003), are a
living testimony of past disturbance and climate change (e.g.,
Speer et al., 2001; Soule´ and Knapp, 2006), provide unique
wildlife habitat (Reynolds et al., 1992; Kelly et al., 1993;
Humes et al., 1999; Mazurek and Zielinski, 2004; Molina et al.,
2006), sequester carbon over centuries (Harmon et al., 1990),
and provide spiritual inspiration to many people (Ostlund et al.,
2005). In, dry, ﬁre-prone, forests of the western U.S., Fiedler
(2000) recommended that stands containing old trees receive
priority for fuel-reduction treatments because of their rarity and
ecological
importance,
and
because
they
are
currently
threatened by ﬁre, competition stress, drought, and associated
bark beetle attacks. This review focuses on old ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa), the dominant species of these forests
(Hardin et al., 2001).
Deﬁnitions of old-growth ponderosa pine forests vary
among authors and agencies, yet all emphasize the existence of
old trees (Kaufmann et al., 1992). For example, attributes of
old-growth ponderosa pine forests include containing trees with
a diameter at breast height (DBH) greater than 41 cm and at
least 200 years old in the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains,
DBH greater than 41 cm and at least 160 years old in the Black
Hills, South Dakota, and DBH greater than 46 cm and at least
160 years old in Arizona and New Mexico (Mehl, 1992). The
mean age of ponderosa pines in old-growth stands in Arizona
and New Mexico is about 279 years, with the oldest known tree
742 years old (Swetnam and Brown, 1992). In southern Oregon,
mean age of ponderosa pine in two mixed confer stands ranged
from 230 to 315 years, with the oldest tree over 400 years
(Agee, 2003; Perrakis and Agee, 2006). In Montana, mean age
of ponderosa pine in old-growth mixed conifer stands ranged
from 179 to 374 years with the oldest tree over 450 years (Arno
et al., 1995, 1997; Keeling and Sala, unpublished data). Trees
older than about 400 years in remote unlogged areas are rare,
perhaps because of extensive mortality from severe drought in
the late 1500s (Swetnam and Brown, 1992). In addition to age,
crown characteristics differ between old and younger, but
mature trees. Height growth is slow in old trees producing a
ﬂattened crown top compared to the more conical crown top of
younger trees with more rapid height growth (Keen, 1936;
Bond, 2000). In this review, we use the term ‘‘old’’ to refer to
ponderosa pines that are at least 160 years old or have a DBH
greater than 40 cm, and the terms ‘‘young’’ or ‘‘younger’’ to
refer to trees that are less than 160 years of age or have a DBH
less than 40 cm.
Old ponderosa pine in areas historically subjected to
frequent low-severity ﬁre regimes is currently threatened by
several factors that are distinct from the logging that reduced
their abundance over the past 150 years. The ﬁrst of these
factors is wildﬁre. Recent increases in wildﬁre activity and
severity in the western U.S. that often kill old pines have been
linked to temperature increases since the mid 1980s (Westerling
et al., 2006) and fuel accumulation resulting from a century of
ﬁre exclusion (Habeck, 1994; Arno et al., 1995, 1997;
Covington et al., 2001; Keane et al., 2002; Fule´ et al., 2004;
Moore et al., 2004). The increase in fuels due to ﬁre exclusion,
however, appears to be less predictable in old-growth forests of
the northern Rocky Mountains relative to drier forests of the
southwestern U.S. (Keeling et al., 2006). Increasing evidence
also suggests that historic logging disturbance may also
promote regeneration and increase fuel accumulation in the
long-term beyond that caused by ﬁre exclusion (Minnich et al.,
1995; Kaufmann et al., 2000). In ponderosa pine forests where
current ﬁre regimes are clearly outside the historic range of
variability, wildﬁre severity and frequency are expected to
increase in the future in the western U.S. as temperatures rise
and
relative
humidity
decreases
(Brown
et
al.,
2004).
Restoration treatments, consisting of thinning or prescribed
burning to reduce fuels and modify fuel structure, have been
recommended to reverse the current trend of large, stand-
replacing wildﬁres (e.g., Covington, 2000; Fiedler, 2000; Fule´
et al., 2001; Allen et al., 2002; Fitzgerald, 2005).
A second threat to old ponderosa pine is competition with
mid- or under-story trees. This threat may be natural, or non-
anthropogenic, in some mixed-species higher elevation forests
containing ponderosa pine whose ﬁre regime does not deviate
much from historic variability (Brown et al., 1999; Schoenna-
gel et al., 2004), but is of anthropogenic origin in regions where
ﬁre exclusion has increased tree density beyond its natural
range of variability. For instance, increased tree density in the
understory and in former openings and meadows over the last
century of ﬁre exclusion has increased competition between old
and younger trees in some areas (Biondi, 1996; Feeney et al.,
1998; Stone et al., 1999; McDowell et al., 2003). The use of
silvicultural treatments to reduce competition stress on old trees
is a relatively new idea (Harrington and Sackett, 1992;
T.E. Kolb et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 249 (2007) 141–157
142

Kaufmann et al., 1992; Fiedler, 2000). Several experiments
have been started recently to address impacts of thinning and
prescribed burning on old ponderosa pine (Covington et al.,
1997; Oliver, 2000; Ritchie, 2005), yet only a few conclusive
results have been published and synthesis of these results is
currently lacking. Information on the growth rate of old trees in
low-competition environments is scarce for all tree species
(Bond, 2000).
The last signiﬁcant threats to old ponderosa pine are drought
and bark beetle attacks. Mortality of ponderosa pine attributed
to drought and associated bark beetle attacks has increased
recently (e.g., Macomber and Woodcock, 1994; Savage, 1994;
Agee, 2003; Guarin and Taylor, 2005). Bark beetle attacks
interact with ﬁre damage and increase the probability of post-
ﬁre tree mortality (McHugh et al., 2003; Parker et al., 2006).
Climate change forecasts include an increase in the frequency
and severity of drought in the western U.S. (Houghton et al.,
2001; Coquard et al., 2004), which may increase bark beetle
attacks (Breshears et al., 2005). Partial cutting has been
recommended to increase resistance of ponderosa pine to bark
beetles (Schmid and Amman, 1992; Fettig et al., 2007), yet
information to support this recommendation for old trees is
scarce.
Our objectives are to review current knowledge about the use
of management treatments to reduce human-induced threats to
old ponderosa pine in the western U.S. Speciﬁcally, we address
the following questions: Are ﬁre-induced damage and mortality
greater in old trees than younger trees? Can management
treatments ameliorate the detrimental effects of ﬁre, competi-
tion-induced stress, and drought on old trees? Can management
increase resistance of old trees to bark beetles?
2. Response of old ponderosa pine to ﬁre
Impacts of prescribed ﬁre on growth of ponderosa pine have
been addressed in several studies of trees that were mature but
younger than our deﬁnition of an old tree. Studies on old trees
are rare. In Oregon, height, basal area, and volume growth of
young ponderosa pine were reduced over an 8-year period after
prescribed ﬁre, and the effect was more pronounced in burned
areas with higher duff consumption (Landsberg et al., 1984). In
northern Arizona, prescribed ﬁre reduced radial growth of
young, mature ponderosa pine for several years after burning
even in the absence of obvious crown damage from ﬁre, after
which growth recovered to pre-burn rates (Sutherland et al.,
1991). Prescribed ﬁre with and without prior thinning had little
effect on radial growth of young ponderosa pine in Montana
(Sala et al., 2005). Prescribed ﬁre intervals of 4 or 6 years have
been reported to stimulate radial growth of young trees slightly,
whereas intervals of 1, 2, 8 and 10 years decreased growth
relative to no burning (Peterson et al., 1994). Prescribed, low-
intensity ﬁre rarely kills young ponderosa pine unless ﬁre
intensity is severe enough to girdle the tree by killing cambium
or removing much of the canopy by scorch or consumption
(Ryan, 1982, 1990; McHugh and Kolb, 2003; Sieg et al., 2006).
Whereas impacts of low-intensity ﬁres are expressed in
young ponderosa pine primarily in growth responses, the
effects of such ﬁres on old pine are often expressed by increased
tree mortality. In Oregon, mortality of ponderosa pine over
70 cm diameter, 4 years after a prescribed ﬁre, signiﬁcantly
exceeded that in adjacent unburned areas (Thomas and Agee,
1986). In the same areas, Agee (2003) measured mortality of
ponderosa pine for 13 years. The average size and age of
ponderosa pines that died in the ﬁrst 4 years after burning were
10–20 cm and less than 100 years old. Between the 4th and 13th
post-ﬁre years, those averages increased to 45–100 cm and
100–400 years. Precipitation was below average in every year
but one between post-ﬁre years 4 and 13, suggesting a role of
drought in the delayed mortality of the old trees.
Prescribed burning at Crater Lake National Park in Oregon
between 1976 and 1986 increased mortality of old ponderosa
pine compared with control, unburned stands (Swezy and Agee,
1991). In burned stands, mortality was moderately high for the
smaller diameter classes, declined as diameter increased, and
then increased sharply for the largest diameter trees. Mortality of
trees with diameters greater than 100 cm in burned stands varied
between 21 and 50%, and trees in the oldest class with moderate
to low vigor class had mortality of 71–100% (Swezy and Agee,
1991). A majority (68%) of dead trees after a ﬁre in 2002 had
evidence of western pine beetle (Dendroctonus brevicomis)
attacks (Perrakis and Agee, 2006). Crown vigor, measured with
Keen’s crownvigor classes, was signiﬁcantly related to mortality
after burning—mortality was highest for low vigor trees.
Similar to experiences in Oregon, prescribed ﬁre also can
increase the mortality of old ponderosa pine in northern Arizona.
Prescribed ﬁre applied to a stand in northern Arizona after 100
years of ﬁre exclusion resulted in 39% mortality of old trees
compared with 16% in a control, unburned stand, within 20 post-
ﬁre years (Sackett et al., 1996). This mortality was associated
withcompleteconsumptionofthe forestﬂoor fromthebole tothe
dripline. Mortality of the old trees started 1.5 years after the ﬁre
and continued for 20 years after ﬁre. Prescribed ﬁre at Grand
Canyon National Park, Arizona, increased mortality of old
ponderosa pine (10–23% depending on stand) compared with
control, unburned stands (1–3%) (Kaufmann and Covington,
2001). Following thinning and prescribed burning on shallow,
lava-derived soils in northern Arizona, Fule´ et al. (2002) reported
67% mortality of large (>50 cm diameter) ponderosa pine
compared with 19% mortality for small (<50 cm diameter) pine
within 2 years of burning.
Old ponderosa pines are often more susceptible to mortality
after ﬁre than younger, mature trees. For example, a ‘‘U-
shaped’’ relationship between post-ﬁre mortality and diameter
at breast height (Fig. 1) was reported for ponderosa pine in both
southern Oregon (Agee, 2003) and northern Arizona (McHugh
and Kolb, 2003). In Arizona, mortality 3 years after ﬁre was
highest for trees with the smallest diameter (<20 cm) as would
be expected because of their thin bark. Mortality decreased as
diameter increased between 20 and 50 cm as would be expected
due to increasing bark thickness. However, mortality increased
as diameter increased between 50 cm and the largest trees at
80 cm. Avery similar relationship was found in the Oregon data
which included larger diameter trees (Fig. 1). While Harrington
(1993) reported decreasing mortality with increasing diameter
T.E. Kolb et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 249 (2007) 141–157
143

for ponderosa pine, the largest size class of trees he studied was
30 cm, which is consistent with Fig. 1. This ‘‘U-shaped’’
distribution between post-ﬁre mortality and diameter has also
been reported in another study of ponderosa pine (Finney,
1999), and for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in Sweden (Linder
et al., 1998). Relationships between the probability of post-ﬁre
mortality and total crown damage from ﬁre for stands in
northern Arizona suggest that ﬁre can increase mortality of
large-diameter, old trees more than smaller, younger trees even
when crown damage from ﬁre is standardized over tree size
classes (Fig. 2).
What reasons may account for high levels of mortality in old
ponderosa pine after ﬁre? First, old, large trees may have
previous ﬁre and lightning scars, and damage from insects and
fungi, that enable ﬁre to extend deeper into the cambium and
higher up the bole causing higher levels of crown damage
(Weaver, 1943; Linder et al., 1998). Second, ponderosa pine
sheds bark pieces annually, in contrast to the persistent bark of
Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii) or true ﬁrs (Abies spp.),
and over decades the shed bark mixed with leaf litter can build
up to 20 cm in thickness or more (Fig. 3). A single prescribed
ﬁre can consume much of this material, and these old trees can
therefore experience greater root or cambial temperatures than
younger trees (Sackett and Haase, 1998; Finney, 1999). Third,
old trees may have low amounts of carbohydrate available to
replace or repair damaged tissues because of low net
photosynthetic rate (Yoder et al., 1994; Bond, 2000; Kolb
and Stone, 2000), low leaf area relative to carbon sink demands
(Ryan et al., 1997), and large carbon allocation to roots and
mycorrhizae (Ryan et al., 1997). Fourth, large trees have thicker
phloem than small trees (Kolb et al., 1998, 2006) and thus may
be a better food source for phloem-feeding insects, such as the
western pine beetle that can cause tree mortality after ﬁre
(Miller and Keen, 1960; McHugh et al., 2003; Breece, 2006).
Other factors may predispose old ponderosa pine to
accelerated mortality after ﬁre. Old trees with substantial ﬁre
scars can burn through to the cambium and die more easily than
younger trees with fewer scars (Perrakis and Agee, 2006).
Depending on the timing of drought (before or after the ﬁre),
stress may be exacerbated by a low-intensity ﬁre that would
have less effect during non-drought periods (Agee, 2003).
Interception of precipitation prior to burning by the thick forest
ﬂoor beneath old-growth ponderosa pine (Fig. 3) may cause
additional water stress that exacerbates effects of ﬁre. Older

stands
may
be
severely
infested
with
dwarf
mistletoe
(Arceuthobium spp.), which can cause localized torching and
may be associated with higher mortality after ﬁre (Kaufmann
and Covington, 2001; Parker et al., 2006).
3. Management amelioration of detrimental ﬁre effects
The previous section showed that prescribed- and wild-ﬁre
often increase mortality of old ponderosa pine. Here, we
address management treatments that have been used to reduce
such
mortality.
The
results
have
not
been
universally
successful, and monitoring of mortality from such treatments
has usually been short-term, despite evidence that post-ﬁre
mortality of old trees can continue over a 10–20-year period
after burning (Sackett and Haase, 1998; Agee, 2003).
3.1. Raking
Raking of debris around the base of old trees before burning
has been the most-studied management technique to ameliorate
the effect of burning. All the studies we review have evaluated a
ﬁrst prescribed ﬁre after many decades of ﬁre exclusion, as
subsequent prescribed ﬁres may not require manual fuel
removal.
Several studies have suggested that raking is a successful
technique. In the southwestern U.S., the mortality incurred at
Chimney Springs, Arizona after prescribed ﬁres without raking
(Sackett and Haase, 1998) prompted a recommendation that
organic material be raked to a distance of 0.5–1 m away from
tree bases to avoid potential girdling effects (Sackett et al.,
1996). Kolb et al. (2001) reported little mortality of old trees at
the Gus Pearson Natural Area in northern Arizona up to 6 years
after prescribed ﬁre when the lower layers (‘‘duff’’) of the forest
ﬂoor were removed entirely, not just raked away from tree
boles, and dried grass (to simulate presettlement understory
fuel loading) was added to litter around the bases of
presettlement trees prior to the ﬁrst prescribed burn. Cambial
temperatures measured with thermocouples did not reach lethal
levels on most trees (Covington et al., 1997). Only 3 of 49 trees
died, two from windthrow and one from bark beetles.
Other studies indicated that within burned areas, trees that
were raked had similar mortality to those not raked. Kaufmann
and Covington (2001) reported low mortality after prescribed
burning at Grand Canyon, Arizona, but cautioned that their
study extended only 5 years after burning. Perrakis (2004)
found no difference in mortality of old trees for either spring or
fall burning between trees with fuels raked around their base
and control trees in Oregon.
Yet other studies have found that mortality of old trees was
high on certain soils even with a raking treatment. Two years
after a prescribed ﬁre, 35% of all trees growing on shallow,
lava-derived soils at Mount Trumbull in northern Arizona died,
and 67% of the trees above 50 cm diameter died (Fule´ et al.,
2002). They observed that on other soils burned in the same ﬁre,
unusual levels of mortality did not occur. In Oregon on soils
developed from avalanche deposits of gravel and pumice,
raking of the surface organic horizons allowed the lower
horizons to dry, so that a higher proportion of the forest ﬂoor
was consumed in spring burns (Swezy and Agee, 1991). Fine-
root biomass was lower in the rake-burn treatment than a burn-
only treatment. These studies were conducted on soils derived
from
volcanic
deposits
where
many
of
the
roots
are
concentrated in surface mineral and organic horizons, and this
may negate the effect of an ameliorating treatment, such as
raking. The results of these studies suggest that the effects of
raking treatment may be site speciﬁc.
Because raking can directly affect roots by removing live
roots in the surface organic horizons, it may be useful to delay
prescribed burning after raking. Raking 1 year, and perhaps
burning the next year or several years later, may ameliorate the
immediate loss of ﬁne roots due to the raking treatment before
further ﬁne-root loss is incurred by burning.
3.2. Understory removal and pruning
Understory trees have the potential to torch and increase
crown scorch to old trees during prescribed burning. Swezy and
Agee (1991) suggested that felling, girdling, or removing small
trees in the vicinity of old trees before prescribed burning might
result in less heat damage to the older trees. In Oregon,
understory shrubs are mown before burning to compact fuels
and reduce ﬁreline intensity (Fitzgerald, 2005). Similarly,
pruning of low-hanging mistletoe branches can reduce the
probability of torching of old trees (Youngblood et al., 2004).
3.3. Slash compression
We know of only one study that has evaluated the effect of
compressing slash prior to prescribed burning on post-ﬁre
mortality of old ponderosa pine (Jerman et al., 2004). The study
was performed in northern Arizona and the slash was
compressed with a bulldozer. Slash and forest ﬂoor were
removed for a distance of 0.5–1 m around the base of the trees,
and the remaining slash (about 60 Mg ha1) from a thinning
operation was either compressed or left uncompressed before a
prescribed ﬁre was applied. Crown scorch volume was 14% in
the uncompressed slash burn compared to less than 1% in the
compressed slash burn. After 2 years, mortality of old trees in
the uncompressed slash area was 14% compared to 0% in the
compressed slash area. This study (Jerman et al., 2004) and
others (e.g., Hummel and Agee, 2003) suggest that arrangement
of fuels, as much as total mass, may affect ﬁreline intensity and
mortality of old ponderosa pine after prescribed burning.
Understory trees have the potential to torch and increase
crown scorch to old trees during prescribed burning (Scott and
Reinhardt, 2001). Swezy and Agee (1991) suggested that
felling, girdling, or removing small trees in the vicinity of old
trees before prescribed burning might result in less heat damage
to the older trees, and this recommendation has been
incorporated into broad perspectives for restoring southwestern
ponderosa pine forests (Allen et al., 2002). Fule´ et al. (2002)
developed operational guidelines for two levels of understory
thinning around old pines in the Southwest. The intensive
treatment included removing nearly all young trees in the
T.E. Kolb et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 249 (2007) 141–157
145

vicinity of old trees, while the less intensive treatment cleared
most young trees within a radius of 12–18 m of each old trees,
with a longer radius in the downslope/downwind direction.
4. Stimulation of old-growth ponderosa pine vigor by
management
It is well known that resource uptake and growth of young
ponderosa pine can be increased by management treatments,
such as thinning that reduce inter-tree competition (Schubert,
1971; Cochran and Barrett, 1993; Kolb et al., 1998; Sala et al.,
2005; McDowell et al., 2006). Accelerating the growth of
young trees by thinning and prescribed burning treatments has
been recommended to promote more rapid development of old-
growth conditions in ponderosa pine forests (e.g., Sesnie and
Bailey, 2003; Skov et al., 2005).
Growth of old trees appears to be more limited by
competition than for younger trees. For example, basal area
increment (BAI) of old ponderosa pine declined more than BAI
of young pine during a 70-year period in which tree density and
stand basal area increased at the G.A. Pearson Natural Area
(GPNA) in northern Arizona (Biondi, 1996). In 1920–1930 old
pine was growing faster than young pine, but by 1980–1990 old
pine was growing slower than young pine (Biondi, 1996).
Consequently, the application of management treatments to
current old-growth stands to increase the vigor of old trees has
been proposed (Harrington and Sackett, 1992; Kaufmann et al.,
1992; Covington et al., 1997), but little information exists on
the response of old trees to such treatments.
4.1. Ecophysiology of old tree response to management
treatments
A number of physiological changes occur as trees become
older and larger that likely inﬂuence their response to
management treatments. As the path length of water transport
from the roots to the foliage increases with tree size, both
frictional and gravitational constraints on water movement
increase (Ryan et al., 2006). These constraints result in reduced
stomatal conductance to avoid cavitation, which subsequently
limits photosynthesis due to limited CO2 diffusion from the
atmosphere to foliage mesophyll. Decreased stomatal con-
ductance and photosynthesis with increased tree size has been
consistently observed in ponderosa pine (Yoder et al., 1994;
Hubbard et al., 1999; Kolb and Stone, 2000; Skov et al., 2004;
Sala, 2006). Moreover, cell turgor can decrease with increased
tree size because tissue water potential becomes more negative
(Koch et al., 2004; Woodruff et al., 2004). These hydraulic
constraints on photosynthesis and cell growth have been
proposed as mechanisms of the commonly observed decrease in
growth efﬁciency, deﬁned as stemwood growth per unit leaf
area, at the individual tree- and stand-levels, with increasing
tree age and size (Ryan et al., 1997, 2006; Martinez-Vilalta
et al., 2007).
There are a number of changes in tree morphology and
physiology that may compensate for the hydraulic constraints
that occur in large, old trees (Mencuccini and Magnani, 2000;
McDowell et al., 2002a; Mencuccini, 2003; Ryan et al., 2006).
Examples include changes in carbon allocation that increase the
ratio of root absorbing area to leaf area (Ewers et al., 2000;
Hacke et al., 2000; Magnani et al., 2000), and increase the ratio
of sapwood area to leaf area (Mencuccini and Bonosi, 2001;
Fischer et al., 2002; McDowell et al., 2002b, 2006; Barnard and
Ryan, 2003; Sala, 2006). Other potentially compensating
changes include an increase in sapwood capacitance (Waring
and Running, 1978; Goldstein et al., 1998; Phillips et al., 2003),
sapwood conductivity (Pothier et al., 1989), and increased
water potential gradient from soil to leaf (Hacke et al., 2000;
McDowell et al., 2002a; Barnard and Ryan, 2003).
Decreased hydraulic conductance with increased tree size
results in a more limited range of stomatal conductance for tall
trees than short trees (McDowell et al., 2005). This can be
demonstrated using a hydraulic corollary to Darcy’s Law
applied to trees, as originally developed by Whitehead et al.
(1984):
gs ¼ klðCs  ClÞ
VPD
;
(1)
in which kl is whole plant hydraulic conductance, Cs the soil
water potential (MPa), Cl the daytime leaf water potential, and
VPD is vapor pressure deﬁcit (kPa). From the framework in
Eq. (1) we made generalized predictions of how different size
trees may respond to changes Cs associated with thinning. We
applied Eq. (1) in a similar fashion to McDowell et al. (2005).
We assumed that Cl is constant (isohydric) regardless of site
water availability (Maherali and DeLucia, 2001; McDowell
et al., 2006) and that hydraulic conductance of old, tall trees is
half that of young, short trees. Young, short trees with high
hydraulic conductance are predicted to have a broader range of
stomatal conductance and a steep response of stomatal con-
ductance to Cs, whereas old, tall, trees are predicted to be less
responsive (Fig. 4).
Fig. 4. Predictions of stomatal conductance verses soil water potential using the
Whitehead et al. (1984) modeling approach shows that conductance of old, tall
trees is less sensitive to drying soil than young, short trees. Hydraulic con-
ductance of tall trees was set to 50% of that of short trees. Model adapted from
McDowell et al. (2005).
T.E. Kolb et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 249 (2007) 141–157
146

The model results from Eq. (1) suggest that management
actions in ponderosa pine forests that increase availability of
soil water, such as thinning (Feeney et al., 1998; Kolb et al.,
1998; Sala et al., 2005; McDowell et al., 2006), stimulate
stomatal conductance of young, short trees more than old, tall
trees. Stomatal response of old, tall trees to increased soil water
content is constrained by lower hydraulic conductance from
soil to leaf as a consequence of a longer path length compared
with young, short trees. Because stomatal conductance is
strongly related to photosythesis in ponderosa pine (Feeney
et al., 1998; Skov et al., 2004), we should expect larger and
faster stimulation of photosynthesis and growth in young, short
trees than old, tall trees. This theoretical expectation is
consistent with results of an experiment in northern Arizona
where thinning stimulated stomatal conductance and net
photosynthetic rate (Skov et al., 2004) and bole radial
increment (Skov et al., 2005) of small, mature ponderosa pine
more than for old pine in the same stand.
4.2. Empirical studies of response of old ponderosa pine to
management
The theoretical prediction (Fig. 4) that old, tall trees should
be less responsive to management treatments that increase
availability of soil water than younger, shorter trees raises the
question as to whether resource uptake and growth of old
ponderosa pine are responsive to management treatments that
reduce competition. In this section, we summarize results from
recent experiments in Arizona, Oregon, and Montana that have
evaluated the response of old ponderosa pine to thinning and
prescribed burning treatments.
4.2.1. Arizona
Growth and physiological responses of old ponderosa pine
to management treatments have been studied for 10 years after
initial treatment at the Gus Pearson Natural Area (GPNA) in
northern Arizona. The GPNA is managed as a Research Natural
Area by the U.S. Forest Service because it contains a stand of
large, old ponderosa pine (current average age 438 years,
diameter at breast height about 75 cm) and it had received no
silvicultural management or harvests prior to the recent
experiment. The treatments, described in detail in Covington
et al. (1997), consisted of thinned, thinned and prescribed
burned, and control (untreated) portions of the same 4.7 ha
stand.
The goal of the thinned treatment was to recreate as closely
as possible the tree size class distribution and spatial pattern
that occurred on the site before the start of Euro-American
settlement of the region in 1876. The thinning removed most
post-settlement trees, deﬁned as trees that established after
Euro-American settlement of the region in 1876. A small
number of post-settlement trees were left on site to replace dead
presettlement trees that were identiﬁed by old logs and stumps.
In addition, no trees with diameter at breast height greater than
40 cm were cut. The thinning occurred in November 1993 and
reduced tree basal area by about 62% (34.5–13.0 m2 ha1) and
tree density by 95% (3100–151 trees ha1).
The goal of the thinned + burned treatment was to recreate
both the presettlement structure and ﬁre disturbance regime.
The treatment consisted of application of low-intensity
prescribed burns to a portion of the thinned stand. The ﬁrst
burn occurred in October 1994, about 1 year after thinning.
Fuels were manipulated in the ﬁrst burn in order to keep ﬁre
intensity low and minimize damage to old trees. All thinning
slash was removed from the site, and the forest ﬂoor (i.e., duff
and bark ﬂakes) was raked from the entire area to be burned in
order to simulate forest ﬂoor conditions hypothesized to occur
prior to before disruption of the frequent ﬁre regime. Next,
dried foliage of native grasses and forbs (672 kg ha1) was put
on the raked forest ﬂoor in addition to the litter layer prior to
burning to simulate forest ﬂoor fuels of presettlement forests
which often contained a dense, herbaceous understory. These
herbaceous ﬁne fuels were ignited and produced a low-intensity
ﬁre with average ﬂame length of 15 cm and a maximum length
of 60 cm. The initial burn in 1994 was followed by three
additional prescribed burns at a 4-year interval (1998, 2002,
2006). All of the subsequent burns were conducted in the fall
and were low-intensity. Fire was applied directly to ﬁne fuels
produced by herbaceous growth (Moore et al., 2006). Most of
the combustion in these subsequent burns occurred in ﬁne
herbaceous fuels, leaf litter, and coarse woody debris on the
forest ﬂoor.
In the ﬁrst growing season after treatment, thinning
increased soil water content which led to greater water uptake
by old trees as indicated by higher predawn water potential
(Stone et al., 1999). Thinning also increased leaf nitrogen
content (mass area1) of the old trees, which combined with
greater water availability, increased stomatal conductance and
net photosynthetic rate. Tree canopy growth also responded
positively to thinning after one growing season; thinning
increased length of current-year leaves by 12% and mass of
terminal buds by 53% (Stone et al., 1999).
Old trees in the thinned alone and thinned + burned
treatments at GPNA had similar water relations and rates of
leaf
gas
exchange,
but
burning
affected
leaf
nitrogen
concentration. One and 2 years after the ﬁrst prescribed burn,
leaf nitrogen concentration (mass mass1) was higher for trees
in the thinned + burned treatment compared with the thinned
alone treatment (Feeney et al., 1998). However, the opposite
result occurred after the second prescribed burn; leaf nitrogen
concentration was greater for trees in the thinned alone
treatment than the thinned + burned treatment (Wallin et al.,
2004). The ﬁrst prescribed burn was the ﬁrst ﬁre at the GPNA
since 1876, and it likely caused a pulse of plant-available
nitrogen from mineralization associated with ﬁre (Covington
and Sackett, 1986, 1992; Kaye et al., 1999). Trees at the GPNA
may have been especially responsive to the pulse of mineralized
nitrogen considering the slow rate of nitrogen mineralization at
the GPNA in the absence of restoration treatments (Kaye and
Hart, 1998). The negative impact of the second prescribed burn
on tree leaf nitrogen concentration compared with the thinned
only treatment may reﬂect losses of nitrogen from the site due
to volatilization that exceeded nitrogen mineralization (e.g.,
Wright and Hart, 1997).

Increased resource uptake by old trees in the thinned plots at
the GPNA ultimately resulted in greater stem radial growth.
Fig. 5 shows an update of an earlier analysis of the growth
response of old trees at the GPNA (Feeney et al., 1998). Basal
area increment of old trees did not differ signiﬁcantly among
the treatment plots before treatment (1984–1993), in the year of
treatment (1994), nor in the ﬁrst post-treatment year (1995)
(Fig. 5). Starting with the second post-treatment year in 1996,
trees in the thinned only and thinned + burned treatments
typically had signiﬁcantly greater increment than trees in the
control treatment (Fig. 5). The only exception was the severe
drought year of 2002 when increment was similar in all
treatments. Increment was similar in the thinned only and
thinned + burned treatments in all years, except 2003 when
increment was higher in the thinned + burned treatment. A
signiﬁcant treatment  year interaction in increment (Fig. 5)
resulted primarily from the larger negative effect of the 2002
drought on increment in the thinned only and thinned + burned
treatments than the control.
Positive effects of the restoration treatments on resource
uptake and growth of old trees at the GPNA are consistent with
temporal changes in crown condition. Fig. 6 shows an update of
an earlier analysis of crown condition at the GPNA (Kolb et al.,
2001). Dieback in the upper crown was non-signiﬁcantly less
for trees in both thinned treatments than for trees in the control
treatment in 2004, 10 years after thinning (Fig. 6). Comparison
of the change in crown dieback over the 10 post-treatment
years (1994–2004) shows an increase in dieback on trees in
the control plot and a decrease (thinned) or no change
(thinned + burned) in the treated plots (Fig. 6). Mortality of old
trees at the GPNA over the 10 post-treatment years was 5.1% (3
of 59 trees) in the control, 8.1% (3 of 37 trees) in the thinned
treatment, and 5.6% (3 of 53 trees) in the thinned + burned
treatment.
Broad
inferences
about
treatment
effects
on
mortality at the GPNA are limited by the small sample size,
but our observations suggest greater incidence of tree mortality
due to wind throw and stem breakage in the thinned treatments
than the control. Between 1994 and 2002, three old trees in the
thinned treatments broke or toppled during severe winter
storms, whereas no mortality due to the storms occurred in the
control (Kolb et al., 2001). In contrast, tree mortality in the
control was preceded by a gradual decline of crown condition.
There is no evidence that careful, well-implemented
thinning causes long-term stress to old ponderosa pine in
Arizona or elsewhere. Thinning shock, or a negative effect of
thinning on tree condition (Harrington and Reukema, 1983;
Aussenac, 2000), has been documented in northern Arizona
only for small, suppressed ponderosa pines as a reduction in
sapwood hydraulic conductance per unit leaf area and canopy
conductance after thinning during extreme drought (Simonin

Area in northern Arizona was simulated by thinning treatments, and increment

treatments. The vertical line shows the year of treatment. The P-values are from
repeated measures MANOVA for the post-treatment years. Asterisk (*) indi-
cates signiﬁcant (P < 0.05) differences among treatments in ANOVA by year.

Natural Area in northern Arizona in year 2004, 10 years after treatment, was
slightly greater in control compared with thinned alone and thinned plus

between 1994 and 2004 (B), whereas dieback decreased (thinned) or did not
change (thinned + burned) in the thinned treatments. The P-values are from
ANOVA. Different letters indicate statistically signiﬁcant differences among
treatments (LSD, P < 0.05). The vertical bar shows one standard error of the

et al., 2006). This type of thinning shock occurred only in the
1st year after thinning, and thinning stimulated conductance in
the 2nd year after thinning.
4.2.2. Oregon
Two studies in Oregon have been published recently on the
response of old ponderosa pine to thinning treatments. In the
ﬁrst study (Latham and Tappeiner, 2002), old ponderosa pines,
Douglas-ﬁr, and sugar pines (Pinus lambertiana) in western
Oregon increased diameter growth in response to thinning of
understory trees or shelterwood thinnings compared with trees
in untreated, control stands. The onset of increased growth after
thinning for the old trees was often delayed and varied from 5 to
25 years after thinning. Thinning increased growth by 10% or
more for 68% of trees, and by 50% or more for 30% of trees.
Thinning decreased growth of only 1.5% of trees, which is
consistent with studies of ponderosa pine in northern Arizona
(Skov et al., 2005) that found little evidence of thinning shock
in old ponderosa pine.
The second recent study in Oregon (McDowell et al., 2003)
provides additional understanding of physiological mechan-
isms of the response of old ponderosa pine to thinning. This
study compared BAI and water, carbon, and nitrogen relations
of old trees between untreated stands and stands treated with
shelterwood cuts that reduced basal
area 61–82%. A
retrospective reconstruction of leaf gas exchange in both
types of stands modeled from carbon isotope ratios in tree
rings and level–level gas exchange (McDowell et al., 2003)
suggested that net photosynthetic rate (Fig. 7A) and stomatal
conductance (Fig. 7B) increased in the 1st year after thinning
and were elevated above rates of trees in unthinned stands for
at least 15 years after thinning. Basal area increment (Fig. 7C)
increased by two- to three-fold after thinning, and the increase
was sustained for up to 15 years after thinning. The increase in
BAI after thinning lagged behind the increase in net
photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance by 2 years
(Fig. 7A–C). Thinning increased tree predawn water potential
15 years after treatment, indicating an increase in soil water
content in the rooting zone, but had no effect on leaf nitrogen
concentration (McDowell et al., 2003). These results show
that heavy thinning can increase radial growth, water uptake,
and leaf gas exchange of old ponderosa pine for at least 15
years
after
treatment
if
stand
leaf
area
is
not
fully
reestablished.
4.2.3. Montana
Visual symptoms of decline of old ponderosa pine in the
Blackfoot River Valley in Montana in the early 1980s prompted
the experimental application of thinning and prescribed burning
to improve the vigor and survival of old trees (Fiedler, 2000).
The thinning treatment in 1984 removed most understory
‘‘ladder’’ fuels, including most Douglas-ﬁr. Half of the thinned
plots were prescribed burned in the fall after thinning. Thinning
of understory trees, with and without prescribed burning,
reduced mortality of old trees compared with the unthinned
controls (Fiedler, 2000). Mortality was 5.5-fold greater in
control than in thinned or thinned and burned plots. Thinning
also increased diameter growth of the old trees by about 2.6-
fold.
5. Management impacts on resistance of old ponderosa
pine to insect attack
The ultimate measure of tree resistance to bark beetles is
survival after bark beetle attacks. Large numbers of lethal bark
beetle attacks occur episodically in ponderosa pine forests;
however, such attacks rarely occur during experimental studies
Fig. 7. Net photosynthetic rate (A), stomatal conductance (B), and basal area
increment (C) from a study of old ponderosa pine in central Oregon (McDowell
et al., 2003) shows that thinning stimulated leaf gas exchange and radial growth
1 year after thinning, and increases growth 4 years after thinning. The shelter-
wood stand was thinned in 1987, and the neighboring control stand was never
thinned. Net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance were modeled using
tree-ring carbon isotope ratios and leaf level gas exchange measurements of the
response of photosynthesis to internal CO2 concentration as described in
McDowell et al. (2003). Bars are one standard error of the mean.
T.E. Kolb et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 249 (2007) 141–157
149

(e.g., Larsson et al., 1983). Consequently, mechanisms of
resistance are typically measured to provide insight on
resistance and to measure the likelihood of tree survival
during attack. Resin, either released from storage in resin ducts
located in phloem and xylem at the time of attack (preformed or
constitutive resin), or synthesized in response to attack (induced
resin), is generally hypothesized to be the most important
mechanism of pine defense against initial attacks by bark
beetles at low beetle densities (Raffa and Berryman, 1983;
Lieutier, 2002). This hypothesis has been supported for young
ponderosa pine by a negative relationship between resin ﬂow
and attack success of western pine beetle (Smith, 1975). After a
successful initial attack, tree resistance to bark beetles depends
in part on the attack density and the extent that current
photosynthate can be quickly shifted to walling off blue-stain
fungi introduced by the beetles (Christiansen et al., 1987;
Franceschi et al., 2005).
A mixture of direct and indirect evidence suggests that
management actions that cause large increases in stem radial
growth rate of ponderosa pine also increase tree resistance to
lethal bark beetle attacks. Most of this evidence is for trees that
are younger than 100 years. Early research on the relationship
between radial growth and bark beetle resistance emphasized
the importance of tree vigor, deﬁned as wood production per
leaf area, with leaf area predicted from sapwood area (Larsson
et al., 1983; Mitchell et al., 1983; Waring and Pitman, 1985).
Attacks of mountain pine beetle decreased when vigor of
ponderosa (Larsson et al., 1983) and lodgepole (Pinus contorta)
pines (Mitchell et al., 1983) was greater than 100 g of wood
produced per meter square of leaf area. McDowell et al. (2007)
highlighted uncertainty in accurately predicting leaf area from
sapwood area, and thus vigor as deﬁned above, because of
changes in the ratio of leaf area to sapwood area with tree
competitive status (Simonin et al., 2006) and thinning
(McDowell et al., 2006). Instead, McDowell et al. (2007)
emphasized the use of more direct measurements of carbon
allocation to stem radial growth, such as BAI, to predict tree
carbon allocation to resin defenses in the stem.
The indirect evidence concerning positive effects of
management, especially thinning, on ponderosa pine resistance
to bark beetles is an association between stand structural
conditions and tree mortality or resin ﬂow after wounding.
Stand conditions associated with high mortality of young
ponderosa pine stands by mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus
ponderosae) in the inland western U.S. include high stand basal
area and tree density (Sartwell and Stevens, 1975; Dahlsten and
Rowney, 1983; Cochran and Barrett, 1993; Olsen et al., 1996;
Fettig et al., 2007) which are known to reduce diameter growth
(e.g., Larsson et al., 1983; McDowell et al., 2006). Probability
of lethal attacks by mountain pine beetle (Negron and Popp,
2004) and roundheaded pine beetle (Dendroctonus adjunctus)
increases with stand density and decreases with radial growth
rate for ponderosa pine (Negron, 1997; Negron et al., 2000).
Consistent with these reports, ﬂow of preformed resin from
phloem wounds, a key defense of many conifers against bark
beetles (Smith, 1975; Raffa and Berryman, 1982, 1983), was
positively related to BAI in a region-wide synthesis of ﬁve
studies of ponderosa pine in northern Arizona (McDowell et al.,
2007).
The direct evidence for a role of management in enhancing
resistance of ponderosa pine to bark beetles consists of changes
in bark beetle attacks, tree survival, or resistance mechanisms
following experimental manipulation of tree density or stand
basal area. Increased radial growth of young ponderosa pine in
heavily thinned stands has been linked to fewer attacks and
consequent tree mortality by mountain pine beetle in Oregon
(Fig. 8) and South Dakota (Fettig et al., 2007), and greater resin
ﬂow from phloem wounds in Arizona (Kolb et al., 1998).
However, heavy thinning (ca. 50% basal area) in Montana did
not increase resin ﬂow in June in spite of increases in radial
growth (Peters, 2003). Similarly, relatively light (reduction of
basal area by <30%) and infrequent thinning of young
ponderosa pine stands can stimulate radial growth slightly, but
is not effective at stimulating resin ﬂow (Zausen et al., 2005).
With some exceptions, these results for young ponderosa
pine are consistent with the hypothesis that trees in low density
stands have greater resources, especially carbohydrates, to
allocate to both radial growth and tissues bearing large numbers
of resin ducts, such as phloem and xylem (Waring and
Schlesinger, 1985; Christiansen et al., 1987). Other studies on
young ponderosa pine suggest no strong trade-off between
above-ground growth and differentiation processes, such as
terpene concentration and resin production (Johnson et al.,
1997; Gaylord et al., 2007). The lack of evidence for a strong
trade-off between carbon allocation to growth versus resin for
young ponderosa pine is not consistent with several reports for
loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) that water stress shifts carbon
allocation from growth to resin defenses and results in a
positive relationship between stress and resin ﬂow (Lorio, 1986;
Blanche et al., 1992; Dunn and Lorio, 1993). The difference in
Fig. 8. The percentage of young ponderosa pine attacked by the mountain pine
beetle decreased linearly with a decrease in stand basal area in a thinning
experiment in central Oregon (derived from Larsson et al., 1983). The basal area
levels were established by thinning 15 years prior to the measurement of bark
beetle attacks and were maintained by periodic thinnings. The vertical bars
show one standard error of the mean. Three stands were sampled for all thinned
stands (basal area less than 40 m2 ha1), and nine stands were sampled for the
unthinned control (basal area = 54 m2 ha1).

results between loblolly pine and ponderosa pine may be
explained by the different location of stress for each species on
the bell-shaped relationship between carbon allocation to resin
defense and water stress that has been described as the
‘‘growth-differentiation hypothesis’’ (Lorio, 1986, 1993; Lorio
et al., 1990; Herms and Mattson, 1992). Studies of loblolly pine
have compared resin ﬂow between low and moderate water
stress on this bell-shaped curve – thus stress and resin were
positively related, whereas studies of ponderosa pine have
compared resin ﬂow between moderate and high water stress –
thus stress and resin were negatively related.
Investigations at the GPNA in northern Arizona and Crater
Lake National Park in Oregon have highlighted the inﬂuence of
low-intensity prescribed burning on resin defenses of old
ponderosa pine. At the GPNA, resin ﬂow in response to
wounding of the phloem for measurements taken in June two,
three, and 7 years after treatment was higher for trees in the
thinned + burned treatment than the thinned alone and control
treatments (Feeney et al., 1998; Wallin et al., 2004). Higher
resin ﬂow for trees in the thinned + burned treatment may have
resulted from stimulation of resin production in response to
wounding of cambium or phloem by the understory burns, as
has been reported for other pines (e.g., Santoro et al., 2001;
Lombardero et al., 2006).
A recent study at Crater Lake National Park in Oregon
(Perrakis and Agee, 2006) reported similar results on effects of
prescribed burning on resin ﬂow from old ponderosa pine. Both
fall and spring prescribed burns increased resin ﬂow in the ﬁrst
and second summers after treatment compared with unburned
controls. The same burning treatments also increased tree
mortality attributed to western pine beetle attacks, as has been
found in other recent studies of prescribed ﬁre in ponderosa pine
forests in Arizona and New Mexico (Wallin et al., 2004; Breece,
2006).Theseresultsindicate thatsome speciesofbark beetlesare
attracted to burned stands and are successful at colonizing trees
even when burning increases resin defenses, and suggest that tree
resistance to bark beetles in burned stands cannot be predicted
solely by quantitative changes in resin defenses.
Studies at the GPNA in northern Arizona also have
investigated
effects
of
management
treatments
on
leaf
toughness, an important resistance mechanism against foli-
age-feeding insects, such as pine sawﬂies (McMillin and
Wagner, 1993; Wagner and Zhang, 1993). Both thinning and
thinning + burning
treatments
consistently
increased
leaf
toughness of old trees compared to trees in the control (Feeney
et al., 1998; Wallin et al., 2004). This result suggests reduced
performance of foliage-feeding insect on trees in thinned
treatments, but this
has not been veriﬁed
with insect
performance experiments. Tougher foliage appears to be a
long-term effect of thinning at the GPNA as it was consistent in
all measurements between one and 7 years after thinning.
6. Management amelioration of drought impacts on old
ponderosa pine
Increases in mortality of both ponderosa pine (http://
www.fs.fed.us/r3/resources/health/beetle/index.shtml) and pin-
yon pine (Pinus edulis) (Breshears et al., 2005; Shaw et al., 2005)
have been reported during drought over the last decade (1996–
2006) in the Southwest U.S. We utilized 3-PG, a physiologically
based tree growth model (Landsberg and Waring, 1997), to
contrast the implications of a reduction of nearly 50% in annual
precipitation recorded near Los Alamos, New Mexico between
the period from 1996 to 1999 (mean, 490 mm year1) and 2000
to 2003 (mean, 260 mm year1) on tree growth. The model
predicted a one-third reduction in tree growth and a proportional
reduction in maximum leaf area index (LAI) from 2.1 to 1.4.
Similar reductions in the normalized difference vegetation index
have been reported in the region during severe drought
(Breshears et al., 2005). Self-thinning would necessarily
increase, because, according to the widely applied 3/2 power
law, the maximum standing biomass at which mortality begins is
a function of maximum LAI (Landsberg and Waring, 1997). This
simulation result suggest that the increased frequency of severe
droughts that are predicted to occur with future climate change
(Houghton et al., 2001; Coquard et al., 2004) will increase
mortality of ponderosa pine in old-growth stands. This mortality
can be reduced by thinning that reduces the high LAI of many
current stands of 2.0 or greater by at least 33%. Removing
younger trees by thinning will increase water available to old
trees during drought (e.g., Feeney et al., 1998; McDowell et al.,
2003; Wallin et al., 2004) and likely reduce their mortality.
Results from the GPNA in northern Arizona provide insight
on how thinning treatments and drought interact to affect the
performance of old trees. The second growing season after
thinning,
1995,
was
unusually
wet
with
winter–spring
precipitation 42% higher than average. A severe drought
occurred in 1996 with winter–spring precipitation 60% lower
than average. The effect of thinning on net photosynthetic rate
and BAI varied between years (Feeney et al., 1998). Thinning
had little effect on net photosynthetic rate and BAI (Fig. 5) in
the wet year (1995). In contrast, thinning increased photo-
synthesis compared with the control during the driest weeks of
the drought year (1996) (Feeney et al., 1998), and also
increased annual BAI (Fig. 5). Similar interactions between
drought and the early response (i.e., within 3 years of treatment)
of photosynthesis to thinning treatments for old ponderosa pine
have been reported in related studies in northern Arizona (Skov
et al., 2004). These results suggest that increases in water
availability to old trees for at least the ﬁrst few years after
thinning ameliorates the negative effect of severe drought on
tree photosynthesis and radial growth.
Effects of thinning on sensitivity of radial growth to drought
of old trees likely varies with drought severity and changes in
tree architecture induced by thinning. Fig. 5 from the GPNA
illustrates this inﬂuence. The 1996 drought, which occurred in
the third growing season after thinning, had a greater negative
effect on BAI of trees in the control than both thinned
treatments, and BAI was greater during the drought in the
thinned treatments than the control. In contrast, the more severe
2002 drought had a greater negative effect on BAI of trees in
both thinned treatments than the control (Fig. 5). The greater
sensitivity of growth to the 2002 drought for trees in the thinned
treatments resulted in similar BAI among treatments.

Changes in tree architecture after thinning may explain the
variable effects of thinning on sensitivity of radial growth to
drought. A recent study on young, mature ponderosa pine in
northern Arizona showed that periodic thinning increased the
ratio of leaf area to sapwood area (McDowell et al., 2006). This
architectural shift of trees in thinned stands results in increased
canopy demand for water relative to supply via the sapwood,
which predisposes trees to severe leaf-level hydraulic (and
hence photosynthetic) limitation during drought relative to
trees in unthinned stands. The increase in the ratio of leaf area to
sapwood area with thinning was documented by McDowell
et al. (2006) about four decades after the onset of decadal
thinnings applied to 40-year-old, pole-size trees. The occur-
rence of this type of response to thinning for old trees is unclear
as studies of long-term architectural responses of old trees to
thinning have not been conducted. However, the same response
to thinning for old trees at the GPNA over one decade after
thinning would explain the increasing sensitivity of BAI to
drought for trees in thinned plots (Fig. 5).
Overall, results from the GPNA and related studies in
northern Arizona (Feeney et al., 1998; Skov et al., 2004, 2005;
McDowell et al., 2006) suggest that thinning reduces impacts of
severe water stress on photosynthesis and growth immediately
after treatment, but may actually increase the relative impact of
drought on growth (i.e., percent change between non-drought
and drought years) decades following treatment because of
slow adjustments in tree leaf area to sapwood area ratio.
However, this is a relative response, i.e., trees in thinned stands
may show greater drought-related decreases than trees with low
growth rates, but may still may higher absolute growth. Trees in
heavily thinned stands typically have greater absolute BAI than
trees in unthinned stands in both drought and non-drought years
(Feeney et al., 1998; McDowell et al., 2003, 2006; Fig. 5).
Therefore, resilience of growth to drought appears to be greater
for trees in thinned than unthinned stands.
7. Management implications and recommendations for
perpetuating old ponderosa pine
Our review provides evidence that careful management of
old-growth ponderosa pine forests whose current stand
structure deviates from historic conditions due to the effects
of grazing and ﬁre exclusion often enhances resource uptake
and growth of old trees in the short term (up to 10 years). One
might conclude that management involving thinning and
burning of all old-growth ponderosa pine forests is in order.
However, such management should be carefully considered.
First, there is evidence that not all ponderosa pine forests are
outside the historic range of variability, either because ﬁre
regimes were not completely disrupted (e.g., Grand Canyon;
Fule´ et al., 2003), or because some mixed-conifer forests
containing ponderosa pine historically had relatively high
density or infrequent ﬁres (e.g., Colorado Front Range; Brown
et al., 1999; Schoennagel et al., 2004). In such cases, thinning
for the purpose of restoring historic structure would not be
justiﬁed. Second, many old-growth forests in the western U.S.
are located in remote areas, where management often causes
unavoidable disturbances, such as road construction, soil
compaction, and exposure to mineral soil. Even in areas where
old-growth forests are clearly outside their range of natural
variability the pros and cons of management need to be
carefully weighted. For instance, road construction and
subsequent increased access could increase invasive species
(Korb, 2001), decrease native species diversity, alter ﬁre
regimes, or change resource availability (Levine et al., 2003).
Third, ﬁnancial costs of management treatments in old-growth
forests can be high because of the careful attention required to
individual trees. Finally, while long-term monitoring data is
lacking, increasing evidence suggests that disturbance asso-
ciated with harvesting may increase recruitment and density in
the long-term, which could be counter productive (Minnich
et al., 1995; Kaufmann et al., 2000). For instance, in an ongoing
study across Montana and central Idaho, tree density in never-
logged ponderosa pine stands not subjected to ﬁre for the last 60
years was on average over 40% lower than in paired stands
(n = 23 pairs) that had been subjected to historical logging
(Naﬁcy and Sala, unpublished data). These results serve only to
highlight the need to consider long-term effects of disturbance,
and the need for repeated maintenance actions, such as
prescribed ﬁre, prior to management actions.
We provide the following recommendations for the use of
thinning and burning in dry, old-growth ponderosa pine forests
where ﬁre exclusion has increased fuels over time and where
potential negative effects of management are minimized:
1. Results for removing the forest ﬂoor beneath old trees by
raking prior to prescribed ﬁre to reduce fuels and smoldering
combustion appear to be site speciﬁc. Raking appears to
ameliorate ﬁre damage to old trees on ﬁne-textured, basalt-
derived soils in northern Arizona, but results for other soils
are variable. Raking one or 2 years before burning may
ameliorate the immediate loss of ﬁne roots due to the raking
treatment before further ﬁne-root loss is incurred by burning.
2. Old ponderosa pine trees are often more prone to dying after
prescribed burns and wildﬁres than younger, mature trees.
Their death often occurs more slowly after burns than for
younger trees. Fuels should be reduced in the vicinity of old
trees prior to prescribed burns by thinning the understory and
removing the slash, or by compressing the slash to reduce ﬁre
intensity.
3. Resource uptake and growth of old trees can be increased by
careful thinning. Thinning often reduces water stress of old
trees starting one or 2 years after treatment. Radial growth
responses are slower, and often start several years to two
decades after thinning. Growth response to thinning is slower
for old trees than young trees. Stimulation of growth of old
trees by thinning can be negated by severe drought. However,
stimulation of growth by thinning returns shortly after
drought ceases. Overall, these results for old ponderosa pine
are consistent with a small, but growing number of
experiments showing that resource uptake and growth of
old trees of various species are responsive to thinning
(Bebber et al., 2004; Martinez-Vilalta et al., 2007). An
unresolved issue is whether stimulation of radial growth in
T.E. Kolb et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 249 (2007) 141–157
152

old, large trees increases their susceptibility to windthrow
and breakage due to an increase in above-ground mass or due
to increased exposure.
4. Reduction of stand leaf area by management treatments
should reduce mortality of old trees during severe drought
because of increased water availability to remaining trees.
5. Careful thinning does not often cause ‘‘thinning shock,’’ or a
negative physiological or growth response to thinning, in old
ponderosa pine.
6. Management treatments that cause large increases in carbon
allocation to radial xylem growth also increase carbon
allocation to constitutive resin defenses against bark beetle
attacks, based on studies with young ponderosa pine.
7. Prescribed, low-intensity burning that causes little crown
scorch can stimulate bole resin production in old trees. The
mechanism of this stimulation is not known. Such burning
also tends to attract bark beetles and can increase tree
mortality from beetle attacks.
