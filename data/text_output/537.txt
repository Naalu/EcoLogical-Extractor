ABSTRACT
Evapotranspiration (ET) comprises a major portion of the water budget in forests, yet few studies have measured or estimated ET
in semi-arid, high-elevation ponderosa pine forests of the south-western USA or have investigated the capacity of models to
predict ET in disturbed forests. We measured actual ET with the eddy covariance (eddy) method over 4 years in three ponderosa
pine forests near Flagstaff, Arizona, that differ in disturbance history (undisturbed control, wildﬁre burned, and restoration
thinning) and compared these measurements (415–510 mm year1 on average) with actual ET estimated from ﬁve meteorological
models [Penman–Monteith (P-M), P-M with dynamic control of stomatal resistance (P-M-d), Priestley–Taylor (P-T),
McNaughton–Black (M-B), and Shuttleworth–Wallace (S-W)] and from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
(MODIS) ET product. The meteorological models with constant stomatal resistance (P-M, M-B, and S-W) provided the most
accurate estimates of annual eddy ET (average percent differences ranged between 11 and 14%), but their accuracy varied
across sites. The P-M-d consistently underpredicted ET at all sites. The more simplistic P-T model performed well at the control
site (18% overprediction) but strongly overpredicted annual eddy ET at the restoration sites (92%) and underpredicted at the ﬁre
site (26%). The MODIS ET underpredicted annual eddy ET at all sites by at least 51% primarily because of underestimation of
leaf area index. Overall, we conclude that with accurate parameterization, micrometeorological models can predict ET within
30% in forests of the south-western USA and that remote sensing-based ET estimates need to be improved through use of higher
resolution products. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

INTRODUCTION
Forests occur over approximately 31% of the land surface
of the Earth (FAO, 2012) and are important regulators of
terrestrial water balance (Arora, 2002; Ueyama et al.,
2010). Evapotranspiration (ET) is the largest ﬂux of annual
precipitation from most forests except in cool and wet
climate zones. For example, ET has been reported to use
approximately 70% of annual precipitation in a loblolly
pine (Pinus taeda) plantation in the south-eastern USA
(Sun et al., 2002), more than 85% in a Canadian black
spruce (Picea mariana) forest (Arain et al., 2003), and
more than 85% in a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)
forest in Arizona (Dore et al., 2012). Consequently, the
magnitude and seasonality of forest ET are important
regulators of water resources available to humans and
ecosystems.
The question of how forest management affects ET is
long standing (e.g. Bosch and Hewlett, 1982) but is still not
adequately answered for many forest types. This question
is increasingly relevant to current restoration projects in
semi-arid forests that use tree thinning to reduce the risk of
wildﬁre (e.g. Covington et al., 1997; Agee and Skinner,
2005; McIver et al., 2013). Studies in other forest types
report that reforestation generally increases ET (Bosch and
Hewlett, 1982; Trabucco et al., 2008), whereas deforesta-
tion decreases ET (Nobre et al., 1991; Bala et al., 2007;

Costa et al., 2010; Krishnaswamy et al., 2012; Lathuillière
et al., 2012; Bright et al., 2013). Impacts on ET of more
subtle changes in forest cover produced by tree thinning
have been investigated at only a few sites (Moreaux et al.,
2011; Dore et al., 2012).
More information on impacts to ET of forest restoration
thinning and of intense wildﬁre, which often occurs in
dense semi-arid forests in the absence of thinning (e.g.
Finney et al., 2005), is needed for upland forest landscapes.
These forests are critical for supplying water to downslope
ecosystems and human settlements (e.g. Troendle, 1983)
and are the targets of major new management initiatives.
Landscape-scale forest restoration treatments (e.g. Coving-
ton et al., 1997) are planned for 1.5 million ha of semi-arid,
dense ponderosa pine forests in upland watersheds of
Arizona (USDA Forest Service, 2012). Because the impact
of vegetation manipulation on ET is highly variable in
semi-arid regions (Bosch and Hewlett, 1982; Stednick,
1996; Brown et al., 2005; Huxman et al., 2005), better
understanding of the coupled land management and
hydrological response processes is needed.
A major challenge to understanding impacts of forest
management actions on ET arises from the difﬁculty in
estimating ET accurately over large areas. Forest ET can be
measured by numerous methods, such as site water
balance, lysimeters, sap ﬂow, Bowen ratio, and plant
chambers (Jackson et al., 2000; Moncrieff et al., 2000), but
the eddy covariance (eddy) approach is considered to be
accurate (Wilson et al., 2001; Baldocchi and Ryu, 2011;
Barr et al., 2012). Despite advances in ET measurement by
the eddy approach, accurate estimation of annual ET in
forests using this approach remains challenging over broad
landscapes because of the difﬁculty of establishing and
maintaining eddy systems in remote locations and the
inﬂuence of complex topography that can prevent adequate
measurement of energy balance closure (Baldocchi et al.,
1988; Foken, 2008; Reba et al., 2009). To overcome these
challenges, models that predict ET from site and climate
data have been used, and ET predictions from these models
have been compared with eddy ET for coniferous forests in
several studies (e.g. Federer et al., 1996; Cienciala et al.,
1998; Sun et al., 2002; Fisher et al., 2005).
Comparisons of modelled and measured ET have
generally used only short time series, have neither
included multiple years nor included recently disturbed
forests (e.g. Fisher et al., 2005) nor focused on forests
with complex climatic inﬂuences on the seasonality of ET,
such as is the case in the south-western USA, where the
bimodal precipitation regime of winter snow and late-
summer rainfall is punctuated by a distinct dry season, and
inter-annual variability in precipitation is pronounced
(Sheppard et al., 2002). Modelling ET is known to be
challenging in seasonally water-stressed forests because
most models use energy availability as the primary control
on ET (Law et al., 2000; Gordon and Famiglietti, 2004;
Morales et al., 2005). Estimation of ET from remotely
sensed spectral data, such as the Moderate Resolution
Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite (Yuan et al.,
2010; Mu et al., 2011; Goulden et al., 2012), is another
approach that has potential application in investigations of
forest water balance, but more site-speciﬁc comparisons to
eddy ET are needed to assess accuracy. Although the
spatial resolution of MODIS ET products (1 km2) often
does not match the ﬂux tower footprint coverage (Goulden
et al., 2012), MODIS provides spatially and temporally
continuous data of land surface and atmosphere interac-
tions (Wan, 2008).
The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy
of ET predictions from ﬁve meteorological models and the
MODIS ET product over 4years at three sites in the
ponderosa pine forest region of northern Arizona that have
different types of recent disturbance. We compare ET
predictions from these models with ET measured directly
at each site by the eddy covariance approach (Dore et al.,
2012). The sites consist of (1) a dense, unmanaged forest,
(2) a similar forest treated with restoration thinning, and
(3) a former forest that was converted to grassland by
intense wildﬁre. The meteorological models that we used
have shown potential for accurate ET prediction (e.g.
Fisher et al., 2005; Morales et al., 2005), yet they have not
been adequately evaluated for the ponderosa pine region of
the south-western USA where landscape-scale forest
restoration treatments are being implemented and intense
wildﬁres are common. The meteorological models that we
investigated are Penman–Monteith (P-M), P-M with
dynamic stomatal resistance (P-M-d), Priestley–Taylor
(P-T), McNaughton–Black (M-B), and Shuttleworth–
Wallace (S-W).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Study sites
We used three study sites located within the ponderosa-
pine-dominated forest region of northern Arizona that
differ in disturbance and for which ET was measured with
the eddy covariance method over several years by Dore
et al. (2008, 2010, 2012). The three sites (control, ﬁre, and
restoration) were located less than 35 km apart near
Flagstaff, AZ, USA. Site characteristics were described in
detail by Dore et al. (2010). In brief, the control site was a
ponderosa pine stand located in the Northern Arizona
University Centennial Forest (35°5′20.5″N, 111°45′43.33″
W, elevation 2180 m a.s.l.) that was excluded from
harvesting, thinning, and ﬁre over the last century. The
control site had an average leaf area index (LAI; projected
area) of 2.3m2m2, basal area of 30 m2ha1, and tree
density of 853 trees ha1 (Dore et al., 2010). The ﬁre site
W. HA et al.

was part of a 10 500-ha area in the Coconino National
Forest (35°26′43.43″N, 111°46′18.64″W, elevation
2270 ma.s.l.) burned by an intense ﬁre in 1996. The ﬁre
killed all trees in the stand, which prior to the ﬁre had tree
density and basal area similar to the control site (Dore
et al., 2010). No ponderosa pine was regenerated in this
site. During the measurement period, more than a decade
after the ﬁre, vegetation on the ﬁre site consisted of grasses,
forbs, and shrubs, with average ground cover of 40%
vegetation, 50% bare soil, and 10% snags and logs
(Montes-Helu et al., 2009). The restoration site was a
ponderosa pine stand located in the Centennial Forest (35°
8′33.48″N, 111°43′38.37″W, 2155 ma.s.l.) about 6 km
from the control site that was treated with fuel-reduction
thinning in 2006, several months before the measurements
reported in this study. To reduce tree density and ﬁre risk
and to restore pre-settlement forest structure, approximately
90 ha of the restoration site was thinned in September 2006.
The treatment focused on removal of small-diameter trees
and reduced tree density 70%, basal area 35%, tree LAI
40%, and stand LAI (including understory) 30%. Canopy
height was approximately 18 m at the control and
restoration sites and approximately 0.3m at the ﬁre site
(Dore et al., 2010). Climatic and edaphic conditions at the
three sites were similar because of their close proximity.
The region is characterized by cold winters and dry springs
with precipitation as snow in the winter and rain in late
summer.
Eddy covariance measurements
Fluxes of water vapour, sensible and latent heats (H and LE),
net solar radiation (Rn), and soil heat ﬂux (G) were measured
continuously with the eddy covariance (eddy) method
between 2007 and 2010 at each site using identical
instruments and sensors. The eddy instruments and methods
are described in detail by Dore et al. (2008, 2010, 2012).
Instrumentation included a sonic anemometer (CSAT3,
Campbell Scientiﬁc, Logan, UT, USA) for measurement of
wind velocity; a closed-path CO2/H2O infrared gas analyser
(LI-COR Li-7000, Lincoln, NE, USA) for measurement of
water vapour density; incoming and outgoing short-wave
and long-wave radiometers (CNR1, Kipp and Zonen, Delft,
the Netherlands) for measurement of global and net
radiation; a photosynthetic photon ﬂux density (PPFD)
sensor (BF3 Delta-T devices, Cambridge, UK); a reﬂected
PPFD sensor (LI-COR Li-190); precipitation sensors
(5.4103.20.041, Thies Clima, Göttingen, Germany; TR-
525-R3 gauge, Texas Instruments, USA); a weather
transmitter (WXT510, Vaisala, Helsinki, Finland) for
measurement of atmospheric pressure, air humidity, and
air temperature; volumetric water content sensors (model
615, Campbell Scientiﬁc, USA); soil temperature probes
(model 107, Campbell Scientiﬁc, USA); and soil heat ﬂux
plates (Hukseﬂux HFP01SC, Delft, the Netherlands). The
eddy instruments were mounted on towers 23 m above
ground surface at the control and restoration sites and 2.5m
above ground surface at the ﬁre site (Dore et al., 2008). Soil
temperature and water content were measured at depths of 2,
10, 20, and 50 cm, and soil heat ﬂux was measured at a depth
of 8 cm. All data were collected and stored by CR-1000 and
CR-10X dataloggers (Campbell Scientiﬁc, USA) and
averaged over 30-min intervals. Methods for processing
and gap ﬁlling of the eddy data are described in Dore et al.
(2008, 2010). Energy balance closure is a comparison of
available energy (Rn G) and turbulent heat ﬂuxes (LE + H)
and is necessary for long-term ﬂux measurements
(Baldocchi et al., 1996). We calculated energy balance
closure of the eddy data for all 4 years of our study
(2007–2010) for daily gap-ﬁlled data following Aubinet
et al. (2000).
Meteorological models
We used ﬁve previously developed meteorological models
that have been shown to be useful for predicting ET of
vegetated sites (Federer et al., 1996; Fisher et al., 2005).
All of these models predict potential ET (PET), which we
scaled to actual ET (AET) using a soil moisture limitation
factor (Fisher et al., 2005), except for the P-M-d model,
which directly predicts AET. The models, which differ in
input data and complexity, are brieﬂy described in the
succeeding texts. Model input parameters introduced
in this section are listed in Table A in the Supporting
Information.
P-M model. The P-M model (Monteith, 1965) improved
the earlier Penman model (Penman, 1948) by including
effects of canopy stomatal resistance (rs) and above-canopy
aerodynamic resistance (ra) on PET. The P-M equation is

where λE is PET as evaporative LE ﬂux (W m2), Δ is the
slope of saturated vapour pressure and air temperature (hPa
°C1), Rn is the net solar radiation ﬂux (W m2), G is the
soil heat ﬂux (W m2), ρ is the air density of 1.23kg m3,
Cρ is the speciﬁc heat of air, which is equal to
approximately 1006 Jkg1 °C1, es is the saturation vapour
pressure (kPa), e is the vapour pressure (kPa), ϒ is the
psychrometric constant (hPa °C1), rs is the bulk stomatal
resistance of the canopy (s m1; 416.67 for control and
restoration sites and 210.0 for the ﬁre site), and ra is the
aerodynamic resistance above the canopy (sm1; 6.0 for
control and restoration sites and 30.0 for the ﬁre site). Data
used are attached in the Supporting Information. The term
es e is known as the vapour pressure deﬁcit (kPa).

P-M model with dynamic stomatal resistance. This model
enhanced the P-M model by including environmental
controls on canopy resistance, which is the inverse of
canopy conductance ðgsÞ. These controls for our study were
taken from Stewart’s (1988) investigation of a pine forest
near Thetford Forest, Norfolk, UK, that quantiﬁed
relationships between gs and four environmental variables,
incident short-wave solar radiation (Kin), speciﬁc humidity

where gs is the canopy conductance (m s1), fs is the shelter
factor that represents the degree of sheltered portions of the
leaves from the sun and wind, LAI is the LAI, g
leaf is the
maximum value of leaf conductance (m s1; 5.3× 103 for
control and restoration sites and 8.0× 103 for the ﬁre site),
and fk, fρ, fT, and fθ are functions of environmental variables
explained previously (Stewart, 1988; Dingman, 2002). We
used site-speciﬁc fs, LAI, and input environmental data to
calculate gs in Equation 2 for each time period. The fs
values were 0.65 for the control site, 0.85 for the
restoration site, and 1.0 for the ﬁre site. We calculated
atmospheric resistance (ra) for Equation 1 following

where ga is the atmospheric conductance (m s1), u is the
wind speed (m s1), zm is the height of wind speed
measurement at the top of the eddy tower, which is
approximately 2.5 m above the vegetation canopy (m), zd is
the zero-plane displacement (m), and z0 is the roughness
height (m).
P-T model. The Priestley and Taylor model (1972)
predicts PET based primarily on variation in net radiation
without formal use of wind velocity, stomatal or atmo-
spheric resistance, and vapour pressure data. The P-T ET
model is
λE ¼ αΔ

(4)
where α is the unitless ‘P-T coefﬁcient’, which adjusts PET
for differences in water availability, advection, and
aerodynamic resistance among surface and vegetation
types (Flint and Childs, 1991). The correct α value for a
given vegetation type is not known with certainty. The
constant α value of 1.26 suggested by Priestley and Taylor
(1972) for saturated surfaces is known to be inaccurate for
drier sites where dynamic values based on soil water
content (SWC) and often less than 1.0 are recommended
(Flint and Childs, 1991; Fisher et al., 2005). We calculated
daily α at each site with the Flint and Childs (1991)
approach using a regression equation developed by Fisher
et al. (2005) for a ponderosa pine forest in California:
α= 0.84·SWC + 0.72, where SWC equals soil volumetric
water content in the rooting zone. Soil volumetric water
content was measured every 30 min at each ﬂux tower
location (Dore et al., 2012) and averaged over depths of 2,
10, 20, and 50 cm to calculate α. We investigated
correspondence between ET predicted with the P-T model
and eddy ET for three temporal averaging approaches for
the calculation of α: daily averages, monthly averages, and
seasonal averages (January–March, April–June, July–
September, and October–December) for each year and site
combination. We found that all approaches produced
similar results based on root-mean-square error (RMSE),
coefﬁcient of determination (R2), and mean bias error
(MBE); thus, we used average seasonal α values over all
4years in our ﬁnal predictions of AET with the P-T model.
Seasonal average α ranged between 0.91 (October–
December 2009) and 1.08 (January–March 2008) at the
control site, 0.90 (October–December 2009) and 1.06
(January–March 2008) at the ﬁre site, and 1.08 (October–
December 2009) and 1.24 (January–March 2008 and 2009)
at the restoration site. Speciﬁc α values used in the ﬁnal P-
T model predictions are shown in Table B in the
Supporting Information. While others (Flint and Childs,
1991; Fisher et al., 2005) have suggested that adjustment of
α based on SWC is adequate for converting predictions
from the P-T model from PET to AET, we further adjusted
predictions of ET from the P-T model by a scaling factor
that expressed SWC as a fraction of SWC at ﬁeld capacity
(section on Conversion of PET to AET) to obtain ﬁnal
values of AET. This second adjustment produced AET
estimates from the P-T model that were closer to AET
measured by eddy covariance, likely because the modiﬁ-
cation of α based on SWC alone does not adequately
consider SWC at ﬁeld capacity.
M-B model. McNaughton and Black (1973) derived the
following equation that assumes that stomatal resistance of
the canopy, rs, is generally much larger than atmospheric
resistance, ra. The equation starts from the P-M equation
and assumes that ra is close to zero:
λE ¼ ρ Cp es  e
ð
Þ
ϒ  rs
(5)
These assumptions are made because well-documented
wind proﬁle data often are unavailable or inaccurate, which
could introduce error to the calculation of λE. The model
implies that vapour pressure deﬁcit controls diurnal
changes in ET over a small range of rs (McNaughton and
W. HA et al.

Ecohydrol. (2014)

Black, 1973). The model is theoretically valid only for
forest environments (Federer et al., 1996).
S-W model. Shuttleworth and Wallace (1985) improved
previous models, which were limited to a closed, stable,
and uniform canopy, by accounting for soil evaporation in
a model for sparse crops that separates soil evaporation
(λEs) from transpiration from the plant canopy (λEc). They
used a Monteith-type equation with horizontal averages of
energy ﬂuxes and resistance terms deﬁned for heteroge-
neous land cover. Total evaporation (λE) is modelled as
λE ¼ λEs þ λEc ¼ CsPMs þ CcPMc
(6)
where Cs and Cc are partitioning coefﬁcients, and PMs
and PMc are P-M-like terms to describe evaporation from
the soil substrate and a closed canopy, respectively. The
PMs term includes surface resistance at the soil ( rs
s ),
aerodynamic resistance leaving the soil surface before
incorporation into the mean canopy ﬂow (rs
a), and transfer
resistance between the mean canopy ﬂow and the screen
height (ra). The PMc term accounts for stomatal
resistance of the vegetation (rs) and bulk boundary layer
resistance of the vegetative elements in the canopy (rc
a)
and ra. The partitioning coefﬁcients and resistance terms
are parameterized for a sparse canopy based on LAI, a
vegetation-type-speciﬁc extinction coefﬁcient, wind
speed, and parameters describing the aerodynamic
characteristics and diffusivity of the canopy and soil.
Full equations for these terms are given by Shuttleworth
and Wallace (1985).
Conversion of PET to AET. PET data obtained from the
meteorological models were adjusted to AET prior to
comparison with ET data estimated by eddy covariance
except for the P-M-d model, which estimates AET directly
without the need for further adjustment. Based on the
modiﬁcation of the Saxton et al. (1986) method described
in Fisher et al. (2005), AET was calculated as PET
multiplied by a scaling parameter equal to the average
SWC over four depths (2, 10, 20, and 50 cm) divided by
ﬁeld capacity. Although ponderosa pine can have deep
roots in deep soils (approximately 150 cm; Vickers et al.,
2012), we averaged SWC over depths and assumed this
averaged value to represent SWC in the rooting depth
because our results were not sensitive to speciﬁc SWC
depth (data not shown) and because measurements of SWC
at depths greater than 50 cm were not possible at our sites
because of shallow bedrock. When SWC was greater than
ﬁeld capacity, AET was equal to PET. Site-speciﬁc values
of ﬁeld capacity, equal to volumetric SWC of 0.391, 0.395,
and 0.452 m3 m3, at the control, ﬁre, and restoration sites,
respectively, were calculated based on soil texture (Dore
et al., 2010) following Saxton et al. (1986).
MODIS-based remote sensing model
Forest canopy reﬂectance in the red and near-infrared
(NIR) regions can be related to indicators of forest
structure, providing a functional basis for LAI estimation.
Because of global coverage of imagery by the Terra and
Aqua MODIS at 1-km resolution and 8-day frequency,
estimates of green vegetation LAI and the fraction of
photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation
(FPAR) have been produced on a continuous basis since
the year 2000. This information is used to estimate ET
regionally and globally (Nagler et al., 2005; Allen et al.,
2007; Cleugh et al., 2007; Mu et al., 2007; Jung et al.,
2010; Yuan et al., 2010; Mu et al., 2011).
The MOD16 remote-sensing-based ET algorithm pre-
dicts ET globally at 86% accuracy when compared with
eddy measurements of ET over many sites in the
AmeriFlux network (Mu et al., 2011). Building on
previous algorithms, it uses a physically based P-M
approach driven by MODIS-derived vegetation data. ET
is calculated as the sum of daytime and night-time
components using vapour pressure deﬁcit and minimum
temperature to control stomatal resistance. Stomatal
resistance is scaled up to the canopy level using LAI to
calculate canopy resistance for plant transpiration. The
algorithm also models soil heat ﬂux and separates
evaporation from a wet canopy and transpiration from a
dry canopy. Actual soil evaporation is calculated from a
potential evaporation value. The required data inputs to the
MOD16 algorithm are (1) Collection 4 MODIS global land
cover maps (MOD12Q1; Friedl et al., 2002), (2) Collection
5 MODIS FPAR/LAI layers (MOD15A2; Myneni et al.,
2002), and (3) Collection 5 MODIS albedo products
(MCD43B2 and MCD43B3; Lucht et al., 2000). Daily
meteorological data inputs are from National Aeronautics
and Space Administration’s (NASA’s) Modern-Era Retro-
spective Analysis for Research and Applications Global
Modeling and Assimilation Ofﬁce (Goddard Earth Observ-
ing System Model, version 5). The global ET raster
datasets obtained from MOD16 are now available from the
University of Montana (ftp://ftp.ntsg.umt.edu/pub/MODIS/
NTSG_Products/MOD16/MOD16A3.105_MERRAG
MAO/Geotiff/) and NASA through the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory (ORNL) Distributed Active Archive Center
web data portal (http://daac.ornl.gov/MODIS/modis.html).
The available MODIS products have pixel resolution of
1km2 and cover 109 million km2 of vegetated land areas
globally at 8-day, monthly, and annual intervals since
2000. We obtained 1-km2 8-day MODIS AET products
between 2007 and 2009 for each study site from the ORNL
website to calculate monthly and annual ET (mm month1
and mmyear1). Annual ET was obtained by summing all
8-day AET per year, while monthly ET was obtained by
adding 8-day values that better corresponded to the month

of each year. Eight-day LAI data were also downloaded
from the same website and were averaged per year for
comparisons with measured LAI at three sites. The control,
ﬁre, and restoration ﬂux tower locations were overlaid to
MODIS product layers using ArcGIS to select the location
of pixels and to extract ET and LAI pixel values that
represented the land cover conditions of tower measure-
ments at each site. Data were extracted for only one pixel
per site because the eddy tower footprint approximately
matches the 1-km2pixel size of the MODIS data. For
control and ﬁre sites, the south-east pixel from the tower
location was selected to represent eddy tower footprint. For
the restoration site, the north-east pixel was selected. The
selected pixels had vegetation most similar to vegetation of
the measurement footprint of each eddy instrument tower
based on visual inspection of recent Google Earth images
(Figure A in the Supporting Information).
ET comparisons
We ran each meteorological model using both daily (24 h)
and average monthly environmental data for each site. The
environmental data for each site were obtained from the
eddy tower instruments and associated soil measurements
(Dore et al., 2012). We evaluated ﬁt between model-
predicted AET and eddy ET at daily and monthly scales
using RMSE, R2, and MBE. Patterns of results for
predictions based on monthly data were similar to results
based on daily data, and RMSE, R2, and MBE showed
better ﬁt of model-predicted values to eddy ET for
predictions based on monthly data. Thus, we do not
present predictions based on daily data for brevity. In
addition, we converted monthly data of eddy ET and AET
predicted by each of the ﬁve meteorological models from
LE to linear amount of water (mm month1) and then
summed over months to obtain annual values for each year
and site, which were compared with annual ET derived
from the MODIS product. Data analysis was performed in
R (R Core Team, 2013).
RESULTS
Energy balance closure
The fraction of energy balance closure for the eddy
measurements, deﬁned as (H + LE)/(Rn  G) (Wilson
et al., 2001; Amiro, 2009; Barr et al., 2012), averaged
over all years was 0.95, 1.12, and 0.78 for the control, ﬁre,
and restoration sites, respectively. Monthly values of LE
+ H were strongly correlated (R2 >0.9) with Rn G for all
years at each site (Figure 1). The slope of the linear
regression between LE + H and Rn G was 1.02, 1.10,
and 0.95 at the control, ﬁre, and restoration sites,
respectively.
AET from model simulation versus ET from eddy
covariance
Monthly AET. For monthly data pooled over all years
(Table I), the model with the highest R2 in comparisons
with eddy ET was the P-T model at the control and
restoration sites and the P-M-d model at the ﬁre site. RMSE
was lowest at the control site for the P-T model and at ﬁre
and restoration sites for the P-M model. At the control site,
the P-T and P-M-d models had similar strong predictive
performance (R2= 0.84, 0.81; RMSE =13.2, 18.5; respec-
tively). At the ﬁre site, all models had similar predictive
performance, with R2 ranging between 0.54 and 0.64 and
RMSE ranging between 14.7 and 26.2 among models. At
the restoration site, the P-T and P-M-d models had the best
predictive performance based on R2 (0.81 and 0.78,
respectively), whereas the P-M and M-B models had the
lowest RMSE (13.6 and 13.9, respectively).
Comparisons of MBE for monthly data (Table II)
showed that the P-M, M-B, and S-W models consistently
overpredicted monthly eddy ET at ﬁre and restoration sites
(0.62 to 13.77 mmmonth1), whereas the P-M-d model
consistently underpredicted at all sites (22.15 to
13.25mm month1). The P-T model overpredicted at
the control and restoration sites and underpredicted at the
ﬁre site. The two models producing the closest predictions
of monthly eddy ET based on the lowest MBE were P-T
and S-W at the control site, P-M and S-W at the ﬁre site,
and P-M and M-B at the restoration site (Table II).
All models simulated similar seasonal variation in
monthly AET, which was characterized by the highest
AET in the summer and the lowest AET in the winter
(Figure 2). At the control site, the P-M, M-B, and S-W
models consistently underpredicted monthly eddy ET
during all periods, the P-M-d model underpredicted eddy
ET in late winter and spring, and the P-T model
overpredicted eddy ET in late winter and spring (Figure 2).
At the ﬁre site, consistent overprediction by the P-M, M-B,
and S-W models in the spring and underprediction by the
P-M-d model also occurred. Predictions by the P-T model
at the ﬁre site ﬂuctuated between small overpredictions and
underpredictions. At the restoration site, the P-T model
overpredicted eddy ET the most, followed by S-W, P-M,
and M-B models. The P-M-d model consistently
underpredicted eddy ET at the restoration site (Table I).
MODIS AET also consistently underpredicted eddy ET at
all sites.
Scatter plots of monthly AET data show how model
prediction accuracy varied over the range of eddy ET. At
the control site (Figure 3), underprediction of eddy ET by
the P-M, M-B, and S-W models increased nonlinearly as
eddy ET increased, the P-M-d model consistently
underpredicted over the range of eddy ET, and the P-T
model tended to overpredict intermediate values of eddy

ET. At the ﬁre site (Figure 4), the P-M-d model
consistently underpredicted over the range of eddy ET,
and the P-M, M-B, and S-W models overpredicted
intermediate values of eddy ET. The P-T model
underpredicted high values of eddy ET at the ﬁre site.
At the restoration site (Figure 5), overprediction by the P-
T and S-W models generally increased as eddy ET
increased, and the P-M and M-B models underpredicted
the highest values of eddy ET. The P-M-d model
underpredicted intermediate and high values of eddy ET.

MODIS AET consistently underpredicted eddy ET at all
sites (Figures 3–5).
Annual AET. Annual eddy ET was highest among sites at
the control site for all years except 2010, when ET was
7 mmyear1 greater at the restoration site than at the
control site (Table III). Average eddy ET over all years was
19 and 9% lower at the ﬁre and restoration sites than at the
control site, respectively. Average normalized eddy ET
(annual total ET/annual total precipitation) was 0.85, 0.68,
and 0.80 at the control, ﬁre, and restoration sites,
respectively (Dore et al., 2012). Interestingly, average
annual precipitation was the highest at the ﬁre site
(568 mmyear1), although averaged eddy ET and normal-
ized eddy ET were the lowest (Table III).
At the control site, model-predicted annual AET was
closest to eddy ET for the S-W and P-T models. The S-W
model underestimated annual eddy ET by an average of
14%. The P-T model overestimated eddy ET by an average
of 18% (Table III). Predicted average annual ET for all
other models and the MODIS product at the control site
differed from eddy ET by at least 30%.
At the ﬁre site, model-predicted annual AET was closest
to eddy ET for the P-M model, which overestimated by an
average of 11%, and the S-W model, which overestimated
by an average of 15% (Table III). Predicted average annual
ET for all other models and the MODIS product at the ﬁre
site differed from eddy ET by at least 24%.
At the restoration site, model-predicted annual AET was
closest to eddy ET for the M-B model, which overpredicted
by an average of 1%, and the P-M model, which
overpredicted by an average of 3% (Table III). Predicted
average annual ET for all other models at the restoration
site differed from eddy ET by at least 35%.

DISCUSSION
Eddy covariance ET measurements
Our study assumes that stand-level ET measured with the
eddy covariance approach is an appropriate standard for
evaluation of the accuracy of ET estimates from meteoro-
logical models and remote-sensing-based approaches. Many
earlier investigations (e.g. Law et al., 2000; Fisher et al.,
2005; Morales et al., 2005; Mu et al., 2011; Domec et al.,
2012; Singh et al., 2014) make this assumption based on the
more direct measurement and lower uncertainty of stand-
scale water vapour ﬂux with the eddy covariance technique
compared with other approaches (Moncrieff et al., 2000;
Baldocchi and Ryu, 2011). Our results on energy balance
closure at the three study sites (Figure 1) indicate that the
accuracy of our eddy covariance measurements of ET is
typical for eddy covariance studies (Wilson et al., 2001;
Amiro, 2009; Barr et al., 2012). The poorer energy balance
closure at the restoration site (78%) than at the control and
ﬁre sites (>95%) suggests underestimation of ET measure-
ment at the restoration site perhaps because of heteroge-
neous land surface cover, non-stationary ﬂow, and/or
instrument and measurement errors (Twine et al., 2000;
Ruhoff et al., 2012). We note that site-speciﬁc environmen-
tal and meteorological data used as model inputs had
occasional gaps of 10 days or longer. Gap ﬁlling of these
missing data (Dore et al., 2010) provided continuous (i.e.
30-min interval) estimates of ET by eddy covariance and
input data for the meteorological models, but clearly, gap
ﬁlling is a source of error in estimates of ET from eddy
covariance and the meteorological models in our study.
Our estimates of annual ET with eddy covariance for
ponderosa pine forests of northern Arizona (510 mmyear1
control site, 464mm year1 restoration site) appear to be
reasonable when compared with other studies. Goulden
et al. (2012) reported annual ET of 429 mmyear1 for a

watershed that includes ponderosa pine forests in the Sierra
Nevada Mountains based on eddy covariance. Estimates of
700mm year1 for our control site and 400mm year1 for
our restoration site were produced using the Landsat-based
Simpliﬁed Surface Energy Balance model (Singh et al.,
2014). Finally, an extensive set of small (<730 ha)
catchments was instrumented at the Beaver Creek Exper-
imental Watershed that operated 80 km south of Flagstaff
from 1957 to 1981 (Baker, 1986). Fourteen of the
catchments were in ponderosa pine forest with vegetation,
climate, and soils similar to our study sites. For unmanaged
forests at the Beaver Creek Experimental Watershed, ET
calculated with the water balance approach (precipitation–
run-off) averaged 526 mmyear1.
Model validation environment
The forest disturbance gradient of our study sites, the long
study duration (4 years), and the climatic characteristics of
the sites present a formidable challenge to modelling stand-
level ET. First, the disturbance gradient of our study sites is
representative of the three most common stand conditions
of ponderosa-pine-dominated forests that result from a
century of lack of disturbance and forest management
(control site), intense burning of previous forest (ﬁre site),
and restoration thinning of previous forest to reduce fuels
and ﬁre intensity (restoration site). Previous studies based
on the eddy covariance data showed that these disturbances
changed ET at our study sites (Dore et al., 2012).
Speciﬁcally, conversion of dense forest to sparse grassland
by intense burning at the ﬁre site reduced annual ET by
about 20% (Dore et al., 2012). In contrast, impacts of
restoration thinning on annual ET were temporally
dynamic, with reductions of about 12% in the ﬁrst 2years
after thinning (2007 and 2008), followed by return to a
similar ET as the unthinned control site by the fourth post-
thinning year (Dore et al., 2012). Most past investigations

of model performance in predicting forest ET avoided
disturbed sites because of the challenges in accurate
modelling of disturbance effects. Second, many past
investigations of ET model performance in forests have
been conducted at the subannual scale, often only during
the summer when ET ﬂux is highest (e.g. Fisher et al.,
2005), rather than for every month over multiple years as
was performed in our study. Finally, the climate of our
study site region presents further challenges to modelling
forest ET because of a unique combination of inﬂuences
from winter cold, spring drought, and late-summer heavy
rains (Sheppard et al., 2002).
Performance of meteorological models
We used annual total ET (Table III) to discuss model
accuracy because the most accurate meteorological models
at the monthly scale (Table II) were generally most
accurate at the annual scale at all sites and because most
water managers and hydrologists are most interested in
annual ET. We found that three meteorological models
estimated annual ET similar to measurements with eddy
covariance at all sites. The S-W model had the most robust
performance over sites. Annual average ET predicted with
the S-W model was within 15% of eddy ET at both the
heavily forested control site and the grass-dominated and
shrub-dominated ﬁre site. The S-W model was less
accurate at the recently thinned restoration site but still
predicted annual ET within 35% of eddy ET. The
underlying structure of the S-W model, which is designed
for sparse crops and includes separate equations for soil
evaporation and canopy transpiration, is well suited for
ponderosa pine forests that often contain canopy openings
and are exposed to short-duration rain in late summer that
largely evaporates from surfaces. We suspect that ET
predictions by the S-W model could be improved at the

recently thinned restoration site by reﬁning parameter
values that strongly control model predictions and are
altered by thinning. For example, ET prediction by the S-W
model is highly sensitive to the stomatal resistance
parameter based on our sensitivity analysis (data not
shown), yet we used the same stomatal resistance value for
the control and restoration sites, which likely reduced
prediction accuracy by the S-W model. Prediction accuracy
of the S-W model in recently disturbed forests likely can be
improved by more investigation of disturbance impacts on
stomatal resistance. The P-M model also had good
performance, with average overestimation of annual eddy
ET by 3% at the restoration site and 11% at the ﬁre site and
underestimation of 37% at the control site. The third well-
performing model was M-B, which overestimated eddy ET
by an average of 1% at the restoration site and 24% at the
ﬁre site and underestimated by 38% at the control site. In
contrast, the P-M-d and P-T models performed well at
some sites but were not consistently accurate over all sites,
with differences from average annual eddy ET of greater
than 25% at two of three sites.
The three models that produced the most accurate ET
values (S-W, P-M, and M-B) use constant canopy
resistance rather than the dynamically regulated resistance
used by the P-M-d model (Stewart, 1988), which
consistently underpredicted eddy ET at all sites. The P-
M-d model predicted eddy ET more accurately at the
control and restoration sites than at the ﬁre site, as indicated
by higher R2 (Table I). This result may be because of
anisohydric stomatal behaviour and insensitivity of transpi-
ration to environmental conditions of the early successional
grasses and shrubs that dominate the ﬁre site (De Lillis and
Federici, 1993). The original dynamic stomatal resistance
model (Stewart, 1988) was developed for Scots pine (Pinus
sylvestris) at a more mesic site (Scotland) than our sites.
This model likely can be improved for semi-arid regions by
reﬁning the parameters that constrain stomatal resistance.
Similar to Fisher et al.’s (2005) study in a ponderosa
pine plantation in California, we found that the relatively
simple P-T model, which approximates aerodynamic
controls on ET with a simple empirical term rather than
with physically based functions, predicted ET well (within
18% of eddy-measured ET) at the densely forested control
site. However, the P-T model was not accurate at both
disturbed sites. Speciﬁcally, the P-T model underestimated
annual ET at the ﬁre site by an average of 26% and
overestimated at the restoration site by an average of 92%.
The regression equation relating the empirical term α to soil
moisture was determined by Fisher et al. (2005) for an
unmanaged ponderosa pine plantation. Our results suggest
that this equation is site speciﬁc and that new equations for
disturbance-affected and management-affected sites are needed.
Accuracy of MODIS ET product
The MODIS AET product underestimated annual eddy ET
by an average of 51% at the control site, 62% at the ﬁre
site, and 70% at the restoration site (Table III). The

underestimation of ET at the ﬁre site by the MODIS
product may be because of the post-burning shift in
dominant vegetation, which changes reﬂectance properties
and affects LAI estimation (Rogan and Franklin, 2001).
Vegetation clumping typical of broadleaf plants, such as
shrubs that occur at the ﬁre site, tends to saturate the optical
signal and reduce the accuracy of LAI measured with
remote sensing. The MODIS product underestimated
annual ET of our forested sites possibly because of an
underestimation of LAI by the MODIS LAI product.
Empirically measured LAI (based on projected area) at
these sites averaged 2.3 at the control site and 1.2 at the
restoration site as compared with MODIS LAI of 1.5 and
0.9, respectively (data not shown). At oak/pine and mixed
conifer forests in the Sierra Nevada where eddy ET was
higher (between 600 and 800mm year1) than in our study,
Goulden et al. (2012) found that the MODIS product
underestimated annual mean ET by more than 70%, which
was caused by inaccurate meteorological or biogeophysical
inputs to the MOD16 algorithm. Mu et al. (2007) reported
that inaccuracy in estimating ET by the MODIS product
may result from using different land cover datasets for
estimation of LAI and ET. Further, the 1-km2 square pixel
of the MODIS ET and LAI products does not exactly
match the oval footprint of the eddy covariance measure-
ments in our and most studies, which is an additional
source of uncertainty in comparisons of ET. Singh et al.
(2014) compared AET derived from both Land Remote
Sensing Satellite System (Landsat) and MODIS with eddy
ET data in the south-western USA and reported that
Landsat AET data were more strongly correlated with eddy
ET in part because of the ﬁner spatial resolution of Landsat
compared with MODIS. Given the large offset between the
MODIS ET product and the tower ET found in this and
other studies, future applications should run the MOD16
algorithm using site-speciﬁc model parameters.
Challenges in modelling ET in recently thinned forests
The restoration site, where tree LAI was reduced 40% by
thinning in 2006 in the year before the start of our
comparisons (Dore et al., 2010), posed special challenges
to model prediction of ET. We know from the eddy
covariance data that the thinning treatment reduced ET by
about 10% in the ﬁrst three post-thinning years
(2007–2009) compared with the control site (Dore et al.,
2012). Most meteorological models (P-M, P-T, M-B, and
S-W), however, predicted higher ET at the restoration site
than at the control site in those years (Table III), likely
because these models did not adequately represent the
structural and physiological changes caused by tree
thinning. Although the P-M model predicted eddy ET well
at the restoration site, predictions of the M-B model were
the most accurate at this site. The M-B model is based on
the P-M model but ignores the aerodynamic resistance
above the canopy, meaning that stomatal resistance is the
only surface resistance source in this model. Among the
meteorological models in this study, the M-B model is the
only one that does not require energy ﬂux data as input
parameters. We speculate that the M-B model performed
best at the disturbed restoration site for two reasons. First,
as discussed previously, the heterogeneous land surface
cover and non-stationary air ﬂow ﬁeld at the restoration site
could have caused energy ﬂux measurement errors;
therefore, using the M-B model eliminated this source of
error. Second, the M-B model does not formally consider
aerodynamic resistance, which likely was altered by the
thinning treatment.
The MODIS product faces challenges associated with
canopy openings in recently thinned forests. Bare ground
exposed in forest gaps created by forest thinning reﬂects
more short-wave radiation, and this reﬂectance depends on
moisture and organic and mineral contents in the soil
(Varjo, 1997; Heikkonen and Varjo, 2004). Inter-canopy
shadowed surfaces that absorb more radiation can decrease
reﬂectance (Gemmell and Varjo, 1999). Olsson (1995)
could not reliably assess forest condition using Landsat
imagery because a 25% canopy decrease caused by forest
thinning decreased NIR reﬂectance. For the same reasons,
Souza and Barreto (2000) could not reliably detect locations
of selective harvest sites in tropical forests with remote
sensing. As thinning created larger gaps and more ground
area with exposed soil at the restoration site, ground
reﬂectance of short-wave and NIR radiations may have
increased and decreased, respectively. Thus, average pixel
reﬂectance at the restoration site likely was inﬂuenced by
ground reﬂectance causing underprediction of LAI that then
resulted in underprediction of ET by the MODIS product.
CONCLUSIONS
Reliable estimates of ET are needed because ET is a major
component of the hydrologic cycle in upland forested
regions that provide water to downstream agriculture and
metropolitan areas. Increasingly, forests such as the
ponderosa pine forests that we studied in Arizona are
subjected to disturbance from wildﬁre and forest restoration
projects, yet the accuracy of ET estimations in disturbed
forests with currently available meteorological and remote-
sensing-based models is unknown. Based on average annual
ET measured by eddy covariance as a standard, we found
that the most accurate model for predicting ET was S-W at
the densely forested control site, P-M at the intensively
burned ﬁre site, and M-B at the recently thinned restoration
site. All these models (S-W, P-M, and M-B) produced
predictions of annual ET usually within 30% of measure-
ments with eddy covariance at all sites.

Our results show that the MODIS ET product currently
has a limited capability for estimating ET in both
undisturbed and disturbed ponderosa pine forests of the
south-western USA. Therefore, we recommend evaluation
of ﬁner spatial-resolution-based remote sensing models
than MODIS, such as the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal
Emission and Reﬂection Radiometer or Landsat, for
improving remote-sensing-based estimates of ET in
south-western ponderosa pine forests. Because measure-
ment of AET with eddy covariance requires considerable
resources, land and water resource managers would beneﬁt
from a simpler and more cost-effective remote-sensing-
based technique for estimating AET.
