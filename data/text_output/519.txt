FLAGSTAFF,ARIZONA—It’s hard to resist com-
paring forest ecologist Wally Covington to
the old-growth ponderosa pines that tower
above this bustling mountain town. Both are
tall and burly, with rugged skins molded by
age and experience. And like the pines, Cov-
ington is a lightning rod. But he doesn’t burn
easily. “I am incredibly confident in what I
do—and I have a very thick skin,” he says.
Over the last few years, the 55-year-old
academic has emerged as perhaps the nation’s
most visible—and controversial—forest sci-
entist. The folksy, 2-meter-tall woodlands ex-
pert has become a scientific Paul Bunyan on
the subject of how to pre-
vent forest fires. He is con-
sulted by presidents and
lawmakers, courted by the
media, and hailed and as-
sailed by environmental-
ists, loggers, and scientists
alike. His research under-
pins parts of the White
House’s controversial new
“healthy forests” initiative,
and President George W.
Bush himself might make
a pilgrimage to the re-
searcher’s plots this week
—all this because Coving-
ton believes in cutting
down some trees in the
name of saving forests.
This year’s conflagra-
tion in the western United
States—which scorched
2.5 million hectares of
forest—has only height-
ened interest in Coving-
ton’s work. He and his colleagues at Northern
Arizona University (NAU) here have spent 
3 decades studying southwestern ponderosa
pine ecosystems. For years, they’ve warned
that vast swaths of woodland have become
dangerous tinderboxes: A century of overgraz-
ing, logging, and misguided fire-suppression
policies has left many stands unnaturally
choked with thickets of young trees and dead-
wood. To prevent catastrophic fires, Coving-
ton argues that massive cutting is needed to
restore these forests to their less dense, park-
like pasts. The idea is being promoted by the
president in his plan, now before Congress.
Some researchers and environmentalists,
however, are uncomfortable with Coving-
ton’s approach to forest restoration. They
complain that he has used his political
prowess to monopolize resources and worry
that government officials might misapply
his ponderosa-based ideas to dramatically
different types of woodlands. And they
charge that loggers have cynically embraced
his work to justify a return to damaging
practices. “Unfortunately, his science gives
political cover to forces that want to increase
logging,” says Todd Schulke of the Center
for Biological Diversity, an environmental
advocacy group in Tucson, Arizona.
Still, even critics applaud Covington for
bringing the plight of the southwestern
forests to national attention. They also con-
fess to liking him. “We disagree, but I really
enjoy his company,” says Schulke.
“Wally’s got strong ideas, and they are
not entirely congenial to the timber industry,
environmentalists, or policy-makers,” says
Bruce Babbitt, longtime friend, former Ari-
zona governor, and head of the Department
of the Interior under President Bill Clinton.
“But people listen because he’s passionate,
articulate, and credible.”
In Leopold’s footsteps
Covington was clearly in his element recent-
ly as he loped over downed trees and sized
up standing timber. But it was the trees’ eco-
logical—not commercial—potential that he
was eyeing. Covington has spent his career
trying to figure out how to reclaim the glory
of declining ponderosa forests. His goal is
radical: “I want to see half of all public forests
in the Southwest restored to presettlement
conditions,” he says. Turning the clock back,
he argues, is the best way
to combat fires—and do
everything from protect
endangered species to en-
able the forests to ride out
climate change.
His quest for ecologi-
cal healing goes back to
his youth in Oklahoma and
west Texas. Covington’s
dad—a jack-of-all-trades
who once worked as a
barnstorming pilot—was a
devotee of Aldo Leopold, a
restoration pioneer who
died in 1948. When Cov-
ington was 7 his father
died, but not before
drilling home Leopold’s
lessons during weekends
spent living off the land.
“We’d alternate [spending]
Sundays in church and
outside,” he recalls.
Under the guidance of
his mother, a schoolteacher, Covington ex-
celled in the classroom and headed off to col-
lege to pursue a career in medicine. But a
postgraduation summer working among chil-
dren with cancer exhausted him emotionally,
and in 1970 he found himself teaching school
in Gallup, New Mexico—and organizing an
Earth Day celebration that ultimately got him
fired. “Basically, I was a hippie,” he says.
A few years later, inspired by undergradu-
ate ecology courses and graduate work with
Jim Gosz at the University of New Mexico in
Albuquerque, Covington won a spot in the
Wally Covington burns with an intensity that matches the debate over President Bush’s forest 
initiative, which draws on 30 years’ work by the forest ecologist

graduate forestry program at Yale University,
where Leopold had also studied. Working un-
der F. Herbert Borman and Daniel Botkin,
Covington completed “one of the most influ-
ential studies in the recent history of forest
ecology,” says Ruth Yanai, an ecologist at the
State University of New York College of Envi-
ronmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse.
Using plots in the Hubbard Brook Exper-
imental Forest in New Hampshire, Coving-
ton measured how organic matter in forest
soils changed after logging. The result—
known as Covington’s curve—suggested that
logged soils lost 50% of their organic matter,
and hence their ecologically important loads
of carbon, within 20 years. Even before it
was published, the curve was being used by
scientists trying to estimate how much car-
bon logged soils contributed to global atmo-
spheric loads. And although subsequent
studies have raised major doubts about the
curve’s applicability, “it continues to have in-
fluence,” says Yanai, who is about to publish
a paper on the topic.
In 1975, Covington joined NAU and be-
gan to examine the nearby Ponderosa
forests. The U.S. Forest Service was begin-
ning to experiment with controlled burns to
reduce wildfire dangers, and Covington saw
a chance to test some of his own ideas. But
first—following Leopold’s example—he
had to set a restoration goal, and that “meant
figuring out what the forests looked like be-
fore European settlers arrived,” he says.
Ever since, he and an array of col-
leagues—including his wife, NAU forest
ecologist Margaret Moore—have pored over
historical photographs and records and have
mapped old stumps, downed logs, and fire
scars on study plots. In a series of 1994 pa-
pers, they made the case that many pre-
settlement ponderosa stands were swept regu-
larly by “cool” fires, making them far less
dense than today’s forests. “There were often
several dozen relatively large trees [per
hectare],” says Covington, compared with the
hundreds of stunted stems often found today.
The data convinced Covington and other
scientists that a conflagration was imminent
and that immediate thinning was the only way
to save the forests. But controlled burns alone
wouldn’t do the trick, he warned: Early exper-
iments near Flagstaff showed that debris-
clogged forests often burned so hot that they
scorched the soil and eventually killed the
older, larger trees that ecologists wanted to
save. Covington’s team argued that loggers
first needed to thin the forests and rake accu-
mulated needles away from old-growth trees. 
At the same time, the team was fine-
tuning its “presettlement model” of
restoration (Science, 28 January 2000, p.
573). The approach begins with mapping
the locations of presettlement trees on a
target site. Then, loggers clear away
younger trees—at times 80% or more—in
a bid to recreate the lost landscape.
Into the limelight
Such ideas, however, were little known out-
side the West until several lethal fires struck
in 1994. The resulting outcry prompted
Babbitt to seek Covington’s help. Soon,
Babbitt was touting Covington’s work,
which he dubbed the Flagstaff plan, as one
solution. “I called up Wally and said: ‘Ever
hear of the Flagstaff plan? Well, now you
have and you’d better get ready to answer
questions about it.’”
The state’s lawmakers, especially Senator
Jon Kyl (R–AZ), then went to work in Wash-
ington, D.C., earmarking funds to help Cov-
ington and working with Babbitt to line up
study sites. Soon, Covington had access to a
swath of isolated federal land on the slopes of
Mount Trumbull in northern Arizona, where
he could scale up experiments that involved
removing different proportions of trees and
implementing various burning timetables.
Preliminary tests had suggested that such ap-
proaches could lead to less damaging fires
and improved biodiversity. And although the
outcome of the bigger experiments won’t be
known for years, the uncertainty hasn’t kept
Covington’s support from growing.
Several years of devastating fires in the
West have increased pressure on legislators
to act (Science, 1 September 2000, p.
1448). In response, Kyl—who serves on the
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Com-
mittee—has helped funnel more than $10
million to Covington’s Ecological Restora-
tion Institute, which promotes science-based
forest restoration. Now, a group of Western
lawmakers wants to establish duplicate cen-
ters in other states.
Covington isn’t embarrassed by the ear-
marked cash. He says that he’s won plenty of
peer-reviewed grants, too, but that “unconven-
tional research requires unconventional
sources of funding.” Although some re-
searchers in the region grumble privately that
Covington hasn’t shared the wealth, others dis-
miss that argument as sour grapes. “He’s had a
tremendous catalyzing effect and brought in
new resources,” says Melissa Savage, a retired
forestry professor who now runs the Four Cor-
ners Institute in Santa Fe, New Mexico. 
Covington’s windfall was the product of
decades of outreach. Even as a young faculty
member, he would regularly invite lawmakers
and their local staffers for field trips. “I’d call
in the summer, when it was really hot in
Phoenix, and invite them up to nice, cool
Flagstaff for a
tour,” he says.
“Then I’d campaign
the research.” He
soon was advising
governors, then
testifying before
Congress. This year,
the Bush Adminis-
tration tapped him
for advice, and Inte-
rior Secretary Gale
Norton visited.
But Covington’s
growing reputation
also brought in-
creased scrutiny.
Several environ-
mental groups that
were initially sup-
portive of his presettlement model, for in-
stance, grew restive after they saw some
heavily logged and rutted sites on Mount
Trumbull. “It was horrid; there was a real gap
between theory and practice,” says Sharon
Galbreath of the Southwest Forest Alliance in
Flagstaff, which subsequently challenged and
negotiated alterations to other thinning pro-
jects based on Covington’s concepts.
Environmentalists worry that Covington’s
projects are “too aggressive,” says Galbreath:
“He’s trying to restore presettlement forests
in one fell swoop.” Some environmentalists
now derisively refer to extensive thinning
projects as “Covington cuts.” In their quest
to promote what they see as more incremen-
tal approaches, they have developed a multi-
pronged critique that challenges nearly ev-
erything Covington’s team does.
For example, they argue that Coving-
ton’s method undercounts the number of
small presettlement trees on site. And they
criticize Covington’s zeal for restoration of
distant wilderness areas, which they say is
expensive and does little to reduce fire
threats near human population centers.
They are particularly troubled by his un-
willingness to preserve all larger trees by
prohibiting thinning above a certain size—
say, a half-meter in diameter.
The release of the Bush plan has only in-

creased their fears that Covington’s ideas will
be misapplied. The fire-related portion of the
plan calls for increasing thinning in all threat-
ened forests—including stands far from in-
habited areas—and paying for it by allowing
loggers to cut bigger, more valuable trees. It
would also ease environmental regulations to
avoid legal delays. Critics say that would pro-
mote too much cutting in the wrong places,
and they argue that Covington hasn’t done
enough to challenge the plan. “He hasn’t
made it clear that his approach is experimen-
tal and focused on ponderosa forests; we’re
not ready to run with it across the Southwest,”
says Bryan Bird of the Forest Conservation
Council in Santa Fe.
Such criticism, Covington says, is the in-
evitable consequence of trying to spur action
and running the largest ponderosa restora-
tion experiments in the nation. It’s true, he
says, that he declined to sign a recent letter
from dozens of prominent academics oppos-
ing the plan, because he disagreed with parts
of their argument. But he bridles at sugges-
tions that he’s bitten his tongue in order to
promote a “one size fits all” approach. In
testimony and interviews, for instance, he’s
criticized the plan for failing to differentiate
between forest types that withstand cool
fires and those that need to burn fiercely to
reproduce. His own experiments, he notes,
test more than two dozen tailored restoration
recipes. And he argues that the plan gives too
much attention to “salvage logging”—
cutting already burned trees—which has
questionable value for restoration.
Overall, the plan’s sometimes vague and
confusing language “is pretty much what
you’d expect from people who aren’t well
trained in logic,” he says. He also notes that
the White House ignored chunks of his ad-
vice, including having the National Acade-
my of Sciences develop guidelines on thin-
ning and restoration. (He now hopes to have
his institute assemble such a study.)
But like many other forestry scientists, he
is weary of the debate over tree-size caps, say-
ing the science doesn’t support any particular
size limit. Similarly, he says that although it
makes economic sense to start thinning near
inhabited areas, many of the natural resources
most at risk—from endangered species to wa-
ter supplies—often lie deep within a forest.
And he expresses some sympathy for the Ad-
ministration’s controversial proposal to stream-
line environmental regulations. Some of his
own experiments have been held hostage by
“environmental obstructionists,” he says. In
testimony earlier this month, he encouraged
Congress to consider rules that would allow
the public to help craft multistage experiments
but then leave land managers free to practice
“adaptive management”—feeding lessons
learned into the next stage of the process. “We
shouldn’t have to revisit every detail,” he says.
At the same time, Covington joins forces
with some of his environmental foes in ques-
tioning the government’s commitment to
restoration. He rejects the notion that the
agencies are still dominated by “timber
beasts” dedicated to logging: “These are
post–Earth Day foresters,” he says. But he
concedes that they “still aren’t very good at
learning from the past.” One solution, he
suggests, is to earmark 5% of the potential
$1 billion or so that might be spent on thin-
ning over the next few years for studies de-
signed to test—and then replicate—a wider
range of approaches.
Before designing those studies, Coving-
ton suggests that researchers think about
how Aldo Leopold would tackle the chal-
lenge. “If you were a time traveler from the
future, what would you ask us to do right
now so that future forests would be
healthy?” he asks. Immediate action is es-
sential, he emphasizes. Otherwise, scientists
might find themselves fiddling around for
answers while Rome burns.

Out of the Vault, Into the Forest
FLAGSTAFF,ARIZONA—Seven years ago, a local historian tipped off forest
ecologist Margaret Moore of Northern Arizona University to a cache of
dusty maps.They rested in a neglected vault here at the U.S. Forest Ser-
vice’s Fort Valley Experimental Station, set up in 1909 as the govern-
ment’s first research forest. Moore took a peek and marveled at the eco-
logical time capsule that lay before her. In spare black-and-white were
drawn the locations of hundreds of saplings, trees, and downed logs in a
160-square-meter patch of forest almost a century ago. The vault con-
tained dozens of such labor-intensive portraits,from 1- to 7-hectare plots
spread across the southwestern United States.
The maps were a potential cornucopia of data for Moore and her
husband, Wally Covington, who have spent much of the last decade
trying to understand the recent evolution of the southwestern pon-
derosa pine forests (see main text).“That kind of detailed information
is incredibly rare,” she says. The drawings cried out for a follow-up
study to see how the plots had changed.
The collection wasn’t perfect, to be sure. Data ledgers were
missing, and the cross-hatched rectangles that appeared randomly
on some maps were a mystery. Moore didn’t even know if the plots,
some staked out as long as 94 years ago, could still be found.
Undaunted, Moore and the historian—Susan Olberding—searched
for one plot that appeared to be just steps from the vault. “I bet it
didn’t take us 10 minutes to locate it,” recalls Moore.The treasure trove
grew as Moore and her colleagues hunted down original corner stakes
and even metal tree-marking tags, rusted but still readable. Then the
ledgers turned up, providing meaning to the mysterious rectangles.
They were 4.5-square-meter microplots that had also been
carefully surveyed—down to grass stem and twig locations.
Beginning in 1909, Forest Service scientists G.A. Pearson and
T. S. Woolsey had established the more than 100 plots of
various sizes as part of long-term monitoring studies. Some
had been revisited periodically up to the 1950s.
Discovering the microplots was enough for Moore to get
started. She and her colleagues have already looked at
eight of the microplots near Flagstaff, and they have found
that the thickening ponderosa forests appear to have re-
duced the number and kinds of plants on the forest floor.A
$310,000, 4-year grant from the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture will now allow them to remap about 40 of the big-
ger plots in New Mexico and Arizona. Moore expects to
document measurable changes and build computer simu-
lations to depict the past, present, and future of the
forests. “It would be great,” she says, “if researchers 100
years from now could revisit these plots, too.”
