ABSTRACT Across ponderosa pine—(Pinus ponderosa) dominated forests of northern Arizona, USA, large-
scale restoration and fuels treatments are being implemented or planned to reduce wildﬁre threat and severity
and improve ecosystem health. It is important to understand how these activities will affect animal
populations, including species of economic and social importance, such as mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus).
Forest treatments may improve foraging habitat for mule deer by opening forest canopy and stimulating
shrub and herbaceous production, but also may reduce availability of day-bed sites. In this context, we used a
generalized linear mixed-model approach and utilization distributions to estimate post-treatment relative
intensity of summer (Apr–Sep) use of multiple habitat attributes by adult female mule deer on the Grand
Canyon-Parashant National Monument in northern Arizona between 2003 and 2005. Based on 5,776
Global Positioning System collar locations from 10 individuals (x ¼ 580 locations/individual), we identiﬁed
intensive use of areas that received a thin-and-burn treatment in the previous season, were located on gentle
slopes, and were proximate to reliable water sources. Female mule deer likely selected thin-and-burn
treatment areas to take advantage of increased forage abundance. Because thin-and-burn treatments did not
remove Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) or Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii), substantial shrub and mid-
story vegetation cover remained post-treatment. Our results indicated the potential value of a mosaic
approach to ponderosa pine forest restoration, where untreated areas, as well as treated areas that retain
Gambel oak and juniper, are heterogeneously distributed across the landscape. This approach also would
provide important concealment cover and forage after thin-and-burn and thin-only treatments.  2013 The

KEY WORDS Arizona, forest restoration, mule deer, Odocoileus hemionus, Pinus ponderosa, ponderosa pine.
Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of the American
Southwest (AZ, NM, and adjoining portions of UT and
CO) have experienced major changes in structure, composi-
tion, and function because of recent human activities (Allen
et al. 2002). More than a century of livestock grazing, ﬁre
suppression, logging, road construction, and exotic-species
introductions have altered most of these forests from
conditions that had prevailed for thousands of years
(Covington and Moore 1994, Swetnam et al. 1999).
Contemporary ponderosa pine forests tend to be dominated
by relatively homogeneous, dense stands of younger trees
with a depauperate herbaceous and shrub understory,
and increased vulnerability to high-intensity crown ﬁre
(Covington and Moore 1994).
In the Southwest, forest restoration prescriptions in
ponderosa pine-dominated ecosystems typically seek to
recreate conditions characteristic of those present prior to
Euro-American
settlement
(pre-1870),
including
tree-
species composition and spatial arrangement (Covington
et al. 1997, Fule´ et al. 1997). These restoration treatments are
designed to reduce tree density and overstory canopy, while
increasing productivity and diversity of understory vegetation
(Fule´ 2003). Animal species will respond differently to these
changes based on their home-range requirements, mobility,
and degree of habitat speciﬁcity (Chambers and Germaine
2003).
Mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) populations in the
Southwest have experienced declines in the past 50 years
(Clements and Young 1997) due to habitat degradation from
ﬁre suppression, exotic species invasion, and increased
livestock grazing (Gill 1999). Habitat requirements of
mule deer include an abundance of high-quality herbaceous
forage (Dietz and Nagy 1976), vegetation cover that provides
protection
from
predators
and
weather
(Parker
and
Gillingham 1990), and access to reliable water sources.

Summer forage availability and quality determines body
condition of deer prior to a resource-limited winter (Snider
and Asplund 1974, Mule Deer Working Group 2003),
affects doe productivity and lactation, and fawn survival and
growth; therefore, high-quality summer habitat is essential
for maintaining healthy populations (Zwank 1976, Pederson
and Harper 1978).
In northern Arizona, mule deer summer home ranges
commonly include ponderosa pine-dominated vegetation
types (Urness et al. 1975, Pederson and Harper 1978),
including extensive areas where large-scale restoration
treatments have been implemented or are currently being
planned. Restoration treatments and timber harvest activities
that open tree canopies in ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer
forests often increase forage abundance and diversity and
subsequent use by wildlife (Clary and Ffolliot 1966;
Patton 1974, 1976; Masters et al. 1993). Although mule
deer can respond favorably to restoration treatments due to
increased forage production, these treatments may also
reduce hiding cover and alter the microclimate and physical
characteristics of day-bed sites (Germaine et al. 2004).
For a managed herd of mule deer occupying ponderosa
pine-dominated and recently treated areas in the Grand
Canyon-Parashant National Monument in northern Ari-
zona, we sought to examine the effects of forest restoration
on the relative intensity of summer habitat-use patterns.
Within a rigorous statistical modeling framework, we
leveraged high temporal and spatial resolution Global
Positioning System (GPS) collar data. Speciﬁcally, our
objectives were to 1) spatially deﬁne individual home range
and core areas, 2) develop a spatially explicit statistical model
of intensity of habitat use, and 3) make recommendations
that will help land managers provide essential forage and
cover attributes for mule deer while restoring forest structure
and reducing the risk of uncharacteristic, high-intensity
wildﬁre. Furthermore, and in the statistical context of
multiple habitat variables, we hypothesized that adult female
mule deer would use treated areas, irrespective of treatment
type, more intensely than untreated areas.
STUDY AREA
We conducted our study within the Mt. Trumbull Resource
Conservation Area of the Grand Canyon-Parashant Na-
tional Monument in northwestern Arizona (Fig. 1). The
1,200-ha study area was managed by the U.S. Department of
the Interior Bureau of Land Management. Elevations ranged
from 1,675 m to 2,620 m and major vegetation communities
included pure ponderosa pine forest and ponderosa pine-
deciduous forests containing Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii),
New Mexican locust (Robinia neomexicana), and quaking
aspen (Populus tremuloides). Pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) and
Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) were less common in the
study area. Logging and cattle grazing were introduced to the
region during Euro-American settlement circa 1870 and the
Mt. Trumbull Resource Conservation Area has been ﬁre-
suppressed for much of the past century (Covington and
Moore 1994).
Throughout the study area, forest restoration treatments
were initiated in 1996. The restoration prescription followed
pre-1870 reference conditions for tree-species composition
and spatial arrangement (Covington et al. 1997). Treatments
were designed to include thinning, burning, and reseeding
with a native herb mix dominated by grasses (see Covington
et al. 1997, Waltz et al. 2003). All old-growth ponderosa
pine trees (>120 yr old) and all Gambel oak, Utah juniper,
and New Mexican locust were retained during thinning
treatments. By 2003, >450 ha of ponderosa pine forest had
received thin-and-burn treatment and an additional 320 ha
were thinned-only. An untreated control area of approxi-
mately 500 ha was present in the southeastern portion of the
study area, along with 5 10–30-ha controls embedded among
treated areas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Deer Capture and Location Data
We captured 15 adult (>2 yr) female mule deer using drop-
nets or chemical immobilization between 12 June 2003 and
31 July 2003. We ﬁtted deer with store-on-board GPS
collars (Model no. TWG 3500 with CR2A collar release;
Telonics, Inc., Mesa, AZ). Collars were programmed to
record 1 location every 5 hours from 1 May to 30 September.
Collars were programmed to release after 3 years of
operation. Global Positioning System locations had a
locational accuracy of 15 m according to manufacturer
speciﬁcations. Locations with dilution of precision values >8
and 2-dimensional ﬁxes were considered insufﬁciently
accurate and removed prior to analysis (Lewis et al. 2007).
Habitat Variable Development
We selected a set of 7 habitat predictor variables inﬂuenced
by restoration treatments and identiﬁed in previous studies of
mule deer ecology and habitat use (King and Smith 1980,
Kuﬁeld
et
al.
1988,
Carpenter
1998,
Cunningham
et al. 2005, Heffelﬁnger 2006). We used data from the
2006 National Land Cover Data (30-m-pixel resolution; Fry
et al. 2011) and a geographic information system (GIS;
ArcGIS v10.0) to derive a layer of dominant land-cover types
across the study area. We further consolidated these data into
3 dominant land-cover types: ponderosa pine forest, pinyon–
juniper forest, or “other,” which included aspen stands,
meadows, or lava ﬁelds. Within the GIS, terrain variables
characterizing elevation, slope, ruggedness, and “northness”
were derived at a 30-m resolution using topographic data
obtained from the LANDFIRE Project website (www.
landﬁre.gov). Ruggedness was derived using the standard
deviation of all slope values in a 3  3-pixel neighborhood.
Northness (i.e., the tendency of a pixel to be facing toward
true north, scaled between 0 and 1) was derived using a cosine
transformation of aspect (Roberts 1986).
We also used the GIS to estimate the Euclidean distance of
all known reliable water sources (i.e., ephemeral or typically
available in the summer of most years on the study area).
Water source locations originated from Bureau of Land
Management and Arizona Game and Fish Department
records and were veriﬁed in the ﬁeld.

Wildlife Society Bulletin  37(4)

We obtained a spatial database containing perimeters of
forest treatments applied on the study area between 1996 and
2005 from the Ecological Restoration Institute at Northern
Arizona University. Although prescriptions were intended to
include thinning followed by burning, treatments occurred in
stages; in many cases, several years passed between the thin-
and-burn stages. Over the course of our study, several areas
were not burned and considered thin-only treatments. We
considered thin-only and thin-and-burn treatments as binary
predictor variables in our models. Areas were considered
treated and available to mule deer one season after treatments
were completed (i.e., spring treatments available in summer).
Within the GIS, we derived all predictor variables as a 30-
m pixel-resolution grid. To accommodate uncertainty in
GPS locations and the precise value of a predictor variable
assigned to a given pixel, we smoothed all continuous
variable grids using a 3  3 focal mean or majority ﬁlter
operation prior to modeling.
Home-Range and Core-Area Estimation
For the summer period 1 May–30 September, 2003–2005,
we analyzed GPS location data for individual mule deer to
spatially
deﬁne
individual
home-range
and
core-area
perimeters. For each individual, we used a kernel-based
approach to estimate a probabilistic utilization distribution
and 95% and 50% ﬁxed-kernel (FK) isopleths, deﬁning the
perimeter of the home range and core areas, respectively, and
when 30 locations were obtained in a given period (Seaman
et al. 1999). We derived these estimates using a likelihood-
based smoothing parameter (CVh; Horne and Garton 2006)
and a kernel estimation extension to ArcGIS (30-m grid-cell
size; Beyer 2012). The continuous values of the utilization
distribution were used as a proxy for determining the relative
intensity of habitat use in the models described below. We
used a 1-way analysis of variance (test statistic ¼ F,
a ¼ 0.05) to test for among-year differences in home-range
and core-area size.

Models of Habitat Use
We used a generalized linear mixed-model framework and
hierarchical approach to quantify patterns of individual habitat
use as a function of the habitat predictor variables described
above. We were interested in estimating the relative intensity of
habitat use (sensu Jennrich and Turner 1969); therefore, we
related individual mule deer GPS locations to the height of the
utilization distribution by intersecting each utilization distri-
bution with all of the locations used to derive it (Dickson et al.
2013). We treated the continuous value of this utilization–
distribution height as the dependent variable in our models of
habitat use. We accounted for spatial and temporal structuring
(e.g., positive spatial and serial autocorrelation, respectively)
in the location data by treating individual animals within
years as a subject-level random effect and using a ﬁrst-order
autoregressive
covariance
structure
(Little
et
al.
2006,
Gutzwiller and Riffell 2007). In addition, we computed the
variance–covariance matrix of our habitat parameters using the
empirical Huber–White “sandwich” estimator, which allowed
us to relax the assumption of independence between locations
within subjects and account for unknown covariance structure
(Huber 1967, Williams 2000, Wooldridge 2009).
Within this generalized linear mixed-model framework,
we used an information-theoretic approach and multi-
model inference to estimate and contrast the importance of
individual habitat variables (i.e., ﬁxed effects; Burnham and
Anderson 2002). Because we were interested in quantifying
the relative importance of these variables, rather than
evaluate the performance of a candidate set of competing
models, we considered only a single “global” model that
included all of our habitat variables and used all subsets
modeling to estimate model-averaged regression coefﬁcients
(~b) and unconditional standard errors for each variable
(Burnham and Anderson 2002). We used these values to
estimate the effect size (based on a Z-statistic, or ~b/SE) and
rank the relative importance of each habitat variable. We
considered |Z| values 2.0 for a given variable to be
indicative of a strong response by mule deer to that variable.
We used an information-theoretic approach to model
selection and inference, so we did not compute P-values.
We used an intercept-only model (including random effect
and covariance structure) and the difference in Akaike’s
Information Criterion (DAIC) values to help evaluate how
well our global model approximated (and ﬁt) the data
(Anderson 2008).
Prior to statistical analysis, we standardized values for all
continuous habitat variables to a mean of zero and unit
variance. Because no univariate comparisons of these
variables had a Pearson correlation coefﬁcient >0.60, none
were excluded from our analysis. We implemented all
analyses and models in SAS PROC MIXED (v9.2; SAS
Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Location Data
Over the period of study, we successfully retrieved 13 collars,
which included 10 adult female deer whose home ranges
were wholly or largely contained within the study area. Our
ﬁnal spatial database included 5,776 locations from these 10
individuals. We obtained 95–250 (x ¼ 199, SD ¼ 50)
locations
for
10
individual
deer
in
2003,
178–329
(x ¼ 281, SD ¼ 50) locations for 8 deer in 2004, and
214–320 (x ¼ 257, SD ¼ 41) locations for 6 deer in 2005,
representing 24 unique subject levels in our statistical models
of habitat use.
Home-Range Estimation
We derived 24 estimates of home range and core areas for 10
deer (Table 1). The 95% FK estimates of individual home-
range area ranged from 96 ha to 1,090 ha and averaged
368 ha (SD ¼ 282). Individual core areas (50% FK) ranged
from 13 ha to 209 ha and averaged 66 ha (SD ¼ 49). Deer
were observed in all treatments across the study area. Home-
range estimates and core areas differed among 3 years of this
study, but none were statistically signiﬁcant. The average
95% FK estimate was 343 ha (SD ¼ 301) in 2003, 308
(SD ¼ 205) in 2004, and 489 (SD ¼ 345) in 2005. The
average core-area estimate was 64 (SD ¼ 58) in 2003, 55
(SD ¼ 33) in 2004, and 84 (SD ¼ 55) in 2005. On average,
deer core areas overlapped 56%, 37%, and 7% with control
areas, thin-and-burn treatments, and thin-only treatments,
respectively.
Models of Habitat Use
Our global model of habitat use was considerably better (i.e.,
lower; DAIC > 472) than the intercept-only model. Slope,

thin-and-burn treatment areas, and ponderosa pine-domi-
nated land cover were the strongest (|Z|  2.0) predictors of
relative intensity of mule deer summer habitat use on our
study area (Table 2). Distance to reliable water, pinyon–
juniper land cover, and rugged areas were moderate
predictors. Elevation, northness, and thin-only areas were
all less important predictors when compared with other
variables.
DISCUSSION
As hypothesized, our results indicated that deer used thin-
and-burn treatment areas more intensely within their home
range. Greater use within thinned and burned stands may
have been due to the greater variability of forest structure in
those areas due to the timing and size of treatments. In
general, individual treatments were small (10–150 ha) and
interspersed with untreated control areas, creating a mosaic
of dense tree patches adjacent to more open areas.
Treatments spanned >10 years, creating additional variabil-
ity in forest and shrub structure, because some treated areas
were completed 8–10 years prior to the start of other
treatments. Roccaforte et al. (2010) found that post-
treatment forest structure within stands in the Mt. Trumbull
Resource Conservation Area ranged from extremely open
patches with a minimum of 10 trees/ha to dense patches with
a maximum of 1,581 trees/ha.
Treatment prescriptions that decrease canopy cover usually
create an increase in forage abundance and diversity, thereby
making treated areas more preferred by mule deer than
untreated areas (Kuﬁeld et al. 1988, Masters et al. 1993).
Treated areas experienced an increase in Gambel oak and
other shrub and forb species, resulting in increased forage
availability (Roccaforte et al. 2010). In 2003, Gambel oak
made up 56% of the total trees/ha in treated areas, while
control areas were dominated by ponderosa pine (73% of the
total trees; Roccaforte et al. 2010). The post-treatment
increase in small understory trees, including Gambel oak,
New Mexican locust, and juniper, also provided deer with
adequate forage and concealment cover. These woody species
were not removed during thinning and exhibited vigorous
growth thereafter. Similarly, Germaine et al. (2004) found
that the majority of bedded mule deer observed in treated
areas were in patches of Gambel oak or New Mexican locust.
Other studies have found similar results, indicating that
stand diversity and dense pockets of trees are important
factors in providing concealment cover for day-bed sites and
protection from predators (King and Smith 1980, Gerlach
and Vaughan 1991).
Mule deer have previously been observed to select for gentle
slopes (Lendrum et al. 2012). The use of more gentle slopes
during the summer season may have been related to the
absence of dense vegetation more typical on steeper slopes.
Steep slopes in the study area were not thinned and tended to
consist of dense New Mexican locust and few forage species.
Other studies also have found that dense vegetation can
restrict
deer
movement
and
limit
forage
production
(Watkins et al. 2007).
We found that mule deer intensively used areas closer to
reliable water sources. Boroski and Mossman (1996) also
reported that deer tended to be distributed close to water
sources. Reliable water sources on our study area were not
abundant; therefore, relatively intense use of these features,
especially during the summer season, was not surprising.
Indeed, lactating females have an increased need for water
during this time of year (Hervert and Krausman 1986,
Boroski and Mossman 1996).
Although differences were not statistically signiﬁcant, we
observed variation in mule deer home-range and core-area
sizes among years. Home-range size of ungulates, including
mule deer, can be inﬂuenced by multiple factors, such as
age (Relyea et al. 2000), reproductive status (Long et al.
2009, van Beest et al. 2011), availability of forage (Dussault
et al. 2005), availability of water (Heffelﬁnger 2006, Marshal
et al. 2006), and intraspeciﬁc competition (Rosenzweig
1991). We found that average home-range and core-area size
for deer was similar during 2003 and 2004, but greater during
2005. The larger average home-range and core-area sizes we
estimated in 2005 likely resulted from a decrease in forest
cover availability due to restoration treatments conducted
during our period of study. More area was treated in 2005
(286 ha) than in previous years (89 and 106 ha in 2003 and
2004, respectively), so individual deer may have expanded
their home ranges and core areas in order to ﬁnd adequate
cover and avoid thinning activities (Nicholson et al. 1997,
Bender et al. 2007). Because the majority of core areas
overlapped control areas, an increase in the percentage of the
landscape treated likely contributed to an increase in home-
range size to include more control areas or areas with greater
cover.
Overall, our results for habitat use were similar to those
indicated
by other studies in the
region
(Germaine
et al. 2004, Cunningham et al. 2005). However, one result
from our study that differs from previous research was that
thin-only areas were not as intensively used as thin-and-burn
areas. This may have been due to a reduction in cover and
forage production in these areas immediately following
thinning. In the Southwest, vegetation growth can be slow
(Fule´ et al. 2005) and a substantial increase in forage may not
have occurred until after the prescribed burn. If a regular
ﬁre interval (e.g., 5–9 yr; Covington et al. 1999) is not

maintained, the use of these areas may decrease due to the
lack of new forage. Without subsequent burns, the increased
regeneration of locust and oak could lead to a deciduous-
dominant landscape (Barton 2002, Roccaforte et al. 2010).
Our models used higher spatial and temporal resolution GPS
data compared with previous studies in the area using Very
High Frequency transmitters, so our results likely revealed
habitat relationships that might have otherwise been masked
by lower resolution data and less sophisticated statistical
methods.
MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS
Our results suggest the importance of a mosaic approach to
forest restoration for mule deer management; therefore,
managers should consider treatments that provide adequate
concealment cover and day-bed sites. This could be
accomplished by staggering the time of treatments, main-
taining a diversity of trees, and keeping small pockets of
dense trees and untreated patches. We also recommend
maintaining the surface ﬁre regime to stimulate herbaceous
understory vegetation, which is an important dietary
component for mule deer in the summer months. These
areas would be further enhanced by retention of oak stands
within treated areas. Oak stands can be the primary midstory
canopy component in a treated ponderosa pine forest
(Germaine et al. 2004); therefore, managers should develop
treatment prescriptions that promote the retention of this
species (Roccaforte et al. 2010).
