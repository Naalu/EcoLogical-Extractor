Depauperate understory plant communities resulting from intensive livestock grazing in pinyon-juniper wood-
lands of the western United States may represent degraded stable states, resistant to ecological restoration treat-
ments. In this study, we analyzed 10-yr understory plant community responses to restoration treatments that
included tree thinning to approximate historical densities of pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) and juniper (Juniperus
osteosperma), scattering of thinning slash to improve soil conditions, and seeding at two woodland sites (Craig
Ranch and Goose Pond) in northwestern Arizona. Results showed that thinning resulted in signiﬁcant reductions
in tree density at both sites, as well as reductions in tree basal area at the Goose Pond site. Boles, branches, and
tops of the thinned trees scattered across the study sites resulted in few changes to woody surface fuel loading.
Thinning and addition of woody material, along with seeding, resulted in only minor changes in understory cover
and species richness at both sites. However, plant cover and species richness were both negatively correlated
with tree density. Degraded conditions at the sites appeared to be stable, and we suggest that treatments imple-
mented in our studies may have not been intensive enough to produce signiﬁcant understory responses and
meet restoration objectives. Managers aiming to restore understory diversity at similar sites may be required
to use heavier thinning prescriptions and repeated seeding. More work is needed to test new restoration ap-
proaches that are designed to drive degraded pinyon-juniper woodlands over resilience thresholds toward
more diverse understory communities.

Introduction
Pinyon-juniper ecosystems are highly variable in composition and
structure and are distributed broadly on semiarid sites across western
North America (Romme et al., 2009). Degraded ecological conditions
stemming from intensive land use are common in pinyon-juniper
woodlands and historical savannas. For example, intensive fuelwood
harvesting in the mid- to late 1800s left previously wooded landscapes
of the Great Basin and Southwest denuded of tree cover (Young and
Budy, 1979; Bahre and Hutchinson, 1985; Creque et al., 1999). Similarly,
extensive areas of woodland were converted to grassland for livestock
production by chaining, cabling, burning, and other methods in the
mid-1900s (Young and Budy, 1979; Romme et al., 2009). In contrast,
degradation in the form of increases in tree density, loss of understory
plant community abundance, and accelerated soil erosion have been
widely reported in woodlands and savannas across the range of the
pinyon-juniper type (Campbell, 1999; Jacobs and Gatewood, 1999;
Brockway et al., 2002; Romme et al., 2009). Increased tree cover in
these systems is thought to be due to a combination of natural and an-
thropogenic factors including intensive livestock grazing, climatic vari-
ability, increases in atmospheric CO2, and interruption of natural ﬁre
regimes (Altschul and Fairley, 1989; Shinneman et al., 2008; Poulos
et al., 2009; Romme et al., 2009; Margolis, 2014). Even in persistent
woodlands where tree cover may have been minimally affected by ﬁre
exclusion, intensive livestock grazing has resulted in decreases in un-
derstory diversity and increased soil erosion (Beymer and Klopatek,
1992; Shinneman et al., 2008). On severely degraded sites, ecological
conditions may represent alternative stable states that are resistant to
restoration treatments.
Since Holling’s (1973) seminal discourse on the topic of ecosystem
dynamics, the term “resilience” has received much attention in scientiﬁc
literature and ﬁelds of natural resource management. Holling (1973)
deﬁned ecological resilience as “a measure of the persistence of systems
and of their ability to absorb change and disturbance and still maintain
the same relationships between populations or state variables.” A cen-
tral aspect of ecological resiliency is “resistance,” which is deﬁned as
the “ease or difﬁculty of changing the system” (Walker et al., 2004). Al-
though recently resilience has been viewed normatively as a desirable
property (Brand and Jax, 2007), in Holling’s (1973) original deﬁnition,
resilience is interpreted as neither desirable nor undesirable (Seidl

et al., 2015). Ecological systems functioning within natural ranges of
variability, as well as those that have been simpliﬁed or degraded,
may exhibit stable state conditions that are resistant to management
actions. For example, Carpenter and Cottingham (1997) described
processes leading to degradation and the development of new resilience
mechanisms that must be overcome to restore lake ecosystems. Suding
et al. (2004) explained that ecological resilience to restoration may
indicate a shift of a plant community to an alternative degraded state.
Similarly, Briske et al. (2008) explain that strong negative feedbacks
may increase resilience of alternative stable states and challenge
restoration of degraded rangelands.
In cases of ecosystem degradation, a goal of ecological restoration is
to drive systems from stable, degraded states, across resilience thresh-
olds, toward more desirable basins of attraction (Walker et al., 2004).
To facilitate such transition, degraded woodland systems may require
active restoration treatments that include manipulation of vegetation
structure, alteration of microclimate and soil conditions, and addition
of seeds or propagules (Rey Benayas et al., 2009). Restoration treat-
ments developed for degraded pinyon-juniper ecosystems commonly
include tree thinning, amending soil conditions by adding organic mat-
ter and thinning slash, and seeding with native understory plant species
(Jacobs and Gatewood, 1999; Huffman et al., 2008a; Jacobs, 2015). Tree
thinning can reduce interference and competitive effects and provide
more light and soil resources for understory plants. Some restoration
thinning prescriptions call for close adherence to site-speciﬁc, historical
reference conditions. This approach centers on retaining all pre-Euro-
American settlement trees (i.e., those that predate onset of industrial
land uses), plus keeping some number of postsettlement trees to
account
for
recent
mortality
and
removing
the
remainder
(e.g., Huffman et al., 2008a). In some persistent woodlands, thinning in-
tensity following this approach may be minor due to relatively high
numbers of presettlement-aged trees (Romme et al., 2009). Addition
of organic matter, commonly done by scattering woody material or
“slash” remaining from thinning activities, can ameliorate microclimatic
conditions, provide safe sites for seedling establishment, and increase
microbiotic activity in soils (Tongway and Ludwig, 1996; Breshears
and Barnes, 1999; Stoddard et al., 2008). Although thinning, slash addi-
tions, and seeding have been shown to be generally effective for increas-
ing understory production and abundance, some studies have failed to
ﬁnd important effects of these treatments (Lavin et al., 1981; Brockway
et al., 2002; Huffman et al., 2013). Seeding with native species can
increase understory cover (Redmond et al., 2014), and appropriate
seed mixes can be developed using information from local observations,
as well as reports describing species composition and relative
abundance at minimally impacted reference sites.
In this study, we examined understory plant community responses
to ecological restoration treatments at two pinyon-juniper woodland
sites in northwestern Arizona. Both sites were described by local land
managers as showing undesirable conditions in terms of high tree
density, low understory cover, and low plant species richness. These
conditions were considered to be due primarily to livestock grazing
history and changes to the natural ﬁre regimes. At these sites we
established two small, identical studies to experimentally address the
following research questions: 1) Do restoration treatments including
tree-thinning prescriptions guided by reference conditions, scattering
thinning slash, and seeding lead to increases in plant cover and species
richness? 2) How do understory responses differ across sites with
contrasting soils characteristics; and 3) Can such treatments move
understory conditions to more diverse, stable states?
Methods
Study Sites
We initiated repeated studies in 2002 at two sites (“Craig Ranch”
[CR] and “Goose Pond” [GP]) on Grand Canyon−Parashant National
Monument near Mount Trumbull, Arizona (Fig. 1). The two sites were
within 5 km of one another and were generally similar in terms of veg-
etation and woodland structure; however, the sites differed in soil char-
acteristics. Soils at the CR site (lat. 36°26′1″N, long. 113°9′40″W) are
shallow to deep gravelly sandy loams to very cobbly clays, derived
from limestone, basalt, and sandstone alluvium and colluvium. Soils at
the GP site (lat. 36°24′46″N, long. 113°12′15″W) are shallow to very
deep, very cindery loams derived from alluvial and colluvial, scoriaceous
basalt, and pyroclastics (USDA Soil Conservation Service, unpublished).
Although the sites differed in terms of soil texture and parent material,
in 2002 soils at both sites were characterized by erosion pavement, pre-
sumably due to livestock grazing. Elevation of the sites ranges approxi-
mately 1900−1950 m. Average annual precipitation in the area near
the sites is ≈50 cm and is distributed in a bimodal seasonal pattern
with
notable
peaks
during
the
months
of
July−August
and
December−January (WRCC, 2015).
Vegetation at the sites is classiﬁed as Great Basin Cold Temperature
Woodland (Brown, 1994). Overstories were composed exclusively of
pinyon pine (Pinus edulis Engelm.) and Utah juniper (Juniperus
osteosperma Torr.). Trees were generally arranged in all-aged groups
with pronounced interstitial openings (“interspaces”). Understory veg-
etation composition was typical of pinyon-juniper woodlands in north-
western Arizona. Understory vegetation was generally sparse in spatial
distribution and depauperate in species (Stoddard et al., 2008). Live-
stock grazing was halted at both sites in the early 2000s, just before ini-
tiation of this study. No livestock grazing was permitted at either site
during the course of our research.
Study Design and Field Sampling
At each of the two sites, we delineated 9 ha for study. Each 9-ha area
was divided into two 4.5-ha units, and one of each pair was randomly
selected for treatment while the other remained as an untreated con-
trol. Thus, at each site, separate but identical studies were designed.
Sample plots to characterize pretreatment conditions and post-
treatment responses of overstory structure, forest ﬂoor, and understory
vegetation were arrayed on a 60-m systematic grid, established 60 m
from the treatment boundaries within the units (i.e., 60-m treatment
buffer). Six sample plots per unit were established (N = 12 per site)
(see Fig. 1).
Sample plots established in the study units were circular and 0.04 ha
in size. For long-term monitoring purposes, we used steel rebar driven
into the soil to mark plot centers, and these points were georeferenced.
In 2002, before treatments were implemented, we measured tree den-
sity, size, and species composition; woody surface fuel loading; and un-
derstory community characteristics on each plot. All live and dead trees
on plots were numbered using aluminum tags nailed to tree bases. Spe-
cies and diameter at root collar (drc) of each tree (live and dead) were
recorded. To determine tree ages, we collected increment cores from
all live trees ≥20 cm drc and from a 20% random subsample of smaller
trees (b 20 cm drc). Fuel loading was estimated using methods de-
scribed in Brown (1974). One 15-m planar fuels transect was
established on each plot with the proximal end anchored at plot center,
and the transect direction was determined randomly. A piece of steel
rebar was driven into the soil at the distal end of each fuels transect
for subsequent relocation and remeasurement. On each transect, forest
ﬂoor depth was measured at points every 1.5 m, and layers were classi-
ﬁed as “litter” layer (recent, undecomposed) and “duff” (lower,
decomposing). Woody surface fuels intersecting transects were mea-
sured for diameter and tallied by moisture timelag classes according
to Brown (1974). Timelag classes represent the length of time required
for wetting or drying of fuels of different sizes, relative to the equilibri-
um moisture content. Timelag classes were “1-hr” (b 0.63 cm), “10-hr”
(0.63−2.5 cm), “100-hr” (2.5−7.6 cm), and “1 000-hr” (N 7.6 cm). The
largest timelag class (1 000-hr) was further subdivided into sound (“1
000-hr-s”) and rotten (“1000-hr-r”) categories. To sample understory

community characteristics, we established one 50 × 10 m belt transect
centered on each plot. Belts were oriented parallel with plot aspect,
and end points were monumented for subsequent remeasurement
using rebar. Ten 1-m2 (50 × 200 cm) quadrats were systematically
arrayed at 5-m intervals along the centerline of each belt. Within each
quadrat, we ocularly estimated cover of substrate, classiﬁed as litter,
bare soil, rock, and wood (pieces ≥7.5 cm in diameter), and plant
basal cover. We also estimated plant aerial cover by species. Within
the entire area of each belt, we catalogued all plant species observed.
Tree canopy cover was estimated using a densitometer at 16 points
equally spaced along belt centerlines. Measurements were conducted
in 2002 (pretreatment) and 2014 (10-yr post treatment). Huffman
et al. (2008a) reported on immediate post-treatment (2004) effects
on overstory structure, woody surface fuels, and understory cover.
Prescription Development and Treatment Implementation
At each site, we tested efﬁcacy of forest restoration approaches that
have been described elsewhere (see Jacobs and Gatewood, 1999; Fulé
et al., 2001; Stoddard et al., 2008). The overall goal of the prescription
developed was to increase understory cover and species richness. The
prescription included thinning trees to lower densities and approximate
overstory structure presumed to occur at the sites near the time of Euro-
American settlement (ca 1880). We also prescribed that thinning mate-
rial (tree boles, branches, and tops) would be lopped and scattered
across nearby interspaces. This technique in concert with seeding has
been shown to slow soil movement, improve soil function, and increase
understory abundance (Jacobs and Gatewood, 1999; Stoddard et al.,
2008; Jacobs, 2015).
To determine trees to be thinned and those to be retained, increment
cores collected in the ﬁeld were analyzed in the laboratory following
standard techniques of dendrochronology (Stokes and Smiley, 1996).
Linear regression of tree establishment date and drc data suggested
that pinyon pine trees N 25 cm drc were likely to be N 130 yr of age
(R2 = 0.57; P b 0.001). Age-diameter relationships for juniper were
poor (R2 b 0.15). On the basis of our ﬁndings for pinyon pine, we pre-
sumed all pinyon and juniper trees N 25 cm drc predated Euro-
American settlement of the region and live trees of this size and larger
were retained at both sites. Most trees b 25 cm drc were thinned. How-
ever, to account for trees that may have died since Euro-American set-
tlement, approximately two trees b 25 cm drc were retained for each
dead pinyon or juniper tree (snag, log, or cut stump) N 25 cm drc
found, and effort was made to retain these smaller trees near the dead
presettlement tree structures in order to approximate arrangement
and spatial variability of historical stands. Retaining a greater number
of smaller trees than indicated by dead tree evidence was precautionary
to safeguard against unanticipated, additional disturbance (Waltz et al.,
2003). Indeed, in 2002−2003 during treatment implementation, the
Southwest experienced a severe drought, which, along with an associat-
ed outbreak in pinyon ips (Ips confuses), resulted in regional-scale die-
back of pinyon pine (Breshears et al., 2005; Floyd et al., 2009). Slash
from thinned trees was lopped to ≤1 m in length and scattered. Thin-
ning was completed in November 2003. Thinning and mortality re-
duced tree densities 55−69% at the two sites.
Following completion of thinning, sites were seeded using a native
species mix. We selected ﬁve grasses, one forb, and four shrub species
(Fig. 2). Selection of species for seeding was based on observations of
local occurrence, baseline data from belt transects (see Appendix A),
and community data reported in published literature concerning relict
areas in the vicinity of our study sites (Mason et al., 1967; Thatcher
and Hart, 1974; Rowlands and Brian, 2001). We assumed a seed mix
that included species and functional groups (i.e., C3 and C4 grasses,
perennial forb, and shrubs) adapted to a variety of microhabitats
would be effective for increasing understory diversity. We used hand
seeders to broadcast at a rate of 18 kg ha−1. This rate met common
standards for range rehabilitation (Clary, 1988). We chose to seed half
the amount in late fall and half in early summer in order accommodate
germination and establishment requirements for both cool and warm
season species (see Fig. 2). Using site-preparation methods such as
plowing or disking before seeding was not feasible. Similarly, we did
not harrow or rake the restoration units after the seed was broadcast
but instead used thinning slash to provide cover and mulch for the
seeds. Seeding was done at each site in November 2003 and March
2004.

Analysis
Our main interest in this study was on effects of the restoration
treatment on understory cover and species richness at the two study
sites. We used student’s t-tests (alpha = 0.10) to compare untreated
and treated units at both sites before treatment (2002) and 10 yr post
treatment. We tested for differences between units in the following
overstory structural characteristics: tree density (no. ha−1), basal area
(m2 ha−1), relative importance of pinyon and juniper trees, and canopy
cover (%). Relative importance was calculated as the percentage of the
tree density added to the percentage of the stand basal area composed
by each species (Husch et al., 2003). Thus, an importance value of 200
for a species would indicate its complete dominance of a sample plot.
We also used t-tests to compare understory community characteristics
between untreated and treated units before treatment implementation
and 10 yr post treatment at both sites (alpha = 0.10). Characteristics
tested were total plant cover (%), as well as cover of the following
functional groups: annual forbs, cacti, shrubs, C3 graminoids, C4 grasses,
perennial forbs, shrubs, tree seedlings, and non-native plant species. We
also compared total species richness (no. 500 m−2) and richness of
species within the functional groups described earlier. Although not
statistically tested, we calculated quadrat-level frequency (%) for each
species observed at pretreatment (2002) and post-treatment (2014)
measurements. This was determined as the number of quadrats on
which a species was observed, divided by the total number of quadrats
sampled within the experimental unit (i.e., 60), multiplied by 100. To
test for relationships between plant cover and species richness, as well
as microsite variables, we used Spearman’s rank correlation test
(alpha = 0.05). Variables tested were cover (%) of litter, wood, and
rock; density of all trees and density of juniper and pinyon trees sepa-
rately; basal area of all trees and basal area of juniper and pinyon trees
separately; and canopy cover observed in 2014.
Results
CR Site
We found no differences in pretreatment (2002) means for overstory
structural characteristics (Table 1), forest ﬂoor, woody surface fuels
(Table 2), or understory community characteristics (Table 3) between
the untreated and treated units at the CR site. Thinning small (b 25 cm
drc) overstory trees shifted the diameter distribution at the CR site, from
positively skewed to closer to normal (Fig. 3B). Thinning resulted in signif-
icant differences in tree density, and 10 yr after treatment implementation
(2014), b 50% of the pretreatment number remained (see Table 1). Al-
though thinning resulted in only a 7% decrease, stand basal area was signif-
icantly different between the untreated and treated units in 2014 (see
Table 1). Thinning did not result in differences in tree species composition,
and relative importance values of pinyon and juniper remained similar be-
tween the untreated and treated units (see Table 1). Similarly, there were
no effects of treatment on tree canopy cover at the CR site and mean values
were N 23%. Litter depth was similar between the untreated and treated
units in 2014; however, duff depth was signiﬁcantly lower in the treated
unit at this time (see Table 2). We found signiﬁcantly lower surface fuel
loading in the treated unit for the 1-hr timelag class compared with the un-
treated unit. In addition, we found signiﬁcantly higher loading for the 1
000-hr sound class in the treated unit versus the untreated unit (see
Table 2). Loading was similar between units for all other wood surface
fuel classes 10 yr after treatment at the CR site.
Total understory cover (all functional groups) in 2014 was signiﬁ-
cantly higher in the treated unit (7.0% ± 4.8 SD) compared with the un-
treated (3.7% ± 2.9 SD) unit at the CR site in 2014. This result appeared
to be driven by small differences in both C3 graminoids and C4 grasses,
shrubs, and tree seedling cover; however, no statistically signiﬁcant dif-
ferences in cover within individual functional groups were detected be-
tween the untreated and treated units (see Table 3). Plant cover showed

signiﬁcant, negative correlations with juniper density and tree basal
area (Table 4). We found no signiﬁcant difference in total species rich-
ness between the untreated and treated units at the CR site; however,
the treated unit had signiﬁcantly more C4 grass and shrub species than
the untreated unit (see Table 3). Similar to our ﬁndings for understory
cover, species richness showed signiﬁcant, negative correlations with
tree basal area, juniper basal area, and canopy cover (see Table 4).
GP Site
Similar to the CR site, we found no differences in pretreatment
(2002) means for overstory structural characteristics (see Table 1), for-
est ﬂoor, woody surface fuels (see Table 2), or understory community
characteristics (Table 5) between the untreated and treated units at
the GP site. Tree thinning resulted in signiﬁcantly lower tree density
in the treated unit compared with the untreated unit (see Table 1)
and led to a more even distribution of size classes 10 yr post treatment
as compared with pretreatment conditions (Fig. 3D). However, we
found no signiﬁcant difference in tree basal area between units. Thin-
ning resulted in signiﬁcant differences in relative importance of tree
species, with pinyon pine showing relatively lower dominance and juni-
per gaining dominance in the treated unit compared with the untreated
unit (see Table 1). We found no signiﬁcant difference between units in
canopy cover, and means were N 21%. Forest ﬂoor depths and woody
surface fuel loading were variable. No signiﬁcant differences for any of
these variables were detected between the untreated and treated
units at the GP site (see Table 2).
Total understory plant cover ranged 4.6−4.9%, and we found no
signiﬁcant difference between the untreated and treated units at the
GP site in 2014. Similarly, few differences in cover were detected within
plant functional groups; however, we found signiﬁcantly greater cover
of C3 graminoids and C4 grasses in the treated compared with the
untreated unit (see Table 5). Total understory plant cover showed
signiﬁcant negative correlations with pinyon pine tree density and
pinyon basal area (see Table 4). Signiﬁcantly more species were found
in the treated unit than the untreated unit, and this difference appeared
to be driven by richness of native species including C3 graminoids and C4
grasses (see Table 5). Richness showed signiﬁcant negative correlations
with total tree density and pinyon pine density (see Table 4).
Discussion
Tree thinning prescriptions that aimed to approximate presettle-
ment stand structure and species composition resulted in signiﬁcant re-
ductions in tree density at both the CR and GP sites, as well as reductions
in tree basal area at the GP site (see also Huffman et al., 2008a). Tree
density changes were mainly driven by thinning of smaller trees be-
cause these were presumed to be relatively young (i.e., not presettle-
ment). Boles, branches, and tops of the thinned trees were scattered
across the study sites; however, this material resulted in few changes
to woody surface fuel loading. Thinning and addition of woody material,
along with seeding, resulted in only minor changes in understory cover
and species richness at both sites. Understory responses appeared relat-
ed to microsite conditions as evidenced by signiﬁcant negative correla-
tions with tree density at both sites. In addition, Spearman’s rho values
were relatively high and suggested positive correlations between un-
derstory response and wood cover at both sites, although these relation-
ships were not statistically signiﬁcant (see Table 3). Thus, although the
two sites contrasted in terms of soil characteristics, understory re-
sponses to restoration treatments at both sites appeared to be similar.
Minor changes in cover and species richness at CR and GP contrast
with results of other studies that have reported signiﬁcant increases in
herbaceous cover following similar pinyon-juniper restoration treat-
ments (e.g., Jacobs and Gatewood, 1999; Stoddard et al., 2008; Jacobs,
2015). For example, Jacobs and Gatewood (1999) studied restoration re-
sponses on two pinyon-juniper savanna sites in New Mexico and found
total herbaceous cover on untreated controls ranged about 15−38%,
whereas herbaceous cover on plots where all trees were removed ranged
about 71−75%. At these sites, notable herbaceous responses may be

expected due to soil conditions and a relatively high monsoon index
(i.e., proportion of annual precipitation occurring during the summer)
(Romme et al., 2009). In contrast, at woodland sites where summer
precipitation is less important, herbaceous understory productivity may
be expected to be low. However, Stoddard et al. (2008) reported under-
story cover to increase from 1.6% to 16.3%, and from 0.4% to 12.4%, 2 yr fol-
lowing slash addition and seeding on small plots at two woodland sites
immediately adjacent to CR and GP, respectively. It should be noted that
experimental plots used by Stoddard et al. (2008) were located in open
interspaces, and community responses on microsites under tree canopy
were not examined. Furthermore, experimental seeding rates tested by
Stoddard et al. (2008) were more than fourfold higher than those applied
in our study. Jameson (1967) described a negative exponential relation-
ship between herbaceous production and tree canopy cover for pinyon-
juniper woodlands in northern Arizona. In this relationship, the inﬂection
point of the curve was near 25%, and herbage production changed rela-
tively little across higher values (N 25%) of canopy cover (Jameson,
1967). Thus, although we did not investigate biomass, understory cover
responses in our studies may have been limited in part by negligible dif-
ferences in tree canopy cover between treated and untreated units. In
fact, due to drought-related mortality taking place during treatment im-
plementation, canopy cover at the GP sites was higher in the treated
unit than in the untreated unit (see Table 1). More intensive thinning
may be needed to reverse severe degradation of understory communities
in these woodland sites.
Minor increases in plant cover at the two sites may also have been
related to the quantities of slash added to the soil surfaces in treatment
implementation. Slash and residue from tree thinning serve a number of
beneﬁcial functions for improving environmental conditions for under-
story plant communities and restoring semiarid woodlands (Lavin et al.,
1981; Breshears and Barnes, 1999; Jacobs, 2015). For example, Tongway
and Ludwig (1996) showed that placement of Acacia ancura branches
on degraded soil patches increased water inﬁltration and soil respira-
tion, decreased erosion rates, moderated surface temperatures, and in-
creased nitrogen availability in the woodlands of Australia. Similarly,
Hastings et al. (2003) reported reduced erosion after harvesting slash
was added to microsites on pinyon-juniper watersheds of New

Mexico. Stoddard et al. (2008) showed that slash additions decreased
soil movement, increased potential for arbuscular mycorrhizae, and in-
creased soil microbial biomass. However, Stoddard et al. (2008) exper-
imentally applied slash at rates 6−17× and 6−8× higher than mean
post-treatment slash totals we observed, respectively, at the CR and
GP sites (see Table 2). Because of the documented beneﬁts of slash ad-
dition for restoration of semiarid woodlands, we did not test for effects
of slash removal activities, such as broadcast burning or mastication, on
understory responses. Other studies have indicated that burning slash
may increase nutrient availability in soils, shift understory species com-
position, and increase cover of non-native species (Haskins and
Gehring, 2004; Bates et al., 2011; Huffman et al., 2013; Redmond
et al., 2014). Results from our studies suggest that treatments
(i.e., tree thinning, addition of slash, and seeding) may have not been in-
tensive enough at either site to produce substantial understory re-
sponses and achieve successful restoration within a 10- to 15-yr
timeframe.
Resilience of degraded ecosystems and the importance of recogniz-
ing alternative stable states and positive feedbacks have been previous-
ly discussed in literature related to conservation and restoration ecology
(Westoby et al., 1989; Friedel, 1991; Laycock, 1991; Suding et al., 2004;
Savage and Mast, 2005). For example, Friedel (1991) described environ-
mental thresholds that, once crossed, would allow arid rangelands to
rapidly transition to new stable states that were not easily reversed.
Similarly, Laycock (1991) reviewed cases of ecological degradation re-
ported in various rangeland systems that showed little response to pas-
sive restoration that removed or reduced numbers of grazers at the
study sites. Jameson (1987) theorized a cusp-catastrophe model for
pinyon-juniper ecosystem dynamics, controlled primarily by relative
moisture, grazing, and ﬁre. In this model, transition between grassland
and woodland states could be abrupt and woodlands, once established,
could be persistent under various climatic conditions (Jameson, 1987).
Allen (2002) described changes in pinyon-juniper woodlands of
Bandelier National Monument wherein intensive livestock grazing and
reduced ﬁre frequency following Euro-American settlement in the late
1800s led to increases in tree establishment and contributed to acceler-
ated erosion and soil degradation. We suggest that similar processes oc-
curred at the CR and GP study sites. For example, Altschul and Fairley
(1989) described early reports of range depletion on the Arizona Strip,
including on the landscape now within the Grand Canyon−Parashant
National Monument, beginning with settlement of the region around
1870. Overgrazing during this time resulted from expanding herds of
horses and cattle, seasonally large numbers of sheep, and successive se-
vere droughts (Altschul and Fairley, 1989). Mid−20th century range
reports on ﬁle with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) (Arizona
Strip District Ofﬁce, BLM, St. George, Utah, unpublished) indicate that
grass cover in our study area had been depleted by unregulated grazing
before 1900, and intensive livestock use continued through 1969. Ex-
amination of repeat aerial photographs and historical maps indicated
that water sources for livestock were improved (catchments, pipelines,
etc.) after 1940 at both sites (Huffman et al., 2008a). Fire history of the
site is not known, but other studies of woodlands in the region have in-
dicated ﬁre regimes characterized by infrequent, high-severity ﬁres
(Rowlands and Brian, 2001; Huffman et al., 2008b; Bauer and Weisberg,
2009). Thus, intensive and persistent livestock grazing, periodic
droughts, and possibly reduced ﬁre disturbance, in concert, may have
led to deterioration of understory communities and transition of the
woodlands at our two study sites to new degraded stable states. Condi-
tions at the sites presently appear to be resistant to the treatments test-
ed, which were intended to produce notable increases in understory
cover and species richness.
Implications
Resilient degraded conditions, resistant to restoration prescriptions
that are based on approximating site-speciﬁc historical conditions, pres-
ent land managers with a conundrum. Managers are faced with choos-
ing between strict adherence to prescriptions that use historical
conditions as targets and those that may be more intensive and rely
on successional processes to return woodland structure to within natu-
ral ranges of variation over longer periods of time. For example, in our
study, heavier thinning that signiﬁcantly reduced canopy cover would
require cutting presettlement trees. Heavier thinning may encourage
greater understory increases (Jameson, 1967) and also would be ex-
pected to produce more woody material for improving soil conditions
and microclimate in open interspaces (Stoddard et al., 2008). Further,
successful restoration of understory diversity may require seeding at
heavier rates than tested in our studies. More work is needed to test
new restoration approaches that are designed to drive degraded
pinyon-juniper woodlands over resilience thresholds toward more di-
verse understory communities.
