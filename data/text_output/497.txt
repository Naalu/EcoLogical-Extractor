The Ecological Restoration Institute is dedicated to the restoration of fire-adapted forests and woodlands. ERI provides services that support the social and 
economic vitality of communities that depend on forests and the natural resources and ecosystem services they provide. Our efforts focus on science-based 
research of ecological and socio-economic issues related to restoration as well as support for on-the-ground treatments, outreach and education.

Reference Conditions and Historical Fine-Scale Spatial Dynamics in a  
Dry Mixed-Conifer Forest, Arizona, USA 
By Kyle Rodman, University of Colorado Boulder, Department of Geography 
Introduction 
Reference conditions of forests — including the stand densities, species compositions, and tree spatial patterns 
prior to Euro-American settlement — are useful to silviculturists and other forest managers when developing pre-
scriptions and assessing the efficacy of restoration treatments. Dry mixed-conifer forests cover up to 3 million 
acres in the southwestern United States, and active management within these systems is commonplace. However, 
little is known about reference conditions and the natural ranges of variability (NRV) within southwestern dry 
mixed-conifer forests, particularly with respect to fine-scale spatial patterns.  
 
Fine-scale (less than 10 acres) patterns in many southwestern forests are often referred to as a “shifting mosaic” 
made up of isolated single trees, groups of trees with interlocking crowns, openings, and grassy interspaces. 
These spatial patterns are dynamic, and are likely driven by the location of safe sites for tree regeneration due to 
local moisture availability, reduced competition with the herbaceous understory, or small patches of overstory 
mortality. Tree spatial patterns also influence numerous ecological processes including fine-scale disturbance 
dynamics (e.g., wildfire and bark beetle-induced tree mortality), tree regeneration, and variability in the under-
story microclimate (reviewed by Reynolds et al. 2013). In this study, we quantify reference conditions within 
four dry mixed-conifer stands on the Mogollon Rim, Arizona, improving knowledge of the NRV for these im-
portant and biodiverse forests. In a landscape adjacent to the study plots, it was found that wildfires were fre-
quent historically, but widespread fires have not occurred since 1879 due to Euro-American influences, promot-
ing substantial changes in forest structure and composition (Huffman et al. 2015). 
 
Methods 
 
We identified four, 2.5-acre 
plots on the Mogollon Rim, 
Arizona, within the Co-
conino National Forest. All 
plots were in productive 
stands on sedimentary soils.  
 
We extensively surveyed 
each plot, collecting spatial 
data and tree cores. 
 
Using these data, we recon-
structed historical (ca. 1879) 
forest density, species com-
position, and spatial pattern 
on each of the plots, and 
compared this to 2014 data.

Figure 1. Changes in the dry mixed-conifer forest plots on the Mogollon Rim, Arizona, USA, 
between 1879 (dendrochronological reconstruction) and 2014 (observed). Panels include histor-
ical (a–d) and contemporary (e–h) stem maps of each plot, where circles are trees scaled by 
canopy area. Tones for each species are scaled by relative shade and fire tolerance ranging from 
black (most shade tolerant/least fire tolerant) to white (least shade tolerant/most fire tolerant).  

Key Findings 
 
All plots increased in density. Mean densities increased from 56.7 trees ac-1 and 44.7 ft2 ac-1 of basal area 
in 1879, to 451.7 trees ac-1 and 184.8 ft2 ac-1 of basal area in 2014. 
 
Species composition shifted. While densities for nearly all species increased, shade tolerant and mid-
tolerant tree species (e.g., Douglas-fir and white fir) made a greater contribution to the increases in stand den-
sity, and are more prevalent than they were historically. These species are less resistant to fire than ponderosa 
pine. 
 
Stand-scale spatial patterns varied. Two of four stands analyzed showed grouped spatial arrangements 
in 1879, while trees on the other sites were randomly distributed (i.e. trees may grow in groups, but no more 
than expected due to random chance). 
 
Spatial patterns differ by species. Shade tolerant/fire intolerant species (e.g., white fir) and hardwoods 
were more likely to be found in groups than were other species, while shade intolerant/fire tolerant species 
(e.g., ponderosa pine) were more likely to be found as isolated individuals. 
 
Single-species and mixed-species groups were both common in 1879. 
 
 
 
 
Management Implications 
 
Many dry mixed-conifer forests on the Mogollon Rim, Arizona, have increased in density and experienced a 
shift toward the dominance of fire intolerant conifers since the late 1800s (Figure 1, Table 1). Mechanical 
treatments, prescribed fire, and managed wildfire should be used to reduce stand densities and promote a shift 
to more fire tolerant species, especially ponderosa pine and Gambel oak.  
 
A mixture of spatial patterns at both the stand and fine scales should be a goal of silviculturists. Trees on some 
dry mixed-conifer sites show a tendency to grow in groups, while on other sites trees are randomly arranged. 
Group sizes ranged from one to nine trees historically. 
 
Knowledge of tree silvics (the traits and general ecology of each species) as it relates to spatial patterns should 
be incorporated into prescriptions and marking guides. Shade tolerant species are more likely to be found in 
large tree groups (five or more trees) than are shade intolerant species. Large tree groups often have multiple 
species within them.
