Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests occur at their warmer, drier environmental limits in the Mogollon
Highlands ecoregion (MHE) of the Southwestern United States, and are commonly found in stringers or discrete
stands that form ecotones with interior chaparral. These “rear edge” forests are likely to be highly vulnerable to
rapid changes in structure and composition with climate warming, drought, and wildﬁre. There is increasing
interest in understanding historical conditions, ecosystem changes, and restoration needs for MHE forests.
However, comprehensive reconstruction analysis of ﬁre regimes and stand structure has not been done for these
systems, which diﬀer from many montane ponderosa pine forests by having an abundance of understory shrubs.
In this study we used demographic data from ﬁeld plots, ﬁre scar samples, and dendroecology to reconstruct
historical ﬁre regimes and landscape structure at ponderosa pine-dominated sites that spanned a range of en-
vironmental conditions on the Prescott and Tonto National Forests. We found strong evidence of historical
surface ﬁre regimes with mean ﬁre intervals ranging 1.3–15.6 years across the ﬁve MHE sites during the period
1700–1879. We found very little evidence of historical high-severity ﬁre at any study site. Historical forest
structure was open with tree densities ranging 84.7–136.4 trees ha−1 and stand basal area (BA) ranging
4.5–8.4 m2 ha−1. Historical composition showed codominance of ponderosa pine, Arizona white oak (Quercus
arizonica), Emory oak (Q. emoryi), and Gambel oak (Q. gambelii). Thus, oak species and likely other hardwoods
were important historical components of these ecosystems. Contemporary forests are greater in stand density
and BA by 359–703% and 285–502%, respectively, compared to historical estimates. In addition, we observed
contemporary shifts in species composition. Changes related to disruption of historical ﬁre regimes have in-
creased susceptibility of ponderosa pine forests in the MHE to rapid shifts in structure and composition that may
come about with climate change and high-intensity wildﬁre. Meeting fuels reduction and ecological restoration
goals will be challenging for land managers due to vigorous regeneration responses of shrubs to tree thinning,
prescribed burning, or other management activities. Managers will be required to balance attention to historical
reference conditions, conservation of biological diversity, and needs for fuels management.
1. Introduction
It is well understood that many forest ecosystems of the western
United States have undergone large changes in structure and function
due to industrial land uses commencing with Euro-American settlement
in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (Covington et al., 1994;
Hessburg et al., 2019). Understanding ecological conditions and
variability that existed prior to these changes is important to resource
managers, who use this information to interpret contemporary eco-
system dynamics and determine best courses of action, which may
include ecological restoration (SER, 2004). Managers rely on reference
information that characterizes attributes of forest structure, function,
and disturbance patterns over timeframes relevant to management ac-
tivities (Landres et al., 1999; Moore et al., 1999). It is assumed that
predegraded forest conditions were resilient to climatic ﬂuctuations
and characteristic disturbance, and the best way to conserve species is
to manage habitat with the natural range of variation (Gauthier et al.,
1996; Bergeron et al., 2004; Romme et al., 2012; Hessburg et al., 2019).
In forests of the western United States, various contemporary and his-
torical sources are used to develop reference information. Techniques of

dendroecology are especially well-suited for reconstructing disturbance
processes, forest structure, and stand composition (Fulé et al., 1997;
Swetnam et al., 1999; Huﬀman et al., 2001; Sánchez Meador et al.,
2010). For example, analysis of crossdated ﬁre scars sampled from
across a landscape can help to accurately describe several parameters of
past ﬁre regimes, including surface ﬁre frequency, size, severity, and
season of occurrence (Swetnam and Baisan, 1996). Additionally, ana-
lysis of annual growth rings from living trees and dead wood can pro-
vide information concerning establishment dates, mortality patterns,
growth, and past tree size (Swetnam et al., 1999). In ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa) forests of the Southwestern United States, low de-
composition rates and persistence of dead wood areas that have ex-
perienced ﬁre suppression, enhance accuracy of dendroecological re-
constructions (Mast et al., 1999; Huﬀman et al., 2001; Moore et al.,
2004).
Fire regime and stand reconstructions have been conducted ex-
tensively in southwestern ponderosa pine forests. Pre-Euro-American
settlement return intervals have been reported to range from about 4 to
36 years (Swetnam and Baisan, 1996; Reynolds et al., 2013), and tree
ring records as well as other paleoecological evidence suggest that dry
forests of the region have experienced frequent, recurrent ﬁre for
thousands of years (Swetnam et al., 1999; Allen, 2002). Fire regimes in
the southwestern ponderosa pine forests are thought to be controlled by
bottom-up factors such as fuels and topography at local to landscape
scales. In addition, Native Americans in this region utilized ﬁre to meet
various resource and social needs, but eﬀects of intentional burning on
past ﬁre regimes are poorly understood (see Allen, 2002; Liebmann
et al., 2016). Decadal- and multi-decadal climatic patterns, particularly
El Nino-Sothern Oscillation, are important in exerting top-down control
and synchronizing ﬁre occurrence at regional scales (Swetnam and
Brown, 2011; Ireland et al., 2012). Despite this extensive understanding
of ﬁre regimes in southwestern ponderosa pine forests, uncertainty
remains concerning historical ﬁre regimes and modern anthropogenic
changes for some complex southwestern ecoregions such as the Mo-
gollon Highlands.
The Mogollon Highlands ecoregion (hereafter “MHE”) occurs be-
tween approximately 1065 m and 2100 m in elevation along the
Mogollon Rim of Arizona between the montane and high desert en-
vironments of the Colorado Plateau and the lowlands and basins of the
Sonoran Desert (Fleischner et al., 2017). The ecoregion roughly corre-
sponds to Arizona’s Transition Zone, a physiographic subdivision and
area of geologic transition between the Colorado Plateau and Basin and
Range provinces (Peirce, 1985; Hendricks and Plescia, 1991). Here,
ponderosa pine forests occur at their environmental limits, particularly
with respect to maximum temperature and vapor pressure deﬁcit tol-
erance, and as such have been described as “fringe” communities (Moir
et al., 1997). Such transitional forests have also been referred to as
“trailing edge” or “rear edge” ecosystems due to their vulnerability to
climate change (Parks et al., 2019; Allen and Breshears, 1998; Savage
and Mast, 2005). Forest stands in the MHE commonly form ecotones
with interior chaparral, pinyon-juniper woodlands, and the northern-
most reaches of Madrean evergreen woodland communities (Brown,
1994). As opposed to the primarily herbaceous understory plant com-
munities found in more montane ponderosa pine forests, MHE forests
are presently typiﬁed by an abundance of persistent, woody shrubs.
Most hardwood shrubs and trees in these communities rapidly re-
establish after ﬁre and other disturbance through sprouting and/or
dormant seed strategies (Cable, 1975; Pase and Brown, 1994). Limited
research has suggested that low-severity surface ﬁre regimes prevailed
in some transitional forests prior to Euro-American settlement of the
Southwest region in the late 1800s (Dieterich and Hibbert, 1990; Kaib
et al., 2000; Sneed et al., 2002). To date, no rigorous reconstructions of
these forests have been done, but it has been surmised that frequent ﬁre
regimes maintained low shrub cover and open forest structural condi-
tions (Kaib et al., 2000). In this study we used demographic data from
systematically collected ﬁre scar samples and ﬁeld plot measurements
to reconstruct historical ﬁre regimes and landscape structure at pon-
derosa pine-dominated sites that spanned a range of environmental
conditions on the Prescott and Tonto National Forests in Arizona’s
MHE. We selected sites that typiﬁed trailing edge forests where cha-
parral shrubs and evergreen oaks were abundant in the plant commu-
nities. We addressed the following questions: (1) What were the pre-
dominant characteristics of the historical ﬁre regimes of these sites? (2)
What were the historical forest structural characteristics? (3) How were
ponderosa pine trees and stands distributed across landscapes? And, (4)
have ﬁre regimes and forest structure changed substantially since Euro-
American settlement (late 1800s)? We expected that ﬁndings from this
research would have implications for management of these complex
forest ecosystems.
2. Methods
2.1. Study sites
To investigate historical ﬁre regimes and structural characteristics
in MHE forests, we looked for sites with ponderosa pine dominance and
little evidence of recent disturbance. Ideally, ﬁre regime reconstruc-
tions are conducted on large, remote landscapes to ensure historical
evidence is intact and to capture spatial variation related to changes in
vegetation and topography (Fulé et al., 2003). However, MHE land-
scapes are heterogeneous in vegetation structure, and fuels reduction
activities have been implemented within many of the larger ponderosa
pine patches. We examined high-resolution satellite imagery (e.g., Na-
tional Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP)) and Terrestrial Ecosystem
Survey maps (Robertson, 2000) to search for areas with relatively un-
disturbed ponderosa pine forest and were able to identify several
sites > 100 ha in size for our study. We assumed that sites ≥100 ha
would allow us to quantify landscape ﬁre patterns as well as capture
variability in historical overstory characteristics (Swetnam and Baisan,
1996; Van Horne and Fulé, 2006). We identiﬁed two study sites
(Schoolhouse Gulch (SCH) and Spruce Ridge (SPR)) on the Bradshaw
District of the Prescott National Forest and three sites (Ellison Creek
(ELL), Horton Creek (HOR), and West Prong of Gentry Creek (PRO)) on
the Payson District of the Tonto National Forest (Fig. 1). Although the
sites spanned a range of environmental conditions (Table 1), we did not
select them to represent a gradient, or in order to address ﬁne-scale
questions; rather, we treated sites as independent examples of broad
patterns related to ﬁre regimes and historical structure of ponderosa
pine forests of the MHE. Sites ranged 1720–2270 m in elevation, and
annual precipitation averages ranged 605–818 mm across the ﬁve sites.
Soils varied across sites with igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary
parent materials represented (Table 1). Vegetation at the sites varied
with microclimatic qualities and sub-regional biogeography. On higher,
moister sites, oak species that can attain tree form and occur in both
chaparral and Madrean evergreen woodland communities include Ar-
izona white oak (Quercus arizonica), Emory oak (Q. emoryi), and Gambel
oak (Q. gambelii). Woodland species such as pinyon pines (P. edulis, and
P. edulis var. fallax) and junipers (Juniperus deppeana, J. osteosperma,
and J. monosperma) are also common. Emory oak and Arizona white oak
were common overstory associates at the SCH site; whereas, at SPR,
Gambel oak was common and Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii) was
found in scattered occurrence. Tonto sites were also comprised of
ponderosa pine, Emery oak, and Arizona white oak, with additional
notable occurrence of alligator juniper (J. deppeana). Emory and white
oak grow to be tree form and readily sprout when topkilled by ﬁre
(Barton and Poulos, 2018). In addition, understory vegetation at the
sites showed species typical of interior chaparral communities and in-
cluded various shrub species such as shrub live oak (Q. turbinella),
alder-leaf mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus montanus), Fendler’s cea-
nothus (Ceanothus fendleri), Wright’s silktassel (Garrya wrightii) and
pointleaf and Pringle manzanita (Arctostaphylos pungens and A. pringlei).

2.2. Fire scar sampling
Each site was systematically searched for trees with large ﬁre
wounds, or “catfaces,” wherein multiple ﬁre scars were apparent (Arno
and Sneck, 1977). When catfaces were found and the wood appeared
sound, partial cross-sections containing ﬁre scars were collected using
chainsaws. Such ﬁre scar samples were “targeted” for sampling from
spatially distributed locations across each study site. Targeted sampling
is commonly used in ﬁre history reconstructions (Farris et al., 2013)
and is intended to optimize the number of ﬁre dates included in analysis
without excessive collection of wood samples. Accuracy of ﬁre fre-
quency estimates from targeted sampling has been shown to be high
(Van Horne and Fulé, 2006; Farris et al., 2013). For each partial cross-
section sampled, spatial coordinates were recorded as well as other
notes related to tree species and condition (e.g., log, stump, living tree,
etc.).
2.3. Forest structure plots
For each study site, we used a geographic information system (GIS)
Fig. 1. Study sites used to reconstruct historical ﬁre regimes and stand structure of ponderosa pine forests in the Mogollon Highland ecoregion in Arizona, USA (red
dotted boundary). Two sites (SCH, SPR) were located within the Prescott National Forest, and three sites (ELL, HOR, and PRO) were within the Tonto National Forest.

to construct a systematic grid (300-m) of sample points within the
previously determined site boundary (see Study sites). These site maps,
along with handheld global positioning system (GPS) units, were used
to locate points in the ﬁeld. At each ﬁeld point, we established circular
sample plots (0.04 ha) and took measurements of live and dead trees
and understory shrubs. For each live tree > 10 cm in diameter at
breast height (dbh – measured at 1.37 m above ground; Avery and
Burkhart (1983)) located on a sample plot, we recorded species and
measured dbh to the nearest 0.1 cm. All trees were examined for evi-
dence of past ﬁre such as charring or ﬁre scars. We extracted increment
cores from all live trees that met predetermined diameter limits to as-
sure adequate sampling of trees that likely originated prior to Euro-
American settlement of the region (Moore et al., 2004). For ponderosa
pine, Douglas ﬁr, and most other conifers, the diameter limit for in-
crement core sampling was 37.5 cm dbh. For slower growing conifers
(e.g., junipers and pinyon pine) as well as hardwoods, the diameter
limit was set to 17 cm dbh. Conifers with diameters smaller than these
limits were randomly cored at a rate of 10%, and small hardwoods
(< 17 cm dbh) were cored at a rate of 5%. Species, diameter, and
condition were recorded for all dead tree structures located on each
sample plot. For standing dead trees, condition classes were used that
represented stages of decomposition from recently deceased to highly
decomposed snags (Thomas et al., 1979). Cut stumps were recorded as
“historically cut” or “recently cut.” Historically cut stumps were those
that appeared weathered, with most of the sapwood decomposed, and
were usually
>
40 cm in height (Fulé et al., 1997). Trees and
shrubs ≤10 cm dbh were tallied in size classes by species and condi-
tion. Size classes used for these smaller trees and shrubs were the fol-
lowing: (1) ≤40 cm height; (2) > 40 and ≤80 cm height; (3) > 80
and ≤137 cm height; (4) > 137 cm height and ≤5 cm dbh; and
(5) > 137 cm height and > 5 and ≤10 cm dbh.
2.4. Fire regime analysis
We prepared ﬁre scar samples for analysis by gluing them onto
plywood when necessary to support the pieces, cutting into thinner
cross-sections with a table saw, and sanding with progressively ﬁner
grit paper to increase discernibility of annual rings. The rings were
crossdated using standard methods of dendrochronology (Stokes and
Smiley, 1996) and local master chronologies. We measured annual ring
widths, and then veriﬁed crossdating using COFECHA computer soft-
ware (Grissino-Mayer, 2001). Fire dates were identiﬁed and a sub-
sample (5%) was independently examined by a second analyst to verify
ﬁre scar quality and ﬁre dates. We included only samples with two or
more ﬁre scars in analysis, and only one sample was analyzed per tree.
We assumed this method would reduce the inﬂuence of smaller ﬁres
and lightning scars and provide a conservative estimate of surface ﬁre
patterns. Few samples showed annual rings or ﬁre dates prior to the late
1600 s and preliminary analysis indicated an abrupt change in ﬁre
frequency at all sites in the late 1870 s. Previous studies have explained
similar abrupt changes as resulting from intensive livestock grazing and
interruption of surface fuel layers associated with Eur-American set-
tlement in the Southwest region (Swetnam and Baisan, 1996, Fulé et al.,
1997). Therefore, we identiﬁed a ﬁre exclusion date of 1879, and
analyzed the two periods of 1700–1879 (i.e. pre-Euro-American set-
tlement) and 1880–2016 (post-settlement) separately for all sites. We
focused on the pre-Euro-American settlement period of 1700–1879 for
reporting of results. We composited ﬁre dates for all samples that met
the above constraints and calculated ﬁre history statistics using the Fire
History Analysis and Exploration System (FHAES) computer application
(Brewer et al., 2019). We calculated mean ﬁre return interval for all ﬁre
dates (MFIAll) for each site, and also calculated mean ﬁre interval for
ﬁre dates that occurred on 10% (MFI10) and 25% (MFI25) of the samples
for each site. The composite analysis provides an estimate of ﬁre oc-
currence on the landscape but is not spatially explicit. The process of
ﬁltering data from MFIAll to MFI25 provides a range of interval estimates
for progressively more widespread ﬁres (Swetnam and Baisan, 1996).
We also calculated the ratio MFI25:MFIAll, which can be interpreted as
the probability of a “smaller” ﬁre (1/MFIAll) versus the probability of a
“larger” ﬁre (1/MFI25) occurring in any given year (i.e., 1/MFIAll ÷ 1/
MFI25 = MFI25:MFIAll). As suggested by Baker and Ehle (2001), we also
calculated the mean point ﬁre interval (MPFI), which is not an analysis
of composited ﬁre dates but rather is calculated from intervals between
scars on individual trees and provides an estimate of ﬁre occurrence at a
consistent point on the landscape. Point interval typically yields longer
MFI estimates than composited ﬁre dates (Van Horne and Fulé, 2006).
Although ﬁltering composited ﬁre dates provides a way to interpret
the relative importance of ﬁres of diﬀerent sizes, we also quantiﬁed ﬁre
sizes by mapping ﬁre dates in ArcGIS 10.2.1 and using a convex hull
algorithm to build ﬁre polygons. Polygons were constructed from like
ﬁre dates found on three or more tree samples and then used as ﬁre size
estimates for the given year (North et al., 2005; Shapiro-Miller et al.,
2007). This approach may be imprecise as it assumes ﬁres completely
burned the area within the polygons and that complete ﬁre perimeters
are evidenced by scarred trees.
2.5. Dendroecological reconstruction of forest characteristics
We reconstructed historical stand structure from ﬁeld plot data and
tree increment core samples following procedures outlined in Fulé et al.
(1997), Huﬀman et al. (2001), Bakker et al. (2008), and Rodman et al.
(2017). Increment cores collected from live trees on ﬁeld plots were
taken to the laboratory, aﬃxed to wooden mounts, and sanded with
progressively ﬁner sandpaper until annual rings could be easily cross-
dated under a dissection microscope. After crossdating, we measured
annual ring increments radially from the most recent complete ring
(i.e., 2016) back to 1879 (ﬁre exclusion date) for trees that established
or predated this year. Radial increment data as well as ﬁeld measure-
ments of dbh, diameter at stump height (40 cm; dsh), and tree condition
for all trees sampled on plots, were entered into a stand reconstruction
model described by Bakker et al. (2008). In this model, a series of
routines are applied to estimate tree diameter of live trees, snags, logs,
and cut stumps, for a user-deﬁned year in the past. As ﬁre regime
characteristics abruptly changed in 1879, we deﬁned this year as the
reconstruction date. Core increment values allow estimation of dbh for
older trees while species-speciﬁc growth equations are used to estimate
historical diameter for trees without increment core data. Death dates
are estimated for dead structures (snags, logs, stumps) and dbh esti-
mates for these trees are calculated from species-speciﬁc growth func-
tions. Details of the reconstruction model routines are provided in
Bakker et al. (2008). Huﬀman et al. (2001) compared outputs from this
reconstruction model (Bakker et al., 2008) against actual historical data
recorded in 1909–1913, and found that model errors for stand density
and tree sizes ranged 7–12%. We used reconstruction model estimates
of 1879 tree diameters on each plot to calculate tree density (trees
ha−1), basal area (BA; m2 ha−1), and quadratic mean tree diameter
(QMD). QMD is a conventional forestry metric, and is useful as it pro-
vides an estimate of the diameter of a tree of average basal area (Davis
and Johnson, 1987).
2.6. Analysis
Landscape structure of ponderosa pine stands in 1879 was analyzed
for each site using tree density summaries from ﬁeld plot data.
Ponderosa pine tree densities (trees ha−1) were calculated for each
plot, and tree density surfaces for each site were created using the in-
verse distance weighted interpolation (IDW) algorithm in ArcGIS
10.2.1.

classes: < 25; 26–75; 76–100; and > 100 tree ha−1, and patch metrics

density and BA were tested for diﬀerences at the ﬁve sites using
Student’s t-tests for paired samples. For each site, plot values at each
point in time were treated as samples. We also used permutational
multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) to compare diﬀer-
ences in overstory composition at each site for each point in time (i.e.,
1879 v. 2017). Compositional diﬀerences were based on tree densities
of overstory species present at the given point in time. We used the PC-
Ord computer application (McCune and Meﬀord 2016) for PERMAN-
OVA, and signiﬁcance for all statistical tests was indicated if p < 0.05.
3. Results
3.1. Historical ﬁre regimes
All study sites on the Prescott (SCH and SPR) and Tonto (ELL, HOR,
and PRO) National Forests showed strong evidence of historical surface
ﬁre regimes. On the Prescott National Forest, we collected 49 partial
cross-section samples at SCH and 64 samples at SPR. At SCH, all sam-
ples were collected from ponderosa pine with the majority (82%)
coming from old cut stumps. At SPR, all samples except one (Gambel
oak) were collected from ponderosa pine and most (57%) came from
standing dead snags. Only 2–8% of the samples were collected from live
trees across the two sites. For samples from SCH, we crossdated 428
individual ﬁre scars with earliest ﬁre date being 1641 and the latest was
1946. For samples at SPR, we crossdated 565 ﬁre scars with 1621 and
1994 being the earliest and latest ﬁre dates, respectively. For the period
1700–1879, we identiﬁed 90 unique ﬁre dates at SCH and 94 at SPR.
We identiﬁed only one ﬁre date for the period 1880–2017 at SCH and
nine ﬁre dates for this period at SPR (Fig. 2). Mean ﬁre interval for all
crossdated ﬁres (MFIAll) was < 2.0 years for both sites (Table 2).
Weibull median probability interval for all ﬁres (WMPI) was 4% less
than MFIAll at SCH and 6% less than MFIAll at SPR. Mean ﬁre intervals
for more widespread ﬁres that scarred at least 10% (MFI10) and at least
25% (MFI25) of the samples, ranged 2.7–8.4 years across both sites. The
probability of smaller versus larger ﬁre occurrence (MFI25:MFIAll) was
higher for SCH than SPR, and < 5.0 for both sites (Table 2). Estimated
mean ﬁre size based on polygons constructed for ﬁres that scarred three
or more trees at a given site was not signiﬁcantly lower (p = 0.165) for
SCH (61.4 ha) than SPR (75.0 ha) (Fig. 3). Mean point ﬁre interval was
less than 8.5 years at both SCH and SPR (Table 2).
On the Tonto National Forest, we collected 54, 59, and 24 partial
cross-section samples on ELL, HOR, and PRO, respectively. All samples
were collected from ponderosa pine, and were mainly found on cut
stumps (81% ELL and 75% PRO) or snags (46% HOR). A small fraction
of samples was collected from live trees at ELL (5%) and HOR (9%),
whereas no samples were collected from live trees at PRO. We cross-
dated 583 ﬁre scars at ELL, 485 at HOR, and 202 at PRO. The earliest
ﬁre dates identiﬁed on samples were 1624, 1652, and 1660, and the
latest ﬁre dates were 1990, 1900, and 1890 for ELL, HOR, and PRO
sites, respectively. For the period 1700–1879, we found 139 unique ﬁre
dates at ELL, 113 at HOR, and 80 at PRO. We identiﬁed two ﬁre dates
for the period 1880–2017 at ELL, one ﬁre date for this period at HOR,
and one ﬁre date post-1879 at PRO (Fig. 2). Composite ﬁre scar analysis
showed that MFIAll ranged 1.29–2.13 years across the Tonto National
Forest sites (Table 2). Weibull median probability interval ranged
1.25–1.81 years. Mean ﬁre interval for widespread ﬁres (MFI10 and
MFI25) ranged 2.39–15.55 years (Table 2). Probabilities for smaller
ﬁre occurrence versus large ﬁres (MFI25:MFIAll) were 11.18 and 10.16
for ELL and HOR, respectively; however, MFI25:MFIAll for PRO was
3.59. Estimated mean ﬁre sizes were 53.0 ha (CV = 83%) and 57.4 ha
(CV = 76%) for ELL and HOR, respectively, whereas mean ﬁre size for
PRO was 12.8 ha (CV = 102%) (Fig. 3). Mean point ﬁre intervals for
the three sites ranged 10.19–10.87 years.
3.2. Fire synchrony
At individual sites, we identiﬁed 3–11 ﬁre years that occurred
on > 20% of the collected samples (Fig. 4). The most important ﬁre
years (i.e., found on the highest proportion of samples) at SCH, SPR,
ELL, HOR, and PRO were 1765, 1818, 1861, 1879, and 1808, respec-
tively. We identiﬁed 59 sub-regional ﬁre years that were shared by the
two PNF sites (SCH and SPR) (Fig. 4). The most common sub-regional
PNF ﬁre year, which was found on 28% of samples, was 1829. Other
ﬁre years occurring on more than 20% of combined samples at SCH and
SPR were 1765, 1794, 1803, 1827, 1840, 1845, and 1851. For TNF, we
found 56 ﬁres shared sub-regionally across the three sites (ELL, HOR,
and PRO). The most important ﬁre year on TNF sites was 1879, which
was identiﬁed on 23% of the combined samples. One other ﬁre year,
1808, was found on > 20% of the TNF combined samples. Other
important years that occurred on > 15% of TNF samples were 1794,
1817, 1818, 1840, 1851, and 1855. Regionally, we found 22 ﬁre years
shared by all sites (Fig. 4). Two ﬁre years, 1829 and 1849, were found
on > 20% of the combined PNF and TNF samples. Other important
years that occurred on > 15% of all samples were 1794, 1827, and
1851.
3.3. Historical stand conditions
Dendroecological reconstruction of 1879 forest structure at PNF
sites indicated that mean total tree densities at SCH and SPR were 84.7
trees ha−1 and 136.4 trees ha−1, respectively, in 1879 (Fig. 5). Mean
BA in 1879 of all species combined at the two PNF sites was 4.5 m2
ha−1 and 6.7 m2 ha−1 for SCH and SPR, respectively (Fig. 5A).
Quadratic mean diameter (QMD) was 26.1 cm and 24.6 cm on average
for all tree species combined at SCH and SPR, respectively. At SCH, tree
density was almost evenly comprised of ponderosa pine (55% of stems
on average) and tree-form oaks (Gambel oak, Arizona white oak, and
Emory oak) (42% of stems); however, ponderosa pine made up 70% of
stand BA. At SPR, oak was historically dominant both in terms of tree
density (70% of stems) as well as stand BA (59% of total BA) (Fig. 5B).
Ponderosa pine was completely absent on 28% of reconstructed SCH
plots and 27% of SPR plots. No trees of any species were found in re-
constructions of 5% of SCH plots and 4% of SPR plots. Alligator juniper
comprised a minor fraction of tree density and BA at both PNF sites, and
no other species were indicated in our historical reconstructions.
Mean reconstructed tree densities at TNF sites ranged 84–100 trees
ha−1, and BA ranged 5.8–8.4 m2 ha−1 (Fig. 5A and 5B). QMD in 1879
for all species combined at the three PNF sites ranged 24.5–29.0 cm.
Ponderosa pine comprised 27–36% of tree numbers on average, and
density at all sites was dominated by oak species (43–59% of stems).
Ponderosa pine trees were historically absent on 30–37% of sample
plots, and no trees of any species were found on up to 7% of sample
plots across the three TNF sites. Although juniper made up a small
percentage of stem density (3–13%), this species was more important at
TNF sites in terms of BA (26–41% of total BA).
3.4. Historical ponderosa pine landscape patterns
Interpolated patterns of tree densities indicated that ponderosa pine
primarily occurred on PNF and TNF sites in patches < 25 and 26–50
trees ha−1, which comprised 18%-63%, and 24%-69%, respectively, of
site areas (Fig. 6A). Less than 7% of any site was made up patches
76–100 trees ha−1, or > 100 trees ha−1, in 1879. In addition, there
were more low-density patches than high-density patches of ponderosa
pine historically. For example, number of patches < 25 trees ha−1
ranged 1–10, number of patches 26–50 trees ha−1 ranged 1–4, and
number of higher density patches (i.e., classes > 50 trees ha−1)
ranged up to 3 across all sites (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, mean patch sizes
appeared to be larger for low-density patches than higher density pat-
ches, For example, mean ponderosa pine patch size ranged up to 187 ha
D.W. Huﬀman, et al.

in 1879 for density class 26–50 trees ha−1, whereas the largest mean
patch size for any density class above 50 trees ha−1 was just 20 ha
(Fig. 6C).
3.5. Contemporary stand conditions
In 2017, tree densities and BA at both PNF sites were signiﬁcantly
greater (p < 0.001) than reconstructed conditions. Tree density means
were 389 trees ha−1 at SCH and 870 trees ha−1 at SPR, and mean BA
means were 20.6 m2 ha−1 and 35.3 m2 ha−1 at the two sites, respec-
tively (Fig. 5). Tree density changes represented increases of 359% and
538%, and increases in BA were 357% and 427% for SCH and SPR,
respectively. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMA-
NOVA) showed that composition based on species densities was sig-
niﬁcantly diﬀerent (p < 0.001) between 1879 and 2017 at both sites.
The main compositional changes were increases in oak species that
comprised 50% of stems at SCH and 67% of stems at SPR in 2017
(Fig. 5C).
In addition, we observed higher numbers of white ﬁr (Abies con-
color) and Douglas-ﬁr in 2017 at SPR compared with reconstructed
conditions.
Similar to PNF sites, tree densities at the three TNF sites were all

signiﬁcantly (p < 0.001) higher in 2017 than in 1879 (Fig. 5C). At
ELL, HOR, and PRO, mean tree densities ranged 491.7–680.0 trees ha−1
and represented increases of 392–703%. Mean BA was also signiﬁcantly
(p < 0.001) greater in 2017 than 1879 at all three TNF sites, and
ranged 23.1–36.1 m2 ha−1 (Fig. 5D). These values represented BA in-
creases of 285–502%. PERMANOVA indicated that species composition
in terms of tree densities was signiﬁcantly (p < 0.001) diﬀerent at all
three TNF sites between 1879 and 2017 conditions, but, in contrast to
PNF sites, ponderosa pine importance increased from 1879 to 2017 and
was 37–51% of total stem density on average across the three TNF sites
in 2017. Alligator juniper also increased across all TNF sites and made
up 22–38% of stem density in 2017. Oak, however, decreased in im-
portance from 1879 to 2017, and comprised 10–26% of tree density on
average across the three TNF sites in 2017 (Fig. 5C). At HOR, Douglas-
ﬁr, white ﬁr, boxelder (Acer negundo), maple (Acer spp.), and manzanita
combined made up 17% of stems on average in 2017 (Fig. 5C).
4. Discussion
4.1. Fire regimes
Frequent surface ﬁre regimes predominated for at least 200 years
before the 20th century at all ﬁve MHE sites. Results of composite ﬁre
scar analysis showed mean ﬁre intervals ranging 1.3–15.6 years, and
these ﬁndings were supported by analysis of mean point ﬁre intervals,
which ranged 8.1–10.9 years across all sites (Table 2). Frequent ﬁre
regimes in MHE ponderosa pine forests have been described previously
in less intensive studies and unpublished reports (Dieterich and
Hibbert, 1990; Kaib et al., 2000; Sneed et al., 2002). For example,
Dieterich and Hibbert (1990) analyzed seven ﬁre-scarred samples col-
lected from dead material at Battle Flat, an 87-ha ponderosa pine-Ar-
izona white oak site, located about 21–23 km from our PNF sites and
reported a composite MFI of 1.89 years (1700–1874). Similarly, in an

unpublished report, Sneed et al. (2002) analyzed 12 samples collected
from our SCH site and found MFI to be 2.53 years. This mean interval
was slightly longer than our ﬁndings (Table 2), and may reﬂect fewer
samples as well as a long frame of analysis (1615–1996) that included
both early dates with no ﬁre records (pre-1650) and the post-ﬁre-ex-
clusion period (post 1875) (Sneed et al., 2002). On the Tonto National
Forest, Kaib et al. (2000) reported that MFI ranged 1–10 years for
smaller ﬁres (all ﬁre dates) to more widespread ﬁres (25% ﬁlter; ≥8 of
32 ﬁre-scarred trees) at Webber Creek, a ponderosa pine site about
13 km west of ELL and 27 km west of HOR. Similarly, frequent ﬁre
regimes have been documented for ponderosa pine or related forests
forming ecotones with other shrub-dominated communities in the
Southwest U.S. and Mexico (Swetnam et al., 1992; Fulé and Covington,
1997; Grissino-Mayer et al., 2004; Iniguez et al., 2009; O’Connor et al.,
2014; Guiterman et al., 2015). For example, Swetnam et al. (1992)
found MFI to be 3.9 years at a ponderosa pine (and Arizona pine; P.
arizonica var. arizonica) site in Chiricahua National Monument in
southeastern Arizona, where Madrean evergreen woodland was the
primary associated vegetation community, and interior chaparral and
semi-desert grassland communities also occurred on the landscape.
Kaib et al. (1996, 1999) reported similar ﬁre regimes at sites in
southeast Arizona. In ponderosa pine-dominated forests of the Santa
Catalina Mountains, historical MFI ranged 9.0–9.8 years (Iniguez et al.,
2008), and WMPI ranged 3.6–8.4 years for the period 1689–1880 at
three sites in the Huachuca Mountains (Danzer, 1998). Frequent his-
torical ﬁre regimes have also been reported for pine forests in Madrean
evergreen woodlands of the Sierra Madre Occidental, Mexico (Fulé and
Covington, 1997). Few studies have documented noteworthy high-se-
verity ﬁre occurrence in these ecosystems; however, Iniguez et al.
(2009) found evidence of both frequent surface ﬁres as well as a stand-
replacing ﬁre (60 ha) that occurred in 1867 at a dry mixed-con-
ifer–ponderosa pine–oak site adjacent to chaparral and oak-scrub
communities on Rincon Peak in Arizona. Reynolds et al. (2013)
suggested that ponderosa pine dominance in southwestern forests is a
reliable indicator of historical frequent ﬁre regimes, regardless of un-
derstory characteristics. However, this hypothesis has not been sys-
tematically tested. We did not attempt to disentangle the role of Native
American burning on ﬁre frequency at our sites, but it is well under-
stood that indigenous peoples used ﬁre on these landscapes for a variety
of purposes (Allen, 2002). Although Allen (2002) suggests that an
abundance of lightning ignitions, and climate patterns that include
seasonal drought, would be suﬃcient to produce frequent surface ﬁre
regimes in these forests regardless of Native American burning prac-
tices, Liebmann et al. (2016) found that ﬁre frequency in the Jemez
Province of northern New Mexico increased due to reforestation after
decline of Native American populations between 1620 and 1640. Very
little is known about Native American burning and land management
practices of peoples that inhabited lands near our study sites (e.g.,
Yavapai, Apache, etc.).
While frequencies of surface ﬁres at our MHE sites resemble those of
other southwestern ponderosa pine forests, multiple lines of evidence
indicate that historical ﬁres at these sites were relatively small in ex-
tent. For example, comparison of MFI25 with MFIAll indicated that
widespread ﬁres were less probable than smaller ﬁres, particularly at
the ELL and HOR sites on the Tonto National Forest (Table 2). Although
few ﬁre history studies report this ratio (MFI25:MFIAll), our ﬁndings
contrast with those of Fulé et al. (2003), who reported WMPI25:WMPIAll
(note: Weibull median probability interval) ranged 1.4–2.9 for montane
ponderosa pine forests in northern Arizona near Grand Canyon National
Park. At a pinyon-juniper-ponderosa pine ecotone site in northwestern
Arizona, MFI25:MFIAll values ranged 2.12–4.98 (Ireland et al., 2012).
Thus, historical ﬁre sizes at our sites in Arizona’s MHE may have been
particularly small compared with other southwestern ponderosa pine
sites. We found ﬁre size estimates based on spatially explicit delinea-
tions were not commonly greater than 100 ha, and most ﬁres were less
than 75 ha (Fig. 3). Fire synchrony analysis suggested that smaller

contemporary periods.

historical ﬁres at our MHE sites were likely driven by local, bottom-up
factors, although regional climatic drivers were important in de-
termining some ﬁre events. For example, all sites showed ﬁre events in
1851, a year identiﬁed as a regionally important ﬁre year by Swetnam
and Brown (2011), who examined common ﬁre dates from 120 sites in
Arizona and New Mexico. Other dates we identiﬁed that also have been
reported as regionally important were 1765, 1861, and 1879. Inter-
estingly, we did not identify 1748 as a regionally important ﬁre date,
although this has been found by others to be the single most prevalent
ﬁre date in Southwest ﬁre chronologies (Swetnam and Brown, 2011).
This suggests that ﬁres at ponderosa sites with Arizona’s MHE were
strongly inﬂuenced by ﬁne-scale factors such as variability in fuel type
(e.g. shrubs versus grasses) and connectivity (Falk et al. 2007, Ireland
et al. 2012). Major fuel breaks such as rock outcrops, cliﬀs, and canyons
were not present on our sites.
4.2. Structural patterns
Forests of our MHE sites were historically open in structure, and
heterogeneous in ponderosa pine density. Our reconstruction analysis

indicated that these landscapes were made up of low density (< 50
trees ha−1) patches of ponderosa pine with denser patches occurring
infrequently (Fig. 6A). Tree-form oak species were co-dominant in
terms of tree numbers in forest overstories. Historical forest stand
densities at our MHE sites were within the natural range of variation
reported for ponderosa pine systems across the Southwest. For example,
Reynolds et al. (2013) compiled results from dendroecological re-
constructions as well as early survey records and found historical tree
densities in ponderosa pine forests across Arizona and New Mexico
ranged 28.9–306.3 trees ha−1, and BA ranged 5.1–20.5 m2 ha−2, prior
to ﬁre exclusion. Although, Reynolds et al. (2013) considered all plant
associations for ponderosa pine, including ponderosa pine/Gambel oak,
ponderosa pine/Arizona white oak, and ponderosa pine/Emory oak,
few historical data for these associations are available. One exception
came from Woolsey (1911), who described an “average” yellow [pon-
derosa] pine stand (i.e., dominated by mature ponderosa pine trees) on
the Prescott National Forest with 68.4 trees ha−1, somewhat lower than
our estimates for our PNF sites (Fig. 5). It should be noted that, al-
though ponderosa pine dominated in terms of BA, tree-form oaks were
historically more numerous at all of our study sites except SCH. Earlier
studies have surmised that frequent ﬁres in ponderosa pine forests of
MHE were likely supported primarily by ﬁne fuels, and shrub abun-
dance was assumed to be low (Kaib et al., 2000), but there have been no
prior dendroecological reconstruction of stand conditions. Thus, our
study expands understanding of the natural range of variation for
ponderosa pine forests in the Southwest and provides new information
concerning fringe forests occupying ecotones with chaparral and ever-
green woodlands.
Although we could not reconstruct historical understory composi-
tion, we hypothesize that shrubs were present at our sites historically,
while grasses and ﬁne fuels that are more favorable to spread of surface
ﬁre were more abundant. We base this hypothesis on our understanding
of shrub responses to ﬁre as described in the relevant literature. For
example, following an initial burn, recovering interior chaparral shows
reduced ﬂammability and may not reburn for 10–20 years (Cable, 1975;
Dieterich and Hibbert, 1990). Further, natural ﬁre rotations of interior
chaparral in Arizona are thought to be about 30–40 years (Sneed et al.,
2002), and coastal chaparral burns with high severity at intervals of
50–100 years (Conard and Weise, 1998). Juvenile tissues of sprouting
chaparral shrubs tend to be ﬁre resistant, but as they age stems become
rich in epicuticular waxes and support low fuel moistures, character-
istics which can accelerate wildﬁre intensity, severity, and spread in
older stands (Rothermel and Philpot, 1973; Nagel and Taylor, 2005;
Keeley, 2006). In addition, frequent surface ﬁres may over time reduce
shrub abundance by depleting resources and bud banks required for
sprouting and persistence, and favor ﬁne fuels such as grasses and other
herbaceous plants. This process was suggested by Fulé and Covington
(1998), who found lower resprouting hardwood abundance in pine-oak
forests where ﬁres continued to burn with expected frequency com-
pared with forests where ﬁre had been excluded for about 50 years in
the Sierra Madre Occidental, Mexico. Indeed, similar landscapes of the
Sierra Nevada range in California show distinct ﬁre regimes and related
feedback mechanisms of chaparral and mixed conifer forests that ap-
pear to maintain stable, distinct systems (Lauvaux et al., 2016).
Although stand-replacing ﬁre occurrence is diﬃcult to reconstruct
using our methods, we expected historical high-severity ﬁre to be evi-
denced by large ﬁre-scar-free areas on the landscapes, plots showing no
ponderosa pine in dendroecological reconstructions (i.e., only younger
trees (post-1879) present in 2017), and/or charred tree remnants ob-
served in our ﬁeld plot measurements. However, in our study, these
lines of evidence did not clearly converge and we cannot conclude that
stand-replacing ﬁre behavior was important historically. For example,
we found ﬁre scars indicative of repeated surface ﬁre abundant and
distributed evenly across all study sites (Fig. 1), but we also found
ponderosa pine was absent in reconstructions of 27–37% of sample
plots. Although only a small fraction (up to 7%) of plots was completely
absent of trees, it is plausible that tree-form oaks may have originated
from sprouting after severe ﬁre on plots where ponderosa pine was
absent. Charred tree structures were noted during ﬁeld plot sampling
but we found no extensive patches indicating large stand-replacing ﬁre.
4.3. Contemporary conditions
Ecological conditions in contemporary ponderosa pine forests of
Arizona’s MHE are substantially diﬀerent from those prior to ﬁre re-
gime disruption. Overall, tree density increases found in our study, and
recruitment of shade-tolerant and ﬁre-intolerant species, parallel those
widely reported for frequent-ﬁre forests across the western US
(Covington et al., 1994; Reynolds et al., 2013; Strahan et al., 2016;
Rodman et al., 2017; Hessburg et al., 2019). Major landscape changes
due to historical livestock grazing, mining, and timber harvesting have
been described for central Arizona landscapes. For example, Prescott,
Arizona was formally established as the Territorial Capital in 1864, and
forests in the area as well as other landscapes of the MHE experienced
intensive livestock grazing and timber harvesting (Croxen, 1926;
Dieterich and Hibbert, 1990). Leopold (1924) described early landscape
changes in central Arizona, and observed widespread soil erosion,
cessation of spreading surface ﬁres, and increases in “brush” (chaparral)
cover and tree reproduction. Similarly, Croxen (1926), gathered anec-
dotes from early settlers within the Tonto National Forest, and re-
counted stories of general decreases in grasses within pine forests and
increases of chaparral throughout these landscapes. In relatively cooler
montane ponderosa pine forests, intensive grazing associated with
Euro-American settlement of northern Arizona reduced herbaceous fuel
layers and limited spread of natural surface ﬁres (Covington and Moore,
1994; Covington, 2003). Cessation of the frequent ﬁre regime along
with active ﬁre suppression by forest managers later in the 20th century
resulted in establishment of substantial cohorts of tree regeneration
(Savage et al., 1996; Mast et al., 1999; Sánchez Meador et al., 2009;
Schneider et al., 2016). Increases in forest density and buildup in
woody surface fuels and forest ﬂoor layers led to radical changes in ﬁre
behavior as well as ecosystem function in montane forests (Moore et al.,
1999). In addition to ﬁre exclusion and reduction of grass competition,
shrub proliferation in MHE forests was also likely aided by early timber
harvests for mining, fuel, and forage (Croxen, 1926). For example, use
of pine, oak, and juniper for mining activities on the Prescott National
Forest resulted in some areas being mostly cutover by 1880 (Dieterich
and Hibbert, 1990). Reduction in forest cover and disturbance asso-
ciated with harvesting would be expected to stimulate shrub re-
generation, particularly that of sprouting species. Fire exclusion be-
ginning around 1879 likely allowed shrub survival and facilitated
development of long-term shrub persistence mechanisms.
5. Management implications
Ecological changes related to disruption of historical ﬁre regimes
have increased susceptibility of ponderosa pine forests in Arizona’s
MHE to rapid shifts in structure and composition that may come about
with climate change and high-intensity wildﬁre (Parks et al., 2019).
Overall, forests of the Southwest have recently experienced increases in
high-severity ﬁre due to climate warming, drought, and land use factors
(O’Connor et al., 2014; Singleton et al., 2019). Increases in tree density,
reduction of grasses in understory communities, and development of
persistent shrub layers all increase potential for stand replacing ﬁres.
Increasing warming and drought conditions following high-severity ﬁre
can result in limited tree regeneration and conversion to persistent
shrubﬁelds (Barton, 1999, 2002; Savage and Mast, 2005; Savage et al.,
2013; Ouzts et al., 2015; Guiterman et al., 2018). Susceptibility to type
conversion is ampliﬁed for ponderosa pine forests occurring at their
environmental limits within Arizona’s MHE, where conifer regeneration
after wildﬁre can be negligible (Ouzts et al., 2015).
Our ﬁndings suggest that MHE forests were resilient to climate

Forest Ecology and Management 465 (2020) 118087
10

ﬂuctuations and ﬁre for at least 200 years prior to Euro-American set-
tlement. These historical conditions help managers understand pro-
cesses that contributed to ecological resilience, which in turn can be
used to frame strategies for management with climate change (Gauthier
et al., 1996; Bergeron et al., 2004). Prescriptions aimed at restoring
resilience, treating hazardous fuels, and reducing crown ﬁre potential
in these systems will follow basic principles described for frequent ﬁre
forests (Agee and Skinner, 2005). However, meeting fuel reduction
goals is certain to be challenging for land managers due to vigorous
sprouting responses of shrubs to tree thinning, prescribed burning, or
other management activities such as mastication focused on shrub
control (Pond and Cable, 1960; Kane et al., 2010; Brennan and Keeley,
2015). In addition, our study indicated that tree-form oak species and
likely other hardwoods were important components of these ecosystems
prior to ﬁre regime disruption. Thus, managers will be required to
balance attention to historical reference conditions, conservation of
biological diversity, and needs for fuels management. Restoration
treatments should be focused on reducing overstory density while
maintaining ponderosa pine seed trees and tree-form oaks such as Ar-
izona white oak, Emory oak, and Gambel oak. Multiple entries with
prescribed ﬁre or mastication to reduce sprouting understory shrubs
and encourage establishment and growth of herbaceous species, lim-
iting livestock grazing, and perhaps seeding with native grasses may all
lower crown ﬁre potential and help restore ecosystem function. In some
cases, maintaining forest cover while treating understories may help
dampen shrub sprouting responses. Drought tolerant shrubs and other
sprouting woody species are likely to be favored with a rapidly
warming and drier climate. Because of heightened risk of conversion
due to climate-driven tree mortality as well as wildﬁre, fringe forests
such as those within Arizona’s MHE should be considered high priority
for conservation.
