Habitat Associations of the Sagebrush
Lizard (Sceloporus graciosus): Potential
Responses of an Ectotherm to Ponderosa
Pine Forest Restoration Treatments

Abstract—Little is known about the response of ectotherms to
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) restoration treatments. The
ambient body temperature of an ectotherm affects its physiology,
development, and behavior. Microhabitat availability and heteroge-
neity are critical factors in determining which thermoregulation
choices are available to a terrestrial ectotherm (Stevenson 1985).
Forest restoration treatments (for example, thinning and burning)
will alter herpetofauna microhabitats by decreasing tree canopy
cover and allowing more sunlight penetration to the forest floor.
This change could, depending on the species, have positive or
negative effects on the populations of the area. We sampled micro-
habitat use by Sceloporus graciosus (sagebrush lizards) in northern
Arizona at Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument using
standard “pitfall-array” sampling methodology. Univariate analy-
ses were used to relate lizard abundance to ponderosa pine tree
density, percent soil cover, percent rock cover, litter depth, and
insect density. In a multivariate analysis, ponderosa pine density
(negatively correlated) and bare soil cover (positively correlated)
were the best predictors of lizard abundance. Restoration treat-
ments will increase small-scale heterogeneity within S. graciosus
territories by increasing accessibility into and out of sunlight. Based
on the thermoregulatory demands of this species, these changes
should benefit S. graciosus. However, other possible indirect effects
of restoration treatments such as increases in predation on lizards
(due to greater visibility), as well as changes in food availability,
could negatively impact lizard populations. Future research should
focus on pre- and postrestoration treatment monitoring
of herpetofauna, and on the direct effects of fire on herpetofauna
populations within restoration sites.
Introduction ____________________
Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest restoration is an
experimental management practice currently being applied
in the Southwest. This practice varies depending on the
management objectives, but generally consists of some com-
bination of forest thinning and prescribed burning. Covington
and others (1997) has shown increases in: (1) forest floor
sunlight penetration, and (2) herbaceous productivity
(grasses, forbs, and shrubs) among restoration-treated pon-
derosa pine stands. These changes are expected to benefit
the fauna of the area, although the direct effects of forest
thinning and prescribed fire are poorly represented in scien-
tific literature.
Data from Germaine (1999), in an ongoing restoration
study at Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument,
suggest that lizards of the Sceloporus genus (Sceloporus
graciosus and Sceloporus undulatus) are more abundant in
areas with lower ponderosa pine density. This suggests that
restoration treatments could result in higher densities of
these Sceloporus lizards. However, studies of herpetofauna
responses to ponderosa pine restoration before and after
treatment do not currently exist.
The direct effects of fire on herpetofauna populations are
also poorly understood. Cunningham and others (2000)
pitfall-trapped lizards in burned and unburned chaparral
and Madrean evergreen forests the year following a high-
intensity wildfire, and captured primarily immature liz-
ards. Subsequent trapping over the following two seasons
resulted in higher species richness, diversity, and capture
rates, indicating rapid settlement of the burned area by
adjacent residents. Lizard genera represented in this study
included Sceloporus undulatus and numerous Cnemidoph-
orus species.
A few studies have shown that certain lizard species of
fire-dependent ecosystems, such as long-leaf pine (Mushinsky
1985), chaparral (Lillywhite 1977a,b), and sandpine scrub
(Greenberg 1993), increase in diversity or density following
fire. Both Mushinsky (1985) and Greenberg (1993) found
that some lizards of the genus Eumeces remained more
abundant in control areas (unburned and unharvested for at
least 20 years in both cases). It is apparent that different
species have different thermoregulatory demands and
should be addressed on a species-specific basis.
In this study we identified current forest condition
microhabitat characteristics of the sagebrush lizard (Sce-
loporus graciosus) in a Southwestern ponderosa pine forest.

Microhabitat preferences for this species were determined,
based on habitat variation within the study area. Potential
responses of S. graciosus to restoration treatments were
determined by extrapolating habitat relationships from cur-
rent condition forests to conditions expected in treated forest
areas. In the future, these data will be further applied to a
long-term study measuring the posttreatment effects of
restoration on the age structure, composition, and abun-
dance of this lizard population.
Methods _______________________
The study site was in northern Arizona at Grand Canyon-
Parashant National Monument. The elevation ranges from
approximately 2,080 m to 2,290 m, and the area is comprised
primarily of ponderosa pine forest, with abundant sage-
brush meadows. During May and June of 1999, prerestoration
treatment microhabitat data were collected from 56 pitfall
arrays. Arrays consisted of four 5-gallon buckets buried in a
“peace-sign” configuration (Jones 1986). Each array in-
cluded three wire mesh drift fences radiating out 7 m from
the center bucket, connected to the other three buckets (fig. 1).
Arrays were opened and checked every third day, for a total
of 168 trap days. At each array, percent soil cover, percent
rock cover, litter depth, and insect density were sampled
within a 1 m circular radius surrounding each bucket. Insect
density was sampled along four 1 m transects per bucket.
The data were collected at timed intervals of 10 seconds per
transect, scanning the entire transect length. All insects
within the top 2.54 cm of litter were tallied during sampling.
Germaine (1999) gathered percent coniferous canopy clo-
sure and ponderosa pine density at each array. Coniferous
canopy closure was measured at four transects as 40 “hits”
or “misses”, out to a 25 m radius, originating from the center
of each array. Ponderosa pine stem density was measured in
a 6 m belt running N-S and E-W across each array.
Values for each microhabitat variable collected were aver-
aged for each array. We used stepwise linear regression
analyses, with entry and exit levels of alpha = 0.15, to
identify those habitat variables that, in combination, were
associated with lizard abundance (Sokal and Rohlf 1981;
SAS Institute Inc. 1985). Spearman correlations were used
to determine univariate relationships between lizard abun-
dance and microhabitat variables that were selected in
multivariate models (SAS Institute Inc. 1985). Those micro-
habitat variables that were not normally distributed, or
with unequal variance, were transformed by taking the
square root of each variable (Sabin and Stafford 1990).
We calculated the Mallow’s Cp statistic to select the best
fitting model. This statistic is a measure of total squared
error for each model and should be approximately equal to
the number of parameters (including the intercept) in the
model to choose a parsimonious model (Younger 1979:
493–495).
Results ________________________
Three species of lizards were captured during the trapping
period. Captures consisted of Sceloporus graciosus (n = 81),
Eumeces skiltonianus (n = 4), and Sceloporus undulatus
(n = 1). S. graciosus abundance ranged from 0 to 9 (± 2.06)
captures per array. Ponderosa pine density ranged from 0 to
1,968 (± 466.84) trees per hectare. Bare soil cover ranged
from 0 to 91.25 (± 18.84) percent per array. Results from the
stepwise linear regression analyses are presented for
Sceloporus graciosus (table 1). The best model for explaining
the variation in S. graciosus abundance contained the vari-
ables of ponderosa pine density (trees/ha) and percent bare
soil cover:
S. graciosus abundance = 1.78 – 0.06
(ponderosa pine density) + 0.24 (percent bare soil cover)
C(p) = 2.16
This model explained 34 percent of the variance. Ponderosa
pine density was negatively correlated with S. graciosus
abundance (fig. 2). S. graciosus abundance peaked in areas
that contained 50–200 ponderosa pine trees/ha. Bare soil
cover was positively correlated with lizard abundance (fig. 3).

Discussion _____________________
This study indicates the need for small-scale heterogene-
ity within Sceloporus graciosus territories. Contiguous, ho-
mogeneous, fire-suppressed ponderosa pine forests inhibit
adequate sunlight penetration to the forest floor. This can
reduce sunlight accessibility for ectothermic animals with
small home ranges, such as most lizards and snakes, which
rely upon solar heat for metabolic processes and mobility.
Previous research has established that current South-
western ponderosa pine forests contain much higher densi-
ties of ponderosa pine than were present in these same
forests before Euro-American settlement (Cooper 1960;
Covington and Moore 1994b). This suggests that sunlight
penetration to the forest floor has also decreased during this
period due to large increases in ponderosa pine densities.
Covington and others (1997) have shown that forest restora-
tion treatments, through reduction in forest tree density and
prescribed fire, do in fact open up the canopy and create a
more open, parklike landscape. Restoration, carried out
through these means, will enhance the thermoregulation
options available to S. graciosus by lowering litter accumu-
lations (which will provide easier access to burrows), and
ultimately increasing accessibility into and out of sunlight.
Ponderosa pine forest restoration treatments, implemented
on an adaptive management basis, have potential to increase
the habitat suitability of some terrestrial ectotherms by
increasing small-scale heterogeneity. Thinning dense stands
of ponderosa pine will not only allow more sunlight penetra-
tion, but will also create a more patchy distribution of
sunlight at the ground layer level. Results of this study
suggest that optimal S. graciosus habitat for thermoregula-
tion would entail leaving between 50–400 trees/ha after
forest thinning treatments.
It is important to recognize the many other factors that
could change as a result of restoration treatments, which
may inadvertently affect S. graciosus. Lawrence (1966)
found increases in predatory birds and mammals after a
chaparral fire in the Sierra Nevada foothills. Increases in
predation and competition, as well as changes in food avail-
ability, may also play significant roles in the postrestoration
habitat of terrestrial ectotherms.
We were able to explain one-third of the variance in
sagebrush lizard abundance. Possible explanations for the
lack of a model that explains a considerable amount of the
variance can be attributed to several factors: (1) It is possible
that the collective contribution of several microhabitat vari-
ables determines the success of the animal. (2) There is a
high degree of difficulty associated with accurately sam-
pling small-scale heterogeneity within the small territories
of Sceloporus lizards. (3) The sample size could have been too
small. (4) The length of the sampling period could have been
too short. (5) Thorough seasonal population representation
of an animal that spends two-thirds of its life below ground
is questionable.
Suggestions for future research include the need for de-
tailed behavioral studies that capture common behavior
patterns of these lizards. Other recommendations include
the need to obtain larger sample sizes, as well as long-term
(>5 years) studies. Studies on the direct effects of fire on
lizard fitness are essential to correctly understand which
scale and intensity of prescribed fires to use in restoration
treatments.
Although no studies exist that measure lizard responses
directly to forest restoration before and after treatment, we
hope that this study will encourage additional research. In
those ecosystems where restoration treatments increase
sunlight availability to the forest floor, terrestrial ecto-
therms can be significant indicators of thermal change. Data
from this and related studies need to be incorporated into
future restoration treatment prescriptions to ensure that
habitat needs are met for all native wildlife species during
forest restoration activities.
