the force generated by assembly of trans-SNARE
complexes onto the two fusing membranes (Fig. 4),
consistent with biochemical data (23). We postu-
late that after complexin binds to assembling
SNARE complexes, its N-terminal sequence ac-
tivates and clamps the force generated by SNARE-
complex assembly. The N terminus of complexin
might perform its activator function by pulling
the complex closer to the membrane, possibly
by binding to phospholipids, whereas the acces-
sory N-terminal a-helix might clamp the com-
plex by inserting into the space between the
v- and t-SNAREs or even substituting for one
of the SNAREs in the C-terminal segment of the
trans-SNARE complex (24). Once anchored on
the SNARE complex, the 40 N-terminal residues
of complexin both activate and clamp SNARE
complexes to control fast Ca2+-triggered neuro-
transmitter release in a process that is conserved
in all animals. Viewed in the broader picture,
complexin and synaptotagmin therefore operate
as interdependent clamp-activators of SNARE-
dependent fusion, with synaptotagmin exploiting
the activator effect of complexin and reversing its
clamping function (11, 21, 22). In this molecular
pas-de-deux, the functions of both proteins are
intimately linked: Their phenotypes are identical
both as activators and as clamps, and one does
not operate without the other.

Widespread Increase of Tree Mortality
Rates in the Western United States

Persistent changes in tree mortality rates can alter forest structure, composition, and ecosystem
services such as carbon sequestration. Our analyses of longitudinal data from unmanaged old
forests in the western United States showed that background (noncatastrophic) mortality rates have
increased rapidly in recent decades, with doubling periods ranging from 17 to 29 years among
regions. Increases were also pervasive across elevations, tree sizes, dominant genera, and past fire
histories. Forest density and basal area declined slightly, which suggests that increasing mortality
was not caused by endogenous increases in competition. Because mortality increased in small
trees, the overall increase in mortality rates cannot be attributed solely to aging of large trees.
Regional warming and consequent increases in water deficits are likely contributors to the
increases in tree mortality rates.
A
s key regulators of global hydrologic and
carbon cycles, forests are capable of con-
tributing substantial feedbacks to global
changes (1). Such feedbacks may already be un-
der way; for example, forest carbon storage may
be responding to environmentally driven changes
in global patterns of tree growth and forest
productivity (2–4). Recent warming has been
implicated as contributing to episodes of forest
dieback (pulses of greatly elevated tree mortali-
ty), such as those mediated by bark beetle out-
breaks in western North America (5, 6). Yet little
effort has gone toward determining whether en-
vironmental changes are contributing to chronic,
long-term changes in tree demographic rates (mor-
tality and recruitment). Changes in demographic
rates, when compounded over time, can alter for-
est structure, composition, and function (7). For
example, a persistent doubling of background
mortality rate (such as from 1 to 2% year−1) ul-
timately would cause a >50% reduction in aver-
age tree age in a forest, and hence a potential
reduction in average tree size. Additionally,
changing demographic rates could indicate
forests approaching thresholds for abrupt die-
back. Yet spatially extensive analyses of long-
term changes in tree demographic rates have
been limited to tropical forests, where mortality
and recruitment rates both have increased over
the past several decades, perhaps in response to
rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations, nutrient
deposition, or other environmental changes (2, 8).
Comparably extensive analyses have not been
conducted in temperate forests.
We sought to determine whether systematic
changes in tree demographic rates have occurred
recently in coniferous forests of the western
United States, and if so, to identify possible
causes of those changes. Although the western
United States has witnessed recent episodes of
forest dieback related to bark beetle outbreaks or
combinations of drought and outbreaks (5, 6),
most forested land continues to support seem-
ingly healthy forests that have not died back (9).
To minimize transient dynamics associated with
stand development and succession, we limited
our analyses to data from repeated censuses in
undisturbed forest stands more than 200 years old
(10). Old forests contain trees of all ages and
sizes (11, 12), and any large, persistent changes in
demographic rates over a short period (such as a
few decades) are likely to be consequences of
exogenous environmental changes (2, 13). In
contrast, in young forests rapid demographic
changes can sometimes result largely from
endogenous processes (such as self-thinning
during stand development) (14), potentially
obscuring environmentally driven changes.

Seventy-six long-term forest plots from three
broad regions, spanning 14° of latitude and 18°
of longitude and at elevations of 130 to 3353 m
(Fig. 1 and table S1), met our criteria for analysis
(10). Plots ranged from 0.25 to 15.75 ha (x =
1.33 ha), collectively containing 58,736 living
trees over the study period, of which 11,095 died.
The plots were originally established for diverse
purposes—such as to investigate different stages
of forest development, document dynamics of
certain forest types, explore forest dynamics
along environmental gradients, or act as controls
for silvicultural experiments [see references in
(10)]—that are unlikely to produce bias relative
to our study’s goals. We analyzed data from 1955
and later; only five plots from one region had
earlier censuses. For individual plots, the initial
census year analyzed ranged from 1955 to 1994
( x = 1981); the final census year ranged from
1998 to 2007 (x = 2004). Plots were censused
three to seven times ( x = 4.8). Our generally
conservative estimates of forest ages at the time
of initial censuses averaged ~450 years, with some
plots exceeding 1000 years.
We used generalized nonlinear models to re-
gress demographic rates on year; generalized non-
linear mixed models (GNMMs) were used when
severalplotswereanalyzedcollectively(10).Demo-
graphic rates were estimated by annual compound-
ing over the census interval length. All parameters
were estimated by maximum likelihood.
Our models showed that mortality rates
increased in 87% of plots (Fig. 1) (P < 0.0001,
two-tailed binomial test). Mortality rate increased
significantly for all plots combined and in each of
the three regions (Fig. 2 and Table 1), with es-
timated doubling periods ranging from 17 years
(Pacific Northwest) to 29 years (interior). Mor-
tality rates also increased at low, middle, and high
elevations (<1000 m, 1000 to 2000 m, and
>2000 m, respectively) and for small, medium,
and large trees (stem diameter <15 cm, 15 to
40 cm, and >40 cm, respectively) (Fig. 2 and
Table 1). The three most abundant tree genera in
our plots (comprising 77% of trees) are dominated
by different life history traits (Tsuga, late succes-
sional; Pinus, generally shade-intolerant; Abies,
generally shade-tolerant); all three showed in-
creasing mortality rates (Fig. 2 and Table 1). An
introduced fungal pathogen, Cronartium ribicola,
is known to contribute to increasing mortality
rates in five-needled species of Pinus (15). When
all five-needled Pinus were removed from analy-
sis, mortality rates among the remaining Pinus
(those immune to the pathogen) still increased
[a = 0.027, P = 0.0011, GNMM, n = 22, where a
is the estimated annual fractional change in
mortality rate; see (10)]. Finally, trees belonging
to the remaining 16 genera (23% of all trees)
collectively showed increasing mortality rates
(Fig. 2 and Table 1).
In contrast to mortality rates, recruitment rates
increased in only 52% of plots—a proportion
indistinguishable from random (P = 0.80, two-
tailed binomial test). There was no detectable
trend in recruitment for all plots combined, nor
when regions were analyzed separately (P ≥0.20,
GNMM; table S2).
We examined three classes of possible causes
of the increasing tree mortality rates: methodo-
logical artifacts, endogenous processes, and ex-
ogenous processes. We tested for and ruled out
several obvious potential sources of methodolog-
ical artifacts (10). Among endogenous processes,
perhaps the best-known cause of increasing tree
mortality rates is increasing competition resulting
from increasing forest density and basal area
(11, 12). Such changes might especially be ex-
pected in the subset of old forests in the western
United States that formerly experienced frequent
surface fires; in these forests, fire exclusion (gen-
erally spanning the last century) often resulted in
an initial increase in forest density and basal area
(16, 17). However, consistent with our observa-
tions of increasing mortality without compensat-
ing increases in recruitment, forest density and
basal area declined slightly during the study period

[P ≤0.028, linear mixed model (LMM); fig. S1].
Thus, forest structural changes are consistent with
a slight decline rather than an increase in potential
for competition over the study period, which sug-
gests that increasing mortality rates cannot be
attributed to changes in forest structure.
Fire exclusion conceivably could affect mor-
tality rates through mechanisms unrelated to
forest structural changes, such as allowing in-
creases in insects or pathogens that were formerly
controlled by fire. We therefore classified plots
by their pre–fire exclusion fire return intervals:
short, intermediate, and long (<25 years, 25 to
250 years, and >250 years, respectively) (table
S1). If fire exclusion ultimately were responsible
for increasing tree mortality rates, we would
expect to see increases in plots with historically
short fire return intervals (which have experi-
enced substantial recent changes in fire regime)
and little or no change in mortality rates in plots
with historically long return intervals (which
have experienced little or no change in fire re-
gime). However, mortality rates showed compa-
rable increases in each of the three classes (Fig. 2
and Table 1); we therefore conclude that fire
exclusion is an unlikely cause of the observed
increases in mortality rates.
Mortality rates could increase if a cohort of
old trees begins to die and fall, crushing smaller
trees at an increasing rate [a mechanism related to
the proposed “majestic forest” effect; see refer-
ences in (8)]. If such a mechanism were respon-
sible for the observed increase in tree mortality
rates, we would expect to see no parallel increase
in mortality rates of small trees that died standing
(i.e., trees <15 cm in diameter that died of causes
other than being crushed by falling trees from an
aging cohort), because such deaths are
independent of deaths in an aging cohort.
However, the mortality rate of small trees that
died standing increased rapidly in recent decades,
doubling in ~16 years (P < 0.0001, GNMM;
table S3); thus, other mechanisms must be acting.
Finally, mortality rates increased in all major
genera rather than being limited to those domi-
nated by a particular life history trait (such as
shade intolerance), which suggests that succes-
sional dynamics are unlikely to be primary driv-
ers of increasing mortality rates.
We conclude that endogenous processes are
unlikely to be major contributors to the observed
rapid, synchronous doubling of mortality rates in
our heterogeneous sample of old forests at a sub-
continental scale. Moreover, the available evi-
dence is inconsistent with major roles for two
possible exogenous causes: forest fragmentation
and air pollution (10).
We suggest that regional warming may be the
dominant contributor to the increases in tree
mortality rates. From the 1970s to 2006 (the
period including the bulk of our data; table S1),
the mean annual temperature of the western
United States increased at a rate of 0.3° to 0.4°C
decade−1, even approaching 0.5°C decade−1 at
the higher elevations typically occupied by forests
(18). This regional warming has contributed to
widespread hydrologic changes, such as declin-
ing fraction of precipitation falling as snow (19),
declining snowpack water content (20), earlier
spring snowmelt and runoff (21), and a conse-
quent lengthening of the summer drought (22).
Specific to our study sites, mean annual precip-
itation showed no directional trend over the study
period (P = 0.62, LMM), whereas both mean
annual temperature and climatic water deficit
(annual evaporative demand that exceeds avail-
able water) increased significantly (P < 0.0001,
LMM) (10). Furthermore, temperature and water
deficit were positively correlated with tree
mortality rates (P ≤0.0066, GNMM; table S4).
Warming could contribute to increasing mor-
tality rates by (i) increasing water deficits and thus
drought stress on trees, with possible direct and
indirect contributions to tree mortality (13, 23);
(ii) enhancing the growth and reproduction of
insects and pathogens that attack trees (6); or (iii)
both. A contribution from warming is consistent
with both the apparent role of warming in epi-
sodes of recent forest dieback in western North
America (5, 6) and the positive correlation be-
tween short-term fluctuations in background mor-
tality rates and climatic water deficits observed in
California and Colorado (13, 24).
The rapid and pervasive increases in tree mor-
tality rates in old forests of the western United
States are notable for several reasons. First, increas-
ing mortality rates could presage substantial
changes in forest structure, composition, and func-
tion (7, 25), and in some cases could be sympto-
matic of forests that are stressed and vulnerable to
abrupt dieback (5). Indeed, since their most recent
censuses, several of our plots in the interior region
experienced greatly accelerated mortality due to
bark beetle outbreaks, and in some cases nearly
complete mortality of large trees (10). Second, the
increasing mortality rates demonstrate that on-
going, subcontinental-scale changes in tree demo-
graphic rates are not limited to the tropics (8).
Third, some of the changes in the western United
States contrast sharply with those in the tropics,
where increasing mortality rates have been par-
alleled by increasing recruitment rates and basal
area (2, 8). In the western United States, recruit-
ment rates have not changed while forest density
and basal area have declined slightly. Fourth, our
results are inconsistent with a major role for en-
dogenous causes of increasing mortality rates.
Instead, the evidence is consistent with contribu-
tions from exogenous causes, with regional warm-
ing and consequent drought stress being the most
likely drivers.

The Sphingolipid Transporter
Spns2 Functions in Migration of
Zebrafish Myocardial Precursors

Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a secreted lipid mediator that functions in vascular development;
however, it remains unclear how S1P secretion is regulated during embryogenesis. We identified a
zebrafish mutant, ko157, that displays cardia bifida (two hearts) resembling that in the S1P receptor-2
mutant. A migration defect of myocardial precursors in the ko157 mutant is due to a mutation in a
multipass transmembrane protein, Spns2, and can be rescued by S1P injection. We show that the
export of S1P from cells requires Spns2. spns2 is expressed in the extraembryonic tissue yolk
syncytial layer (YSL), and the introduction of spns2 mRNA in the YSL restored the cardiac defect
in the ko157 mutant. Thus, Spns2 in the YSL functions as a S1P transporter in S1P secretion,
thereby regulating myocardial precursor migration.

uring the late stages of zebrafish seg-
mentation characterized by the formation
of the somites, the myocardial precursors
from both sides of the anterior lateral plate meso-
derm migrate toward the midline to form the
heart tube (1, 2). Forward genetic analysis in
zebrafish has helped to uncover genes involved
in vertebrate heart formation (3). To identify ad-
ditional regulators of heart development, we per-
formed N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis
screening for mutations specifically affecting
cardiac morphogenesis. We isolated a recessive
ko157 mutant that displayed two hearts, a condi-
tion known as cardia bifida with swollen peri-
cardial sacs (Fig. 1, A, B, E, and F). The expression
of myocardial markers [nkx2.5 and cardiac myosin
light chain 2 (cmlc2)] and chamber-specific
markers [atrial myosin heavy chain (amhc) and
ventricular myosin heavy chain (vmhc)] was de-
tected in two separated domains (Fig. 1, C and G,
and fig. S2); this finding suggests that the myo-
cardial precursors failed to migrate but differen-
tiated into two chambers at the bilateral positions.
The migration of several mesodermal deriv-
atives examined by the expression pattern of a
vascular marker ( fli1), an erythroid marker
(gata1), a pronephric marker (pax2), and a lateral
plate mesoderm marker (hand2) was not im-
paired in ko157 mutants (figs. S2 and S3), which
suggests that the migration of myocardial pre-
cursors is dominantly affected. Besides cardia
bifida, there were abnormal blisters at the tip of
the tail in the mutant (Fig. 1, D and H). These two
characteristic phenotypes (cardia bifida and tail
blisters) in the ko157 mutant were similar to
those in the miles apart (mil)/S1P receptor-2
(S1P2) mutant (4). Sphingosine-1-phosphate
(S1P) is a lipid mediator involved in cell growth,
death, migration, and differentiation (5–8). Both
cardia bifida and tail blisters were observed in
embryos injected with an antisense morpholino
for mil/S1P2 (mil MO; 15 ng) (9) (fig. S4 and
table S1), suggesting a genetic interaction be-
tween ko157 and mil/S1P2.
