ABSTRACT: We collected residual stand-damage data from a mixed conifer stand in northern Idaho that
had been commercially thinned with a cut-to-length harvesting system. The stand composition after
harvesting was 76% grand fir (Abies grandis); 14% Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca); 5%
western redcedar (Thuja plicata); and 5% lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), western white pine (Pinus
monticola), and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). For all crop trees, damage to the bole, roots, and crown
was assessed using systematic sampling with a random start and fixed area plots. Wounding occurred on
37.4% of the remaining trees, but the severity of wounding varied significantly by species (P  0.05).
Eighty-four percent of wounding for all species combined was considered as small size (194 cm2). The
greatest average amount of damage to a bole occurred along the first 2 m up from the ground (67.2%) and
also within 4 m of the forwarder centerline (67.7%). Gouges were present on 41% of all scars. Tree location
to forwarder trail appears to have a significant effect on the number and height of scars on a tree (P 
0.05). We estimated that throughout a 20-year period, volume losses for grand fir because of decay would
be 2.57% compared to 1.31% in an undamaged stand of similar composition. West. J. Appl. For. 21(3):
142–148.
Key Words: Wounding damage, grand fir, decay, partial harvest, volume losses.
Because of fire suppression and the selective logging
methods practiced throughout the last 100 years, many
stands in the Inland Northwest are overstocked and no
longer contain a historic species composition (Filip et al.
1990). Shade-tolerant grand fir (Abies grandis) and Dou-
glas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) have replaced
the previously dominant, shade-intolerant species, i.e., pon-
derosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), lodgepole pine (Pinus con-
torta), and western white pine (P. monticola). The United
States Forest Service is commercially thinning many such
overstocked stands and allowing desirable species to regrow
to re-establish a more traditional structure. Regeneration
harvesting (removal of the remaining trees) usually occurs
20 years after commercial thinning. However, to ensure
that the maximum amount of merchantable volume can be
removed in that second harvest, residual damage must be
minimized during the earlier thinning operation.
Damage to the trees left behind after thinning (i.e., re-
sidual stand damage) is a consequence of any harvesting
activity and may include root abrasion and breakage, bole
wounds, and broken branches and crowns. The most com-
mon injury to the bole is scarring (i.e., bark removal down
to or into the cambium layer; Ostrofsky et al. 1986, Han and
Kellogg 2000, Youngblood 2000). Scars may also be
gouged, thereby extending the physical damage into the
wood. If damage is severe enough, the tree may die. Nor-
mally, however, these trees tend to live, although this scar-
ring allows decay-causing fungi (Hymenomycetes spp.) to
infect, potentially resulting in future volume losses (Han
and Kellogg 2000). Wounding can either reactivate dormant
fungi already in the tree (if the wound is within 31 cm of the
scar), or serve as an entry point for decay spores (Fillip et al.
1995). In the latter case, the size and positioning of scars
and the extent of gouging are important factors in determin-
ing if these fungi will become active (Hunt and Kruger
1962, Wallis and Morrison 1975, Aho et al. 1983, Allen and
White 1997).
The frequency and extent of decay depend on the area,
width, depth, and location of the wound, as well as tree
species and age. Overall, scar area is the most important

factor affecting the incidence of decay (Aho et al. 1983,
1989, Camp 2002). Aho and colleagues (1989) have shown
that 60 to 85% of wounds 900 cm2 have decay, a rate
approximately twice that seen with smaller injuries. The
same trend has been reported by Nevill (1997), regardless of
species. Moreover, Aho and colleagues (1987) have found
that, for grand fir, wounds as small as 56 cm2 and as recent
as a year old can activate dormant Indian paint fungi (Echi-
nodontium tinctorium) if they are within 0.3 m of the
damaged portion.
The amount of residual damage is very important for
nonresinous tree species (Aho et al. 1983) that are particu-
larly susceptible to agents such as Indian paint fungi (Aho
and Filip 1982, Filip et al. 1990). This fungi causes nearly
80% of the decay in old-growth grand fir stands in eastern
Oregon and Washington (Aho 1977). In this species, the
rate of decay is rapid in the first 3 to 5 years even though
volume loss is small (Wright and Isaac, 1956). Filip and
co-workers (1995) have also noted from one study that,
although lodgepole and ponderosa pines show no decay in
the first 3 years after thinning and wounding, the level of
decay is extensive in wounded grand fir trees during that
time. Therefore, the period between thinning and final har-
vest can be important in predicting the total amount of
decay, especially with highly susceptible species. Neverthe-
less, Filip and co-workers (1984) have shown that, for most
species, wounds less than 10 years old have no decay, but
the rate of decay occurrence increases with age regardless of
original wound size.
Studies of residual damage in the Pacific Northwest have
focused on stands of primarily Douglas-fir and western
hemlock in Oregon and Washington (Bettinger and Kellogg
1993, Han and Kellogg 2000). No research has previously
been reported on the level of damage associated with cut-
to-length (CTL) thinning in the predominately grand fir
stands of northern Idaho although CTL harvesting has be-
come a popular means for thinning second-growth conifer
stands in the Inland Northwest. Therefore, the objective of
this study was to provide information to foresters in that
region about the effect of the CTL system on residual trees.
This was done by 1) examining a commercially thinned
stand in northern Idaho for stand damage; 2) determining
whether statistically significant differences in stand damage
occurred among species; and 3) predicting future volume
losses for grand fir that resulted from these CTL operations.
Methods
The study site, located just outside of Elk River in
northern Idaho, has an average slope of 12% and an
average elevation of 914 m. Before harvest, the stand was
observed to consist of an overstory of predominately grand
fir, with smaller components of Douglas-fir, western larch,
western white pine, western redcedar (Thuja plicata), and
lodgepole pine. Tree ages varied between 50 to 80 years of
age (mean of 70 years) with a mean diameter at breast
height (dbh) of 28 cm. Basal area before harvesting aver-
aged 39 m2 ha1, with an estimated volume of 59 m3 ha1.
The stand was thinned via a CTL system (Valmet 500T
harvester and Valmet 892 forwarder) throughout a 2-month
period during the fall of 2002. Conditions were very favor-
able for high harvesting productivity, with hot weather and
firm (dry) soil conditions. The harvester operator had 5
years of experience, whereas the forwarder operator had 3
years. The machine operators were informed that damage to
residual crop trees should be minimized. Harvesting fo-
cused on removing grand fir, lodgepole pine, and Douglas-
fir, as well as any tree, regardless of species, having evi-
dence of infection by Indian paint fungi. The stand density
after harvesting was to be reduced to between 27 and 32 m2
ha1, at a spacing of 5 to 6 m.
On our 8-ha study site, data were collected after thinning
from the remaining trees, using 35 fixed-radius, circular
plots (0.04 ha each) that sampled 17% of the total area. Plots
were arranged 52 m apart in a systematic sample design
with a random start. Transects were spaced at 49 m. Al-
though none of our plots were located in the center of any
skid trails, some did partially overlap them. Skid trails
averaged 4 m wide and 9 m apart. The maximum forward-
ing distance was 396 m.
All the trees within sampling plots were checked for
damage. For any damaged tree, we recorded species, dbh,
heights of scars from ground level, scar length and width,
gouge area (wood fibers removed from the scar) and depth,
and distance to the nearest trail centerline. In this study, we
defined scar as a debarking damage in any size down to the
cambium layer and gouge damage as wood fiber removal or
cutting into the wood section. If a tree had no damage, only
species and dbh were recorded. For scars located more than
2 m up on a bole, lengths and heights were measured with
a Vertex Hypsometer 3.
The total number of scars, gouges, and individual scar
area were calculated for each tree. For the number of scars
and gouge per tree, a generalized linear model was used to
model the number of scars and gouge as a function of
species, dbh, distance from nearest skid trails, and the
possible interaction between species and dbh. We used this
method because the number of scars and gouge did not have
a normal distribution and a nonparametric analysis was
required. A Poisson distribution was specified and a log link
function was used to conduct the analyses. All data were
analyzed using SAS version 8.02 (1999–2001; SAS Insti-
tute, Inc., Cary, NC). The total area of scar or gouge per tree
and scar height, however, was considered as continuous
variables and analyzed using a regression analysis to model
the area of scars as a function of species, dbh, distance from
the nearest skid trails, and the possible interaction (slope
difference) between species and dbh. We also estimated
future volume losses for grand fir because of decay through-
out a 20-year period, based on a decay volume prediction
model (Filip et al. 1983) and our damage data.
Results
A total of 265 trees were sampled, composed of 76%
grand fir (n  201), 14% Douglas-fir (n  38), 5% pine
species (lodgepole, western white, and ponderosa pine)

(n  12), and 5% cedar (n  14). After thinning, the stand
showed a mean of 172 stems per ha, with an average dbh of
40 cm. The breakdown of damage by species was 50.0% for
cedar, 39.8% for grand fir, 28.6% for pines, and 21.1% for
Douglas-fir.
In all, 99 of our sampled trees (37.4%) showed damage,
with an average of 2.4 scars and 1.7 gouges per tree (Table
1), for a total of 178 scars per ha. An example of the
scarring damage found in the stand is shown in Figure 1.
The average scar size per tree was 499.5 cm2 (minimum of
6.0 cm2; maximum of 6500.9 cm2). On average, 67.2% of
the damage on a tree occurred within 2 m of ground level
(Figure 2). The majority of the damage (67.7%) also oc-
curred within 4 m of the forwarder centerline (Figure 3). At
distances of 5 to 8 m, the occurrence of scarring was 28.1%
of the total; only 4.2% of the damage was found more than
8 m from that line.
Gouging was present in 41% (n  107) of all scars. The
majority (20.9%) of this type of damage represented gouge
areas that were 10% of the overall scar size. Although
16.8% of all scars were entirely gouged (i.e., 100% of their
area), 71% of all scars had gouging damage to less than half
of their area. In all, 83% of the scars had gouges 0.6 cm
deep; 16.8% had deeper gouges. Root damage accounted for
7.9% of all scarring. The deepest gouging probably resulted
from impacts by machinery, cuts from the harvester head, or
large branches that were broken off by falling trees.
Eighty-four percent of all scars found in this study were
smaller than 194 cm2 (Table 2). Another 9% were scar sizes
between 94 and 645 cm2 and 7% were scars larger than 645
cm2. By species, 80% of the grand fir scars were smaller
than 194 cm2, 11.2% between 94 and 645 cm2, and 8.8%
larger than 645 cm2. In contrast, 88% of the scarring dam-
age to Douglas-fir was smaller than 194 cm2, but with the
remainder (12.5%) between 94 and 645 cm2. No scars larger
than 645 cm2 were recorded for this species.
Spearman correlation analysis for all variables showed
low values (less than 0.5) of coefficients between variables,
indicating no strong correlation among dbh, distance from
skid trails, scar height, scar area, and number of scars. Stand
damage data were not balanced between species: 80 inci-
dents of scarring damage data for grand fir, 7 for cedar, 8 for
Douglas-fir, and only 4 for pine. The data of the number and
area of scars were analyzed to see if there was any signif-
icant difference between species, but gouge damage was
evaluated only for grand fir species due to lack of data for
other species.
For number of scars, GENMOD analysis indicated no
significant interaction (P  0.05) between species and dbh,
but the reduced model without interaction showed signifi-
cant effects because of species (P  0.05), dbh (P  0.05),
and distance from skid trails (P  0.05). Pairwise compar-
isons of the species using a Bonferroni adjustment for
multiple comparisons showed differences (P  0.05) be-
tween Douglas-fir and pine and also between Douglas-fir
and cedar, but not between grand fir and other species (P 
0.05). Because these three species (Douglas-fir, pines, and
cedar) had the low sample sizes in the analysis, these results
are best viewed as tentative and subject to confirmation in
future studies. For scar area per tree for these three species,
a regression analysis showed no significant effect (P 

0.05) of species, dbh, and distance from the nearest skid
trails on scar area, including an interaction term between
species and dbh. Scar height was significantly influenced by
tree location in relation to the distance from the nearest
forwarder trail (P  0.05), but not by dbh (P  0.05) and
species (P  0.05). By looking at only grand fir data, gouge
area was not significantly (P  0.05) affected by dbh and
distance from skid trails. However, GENMOD analysis
indicated that dbh significantly affected the number of
gouge per tree for grand fir species (P  0.05).
We used the following equation to predict the percentage
of grand fir crop trees with both incipient and advanced
decay at the time of the next harvest (Filip et al. 1983):
Log N(DV%)  1.8219 Log N(AG)
 0.8386 Log N(WD%)
 0.4151(AS)  10.4222,
where Log N  natural logarithm, DV%  percentage of
total crop tree cubic volume with incipient and advanced
decay, AG  mean crop tree total age (in years), WD% 
percentage of crop trees with one or more wounds, and
AS  stand aspect (0  N, NW, NE, W, or flat; 1  S, SE,
SW, or E).
For this calculation, we made several assumptions: 1) the
stand would not be harvested for another 20 years (AG 
90); 2) 71.8% (WD%) of the grand fir is wounded (30%
previously wounded trees, plus 1% per decade for natural
wounding throughout 2 decades, plus 39.8% for observed
grand fir residual stand damage). The initial 30% wounding
in the volume equation was assumed as an reasonable
estimate on the initial amount of wounds on the 70-year-old
grand fir trees (G.M. Filip, 2003, personal communication,
USDA Forestry Service, Forest Health Protection, Portland,
OR); and 3) the site had a primarily southeasterly aspect
(AS  1). Total decay loss was then estimated at 2.57% of
crop tree volume, 20 years after wounding (Table 3). How-
ever, if the stand were to have been left unthinned until it
reached 90 years (i.e., no residual damage), the total volume
loss because of decay would instead have stood at 1.31%.
This means an additional volume loss of 51% (or a pro-
jected increase in volume loss of 96%) caused by residual
stand damage from thinning activities.
Discussion
For commercial thinning operations in which no effort is
made to reduce injury to the remaining trees, residual stand
damage ranges from 22 to 50% of all wounding (Aho et al.
1983). We found that 37.4% of all trees contained scarring
of any size. This damage rate is comparable to those from
other CTL studies in the Pacific Northwest (Hargrave 1985,
Bettinger and Kellogg 1993). Residual stand damage is
influenced by pre- and postharvest densities (Hassler et al.
1999) and ground slope (Heitzman and Grell 2002). In our
study, ground slopes and residual stand density on the
harvest block did not constrain the harvesting equipment in
the thinning operation: an average slope of 12% and a 5- to
6-m spacing allowed both machines to move around freely.
Because oversized trees were hand-felled, the harvester
experienced few, if any, hang-ups. The leave trees were
marked by the Forest Service before harvest and the har-
vester had difficulty in reaching only a few stems. There-
fore, the amount (37.4%) of residual stand damage does not
appear to be caused by poor layout or planning, but can be
considered high. Aho and co-workers (1983) reported that
damage less than 15% when efforts were made to minimize
damage.
Our study confirmed the field observations that the ma-
jority of damage was found below 2 m along the bole, a
result of machinery movements and timber processing. Al-
though scar height would be significantly influenced by a

tree location in relation to the distance from the nearest
forwarder trail (P  0.05), the two variables were not highly
correlated each other (r  0.29). We suspect that the
spacing of trails in the block may have obscured this effect.
Scars below dbh are more likely to be infected than those
above. Damaged roots and stems that contact the soil nearly
always have greater decay than wounds farther up because
of the higher water content at ground level (Aho et al. 1983)
and presence of root disease fungi, such as Heterobasidion
annosum (Nevill 1997). In our study, the most scar damage
(67.2%)
was
concentrated
within
the

m
aboveground level with 42.3% occurring within the first
1 m. This varied by species: grand fir sustained 60% of its
scarring below 0.5 m while Douglas-fir had only 25% of the
scars located in that region. Overall, damage was concen-
trated below 2 m, a pattern that demonstrates that damage
was inflicted primarily by machine passes as well as from
the activities of timber processing and handling.
Root injuries were just a small component (7.9%) of all
stand damage and occurred only for grand fir trees and
cedar. Because trail location (P  0.0457) has a significant
effect on scar height we recommend that the number of
trails be kept straight and to the minimum (Hoffman 1990)
and wide enough to allow for easy maneuverability (Aho et
al. 1983). If this type of damage is expected to be more
severe, we would suggest harvest in the winter to benefit
from a protective layer of snow.
Our study found that tree locations in relation to skid
trails significantly affected wounding occurrence (P 
0.0016). Most damage (67.7%) occurred within the first 4 m
of the forwarder trail centerline (Figure 3), a result similar
to the frequencies of 64.0% and 72.2% reported by Han and
Kellogg (2000) and Bettinger and Kellogg (1993), respec-
tively, for that distance. Because more damage is caused to
trees located nearest those trail types, Aho and co-workers
(1983) recommended various methods for reducing its occur-
rence, including the use of tree pads and rub trees, as well as
improved layout of forwarder trails before harvesting.
Wound size influences the amount of eventual decay in
a tree. Our results showed a large difference in average scar
sizes between two species, Douglas-fir (65 cm2) versus
grand fir (425 cm2). The thicker bark of the Douglas-fir
appears to have influenced the scar size as well as severity,
with minor scarring (194 cm2) accounting for 62.5% of
the damage to the boles of this species compared with
38.8% for the grand fir. Howard (1996) found a similar
trend in that Douglas-fir was shown to be less susceptible to
damage, compared to other thin bark species such as west-
ern hemlock and western redcedar. Grand fir sustained
major damage (645 cm2), although this wounding type
was only a small component of its total (8.8%). Because the
majority of decay arises from that category of scarring
severity, we would expect that a substantial part of the
future decay would be restricted to a few grand fir trees.
Decay is more likely to occur when wounds are accom-
panied by gouging (Aho et al. 1983). Because 17% of the
gouges covered the entire scar in our grand fir trees, we
would expect that decay would be greater in those wounds
than in the other ungouged scars. Our analysis (n  75) for
gouge damage was focused on grand fir trees because of
small sample sizes with other species and indicated that
gouge damage was not significantly influenced by dbh (P 
0.1830) and distance from skid trails (P  0.9179). This
result indicates that minor impacts on thin bark species such
as grand fir may result in gouge damage regardless of tree
size and tree location in relation to skid trails. In GENMOD
model, dbh is a significant influence (P  0.0364) on the
number of gouges on grand fir. This indicates that a large
residual tree can be more heavily damaged than its smaller
counterpart suggesting that more care should be taken har-
vesting around larger trees.
Although there was no strong correlation between the
number of scars and species in our analysis our field obser-
vations would suggest the possible relationship between
species and residual stand damage. Other studies have dem-
onstrated that thin-barked, nonresinous species, such as
grand fir, are more prone to damage and decay (Aho et al.
1983). Therefore management plans may need to include
maximum acceptable levels of damage separately for each
species. We believe that our study site would be more

susceptible to infection after harvesting, especially by the
Indian paint fungi that is present and by Heterobasidion
annosum (Filip et al. 1995), because grand fir is the domi-
nant species. We also predict that cubic volume losses
throughout the first 20 years on thinned grand fir stands
would be 89% greater than if the stand were left un-
thinned (Table 2). Financial impacts of residual stand dam-
age on crop trees would be much greater than the cubic
decay percentage because board foot decay percentage
would be 2.7 times cubic decay percentage for trees larger
than 28 cm dbh (Filip et al. 1983). Furthermore, the pro-
jected cubic volume loss throughout a 50-year period could
be at least 83% higher for thinned versus unthinned stands.
Therefore, because scar age has the greatest effect on the
volume of decay, the time between thinning and the final cut
should not be excessively long (Aho et al. 1983).
We did not calculate future volume losses for Douglas-
fir in this study because the extent of injury to this species
represented only a small component of the total damage
(n  8 trees), and because its capacity for resin cover
immediately after wounding makes it likely far more resis-
tant to decay. For example, Han and co-workers (2000)
found that open scars on Douglas-fir trees show no decay
even 21 years after being damaged.
Forest managers must also establish maximum accept-
able damage levels and wound sizes that necessarily depend
on management objectives while offering broad guidelines
that serve as a useful benchmark for successful thinning
operations. Although scarring severity can be classified in
several ways (Wendel and Kochenderfer 1978, Bettinger
and Kellogg 1993, Nevill 1997, Han and Kellogg 2000), no
system has been formally developed because knowledge is
still inconclusive about the relationship among scar size,
tree health, and volume loss at final harvest. Han and
co-workers (2000) have reported that scars 10 cm wide
and 181 cm2 in area continue to cause serious decay 8
years or more after wounding of western hemlock. While
this is an example of a study investigating the effect of
wounding on tree health and future volume loss, long-term
studies covering a wide range of species and geographical
location are necessary to define an acceptable amount of
damage and minimum wound sizes that qualify as damage.
Conclusion
The level of residual stand damage (37.4%) found on our
research site is comparable to that reported in other CTL
thinning studies, with the most of injuries being concen-
trated within 4 m of the forwarder centerline (where most
activity occurred), as well as along the first 2 m of the bole
up from ground level. Scars were smaller than 194 cm2 in
84% of all cases; 9% were scar sizes between 94 and 645
cm2, and 7% were scars larger than 645 cm2. Tree location
appears to have an influence on both scar height and the
number of scars a tree may receive. Therefore, efforts to
reduce residual damage should be focused on protecting the
trees located near skid trails and the first 2 m of the bole,
where the likelihood of wood decay is greatest. Field ob-
servations suggested that amount and extent of residual
damage were influenced by species. If further studies con-
firm this relationship then management guidelines should be
developed to account for these differences. Our predicted
increase in presence of Indian paint fungi suggests that the
condition of the grand fir should be regularly assessed and
if substantial decay is predicted, harvesting would probably
have to be scheduled earlier to salvage as much commercial
timber as possible.
