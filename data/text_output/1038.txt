ABSTRACT
Cable yarding systems are often used to reduce hazardous fuels in dense overstocked forest
stands on steep terrain (>35%) in the western United States. However, treatment costs tend
to be high. The aim of this study was to broaden our knowledge by evaluating two different
harvesting methods (whole-tree (WT) and tree-length (TL)) used for fuel reduction thinning
treatment on mixed-conifer forest stand. Different harvesting methods greatly affected the
productivity and cost of fuel reduction thinning, especially in felling and yarding operations.
Total sawlog removal costs (stump-to-truck) were US$26.13/m3 in the WT-harvested unit and
US$24.01/m3 in TL harvested unit. TL thinning resulted in higher felling time and lower
production rate due to increased amounts of time for processing trees at the stump. In yard-
ing operation, however, TL method had a higher production rate than WT method because
TL method had higher number of pieces per yarding cycle. Processing production rates at a
landing were relatively similar throughout treatments although trees in a TL thinning unit
were already limbed and bucked at the stump. Loading productivity was consistent through-
out treatments because loading occurred independently from other activities. For fuel reduc-
tion thinning treatments using a cable yarding system, TL thinning was more cost-effective
than WT thinning if leaving tree tops and branches on site is acceptable from a fuels man-
agement perspective.

Introduction
Dense, overstocked stands have increasingly contrib-
uted to the cause of catastrophic wildfires: federal land
managers have identified 29.5 million hectares(ha) of
National Forest lands in the western U.S. that are char-
acterized as having unnatural or excessive amounts of
woody vegetation (USDA Forest Service 2003). These
stands generally require a mechanical thinning as a
silvicultural
method
to
improve
fire-tolerances
(Graham et al. 2002) and the implementation of
appropriate silvicultural and harvesting methods can
effectively reduce wildland fires in these fire-prone
ecosystems (Keyes and O’Hara 2002).
Treatments to reduce hazardous fuel accumulations
in California’s forests often involve mechanical thin-
ning because it effectively addresses the high levels of
fuel connectivity in high-density stands and allows the
use of prescribed burning with reduced risk of fire
escaping. Fuel reduction thinning generally defines the
reduction of surface and ladder fuels with thinning
trees, removing underbrush, and limbing trees (Pan et
al. 2008). However, the economics of mechanical fuel
reduction thinning are often in question to forestland
managers because thinning treatment costs are typic-
ally costly (Vitorelo et al. 2012). Several studies have
examined fuel reduction thinning involving various
machines and systems to address questions related to
harvesting productivity and costs (Lowell et al. 2008;
Pan et al. 2008; Bolding et al. 2009). Stand conditions
(e.g. tree size, thinning intensity, and slope) and har-
vesting system (e.g. ground-based or cable yarding)
and methods (e.g. whole-tree or tree-length) were
found to be critical factors to consider when evaluating
economic feasibility of fuel reduction treatments. The
unit cost of removing smaller diameter trees is gener-
ally higher than those for larger diameter trees (Lowell
et al. 2008). In addition, the unit cost of harvesting
low volumes per acre is higher than those for higher
volumes per acre. Kellogg et al. (1996) found that total
skyline harvesting costs for thinning treatments could
range from approximately 7 to 32% more than those
for conventional clearcut treatments. Thinning inten-
sity can also influence yarding production and cost.
Yarding production increased and costs decreased as
thinning intensity increased because of an increase in
the average number of logs per turn (Hochrein and
Kellogg 1988).
The topography in the western U.S. is often too steep
(>35%) for ground-based systems to be effectively har-
vested. Cable-harvesting systems often are used to

harvest timber in steep terrain, but harvesting with a
cable system is typically more expensive than with a
ground-based system (Daigle 1992). Harvesting cost in
fuel reduction thinning ranges from US$370 (ground-
based) to US$1360 (cable yarding) per ha, which is
often higher than the potential revenues from selling
the products produced from thinning (LeVan-Green
and Livingston 2001). Kellogg et al. (1999) found that
cable yarding operations often result in narrow profit
margins or even a loss because of high-operating cost in
thinning operations.
In the western U.S., whole-tree (WT) and tree-
length (TL) harvesting methods are commonly used in
mechanized fuel reduction thinning operations. In the
WT harvesting method, the tree is felled and delivered
to landing with limbs and tops attached to the stem.
This method is considerably efficient for a significant
reduction of fuels in the forest stand because most of
the felled biomass is removed from the site (Han et al.
2004). However, fuel reduction thinning with WT
harvesting method often triggers concerns related to
long-term site productivity and sustainable forest pro-
duction because nutrients are removed with the plant
materials harvested (Elliott and Knoepp 2005). For this
reason, managers often consider using cut-to-length
(CTL) or TL harvesting for fuel reduction thinning
operations. In a typical CTL or TL harvest, trees are
felled and processed at the stump and only the bole
wood is removed from the site. However, thinning
costs with CTL harvesting were found to be 10–20%
more expensive than WT harvesting when ground-
based systems were used (Adebayo et al. 2007). The
higher cost in CTL harvest was associated with more
labor inputs on the ground and the difference between
WT and CTL harvesting costs increased with decreas-
ing tree size (Han et al. 2004). These findings are help-
ful when selecting an appropriate harvesting method
and system that meets both fuel treatment and cost
management
objectives. Additional information
on
nutrient impacts and economic feasibility from differ-
ent harvesting methods and systems are needed to
make better mechanical fuel treatment decisions, espe-
cially on steep ground thinning operations.
This field-based study was designed to enhance our
knowledge of how to efficiently and economically
implement two different harvesting methods (WT vs.
TL) in fuel reduction thinning operations using cable
yarding system in a mixed conifer stand on steep
grounds. The specific objectives of this study were
to (1) compare the thinning productivity and stump-
to-truck cost for each harvesting method and (2) iden-
tify important factors that affect thinning productivity
at each phase of the operations for both harvest-
ing methods.
Materials and methods
Study site and harvesting system
This study took place on the Klamath National Forest
as a part of the Mt. Ashland Stewardship Contract in
northern California, US. The focus of this vegetation
management contract was to restore or create stand
structure characteristics of late successional stands,
reduce fire hazard, and improve wildlife habitat. Much
of the Mt. Ashland area is comprised of mixed conifer
forests including white fir (Abies concolor), Douglas-fir
(Pseudotsuga menziesii), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponder-
osa), incense-cedar (Calocedrus decurrens), and sugar
pine (Pinus lambertiana). The thinning site was 8.1 ha
in size and the ground slope between 37 and 68%. Our
experiment site was divided into two units (4.05 ha for
each unit). Each unit was randomly assigned with one
of the two different harvesting treatments using a cable
yarding system: (1) WT and (2) TL harvesting method.
The thinning prescription in this study was to reduce
wildland fire hazard by promoting forest health and
growth. In each unit, the marked (>22.86 cm in diam-
eter at breast height (DBH) trees) and unmarked bio-
mass-sized (2.54–22.86 cm) trees were cut. and all trees
less than 2.54 cm in DBH were left uncut according to
the silvicultural prescription. The thinning resulted in
structural diversity by providing a mosaic of tree den-
sities and heights and creating a variety of habitats for
plants and animals.
The WT harvesting method used in this study con-
sisted of chainsaw felling and a cable yarding system
to yard trees to the landing with limbs and tops still
attached. However, all trees larger than 50.8 cm in
DBH were bucked at the stump using a chainsaw and
yarded
to
the
landing.
A
dangle-head
processor
attached to a CAT322L log loader base machine at the
landing processed the whole trees to seven different
sawlogs sizes. Higher value sawlogs were produced
first. The limbs and tops left from the tree processing
were accumulated into a slash pile and the roundwood
of the tops were kept separate and decked in a large
pile for subsequent utilization as biomass or firewood.
The processed sawlog deck was separated into seven
different sorts by a CAT322C log loader. Logs were
sorted by species and log length to facilitate rapid
truck loading. Logs from this thinning were hauled to
a
sawmill
in
either
White
City,
Oregon
or
Yreka, California.
In the TL harvesting method, chainsaws were used
to fell and process trees at the stump, followed by
bole-wood-only yarding using a cable yarding system.
Although logs were already limbed on three sides and
bucked at the stump, a processor finished manufac-
tured sawlogs of different lengths (3.1–13.1 m) down to
a small-end diameter of 15.2 cm outside bark at the
landing. In both units, yarding was done using a
Madill 071 yarder (240 HP) with Eagle Eaglet motor-
ized clamping carriage run by five crews: a yarder
operator, a hooktender, two choker-setters and a
chaser with 7–35 years of experience. Yarding distan-
ces ranged from 76 to 290 m.
Data collection and analysis

thinning operation to quantify stand conditions. A

systematic sampling design, made up of 0.04 ha fixe-
d–area circular plots, was established with 100 by 100
m spacing. In each plot, trees down to 2.54 cm DBH
were recorded for species, DBH, and height since any
trees below this size were retained as advanced regen-
eration. This data was used to estimate the average
DBH, tree height, stand density (trees/ha), volume
(m3/ha),
and
basal
area
(m2/ha)
for
each
unit.
Allometric
equations
developed
by
MacLean
and
Berger (1976) were used to estimate pre-harvest tree
volumes in cubic meter (to a 10.2 cm top) for all of
the species present in the study units. The experimen-
tal design showed similarities in stand and ground
condition between WT and TL harvesting units (Table
1). There were no significant differences in mean DBH
between WT and TL harvesting units (p > 0.05).
Machine
costs
(US$/scheduled
machine
hour
(SMH)) and harvesting productivity (m3/productive
machine hour (PMH)) for each machine were calcu-
lated using standard shift-level and detailed time study
methods. Hourly machine costs (US$/SMH) were esti-
mated using standard machine rate calculation meth-
ods (Miyata 1980; Brinker et al. 2002; Table 2).
Information on machine prices, insurance, taxes, inter-
est, lubrication cost, repair and maintenance cost, and
labor cost were obtained from the project contractor.
Fuel consumption for each machine was estimated by
machine horse power (HP). Diesel prices were deter-
mined from local market prices during the study.
Estimated economic life for all the machines was set at
5 years with an assumption 1800 SMH/year. Salvage
value was estimated at 20% percent of the initial
machine price. Overhead and profit allowance were
not included in the cost analysis.
Detailed time studies were conducted to calculate
thinning productivity (m3/PMH) and evaluate interac-
tions between equipment, personnel, and harvesting
attributes on each phase of the thinning treatment: fell-
ing,
yarding,
processing,
and
loading
(Olsen
and
Kellogg 1983). Production rates for each phase of thin-
ning were compared between WT and TL harvesting
systems. Individual cycle components for each turn
were timed with a stopwatch, delays were uniquely
identified with their causes (mechanical, operational,
and
personal),
and
independent
variables
were recorded.
Regression equations were developed for felling,
yarding, processing, and loading delay-free cycle times
to determine machine production rates (m3/PMH) and
to understand how independent variables might affect
harvesting productivity. A felling cycle in WT harvest-
ing unit consisted of traveling to the tree and felling.
In TL harvesting unit, a felling cycle included traveling
to the tree, felling, limbing, measuring, and bucking.
Independent variables collected during felling opera-
tions were species, DBH, slope, travel distance, and use
of wedge. In both units, a yarding cycle consisted of
the following sequence: carriage traveling out from the
landing, lateral cable traveling out to felled tree(s) or
log(s), hooking the tree(s) or log(s), lateral cable travel-
ing in, carriage traveling to the landing, and unhook-
ing the tree(s) or log(s). The independent variables
collected were: yarding distance, lateral distance, and
number of pieces per cycle. The processor’s cycle ele-
ments included: grappling a tree or log, processing the
tree into logs, and piling the tops. Lastly, log-loader
cycle consisted of swinging the empty grapple to the
deck, grappling, swinging logs toward the logging
truck, and bunking the logs.
Stepwise regression analysis of detailed time study
data and evaluation of interactions between harvesting
attributes were performed using SPSS (SPSS Inc. 1998)
to develop prediction models of harvesting productiv-
ity. In all of the prediction models, normality tests,
residual plots, and the Durbin–Watson test were used
to determine violations of the Gauss–Markov assump-
tions. Furthermore, a forward selection method was
used to search for a suitable subset of explanatory

variables that were significant (p < .05). In order to
evaluate and reduce multicollinearity, the matrix plots,
Variance Inflation Factors (VIF), Pearson correlation
values, and Mallow’ CP values were generated and
tested. To validate the developed regression models,
30% of the observed data were randomly selected as
reserved data. Then, prediction models developed from
70% of the observed data were used to predict times
for the reserved data. A paired t-test was used to
evaluate the differences between observed (30% of the
data) and predicted travel times (70% of the data). In
our data analysis, both the acceptable error level and
significance level were set to 5% (a ¼ 0.05).
Results and discussion
Harvesting productivity and delay-free cycle times
The average time and relative frequency of hand-felling
cycle elements for WT and TL harvesting methods are
shown in Figure 1 and Table 3. Hand-felling cycle ele-
ments and times varied greatly between WT and TL
harvesting methods (p < 0.05). The average felling
delay-free cycle times in WT and TL units were 1.11
and 2.20 min, respectively (Table 3). TL harvesting had
longer felling delay-free cycle time because of add-
itional time needed to process logs at the stump. In
WT harvesting, felling time was the largest component
of the total hand-felling delay-free cycle time at 81%
and traveling to the selected tree made up 19% of the
total delay-free cycle time. In TL harvesting, measuring
and limbing (41%) and cutting (30%) activities were
the two largest components of total hand-felling delay-
free cycle time. Except for processing time at the
stump, the biggest time difference between WT and
TL harvesting units was found in traveling time
(0.21 minutes in WT and 0.5 minutes in TL). This was
because a faller in the TL unit often traveled back to
the stump after processing down the length of the tree.
The production rates for both harvesting methods
were determined by combining the average delay-free
cycle time with the cycle volume. The production rates
for hand-felling were 18.96 m3/PMH in the WT unit
and 15.80 m3/PMH in the TL unit. Even though delay-
free cycle times in the WT unit were less than half of
those in the TL unit, WT harvesting only had a slightly
higher production rate because basal area was larger in
the WT unit than the TL unit (Table 1). These results
are consistent with observations from other studies
that tree size is the most important measurable vari-
able affecting felling productivity (Kellogg et al. 1986,
1999; Hartley and Han 2007).
In the yarding phase, the average total delay-free
cycle time and relative frequency of the yarding cycle
elements for WT and TL harvesting methods are
shown in Figure 2 and Table 3. WT harvesting had
shorter yarding delay-free cycle time compared to TL.
The average delay-free cycle time for yarding was
2.60 min for the WT unit and 3.59 min for TL unit.
This difference might be attributed to lateral yarding
operation. The time spent pulling cable laterally was
significantly longer in the TL unit than the WT unit
although both units had similar lateral yarding distan-
ces (10.7 m in the WT unit and 11.6 m in the TL
unit). In addition, the ground was steeper in the TL
unit compared to the WT unit. The TL unit also had a
larger amount of logging slash on the ground from
processing trees at the stump. The logging slash inter-
fered with the choker-setter’s movement and produced

operation. In both harvesting methods, hooking was
the most time-consuming of the yarding cycle ele-
ments. The sum of lateral outhaul, hook, and lateral
inhaul time in WT and TL units consumed 54 and
55% of the total yarding delay-free cycle time, respect-
ively. The hooking and unhooking time was relatively
similar throughout the treatments, but carriage out
and in time in the TL unit were significantly higher
than those in the WT unit (p < 0.01). Carriage travel
time was influenced by the external yarding distance of
each unit. The average yarding distance for the WT
unit was 72.5 m and 118.6 m in the TL unit. The yard-
ing production rates in the WT unit was lower com-
pared to the TL unit, even though the WT unit had
shorter average delay-free yarding cycle time (Table 3).
This result was attributed from the differences of turn
volume between WT and TL units (1.39 m3/cycle in
the WT unit and 2.28 mt3/cycle in the TL unit). Turn
volumes were lower in the WT unit because of the
additional weight of green foliage and branches hauled
to the landing. For this reason, more volume per turn
was observed in the TL unit than the WT unit.
Therefore,
increasing
volume
per
turn
was
more
important than reducing the delay-free cycle time
when trying to increase yarding productivity. In our
study, skyline road change times were similar between
WT and TL units. The average skyline road change
time for the WT unit was 39 min (n ¼ 3, SD ¼ 11 min)
with an average yarding distance of 207 m. The aver-
age skyline road change time for the TL unit was
40 minutes (n ¼ 4, SD ¼ 8 min) with an average yarding
distance of 232 m. These values were very comparable
with past studies (Kellogg et al. 1986, 1999; Hartley
and Han 2007).
The processor manufactured different log lengths
(3.1–13.1 m) from whole trees and bole-woods at the
road-side landing area. In our study, the average proc-
essing delay-free cycle time in the TL unit (0.99 min/
cycle) was higher than the WT unit (0.82 min/cycle),
even though bole-wood in the TL unit were already
limbed and bucked at the stump (Figure 3 and
Table 3). Processing cycle volumes in WT and TL
units were 0.85 and 1.13 m3/cycle, respectively. These
results might be due to larger diameter trees in the TL
unit. Processing production rates between WT and TL
units were relatively similar throughout treatments due
to higher cycle volume in the TL unit (Table 3).
Log trucks were loaded from a cold deck by a dedi-
cated loader resulting in a consistent loading delay-free
cycle time and production rate between the TL and
WT units. Log trucks were loaded until the onboard
scales read a loaded weight of 25 tons. In our study,
average loading time per truck was slightly longer in
the WT unit compared to the TL unit, but there was
no significant difference between two treatment units.
Average loading production rates in WT and TL units
were 60.5 m3/PMH and 59.4 m3/PMH, respectively.
Delay-free cycle time regression equations
Regression equations developed from the detailed time
study predict delay-free cycle time for each machine. It
evaluates all the associated independent variables for
each cycle element to determine which factors influ-
ence the models. Equations were developed separately
for WT and TL units. All models were validated using
a paired t-test (a ¼ 0.05). Differences between the
observed and predicted delay-free cycle times for all
equations in both units were insignificant (p > 0.05),

suggesting that the developed regression equations
were good predictors (Tables 4 and 5).
In both units, the felling equation indicated that
tree size, the use of wedge, and traveling distances
between trees positively impacted the felling delay-free
cycle time. The distance traveled between trees was
directly related to thinning intensity. A stand with a
heavier thinning prescription would require shorter
traveling distances, resulting in shorter felling delay-
free cycle time. In the WT unit, slope at the stump
was also indicated as a significant variable affecting
felling time (Table 4). The equation suggested an
increase delay-free cycle time with an increase in slope.
In the TL unit, the number of buck cuts was found to
be one of the most significant variables influencing
felling delay-free cycle time (Table 5). Similar results
were also found in several past studies (Kellogg et al.
1986, 1999; Hartley and Han 2007). They reported that
a large tree size had increased delay-free cycle times
because it required increased amounts of time for cut-
ting and bucking.
Yarding delay-free cycle times were positively influ-
enced by lateral yarding and yarding distances, mean-
ing that a decrease in lateral yarding and yarding
distance would reduce yarding delay-free cycle time
(Tables 4 and 5). However, this result should be care-
fully applied in conventional cable yarding systems
requiring guylines because the use of shorter yarding
and lateral distance would cause higher yarding costs
due to an increase in skyline road changing time.
Research from past studies found that the number of
pieces or amount of volume per cycle were indicated
as the most significant variable impacting yarding
delay-free cycle time (Kellogg et al. 1986, 1999; Largo
and Han 2004; Hartley and Han 2007). However, in
our study, this variable was insignificant (p > .05) in
Table 4. Delay-free average cycle time equations for whole-tree thinning. All variables included in the equations had significant p-value less
than 0.05.

predicting yarding delay-free cycle time. This differ-
ence might be a result of our data collection methods.
Most of the yarding cycles had a consistent number of
pieces (3 or 4 trees or bole-woods) for over 150 yard-
ing cycles. Predictive equations covering various work
conditions could have been generated if the operations
were performed under different conditions. In all yard-
ing cycles slope, turn volumes and material were
fairly consistent.
The equations developed for processing indicated
that the number of logs per piece was the only factor
influencing delay-free cycle time for both WT and TL
units (Tables 4 and 5). In the WT unit, tree size in
DBH was excluded in the equation due to multicolli-
nearity with the number of logs per cycle. For the
loading cycle equations, the number of logs was found
to be a significant variable to predict loading delay-free
cycle time (p < 0.05).
Fuel reduction thinning costs for WT and TL
harvesting methods
The overall stump-to-truck sawlog production costs
(US$/m3) and percentage of total for WT and TL har-
vesting units were summarized in Table 6. Total
sawlog
production
costs
(stump-to-truck)
were
US$26.13/m3 in the WT unit and US$24.01/m3 in the
TL unit. The main reason for this cost difference was
due to the high yarding costs in the WT unit. Even
though TL unit had longer yarding delay-free cycle
time, smaller turn volume in the WT unit resulted in
higher yarding costs. Yarding costs in both harvesting
systems were the highest cost component (59% of total
cost in WT units and 54% in TL units) of the total
fuel reduction thinning using cable yarding system.
Therefore,
small
increases
in
yarding
productivity
could significantly reduce the overall production costs.
Yarding costs ($15.54/m3 in WT unit and US$13.07/
m3 in TL unit) in this study were comparable with
those (US$13.42–US$16.60/m3) found in a past study
(Kellogg et al. 1999). However, in another skyline thin-
ning study, yarding costs ranged from US$18.01/m3 to
US$22.60/m3 (Kellogg et al. 1986). Lower yarding costs
in our study were mainly caused by the higher turn
volume (2.28 m3/turn), compared to a past study
(1.59–2.03 m3/turn; Kellogg et al. 1986).
In hand-felling operations, the TL unit had higher
production cost than the WT unit due to additional
limbing and bucking activities to manufacture bole-
wood at the stump. Similar results were also reported
from Kellogg et al. (1999). They suggested that “limb
and measure”, which accounted for the most felling
delay-free
cycle
time,
would
provide
the
greatest
opportunity to reduce felling costs. In our study, the
mechanical delimber used on the landing at WT unit
allowed 20% decrease in the felling costs. Felling costs
(US$3.53/m3 in WT units and US$4.24/m3 in TL unit)
in
this
study
were
comparable
with
those
(US$3.53–US$3.88/m3) found in a past study (Kellogg
et al. 1986, 1999).
Processing cost in the WT unit was slightly higher
than those in the TL unit. Although the TL harvesting
method already limbed and bucked trees at the stump
during felling operations, higher felling costs did not
fully compensate lower processing costs. Loading costs
for
WT
and
TL
units
were
same
(US$2.83/m3),
because final manufactured log sizes and types between
two different treatments were similar and loading
occurred independently from other operation activities.
Conclusion
This field-based study was conducted to assess the eco-
nomic feasibility of whole-tree (WT) and tree-length
(TL) fuel reduction thinning using cable yarding sys-
tems. Total sawlog production costs (stump-to-truck)
were US$26.13/m3 in the WT harvested unit and
US$24.01/m3 in TL harvested unit. The difference in
fuel reduction treatment methods greatly affected the
cost and production of harvest operations, especially in
felling and yarding production. As expected, tree size
in both units greatly influenced felling productivity
and cost. Limbing and bucking trees at the stump in
the TL unit was found to be the major factor increas-
ing
delay-free
cycle
time.
In
yarding
operation,
although the WT unit had shorter yarding delay-free
cycle time than the TL unit, higher production rate
and lower production costs were found in the TL unit.
This result was caused by mainly the differences in
turn volume of the two units. As the turn volume of
the logs increased, yarding productivity also increased
significantly without impacting the overall average
yarding delay-free cycle time. Processing time and pro-
duction rates at a landing were relatively similar
throughout treatments, although trees in the TL unit
were already limbed and bucked at the stump. Lower
processing cost in the TL unit was not enough to offset
additional costs incurred by manually processing trees
at the stump during felling operation. Loading produc-
tivities and costs were consistent throughout treat-
ments because loading occurred independently from
other activities. Log trucks were loaded from a cold
deck by a loader, resulting in a consistent production
in loading between two treatments.
Our study indicated that TL harvesting was more
cost-effective than WT harvesting. It should be noted
that TL operations leave tree tops and branches on
site, which may not be acceptable from a fuels man-
agement perspective. It should be noted that this case
study was developed under specific work and stands
conditions. Therefore, these results should be used
cautiously and applied to similar stands and machine
