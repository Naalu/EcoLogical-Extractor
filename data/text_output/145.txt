Working Papers in Southwestern Ponderosa Pine Forest Restoration
Ecological restoration is a practice that seeks to heal degraded ecosystems by reestablishing native
species, structural characteristics, and ecological processes. The Society for Ecological Restoration
International defines ecological restoration as “an intentional activity that initiates or accelerates
the recovery of an ecosystem with respect to its health, integrity and sustainability….Restoration
attempts to return an ecosystem to its historic trajectory” (Society for Ecological Restoration
International Science & Policy Working Group 2004).
In the southwestern United States, most ponderosa pine forests have been degraded during the last
150 years. Many ponderosa pine areas are now dominated by dense thickets of small trees, and
lack their once diverse understory of grasses, sedges, and forbs. Forests in this condition are highly
susceptible to damaging, stand-replacing fires and increased insect and disease epidemics.
Restoration of these forests centers on reintroducing frequent, low-intensity surface fires—often
after thinning dense stands—and reestablishing productive understory plant communities.
The Ecological Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona University is a pioneer in researching,
implementing, and monitoring ecological restoration of southwestern ponderosa pine forests. By
allowing natural processes, such as fire, to resume self-sustaining patterns, we hope to reestablish
healthy forests that provide ecosystem services, wildlife habitat, and recreational opportunities.
The ERI Working Papers series presents findings and management recommendations from
research and observations by the ERI and its partner organizations. While the ERI staff recognizes
that every restoration project needs to be site specific, we feel that the information provided in the
Working Papers may help restoration practitioners elsewhere.
This publication would not have been possible without funding from the USDA Forest Service.

Understory Seeding in Southwestern Forests 
Following Wildfire and Ecological Restoration Treatments
Introduction
Shrubs, grasses, sedges, and forbs form the understory of
ponderosa pine and pinyon-juniper ecosystems. They cover
the natural openings in these two ecosystems—openings that
were much more extensive historically than they are today.
While restoration treatments in these ecosystems typically
focus on trees, it is also important to restore the natural
diversity and productivity of the understory plant community
because a healthy understory provides wildlife habitat and
fuel for low-intensity fires that maintain forest structure.
Restoring a healthy understory may require little or a great
deal of effort, depending upon the site conditions and site
history. Many sites still support some native understory
species, either living or in the seedbank, in which case
thinning of overstory trees and conducting some prescribed
fires is often enough to promote the growth of a healthy
understory. In situations where the treated area is adjacent to
a weed-free area with a highly diverse understory, it may be
possible to simply let nature reseed the treated site. Still other
sites lack native understory species and their seeds, in which
case it may be necessary to reintroduce those species as either
seeds or seedlings. In this working paper, we cover this last
situation—one where active seeding is needed.
Some Cautions
Before discussing the use of seeds to restore a ponderosa pine
or pinyon-juniper understory, several points of caution need
to be raised. First, the arid and semi-arid climates of the
Southwest make seeding of almost any species a risky
enterprise. The vagaries of temperature and rainfall are
especially acute in the region, and success often depends on a
bit of luck along with well thought-out plans and precise
implementation. Second, seed availability is often limited due
to a variety of factors, not the least of which are crop failures
due to climatic variations, unusually high demand for seed
during years when large restoration or rehabilitation plantings
occur, and a dearth of native seed suppliers in the region
(Bermant and Spackeen 1997). Third, seed predation by birds
and rodents can seriously reduce the level of germination
(Nelson et al. 1970). Fourth, weedy contaminants in seed
mixes and single–seed allotments can cause problems by
introducing additional and unexpected competition,
especially from invasive plants (Keeley et al. 2006). Fifth,
serious ecological problems can arise when using seed that is
not genetically similar to local, native species (Belnap 1995,
Jones and Johnson 1998, Barclay et al. 2004, Beyers 2004).
Nevertheless, successful seeding can: 1) increase native species
diversity, richness, and/or cover; 2) improve wildlife habitat
and/or forage for livestock; 3) provide competition to
invasive, non-native species; 4) improve soil quality; and 5)
aid in erosion control.
Basic Tasks
The process of seeding following wildfire and ecological
restoration treatments involves five general tasks: 1) obtaining
seed or other plant propagules, 2) developing seed mixtures,
3) conducting site preparation, 4) implementing the planting,
and 5) monitoring and adaptive management.
Obtaining and
Storing Seeds
Most agencies,
institutions, and
individuals in the
Southwest buy seed
for their revegetation
and restoration
projects. Buyers
should talk with
suppliers and confirm
the type of seed (e.g., wild collected or cultivated) and its
geographical source (e.g., either in terms of a physical
location or whether the seed is source-certified). They should
keep in mind that, as a general rule, the farther north or south
the seed source is from the restoration site, the less likely the
plant material collected at the source will be able to adapt to
the conditions at the restoration site. In the Southwest,
purchased seed should come from areas that also experience a
precipitation pattern that includes summer monsoonal
moisture as well as winter precipitation. Buyers should make
clear to the supplier the exact species they want, and the other
specifications of their purchase, especially the Pure Live Seed
rate, moisture content, cleanliness, packaging, and delivery
date. A seed delivery checklist should be used to confirm that
the specifications have been met. This information can be
used to verify that the supplier should be paid or to reject a
seed delivery or discuss partial payment with a supplier.
Monsen and his colleagues (2004) provide some basic
principles for planning and implementing rangeland
revegetation projects. Many of these principles are also
relevant to seeding in ponderosa pine and pinyon-juniper
ecosystems. While it may be impossible to attain all these
goals, the more that can be put into practice, the more
successful a project will be. The principles, slightly
modified from Monsen’s originals, are as follows:
•
The proposed changes to the plant community must
be necessary and ecologically attainable.
•
The choice of species should support the goals and
objectives of the project.
•
The terrain and soil must support the desired
changes.
•
Precipitation or irrigation (Bainbridge 2007) must be
adequate to assure establishment and survival of
seeded species.
•
Competition must be controlled to ensure that
planted species can establish and persist.
•
Plant only site-adapted species, subspecies, and
varieties.
•
Consider planting a multi-species seed mixture.
•
Use sufficient seed of acceptable purity and viability.
•
Plant into a well-prepared seedbed and cover the seed
approprately.
•
Plant during the season that provides the most
favorable conditions for establishment.
•
Newly seeded areas must be managed properly to
avoid harmful effects, such as herbivory and human-
caused injury to new seedlings.

If purchased seed will be stored for any length of time before
seeding, it should be handled carefully, stored in paper, poly
or cloth bags, and kept from excessive light, heat, cold, and
moisture. A cool, dry, ventilated place free of insects and
rodents is best. Pre-storage treatment (either freezing or use
of an insecticide or dessicant) can help prevent loss of seed.
Stored seed should be labeled and dated, and its whereabouts
tracked in a database.
An alternative approach for obtaining seed is to collect it at or
near the restoration site and ship it to farms or ranches where
it can be irrigated, grown, harvested, and then shipped back
to the restoration site for planting (a method call “seed
increase”). While the cost of such an operation can be as
much or more than buying seed from a supplier, this
approach does have the advantages of supporting local
farmers and ranchers and producing genetically appropriate,
weed-free seed that is specific to a restoration site.
This paper is not large enough to cover the seeding and
propagation requirements of each individual species found in
southwestern ponderosa pine or pinyon-juniper ecosystems.

DEVELOPING SEEDING MIXES
The general rule for developing a seed mix is to use sufficient
seed to produce the desired understory without wasting seed
or money. The amount of seed used in any mix is influenced
by the species used, seed purity, seed viability, the condition
and type of seedbed, the method of seeding, the amount of
competing vegetation present, and the project objectives
(Monsen et al. 2004). It is also influenced by the size of the
area being seeded, the topography, elevation, soils, and
knowledge of which species have worked best in similar
situations in the past. Managers who have access to existing
reference sites (e.g., research natural areas) that are physically
comparable to the restoration site should consider using them
as guides for developing the species composition of a seed
mix. Historical information about understory species can
likewise be used, either independently or in conjunction with
reference site information.
Seed Viability and Pure Live Seed
Knowing whether a seed is viable indicates whether it will
germinate. A simple viability test for grass seed involves
checking the seed to see if it has entered the hard-dough
stage. Seeds in the hard-dough stage are plump and firm, and
will not exude endosperm when pressed between the nails of
the thumb and forefinger. Another method is to take a small
sample of seeds, germinate them, and then calculate the
percentage that germinated from the total planted. Many
people and organizations use a lab test in which a sample of
seeds is soaked in a tetrazolium solution (TZ) that causes the
seed embryos and cotyledons to turn dark red, if they are
viable. Protocols for seed testing have been established by the
Association of Official Seed Analysts, Inc. and the
International Seed Testing Association.
Seeds are generally sold on a Pure Live Seed (PLS) basis. The
PLS of a species indicates its germination rate and how pure
the seed is (amount of desired seed compared to the amount
of weed seeds, chaff, and other non-viable material). The
calculation for PLS is:
PLS = percent germination x percent purity ÷ 100
To put this formula in less abstract terms, suppose Seed Lot A
is labeled 98% pure with a 95% germination rate and Seed
Lot B is labeled 89% pure with a germination rate of 92%. To
obtain the PLS for Seed Lot A, multiply 98 by 95 and divide
the result (9,310) by 100. This gives Seed Lot A a PLS of 93%,
which means that 1.08 pounds of the seed will have to be
purchased to get 1 pound of pure live seed. Using the same
formula for Seed Lot B, the PLS is 82%, which means that
1.22 pounds of the seed will be needed to obtain 1 pound of
pure live seed.
In addition to knowing the PLS, it is necessary to determine
the number of seeds per unit area that will be required for a
successful planting. This number is usually between 20 and 40
seeds per ft2 (871,200-1,742,400 seeds/acre) for diverse mixes
(Diboll 1997, Monsen et al. 2004), although 6 seeds per ft2
(261,360 seeds/acre) is a more appropriate rate for those
species that spread quickly (Monsen et al. 2004). Determining
this rate depends on the type of ecosystem or plant
community being restored, the number of species in the
overall mix, the germination potential of the species being
used, and the project budget. Typically, seeding rates per unit
area are increased for sites with poor soils, steep slopes, low
moisture, excessive competition from weeds, and/or excessive
herbivory. Likewise, more seeds may be appropriated for
species that are slow to establish or those with tiny seeds
(Table 1). Shrubs seeds, on the other hand, may be applied in
fairly small amounts. Keep in mind that it is possible to seed
too heavily because there may be intense competition for
moisture and nutrients if too many seeds germinate.
Calculating Seeding Rates
To determine the seeding rate (expressed as the number of
pounds/acre) needed for planting a single species, multiply
the number of seeds per ft2 times 43,560 ft2 (the number of ft2
in an acre), and then take that number and divide it by the
product of the number of seeds per pound times the PLS
times 0.01. The formula looks like this:
# of seeds per ft2 x 43,560 ft2/# of seeds per lb x PLS x 0.01 
= lbs/acre of seed required
For example, if the goal is to plant a pure stand of grass at 40
seeds per square foot, when there are 128,000 grass seeds per
pound and a PLS of 90, the calculation would be as follows:
40 x 43,560 = 1,742,400 total seeds/acre
÷
128,000 x 90 x 0.01 = 15.125 lbs/acre
Calculating for a multiple-species mix is more complicated
and requires the planner to determine a proportion for each
species in the mix. This proportion, which can be represented
Understory Seeding in Southwestern Forests

by a percentage, is then multiplied by the number of desired
seeds per square foot for the entire planting. Once that
number is arrived at, then the formula used above for a single
species can be applied to all the species in the seed mix.
The box below provides a simple example of a multiple-
species calculation in which the desired number of seeds per
square foot is 50.

The number of pounds per acre for Species A is calculated as
follows:
30 x 43,560 = 1,306,800 seeds/acre
÷
60,000 x 75 x 0.01 = 45 lbs/acre
The calculation is the same for Species B, but produces
dramatically different results:
20 x 43,560 = 871,200 seeds/acre
÷
280,000 x 95 x 0.01 = 3.3 lbs/acre
When working with a diverse mix, the planner often aims for
a mixture of grasses and forbs (e.g., 60/40) that will ensure
there are adequate fuels (grasses) to carry fire and enough
forbs for plant diversity and wildlife purposes. Because this
type of mix may include many species, all of which have
different numbers of seeds per unit measure, different
potentials to germinate and different competitive abilities, the
calculations become much more complex and often require
recalculations to arrive at a mix that will satisfy the overall
goals of the project. The competitive ability of the species in a
mix should be determined prior to calculating rates within
the mix (see Monsen et al. 2004, Chapter 17, Table 12 for an
extensive list of the competitive abilities of various species;
Table 1).
Multiple-species and Single-species Mixes
Multiple-species mixes provide several advantages, including:
1) the development and maintenance of diverse plant
communities, 2) an opportunity to move plant communities
through desirable successional changes, 3) improved weed
control, 4) providing a better chance for species
establishment, and 5) allowing multiple values such as
improved wildlife habitat, forage production, aesthetics, and
hydrology to exist in one place. Multiple-species mixes are
also self-supporting. For example, sowing nitrogen-fixing
legumes will, in many cases, improve the vigor and growth of
other plants in the mix and improve the soil quality.
There are cases where seeding a single species might be
warranted (Monsen et al. 2004). These situations arise when
planting difficulties, limited budgets, and lack of seeds occur.
Rather than seeding slow-growing species at heavier rates in
these areas, they should be planted in areas separate from fast-
growing herbs or grasses.
Nurse Crops
Nurse crops help the early growth of desired species and are
commonly used in degraded habitats that have extreme
environmental conditions (arid or alpine habitats) or in areas
with a large number of herbivores. They protect and shelter
young seedlings from the harsh environment and some
species provide a refuge from herbivory (Padilla and Pugnaire
2006). Nurse crops are typically short-lived species whose
numbers decrease or fall to near zero as the planting matures,
often the first year or two after planting. Their planting rates
should be calculated separately from the rates of any other
planting mixes.
Nurse crops are sometimes used to provide cover, particularly
for shrub establishment or to control erosion (rapidly
germinating species are commonly used for this latter
purpose). However, the complexity of competition and
facilitation makes it difficult to determine if the nurse plants
will benefit the restoration or not. As a general rule, the
harsher the environment or the stronger the pressure from
herbivory, the more beneficial nurse plants may be. Additional
research is necessary with a number of species and on a long-
term basis before conclusions can be drawn.

SEEDBED PREPARATION
The two main objectives of site preparation are 1) to reduce
undesirable plant competition and 2) to create conditions for
the greatest levels of seed germination and plant survival.
Good seedbed preparation requires a thorough knowledge of
the site, including the land use history, soil characteristics, and
existing vegetation. Although proper seedbed preparation will
increase seed germination and plant survival, it is often not
done due to limited time or financial resources, rocky soils, or
a lack of proper equipment.
Eliminating or controlling non-native plant competition is
especially important in semiarid regions where moisture and
nutrients are limited. This is typically done in the Southwest
with herbicides appropriate for eliminating or controlling the
problem plants.
Seedbed preparations that create places to trap high numbers
of seeds, increase surface roughness, provide a wind barrier
while minimizing soil disturbance, and/or increase moisture
availability are desirable. Dragging a small chain behind an
ATV or small tractor and/or harrowing across the soil surface
usually creates microsites that will capture seed and enhance
seed germination. Land imprinters and pipe harrows can be
used in larger areas of pinyon-juniper. Rough surfaces tend to
capture seed, with large holes capturing the most seeds. The
most favorable water and temperature conditions for
germination occur within cracks, depressions, rocks or gravel,
plant litter or mulch, or vegetation that serves as nurse plants
(Call and Roundy 1991). Ideally, the prepared soil will be
loose on the surface but firm beneath.
Because soil moisture is critical to seed germination, seedbed
preparation with any soil-disturbing device must be done at
times that minimize soil moisture loss. In most situations in
the Southwest, this means conducting seedbed preparation
just prior to when a site will receive most of its precipitation.
Typically this means doing the preparation in the fall and
coordinating it with a late-fall planting or just prior to
summer monsoon rains.
Litter and mulch also provide desirable microsites for seedling
survival as long as they are not too deep or heavy. Litter
generally modifies air temperature and relative humidity at
the soil surface. It also delays soil water depletion in the
surface soil layer (Call and Roundy 1991). Neighboring
plants, particularly shrubs, may provide favorable sites for
seedling establishment. However, they can also compete for
limited water resources.
Various soil amendments, such as mulches, tackifiers and
mycorrhizal inoculants, have been shown to have varying
degrees of success and are extremely site-dependent. Any new
method should be tested on a small scale before being applied
to a large site. Inconsistent results have been obtained from
fertilization of wildland areas. In fact, high nutrient levels may
result in depleted soil moisture reserves due to the rapid
growth of nitrogen-positive species, particularly annuals and,
in some cases, invasive non-natives.
Restoring or revegetating areas burned by wildfires typically
does not require seedbed preparation if the seeding occurs
immediately after the fire and in areas where ash can be used
as a seedbed. Based on their work in Montana, Goodwin and
Sheley (2001) found that broadcast seeding directly into the
ash layer in the late fall and immediately after a fire produced
the most successful burned-area revegetation efforts. They
also noted that, if the ash layer is absent, such areas benefit
from seeding done with a no-till drill.
SEEDING TECHNIQUES
There are several basic seeding methods—broadcast (by hand
or machine), drilling, hydroseeding, aerial, spot seeding, and
interseeding. Each has its place, and the land manager should
carefully consider the site conditions as well as the logistics
and expense of each method before choosing one.
Broadcast
Broadcast seeding can be done either by scattering seed by
hand or by using any number of mechanical seed
broadcasters including those that strap across the chest and
dispense the seed as you walk and turn the machine’s hand
crank, fertilizer spreader types that can be pushed or pulled
across the ground, or broadcast seeders that are pulled behind
a tractor or ATV. Broadcast seeding is one of the most
popular and least expensive methods, and one that can be
used on sites that are inaccessible or inhospitable to machine-
seeding operations. However, seeding rates need to be
significantly higher (twice the rate used for drilled seeding)
due to the lower germination rates typically observed when
using this method.
Broadcast seeding should be done immediately after final site
preparation, and before firming the seedbed with a
cultipacker or by dragging small chains across the site. To
ensure complete coverage of the site, divide the seed mix into
two parts and apply the first part in a north-south direction
and the second part in an east-west direction, walking or
moving the machinery at as steady a pace as possible. Windy
days are not recommended for broadcast seeding. Broadcast
seeding on steep slopes without a follow-up method that
covers the seed with soil should be delayed until a snow cover
developes.
Drilling
Planting seed with a seed drill or imprint planter is a very
effective method for putting the seed into the ground at the
correct depth. As a result, drilled or imprinted sites typically
produce greater germination rates than broadcast sites.
Planting this way is also quite efficient because the machine
places the seed across the site at an even rate and it can be done
on windy days. Unlike broadcasting, seed drilling should be
done immediately after preparing the site and after the seedbed
is firmed by roller packing. Seed drills have four drawbacks.
First, they may not work on all sites, especially those that are
uneven, rocky, have bedrock near the surface, or have an
abundance of woody debris—as is the case with most
ponderosa pine sites. Second, they are expensive and require
other equipment (tractors or ATVs) to pull them. This can be
overcome by borrowing or cost-sharing equipment. Third, seed
drills require clean seed (awnless and without chaff), otherwise
the seeding tubes become plugged and must be cleaned.
Fourth, drilling may not be acceptable on sites with other
resource concerns, such as concentrated archaeological sites.

Hydroseeding
Hydroseeding requires access roads and specialized
machinery—equipment that applies a slurry of seeds, wood
fiber, fertilizer, and watery emulsion to a site. It is used on
slopes where erosion is a primary concern or on flat sites
where having enough moisture for germination is a problem.
The process can involve one or multiple steps. If all the
ingredients are applied at once, then the seeding rate needs to
be increased; the multiple step process applies the seed first,
creating better contact with the soil, and then applies the
remaining slurry. Mulch is applied when either method is
used to seed slopes. When applied to a slope, the surface
should be furrowed parallel to the slope. Typical average costs
(including a typical seed mix) vary from $300 per acre on flat
sites to $1,600 per acre for moderate to steep slopes (State of
California Department of Transportation 1999).
Aerial
Aerial seeding can be done with either a fixed-wing aircraft
using a Venturi spreader or by helicopter using a tethered
rotary spreader. Aerial seeding with an airplane has the
advantages of being able to uniformly cover extensive areas in
a relatively short time and operating across terrain that is
inaccessible to people or ground-based equipment.
Helicopters, while slower than planes, work well in
mountainous areas and on irregularly shaped sites. Windy
conditions can be problematic for either type of aircraft in
terms of distorting the application pattern. Access to this
specialized equipment may also be problematic.
Spot Seeding and Interseeding
Spot seeding is a good way to introduce species that have
small seeds and/or are expensive, or seeds with special
germination requirements. Monsen et al. (2004) report that
spot seeding following chaining on pinyon-juniper sites is a
successful method. Spot seeding into existing pits and
depressions is also recommended.
Interseeding involves seeding into the existing groundlayer of
a remnant or recently restored site and is used to improve the
species composition (Stevens 1980, Packard 1997). This can
be done using single species or mixes of species. Judiciously
selective seeding in protected habitats and microclimates is a
loss-prevention technique used successfully by foresters in the
Southwest and can also be applied beneficially to understory
restoration projects (Jan Busco 2001, pers. comm.). No
preparation is needed in areas of sparse open vegetation,
while burning or mowing is required in areas where the cover
is dense enough to significantly shade the ground during any
part of the growing season. Seed should be sown during the
season when it is most likely to germinate and survive. As in
spot seeding, looking for, and planting into, microsites that
will foster germination is recommended. Don’t waste seeds in
brushy areas or areas with aggressive weeds.
PLANTING DEPTH
Seeds geminate best when planted at a proper depth (typically
between 0.25” and 0.75”) in a firm seedbed (Call and Roundy
1991). Regardless of planting method, seeds should be planted
deeper in sandy soils (0.75”) than in clay or loamy soils (0.5”)
(Morgan 1997), although larger-seeded species can be planted
a bit deeper. Generally, seeds of most species should be
covered with about 2.5 to 3 times their thickness in the
cleaned state (Monsen et al.
2004). Species that need
exposure to light to germinate,
such as winterfat
(Krascheninnikovia lanata),
sagebrush (Artemesia spp.)
and penstemon (Penstemon
spp.), should be surface seeded
and then firmed or pressed
into the soil surface.
BEST TIME TO SEED
Seeding commonly fails in
areas of the Southwest for two
main reasons: 1) intense
monsoon storms wash seeds
away before germination can
occur, and 2) young seedlings
die during dry periods.
While the best time to seed
varies by species, restorations
of any scale beyond a small
garden typically require
planting most of the species in
a seeding mix at the same
time. If a seeding project in a
southwestern forest must be done in a single event, the best
time to seed is just prior to the summer monsoon (mid-June
to early/mid-July for a typical year) (Lavin and Springfield
1955) or in October and November (Monsen et al. 2004). A
dependable heavy snowfall will increase the chance of a
successful fall planting (Lavin and Springfield 1955).
Predation by rodents is also decreased with late-fall plantings.
OTHER FORMS OF SEEDING
Although not as well known, seed balls, fecal seeding, and
gully seeding provide alternatives to traditional seeding
methods. Seed balls are an old method of seeding in arid
environments. A seed ball is a mixture of clay, compost/soil
humus, seeds, and water that is formed into a ball and tossed
on the ground where it stays inert until sufficient moisture
occurs causing the seeds to germinate and grow. The Pajarito
Plateau Watershed Partnership is currently using seed balls to
restore areas damaged by the Cerro Grande Fire in New
Mexico.
Fecal seeding involves the use of ruminants (cattle, bison, or
sheep) as seed-dispersal agents (Barrow and Havstad 1992,
Gokbulak 2002, Gokbulak and Call 2004). Seeds of shrubs
and/or grasses are fed to an animal and, after two or three
days, are deposited in their dung. Barrow and Havstad (1992)
suggest that small-seeded grasses, which do not require burial
for germination, are best suited to fecal seeding. Gokbulak
and Call (2004) report that grass seeds with lower seedling
vigor (e.g., Sandberg bluegrass [Poa secunda] and bluebunch
wheatgrass [Pseudoroegneria spicata]) can survive well in the
thin dung produced when cattle eat high-quality, high-
moisture spring forage. Use native grasses with strong
seedling vigor (e.g., Indian rice grass [Achnatherum
hymenoides] or side-oats grama [Bouteloua curtipendula])
when cows are fed drier fall forage.

Researchers in New
Mexico (Barrow
1992, Gutierrez et al.
2004) have studied
various methods
and created different
devices for using
floodwaters to
reseed rangeland
gullies and riparian
areas. The basic idea
is to place seeds in a
gully seeder that is
located in a drainage
way. When rain
occurs, the device
will be opened at a
preset water level, releasing the seeds and allowing the water
to move them to sites where they will have the sediment,
moisture, temperature, and cover needed for germination.
Barrow (1992) reported good germination of alkali sacaton
(Sporobolus airoides), blue panicgrass (Panicum antidotale),
and four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens) using this
method.
MONITORING AND ADDITIONAL RESEARCH NEEDS
Long-term monitoring studies and additional research are
critical for understanding the best ways to restore understory
diversity and productivity. Robichaud et al. (2000) also
advocate the need for a better understanding of the response
of vegetation to fire in order to increase our knowledge of
whether or when seeding may be necessary.
In order to be useful, monitoring data should provide
information about how well the goals of the restoration are
being met. The questions that provide the basis for
establishing a monitoring program are as follows:
•
What is the plant community or ecosystem being
restored?
•
What are the expected functions, structures, and
composition of this community or ecosystem during
various phases of its restoration?
•
What techniques can be used to measure changes in the
community or ecosystem?
•
What types of change, and at what levels, need to occur
over what periods of time before the restoration is a
success?
With these questions in mind, a protocol of inventorying and
sampling the important components of the restoration can
begin, data can be gathered and analyzed, and adjustments to
management strategies can be made according to this new
information. Since plant communities and ecosystems are
dynamic, this adaptive management procedure is essential to
maintaining their overall long-term health.
Other Issues to Consider
BENEFITS OF MULTIPLE-YEAR SEEDINGS
Although very little research in the Southwest has been done
on seeding in multiple years, this technique may be a
desirable way to revegetate plantings that failed due to
predation or drought. Packard (1997) reports that planting
sections of a site during the course of several years, even
decades, is a reasonable alternative to planting the entire site
whenever there are constraints involving budget, personnel, or
seed. He also suggests planting scattered plantings across a
site—areas that will act as “seed islands.”
SEED ISLANDS
A “seed island” is an area that serves as a source of propagules
for an adjacent restoration area. Very little experimentation
has been done with seed islands, although Reever-Morghan
and Sheley (2005) found that the two species they planted in
seed islands––purple coneflower (Echinacea purpureum) and
white sagebrush (Artemisia ludoviciana)––did recruit into
nearby restoration areas. However, Indian breadroot
(Pediomelum spp.) did not recruit quickly using this method.
Additional experimental projects are needed to gain
information about the effectiveness of this approach in
promoting species diversity in burned areas and sites
undergoing restoration.
PROTECTION FROM DESTRUCTIVE ACTIVITIES
Because understory plantings can take several years to mature
and are a significant investment in time and financial
resources, managers need to consider ways to protect them
from detrimental activities such as off-road vehicle traffic,
camping/hiking, and herbivory. For these reasons and others,
newly seeded sites should be protected from such activities for
at least the first two to three growing seasons; areas subjected
to drought should be protected even longer. Some of the
more compatible activities may be reintroduced once the
understory is established and healthy, although they should be
carefully regulated and monitored.
SEED LIMITATIONS
Seed limitation is defined as an increase in population size
following seed addition (Turnbull et al. 2000). It tends to
occur more commonly in early successional habitats and in
early successional species. Seed limitation is becoming of
primary concern in restoration of many ecosystems (Young et
al. 2005), including southwestern ponderosa pine forests.
Several seedbank studies (Vose and White 1987, Korb et al.
2005, Abella et al., 2007) seem to indicate that viable, native
seeds are lacking in ponderosa pine forests and, that they,
cannot provide a large source of propagules following
restoration treatments. Dispersal of seeds can also be limited.
Sowing additional seeds often increases numbers of
individuals, indicating that there may be more safe sites than
available seeds (Young et al. 2005). Long-term monitoring is
rarely conducted following seeding studies, so it is not well-
understood how long seeded species persist, and whether it is
a transient condition.
