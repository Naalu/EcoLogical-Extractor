WildÔ¨Åre suppression costs have been increasing since the early 1970's. With growing concern over wildÔ¨Åre
suppression costs, our analysis addresses restoration treatment eÔ¨Äectiveness in reducing wildÔ¨Åre suppression
costs. We examine past Ô¨Åres across the Northern Arizona landscape to determine Ô¨Åre behavior characteristics
that are signiÔ¨Åcant in predicting wildÔ¨Åre suppression costs and capable of being modeled in Ô¨Åre simulations
prior to wildÔ¨Åre events. We Ô¨Ånd burn severity metrics to be signiÔ¨Åcant in predicting wildÔ¨Åre suppression costs.
Three proposed treatment alternatives for the Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4-FRI) are analyzed to de-
termine treatment eÔ¨Äectiveness and policy implications in reducing burn severity metrics and wildÔ¨Åre sup-
pression costs. The more aggressive treatments are more eÔ¨Äective in reducing wildÔ¨Åre suppression costs except
in the case of sever wind and weather events.
1. Introduction
Federal
agencies,
including
the
USDA
Forest
Service
and
Department of Interior (DOI), experienced a rising trend in wildland
Ô¨Åre management expenditures beginning in 1971. A 2015 GAO report
documented the average annual expenditure on wildland Ô¨Åre man-
agement activities at $3.4 billion over the 2004‚Äì2014 Ô¨Åscal years
(GAO, 2015). The appropriation for wildland Ô¨Åre management activ-
ities by the Forest Service and DOI more than doubled to an annual
average of $2.9 billion during the 2001‚Äì2007-time frame compared to
an annual average of $1.2 billion from 1996 to 2000 (GAO, 2009). This
rising trend in wildland Ô¨Åre management expenditures is forecasted to
continue in the future with higher frequency of wildland Ô¨Åre occur-
rences, longer durations of wildland Ô¨Åre seasons (Westerling et al.,
2006), and the expansion of residential development within the wild-
land-urban interface (WUI) (RadeloÔ¨Äet al., 2005a, 2005b).
In previous studies wildÔ¨Åre size has been shown to be correlated with
estimating suppression costs (Calkin et al., 2005; Liang et al., 2008;
Thompson et al., 2013). If Ô¨Åre suppression costs are to be mitigated, it
seems appropriate to focus on the factors, treatments, and policy that re-
late to Ô¨Åres categorized as ‚Äúlarge‚Äù in size or where the severe wildÔ¨Åre
threat is greatest (Pollet and Omi, 2002; Holmes et al., 2008). Our analysis
expands on previous studies by examining burn characteristics of previous
wildland Ô¨Åres that are signiÔ¨Åcant in predicting wildÔ¨Åre suppression costs.
Examining previous wildÔ¨Åres near our study area allows us to determine
which Ô¨Åre behavior characteristics are useful in predicting suppression
costs. We further seek wildÔ¨Åre behavior characteristics that can be mod-
eled via Ô¨Åre modeling programs to determine wildÔ¨Åre suppression costs ex
ante. Incorporating wildÔ¨Åre behavior results, we develop a regression
model to predict wildland Ô¨Åre suppression costs. However, wildÔ¨Åre
modeling is not without error. Incorrect use of model inputs and under-
prediction bias from the models impact the model outputs and the con-
clusions drawn from model outputs (Varner and Keyes, 2009; Cruz and
Alexander, 2010). Our results are complementary to the future application
of Risk and Cost Analysis Tools Package (R-CAT) (USDA Forest Service,
2010). R-CAT's general purpose is to standardize the methods for esti-
mating risk reduction and cost savings resulting from land management
proposals and treatments. R-CAT is required for all Ô¨Åre projects funded by
the USDA Forest Service Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Pro-
gram (CFLRP) and our results are not meant to replace the required pro-
cedure (USDA Forest Service, 2010).
2. Background
There have been considerable eÔ¨Äorts to understand the factors af-
fecting overall costs of wildland Ô¨Åres (e.g. Donovan and Rideout, 2003;

Donovan et al., 2004; Gebert et al., 2007; Liang et al., 2008; Lynch,
2004; Prestemon et al., 2008; Donovan et al., 2011). Intuitively, one
important factor is the increasing trend in total hectares (ha) burned by
large wildland Ô¨Åres. Wildland Ô¨Åres < 122 hectares (ha) in size ac-
counted for approximately 98.5% of the Ô¨Åres managed by the Forest
Service from 1980 to 2002 but these small Ô¨Åres accounted for 6.2% of
the total wildland Ô¨Åre suppression expenditures (Strategic Issues Panel
on Fire Suppression Costs, 2004). A comparison of the average number
of ha burned by wildland Ô¨Åres from 1970 to 1986 and 1987‚Äì2002
shows a stark increase from approximately 115,340 ha burned to over
405,000 ha burned annually (Calkin et al., 2005). For another com-
parison, 1700 Ô¨Åre ignitions burned about 1.21 million ha of forests in
the Northern Rocky Mountains in 1910, while three ignitions triggered
the Rodeo-Chediski and Hayman Ô¨Åres, which burned > 200,000 ha in
2002. While not studied directly, Calkin et al. (2005) reported that total
hectares burned track wildland Ô¨Åre suppression costs ‚Äúvery well‚Äù on an
annual basis. Large wildÔ¨Åres (> 400 ha) constitute a small number of
total wildland Ô¨Åres that occur across the landscape (1.1%) and these
large wildland Ô¨Åres accounts for 97.5% of the total hectares burned
(Calkin et al., 2005). The frequency of large wildÔ¨Åres has markedly
increased since the mid-1980s as there were almost four times as many
large Ô¨Åres burning nearly seven times more land between 1987 and
2003 than compared to 1970 through 1986. The trend in the frequency
of large wildÔ¨Åres has gotten worse and is projected to continue with
warmer temperatures and earlier spring onset via climate change
(Westerling et al., 2006). Although total Ô¨Åre size (area burned) in-
creases overall suppression cost, expected suppression cost per ha de-
creases as Ô¨Åre size increases due to the Ô¨Åxed nature of many Ô¨Åre sup-
pression related expenditures.
Total wildland Ô¨Åre suppression cost has been positively correlated
with various spatial factors in addition to Ô¨Åre size. However, some of
these factors have produced diÔ¨Äering results. In a study that examined
100 wildland Ô¨Åres > 120 ha in size between 1996 and 2005, ap-
proximately 58% of the variation in wildland Ô¨Åre suppression costs was
attributed to Ô¨Åre size and percentage of private land burned (Liang
et al., 2008). After examining 1550 wildland Ô¨Åres across the US, Gebert
et al. (2007) found that total housing value within 32 kilometers (km)
of the wildland Ô¨Åre ignition point had a positive eÔ¨Äect on expected
suppression cost. Yoder and Gebert (2012) also found that housing
values within a 20 mile radius of the wildÔ¨Åre contributes to an increase
in estimated wildÔ¨Åre suppression costs. Complicating the hypothesis
that the proximity of houses to wildÔ¨Åre increases suppression costs,
Donovan et al. (2004) didn't Ô¨Ånd housing density or total housing to be
signiÔ¨Åcant in predicting wildÔ¨Åre suppression costs. Rather, Ô¨Åre size was
again found to be the most signiÔ¨Åcant variable (Donovan et al., 2004).
Increased wildland Ô¨Åre suppression expenditure has led to a
growing interest in modeling eÔ¨Äectiveness of fuel treatments; namely,
changes in wildland Ô¨Åre burn probabilities and Ô¨Åre behavior due to fuel
treatments (e.g. Ager et al., 2011; Calkin et al., 2005; Cochrane et al.,
2012; Finney, 2005; Finney et al., 2005; Pollet and Omi, 2002; Stratton,
2004). The results of the Ô¨Åre modeling can be used to strategically lo-
cate fuel treatments in the landscape (Finney, 2005) and to estimate
changes in expected suppression costs due to fuel treatments (Wildland
Fire Management Risk and Cost Analysis Tools Package: R-CAT) (USDA
Forest Service, 2010).
Fire modeling used to predict Ô¨Åre size, characteristics, and beha-
viors has limitations. Because wildland Ô¨Åre behavior is modeled over a
given area of the landscape, the potential extent of a wildland Ô¨Åre
cannot be modeled via Ô¨Åre behavior modeling programs (e.g. FlamMap)
alone. ArcFuels, combined with Ô¨Åre behavior models was used to
strategically implement optimal fuels treatments in Region 6 (Oregon
and Washington, USA) by the US Forest Service (Vaillant et al., 2012).
With the FlamMap Ô¨Åre model, pixels are assessed independently of each
other regarding Ô¨Åre behavior.
Large wildland Ô¨Åres usually occur under the most extreme weather
conditions (Finney, 2005). The creation of the landscape Ô¨Åles that are
used as inputs for modeling Ô¨Åre behavior are at the discretion of the
modeler. These inputs determine Ô¨Åre behavior, thus consultation with
an experienced Ô¨Åre ecologist should be considered to develop appro-
priate inputs for more accurate results. In addition, inputs such as fuel
moistures; wind speed and direction; and weather conditions are
needed in determining Ô¨Åre behavior. Varner and Keyes (2009) caution
and elaborate on the need for accuracy clear statements of assumptions
regarding parameter value inputs (e.g. fuel moisture and wind speed)
(Varner and Keyes, 2009).
For modeling Ô¨Åre size, the FARSITE simulation system could be
implemented which simulates wildland Ô¨Åre growth (Finney, 1998;
Finney, 2004). FARSITE incorporates the above-mentioned inputs that
FlamMap (Finney, 2006) uses but goes further to include a Ô¨Åre spread
model, crown Ô¨Åre initiation model, crown Ô¨Åre spread model, and dead
fuel moisture model.
Cruz and Alexander (2010) point out three main areas of bias that
occur in Ô¨Åre modeling (Cruz and Alexander, 2010). Of Ô¨Årst concern is
the linkage of Ô¨Åre models that were created independently of one an-
other but are used in conjunction with modeling Ô¨Åre behavior. Sec-
ondly, Rothermel's rate of Ô¨Åre spread models and Van Wagner's crown
Ô¨Åre transition and propagation models have an underprediction bias in
assessing modeled crown Ô¨Åre behavior. The Ô¨Ånal point of contention is
the ‚Äúcrown fraction burned functions‚Äù (CFB functions) which are un-
substantiated by comparison to actual wildÔ¨Åre activity. We acknowl-
edge the shortcomings and complexities of current Ô¨Åre behavior mod-
eling tools and incorporate recommendations presented by Varner and
Keyes (2009); Cruz and Alexander (2010).
There are social and political factors that aÔ¨Äect Ô¨Åre managers' de-
cisions and the expenditures committed for Ô¨Åre suppression eÔ¨Äorts
(Donovan et al., 2011). In addition to Ô¨Åre managers' decisions, land
managers must also allocate resources to achieve goals of diÔ¨Äerent
treatments types (e.g. restoration treatments vs fuel load treatments)
(Reinhardt et al., 2008; Stratton, 2004). Ecological restoration treat-
ments can diÔ¨Äer from fuel reduction treatments; they are not analogous.
Ecological restoration is designed to return a current ecosystem to
conditions representing a range of variation from multiple references.
In the case of frequent-Ô¨Åre ecosystems like ponderosa pine (Pinus pon-
derosa) in the southwest USA, conditions from pre-Ô¨Åre exclusion (pre-
European settlement) are used to describe a restored system (Covington
and Moore, 1994). These restoration treatments include reintroducing
pre-settlement Ô¨Åre regimes, species composition, species spatial pat-
terns, and stand structures. Given today's overly dense ponderosa pine
stands with larger fuel loads, ecological restoration treatments attempt
to change Ô¨Åre behavior from high severity crown Ô¨Åres to low severity
surface Ô¨Åres in modeling studies (Stephens, 1998; Stephens and
Moghaddas, 2005; Ful√© et al., 2001; Ful√© et al., 2002; Roccaforte et al.,
2009; Stephens et al., 2009). Ecological restoration in ponderosa pine
meets Reinhardt et al.'s (2008) strict fuel treatment's objective as les-
sening fuel loads thereby reducing Ô¨Åre severity. Fuel treatments can
achieve this objective. However, in those Ô¨Åre regimes where infrequent,
stand-replacing Ô¨Åres are natural, fuel treatments could also create forest
structures that are divergent from their historical structure.
Budgeting practices have been implemented as a method to help
reduce expenditures on wildÔ¨Åre suppression costs. EÔ¨Äorts for better Ô¨Åre
budgeting and planning started with the 1995 Federal Wildland Fire
Policy and the National Fire Management Analysis System (NFMAS), a
tool developed by the Forest Service (DOI OÔ¨Éce of Policy Analysis,
2012). The eÔ¨Äorts continue with the 2009 Federal Land Assistance,
Management and Enhancement (FLAME) Act, which requires develop-
ment of a National Cohesive Wildland Fire Management Strategy. The
NFMAS seeks to optimize the Forest Service's Ô¨Åre budget for a given
geographical area by minimizing wildland Ô¨Åre related costs, utilizing
the known monetary costs associated with the ‚ÄúCost plus Net Value
Change‚Äù
(C + NVC).
However,
after
reviewing
over
300
re-
commendations in the previous Ô¨Åve years, the Strategic Issues Panel on
Fire Suppression Costs (2004) characterized the federal agencies
R.A. Fitch et al.

approach to Ô¨Åre suppression costs as ‚Äúblank check management‚Äù. Since
that time, several other spatial wildÔ¨Åre risk assessment tools have been
developed (e.g. Rapid Assessment of Values At Risk (RAVAR) and the
National WildÔ¨Åre Hazard and Risk Assessment) (Calkin and Gebert,
2009). The key question remains unanswered: if and how fuel treat-
ments or ecological restoration treatments reduce wildland Ô¨Åre sup-
pression costs in any signiÔ¨Åcant magnitude. The development of R-CAT
is to directly address this question for collaborative forest landscape
restoration programs. Namely, R-CAT provides a standardized tool for
assessing wildÔ¨Åre risk reductions and cost savings for projects that
might be funded through the USDA Forest Service CFLRP. CFLRP al-
locates Forest Service funds to projects that are competitively chosen
with the goals of reducing fuel loads and implementing ecological re-
storation treatments and monitoring. Up to 50% of these costs can be
covered by CFLRP funds.
The C + NVC model oÔ¨Äers a theoretical framework to the re-
lationship between wildland Ô¨Åre suppression costs and fuel treatments.
The total of wildland Ô¨Åre costs is represented by C + NVC. In the
general case of the C + NVC, costs, denoted by C (our cost measure of
interest in this analysis), are all costs associated with wildland Ô¨Åre
suppression and presuppression eÔ¨Äorts, including fuel treatments; NVC
represents all other Ô¨Åre related loss including property damage, fatal-
ities and other value changes in marketable goods and non-market
ecosystem services. Some aspects of fuel treatments can be considered
as substitutes for suppression costs for a given level of NVC, while some
components of fuel treatments can complement those in Ô¨Åre suppres-
sion (Donovan and Rideout, 2003; Rideout et al., 2008). Thus, an in-
crease in fuel treatments does not necessarily imply a reduction in
suppression costs unless the desired level of NVC is held Ô¨Åxed. Rather
than viewing fuel treatments as a substitute for Ô¨Åre suppression, fuel
treatments and Ô¨Åre suppression expenditures should be viewed as in-
puts to NVC. Fuel treatments and Ô¨Åre suppression expenditures have
their individual marginal and joint eÔ¨Äects to changes in NVC (Rideout
et al., 2008). Therefore, if we analyze tradeoÔ¨Äs between treatments and
suppression costs, the NVC must be held constant to directly compare
the impacts of the two decision variable inputs on costs.
3. Methods
3.1. Modeling of Ô¨Åre behavior characteristics
Our initial study area for Ô¨Åre behavior modeling is a portion of the
Coconino National Forest (southwestern U.S.A.), south/southeast of the
city of FlagstaÔ¨Ä, Arizona, designated as restoration unit 1 (RU1)
(Appendix A). At the time of this analyses we utilized the Draft En-
vironmental Impact Statement proposed by 4FRI. Three of the four
treatment alternatives were selected for analysis. We summarize the
three treatment alternatives as the no treatment option, the preferred
treatment option, and the medium treatment option. The preferred
treatment option is the most aggressive in terms of treatment thinning
intensity. Under the preferred alternative, 175,640 ha would be me-
chanically treated across the entire 4FRI treatment area. In addition,
240,072 ha would undergo prescribed Ô¨Åre. The medium treatment op-
tion
proposes
mechanically
treating
157,221 ha.
Additionally,
72,356 ha would be treated using prescribed Ô¨Åre. In this study, we are
deÔ¨Åning prescribed Ô¨Åre as Ô¨Åre's incorporation into land management
protocols (Ryan et al., 2013). The medium treatment alternative was
designed to address concerns about prescribed Ô¨Åre emissions. Treat-
ments alternatives were based on 4FRI's 2013 proposed environmental
impact statement (EIS) and Ô¨Ånal treatment parameters are expected to
change.
The current conditions of the entire 4FRI landscape were used as a
starting point to create the landscape Ô¨Åles (LCPs) for the Ô¨Åre modeling
carried out in FlamMap version 3 (Mary Lata, 2013 personal commu-
nication). LCPs consist of a compilation of data layers that include fuel
models, canopy cover, height to live crown (canopy base height),
canopy bulk density, slope, aspect, and elevation. For the RU1 area,
31% of the landscape had sampled data with the remaining proportion
extrapolated to create the LPC's. Fuel models and canopy characteristics
were altered to better capture regionally speciÔ¨Åc Ô¨Åre behavior and ef-
fects based on the recent Schultz Fire. Fuel models represent the fuel
bed inputs that include the load, bulk density, fuel particle size, heat
content, and moisture of extinction (Scott and Burgan, 2005). The
proposed treatments were then implemented at the stand level across
the LCP Ô¨Åle and the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) (Dixon, 2002;
Crookston and Dixon, 2005) was used to project forest structure
changes for the three treatment scenarios.
The Schultz Fire burned over 6070 ha north/northeast of FlagstaÔ¨Ä
in 2010. We utilized the fuel moisture conditions from the Schulz Fire
for the RU1 area during the three-month Ô¨Åre season of the analysis
(Mary Lata, 2013 personal communication). The wind and weather
conditions for the Ô¨Åre behavior simulations were obtained from the
Mormon Lake, Arizona remote automated weather station (RAWS) lo-
cated within the RU1 study area. Wind and weather conditioning Ô¨Åles
were created from the RAWS weather data from the years 2008‚Äì2012
for the months of May, June, and July which comprise the Ô¨Åre season of
our analysis. RAWS wind data was used in modeling wildÔ¨Åre behavior
characteristics as an input for average wind speed and direction (azi-
muth degrees, where 0¬∞ implies north to south and 90¬∞ implies east to
west up to 360¬∞). Fire behavior characteristics we modeled at average
wind speed, average wind speed plus one standard deviation, and
average wind speed plus two standard deviations.
FlamMap version 5.0.1.3 was used to simulate the Ô¨Åre behavior
characteristics of Ô¨Çame length and crown Ô¨Åre activity (Finney, 2006).
FlamMap is a PC-based Ô¨Åre mapping and analysis program that esti-
mates potential Ô¨Åre behavior characteristics for given weather and fuel
conditions (Finney, 2006; Stratton, 2006). Flame length outputs were
transformed into hauling categories as summarized in Ager et al.'s
(2011) Ô¨Çame length categorization. Flame length categorization pro-
vides a metric as to how eÔ¨Äective initial wildland Ô¨Åre suppression ac-
tivities might be. Ager et al. (2011) summarize hauling category Ô¨Çame
lengths of 0‚Äì1.2 m as being able to be held by hand lines at the front or
on the Ô¨Çanks; 1.2‚Äì2.4 m Ô¨Çames are too large for hand lines to attack
head on but dozers and engines can be eÔ¨Äective; 2.4‚Äì3.4 m Ô¨Çames
present problems such as torching, crowning, and spotting and head on
attacks of the Ô¨Åre are usually ineÔ¨Äective; and 3.4 + meter Ô¨Çames result
in crowing and spotting problems and head on attack eÔ¨Äorts are in-
eÔ¨Äective.
Crown Ô¨Åre activity outputs from FlamMap are expressed in crown
activity potential. The outputs are classiÔ¨Åed by active crown Ô¨Åre, pas-
sive crown Ô¨Åre, surface Ô¨Åre, and unburned. Crown Ô¨Åre activity was used
in conjunction with Ô¨Çame length to estimate areas of high burn se-
verity. In response to Varner and Keyes' (2009) crown Ô¨Åre under-
prediction bias, we used Ô¨Çame length in conjunction with crown Ô¨Åre
activity to create a more robust approach for estimating high burn se-
verity. Flame lengths are derived from Ô¨Åre line intensity outputs
(Stratton, 2006). Our assumption of high burn severity incorporates a
Ô¨Åre line intensity model output and a crown Ô¨Åre model output for burn
severity estimations. If a pixel is in the active crown Ô¨Åre category or had
a Ô¨Çame length of > 3.4 m, that pixel was estimated as high burn se-
verity. The Scott and Reinhardt (2001) Crown Fire Calculation Method
was used to calculate Ô¨Çame length and crown Ô¨Åre activity outputs in
FlamMap (Scott and Reinhardt, 2001).
FlamMap outputs were transferred into ArcGIS Desktop 10 Service
Pack 5 for geospatial referencing and analysis. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, ArcGIS was
used to categorize Ô¨Çame lengths and crown Ô¨Åre activity into the metrics
discussed above and crop the FlamMap outputs within the boundaries
of the RU1 treatment area. The spatial analyst tool, ‚ÄúRaster Calculator,‚Äù
was used to combine the Ô¨Åre behavior metrics of Ô¨Çame length and
crown Ô¨Åre activity to estimate burn severity. The number of hectares in
each of the combined Ô¨Åre behavior metrics within the treatment area
was calculated. The analysis for categorizing burn severity was grouped
R.A. Fitch et al.

as follows: High burn severity was assumed if any given pixel had a
Ô¨Çame length > 3.4 m or had an active crown Ô¨Åre classiÔ¨Åcation. Mixed
burn severity was assumed if any given pixel had a Ô¨Çame length >
2.4 m or had a torching or active crown Ô¨Åre classiÔ¨Åcation.
3.2. Regression analysis and suppression costs estimation
We conducted a regression analysis based on wildland Ô¨Åres that
occurred on the four national forests regionally speciÔ¨Åc to the treatment
area proposed by 4FRI (Apache-Sitgreaves, Coconino, Kaibab, and
Tonto National Forests), with the addition of the Prescott National
Forest, to estimate wildland Ô¨Åre suppression costs. The Prescott
National Forest was included to increase sample size in an area with
ponderosa pine as a landscape cover type. Burn severity maps were
obtained from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity website (MTBS)
(MTBS, 2013). Data on 67 Ô¨Åres > 324 ha in size on northern Arizona
National Forests between 2001 and 2011 was collected for the regres-
sion analysis. Historical wildÔ¨Åre suppression cost data was provided by
the USFS Rocky Mountain Research Station.
Variables of interest identiÔ¨Åed and collected to predict wildÔ¨Åre
suppression cost include dominant vegetation cover type, distance of
the Ô¨Åre perimeter to the WUI (meters), proportion of private land
burned, and total wildÔ¨Åre size (ha) (Table 1). Distance to WUI was
calculated using designated WUI areas as deÔ¨Åned by each of the na-
tional forests within the sample. A natural log transformed linear re-
gression equation for predicting total expenditure and cost per hectare
of suppression was utilized for analysis (Liang et al., 2008).
4. Results
4.1. Fire behavior characteristics
A lower proportion of the landscape burned at high and mixed se-
verities in July compared to May and June. May also had the highest
proportion of the landscape with high and mixed burn severities due to
dryer weather conditions and higher wind speeds. As expected, the
proportion of the landscape that burns with high and mixed severities
increased as wind speed increased across all months.
Comparing high burn severity proportions of the landscape across
treatment types, there is a large decrease between no treatment and the
preferred and medium treatment alternatives. The preferred treatment
type is the most eÔ¨Äective in terms of reducing the proportion of the
landscape that burns at high severity. With no treatment, the simulated
proportion of the landscape burning at a high severity under the three
diÔ¨Äerent wind speeds would range between 4.28% and 33.85% (May);
1.98% and 2.13% (June); and 0.9% and 1.76% (July). The preferred
treatment alternative results in the largest reductions in the proportion
of the landscape burning at high severity under the three diÔ¨Äerent wind
speeds with ranges between 0.72% and 4.01% (May); 0.33% and 0.43%
(June); and 0.02% and 0.13% (July). The medium treatment with less
prescribed Ô¨Åre also reduces proportions of the landscape burning at
high severity compared with the no treatment alternative but is not as
eÔ¨Äective as the preferred treatment alternative. The medium treatment
alternative has proportions of the landscape burning at high severity
under the three diÔ¨Äerent wind speeds ranging between 2.38% and
8.48% (May); 1.14% and 1.42% (June); and 0.73% and 0.88% (July).
Thus, treatment eÔ¨Äectiveness in reducing burn severity would be
greater during the month of May. The proportion of the landscape
burning at high severity during the month of May would be six to eight
times smaller under the preferred treatment alternative than under the
no treatment alternative. The preferred treatment alternative reduces
high burn severity by 2250‚Äì18,889 ha. While the reductions in per-
centage of landscape burning at high severity for diÔ¨Äerent treatment
types over the month of July are not as large compared to the month of
May, the scale at which the reductions took place was much higher. The
preferred treatment alternative is 13.5‚Äì45 times lower than the no
treatment alternative in percentage of the landscape burning at high
severity, corresponding to 558‚Äì1037 ha. The medium treatment alter-
native, in each scenario, falls between the no treatment alternative and
the preferred treatment alternative in the percentage of the landscape
burning at high severity.
Proportions of the landscape expected to burn at a mixed severity
exhibited more variability between treatment types. In general, simu-
lated outcomes of the medium treatment alternative were similar to the
no treatment alternative for the months of July and June. However, a
larger proportion of the landscape is expected to burn at mixed severity
under the no treatment alternative than the medium treatment alter-
native for the month of May. Again, the preferred treatment alternative
was the most eÔ¨Äective in reducing mixed burn severity across the
landscape for the months of June and July. With wind conditions two
standard deviations above the average for the month of May, the pre-
ferred treatment alternative would generate the highest proportion of
the landscape burning at a mixed severity. The no treatment alternative

ferent wind speeds between 13.43% and 68.19% (May); 2.3% and
2.68% (June); and 1.9% and 1.96% (July). Under the preferred treat-
ment alternative, the simulated ranges of mixed burn severity under the
three diÔ¨Äerent wind speeds were between 2.09% and 72.95% (May);
0.59% and 0.7% (June); and 0.12% and 0.24% (July). The simulated
proportions of landscape burning at mixed severity under the three
diÔ¨Äerent wind speeds for the medium treatment alternative range be-
tween 4.18% and 58.33% (May); 2.54% and 2.72% (June); and 1.83%
and 1.97% (July). The correlation between implementing treatments
and reductions in burn severity were not as distinct using the mixed
burn severity metric. Under the medium treatment alternative, the si-
mulated landscape showed increases in the percentage burning at
mixed severity compared with the no treatment alternative during the
month of June. Additionally, for the month of July, the medium
treatment alternative has a higher proportion of the landscape burning
at mixed severity on the upper range of the simulations compared with
the no treatment alternative. Comparing simulations of the no treat-
ment alternative and the preferred treatment alternative at high and
mixed burn severities, we observe similar patterns of burn severity re-
ductions over the months of June and July. However, for the month of

May with wind speeds two standard deviations above the mean, the
simulation for the preferred treatment alternative predicts 72.95% of
the landscape burning at the mixed burn severity compared to 68.19%
of the landscape burning at a mixed severity under the no treatment
alternative. The more open conditions of the landscape resulting from
the preferred treatment alternative are allowing wind conditions to
impact Ô¨Çame lengths and crown Ô¨Åre activity more drastically compared
with the no treatment alternative. Appendix B demonstrates the dis-
tributions of high burn severities across the RU1 treatment area. Tables

4.2. Regression analysis and suppression costs
The explanatory power of our model is comparable to and exceeds
other regression equations predicting suppression costs (Donovan et al.,
2004; Gebert et al., 2007; Liang et al., 2008; Yoder and Gebert, 2012).
Our regression equations for total suppression costs using the high and
mixed burn severity metrics have a R2 of 0.62 and 0.61 respectively.
As expected, total area burned was signiÔ¨Åcant in predicting wild-
land Ô¨Åre suppression costs. However, we also found that the proportion
of the wildÔ¨Åre that burned at high and mixed severity was signiÔ¨Åcant
and the overall model explained more variation in predicting Ô¨Åre sup-
pression costs than previous studies (Liang et al., 2008). From the re-
gression equations based on wildÔ¨Åres speciÔ¨Åc to Ô¨Åve National Forests in
northern Arizona, the model including the ‚Äúhigh burn severity‚Äù ex-
planatory variable rather than the ‚Äúmixed burn severity‚Äù explanatory
variable showed slightly more predictive power between the two
models (higher R2 with equal number of predictive variables).
Our analysis reveals a 1% increase in distance from the WUI results
in an approximate 0.16% decrease in wildÔ¨Åre suppression costs using
the high burn severity explanatory variable. Using the mixed burn se-
verity explanatory variable, a 1% increase in distance from the WUI
results in an approximate 0.17% decrease in wildÔ¨Åre suppression costs.
A 1% increase in the proportion of the wildÔ¨Åre burning at high severity
would
increase
suppression
costs
by
approximately
6.43%.
Alternatively, a 1% increase in the proportion of the wildÔ¨Åre burning at
mixed severity would increase suppression costs by approximately
4.91%. Examining wildÔ¨Åre size, a 1% increase in ha burned results in an
approximate increase of 0.53% and 0.7% in total wildÔ¨Åre suppression
costs for the high and mixed burn severity equations respectively. A 1%
increase in wildÔ¨Åre ha burned results in an approximate decrease of
0.47% and 0.3% in per hectare wildÔ¨Åre suppression costs for high and
mixed burn severity equations respectively. The RU1 treatment area
falls within the Coconino National Forest so this brings about a decrease
of approximately 78.27% and 67.96% for high and mixed burn seve-
rities respectively. The Coconino National Forest neighbors the city of
FlagstaÔ¨Ä, the largest city in northern Arizona. We hypothesize the
Coconino National Forest's proximity to FlagstaÔ¨Ä's infrastructure and
human capital for Ô¨Åre suppression as drivers in reducing wildÔ¨Åre sup-
pression costs. All our regression models had p-values < 0.0001. In
addition, each independent variable was signiÔ¨Åcant at the 95% con-
Ô¨Ådence
interval.
Table
5
summarizes
the
regression
equations
predicting suppression costs.
Fire behavior is the only explanatory variable that we allowed to
vary throughout the regression estimations. Ranges in predicted total
and per ha costs are similar between high and mixed burn severity for
the June and July months with a much higher range for the month of
May. Because of the drier weather conditions and stronger winds, more
of the landscape is predicted to burn at a mixed severity in the month of
May resulting in larger cost predictions using the mixed burn severity
regression equation. The highest estimated wildÔ¨Åre suppression costs
occur when wind inputs were modeled at two standard deviations
above their mean (24 km/h) during the month of May. In this analysis,
the no treatment alternative has a total predicted suppression cost
ranging between $2.4 million and $15.3 million with per ha estimates
ranging between $38 and $242/ha if a wildÔ¨Åre burns the entire study
area using the high burn severity metric. Under the medium burn se-
verity metric, the total predicted suppression cost. The preferred
treatment alternative results in approximately 73% of the landscape
estimated to burn at mixed severity. From the regression sample, the
highest proportion mixed severity Ô¨Åre was at approximately 68% of the
landscape. Because the preferred treatment alternative exceeds the
upper bound of the sample, we are not using this regression analysis to
predict Ô¨Åre suppression costs outside the range of model calibration.
The estimated suppression costs would range between $3.1 million and
exceeding $19.4 million with cost per ha estimates ranging between
$20 and exceeding $124/ha. The total predicted suppression costs of
the medium treatment alternative range between $3.9 million and
$14.2 million with per ha costs ranging between $25 and $91. Tables
6‚Äì8 summarize all estimated suppression costs under the varying wind
conditions. However, if other factors of wildland Ô¨Åre costs, including
rehabilitation and ecosystem service loss, are included in addition to
suppression costs, the total cost of wildÔ¨Åres has been estimated to be in
the range of 2 to 30 times greater than the costs associated with sup-
pression alone (Western Forestry Leadership Coalition, 2010).
5. Discussion and conclusions
Much of the recent literature on forecasting suppression costs of
large wildÔ¨Åres has indicated that the size of the wildÔ¨Åre is a signiÔ¨Åcant
explanatory variable (Calkin et al., 2005; Liang et al., 2008; Thompson
et al., 2013). However, using wildÔ¨Åre behavior characteristics has not
been examined. Our analysis expands the methodology of predicting
wildÔ¨Åre suppression costs by incorporating a statistically signiÔ¨Åcant,
burn severity variable into a semi-log transformed regression equation.
Fire behavior characteristics (e.g. burn severity) can be estimated
through various wildÔ¨Åre models. Our analysis links the outputs of
wildÔ¨Åre models into methodology land managers can use to assess the
eÔ¨Äects of fuels and restoration treatments on wildÔ¨Åre suppression costs.
However, using wildÔ¨Åre models to predict changes in wildÔ¨Åre behavior
should be approached with caution (Varner and Keyes, 2009; Cruz and
Alexander, 2010).
Comparing actual wildÔ¨Åre behavior to modeled wildÔ¨Åre behavior
shows an underprediction bias in the models (Cruz and Alexander,
2010). Wind and weather conditions have a major impact on Ô¨Åre model
outputs and errors can occur with incorrect inputs (Varner and Keyes,
2009). FlamMap holds wind and weather conditions constant across the
landscape (Stratton, 2006). WildÔ¨Åres never operate under the constant
inputs used in the Ô¨Åre models thereby inÔ¨Çuencing model outputs. In
addition, our study assumes that burn severity can be derived from the
FlamMap Ô¨Åre model outputs of ‚Äúcrown Ô¨Åre activity‚Äù and ‚ÄúÔ¨Çame length‚Äù.
Understanding the limitations of the Ô¨Åre models and limiting model
bias from wind and weather inputs is a necessity. We used onsite wind
and weather data to address potential model bias from decision variable
inputs. Our assumption for measuring burn severity was implemented
to address the underprediction bias of wildÔ¨Åre models (Cruz and
Alexander, 2010). Until more dynamic Ô¨Åre modeling programs are
developed, the assumptions and constraints of current Ô¨Åre models must

be understood to interpret the outputs. Our analysis acknowledges
these constraints but shows how Ô¨Åre modeling techniques can be im-
plemented into the wildÔ¨Åre suppression cost estimation process.
The results of this study identify several management implications
and important research areas for the future. Our wildÔ¨Åre simulations
show high severity burn conditions are interspersed throughout the
landscape under the current conditions while the post-treatment con-
Ô¨Ågurations change to a disconnected, spotty, conÔ¨Åguration (Appendix
B). This may aÔ¨Äect the wildÔ¨Åre suppression cost estimates as areas
under ‚Äúsevere‚Äù conditions could be allowed to burn until the wildÔ¨Åre
reaches areas with decreased severity measures where suppression ef-
forts are more eÔ¨Äective. For example, hand crews are not able to deal
with excessively high Ô¨Çame lengths and crown Ô¨Åre activity (Vaillant
et al., 2012). Focusing hand crew suppression eÔ¨Äorts on areas that
exhibit lower predicted severity (smaller Ô¨Çame length or surface Ô¨Åres)
would be more eÔ¨Äective. Fuel treatments may create unintended ne-
gative externalities as they reduce burn severity of the treated area but
may increase severity in adjacent, non-treated areas. Values at risk in
the adjacent areas should be examined before treatment implementa-
tion with respect to wind direction and Ô¨Åre spread probabilities (Calkin
et al., 2014).
Results have diÔ¨Äered in quantifying the eÔ¨Äects that proximity of
values at risk (e.g. homes) have on wildÔ¨Åre suppression costs. This
study and others (Gebert et al., 2007; Liang et al., 2008; and Yoder and
Gebert, 2012) found the wildÔ¨Åre's proximity to homes or WUI areas to
be signiÔ¨Åcant in predicting suppression costs. However, Donovan et al.
(2004) found no such relationship signiÔ¨Åcant. Other non-spatial factors
that have been used in predicting wildÔ¨Åre suppression costs include
media coverage and political inÔ¨Çuence (Donovan et al., 2011). Given
the large number of factors that have been shown to inÔ¨Çuence wildÔ¨Åre
suppression costs, further investigation into non-spatial factors of
wildÔ¨Åre costs (e.g. length of time the wildÔ¨Åre burns and types of re-
sources deployed, and number of Ô¨Åre crews used) could increase model
precision.
Our analysis holds the net value change of ecosystem goods and
services constant across the landscape to allow for the analysis of tra-
deoÔ¨Äs between suppression costs and treatments (Rideout et al., 2008).
However, an ecosystem's ability to deal with disturbances (e.g. Ô¨Åre)
inÔ¨Çuences the net value change. A low severity Ô¨Åre in a Ô¨Åre adapted
ecosystem is not expected to cause a shift in the ecosystem type or the
services the ecosystem carries out; a low severity surface might even be
beneÔ¨Åcial to the ecosystem and increase or provide beneÔ¨Åcial inputs for
NVC (Hurteau and North, 2009). High burn severity Ô¨Åres have the
ability to change the southwest ponderosa pine ecosystem and its
functions (Savage and Mast, 2005). Whether society gains or losses
from an ecosystem change is beyond the scope of this paper but worth
further investigation to determine society's preferences and values of
ecosystem types.

Low intensity Ô¨Åre regimes, corresponding to smaller Ô¨Çame length
Ô¨Åres (0‚Äì1.2 m) with crown Ô¨Åre being a low probability event are the
desired Ô¨Åre type for southwest ponderosa pine ecosystems (Covington
and Moore, 1994; Swetnam, 1990). Restoration treatments in the
southwest ponderosa pine ecosystem seek to reintroduce low intensity
Ô¨Åre as an objective. There are costs associated with these types of Ô¨Åres,
but we would expect the suppression costs to be lower as Ô¨Åre behavior
is changed from high and mixed severity to a low severity. Instances
with a naturally occurring wildÔ¨Åre under low burn severity conditions
could be used as a management tool and ecological beneÔ¨Åts of Ô¨Åre
could outweigh the associated costs in suppressing these wildÔ¨Åre types
(Ryan et al., 2013). This analysis shows that changing wildÔ¨Åre behavior
correlates to changes wildÔ¨Åre suppression costs.
As with any restoration treatment, reducing the number of severe
wildland Ô¨Åres is only one of the beneÔ¨Åts. Other beneÔ¨Åts include en-
hancement of additional ecosystem services like carbon storage, water
yields and Ô¨Åltration, wildlife habitat, aesthetic quality enhancement,
and recreational opportunities (Chazdon, 2008). Non-market beneÔ¨Åts
and costs should be included in the overall beneÔ¨Åt-cost analysis of
implementing restoration treatments. Further analysis of the NVC of the
landscape following treatments and the eÔ¨Äects of Ô¨Åre on the landscape
needs to be carried out to determine a more holistic view of landscape
value change. Our analysis shows the estimation of wildÔ¨Åre suppression
costs is correlated with wildÔ¨Åre burn characteristics. Through wildÔ¨Åre
modeling techniques, land managers can compare the eÔ¨Äectiveness of
restoration and fuel treatment projects in the context of wildÔ¨Åre sup-
pression expenditure changes.
