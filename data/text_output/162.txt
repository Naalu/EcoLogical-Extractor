Abstract 
We conducted a study analyzing the vegetation dynamics in four communities along an elevational gradient in the 
Front Range of the Colorado Rocky Mountains and compared our results with previous research conducted in 1981. 
The objective of this study was to determine whether the successional plant community trajectories hypothesized 
by the original investigator (Marr) in 1953 were consistent with plant community parameters measured in subse­
quent years. The ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir/ponderosa pine communities' herbaceous composition remained 
relatively constant between 1981 and 1996; however, a few individual species in both corrununities experienced sig­
nificant changes in frequency over time. These individual species changes, along with dominant shifts in the forest 
canopy, were inconsistent with Marr's original successional hypotheses for these stands that stated the ponderosa 
pine stand would remain dominated by ponderosa pine and grassy openings and the Douglas-fir/ponderosa pine 
stand would eventually have equal dominance between the two tree species. The aspen herbaceous community 
experienced the most significant change between 1981 and 1996. Significant decreases in species richness and 
diversity were recorded along with large changes in species composition and frequencies of individual species. 
These changes were associated with successional changes in the forest canopy, which was congruent with Marr's 
successional hypothesis for this stand. The kobresia meadow herbaceous community showed the least change 
between 1981 and 1996 among the four communities; however, there was variation in frequency percentages for 
a few individual species over time and a small turnover in species composition. Marr's hypothesis that this stand 
represented a climax community is consistent with our results.

into regions of similar environmental conditions and 
Our research continued and expanded upon the 
vegetation. Ramaley (1907) conducted the first gen­
only long-term study along an elevational gradient in 
eral classification of vegetation in the Colorado Rocky 
the Colorado Front Range, started by Marr (1961) and 
Mountains, dividing it into four life zones above 

2 
1800 m: the foothills zone, the montane zone, the 
subalpine zone, and the alpine zone. Marr (1961) re­
fined these life zones into four climax regions with 
distinct patterns of stand types based primarily on el­
evation. Marr (1961) defined a stand as a 'concrete 
unit' of vegetation that could be researched in detail. 
In 1953, Marr (1961) established environmental mea­
surement stations and conducted a quantitative analy­
sis of the plant communities for each climax region 
in the Front Range. In addition, he hypothesized how 
each stand would change over time from these data 
and the scientific literature. Marr (1961) predicted the 
successional trajectory for the ponderosa pine stand 
to be an open park-like stand of ponderosa pine (Pi­
nus ponderosa) and the successional trajectory for the 
Douglas-fir/ponderosa pine stand to be composed of 
equal dominance of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga men­
ziesii) and ponderosa pine . In addition, Marr (1961) 
hypothesized the aspen stand to become an Engelmann 
spruce (Picea engelmannii) and subalpine fir (Abies 
bifolia) steady state stand and he predicted the kobre­
sia meadow stand would remain a dry meadow climax 
community. Kooiman and Linhart (1986) continued 
this analysis by resurveying the general area of Marr's 
study sites for each climax region in 1981 to examine 
changes in the herbaceous communities studied almost 
thirty years prior. 
Study Area 
The study area is situated along an elevational gra­
dient between the drainage basins of North Boulder 
Creek and Left Hand Creek within Boulder County 
(Marr 1961). The foothills (ponderosa pine stand) and 
alpine (kobresia meadow stand) zones are separated 
by approximately 1550 m in elevation and 22 km in 
horizontal distance. The relative boundaries of the four 
climax regions and study sites are provided in Marr 
(1961) for the east slope of the Front Range in Boulder 
County, Colorado. Within each study site, Marr (1961) 
selected ridge-top stands to study based on their prox­
imity to environmental measurement stations and their 
apparent representation of homogenous herbaceous 
communities 'typical' of the Front Range . Kooiman 
permanently marked these ridge-top stand locations 
with iron stakes in 1981 based upon written records 
(Marr 1961), field visits, and personal communication 
with Marr (Kooiman & Linhart 1986). 
Methods 
Field methods 
We resurveyed the permanently marked ridge-top 
stands in each climax region during 1996. The exact 
methodology used by Kooiman & Linhart (1986) was 
replicated to permit accurate comparison between the 
two surveys . We collected data on the frequency, abun­
dance, and percent ground cover of herbaceous plants 
in fifty plots measuring 85 x 100 cm at each ridge-top 
stand . An 85 x 100 m wooded frame, divided into 10 
equal cells, was positioned on top of every plot in each 
stand. These fifty plots were systematically located 
every two meters alternating to the left and right of a 
100 m surveying line. We recorded all species present 
in each cell and considered a species as present if it 
had one or more individuals rooted within the cell. 
In addition, we attempted to locate species encoun­
tered during the 1981 survey that were not present in 
the plots during the 1996 survey. We surveyed each 
stand at least twice a month throughout the growing 
season to detect species appearing at different times. 
Field work began in mid-May and continued through 
early September 1996, with a progressively later start­
ing date with increasing elevation due to the later 
persistence of snow cover. 
We conducted forest structure analyses at the pon­
derosa pine, Douglas-fir/ponderosa pine and aspen 
stands. A long thin plot of variable size, dependent 
on tree density, was overlaid on the existing sampling 
area used to study the herbaceous communities. A 
1000 m2 sample area was used for the ponderosa pine 
and Douglas-fir/ponderosa pine stands and a 400 m2 
plot was sampled for the aspen stand . Long thin plots 
have been shown to return consistently higher species 
richness values than the Whittaker plot and more ac­
curately reflect the total species richness recorded in 
a complete plant survey of an area (Stohlgren 1994). 
At each plot, all live and dead trees greater than 
4 ern diameter at breast height (dbh) were recorded 
by species and diameter. Seedlings and saplings were 
also recorded in each plot. Seedlings were defined as 
stems less than 1 m in height and saplings as stems 
greater than I m in height and less than 4 cm dbh. 
All stumps and fallen trees were recorded and iden­
tified to species within each plot. Additional notes 
of ecological data were also collected such as the 
presence of dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium vagina­
tum ssp. cryptopodum) and the type of seedlings and 
saplings growing under dead mature trees. Canopy 

3 
cover percentages were taken at each stand using the 
Buckner cover-point projector (Buckner 1985). Two 
hundred sampling points were taken within each stand 
to determine canopy cover. 
Data analyses 
We analyzed the structure of the herbaceous communi­
ties using identical parameters measured by Kooiman 
& Linhart (1986) to allow for comparison between 
1981 and 1996. These parameters included species 
richness, species diversity, species frequency, distri­
bution of frequency classes , and species composi­
tion. The Shannon-Weiner diversity index (Magurran 
1988) was used to measure diversity and species fre­
quency was determined based on the number of in­
dividuals within a plot. Voucher specimens for each 
species were collected and deposited in the University 
of Colorado Herbarium (COLO) . The Latin nomen­
clature follows Weber & Wittmann (1994, 1996). A 
list of all the species present during the 1996 survey is 
located in Korb (1997). 
Forest structure, density, and dominance were de­
termined using data recorded from the long thin plots 
in the lower three elevational stands. Stand struc­
ture was determined by dividing species into diameter 
classes based on 5 ern intervals . Relative density was 
calculated by dividing the number of individuals of a 
species by the total number of individuals within the 
plot. Relative dominance was determined by dividing 
the dominance of a species by the total dominance of 
all species within the plot. Dominance is defined sim­
ply as stem cover or basal area (Mueller-Dombois & 
Ellenberg 1974). 
Statistical analyses 
We calculated Spearman's rank correlation coeffi­
cients as nonparametric measures of association to 
determine the similarity in species composition of the 
herbaceous communities between 1981 and 1996. We 
included only species with frequency values of at least 
20% in these analyses. In addition, we calculated 95% 
confidence intervals for the Shannon-Weiner diver­
sity indices and individual species' frequency values 
to determine significant changes for these parameters 
between 1981 and 1996.

Rank correlation coefficients for the herbaceous 
species indicated that their was a significant rela­
tionship (p = 0.02) between the composition of 
herbaceous communities in the 1981 and 1996 surveys 
(Table I). Species richness and diversity indices re­
mained relatively constant (Table 2). The distribution 
of frequency classes was also comparable between 
the two surveys : a high percentage of the herbaceous 
species was present in frequency classes below 20% 
and a low percentage of the species was found in 
frequency classes above 40%. 
Significant changes for individual species were 
evident. Variation in frequency over time for individ­
ual species and turnover in species composition were 
evident between the 1981 and 1996 surveys (Appen­
dix A). Overall, the frequencies of herbaceous species 
in this community increased steadily in frequency per­
centages over time. Six species showed a minimum 
10% increase in frequency between the 1981 and 1996 
surveys. Two of these species, Anisantha tecto rum 
and Poa eompressa showed significant differences be­
tween 1981 and 1996 at the 95% confidence level 
(Appendix A). 
The species with the most dramatic change in this 
herbaceous community was A. tectorum, an exotic 
species that is abundant on disturbed ground (Weber & 
Wittmann 1996). Anisantha tectorum increased from 
10% to 62% between 1981 and 1996 (Appendix A). 
The forest structure of the ponderosa pine stand 
showed that Douglas-fir was the dominant tree species 
(dbh >4 em) within the stand in 1996. Douglas-fir 
had the highest relative density (58%) and highest rel­
ative dominance (80%) compared to other tree species 
present within the stand. Rocky Mountain juniper

(Sabina scopulorum) and ponderosa pine were similar 
for relative density and dominance values within the 
stand (Table 3). Douglas-fir represented 64% of the re­
generating individuals (seedlings and saplings), while 
ponderosa pine comprised only 9% of the regenerating 
individuals. In constrast, ponderosa pine represented 
90% of the non-regenerating individuals (stumps and 
fallen trees) for this stand. The total tree canopy cover 
for this stand was 12%. 
Douglas-fir/ponderosa pine stand at 2700 m 
The results from this stand were similar to the results 
of the pure ponderosa pine stand. Rank correlation 
coefficients for the herbaceous species at this stand 
showed their was a significant relationship (p = 0.02) 
between the composition of herbaceous communi­
ties between the 1981 and 1996 surveys (Table 1). 
Species richness and diversity indices remained rela­
tively constant (Table 2). The distribution of frequency 
classes for herbaceous species had a high percentage 
of species present in frequency classes below 20% and 
a low percentage of species found in frequency classes 
above 40% in both years . 
The greatest changes in this stand were the vari­
ation in frequency over time for individual species 
and turnover in species composition (Appendix A). 
Overall, frequencies of herbaceous species in this 
community increased in frequency percentages over 
time. Nine species showed a minimum 10% increase 
in frequency between the 1981 and 1996 surveys .

veys at the 95% confidence level (Appendix A). These 
two species showed the most dramatic change in this 
community with a 32% increase in frequency. 
Douglas-fir was the dominant tree species (dbh > 
4 ern) within this stand in 1996, similar to the pon­
derosa pine stand. Douglas-fir had the highest relative 
density (80%) and highest relative dominance (93%) 
compared to the other tree species present within the 
stand (Table 3). Ponderosa pine was the next most 
dominant species within the stand followed by lim­
ber pine (Pinus flexilis) . Ninety-seven percent of the 
regenerating individuals were Douglas-fir, with only 
three percent from ponderosa pine. The total tree 
canopy cover for this stand was 11%. 
Aspen stand at 3050 m 
This herbaceous community exhibited the most sig­
nificant change in comparison with the other three 
communities. Rank correlation coefficients for the 
herbaceous species illustrated that their was no signifi­
cant relationship (p = 0.20) between the composition 
of herbaceous communities in the 1981 and 1996 sur­
veys (Table 1). Similarly. there was no significant 
correlation (p > 0.05) for diversity measurements 
between the two years. In addition, there were large 
changes in species richness, frequency percentages 
for individual species, and a large turnover in species 
composition (Table 1 and Appendix A). 
The distribution of frequency classes for the herba ­
ceous species in 1981 and 1996 was similar to the 
results in the two lower elevation stands . However, the 
frequencies of herbaceous species in this community 
steadily decreased in frequency percentages over time. 
In both years, there was a high percentage of species in 
frequency classes below 20% and a low percentage of 
species above 40% . Twelve species decreased in fre­
quency by at least 10% between the two years (Appen­
dix A). In contrast, only two species, Calamagrostis 
canadensis and Carex foenea, increased at least 10% 
across the two surveys. Eight of these species showed 
significant difference between 1981 and 1996 at the 
95% confidence level (Appendix A). Lupinus argen­
teus and Taraxacum officinale exhibited the greatest 
change in this herbaceous community between 1981 
and 1996 with both of these species decreasing 46% 
between the two surveys (Appendix A). 
Aspen (Populus tremuloides) was the dominant 
tree species (dbh > 4 ern) within the stand. Live 
aspen had the highest relative density (41%) and high­
est relative dominance (32%) compared to the other 
tree species present within the stand (Table 3). Dead 
standing aspen was the next most abundant species 
with a relative density of 26% . Regenerating indi­

6 
viduals were dominated by subalpine fir (42%) and 
Engelmann spruce (37%). The remaining regenerat­
ing individuals were almost equally divided between 
lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and aspen. Total tree 
canopy cover for this stand was 84%. 
Kobresia meadow stand at 3750 m 
Changes in this herbaceous community were the least 
evident between 1981 and 1996 in comparison with 
the other herbaceous communities. Rank correlation 
coefficients for the herbaceous species indicated that 
there was a significant relationship (p = 0.001) be­
tween the composition of herbaceous communities in 
the 1981 and 1996 surveys (Table I) . Species rich­
ness and diversity indices remained relatively constant 
(Table 2) and there was only a small turnover in 
species composition. The distribution of frequency 
classes contrasted with those of the three lower ele­
vation stands. Overall, there was a lower percentage 
of species frequency classes below 20% than species 
in frequency classes of 40% or greater. Acomastylis 
rossii ssp. turbinata and Oreoxis alpina were the most 
prominent species at this stand across both surveys 
with frequencies of 98% (Appendix A). There was 
no general pattern for the frequencies of herbaceous 
species in this community, with about half the species 
increasing and half declining between the two surveys. 
Variation in frequencies of individual species oc­
curred between 1981 and 1996. Nine species increased 
in frequency by at least 10% between the two surveys 
and seven species decreased in frequency by at least 
10% (Appendix A). Six of these species showed sig­
nificant difference between 1981 and 1996 at the 95% 
confidence level (Appendix A). The species with the 
largest change in this herbaceous community between 
1981 and 1996 was Carex albonigra, which increased 
46% . 
Discussion and conclusion 
Ponderosa pine stand at 2200 m 
In 1961, Marr classified this stand as a sera] com­
munity that would eventually be an open park-like 
climax stand of ponderosa pine. He based this conclu­
sion on three types of evidence: the basic processes of 
succession, scientific literature pertaining to this type 
of stand, and the data from his study on the abun­
dance of ponderosa pine stumps and seedlings (Marr 
1961). The 1996 results for the ponderosa pine stand 
contradicts this successional trajectory suggested by 
Marr. Marr's prediction probably would have been 
fairly accurate if disturbance regimes (e.g., fire, insect 
outbreaks) in this area had remained constant. 
Fire has been recognized as an important natural 
disturbance that permits the continuous existence of 
open park-like ponderosa pine stands in the montane 
zone of the southern Rockies (Goldblum & Veblen 
1992; Hadley 1994; Peet 1988; Veblen & Lorenz 
1986, 1991). Human-set fires have been prevalent in 
the Front Range for as long as 8000 years (Benedict 
1975; Husted 1965). In the late 1860's, during the 
mining era of the Front Range, wildfires and logging 
were extensive as indicated through repeat photogra­
phy and stand age-structure data from forest studies in 
this region (Veblen & Lorenz 1991). Mining districts 
outlawed human-set fires in the late 19th century and 
since the 1920's fire frequency has greatly decreased 
(Veblen & Lorenz 1986). 
Fire suppression in this region has greatly influ­
enced changes in forest stand structure in the montane 
zone. For example, the shade tolerant Douglas-fir is in­
creasingly abundant in areas where previously, during 
the settlement era, seedling and saplings of this species 
would have been eliminated by surface fires (Hadley 
1994; Keane et al. 1990; Peet 1981). Consistent 
with this trend is the observation that the establish­
ment and regeneration of ponderosa pine seedlings and 
saplings has greatly decreased with fire suppression 
(Keane et al. 1990). We predict that a Douglas-fir 
steady-state stand with little presence of ponderosa 
pine and Rocky Mountain juniper will exist at this 
stand in the next fifty years if fire suppression per­
sists in the future. Another plausible trajectory for 
this stand is that a stand replacing crown fire will 
occur due to increased fuel loads that will allow for 
ponderosa pine reestablishment or another completely 
new successional trajectory. 
Douglas-fir/ponderosa pine stand at 2600 m 
Marr (J961) classified this stand as a sera I community 
that would eventually change into a stand composed of 
equal dominance of Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine . 
The 1996 results for the Douglas-fir/ponderosa pine 
stand were inconsistent with Marr's original hypoth­
esis. Similar to the ponderosa pine stand, Marr's 
successional trajectories may have been fairly accu­
rate if the natural disturbance regimes of this area had 
remained constant. 

Peet (1981) observed that fire suppression had 
resulted in an increase in Douglas-fir saplings and 
a decrease in ponderosa pine saplings in Douglas­
fir/ponderosa pine forests in the southern Rockies. He 
also detected an increase in fuel loads, which would 
potential Iy result in devastating fires and new succes­
sional pathways for similar stands (Peet 1981). We 
predict that a Douglas-fir steady-state stand with lit­
tle or no occurrence of ponderosa pine will exist at 
this stand if fire suppression continues to persist into 
the future. Limber pine will continue to senesce, as 
suggested by size structure analysis (Korb 1997) and 
the successional role of this species in this habitat. 
Low regeneration of ponderosa pine was present at this 
stand and alI evidence was highly infested with dwarf 
mistletoe suggesting that these seedlings and saplings 
will probably senesce. Similar to the ponderosa pine 
stand, a stand replacing crown fire could result in 
new successional pathways for this community if fire 
suppression activities persist in this area. 
Aspen stand at 3050 m 
Numerous studies have shown a gradual replacement 
of aspen and lodgepole by Engelmann spruce and sub­
alpine fir in the subalpine zone of the southern Rockies 
(Aplet et al. 1988; Peet 1981; Romme & Knight 
1981; Veblen 1986; Whipple & Dix 1979). Size 
structure analysis and historical past written records 
(Marr 1961) support that both aspen and lodgepole 
pine were early successional species at this stand. 
Specifically, stump evidence and the ages of aspen 
dated by Marr (1961) suggest that this aspen stand 
probably began development following a period of 
logging approximately 95 years ago. Our data sup­
port Marr's (1961) hypothesis that an Engelmann 
spruce/subalpine fir steady-state stand will exist in the 
future at this stand. Size structure analysis in 1996 
(Korb 1997) and well-known successional phases of 
subalpine forests (Parker & Parker 1983; Peet 1988; 
Veblen et a1.1991) suggest that aspen will continue to 
senesce and eventually die out. Likewise, the proba­
bility of a continued presence of lodgepole pine is low 
at this stand . 
Kobresia meadow stand at 3750 m 
The 1996 kobresia meadow stand results were consis­
tent with the successional trajectory suggest by Marr 
(1961) that this stand represented a dry meadow alpine 
climax community. However, similar to the two lower 
7 
elevational stands, Marr neglected to incorporate an­
thropogenic disturbances into his hypothesis for the 
successional trajectory of this stand. 
The alpine vegetation on Niwot Ridge has been 
studied in greater detail than any other alpine area in 
the Rocky Mountains (Billings 1988). Species com­
position at the kobresia meadow stand in the 1996 
survey was similar to the dry meadow community 
found on Niwot Ridge in other studies (May and Web­
ber 1982; Walker et al. 1994). A detailed study of 
the dry meadow community on Niwot Ridge indicated 
that interannual variation in the most limiting factors 
(i.e., low temperatures, high winds, short growing sea­
son, low nutrient availability, soil moisture) controlled 
the response of this community to changes over time 
(Walker et a1. 1994). 
Nutrient and water availability are the most lim­
iting factors that reduce plant biomass production of 
alpine tundra species in the southern Rockies (Bow­
man et al. 1993, 1995; Isard 1986; Walker et al. 1994). 
Nitrogen has often been cited as the most common 
nutrient limiting plant growth (Bowman et al. 1993). 
Over the past few decades in the Colorado Rocky 
Mountains, atmospheric nitrogen has increased six­
fold as a result of anthropogenic sources (Bowman 
et a1. 1995). This increase of nitrogen availability in 
dry meadow communities on Niwot Ridge may have 
dramatic long-term effects resulting in changes in in­
dividual species abundance and species composition 
(Bowman et al. 1993). 
Implications for determining successional trajectories 
The results of this study illustrate the importance 
for incorporating disturbance into successional trajec­
tories. Specifically, researchers need to understand 
that measurements characterizing a stand at one point 
in time represent a 'snap-shot' view of the ecosys­
tem and this information along with successional 
trends supported in the scientific literature do not 
necessarily represent the future trajectory for these 
ecosystems. Marr's hypothesized trajectories for these 
stands were based upon 'snap-shot' characterizations 
of the ecosystem and general successional pathways 
described for these communities in the scientific lit­
erature. Marr (1961) subscribed to the polyclimax 
theory of Tansley (1935) where there was more than 
one possible climax for a stand under similar climatic 
conditions. In addition, he also acknowledged that 
'All stands are dynamic internally; there are a myr­
iad of processes going on in every stand as long as 

8 
its exists; if they should cease, the stand would dis­
integrate, this fact is true of a climax as well as a 
successional stand' (Marr 1961). However, despite his 
recognition that ecosystems are dynamic, Marr failed 
to incorporate anthropogenic disturbances into his suc­
cessional trajectories that made his hypothesized suc­
cessional pathways for these communities unrealistic . 
We would argue that the role of disturbance is cru­
cial to understanding successional trajectories because 
successional endpoints may never be reached due to 
disturbance. Furthermore, disturbances can have dif­
ferent influences on a community depending on the 
scale, intensity, and frequency of the disturbance. This 
will then affect what species will occupy certain suc­
cessional habitats or even specific patches within the 
habitats resulting in a mosaic of diverse communities 
across the landscape (Bazzaz 1996). 
Long-term ecological studies 
Understanding the causal effects of anthropogenic 
influences on natural communities has gained great 
interest in the past few decades , which has led to 
an increase in the desire for investigators to conduct 
long-term ecological studies. However, because of 
lack of funding from granting agencies for long-term 
studies, time constraints and the need for individu­
als to continually publishing new work, almost 70% 
of field experiments span across two years or less 
(Tilman 1989). Therefore, it is crucial that individ­
ual investigators clearly document all components of 
their research so that cause-and-effect relationships in 
ecological studies can be interpreted properly when 
these studies are repeated over time even if the original 
study was not intended to be a long-term study. This 
will allow researchers to gain a greater insight into 
the natural ecological processes occurring in different 
systems and will allow the influence of anthropogenic 
disturbances on these systems to be better understood .
