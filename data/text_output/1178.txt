ABSTRACT 
Background. Wildfires often have long-lasting costs that are difficult to document and are 
rarely captured in full. Aims. We provide an example for measuring the full costs of a single 
wildfire over time, using a case study from the 2010 Schultz Fire near Flagstaff, Arizona, to 
enhance our understanding of the long-term costs of uncharacteristic wildfire. Methods. We 
conducted a partial remeasurement of a 2013 study on the costs of the Schultz Fire by updating 
government and utility expenditures, conducting a survey of affected homeowners, estimating 
costs to ecosystem services and updating costs to real 2021 US dollars. Key results. Costs 
associated with the Schultz Fire continued to accrue over 10 years, particularly those associated 
with post-wildfire flooding, totalling between US$109 and US$114 million. Suppression costs 
represented only 10% of total costs. Conclusions. This study is the first of its kind to include a 
remeasurement of wildfire costs and to provide a long-term assessment of the same wildfire over 
a 10-year period. Implications. Our results and lessons learned can help standardise 
approaches for full cost accounting of wildfire and illuminate the breadth of typically latent and 
indirect economic costs of wildfire such as post-wildfire flooding.  
Keywords: community wellbeing, ecosystem services, forest restoration, full cost of wildfire, 
net value change, post-wildfire flooding, risk mitigation, Schultz Fire, uncharacteristic wildfire. 
Introduction 
Wildfires often have long-lasting social and ecological effects that are difficult to docu­
ment and are not fully captured. Thus, an increasing area of research is concerned with 
documenting the full financial costs of wildfire, both in terms of suppression while the 
fire is burning, as well as the costs that continue to accrue long after the fire has been 
contained (Dale 2010; Troy et al. 2022). Full cost accounting after wildfires is critical for 
adequate government budgeting, post-wildfire resource allocation such as disaster recov­
ery assistance and understanding the full scope of wildfire to help communities learn to 
better live with fire (Schoennagel et al. 2017). Given the scant literature on this topic, 
exploring potential approaches to economic assessment presents an opportunity to initi­
ate conversations around consistent documentation after wildfires with varied outcomes 
and impacts. Furthermore, research suggests that the economic impacts of fire can last for 
years to decades; many of these costs have gone undocumented owing to the longevity of 
these impacts and challenges associated with accessing accurate economic data. As policy 
at the federal level in the USA increasingly demands the facilitation of resilient land­
scapes and fire-adapted communities, full cost accounting efforts after wildfire offer 
unique insights into the post-wildfire conditions that can support their development. 
The Western Forestry Leadership Coalition produced two major reports (Dale 2010;  
Troy et al. 2022) that describe and categorise the types of costs associated with wildfire, 
as well as present a framework to more systematically document wildfire costs. A recent 
Pew report also examines the effect of wildfire on state budgets (Foard et al. 2022). Other 
research has explored the costs of wildfire at different geographic and temporal scales.

For example, Thomas et al. (2017) examined various types 
of wildfire costs across the US, Headwaters Economics 
(2018) explored the costs of wildfire across communities,  
Wang et al. (2021) looked at wildfire costs within the state 
of California, and Baylis and Boomhower (2023) explored 
how home value is tied to fire suppression costs. However, 
we are not aware of published research that has comprehen­
sively tracked a broad range of costs over time for a single 
wildfire. Elevating economic examinations of fire to include 
this level of complexity is critical to advance more accurate 
understandings of post-wildfire costs. To that end, we pro­
vide an example for measuring the full costs of a single 
wildfire over time, using a case study from the 2010 
Schultz Fire near Flagstaff, Arizona, to enhance our under­
standing of the long-term costs of uncharacteristic wildfire. 
In 2013, following the Schultz Fire, an initial cost assess­
ment was conducted by Combrink et al. (2013), resulting in 
a technical report detailing a number of costs. With the 
benefit of this initial cost accounting and hindsight, we 
built on the previous study and documented the long-term 
economic costs of the fire and post-wildfire flooding over 
10 years that culminated in preliminary cost estimates in a 
recent white paper (Colavito et al. 2021). Our remeasure­
ment incorporated some of the methods and costs from the 
original study (Combrink et al. 2013) but offers updated 
costs based on a rearview mirror perspective. 
Literature review 
Tracking the costs of wildfires is critical for understanding the 
extent of damages and for compiling multiple data points to 
average wildfire costs across forest and community types. 
Furthermore, wildfire cost accounting can serve as a measure 
of economic efficiency when comparing costs of preventive 
treatments (e.g. forest restoration) with the costs of wildfire. 
Economic efficiency analysis of wildfire management started 
with ‘cost plus loss’ (C + L) models developed by Sparhawk 
(1925). Modern efficiency analysis of wildfire management 
has evolved to encompass ‘cost plus net value change’ 
(C + NVC), where ‘cost’ is a measure of wildfire suppression 
and pre-suppression expenditures and ‘net value change’ is a 
measure of monetary loss (or gain) resulting from wildfire 
damages such as the loss of structures or adverse human 
health effects (Gorte and Gorte 1979; Rideout and Omi 
1990; Donovan and Rideout 2003). Although the goal of 
C + NVC models is to minimise wildfire management spend­
ing and losses, understanding that suppression expenditures 
can affect the extent of damages, the model is a helpful way 
to conceptualise wildfire costs and damages. 
Wildfire suppression cost data are mostly straightforward 
to collect as they are widely reported. However, the ‘net 
value change’ component of wildfire cost minimisation 
includes a broad array of direct and indirect wildfire dam­
ages that are rarely tracked with consistency. Additionally, 
‘net value change’ implicitly allows for a loss or gain in 
monetised damages or benefits and does not assume that 
all change resulting from wildfire is ‘economically bad’ 
(e.g. Althaus and Mills 1982; Baumgartner and Simard 
1982). Characteristic wildfires of low and medium severity 
(depending on the natural fire regime) are historically natural 
and provide several ecosystem service benefits (e.g. tree 
regeneration, understorey enhancement, nutrient cycling). 
Wildfire can also reduce fuels, which can potentially save 
future suppression expenditures (Houtman et al. 2013), 
though some high-severity wildfires can lead to greater fre­
quency of wildfire. Financially quantifying ecosystem service 
benefits from wildfire is complex, leading most wildfire cost 
accounting research to focus on uncharacteristic wildfire, 
where fire severity is greater than traditional and more natu­
ral wildfire regimes, and ecosystem benefits are few. 
Thomas et al. (2017) provide a list of the ‘net value change’ 
categories associated with wildfire damages, or net losses 
from wildfire. They list eight ‘direct’ wildfire loss categories, 
or net losses directly related to wildfire such as deaths, loss of 
structures and loss of timber. For ‘indirect’ wildfire losses, 14 
categories are listed that represent net losses resulting from 
subsequent activities indirectly related to fire, such as post- 
wildfire flooding, housing market losses, utility disruptions 
and business impacts. In general, net wildfire loss and damage 
categories detailed in Thomas et al. (2017) are related to 
adverse impacts to human health, property (including infra­
structure), businesses and ecosystem services. 
Wildfire cost categories 
Aside from suppression and pre-suppression fire management 
costs, there are many direct and indirect wildfire costs. These 
wildfire costs have been estimated for a number of individual 
cost categories, especially for human health effects from wild­
fire smoke (e.g. Kochi et al. 2010; Jones 2018). Human health 
impacts from wildfire range from injuries to sickness to mor­
tality, due to exposure to fire, smoke, or post-wildfire flood­
ing. Adverse psychological effects due to increased fear of 
wildfire, evacuations and post-wildfire flooding also have 
economic costs on overall wellbeing and are typically trans­
lated using non-market valuation techniques (O’Donnell et al. 
2014; Ambrey et al. 2016). 
In terms of structure losses, Thomas and Butry (2012) esti­
mated that from 2002 to 2006, approximately 1250 US struc­
tures were annually damaged by wildfire, with an estimated 
loss of US$160 million. These numbers have skyrocketed in the 
last decade; reported incidents from the National Fire and 
Aviation Management Web indicate that since 2005, almost 
100 000 homes, businesses and other structures in the 
USA have been destroyed by wildfire (as reported by 
Headwaters Economics at https://headwaterseconomics.org/ 
natural-hazards/structures-destroyed-by-wildfire/). In 2017 
and 2018 alone, California wildfires caused billions of dollars 
in structure damages (Buechi et al. 2021).

Less understood are the damages to infrastructure and 
structures due to post-wildfire flood events that often occur 
well after the wildfire has been contained, such as damages 
to drinking water infrastructure (Jones et al. 2022). Risk 
assessments have shown that arid forested regions such as 
those near Flagstaff, Arizona, can have elevated post- 
wildfire flooding risk for a third of all structures and a 
quarter of all county facilities (Youberg et al. 2019). West- 
wide, this represents billions of dollars of structure and 
infrastructure at risk of post-wildfire flood damage. 
Market costs due to wildfire include disruptions to tour­
ism and outdoor recreation destinations (Otrachshenko and 
Nunes 2022), interruptions in general commercial activities 
due to damaged infrastructure and losses in real estate value 
due to perceived natural hazard risk and loss of aesthetics 
(Donovan et al. 2007). For example, Loomis (2004) and  
Mueller et al. (2009) employed hedonic property analyses 
and found that unburned communities adjacent to wildfires 
experienced house price declines ranging from 10 to 23%. 
Finally, ecosystem service damages from wildfire can 
range from losses in regulating services, such as reduced 
carbon sequestration and flood protection, to losses in pro­
visioning services such as timber production (Butry et al. 
2001). Vukomanovic and Steelman (2019) looked at how 
ecosystem services were affected by uncharacteristic wild­
fires and found largely negative effects. Environmental dam­
age caused by uncharacteristic wildfire, such as vegetation 
loss and soil damages, represents losses in supporting 
ecosystem services but also has indirect consequences on 
services like flood protection and the production of drinking 
water. Loss of associated wildlife habitat from wildfire, 
especially for threatened and endangered species, also 
results in substantial decreases in societal welfare as non- 
market values such as existence and bequest values for wild­
life are extensive. For example, Loomis et al. (1994) and  
Loomis and González-Cabán (1997) illustrated societal 
willingness to pay up to US$8 billion ($US 2021) for 
protecting spotted owls from uncharacteristic wildfire. 
Other cultural ecosystem services, such as heritage, spiritual 
and recreational values, can also be adversely affected by 
wildfire. In terms of recreation, research has demonstrated 
reduced economic demand and lost consumer surplus for 
recreationists in and near wildfire scars (Englin et al. 1996;  
Hesseln et al. 2004; Duffield et al. 2013). 
Total wildfire costs 
Although research on individual categories of wildfire dam­
ages is plentiful, there have been few published studies 
looking at total wildfire costs. Butry et al. (2001) examined 
the economic losses related to ‘catastrophic’ wildfires in 
northeastern Florida during the summer of 1998. Their wild­
fire cost accounting included damage estimates for suppres­
sion costs, disaster relief expenditures, timber losses, 
property damages, tourism-related losses and human health 
effects. Butry et al. (2001) found damages of at least US 
$600 million (over US$1 billion in 2021 $US), on par with 
damage estimates from level-2 hurricanes. 
Lynch (2004) estimated the total costs from two ‘cata­
strophic’ Colorado wildfires (Hayman and Bobcat Gulch 
Fires) in the early 2000s, finding broad costs beyond just 
those associated with suppression, property and human 
health effects, such as substantial habitat destruction to 
the 
threatened 
Pawnee 
Montane 
Skipper 
butterfly. 
However, Lynch (2004) notes that in the arid American 
West, long-term damage to forest watershed resources 
(such as damaged water supply infrastructure and post- 
wildfire flooding) may represent the largest, and least docu­
mented, costs of uncharacteristic wildfire over time. 
Recently, Wang et al. (2021) looked at the total wildfire 
costs in the state of California as a result of the 2018 wildfires. 
They estimated US$148.5 billion in economic costs for that 
single year, which included capital losses (19%), health costs 
(22%) and other indirect costs (59%). Meanwhile, Thomas 
et al. (2017) estimated the costs of wildfire across the entire 
US in 2016 to range from US$71.1 to US$347.8 billion. 
The literature on the costs of wildfires illustrates the 
breadth of cost types and the complexity in full-cost 
accounting of wildfire damages. It also highlights that the 
long-term and indirect damages of wildfire typically consti­
tute the majority of costs, yet the most-reported costs are the 
immediate suppression costs. It is important to note that 
costs of wildfires, or the economic burden (Thomas et al. 
2017), are incurred by various constituents ranging from 
individuals to industries to the taxpaying public at large. 
Methods 
We conducted a partial remeasurement of the Combrink et al. 
(2013) study on the costs of the 2010 Schultz Fire by: 
(1) remeasuring government and utility expenditures from 
2010 to 2019; (2) conducting another survey of affected 
households to understand long-term experiences and costs; 
(3) estimating costs to ecosystem services by conducting an 
economic valuation of Mexican Spotted Owl (MSO) (Strix 
occidentalis lucida) habitat impacts as a proxy; and (4) updat­
ing costs that were not remeasured from the original 2013 
study to account for inflation to 2021 dollars. Although we do 
not investigate general disruptions to businesses, such as the 
www.publish.csiro.au/wf

effect of the Schultz Fire on tourism and outdoor recreation,1 
we acknowledge additional market impacts not included in 
this study. We used costs for: (1) structural damage; (2) clean- 
up; (3) unpaid labour; (4) home contents; and (5) fire 
evacuation costs that were captured in Combrink et al. 
(2013) and updated to account for inflation to 2021 dollars. 
For loss of life, we followed the Environmental Protection 
Agency’s recommendation of using US$9.76 million for the 
value of a statistical life in real 2021 dollars (EPA guidance on 
mortality risk valuation available at https://www.epa.gov/ 
environmental-economics/mortality-risk-valuation). 
Study site 
The 2010 Schultz Fire was ignited by an abandoned camp­
fire on 20 June 2010, northeast of Flagstaff, Arizona, in 
Coconino County, and burned 6100  hectares. The Schultz 
Fire burned with uncharacteristic severity, resulting in sub­
stantial damage within the fire perimeter (USDA Forest 
Service 2010). Unlike wildfires that garner sustained 
media attention, the Schultz Fire did not burn any struc­
tures, nor did it result in immediate loss of life. Instead, the 
greatest damages and loss of life were a result of subsequent 
post-wildfire flood events that happened months and years 
after the fire and led to subsequent heavy flooding that 
impacted neighbourhoods downstream from the fire. One 
life was lost during the flooding events. Monsoonal storms 
continued to impact the area and produced flooding, though 
to a lesser degree, in subsequent years as flood mitigation 
projects were implemented in and around the burn scar. 
Flood mitigation projects began immediately in 2011 and 
were implemented every year thereafter through 2015, and 
again in 2019 as a result of damage from a 2018 monsoon 
storm that impacted post-wildfire infrastructure but was not 
tied to burn scar flooding. Because of the time lag that often 
occurs between wildfires and subsequent fire-related flooding, 
many of the costs associated with wildfire’s full effect are not 
included in initial cost assessments, leading to latent eco­
nomic damages from wildfires that are rarely documented. 
The original 2013 study area included the neighbourhoods 
downstream from the Schultz Fire burn scar and an estimated 
flood path. This provided coverage for all parcels that were 
affected at the time. In the remeasurement, the study area 
was expanded to include the entire projected 100-year flood 
risk area associated with the burn scar (Fig. 1). 
Data collection for government and utility costs 
The original Combrink et al. (2013) study provided a 
detailed accounting of government and utility costs, 
including fire suppression and flood response costs in 2010, 
flood mitigation costs from 2011 to 2012, and projected flood 
mitigation costs from 2012 to 2014. Engineering studies and 
flood mitigation projects began immediately following the 
fire and many were jointly funded by entities like the 
Coconino County Flood Control District and partners like 
the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service, 
Federal Emergency Management Agency, the US Geological 
Survey, the Arizona Department of Emergency and Military 
Affairs, the Natural Resource Conservation Service and the 
Federal Highway Administration. 
To collect updated government and utility costs, appro­
priate agency personnel from the City of Flagstaff, Coconino 
County, USDA Forest Service and others were asked to 
report all Schultz Fire and post-wildfire flood-related 
response and mitigation costs for specific calendar years. 
We compiled both the original costs from Combrink et al. 
(2013) and all subsequent costs as documented by govern­
ment and utility entities through 2019. We replaced the 
projected costs with reported costs and adjusted costs to 
account for inflation to 2021 dollars to calculate a total. 
We also reported the costs for individual flood mitigation 
projects across the study area, some of which took place on 
USDA Forest Service lands and others that took place in and 
around impacted neighbourhoods. Flood mitigation projects 
ranged from emergency watershed protection (EWP) proj­
ects such as check dams and sediment retention basins to 
box culverts and roadway realignments in neighbourhoods. 
Household costs and survey methods 
The Schultz Fire resulted in numerous household costs includ­
ing payments for residential flood mitigation, structural 
repair costs and decreases in home values due to diminished 
aesthetics and perceived hazard risk. Both short- and long- 
term financial consequences to residents in areas affected by 
post-wildfire flooding have gone largely undocumented. This 
is of particular concern because these costs can be high, 
ranging from out-of-pocket temporary relocation costs to 
structural repair. These costs can also vary depending on 
flood insurance coverage, level of flood risk to the property 
and proximity to burn scar and mitigation infrastructure. 
The majority of household costs can be ascertained by 
directly surveying affected residents (the primary exception 
being decreases in house sale prices). The original 2011 
survey of Schultz area households conducted by Combrink 
et al. (2013) received 321 responses out of a possible 1339 for 
a 24% response rate. We expanded this effort by sampling 
households in the projected 100-year flood event area in the 
fall (autumn) of 2020. That expansion represented an 
1Market impacts to industries from the Schultz Fire, such as tourism disruptions, are considered distributional economic impacts, where tourist 
expenditures are temporarily displaced from the Flagstaff region and are re-distributed to other comparable mountain towns. Research has shown 
that although some industries suffer during wildfires, total regional economic impacts can be positive owing to an influx of wildfire response teams 
and infrastructure services required to suppress fires (Davis et al. 2014). Distributional economic impacts are typically not included in efficiency, or 
cost–benefit, analyses and are a separate category of costs as compared with our reported government, utility, household and ecosystem costs.

improvement in model characterisation of potential flood risk 
for affected neighbourhoods. Our mixed-mode survey was 
administered to 1802 households, resulting in 407 completed 
questionnaires for a 22.6% response rate. 
We replicated numerous economic questions from the 
2011 survey instrument and expanded them further to inves­
tigate long-term household costs for this fire to better under­
stand how these expenses and experiences have evolved over 
the past decade. Our survey instrument included questions on 
several cost-related topics including property impacts associ­
ated with flooding, insurance claims, mitigation actions and 
upkeep, and other out-of-pocket costs, as well as the effects of 
the Schultz Fire on respondent wellbeing. 
Survey materials were mailed to households beginning in 
October 2020 and provided opportunities for both mail and 
online participation. Each household received materials in 
three phases following guidance from Dillman et al. (2014): 
(1) an introductory letter with information about the study, 
a questionnaire booklet and a pre-paid return envelope; 
(2) a postcard reminder 1 week later; and (3) a final reminder 
letter after an additional 2 weeks to incentivise responses 
from those yet to participate. For the full cost calculation, 
we extrapolated the reported survey responses for estimated 
costs to the entire study area. Using demographic informa­
tion and non-response bias testing, we determined that the 
survey respondents were representative of the entire study 
area, so we extrapolated costs for: (1) flood insurance costs; 
(2) insurance claims; (3) damages not covered by insurance; 
(4) preventative measure costs; and (5) upkeep of prevent­
ative measures. 
Some household costs, such as decreases in house sale 
prices due to the Schultz Fire, are difficult to determine with 
survey methods. The original cost assessment (Combrink et al. 
2013) estimated that the Schultz Fire led to assessed house 
value decreases of US$59 million, or 44% of total estimated 
costs, based on County Assessor values by affected neighbour­
hood for 2 years following the fire. However, a few years later, 
a spatially delineated, hedonic property analysis that exam­
ined the Schultz Fire effect on housing sale prices was con­
ducted by a team of researchers (Mueller et al. 2018). 
Estimating house value changes based on market price sales 
is more accurate than using assessed values. Likewise, hedonic 
models are the best way to assess important non-market attri­
butes associated with housing sale prices (Taylor 2003), such 
as proximity to wildfire or post-wildfire floods, leading us to 
incorporate the more conservative Mueller et al. (2018) esti­
mates into our total cost accounting.

wildfire are vast but are typically only documented if they 
result in losses for marketed commodities (e.g. timber 
losses) or require direct expenditures for mitigation 
(e.g. suppression and infrastructure costs). Lost commodities 
are generally easy to calculate because they have market 
prices associated with them. Tracking damages from wild­
fires that are related to non-market goods and services is 
more difficult and thus represents more latent wildfire eco­
nomic losses. 
Given the difficulty of calculating all potential non- 
market ecosystem service damages from wildfire (e.g. car­
bon losses, vegetation loss, water quality loss), we provide 
an in-depth examination of one primary service adversely 
affected by the Schultz Fire – forest habitat. Specifically, we 
investigated the economic damages associated with reduced 
habitat for the threatened and endangered MSO as a proxy 
for collective ecosystem service damages, understanding 
that this approach vastly underestimates total ecosystem 
service damages. We used a benefit transfer approach to 
apply spotted owl valuations from the literature to estimate 
the costs associated with the loss of 424.92 hectares of 
Protected Activity Center (PAC) area burned at high severity 
in the Schultz Fire. 
The Schultz Fire burned uncharacteristically, resulting in 
crown fires burning across three MSO PACs. Ecological 
monitoring over the last decade indicated that the Schultz 
Fire displaced existing owls but likely did not result in the 
immediate loss of owls (Shaula Hedwall, US Fish and 
Wildlife Service, pers. comm., 3 May 2021). Because we 
did not want to model the entire loss of MSOs or all their 
habitat, we needed to estimate the marginal cost of losing 
424.92 hectares of MSO PACs. Thus, total willingness to pay 
(WTP) estimates in the literature for protecting spotted owls 
from uncharacteristic wildfire were whittled down to be 
applicable to our study site (Montgomery and Adams 
1994). To estimate this cost, we employed benefits transfer 
methods where primary estimates from previous spotted 
owl valuations are transferred to the Schultz Fire and its 
MSO habitat reduction. Per-area WTP estimates were 
derived, and three types of benefit transfer were conducted: 
value unit, measure of central tendency and function trans­
fer. Conservative choices were made when choosing 
between model alternatives, leading to a likely underesti­
mate of the true WTP to protect MSOs from uncharacteristic 
wildfire. 
Results 
Government and utility costs 
We calculate an updated cost of US$72 392 991 over 
10 years for government and utility entities (Table 1). This 
represented an additional US$27 871 037 in expenses to 
government and utility entities from 2013 to 2019 that 
was not captured in the initial study (Combrink et al. 
2013). The suppression costs for the Schultz Fire amounted 
to over US$11 million in 2021 dollars, are captured in the 
first column of Table 1, and account for almost 16% of the 
total government and utility costs. 
Household costs 
In this section, we present the findings of the 2020 house­
hold survey, with the intent to provide a temporal compari­
son of economic implications for residents and capture 
undocumented 
long-term 
consequences 
to 
Coconino 
County households. Responses from both the 2011 and 
2020 surveys are compared wherever they are available. 
Respondents were demographically representative based 
on the most recent census data for this area. 
Flood insurance 
A total of 126 respondents (39%) self-reported that they 
had purchased flood insurance for their property in the 2011 
survey, contrasted with 69 respondents (17%) who reported 
that they still renewed flood insurance annually in 2020. 
A subset of 2020 survey respondents reported the annual 
cost to renew that insurance coverage; Table 2 shows that 
the cost of flood insurance among respondents has almost 
doubled in the past decade. 
Approximately one-third of 2020 survey respondents 
(n = 131) reported damage related to post-wildfire flooding 
since the Schultz Fire, a decline from the 45% (146 respon­
dents) who reported damage in the 2011 survey. This shift is 
likely related in part to resident turnover in the area. Only 
14 respondents to the 2020 survey made an insurance claim 
associated with flood damage or loss. Almost all respondents 
were underinsured; the average estimated cost of damage 
was ~US$23 285, but average compensation received was 
US$13 025. 
Approximately one-fifth (22.5%, n = 90) of respondents 
reported flood damage to their property at some point 
between 2010 and 2020 for which they did not file an 
insurance claim. These reported losses included debris or 
mud removal, landscaping, lost rental income, loss of pas­
ture for livestock, flooding in living areas of house and 
landscaping or fencing losses. The average cost of damages 
for which an insurance claim was not made was US$12 111, 
with a range of US$100 to US$75 000 (n = 76 respondents). 
Flood risk mitigation and costs on private 
property 
The cost of hazard mitigation on private property after 
fire is scarcely documented but represents significant out of 
pocket expenses for many affected households. Table 3 
reviews household costs for preventative measures across 
both the 2011 and 2020 surveys. The average cost of pre­
ventative measures on private property has increased

significantly since 2011. Additionally, the cost of upkeep 
for these preventative measures over the past 10 years has 
been substantial, with a mean cost of US$3620 (n = 37 
respondents). 
Effects of the Schultz Fire on wellbeing 
Although we do not attempt to monetise the impacts of 
the Schultz Fire on resident wellbeing, these costs have been 
quantified in other studies (e.g. Ambrey et al. 2016), and it 
is important to acknowledge that decreases in wellbeing 
associated with wildfire and post-wildfire flooding represent 
real and significant costs that may range from medical bills 
to unemployment. Negative outcomes for respondent well­
being were predominantly documented among those who 
lived in the area during the Schultz Fire. We found that 
18.9% of respondents moderately or strongly agreed that 
their mental health suffered as a result of the fire, with 
25.3% reporting experiencing significant levels of stress; 
12% moderately or strongly agreed that their physical 
health had suffered too. Approximately 8.3% of respondents 
reported that they had pre-existing health conditions that 
they reported were worsened by impacts associated with the 
Schultz Fire. 
Housing sale price decreases 
To estimate the effect of the Schultz Fire on housing sale 
prices, we incorporated detailed estimates from Mueller 
et al. (2018). They found a US$9.4 million aggregate loss 
for 528 houses that were sold after the Schultz Fire and 
located within 20 km of the fire perimeter. Additionally, 
they found a US$6.5 million aggregate loss for 351 houses 
that were sold after the Schultz Fire and located within 2 km

of post-wildfire flooding. Owing to separate methods and 
overlapping houses in the fire and flood perimeters, we 
cannot aggregate the two totals, but we do know that hous­
ing sale prices decreased at least US$9.4 million owing to 
the Schultz Fire. 
Ecosystem service costs 
Ecosystem service damages from the Schultz Fire manifest in 
a number of ways and are also included in other cost cate­
gories. In this section, we focus on a primary ecosystem 
service, economic costs of Schultz Fire damages to a threa­
tened species – the MSO – that can be used as a proxy and a 
minimum estimate of broader ecosystem service damages. 
Three types of benefit transfer were conducted to estimate 
Schultz Fire damages to MSO habitat. 
Unit value transfer 
Starting with the unit value transfer approach, we trans­
fer estimates from the one source study focused on MSO 
habitat protection. Loomis and Ekstrand (1997) found an 
annual mean WTP of US$66 per household (updated to real 
2021 US dollars) to protect MSO habitat and found a total 
annual WTP of US$3.3 billion when extrapolated to all US 
households. To realise marginal costs of the Schultz Fire 
impact, we calculated a WTP of US$1770 per hectare 
(Loomis and Ekstrand 1997) and applied this to the 
425 hectare MSO PAC loss, resulting in a societal welfare 
reduction of US$752 000. 
Measure of central tendency value transfer 
Synthesising multiple applicable source studies is another 
type of unit value transfer known as ‘measure of central 
tendency value transfer’ (Rosenberger and Loomis 2003). 
Without a specific valuation of WTP for MSO habitat and 
wildfire prevention programs, we synthesised four studies 
estimating WTP for protecting Northern and California 
Spotted Owl (NSO and CSO) habitat from intense wildfire 
(see Table 4). Per-hectare WTP values to protect spotted 
owls from wildfire were derived by dividing reported total 
WTP by the number of fire prevention hectares studied. 
Using the mean WTP of these four studies as the central 
tendency value, we found an average WTP of US$3798/ 
hectare to protect spotted owls from wildfires. Applied to 
the Schultz Fire, we find a total loss of US$1.614 million 
(US$3798/hectare ~ 425 MSO PAC hectares). 
Benefit function transfer 
For the benefit function transfer, we applied the WTP 
function from Loomis and González-Cabán’s (1998) study 
valuing fire protection for spotted owl habitat that illus­
trated how coefficients for explanatory variables (e.g. loss 
of area, importance of environmental quality) compose 
overall WTP. As their study was conducted in California, 
we adapted the WTP function to our study site, attaining 
equivalent metrics for Arizona for two of six explanatory 
variables (mean income and age). After adjusting to 2021 
dollars, we found a median WTP of US$82 per household, 
slightly lower than estimated in California. We conserva­
tively extrapolated median WTP to the Schultz Fire and 
found a WTP of US$1284/hectare with a corresponding 
total loss of US$546 000. Extrapolation of median Arizona 
WTP (US$82) accounted for a number of factors. We con­
servatively apply WTP to only 50% of households (Arizona 
and rest of the US), matching Loomis and González-Cabán’s 
(1998) response rate. We remove households below the 
poverty line and then extrapolate to remaining US house­
holds at 50% of our Arizona estimated WTP. 
Total costs 
Costs associated with the Schultz Fire continued to accrue 
over 10 years, although at a slower rate than during the first 
analysis. The total costs for the 10-year assessment period 
were conservatively estimated to be between US$109 and 
US$114 million in 2021 dollars (Table 5). Although not 
quantified, adverse effects to resident wellbeing also 
accrued over time and represent additional economic 
costs. When excluding property value reductions estimated 
in the original and final studies, and accounting for infla­
tion, there was a 29–35% real increase in the respective 
range of other costs from 2013. 
Government and utility entities bore the largest costs in 
the amount of US$73.4 million over 10 years. Coconino 
County and the USDA Forest Service experienced the largest 
costs. Most government and utility costs were incurred in 
the first 5 years following the fire, between 2010 and 2015, 
highlighting the decreasing costs over time as mitigation 
projects are completed. For the study area, we calculated 
individual costs from the household survey in the range of 
US$4.6–$6.6 million for insurance-related costs, which 
includes insurance premiums, claims and damages. We 
also calculated a range of US$3.4–$5.3 million for preven­
tion and mitigation measures, which includes initial costs

for the study area (Table 5). 
Discussion 
Our calculations of the costs associated with the 2010 
Schultz Fire highlight the longevity of wildfire and post- 
wildfire flooding costs. In our study, the costs for the 
Schultz Fire continued to accumulate over 10 years, 
although the costs incurred during and shortly after the 
fire due to flooding were larger than those in the subsequent 
years. It is important to note that our estimate is a conserv­
ative one, as we were not able to account for every potential 
direct and indirect ‘net value change’ category outlined by  
Thomas et al. (2017). We do capture both direct and indirect 
costs over time for which we have robust data, but our total 
cost figure surely underestimates the full cost of the 2010 
Schultz Fire and post-wildfire flooding. Indeed, recent wild­
fires that burned over the Schultz Fire footprint, including 
the 2022 Tunnel and Pipeline Fires, further demonstrate the 
ongoing, and now compounding, impacts of a single 
uncharacteristic wildfire. Our research provides one blue­
print for measuring costs associated with a single wildfire 
over time, as well as propositions for future research and 
monitoring to better estimate full wildfire costs moving 
forward. 
This study is unique and innovative for several reasons. 
First, this study is the first of its kind to include a remea­
surement of wildfire costs, which provides the opportunity 
to reevaluate approaches and learn from past work. Second,

this study provides a long-term assessment of the same 
wildfire over a 10-year period, which was only possible 
given that the first study provided a baseline of initial 
costs after a 3-year period. The longer time span for mea­
surement of costs also led to refinements, and in some cases 
reductions, in estimated costs such as affected house values 
and MSO habitat losses. Third, this study documents costs in 
multiple cost categories, whereas many other studies have 
focused on a single cost category, and provides costs for 
both social and ecological impacts related to the 2010 
Schultz Fire. 
Regarding considerations for documenting wildfire costs, 
we feel that valuable insights can be gleaned from our case 
study particularly related to the long-term nature of indirect 
wildfire costs. Thomas et al. (2017, table 1.3) classified 
direct and indirect wildfire costs, where direct costs include 
damages to human health, property and habitat directly 
occurring from the wildfire and indirect costs are all other 
costs that typically happen after the wildfire has been con­
tained. Using this dichotomy of wildfire costs, indirect costs 
of the Schultz Fire accounted for approximately 89% of all 
costs, as the majority of government mitigation efforts, loss 
of life and structural damages occurred from post-wildfire 
flooding as opposed to the initial wildfire. However, sup­
pression costs were estimated at 10% of total fire costs and 
lost MSO habitat (a direct cost) was estimated to be 1% of all 
costs. 
Fig. 2 illustrates the approximate timing of the indirect 
costs of the Schultz Fire, showing an exponential decay rate 
of approximately 14% over 9 years.2 If the Schultz Fire total 
costs had been reported after only 2 years, approximately 
half of all costs would have yet to occur. Thus, for any 
wildfires that may cause subsequent post-wildfire flooding, 
utility disruptions, or general community economic decline, 
indirect costs will persist for years following the fire and 
documentation of costs will need to be ongoing for some 
time. Uncharacteristic wildfire in communities with higher 
rates of population, structures and timber present than were 
affected by the Schultz Fire, and with less risk of post- 
wildfire flooding, will see greater direct costs that will be 
realised more immediately. 
In terms of minimising C + NVC, we hypothesise that 
fuel reductions and forest restoration (an increase in cost) 
would greatly reduce wildfire damages (NVC) as has been 
modelled as avoided wildfire costs in Colorado (Jones et al. 
2017; Jones et al. 2022), California (Buckley et al. 2014), 
New Mexico (Wildish et al. 2020) and Arizona (Huang et al. 
2013). A recent literature review by Hunter and Taylor 
(2022) documents a wide range of variability in benefits 
and costs of fuel treatments depending on location and 
project context. Forest restoration was planned within sig­
nificant portions of the Schultz Fire footprint but was not 
implemented prior to the fire. Treatment costs were esti­
mated to average US$3175/hectare for mechanical thinning 
and US$741.3/hectare for prescribed fire (Taylor et al. 
2015), for a total average cost of US$12.5 million. Based 
on our study of the Schultz Fire, we estimate a wildfire cost 
of $18224/hectare, or four-and-a-half times the proposed 
restoration costs. If restoration treatments were even 
moderately effective at reducing the Schultz Fire intensity, 
millions of dollars in wildfire damages could have been 
avoided. 
Conclusion 
This study documents the ongoing and long-lasting, yet also 
conservative, costs of a single wildfire. Given the trends of 
increasing wildfire severity and duration of fire seasons 
(Hessburg et al. 2021), combined with studies that have 
explored costs of wildfire across the nation (Thomas et al. 
2017) or looked at myriad costs of wildfire (Dale 2010; Troy 
et al. 2022), it is safe to assume the full costs of wildfire are 
vastly underrepresented and enormous. Additionally, as the 
Schultz Fire example demonstrates, a single fire often has 
many costs that are difficult to quantify and are temporally 
dispersed, such as costs to ecosystem services or community 
well-being. This further emphasises the importance of pro­
active fuel treatments and forest restoration work to reduce 
the risk of uncharacteristic fire and restore ecosystem health 
(Prichard et al. 2021). 
Several lessons emerged over the course of this remea­
surement. First, post-wildfire flooding, and the need for 
flood mitigation infrastructure, can occur for years after a 
wildfire. Our remeasurement captured an additional US 
$27 871 037 of government and utility costs that occurred 
for years after the Schultz Fire and after the initial study. In 
fact, the most expensive flood mitigation projects occurred 
5 years after the fire. Thus, there is a benefit to waiting for

3–5 years after a fire to understand the full costs of a single 
event. Additionally, by surveying affected residents a second 
time and after a decade, it was clear that household costs 
associated with the Schultz Fire continued to occur; addi­
tional analysis of survey data indicates that those engaged in 
collective action to address flood risk might have higher 
expenditures (Burnett and Edgeley 2023). Costs associated 
with household repairs and fire preparation continued to 
accumulate a decade later, though at a decreasing rate. 
Costs to wellbeing also continued for many years following 
wildfire. With respect to our ecosystem service calculation, 
the longer timeframe and ecological monitoring that 
occurred during that time afforded a more realistic picture 
of damage to MSO habitat, and thus, a more informative 
valuation of ecological damages due to the Schultz Fire. 
There are limitations from our example of the 2010 
Schultz Fire. We had to be opportunistic in using the costs 
that were available and quantifiable, so our example pro­
vides a broad-brush approach using the best available infor­
mation from our specific case. Furthermore, we could not 
collect cost information in all of the ‘net value change’ cost 
categories (Thomas et al. 2017), so our study provides a 
range of costs rather than a full accounting of all possible 
costs. Finally, wildfires can also result in ecological benefits, 
and we did not measure any potential benefits that may 
have resulted from the Schultz Fire, especially in the areas 
that did not burn at high severity and were long overdue 
for fire. 
There are many opportunities for future research on the 
full costs of wildfire. With limited research in this arena, 
additional studies documenting the full costs of a single 
wildfire over time are needed to provide enough informa­
tion to create a standardised approach for calculating the 
full costs of wildfire. Additionally, some categories of wild­
fire costs, such as reductions in resident wellbeing, are 
routinely overlooked and additional research is needed to 
advance techniques for measuring these types of social 
costs. Lastly, future research should investigate the benefits, 
or the amount of wildfire damages that could be avoided, 
associated with preventive treatments. A simple extrapola­
tion, as done under C + NVC modelling, illustrates that 
millions of dollars may have been saved by forest restoration 
treatments in key parts of the Schultz Fire perimeter before 
the fire. Research has clearly shown that forest restoration 
treatments in ponderosa pine forests result in overall lower- 
severity fires (Fulé et al. 2012), which lessens the intensity 
of subsequent post-wildfire flooding.
