This study evaluated the operational performance and cost of an integrated harvesting system that harvested sawlogs and biomass
(i.e., energy wood chips) in stand conversion clearcut operations. Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii) trees were processed into
sawlogs while whole trees of tanoak (Lithocarpus densiﬂorus), and sub-merchantable materials (small-diameter trees, tops and
limbs) were fed directly into a chipper to produce biomass for energy production. A standard time study method was used to
determine productivity and costs. Over 26 working days, the integrated system produced 1,316 bone-dry metric tonnes (BDTs)
of sawlogs, and 5,415.89 BDT of chips, with an average moisture content of 43.2%. Using the joint products allocation costing
method, the costs of the integrated system were $29.87/BDT for biomass and $4.26/BDT for sawlogs. Chipping utilization was
as low as 41%, directly aﬀecting production and cost of chipping operation. Single-lane, dirt, spur roads were the most costly
road type to transport whole trees to a centralized processing site: transportation costs for biomass and sawlogs were increased by
$0.08/BDT and $0.02/BDT, respectively, for every 50 meter increase in traveling distance. Diesel fuel price could raise total system
cost for each product by $0.78/BDT and $0.08/BDT for each $0.10/liter increase.
1. Introduction
On the north coast of California many once-commercially-
productive conifer stands are now over-run by tanoak
(Lithocarpus densiﬂorus), which sprouts from stumps, out-
competing merchantable conifer species. The transformation
in species dominance from conifer to hardwood was the
result of poor stocking success following earlier harvests.
More than 16,187 hectares on private industrial forest
land along the north coast of California are now classiﬁed
silviculturally as rehabilitation stands due to understocking
of conifers (<11.49 m2 of basal area per hectare; Figure 1) [1].
Converting stand composition through clearcut practices,
referred to as rehabilitation harvests, has been taking place
in northern California, but is expensive due to the large
volume of nonmerchantable forest biomass which needs
to be removed. If local bioenergy markets are available,
nonmerchantable biomass could be converted into an energy
wood product such as chips or hog fuel (i.e., ground woody
biomass). However, forest biomass is often underutilized
because collection and transportation costs are often greater
than the market value of the materials [2].
Bioenergy is the largest source of renewable energy in the
United States, with over 11 gigawatts of installed capacity [3].
Beckert and Jakle (2008) noted that 20% of all biomass used
for bioenergy comes from the forestry sector, but improve-
ments in the supply of feedstock is necessary to meet the
demands of today’s renewable energy development. Available
woody biomass in the forest is not often utilized because of
high costs associated with harvesting and transportation [4].
Improved knowledge on new and innovative systems used to
harvest and remove woody biomass would aid land managers
in the planning and execution of cost-eﬀective bioenergy
operations.
Integrated harvesting is deﬁned as a single pass harvest-
ing operation so that an energy component is produced in
conjunction with conventional sawlog assortments [5].
Research has shown that integrated harvesting systems can
be eﬀectively used to harvest and supply woody biomass

for energy from conventional forestry plantations [6]. In-
tegration of biomass harvesting into an active logging
operation could also reduce the cost of producing biomass
by utilizing the equipment on site for multiple products
and minimizing the amount of tree handling [7]. Since
integrated harvesting removes biomass with sawlogs in a
single pass, there is no need for a second operation to
clean up harvesting residues. Integrated harvesting systems
have been applied to fuel reduction thinning treatments
to reduce the threat of forest ﬁres. To reduce fuel loads
in high density stands, whole trees are felled and removed
to landings or roadsides where they are processed into
sawlogs and biomass. This approach facilitates slash disposal
without prescribed burning and increases opportunities for
the utilization of biomass for energy production. Costs of
integrated fuel reduction thinning operations have also been
shown to be economically feasible at $25.79/m3 for sawlogs
and $34.94/BDT for biomass [8].
There are a variety of site conditions which favor in-
tegrated biomass harvesting operations. First, the sites to be
harvested need to be readily accessible. Poor road surfacing,
tight turns, and adverse grades should be improved prior
to operations or avoided if possible. These conditions
contribute to longer round-trip transportation times and
higher transportation costs for vehicles with long lengths
or low ground clearance (e.g., chip vans, log trucks hauling
whole trees). Second, landing size at centralized processing
sites should be suﬃciently adequate for the ﬂow of incoming
material. If more than one harvest unit is storing material
to a centralized processing site, several hectares may be
required to store both biomass and sawlog products. Since
there are multiple tasks happening with various schedules,
centralized processing sites are often busy and need to
safely accommodate multiple machines working on site.
Addressing all of these conditions will aid in maximizing the
production of biomass for bioenergy cost-eﬀectively.
Delays are recognized as one of the major factors
that limit chipping/grinding productivity in an integrated
system and are an essential part of most time studies.
Chipping utilization has been reported in a study relating to
biomass harvesting operations at 73.8% [9]. Since utilization
rates are correlated with production rates, lower utilization
means lower daily production and higher unit production
costs ($/BDT). Ideally, one would aim to minimize chip-
ping/grinding delays when planning an integrated harvesting
operation, because it can be one of the most sensitive and
expensive components of an operation.
This study evaluated the operational performance and
cost of an integrated biomass harvesting system that har-
vested sawlogs and biomass (i.e., energy wood chips) in stand
conversion clearcut operations. Speciﬁc objectives for this
study were to determine the following.
(1) The hourly production rate for each stage of opera-
tion and the operation as a whole for both sawlog and
biomass components.
(2) The unit production cost for each stage of operation
and the operation as a whole for both products
($/BDT).
(3) The major factors that aﬀect the overall cost and
productivity of the integrated biomass harvesting
system.
2. Material and Methods
2.1. Study Sites. Three study units, with prescriptions for
stand rehabilitation harvest, were located on private indus-
trial forestlands in northern California. The composition of
the three units ranged from 45 to 82% tanoak, 0 to 7%
madrone (Arbutus menziesii), and 18 to 48% young growth
Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii), with slopes ranging
from 0 to 45% (Table 1). The three stands ranged from six
to nine hectares in area and were classiﬁed as understocked
conifer stands (<11.49 m2/ha basal area of conifer stocking),
except for Unit 2 which averaged 40.18 m2/ha basal area of
conifer stocking. Study units were cruised prior to operations
with a systematic sampling grid (31.7% of the total harvest
area) of 0.08 ha per plot, with a minimum of two plots per
hectare. Trees larger than 12.7 cm in diameter at breast height
(DBH) were recorded at each plot and used to estimate the
preharvest stand volumes and average tree size.
All three units were clearcut with a mechanized ground-
based shovel logging system. The integrated system utilized
one Timbco T445D feller-buncher to cut and bunch whole
trees at the site. Two Komatsu PC300 log loaders (Komatsu
1 & Komatsu 2; Figure 2) were used to swing (i.e., shovel)
bunches of whole trees to the roadside. Both loaders took
turns loading roadside bunches of logs, whole trees, and
tops onto two log trucks for transportation to a centralized
processing site (Figure 2). The whole trees and residues
delivered to the centralized processing site were immediately
unloaded by another Komatsu log loader (Komatsu 3;
Figure 2) which was equipped with a grapple saw, and
worked with a remotely controlled pull-through delimber.
The Komatsu log loader used for unloading was then also
used to process sawlogs and sort nonsawlog (i.e., biomass)
trees and residues for chipping.
All materials to be chipped were grappled by an adjacent
Linkbelt 3400 swing loader and fed into a Morbark disk
chipper. Chips were blown into a large pile on the ground,
and then loaded by a Cat 962 G front-end loader into

13.72 m long chip trailers. The trailers were transported by
two wood chip trucks, and staged approximately 6.5 km away
at a trailer yard near the highway where many trailers were
stored for further transportation to an energy plant 45.7 km
away (Figure 3). Loaded trailers were traded at the yard for
empty trailers and returned to the central processing site
immediately in order to keep the chipper busy. A trucking
company was hired to deliver the trailers from the trailer yard
to the power plant, which took nearly two hours for a round
trip at 45.7 km one-way distance. The staging of chip trailers
at the trailer yard was necessary due to the limited space
available at central processing sites. Sawlogs that were sorted
and processed by the loader were decked at the centralized
processing site, which loaded onto log trucks and delivered
directly to the sawmill from the centralized processing sites
more than 124 km one-way distance.
2.2. Measurement Protocol. Hourly machine costs in dollars
per scheduled machine hour ($/SMH) were calculated using
standard machine rate calculation methods [10]. Delays were
deﬁned as all activities that do not directly contribute to the
production of the operation. Purchase prices, salvage values,
and all other necessary information for the standard machine
rate calculation were obtained from the contractors who
owned the equipment. Diesel fuel prices were determined
from local market prices eﬀective during the study period. All
machinery was assumed to have a 10-year economic life and
work 1800 scheduled machine hours (SMHs)/year, except for
the chipper which had a ﬁve-year economic life due to its
extensive use.
Costs of each stage of operation and the operation as a
whole were determined using the joint products allocation
method [11]. Under this method, all stages of operations
that produced both biomass and sawlogs apportioned their
costs based on the contribution of each product to the
total production. Costs associated with operational stages
that produced a single product in its ﬁnal form, or that
only handled one product type, were charged solely to that
product (e.g., chipping, loading sawlogs).
Activity sampling at the central processing site was
observed over four of the 26 days of operation, sampling at
ﬁxed intervals of time (i.e., every 15 seconds for one hour,
three times a day), to determine whether machines were
working or not. Activity sampling data were collected over
a relatively short period and were used to provide a glance
at how well the machines and processes were matched at
one particular centralized processing site. Through activity
sampling, a better understanding could be gained of appro-
priate system balance by calculating individual machine
utilization rates (ratio of PMH to SMH). Working at the
central processing site was the Komatsu loader (Komatsu 3)
which unloaded whole trees, sorted and delimbed trees, and
loaded log trucks with saw logs. An adjacent Link Belt loader
was used to feed biomass trees into the chipper, and the
resulting chips were loaded into chip trailers with a front-end
bucket loader.
Elemental time-motion data were recorded by a stop
watch for each machine’s cycle used in the harvesting system
[12]. Cycle data were recorded for 10 hours a day, alternating
between harvesting activities for a total of 26 working
days. Regression equations were developed using Minitab
15 Statistical Software [13], through ordinary least squares
estimators. To predict a machine’s delay-free cycle time,
average observed values for independent variables in the time
study were entered into the developed regression equations.
The following describe cycle elements for each harvesting
activity phase.
(i) Felling/bunching started when the machine rotated or
traveled empty to a tree followed by the cutting of
the tree, then the machine rotated while loaded, and
placed the tree in an existing pile or bunch, ending
the cycle.
(ii) Shoveling (i.e., swinging logs and whole trees to road-
sides) started when the machine rotated or traveled
empty to a pile/bunch of trees, grappled the trees,
rotated loaded to a new pile/bunch or road side,
and ended when the machine dropped the trees or
compacted them into another pile/bunch.
(iii) Loading (whole trees) started when the machine
rotated or traveled empty to a pile/bunch of trees,
grappled the trees, rotated loaded to the log truck,
and ended when the trees were compacted onto
bunks of the log truck.

(iv) Hauling (whole trees) began when the truck traveled
loaded along various roads to the central process-
ing location, where it was unloaded, then traveled
unloaded back to the harvest unit, and ended when
the truck was ﬁnished being loaded with trees.
(v) Unloading at the centralized processing site started
when the loader swung empty to the log truck,
grappled the trees, rotated loaded to a pile/bunch of
trees, and ended when the machine dropped the trees
into a pile/bunch of trees.
(vi) Sorting/processing (sawlogs) started when the ma-
chine rotated empty toward the pile/bunch of trees,
grappled the tree, followed by the tree being delimbed
and or bucked/topped, rotated loaded to a pile of
trees/logs, and ended when the tree/logs were placed
on the pile.
(vii) Chipping started when the trees/tops were placed on
the chipper’s in-feed table and ended when the last
chips dropped from the chipper’s out-feed shoot.
(viii) Loading (biomass) started when the loader traveled
empty to the pile of chips, followed by the chips being
scooped into the loader’s bucket, traveled loaded to
the chip trailer, and ended when the last chips fell into
the trailer from the loader’s bucket.
(ix) Loading (sawlogs) started when the loader rotated
empty to the deck of logs, grappled the logs, rotated
back to the truck loaded, and ended when the loader
placed the logs onto the truck’s log bunks.
(x) Hauling (biomass chips) began when the truck trav-
eled on in-woods roads to the trailer yard adjacent
to the highway, unloaded the trailer, picked up an
empty trailer, traveled back unloaded to the central
processing site, and ended when the replacement
trailer was ﬁlled with chips.
Average piece size for whole trees was calculated from
preharvest stand cruise data, and scaled weights of chips
(biomass) and sawlogs delivered to markets. The number
of stems per hectare for each species at each harvest site
was summed and divided by the scaled weights to calculate
average tree weight. Samples of chipped material were
collected in the morning, afternoon, and evening over four
days of operation and dried in a laboratory oven to determine
their moisture content, which was used to convert green
tons to bone dry tons. The average tree weight was then
converted to dry tons using moisture content data collected
on site [14]. Moisture content was then used to predict
the productivity in bone-dry tons (BDTs) for each process
(felling, shoveling, loading, hauling to the central processing
site, unloading/sorting, and chipping) of the operation that
handled whole trees. The average volume and weight per tree
removed was 0.66 m3 or 0.35 BDT. Chipped biomass weight
was tracked by scaling ticket books from the local energy
plant for every load. Log truck volume was tracked by ticket
books obtained from the sawmill for every load, and both
were averaged throughout the study.
Production rates (BDT/PMH) for each process were
calculated using the delay-free cycle equations that were
developed using detailed time study data. Average delay-free
cycle times were estimated by entering average values for
independent variables associated with a given cycle element
into delay-free cycle equations to determine the PMH per
cycle. The average number of trees recorded during the
detailed time study was converted to BDT. Then weight per
cycle was divided by the delay-free cycle time (PMH) to yield
a production rate (BDT/PMH).
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Productivity of the Integrated Harvesting System. The
integrated system was monitored for 260 SMH over 26
working days during the summer of 2008. Throughout the
study period, the system delivered 1,316 BDT of Douglas-ﬁr
sawlogs and 5,416 BDT of wood chips, which had an average
moisture content of 43.2%. The total system production rate
was 35.26 BDT/PMH, determined by the individual process
with the lowest production rate (i.e., hauling chips).
The hauling of chips from central processing sites to
the trailer yard yielded the lowest production of all stages
of operations. A hauling cycle for chips took 43.9 minutes
per round trip (Table 2). Round-trip times were highly
inﬂuenced by traveling speeds associated with diﬀerent road
types. The distance in meters of single-lane dirt and spur
(temporary road with unimproved surface) roads within the
harvest unit were the variables that had the greatest eﬀect
on cycle time. The productivity of hauling whole trees from
the harvest areas to the centralized chipping location (36.51
BDT/PMH), and for hauling chips from the centralized
chipping area to the trailer yard (35.26 BDT/PMH), was the
lowest of all phases of operation. Low production rates for
hauling were most likely due to the slow traveling speeds
observed on narrow forest roads (11 to 32 km/hr), and the
long round trip distance of 2.80 km and 13 km for whole
trees and chips, respectively.
The highest rates of production were achieved through
the unloading of whole trees at the centralized processing
sites. An average unloading cycle took only 3.46 minutes per
truck (Table 2). The average production rate for unloading
trees at the centralized processing site was 171.36 BDT/PMH.
The unloading of trees was most inﬂuenced by the number
of grapples to lift the materials oﬀthe truck and the number
of degrees that the machine rotated from the truck to the log
deck. This rate was substantially diﬀerent from the loading
of trees (73.42 BDT/PMH) because it took less handling to
remove a tree from the trucks than to carefully arrange them
on the truck.
Activity sampling results indicated room for improve-
ment in operational eﬃciency by balancing productivity
between processes at one of the central processing sites.
Again, this was based on only four days of sampling and
may not be representative of the entire 26 days of operation.
However, the sampled utilization rates are interesting to note
as they show the potential changes in cost and production
with relation to utilization rates. During activity sampling
the chipper had an average utilization rate of 41%, but at
times was as high as 100%. This translated to a low utilization

rate of 49% for the loader (Linkbelt) which fed the chipper
and 43% for the front-end loader which loaded the chips into
trailers, because these machines were dependent upon one
another. The Komatsu loader (Komatsu 3) had the greatest
utilization rate (74%) at the processing site, because the
machine had three tasks of unloading, sorting/processing,
and loading sawlogs. Log trucks hauling whole trees were
utilized to nearly their full potential (96%) which indicated
the need for an additional log truck to keep the processing
site busy. However, introducing another log truck into the
system would require additional feller-bunchers and loaders
at the harvest unit to keep up with trucking over the short
round trip hauling distance of 2.80 km. Hauling of biomass
chips had a relatively low utilization rate (69%) which
was primarily a result of low productivity (BDT/PMH) of
chipping. If chipping production was to increase, additional
trucks would be needed for the long round-trip cycle (43.87
minutes) (Table 2) from the processing site to the trailer yard
adjacent to the highway.
3.2. Costs for Harvesting Both Sawlogs and Biomass . Machine
rates, production rates, and production costs for each stage
of operation, and the operation as a whole, are summarized
in Table 3. The total hourly system cost of running all
the machines used in the integrated harvesting operation
was $1,936.76/PMH, which included ownership, operating,
and labor costs. When applying production rates for each
harvesting process, the most expensive system process was
found to be chipping ($9.94/BDT). This was due to the
low production rate (47.18 BDT/PMH) in relation to the
high machine rate ($468.78/PMH) for two machines: the
chipper and the loader that feeds it. Using the joint products
allocation method, the total unit production costs from
the integrated system were $29.87/BDT for biomass and
$4.26/BDT for sawlogs. These total system costs do not
include the costs associated with supporting machinery (fuel,

Machines used throughout system processes were all
assumed to have a utilization rate of 85% as suggested
by Miyata (1980) [10]. Activity sampling at one central
processing site was used to demonstrate how these utilization
rates can change by site or when system balance is not ideal.
For example, the observed utilization rate for chipping, as
indicated through the four days of activity sampling, was

41%. The low observed utilization rate would translate to
reduced production and higher costs than those calculated
in Table 3. Figure 4 shows the possible production rates and
costs of chipping if the machines involved were operating
at utilization rates of less than 85%. The linear relationship
between production and utilization rate should be noted.
Increasing the utilization rate by only 10% can raise chipping
production by 5.55 BDT/SMH. The relationship between
cost and utilization rate, on the other hand, is quite diﬀerent;
chipping costs were as low as $9.94/BDT when utilization
was 85% and as high as $20.60/BDT when utilization rates
fell to 41%. In this sensitivity analysis, more than $1/BDT
for every 5% increase in chipping utilization rate could be
saved, until the rate reaches 70%. Thereafter, the savings
would be less than $1/BDT. Having a high utilization rate
is important since chipping is one of the most expensive
stages of operation, and because production in any following
stages of operation is often inﬂuenced by chipping. Having
a high utilization rate will also increase productivity and
reduce costs, saving money for the other stages of operation
like collection and transportation. It is ideal to maximize
utilization rates of all machines and processes involved in
integrated systems. Potential savings could be as high as
$32.05/BDT for biomass and $4.58/BDT for sawlogs, if all
machines in the system operated at a balanced utilization rate
of 85% compared to 41% observed during activity sampling
(Figure 5).

Transportation of whole trees on log trucks yielded one
of the lowest productivities of all stages of operation that
handled both products 36.51 BDT/PMH and was the most
expensive stage of operation for the production of sawlogs
($1.16/BDT) (Table 3). This was due to low traveling speeds
on forest roads (<12 km/hr) caused by poor road conditions,
including rough road surface with no gravel, single lane road
width, steep road grades, and sharp curves. In this study, the
average round trip distance was only 2.80 km but took 32.5
minutes without delays.
There was a noticeable relationship between whole tree
hauling costs and whole tree one-way hauling distances with
relation to road type. Every 50 meter increase of spur road
was proportional to a $0.08/BDT and $0.02/BDT increase in
the cost of hauling for biomass and sawlogs, respectively. It
should be noted how the increased use of mainline (two-
lane gravel road) or one-and-a-half lane width improved
dirt roads in proportion to spur roads can reduce total
hauling costs. This relationship between reduction of cost
with increased mainline road distance was due to the higher

traveling speeds (26 km/hr) observed along higher quality
road types.
Diesel fuel prices reached a peak at $1.21/liter in the
region during the course of operations in the summer of
2008 and then steadily declined to $0.66/liter six months
after commencement of operations. Fuel costs had a greater
inﬂuence on cost per unit of product in an integrated
harvesting operation, due to the high fuel consumption
rate of machinery. The integrated harvesting operation in
this study consisted of 11 machines, including the chipper
which had the greatest fuel consumption rate of 113
liters per hour. Holding all other variables constant, every
$0.10/liter increase in fuel price is equivalent to an increase
of $0.78/BDT and $0.08/BDT in total system production cost
for biomass and sawlogs, respectively (Figure 6).
4. Conclusion
During 26 days of operations, the integrated harvesting
system produced and delivered 1,316 BDT of sawlogs and
5,416 BDT of chips, with an average wet-based moisture

content of 43.2%. The total cost for the integrated system was
$1,936.76/PMH and produced Douglas-ﬁr sawlogs at a cost
of $4.26/BDT, while chipping nonmerchantable size material
and species into energy wood chips at a cost of $29.87/BDT.
Hauling chips to the trailer yard adjacent to the highway was
the least productive stage of the entire operation at 35.26
BDT/PMH. The highest rates of production were achieved
through the unloading of whole trees at the centralized pro-
cessing sites. Round trip transportation distances averaged
2.80 km for hauling whole trees from the harvest units to the
centralized processing sites, and 13.0 km for hauling biomass
chips from the centralized processing sites to the trailer yard
adjacent to the highway. Loaded trailers were traded at the
trailer yard for empty trailers, which were then transported
to a local energy plant approximately 45.7 km away by a
contracted trucking service.
The results of activity sampling indicated some room
for improvement in balancing productivity between compo-
nents in the integrated harvesting system. There were four
machines working simultaneously at the processing, but not
all machines were working at the same production rate.
The most expensive process of chipping ($468.78/PMH) was
found to have a utilization rate of only 41% during activity
sampling. Ideally, machines should be paired to adjacent
operational phases and machinery with similar production
rates in an attempt to maximize their individual utilization
rates. This can increase potential productivity and decrease
production costs.
Sensitivity analysis evaluated how machine utilization
rates, road hauling distances, and diesel fuel costs can aﬀect
system costs. Raising the utilization rate of the chipper by
only 10% is equivalent to a 5.55 BDT/PMH increase in
production. Every 5% increase in utilization results in a cost
savings of $1/BDT, until 70% utilization, where it decreases
thereafter. Transportation costs were found to be the most
expensive stage of operation, which is correlated with hauling
distance and road quality. Ideally, the use of single-lane dirt
spur roads should be minimized due to their slow associated
travel speeds, with every 50 meters producing a $0.08/BDT
and $0.02/BDT increase in hauling cost for biomass and
sawlogs, respectively. Diesel fuel prices are often overlooked
in harvesting operations but can have a substantial eﬀect on
total system production cost. This is especially true when
using a chipper, which consumes more than 113 liters/hr.
Each 10 cent increase in diesel fuel price per liter represents a
$0.78/BDT or $0.08/BDT increase in total system production
cost for sawlogs and biomass, respectively.
Careful planning of integrated harvesting systems, such
as this one, should take into account conditions between
harvest units and processing sites, and appropriate pairings
and number of machines, in order to maximize production.
System balance is essential in order to match production
levels of diﬀerent system processes, thereby minimizing con-
gestion and improving eﬃciency. These concepts are typical
of most operations but become especially important during
integrated harvests, due the large amount of personnel and
machinery in use, the dependency of operational phases, and
the complexity of producing more than one product.
The integrated harvesting of biomass and sawlogs in
stand conversion operations was cost-eﬀective. Previously
understocked conifer stands with large nonmerchantable
hardwood components were removed and planted back to
productive conifer stands. Forest residues were successfully
removed without prescribed burning. Additionally, costs
associated with the biomass harvesting operation were
minimized by best utilizing machinery on site to produce
both biomass and sawlog products. Finally, the most exciting
outcome of the stand conversion operation and integrated
harvesting system was the clean renewable energy produced.
The nearby biomass power plant converted the wood chips
into electricity, which supplied homes and businesses across
the region.
