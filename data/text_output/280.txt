Genetic Considerations for Restoring Forests of the  
Southwest After Severe Disturbance 
 
By Jessica Ouzts and Thomas Kolb, PhD  
INTRODUCTION 
Climate change models predict increases in temperature and more frequent severe droughts and forest fires in 
the Southwest United States (Garfin et al. 2013). Aridity stress to forests caused by climate change will be 
especially severe in forests and woodlands of the Southwest because productivity is already strongly limited 
by low precipitation and humidity (Williams et al. 2013). Intense drought predisposes trees to disease and 
insect attack, such as bark beetles that have killed many trees in the Southwest in the last two decades (Raffa 
et al. 2008, Gaylord et al. 2013). Climate warming and fuel buildups in the Southwest are increasing wildfire
-caused deforestation (Williams et al. 2010, Williams et al. 2013). There is a high risk of conversion of pon-
derosa pine forests to grassland or shrubs when intense burning, drought, or bark beetles cause high tree mor-
tality, create large openings, and kill local tree seed sources (Roccaforte et al., 2012). Future increase in 
drought intensity caused by climate warming will reduce opportunities for ponderosa pine regeneration after 
deforestation (Savage et al. 2013). Moreover, climate-envelope models predict substantial shrinking of the 
range of ponderosa pine in the Southwest over the next century, especially at low-elevations (Rehfeldt et al. 
2014).  
 
Active reforestation by tree planting is being con-
sidered to promote recovery of southwestern for-
ests following deforestation. Planting can help 
perpetuate forest cover that is required on Nation-
al Forest lands, as mandated by the National For-
est Management Act of 1976. It can also promote 
carbon sequestration, clean water, and other for-
est benefits. Tree planting provides an opportuni-
ty to actively mitigate the negative impacts of 
climate warming on forests by establishing tree 
genotypes that are better adapted to warming and 
aridity than current populations (Marris 2009, 
Williams and Dumroese 2013). There is increas-
ing evidence that tree populations located at low elevations or southern, dry edges of species ranges will be-
come maladapted to local climate during the next century (Rehfeldt et al. 2014). Recent reports of range con-
traction at southern and low-elevation edges of tree species distributions strongly suggest that this maladap-
tation is already occurring in some regions (Allen and Breshears 1998, Lavergne et al. 2010, Fellows and 
Goulden 2012). 
 
The purpose of this fact sheet is to explain the need for using emerging knowledge about climate change and 
tree genetics to guide post-disturbance restoration of ponderosa pine in the Southwest.

STATE OF KNOWLEDGE 
 Current tree planting on southwestern federal lands after intense 
burning (195–1,560 acres year-1) is small compared with estimated 
needs of 140,000 acres as of 2014:   
 
Most plantings are conducted by hand at densities from 100–
560 trees acre-1 on a relatively even-spacing. 
 
Seed is gathered from local seed zones established by Schu-
bert and Pitcher (1973). 
 
Planting of non-local species and populations is currently dis-
couraged. 
 
Planting sites are selected according to need (typically areas 
with less seed source), accessibility (often closer to roads), 
and funding. 
 Genetic selection for planting:  
 
Natural selection has produced populations that are pre-
adapted for future arid sites in other conifers, such as Aleppo 
pine (Taibi et al. 2014), Douglas-fir (Bingham and Simard 
2013), and lodgepole pine (Marris 2009). 
 
Past recommendations to use local seed sources of ponderosa 
pine for planting in the Southwest (DeWald and Mahalovich 
2008) were based on tests of widely separated geographic 
sources planted almost a century ago during cooler, wetter 
periods. 
 New recommendations for southwestern ponderosa 
pine call for the use of non-local arid-adapted geno-
types in reforestation projects. For example, planting of 
populations from elevations 1,500 feet lower in eleva-
tion than the planting site is recommended to provide 
the stand with genotypes better adapted to climate in 
2060 (Rehfeldt et al. 2014). 
 New recommendations are consistent with well-
documented evidence for genetic differences among 
pine populations located at different elevations and soil 
types within a region (Cobb et al. 1994, Rehfeldt 1993, 
Rehfeldt et al. 2014). These genetic differences within 
a region, also termed fine-grained genetic adaptation, 
suggest the current existence of populations that are pre
-adapted for the more arid environments that will occur 
in the future. 
 Fine-grained genetic variation in aridity adaptation is 
likely in southwestern ponderosa pine because of the 
wide range of elevations, mean annual temperatures, 
and soil types where the species currently grows 
(Figure 1). 
 
 
Figure 1: Ponderosa pine forests 
in northern Arizona occur at ele-
vations ranging from 5,500 to 
9,500 feet, mean annual tempera-
tures between 42 and 55 degrees 
Fahrenheit, and soil types derived 
from several parent materials that 
differ in water availability. 
Low-elevation cinder 
Low-elevation basalt 
Low-elevation sedimentary 
Mid-elevation basalt 
High-elevation basalt 

 Research needs:  
 
More investigation of genetic variation in aridity adaptation in southwestern ponderosa pine is 
needed to advance the use of genetic approaches as a strategy for mitigating climate change 
impacts.  
 Older field common-garden comparisons of broadly distributed seed sources need to 
be supplemented by short-term common-garden experiments in environments de-
signed to evaluate impacts of climate change. 
 New experiments should specifically test for fine-grained genetic variation in aridity 
adaptation. 
 Mechanisms that promote aridity adaptation, such as specific leaf and wood struc-
tures, should be investigated to refine identification of arid-adapted populations. 
 New genomic tools offer the opportunity to link tree genes with aridity adaptation in 
order to better understand mechanisms of adaptation (Sork et al. 2013). 
 Flexible seed sourcing guidelines need to be investigated for forest plantings in the 
Southwest (e.g., related local, composites, admixtures; Williams et al. 2014). 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
Planting may become more important in coming years to reforest an increasing area disturbed by severe 
wildfire and drought. As climate change models show increasing aridity for the Southwest, current locally 
adapted populations of ponderosa pine may become maladapted to current sites. Seedlings from more arid-
adapted populations may promote forest recovery from disturbance during future warming and drying. More 
research about genetic variation in aridity adaptation of ponderosa pine is needed in order to develop genetic
-based strategies to mitigate climate change impacts on southwestern forests.
