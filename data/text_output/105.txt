ABSTRACT
Aim To understand how tree growth response to regional drought and
temperature varies between tree species, elevations and forest types in a
mountain landscape.
Location Twenty-one sites on an elevation gradient of 1500 m on the San
Francisco Peaks, northern Arizona, USA.
Methods Tree-ring data for the years 1950–2000 for eight tree species (Abies
lasiocarpa var. arizonica (Merriam) Lemm., Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm.,
Pinus aristata Engelm., Pinus edulis Engelm., Pinus ﬂexilis James, Pinus ponderosa
Dougl. ex Laws., Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Beissn.) Franco and Quercus
gambelii Nutt.) were used to compare sensitivity of radial growth to regional
drought and temperature among co-occurring species at the same site, and
between sites that differed in elevation and species composition.
Results For Picea engelmannii, Pinus ﬂexilis, Pinus ponderosa and Pseudotsuga
menziesii, trees in drier, low-elevation stands generally had greater sensitivity of
radial growth to regional drought than trees of the same species in wetter, high-
elevation stands. Species low in their elevational range had greater drought
sensitivity than co-occurring species high in their elevational range at the pinyon-
juniper/ponderosa pine forest ecotone, ponderosa pine/mixed conifer forest
ecotone and high-elevation invaded meadows, but not at the mixed conifer/
subalpine forest ecotone. Sensitivity of radial growth to regional drought was
greater at drier, low-elevation compared with wetter, high-elevation forests.
Yearly growth was positively correlated with measures of regional water
availability at all sites, except high-elevation invaded meadows where growth
was weakly correlated with all climatic factors. Yearly growth in high-elevation
forests up to 3300 m a.s.l. was more strongly correlated with water availability
than temperature.
Main conclusions Severe regional drought reduced growth of all dominant tree
species over a gradient of precipitation and temperature represented by a 1500-m
change in elevation, but response to drought varied between species and stands.
Growth was reduced the most in drier, low-elevation forests and in species
growing low in their elevational range in ecotones, and the least for trees that had
recently invaded high-elevation meadows. Constraints on tree growth from
drought and high temperature are important for high-elevation subalpine forests
located near the southern-most range of the dominant species.

INTRODUCTION
Drought is the most limiting factor to tree growth in most
forests in the Southwest USA (Fritts, 1976; Meko et al., 1995;
Swetnam & Betancourt, 1998; Hidalgo et al., 2001; Meko &
Baisan, 2001). Climate change models predict higher tempera-
tures and increased variability in precipitation in the Southwest
USA for the future (Gregory et al., 1997; Gleick, 2000;
Rosenberg et al., 2003). These changes may lead to increases
in the frequency and intensity of drought (Lawford, 1993;
Hanson & Weltzin, 2000). Studies of tree rings can provide
insight into the effects of climate factors on tree growth (LeBlanc
& Foster, 1992; Graumlich, 1993; Szeicz & MacDonald, 1994;
Ettl & Peterson, 1995; Buckley et al., 1997; Cook et al., 2001;
Cullen et al., 2001; Peterson & Peterson, 2001; Beniston, 2002;
Dittmar et al., 2003). Such studies have shown differences in
tree growth response to precipitation and temperature among
sites and species (Villalba et al., 1994; Orwig & Abrams, 1997;
Cook et al., 2001; Galuszka & Kolb, 2002; Fekedulegn et al.,
2003) that need to be better understood in order to evaluate the
effects of climate change on forested landscapes.
Variable climate and topography make northern Arizona an
ideal location for biogeographical investigation of tree growth
response to climatic variation. The El Nin˜o Southern Oscil-
lation and Paciﬁc Decadal Oscillation contribute to high
interannual variability of precipitation in northern Arizona
(Swetnam & Betancourt, 1998; Sheppard et al., 2002). Preci-
pitation in northern Arizona is bimodal, with c. 50% of
precipitation in winter and 40% in summer, and summer
monsoon rains are preceded by an arid pre-monsoon period
and followed by a dry autumn (Swetnam & Betancourt, 1998;
Sheppard et al., 2002). The topography of northern Arizona
includes a 2300-m elevation gradient from the upper Sonoran
and Great Basin Deserts through several forest types to alpine
communities. Higher elevations in this region have a wetter,
cooler climate compared with lower elevations (Pearson, 1920;
Sheppard et al., 2002). For example, on the San Francisco
Peaks in northern Arizona, average air temperature for May
2003 through April 2004 decreased by 5 C (11.7–6.7 C) and
precipitation increased by 499 mm (274–773 mm) from an
elevation of 2020 to 2615 m a.s.l. (P. Dijstra, M. Montes-Helu
and B. Hungate, unpubl. data).
In this study we examine sensitivity of tree radial growth to
regional drought, precipitation and temperature for eight
species at 21 sites consisting of different forest types located
along a moisture and temperature gradient across a 1500-m
change in elevation on the San Francisco Peaks in northern
Arizona. Speciﬁcally, we compare sensitivity of tree radial
growth to regional drought and temperature (1) among stands
growing at different elevations for Picea engelmannii Parry ex
Engelm., Pinus ﬂexilis James, Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.
and Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Beissn.) Franco, and (2)
among all dominant co-occurring species in six forest types
along the elevational moisture and temperature gradient
ranging from the ecotone between the pinyon-juniper and
ponderosa pine forest types at an elevation of c. 2000 m to the
subalpine forest at an elevation of c. 3300 m. For within-
community, among-species comparisons, we expected that
species growing in drier, low-elevation stands would be more
sensitive to regional drought than species growing in wetter,
high-elevation stands. At low elevations we expected measures
of regional water availability to correlate best and positively
with yearly variation in growth. At high elevations we expected
temperature to correlate best and positively with yearly
variation in growth.

METHODS
Study areas
Our study was situated in upland forests on the Coconino
National Forest in northern Arizona (Fig. 1). Forests domin-
ated by Pinus edulis Engelm. and various Juniperus species
occur at the lowest elevations, Pinus ponderosa dominates at
intermediate elevations, and mixed conifers dominate at the
highest elevations (Brown, 1994). These forests have been
grazed by sheep and cattle and logged since the late 1880s
(Cline, 1994; Dahms & Geils, 1997). Most forests of Pinus
ponderosa and mixed conifers on ﬂat terrain are secondary
growth after logging, whereas old-growth stands are more
common on steep terrain. Grazing still occurs in some stands,
but grazing intensity is much lower than in the early 1900s
(Cline, 1994; Dahms & Geils, 1997). Suppression of ﬁre and
heavy grazing in the last 100 years has been associated with
large increases in tree density in both low- and high-elevation
forests in northern Arizona (Covington & Moore, 1994; Fule´
et al., 2002, 2004; Moore et al., 2004; Moore & Huffman, 2004;
Gascho Landis & Bailey, 2005).
We selected 21 sites within the Coconino National Forest in
the vicinity of Flagstaff, Arizona (Fig. 1). Sites representative
of several forest types and ecotones were selected near roads
and hiking trails for ease of access. Six sites were selected at the
pinyon-juniper/ponderosa pine forest ecotone near the low-
elevation range limit of Pinus ponderosa. Accurate character-
ization of the pinyon-juniper/ponderosa pine forest ecotone
required sampling over two types of soil. Three sites in this
ecotone, ranging between 1834 and 2103 m a.s.l., were selected
on soils with ﬂow basalt parent material; one of the sites also
contained Quercus gambelii Nutt. Three sites, ranging between
2032 and 2050 m a.s.l., were selected on soils with sedimentary
parent material where Q. gambelii was present. All other forest
types included in the study occurred on soils derived from
volcanic rocks, usually basalt. Three sites, ranging between
2120 and 2185 m a.s.l., were selected in the ponderosa pine
forest where Q. gambelii was present. Three sites were selected
in each of the following two ecotones: between the ponderosa
pine and mixed conifer forest types (2547–2603 m a.s.l.), and
between the mixed conifer and subalpine forest types (2871–
2946 m a.s.l.). Three sites were selected in each of the invaded
meadow (2749–2871 m a.s.l.) and subalpine (3286–3412 m
a.s.l.) forest communities. Trees have invaded many high
elevation meadows on the San Francisco Peaks in the last
100 years, as a likely consequence of ﬁre exclusion, heavy
sheep grazing and periods of favourable climate for tree
recruitment (Covington & Moore, 1994; Moore & Huffman,
2004). We selected invaded meadow sites where crown closure
has not occurred near the lower range limit of Pinus
aristata Engelm. Subalpine forest sites were selected just
below
the
treeline
where
sufﬁcient
numbers
of
Picea
engelmannii
and
Pinus
aristata
occurred
for
sampling.
Elevation, slope, aspect and tree basal area are summarized
for all sites in Table 1.
Tree-ring sampling and measurement
Our goal was to sample representative mature trees of each
dominant tree species at each of the 21 study sites. At each site
we selected 10–12 trees of approximately similar size of each
species growing in same vicinity. Tree age and diameter at
breast height (d.b.h.) were not used as strict criteria for
Table 1 Characteristics of the 21 study sites.
Latitude and longitude for aspect were
measured in decimal degrees. Basal area was
estimated by point sampling with an angle
gauge (Avery & Burkhart, 2002)

sampling,
but all sampled
trees were in dominant
or
co-dominant canopy positions and were representative of
mature trees at all sites. Sites at the mixed conifer/subalpine
forest ecotone and in the subalpine forest tended to have
closed canopies, thus we avoided sampling trees in or at the
edge of clearings. Also, we avoided trees that appeared to be
unhealthy or with insect or other damage. Between July 2001
and February 2003, d.b.h. was measured (Table 2) and two
increment cores were taken from each tree at breast height
from the south and west sides of the tree using a 5-mm
diameter increment borer (Suunto, Espoo, Finland). Cores
were mounted (Stokes & Smiley, 1968) and sanded with a belt
sander (Makita Corp., La Mirada, CA, USA) using FEPA
(Federation of European Producers of Abrasives) 100-, 220-,
320- and 400-grit belts (162, 68, 44.7–47.7 and 33.5–36.5 lm,
respectively; Orvis & Grissino-Mayer, 2002). Next, cores were
polished by hand with sandpaper of 40-, 30- and 15-lm grits
and with 30-lm polishing paper.
We measured the width of each annual ring to the nearest
0.01 mm using a Microcode II measuring banister system
(Boeckler Instruments, Tucson, AZ, USA) and the Measure
J2X computer software (VoorTech Consulting, Holderness,
NH, USA). Cores were cross-dated visually using narrow
marker years from Pinus ponderosa chronologies at the Gus
Pearson Natural Area (2237 m a.s.l.) in the Coconino National
Forest (Graybill & Rose, 1989; International Tree-Ring Data
Bank; World Data Center for Paleoclimatology; NOAA;
P. Fule´, pers. comm.). Cross-dating was validated using
skeleton plots (Stokes & Smiley, 1968) and cofecha computer
software (Holmes et al., 1986; Grissino-Mayer, 2001; Interna-
tional Tree Ring Data Bank program library). Cores that would
not cross-date well were excluded from further analysis. Age at
breast height was recorded for each tree (Table 2). When the
pith was absent from increment cores, a pith locator was used
to estimate age at breast height (Applequist, 1958).
Because tree-ring width and ring-width variation often
decrease as tree diameter increases, ring width measurements
should be standardized in order to meet the assumptions of
most statistical analyses, and to decouple ring-width variation
from changes in tree age and diameter (Fritts & Swetnam,
1989). Before standardizing, pairs of ring-width series were
averaged per tree. We used the simplest form of standardiza-
tion that retains high-frequency variation. Ring widths were
standardized using linear regression of annual width on year
of ring formation, and by dividing residuals by predicted
values to create a ring-width index (RWI) for each annual
ring. This standardization method results in a unitless RWI
with a mean of 1 and a constant variance over time (Fritts &
Swetnam, 1989). Only rings formed between 1950 and 2000
were standardized as this period contained ample variability
in
precipitation
and
climate
factors
for
our
analyses.
Instrumental climate data are available locally since 1909.
However, the period of 1909–1949 was relatively wet with
only two years in this period having a Palmer Drought
Severity Index (PDSI) <)2. PDSI is a region-speciﬁc index of
drought
calculated
from
precipitation,
temperature
and
potential evapotranspiration (Palmer, 1965; Alley, 1984).

on each core also made it possible to include more trees in
the study.
Data analysis
We obtained PDSI data calculated from instrument environ-
mental data for Arizona region 2 from the National Climate
Data Center, USA. We selected eight dry and eight wet years
between 1950 and 2000 for comparisons of tree radial growth
(Fig. 2). Selected dry years had an average PDSI < )2.0 and
selected wet years had an average PDSI > 2.0. A secondary
criterion for the selection of these years was temporal
dispersion of wet and dry years throughout the 51-year
measurement period. An average RWI for each tree was
calculated for the eight dry years and for the eight wet years.
The ratio of RWI in wet years to dry years (W : D) was
calculated by dividing the average RWI for the eight wet years
by the average RWI for the eight dry years for each tree
(Fekedulegn et al., 2003). As we were interested primarily in
response to severe drought, we used the W : D approach
instead of a variable based on growth response in all years of
the measurement period, such as mean sensitivity (Fritts, 1976;
Fritts & Swetnam, 1989).
To examine differences in sensitivity of tree growth to regional
drought, we compared W : D among elevations and species
using anova with SPSS 11.0 for Windows statistical software
(SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Our anova model for within-
species comparisons among elevations included elevation class
(low, middle and high) and site nested within elevation as
sources of variation. Our model for between-species compari-
sons had species, site and species-by-site interaction as sources of
variation. As differences in W : D can be caused by differences in
growth during dry years, wet years, or both, we also analysed
mean RWI separately for the eight dry and eight wet selected
years using anova with the same models used for W : D.
We created 51-year chronologies (1950–2000) by averaging
RWI for trees of each species at each community. We
correlated RWI chronologies with monthly, seasonal and
hydrological year (October–September) values of total preci-
pitation, average, minimum temperature, maximum tempera-
ture and average PDSI (Fritts, 1976; Villalba et al., 1994, 1997;
Peterson & Peterson, 2001). Climate data from a weather
station at the US Forest Service Fort Valley Experimental
Station, located 10 km north-west of Flagstaff at an elevation
of 2237 m on the footslope of the San Francisco Peaks in the
vicinity of our study sites, were used in correlations and were
obtained from the Western Regional Climate Center. Auto-
correlation coefﬁcients were calculated for each chronology to
understand how much radial growth in previous years
inﬂuenced growth in the current year (Fritts, 1976; Orwig &
Abrams, 1997).
RESULTS
Autocorrelation
Lag 1 autocorrelation was generally low: average 0.27 over all
species and communities, range between )0.09 and 0.59, and
77% of all values were < 0.4 (Table 3). Therefore, for a given
year, radial growth in the previous year generally had a small
effect on radial growth in the current year.
Wet : dry ratio
For Picea engelmannii, Pinus ﬂexilis, Pinus ponderosa and
Pseudotsuga menziesii, W : D was greater in high-elevation
stands than low-elevation stands, and the difference was
signiﬁcant (P < 0.05) for Picea engelmannii (n ¼ 60) and Pinus
ponderosa (n ¼ 90; Fig. 3). For Pinus ﬂexilis (n ¼ 56) and
Pseudotsuga menziesii (n ¼ 60), W : D differed signiﬁcantly
(P < 0.01) among sites within elevations (data not shown).
At the pinyon-juniper/ponderosa pine forest ecotone, Pinus
ponderosa had higher W : D than Pinus edulis (P < 0.001,
n ¼ 128; Fig. 4a). W : D also differed signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05)
among sites at this ecotone (data not shown).
At the ponderosa pine/mixed conifer ecotone, a signiﬁcant
species-by-site interaction complicated interpretation of main
effects, so an anova was performed at each site to compare
species (Fig. 4b). At site 1, Pseudotsuga menziesii had higher
W : D than Pinus ponderosa (P < 0.05, n ¼ 30), but not
higher than Pinus ﬂexilis. At site 2, Pinus ﬂexilis had higher
W : D than Pinus ponderosa (P < 0.05, n ¼ 28), and W : D of
Pseudotsuga menziesii did not differ from either species. At site
3, Pseudotsuga menziesii and Pinus ﬂexilis had higher W : D
than Pinus ponderosa (P < 0.01, n ¼ 30).
There were no differences in W : D among species at the
mixed conifer/subalpine forest ecotone (P > 0.1, n ¼ 112,
Fig. 4c). At invaded meadow sites, Pinus aristata and Pinus

ﬂexilis had higher W : D than Pinus ponderosa (P < 0.01,
n ¼ 91; Fig. 4d).
In the subalpine forest community, W : D for Pinus aristata
was higher than W : D of Picea engelmannii (P < 0.05,
n ¼ 64), but the difference was small (Fig. 4e). Site differences
in W : D in the subalpine forest were also signiﬁcant
(P < 0.001, data not shown).
At the pinyon-juniper/ponderosa pine forest ecotone on the
site with basalt-derived soil, W : D did not differ between
Pinus ponderosa and Q. gambelii (P > 0.05, n ¼ 32), but both
had higher W : D than Pinus edulis (P < 0.001; Fig. 5a).
However, at the pinyon-juniper/ponderosa pine forest ecotone
sites on soils derived from sedimentary rocks, Pinus ponderosa
had higher W : D than Q. gambelii (P < 0.001, n ¼ 96), which
had higher W : D than Pinus edulis (P < 0.001; Fig. 5b). In the
mid-elevation ponderosa pine forest, Pinus ponderosa again
had higher W : D than Q. gambelii (P < 0.05, n ¼ 55; Fig. 5c).
Analysis of average RWI in wet years and dry years
separately revealed that species with high W : D in most
communities resulted from both wide rings in wet years and
narrow rings in dry years. One exception was the pinyon-
juniper/ponderosa pine forest ecotone on basalt-derived soil,
where dry-year RWI was similar among species (Table 4),
indicating that species differences in W : D (Figs 4 & 5) were
caused primarily by differences in RWI in wet years. The
second exception was the subalpine forest, where RWI in dry
years was the dominant inﬂuence on differences in W : D
among species (Table 4).
RWI–climate correlations
Several overall patterns emerged from correlation analysis of
RWI and climate variables (Fig. 6). RWI of most species was
signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05, n ¼ 51) and positively correlated with
annual and winter precipitation, and with PDSI in the winter,
growing, pre-monsoon, and monsoon seasons. Moreover, RWI
for most species was negatively correlated with annual, winter

RWI with growing season, pre-monsoon and monsoon
precipitation, and annual PDSI were low or not signiﬁcant
(P > 0.05) for most species (Fig. 6). Across all communities
and species, only RWI of Pinus ponderosa was signiﬁcantly and
positively correlated with temperatures; RWI of Pinus ponde-
rosa was positively correlated with growing season average
temperature at the mid-elevation ponderosa pine forest
(r ¼ 0.31, P < 0.05), and the ponderosa pine/mixed conifer
forest ecotone (r ¼ 0.34, P < 0.05).

(Fig. 6a), correlations between RWI and climate variables
were similar for Pinus edulis and Pinus ponderosa, except for
pre-monsoon precipitation where Pinus edulis was positively
correlated and Pinus ponderosa was not. At this community,
the highest absolute r-values of any community occurred for
correlations of RWI with annual and winter precipitation, and
winter, growing season, pre-monsoon, and monsoon PDSI.
Quercus gambelii had a pattern of correlations similar to Pinus
ponderosa and Pinus edulis at the pinyon-juniper/ponderosa
pine forest ecotone (data not shown).
At the mid-elevation ponderosa pine forest (Fig. 6b),
Q. gambelii had a similar pattern of RWI–climate correlations
as Pinus ponderosa, but Q. gambelii typically had higher
r-values than Pinus ponderosa. Quercus gambelii had the
highest absolute r-values of all species for RWI correlations
with annual and winter maximum temperatures.

(Fig. 6c), Pinus ﬂexilis and Pseudotsuga menziesii had higher

pre-monsoon precipitation, whereas Pinus ﬂexilis and Pseu-

At the mixed conifer/subalpine forest ecotone (Fig. 6d),
Picea engelmannii, Pinus ﬂexilis and Pseudotsuga menziesii had

tions (P < 0.05) for pre-monsoon precipitation, but Picea
engelmannii did not have a signiﬁcant correlation.
Species at the invaded meadow community (Fig. 6e) had
only a few signiﬁcant correlations of RWI with climate
variables, and those had low absolute r-values. In the subalpine
forest (Fig. 6f), RWI–climate correlations for Pinus aristata
were stronger than correlations for Picea engelmannii for
winter precipitation, PDSI in all seasons, and for winter
maximum temperature. Pinus aristata had signiﬁcant correla-
tions (P < 0.05) of RWI with annual and monsoon precipita-
tion, and with annual maximum temperature, whereas Picea
engelmannii did not. Pinus aristata was the only species at any
community to have a negative correlation between RWI and
monsoon precipitation.
DISCUSSION
The large amount of interannual variation in PDSI in the
51 years of our study revealed differences in sensitivity of tree
radial growth to regional drought among species and forest
communities over a gradient of precipitation and temperature
represented by a change in elevation of 1500 m from the low-
elevation pinyon-juniper/ponderosa pine ecotone forest to the
high-elevation subalpine forest. High values of W : D indicate
high sensitivity of tree radial growth to moisture conditions
(Fekedulegn et al., 2003). Separate analyses of RWI in wet
years and dry years indicated that high W : D was driven by
both wide rings in wet years and narrow rings in dry years for
most species at most sites.
Trees in low-elevation stands were more sensitive to
regional drought than trees of the same species in high-
elevation stands, and this difference was largest for Picea
engelmannii and Pinus ponderosa. The large difference in
W : D between low- and high-elevation stands of these species
could be due to their wide elevational range at our study sites
(c. 430 m for Picea engelmannii and c. 600 m for Pinus
ponderosa) that was associated with a large gradient in
available soil water. In contrast, low- and high-elevation
stands of Pinus ﬂexilis and Pseudotsuga menziesii differed in
elevation by only c. 340 m at our study sites, and differences in
W : D among elevations were smaller than for Picea engel-
mannii and Pinus ponderosa.
Regional drought sensitivity of Pinus ponderosa was greater
than for a co-occurring conifer with a lower elevation range
(Pinus edulis), but was lower than for co-occurring conifers
with higher elevation ranges (such as Pinus ﬂexilis and

Pseudotsuga menziesii). This ﬁnding for Pinus ﬂexilis, Pinus
ponderosa and Pseudotsuga menziesii is consistent with the
physiology of these species. In a seedling study, growth of
Pseudotsuga menziesii was more responsive to watering than
Pinus ponderosa (Zhang et al., 1996). Although Pinus ponde-
rosa is more prone to xylem cavitation during extreme water
stress than Pseudotsuga menziesii (Pin˜ol & Sala, 2000), Pinus
ponderosa compensates by having greater stomatal control of
water loss (Pin˜ol & Sala, 2000) and by a greater capacity to
store water (Stout & Sala, 2003). In an invaded meadow on the
San Francisco Peaks, Pinus ponderosa had lower stomatal
sensitivity to water vapour pressure deﬁcit between the leaf and
the atmosphere than did Pinus ﬂexilis (Fischer et al., 2002),
suggesting greater photosynthesis by Pinus ponderosa than
Pinus ﬂexilis during drought.
There were no differences in W : D among species at the
mixed conifer/subalpine forest ecotone. Separate analysis of
RWI in wet and dry years helped explain this result. Abies
lasiocarpa had a lower RWI in wet years than the other species
(P < 0.05, n ¼ 112, data not shown) at all three sites in this
ecotone, indicating that it did not take advantage of favourable
conditions in wet years for radial growth to the extent that
other species did.
Although differences in W : D among species at the invaded
meadow and subalpine forest communities were statistically
signiﬁcant, they were small compared to differences among
species in lower elevation communities. At the invaded
meadow communities, the white pines (subgenus Haploxylon)
Pinus ﬂexilis and Pinus aristata had greater W : D than did
Pinus ponderosa; a ﬁnding that is consistent with differences in
stomatal response to vapour pressure deﬁcit between Pinus
ponderosa and Pinus ﬂexilis at a similar site (Fischer et al.,
2002). In the subalpine forest, Pinus aristata had a higher
W : D than Picea engelmannii, a ﬁnding that is consistent with
its greater occurrence on south-facing, dry ridges (Rominger &
Paulik, 1983).
Growth of Q. gambelii was less sensitive to regional drought
than growth of Pinus ponderosa. Quercus gambelii had lower

Tree growth response to drought and temperature

W : D than did Pinus ponderosa at the pinyon-juniper/
ponderosa pine ecotone on sites with soil derived from
sedimentary rocks and at the mid-elevation ponderosa pine
forest. This result is consistent with Q. gambelii’s ability to
avoid soil water stress (i.e. higher pre-dawn water potential)
and to tolerate atmospheric water stress (i.e. higher photo-
synthesis at high vapour pressure deﬁcit) better than Pinus
ponderosa (Kolb & Stone, 2000). We caution against projecting
the lack of a difference between Q. gambelii and Pinus
ponderosa on the basalt-derived soil at the pinyon-juniper/
ponderosa pine ecotone across similar sites, as this comparison
was not replicated over sites.
Radial growth–climate correlations and W : D results in
most communities were consistent in that species with low
W : D had lower absolute r-values for most climate variables
than did species with high W : D. This consistency indicates
that species with low sensitivity of growth to severe regional
drought (i.e. low W : D) also showed low sensitivity of growth
to yearly variation in climate factors such as precipitation and
temperature. One notable exception was at the mid-elevation
ponderosa pine forest where Q. gambelii had higher r-values
than Pinus ponderosa for every annual and seasonal climate
variable, despite having a lower W : D than Pinus ponderosa.
This result is interesting because others have not had much
success at correlating Q. gambelii chronologies from very old
trees with climate (Biondi, 1987). For the 51 years of our study
(1950–2000), RWI of Q. gambelii growing near the San
Francisco Peaks was clearly responsive to variation in preci-
pitation and temperature.
Correlations of RWI with annual and seasonal precipitation
and regional PDSI declined with increasing elevation from the
pinyon-juniper/ponderosa pine forest ecotone to the subalp-
ine/mixed conifer forest ecotone. This result is likely to reﬂect
increasing water availability from low to high elevations. Low
radial growth–climate correlations at invaded meadows sug-
gest that growth of trees in this community was weakly
coupled to variations in temperature and precipitation because
there was little competition for water due to low tree density.
Another potential reason for weak radial growth–climate
correlations at the invaded meadows is that trees at these sites
were generally younger than trees at other sites, as the strength
of tree radial growth–climate relationships can increase with
tree age for some species (Szeicz & MacDonald, 1994). In the
subalpine forest, correlations of RWI with PDSI in the
growing, pre-monsoon, and monsoon seasons were signiﬁcant
for Pinus aristata and Picea engelmannii, and were relatively
high for Pinus aristata (r ¼ 0.61, 0.63 and 0.59, respectively,
n ¼ 51). These results, combined with a lack of positive
correlations between RWI and temperature, and frequent
negative correlations between RWI and maximum tempera-
tures at the mixed conifer/subalpine forest ecotone, invaded
meadow and subalpine forest communities, suggest that yearly
growth in the high-elevation forests in our study was limited
more by high temperatures and low water availability than by
low temperatures.
Negative relationships between tree radial growth and
temperature similar to our results have been reported before
for subalpine tree species in the western USA (Villalba et al.,
1994; Ettl & Peterson, 1995; Peterson & Peterson, 2001).
Increased carbon allocation to respiration during periods of
high temperatures could cause a negative radial growth–
temperature relationship (Dahl, 1951; Waring & Schlesinger,
1985). Huxman et al. (2003) measured net ecosystem CO2
exchange using eddy ﬂux towers of a subalpine forest at an
elevation of 3050 m in the Colorado Front Range and found
that low temperature in spring limited net CO2 uptake, but
high temperature in mid-summer increased ecosystem respir-
ation, and thus decreased net CO2 uptake. Low net CO2 uptake
of the forest at temperatures > 10 C was partly attributed to
increases in tree respiration with increasing temperature
(Huxman et al., 2003). At our study sites in northern Arizona
located near the southern range limit of most of the species we
studied, we speculate that high respiration resulting from high
summer temperatures limits growth in warm years.
CONCLUSIONS
Severe regional drought reduced growth of all dominant tree
species over a gradient of precipitation and temperature
represented by a 1500-m change in elevation on the San
Francisco Peaks in northern Arizona, but response to drought
varied among species and sites. This variation suggests four
rules that may be useful in understanding the effects of
regional drought and climate change on tree growth for
mountain landscapes that are characterized by pronounced
gradients in precipitation and temperature. First, regional
drought reduces tree growth more in drier, low-elevation
forests than wetter, high-elevation forests. Second, regional
drought reduces tree growth more for species that occur low in
their elevational range in ecotones than co-occurring species
that occur high in their elevational range, and this difference is
more pronounced in low-elevation forests. Third, open-grown
trees that have recently invaded meadows show little growth
response to regional drought or yearly variation in precipita-
tion and temperature. Fourth, constraints on tree growth from
drought and high temperature are important for high-eleva-
tion subalpine forests located near the most southern range of
the dominant species.
