The Effect of a Prescribed Burn in 
Southwestern Ponderosa Pine on 
Organic Matter and Nutrients in 
Woody Debris and Forest Floor 
W. WALLACE COVINGTON  
STEPHEN S. SACKETT 
ABSTRACT. After 100 years of fire exclusion, controlled burning in the fall was used as a first step in the 
reintroduction of periodic burning in a southwestern ponderosa pine ecosystem near Flagstaff, Arizona, U.S.A. Organic 
matter storage in woody debris was decreased 63 percent from 2,325 g/m2 to 869 g/m2, with a disproportionate (99 percent) 
decline in the large, rotten wood. Nutrient storage in the woody debris decreased by 80 percent for N, 62 percent for P, 70 
percent for Ca, 71 percent for Mg, and 74 percent for K. Forest floor storages were less drastically affected, with organic matter 
content declining 37 percent from 3,170 g/m2 to 1,990 g/m2 immediately after burning. Nutrient content of the forest floor 
was not significantly affected by burning due, in part, to the transfer of nutrients from woody debris to the forest floor. 
By 7 months after burning, the forest floor had declined by an additional 440 g/m2 of organic matter, most likely from 
microbial mineralization. Also during this period forest floor storages for all nutrients declined significantly, except K 
which was unchanged. Mg exhibited the greatest proportional decline (40 percent), followed by N, P, and Ca, all of which 
decreased by approximately 25 percent. Numerous potential benefits to productivity may be associated with this prescribed 
bum-reduced fire hazard, accelerated nutrient mobilization, and reduced forest floor interception of precipitation.

ANY SITUATION in which forest litter steadily accumulates on the surface of the mineral soil is undesirable for forest 
management because nutrient cycles develop progressively slower rates of turnover (Miller and others 1976) and fire hazards 
increase. One such situation is the exclusion of fire in southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.). 
Before European settlement of northern Arizona in the 1860s, periodic natural low intensity fires in the surrounding 
ponderosa pine forest occurred at frequent intervals, perhaps every 2 to 12 years (Weaver 1951, Cooper 1960, Biswell 1972, 
and Dieterich 1980). Several factors associated with European settlement caused a reduction in fire frequency and size 
(Cooper 1960). Roads and trails broke up fuel continuity. Domestic livestock grazing, especially overgrazing by cattle and 
sheep in the late 1880s, greatly reduced herbaceous fuels, and through trampling, further reduced fuel structure and

continuity. In fact, many of the early argument for heavy grazing were based on the assumption that heavy grazing reduced 
forest fire frequency (Cooper 1960). Fire exclusion was the principal duty of early foresters in the Southwest beginning with 
active fire suppression in the Flagstaff area as early as 1908. 
Forest management problems ascribed to fire exclusion in ponderosa pine include: (1) overstocked sapling patches, 
(2) reduced growth, (3) stagnated nutrient cycles, (4) increased disease, insect infestation, and parasites (e.g., root rot, bark 
beetle, dwarf mistletoe), (5) decreased seedling establishment, (6) decreased forage quality and quantity, (7) increased fuel 
loading, (8) increased vertical fuel continuity due to dense sapling patches, and (9) increased severity and destructive 
potential of wildfires (Cooper 1960, Biswell 1972, Weaver 1974, and others).   Because of the exponential increase in 
wildfire severity over the past three decades (Barrows'), forest managers are turning to prescribed fire to reduce the heavy 
fuel loads which have accumulated in the past 50 to 100 years. 
Although prescribed burning is being widely used in this forest type, very little is known about effects on organic 
matter and nutrient storages. This paper reports changes in forest floor and woody debris organic matter and nutrient 
storages-during the first year following initiation of a planned long-term study of the effect of periodic burning on ecosystem 
physiology in ponderosa pine in northern Arizona. 
 
METHODS 
 
Site Description. -The study site is located in the Fort Valley Experimental Forest at the base of the San Francisco Peaks 
approximately 10 km northwest of Flagstaff, Arizona, at an elevation of 2,195-2,255 m. The climate is characterized as sub-
humid to humid with cool temperatures and deficient early summer moisture (Schubert 1974). Mean annual temperature in 
Flagstaff is 7.5°C; the mean annual precipitation is 56.7 cm (Schubert 1974) with approximately one-half of the precipitation 
falling as snow. The average frost-free growing season is 135 days (Schubert 1974). 
The soils are volcanic in origin with basalt and cinder parent materials. They are tentatively classified as Brolliar 
stony clay loam, a fine montmorillonitic, frigid, Typic, Argiboroll by an adjacent soil survey (Meurisse2).  
The study area is dominated by an uneven-aged forest, in small even-aged groups, typical of virgin ponderosa pine. 
The predominant size class is 20 to 5, cm dbh (diameter at breast height) (pole-sized trees), with scattered groups of 5-20 
trees over 200 yr old and ranging from 60-120 cm dbh (sawtimber trees), and dense "doghair" thickets of sapling-sized trees 
ranging from 2.5 to 7.6 cm dbh. 
There has been no harvesting activity on the study site, except for localized fuelwood cutting of dead trees near 
roads. Based on fire scar analysis, the last fire I on the study area occurred in 1876 but before that, fires occurred periodically 
at an average interval of approximately 2 years (Dieterich 1980). , 
Twenty-seven contiguous one hectare plots were established in the study area in 1976. Six treatments (periodic 
burning every 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 years) with three replicates each plus controls and extra unburned plots were randomly as-
signed to each plot. Each plot has a 1.5 m fireline plowed around its perimeter. 
Within each plot 5 circular 0.04 ha subplots have been established. On these subplots dbh was recorded to the 
nearest cm for each tree. The one year interval plots reported in this paper had an average of 2,454 trees per hectare 
with an average dbh of 7.5 cm. Basal area was 43.8 m2/ha. 
Woodv Debris Sampling. -Woody debris 2.54 cm or less in diameter was sampled by collecting material on 756 systematically 
located 0.093 m2 (1 ft2) plots and separating it into two classes (0-0.63 cm and 0.64-2.53). The planar intercept 
technique (Brown 1974) as modified for southwestern ponderosa pine (Sackett 1979) was used for inventorying woody 
debris greater than 2.55 cm in diameter before and immediately after burning. The method involves counting woody 
material (2.55-7.62 cm) that intersects vertical sampling planes and measuring the diameters of pieces

greater than 7.62 cm in diameter for two decay classes (sound and rotten). Rotten is defined as any woody material 
that can be easily kicked apart. The piece counts and diameters are used to calculate weights per unit area by regression 
relationships. The planar intercept technique was not used for the woody debris smaller than 2.55 cm because it is much 
less accurate for fine material. 
Separate samples of each size class were collected along systematically located transects for nutrient analysis. Five 
composite samples consisting of material collected from four individual locations each were analyzed for each of the 
following diameter size classes: 
1. 0-0.64 cm 
2. 0.65-2.54 cm  
3. 2.55-7.62 cm 
4. > 7.62 cm sound  
5. > 7.62 cm rotten 
Because of the extreme variation in woody debris associated with its markedly clumped distribution, it was necessary 
to include the data from all 18 plots burned in 1976 (instead of just those designed to have annual fires) to obtain a reasonable 
estimate of woody debris changes. However, caution must be used in interpreting woody debris organic matter and nutrient 
budgets since wood litter fall is so erratic and localized (see Nye 1961). 
Forest Floor Sampling. -Twenty 0.093 m2 samples of forest floor material were collected systematically (four from each 
of the five circular basal area plots) from each of the three 1-year burn plots (n = 60) before burning (October 28-November 2, 
1976), immediately after burning (November 6-7, 1976), and 7 months after burning (June 1977). Within each 0.093 m2 
quadrat all material, including ash on post burn samples, was collected. The four samples from each of the basal area plots 
were composited into one sample for organic matter and chemical analysis. 
Chemical Analysis. -Samples were ground in a hammer mill, subsampled, and then ground in a Wiley mill to pass a 1.3 mm 
sieve (20 mesh). Organic matter content was determined by loss on ignition (500°C, 4h) of a 5 g sample. Nutrient content was 
determined using a selenium-catalyzed, sulfuric acid, hydrogen peroxide, lithium sulfate digestion of a 1.5 g sample 
(Parkinson and Allen 1975). Calcium, magnesium, and potassium concentrations were determined by atomic absorption 
spectrophotometry. Nitrogen and phosphorus were determined colorimetrically using the Technicon AutoAnalyzer 
(Technicon 1974). All data are reported on an ovendry (80°C, constant weight) basis. 
Fire Description.-Rainfall on the study area was below normal during the late summer and fall prior to the initial fires 
in 1976. On October 21, 0.69 cm of rain fell; 4 days later, 0.08 cm was recorded with no other recordable precipitation 
until several weeks after the plots were burned. On the evening of November 5, the study area was burned. Ignition 
began at 5:30 p.m. and continued until 11: 00 p.m. 
 
Surface needle (L-layer) moisture content increased from 8 to 12 percent during the night as temperatures fell. 
Similarly, lower layers (F- and H-layers) of the forest floor increased from 10 to 19 percent moisture content. 
Temperatures in the stand dropped from 15°C at 5:30 p.m. to 3°C at midnight, when the flaming combustion of the forest 
floor was complete. During the same time period relative humidity increased from 21 to 48 percent. Initially backing fires were 
used but when they no longer carried well, short (9-12 m between strips) strip head fires were used. Rates of spread 
were no greater than 3.7 m per minute, generally ranging from 1.2 to 1.8 m per minute. Flame lengths in litter fuels seldom 
exceeded . 40 cm. Glowing combustion in deep duff fuel continued for 2-3 days. Some large woody debris and stumps 
smoldered for as long as 4 weeks.

RESULTS 
 
Woody Debris. -Overall, burning decreased the organic matter stored in woody debris 63 percent (Table 1). The 
largest size class (>7.62 cm) had strikingly different results depending on its decay condition. The large sound woody 
material decreased by only 14 percent while the rotten material was almost completely eliminated (a 99 percent 
reduction). 
 
As expected, nutrient concentrations in sound woody debris were inversely related to diameter (Table 2). The 
large rotten class had significantly higher (P 0.05) nutrient concentrations than the sound class for all nutrients except P. 
The N concentration ratio between sound and rotten wood was especially steep being three times higher in rotten 
material.

The nutrient content of the woody debris decreased as a result of the burn by 80 percent for N, 62 

percent for P, 70 percent for Ca, 71 percent for Mg, and 74 percent for K (Table 1). 
Forest Floor.-The organic matter content of the forest floor declined by 1,180 g/m2, a 37 percent 
reduction as a direct result of burning (Table 3). Seven months after the prescribed fire the forest floor content had 
declined by an additional 440 g/m2. Thus by June following burning the net effect was a 51 percent reduction 
in forest floor organic matter content. 
Nutrient content of the forest floor was not significantly (p 0.05) affected when sampled the first 
month after burning (Table 3). However by 7 months after burning all nutrients except K had decreased 
significantly. Mg exhibited the greatest proportional decline, approximately 40 percent (10.1 g/m2). Declines in 
N (10.8 g/m2), P (1.57 g/m2), and Ca (11.2 g/m2) were approximately 25 percent. 
DISCUSSION 
The reintroduction of understory burning after 100 years of fuel accumulation caused substantial changes in 
surface organic matter and nutrient storages. In general, organic matter storages were greatly reduced; nutrient 
storages were somewhat less affected. 
Changes in Organic Matter Storages. -Comparison of our preburn woody debris and forest floor weights (Tables I and 3) 
with the results from an extensive survey of 62 undisturbed ponderosa pine stands in Arizona, New Mexico, and 
southern Colorado (Sackett 1979) shows that surface organic matter storages on our study area are typical of 
southwestern ponderosa pine stands. 
Information is scant regarding natural woody debris reduction by burning in southwestern ponderosa pine. 
Although there are some data concerning effects of slash burning (Klemmedson 1976), we could find only one paper with 
quantitative data concerning natural woody debris reduction by prescribed fire in southwestern ponderosa pine. Gaines and 
others (1958) found reductions of approximately 50-75 percent in woody debris for two fall prescribed burns on the Fort 
Apache Indian Reservation, Arizona. However, comparison of these findings with our results is tenuous due to 
differences in both site and stand characteristics as well as burning conditions. 
Our observed 63 percent decline (1,460 g/m2) in woody debris by burning represents a major change in surface 
organic matter storage. The disproportionate decrease (99 percent) in the large, rotten class (Table 1) is particularly 
striking. This phenomenon may be explained by the higher lignin-to-cellulose ratio and larger surface-to-volume particle 
size of rotten material in conjunction with the ease of ignition and completeness of glowing combustion characteristic of 
such lignin-laden materials (Brown and Davis 1973, Rothermel 1976). 
Organic matter storages in the forest floor were less drastically reduced by the prescribed fire. The 37 percent reduction 
(1,180 g/m2) is similar to that found in other studies of prescribed

burning in southwestern ponderosa pine. Davis and others (1968) found a 30 percent reduction in forest floor weight in one 
area and a 36 percent reduction in another following a 1964 prescribed fire in pole-sized ponderosa pine in Arizona. Wagle 
and Eakle (1979) found a 28 percent reduction in forest floor weight following a prescribed fire in the White Mountains of 
central Arizona. 
An earlier paper (Sackett 1980) reported the results of an operational level fuel survey designed to characterize the 
entire area on the same study site and the same fire as reported in the present paper. This fuel survey included sapling sites 

which had slightly less forest floor mass, as well as sawtimber dominated sites which had three to four times as much forest 
floor mass (13,000 g/m2) as the pole dominated sites reported in the present paper. 
The forest floor under these sawtimber stands was completely consumed (Sackett 1980). Thus for the entire study 
area (all canopy cover types) there was greater reduction (63 percent) in the forest floor than the 37 percent reduction in the 
pole dominated sites reported in the present paper. 
During the 7 months following the prescribed fire the forest floor organic matter decreased by an additional 440 
g/m2 even though needle cast during the fall and spring following burning added considerable litter to the forest floor. This 
additional decline is most likely due to microbial activity. Published decay rates (k) for ponderosa pine range from 1.46 to 
2.93 percent per year, among the slowest for any forest type (Jenny and others 1949, Olson 1963). Multiplying preburn forest 
floor organic matter content (3,170 g/m2, Table 3) by these rates gives 4693 g/m2 of organic matter decayed in 12 months. 
Thus our observed 440 g/m2 loss in 7 months represents almost a 10 fold increase in decomposition. Results from several 
other studies suggest increased decay following burning in southwestern ponderosa pine. Fuller and others (1955) observed 
increased microbial activity following a prescribed burn as did Bennett (1974). Klemmedson (1975) found a 95 percent 
reduction in weight of residual unburned needles 2 years after a slash burn. 
Several potential forest management benefits are likely from this reduction in forest floor mass. The decline in forest 
floor and woody debris considerably reduces the extreme fire hazard associated with the heavy fuel buildup of the past 100 
years. Furthermore, reductions in forest floor organic matter should improve moisture relations on the site. Aldon (1968) 
found a strong linear relationship between evaporation loss due to forest floor interception and forest floor weight in pole-size 
ponderosa pine near our study area. Thus our observed decreases in forest floor weight should reduce interception losses 
thereby allowing more moisture to reach the mineral soil. Supporting this conclusion is the observation by Ryan3 of 
significantly higher soil moisture content on burned versus unburned sites on our study area during the summer, 1977. 
 
Changes in Nutrient Storages. -Our results for nutrient storage in surface organic matter are in general agreement with 
existing published accounts. Klemmedson (1975 and 1976) found 22.7-50.2 g/m2 of nitrogen in the forest floor and small 
woody debris of pole-size ponderosa pine near our study area. Welch and Klemmedson (1975) reported an average of 43 
g/m2 of nitrogen in the litter for several pole-size ponderosa pine plots in northern Arizona. We could not find data for Ca, 
Mg, or K storages in surface organic litter for southwestern ponderosa pine. However, Wooldridge (1970) working in 
ponderosa pine in central Washington found 60.5 g/m2 of N, 8.9 g/m2 of P, and 22.9 g/m2 of K. Nissley and others (1980) 
found nutrient storage in the forest floor for several unburned stands of ponderosa pine in central Oregon to be 20-28 g/m2 of 
N, 1.9-2.5 g/m2 of P, 14-19 g/m2 of Ca, 2.3-2.8 g/m2 of Mg, and 2.6-3.7 g/m2 of K. The generally lower forest floor nutrient 
contents reported by Nissley and others (1980) when compared to ours are primarily a consequence of much lower organic, 
matter storages in the forest floor on their sites rather than lower nutrient concentrations. We could find no data regarding 
nutrient storages in natural woody debris in ponderosa pine. Klemmedson (1976) reported 3.8-4.0 g/m2 of N in branches and 
holes in logging slash piles for two ponderosa pine stands near our study area. 
The lack of a significant decline in nutrient storage in the forest floor immediately after burning (Table 3) most 
likely results from the selective burning of surface layers low in nutrients, the L layer in particular, and the deposition of 
woody debris ash, which after burning would be sampled as fine material in the forest floor. Thus nutrient losses directly 
from burning (e.g., nitrogen volatilization) do not appear to be a problem under our burning conditions. The 20-40 percent 
decline in forest floor nutrient storages for all nutrients except potassium (luring the 7 months following burning (Table 3) 
represents a substantial decrease.  However, increases in ammonium and nitrate in the mineral soil (Ryan3) on our site 
suggest much of the nutrients from the forest floor may be leached into the mineral soil. 
 
 
There are no other data available concerning nutrient storage impacts of prescribed understory burning in 
southwestern ponderosa pine. However, Klemmedson (1976) found a decline in nitrogen in the forest floor following burning 
of piled slash for two ponderosa pine sites near our study area. An earlier study by Klemmedson and others (1962) in 
ponderosa pine in northern California showed a 
13.9 g/m2 decline in N content of forest floor and slash following burning. Nissley and others (1980) found an 11.0 g/m2 
decrease in N; a 1 g/m2 increase in each of P, Mg, and K; and a 20 g/m2 decrease in Ca storages in forest floor and 
understory vegetation following prescribed burning in ponderosa pine in central Oregon. 
The direct mineralization of nutrients from surface organic matter in conjunction with those released during 
subsequent microbial processes probably result in overall improvement of nutrient availability in the ponderosa pine 
ecosystem. The mineralization of the forest floor through microbial processes may be especially important since nutrients 
mobilized in this manner are released more gradually than the sudden surge brought about by fire. Furthermore, nitrogen 
released during burning often results in considerable volatilization representing a net loss to the ecosystem, whereas nitrogen 
released by accelerated decomposition following burning would be in a form readily absorbed by plants or retained on 

exchange sites. 
Numerous authors have attributed primary production increases following burning to improved nutrient relations. 
Pearson and others (1972) inferred that higher nutrient availability was primarily responsible for increased radial growth of 
ponderosa pine and increased understory production and nutrient content following a wildfire near our study area. Vlamis and 
others (1959) found higher production of lettuce and ponderosa pine seedlings in a bioassay of burned sites versus controls in 
California ponderosa pine. The increased production was due to higher nitrogen availability in the soils from the burned 
areas. Using the same techniques, Wagle and Kitchen (1972) found increased nitrogen availability and growth in soils from 
recently burned ponderosa pine stands in central Arizona. Ffolliott and others (1977) reported a 13 fold increase in the 
herbage production that lasted for at least 11 years after a prescribed fire in ponderosa pine south of our study area. 
Understory production on our study area was significantly higher on burned plots versus controls during the first growing 
season following the fire (Harris and Covington 1983). Nutrient concentrations in understory plants were also higher on 
burned sites. 
Although improved nutrient availability may be responsible for much of the observed increases in primary 
production following burning in ponderosa pine, other possible explanations such as better moisture relations, decreased 
allelopathy (see Jameson 1968, Lodhi and Killingbeck 1980), and extended growing season (because of warmer soil 
temperatures and earlier thaw in the spring, cf. Bissett and Parkinson (1980)) should not be ignored. 
 
CONCLUSION 
After one hundred years of fire exclusion from our study site, prescribed burning appears to have alleviated some of the 
problems attributed to the elimination of  periodic understory burning. Both woody debris and forest floor fuels were 
substantially reduced thus increasing the resistance of the ecosystem to damage by wildfire and reducing forest floor 
interception and evaporation of precipitation. Burning released much of the nutrients bound in the surface organic storages, 
improving nutrient conditions for both plants remaining after the fire and newly germinating seedlings. Although some 
nitrogen was lost to volatilization, these losses appear to be minimal. 
Of particular interest is the apparent microbial mineralization which occurred during the first 7 months after burning. 
Forest floor fuels were further reduced by this means, but without the risk of nutrient volatilization associated with fuel 
reduction by burning. 
 
The reintroduction of prescribed understory burning in ponderosa pine holds considerable promise not only as a means of 
controlling fuel loadings, but also through manipulating surface litter, of controlling nutrient and moisture relations, as well 
as reducing allelopathic effects, thereby improving ecosystem productivity.
