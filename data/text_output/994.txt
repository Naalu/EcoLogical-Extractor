The ﬁrst life cycle impact assessment for redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) forest management activities
(i.e. a cradle-to-sawmill gate input) including the growing, harvesting, and hauling of redwood sawlogs
to a sawmill was completed. In the stump-to-truck timber harvesting analysis, primary transport ac-
tivities such as skidding and yarding consumed the largest amount of fuel and consequently generated
the greatest environmental impacts (50% of the total) compared with the other harvesting stages (felling,
processing, and loading). Hauling sawlogs to the sawmill was also a major contributor to total green-
house gas emissions, representing 20% of total emissions. The most efﬁcient harvest method in terms of
fuel consumption per m3 of wood harvested was the manual ground-based system used in even-aged
silvicultural operations, followed by the skyline harvesting methods. Relative to even-aged silvicul-
tural systems, uneven-aged systems, often prescribed to meet environmental goals such as maintaining
biodiversity and protecting wildlife habitats, used 20% more fuel per m3 of redwood sawlogs harvested.
This was because uneven-aged systems required an increased number of entries to harvest the same
amount of wood as even-aged systems. The cradle-to-gate GHG emissions from redwood forest man-
agement activities including growing, harvesting and hauling the logs represent only 14% (17.13 kg CO2e/
m3) of the total GHG emissions (i.e. cradle-to-grave) associated with redwood decking lumber. The study
results showed substantial differences in environmental impacts for the various harvesting operations
and silvicultural systems for redwood forest management and operations. Therefore, the life cycle impact
assessment results for the various redwood harvesting and silvicultural systems should be carefully
considered when evaluating environmental performance of forest management activities along with
other objectives.

1. Introduction
Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) is a unique species that has a
limited natural range along the coastal zone of northern California
(Berrill et al., 2012). Redwood is commonly used to manufacture
outdoor decking because of its natural beauty and superior resis-
tance to decay (Wilcox and Piirto, 1976; Clark and Scheffer, 1983).
Consumers choose to use redwood decking or comparable products
based on a broad range of product attributes including price,
quality, durability and intended service application (Ganguly and
Eastin, 2009). In recent decades, the burdens that a particular
product may impose on human health and the physical environ-
ment are receiving increased consideration. In particular there is
increased public interest, and an ongoing debate, regarding the
environmental impacts associated with the manufacture, con-
sumption, disposal, and re-use of products that originate from the
forest (Bowyer et al., 2014).

To make informed product choices consumers need transparent,
scientiﬁcally veriﬁed, objective information. Life cycle inventory
(LCI) and life cycle assessment (LCA) are analytical techniques
commonly used to quantify the emission proﬁles and environ-
mental impacts of a wide range of products, respectively. The LCA
process is well deﬁned by international standards (ISO, 2006a;
2006b), and has been used extensively over the past decade to
quantify the environmental footprint of wood products (Puettmann
and Wilson, 2005), link forest management choices to environ-
mental performance indices in the forest (Lippke et al., 2005; Oneil
and Lippke, 2010), and track the carbon consequences of wood
product manufacturing and use (Lippke et al., 2010). The Con-
sortium for Research on Renewable Industrial Materials (CORRIM)
has documented the LCIs of the major wood products manufac-
tured in the US, but no work has been completed for redwood
decking products. Existing wood product data are publicly available
from the US LCI Database (2012).
This study reports on the environmental impacts of forest
resource management activities including the growing, harvesting,
and hauling of redwood sawlogs to the sawmill, referred to as a
forest resource cradle-to-gate LCA. The forest resource cradle-to-
gate LCA we report on here was part of a larger study (i.e. cradle-
to-grave)
that
included
the
redwood
decking
product
manufacturing processes, transportation to market, product use,
maintenance, and ﬁnal disposal (Bergman et al., 2013). To assess the
comprehensive
environmental
footprint
of
redwood
decking
lumber, the framework for data collection used in prior CORRIM
studies was adapted to gather the speciﬁc information needed to
produce the forest resources LCI for redwood decking.
The LCI and LCA methods measure the inputs and outputs per
unit of product manufactured so that it is easy to calculate the
embodied energy (the amount of energy required to manufacture a
product), emissions to land, air and water, and quantify the impacts
those emissions may have on the environment and human health
(ISO, 2006a; 2006b).
Forest management activities, including timber harvesting and
log hauling in California's forests, are required by law to follow the
California Forest Practices Rules which are some of the most
stringent regulations found in the United States today (Dicus and
Delﬁno, 2003). In addition, all ﬁrms surveyed for this project
manage their forests consistent with either Forest Stewardship
Council (FSC) or the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) certiﬁca-
tion standards which have additional requirements beyond those
speciﬁed in the California regulations. Given the stringent regula-
tions and certiﬁcation standards under which redwood forests are
managed, there is a high likelihood that the forests harvested to
produce redwood decking are sustainably harvested and will be for
the foreseeable future. For that reason we did not track carbon
increases and decreases in the forest as they are anticipated to be
negligible under the sustainable management regimes being
practiced in California today. Under these assumptions of sustain-
able forest management following ASTM International standard
D7612-10 (2010) and guide D7480-08 (2014), data were gathered
that reﬂect the current state of production and are reported
consistent with the protocols identiﬁed in the North American
Wood Product Category Rule (PCR; FPInnovations, 2013).
Environmental impacts associated with forest management
activities are documented for a wide variety of places and tree
species (Gonzalez-García et al., 2014; Dias and Arroja, 2012;
Cambria and Pierangeli, 2012) using life cycle inventory and
assessment methodologies. Results, some measured and others
simulated, show high variability among regions, species, and
management system. For example Dias and Arroja (2012) found a
global warming potential (GWP) for growth and harvest of pine and
eucalyptus in Portugal from 4.8 to 18.5 kg CO2e/m3. Cambria and
Pierangeli (2012) report a GWP of 120 kg/m3 for walnut in Italy
and Gonzalez-Garcia et al. (2013) report a GWP of 2.3 kg/m3
including bark for Douglas-ﬁr plantations in Germany. Data from
Johnson et al. (2005) and Oneil et al. (2010) were used to calculate
GWP for forest management operations in four US regions
(Puettmann et al., 2013a,b,c; Puettmann and Oneil, 2013) and found
values ranging from 9.41 to 14.52 kg CO2e/m3of logs (without bark).
Differences in methodology, boundary condition such as including
the fencing (Cambria and Pierangeli, 2012), or excluding hauling
(Johnson et al., 2005; Oneil et al., 2010) and functional unit deﬁ-
nition (i.e. with and without bark) contribute to this variability.
Even with uniform boundary conditions, methodology, and func-
tional unit there can still be substantial differences in environ-
mental performance, largely as a result of yield per hectare,
management intensity, and harvest system (Johnson et al., 2005;
Oneil et al., 2010; Diaz and Arroja, 2012).
No life cycle analysis has been conducted to quantify the envi-
ronmental footprint of redwood forest management activities in
northern California. Redwood growth, management, and harvest-
ing systems have some unique attributes that have not been
quantiﬁed elsewhere. For example, in certain visually and envi-
ronmentally sensitive areas, helicopters are used to remove logs
from the forest. The life cycle impact of this harvest system had not
been quantiﬁed before. Unlike other conifer species in North
America redwood sprouts from harvested roots therefore the effort
and time to regenerate redwood forests is greatly reduced. With
these differences in mind, the goal of this study was to estimate the
environmental impacts of redwood forest management activities
associated with the growing, harvesting, and hauling of redwood
sawlogs that are manufactured into redwood decking lumber.
Boundary conditions and functional unit used for this study were
the same as those used for Johnson et al. (2005) and Oneil et al.
(2010), but primary data which was collected on forest operations
on a speciﬁc species and region was expected to generate more
precise results.
2. Methods
The scope of this cradle-to-gate study was part of a larger
cradle-to-grave LCA analysis of redwood decking lumber that
focused on the life cycle of redwood forest resources (i.e. sawlog
production; Fig.1). This study conforms to internationally-accepted
standards (ISO, 2006a, 2006b), used primary data collected from
redwood forest landowners, as well as secondary data from the US
LCI Database (2012) which was used to model the LCI of redwood
forest resources using the SimaPro program. It includes an evalu-
ation of the following components:
 nursery operations to grow redwood tree seedlings
 ﬁll planting of redwood seedlings
 pre-commercial thinning of redwood forests
 commercial thinning of redwood forests
 commercial harvest of redwood sawlogs
 transportation of redwood sawlogs to sawmills
Some forest residues (i.e. logging slash) generated from timber
harvest activities were collected, ground up, and transported to
local energy plants when the biomass operations were economi-
cally feasible. Since the electricity produced from burning redwood
forest residues forms part of the regional power grid that supplies
electricity to redwood sawmills, the downstream contribution of
the logging slash was accounted for in a separate redwood decking
LCA analysis. While the redwood forest residues are an important
co-product of the cradle-to-grave redwood decking process, they
were not modeled as part of the present redwood harvesting life

cycle impact assessment (LCIA) to prevent double counting of these
beneﬁts.
2.1. Life cycle inventory data collection and analysis
LCI data are developed using a variety of techniques. In this
study, we collected primary data on forest management and har-
vesting operations using landowner surveys on four redwood forest
products companies in northern California that collectively repre-
sent 90% of redwood decking production. Our survey was to
develop representative timber harvest and raw material collection
data including measures of all material inputs such as labor use, and
fuel and lubrication per unit of collection activity. From these sur-
vey data we developed scenarios, identiﬁed representative equip-
ment proﬁles, and established average yield values. Yield was used
to calculate standing and harvested volume and biomass along
with many other stand characteristics at selected points in time
throughout the rotation age of the forest stand. Secondary data
were synthesized from existing data, including literature reviews,
published data sources, government and industry reports, and
synthesis of economic data.
The survey questionnaire covered elements of forest resource
management including stand establishment, intermediate forest
treatment, harvesting system proﬁles, transportation, and forest
residue recovery operations. Questions related to log harvest vol-
umes through the rotation age of the forest stand were also
included in the survey. The survey collected data for the year 2010.
The primary source of air emissions was from the combustion of
diesel fuel, gasoline, and jet fuel that was used to operate the
harvest equipment, log trucks and helicopters. Lubricants were
consumed through replacement at the end of its life and assumed
to be recycled. Emissions related to the fertilizers used to grow the
seedlings in the nursery were also estimated.
2.1.1. Stand establishment and forest inventory
Information collected in this section of the survey included
nursery operations,
seedling
planting
activities,
intermediate
treatment activities (fertilization and pre-commercial thinning),
types of silvicultural systems used (i.e. even-aged or uneven-aged),
rotation ages, and volume removals at each entry.
2.1.2. Harvesting systems and productivity
Landowners were asked to describe typical harvesting systems
and the type of equipment used to harvest timber from stump to
truck, including felling, primary transport (stump-to-landing),
processing, and loading. Three major types of harvesting systems
were surveyed: ground-based, skyline, and helicopter. These three
harvesting
systems
were
further
subdivided
based
on
the

ifornia redwood forests.

equipment type used and the harvest methods (i.e. uneven-aged,
even-aged) applied. Questions asked in this section were related
to harvesting productivity (i.e. thousand board feet (MBF)/h), cost
($/MBF), and fuel/oil consumption rates for each piece of harvesting
equipment used. Machine utilization rates were also surveyed and
used to adjust hourly productivity and fuel and lubrication con-
sumption rates.
2.1.3. Log hauling
Log hauling starts with loaded logs at the landing and ends
with unloading logs at the sawmill, a process referred to as sec-
ondary transport. Survey questions included truck types, horse
power, load volume per trip, and average speed of travel on ﬁve
different road categories (spur, dirt, gravel, 2-lane highway, and
interstate highway). Data included machine costs and fuel con-
sumption rates.
2.1.4. Slash treatments and biomass recovery for energy
This section of the survey was used to gather information on
activities associated with managing the slash resulting from timber
harvest, including percent utilization of trees cut, type of collection
equipment used, use of prescribed burning, and biomass recovery
operations for energy production. Productivity (ton/h), cost ($/ton),
and fuel consumption rates were obtained for biomass recovery
equipment and systems that are commonly used to recover forest
residues left from redwood sawlog harvesting. The data were used
to estimate the annual recovery volume (%) under current market
conditions for redwood sawlogs and biomass. Biomass hauling in-
formation was gathered using the same questions that were used
for log transportation.
The survey information was aggregated and summarized to
calculate weighted average values which represent the mean value
foreach categoryof interest. Each categoryof the survey information
was weighted based on each company's annual harvest volume,
silvicultural methods (uneven-aged or even-aged), and the type of
harvest system used (Fig. 2). The survey data summary and initial
calculationvalues wereentered intotheHarvestFactors spreadsheet
detailingthe input parameters needed fora complete forestresource
LCI (Johnson, 2008). The spreadsheet framework was developed for
previous CORRIM reports that summarize the LCI for wood products
in the US (Johnson et al., 2005; Oneil and Lippke, 2010).
2.2. Life cycle impact assessment
Data from the Harvest Factors spreadsheets were entered into
LCA modeling software package SimaPro 7.3 (PRe Consultants,
2013) which was used to estimate the environmental impacts to
the air and water from the redwood forest management activities.
Primary data summarized in the Harvest Factors spreadsheet were
entered into the SimaPro program using a functional unit of m3 for
sawlogs. Key input values included fuel and lubrication consump-
tion rates and volume of logs removed/hectare that varied based on
harvesting systems and silvicultural methods used. Each harvesting
system consisted of a set of machines which are commonly used to
harvest redwood sawlogs in northern California, with each ma-
chine consuming different amounts of fuel and lubricant.
The LCIA was summarized using the TRACI 2 v3.0 (Tool for the
Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and other environmental
Impacts) impact estimator which was developed by the US Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency (Bare, 2011). The impacts were
grouped into indicators including: global warming potential
(GWP), ozone depletion, smog, acidiﬁcation, eutrophication, carci-
nogenics, non-carcinogenics, ecotoxicity and respiratory effects.
Each environmental impact category was measured relative to a
common reference unit: GWP (carbon dioxide equivalents, CO2e);
ozone depletion (chloroﬂuorocarbon equivalents, CFC); smog
(ozone, O3); acidiﬁcation (mole of hydrogen ions, Hþ); carcino-
genics (benzene equivalents); non-carcinogenics (toluene equiva-
lents); and ecotoxicity (2.4-D equivalents). Respiratory effects were
quantiﬁed relative to the emissions of particulate matter that was
greater than or equal to 2.5 microns in size (PM 2.5). Eutrophica-
tion, the only impact category reported that was speciﬁc to emis-
sions to water, measures the impact of nitrogen emissions on water
quality and is reported in nitrogen equivalents (N-eq). The TRACI
method does not account for carbon dioxide emissions from
burning biomass consistent with existing EPA regulations. How-
ever, it does track other emissions associated with burning biomass,
such as those from methane.

2.3. Carbon accounting
Biomass in general and forests in particular have a large capacity
to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and store it in wood as a stable
form of carbon while releasing oxygen back into the atmosphere.
This process is referred to as carbon sequestration and because of
the perceived beneﬁt of forests as carbon sinks, great interest has
been shown regarding the forest carbon uptake and CO2 releases
related to various forest management and harvest practices. Carbon
uptake can be derived from the mass balance of wood and its
constituent components and is based on a simple formula that
includes speciﬁc gravity, the carbon content of wood, and the ratio
of carbon in a CO2 molecule. The carbon uptake factor calculated as
part of this study was derived from the following equation:
Carbon uptake factor for round wood ðkg CO2eÞ
¼ vol$sg$1000$CO2$C
Where,
 vol ¼ volume of wood harvested (m3)
 sg ¼ speciﬁc gravity of wood ¼ 0.36 for green redwood logs
when harvested
 1000 ¼ converting from speciﬁc gravity to a unit of kg/
m3CO2 ¼ CO2 uptake factor ¼ the ratio of the atomic mass of a
carbon dioxide molecule to the atomic mass of a carbon atom
(44:12; EPA, 2005)
 C ¼ carbon content of wood ¼ 0.53 as the mass of C per oven dry
unit of redwood (Jones and O'Hara, 2012)
The carbon uptake factor reﬂects how much carbon dioxide
equivalent (CO2e) is stored in the ﬁnal wood product which can
then be compared to the amount of CO2e emitted during the pro-
duction process. The amount of carbon uptake stored in the
growing trees was not included in calculating GWP in the present
(cradle-to-gate) study. Using the carbon uptake equation, the CO2
sequestered in the log plus bark was calculated for each silvicultural
system and a weighted average was generated for all logs delivered
to the sawmill. Bergman et al. (2013) estimated bark at 9.9% of the
wood volume with about 40% of the bark lost during log handling.
This lost bark was included in the carbon uptake calculation. For
one m3 of harvested redwood logs delivered to the mill gate, the
amount of carbon stored (including the bark) was equivalent to
1400 kg CO2 (Bergman et al., 2013).
2.4. Limitations of study
Since today's redwood harvest takes place predominantly in
second growth forests, we assumed that forest roads were already
in place. Forest roads also serve as infrastructure to support various
forest management activities that produce an array of wood
products. For these reasons the environmental effects of building
and maintaining forest roads were not included in the analysis.
Manufacturing and installing capital equipment and buildings have
generally a minor effect on the environment relative to the
throughput of products over the useful lives of the machines and
buildings (Mahalle and O'Connor, 2009), and therefore were also
excluded from the life-cycle analysis.
3. Results
Survey data were used to calculate weighted average values for
the forest management scenarios outlined in Tables 1e3. Infor-
mation collected included data on nursery operations (Table 1),
seedling planting activities (Table 2), and intermediate treatment
activities (fertilization and pre-commercial thinning), silvicultural
systems used, rotation ages, and volume removed at each entry
(Table 3). These data were collected on a per seedling and per ha
basis and then allocated to a per m3 functional unit basis based on
the amount of log volume recovered for each silvicultural and
harvesting system reported in the survey.
3.1. Timber harvest and biomass recovery operations
The redwood forest resource LCI provides weighted average
values for all inputs and outputs based on the percent allocation
between the silvicultural and harvesting systems that were used to
harvest redwood logs in northern California. The weighted average
values shown in Fig. 2 were determined from the data reported in
the 2010 surveys.
Silvicultural systems were classiﬁed into two general categories:
even-aged and uneven-aged. Within these categories there were
several variations that were driven by the inherent characteristics
of the trees that were being managed and the environmental
conditions that the trees encountered. In northern California, both
even-aged and uneven-aged systems were used in redwood forests.
The even-aged systems used clear-cutting at the ﬁnal harvest to
remove logs and open the area for regeneration. For even-aged
systems, the ﬁnal harvest generally occurred at age 50 using the
clear-cut method. The uneven-aged systems employed various
levels of thinning to harvest fewer trees at shorter intervals to
promote regeneration under the canopy of the existing forest. For
uneven-aged systems, harvesting generally occurred at 20 year
intervals for trees that are 60 years old. In 2010, a total of
814,492 m3 of redwood sawlogs were harvested by survey re-
spondents using both the uneven-aged (45%) and even-aged (55%)
silvicultural systems (Fig. 2).
There were four harvesting systems that were commonly used to
harvest redwood logs in northern California: manual ground-based,
mechanized ground-based (shovel yarding), skyline and helicopter
systems. Both manual and mechanical ground-based systems were
used to harvest trees on gentle slopes (<40% slope) while steep
slopes (>40% slope) usually required the use of a skyline yarding
system. Helicopter harvesting was occasionally used for environ-
mentally sensitive areas or for long yarding distances (>1000 m)
due to the lack of forest roads. The skyline yarding system was used
more often (44% e even and uneven-aged combined) than any
other harvest systems in 2010, followed by mechanized ground-
based (31%), and manual ground-based (23%). The helicopter sys-
tem was used to harvest only 2% of the total harvest in 2010.
Based on our survey, a total of 28,610 bone dry metric tons
(BDmT) of logging slash was collected and delivered to local energy

plants in 2010. Of that volume, 43% (or 12,302 BDmT) was redwood
logging slash (Fig. 2). Relative to even-aged operations, thinning
generated less logging slash making it more uneconomical and
therefore it was less common for biomass collection to occur in
forests that have been thinned. Even for even-aged units which
generate a high volume (100e240 ton/ha) of logging slash, the
economics of logging slash recovery operations and transportation
were not favorable given the current market value of ground slash
($45/BDmT) in the region. Despite the poor economic returns,
logging slash recovery was sometimes used as a site preparation
technique in place of burning the logging slash on site. Burning
biomass from agricultural and forestry sources for electricity rep-
resents 1.8% (2008 e-grid data) of the California grid (EPA, 2012)
and therefore the gains from using this material for generating
electricity are already represented in the e-grid data used in the
LCA analysis. For that reason, the electricity produced from burning
redwood forest residues was not included in the LCIA.
3.2. Fuel and lubricant consumption during harvesting activities
Surveys indicated that uneven-aged silvicultural systems that
rely on thinning used less fuel and lubricant to perform harvest
operations than did even-aged systems that rely on clear-cut
methods, but hourly harvesting production rates (m3/h) for thin-
ning operations were lower than for clear-cutting operations. These
differences resulted in higher fuel and lubricant consumption per
m3 of redwood sawlogs harvested for uneven-aged harvest systems
compared to even-aged silvicultural systems (Table 4). For the
skyline method, there was 20.19% more fuel used per m3 of logs
harvested for the uneven-aged system compared to an even-aged
system. Skyline harvesting system used the same or similar
equipment for both uneven-aged and even-aged systems.
There were also large differences in harvesting productivity and
fuel consumption among the logging systems used to harvest
redwood timber in northern California. The helicopter system
consumed substantially more fuel and lubricant than any other
system. Helicopter yarding alone consumed 624.59 L per hour.
Helicopter yarding productivity was also the highest of all systems
(37.93 m3/h in uneven-aged system), resulting in 16.46 L of fuel
consumption per m3 of wood harvested, which was approximately
six times the weighted average for all other yarding systems.
However, the helicopter systems also operated over longer average
yarding distances than the ground-based or skyline systems. The
most efﬁcient harvest method in terms of fuel consumption/m3 of
wood harvested was the manual ground-based system used in
even-aged silvicultural operations, followed by skyline harvesting
methods. The mechanized ground-based harvesting system used a
high volume of fuel (130.97 L per hour) for stump-to-truck har-
vesting (second highest after helicopter logging), with a corre-
sponding high production volume. This system was therefore more
efﬁcient on a liter/m3 basis than both the manual ground-based and
skyline systems that were used for thinning in uneven-aged silvi-
cultural operations (Table 4).
On a per m3 basis, the primary transport activities (e.g., skidding
and yarding) used the highest amounts (40e93%) of the total fuel
consumed for the stump-to-truck harvest, followed by loading,
felling and processing. Fuel and lubricant consumption for primary
transport activities was highly dependent on the skidding or
yarding distance which varied by terrain and therefore by the type
of system used. The survey results indicated that the average
yarding distances for each harvesting system were: ground-based
(100e450
m);
skyline
(230e450
m);
and
helicopter
(600e1500 m). Using the mid-point of these ranges, fuel con-
sumption rates for primary transport in uneven-aged silvicultural
operations were 0.0118, 0.0088, and 0.0157 L/m3 per m of one way
yarding distance for the ground-based, skyline and helicopter
systems,
respectively.
The
overall
average
yarding
distance,
weighted based on the harvest volume using each harvesting sys-
tem, was 202 m. Gasoline powered chainsaws were the most
common tool for felling and processing redwood logs: 77% of the
felling and processing tasks were performed using a chainsaw.
Helicopters used jet fuel while all other harvesting equipment and
log truck used diesel fuel.
The most common method used for logging slash recovery op-
erations in northern California consisted of a loader placing slash
into modiﬁed dump trucks that hauled the slash to a centralized
grinding location. The slash was then ground using a grinder and
loaded onto large vans for transport to an energy plant. The 1050-
horse power grinder burned 3.68 L of fuel per 27.21 BDmT of slash
processed, which represented 60.8% of the total fuel consumed
during
the
stump-to-truck
biomass
recovery
operation.
The
average haul distance for the modiﬁed dump trucks was 1.28 km
with a fuel consumption rate of 0.93 L/BDmT.
3.3. Transportation of sawlogs and biomass
Hauling sawlogs and biomass used different transportation
methods. A 475-horse power, stinger-steered logging truck was
commonly used to haul sawlogs from the forest landing to the
sawmill. A 92-m3 capacity highway-chip van was used for hauling
biomass from a grinding location to an energy plant. Hauling routes
were classiﬁed into ﬁve road categories to account for the variation
in average traveling speed by road category. The distance traveled
on each road class and average traveling speed was used to calculate
a total round trip time which determined the amount of fuel and oil
consumed. The ﬁve road categories for hauling sawlogs were: spur
roads (0.8 km at 17.54 km/h), dirt roads (3.22 km at 20.92 km/h),
gravel roads (11.43 km at 32.19 km/h), 2-lane highway (14.65 km at
55.84 km/h), and interstate freeway (22.53 km at 81.27 km/h). Chip
vans traveled on only three different road categories: gravel roads
(16.09 km at 32.19 km/h), 2-lane highway (3.22 km at 55.84 km/h),
and interstate freeway (56.33 km at 81.27 km/h). The fuel and
lubricant consumption rates in Table 5 are average values for log
transportation including loading and unloading times.
3.4. Carbon uptake
The average volume of material harvested was calculated as part
of the evaluation and the volume varied considerably depending on
the silvicultural system used. Redwood log yielded averaged

removed 290.17 m3/ha of redwood sawlogs at each 50-year inter-
val. In mixed conifer stands, additional volumes of other timber
species were removed during harvest, but this timber volume was
not included in this analysis which was focused solely on redwood
as an input into redwood decking production (Bergman et al.,
2014).
The total carbon uptake in the redwood forests that were
managed using an uneven-aged silvicultural system was 77,894 kg/
ha over 20 years or 3895 kg/ha-yr while it was 225,740 kg/ha over
50 years or 4515 kg/ha-yr in the redwood forests that were
managed using an even-aged silvicultural system. The differences
in carbon uptake between the two systems reﬂected the difference
in the log volume removed on a per hectare basis since uneven-
aged systems removed about one-third of the total standing trees

at each entry whereas even-aged systems removed all trees in areas
designated for harvest during each entry. For even-aged systems,
some trees were retained for water quality protection and to pro-
vide habitat functionality along designated riparian zones and
wildlife areas adjacent to harvest areas.
3.5. Life cycle inventory and life cycle impact assessments from
redwood forest management activities
The emissions to air values reported in the LCI for the six
different harvesting operations and the log hauling operational
stage are summarized in Table 6. The environmental impact results
for GWP, acidiﬁcation, carcinogenics, non-carcinogenics, respira-
tory effects, eutrophication, ozone depletion, ecotoxicity and smog
are shown in Table 7, for each silvicultural system, harvesting
method, and operations phase with a total weighted average and
percent allocation by the sawlog volume harvested in 2010. While
there were slight variations in the individual impact indicator
rankings between the silvicultural systems, harvest methods, and
operations, all followed a pattern similar to that shown for GWP in
Fig. 3 and therefore we used GWP as an example to explain the
environmental impact differences between harvest systems and
methods. Fig. 3 shows that uneven-aged silvicultural systems had
slightly higher greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) measured in kg of
CO2e as compared to the even-aged silvicultural systems. This was
most noticeable with the helicopter harvesting operations. The
GHG emissions from the other harvesting systems were similar,
ranging from 14.21 kg CO2e (manual ground-based, even-aged) to
17.76 (manual ground-based, uneven-aged) kg CO2e. These varia-
tions were directly correlated to the number of entry for timber
harvesting and the amount of fuel and lubricant consumed per m3
of logs during harvesting operations.
Transporting the log or tree from stump to a landing (i.e. skid-
ding and yarding), referred as to primary in-woods transport,
generated the highest level of environmental impacts, almost 50%
of the GWP (Fig. 4). The second highest level (about 20%) of emis-
sions was generated from hauling logs from the landing area to the
sawmill, based on an average 52-km one way hauling distance. The
environmental impacts generated from stand establishment ac-
tivities were minimal at less than 2% of the total impacts. The
weighted average GHG emissions emitted from stand establish-
ment, harvesting, and hauling activities to supply redwood sawlogs
to sawmills was 17.13 kg CO2e/m3 which is consistent with
roundwood supply chain results reported by Handler et al. (2014)
and Timmermann and Dibdiakova (2014). Since that same m3 of
redwood logs contains 1400 kg CO2e, the net balance of the system
was a 1382.7 kg CO2e and the carbon stored in the logs was 81.7
times (¼1400/17.13 kg CO2e/m3) the GHG released during these
operations. In other words, the amount of carbon stored (seques-
tered) in the ﬁnal wood product far exceeded the amount of carbon
released into the atmosphere during the planting, thinning, har-
vesting and hauling of the logs to the sawmill.
3.6. Environmental impacts from logging slash recovery and
hauling operations
The LCI calculated emissions to air, water or land from logging
slash recovery and hauling operations (Table 8). The LCIA results for
the same operations are given in Table 9. Hauling biomass to an
energy plant over a 76 km one-way hauling distance resulted in
higher impacts for all nine impact categories (55.1% of the total) on
the environment than did all the other logging slash recovery
operation activities combined. These results were largely due to the
amount of fuel consumed during the transport phases associated
with the slash recovery operation (0.109 L/BDmT) in the forest and
transporting the ground biomass to the power generation facility
(0.134 L/BDmT). In addition, the grinding process represented the
second largest contribution to the impact categories, accounting for
27.3% of the total environmental impact.
4. Discussion
On a per m3 basis, primary in-woods transport activities such as
skidding and yarding represented the largest fuel consuming ac-
tivities in stump-to-truck timber harvesting operations, ranging
from 39% (mechanized ground-based system for even-aged) to 93%
(helicopter system for uneven-aged) of the total fuel consumption
(Table 4). Skyline yarding activities for even-aged and uneven-aged
used approximately 64% and 71%, respectively, of the total fuel
consumption for each m3 of redwood sawlogs harvested. It should
be noted that the helicopter yarding distances (600e1500 m) were
much longer than the distance used for the ground-based
(100e450 m) and skyline systems (230e450 m), which explains
in part the increase in fuel consumption for helicopter yarding
relative to ground-based and skyline harvesting systems. Helicop-
ter harvesting is often used in environmentally sensitive areas such
as riparian zones and roadless areas because it causes little soil
disturbance as the logs are lifted into the air and there is no log

dragging or machine travel in the woods. The trade-off in using this
kind of harvest system to reduce soil disturbance and maintain
visual aesthetics is that it generates LCI impacts that are much
higher than any other harvesting system per m3 of wood harvested.
The impact from helicopter yarding was higher than other primary
transport systems evaluated across all the LCI categories we eval-
uated (Table 7).
It was expected that primary transport activity would use the
most fuel of all timber harvesting activities because of the heavy-
duty machines utilized in these operations and because this ac-
tivity was the most time-consuming of all of the timber harvesting
activities. However, the percentage was highly variable, reﬂecting
differences in machine types and silvicultural methods used as well
as skidding or yarding distances. Johnson et al. (2005) presented
similar outcomes to these ﬁndings, but the percentages for those
were not reported.
Silvicultural systems used also directly affected fuel consump-
tion during timber harvesting activities. Uneven-aged systems
required more frequent entries to the forest stand over the life of
the stand while harvesting less volume per entry, as compared to
even-aged. Uneven-aged system using skyline thinning operations
removed less volume and used about the same amount of fuel per
hour, which resulted in 4.2 L/m3 of fuel being consumed whereas
the same method used during the ﬁnal harvest in an even-aged
system used 3.5 L of fuel per m3 of logs harvested. This repre-
sented a 20% increase in fuel consumption for sawlog harvesting in
uneven-aged over even-aged systems. Although an uneven-aged
system is often prescribed to meet environmental goals such as
maintaining biodiversity and protecting wildlife habits, it resulted
in higher air quality impacts compared to even-aged silvicultural
systems (Table 7 and Fig. 3). This increase was largely driven by
increased fuel usage due to the increased number of entries into the
stand, efﬁciency losses caused by having to work around residual
trees, and removal of less volume per unit area compared to an
uneven-aged system.
Excluding hauling, the weighted average GWP for redwood
harvesting (13.73 kg CO2e) (Table 7) was higher than the compa-
rable values for the Paciﬁc Northwest (9.41), Southeast (11.32), and
Inland Northwest (10.14) regions, but lower than the Northeast
(14.52) region of the US (Puettmann et al., 2013a,b,c; Puettmann
and Oneil, 2013) when taking into account the same boundary
condition (i.e. excluding hauling logs to the sawmill as was done in
the other US regions.)
Hauling sawlogs and biomass to a market was a major
contributor to the emission impacts associated with forest man-
agement activities. Of the total environmental impacts associated
with
harvesting
and
transportation
activities,
sawlog
trans-
portation to the sawmill and biomass transportation to the power
generation facility represented 20% and 55% of the total, respec-
tively (Tables 7 and 9). Biomass transportation showed a higher
percentage than sawlog transportation because the hauling dis-
tance for biomass was longer (76 km vs. 52 km) and the hourly fuel
consumption for a truck with chip van was higher (33.04 L vs.
20.41 L) than for a log truck. The one-way forest road distances for
hauling sawlogs and biomass reported for this study were 15.4 and
19.2 km, respectively. This distinction was important because
hauling speeds were slow (16e40 km/h) on forest roads. These
included spur, single-lane and double-lane dirt and gravel roads
and the resulting fuel consumption per hour was higher than for
paved highway roads. Fuel consumption for hauling sawlog and
biomass increases with hauling distance, but the relationship was
generally non-linear because consumption was determined not
only by hauling distance but also by road conditions and road type
(e.g., dirt forest road vs. paved highway). For example, Johnson et al.
(2012) noted that the overall whole tree chipping fuel consumption
increased to 16.23 L/BDmT over a distance of 145 km compared to
8.52 L/BDmT for a distance of 48 km. For this reason an analysis
based on time traveled on each road type combined with total
distance was used to accurately assess the relative impacts asso-
ciated with transportation.
Biogenic carbon is part of the natural carbon cycle. Living trees
uptake carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and sequester carbon
in the cellular structure of the wood while emitting the resultant
oxygen back into the atmosphere. When trees die, they release
biogenic carbon, either rapidly during ﬁre events or more slowly
during decay. Within this cycle, carbon is sequestered in the forest
as living trees, but it can also be exported and sequestered in solid
wood products. Our carbon uptake calculations showed that more
carbon was exported from the forest per year in even-aged forest
management systems (4515 kg/ha-yr) than in uneven-aged sys-
tems (3895 kg/ha-yr). The carbon that was exported was stored in
long lived wood products as quantiﬁed in the ﬁndings of Bergman
et al. (2013).
The higher yield of wood volume per ha in even-aged systems
might reﬂect greater removal rates than for uneven-aged systems
Fig. 3. Greenhouse gas emissions from uneven-aged and even-aged harvest units. This
ﬁgure shows greenhouse gas emissions from uneven-aged and even-aged harvest
units to produce 1-m3 of redwood sawlogs using three different harvesting and
transportation systems each.

tive global warming impacts from each phase of redwood sawlog harvesting activities.

during the period covered by this analysis. Over the long term, in
forests that are continuously managed for wood production the
volume removed per ha must be balanced by growth through
sustainable forest management practices. If harvest during the
period of study was in line with the growth increment, then the
higher yield likely reﬂected inherent differences in site productivity
across our study area and between areas managed using the two
silvicultural systems in question. Higher quality sites would pro-
duce more volume/ha per year, but site productivity data were not
collected as part of this study. A third possibility was that histori-
cally regeneration success and growth in the stands managed using
an uneven-aged system was lower due to excessive shading (O'Hara
and Berrill, 2010) and therefore the volume available for harvest
was reduced.
The total emissions related to the production of redwood
decking (i.e. cradle-to-grave) including redwood forest manage-
ment activities were calculated in a separate study (Bergman et al.,
2013). Their paper suggested that the emissions from redwood
forest management activities for GWP, ozone depletion, smog,
acidiﬁcation, and eutrophication were 14%, 2%, 56%, 75%, and 48%,
respectively, of the total cradle-to-grave analysis of redwood
decking. It was noted that the environmental impact factors (e.g.,
GWP and ozone depletion) from the redwood forest management
activities were relatively high when compared to the full cradle-to-
grave LCA values for other species producing sawlogs. The 14% of
GWP impact for the redwood forest management activities
component of the cradle-to-grave redwood LCA was higher than for
the typical cradle-to-gate mill input values for most other wood
product manufacturing LCAs. This was primarily because redwood
decking used minimal kiln drying which substantially lowered the
cumulative
energy
consumed
during
redwood
decking
manufacturing relative to many other wood products (Bergman
et al., 2014). Typically, primary energy consumed in forest man-
agement activities is less than 5% of the primary energy consumed
during
the
cradle-to-gate
wood
product
production process
(Puettmann and Wilson, 2005; Puettmann et al., 2010) and primary
energy use correlates well with the listed impact categories.
5. Conclusions
This was the ﬁrst study to use LCIA methods to quantify the
environment impacts related to redwood forest management
practices
including
stand
establishment,
intermediate
forest
treatment, harvesting system proﬁles, and hauling to supply red-
wood sawlogs. Redwood is a unique species naturally growing
along the coast of northern California. It is well known as a natu-
rally durable material for producing wood decking products and
other wood construction materials. Forest management practices
to grow redwood trees are somewhat different than other North
American conifers due to its unique ability to sprout from stumps,
fast growth, and high yield per hectare. However, post regeneration
practices found in redwood forests including silvicultural systems
(even-aged and uneven-aged) and harvest systems (ground-based,
skyline and helicopter) are in other US forests as well.

associated with the overall forest management activities. Our study
conﬁrmed the study results from other studies that timber har-
vesting
and
transportation
activities
were
a
major
(>90%)
contributor to the overall carbon emissions. In addition, we found
that primary in-woods transport activities such as skidding and
yarding consumed fuels far more than other activities (felling,
processing, and loading) in stump-to-truck timber harvesting op-
erations. These results were especially noticeable with helicopter
and skyline harvesting systems, compared with ground-based op-
erations. Hauling sawlogs to the sawmill represented the second
highest activity of consuming fuels at a 52-km of one-way hauling
distance, which would be signiﬁcantly increased with increase of
hauling
distance.
Further,
uneven-aged
silvicultural
systems
resulted in higher fuel consumption compared to even-aged silvi-
cultural systems. The emissions and the resulting environmental
impacts associated with different timber harvesting activities and
silvicultural systems have not been explicitly documented in other
papers. This study shows substantial differences in harvesting op-
erations and silvicultural systems that impact the LCIA of forest
management and operations. These differences should be carefully
considered when evaluating the environmental performance of
forest management choices, both in terms of forest operations and
silvicultural systems. For example, when harvesting redwood
sawlogs, one could vary the application of even- and uneven-aged
silvicultural systems to minimize overall environmental impacts. In
addition, this paper provides LCIA results for harvesting redwood
sawlogs using helicopters while protecting environmentally sen-
sitive areas and not building roads.
Some other studies often relied on average values obtained for a
large region (e.g. western US or the entire US) based on secondary
literature sources. However, all the data used for this study repre-
sented surveyed results of harvesting productivity and fuel con-
sumption from redwood forest landowners. Because of their
speciﬁcity, the results from this study need to be carefully evaluated
as to their appropriateness for use in other places and forest types.
This study did not consider the environmental impacts related to
road maintenance and construction or the manufacture of forest
harvesting equipment. Including these items would alter the ﬁnal
results presented in this paper and for regions where new infra-
structure is needed, these elements would need to be included in
the analysis.
