Feedstocks generated from processing forest residues have traditionally been considered as a low value
product. The economic potential of these materials can be enhanced by emerging biomass conversion
technologies, such as torrefaction, briquetting, and gasiﬁcation; however, these systems require higher
quality feedstock. The objective of this study was to determine the cost of processing and sorting forest
residues to produce feedstock, so that the best comminution machines (i.e. chipper vs. grinder) could be
used to better control feedstock size distribution. The tree tops left from sawlog processing and small-
diameter trees were delimbed and separated from the slash pile. Three harvest units were selected
and each unit was divided into three sub-treatment units (no-, moderate, and intensive sorting). Results
showed that the cost of operations were higher for the sorted sub-units when compared to the non-
sorted. The total cost of operation (felling to loading) for sawlogs was lowest at 40.81 $ m3 in the
nosorting treatment unit, followed by moderate (42.25 $ m3) and intensive treatment unit (44.75 $
m3). For biomass harvesting, the cost of operation (felling to delimbing and sorting) ranged from 27 to
29 $ oven dry metric ton1. The most expensive operational phase was primary transportation; therefore,
cost of treating the forest residues had less impact on the overall cost. The cost increase (1150 $ ha1) of
sorting forest residues could offset cost savings from avoided site preparation expenses (1100 $ ha1),
provided that the forest residues were utilized.

1. Introduction
Forest residues generated from timber harvesting operations, in
the form of dead trees, branches, tree tops, chunks (offcuts), non-
merchantable tree species and small-diameter trees, have tradi-
tionally been regarded as economically low value products. These
by-products are generally utilized as feedstock for energy produc-
tion, as they are widespread, renewable, and can be used to offset
the use of fossil fuels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions [1].
In regions where there are markets for biomass or pulp, a variety
of treatments, including debarking stems, removing foliage, ﬁeld
drying, etc. are carried out [2,3]. Such treatments have been found
to
accelerate
drying,
reduce
contamination,
and
eventually
enhance the quality of the feedstock [4]. The cost associated with
these treatments, while documented, often cannot be compared,
because the harvest operations are species, site, and practice
speciﬁc [5]. However, documenting these operations can help in
formulating speciﬁc strategies that can be adopted in regions with
limited bioenergy markets.
In northern California, approximately 157 and 110 oven dry
metric tons (ODMT) ha1 of forest residues can be recovered from a
typical even-age managed ground-based and cable yarding oper-
ations, respectively [6]. However, the markets (primarily restricted
to wood based power plants) for these woody biomass are limited
by the transportation distance due to the low price [7]. This means,
forest residues generated from most of the timber harvest units out
of the power plant procurement regions are piled and burned on-
site. These slash burning are additionally restricted to speciﬁc
burn windows of the year [8]; and can have a negative impact on air
quality and human health [9].
One of the greatest barriers for utilizing traditional feedstock is
due to the low price paid by the prevailing markets such as power
plants. This price (approximately 50 $ BDT1) in large prohibits
from implementing any commercial biomass removal projects
[10,11]. Emerging biomass conversion technologies (BCT) such as
torrefaction, briquette, and gasiﬁcation can increase the economic

potential of these residues. However, to meet the feedstock speci-
ﬁcations set by BCTs, the forest residues will have to be treated to
minimize
contamination,
facilitate
comminution
via
chipper,
reduce moisture content, and improve handling/transportation
efﬁciency [12]. As the conventional practice of biomass removal in
the region stacks all forest residues into one pile, the only form of
comminution
is
limited
to
grinding
which
produces
non-
homogenous sized feedstock (hog fuels) [13]. Hog fuels has
inherent low quality in terms of size distribution (typically having
larger particle size compared to that from chipper) and can nega-
tively affect fuel conveyance and productivity of the follow up
conversion processes [14]. Additionally, piling tree stumps and
chunks along with other forest residues (like tree-tops) can intro-
duce soil contaminants in to the feedstock [15]. All these become
major barriers in the economic feasibility of conversion into value
added forest products.
The overall goal of this study was to produce high quality (i.e.,
less contamination from dirt, and uniform in size) feedstock
through sorting and processing (delimbing) tree tops generated
from integrated timber harvesting operations, which could be
further chipped rather than grinded to produce uniform size
feedstock (Fig. 1). The speciﬁc objective of this study was to eval-
uate and compare the cost of treatment (i.e., sorting and processing
forest residues) with the conventional harvesting practice of piling
all forest residues together. The study also investigated the differ-
ences in cost associated with varying degrees of processing and
sorting forest residues and evaluated the impacts of the treatments
from a managerial perspective.
2. Methodology
2.1. Deﬁning terminologies used in this study
 Forest residue: Materials generated from timber harvesting
operation other than sawlogs that are typically of lesser or no
economic
value.
These were further classiﬁed
into
non-
merchantable trees, small-diameter trees, slash, and tree tops.
 Non-merchantable
tree
species:
Trees
species
which
are
currently not in demand in the sawlog market in northern
California; for e.g., hardwood species, such as tanoak (Notholi-
thocarpus densiﬂorus (Hook. & Arn.) Manos et al.). They are used
as feedstock for energy purpose, or ﬁrewood.
 Small-diameter trees: Trees of both non-merchantable and
sawlog species having a diameter at breast height (dbh) less
than 20 cm and are not generally accepted by sawmills for
lumber manufacturing in northern California. The size of the
merchantable timber varies from region.
 Slash: The component within the forest residues generated from
sawlog processing
typically consisting of
chunks,
foliage,
branches and other broken material not appropriate to be
comminuted by a chipper.
 Tree tops: The wood material within bole (main stem) from
15 cm diameter level onwards to the tip of the crown for both
conifer and hardwood trees. The tree tops were further divided
into two sections:
- Processed tree tops: Tree tops delimbed (foliage removed
along the entire length) to the top 15 cm length.
- Unprocessed tree tops: The intensive sorting treatment had an
unprocessed tree top sort for conifer and hardwood trees,
which were not delimbed and had branches with leaves and
needles still attached to them.
 Sawlog component: Merchantable trees with a diameter at
breast height (dbh) of 20 cm or greater which will be eventually
processed to lumber at a saw mill. In northern California, only
softwoods had sawlog markets.
2.2. Stand and site description
The study site comprised of three even-age managed stands on

an industrial timberland property in Humboldt County, California
(410201800 N, 1235503500 W) (Fig. 2). The sites primarily consisted
of even-aged (averaging 60 years) second-growth coast redwood
(Sequoia sempervirens (D. Don) Endl.), Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga
menziessii (Mirb.) Franco), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla
(Raf.) Sarg.), and tanoak. The elevation ranged from 520 to 730 m
above mean sea-level with ground slopes up to 111% (48). The
climate for the region is characterized by maritime inﬂuence from
the Paciﬁc Ocean, and receives approximately 119 cm of rain
annually, with an average temperature of around 11 C [16].
2.3. Experimental designs and treatments
Three ﬁeld-based treatments were carried out to investigate the
effects of sorting and processing forest residues at varying intensities
on the productivity and cost of sawlog and biomass operation.
The timber harvest units were located approximately 1.6 km apart
from each other. Each unit was further subdivided into three equal
sub-units, which were assigned one of the following treatments:
1. No sorting: Typical residue management prescription adopted
by timber landowners in the region, therefore regarded “busi-
ness as usual”. The focus of the processor in this treatment was
on the sawlogs. Forest residues generated from sawlog pro-
cessing were piled near the log landing area. Piles consisted of
tree tops, chunks, branches, broken logs, foliage, and small-
diameter trees. However, hardwood trees (non-merchantable)
were decked separately.

2. Moderate sorting: The tree tops were processed and sorted into
conifer and hardwood piles by the processor and separated from
the slash. Broken logs and small-diameter trees were also pro-
cessed and piled along with the tops. The processed material
could be comminuted using a chipper for accomplishing uni-
form size distributed particles.
3. Intensive sorting: The most rigorous form of sorting in the study
with an intention to generate feedstock for both grinder and
chipper. The processed forest residues were piled into ﬁve
categories:
a. Processed conifer tops (PC)
b. Unprocessed conifer tops (UC)
c. Processed hardwood tops (PH)
d. Unprocessed hardwood tops (UH)
e. Slash
A stand inventory was done at 10% sampling intensity (0.04 ha
ﬁxed-radius circular plots) using a systematic sampling design
(Table 1). All three units were clear-cut and both sawlog and
biomass components were brought to the landing. The operations
were decoupled, with each machine ahead of the consecutive
machine by one week: for example, a feller-buncher operated one
week before a shovel machine moved into the unit. All three
treatments were operated by the same harvesting machines and
operators, except for felling. The operation spanned over two
months during the summer of 2014.
2.4. Cycle elements for each harvesting activity phase
To calculate delay-free cycle times, a detailed time study was
conducted using standard work study techniques [17]. Elemental
time-motion data were recorded by a centi-minute stop watch for
each machine. Additionally, predictor variables hypothesized to
affect cycle time were recorded for each cycle element (Table 2).
Delays were deﬁned as all activities that did not directly contribute
to the production of the operation, and were classiﬁed into three
categories: personal, mechanical, and operational. They were
recorded to better understand factors inﬂuencing productivity and
not to quantify utilization rates for the machines in these systems
[18].
2.4.1. Felling and bunching
Sorting of forest residues began with the feller-buncher. Same
make and model of feller-buncher (John Deer 959K) was used in all
three units; which separated the biomass from the sawlog trees, as
opposed to bunching them together or using the forest residues as
“slash mats”. There were two operators and machines during the
study. In Units 1 and 2 felling was done by one operator while a
different operator and machine felled trees in the third. The cycle
time started when the machine released a tree and traveled empty
to the next tree (travel empty) followed by cutting the tree (cutting
time). The machine then rotated while loaded, and placed the tree
in an existing pile or bunch (bunching time), ending the cycle.
Distances for various phases of the cycle were visually estimated.
2.4.2. Shovel yarding (primary transportation)
The primary transportation (stump to landing) was done using a
shovel machine (Caterpillar 568) equipped with a log grapple,
which brought all trees to roadside for processing. At the landing,
trees were separated into conifers (sawlogs), and biomass piles.
Total delay-free cycle for the shovel was calculated in a series of
steps. First, individual swing cycle time for each shovel turn was
calculated. The swing cycle time started when the machine traveled
empty to a pile/bunch of trees (travel empty), swung empty to a pile
(swing empty), grappled the trees (grappling time), rotated loaded
to a new pile/bunch and completed the cycle when the machine
dropped the trees or compacted them into another pile/bunch
(swing loaded). Often the shovel loader travelled with a load to the
nearest bunch (travel loaded). On other occasions, loaded time
ended without reaching the full stretch of the 17-m boom (trees
were placed in between). This was done primarily to adjust the
orientation of grappled trees or re-grapple (to get a better grip)
them. These cycles were noted during data collection and were
regarded as partial cycles, which were later combined to get a
whole cycle. The average yarding distance (AYD) was measured for
each sub-unit (Fig. 3). Total cycle time was calculated by multi-
plying AYD with swing cycle time and dividing by the average of
swing distances (SD) per cycle.
Swing cycle time ¼ travel empty þ swing empty
þ grappling time þ swing loaded
þ travel loaded
Total cycle time ¼ Swing cycle time  AYD
SD
For swing empty and swing loaded, swing arcs were visually
estimated in degrees traversed, and was broadly divided into 45,
90, and 180. Trees handled in each grapple cycle were categorized
to biomass or sawlog trees. In addition, the shovel direction (uphill
vs. downhill), walking distance (distance travelled by the shovel
machine to reach a pile, without load), distance loaded (distance
travelled by the shovel machine with load), and swinging distance
(distance of the wood getting displaced during each swing move-
ment) were recorded (Table 2).
2.4.3. Processing
A dangle-head processor (John Deere 2454D with Waratah
processing head) processed sawlogs and biomass trees at the log

landing at varying levels of intensities for the three different
treatments (Fig. 4). During sawlog processing, the processor
delimbed tree tops up to the tip of trees for moderate and intensive
sorting treatments. Processed tree tops were separated from the
slash and sorted into two piles (based on species) for the moderate
sorting treatment and four (PC, UC, PH, UH) for the intensive
sorting. Sawlogs were separated based on species into three conifer
(Douglas ﬁr, western hemlock and coast redwood) piles.
The cycle time for processing began when the dangle head
swung empty to the log deck (swing empty). This was followed by
grappling the log (grapple time), swing loaded, processing the log,
and ending the cycle when the sawlog was placed in a deck (pro-
cessing time). Processing and sorting time for the biomass was
calculated by recording the extra time spent on tree tops for pro-
cessing and sorting it in separate decks. The length of a processed
sawlog was divided into three categories: short logs (4 m long and
smaller), medium logs (4e11 m long), and long logs (11 m and
longer). This classiﬁcation was done to simplify data collection, as it
was difﬁcult to visually estimate the log lengths during processing.
2.4.4. Loading and sorting (sawlogs)
Loading and sorting (by a loader) was exclusively done for
sawlogs by a John Deere 2954D. Both phases had similar cycle time
elements, which started when the machine swung empty to deck of
sawlog (swing empty). This was followed by grappling the sawlog
(grapple time), and swing loaded ended when the sawlog were

piles (sorting).
2.5. Machine rate calculation
Purchase prices, salvage values, economic life, utilization rate,
wages and beneﬁts for crew were obtained from the timberland
company which owned and operated the equipment (Table 3).
Accordingly, all machinery was assumed to have 10-years of eco-
nomic life while working 2200 scheduled machine hours (SMH) per
year with a machine utilization rate set at 80%. Diesel price was set
at 1.01 $ liter1, which reﬂected average local market prices during
the study. Hourly machine costs in dollars per scheduled machine
hour ($ SMH1) were calculated using standard machine rate
calculation methods [19].
The cost and productivity for harvesting sawlog and biomass
components were analyzed separately.
Joint products allocation was used to estimate the cost for the
different operational phases [20]. The elemental cycle for biomass
trees (non-merchantable species and small-diameter trees) were
recorded separately for each machine, based on tree species and
butt-end diameter (Table 2). For primary transportation, as all trees
were hauled together, a volumetric ratio of biomass trees to sawlog
trees brought to the landing was ﬁrst determined from the shov-
eling dataset and allometric equations. The total cost of the shov-
eling operation, calculated from machine rates, was then allocated
for each component based on this ratio. The tree tops were
assumed to have a free ride with sawlogs until the processing phase
(by-product allocation; [20]). The unit cost of sawlog harvesting
consisted of felling, shoveling, processing, sorting and loading;
whereas biomass trees only included cost associated with felling to
processing and sorting of tree top.
The average sawlog piece size was determined in cubic meter for
each sub-unit by randomly scaling 991 sawlogs from different log
decks. Average number of sawlog pieces per tree (needed to
calculate the productivity of feller-buncher and shovel machine)
was estimated during processing for each species (Table 2). Local-
ized allometric equations were used to calculate the weight for
biomass trees and volume for sawlog [21e23].
Regression models were developed using IBM SPSS Statistical
Software 21. Ordinary least squares estimators were used to predict
delay-free cycle time based on explanatory variables (Table 2).
Standardized variable comparison was utilized for each machine to
reﬂect the differences in cost and productivity due to the treatment,
irrespective of variation in stand conditions and harvesting oper-
ations [24]. Dummy variables were used for representing unit and
species. Datasets were initially screened for outliers, after which
scatterplots were developed for each variable to check if the re-
lationships between transformed independent and dependent
variables were linear. Several transformation models were devel-
oped and compared; models which met the assumption of
normality were selected. Multi-collinearity was tested using a
tolerance value greater than 0.1 and variance inﬂation factor (VIF)
less than 10. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to
determine if there was any difference for species and dbh of trees
between sub-units within each unit.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Stand conditions
A total of 1113, 2052 and 1705 trees (both sawlogs and biomass)
were measured from the timber cruise plots for Units 1, 2 and 3,
respectively. Stand inventory estimated basal area (m2 ha1), and

fuel and labor cost was estimated at 1.01 $ liter1 and 47.20 $ h1, respectively. Machine rate per productive machine hours ($ PMH1) were calculated using the values of 2200
SMH (schedule machine hours)/year, 59% fringe beneﬁts, 10% interest, 80% utilization and 3% insurance (provided by the timberland company, which operated and owned the
machines).

species composition (Table 1). ANOVA results showed no signiﬁcant
difference in tree dbh among the three units (p-value ¼ 0.90, 0.21
and 0.83). However, Unit 1 had less than 8% of hardwood trees,
therefore this replicate unit was considered as conifer, while Units 2
and 3 were regarded as mixed stands.
3.2. Operational phase
Standardized comparison model was able to predict the delay-
free cycle time more effectively for sawlog component compared
to biomass (for all machines). Around 200 delay free cycle times
were collected from each equipment working in each sub-unit. The
various independent variables were selected based on how they
impacted productivity of the particular equipment. The harvesting
units and species were found to be signiﬁcant predictors for most of
the regression models. The R2 values for the models developed was
highest at 0.63 with a mean of 0.30 (Table 4). In some equations the
predictor variables could only explain 10% of the variability, sug-
gesting that there were other variables that could have potentially
inﬂuenced the productivity for these equipment.
3.2.1. Felling
A total of 2566 observations were taken from all three units.
Travel empty constituted the longest time component within the
feller-buncher’s delay-free cycle and ranged between 36 and 52%.
Average delay-free cycle time for all units were 42 and 31 s for
sawlogs and biomass trees, respectively, and there was no speciﬁc
operational trend observed among treatments. The cost of felling
was inﬂuenced by the average number of trees cut per turn, which
averaged 1.1 and 1.8 trees for sawlogs and biomass trees, respec-
tively. The average for distance between trees was 5.2, while
bunching distance was 7.8 m.
Bunching of biomass trees separately from the sawlogs started
right from felling, however, during shoveling both sawlog and
biomass were combined together as they were hauled to the
landing in order to maximize volume for each grapple. This sug-
gests that sorting of sawlog and biomass trees could have started at
the landing during shovel operation rather than felling, which
could have further lowered the cost of felling.
3.2.2. Shovel yarding
A total of 1009 delay-free cycle times were captured from all
three units, with an average of 31 s for each swing. Swing loaded
time had the largest share in the cycle (approximately 37%) and was
highly inﬂuenced by the orientation of trees within the bundle. On
average, 3.6 trees were moved in a single swing and the average
swing distance was approximately 18 m. External yarding distance
from the unit to roadside ranged from 16 to 137 m (Table 1). For
Unit 1, 51% of logs were downhill shoveled and the remaining up-
hill. Most of the sub-units in Unit 3 were downhill shoveled (68%),
and all but two decks in Unit 2 were yarded downhill.
Regression model showed that cost and productivity of the
shovel operation was highly inﬂuenced by distance loaded, and
swing distance (Table 4). Distance loaded and walking distance

being functions of average yarding distance (AYD); sensitivity an-
alyses were done to understand the inﬂuence of AYD and swing
distance (SD) on the cost. Results showed that a 15 m increase in
AYD corresponded to 9.81 $ m3 increase in the total shoveling cost
(SD ¼ 17 m) (Fig. 5). Shovel cost (AYD ¼ 30 m) decreased on an
average of 1.65 $ m3 for every 2 m increment of SD between 15 and
27 m (Fig. 6).
Shovel yarding was commonly planned to have trees reach the
landing within two or three swing turns. Sensitivity analyses
showed the importance of maximizing swing distance (SD) for
shovel logging, as increasing SD (on an operational level) could
counteract the increase in external yarding distance, which itself
was a function of the stand and road layout. The swing distance is
usually maximized by the shovel operator and is highly dependent
on presence of tree stumps, slope, terrain features, and size of logs
being shoveled [25].
The cost of shovel logging is higher than regular skidding
operation [26]; but is found to have lower impact on the forest ﬂoor
due to one time machine pass (Fig. 3). Therefore, using conven-
tional
ground-based
skidders
could
have
potentially further
reduced the total cost of operations.
3.2.3. Processing
The processor being the focus of the study, a total of 1583 valid
observations were taken from all three units. Delay-free cycle time
averaged 34, 38 and 43 s for no, moderate and intensive sorting
treatments, respectively (Fig. 7). Average number of sawlogs
generated per cycle was 1.63.
The high cost of processing for sorting treatments were pri-
marily due to the extra time required to process and sort biomass
materials into different piles. Tolan and Visser [27] showed the
number of sorts were inversely proportional to the productivity of
processor and attributed it partly to the increasing complexity of
such operation. In no sorting treatment, all forest residues gener-
ated during sawlog processing were stacked into a single pile.
However, hardwoods (biomass component) were stacked sepa-
rately and processed for delivering as round wood to power plants
in the no sorting treatment too. Furthermore, the sorting treat-
ments required extra space at landing for decking biomass mate-
rials in addition to the sawlogs sorts. As observed in other studies, it
generally took more time to process hardwoods (tanoak) compared
to conifers [28,29]. Between units, the cost difference was greater
for the mixed units (Units 2 and 3) compared to the conifer stand
(Unit 1) which might be potentially due to extra time and space
required to pile both conifer and hardwood tree tops separately
[30]. Additionally, processing cost differed between conifers and
mixed units for no sorting treatment averaging 4.09 and 4.75 $ m3,
respectively.
3.2.4. Loading and sorting of sawlogs
Delay-free cycle averaged 30 s for loading and 21 s for sorting.
On average, it took 14 min for the loader to load a sawlog truck.
Swinging loaded was the largest component in the delay-free cycle
and constituted between 35 and 53%. The time to load a sawlog
truck varied with the number of logs and orientation of logs in the
pile. For Units 2 and 3, which had two additional biomass piles from
hardwood, more time was spent on sorting.
3.3. Implication on management and the timber harvesting
operation
The study was designed to reﬂect a regular integrated harvest
operation in northern California by incorporating aspects of sorting
and processing forest residues. The differences in total cost of op-
erations
between
these
three
treatments
could
be
mainly
attributed to processing, as other phases including felling, shov-
eling, sorting and loading, did not show any such trend (Table 5).
Overall cost of the three forest residue treatments showed that
there was a gradual increase from the non-sorting (41 $ m3) to
intensive sorting (45 $ m3) for sawlogs (Table 5). Additional time
to process and sort tree tops increased cost by 1.25 $ m3
(approximately 30% increase in the processing cost) from non-to
intensive sorting treatments. For the same scenario, the cost

difference for the biomass component was around 3.50 $ ODMT1.
Although there was an increase in total cost attributed to pro-
cessing, results showed that 30e59% of the total cost for all sub-
units were actually from the shovel operation. This indicates that
primary transport was still the greatest inﬂuencing factor in total
harvesting cost, not processing. For biomass component, process-
ing constituted about 45e51% of total cost and was the most
expensive component of the operation. Additionally, stacking forest
residues have found to reduce foliage component up to 2e4%
compared to 20e30% in fresh-stacked logging residues, which
could enhance the quality of feedstock generated [3,31].
Cost of biomass operation was compared to other studies in US
Paciﬁc North which utilized similar harvesting systems. The cost
from the felling to piling ranged between 22.80 and 27.78 $ ton1,
suggesting that treating forest residues can be effectively incor-
porated to regular integrated harvesting operations within the re-
gion [10,32,33].
Forest residues are conventionally spread within the unit to be
used as “slash mats” for harvesting machines to minimize soil
compaction [34]. Even though these slash mats are recoverable, the
material can be contaminated, therefore not suitable as feedstocks
for value added products. However, as this operation utilized shovel
yarding (a single pass system) as its primary transportation mode,
the negative effects of soil compaction were minimal [35]. Addi-
tionally, Barrett et al. [36] showed the reduction of logging residue
from the forest ﬂoor due to biomass harvest did not inﬂuence the
best management practices. Even after a typical biomass recovery
operations in the region about 30e40% of forest residues are still
left on the ﬂoor [6].
Utilizing forest residues can potentially reduce the cost of site
preparation for replanting which are otherwise burned at a cost of
around 1000 $ ha1. This cost can be higher if a loader is required to
pile scattered residues within the unit (around 150e200 $ ha1).
Even at this price, the quality of treated stands are not usually
suitable for re-planting [25]. Therefore, the cost of biomass recov-
ery (including sorting and processing) can be substantiated as an
alternative to slash pile burning, and weed treatment [37]. Other
beneﬁts of forest residue utilization includes reducing negative
environmental impacts such as ﬁre hazard and pest outbreak [38].
Even if biomass removals may not generate instant ﬁnancial
returns, it is a competitive alternative to active ﬁre management at
the event of an outbreak [39,40].
When sorting and processing forest residue is incorporated to
regular timber harvesting, comminution via chipping can be facil-
itated [41]. The increase in cost due to treating forest residues was
estimated at around 1150 $ ha1. This value was calculated by
dividing the cost increase due to sorting and processing by the
combined area of sorting treatment (i.e., intensive and moderate
sorting units). As these products are of higher value, it is possible
that the extra cost incurred by treating forest residues could be
offset by the higher income generated. Additionally, these materials
could also be sold to the dowel and pulp wood markets. From an
operational point of view, forest residues are easier to handle when
sorted than when piled together.
The enhanced value for the high quality feedstock can also
substantiate increase in secondary transportation distance. There-
fore, advantage of treating forest residues also includes facilitating
biomass recovery operation in harvest units which were previously
inaccessible. Currently, the procurement area for traditional woody
biomass feedstock (power plants) are limited to less than 130 km
(one-way) due to the low price offered, making cost of secondary
transportation beyond that not feasible [7].
The small-end diameter and length of tree tops averaged 17 cm
and 7 m, respectively, ensuring these materials could be shipped
using short log trucks instead of the modiﬁed dump trucks
(commonly used to transport non-comminuted forest residues in
the region) [42,43]. In Humboldt County, CA, biomass recovery
operations are seasonal (roughly 100 days per year) because the
roads are closed during rainy seasons for the dump trucks. In
contrast, sawlog operations are year-round for cable logging and six
months for shovel logging. Therefore, using short log trucks could
extend the biomass recovery window for a much longer timeframe.
Further on, short log trucks are more productive than dump truck
[32].
4. Conclusions
It is very common to leave forest residues unutilized (on site) in
regions that does not have a strong woody biomass market. This
practice can lead to increased fuel load on the ﬂoor, consequently

increasing cost for replanting, risk of ﬁre, and spread of pest.
Sorting and processing forest residues was found to increase the
overall cost of the timber harvesting operation by 10%, compared to
the usual practice of piling all forest residues together. However,
this can facilitate the production of high quality feedstock, via
chipping, which can be utilized for generating value added prod-
ucts. The improved price will also make biomass recovery opera-
tions economically feasible in previously inaccessible regions.
