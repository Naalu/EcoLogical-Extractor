Abstract
What amount of extra energy can be generated after subtracting the total energy consumed to produce the biomass energy?
Knowing the ratio between energy output and input is a valid question when highly mechanized systems that consume fossil fuels
are used to harvest and transport forest biomass for energy. We estimated the net energy generated from mechanical fuel
reduction thinning treatments on pure ponderosa pine stands in Arizona. The mechanized system (felling, skidding, loading,
grinding, and hauling) was monitored for energy consumption. Potential energy output from harvested forest biomass was
calculated based on hog fuel moisture content and heating value. A 9-day study showed positive net energy output of
3,471,376,292 BTUs. The net energy ratio between energy output and input was 10.41, and the energy cost from stump to energy
plant was $4.65/million BTUs. Energy used for hauling hog fuel represented the largest part (36.27%) of the total energy input.
The net energy ratio decreased 0.11 with each additional transportation mile. Energy cost increased by $0.04/million BTUs,
$0.13/million BTUs, and $1.48/million BTUs for each additional mile of highway, unpaved road, and spur road, respectively. A
one dollar per gallon diesel price increase added $0.34/million BTUs to the energy cost. Forest biomass energy has an encour-
aging net energy ratio compared with other biomass sources, but the high production cost and energy cost can impede the use of
forest biomass for energy.
Rising fuel costs and the scarcity of fossil fuels have re-
newed interest in the use of wood fuel in the United States
(Arola and Miyata 1980). Traditional forest and mill residues
received considerable attention as supplements to conven-
tional fossil fuels during the energy crisis in the early 1970s
(Arola and Miyata 1980), and the use of forest and agricultural
residues in direct-combustion systems for power and heat
generation has been a well-established practice in the forest
products industry (Han et al. 2002). Today, biomass sources
provide 3 percent of all energy consumed in the United States,
while supplying about half of all renewable energy generated
in the country (Perlack et al. 2005).
In the past 50 years, successful fire suppression in the na-
tion’s forest resulted in a dense understory throughout the for-
ests (Han et al. 2002). These overstocked small-diameter
stands generally require thinning from below to improve fire-
tolerance and restore them to historical conditions (Graham et
al. 2002). To ensure that a thinning operation reduces fire risk
for the residual stand, the operation must either remove
submerchantable trees and logging slash completely through
biomass harvesting or carefully burn the fuels using a pre-
scribed fire (Han et al. 2002). Using these small-diameter
trees in addition to traditional logging residue for power

generation creates an additional op-
portunity for forest biomass energy
(Morris 1999, Bolding 2002).
Mechanical harvesting, process-
ing small-diameter trees, and trans-
porting hog fuel for energy are often
cost-prohibitive and associated with
questions about the net energy con-
tribution of the process. Adams
(1983) reported net energy ratios
from 18.2 to 25.0 for harvesting
(without transportation) stems 4 to 8
inches in diameter and 4 to 10 feet in
length (mixed species) using a cable system. However, the
literature lacks well-documented information on the net en-
ergy output when using ground-based systems to harvest
small-diameter ponderosa trees for energy.
A net energy analysis was performed to investigate the net
energy output of harvesting, processing, and transporting
small (diameter at breast height, DBH  5.0 inches) ponder-
osa pine trees for energy. The operations were directly asso-
ciated with a fuel reduction thinning treatment. Net energy
analysis is a technique that seeks to compare the amount of
energy delivered to society by a technology with the total en-
ergy required to find, extract, process, deliver, and otherwise
upgrade that energy to a socially useful form (Cleveland and
Costanza 2006).
The study objectives were: 1) to examine the total fossil
fuel consumption and biomass energy production, 2) to deter-
mine the net energy ratio between biomass energy output
and fossil energy input, and 3) to test the effects of different
variables on the net energy ratio and energy cost. These vari-
ables included hauling distance at various road standards and
diesel prices.
Methodology
Study sites and harvesting system
The two study sites were located in Springerville and Black
Mesa, Arizona, stocked with nearly 100 percent ponderosa
pine (Pinus ponderosa) trees. The silvicultural prescription
required all the trees less than or equal to 5.0 inches in DBH to
be removed and all the trees greater than 5.0 inches in DBH to
be reserved. A mechanized whole-tree system (Table 1) was
used to harvest the trees. A three-wheel hot-saw feller-
buncher (Valmet 603) felled and bunched trees prior to skid-
ding them to a landing using a rubber-tired grapple skidder
(CAT 525B). A stationary log loader (Prentice RT-100) at the
landing fed the whole trees into a remote-controlled horizon-
tal grinder (Bandit Beast 3680). The processed hog fuel
was loaded directly into a chip van through the grinder’s con-
veyor. Chip vans that could be hooked or disconnected from
the truck were used for landing-to-market hauling. The
hog fuel was sent to two local energy plants. The one-way
hauling distance to each plant ranged from 29.5 to 36 miles
(Table 2).
Energy input
In this study, direct energy consumption consisted of
fuel consumed for harvesting, processing small trees, and
transporting the hog fuel. The amounts of diesel used by the
feller-buncher, skidder, loader, and grinder were measured
by an electronic fuel meter installed on the fueling gun. Read-
ings on the electronic fuel meter were recorded each time ma-
chine fuel tanks were filled, with specific recordings before
operations started and after operations ended in each unit.
Truck diesel consumption was recorded by the driver for each
harvesting site. The reported average truck diesel consump-
tion rate of 0.4 gallon per mile was applied for the entire trans-
portation network, as it was impossible to segregate diesel
consumption rate for different road types.
This study did not directly measure the indirect energy in-
put that was required for moving equipment and for crew
transportation. Fuel consumption in moving equipment was
assumed to have the same diesel consumption rate as for hog
fuel hauling because they both used trucks for transportation.
Energy used for moving machines away from the site was not
considered for this study as this is typically assigned to the
following project. Fuel consumed by pickup trucks for crew
transportation was measured by the operator for each harvest-
ing site. Fuels spent for chain saw operation and administra-
tion were not included.
The summed direct and indirect diesel consumption
amounts were converted to an equivalent heating value (Brit-
ish thermal unit, BTU) as the total energy input. The energy
content was taken at 137,000 BTUs per gallon for diesel, and
125,000 BTUs per gallon for gasoline (Adams 1983). Other
energy inputs, such as energy consumed for active drying,
storage, and energy conversion, were not considered because
they appear in the hog fuel markets (energy plants) and are
outside the scale for this production study.

Energy output
Energy output was defined as the total recoverable heating
value from the produced hog fuel and was calculated using the
following formula (Ince 1979):
RHV = HHV  1 −MCwb −HL
[1]
where:
RHV = recoverable heating value, BTUspound
HHV = higher heating value, or the maximum potential
energy in dry hog fuel, BTUspound
MCwb = wet-based moisture content, percent
HL = heat loss, BTUspound
Two random hog fuel samples were collected from each
truckload to evaluate their higher heating value (HHV). All
the samples from the 32 truckloads were taken to the Univer-
sity of Idaho Forest Products Department lab to measure the
HHV using an oxygen bomb calorimeter following the stan-
dard described by the American Society for Testing and Ma-
terials E 711–87 (ASTM 2003a). In addition, one sample was
randomly selected for each cutting unit to determine the HHV
testing times. These four samples were each measured for the
HHV 12 times to provide a good sample size for the variance
detection. One-way ANOVA analysis was performed to de-
tect the variance between the samples and to compare the
mean HHV of each sample.
Heat loss was estimated under the following assumptions
(Ince 1979): the combustion heat recovery system was oper-
ated with 40 percent excess air and a stack gas temperature of
260 °C, which is typical for an industrial system; the ambient
temperature of hog fuel before combustion (room tempera-
ture) was 20 °C; the constant conventional heat loss factor
was 4 percent and the hog fuel had complete combustion.
The total hog fuel green weight was tracked from the scal-
ing ticket information of the energy plant tickets during the
operation. Hog fuel samples’ moisture contents (MC) were
measured at the Forest Energy Corp., Arizona, during the
study using an AND Infrared Moisture Determination Bal-
ance AD-4712. MC measurements following the American
Society of Testing and Materials E 871–82 guidelines (ASTM
2003b) were conducted in the University of Idaho lab after the
field study ended. Each sample was measured for the MC
three times, and the average value was applied in the calcula-
tion. A paired two-sample t-test was used to test the MC dif-
ference between Arizona and Idaho experiments.
Sensitivity analysis
After initial analysis on net energy ratio (energy output/
energy input) and energy cost ($/million BTUs), sensitivity
analyses were performed to test the effect of hauling distance
on net energy ratio and energy cost, and the effect of diesel
price on energy cost. To test the effect of hauling distance on
the net energy ratio, different one-way distances were simu-
lated to estimate the corresponding energy input. The net en-
ergy ratio change could be found given a constant energy out-
put. The impact of travel distance on energy cost was detected
by setting distinct highway, unpaved road, and spur road dis-
tances in a developed hauling cycle time regression model
while keeping all the other variables constant (Pan et al.
2007). The resulting value change in cycle time was then con-
verted to a production cost ($/bone dry ton, or $/BDT) change.
Combining the constant energy output with the production
cost change, the energy cost change could be calculated. The
diesel price influence on the energy cost was determined by
assuming different diesel prices. The resulting production
cost change was then transformed to the corresponding en-
ergy cost change. Scatter plots showed how the net energy
ratio and the energy cost changed with the corresponding
value change in the test variables.
Results
Energy input
The total direct diesel consumption was 2037.5 gallons for
the harvesting system, equivalent to 279,137,500 BTUs
(Table 3). Truck hauling was the largest direct energy input
component (47.95%) because it had the longest operation
time with a relatively high-horsepower engine. The skidder,
loader, and grinder worked as a “hot” system, meaning they
had similar production times. The grinder consumed 25.52
percent of the total direct input energy, reflecting the large
engine size (500 horsepower) of the machine and the highest
diesel consumption rate (gal/hr/hp, Table 1) in the hot system.
Although the loader had an engine similar in horsepower to
the skidder, it had a lower diesel consumption rate than the
skidder, resulting in less diesel use. The feller-buncher
worked independently and consumed 14.47 percent of the di-
rect input energy due to long working time and the highest
diesel consumption rate.
The total indirect energy input was 667.8 gallons of diesel
and gasoline, equal to 89,868,600 BTUs (Table 4). The diesel
used for moving machines accounted for 60.64 percent of the
total indirect energy input. The pickup trucks for crew trans-
portation expended 39.36 percent of the indirect energy input.

This percentage was high because the crew traveled about 100
miles (one-way) to site 2 each day.
The total energy input (Table 5) for the 9-day operation was
2705.3 gallons of fossil fuel. The total fuel input had an
equivalent heating value of 369,006,100 BTUs. The direct
and indirect energy consump-
tion represented 75.65 percent and
24.35 percent of the total energy
input, respectively, in terms of
equivalent heating value. Hog fuel
hauling represented the largest part
of direct energy input with 36.27
percent of the total energy input,
while machine transportation, the
largest part of indirect energy input,
consumed 14.77 percent of the total
input energy.
Energy output
The descriptive statistics for the
lab-derived hog fuel HHV (Table 6)
showed that the mean HHV ranged
from 8,946 to 9,105 BTUs/pound
and the SD varied from 27.1 to 43.2
within each hog fuel sample, which
was less than 1 percent of the mean
HHV. This indicated that one ex-
periment was sufficient for the rest of the samples instead of
multireplication. The one-way ANOVA analysis (Table 7)
provided an F-value of 56.51 with a p-value less than 0.00001
( = 0.05), indicating that the mean HHV of the four hog fuel
samples had a significant difference. The experiments showed
that hog fuel HHV ranged from 8,885 to 9,273 BTUs/pound
with an average value of 9,063 BTUs/pound. The hog fuel
from unit 3 had the lowest average HHV of 9,041 BTUs/
pound (Table 8). Ponderosa pine bark has higher HHV than
the wood on a weight basis (Ince 1979). The preharvest cruise
found the trees in unit 3 had the smallest DBH (Pan et al.
2007), indicating the lowest bark thickness and weight per-
centage (Johnson 1956).
The paired two-sample t-test found the moisture tests be-
tween Arizona and Idaho experiments had no significant dif-
ference (p = 0.068,  = 0.05). Idaho experiments showed that
the average hog fuel MC varied by cutting units from 50.02
percent to 55.66 percent, with an average value of 52.75 per-
cent (Table 8). The operation lasted from late July to early
August, when monsoon rains saturated the fuel. The operation
in unit 3 did not encounter rainfall and produced the driest hog
fuel of the four units.
The average heat losses due to MC, hydrogen, dry gas and
excess air, and conventional factor were 657.5, 318.0, 436.0,
and 171.3 BTUs/pound, respectively. The total average heat
loss was 1,582.8 BTUs/pound. By applying Equation [1], the
recoverable heating value of the hog fuel was determined to
be 2,699.4 BTUs/pound. Despite having the lowest HHV, the
hog fuel from unit 3 had the highest recoverable heating value
of 2,917 BTUs/pound because it had the lowest MC (Table
8). Keeping the rain from soaking the wood is critical to en-
sure a high recoverable heating value.
For this study, total hog fuel production was 711.34 green
tons at MC of 52.75 percent, or 336.11 bone dry tons. The
total recoverable energy output was 3,840,382,392 BTUs.
Subtracting the energy input, the net energy output was deter-
mined to be 3,471,376,292 BTUs. The net energy ratio be-
tween the recoverable energy output and the fossil energy in-
put was 10.41:1.

Sensitivity analysis
Based on the diesel consumption rate of 0.4 gallon per mile,
energy used for hauling was tested by setting the one-way
distance to 25, 30, 35, and 40 miles. Sensitivity analysis
showed a negative relationship between the hauling distance
and the net energy ratio (Fig. 1). For the distances from 25 to
40 miles, the net energy ratio varied from 11.90 to 10.23. Each
mile of hauling distance increase decreased the net energy ra-
tio by 0.11 on average.
A time study that accompanied this analysis (Pan et al.
2007) generated the following regression function for the
hauling cycle time (from loading hog fuel at the landing to
traveling empty back to the landing) with all the variables sig-
nificant:
Hauling cycle time min = 26.2300
+ 0.0014 Hog fuel green
weight, pound
+ 2.3158 one-way highway
distance in miles
+ 8.4910 one-way unpaved road
distance in miles
+ 107.1160 one-way spur road
distance in miles.
 = 0.05, p  0.00001, r2 = 0.98
The production cost study found an overall cost of $53.15/
BDT for harvesting, processing, and transporting the hog fuel
(Pan et al. 2007). Combining this with the recoverable heating
value of 3,840,382,392 BTUs for 336.11 BDTs of hog fuel, an
energy cost of $4.65/million BTUs resulted. Setting one-
way highway distance to 25, 30, 35, and 40 miles varied the
energy cost from $4.45/million BTUs to $5.04/ million BTUs
(Fig. 2). Each additional highway mile will increase the en-
ergy cost by $0.04/ million BTUs. Similar procedures showed
that each additional mile of unpaved road and spur road would
result in an increase in the energy cost by $0.13/million BTUs
and $1.48/million BTUs, respectively.
Diesel price directly affected system production cost and
energy cost. Market diesel prices in effect during the study
period were $2.90/gal for off-highway diesel and $3.20/gal
for on-highway diesel, resulting in the energy cost of $4.65/
million BTUs. Average diesel price was set at $1, $2, $3,
and $4 per gallon in the sensitivity analysis and the price
difference between on-highway and off-highway diesel was
omitted. With an increase of diesel price by one dollar per
gallon, the overall energy cost increased by $0.34/million
BTUs (Fig. 3).
Discussion
Higher energy costs resulted on unpaved roads and spur
roads compared to highways because the energy output did
not change and the regression coefficients reflected that un-
paved and spur roads distances had stronger effects on travel
time than highway mileage. Reducing off-highway hauling
should receive more attention than reduction in on-highway
mileage in harvest planning work. The hauling energy input
represented 36.27 percent of the total energy input, while the
percentage for transporting machines was 14.77 percent.
These high energy consumption percentages emphasize the
importance of operations close to markets and the value of
nearby available machines.
The net energy ratios from 18.2 to 25.0 were found by Ad-
ams (1983) for harvesting stems 4 to 8 inches in diameter and
4 to 10 feet in length using a cable system. Energy used for
hog fuel hauling was not included. In our study, the net energy
ratio would have been 16.33 if hauling energy input was
excluded. A lower production rate for harvesting smaller
trees was the major influence on the net energy ratio because
it required more time and energy to harvest the same weight
of biomass.
Use of forest biomass for energy compares well with other
biomass sources in net energy ratio. Our forest biomass

energy study found the net energy ratio to be 10.41 when uti-
lizing ponderosa pine biomass. Keoleian and Volk (2005) re-
ported the net energy ratio of 9.9 for willow biomass crops
that are direct-fired, while Shapouri et al. (1995) found a net
energy ratio of 1.24 when converting corn to ethanol. Other
studies reported −33,517 BTUs/gal and −8,431 BTUs/gal (en-
ergy loss) when producing corn-based ethanol (Pimentel
1991, Keeney and Deluca 1992). However, the net energy ra-
tios reported here were on the high end of this range as energy
input for possible active drying, storage, and final delivery
was not included. These energy inputs depend on the technol-
ogy used and are often difficult to estimate.
The major factor that can impede the use of forest biomass
for energy is the high production cost and energy cost associ-
ated with harvesting forest biomass for energy. The produc-
tion cost of $53.15/BDT found by an accompanying cost
study (Pan et al., 2007) illustrated that it was difficult to break
even given the current hog fuel price in the market. The en-
ergy cost of $4.65/million BTUs did not include the costs for
energy conversion and final delivery, which would lead to a
high energy cost in the end.
Conclusions
Energy input and output were monitored in a 9-day opera-
tion for harvesting and processing ponderosa pine trees less
than or equal to 5.0 inches in DBH and for transporting pro-
cessed hog fuel for energy. The total fossil fuel energy input
equaled 369,006,100 BTUs. Direct and indirect energy input
represented 75.65 percent and 24.35 percent of the total en-
ergy input, respectively. Lab experiments found the average
recoverable heating value of 2,699.4 BTUs/pound for the pro-
cessed hog fuel at the MC of 52.75 percent. The hog fuel from
unit 3 was the driest of the four units and had the highest re-
coverable heating value despite of the smallest size of the
trees. Biomass fuel that is directly fired can be significantly
affected by natural events such as rainfall. The total recover-
able energy output was 3,840,382,392 BTUs for 336.11 bone
dry tons (711.34 green tons, MC at 52.75%) of hog fuel. The
net energy output was 3,471,376,292 BTUs with a net energy
ratio of 10.41. The lower net energy ratio of this study com-
pared with findings from other forest biomass energy studies
was a function of harvesting and processing smaller trees.
This had the effect of lowering the production rate of the sys-
tem. Harvesting larger size material should improve the net
energy ratio.
Energy used for hauling hog fuel represented the largest
part (36.27%) of the total input energy. Each mile of hauling
distance increase would decrease the net energy ratio by 0.11.
Energy cost would increase $0.04/million BTUs, $0.13/
million BTUs, and $1.48/million BTUs for each additional
mile of highway, unpaved road, and spur road, respectively.
This indicates the importance of operations close to markets
and of planning that can reduce off-highway hauling. Energy
consumed for moving machines accounted for 14.77 percent
of the total energy input, emphasizing the value of nearby
available machines. A diesel price change of $1/gallon posi-
tively affected the energy cost by $0.34/million BTUs.
Using forest biomass for energy is encouraging compared
with using other biomass sources in terms of net energy ratio.
The high production cost and energy cost associated with me-
chanical harvesting of forest biomass, however, are the major
factors that can impede the use of forest biomass for energy.
Further research in lowering forest biomass production cost
and energy cost is needed.
