the Soil Water Content in a High-Elevation
Riparian Meadow, Arizona

Abstract
One of the largest and rarest Bebb willow (Salix bebbi-
ana) communities in the United States occurs at Hart
Prairie, Arizona. Low recruitment of the willow over the
past several decades has been linked to inadequate soil
water content for seed germination and seedling estab-
lishment. We tested a hypothesis that a prescribed burn
would reduce biomass of and evapotranspiration by her-
baceous plants, thereby increasing soil water content.
Three treatments (unburned control, early-growing season
burned, late-growing season burned) were applied in year
2001 to replicated plots in fern- and grass-dominated her-
baceous communities. Soil water content (0–30 cm) was
measured weekly in plots during the 2001, 2002, and 2003
growing seasons. Both early- and late-season burning
reduced herbaceous biomass in the fern-dominated com-
munity in 2002 and 2003 and reduced biomass in the
grass-dominated community in 2002 but not in 2003. Soil
water content increased for approximately four weeks in
2001 following the early-season burn, but the early-season
and late-season burns reduced soil water content in both
communities over much of the 2002 and 2003 growing sea-
sons. Thus, early-season burning may beneﬁt willow seed
germination by increasing soil water content immediately
following burning but be detrimental to germination in
the second and third growing seasons after burning
because of drier soil. Large temporal variation in the
effect of prescribed burning on soil water content will
complicate the use of ﬁre as a restoration tool to manage
soil water available for threatened plants such as Bebb
willow and for recharge of groundwater.

Introduction
In the Southwestern United States, riparian ecosystems
are rare and comprise only about 1% of total land area
(Briggs 1996), but they support a much larger portion of
the region’s biodiversity (Knopf et al. 1988; Naiman et al.
1993). Unfortunately, many of these riparian ecosystems
have degraded due to human alterations, including water
diversions and interruption of disturbance regimes (Busch
& Smith 1995; Stromberg et al. 1996). Hart Prairie, Ari-
zona, is one example of a degraded riparian ecosystem.
Over the past century, Hart Prairie has been subjected to
many of the stresses that are common in degraded riparian
ecosystems. Water has been diverted away from natural
drainages in the meadow by cattle/elk watering tanks and
a canal (DeWald & Springer 2001). Also, ﬁre has been
excluded from Hart Prairie since the initiation of the
national ﬁre suppression policy in 1905.
Hart Prairie provides habitat for one of the largest
Bebb willow (Salix bebbiana) populations in the South-
western United States and supports high species diversity.
Hart Prairie is one of the few locations where Bebb willow
is the dominant tree species (Goodrich 1991), and the
Bebb willow–mixed graminoid riparian woodland that
occurs at the Prairie is classiﬁed as globally rare by the
Nature Conservancy (Gori, unpublished data). Recruit-
ment of Bebb willow has been negligible for several deca-
des (Waring, unpublished data). Of the 1,332 Bebb
willows at Hart Prairie, 92% are mature or overmature,
and seedlings are rare. Seed viability is high at the time of
dispersal in mid- to late June, but seeds must contact
nearly saturated soil within one week of dispersal for ger-
mination (Maschinski, unpublished data; Church 2000).
Low soil water content at the time of seed dispersal
appears to be an important limitation to recruitment of
Bebb willow at Hart Prairie (Machinski, unpublished
data). Gavin (1998) predicted from a hydrologic model
that a 38% increase in annual precipitation above the
long-term average would provide adequate soil water con-
tent for Bebb willow seed germination at Hart Prairie.
Circumstantial and experimental evidence suggests that
current, dense herbaceous vegetation at Hart Prairie has
altered the site water balance to the detriment to Bebb
willow (Gavin 1998). Historic photos of Hart Prairie taken
before the onset of ﬁre suppression in 1905 suggest a her-
baceous understory that is less dense than present
(DeWald & Springer 2001). Amentt (2002) concluded that
current herbaceous vegetation upslope of the Bebb willow

community transpires most soil water during years with
below average precipitation.
The removal of herbaceous biomass with ﬁre could
reduce transpiration and increase soil water content. Her-
baceous biomass is immediately reduced by burning, and
regrowth biomass may be higher (Sharrow & Wright 1977;
Oswald & Covington 1984; White et al. 1991; Sakalauskas
et al. 2001) or lower (Anderson 1965; Sharrow & Wright
1977; Daowei & Ripley 1997) than before burning. In-
creases in herbaceous biomass after burning are promoted
by wet postﬁre weather, whereas decreases often occur
during dry postﬁre weather (Anderson 1965; Sharrow &
Wright 1977). Both increases (Haase 1986; McNabb et al.
1989) and decreases (Anderson 1965; Sharrow & Wright
1977; Bremer & Ham 1999; Snyman 2003) in soil water con-
tent have been reported after prescribed burning, but few
studies have addressed the impacts of a single ﬁre on soil
water content over several growing seasons (Snyman 2003).
The purpose of our study was to assess the effect of pre-
scribed burns on soil water content at Hart Prairie in the
year of burning and in the following 2 years. Season of
burning was included as a factor in our experiments
because prescribed burns often take place during the sum-
mer and fall months in northern Arizona. We conducted
burning experiments in the two major herbaceous commu-
nities that occur at Hart Prairie, fern dominated and grass
dominated. Our results are valuable for land managers
who are interested in restoring soil water content of high-
elevation grassland-riparian ecosystems by prescribed
burning, as well as managers who are interested in better
understanding of effects of prescribed burning on site
water balance.
Methods
Study Site
Hart Prairie is located 24 km northwest of Flagstaff, Ari-
zona, on the west slope of San Francisco Mountain (lat
35229 N, long 111459 W). Hart Prairie drains into Hart
Creek and then Volunteer Wash, a subwatershed of the
Verde River. The Hart Creek watershed has an area of 12
km2, with a maximum elevation of 3,850 m at Humphrey’s
Peak. Elevations in the study area at Hart Prairie range
from 2,560 to 2,680 m.
Hart Prairie is a high-elevation wet meadow sur-
rounded by a forest of aspen (Populus tremuloides),
bristlecone pine (Pinus aristata), corkbark ﬁr (Abies lasio-
carpa var. arizonica), Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii),
Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), Limber pine
(Pinus ﬂexilis), and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa).
The wettest portions of Hart Prairie, including stream
channels and springs, have an overstory of Bebb willow.
Herbaceous vegetation at Hart Prairie occurs in two dis-
tinct communities: fern dominated and grass dominated.
Fern-dominated communities include bracken fern (Pteri-
dium aquilinum) along with grasses and forbs. Grass-dom-
inated communities have no ferns and include forbs and
grasses such as Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica), moun-
tain muhly (Muhlenbergia montana), upland sedge (Carex
siccata), and squirreltail (Elymus elymoides).
Bebb willow populations are clustered around the
numerous springs in Hart Prairie. These springs result
from the intersection of shallow-perched aquifers with the
land surface (Gavin 1998). The shallow aquifers perch
within alluvial and colluvial deposits on top of clay lenses
(DeWitt 1980) and are often less than 5 m below the
ground surface. Spring ﬂow is highly dependent on precip-
itation in the preceding and current years (Martin 1969;
Gavin 1998). Recharge primarily occurs as a result of win-
ter precipitation but can also occur during heavy monsoon
precipitation. The moisture provided by these springs is
critical to the germination of Bebb willow seed due to the
lack of precipitation in the months preceding seed dis-
persal which occurs in late June.
Two types of mollisol soils occur at Hart Prairie (DeWall
1973). Fine-loamy, mixed, aquic Argiboralls are found
throughout Hart Prairie and loamy-skeletal, mixed, frigid
Argiaquolls occur in spring areas and limited portions of
stream channels. Soils at higher elevations in Hart Prairie
have higher sand content and lower clay content than soils
at lower elevations (Lee, unpublished data). The plots used
in our study were located in Argiborall soils.
Climatic Data
The frost-free season in 2001, 2002, and 2003 at Hart Prairie
was approximately 150 days. Mean daily temperatures
varied between 214 and 30C during the study. The
long-term (93 year) mean daily temperature was 6C and
average yearly precipitation was 564 mm at nearby Fort
Valley, Arizona (http://www.wrcc.dri.edu). Highest pre-
cipitation occurs in winter as snowfall and during the sum-
mer monsoon season, which typically begins in July and
ends in early- to mid-September. The driest time of year
occurs in May and June. Precipitation was below the long-
term average in northern Arizona in the 2001 (210%),
2002 (248%), and 2003 (217%) water years (October
through September).
Precipitation data were collected from several sources.

Hart Prairie. Daily precipitation data during the study
were obtained from two sources. The primary source was
a RainWise RGEL tipping bucket rain gauge (RainWise,
Bar Harbor, ME, U.S.A.) with an accuracy of ±0.13 mm
located at the Arizona Snowbowl, approximately 250 m
higher in elevation than the study site. The secondary
source was a Campbell Scientiﬁc TE525 tipping bucket
rain gauge (Campbell Scientiﬁc, Logan, UT, U.S.A.),
located approximately 50 m lower in elevation than the
study sites (Helu-Montes, unpublished data).

Experimental Design
A total of 30 plots was used in the experiment. Five
blocks, each containing three circular plots (2 m radius),
were established in each of the fern-dominated and grass-
dominated communities in the spring of 2001. The three
circular plots in each block were randomly assigned to one
of the following three treatments: unburned (control),
early-season burned, and late-season burned. None of the
plots had been burned in many decades. Fire lines 25 cm
in width were dug by hand to the mineral soil around all
plots before burning.
Both burns primarily consumed ﬁne fuels that consisted
of dead or dry herbaceous vegetation. The early-season
burn was applied to one-third of the plots on 5 July 2001.
The air temperature during burning was 19C with 55%
relative humidity and light winds. Drip torches were used
on all plots to dry and ignite vegetation because of damp
conditions. Fuel consumption averaged 44% (1 SE ¼
15.5) in the fern-dominated plots and 42% (1 SE ¼ 25.3)
in grass-dominated plots based on comparisons of oven-
dry biomass between representative portions of burned
plots and adjacent unburned areas (n ¼ 5). The late-
season burn was applied to one-third of the plots on 22
September 2001. The air temperature during burning was
24C with 13% relative humidity and light to moderate
winds. Flame was directly applied to dry and ignite vegeta-
tion. Most grass vegetation in the plots burned with a sin-
gle backing ﬁre. Fuel consumption averaged 68% in both
the fern-dominated (1 SE ¼ 15.6) and grass-dominated
(1 SE ¼ 10.9) plots. Both burns were conducted by the
same ﬁre crew from the Coconino National Forest.
Soil water Content
Volumetric soil water content (h) was measured weekly at
two locations near the center of each plot in the 2001,
2002, and 2003 growing seasons. A Moisture Point
MP-917 (Environmental Sensors, Inc., Victoria, British
Columbia, Canada) time-domain reﬂectometer with an
accuracy of ±3% was used to measure h over a depth of
0–30 cm. Most roots of herbaceous vegetation occur within
this soil depth at the study site (Amentt 2002) based on
observations from several soil pits.
Biomass
Aboveground vegetation biomass was sampled on 21
September 2002 and 22 September 2003. A 0.30-m2 sam-
ple was collected from each plot by clipping all vegeta-
tion to the soil surface. In early- and late-season burned
plots, the sample was collected along the inside edge of
each plot. Samples for unburned plots were collected
directly outside the plot in an area with similar vegeta-
tion. Samples were dried at 70C for at least 24 hours and
weighed.
Percent Cover
Cover of living vegetation, bare ground (non-vegetated
soil and rock), and litter was estimated in each plot on 26
September 2003 in the grass-dominated community and
on 2 October 2003 in the fern-dominated community.
Percent areal cover was estimated for each component
ocularly by two observers within the area bounded by a
1.0 3 0.5–m frame at two non-overlapping locations on
the west side of each plot. For vegetation, areal cover
included ground covered by the bases and leaves of plants.
Groundwater Levels
Groundwater levels were measured in a shallow, 1.5-m-
deep well at the weather station beside the fern-domi-
nated community to determine the depth of the water
table relative to the depth of h measurements. Water
levels in the well were measured with a chalked, etched
steel tape with an accuracy of ±0.15 cm about every two
weeks during the growing season and monthly during the
winter.
Statistical Analyses
Effects of burning treatments on average h for each year
and community type were compared using repeated meas-
ures of analysis of variance (ANOVA). Block was not
used as a source of variation in the ANOVA because it
was not a signiﬁcant factor in preliminary analyses. In
2001, percent differences in h between the unburned and
early-season burned plots were compared using ANOVA
in three time periods: pretreatment (31 May 2001 to 3 July
2001), four weeks after burn (17 July 2001 to 9 August
2001), and the remainder of the growing season (10
August 2001 to 18 September 2001). Pretreatment data
were compared to assess differences in h among plots
prior to treatment. Data collected in the four weeks fol-
lowing the early-season burn were analyzed separately
from the remaining weeks in the growing season because
the early portion of the growing season coincides with the
time of seed dispersal and germination by Bebb willow at
the study site and because differences were greatest dur-
ing this period. In the years following burning (2002 and
2003), comparisons of percent differences in h among
treatments again focused on the premonsoon season
(26 May 2002 to 18 June 2002 and 29 May 2003 to 17 June
2003), which coincided with Bebb willow seed dispersal
and germination. These periods were delineated based on
their equal length and similar calendar dates within the
premonsoon period and by the period between the latest
occurrence of spring precipitation (19 May 2001) and the
earliest occurrence of monsoon precipitation (22 June
2001) over all years of the study.
Vegetation biomass and cover data from each year
were analyzed with one-way ANOVA. All statistics were
calculated with SAS JMP software (SAS Institute, Inc.,
Cary, NC).

Results
Climatic conditions varied among years. All three years of
the study were drier than the long-term average hydro-
logic year precipitation (564 mm), and 2002 was one of the
driest years on record (Table 1). In addition, the growing
season and the period of data collection for h started at
least a full month earlier in 2002 than in either 2001 or
2003 due to warmer temperatures in 2002 (Table 1).
Groundwater Levels
In 2001, water levels in the shallow well were at or near
land surface after snow melted in early spring (Fig.1).
Water levels declined until the well went dry (>1.4 m depth
to water) in June. In 2002, the well was dry for the entire
growing season, and in 2003 it was dry for most of the grow-
ing season. In all years, water levels in the well were below
the depth of h measurements (30 cm) when h measure-
ments started in April or May (Fig. 1). Thus, groundwater
had little inﬂuence on our measurements of soil h.
u: Early-Season Burn/Fern-Dominated Community
Prior to the early-season burn in 2001, h of fern-domi-
nated plots assigned to the early-season burn treatment
was similar (difference of 6.3% or 11.5 mm; p ¼ 0.660) to
h in plots assigned to the unburned treatment (Figs. 2a &
3a). In the ﬁve weeks following the prescribed burn (9 July
to 9 August), the difference in h between early-season
burned and unburned plots increased to an average of
9.0% or 25.1 mm (Figs. 2a & 3a). This postburning differ-
ence in h was not statistically signiﬁcant ( p ¼ 0.279) for
data from the fern-dominated community but it was signif-
icant ( p ¼ 0.047) for data pooled over the fern-dominated
and grass-dominated communities. After early August,
h was similar for early-season burned and unburned plots
in 2001 (p ¼ 0.575) (Fig. 2a).
Early-season burned plots were an average of 9.6% (15
mm) drier than unburned plots throughout the 2002 grow-
ing season (Figs. 2b & 3c; p ¼ 0.081). The largest differ-
ence in h occurred in the premonsoon season (26 May to
18 June), when h was 14% lower in the early-season
burned plots than in unburned plots (Fig. 2b, Table 2).
This difference in h between early-season burned and
unburned plots in the premonsoon season in 2002 is signif-
icantly greater than the difference during the premonsoon
season in 2001, prior to the prescribed burn (Table 2).
In the premonsoon season of 2003 (29 May to 17 June),
early-season burned plots were an average of 17.4%
(31.3 mm) drier than unburned plots (Figs. 2c & 3e).
This difference is similar to the difference between
early-season burned and unburned plots in the premon-
soon season of 2002 (Table 2). The h was similar for the
early-season burned and unburned plots (p ¼ 0.814)
after the start of the monsoon rains in August 2003
(Figs. 2c & 3e).
u: Early-Season Burn/Grass-Dominated Community
Prior to the early-season burn in 2001, h of grass-domi-
nated plots assigned to the early-season burn treatment
was similar (difference of 7.0% or 4.1 mm; p ¼ 0.633) to h
in plots assigned to the unburned treatment (Figs.4a & 5a).
During the 4 weeks immediately following the burn, early-
season burned plots had an average of 12.0% (22.9 mm)
greater h than unburned plots (Figs. 4a & 5a) and an
increase of 8% over preburn differences. This postburning
difference was not statistically signiﬁcant (p ¼ 0.112) for
data from the grass-dominated community alone, but the
difference was signiﬁcant (p ¼ 0.047) when h data were
pooled over the grass-dominated and fern-dominated
communities. Differences in h between early-season burned
and unburned plots diminished by the end of the 2001
growing season (Figs. 4a & 5a).
Early-season burned plots were drier than unburned
plots between May and early August in 2002 (Figs. 4b &
5c). Differences in h were largest in the premonsoon sea-
son (26 May to 18 June) when early-season burned plots
were an average of 10.4% (7.0 mm) drier than unburned
plots (Table 2). It is important to note that unburned plots
were 7.0% wetter than early-season burned plots during
a similar period before burning in 2001. The magnitude of
the difference between early-season burned and unburned
plots in the premonsoon season varied signiﬁcantly
between 2001 (burned wetter) and 2002 (burned drier)
(Table 2). The h was similar between early-season burned
and unburned plots between the middle of August and
late September (Figs. 4b & 5c).
In the premonsoon season of 2003 (29 May to 17 June),
early-season burned plots were an average of 7.1 mm
(4.6%) drier than unburned plots (Fig. 5e, Table 2). This
difference is similar to the difference in h between early-
season burned and unburned plots during the premonsoon
period in 2002 (Table 2). Differences in h between early-
season burned and unburned plots were smaller after
early August than during the premonsoon season of 2003
(Figs. 4c & 5e).

u: Late-Season Burn in the Fern-Dominated Community
All of the 2001 data for the late-season burn were
collected before burning that occurred on 22 September. h
was similar (p ¼ 0.245) for late-season burned plots and
unburned plots in the 2001 growing season (Figs. 2a & 3b).
Late-season burned plots were consistently drier than
unburned plots throughout the 2002 growing season (p ¼
0.059), with the largest differences in the premonsoon sea-
son (Figs. 2b & 3d). Late-season burned plots were an
average of 8.4% drier than unburned plots in the premon-
soon season of 2002 (26 May to 18 June), whereas late-
season burned plots were 2.6% wetter during the same
period in 2001 before burning (Table 2). Differences in h
between late-season burned and unburned plots dimin-
ished after the onset of monsoon rains in early July in
2002 and were less than differences in 2001 during similar
dates (Figs. 2b, 3b, & 3d).
The late-season burned plots were slightly drier than
unburned plots for much of 2003 (Figs. 2c & 3f; p ¼ 0.194).
Differences in h were largest in the premonsoon season
(29 May to 17 June) when late-season burned plots were
an average of 26% (46.8 mm) drier than unburned plots
(Table 2). This difference is more pronounced than the
differences for the same period in 2001 and 2002 (Table 2,
Fig. 3b, 3d, & 3f).
u: Late-Season Burn/Grass-Dominated Community
In 2001 prior to burning, average h was similar (p ¼ 0.892)
for the late-season burned and unburned plots (Figs. 4a &
5b). Similarly, average h in 2002 was similar for the late-sea-
son burned and unburned plots (Figs.4b & 5d, p ¼ 0.773).
However, in the premonsoon season of 2002 (26 May to 18
June), late-season burned plots were an average of 7.4%
(4.9 mm) wetter than unburned plots, which is a larger dif-
ference than occurred in 2001 prior to burning (Table2).
Late-season burned plots were consistently and slightly
drier than unburned plots throughout the 2003 growing
season (Figs. 4c & 5f, p ¼ 0.219). In the premonsoon sea-
son (29 May to 17 June), late-season burned plots aver-
aged 10.2% (15.5 mm) drier than unburned plots (Table2).
The difference in h between late-season burned and un-
burned plots in the premonsoon season was larger in 2003
(burned drier) than in 2002 (burned wetter) or 2001 (no
difference) (Table 2, Fig. 5b, 5d, & 5f).

Aboveground Vegetation Biomass and Cover
In 2002 at the end of the ﬁrst full growing season after
burning, both early- and late-season burning reduced
aboveground vegetation biomass compared with unburned
plots in both the fern- and grass-dominated communities
(Fig. 6). In the fern-dominated community, biomass of
early-season burned plots was 32.6% lower than in the
unburned plots (p ¼ 0.003), and biomass of late-season
burned plots was 21.6% lower than unburned plots (p ¼
0.043). In the grass-dominated community, biomass of
early-season burned plots was 29.6% lower than unburned
plots (p ¼ 0.004), and biomass of late-season burned plots
was 33.0% lower than unburned plots (p ¼ 0.006).
Effects of burning on aboveground vegetation biomass
were variable at the end of the second full growing season
after burning in 2003. In the fern-dominated community,
average biomass in both burned plots was less than in the
unburned plots (Fig. 6), but these differences were not sig-
niﬁcant (p ¼ 0.112 and p ¼ 0.173, respectively) because
of high variability among replicate plots. Vegetation bio-
mass was almost identical among treatments in the grass-
dominated community in 2003 (Fig. 6, p > 0.690).
Percent areal cover was measured in all plots at the end
of the 2003 growing season (Fig. 7). In both communities,
the smallest amount of bare ground occurred in unburned
plots and the greatest occurred in the late-season burned

among treatments, except for the late-season burned plots
in the grass-dominated community, which had lower cover
than in unburned and early-season burned plots. Litter
cover was generally higher in unburned plots than burned
plots, although the difference was only signiﬁcant (p 
0.05) between the unburned and early-season burned plots
in the grass-dominated community (Fig. 7).

(2003) full growing seasons after burning. The early-
season burn removed leaf area of herbaceous plants and
reduced plant transpiration, thereby increasing h in both
the fern- and grass-dominated communities but only for
about four weeks after the burn. These results for Hart
Prairie are consistent with previous studies conducted in
semiarid regions showing that burning can increase h in
environments where quick recovery of vegetation after
burning is constrained by water stress (Sharrow & Wright
1977; McNabb et al. 1989). In contrast to the results for
2001, the early-season burn reduced h during portions of
the ﬁrst (2002) and second (2003) full growing seasons
after burning. Drier soil in early-season burned plots dur-
ing the ﬁrst and second growing seasons after burning can
be explained partly by higher transpiration associated with
vigorous regrowth of leaves by herbaceous perennial
plants in an environment with increased availability of
water and mineral nutrients (Sharrow & Wright 1977).
Herbaceous biomass in burned plots had recovered to
about 75% of the biomass of unburned plots at the end of
the ﬁrst full growing season after burning (2002). Higher
soil evaporation also may have contributed to drier soil in
early-season burned plots during the ﬁrst and second
growing seasons after burning as reduced plant biomass
can lower the albedo thereby increasing heat absorption
and soil temperature (Bremer & Ham 1999).
Effects of the late-season burn (mid-September) on soil
h differed from the early-season burn in the occurrence
and timing of positive and negative changes in h compared
with the unburned plots. The timing of the late-season
burn in late September precluded stimulation of h during
the 2001 growing season given the short growing season at

the high elevation of our study site. The late-season burn
reduced soil h during much of the ﬁrst growing season
(2002) after burning in the fern-dominated community but
had a small positive effect on h in the grass-dominated
community during the premonsoon season. However, by
July and August of 2002, regrowth of vegetation in the
late-season burned plots in the grass-dominated commu-
nity reduced h below that in the unburned plots. Negative
effects of late-season burning on h persisted into the sec-
ond growing season after burning (2003) for both fern-
and grass-dominated communities.
Other explanations for changes in soil h after burning,
such as altered winter recharge (deJong 1973) and inﬁltra-
tion (Anderson 1965; Robichaud 2000), are unlikely in
our study. For example, we observed no evidence of
decreased inﬁltration into burned soils before or during
periods when h was lower in burned plots, such as sheet or
gulley erosion. Moreover, soil h in all treatments increased
at about the same rate during summer precipitation
events. Thus, it is unlikely that burned plots were drier
than unburned plots due to changes in recharge.
Restoration Implications
Land managers of Hart Prairie (The Nature Conservancy,
Coconino National Forest) want to increase recruitment
of Bebb willow seedlings, and prescribed burning of prai-
rie vegetation has been suggested as an approach to
increase soil h and promote willow seed germination
(DeWald & Springer 2001). In Hart Prairie, h is typically
the highest in early spring due to soil water recharge from
snowmelt. Soil water storage decreases from early spring
to early summer because of low precipitation combined
with evaporation and transpiration and increases in the
late summer during monsoon rains. Bebb willow seed dis-
persal occurs during the premonsoon season (June) when
soil h is lowest. A hydrologic model developed for one
spring at Hart Prairie estimated that 820–870 mm of pre-
cipitation in a hydrologic year would provide optimal soil
h conditions for Bebb willow seed germination (Gavin
1998). This estimate is well above the 93-year average pre-
cipitation of 564 mm. Our results and the estimates of the
model suggest that the brief increase in soil h during the
premonsoon season caused by early-season burning might
provide adequate soil h for Bebb willow seed germination
in years with exceptionally high precipitation but not in
years with average or below-average precipitation. Fol-
lowing this short-term increase in soil h, which occurred
for about four weeks in our study, early-season burning of
prairie vegetation upslope of Bebb willow stands would
likely be detrimental to Bebb willow germination because
high evapotranspiration from burned areas reduced soil h
for at least two full growing seasons after burning. Late-
season burning offered less opportunity for increasing soil
h than did early-season burning.
We conclude that effects of prescribed burning of high-
elevation meadow vegetation on soil h shift from positive
to negative as vegetation recovers after ﬁre, and the nega-
tive effects are persistent over at least two growing sea-
sons in below-average precipitation years. This temporal
variation and the persistent negative effects of burning on
soil h will make restoration of hydrologic processes at Hart
Prairie with ﬁre a challenge. An important caveat to our
study is that all three years of our study had below-average

Clearly, additional research is needed on effects of pre-
scribed burning on soil h and site water balance in wetter
