1. Introduction
Mixed conifer forests of the Southwest, characterized by diverse
stands ofponderosapine (Pinus ponderosa),whiteﬁr(Abies concolor),
Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii), quaking aspen (Populus tremu-
loides), and sometimes other species such as limber pine (Pinus
ﬂexilis), are of great ecological and management interest. These
forests occupy intermediate elevations between the lower pine
forests and the higher stands of spruce (Picea) and ﬁr. Relatively
warm, dry mixed conifer at lower elevations or on southerly aspects
were characterized by frequent surface ﬁres synchronized by
climate, although mean ﬁre intervals of approximately 9–30 years
were longer than those observed in ponderosa pine forests (3–14
years) (Brown et al., 2001; Fule´ et al., 2003a; Grissino-Mayer et al.,
2004; Heinlein et al., 2005; Brown and Wu, 2005). Although warm/
dry mixed coniferforests occurin environments thatarewet enough
to support mesic trees such as Abies and Populus, these taxa are also
relatively susceptible to ﬁre-caused mortality, as compared to the
relatively ﬁre-resistant Pinus and Pseudotsuga, so species composi-
tion was historically regulated by the balance between climate and
ﬁre. Relatively cool, moist mixed conifer forests at higher elevations
ornortherlyaspectsare distinguishedbygreaterdominancebyAbies
and Picea, with limited or no ponderosa pine; cool/moist mixed
conifer forests are believed to have burned less frequently and with
greater severity than warm/dry forests (Fule´ et al., 2003b; Romme
et al., 2006) (Table 1).
Both warm/dry and cool/moist mixed conifer forest types
(following the terminology of Romme et al., 2006) have been
affected by recent human-caused factors. Fire regimes were
interrupted in the San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado
circa 1870, when settlers of European origin introduced livestock
grazing that broke the contiguity of surface fuels (Grissino-Mayer
et al., 2004; Brown and Wu, 2005). Similar disruptions were
observed across the Southwest (Swetnam and Baisan, 1996). On

We selected a warm/dry mixed conifer forest (ponderosa pine, white ﬁr, Douglas-ﬁr, and aspen) in
southwestern Colorado to reconstruct historical conditions of ﬁre regime and forest structure in
preparation for an experiment in ecological restoration. Although mixed conifer forests are of high
ecological and social value in the Southwest, they have been less studied than ponderosa pine forests.
Fire-scar analysis on a 150-ha area showed recurring ﬁres at mean intervals of 24 years (all ﬁres with
minimum of 2 sample trees scarred) to 32 years (ﬁre scarring 25% or more of sample trees) from the 16th
century until the abrupt cessation of ﬁre after 1868, concurrent with European settlement. There was no
evidence in age or species-speciﬁc data of severe burning at the scale of the study blocks (approximately
200 ha). The forest remained unharvested throughout most of the 20th century, until a cut in the early
1990s removed approximately equal basal areas of ponderosa pine and white ﬁr. Forest structure had
already changed substantially, however. Total basal area increased from an average of 11 m2 ha1 in
1870 to 27 m2 ha1 in 2003, despite harvesting of at least 8.4 m2 ha1. Ponderosa pine declined from
representing nearly two-thirds of basal area in 1870 to one-third in 2003. The other species increased
dramatically, especially white ﬁr, which went from 12% to 35% of basal area and dominated stand density
with an average of 392 trees ha1. Total tree density increased from 142 trees ha1 in 1870 to
677 trees ha1 in 2003. The ecological changes that occurred here since the 19th century have been in
exactly the opposite direction considering the warm, ﬁre-favoring climate expected in the 21st century.
If warm/dry mixed conifer forests of southern Colorado are to have a reasonable chance for persistence
under the future climate regime, restoring conditions more similar to the frequently burned, open forests
of the past is likely to be a useful starting point.

higher forests stopped after 1879 (Fule´ et al., 2003b). Under
extended ﬁre exclusion, mixed conifer forests have undergone
substantial increases in tree density within stands, especially by
shade-tolerant white ﬁr and Douglas-ﬁr (Fule´
et al., 2004a;
Heinlein et al., 2005). Mesic species have become established at
lower elevations, and stands have become more homogeneous
across landscapes (White and Vankat, 1993; Cocke et al., 2005). In
many cases, selective logging of ponderosa pine exacerbated the
compositional shift toward mesic species (Cocke et al., 2005).
Interruption of a frequent disturbance regime, such as the
frequent surface ﬁre regime of ponderosa pine or warm/dry mixed
conifer, will lead to noticeable ecological effects more rapidly than
cessation
of
infrequent
ﬁres,
because
a
larger
number
of
disturbance events are skipped in a given period of ﬁre exclusion.
Both
ponderosa
and
warm/dry
mixed
conifer
forests
have
experienced large pulses of tree regeneration following ﬁre
cessation in the Southwest, but ponderosa forests have received
substantially more attention from researchers and managers
(Covington and Moore, 1994). Studies of ponderosa ecology and
forest change (White, 1985; Sa´nchez Meador et al., 2009) have
supported the development and testing of ecological restoration
treatments (Covington et al., 1997; Roccaforte et al., 2008).
Changes in warm/dry mixed conifer forests are also of concern,
however. The dense, low-sweeping canopies of mesic species that
have increased following ﬁre exclusion form horizontal and vertical
fuel complexes that facilitate the spread of severe wildﬁres (Fule´
et al., 2004a). Meanwhile, climate change in the Southwest is
projected to support increasingly common droughts (Seager et al.,
2007)andﬁres(McKenzieetal.,2004).Followingtheponderosapine
example, it is logical to suggest that effects of ﬁre exclusion can be
reversedbyrestorationtreatmentssuchasre-introductionofsurface
ﬁre or thinning + burning, as demonstrated in the Sierra Nevada by
Stephensand Moghaddas (2005), but the few documentedexamples
in the Southwest show inconsistent results. At Grand Canyon, one
example of ﬁre use in mixed conifer led to an escaped wildﬁre even
on gentle slopes (Fule´ et al., 2004b) but a second example resulted in
landscape-scale burning that generally emulated the effects of
historical ﬁres (Fule´ and Laughlin, 2007). Forest structure following
thinning + burning in a Grand Canyon mixed conifer forest was
statistically indistinguishable from burning alone, but the thinning
was conﬁned to very small trees (Fule´ et al., 2006).
Beginning in 2002, we initiated a study in warm/dry mixed
conifer forest of the San Juan Mountains, Colorado, to assess forest
change and test restoration alternatives on the overstory and
understory (Korb et al., 2007). Here we report on forest measure-
ments and dendroecological reconstructions to address the follow-
ing questions: (1) what were the reference conditions of historical
ﬁre regime and ﬁre–climate relationships, forest composition, and
structure? and (2) how have conditions changed to the present?
2. Methods
2.1. Study area
The study area is located in the San Juan Mountains on Lower
Middle Mountain, approximately 18 km northwest of Pagosa
Springs, in southwest Colorado (N 37.296, W 107.228) on the San
Juan National Forest. The site consists of 15–30% slopes on
generally south-facing aspects. Elevations range from 2438 to
2743 m. The dominant soil type is Dutton loam, a silty clay loam
(USDA Forest Service, 2004). Average daily temperatures range
from a maximum of 25.7 8C in July to a minimum of 17 8C in
January. Average annual precipitation is 55.4 cm, with the greatest
amounts occurring in July and August due to summer thunder-
storm activity. Precipitation from November to March is domi-
nated by snowfall, with an average annual snowfall of 326 cm
(Western Regional Climate Center, Pagosa Springs, 1906–1998,
www.wrcc.dri.edu).
Forest vegetation includes ponderosa pine, Douglas-ﬁr, white
ﬁr, and aspen (P. tremuloides). The midstory and understory are
dominated primarily by white ﬁr and Douglas-ﬁr, with a variety of
shrubs including Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii), snowberry
(Symphoricarpus
rotundifolius),
and
serviceberry
(Amelanchier
alnifolia).
Past disturbance history includes sheep grazing beginning in
the late 1800s and cattle grazing since the early 1900s on a rest-
rotation system annually from June to October with dates varying
due to the presence of snow. There are no large meadows, water
holes, or tanks in the analysis area so grazing impacts may have
been light. Fire suppression has been management policy since the
early 20th century. A single timber harvest occurred between 1990
and 1993, using an intermediate harvest system intended to
enhance residual tree growth and quality. Approximately 3830
million board feet were harvested in the area, consisting of 51%
ponderosa pine, 33% white ﬁr, and 16% Douglas-ﬁr (USDA Forest
Service, 2004; S. Hartvigsen, San Juan National Forest, personal
communication, 2008).
2.2. Field methods
We collected data in the pre-treatment phase of an experiment
in forest ecological restoration. Partial cross-sections were cut
from ﬁre-scarred ponderosa pine logs, stumps, and snags and each
sample
was
mapped
in
an
area
of
approximately
150 ha
(1 km  1.5 km) in the center of the study area (Fig. 1). Because
ﬁre scars were not abundant, all ﬁre scars with sound wood were
taken. The ﬁre history collection was done before the forest
structure units were laid out, so the ﬁre scar sampling area did not
completely overlap with the experimental units. However, the
study area is continuous forest with no physical barriers to ﬁre
spread so the ﬁre history collection is still relevant to the
experimental units.
Forest structure was measured in each of twelve, 16-ha
experimental units. We established 20 study plots on a 60-m grid
per
unit
to
characterize
vegetation
(total
N = 12 uni-
ts  20 plots = 240 plots). Plot centers were permanently marked
with iron stakes and were geo-referenced. Overstory trees and
saplings taller than breast height (137 cm) were measured in a
400 m2 (11.28 m radius) circular plot. Species, condition (living or
snag/log classes, Thomas et al., 1979), diameter at breast height
(dbh), height, and a preliminary ﬁeld classiﬁcation of presettle-
ment or postsettlement origin were recorded for each tree
encountered in the plot. Potentially presettlement ponderosa pine
trees were identiﬁed based on size (>40 cm diameter at ‘‘stump
height’’ [dsh], 40 cm above ground level) or yellow bark (White,
1985). Other conifers were also considered as potentially preset-
tlement if dsh > 40 cm; aspen were noted as potentially preset-
tlement if dsh > 20 cm. All potentially presettlement trees, as well
as a random 10% subsample of other trees, were cored with an
increment borer at 40 cm above ground level. Diameter at stump
height was recorded for all cored trees. Tree regeneration (trees
below breast height) was measured on a nested 100 m2 circular

plot (5.64 m radius); species, condition, and height class (<40 cm;
40.1–80 cm; 80.1–137 cm) were recorded for each seedling or
sprout. Understory vegetation was also measured and has been
described elsewhere (Korb et al., 2007).
2.3. Laboratory, statistical, and modeling analysis
Fire-scarred samples were surfaced with increasingly ﬁner grits
of sandpaper until cells were clearly visible under magniﬁcation.
We visually crossdated all samples against a master chronology for
Lower Middle Mountain. We used FHX2 software (Grissino-Mayer,
2001) to analyze the ﬁre history data and calculate mean, median,
and Weibull median ﬁre interval statistics. The ﬁt of the Weibull
functions to the ﬁre interval distributions was tested; only results
that ﬁt the data are reported. We analyzed spatial and temporal ﬁre
patterns
statistically
with
percent-scarred
ﬁlters,
a
relative
measure of ﬁre extents assuming that larger ﬁres will have
scarred more trees than smaller ones (Swetnam and Baisan, 1996).
We used a 2-scar minimum to represent ﬁres of any size while
minimizing the chance of including false positives and the 25%-
scarred level to represent the subset of larger ﬁres. The time frame
for our ﬁre history analysis was 1500–1868. The beginning date
was selected where we had a minimum of at least ﬁve recording
sample trees. The ending date was the last ﬁre date; the study area
had not burned since 1868.
Fire–climate relationships were tested using superposed
epoch analysis (in FVS version 3.02; Grissino-Mayer, 1995) on
ﬁres that scarred a minimum of 2 sample trees. SEA compares
climate of the years leading up to the ﬁre and the ﬁre year itself.
Our test window, or epoch, was 11 years taking into account 6
years before the ﬁre year, the ﬁre year, and 4 years after the ﬁre.
Following the approach used at a nearby site by Brown and Wu
(2005), we used two independently derived tree-ring based
climate reconstructions for the SEA: (1) an annual precipitation
reconstruction from northern New Mexico (Grissino-Mayer,
1996), and (2) a summer Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)
reconstruction from the area (Cook et al., 2004). We also assessed
the relationship between ﬁre dates and the Nin˜o3 sea surface
temperature (SST) index (Cook, 2000), a reconstruction of the El
Nin˜o/Southern Oscillation. Signiﬁcance was determined with
bootstrapped conﬁdence intervals (a = .01).
Increment
cores
were
surfaced
and
visually
crossdated
(Stokes and Smiley, 1968) with local tree-ring chronologies.
Rings were counted on cores that could not be crossdated. For
cores that missed the pith, additional years to the center were
estimated with a pith locator consisting of concentric circles
matched to the curvature and density of the inner rings.
Presettlement forest structure was reconstructed at the time of
disruption of the frequent ﬁre regime, circa 1870, following
dendroecological methods described in detail in Fule´ et al.
(1997). We used 1870 as the general ﬁre regime disruption date
for the region (Grissino-Mayer et al., 2004). Tree diameters in
1870 were reconstructed for all living trees by subtracting the
radial growth measured on increment cores since 1870. For dead
trees, the date of death was estimated based on tree condition
class
using
diameter-dependent
snag
decomposition
rates
(Thomas et al., 1979). These models are widely used in ponderosa
pine and have been tested in the Southwest (Fule´ et al., 1997). To
estimate growth between 1870 and death date, we developed
local species-speciﬁc relationships between tree diameter and
basal area increment.
We used non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) to
examine changes in basal area of all tree species over time and
among blocks (Clark, 1993). We used basal area instead of tree
density because basal area is likely to have higher accuracy than
reconstructed tree density using dendroecological data (Moore
et al., 2004). We conducted NMS analyses using PC-ORD software
(version 5.10, McCune and Mefford, 2006). We ran the NMS
ordination using a Bray–Curtis distance measure (Faith et al.,
1987), random starting conﬁgurations, 50 runs with real data, a
maximum of 200 iterations per run and a stability criterion of
0.00001. We compared the stress value of the ﬁnal solution to 50
random solutions using a Monte Carlo test. We ﬁltered out two
species, Pinus edulis (pin˜on pine) and Juniperus scopulorum
(Rocky Mountain juniper), because they did not occur on a
minimum of 5% of the plots (McCune and Grace, 2002). We
determined
the
relationships
between
plant
species
and
ordination axes using the main matrix Pearson’s r correlations
(McCune and Grace, 2002). We considered tree species with the
highest correlation coefﬁcients to have the strongest weight on
the axes.
We examined differences between reconstructed 1870 and
2003 forest structure using a permutational multivariate analysis
of variance (PERMANOVA) (Anderson, 2001; McArdle and Ander-
son,
2001).
PERMANOVA
uses
common
ecological
distance
measures (Bray–Curtis for this study) to examine multivariate
datasets and calculates P-values using permutations, rather than
tabled P-values that assume normality. We used PERMANOVA to
quantify differences in basal area and trees ha1 across time and
among blocks. We used a one ﬁxed factor and one level nested
design with time as our main effect (PC-ORD software version 5.10,
McCune and Mefford, 2006). We analyzed species that were
present in a minimum of 5% of the plots as recommended by
McCune and Grace (2002).
We used indicator-species analysis (McCune and Grace, 2002),
which uses species richness and associated abundance values of
species, to identify species that were particularly consistent
indicators for the analysis dates of 1870 or 2003. A comparison
between the maximum indicator value (0–100) and random trials
for occurrence of a given species (1000 Monte Carlo randomiza-
tions) provided an approximate P-value (McCune and Grace, 2002).
Species

values

(INDVAL = relative abundance x relative frequency; INDVAL ranges
from 0 to 100) were accepted as indicator species for a particular
time period (Dufrene and Legendre, 1997).

We used simple linear regression to examine the relationship
between tree basal area and tree canopy cover using JMP IN
software (version 7.0.1, SAS Institute, 2007).
3. Results
Surface ﬁres were frequent before 1868, burning with multi to
sub-decadal frequency (Fig. 2), as reconstructed from the ﬁre-
scarred samples. We were able to date 20 of the 31 ﬁre-scarred
samples collected. Ring complacency was the chief reason samples
could not be dated. Twenty-nine ﬁre years were dated in the period
from 1500–1868. Two long ﬁre-free periods were notable: no ﬁres
burned from1685 to1735and again from1824 to1861. Comparison
to climate reconstructions shows that the ﬁre free or quiescent
periods coincided with wet periods (Fig. 2). Fire return intervals
prior to ﬁre exclusion ranged from 3 to 50 years with a MFI of 24.3
(11.5) years (Table 2). Fires scarring 25% or more of the samples
occurred at longer intervals (MFI 32.3  23.4 years). Fires tended to
occur in signiﬁcantly dry years, as shown by superposed epoch analysis
(Fig. 3). Signiﬁcantly low precipitation, dry PDSI values, and La Nin˜a
conditions were all associated with ﬁre years. Antecedent climate
conditions were not statistically signiﬁcantly dry or wet, but preceding
years do show a 1–2-year drying pattern before the ﬁre year. There
were statistically signiﬁcant wet or dry years at 3 or 5 years after or
before the ﬁre years in one of the three analyses (Fig. 3); there is no
logical reason to link these patterns with ﬁre occurrence.
Unlike the case of ponderosa pine forests that have been
‘‘invaded’’ by mesic conifers, forest reconstruction showed that the

Lower Middle Mountain area was a true mixture of species both at
the time of ﬁre exclusion and today. However, forest composition
and structure changed substantially, and statistically signiﬁcantly,
between 1870 and 2003 (Table 3). Forest structural data are
presented by experimental block (Table 3, Figs. 4 and 5) to
illustrate variability and to facilitate future comparisons after the
restoration treatments are completed. There was a signiﬁcant
difference between reconstructed 1870 and 2003 tree basal area
(F = 49.6; P = 0.029) (Table 4). There was also a signiﬁcant
difference between reconstructed 1870 and 2003 tree density
(F = 42.3; P = 0.03) (Table 4). There were no differences among
blocks across time for tree basal area (F = 1.21; P = 0.28) or tree
density (F = 1.52; P = 0.12) (Table 4).
Ponderosa pine made up an average 64% of basal area in the
1870 forest (range 54–69%) but only 36% in the 2003 forest (range
27–46%) (Table 3). White ﬁr and Douglas-ﬁr were similar in their
average
proportion
of
basal
area
in
1870,
15%
and
17%,
respectively. By 2003, the Douglas-ﬁr basal area increased by
approximately two times, but the relative contribution of the
species to stand basal area was unchanged at 17%. White ﬁr, on the
other hand, increased in basal area by approximately six times and
made up an average of 35% of total basal area by 2003. White ﬁr
also became the numerically dominant tree species, with an
average of 392 trees ha1, more than twice the average density of
the next species, aspen (146 trees ha1), and far higher than
Douglas-ﬁr (83 trees ha1) or ponderosa pine (56 trees ha1).
The magnitude of the early 1990s tree harvest, estimated from
cut stumps, is a minimal estimate because some tree bases had
deteriorated from decay or the impact of harvesting machinery to
the point that it was not possible to determine if the tree had been
cut or had died and broken at the base. Only conﬁrmed cut stumps
were included in the following ﬁgures: an average of 49 trees ha1
were cut, representing 8.4 m2 ha1 of basal area. For comparison,
this value constitutes 76% of the 1870 average basal area
(11.0 m2 ha1) but only 31% of the 2003 average (27.0 m2 ha1).
White ﬁr trees were the most commonly cut (26 trees ha1,
representing 3.5 m2 ha1). Consistent with the silvicultural goal of
the harvest to reduce white ﬁr dominance, white ﬁrs <45 cm in
diameter made up 68% of the cut trees. Ponderosa pine was less
heavily harvested in terms of density (14 trees ha1) but made up
the largest fraction of basal area removed (3.8 m2 ha1) and cut
trees were generally large; ponderosa pines >45 cm in diameter
made up 76% of the cut pines. Douglas-ﬁr harvest averaged
7 trees ha1 and 1.1 m2 ha1.
Historical diameter distributions in 1870 were unimodal with a
peak at 15 or 25 cm, varying among blocks, and a relatively gentle
decline of the diameter distribution curve to higher values; all sites
had trees at least through the 85-cm diameter class (Fig. 4). Almost
all of the trees  the 45-cm class were ponderosa pines. By 2003,
diameter distributions on all four blocks followed the reverse-J
distribution, indicating strong dominance by small trees, most of
them white ﬁr. However, all blocks still had trees at least through
the 85-cm diameter class and most of the trees  the 45-cm class
were still ponderosa pines. Age distributions showed that tree
establishment was dominated by ponderosa pine prior to 1870 but
white ﬁr established strongly and consistently through most of the
decades after 1870 (Fig. 5). Aspen and Douglas-ﬁr established

periodically throughout the post-1870 period. The most recent
period in Fig. 5, centered on 1990 (covering tree center dates from
1980 to 2000), included the early 1990s harvest and was
dominated by aspen regeneration.
Tree basal area by species in 2003 showed a strong directional
shift away from reconstructed 1870 forest structure (Fig. 6).
Changes along the time gradient (Axis 1) were driven by changes in
basal area and trees ha1 (Fig. 6). White ﬁr had the strongest
positive correlation with the time gradient (r = 0.82) (Table 5).
Ponderosa pine had the strongest negative correlation with the
time gradient (r = 0.24) (Table 5). Conversely, white ﬁr had the
weakest positive correlation with Axis 2 (r = 0.04) and ponderosa
pine had the strongest correlation (r = 0.47). Indicator species
analysis
detected
species
that
were
particularly
consistent
indicators for time (Table 6). Ponderosa pine was the only
indicator species for the reconstructed 1870 data. White ﬁr had
the highest indicator value for 2003 data (Table 6).
The linear regression analysis showed poor correlation between
tree canopy cover and tree basal area (r = 0.11) and therefore we
were unable to reconstruct tree canopy cover in 1870 from the
relationship between tree canopy cover and tree basal area in 2003.
4. Discussion
4.1. Alteration of ﬁre regime
The historical regime of frequent surface ﬁres at Lower Middle
Mountain had similar frequency (mean ﬁre interval 24 years) to
other mixed conifer forests in the San Juan Mountains (average ﬁre
return intervals 21–30 years, Grissino-Mayer et al., 2004), some-
what longer than ﬁre return intervals in mixed conifer forests of
northern Arizona (6–9 years, Fule´ et al., 2003a; 8.7 years, Fule´ et al.,
2003b; 9–10 years, Heinlein et al., 2005), and northern New
Mexico (7–17 years, Touchan et al., 1996) (ranges cover all-scarred
to 25%-scarred ﬁlters). In contrast to more northerly, higher, or
wetter mixed conifer forests where variable-severity ﬁre regimes
have been reported (Fule´ et al., 2003b; Hessburg et al., 2007), at the
scale of individual blocks (64+ ha each) we did not see evidence of
historical severe burning in terms of even-agedness or abrupt
establishment of severe-ﬁre-following species such as aspen. At a
ﬁner scale, the presence of aspen which established in the same
decades as the ﬁres that ended the quiescent periods (1735 and
1861) suggest that patches of lethal ﬁre behavior may have
occurred when the quiescent periods were ended. Fire cessation at
our study area after 1868 was also consistent with general ﬁre
exclusion in the San Juan Mountains after 1871 (Brown and Wu,
2005) to 1880 (Grissino-Mayer et al., 2004). The onset of ﬁre
exclusion occurred abruptly between 1870 and 1900 throughout
the mountains of the Southwest (Swetnam and Baisan, 1996),
coinciding with European settlement and the introduction of
livestock, except for the Chuska Mountains in Arizona where sheep
were introduced in the early 19th century (Savage, 1991) and
northern Mexico where intensive land use was delayed till the
early to mid-20th century (Fule´ et al., 2005).
Prior to ﬁre exclusion, dry climatic patterns were signiﬁcantly
associated with ﬁre years at Lower Middle Mountain. Similar

relationships were observed in ponderosa pine forests nearby by
Brown and Wu (2005) and elsewhere throughout the Southwest
(Swetnam and Baisan, 1996; Swetnam and Betancourt, 1998).
However, years preceding ﬁre were not signiﬁcantly wet, unlike
the wet/dry pattern that was often signiﬁcant at southwestern
ponderosa pine sites (Swetnam and Betancourt, 1998). The fact
that the preceding years are not signiﬁcantly dry leads us to
surmise that mixed conifer forests are not fuel limited like
ponderosa pine forests, in which ﬁre spread was encouraged by the
ﬂush of ﬁne fuels in the form of herbaceous plants accumulating
during one or two wet years before a dry major (spatially
extensive) ﬁre year. Mixed conifer forests are probably productive
enough that the herbaceous and litter fuels are typically present in
sufﬁcient quantities to support ﬁre, but whether they are available
to burn depends on moisture conditions.
4.2. Drivers of forest structural change
Fire exclusion is the most common factor associated with recent
increases in density of mixed conifer forests. However, ﬁre-free
gaps even prior to European settlement may already have begun to
effect change. The two extended ﬁre-free periods observed at
Lower Middle Mountain before 1868 were also documented at
Archuleta Mesa (Brown and Wu, 2005), roughly 15 km away, and
the second gap appears in at least two of the San Juan sites studied
by Grissino-Mayer et al. (2004). At Archuleta Mesa, Brown and Wu
(2005) showed that episodic ponderosa pine recruitment was
favored during unburned intervals. Our data from Lower Middle
Mountain are less temporally precise than those of Brown and Wu
(2005) because we cored trees at a higher point on the stem in
order to develop accurate reconstructions of past diameter. The
Lower Middle Mountain age distributions do not indicate a
recruitment pulse associated with the ﬁrst ﬁre gap (1685–1735),
although it is logical that greater survival of non-pine recruitment
could have occurred during this period, only to be thinned by the
1735 and 1752 ﬁres. A substantial proportion of the non-pine
recruitment at all blocks began during the second period (1824–
1861). White ﬁrs and other trees that established in this unburned
gap had only to survive the 1861 and 1868 ﬁres before entering the
135+ year ﬁre-free period to the present.
Fig. 4. Diameter distributions by species on the four study blocks reconstructed in 1870 and measured in 2003 show a consistent increase in forest density by approximately
an order of magnitude and a shift toward dominance by mesic conifers and aspen.

Frequent-ﬁre periods in mixed conifer gave ponderosa pine a
competitive advantage, allowing them to establish dominance.
During past periods of less frequent ﬁre, ponderosa pines were still
able to persist. After surface ﬁre disturbance was completely
removed from Lower Middle Mountain, however, tree density
increased rapidly and non-pine species dominated. The shade
tolerance of white ﬁr and Douglas-ﬁr gave these species a
competitive advantage for regeneration. Similar changes were
observed in mixed conifer forests of the Grand Canyon where basal
area increased 128%, tree density 380%, and white ﬁr basal area
proportion went from 12% to 35% after ﬁre exclusion beginning in
1880 (Fule´ et al., 2002). On a site in the San Francisco Peaks, northern
Arizona, where white ﬁr was rare, basal area still increased 252% and
tree density 510% after ﬁre exclusion beginning in 1877 (Cocke et al.,
2005). In the absence of white ﬁr, it was Douglas-ﬁr, aspen, and
limber pine that replaced ponderosa pine as the dominant species.
Although increased forest density at Lower Middle Mountain was
similar in relative terms to the changes at the Arizona sites, the
absolute value of basal area in 1870 (9.9–13.3 m2 ha1) was lower
than previously reported in mixed conifer (17.6–28.5 m2 ha1; Fule´
et al., 2002, 2003b; Cocke et al., 2005).
Tree harvesting is a common factor affecting forest structure by
removing large-tree biomass and often facilitating vigorous
regeneration. For example, Sa´nchez Meador et al. (2009) found
that an 1894 harvest in an Arizona ponderosa pine forest removed
2/3 of the basal area, but by 2002 tree density had increased by a
factor of six and basal area had more than doubled. Comparisons
between logged vs. ﬁre-excluded forests in Montana led Naﬁcy and
Sala (2007) to suggest that logging may have been the more
important cause of increased tree densiﬁcation. In the Southwest,
however, there are numerous examples of never-logged ponderosa
pine and some mixed conifer forests that have undergone
extended ﬁre exclusion and have become equally as dense over
the 20th century as logged forests (Covington et al., 1997; Fule´
et al., 2002).
Logging at Lower Middle Mountain occurred nearly a century
later than at many southwestern sites (Sa´nchez Meador et al.,
2009), so tree harvest did not play a role in most of the post-1870
forest changes. However, the removal of approximately 28% of the
ponderosa pine basal area, primarily from larger trees, contributed
to the long-term reduction in pine inﬂuence. Managers also
removed a comparable basal area of white ﬁr, but this species had

1207

become so dominant that the harvest did not restore the historical
balance nor substantially reduce the high ﬁr densities.
4.3. Implications for forest sustainability
In the 135-year period of ﬁre exclusion from 1868 to 2003, the
warm/dry mixed conifer ecosystem at Lower Middle Mountain
changed
from
a
relatively
open,
frequently
burned
forest
dominated by large ponderosa pines to a relatively dense,
unburned forest. White ﬁr has tripled in relative basal area and
is now the numerically dominant species; together with Douglas-
ﬁr and aspen, the mesic species predominate and ponderosa pine
has been reduced to less than 40% of total basal area. Most of these
changes happened in the absence of harvesting, but a recent
harvest in the early 1990s removed large pines. Even though many
ﬁrs were also cut, the overall effect of harvest was to exacerbate the
already altered species composition. The changes at Lower Middle
Mountain are consistent with those at other mixed conifer forests
in southern Colorado and the Southwest (Fule´ et al., 2002; Cocke
et al., 2005; Romme et al., 2006) and the Sierra Nevada of California
(Minnich et al., 1995; Stephens, 2000; Taylor, 2000). What are the
implications
of
these
changes
for
forest
conservation
and
restoration?
The sustainability of dense ﬁre-excluded forests has been
questioned across western North America because of their high
vulnerability to disturbance (Covington and Moore, 1994; Young-
blood et al., 2004). Increased forest density is associated with
reduced growth and greater moisture stress (Stone et al., 1999).
Contiguous canopy fuels in mixed conifer support increased crown
ﬁre activity not only because of higher canopy bulk density but also
because the long crowns and shade-tolerant regeneration of the
mesic species form fuel ladders to conduct ﬁre to the canopy (Fule´
et al., 2004a). Interactions among the disturbance factors of ﬁre,
bark beetles and other insects, and fungal pathogens can accelerate
the process of large-scale mortality (Parker et al., 2006). These
challenges are raised to higher levels by anticipated climate change
Fig. 5. Tree establishment was dominated by ponderosa pine prior to 1870, although white ﬁr, Douglas-ﬁr, and aspen were all present. Dates shown are tree center dates at
coring height (40 cm above ground). Two other species, Engelmann spruce and Rocky Mountain juniper, were so infrequently encountered that they could not be represented
at the scale of the graphs.

effects including increased severity and length of droughts (Seager
et al., 2007), longer and more severe ﬁre seasons (Westerling et al.,
2006), and mild winters that extend the annual number of bark
beetle generations (Waring et al., submitted for publication).
Although not all the tree species at Lower Middle Mountain have
been studied, Shafer et al. (2001) showed that the range of
Douglas-ﬁr was projected to contract in southern Colorado under
three modeled climate scenarios.
The forest restoration experiment initiated at Lower Middle
Mountain is designed to draw upon historical reference informa-
tion while considering future ecosystem resilience. The obstacles
to success are high because the ecological changes that occurred
here since the 19th century have been in exactly the wrong
direction considering the warm, ﬁre-favoring climate expected in
the 21st century. If warm/dry mixed conifer forests of southern
Colorado are to have a reasonable chance for persistence under the
future climate regime, restoring conditions more similar to the
historical characteristics of the frequently burned, open forests of
the past is likely to serve as a useful starting point: introducing
surface ﬁre to reduce ﬁre intervals from centuries to decades,
consuming accumulated surface fuels, thinning dense canopy fuels
and ladder fuels, and counteracting the trend toward reduced
inﬂuence by ﬁre-resistant ponderosa pines.
