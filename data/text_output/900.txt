Twenty Years of Research Data Informs Landscape-
Scale Restoration
In 1995, the Ecological Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona University and
the Bureau of Land Management, Arizona Strip District, formed a partnership to
address concerns about the potential for large, catastrophic wildﬁre and loss of
critical ecosystem services in ponderosa pine forests of Grand Canyon National
Monument. The ERI established a large array of long-term monitoring plots to
study ecosystem responses and effectiveness of restoration on about 4,000
acres. Researchers measured key indicator variables related to forest
structure, vegetation, and hazardous fuels prior to implementing restoration
treatments that included tree thinning and prescribed ﬁre. Following treatments,
researchers periodically re-measured monitoring plots and documented results.

To date, more than 75 scientiﬁc publications have been produced from this
project, providing invaluable information for landscape-scale restoration
planning and adaptive management.  
 
This year, the ERI received funding from the BLM to re-measure the key
indicator variables across the plot array on the GCNM landscape a full 20 years
after the restoration treatments were implemented. This work will support long-
term monitoring of restoration treatment effectiveness and ecosystem
conditions at the landscape scale. The ERI will use plot data from the 2017–
2019 measurements to examine 20-year treatment effectiveness as well as
long-term climate–treatment interactions. Data and maps produced will assist
the BLM in planning activities and adaptive management over the next decade.
Information gathered from this project will be particularly important to managers
in the Southwest, who must understand long-term effects of treatments
implemented at large scales and how they relate to stand-level treatments.

on a ponderosa pine landscape in northern Arizona, USA. Forest Ecology and
Management, 408: 16-24.
A team of ERI ecologists were interested in whether managers were achieving

additional beneﬁts from repeated wildﬁre entries and incrementally restoring
ponderosa pine forests. Their ﬁndings showed that ﬁre re-entry reduced
hazardous fuels but tree density remained substantially higher than the
historical range of variation.

Researchers established plots in high-severity burn patches in two Arizona
wildﬁres, the 2000 Pumpkin and 2002 Rodeo-Chediski ﬁres, to determine if: 1)
distance from forest edge inﬂuences the density and spatial patterns of
regenerating ponderosa pine and sprouting tree species, 2) interactions with re-
sprouting trees affect spatial patterns of ponderosa pine regeneration, and 3)
distance from forest edge and species competition affect regenerating
ponderosa pine height.

A team of NAU researchers used systematic review methodology to investigate
the general effects of ecological restoration treatments on soil function in
frequent-ﬁre forests of the western United States. They used meta-analysis and
qualitative summaries to compare reported responses of macronutrients,
nitrogen cycling, and soil respiration among tree thinning only, prescribed ﬁre
only, and thinning plus prescribed ﬁre treatments.

This fact sheet summarizes information from a global literature search on total
forest ecosystem carbon gains or losses in response to management
treatments. The objective of the study was to compare the amount of carbon
stored in multiple ecosystem carbon components in managed versus
unmanaged forests, and to more fully understand the carbon costs and beneﬁts
of a wide variety of forest management strategies.

There have been relatively few ﬁre history reconstructions published for
southwestern transitional pine forests, particularly those adjacent to, or
intermixed with, interior chaparral communities. Information from this synthesis
project suggests that frequent surface ﬁres likely kept forests in open structural
conditions and limited establishment and regeneration of sprouting woody
species.

Research and Development – 2017 Summer Field Season
Overview 
By ERI R&D Staff
The 2017 ﬁeld season included new research studies as well as re-
measurement of long-term projects. In partnership with the U.S. Forest Service,
Bureau of Land Management and National Park Service, ERI crews collected
data on three projects. The ﬁrst began in mid-May with the re-measurement of
a study implemented in 2004 near Tusayan, south of Grand Canyon National
Park. The study follows up on published research examining the effects of
overstory thinning and prescribed ﬁre treatments on tree size, distribution,
species composition, and growth, understory plant species abundance and
diversity, and fuel loadings in pinyon-juniper woodlands. 
Crews then spent the ﬁeld season re-measuring plots on a landscape-scale
ecological restoration study near Mt. Trumbull, north of the Grand Canyon.
Plots were installed in the mid-1990s over approximately 4,000 acres that have
since been thinned and prescribed burned. Data were gathered to measure
overstory growth and survival, fuel loadings, efﬁcacy of seeding, and
herbaceous understory composition. 
Lastly, crews collected historic and contemporary forest structure data as well
as ﬁre scar samples across ﬁve, ~300-acre sites on the Prescott and Tonto
national forests. This study will provide baseline information on forest structure
and disturbance process to help inform management decisions regarding fuels

treatments and forest restoration on two valuable yet understudied transitional
pine forests.        
ERI undergraduate student researchers have also been hard at work collecting
data and running analyses for their senior projects. Jessica Archibald is
examining the effects of climate change on the Bebb Willow (Salix bebbiana) at
Hart Prairie, AZ. Logan Gonzalez is studying the long-term effects of
jackstrawing on aspen regeneration and large ungulate presence on the
Schultz Fire, Coconino National Forest, AZ. Meredith Prentice studied public
perceptions of the Flagstaff Watershed Protection Project near Flagstaff. Elena
Schaefer is conducting a population study of Penstemon clutei (Sunset Crater
beardtongue) on the CNF and Sunset Crater National Monument. Siana Turner
is testing germination requirements of Ligusticum porteri (oshá). 
The knowledge from these studies will enhance our understanding of
landscape-scale restoration in ponderosa pine forests, juniper woodlands, and
ponderosa pine/interior chaparral communities across the Southwest.

ERI Science Delivery and Outreach News 
By Amy Waltz, Director of Science Delivery
We are committed to assessing the latest science needs and communicating
primary restoration science to our land management partners to better meet
forest management goals. A few highlights across this broad program of work

include:
 
West-Wide. ERI staff are contributing to a book on the lessons learned and
success of the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration program. They met
together in Florida with other authors to reﬁne the chapters and develop key
policy recommendations based on the 10-year program, funded in 2009. Key
outcomes include better understanding the role of collaboration in federal land
planning, implementation, monitoring, and adaptive management processes.
 
Partner Forest Projects. ERI Science Delivery staff worked closely with
Coconino County Parks and Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire
Management to include a 15-acre forest restoration demonstration at Ft. Tuthill
County Park in Flagstaff, AZ. Ft. Tuthill is home to the county fair and countless
other recreation events including local races, expositions, music shows, and
competitive horse events. The park averages more than 200,000 visitors a
year. The restoration unit is adjacent to an additional 240 acres of thinning and
restoration and will be complemented with visitor interpretation signage,
provided by the Greater Flagstaff Forest Partnership. More information can be
found here.
 
Kaibab National Forest Science and Planning Support. The ERI works
closely as a technical and collaborative partner with USFS; however, data
sharing among academic and land management agencies is challenging due to
both institutional and technical limitations. The Kaibab NF approached ERI to
add capacity to forest plan monitoring, and also to better explore how to
increase efﬁciency in partner data collection that can be incorporated into
government data sets. The ERI collected data from 80 additional plots, adding
key variables of historic forest structure not usually collected by USFS plots.
The data was collected using USFS data entry software, and entered into
USFS databases; the additional data will be analyzed by the ERI to be included
in a ﬁnal report.
