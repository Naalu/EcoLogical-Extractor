Planting to Restore Ponderosa Pine Sites Burned by High-Severity Fire 
 
By John Paul Roccaforte, ERI Research Specialist, Sr. 
Introduction 
Increases in landscape-scale wildfires in frequent-fire for-
ests over the last several decades have led to management 
concerns regarding long-term restoration of severely 
burned sites. In particular, interior areas of large, high-
severity patches may lack conifer regeneration for decades 
(Savage and Mast 2005, Passovoy and Fulé 2006, Haire 
and McGarigal 2010, Roccaforte et al. 2012). A lack of 
tree regeneration may result in type conversion from sites 
historically dominated by coniferous forests to persistent 
non-forested areas (Figure 1) (Barton 2002, Strom and 
Fulé 2007). Based on these concerns, managers have at 
times aggressively pursued replanting of burned-over sites 
with conifers, with the result that many planted areas 
eventually become overly dense with trees to the point 
that eventually crown fires are bound to recur. To avoid 
this problem and to assure long-term restoration of forest 
structure including natural openings, consideration should 
be given to reestablishment of reference species composi-
tion, natural ranges and variability in tree densities, and 
spatial arrangement of trees in a functional ecosystem.  
 
This fact sheet outlines a relatively new approach—one 
based on ecological restoration principles—for tree plant-
ing after high-severity wildfire in southwestern frequent-
fire forests. Historically, land managers were directed to 
reestablish full site stocking with an emphasis on future 
timber production. Presently, concern for restoration of 
long-term resilience and ecological function directs man-
agers to consider natural ranges of variability (reference 
conditions) in tree density and spatial arrangement to 
guide replanting strategies. We use the Forest Vegetation 
Simulator (FVS) to demonstrate planting densities that 
emulate pre-fire exclusion reference conditions at the mid-
scale range of 10–1,000 acres (Reynolds et al. 2013). In 
the absence of subsequent management, higher initial planting densities will likely lead to poor forest health 
and increased crown fire hazard.

History of Ponderosa Pine Planting in the Southwest 
There is a rich history of research related to tree regeneration in southwestern forests dating back to the early 
20th century. The Fort Valley Experiment Station was established in 1908 to study the apparent lack of suf-
ficient natural regeneration in ponderosa pine forests (Fletcher 1979). Research from 1912 into the 1930s 
helped develop detailed guidelines for planting to achieve optimal seedling survival and stocking (Larson 
1957, Hayes 1961; Heidmann 1963, see also Heidmann 2008). Schubert and his colleagues (1969) summa-
rized these recommendations and produced a simple planting guide. Although guidelines concerning plant-
ing density are presently flexible and allow silviculturists to customize planting programs to meet local ob-
jectives (USFS Region 3 2002), managers historically aimed to reestablish full site stocking. For example, 
Schubert (1974) recommended planting 680 trees per acre at an 8-by-8-foot spacing based on the assump-
tion that 50 percent of the seedlings would survive and attain a diameter of five inches. These 340 surviving, 
5-inch trees would be needed for a growing stock level of 80 (Schubert 1974). Studies that discussed plant-
ing arrangement always recommended even spacing insofar as possible (e.g., Heidmann et al. 1977), alt-
hough Schubert (1974) noted the importance of planting in the best spots, even at the expense of consistent 
spacing between trees. 
 
Funding for reforestation programs has declined in recent decades (Burch 2005), although reforestation is 
still mandated under the Anderson-Mansfield Reforestation and Revegetation Joint Resolution Act of 1949 
(at 16 U.S.C. 581j and 581 j(note)) and the National Forest Management Act of 1976. 
Using Reference Conditions to Guide Planting Decisions 
Extensive research over the last few decades has indicated that tree density in southwestern ponderosa pine 
forests historically ranged about 20 to 50 ponderosa pines per acre prior to the widespread interruption of 
the frequent surface fire regime (Stoddard 2011). From a timber production standpoint, sites were under-
stocked (Woolsey 1911). In addition, before fire exclusion, trees often showed aggregated spatial patterns, 
with tree groups of varying sizes and single trees surrounded by a predominant matrix of grassy openings 
(Sánchez Meador et al. 2011, Larson and Churchill 2012). Tree groups ranged from less than one-tenth of 
an acre in size to nearly one acre, with two to 72 trees per group. Frequent surface fires and grass competi-
tion sufficiently maintained open conditions with regeneration rates as low as 1.5 trees per acre per decade 
(Mast et al. 1999, Bailey and Covington 2002). Open forests with scattered groups of trees provided a wide 
range of habitats for a diversity of animals and plant life, and were resilient to frequent occurrence of fire. 
Today, many of these forests are overly dense with trees due to decades of fire exclusion and are degraded 
in terms of forest health and resilience to wildfire (Covington and Moore 1994, Dahms and Geils 1997).  
 
Replanting severely burned areas in a pattern that emulates natural patterns of healthy forests that historical-
ly occurred on the site is one way to promote resilient forests that function within their historical range of 
variability. For southwestern ponderosa pine forests, this translates to planting fewer trees than the tradition-
al full stocking approach. On many sites, this also requires planting trees in various sized groups and leaving 
unplanted openings, which often occupied 60 to 80 percent of the area in presettlement stands (Covington 
and Sackett 1992, Covington and Moore 1994). In Table 1, Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) projections 
using varying planting densities and assumed survival rates suggest that multi-resource goals are likely to be 
met at intermediate planting levels. Table 1 shows that, depending on site index (the potential productive 
quality of an area where trees grow) and assuming 50 percent survival (Schubert 1974, Ouzts 2014), plant-
ing from 60–100 seedlings per acre will, after 80 years, result in tree densities similar to those found in his-
torical tree density studies (Stoddard 2011) and recommended by Covington et al. (1997) for restoring 
stands to within natural ranges of structural variability. In contrast, FVS predictions indicate that planting 
300 seedlings per acre will result in tree densities well above the historical range of variability reported by 
Stoddard (2011). Managers should plan post-fire reforestation efforts that promote resilient future forests 
while recognizing that stands planted with too many seedlings have the potential to become overly dense 
and susceptible to crown fire. 
 
Although FVS does not account for variations in tree spatial arrangement, use of this tool can help land 
managers evaluate relative differences among planting scenarios. By studying these differences, practition-
ers can determine strategies for reaching forest health goals over time.  
 

 
Future Research and Monitoring 
Monitoring and evaluation of successes and failures is needed for restoration of severe wildfire sites. Near-
term monitoring should document the planting objectives and strategy, site selection criteria and site condi-
tions, planting technique, density, and arrangement in addition to initial seedling survival and planting costs. 
Longer-term studies should continue to monitor tree survival but also assess responses of other important 
ecosystem components. An additional potential study could test drought-resistant genotypes in anticipation 
of climate change. Long-term monitoring will help managers strengthen adaptive management frameworks 
and ensure that sound, evidence-based decisions are made.
