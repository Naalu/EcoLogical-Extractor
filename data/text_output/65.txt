ERI–Issues in Forest Restoration

The Ecological Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona University is a pioneer in researching,
implementing, and monitoring ecological restoration projects in the dry, frequent-fire forests of the
western United States. These forests have been significantly altered over the last century, which has
resulted in decreased ecological and recreational values, near-elimination of natural low-intensity fire
regimes, and greatly increased risk of large-scale fires. The ERI is working with public agencies and
other partners to restore these forests to a more ecologically healthy condition and trajectory—in the
process helping to significantly reduce the threat of catastrophic wildfire and its effects on human,
animal, and plant communities.

Executive Summary
In this study I assessed the potential economic impacts of planned and proposed restoration treatments on
four national forests in northern Arizona to help land managers and community leaders understand the
social and economic development opportunities that can be leveraged through ecological restoration
projects. I estimated potential economic impacts that can result from implementing two collaboratively
developed treatment scenarios as well as from treating those acres that have already undergone the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance process (i.e., NEPA-ready acres). The results
from Input-Output modeling and an IMPLAN analysis indicate that treating the NEPA-ready acres can
generate $273 million of outputs, $146 million of labor income, and about 3,000 jobs. Restorative
mechanical thinning treatments create slightly more jobs per dollar invested than prescribed burning
treatments (16.0 compared to 13.6 jobs per million dollars of federal spending). The largest treatment
scenario (mechanically treating 1.7 million acres) would cost about $1 billion at the current rate, but
generate more than $1.3 billion of total output, $518 million of labor income, and 14,820 jobs to local
economies. These results do not include potentially significant economic advantages from using woody
biomass generated by mechanical thinning treatments. In addition to ecological and energy benefits,
ecological restoration treatments can create sustainable, “green collar” jobs in rural communities of the
Southwest and generate social and economic benefits. To be sustainable, planning for ecological
restoration should include qualitative and quantitative monitoring of social and economic conditions, in
addition to ecological outcomes of the treatments. This study provides baseline information for such
monitoring efforts.

Introduction
The ecological conditions and processes of ponderosa pine ecosystems in the Southwest have been
dramatically altered by past management, which was driven by the utilitarian philosophy of the
Progressive Era (Cortner and Moote 1999). Under the “gospel of efficiency” (Hays 1959), the scientific
management of forest fires was translated into the effective protection of resources against fire (Nelson
2000). Researchers of southwestern ponderosa pine ecosystems have since documented many unintended
ecological consequences of these policies, especially the overstocked forests that are susceptible to
catastrophic wildfires and damage from pathogen and insects, as well as the loss of understory diversity
and degraded wildlife habitat (Covington and Moore 1994).
There have been significant research and restoration efforts that support the need for large-scale
restoration treatments by prescribed burning and mechanical thinning (e.g., Fulé et al. 2002, Fulé 2008).
For surface fire-adapted tree species, such as ponderosa pine, reducing forest density significantly decreases
wildfire intensity and also helps recreate the structure, composition, and functions of healthy forested
ecosystems (Fulé 2008). However, the management focus of federal land-management agencies is still on
fire suppression rather than proactive management that promotes diverse forest values (Snider et al. 2006).
Along with the inertia of past management history, there are several socio-economic factors that pose
challenges to initiating large-scale ecological restoration treatments in the Southwest. One of the most
significant challenges is the cost of removing unwanted trees (GAO 2005a, b; USFS 2003). While value-
added utilization of removed biomass provides an opportunity to offset the high costs of thinning, thinned
materials have low market value, and the timber and wood-processing capacity in the region has all but
disappeared in recent decades (Morgan et al. 2006). Adding to the complexity of the situation, there are
2

increasing numbers of people living in forested environments throughout the United States, especially in
the western states (Radeloff and colleagues 2005). With the expansion of this Wildland-Urban Interface
(WUI), protecting human life and properties become more challenging while human-caused fire ignitions
become more common. Thus, already limited resources for restoration-related forest management have
been diverted to fire prevention and community preparedness projects for the WUI (Haight et al. 2004),
where protecting social and economic interests are the primary goals.
Understanding social and economic impacts of ecological restoration projects help us overcome these
challenges. With careful planning, forest management activities to restore ecosystems can also provide the
opportunity for new or revived forestry and wood products industries in many rural communities.
Providing jobs and developing infrastructure can also encourage building social capital through actively
engaging local populations in restoration and stewardship projects, which, in turn, would aid future
collaborative planning.
In this study, I evaluated potential economic impacts of ecological restoration projects in northern Arizona
to provide a base for such planning. The focus is on those communities neighboring the four national
forests that were included in the Analysis of Small-Diameter Wood Supply in Northern Arizona
(hereafter referred to as the WSA or Wood Supply Analysis, Hampton et al. 2008). The most recent (FY
08) transaction evidence was gathered, along with the potential treatment acreages and locations, in order
to estimate costs of the proposed treatments. Using an Input-Output model, I projected the economic
impacts on surrounding local economies from planned and proposed ecological restoration treatments. I
believe the results of this study will help land managers and community leaders understand the social and
economic contexts of the proposed activities, and allow them to take full advantage of social and economic
development opportunities that can be leveraged through such projects.
Previous Research Findings
Although jobs and income may be the economic indicators most appreciated by the public, there have not
been many studies that document the economic impacts of forest thinning treatments to promote
ecological restoration. Nonetheless, those that have been conducted are instructive. For example, Alward
and colleagues (2003) estimated the economic impacts of the Forest Service’s Southwestern Region
Forest-based Community Economic Development Grant Program in the two sub-state area of New
Mexico and Arizona during years of 2000-2001. This grant program encourages the development of
sustainable economic endeavors, including small-diameter wood utilization. They estimated that forest-
based community economic grants (total $6 million) generated 237 local jobs and $1.7 million in local
income in the Apache-Sitgreaves area of east-central Arizona and Lincoln area of southern New Mexico.
More recently, Kerkvliet (2008) analyzed the economic impacts of the Blackfoot Clearwater Stewardship
Project in Montana, which included diverse land management activities as well as fuel reduction
treatments. Federal spending for the project was about $5.1 million (2006 dollars) and it generated a final
demand (goods and services bought for consumption) of $9.93 million with an increase of 68.5 total jobs.
Hjerpe and I (2008) estimated the economic impacts of the fuels reduction programs in the Gila National
Forest in New Mexico, San Juan National Forest in Colorado, and Coconino, Kaibab, and Apache-
Sitgreaves national forests in Arizona. Using the treatment costs and acreages reported, we estimated the
local costs of prescribed burning and mechanical treatments, and projected the subsequent economic
impacts. In total, these five national forests treated 59,720 acres in fiscal year 2005 under the fuels
reduction program. The results show that the expenditures for fuel reduction treatments alone accounted
for more than $40 million of total output in the local economy and helped generate about 500 jobs.

Carefully planned restoration and stewardship activities also help establish stable and predictable supplies
of raw materials (biomass) that encourage local business start-ups, especially high-value wood products
from small-diameter trees and biomass for bioenergy production. For example, the construction of an
oriented-strand board (OSB) facility in Winslow, AZ would generate $244 million of economic output
and more than 1,000 jobs, and its operation would create total output of $170 million and almost 600 jobs
annually to the regional economy  (Hjerpe and Gunderson 2007). Keegan and other researchers (2004) estimated
that treating 64,000 acres of high- to moderate-hazard ponderosa pine in Montana would generate 3,000 jobs and
more than $90 million in labor income, assuming that the removed logs were used as sawtimber. Also, woody biomass
utilization, especially biomass energy development, could create significant economic impacts. In Mississippi, Perez-
Verdin and colleagues (2008) showed that significant economic impacts can be generated by recovering all available
logging and thinning residues, and utilizing them for bioenergy. These activities alone would generate 1,712 jobs.
Kammen and others (2004) reviewed 13 independent reports and studies that analyzed the economic and
employment effects of the clean energy industry, including biomass energy, in the United States and Europe.
They concluded that investment in renewable energy generates more jobs per dollar invested (also more
jobs per unit of energy delivered) than the fossil fuel energy sector.
Methods
Study Area
The study area includes five counties in Arizona (Navajo, Apache, Greenlee, Coconino, and Gila). The
administrative boundaries of these counties overlap with the analysis area defined in the WSA, which
includes 2.4-million acres of ponderosa pine-dominated lands within all or part of four national forests in
north-central Arizona (Figure 1). I estimated the economic impacts by considering the five counties as one
impact area. (However, I also estimated the economic impacts for each national forest by using impact
regions specific to each forest for the forest-level analysis; see Appendix 1).

communities of economic activities. Map courtesy of Joe Crouse, ERI

Although the administrative boundaries of each national forest cross multiple counties, I defined the main
economic area of each national forest as the county (or counties) that contain communities with direct
access to the forest where most agency employees are likely to reside and local purchases are made (Table
1). Defining the affected economic area is an important issue in regional economic impact studies because
there is a danger of overestimating multiplier effects and expenditure retention if the economic area is
defined beyond the most-affected area (Hjerpe and Kim 2007). In order to provide the most relevant
information that link land management activities to local economies, I defined the affected economic area
conservatively using county-level data.1
Table 1. Defined economic areas for four national forests
Demographics
The five counties selected for this study share some common characteristics, including slower population
and economic growth than the Arizona state averages. Table 2 summarizes the latest demographic
information available for five counties. Population growth was fastest in Navajo County (15.7%), although
it was still slower than the state average. The median household income was the least in Apache County,
where 33% of population lives below poverty. The latest rates of unemployment (not seasonally adjusted;
as of Nov. 2009) ranged from 8.1% to 16.4 and are, on average, well above the state and national averages
(8.7% and 9.4%, respectively). The defined regional economy has a total of 230 active industrial sectors,
with a total output of approximately $19 billion and 155,000 people employed in 2007.

Data Collection Process and Assumptions
In addition to collecting data about the study area, a colleague collected data about the size of the two
proposed treatment areas in the WSA and the estimated project costs for each of the four national forests.
The 20-member WSA working group developed two proposed treatment scenarios—the consensus
scenario and the majority scenario. The “consensus scenario” involves treating 41% of the analysis area,
which the group unanimously agreed to treat mechanically. A majority of the working group agreed that
an additional 33% of the analysis area could also be treated mechanically. Unfortunately, exact acreages and
locations of the consensus scenario area were not available for each national forest. However, after
consulting with one of the main WSA analysts, she and I determined that the treated area per forest under
the consensus scenario was 59.4% of the treated area per forest under the majority scenario (Hampton
personal communication 2009). In addition, I projected the economic impacts of treating those federally
managed areas that have already passed the NEPA-compliance process. The consensus and majority
scenarios include these acres.
The cost of the proposed treatments includes many different components, which can be classified into two
categories: 1) operation costs directly related to applying the treatment itself (e.g., equipments and labor);
2) administrative costs (e.g., project planning, site preparation, and monitoring). In addition, the proposed
treatments need to go through the process for NEPA compliance, and the costs associated with the process
(e.g., archeological surveys and documentation) should also be included in the administrative costs. Four
national forests were contacted to gather the most recent transaction evidence (FY 2008), expert opinions,
and planning estimates at each national forest. Based on these estimates and previously published papers
in this region (Larson and Mirth 2004, Hjerpe and Kim 2008), I calculated an average cost per acre for
the proposed treatments in each national forest.
Although the study is based on the most recent and reliable estimates, some assumptions were necessary
to generate estimates of average treatment costs per acre. The following sources of variation were not
incorporated into treatment cost calculations, but should be acknowledged.
• Treatment costs for the Forest Service consist of fixed (e.g., administrative costs) and variable
costs (e.g., operation costs). Fixed cost per acre would decrease significantly as the project size
increases. In most cases, national forests reported average costs by dividing total expenditure by
the treated acres. This is most evident in cost variations for prescribed burning, where cost per
acre varies a great deal depending on project sizes and locations.
• The administrative costs incurred by public agencies are mostly fixed costs often spread out over
many years and involve multiple branches within the agency, which make it difficult to estimate a
per acre base. The cost estimates also vary depending on how much planning, preparation,
operations, and monitoring are done by agency personnel, rather than contracted out.
• Treatments within WUI are likely to be more expensive because the treatments are smaller in size
and require more personnel and equipment as well as more intensive monitoring (see Berry and
Hesseln 2004, Calkin and Gebert 2006).
• Treatment costs likely vary depending on site conditions and the intensity of treatments.
Engineering-cost estimation models that can account for such variations are often designed to
minimize cost per harvested volume of merchantable timber and are not directly applicable to
ecological restoration treatments (Rummer 2008), especially in the Southwest where the majority
of removed volume is likely sub-merchantable in the conventional sense. Ecological restoration
treatments are different than commercial harvesting in terms of objectives, methods, and
outcomes. To achieve full restoration goals, the treatments should be designed to emulate the
structure of pre-settlement forests (e.g., grouped/clumpy stand structure rather than even-spaced),
6

treat fuel loads, and restore fire in prescription as well as reducing stand densities (Fule et al.
2002). Without these additional operations, logging itself can actually exacerbate fire risk by 
deteriorating site conditions (Rummer 2008).
There are also inherent limitations to estimating costs based on expert opinion, transaction evidence, and
planning estimates. As Rummer (2008) points out, these estimates document costs after the event, and
may not accurately reflect changing treatment conditions and technology. In fact, the Office of
Management and Budget believes that the agencies cannot produce credible, long-term funding estimates
for wildland fire risk reduction treatments at this point, and allows the agencies to publish the estimates
only with sufficiently reliable data (GAO 2006).
Input-Output Model and IMPLAN
Input-Output (I-O) models have been used to investigate the economic impacts of forest management
practices and changes in natural resource policy (e.g., Waters et al. 1997, Cox and Munn 2001). The
USDA Forest Service routinely uses I-O modeling to determine regional economic impacts of agency
decisions as part of the environmental impact assessment (under social and economic impact assessment)
required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Many economists have also used the I-O
model to show that outdoor recreation activities create substantial jobs and income, and to counter the
argument that the preservation of natural resources necessitates a loss of jobs (e.g., Douglas and Harpman
1995, Hjerpe and Kim 2007).
Input-Output models estimate the economic linkages of industries within a regional economy in terms of
the multipliers that indicate the size of the total effects of "new money" into the economy. When the
multiplier is 2, it means every new dollar that comes into the local economy ends up creating $2 worth of
economic activities, which can be measured in terms of output, income, and employment. The model
follows the flow of money and estimates economic “impacts” within a pre-defined economic area. For
example, when a local logging operator receives a forest thinning contract, regional expenditures stemming
from the project generate "new money" that can be calculated (direct effects). The effects of "new money"
on the local economy, in turn, continue to multiply. The logging operator buys more goods and services
from other local businesses (indirect effects), and employees of the operation spend more money within
the local economy for living expenses and other needs with their increased income (induced effects). When
new money for materials and services is spent outside the region (leakage), the total effect (the sum of
direct, indirect, and induced effects) will be smaller. If the majority of materials and services derive from
within the region, the total effects will be larger. Thus, a multiplier is the ratio between total and direct
impacts.
It should be noted, however, that I-O models are sensitive to the economic sectors to which the economist
applies the final demands, and, thus, different approaches may yield different results. In this study, I
followed the methodology developed in a previous study (Hjerpe and Kim 2008), where expenditures for
fuel treatments were allocated to different sectors based on interviews with Forest Service managers, and
local wood harvesters and processors. The accuracy of economic impact estimates can be improved by
having more detailed data about which sectors received federal spending for specific treatments. I-O
models also assume that the economic structure of each area is complete and static, and the production
functions are linear and based on the constant returns to scale (Isard et al 1998). However, these
assumptions are less problematic in economic analysis in sub-regional or regional scale than in national-
scale forecasting (West 1995).
7

In this study, I analyzed the economic impacts of federal spending associated with ecological restoration
treatments with an I-O model using IMPLAN (Impact Analysis for Planning).
Researchers have found IMPLAN results are reliable when compared to those from other I-O models
(Crihfield and Campbell 1991, Rickman and Schwer, 1995). The IMPLAN model includes a database
containing information about regional economies, and an economic modeling program (a static I-O
model) that traces the flow of materials and services to estimate the economic impact of industries on the
regional economy. The IMPLAN data files include information for 440 different industries and 21
different economic variables. I used the most recent IMPLAN data files available (2007) for those
counties in the study area. The data were used in conjunction with other sources, such as U.S. Census
Bureau, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and primary data from the four national forests. After calculating
total costs for different treatment scenarios, federal spending for proposed treatments was allocated to the
appropriate regional sectors in IMPLAN. I allocated expenditures for prescribed burning to two sectors:
“Federal non-military,” and “Other state and local.” Expenditures for mechanical thinning were allocated
to three sectors: “Logging,” “Agriculture and Forestry Support,” and “Federal Non-military.” All
administrative costs were allocated to the “Federal non-military” sector. I used regional purchasing
coefficients (RPCs) that the IMPLAN model provides for each industry in this region to calculate a
portion of the expenditures immediately lost from the region.
Results
Costs of the Proposed Restoration Treatments
Table 3 presents average operation costs for mechanical thinning and prescribed burning treatments
reported by each of the four national forests.
Table 3. Average operation costs per acre for prescribed burning and mechanical thinning (reported
by the four national forests for FY 08)
In terms of the administrative cost for prescribed burning, I estimated it at $50/acre, which includes
$25/acre for preparation and monitoring, and $25/acre for project planning. Administrative cost for
mechanical thinning is estimated at $108/acre,2 which includes $55/acre for timber preparation, $8/acre
for monitoring, and $45/acre for pile burning. The NEPA compliance cost is estimated at $63/acre
(Larson and Mirth 2004). I estimated these administration costs3 based on personal communications with
fuel specialists at each national forest and the findings of previously published papers in the region (Larson
and Mirth 2004, Hjerpe and Kim 2008).

Costs of Treating the NEPA-ready Acres 
According to fuel specialists from the four national forests, there are slightly less than 1 million acres of
planned treatments that are NEPA-ready, and they estimate that those acres would cost about 214 million
dollars to treat (7% of the FY 2008 federal spending in the area). However, the actual future treatment
costs could be substantially low than the average cost reported here as markets develop for woody biomass
utilization. Table 4 presents the planned acres and costs for prescribed burning and mechanical treatments
that are in compliance with the NEPA process. The total treatment cost estimates do not include NEPA
compliance cost incurred previously.
Table 4. NEPA-ready acres and total costs for treatments
Economic Impacts of Treating NEPA-ready Acres
Table 5 presents the projected economic impacts of the NEPA-ready acres in three parts: output, employment, and
labor income. Treating the NEPA–ready acres for prescribed burning is projected to generate $144 million in output,
$99 million in labor income, and create 1,675 jobs throughout the economy. Meanwhile, treating those acres with
mechanical thinning would generate $129 million in output, $47 million in labor income, and create 1,456 jobs,
including indirect and induced effects.
The multipliers are generally lower for prescribed burning treatments than those for mechanical thinning
because federal spending on mechanical thinning creates more sales, jobs, and income per dollar invested
to the local economy. In this situation, however, prescribe burning had a greater overall economic impact
because the NEPA-ready acres for mechanical thinning are less than one-quarter of those that will be
treated with prescribed burning.
______________________________
2 Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest reported their estimates of planning cost ($270/acre). I have used that number, because their thinning projects
operate under a stewardship contract unique to the forest.
3 The National Fire Plan Operations & Reporting System (NFPORS) database contains the cost information for hazardous fuel reduction
treatments. The treatment costs information is not applicable to this study because the treated acres reported include the acreage of wildland fire-
use fires. The planning costs were reported with the number of projects, not with the acreage. I have calculated the average planning cost per acre
($117/acre in FY 2006) in the southwestern region using average project size, which was consistent with our estimates for planning cost
($108/acre).

I also calculated the total treatment cost for each WSA scenario for each national forest based on the
mechanical thinning treatment costs reported and the total administration costs, including costs for
NEPA compliance (Table 6). At the current rate, it would cost close to $1 billion to treat the majority
scenario area of 1.7 million acres. Average treatment cost across four national forests is $552/acre
including administrative and NEPA compliance costs.

Economic Impacts of WSA Proposed Treatments
The economic impacts of two mechanical thinning treatment scenarios (WSA consensus scenario, and
WSA majority scenarios) were proportional to the size of proposed treatments. The majority scenario
would be the largest treatment scenario, and would generate $877 million of direct output, 10,800 jobs,
and $406 million in labor income (Table 7). These direct impacts would stimulate more expenditure in
other local businesses and generate further economic impacts in the area. In total, more than $1.3 billion
dollars of output, $518 million of labor income, and 14,820 jobs would be generated in the economic area
by this level of treatment (Table 7). I also estimated the potential economic impacts for individual national
forests and their economic area (see Appendix I).
Table 7. Economic impacts of the proposed treatments
These estimates are based on current economic structure and did not include possible utilization of woody
biomass harvested. Even with no biomass utilization, mechanical thinning treatments create more jobs per
dollar invested (16 jobs per million dollars) than prescribed burning (13.6 jobs per million dollars). If the
appropriately scaled industry is realized in this area, the treatment costs for mechanical thinning can be
paid by the industry that utilizes harvested small-diameter woods and woody biomass. Once stable and
predictable supplies of raw materials (biomass) are established, a number of new local businesses and their
support industries will be in place. The introduction of woody biomass utilization is likely to increase
economic impacts and improve multiplier impacts by enhancing local retention of treatment costs and
revenues.
The study results show that the magnitude of economic impacts that can be generated by increased federal
spending assuming constant returns to scale and fixed technical coefficients (i.e., implying no new
technology). For example, when large-scale mechanical thinning treatments are implemented, related
industries are likely to grow bigger and gain more efficiency in their production.This economy of scale and
changes in technology may prove that the number of jobs generated by the treatments may be smaller than
what is estimated here. Also, if larger management programs are increasingly contracted to outside
operators who bring in a mobile, trained workforce with new and more efficient equipment, revenues will
be exported outside the area.The multipliers, and hence net economic impacts, are strengthened by cultivating
local businesses, which in turn may be reinvested in fuels reduction efforts tied to wood utilization.

Discussion
The economic impacts shown in this study demonstrate that federal spending for ecological restoration
treatments could generate a substantial economic stimulus in northern Arizona. In addition to economic
opportunities, ecological restoration treatments promote a wide range of ecosystem services from
enhanced ecosystem conditions and process, as well as avoided losses of life and property due to wildfire
and reduced fire suppression costs. Mason and colleagues (2006) found that the overall benefits of
government investments in fuel reductions are substantial when they account for avoided fire suppression
costs, avoided fatalities, and the economic values of protected ecological services (i.e., minimum net
benefits ranging from $600/acre for moderate-risk forests to $1,400 per acre for high-risk forests).
Furthermore, the costs of suppressing fires have risen significantly during the past two decades due to an
increase in acres burned as well as an increase in suppression costs per acre (Prestemon et al. 2008). In
2008, the U.S. Forest Service and the Department of Interior spent $1.86 billion for fire suppression.
Snider et al. (2006) calculated the present values of fire suppression costs for various treatment scenarios.
Assuming one-third of the forests in Arizona and New Mexico require thinning treatments, treating just
5% of the required acreage (163,000 acres) annually would reduce fire suppression costs by $600 million
over time.
Some researchers, such as Loomis and Walsh (1997), argued that the economic impacts of natural resource
management need to be carefully evaluated in given social and economic contexts. For instance, generating
economic impacts in an area with a low unemployment rate might displace employment from other sectors
or economic areas, which may or may not be socially desirable. Positive economic impacts may also be
offset by negative environmental and social costs of development. For example, the economic impacts of
outdoor recreation development may be countered by the costs of congestion, increasing living costs for
local residents, lost opportunities for other types of resource development, and added pressure on existing
infrastructure. It can also be argued that the economic impacts of fuel reduction treatments might be
countered by poor air quality on burning days and increased traffic accidents from obscured highways.
However, these and other negative effects tend to be temporary. Investments for ecological restoration
actually enhance ecological and social environments of communities in the long term through avoided
disasters and improved recreation opportunities as well as securing the flow of various ecosystem services.
In fact, insufficient accounting of the total benefits of restoration has been cited as one of the major
barriers of southwestern ponderosa pine restoration (Hjerpe et al. 2009). One of the indirect economic
benefits of ecological restoration is an improved natural environment. Natural amenities have consistently
been shown to be a major factor driving population growth in areas around public forest lands. (Garber-
Yonts 2004). Recent studies disputed the notion that amenity-driven rural population growth yield only
low-wage employment in service sectors, and showed that, on average, the rural areas with high level of
natural amenities and recreation opportunities experienced higher income growth and more economic
opportunities than their low-amenity counterparts, although the economic gains are somewhat offset by
higher local cost of living (Reeder and Brown 2005, Hunter et al 2007). Thus ecological restoration is a
sound economic development strategy because it improves the quality of natural environment and
provides increased and more diverse employment opportunities generated by restoration treatments and
potential woody biomass utilization.
Conclusions and Policy Implications
Traditionally, jobs based on logging, mining or other market-oriented, extractive uses of natural resources
resulted in boom-and-bust cycles attributed to short-sighted management policies (Douglas and
Harpman 1995). This study shows that restorative mechanical thinning treatments make economic and
ecological sense because they promote economic development in local economies and potential for woody
biomass utilization, while reducing wildfire risk and restoring ecosystem health.

Ecological restoration represents an attempt to learn from our past mistakes and to reestablish the
ecological integrity of ecosystem. However, our past forest management history warrants persistent public
skepticism about any type of forest management that involves activities done for profit. If advocates of
ecological restoration are to convince their critics and gain broader support, they should also learn from
our past mistakes in natural resource planning. Management of ecosystems to achieve efficiency (e.g.,
production-oriented silviculture, fire suppression) tends to focus on control, constancy and predictability,
which often ends up with counterproductive results (e.g., lost resilience) (Holling and Gunderson 2002).
As in ecological systems, human organizations that are preoccupied with short-term gain and seek a series
of easy, “quick-fix” solutions tend to fail, while those who can learn and adapt tothe external changes
survive and proliferate in the long term (Makridakis 1991). With the lessons learned from previous forest
management experiences in mind, planning for ecological restoration should focus on preserving the
resilience and adaptability of social and economic systems, as well as those of ecological system. Adaptive
management founded on aggressive social learning should include qualitative and quantitative monitoring
of social and economic conditions, in addition to ecological outcomes of the treatments. This study
provides baseline information for such future monitoring efforts.
The focus of planning should be on preparing local communities for inevitable changes, rather than
maintaining consistency. With adaptive planning, land managers can avoid the past planning models that
have been equated to “driving a car while looking into the rearview mirror” (Powers 1994) and can create
truly sustainable, “green collar” jobs to people who need them most in the places where economic stimulus
spending can make the most significant differences.

Appendix I. Economic Impacts of the Planned and Proposed Treatments by National Forest (continued)

Ecological restoration is a practice that seeks to heal degraded ecosystems by reestablishing native
species, structural characteristics, and ecological processes. The Society for Ecological Restoration
International defines ecological restoration as “an intentional activity that initiates or accelerates the
recovery of an ecosystem with respect to its health, integrity and sustainability...Restoration attempts
to return an ecosystem to its historic trajectory” (Society for Ecological Restoration International
Science & Policy Working Group 2004).
In the western United States, most dry, frequent-fire forests have been degraded during the last 150
years. Many of these forests are now dominated by dense thickets of small trees, and lack their once
diverse understory of grasses, sedges, and forbs. Forests in this condition are highly susceptible to
damaging, stand-replacing fires and increased insect and disease epidemics. Restoration of these
forests centers on reintroducing frequent, low-intensity surface fires––often after thinning dense
stands––and reestablishing productive understory plant communities.
The Ecological Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona University is a pioneer in researching,
implementing, and monitoring ecological restoration projects in dry, frequent-fire western forests.
By allowing natural processes, such as fire, to resume self-sustaining patterns, we hope to reestablish
healthy forests that provide ecosystem services, wildlife habitat, and recreational opportunities.
The ERI White Papers series provides overviews and policy recommendations derived from research
and observations by the ERI and its partner organizations. While the ERI staff recognizes that every
forest restoration is site specific, we feel that the information provided in the ERI White Papers may
help decision makers elsewhere.
