Abstract 
 
Emerging biomass conversion technologies, such as small scale mobile biochar or pyrolysis/torrefaction 
machines, aim to use forest residues left after extracting merchantable timber from timber harvest or fuel 
reduction thinning operations. The residues generated from these operations typically produce low quality 
feedstock which may not be suitable for new biomass conversion technologies. In an effort to increase 
feedstock quality, our study separated sub-merchantable trees and tops from piled limbs during the timber 
harvest. A portion of the separated material was further processed to remove limbs to create five material 
types: processed and unprocessed, conifer and hardwood stem wood, and slash (stems, limbs and chunks). 
These materials were comminuted with a disc-chipper or a grinder. The quality of the feedstock produced 
was characterized by moisture content, particle-size distribution, bulk density, and ash content. Moisture 
content of sample collected ranged from 19 to 29%. The mean geometric lengths for unprocessed hardwood, 
unprocessed conifer, processed hardwood, processed conifer, and slash were 20.60, 18.27, 18.16, 17.41, and 
47.47 mm, respectively. The bulk density of the five material types ranged from 137.20 – 322 kg/m3. The least 
amount of ash were observed in processed conifer samples (0.27%) and greatest in ground slash (1.5%). The 
results showed that a high quality feedstock can be produced by separating stem wood from other residues 
during a harvest.

1. Introduction 
 
Nationwide, 89 million bone dry metric tons (BDmT) of woody biomass in the form of residues 
from timber harvest and fuel reduction treatment operations are produced annually (Perlack et al., 
2011). Despite the abundance, forest residues remain underutilized due to economic and 
operational barriers related to the cost of collecting, processing, and transporting a product with 
low market value (Han et al., 2010). The cost of transportation, which ranges from US$0.11 to 

Joel Bisson and Han-Sup Han/ American Journal of Biomass and Bioenergy  
(2016) Vol. 5 No. 2 pp. 81-97 
 
82 
US$0.32 per tonne per km, remains to be the greatest challenge as it severely limits the range in 
which residues can be collected (Perlack et al., 2005). 
 
A potential solution to increase transportation efficiency is to reduce moisture content and densify 
the biomass close to its source. This can be achieved by using different biomass conversion 
technologies (BCT), such as pyrolysis, e.g., torrefaction and biochar, or physical densification, e.g., 
briquetting (Van der Stelt, 2011; Picchio et al., 2012). Providing a quality feedstock for these BCTs 
can be problematic, as they each have their own specific requirements for particle size, moisture 
content, and ash content. Meeting these requirements can be difficult when considering the 
utilization of forest residues.  
 
Typically, forest residues are comminuted, or reduced in size, using grinders. The output, 
commonly called “hog fuel”, is highly variable is size, low in bulk density, and is often contaminated 
with rock and soil (Han et al., 2015). For these reasons, hog fuel may not be a preferable feedstock 
for BCTs. Another option is to comminute with a chipper. This machine utilizes knives to slice 
through woody material creating chips that are relatively uniform in size. They are very effective 
when chipping whole trees and stems, but lack when fed loose materials such as limbs and chunks. 
Furthermore, the knives are susceptible to wear and damage from soil and rock contamination 
requiring relatively clean material. Despite these limitations, the chipper’s ability to control particle 
size makes it more preferable when considering feedstock requirements of a BCT. 
 
To facilitate the use of chippers, whole stems and tops would need to be separated out from other 
residues during a timber harvest operation. The extra handling would provide a preferred 
feedstock with less contamination, but would come at a cost (Kizha and Han, 2015). Therefore, 
understanding the amount of feedstock quality improvement through sorting and processing is 
warranted. 
 
Particle size is one of the greatest considerations when evaluating feedstock quality for BCTs. 
Particle size can influence fuel conveyance and the efficiency of machines by having an effect on 
drying and reaction time (Picchio et al., 2012). Research suggests that there are many factors that 
influence the size of particles generated from chipping. Of them, material type (i.e. tree part and 
species) and moisture content have shown to have significant effects. Spinelli et al. (2005) found 
that delimbing stems produced the highest-quality chip (i.e., the largest proportion of acceptably 
sized chips) when compared to chips generated from whole trees with limbs. Similar results were 
found by Nati et al. (2011) who experimented with chipping different tree parts, specifically logs 
and branches. Furthermore, they found that species also had an effect on size distribution. Poplar 
chips tended to be larger than pine chips and contained a higher proportion of oversized particles. 
Spinelli et al. (2011) produced more uniform chips with fewer oversized particles when chipping 
larger sized stem wood (e.g., small-diameter trees or tops from sawlog processing) compared to 
smaller-diameter materials (e.g., branches) which tended to produce more oversized (i.e. > 50 mm) 
particles. They went further to note that moisture content also had a strong effect on the resulting 
particle size distribution of chips. Fresh branches produced the lowest proportion of acceptable 
chips.  
 
Moisture content not only effects particle size distribution, but also BCT efficiency. The moisture 
content of freshly felled trees can range from 30% to more than 200% (Ross, 2010). At these levels,

thermochemical conversion efficiency is decreased, as moisture must first be evaporated resulting 
in higher processing costs (Acharjee et al., 2011). Management strategies to reduce moisture 
content of residues, such as harvest timing, air drying, and transpiration drying have proven to be 
effective methods (Rogers, 1981; Stokes et al., 1993; Brand et al., 2011). Moreover, the practice of 
bark removal has also shown decreases in moisture content of residues (Nurmi and Hillebrand, 
2007; Röser et al., 2011). Nurmi and Lehtimaki (2011) further investigated the amount of moisture 
reduction in Pinus sylvestris and Betula pubescens after partial bark removal from processing. 
They found that partial debarking only resulted in a marginal reduction. 
 
Ash content is another characteristic to consider when providing feedstocks for BCTs. The presence 
of ash in feedstock reduces thermochemical conversion efficiencies in processes, such as 
gasification and pyrolysis (Lacey et al., 2015). Research on methods to reduce ash content in 
feedstocks have suggested better material handling techniques to minimize contamination (i.e., soil 
and sand) and mechanical screening to sort out smaller fractions in “hog fuel” which are typically 
heavier in contamination (Dukes et al., 2013; Greene et al., 2014). In addition to contamination, 
bark has been found to be a contributor to ash content (Lehtikangas, 2001; Flibakk et al., 2001; 
Picchio et al., 2012). 
 
Bulk density, although a less consequential feedstock characteristic, can still influence 
transportation efficiencies when providing a feedstock to BCTs. Low bulk density can result in the 
underutilization of transport equipment and an increase in hauling cost (Hakkila, 1989). It is 
affected by moisture content and comminution method. Chips differ from “hog fuel” in that they are 
more uniform in terms of particle-size distribution and usually have higher bulk densities 
(Mozammel et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2012). This supports the idea of sorting to facilitate chipping. 
However, the difference in bulk density of chips generated from whole-trees with limbs compared 
to chips from stems with no limbs is not well understood. 
 
The aim of this study was to determine the improvement in feedstock quality as a result of sorting 
forest residues. We used a controlled experimental design to evaluate particle size distribution, 
moisture content, ash content, and bulk density of five material types produced from forest 
residues during a timber harvest. We hypothesized that sorting out stem wood from other forest 
residues would facilitate a chipping operation and provide a higher quality product compared to 
grindings. In addition, we hypothesized that further processing (delimbing) the sorted stem wood 
would have an effect on moisture content, bulk density, and ash content of the feedstock generated. 
The results from this work will provide land managers strategies to increase feedstock quality 
when comminuting forest residues. 
 
2. Methods 
 
2.1. Field Operations 
 
2.1.1. 
Preparing Material for Chipping and Grinding Experiment 
 
The forest residues used in this study were produced and collected from three experimental study 
units located on commercial timberlands owned by Green Diamond Resource Company in northern 
California. The harvested units were characterized as second growth mixed conifer forest,

comprised of Sequoia sempervirens, Pseudo-tsuga menzesii, Tsuga heterophylia, Notholithcarpus 
densiflorus, and Chrysolepis chrysophylla. The terrain was uneven with ground slopes up to 48%.  
 
Three subunits (2.43 - 3.64 hectares) were selected from three replicate even-aged timber harvest 
units (7.69 – 8.50 hectares). Within each subunit, sawlog trees (> 20.3 cm diameter at breast height 
(DBH)) and small-diameter, non-merchantable biomass trees (< 20.3 cm DBH) were cut and piled 
with a feller-buncher (John Deere 959K with a Quadco disc saw head) and shovel logged to the 
roadside using a Cat 568 with a standard log grapple. A dangle-head processor (John Deere 2454D 
with a Waratah 623 harvester head) processed (i.e., delimbed) and sorted sawlog and hardwood 
trees (> 25.4 cm DBH) in preparation for transportation to the mill or energy plant, respectively. In 
addition, the operator also separated out small-diameter conifer and hardwood trees and further 
processed a portion of these stems to produce processed conifer (PC), processed hardwood (PH), 
unprocessed conifer (UC), unprocessed hardwood (UH), and slash. Long stems were cut into 7.6 to 
9.1 m sections to facilitate transportation to a centralized chipping/grinding site. The slash pile 
consisted of stem wood, limbs, bark, and chunks, i.e., off-cuts from processing sawlogs and energy 
wood.  
 
Prior to chipping, each material type (PC, PH, UC, UH) was characterized by size, volume, and bark 
and foliage coverage. The length and diameters of the small- and large-end tops were measured to 
estimate volume. Stems that ended in a natural tip were assumed to have a 2.54 cm small-end 
diameter. The amount of bark covering each sampled piece was ocularly estimated by a single 
observer and recorded as a percentage. Species and the presence of attached foliage (needles or 
leaves) were also noted. Each slash pile was observed and a visual estimate of the percentage of 
limbs, chunks, and bark were recorded. 
 
2.1.2. 
Chipping and Grinding of Sorted Forest Residues 
 
Material sorted and piled during the timber harvest operation was later collected with a loader and 
placed into modified dump trucks for transport to the chipping and grinding location. One material 
type was chipped or ground at a time until a 12-m chip trailer was filled. This was done for all five 
material types and then replicated with material from the two other study units (Table 1).

2 Slash was a mixture of conifer and hardwood stems, limbs, and chunks left from processing 
sawlogs, energy wood. 
 
The processed and unprocessed conifer and hardwood material was chipped using a 632.5 kW 
Mobark 76 cm disc chipper. The chipper was equipped with four sets of key knife disposable blades 
set to produce 19.05 mm chips. In an effort to control confounding variables, all machine 
configurations and operating speeds remained constant during the entire chipping operation. To 
eliminate knife wear as a variable, knives were changed every replicate subunit or approximately 
every 90 BDmT production of wood chips. 
 
Slash material was comminuted using a Peterson Pacific 772.3 kW 5710C horizontal grinder. The 
grinding rotor was equipped with 11 knife bits in the center and seven carbide hammer bits on the 
outer edge. The grinder was also equipped with a pair each of 7.62 and 10.16 cm screen plates to 
help control output size. 
 
Collecting representative samples of output material from the two different machines was done 
using a systematic method to avoid bias. A collection tube made from 15.24 mm, 90 degree elbow 
attached to a 15.24 mm by 3.05 m PVC pipe was held in front of the chipper’s discharge spout to 
redirect a portion of the chips down to a 19 L collection bucket (Mitchell and Gallagher, 2007). A 
sample was collected approximately every two minutes for the length of time it took to fill the 
collection bucket. The contents of a bucket were placed into a plastic garbage bag and marked with 
a sample identification number. A 1.9 L subsample was taken from each bag before being sealed. 
This subsample was immediately weighed with a portable balance, marked with the corresponding 
sample identification number, and placed in a cooler. The samples and subsamples collected were 
transported to the lab for analysis. 
 
2.2. 
Laboratory Analyses 
 
2.2.1. 
Determining Moisture Content of Samples 
 
The wet basis moisture content of samples collected during the chipping and grinding operation 
were determined using ASTM E871-82 standard test methods deigned for green tree chips and hog 
fuel (ASTM, 2006). For this study, all samples were placed in paper bags and dried at 103°C for 48 
hours to streamline analysis. 
 
2.2.2. 
Subsampling 
 
During the experiment, 156 samples were collected from the chipping and grinding operation 
(Table 1). These sample, were further separated into smaller subsamples to conduct particle size, 
bulk density, and ash content analysis. The separation process involved dumping the collected 
sample into a 19 L bucket, which was inverted over a large clean surface. The bucket was lifted 
vertically to allow the content to spill out forming a cone. A 30.5 x 61 cm piece of sheet metal was 
used to systematically divide the pile into halves, quarters, and eighths for subsampling.  
 
2.2.3. 
Evaluating Particle Size Distribution 
 
Methods to evaluate particle size distribution for each sample were done using ANSI/ASAE S424.1

(2016) Vol. 5 No. 2 pp. 81-97 
 
86 
standard (ANSI, 1992). A subsample of approximately 2.5 L was poured onto a stack of six, 30.5 cm 
diameter sieves and a bottom pan. The sieve stack and sample were shaken with a sieve shaker for 
two minutes. The shaking motion fractioned the samples into seven size classes (Table 2). The 
contents of each sieve were removed, oven-dried for 48 hours, and weighed to calculate the mean 
geometric length and standard deviation for each sample. The 15 hog fuel samples required manual 
rescreening in order to address the issue of long, narrow particles diving down through screens.

2.2.4. 
Measuring Bulk Density of Samples 
 
The bulk density of wood chip and hog fuel samples were determined using a modified version of 
ISO 15103 (Cen/TS, 2006). A plastic bucket with a volume of 21.55 L, a height-to-diameter ratio of 
1.26, and a taper of 9.7 cm/m was used instead of the suggested 50 or 10 L vessel. Material from 
two random samples of the same material type and replicate (e.g., two processed conifer chip 
samples both from Unit 1) were thoroughly mixed together and used to get a set of bulk density 
measurements. The average of the two samples and their moisture contents were used to calculate 
bulk density at their current moisture content.  
 
2.2.5. 
Evaluate Ash Content of Samples 
 
The procedure used to evaluate ash content was consistent with protocol established by the 
National Renewable Energy Lab (Sluiter, 2008). A 1.9 L subsample further processed with a 16.4 
cm3 laboratory Wiley mill running at 800 rpm with a 2 mm screen. Approximately 6.5 g of finely 
milled material was randomly scooped into a ceramic crucible and oven dried for 48 hr at 103°C. 
The standard method was modified by igniting the sample by placing the crucible and sample above 
a Bunsen burner in a vented laboratory hood. The sample was heated until spontaneous 
combustion and then allowed to burn above the burner until there was no visible flame. Desiccant 
chambers were used to control moisture absorption after oven drying and ashing in the muffle 
furnace. The standard procedure was followed for the muffle furnace without a ramping program. 
Three samples were prepared and analyzed for each sample of wood chips and hog fuel.  
 
2.2.6. 
Statistical Analysis 
 
The data collected from the different analyses were statistically tested using R Statistics (R Core 
Team, 2013). ANOVA was used to check the statistical significance of the eventual differences 
between treatments. Alpha was set at 0.05. Residual plots were examined to ensure test

87 
assumptions were not violated. Shapiro-Wilk tests were used to confirm normality and post-hoc 
tests were conducted using Tukey HSD test method. 
 
3. Results and Discussion 
 
3.1. 
Characteristics of Forest Residues Produced for the Study 
 
A characterization of the material used in the study prior to chipping provided information about 
the size and volume of material fed into the chipper and grinder. The average volume for 
unprocessed and processed stems were 0.08 and 0.15 m3, respectively (Table 3). The average 
percent bark cover across all species for unprocessed and processed stems were 92.8 and 66.7%, 
respectively (Table 4). An average pile of slash was estimated to have 82, 12, and 6 % of limbs, 
stems and chunks, and bark, respectively.

1 Species was not available (NA) in that particular unit. 
 
We determined that there was not enough hardwood material in Unit 1 to conduct our experiment 
prior to timber harvest operations. Therefore, processed and unprocessed hardwood material was 
excluded from the experiment reducing sample sizes for those material types. 
 
The average piece size of processed material was found to be greater in volume compared to 
unprocessed. This is because unprocessed conifer and hardwoods were exclusively tops from 
processing, whereas processed material was made from either stem wood of non-merchantable

trees, or the stem portion of the tree cut before the top (Figure 1). The difference in material size 
may have had an effect on the size of particles produced after chipping. The difference in material 
size certainly increased the volume per load which may be important when considering transport 
from the landing to a centralized processing location. 
 
The 26% difference in bark coverage between processed and unprocessed material was a direct 
result of processing. The top and bottom knives used to delimb and the forces from the 3 feed 
rollers on the processing head caused bark to sluff off. This may be significant, if we consider its 
contribution to fine particles as it breaks up during chipping or the amount of ash in samples, as 
bark is higher in ash content compared to wood (Lehtikangas, 2001; Filbakk et al., 2011; Picchio et 
al., 20012).

unprocessed materials in this study. 
 
3.2. 
Moisture Content of Feedstock 
 
A total of 156, 19 L samples were collected from the chipping and grinding operation (Table 1). The 
average moisture content of the sampled chips and hog fuel collected from the five different 
material types ranged from 19 to 29% (Table 5). A one-way ANOVA was conducted to compare 
mean moisture content between material types. The means were found to be statistically different 
at the p<.05 level between material types [F(4,151) = 8.585, p = 2.862e-6]. Post hoc multiple 
comparison using Tukey HSD test indicated that slash (i.e., ground hog fuel) was the only material 
type that was significantly different in mean moisture content compared to other material types (p 
< .05). 
  
A noticeable reduction in moisture content of the four material types was observed during the two 
month period between harvest and chipping. However, after chipping there was no statistical 
difference in means. This implies that partially removing bark may not have an effect on moisture 
content. This is consistent with results by Nurmi and Lehtimaki (2011). Further research will be 
needed to determine if bark loss has an effect on moisture content over a longer period of time.

Particle Size Distribution 
 
The mean geometric length of particles sampled from the four chipped material types (PC, PH, UC, 
and UH) were 17.41, 18.27, 18.16, and 20.60 mm, respectively (Figure 2). There was a statistically 
significant difference between geometric means of the different material types determined by one-
way ANOVA F(3,132) = 7.041, p = 0.0002. A multiple comparison determined that UH was the only 
material type significantly different from the others (p-value < 0.05).

(PC), processed hardwood (PH), unprocessed conifer (UC), unprocessed hardwood (UH). 
The mean geometric length varied between the different material types.  
 
We noticed a number of outliers in the all four materials types (Figure 2). Further investigation 
revealed that these outliers were long, conifer and hardwood, branch segments typically found in

our unprocessed material samples or dense branch collars in the processed material samples. For 
this reason these observations were not screened from the data. This was consistent with 
observations made during the sample collection. The collection tube would occasionally get clogged 
with long, branch segments leading us to believe that the chipper tended to pull flexible branches 
through without actually cutting it into small pieces.

The cumulative size distribution by percent mass of wood chips passing through screening sieves 
can be seen in Figure 3. The size distribution of wood chip particles revealed some interesting 
findings. Unprocessed hardwood and conifer chips were significantly different from processed 
chips. On average, we found a 6% increase in the amount of processed material chips passing

through the 25.4 mm sieve compared to the unprocessed material. The 19.1 – 25.4 mm size class, 
which was the target size range set by the chipper, had approximately the same percentages for all 
material types. There was more noticeable variation in the smaller and especially the larger size 
particles within the distribution. Based on the data, we can recommend processed when oversized 
(> 25.4 mm) are undesirable and unprocessed hardwood if smaller particles (< 6.35 mm) are not 
wanted.

Fig. 4. Size distribution of hog fuel samples collected from grinding slash material (i.e., stems, limbs 
and chunks left after processing sawlogs). The percentage of total dry weight retained on 
25.4, 50.8, 76.2, and 101.6 mm sieves and a bottom pan. Samples were further separated 
manually to achieve an accurate distribution analysis. 
 
The influence the different variables had on particle size distribution can be seen in Table 6. Smaller 
size classes (< 6.35 to 19.05 mm) were mainly influenced by species, whereas the larger size classes 
(25.4 - >50.8 mm) were influenced by treatment.  
 
During the analysis, we observed a difference in moisture content between samples of different size 
classes, i.e., chips greater than 50.8 mm had a higher moisture content compared to chips less than 
6.35 mm. We were concerned that these differences would influence mass used to make 
comparisons between size classes. To minimize this effect, fractions created during the shaking 
process were bagged and dried in an oven for 48 hr and then re-weighed. 
 
The mean geometric length of the ground slash material (limbs and chunks) from processing was 
47.47 mm. The particle size distribution of the 15 hog fuel samples showed that a majority (55%) of 
the particles were > 25.4 mm (Figure 4).

It should be noted that manual sorting, in addition to the mechanical separation done by the shaker 
and sieves was done to obtain fractions represented by their maximum length. This was because 
long, “spear-like” particles would tend to dive down the sieve stack and rest on a sieve measuring 
its second longest dimension. 
 
3.4. 
Bulk Density 
 
The bulk density of the five material types ranged from 137.20 – 322.17 kg/m3 (Table 7). There is a 
statistically significant difference between material types determined by one-way ANOVA F(4,148) 
= 530.5, p = <0.0001. A post hoc multiple comparison test determined that all were statistically 
different from each other except processed and unprocessed hardwood.

We hypothesized that unprocessed materials would have greater proportions of larger sized 
particles resulting in significantly different bulk densities compared to processed material. We 
found that there was no significant difference between the bulk density of PH and UH; t(48)=-0.18, 
p=0.86. There was however, a significant difference between PC and UC; t(71)=-6.54, p < 0.0001. 
Interestingly, the mean bulk density of the unprocessed conifer was greater than processed, which 
is contrary to what we expected. The most reasonable explanation for this was a 19 day time lag 
between PC and UC analysis. Even though samples were sealed in a plastic bag, there may have 
been some moisture loss. Our suggestion for future research is to quickly analyze all samples when 
using this method. The other, less practical solution is to oven dry all samples before analysis.

Ash content for the five different material types ranged from 0.24 and 1.50% of the oven-dry 
sample weight (Table 8). There was a significant difference between all material types except for 
processed and unprocessed hardwoods as determine by a one-way ANOVA F(4,198) = 51.88, p = < 
0.001. 
 
The results from the ash content analysis were within reported ranges of 0.4 and 0.8 wt% (dry 
basis) and 1.0 and 1.3 wt% (dry basis) for softwoods and hardwoods, respectively (Obernberger 
and Thek, 2004). The highest ash content results were from the slash samples. Visually, these 
samples looked “dirty” by containing soil and leaves. There was a 58% reduction in ash content 
between PC and UC which might be a result of bark removal during processing. However, this 
reduction was not observed between the PH and UH samples. Other factors such as bark thickness, 
bark adhesion, or difference in inorganic materials within the bark of the different species may 
have influenced our results. More investigation is needed to determine what specifically influenced 
ash content. 
 
3.6. 
Feedstock Quality and Implications for Management 
 
In a typical timber harvest operation, biomass in the form of unmerchantable trees, tops, branches, 
and chunks from processing sawlogs, are piled together. This forces contractors to comminute with 
machines such as grinders which can handle mixed residues. A study looking at grinding mixed 
conifer slash and hardwood whole trees found the percentage of particles < 2.54 cm was only 45 
and 33%, respectively (Han et al., 2015). Another study that ground branches and tops, and 
pulpwood using knife-edge bits and a small screen size configuration found that 91.8 of the 
particles were < 7.61 cm in length (Zamora-Cristales et al., 2015). In both studies a majority of the 
comminuted material was too large for current BCT operation. The results of this study showed 
how separating biomass stems from other residues during a timber harvest or fuel reduction 
operation can facilitate the use of a chipper instead of a grinder, which can greatly improve the 
ability to produce quality feedstock that meets the specifications for BCTs.  
 
Sorting residues was also influential on the amount of ash contained in samples. Our findings 
showed that slash material had a significantly higher ash content compared with the other material 
types. Dukes et al. (2013) analyzed the ash content of two residue types: larger residues from 
delimbing with a pull-through delimber and branches, and bark removed from a chain flail 
machine. They found a 4 and 11.9% ash content for the two material types, respectively. This 
further suggests that sorting out stem wood from branches is an important tool in improving 
feedstock quality. And even though moisture content nor bulk density were influenced by the 
additional step of processing biomass stems when sorting, the results of this study showed that it 
has the potential to further reduce ash content. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
Processed and unprocessed, conifer and hardwood tops were chipped and slash (stems, limbs and 
chunks) generated from processing sawlogs were ground in a study to evaluate their differences in 
moisture content, particle size distribution, bulk density, and ash content. The moisture content 
ranged from 19 – 29% with evidence that slash was significantly drier than other material types. 
Bark removal from processing or delimbing stems did not have an effect on moisture content

within a two month period. The use of a chipper increased the ability to control particle size 
compared to material comminuted in similar studies with a grinder. We found that additional 
processing prior to comminution decreased the amount of material greater than one inch in length 
by an average of 6%. The results of the particle-size distribution analysis suggest that processing 
stems is recommended to control the amount of particles greater than 25.4 mm. Furthermore, 
species selection can control the amount of particles less than 19.05 mm in length. The bulk density 
of the hardwood was significantly greater than conifer with no difference between processed and 
unprocessed hardwood. The ash content was found to be greatest in the ground slash material and 
the least in the processed conifer. A 58% reduction was noticed between processed and 
unprocessed conifer which may be due to the reduction in bark during processing.  
 
Our findings have shown that sorting and processing forest residues during a timber harvest can 
facilitate the use a chipper and provide a high quality feedstock for biomass conversion 
technologies. The results also illustrate the potential feedstock that can be derived from processed 
and unprocessed conifer and hardwood stems of the Pacific Northwest.
