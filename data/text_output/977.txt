Abstract
Dense, small-diameter stands generally require thinning from below to improve fire-tolerance. The resulting forest biomass
can be used for energy production. The cost of harvesting, processing, and transporting small-diameter trees often exceeds
revenues due to high costs associated with harvesting and transportation and low market values for forest biomass. Productivity
and cost were evaluated in a whole-tree harvesting system on four fuel-reduction thinning treatment units in Arizona. Thinning
required removal of trees less than 5.0 inches in diameter at breast height (DBH). Time studies were applied to evaluate the
harvesting productivities and costs. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the effects of different variables on costs. Simu-
lations along with break-even analysis were used to examine the economic feasibility of using forest biomass for energy. Harvest
productivity for each machine in the system ranged from 2.31 to 39.32 bone dry tons per productive machine hour (BDT/PMH).
Harvest system costs including transportation for 36 miles or less averaged $55.27 per bone dry ton. Hauling cost represented the
largest component (47.24%) of the total cost. Close to market operations, reduced off-highway hauling, shortened skidding
distance, increased harvest tree size, and improvement in system balance could significantly reduce cost. Below the market value
of $40 per bone dry ton for hog fuel, breaking even or realizing profit would remain difficult. Other values, such as reducing fire
risks, preventing smoke pollutions, and creating renewable energy sources, should increase the attractiveness of harvesting forest
biomass for energy.
Dense, small-diameter stands of timber have been
viewed as a major issue associated with wildland forest fires
in the interior western United States (USDA Forest Serv.
2001). In the last decade forest fires have increased in Arizona
and New Mexico (Moir et al. 1997). The worst forest fire in
Arizona to date, the Rodeo-Chediski fire in 2002, consumed
467,066 acres of forestland.
Dense, small-diameter stands generally require thinning
from below to improve fire-tolerance (Graham et al. 2002,
Healthy Forests 2002). The amount of woody biomass result-
ing from increased thinning activities could be substantial. To
ensure a thinning operation reduces fire risk for the residual
stand, the operation must either remove submerchantable
trees and logging slash completely through whole tree re-
moval or carefully burn the fuels using a prescribed fire (Han
et al. 2002). Due to the heavy emissions of smoke and air
pollutants from open burning of biomass residues, prescribed
burning is increasingly limited as a tool for fuel reduction
(Morris 1999, Bolding 2002). Energy generation creates an
opportunity to use forest biomass that is generated from me-
chanical fuel reduction treatments (Morris 1999, Sampson et

al. 2001). In addition, biomass removal saves costs associated
with open-burning of logging slash.
Use of forest biomass will become commonplace only
when it becomes economically advantageous for users (GAO
2005). Harvesting, processing, and transporting forest bio-
mass stems of nonmerchantable size are expensive when us-
ing conventional harvesting systems, due to decreased pro-
duction (Han et al. 2002). Finding methods that will lower the
production cost has become a critical issue in the economic
feasibility of using forest biomass for energy. Many studies
reported harvesting productivities and costs in fuels-reduc-
tion treatments that remove trees larger than 5 inches in diam-
eter at breast height (DBH). Halbrook and Han (2005) studied
an integrated harvesting system that processed the tree limbs
and tops resulting from a sawlog production into hog fuel.
They reported the biomass harvesting and transportation cost
of $24.37 per green ton for harvesting trees averaging
10.5 inches in DBH. However, the literature lacks information
about the productivity and cost of harvesting trees less than
5 inches in DBH. To improve our knowledge of cost-
reduction methods when harvesting small-diameter trees for
energy, this study investigated the production and cost of har-
vesting, processing, and transporting small-diameter ponder-
osa pine trees less than or equal to 5.0 inches in DBH for
energy.
Methodology
Study site and harvesting system
The study sites were located in Springerville and
Black Mesa, Arizona. The two sites were stocked with nearly
100 percent ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) trees. The
ground slope of the sites ranged from 0 percent to 28 percent.
Each site was laid out by global positioning system (GPS)
instruments, forming two 10-acre subunits. Thirty systematic
sampling plots were established throughout each unit to col-
lect pre- and postharvest stand inventory data. The silvicul-
tural prescription required removal of all trees less than or
equal to 5.0 inches in DBH.
A mechanized whole-tree system was used to harvest the
trees. It included a three-wheel hot-saw feller-buncher (Val-
met 603) that felled and bunched trees prior to skidding them
with a rubber-tired grapple skidder (CAT 525B). Each unit
had one main skid trail cut by the feller-buncher. The skidder
would choose random skid trails from the main skid trail to
bunched trees. The main skid trail distance ranged from
700 feet to 1,400 feet, with an average of 1,025 feet. A log
loader (Prentice RT-100) was used at the landing to feed the
whole trees into a remote-controlled horizontal grinder (Ban-
dit Beast 3680). The resulting processed hog fuel was loaded
into a chip van (walking floor) directly through the grinder’s
conveyor. Chip vans that could be hooked or disconnected
from the truck were used for landing-to-market hauling. The
hog fuel was sent to the Western Renewable Energy Co. in
Eagar for site 1 and to the RENEGY LLC. in Snowflake for
site 2. The one-way transportation distance ranged from
29.5 to 36 miles.
Data collection and analysis
A preharvest cruise used thirty 0.02-acre systematic, circu-
lar sampling plots in each harvesting unit to estimate unit av-
erage DBH, tree height, and stand density (stems/acre). To
allow collection of postharvest stand inventory data, plot cen-
ters were staked, numbered, and flagged; plot edges were
painted, and two out-of-plot reference trees were flagged with
angle and distance to the plot center. After harvesting, the
same inventory measurements were recorded again.
Hourly machine costs measured in dollars per scheduled
machine hour ($/SMH) were estimated using a standard ma-
chine rate calculation method introduced by Miyata (1980;
Table 1). Initial machine prices, insurance, taxes, interest, lu-
brication cost, tire and chain cost, and repair and maintenance
cost were obtained from the project contractor. Diesel con-
sumption and utilization rate for each machine were calcu-
lated from actual 9-day operations. Diesel prices were deter-
mined from local market prices in effect during the study. Es-
timated economic life for all the machines was set at 5 years
with an assumption of 2,000 scheduled machine hours per
year. Salvage value was set at 20 percent of the initial price.
Overhead and profit allowance were not included in the
hourly machine cost.
Regression equations were developed for machine cycle
time to allow determination of a machine production rate
(bone dry tons per productive machine hour, or BDT/PMH).
A feller-buncher cycle started with a move to the tree, fol-
lowed by multiple cuttings, and ended with the placement of
the bunch on the ground. A skidder cycle consisted of travel-
ing empty from the landing, positioning, grappling, traveling
loaded to the landing, and unloading in sequence. A log loader
cycle began when grappling the trees from the landing piles,
then swinging to the grinder, in-feeding, and ended when
swinging back to the pile. The grinder worked continuously
until a chip van was fully loaded, the time for loading a chip
van was used as a grinder cycle. A hauling cycle started with
the loading of the chip van, followed by traveling loaded to the
energy plant, unloading, and traveling back empty to the land-
ing. All the variables at each harvesting phase were identified
prior to the start of operations.
Multiple regressions using ordinary least squares estima-
tors were performed in SAS 9.0 program (SAS 1999) to de-
velop these predictive equations. Normality plot, residual
plot, White test, Durbin-Watson test, variance inflation factor,
and condition index were used to detect whether the Gauss-
Markov assumptions were violated. Generalized least squares
estimators were used given the existence of heteroscedasticity
or autocorrelation. Restricted least squares estimators were
used if multicollinearity was determined to be severe. To vali-
date the developed regression equations, 33 percent of ob-
served data were randomly reserved and all the models devel-
oped from 67 percent of the observed data were used to pre-
dict the reserved data. A two-sample t-test ( = 0.05) was used
to evaluate the predictive regression equations developed.

Average observed values for independent variables provided
by the time study were used in the regression models to pre-
dict the cycle times. In addition, a signed rank test was per-
formed to test the highway and unpaved road transportation
speed difference between travel-loaded and travel-empty.
This comparison was not performed for the travel speed dif-
ference on spur road as the sample size was too small (n = 2).
The cycle biomass green weight for grinding and hauling
were tracked from the energy plant scaling tickets. An average
moisture content (MC) of 52.75 percent found in an accom-
panying net energy study (Pan et al. 2008a) was applied to
convert the biomass green weight to ovendry weight. The av-
erage ponderosa pine tree dry weight for the felling, skidding,
and loading cycles was calculated using the formula (Jenkins
et al. 2003)
BW = 2.2046 · Exp−0.4198 + 2.4349 · ln DBH
[1]
where:
BW = total aboveground biomass dry weight, pounds,
DBH = tree diameter at breast height, inches,
−0.4198 and 2.4349 are parameters for general pine trees.
Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the ef-
fects of different variables in the developed regression models
while keeping all the other variables constant. The resulting
value change in cycle time was then converted to a production
cost change. Scatter plots showed how the production cost
changed with the corresponding value changes in the tested
variables, which included one-way spur road distance, un-
paved road distance, highway distance, and skidding distance.
Simulations were also performed to test the effect of DBH on
production cost by excluding the cycles with inappropriate
DBH. To examine the economic feasibility of using forest
biomass for energy, various scenarios with different site fac-
tors were simulated along with a break-even analysis.
Results
Thinning effects and biomass quantities
Due to the removal of most small-diameter trees (DBH 
5.0 inches), stand characteristics changed dramatically with a
decrease in stand density and increases in both average DBH
and tree height (Table 2). In unit 1, 86 percent of the small
trees were removed. This percentage for units 2, 3, and 4 was
95 percent, 98 percent, and 97 percent, respectively. The
lower small tree removal rate in unit 1 was caused by the scat-
tered distribution of the larger trees (DBH > 5.0 inches). Dif-
ficulties in maneuvering between trees caused the feller-
buncher to occasionally forgo cutting target trees to avoid
damaging leave trees. Some larger trees (DBH 5.1 to
7.0 inches) were removed during the operations. Errors in vi-
sual estimates might lead the operator to cut trees slightly
larger than 5.0 inches in DBH as leave trees were not marked.
Sometimes a large tree was cut when it stood in the way and
the operator could not identify a better route.
During the 9-day operation, 336.11 bone dry tons of forest
biomass were removed. From unit 1 to unit 4, removed bio-
mass quantities were 57.31 BDT, 45.54 BDT, 171.54 BDT,
and 61.72 BDT, respectively. The average fuel loading across
the four units before treatment was 8.40 BDT/acre.
Cycle time regression equations
Regression equations (Table 3) developed from the time
study have significant p-values (p < 0.05,  = 0.05) for all the
associated variables. Model validation procedures showed
that the differences between the observed and predicted cycle
times were insignificant (p > 0.05) for all the equations, which
means developed regression equations are good predictors for
the machine cycle time.
The feller-buncher equation indicated that the cycle time
was influenced by all kinds of moving distances. A denser
stand requiring shorter moving distances would result shorter
cycle times. The skidder regression function excluded DBH
due to severe multicollinearity with number of stems per skid-
ding cycle and its statistical insignificance (p > 0.05) in pre-
dicting the skidding cycle time. The equation implied that a
decrease in skidding distance would reduce cycle time. A
shorter cycle time could also be achieved by dragging more
trees per cycle, which would require the feller-buncher to
make larger bunches.
Tree size and swing degrees positively impacted the load-
ing cycle time, meaning that with trees decked close to the
grinder, requiring a small swing angle and by loading small
trees, cycle time would be reduced. In the loader equation,
both number of trees per loading cycle and DBH were signif-
icant (p = 0.004 and p < 0.0001, respectively); therefore, they
were kept in the equation despite moderate multicollinearity.
Total biomass weight processed by the grinder was the only
factor influencing grinding cycle time. Tree size and MC be-
came insignificant (p > 0.05) for grinding trees less than
5.0 inches in DBH in relatively short period of the observed
harvesting operations. The signed rank test revealed no aver-
age speed difference between travel-loaded and travel-empty
on highway (p = 0.062) and unpaved road (p = 0.062), in part
because travel-loaded was on favorable grade and travel-
empty was on adverse grade. The transportation distance on
various road types positively affected the hauling cycle time.
The regression coefficients suggested that given the same dis-
tance, spur road distance had the greatest effect on cycle time,
while the influence of highway distance was less.
Cycle biomass weight
Due to the difficulties in counting multiple small stems in
the felling cycles, the number of trees per skidding cycle was
used to estimate the number of trees per felling cycle, as field
observation verified the feller-buncher generally needed two

cycles to make a bunch for the skidder. In the skidder cycle
time regression, multicollinearity was detected between trees
per cycle and average DBH: trees per skidding cycle =
106.87–18.253·DBH, r2 = 0.48. The average DBH for the ob-
served felling cycles was 2.21 inches, which meant an average
of 33 trees or 387 dry pounds biomass were cut per cycle.
Using Eq. [1], the biomass dry weight per cycle for the skid-
ding and loading were calculated to be 1,317 dry pounds and
236 dry pounds, respectively. Energy plant scaling tickets
showed the grinding and hauling cycle biomass weights
ranged from 42,351 to 50,380 green pounds, averaging
43,898 green pounds, or 20,742 dry pounds.
Production rates
Combining the predicted cycle time with the cycle biomass
weight, production rates for all the machines were deter-
mined. They ranged from 2.31 BDT/PMH for the chip van to
39.32 BDT/PMH for the loader (Table 4). Despite shorter
cycle times in units 3 and 4, the feller-buncher had lower pro-
duction rates compared to units 1 and 2 due to lower cycle
biomass weights. For the same reason, the loader had the low-
est production rate in unit 3 although the shortest loading
cycle time also appeared there. Increasing cycle biomass
weight by harvesting larger trees is more important than re-
ducing the cycle time for improving the felling and loading
production rates. The skidding production rate was the lowest
at unit 4 where the average skidding distance was 884 feet and
was the highest at unit 1 where the average skidding distance
was 347 feet. The grinding production rate was quite uniform
across the four units as the grinding productivity was only
influenced by the weight of processed hog fuel. The transpor-
tation production rates were lower in units 1 and 2 compared
with units 3 and 4. Although units 1 and 2 enjoyed shorter
highway distances to the energy plant, they had to cover 8 and
10.5 miles of unpaved road plus 1.5 extra miles of spur road in
unit 1 (Table 5).

Delays
Delay types, associated delay time, and utilization rate for
the equipment are presented in Table 6. Machine cooling due
to hot season operations, teeth replacement because of rocks,
and diesel refueling caused 38.4 percent, 18.1 percent, and
29.6 percent of the feller-buncher delay time, respectively.
Because the feller-buncher could work independently from
other machines, it achieved the highest utilization rate of
88.1 percent in the system.
The skidder, loader, grinder, and chip van were operated as
a “hot” system, meaning one component of the system could
be affected by the productivity of another component. The
9-day shift-level data showed that waiting for truck caused the
largest portion of the skidder, loader, and grinder delay. Re-
gression analysis verified that the predicted cycle times for
hauling and grinding were around 179 minutes and 57 min-
utes. The use of more than one trailer in the system did not
increase the hauling productivity enough to match the produc-
tivities of other system parts. Hauling productivity was low
because the chip van was not designed for off-highway haul-
ing and only one highway truck driver was hired during the
operations in units 1, 2, and most of the time in unit 3.
Production costs
The total production costs by cutting unit ranged from
$49.20/BDT to $72.18/BDT. The overall production cost
was $55.27/BDT (Table 7). The transportation cost of
$26.11/BDT represented 47.24 percent of the total cost and
was the largest component of the total system cost, suggesting
the importance of maintaining operations close to the market.
The grinding cost was the second highest in the system fol-
lowed by felling, skidding, and loading in sequence. Another
study (Han et al. 2004) indicated that skidding cost is usually
higher than felling cost. Felling cost was higher than skidding
cost in this study because the small-diameter trees required
increased felling/bunching time.
Table 8 summarizes the site factors by cutting unit and the
associated total production costs. The production costs related
positively to the average DBH and skidding distance, but
negatively to the stand density and one-way hauling distance.
Three scenarios were simulated based on the pooled data from
unit 1 to unit 4 to test the impact of DBH on the production
cost. These scenarios included harvesting trees 2 to 5 inches,
3 to 5 inches, and 4 to 5 inches. The grinding and hauling costs
were assumed to remain at the observed values since their
productivities were independent of DBH. Table 9 shows that
a decrease in average DBH results in increased total costs.
From unit 1 to unit 4, spur road and unpaved road distances
were reduced, but the increase of longer highway distance
caused the increase of the total hauling distance. Due to the
stronger cost effect of spur road and unpaved road compared
with that of highway for the same distance, the total hauling
cost was reduced. The unit 3 and unit 4 had similar site pa-
rameters, but significantly different production cost. This was
due to the hiring of the second truck driver in unit 4, which
increased the system utilization rate and productivity.
Effects of hauling distance and
skidding distance on harvesting cost
The effect of hauling distance on the total cost was deter-
mined by setting one-way distance to 5, 10, 15, and 20 miles
for highway, unpaved road, and spur road, respectively. The
sensitivity test showed that overall production cost changed at
rates of $0.17, $0.62, and $7.86 per bone dry ton for each
additional mile of highway, unpaved road, and spur road, re-
spectively (Fig. 1). The greater influence of spur road and
unpaved road indicates that reducing off-highway hauling
should receive more attention in efforts to reduce production
cost.
The overall average skidding distance when traveling
empty and traveling loaded were 532 feet and 516 feet, re-
spectively. Cost changes were calculated for both skidding
distance reductions and increases of 100 feet and 200 feet. The
sensitivity test showed that the overall production cost would
increase $0.58/BDT for every 100 feet skidding distance in-
crease (Fig. 2). The effect of 100 feet skidding distance on the
cost is nearly equivalent to the cost change of travel on 1 mile
of unpaved road. Shortening the skidding distance should fac-
tor highly in the harvest planning.
Cost reduction potentials
Operational delays have a potential to be minimized by
knowing the productivities of system parts. Table 6 summa-
rizes the utilization rates for an assumed balanced system by
eliminating the “waiting on truck” time. The loading cost was
reduced most significantly due to the highest increase in its
utilization rate. The overall production cost (Table 10) was
reduced to $43.20/BDT, or 78 percent of the overall produc-
tion cost in the unbalanced condition.
Recovering forest biomass piled at landings can avoid fell-
ing and skidding costs and thereby reduce the total production
cost. If the felling and skidding cost were excluded in this
study, the remaining cost would be $42.82/BDT, or 77 percent
of the observed cost. If the system was balanced and the fell-
ing and skidding costs were excluded, the production cost
would be $32.55/BDT, or 59 percent of the observed cost.
Economic analysis
Figure 3 shows a break-even analysis for the simulated sce-
narios based on various tree sizes, skidding distances, and
one-way highway transportation distances. Other variables
were kept at average observed values. The market price of hog
fuel was set at $40/BDT. Scenario one represented the most
favorable operation conditions with the largest average stand
DBH and shortest skidding distance. When one-way highway

distance was 10 miles, the scenario one had the lowest pro-
duction of $44.35/BDT among the three scenarios, which is
still difficult to break-even with costs or to realize a profit.
Discussion
Tree size is not a significant factor in predicting the time of
felling, skidding, and grinding trees less than or equal to
5.0 inches in DBH. This should not be viewed as a common
feature of most harvesting operations, where felling, skidding,
and grinding productivities often increase with the increase of
the tree size. The insignificance of tree size in this study is
combined effect of small tree size and high machine capability.
Applying developed regression equations in other site con-
ditions need extra cautions. The predictive regression equa-
tions were developed over finite intervals for the values of
independent variables. Applications in the conditions where
the values are outside these intervals need a process of bias
correction (Pan et al. 2008b), particularly for the independent
variables other than distances.
Biomass fuel should not be viewed as the only product re-
sulting from fuel reduction treatments. A whole-tree harvest-
ing system can effectively reduce site preparation costs in the
future. More importantly, harvesting forest biomass for en-
ergy helps reduce fire risks in overstocked forests, prevent air
from being polluted by the smoke of prescribed fires, and cre-
ate a source of clean, renewable energy. These values should
be considered in addition to the market value of biomass fuel.
Conclusion
This study evaluated harvesting productivity and cost of a
mechanized fuel reduction thinning of small-diameter trees to

create forest biomass for energy. Under the conditions of tar-
get tree size (DBH)  5.0 inches, stand densities of 670 to
5,898 trees per acre, skidding distances of 347 to 884 feet, and
one-way hauling distance of 29.5 to 36 miles, hourly produc-
tivity for different machines varied from 2.31 to 39.32 BDT/
PMH, and the production costs including transportation
ranged from $49.20 to $72.18/BDT, averaging $55.27/BDT.
The average transportation cost of $26.11/BDT represented
47.24 percent of the total production cost. Maintaining an op-
eration close to markets could reduce the total cost due to
lower hauling costs and improved system balance. Spur road
distance had the strongest effect on transportation cost, fol-
lowed by distances of unpaved road and highway. Reducing
off-highway hauling should receive more attention in plan-
ning than overall distance. Well planned skidding placement
is critical in harvest planning since shorter skidding distances
decrease the skidding cost and thereby the total production
cost. The low biomass weight per cycle due to small-diameter
trees in the felling and loading operations overrode the effect
of short cycle time and made their production costs relatively
high. Grinding cost was quite uniform across the four units
since the production and cost were independent of most site
variables and related only to the weight of processed hog fuel.
System balancing by reducing the operational delays
greatly improved the production rate and lowered the cost. If
operations could rely totally on the biomass piled at the land-
ing through some other operation, the cost of recovering bio-
mass for energy would be further reduced. A market rate of
$40/BDT for biomass fuel is insufficient to break-even and
realize profit when harvesting, processing and transporting
small-diameter trees for energy. Other values, such as reduc-
ing fire risks, preventing smoke pollutions, and creating re-
newable energy sources, should increase the attractiveness of
harvesting forest biomass for energy.
