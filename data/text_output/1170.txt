Fire Ecology
Climate influences on future fire severity: 
a synthesis of climate‑fire interactions 
and impacts on fire regimes, high‑severity fire, 
and forests in the western United States
Tzeidle N. Wasserman1*    and Stephanie E. Mueller2 
Abstract 
Background  Increases in fire activity and changes in fire regimes have been documented in recent decades 
across the western United States. Climate change is expected to continue to exacerbate impacts to forested eco-
systems by increasing the frequency, size, and severity of wildfires across the western United States (US). Warming 
temperatures and shifting precipitation patterns are altering western landscapes and making them more susceptible 
to high-severity fire. Increases in large patches of high-severity fire can result in significant impacts to landscape pro-
cesses and ecosystem function and changes to vegetation structure and composition. In this synthesis, we exam-
ine the predicted climatic influence on fire regimes and discuss the impacts on fire severity, vegetation dynamics, 
and the interactions between fire, vegetation, and climate. We describe predicted changes, impacts, and risks related 
to fire with climate change and discuss how management options may mitigate some impacts of predicted fire sever-
ity, and moderate some impacts to forests, carbon, and vegetation changes post fire.
Results  Climate change is increasing fire size, fire severity, and driving larger patches of high-severity fire. Many 
regions are predicted to experience an increase in fire severity where conditions are hotter and drier and changes 
in fire regimes are evident. Increased temperatures, drought conditions, fuels, and weather are important drivers 
of fire severity. Recent increases in fire severity are attributed to changes in climatic water deficit (CMD), vapor pres-
sure deficit (VPD), evapotranspiration (ET), and fuels. Fire weather and vegetation species composition also influence 
fire severity. Future increases in fire severity are likely to impact forest resilience and increase the probability of forest 
type conversions in many ecosystems.
Conclusions  Increasing warming and drying trends are likely to cause more frequent and severe disturbances 
in many forested ecosystems in the near future. Large patches of high-severity fire have lasting legacies on vegetation 
composition and structure, and impacts on tree regeneration. In some ecosystems and under certain fire-weather 
conditions, restoration and fuel treatments may reduce the area burned at high severity and reduce conversions 
from forest to non-forest conditions, increasing forest resistance and resilience to wildland fire. Thinning and pre-
scribed fire treatments can be effective at reducing the potential for crown fire, reducing fuels, and promoting forest 
resilience.

Resumen 
Antecedentes  Incrementos en la actividad de incendios y cambios en los regímenes de fuego han sido documen-
tados en décadas recientes en todo el oeste de los EEUU. Se espera que el cambio climático continúe exacerbando 
su impacto en ecosistemas forestales del oeste de los EEUU, a través de un incremento en la frecuencia, tamaño, y 
severidad de los incendios. El aumento de la temperatura y cambios en los patrones de precipitación están alterando 
los paisajes del oeste y haciéndolos más susceptibles a incendios de alta severidad. El incremento de grandes parches 
ocasionados por fuegos muy severos puede resultar en impactos significativos en la estructura y composición de la 
vegetación. En esta síntesis, examinamos la influencia del cambio climático pronosticado, en los regímenes de fuegos 
y discutimos su impacto en la severidad de los incendios, en la dinámica de la vegetación, y en las interacciones entre 
el fuego, la vegetación y el clima. Describimos los cambios pronosticados, y el impacto y los riesgos relacionados a los 
incendios con el cambio climático, y discutimos como las diferentes opciones de manejo pueden mitigar algunos 
impactos en la severidad pronosticada, y moderar otros en el bosque, en el carbono y en otros cambios en la veg-
etación post fuego.
Resultados  El cambio climático estaría incrementando el tamaño de los incendios, la severidad, y conduciendo 
a mayores parches de fuegos de alta severidad. Se pronostica a la vez, que muchas regiones donde las condiciones 
serán más cálidas y secas, experimentarán cambios evidentes en los regímenes de fuegos. Incrementos en las tem-
peraturas, condiciones de sequía, combustibles, y situaciones meteorológicas predisponentes serán importantes 
condicionantes en la severidad de los fuegos. Incrementos recientes en la severidad de los fuegos son atribuidos 
a cambios en el déficit climático de humedad (CMD), en el déficit de vapor de difusión (VPD), evapotranspiración (ET), 
y combustibles. El Clima de fuego y la composición de especies también influencia la severidad del fuego. Incremen-
tos futuros en la severidad del fuego podrían impactar en la resiliencia de los bosques e incrementar la probabilidad 
de su conversión a otros ecosistemas.
Conclusiones  Las tendencias de incremento en las temperaturas y condiciones de sequía probablemente causen 
disturbios más frecuentes y severos en muchos ecosistemas boscosos en un futuro próximo. Grandes parches de alta 
severidad tienen legados duraderos en la estructura y composición de la vegetación e impactos en la regeneración 
de los árboles. En algunos ecosistemas proclives a incendios, y bajo ciertas condiciones atmosféricas, la restaura-
ción y tratamientos del combustible pueden reducir las áreas quemadas a alta severidad y también la conversión 
de bosques a condiciones de no-bosque, incrementando la resiliencia y resistencia de los bosques a los incendios 
de vegetación. Los raleos y tratamientos con quemas prescriptas pueden ser efectivos en reducir la probabilidad de 
producirse fuegos de copas, reducir la carga de combustibles, y promover la resiliencia de los bosques.
Introduction
Fire is a keystone process in many ecosystems and affects 
forest structure, species composition, carbon storage, 
soils, and wildlife habitat. Ecosystems are adapted to 
particular fire regimes that control the seasonality, pat-
tern, frequency, and severity of fire within the system. 
Climate change is influencing fire regimes and impact-
ing landscape processes and ecosystem functions. Fire 
activity is increasing globally (Bowman et al. 2011), and 
warming temperatures and increasing aridity are influ-
encing patterns of fire activity across the western United 
States (Littell et al. 2009; Higuera et al. 2015; Abatzoglou 
and Williams 2016; Williams and Abatzoglou 2016; Abat-
zoglou et al. 2017). Higher temperatures can lead to an 
increase in fire ignitions and a faster rate of fire spread 
due to decreased fuel moisture and extreme fire weather 
conditions (Abatzoglou and Williams 2016; Westerling 
2016). Altered fire regimes can increase the vulnerability 
of these systems to vegetation type conversions, invasive 
species, reduce carbon stocks, impact wildlife habitat 
and watershed health, and directly affect human infra-
structure (Hurteau and Brooks 2011; Moody et al. 2013; 
Calkin et  al. 2014; Johnstone et  al. 2016; Walker et  al. 
2018; Stevens-Rumann et al. 2018; Coop et al. 2020).
Increases in area burned by wildland fire across the 
western US have been documented since the 1980s and 
have been linked with warmer and drier conditions (Den-
nison et al. 2014; Abatzoglou and Williams 2016; Wester-
ling 2016). The total area burned and area burned at high 
severity has increased in forest and woodland ecosystems 
across the western US (Littell et  al. 2009; Dillon et  al. 
2011; Miller and Safford 2012; Singleton et al. 2019). Fur-
thermore, over the past several decades, there has been 
a well-documented increase in the number of large fires 
(Westerling et al. 2006; Miller et al. 2009a, b; Dennison 
et al. 2014; Singleton et al. 2019), and increased fire-sea-
son length (Westerling et al. 2006). An increased shift in 
fire activity across the western US since the year 2000 has 

Page 3 of 22
Wasserman and Mueller ﻿Fire Ecology           (2023) 19:43 
	
been noted in long-term datasets that examine temporal 
trends in fire severity (Abatzoglou and Williams 2016; 
Dillon et al. 2011; Mueller et al. 2020), as well as a docu-
mented increase in high-severity fire across many regions 
(Singleton et al. 2019; Parks and Abatzoglou 2020; Huang 
et al. 2020; Mueller et al. 2020) (Fig. 1). Warming temper-
atures and an earlier onset of snowmelt have increased 
the length of fire seasons and lowered fuel moisture in 
many regions, allowing large extents of the western US 
landscape to remain dry and flammable for longer peri-
ods of time (Westerling et al. 2006; Miller et al. 2012).
Several studies have quantified the temporal trends in 
annual fire severity (Dillon et al. 2011; Miller and Safford 
2012; Miller et al. 2012; Stevens et al. 2017; Reilly et al. 
2017; Singleton et al. 2019; Parks and Abatzoglou 2020). 
Typically, patterns of fire behavior are driven by topog-
raphy, fuels, and weather. However, over the long-term 
climate change is impacting plant productivity and mois-
ture availability, and thus influencing the amount of fuels 
and available biomass on the landscape and changing fire 
regimes (Fig. 2) (Krawchuck and Moritz 2011; Parks et al. 
2014; Abatzoglou  et al. 2018). Examining the climatic 
influence on fire severity is important to understand-
ing how wildland fire is impacting ecosystems, and how 
that may change with hotter and drier conditions (Abat-
zoglou et al. 2017; Keyser and Westerling 2017; Mueller 
et al. 2020). Additionally, an increase in human ignitions 
and values at risk is increasing, and understanding how 
to allocate fire resources and funds is necessary. Long-
term climatic variables coupled with fire perimeter data 
can elucidate contemporary climate-fire interactions and 
model future predicted fire severity (Parks et  al. 2016). 
Regional fuel conditions and climate conditions can lead 
to both increases and decreases in fire activity under 
future climate conditions, but less is known about the 
influence of climate change on fire severity.
In this synthesis, we review the relevant body of lit-
erature and discuss the forecasted impacts of climate

change on fire severity across forests in the western 
US. We assessed published papers that used empirical 
and simulation models to project future fire severity 
with respect to climate change effects. These simula-
tions explicitly model the climatic influence on fire 
and fire regimes across western US forests, and discuss 
the impacts on fire severity, vegetation dynamics, and 
the interactions between fire, vegetation, and climate. 
We describe predicted changes, impacts and risks 
related to fire with climate change, and discuss how 
management options may mitigate impacts of high-
severity fire where it is not desired. We then discuss 
what effects fuel and restoration treatments can have 
on fire severity, forest resilience, and forest carbon.
Methods
We used evidence-based review protocols (Pullin and 
Stewart 2006; Lortie 2014) to find the relevant body 
of literature that exists on this subject area. Keyword 
search strings and multiple databases were used to 
identify relevant publications on climate-fire interac-
tions and climate impacts on fire severity (Table  1). 
Five independent online science-based search engines 
were examined, (CAB Abstracts, ProQuest, BIOSIS, 
Web of Science, and Google Scholar), and the litera-
ture cited sections of relevant publications prior to 
April 2022. We required that papers included in this 
synthesis specifically model climate influence on fire 
severity were focused in western US forests and were

behavior on the landscape, including fire intensity, severity, and spread. Climate directly influences vegetation patterns and fuel characteristics 
across the landscape. Climate and weather drive fuel flammability, fire behavior, and fire patterns at the scale of the fire and on shorter temporal 
scales

published in refereed journal articles. The potentially 
relevant publications were then screened to eliminate 
those that did not meet our inclusion criteria, and the 
remaining papers were searched to determine if all cri-
teria were met.
We assessed the body of literature the search identi-
fied within the five science-based databases examining 
climatic influences on fire severity. We added additional 
papers not found in our search strings but were later 
found to be relevant subject matter. In this synthe-
sis, we discuss how high-severity fire is measured and 
defined, examine the climatic influence on fire regimes, 
and review the types of fire-climate models. We then 
synthesize modeling studies of future projections of cli-
matic influence on high-severity fire. We discuss climate-
induced shifts in fire severity, climate-fire-vegetation 
dynamics, and discuss fuel and restoration treatment 
effects on fire severity and forest resilience (Table 2).
Results
Synthesis of the literature
High‑severity fire
Fire severity is defined as the effect of fire on the environ-
ment, and characterizes the amount of ecosystem change 
caused by fire (Key and Benson 2006; Lentile et al. 2006). 
Fire severity is measured by the degree of fire-induced 
change and includes the loss of vegetation above and 
belowground, and soil impacts (Key and Benson 2006; 
Miller and Thode 2007; Keeley 2009). Soil burn severity 
is measured as the estimated effect of heat transfer from 
vegetation burning on the surface and the combustion of 
organic material into the soil layers (Keeley 2009). High-
severity fire commonly creates large areas of overstory 
tree mortality, extensive soil damage, and vulnerability 
to extreme hydrologic events (Neary et al. 1999; Yocom-
Kent et al. 2015). Fire severity can be measured via field-
based metrics or satellite-derived imagery. Field-based 
measurements of fire severity identify total fire effects 
following a fire occurrence (e.g., soil organic matter loss, 
vegetation mortality, tree scorching) (Key and Benson 
2006; De Santis and Chuvieco 2009). Satellite-derived 
indices are based on the relationships between remotely 
sensed spectral indices, where the difference between 
pre- and post-fire spectral characteristics is evaluated 
from satellite images (e.g. Landsat). These indices include 
the relativized burn ratio (RBR), delta normalized burn 
ratio (dNBR), and its relativized form (RdNBR); such 
indices typically quantify fire severity as the degree of 
fire-induced change to vegetation and soils, as inferred 
from changes in surface reflectance in the near-infrared 
and shortwave infrared portions of the electromagnetic 
spectrum (Key and Benson 2006; Lentile et  al. 2006; 
Miller and Thode 2007; De Santis and Chuvieco 2009; 
Parks et  al. 2014). Maps of wildfire burn severity show 
the immediate fire effects and long-term ecosystem 
changes and are often used to mitigate post-fire effects, 
are used in monitoring wildfire effects and patterns, and 
in future fire planning (Robichaud et al. 2007). The Moni-
toring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) is a platform that 
maps fire severity and extent of large fires (≥ 404 ha, or 
1000 acres) across all lands of the United States from 
1984 to present and provides data to public users (Eiden-
shink et al. 2007; Picotte et al. 2020) (www.​mtbs.​gov). The 
Rapid Assessment of Vegetation Condition after Wildfire 
(RAVG) provides burn severity and vegetation condi-
tions after large wildland fires (≥ 404 ha, or 1000 acres)

Fire severity is scale dependent and influenced by veg-
etation type, fire history, accumulation of forest fuels, 
topography, fire weather, climate, dry fuel conditions, and 
past management (Dillon et al. 2011; Mallek et al. 2013; 
Harris and Taylor 2015; Hessburg et al. 2015; Fang et al. 
2015; Parks et  al. 2014, 2018a; Stevens-Rumann et  al. 
2016; Keyser and Westerling 2017). At a coarse scale 
(e.g. ecoregions), high-severity fire is associated with fuel 
characteristics, fire weather (Keyser and Westerling 2017; 
Parks et  al. 2018a), vegetation management (Prichard 
and Kennedy 2014), topography (Dillon et al. 2011), and 
climatic variables (e.g. climatic moisture deficit, evapo-
transpiration, mean temperature) (Parks et  al. 2018b). 
Current live vegetation on the landscape is an important 
driver of fire severity across many ecoregions (Parks et al. 
2018a; Singleton et al. 2019), and management efforts to 
reduce live fuels in high-risk landscapes via fuel treat-
ments, prescribed fire, and managed wildland fire have 
the potential to reduce fire severity (Prichard et al. 2020; 
Cansler et al. 2022). Spatial variation in fire severity is a 
result of fire intensity and spread across the landscape. 
Across the West, topography and climate interact and 
influence fire extent and burn severity (Taylor and Skin-
ner 2003; Dillon et  al. 2011), where topography influ-
ences the spatial distribution of vegetation and fuels, fuel 
moisture, and temperature (Dillon et al. 2011). Increas-
ing areas of high-severity fire can occur when a greater 
area is burned at a constant proportion of high-severity 
fire. The mosaic of severely burned, lightly burned, and 
unburned forest patches drives the future configuration 
of forest structure and succession (Turner et  al. 1997). 
The burn mosaic and fire severity patterns can drive 
ecosystem responses to fire events (Hollingsworth et al. 
2013; Liu et al. 2014; Turner 2010), such as post fire veg-
etation, impact soil erosion, and the ability of a forested 
patch to remain forested. High-severity fire is a natural 
component of certain ecosystems; however, the increas-
ing occurrence of large patches of high-severity fire is 
becoming more prevalent and can have lasting legacies 
on vegetation composition and tree regeneration patterns 
(Miller et al. 2012; Abatzoglou and Williams 2016; West-
erling 2016). High-severity fire can alter the trajectory 
of vegetation recovery post-fire (Turner 2010; McKen-
zie et al. 2011; Meng et al. 2015), and with compounding 
climate and drought impacts the risk of vegetation type 
change occurring on post-fire landscape increases.
Fire behavior is influenced by vegetation type, fuel 
loading, terrain, and fire weather, and these factors cause 
heterogeneity in fire severity across a landscape during 
a fire event. Wildland fire often exhibits high inter-and 
intra-fire heterogeneity, burning with varying degrees of 
severity (Lentile et al. 2007) depending on fuel load, veg-
etation type, topography, climate, and weather (Cansler 
and McKenzie 2014; Harvey et  al. 2016). Topography 
impacts vegetation type and growth, and fire behavior on 
different topographic features (Dillon et al. 2011; Povak 
et al. 2018), while the interaction among climate, weather, 
and fuels drives fire behavior. Topography affects the 
spatial distribution of fuels and local wind and weather 
patterns at a fine scale. Fire behavior is complex, and 
fire severity is difficult to predict during extreme fire 
years with many large fires (Dillon et al. 2011; Parks et al. 
2018a).
Climate influence on fire
Climate is an important driver of variability in fire activ-
ity in the western US at annual, decadal, and centennial 
time scales (Swetnam and Betancourt 1990; Littell et al. 
2009; Kitzberger et  al. 2007; Marlon et  al. 2012; Mar-
golis et  al. 2017). General circulation models (GCMs) 
consistently project increasing temperatures in North 
America through the end of the ­21st century, with a 
greater proportion of precipitation falling as rain rather 
than snow and an earlier onset of snowmelt, resulting 
in longer fire seasons in the western US (Scholze et al. 
2006; Littell et al. 2009), and global climate models pre-
dict -4.7 to +13.5% change in precipitation (Mote et al. 
2014). Climate models predict an increase in tempera-
ture western-wide. By 2100, temperatures in the west-
ern US are expected to increase in the Northern Rockies 
(+5 °F to 12 °F) (Stocker et al. 2013), Interior Rockies 
(+5.5 °F to 9.5 °F) (Lukas et al. 2014), Northwest (+2°F 
to 5.4 °F) (Mote et al. 2014), Southwest (+5 °F to 12 °F) 
(Cayan et al. 2013), California Sierra Nevada (+5 °F to 
10 °F) (Reich et al. 2018), and coastal California (+2 °F 
to 4 °F) (Pierce et al. 2018) (Fig. 3). Models agree that 
extreme precipitation and disturbance events will 
increase, and the length of time between precipitation 
events will increase (Mote et al. 2014; Easterling et al. 
2017). These models assume temperature change and 
representative concentration pathways (RCP; emission 
scenarios) RCP 4.5 (moderate emission scenario) and 
RCP 8.5 (highest emission scenario) (Moss et al. 2010) 
using global climate model CM3.
Contemporary climate is influencing fire severity 
causing both increases and decreases in severity across 
ecoregions and varies along a moisture gradient (Parks 
et al. 2016). Increased climate-water deficit (CWD) and 
vapor pressure deficit (VPD) can increase fire frequency 
and decrease vegetation productivity in water-limited 
regions of the western US (Parks et al. 2016; Mueller et al. 
2020), and can reduce the amount of biomass available 
on a landscape to burn, reducing fire severity. Long-term 
increases in minimum temperature and climate-water

deficit have been found to drive the increased percent-
age of area burned at high severity, and areas that burned 
had a higher climatic water deficit and lower fuel mois-
ture (Huang et al. 2020). Annual area burned by wildland 
fire across the western US is projected to increase up to 
five times of that observed in 1961–2004 by the year 2039 
(Kitzberger et  al. 2017), and fire seasons have become 
2–3 months longer when compared to previous decades 
(Jolly et al. 2015).
Forest fuels on the landscape are an important compo-
nent of fire severity and are influenced by precipitation 
and temperature. Increased temperatures and low pre-
cipitation drive forest fuel availability, fuel moisture, and 
fuel flammability, and is an important component to fire 
regimes and fire severity (Krawchuck and Moritz 2011; 
Pausas and Paula 2012). Fuel moisture is driven by long-
term climate coupled with low precipitation and higher 
temperatures that dry out fuels on the landscape. Leaf 
water content (normalized difference moisture index, 
NDMI) has been found to be a driver of fire severity 
(Estes et al. 2017; Parks et al. 2014). Climate drivers inter-
act with fuel amount and continuity across the landscape 
and are often confounded by interannual climate vari-
ability (Abatzoglou et al. 2018). Decades of fire exclusion, 
logging activity, grazing, and management practices have 
promoted a build-up of fuels and high tree densities in 
many areas, increasing their susceptibility to large-scale, 
high-severity fire (Hagmann et al. 2014; Hessburg et al. 
2015). Vegetation management activities (Thompson 
et al. 2007; Prichard and Kennedy 2014) and the presence

of previous fire (Parks et al. 2014; Stevens-Rumann et al. 
2016) have been shown to reduce fire severity.
Drivers of fire severity in the western US include tem-
perature, water deficit, drought conditions, fire weather 
and relative humidity, and seasonal precipitation. Tem-
perature is often correlated with fire extent and severity 
in the western US (Westerling et  al. 2006) and relative 
humidity controls fuel moisture and consequently fire 
behavior (Brown et al. 2004; Westerling et al. 2011). Fire 
severity can vary with short-term weather, temperature 
extremes, and can be exacerbated by drought conditions. 
High temperature and precipitation extremes intensify 
droughts and the climate moisture deficit (Diffenbaugh 
et al. 2015), which can increase burn severity (Crockett 
and Westerling 2018). The relationship between drought 
and fire is complex, and the frequency and intensity of 
drought events impact fuel flammability and fire behav-
ior. Fire size and area of high-severity fire were found to 
be greater during drought events than moderate or wet 
periods across the western US (Crockett and Westerling 
2018). However, a wet spring followed by a period of dry 
months can bring abundant fuels and understory con-
ditions that then rapidly dry out, leading to larger fires. 
Wetter conditions may promote the production of fine 
fuels that can promote fire during subsequent drought 
years (Jin et  al. 2014). Alternatively, prolonged drought 
conditions and lack of precipitation can reduce the avail-
ability of forest fuels, thus limiting fire occurrence and 
leading to less severe fire in ecosystems that then become 
fuel and biomass limited. Long-term drought condi-
tions have delayed effects on forest conditions and fuels 
and can intensify fire risk and fire severity (van Mant-
gem et al. 2013). The interaction of drought and fire also 
impacts vegetation recovery post fire. Regional and global 
circulation patterns (e.g., El Nino Southern Oscillation 
(ENSO), Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO)) drive drought 
severity and extent, while local factors like topography 
control drought impacts at a particular location (McCabe 
et al. 2004).
There are significant interactions and feedbacks between 
climate, fire, and vegetation. Climate change and human 
influence have shifted fire regimes, which consequently 
impacts the vegetation and fuels on the landscape (West-
erling et al. 2006; Westerling 2016; Abatzoglou and Wil-
liams 2016; McKenzie and Littell 2017) (Fig.  2). Climate 
variables such as precipitation and temperature drive the 
local and regional water-balance, which affects fire occur-
rence, spread, and severity via effects on fuel moisture, 
abundance, and distribution (Mueller et  al. 2020). Cli-
mate directly influences fire regimes by influencing fire 
season length and fuel moisture (Pausas and Paula 2012; 
Jolly et al. 2015; Holden et al. 2018), and via its influence 
on vegetation productivity (Krawchuk et  al. 2009). Fire 
modifies vegetation composition and structure, including 
effects on fuel type and amount, connectivity of fuels, and 
fuel moisture (Krawchuk et al. 2009; Holden et al. 2018). 
These factors then shape the spread and severity of subse-
quent fires (Westerling 2016; Parks and Abatzoglou 2020). 
The strength of fire-vegetation feedbacks is influenced by 
climate and can be either positive or negative. A severe fire 
can convert a forested landscape into drier shrub-domi-
nated landscapes that have continuous fuels (Tepley et al. 
2017). This post-fire vegetation is easily burned in a subse-
quent fire, thus driving a positive feedback where non-for-
est conditions persist. Alternatively, severe fire can convert 
forests to early-seral vegetation that is less flammable, 
reducing the risk for a subsequent severe fire (Tepley et al. 
2017; Coop et  al. 2020). The strength of the feedback is 
driven by climate and drought. Warmer and drier climate 
conditions may reduce vegetation growth with less veg-
etation and fuels available to burn, and these areas then 
become biomass limited, and fire risk decreases (Parks 
et al. 2016). Warming and drying trends can delay forest 
recovery and tree seedling establishment and growth, and 
via the unavailability of seed sources in large patches of 
high-severity fire (Chambers et al. 2016; Stevens-Rumann 
and Morgan 2019).
The effects of climate on forest dynamics and fire 
regimes have the potential to cause large shifts in tree 
species distribution and vegetation composition (Liang 
et al. 2017; Mathys et al. 2016; Serra-Diaz et al. 2018; 
Cassell et  al. 2019). Wildland fire and drought can 
cause shifts towards altered vegetative communities 
(Parks et al. 2018a), and forested ecosystems may often 
experience lagged responses to climate change (Ber-
trand et al. 2011; Liang et al. 2016). The interaction of 
climate, fuels, topography, vegetation, and weather is 
complex and can impact fire severity in multiple ways. 
Higher temperatures cause extensive drying of forest 
fuels, making western ecosystems more flammable dur-
ing extended fire season lengths (Abatzoglou and Wil-
liams 2016). High spring and summer temperatures 
combined with previous-year or current year drought 
conditions can drive regional variations in large fire 
occurrence and extent, driven by the drying of forest 
fuels (Westerling et al. 2006; Heyerdahl et al. 2008; Lit-
tell et al. 2009; Westerling 2016). Projected hotter and 
drier conditions across some areas in the western US 
may directly increase fire severity by drying out fuels 
and vegetation, with dry years experiencing higher 
burn severity than wet years.
Understanding annual trends in area burned and area 
burned at high severity can aid in understanding pat-
terns and drivers, and identify refugia. Few west-wide 
analyses exist, and responses vary by ecoregion. Parks 
and Abatzoglou (2020) quantified the annual area burned 

Page 13 of 22
Wasserman and Mueller ﻿Fire Ecology           (2023) 19:43 
	
and annual area burned at high severity from 1985–2017. 
They examined four ecoregions (Northern mountains, 
Western mountains, Southwest, and California Coast) 
and found that all ecoregions except the California Coast 
experienced an increasing positive trend in annual area 
burned and annual area burned at high severity. This 
trend was substantial across western US forests, where 
the area burned at high severity increased by 184,000 ha 
(454,674 acres). By ecoregion, mean annual area burned 
at high severity increased by at least 35,000  ha (86,487 
acres) from 1984 to 2017. Annual mean fire severity and 
the annual proportion of area burned at high severity 
increased in both the Northern mountains and South-
west ecoregion. These trends in increasing high-severity 
area were positively correlated with mean maximum 
vapor pressure deficit, mean maximum temperature, and 
climatic water deficit. Warmer and drier conditions were 
evident from 1985 to 2017 in the CA Coast, Northern 
mountains, and Western mountains regions, as well as 
the broader western US These warmer and drier fire sea-
sons corresponded to more high-severity fire across the 
western US (Parks and Abatzoglou 2020).
Fire‑climate models
Fire-climate models are used to predict future fire sever-
ity with climate change variables. These models help 
elucidate the potential effects of changing climatic con-
ditions, vegetation dynamics, fire weather, and landscape 
conditions on future fire frequency and fire severity. Sat-
ellite-derived fire severity data such as MTBS, other plat-
forms (e.g. RAVG, LANDFIRE) and other derived data 
products (e.g. Parks et al. 2018b) are common post-fire 
data products used in models. Empirical models use the 
statistical relationship between observed historical cli-
mate and historical area burned during the recent past 
(the last 100 years) to predict future area burned and area 
burned at high severity. Predicted future area burned and 
fire severity are based on modeled projections of pre-
cipitation and temperature from global climate models 
or regionally downscaled models. Some of these models 
account for previous fires or changes in vegetation post-
fire. Machine learning statistical models can be used to 
model how fine-scale environmental variables control 
the spatial and temporal patterns of fire severity. Models 
can also identify the relative importance of key drivers 
of fire severity and how they may change under chang-
ing wet and dry conditions. Mechanistic models include 
the interactions of vegetation, climate, and fuels under 
changing and novel future climate conditions. These 
models are complex and link climate, weather, and fuel 
patterns to fire frequency and area burned. Some mecha-
nistic models that simulate fire include dynamic global 
vegetation models, such as LANDFIRE NextGen (Parks 
et al. 2014, 2018b), LANDIS-II (Scheller and Mladenoff 
2008), FireBioGeoChemical (Fire-BGCv2; Keane et  al. 
2011), and Individual-based Forest Landscape and Dis-
turbance Model (iLand) (Seidl et  al. 2012, Seidl  and 
Rammer 2019).
Future projections of wildland fire with climatic influence: 
impacts on fire severity, fire regime, and vegetation dynamics
Models help elucidate potential changes in fire sever-
ity under predicted changing climate. Notably, fire-
climate models often aim to project future fire severity 
and impacts on the landscape processes, including veg-
etation, carbon dynamics, and forest resilience. In this 
review, we focused on models that predicted fire-climate 
interactions in western US forests and their impacts on 
fire severity. Models of future projections of fire-climate 
interactions include climate-induced shifts in fire sever-
ity, changes in vegetation and forest dynamics, climate-
fire impacts on biomass and carbon, how fuels and 
restoration treatments can be used to mitigate climate-
fire effects, and changes in hydrology. There were few 
studies addressing large-scale western-wide climate-
severity interactions (e.g., Parks et  al. 2016, 2018a, b, 
2019), and most studies were based on smaller forested 
landscapes (Table 2). These studies examined the prob-
ability of future fire severity and drivers of high-severity 
fire (Parks et al. 2016), and climate-fire-vegetation effects 
(Parks et al. 2018b, 2019).
Climate‑induced shifts in fire severity  Projecting future 
changes in fire severity as a function of climate can help 
us understand how future climate conditions will affect 
fire regimes and forest fuel loads. A climate-induced 
increase in fire activity is predicted in many forests in the 
western US, and an increase in fire frequency, increased 
area burned, and increased fire severity is predicted in 
the Rocky Mountains of Wyoming (Hansen et al. 2020), 
Sierra-Nevada mountains California (Krofcheck et  al. 
2017a; Serra-Diaz et al. 2018), central Oregon mountains 
(Cassell et al. 2019), and the southwestern US (Hurteau 
2017; Loehman et al. 2018; O’Donnell et al. 2018; Krof-
check et  al. 2019; O’Conner et  al. 2020). These studies 
predict major shifts in species composition and post-fire 
vegetation. Climate directly influences fuel moisture, veg-
etation productivity and biomass, and fire season length 
(Krawchuk et al. 2009; Pausas and Paula 2012; Jolly et al. 
2015; Holden et  al. 2018). Precipitation and tempera-
ture affect moisture availability (wet vs dry), and fuel 
moisture, abundance, and distribution (Parks et al. 2014; 
Mueller et  al. 2020). The results of models predicting 
climate impacts on fire regimes and fire severity are not 
easily parsed by forest type, ecoregion, or climate, and 
vary by scale. Each large-scale western-wide study should 

Page 14 of 22
Wasserman and Mueller ﻿Fire Ecology           (2023) 19:43 
be evaluated individually, as data inputs, climate mod-
els, ecoregion delineations, and metrics used to evaluate 
impacts differ.
At broad temporal scales, the indirect influence of cli-
mate on fire severity in the western US may be driven by 
changes in annual precipitation and an increased water 
deficit that can increase water stress and decrease veg-
etative productivity (Parks et al. 2016). Cooler and wet-
ter forested regions (Pacific Northwest, Northern Rocky 
Mountains, and Southern Rocky Mountains) can have a 
higher probability of higher fire severity, while over time 
fire severity is predicted to decrease in the Southwestern 
US (Arizona, New Mexico) (Parks et al. 2016). The broad 
potential decrease in future fire severity in the south-
western US is attributed to a warmer and drier climate, 
where less vegetation and fuels over time result in less 
burnable biomass available on the landscape (Parks et al. 
2016). This is due to a higher water deficit, lower vege-
tative productivity, and less biomass available if vegeta-
tion and fuels track changes with climate in equilibrium 
(Parks et al. 2016). This study is based on using climate 
as a proxy for vegetation and fuels, and more broad-scale 
studies are needed to elucidate trends over ecoregions 
and large spatial extents and understand the uncertainty.
Alternatively, when vegetation is explicitly used in the 
models, the results can conflict with models that don’t 
account for climate and vegetation interactions directly. 
For example, Parks et  al. (2018b) examined climate-
induced shifts in fire regime and vegetation over ecore-
gions in the western US. The mean fire return interval 
and probability of stand-replacing fire vary along a cli-
mate moisture deficit gradient. Under extreme condi-
tions when climate moisture deficit is high, the mean fire 
return interval and probability of stand-replacing fire 
are also high. Regions with cooler and wetter climates 
are predicted to have a shorter mean fire return interval 
(increased fire frequency) and therefore a decreased fire 
severity over time, whereas warmer and drier regions 
are predicted to have longer mean fire return interval 
(decreased fire frequency) and increased fire severity 
over time. In wet regions where there is a low climate 
moisture deficit, mean fire return interval and probability 
of stand-replacing fire are predicted to decrease, which 
indicates higher fire frequency and lower fire severity 
(Parks et al. 2018b).
Climate‑fire‑vegetation 
dynamics  Incorporating 
the 
interaction of climate, vegetation, and fire is important 
in understanding complex ecosystem dynamics, and 
climate-induced shifts in fire regimes will have a signifi-
cant impact on vegetation responses. Parks et al. (2018b) 
predicted future vegetation distributions associated with 
interactions between future climate conditions and fire. 
Cold forest is predicted to be highly impacted, where 16% 
of reference period cold forest will remain cold forest in 
2085, 19% will become a mesic forest, 51% is predicted 
to change to dry forest, and 14% is predicted to become 
shrubland/grassland. This corresponds to a decrease 
in mean fire return interval (higher fire frequency) but 
a decrease in fire severity, due to a decrease in produc-
tivity and overall biomass. Mesic forest is predicted to 
remain stable, where 59% of mesic forest remains mesic 
under a future climate (2085) and is not expected to 
change vegetation class; however, 36% of current mesic 
forest is expected to shift to dry forest. In dry forests, the 
mean fire return interval (FRI) and percent of replace-
ment severity fire (PRS) (Rollins 2009; www.​landf​ire.​gov) 
are expected to increase, especially along the ecotone 
between forest and shrubland/grassland ecosystems, 
suggesting a future transition from forest to non-forest. 
About 52% of dry forest is expected to stay as dry forest 
however, 41% of dry forest may shift to shrubland/grass-
land (Parks et al. 2018b). This study assumes fire regimes 
and vegetation will keep pace with climate change 
and does not implicitly allow for the lag in vegetation 
response to climate.
Vegetation change and probability of stand-replacing 
fire across the interior western US were modeled using 
fire severity datasets (NextGen; 1 km resolution) (Parks 
et  al. 2019). This study used gridded climate data and 
gridded vegetation data to examine future forest cover 
(1  km resolution) under future climate and the differ-
ences between current and mid-21st century distribution 
of forest to evaluate potential climate-induced change in 
forest extent and distribution. Under future predicted 
climate conditions, 35.8% of current forested area is 
predicted to become climatically unsuitable for forests 
by mid-century as conditions generally become warmer 
and drier. Across the Intermountain West, 32,000 ­km2 
of these future climatically unsuitable forested areas are 
predicted to be susceptible to stand-replacing fire. Under 
average weather conditions 15.1% of UT-WY Rockies, 
10% of the Southern Rockies, and 3.7% of the Arizona 
and New Mexico mountains is predicted to experience 
stand-replacing fire by the mid-21st century. Under 
extreme weather conditions, 30% of current forested 
areas in the Colorado Plateau, Arizona and New Mexico 
Mountains, and the Apache Highlands are predicted to 
be susceptible to stand-replacing fire (Parks et al. 2019).
The LANDIS II model was used to simulate forest and 
fire dynamics under future climate scenarios using 
downscaled climate projections and representative

concentration pathways (RCP; emission scenarios) 
RCP4.5 and RCP 8.5 (2010–2100) (Moss et al. 2010) in 
a mixed conifer forest in the southern Blue Mountains 
of central Oregon (Cassell et al. 2019). Increases in fire 
severity, frequency, and area burned were predicted 
under future projected climate, where 20.4–22.4% of the 
forested landscape is expected to be burned by a high-
severity fire at least once over the simulation period 
compared to 12.2% under contemporary climate. A 20% 
increase in extreme fire years, defined as years with at 
least 40,000  ha (98,842 acres) burned, is projected to 
drive a shift in species composition with a decline in 
sub-alpine species (Abies lasiocarpa, Picea engelmannii, 
Pinus albicaulis) and increases in lower elevation species 
(Pinus ponderosa, Abies grandis).
Serra-Diaz et  al. (2018) used LANDIS II to predict 
potential shifts in vegetation and forest dynamics due 
to changes in fire severity under four climate change 
scenarios over early (2015–2042), mid (2043–2070), 
and late century (2071–2100) in the Klamath forest of 
northern California and southwest Oregon. The data 
included four GCMs and RCPs that cover the range 
of climate change conditions predicted for the study 
area (hotter and drier, hotter and wetter, slightly hot-
ter and slightly wetter, slightly hotter and slightly drier). 
Climate change is predicted to increase fire size and 
severity and drive larger patches of high-severity fire 
(> 50 ha, 124 acres). This increase is more pronounced 
in the late century (2071–2100) under the warmest 
climate change scenarios (climate scenarios ACCESS 
8.5 (much hotter-drier) and CanESM2 (much hotter-
wetter RCP 8.5)) (IPCC 2013; Flato et al. 2013), where 
mega fires (200,000  ha and 500,000  ha; 494,000–1.24 
million acres) were more common. Simulations of both 
contemporary baseline and future climate change con-
ditions predicted a large shift in dominant vegetation, 
where 31% conifer forest is predicted to become shrub-
land-hardwood by 2100. This vegetation shift is par-
ticularly evident where conditions are drier and high 
fire activity is predicted. Overall, there was a predicted 
reduction in the fire rotation period, an increase in fire 
size and total area burned at high severity, a reduction 
in forest growth, and a shift in the annual establish-
ment probability of conifers due to low soil moisture 
and higher temperatures (Serra-Diaz et al. 2018).
Hansen et  al. (2020) used the iLand model to predict 
the influence of climate change on future fire in sub-
alpine forests of Greater Grand Teton National Park, 
Wyoming. Two climate scenarios using GCMs (CNRM-
CM5 and GFDL-ESM2M; RCP 8.5 and 4.5) were mod-
eled. Large, high-severity fires are predicted to increase 
by 2050, and the annual number of fires, area burned, 
and area-weighted mean fire size increased after 2050. 
Annual area burned 2018–2099 was 1,700% greater 
than it was 1989–2017 under the CNRM-CM5 RCP 8.5 
climate scenario. By 2098, only 65% of the current for-
est area remained forested due to increased fire activ-
ity during the mid-21st century dry period. Vegetation 
shifts were also projected, where the area dominated 
by lodgepole pine and spruce-fir forests declined after 
mid-century and Douglas-fir extent increases, replac-
ing lodgepole pine as the dominant forest type. Dif-
ferences in projected future fire activity between RCP 
scenarios allowed more forest remaining under RCP 4.5 
for both GCMs.
Fuel and restoration treatment effects on fire severity, forest 
resilience, and carbon
Many studies in this synthesis aimed to model climate-
fire interactions to predict fire severity and quantify if 
fuels and restoration treatments were effective to miti-
gate climate-driven fire severity and vegetation dynam-
ics under future climatic conditions and changing fire 
regimes. Climate change often reduced biomass, changed 
forest composition, and altered forest structure in many 
forest types by 2100. Using thinning, prescribed burn-
ing, and managed fires, managers aim to reduce the risk 
and spread of high-severity fire by decreasing tree den-
sity and forest fuels. Restoring historical forest structure 
and function can be effective in reducing the potential for 
high-severity fire under contemporary climate conditions 
(Fulé et al. 2012).
The effects of forest management on future fire sever-
ity in the southern Sierra Nevada, CA were modeled 
and found to be an effective tool (Krofcheck et al. 2017a, 
b). Management scenarios that included thinning and 
burning treatments lowered predicted mean fire sever-
ity under climate change relative to the no-manage-
ment scenario under all scenarios modeled. Thinning 
and maintenance burning scenarios had a large reduc-
tion (> 25%) in mean fire severity across the landscape, 
decreasing the portion of the landscape that burned at 
high severity by an order of magnitude compared to no-
management (Krofcheck et  al. 2017b). Thinning alone 
did not reduce fire severity, as shrubs increased the 
continuity of fuels and contributed to increased sever-
ity (Krofcheck et al. 2017b). In a tandem study, thinning 
and burning treatments increased carbon stability and 
reduced fire severity more than no-management in both 
the short (20  years) and long term (100  years) (Krof-
check et al. 2017a). The highest burn severity occurred 
in areas dominated by ponderosa pine and pine-
mixed conifer forests. In a study in the Sierra Nevada 

Page 16 of 22
Wasserman and Mueller ﻿Fire Ecology           (2023) 19:43 
mountains, cumulative area burned by wildland fire was 
consistent across treatment scenarios; however, restora-
tion treatments across the landscape gradually reduced 
the proportion of landscape burned by high-severity fire, 
with an increasingly greater proportion of the landscape 
burned by low-severity surface fires relative to the con-
trol (Liang et al. 2018). In the Tahoe basin, when wild-
land fire intersected fuel treatments, overall fire severity 
was reduced, and consequently, less carbon was volatil-
ized (Loudermilk et al. 2017).
On the Kaibab Plateau in AZ, the projected mean area 
burned at high severity declined when forest restoration 
treatments were applied under all climate scenarios. High 
restoration rate (20-yr prescribed burning rotation) was 
the most beneficial in terms of reducing high-severity 
fire, slowing forest composition change, and reducing 
sediment yield (O’Donnell et  al. 2018). Climate change 
initiated the loss of higher-elevation mixed conifer, aspen, 
and spruce–fir forest types driven by fire mortality and 
regeneration failure. Restoration treatments maintained a 
higher percentage of these species on the landscape and 
mediated the effects of climate-driven changes in vegeta-
tion (O’Donnell et al. 2018). Honig and Fulé (2012) used 
empirical modeling to simulate future fire activity (2070–
2099) with climate change and predicted fire weather in 
southwestern ponderosa pine forests in northern AZ. 
Simulated restoration treatments decreased fire sever-
ity under future climate scenarios, though effectiveness 
varied by treatment. The magnitude of change is more 
strongly influenced by future wind speeds and climate 
effects on vegetation than on altered temperatures and 
fuel moistures alone (Honig and Fulé 2012). A future 
hotter and drier climate increased fire frequency, annual 
area burned, and the probability of high-severity fire in 
the southwestern US (Loehman et al. 2018). More area is 
predicted to burn at high severity in episodic and large 
fire events in the Jemez Mountains, NM (Loehman et al. 
2018). Climate-fire interactions predicted a conversion 
of ponderosa pine forests to shrublands and woodlands 
dominated by oak, pinyon pine, and juniper in the Jemez 
mountains. Thinning and burning treatments did not off-
set climate-driven vegetation reorganizations and were 
only partially effective at reducing fire severity (Loehman 
et  al. 2018). On the Kaibab Plateau, fire regimes were 
more highly influenced by thinning and burning, and 
these treatments decreased the area of high-severity fire 
and forest compositional changes were predicted to be 
minimal (Loehman et al. 2018).
Fuel and restoration treatments demonstrate the 
potential to limit the extent and severity of fire-induced 
mortality along bioclimatic transition zones (i.e., eco-
tones). O’Conner et al. (2020) used FireBGCv2 to exam-
ine the potential for prescribed fuel treatments and 
restoration of historical fire frequencies to mitigate the 
effects of climate on forest species distributions, compo-
sition, total biomass, and fire severity in the Huachuca 
Mountains range in southeastern Arizona under future 
climate (2005–2055). Models showed that fuel treat-
ments reduced the extent of high-severity patches for 
the first two decades, and second-entry treatments at 
year 20 extended these effects for the remaining 30 years 
of simulation. Fuel treatments with follow-up entries 
showed the potential of treatments to mitigate fire sever-
ity effects and tree mortality under projected future con-
ditions and slow the transition from forest to shrubland 
in some vegetation types. However, middle-elevation for-
ests dominated by pine and oak are projected to convert 
to shrublands even in the absence of fire, and upper-ele-
vation pine and mixed conifer forests are expected to lose 
more than a third of their basal area and species diversity 
by mid-century (O’Conner et al. 2020).
Studies of restoration and fuel treatments implemented 
to mitigate fire behavior and the effects on forest carbon 
dynamics showed that management actions are effective 
in reducing the risk of high-severity fire and mitigating 
carbon loss. Krofcheck et al. (2019) used LANDIS II to 
model management scenarios with climate change and 
impacts of carbon and the probability of high-severity 
fire in the Santa Fe Fireshed in New Mexico. Using three 
scenarios (no‐management, prioritized, and optimized) 
and five climate projections for the years 2000–2050, 
mean fire severity was predicted to increase with climate 
change. Mechanical thinning and prescribed burning in 
both management scenarios resulted in reductions in 
carbon losses due to wildland fire. Hurteau (2017) used 
LANDIS II to simulate carbon dynamics under early 
(2010–2019), mid (2050–2059), and late (2090–2099) 
century climate projections for a ponderosa pine forests 
in northern AZ, and the effect of treatments on moder-
ating fire behavior and forest carbon loss. Fire severity 
was consistently higher in the untreated control area, and 
thinning and burning treatments substantially decreased 
mean fire severity. Over the 100-year simulation period, 
32.8–48.9% of the control landscape was either carbon 
neutral or a carbon source to the atmosphere, and more 
than 90% of the treated landscape was a moderate carbon 
sink.
Conclusions and management implications
Climate change is altering fire regimes across western 
forests, and many regions will experience an increase in 
high-severity fire in forested landscapes. The western 
US has experienced an increase in the number of large 
fires, and a larger amount of total annual area burned 
with an increased percentage of area burned at high 
severity. Large patches of high-severity fire have lasting

legacies on vegetation composition and structure, and 
impacts on tree regeneration. Increasing warming and 
drying trends are likely to cause more frequent and 
severe disturbances in many forested ecosystems in the 
near future (Bentz et al. 2010; Abatzoglou and Kolden 
2013; Riley et  al. 2019). Increasing spring and sum-
mer temperatures and earlier spring snowmelt extend 
the length of fire season (Jolly et al. 2015), and increas-
ing trends in area burned by wildland fire are likely to 
continue in many regions throughout the remainder of 
the ­21st century (Westerling 2016). A temporal trend of 
increasing frequency of fire and area burned annually 
with warming climate is likely to continue on the cur-
rent trajectory, and in areas that are warmer and drier, 
fires may continue to be large and burn at high severity 
until they become biomass limited (Parks et al. 2016).
Climate effects on fire regimes vary along climatic 
and resource gradients (Krawchuk and Moritz 2011; 
Parks et  al. 2018b). Future projections suggest that 
northwestern US forests in wetter climates are pre-
dicted to experience an increased fire frequency and 
decreased fire severity, whereas warmer and drier 
regions are likely to show decreased fire frequency and 
increases in fire severity (Parks et al. 2018b). In high-
elevation sub-alpine and boreal systems that may expe-
rience greater temperature and precipitation changes, 
more uncharacteristic severe fire may be prevalent, and 
shifts in vegetation, loss of habitat, and vegetation type 
changes will occur (Guiterman et al. 2022). In arid and 
semiarid ecosystems, projected changes to vapor pres-
sure deficit and temperature regimes are expected to 
significantly increase drought-induced tree mortality, 
alter forest species distributions, and limit tree sizes 
(Allen et al. 2010; Williams et al. 2010, 2013; McDowell 
et al. 2011, 2016). From 1984 to 2012, cooler and wetter 
forested areas such as the Pacific Northwest, Northern 
Rocky Mountains, Southern Rockies have experienced 
more high-severity fire compared to warmer and drier 
regions of Arizona and New Mexico mountains (Parks 
et al. 2016). Recent increases in fire severity are attrib-
uted to changes in climatic water deficit, vapor pressure 
deficit, evapotranspiration, and fuels.
While forests of the western US show a range of adap-
tations to fire, fire activity is likely to exceed the historical 
range of variability observed over the last two centuries 
(Westerling et al. 2011; Kelly et al. 2013; Kitzberger et al. 
2017; Higuera et  al. 2021). Intensifying drought, com-
bined with abundant fuel loads will allow for more high-
severity fire. Alternatively, some models predict increases 
in fire activity and imply that less biomass will be able to 
accumulate between fires, meaning there will be less bio-
mass available to burn on a landscape post fire and over 
time (Parks et  al. 2016). A predicted increase in water 
deficit could result in a decrease in biomass in water-lim-
ited systems (Chen et al. 2010; Williams et al. 2013) caus-
ing a reduction in fire severity.
Climate change and high-severity fire will drive 
changes in forest composition and structure, trigger 
declines in biomass, and increase the probability of type 
change conversions in future forests (Turner 2010; Coop 
et  al. 2020). However, studies modeling the impacts of 
restoration and fuels treatments and their effects on fire 
behavior suggest that management actions can be effec-
tive in reducing the risk of high-severity fire (Krofcheck 
et al. 2017a, 2017b, 2019; Loehman et al. 2018; O’Conner 
et  al. 2020). In some ecosystems and certain weather 
conditions, restoration and fuel treatments may reduce 
the area burned in high-severity fires and reduce conver-
sions from forest to non-forest conditions, thus increas-
ing resistance and resilience to fire events. Thinning and 
prescribed fire treatments can be effective at reducing 
the potential for crown fire, reducing fuels, and pro-
moting forest resilience. However, the efficacy of these 
treatments depends on the extent and intensity of the 
treatment, stochastic weather events, terrain, and forest 
structure and composition. Restoration treatments can 
delay vegetation change, and slow biomass declines due 
to fire-climate interactions and provide opportunities for 
uphill movement of lower-elevation species (O’Donnell 
et  al. 2018). Fuel treatments can mitigate fire severity 
impacts in systems that may become fuel-limited; how-
ever, the pace and scale of implementation is outpaced 
by wildfire activity across western US forest. Restora-
tion and fuel treatments may be less effective in systems 
where the effects of future fire are more heavily influ-
enced by climate variables than by fuels on the landscape 
do (Littell et al. 2009; Loehman et al. 2018).
Climate-induced changes in fire regimes will drive 
changes in fuel loads and fuel moisture conditions, drive 
fire severity, and impact future species composition in 
western US forests (Parks et al. 2016, 2018a, b; Westerling 
2016; Abatzoglou and Williams 2016; Cassell et al. 2019; 
Coop et al. 2020). Forested ecosystems often experience 
lagged responses to climate change or climatic debts 
(Bertrand et  al. 2011; Liang et  al. 2018) which occurs 
when tree species do not completely track changes in 
their climatically suitable environment. This climate-
vegetation disequilibrium makes predicting the timing 
or magnitude of forest community shifts with climate 
change difficult. In addition, some lagged changes in veg-
etation may be driven by stochastic mortality events.
This synthesis may be used to increase the knowledge 
of what the regional and place-based models predict in 
terms of future climate-driven changes in fire severity 
and the associated vegetation changes. Management and 
adaptation strategies are needed to mitigate the effects

of climate-induced extreme fire events in many ecosys-
tems. Addressing fire risk across many regions involves 
fuel reduction and restoration programs, fire risk evalu-
ations, smoke tolerance, funding, work force, and social 
and economic buy-in. Recent research has shown that 
fuel and restoration treatments burned at lower severity 
than untreated controls, and prescribed fire is an effec-
tive treatment to reduce fire severity (Cansler et al. 2022). 
Restoration and fuel treatments may help bridge the gap 
between climate and vegetation lags (Millar et al. 2007; 
Stephens et al. 2010), if the pace and scale of implementa-
tion can increase to meet the pace of wildland fire.
