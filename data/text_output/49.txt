Abstract
Monitoring processes that affect plant population dynamics
and determine community structure is central in forest restora-
tion ecology. To study effects of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus)
and elk (Cervus elaphus) on buckbrush (Ceanothus fendleri
Gray), we built exclosures around 90 plant-centered plots in 3
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) forest restoration man-
agement units and compared vegetative and flowering character-
istics with unprotected plots for 2 years. On unprotected plots,
69% of the current-year branches were browsed during the first
year and 44% were browsed the second year. There was no dif-
ference in number of aerial stems or current-year branches in
the first year, yet stems on protected plots were longer (24.1 cm;
P < 0.01) and retained more than 4 times the current-year bio-
mass (1.4 g stem-1; P < 0.01) than those on unprotected plots (12.9
cm and 0.3 g stem-1, respectively). Stem number, length and
diameter, number of current-year branches, and current-year
biomass on protected plots were all greater (P < 0.01) than on
unprotected plots in the second year. Stems on protected plots
had significantly higher (P < 0.01) length-diameter ratios and
had fewer current-year branches per unit length (P < 0.05) than
unprotected stems. Flowering stems were found on significantly
(P < 0.05) more protected plots (55%) than unprotected plots
(8%) in the second year. Effects of ungulate herbivores on buck-
brush size, stem recruitment, morphology, and flowering repre-
sent important constraints to early understory development and
restoration in this Southwest ponderosa pine forest.

It is widely recognized that large mammalian herbivores,
through selective grazing and physical disturbance to sites, often
play key roles in ecosystems and affect community composition,
structure, and development as well as various ecological processes
(Anderson and Loucks 1979, Naiman 1988, Augustine and
McNaughton 1998). Under episodic or light herbivory, browsed
plants may compensate for tissue loss by increasing production of
biomass or reproductive structures (Paige and Whitham 1987,
Rosenthal and Kotanen 1994, Augustine and McNaughton 1998,
Throop and Fay 1999). Intense herbivory can lead to decreased
stature and reproductive output, regeneration failure, and popula-
tion decline (Strohmeyer and Maschinski 1996, Kay 1997,
Augustine and Frelich 1998, Augustine and McNaughton 1998,
Suzuki et al. 1999, Opperman and Merenlender 2000). Through
direct competition with other herbivores and indirect “knock-on”
effects, large herbivores can affect population dynamics and distri-
bution of other members of the food web (Baines et al. 1994,
Rooney 2001, Stewart 2001). The array of potential ecosystem-
level consequences makes assessment and monitoring of herbivore
impacts particularly important for ecological restoration programs.

Resumen
El monitoreo de procesos que afectan las dinámicas de las
poblaciones de plantas y determinan la estructura de la comu-
nidad es un punto central en ecología de restauración de
bosques. Para estudiar los efectos del “Mule deer” (Odocoileus
hemionus) y el “Alce” (Cervus elaphus) sobre el “Buckbrush”
(Ceanothus fendleri Gray), construimos exclusiones alrededor de
90 parcelas con plantas en el centro ubicadas en 3 unidades de
manejo de restauración de “Pino ponderosa” (Pinus ponderosa
Laws.), y en 2 años comparamos las características vegetativas y
de floración con parcelas sin excluir. En las parcelas sin protec-
ción el 69% de las ramas nuevas producidas en el año fueron
consumidas y el 44% consumidas en el segundo año. No hubo
diferencias en el número de tallos aéreos o ramas nuevas pro-
ducidas en el primer año, pero los tallos en las parcelas protegi-
das fueron mas largos (24.1 cm; P < 0.01) y conservaron 4 veces
más biomasa nueva (1.4 g tallo-1; P < 0.01) que las plantas en las
parcelas sin protección (12.9 cm y 0.3 g tallo-1, respectivamente).
En el segundo año el número de tallos, longitud y diámetro,
número de ramas nuevas y la biomasa nueva fueron mayores en
las parcelas protegidas que en las no protegidas. Los tallos en las
parcelas protegidas tuvieron una relación longitud-diámetro sig-
nificativamente mayor (P < 0.01) y tuvieron menos ramas nuevas
por unidad de longitud (P < 0.05) que los tallos sin protección.
En el segundo año, se encontró una proporción significativa-
mente mayor de parcelas protegidas (55%; P < 0.05) con tallos
florales en comparación con las no protegidas (8%). Los efectos
de los herbívoros ungulados en el tamaño, dinámica de tallos,
morfología y floración del “Buckbrush” representa un impor-
tante restricción para el desarrollo inicial y restauración las
capas bajas de la estructura de este bosque de “Ponderosa pine”
del suroeste.

JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT 56(4) July 2003
An extraordinary increase in tree density
over the last century has led to critical
conservation problems in ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa Laws.) ecosystems of
the southwestern United States (Arnold
1950, Covington and Moore 1994a,
1994b, Kolb et al. 1994, Biondi 1996,
Savage et al. 1996, Fulé et al. 1997, Mast
et al. 1999). Among other effects, dense
forest conditions have reduced forage
abundance and habitat quality for wildlife
that rely on understory vegetation
(Covington and Moore 1994a). In concert
with forest structural changes, Rocky
Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni)
were introduced to the region in the early
1900s to replace the extirpated Merriam’s
elk (C. e. merriami). Numbers of elk have
increased over the last 100 years to around
30,000 animals in Arizona and 40,000-
50,000 animals in New Mexico (Truett
1996). Although restoration treatments
such as thinning small diameter trees and
reintroducing low-intensity surface fires
have been suggested to restore ecological
structure and function to these forests
(Kolb et al. 1994, Covington et al. 1997,
Moore et al. 1999), research on the
impacts of herbivory on plant species’
response to restoration thinning is present-
ly lacking.
Buckbrush (Ceanothus fendleri Gray), is
a semi-evergreen, nitrogen-fixing shrub
common in ponderosa pine forest under-
stories of the Southwest (Story 1974,
Conard et al. 1985). As a shrub species in
primarily herbaceous communities, buck-
brush populations can provide structural
heterogeneity in forest understories and
enhance ecological diversity. Although
buckbrush has been reported as an impor-
tant browse plant for mule deer
(Odocoileus hemionus), and other animals
including elk apparently consume its
leaves, stems, fruit, and seeds (Urness et
al. 1975, Epple 1995, Allen 1996,
Huffman 2002), effects of herbivory on
buckbrush growth and reproduction have
not been studied. Information concerning
intensity of wild ungulate herbivory and
its effects on important understory species
can help land managers interpret trends in
community development and better under-
stand processes constraining restoration of
ecosystems. Our objectives in this study
were to: 1) quantify the effects of large
ungulate herbivory on buckbrush vegeta-
tive characteristics such as size, produc-
tion, and morphology; and 2) examine her-
bivory effects on buckbrush potential
reproduction. 
Methods
Study Site
We conducted our study from 1999–
2000 on the Fort Valley Experimental
Forest (35° 16' N, 111° 41' W) in
Coconino County approximately 10 km
northwest of Flagstaff, Ariz. The area
receives around 52 cm of precipitation
annually with a distinct dry period in May
and June. Precipitation falls in late sum-
mer as rain from monsoonal thunder-
storms and in winter as snow. The study
area was located from 2,225 to 2,380 m
above mean sea level. Aspect was general-
ly southern and the topography was gentle
with average slopes of approximately
5–10%. Soils are classified as Brolliar clay
loams (fine, smectitic, mesic Typic
Argiustolls) developed on tertiary basalt
parent material and are moderately well
drained (Unpublished report, Meurisse). 
Overstory vegetation was nearly pure
ponderosa pine less than 120-years-old
with scattered old-growth trees. Common
understory species included grasses
Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica Vasey),
mountain muhly (Muhlenbergia montana
(Nutt.) A.S. Hitchc.), bottlebrush squir-
reltail (Elymus elymoides (Raf.) Swezey)
and pine dropseed (Blepharoneuron tric-
holepis (Torr.) Nash); forbs lupine
(Lupinus spp.), fleabane (Erigeron spp.),
buckwheat (Eriogonum spp.), yarrow
(Achillea millifolium L.), and pussytoes
(Antennaria spp.); and shrubs buckbrush
and woods rose (Rosa woodsii Lindl.).
Large mammalian herbivores present on
the site included mule deer and elk. Cattle
were excluded from the study site. 
Experimental Design 
In late winter 1998, tree thinning was ini-
tiated on 9 units of 14–16 hectares each on
the study site. The thinning from below
reduced tree density by 80% to approxi-
mately 111–210 trees per hectare, which
were grouped around the spatial locations of
presettlement tree structures (see Covington
et al. 1997 for restoration guidelines). We
selected 3 of these units for our study, each
separated by at least 1 kilometer.
In early spring 1999, we located 60
buckbrush clonal assemblages in each of
the 3 units (180 total). The plots were ran-
domized into either protected or unprotect-
ed treatments. Circular plots, 1 m2, were
established around 1 or more existing
stems and contained 1–25 buckbrush
stems. Buckbrush is rhizomatous and can
expand vegetatively (Vose and White
1987). Sprouting also occurs from a pro-
nounced root crown (Huffman pers. obs.).
Thus, it is not known whether 1 or many
clones produced the aerial stems we sam-
pled. Stem assemblages selected were spa-
tially discrete and generally covered an
area less than 2 m2. Hereafter, we refer to
stem assemblages within plots as “plants”.
Herbivore exclosures 4 m2 in area and 1.4
m in height were constructed around plots
receiving the protection treatment. Mesh
size used for fencing exclosures was 5 x
10 cm. This allowed entry of small mam-
malian and invertebrate herbivores but
excluded large ungulates. 
In each of the 2 study years, we collect-
ed data on flower production and vegeta-
tive characteristics. In June of each year,
we examined stems in all plots for produc-
tion of inflorescences. For stems produc-
ing flowers or flower buds, we measured
total stem length and basal diameter. We
classified stems into 4 relative age groups
according to stem base characteristics as
follows: Class-1) first-year stems, not
suberized, generally supple, gray-green
pubescence at stem base; Class-2) bright
green, not suberized, previous year’s
growth of lateral branches present, gener-
ally lacked pubescence; Class-3) similar to
Class-2 with bark developing in patches at
stem base; Class-4) stem bases dark brown
to black, fully suberized, bark often fur-
rowed. Although we have observed buck-
brush plants on long-term plots at other
sites develop similar characteristics over
time (Moore pers. obs.), we were not able
to confirm actual ages through ring counts
or meristem scars. We also counted num-
ber of inflorescences on flowering stems.
In September, measurements collected for
flowering stems were taken for all stems
on the plots. Additionally, the number of
current-year branches was counted, aver-
age length of current-year branches was
estimated, and longest current-year branch
was measured. 
For all stems, biomass, and leaf area
(LA) of current-year branches were esti-
mated using predictive relationships
developed from separate sampling in the
study units. Forty-five to 50 current-year
stems were collected from clonal assem-
blages outside the experimental plots. For
biomass determination, current-year stems
(n = 50) were measured for length, oven-
dried (70° C for 48 hours), and weighed to
the nearest 0.01 g. For leaf area (LA)
determination, current-year stems (n = 45)
were measured for length and leaves were
removed and analyzed for 1-sided LA by a
video projection system (AgVision™).
The equation to predict current-branch
biomass was: Ln Biomass = -4.919 +
1.395(Ln Branch Length) (r2 = 0.94, P <

360
JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT 56(4) July 2003
0.001) (Fig. 1a). The equation to predict
current-branch LA was: Ln LA = 0.663 +
0.827(Ln Branch Length) (r2 = 0.91, P <
0.001) (Fig. 1b). 
Data Analyses
One-way 
analysis 
of 
variance
(ANOVA) was used to test for effects of
protection on vegetative characteristics of
buckbrush plants within study years (1999
and 2000). Overstory unit was included in
the ANOVA model as a blocking factor.
Paired t-tests were used to test (P < 0.10)
between-year differences in vegetative
parameters within treatment (protected
and unprotected) groups. Data for individ-
ual stems (i.e., length, number of current-
year branches, length of current-year
branches, biomass and leaf area per stem)
were averaged at the plot level and analy-
ses were performed on these values.
Additionally, stem diameter, current year
biomass, and current-year leaf area were
summed at the plot level and analyzed for
treatment differences. Morphological
characteristics tested were stem height-
diameter ratio and branchiness. Branch-
iness was calculated as the number of cur-
rent-year branches divided by stem length.
Data met distribution and variance
assumptions for ANOVA tests and were
not transformed. In April 2000, 24 of the
plots were burned as part of another exper-
iment. These plots were excluded from
analysis in year 2000. 
A Mantel-Haenszel test was used to
compare (P < 0.05) proportions of unpro-
tected and protected plots with flower-pro-
ducing stems. Mann-Whitney nonparamet-
ric tests were used to analyze (P < 0.05)
differences in stem and current-branch
number between treatments.
Results
Plant Size and Current-Year
Biomass
Analysis of pretreatment data indicated
no difference in stem length or number of
stems between treatments. Stem length
averaged 7.6 cm (SE = 0.30) and number
of stems per plot averaged 4.9 (SE =
0.31). 
By the end of the first growing season
(1999), 69% of the current-year branches
on unprotected plots had been browsed.
Two percent of the new branches inside
exclosures had terminal buds removed
apparently by invertebrates. We did not
observe signs of small rodent herbivory
inside exclosures although mesh size per-
mitted rodent access. Herbivory on unpro-
tected plants appeared consistent with
browsing from large ungulates; current-
year branches were nipped roughly, often
near their bases, and we did not find dis-
carded shoots or leaves that might suggest
herbivory by rodents (Bullock 1991,
Balgooyen and Waller 1995). In addition,
deer and elk were frequently observed on
the study site and their tracks and scat
were noted near experimental plots. 
One growing season after installing the
herbivore exclosures, plant size was sig-
nificantly different between protected and
unprotected treatments. Stem and current-
year branch lengths of protected plants
were from 1.9 to 2.8-fold greater than
those of unprotected plants (Table 1).
Average stem diameter was also greater
for protected plants than unprotected
plants. Differences in current-year branch
lengths between protected and unprotected
plots translated directly to differences in
biomass and leaf area (Table 1). Individual
stems on protected plots retained more
current-year biomass by a factor of 4.7,
and leaf area by a factor of 2.5, compared
to stems on unprotected plots. No differ-
ence was found in average number of
stems on plots or the number of new
branches produced by stems on protected
and unprotected plots in 1999. All stems
produced an average of 5.3 (SE = 0.2) new
branches during the first growing season.   
In 2000, growing season precipitation
(20.4 cm; March–September) was about
66% of the 91-year average (31.0 cm;
Western Regional Climate Center 2000)
and both protected and unprotected buck-
brush plants showed varying degrees of
stem dieback. Forty-four percent of cur-
rent-year branches were browsed on
unprotected plots. Average total stem
length on protected plots increased (P =
0.05) slightly from the previous year and

mass (A) and leaf area (B) of current-year

was significantly greater than that of
unprotected plots, which decreased (P =
0.06) (Table 1). Similarly, average stem
diameter was greater on protected plots
than unprotected plots. Although current-
year branch lengths on both protected and
unprotected plots decreased (P < 0.001 for
both treatments) in 2000 from 1999 val-
ues, number of current-year branches
increased (P < 0.001 and P = 0.003 for
protected and unprotected plots, respec-
tively). Average number of current-year
branches produced by stems on protected
plots nearly tripled from 1999 and was
significantly greater than the number pro-
duced by stems on unprotected plots
(Table 1). Both average length and length
of the longest current-year branch were
greater on protected plots than unprotected
plots by a factor of 2 or greater. Individual
stems on protected plots comprised signif-
icantly more current-year biomass than
stems on unprotected plots by a factor of 8
(Table 1). Large differences also existed
between protected and unprotected stems
for current-year leaf area. 
Average number of stems did not
change significantly (P = 0.31) from 1999
to 2000 on protected plots, but decreased
on unprotected plots (P = 0.002). More
stems of larger average diameter led to
significantly greater sum stem diameter
(sum of all stems on a plot) on protected
plots in 2000 (Table 1). Similarly, sum
current-year biomass on protected plots in
2000 did not change from 1999 (P = 0.81),
whereas biomass decreased significantly
(P < 0.001) on unprotected plots. In 2000,
current-year biomass summed on protect-
ed plots was greater than that on unpro-
tected plots by a factor of 12 (Table 1).
Similar patterns existed between protected
and unprotected plots for sum current-year
leaf area (Table 1). Sum leaf area signifi-
cantly increased (P = 0.014) from 1999 to
2000 on protected plots but decreased (P <
0.001) on unprotected plots.
Stem Morphology
Herbivory of current-year branches on
buckbrush stems led to noticeable differ-
ences in stem morphology. Stem height-
diameter ratios were significantly greater
for plants on protected plots than for those
on unprotected plots (Table 2). Stems
within herbivore exclosures typically
appeared long and drooping whereas
stems exposed to herbivores were most
often short and stubby in appearance.
Although protected plants produced more
current-year branches than unprotected
plants in 2000, the number of branches
relative to stem length was significantly
greater for stems on unprotected plants in
both 1999 and 2000 (Table 2). 
Flower Production
In June 1999, three months after exclo-
sures were established, no difference in
flower production was found between pro-
tected and unprotected buckbrush plots.
Stems produced flowers on just 2 of 180
total plots (1.1% overall).
In June 2000, flowering stems were
found in a significantly greater proportion
of protected plots (55%) than unprotected
plots (8%). On average, 22% (SE = 3.6) of
stems on protected plots produced flowers
whereas 0.8% (SE = 0.4) of stems pro-
duced flowers on unprotected plots. In
protected plots, up to 11 (maximum) stems
produced flowers whereas no more than 1
stem flowered in any unprotected plot.
Stems (all pooled) that produced flowers
tended to be larger and apparently older
individuals (Fig. 2). No stems under 20 cm
in length produced flowers and 85% of the
flowering stems were greater than 30 cm
in length. Similarly, 82% of the flowering
stems were greater than 4 mm in diameter.
No current-year stems flowered and more
than 90% of the flowering stems had
suberized bases (age classes 3 and 4). The
mean number of inflorescences (panicles)
produced per flowering stem was 7.3.
Inflorescences were comprised of many
individual flowers although these were not
counted. An average of 2 branches per
stem flowered; the maximum number of
flowering branches was 9 per stem. 
Discussion
Mule deer and Rocky Mountain elk
appeared to be the primary large herbi-
vores of buckbrush and caused significant
reduction of current-year biomass in both
study years. Plants that were not protected
from large herbivores had small, branchy
stems, decreased aerial stem survival, and
limited flowering compared with protected
plants. Reduced flowering and stem sur-
vival could in turn lead to declines in local
buckbrush abundance, affect community
successional dynamics, and have indirect
effects on other ecosystem components
(Baines et al. 1994, Augustine and Frelich
1998). It is clear that herbivory by deer
and elk is limiting development of under-
story structure. We did not examine inter-
actions of herbivory and low-intensity fire,
although prescribed burning is an impor-
tant component of Southwest ponderosa
pine restoration programs (Covington et al.
1997). Fire often leads to increases in veg-
etative and sexual regeneration through
sprout production and seed germination,
however, it can also increase palatability of

plant tissues and create conditions that
attract herbivores (Whelan 1995). Our
results indicate that deer and elk herbivory
after forest thinning should be considered
an important constraint to the ecological
restoration of these ecosystems.
Intensity of deer and elk herbivory on
buckbrush and other species varies with
season, site conditions, and ungulate popu-
lation characteristics (Reynolds 1962,
Patton 1974, Urness et al. 1975, Furniss et
al. 1978, Allen 1996, Throop and Fay
1999). For example, Urness et al. (1975)
found that buckbrush comprised up to
6.9% of mule deer summer diet and was a
consistently important browse species
throughout the year at Beaver Creek, a site
located around 55 km south of ours. Other
woody species preferred by mule deer at
Beaver Creek were Gambel oak (Quercus
gambelii Nutt.), mountain mahogany
(Cercocarpus breviflorus Gray), and Utah
serviceberry (Amelanchier utahensis
Koehne). These species are not commonly
found on our study site and thus prefer-
ence for buckbrush may be greater at Fort
Valley than that reported by Urness et al.
(1975). Allen (1996) noted severe brows-
ing of buckbrush 15 years after an exten-
sive wildfire in New Mexico and related
intensity of herbivory to a dramatic elk
population increase. Patton (1974) found
that mule deer use increased in ponderosa
pine forests after overstory thinning. Thus,
deer and elk may have been attracted to
the open conditions created by forest thin-
ning treatments in our study. 
Under conditions that stimulate flower
production or enhance plant growth, her-
bivory may positively contribute to eco-
logical restoration goals by providing
resource richness and abundance for vari-
ous organisms in the food web and
enhancing ecosystem function (Jackson et
al. 1995). Paige and Whitham (1987)
reported increased flower production after
experimental clipping as well as natural
herbivory by deer and elk for a northern
Arizona forb, scarlet gilia (Ipomopsis
aggregata (Pursh) V. Grant). Similarly,
Throop and Fay (1999) found that
browsed New Jersey tea (Ceanothus
herbaceous Raf. var. pubescens (T. & G.)
Shinners) produced a greater number of
inflorescences than unbrowsed plants on a
tallgrass prairie site. In contrast, Stein et
al. (1992) noted that elk completely con-
sumed arroyo willow (Salix lasiolepis
Benth.) resprouts after experimental burn-
ing in northern Arizona. Similarly,
Strohmeyer and Maschinski (1996) report-
ed both wild and domestic herbivores
reduced total shoot length and number of
branches of Arizona willow (Salix arizoni-
ca Dorn). Intense deer and elk herbivory
can limit production of flowers, seeds, and
vegetative regeneration of various plant
species in other western ecosystems
(DeByle 1985, Dunlap 1988, Mitchell and
Freeman 1993, Hoffman and Wambolt
1996, Kay 1997, Opperman and
Merenlender 2000). In our study, buck-
brush flowers were observed on less than
10% of the unprotected plots. Limiting
flower production may affect populations
of species dependent on the reproductive
structures of buckbrush (Huffman 2002).
This suggests that ungulate herbivory can
affect diversity and composition of inver-
tebrate communities through direct com-
petition for resources and “knock-on”
effects occurring from changes in micro-
climate or predator-prey relationships
(Baines et al. 1994, Rambo and Faeth
1999, Rooney 2001, Stewart 2001). 
Further research is needed to explore
the roles of wild ungulate herbivory in
conservation and ecological restoration of
Southwest ponderosa pine ecosystems.
Current understanding of presettlement
conditions—attributes that provide base-
lines to guide ecological restoration – is
greatest for overstory characteristics and
fire regimes (Covington and Moore 1994a,
Covington et al. 1997, Fulé et al. 1997,
Mast et al. 1999). Little is known regard-
ing presettlement population dynamics
and spatial distribution of large herbivores
or the range of historical variability for
their effects in Southwest forest ecosys-
tems. On some landscapes, including that
of our study area, elk are thought to be
more abundant and distributed more even-
ly than they were for possibly the last 800
years (Allen 1996, Truett 1996, Kay
1997). Indeed, ungulate herbivory in com-
bination with forest structural changes
appears to be exacerbating conservation
problems in these ecosystems. For ecolog-
ical restoration activities that seek to
reestablish ecosystem integrity and func-
tion, it is important to understand evolu-
tionary environments of native species and
emulate historical conditions of landscape-
scale processes that include herbivory by
large, wild ungulates.
