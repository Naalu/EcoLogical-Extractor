ABSTRACT
Midwest oak savanna communities are noted for their unusual plant assemblages, but these com-
munities have been reduced by more than 98% because of changing land uses and conversion to
closed-canopy forests. We initiated an ongoing 15-year experiment in 1988 to restore a 40-ha black
oak (Quercus velutina) savanna by applying burn treatments that historically maintained this vegeta-
tion type. Groundlayer composition changed significantly for both the burn treatment and the con-
trol, with the burn treatment exhibiting slight increases in herbs such as wild lupine (Lupinus peren-
nis) and hairy puccoon (Lithospermum caroliniense), both of which are species requiring greater
insolation. Burn treatments differentially affected different plant community characteristics during
the 15-year period, with some characteristics such as sapling density decreasing and other character-
istics like species richness remaining comparatively unchanged. Oak overstory density was not af-
fected by burn treatments, and reductions in oak density of 33-50% are needed for consistency with
presettlement savanna structure to enhance the diversity of sunny and shady microsites characteris-
tic of oak savannas. Results support the continuation of experimental restoration treatments in this
savanna, and indicate further research is needed to clarify long-term patterns of temporal change in
oak savanna vegetation.
INTRODUCTION
Oak savanna communities historically covered more than 11 million hectares
in the midwestern United States (Nuzzo 1986). These fire-, drought-, or edaphic-
maintained communities consisted of scattered oak canopies, brushy or open un-
derstories, and diverse groundlayers of both prairie and forest species (Bray
1960; Heikens & Robertson 1994; Leach & Givnish 1999). By 1985, changing
land-uses and fire suppression had reduced oak savanna to 0.02% of its preset-
tlement extent in the Midwest (Nuzzo 1986). Despite the sharp decline in the
areal extent and quality of oak savannas, regions supporting oak savannas still
contain notable plant diversity. For example, Leach & Givnish (1999) surveyed
22 savanna remnants (42 ha total) in southern Wisconsin and found that the rem-
nants supported 507 native plant species (~ 27% of Wisconsin’s native flora).
Because of their unique floral assemblages and current rareness, there has been

increasing interest since the 1980s in restoring oak savannas to the Midwest
landscape (White 1983; Anderson 1998; Jones 2000). 
Since 1988, the Toledo Area Metroparks have been using experimental treat-
ments to restore oak savannas in Oak Openings Preserve, within the Oak Open-
ings region in northwest Ohio (Abella et al. 2001). The Oak Openings region oc-
cupies glacial lakeplain sands, and based on presettlement land survey records
historically consisted of a mosaic of 44% oak savanna (4–43 trees ha–1), 23%
oak woodland (> 43 trees ha–1), 7% oak barrens (1-3 trees ha–1), and 27% wet
prairie (< 1 tree ha–1; Brewer & Vankat 2001). Oak savannas in this region not
converted to other land uses became closed-canopy forests through the 1900s be-
cause of fire suppression, resulting in declines in ground-flora diversity (Abella
et al. 2001). Restoration treatments by the Metroparks have entailed reducing
canopy cover and sapling densities and reinstating disturbance regimes, such as
fire, that historically maintained oak savanna plant communities (Nuzzo 1986).
Despite the historic widespread distribution and floral diversity of oak savannas,
there are few long-term data available on the temporal dynamics of savanna veg-
etation. 
We have been studying the community dynamics of Mary’s Savanna, a 40-ha
black oak savanna in Oak Openings Preserve, during an ongoing 15-year
restoration experiment initiated in 1988 (Brewer & Grigore 1993). This savanna,
similar to other savannas across the Midwest (Nuzzo 1986), had become closed-
canopy forest and lacked savanna structure before restoration. Prescribed burn
treatments have been applied to 30 ha of this savanna since 1988 with a goal of
achieving a community structure resembling that of a presettlement savanna in
this region, while 10 ha of the savanna have served as a control. This study was
undertaken in Mary’s Savanna to document plant community dynamics over a
15-year period to better understand temporal changes of savanna vegetation and
plant responses to reintroductions of disturbance regimes that historically main-
tained this vegetation type.
METHODS
Mary’s Savanna is located in the southern section of Oak Openings Preserve (41°32′15″N,
83°51′00″W), western Lucas County, northwestern Ohio (Fig. 1). Soils in the savanna are mapped as
mixed, mesic Aquic and Typic Udipsamments of the Ottokee and Oakville series (Stone et al. 1980).
The mapped series were confirmed in 1988 by sampling soils at five locations in Mary’s Savanna and
comparing the soil characteristics to series descriptions in the soil survey (Stone et al. 1980). Based
on increment cores collected from five dominant oaks, Mary’s Savanna established about 1900, pos-
sibly following farm abandonment or cessation of livestock grazing (Moseley 1928). In 1821, the
area supported oak savanna according to government land survey records (Brewer & Vankat 2001). 
Five permanent 0.05-ha plots (20 m × 25 m) were established in Mary’s Savanna in 1988 fol-
lowing methods documented in Brewer & Grigore (1993). Three plots were established in the burn
treatment, and two plots were established in the control. Pre-treatment data were collected in 1988,
and the plots were re-sampled at 1–4 year intervals in 1988, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1997–2000, and 2002.
Burn treatments were applied at 1–4 year intervals in the following years and months: 1988 (No-
vember), 1989 (April), 1990 (April), 1993-1994 (November), 1997 (March), 1998 (November), and
2001 (November). Relative humidities at ignition times ranged from 32–72%, with winds typically
< 16 km/hr out of the south. 
On each plot, we determined the species and measured the diameter to the nearest cm at 1.37 m
for each tree greater than 1 cm diameter. We determined average percent canopy cover using a den-
118

sitometer (Geographic Resource Solutions, Arcata, CA), based on measurements to the nearest 5%
cover at eight locations at 5-m intervals along the plot diagonal. In six 1-m2 subplots located at the
plot corners and at the centers of the long plot axes, we categorized the areal percent cover of vas-
cular plant species at 1% intervals up to 5% cover and then at 5% intervals for cover greater than 5%.
We surveyed the entire 0.05-ha plot for species not occurring in subplots and categorized the percent
cover of these species on a plot basis. In 2002, we increased the number of subplots per plot to 15 to
refine plant frequency estimates. Plants not readily identifiable in the field were collected, pressed,
and when possible identified to species. Nomenclature follows Voss (1972; 1985; 1996). We mea-
sured the thickness of the Oi and Oe+a soil horizons (Soil Survey Division Staff 1993), hypothesized
to decrease following burn treatments, by excavating the layers with a 20-cm long handshovel at six
locations along the perimeter of each plot.

gion of northwestern Ohio. 

To test the null hypothesis of no change in plant community characteristics between pre- (1988)
and post-treatment (2002) within the burn and control treatments, we compared mean black oak
basal area, species richness, Shannon’s diversity index (H′; McCune & Mefford 1999), and thickness
of the Oi and Oe+a horizons between years for each treatment using two-tailed paired t-tests. We
evaluated the null hypothesis of no change in groundlayer composition between pre- and post-treat-
ment for each treatment using blocked multi-response permutation procedure tests in the software
PC-ORD (McCune & Mefford 1999). Multi-response permutation procedures are multivariate, non-
parametric tests that evaluate the null hypothesis of no difference in species composition between
groups using a randomization procedure (Zimmerman et al. 1985). We used the blocked test (Eu-
clidean distance and medians aligned) variation of multi-response permutation procedures to accom-
modate our paired-sample data (McCune & Mefford 1999). The data matrix consisted of mean per-
cent cover of each species, and data for each plot were relativized by the maximum species percent
cover for that plot (McCune & Mefford 1999).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Black oak comprised 21.9 ± 1.1 (mean ± 1 standard deviation) m2 ha–1 basal
area (94% relative basal area) in the burn treatment post-treatment in 2002,
which was not significantly different (t = 0.69, P = 0.56) from 20.3 ± 3.1 m2 ha–1
basal area (95% relative basal area) pre-treatment in 1988. Mean black oak basal
area for the control also did not differ (t = –2.76, P = 0.56) between 2002 (18.0
± 10.4 m2 ha–1; 93% relative basal area) and 1988 (21.5 ± 8.6; 95% relative basal
area). Densities of overstory black oak (> 20 cm diameter) also did not change
for either treatment (Fig. 2). Burn treatments in this savanna have not affected
basal area or densities of overstory black oak presumably because of the thick
bark of this species (Easterly 1969). These results are consistent with those of
White (1983), who found that 13 years of annual burns did not decrease over-
story oak density in a Minnesota savanna. 
Burn treatments, however, have drastically changed the community structure
of Mary’s Savanna during the 15-year period by eliminating small-diameter trees
(Fig. 2). In contrast, post-treatment density in the 1–5 cm diameter class of black
cherry (Prunus serotina) and sassafras (Sassafras albidum) exceeded 500 trees
ha–1 in control plots (Fig. 2). These densities are similar to those reported by
Larch & Sakai (1985) for minimally disturbed oak stands of southeastern Michi-
gan. Post-treatment community structure of the control includes several layers of
large and small trees, while community structure of the burn treatment is two-
layered and consists of a canopy and a groundlayer (Fig. 3). The relatively open
understory structure of the burn treatment resembles descriptions of some pre-
setttlement savannas in this region, although overstory oak densities are cur-
rently about twice as high as was typical of area presettlement savannas (Brewer
& Vankat 2001). 
Post-treatment groundlayers in both the burn and control plots are dominated
by bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum), Pennsylvania sedge (Carex pensylvan-
ica), shrubs such as hillside blueberry (Vaccinium pallidum), and seedlings of
black oak and other species (Table 1). Forbs like cinquefoil (Potentilla simplex),
frostweed (Helianthemum bicknellii), flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata),
and wild lupine (Lupinus perennis) are present in the burn treatment but at rela-
tively low frequencies (Table 1). Blocked multi-response permutation procedure

tests of pre- (1988) and post-treatment (2002) groundlayer composition within
treatments indicated composition was weakly, but significantly different for both
the burn (T = –2.74, P = 0.02) and control (T = –2.62, P = 0.02) treatments.
However, causes for the compositional differences were disparate between treat-
ments. Burn plots exhibited new occurrences or increases in percent cover of
species requiring greater insolation such as wild lupine (33% plot occurrence in-
crease and seven-fold increase in mean percent cover), while control plots ex-
hibited decreases of species requiring greater insolation like hairy puccoon
(Lithospermum caroliniense; 100% plot occurrence reduction) and increases of
woody vegetation such as sassafras (4% mean cover increase) tolerant of shade
(Larch & Sakai 1985). Based on the relatively small blocked multi-response
permutation procedure T-statistic (McCune & Mefford 1999), however, burn

P = 0.86). No significant change in species diversity during the 15-year period
associated with burn treatments in Mary’s Savanna is consistent with the short-
term (3-year) findings in other savannas without overstory reduction treatments
in the Oak Openings region (Abella et al. 2001). These results suggest that the
disturbance of burning alone is insufficient to significantly alter patterns of
groundlayer diversity in Oak Openings savannas that had previously succeeded
to closed-canopy forest as had Mary’s Savanna. 
Burn treatments reduced Oi horizon thickness by 4.7 cm, whereas thickness
of the Oe+a horizon did not change significantly (Fig. 5). Many herbs of oak sa-
vannas, such as hairy puccoon, germinate and emerge most successfully on ex-
posed mineral soil (Weller 1985). The relatively thick Oe+a horizon in Mary’s
Savanna may preclude the establishment of these savanna herbs (Facelli & Pick-
ett 1991). Phillips et al. (2000) found that the Oe+a horizon remained 1.5 cm
thick in a Tennessee oak stand after 35 years of burn treatments, and this study
combined with our findings suggest that long-term burning in Mary’s Savanna
will not result in our hypothesized reduction in Oe+a horizon thickness. It is un-
clear if the 90-year period of fire suppression during which Mary’s Savanna de-
veloped has resulted in an unusually thick Oe+a horizon not able to be readily
reduced by burning, or if despite reductions in the Oi horizon annual inputs of
plant litter exceeded levels consumed by the burn treatments. 
During the 15-year duration of this study, some community characteristics of
the burn treatment of Mary’s Savanna have remained relatively constant, while
other characteristics have changed considerably (Figure 6). Mean cover of
bracken fern doubled to 25% in the first two growing seasons following the ini-

tial 1988 burn treatment (Brewer & Grigore 1993), and then declined but re-
mained above pre-treatment levels in 2002 (Fig. 6). Sapling density decreased
sharply after the first burn treatment in 1988, recovered by 1993 after a four-year
period without burning, and remained low for the rest of the study. In compari-
son, groundlayer species richness and overstory oak density varied little (Fig. 6).
Results indicate that experimental burn treatments have differentially affected
different community characteristics over the 15-year period, and demonstrate the
utility of long-term permanent plot studies for directly detecting temporal
changes of savanna vegetation. 
Additional experimental treatments are needed to continue restoring historic
vegetation composition and structure to Mary’s Savanna (Brewer & Vankat
2001). Burn treatments could be continued at irregular intervals not more fre-
quent than every two years to balance positive and negative effects of fire on dif-
ferent plant species (Grigore & Tramer 1996). Overstory oak density in Mary’s
Savanna presently is high (Fig. 2), and a reduction in density of 33–50% is nec-
essary to approach the upper density of 43 trees ha–1 documented for historical
savannas in this region (Brewer & Vankat 2001). This density reduction could
decrease the current average canopy cover of 55 ± 4% in the burn treatment, pos-
sibly alleviating light limitations for the establishment of such herbs as wild
lupine (Grigore & Tramer 1996), while enhancing the diversity of sunny and
shady microsites characteristic of oak savannas (Leach & Givnish 1999). Higher
light levels may also decrease the current dominance of bracken fern, a species
susceptible to killing frosts in more open savanna structures (Cody & Crompton

1975). Results of this study support the continuation of experimental plant com-
munity restoration treatments by the Toledo Metroparks, and indicate further re-
search is needed to clarify long-term patterns of temporal change in oak savan-
nas, once a dominant vegetation type of the midwestern landscape.
