Collaboration Indicator: Summary of findings for the 
Northern Blues All-Lands Restoration Partnership
The Southwest Ecological Restoration Institutes (SWERI) 
developed a collaboration indicator as part of the Collaborative 
Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) Common 
Monitoring Strategy. The collaboration indicator was designed to 
evaluate collaborative health, function, resilience, and perceived 
outcomes of collaborative work. The SWERI administered an 
online questionnaire to members of the Northern Blues All-Lands 
Restoration Partnership (henceforth the Partnership) in Fall 2021, 
the first year of the Partnership. We received 37 usable responses 
(30% response rate). Figure 1 illustrates what groups were 
represented in the questionnaire. The purpose of this brief is to:
•	 summarize high-level findings from the collaboration indicator 
assessment; and
•	 document 
participants’ 
recommendations 
to 
improve 
collaborative performance and progress.
Findings
Engaging the right people 
Most respondents agreed that a 
representative 
cross-section 
of 
stakeholders was involved in the 
project. A minority indicated that 
some groups and interests were 
underrepresented. 
Participants 
suggested the Partnership could 
be more inclusive of tribes, 
conservation and environmental 
groups, county governments, and 
district staff. Moving forward, the 
Partnership will clarify who they 
are and the goals and objectives 
of 
the 
Partnership 
in 
their 
communications.
Align expectations and clarify capacity for engagement throughout the process
All participants have their own expectations and capacities for collaborative engagement; collaborative engagement 
opportunities must be tailored accordingly. Respondents expected more collaboration between the US Forest Service, 
other state, local, private, and tribal partners, and the Partnership during planning and implementation.  Specifically, they 
suggested the need to: 
•	 develop a cross-boundary collaborative prioritization process and products (e.g., priority maps) for treatment planning; 
•	 co-develop zones of agreement and a vision for restoration; 
•	 develop a clear decision-making process between the Partnership and the Leadership Team; 
•	 clarify expectations from partners on how implementation will be accomplished across boundaries and within the 
CFLRP; and
•	 periodically reassess expectations and progress of the Partnership.

Trust, relationships, 
and commitment
Respondents indicated that building trust 
and relationships was a primary motivator 
for their engagement in the Partnership, and 
a majority indicated the collaborative process 
has fostered trust- and relationship-building, 
as well as mutual respect of others’ positions 
(Figure 2).
Social learning and 
adaptive management
Social learning can reduce conflict, increase 
understanding, 
and 
build 
trust. 
Most 
respondents indicated the Partnership has 
supported co-generation of knowledge to 
solve problems and provided equal access 
to knowledge and information. Less agreed 
the current collaborative process supported 
adaptive 
management. 
Participants 
recommended the Partnership work to:
•	 co-identify desired conditions and 
thresholds for adaptive management;
•	 develop a collaborative adaptive 
management process;
•	 continue opportunities for 
sharing monitoring results (e.g., 
field trips, story maps); and
•	 consider monitoring protocols 
for (e.g., to learn from wildfire) 
unplanned disturbances.
Resources
A majority of respondents agreed the 
Partnership had adequate access to funds, 
knowledge and expertise, and facilitation 
skills (Figure 3). Less agreed that the group 
had adequate access to people and time to 
accomplish their work. This finding aligns 
with other forest collaboratives. Often a core group of doers, many of whom are volunteers, are asked to carry out 
multiple tasks. While some groups function better with a small group of doers, relying on a few individuals may leave 
groups vulnerable to turnover, which can erode trust and diminish institutional knowledge.  
Perceived outcomes
Respondents reported progress on collaborative process, socio-economic, and ecological outcomes, including: 
•	 improved communication, enhanced landscape planning, and improved cross boundary planning (Figure 4); and 
•	 reduced fuel hazards and improved habitat.

Next steps
This assessment will be readministered every 2-3 years to track collaboration across projects and over time, with the 
goal of identifying where capacities lie and areas for improvement to target investments and activities accordingly.
