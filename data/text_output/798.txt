Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa C. Lawson
var. scopulorum Engelm.) forests of the Ameri-
can Southwest are increasingly recognized to
be at risk of wildfire, insect outbreaks, and other
disturbances (Covington and Moore 1994, Allen
et al. 2002). These risks have stimulated much
research about the woody overstory vegetation.
Much less attention has been focused on the
herbaceous understory vegetation (Arnold 1950,
Milchunas 2006, Bakker and Moore 2007).
However, the understory stratum contains most
of the plant diversity in these ecosystems and
provides food and habitat for many wildlife
species. Conservation of ponderosa pine–bunch-
grass ecosystems, therefore, requires a careful
assessment of the factors affecting the under-
story. In these forests, 2 notable factors are
livestock grazing and increased dominance by
overstory trees during the 20th century (Moore
and Deiter 1992, Fleischner 1994, Laughlin et
al. 2006, Moore et al. 2006).
Livestock grazing is common in the west-
ern United States, where approximately 70%
of the area is used for livestock production
(Fleischner 1994). Quantifying the effects of
livestock grazing can be difficult due to the
sparsity of ungrazed control areas, though
livestock exclosures provide one way to do so
(Courtois et al. 2004, Loeser et al. 2004).
Unlike relict areas, where geographic features
prevent livestock access, exclosures can be
established experimentally in areas that are
accessible to livestock and therefore have
comparable land-use histories (Bakker and
Moore 2007).
Fire suppression resulted in dramatic in -
creases in the overstory within southwestern
ponderosa pine forests during the early to
mid-20th century (Cooper 1960). Negative
overstory–understory correlations have been
recognized by range scientists for decades
(Arnold 1950, Moore and Deiter 1992) but
have generally not been explicitly accounted
for in the modeling of understory dynamics in
these forests (Bakker 2005). However, infor-
mation on overstory–understory relationships
can be of critical importance for predicting
understory response to overstory reductions

EFFECTS OF LONG-TERM LIVESTOCK GRAZING AND HABITAT 
ON UNDERSTORY VEGETATION
Jonathan D. Bakker1, Faith Rudebusch2, and Margaret M. Moore3
ABSTRACT.—The herbaceous understory stratum contains most of the plant diversity in ponderosa pine (Pinus pon-
derosa P. & C. Lawson var. scopulorum Engelm.) forests of the American Southwest and provides critical food and habitat
for many wildlife species. During the last century, this stratum has been affected by livestock grazing and by increased
dominance of overstory trees. We sampled a unique grazing exclosure to examine the relative importance of long-term
livestock grazing (grazed or ungrazed) and habitat (park or tree) on the understory community. We sampled 3 plots of
192 contiguous quadrats (each quadrat 0.5 m2) in each of the 4 treatment combinations, for a total of 2304 quadrats.
Species-area curves were generated by aggregating quadrats into nonoverlapping areas at grain sizes of 0.5 to 576 m2.
The effects of habitat and grazing on species density were evident at very different scales. Species density was higher in
park than tree plots at scales ≤32 m2 but did not differ between habitats at larger scales. Species density differed mini-
mally between grazed and ungrazed treatments at small grains, but grazed plots contained more species than ungrazed
plots at larger grains. Grazing treatments differed at smaller grains (to 4–8 m2) than did habitats (to 32 m2), with respect
to density of native species and graminoids. Grazed plots had more exotic species than ungrazed plots at all grain sizes,
though few exotics were present. Twenty-two species were identified as indicator species associated with habitats and/or
grazing treatments. Evaluations of plant community response to treatments would be improved by accounting for the
grain at which data have been collected and analyzed and by identifying indicator species associated with various treat-
ments. These data would enable more-informed conservation and management decisions.

and other management activities (Moore et al.
2006, Bakker and Moore 2007).
In this study, our objective was to examine
the relative importance of livestock grazing
(ongoing livestock grazing or long-term [93-year]
protection from grazing) and habitat (park [mon-
tane grassland] or tree [forest]) to herbaceous
understory in ponderosa pine forests. Because
the conclusions of a study can be affected by the
choice of response variable (Laughlin et al. 2006)
and the spatial scale at which analyses occur
(Condit et al. 1996, Colwell et al. 2004), we fo -
cused on aerial cover and species density (the
number of species per sample unit; Gotelli and
Colwell 2001) at various grain sizes. However,
these variables ignore compositional differences
that may be important in explaining differ-
ences among treatments, so we also identified
individual species that were indicative of the
treatments (Bakker 2008).
METHODS
Study Area
In 1912, livestock grazing exclosures were
established at 5 sites in northern Arizona. Col-
lectively, these sites are known as the Hill plots
(Arnold 1950, Baker and Moore 2007). Our high
sampling intensity and logistic constraints re -
quired that we focus on a single site, Fry Park.
Fry Park is 20 km southwest of Flagstaff, Arizona
(35°4N, 111°47W) at 2170 m elevation. Its ex -
closure is 0.8 ha (55 × 143 m) and spans the
ecotonal boundary between the park and tree
habitats (Fig. 1). This ecotone appears to have
been fairly stable over the last century (data not
shown). Key reasons for its maintenance may in-
clude climatic conditions (cold-air drainage into
parks) and fine-textured soils (Coop and Givnish
2007).
Our study was conducted within and im -
mediately adjacent to the livestock exclosure at
Fry Park. We acknowledge that this study is
therefore pseudoreplicated (Hurlbert 1984),
though the resulting data are still worthy of con-
sideration (Oksanen 2001). Hargrove and Pick-
ering (1992:251) note that “there is conflict
between the need to replicate and the need to
study processes at appropriately large scales.”
We would add that this conflict also affects de -
cisions about sampling intensity. Furthermore,
studies of individual exclosures like ours can pro-
vide valuable data for future meta-analyses. Ex -
amples of comparable single-site studies include
Oesterheld and Sala (1990), Carmel and Kadmon
(1999), Green et al. (2003), and Ruthven (2007).

Fig. 1. Location of the Fry Park exclosure, showing the tree and park habitats and the grazing exclosure (fences are
indicated by black lines). Three plots were established in each of 4 treatment combinations: park grazed (PG), park
ungrazed (PU), tree grazed (TG), and tree ungrazed (TU). The exclosure was established in 1912, and the plots were
measured in 2005. The aerial photo was taken in 2005.

The Fry Park area was selectively logged in
1910 (Arnold 1950). Tree density did not differ
between grazing treatments when the exclo-
sure was established but is currently greater
inside than outside the exclosure (inside: 451
trees ⋅ha–1; outside: 136 trees ⋅ha–1; Bakker
and Moore 2007) due to differential recruit-
ment and survival of pine regeneration. Pon-
derosa pine is the only tree species at the
study site. The understory herbaceous vegeta-
tion is dominated by perennial grasses, such
as Sporobolus interruptus Vasey, Poa fendleri-
ana (Steud.) Vasey, and Muhlenbergia montana
(Nutt.) Hitchc. Soils are Typic Argiborolls with
basalt/cinder parent materials (Miller et al.
1995).
Cattle have grazed Fry Park since the late
1800s, though the exclosure has been main-
tained since 1912. Currently, grazing occurs
for a few weeks each summer. In 2005, cattle
were permitted to graze the area from 13
August to 7 September at an intensity of 0.03
animal unit months per hectare (USFS 2005);
this intensity is much lower than in the early
1900s (see Bakker and Moore [2007] for graz-
ing history details). Wildlife (elk, deer, small
mammals) are able to graze inside and outside
the exclosure.
Sampling Design
Sampling occurred in all 4 combinations of
grazing treatment (grazed vs. ungrazed) and
habitat (park vs. tree) (Fig. 1). Three plots, each
8 × 12 m, were established in each treatment
combination. Plots were randomly located with-
in the exclosure and paired with plots outside
the exclosure according to elevation, soil type,
depth to bedrock, and tree size, density, and
spatial arrangement.
The ground-level diameter of each tree
taller than breast height (1.37 m above ground
level) was measured, and the total tree basal
area at ground level was calculated for each
plot. Tree canopy cover and litter depth were
measured on a 2 × 2-m grid across each plot
(35 points per plot). Canopy cover was mea-
sured using a densitometer at each grid point
and calculated as the proportion of points
directly beneath a tree crown. Litter depth
was measured in cm and averaged to yield a
mean value per plot.
Each plot was divided into 192 quadrats,
each 1 × 0.5 m, for a total of 2304 quadrats. In
each quadrat, covers of plants and substrates
were measured using modified Dau benmire
cover classes: 0–0.25%, 0.25–1%, 1–5%, 5–25%,
25–50%, 50–75%, 75–95%, and 95–100%
(Magurran 2004); all observations were assigned
a cover equal to the midpoint of their cover
class. The aerial cover of each plant species
was estimated, as were covers of 6 substrate
categories (litter, bole of trees and seed lings,
bare soil, rocks, wood, and herbaceous plant
basal cover). Substrates were estimated inde-
pendently of plant aerial cover.
Data were collected from 15 to 25 August
2005. To minimize bias among botanists, we
established 3 crews of 2 botanists each, and
each crew measured one plot per treatment. Un-
known specimens were collected and identified
at the Deaver Herbarium, Northern Arizona
University, Flagstaff, Arizona. Nomenclature and
species origin (native vs. exotic) follow the
USDA PLANTS database (USDA–NRCS 2006).
Plants were also classified by functional group
(graminoid vs. forb).
Data Analyses
Plot conditions were characterized by sub-
strate composition (a matrix of the 6 substrate
categories), tree basal area, tree canopy cover,
litter depth, and aerial plant cover (total, a matrix
of species origins, and a matrix of functional
groups). Data were averaged within each plot,
and the 12 plots were used as replicates for
analyses. Each variable or matrix was analyzed
separately using permutational MANOVA
(PERMANOVA; Anderson 2001, McArdle and
Anderson 2001) to test the effects of grazing,
habitat, and the grazing × habitat interaction.
This technique avoids assumptions about data
normality and provides a common framework
for multi- and univariate analyses. PERMAN -
OVAs were conducted with the Bray-Curtis
distance measure using the adonis function in
the VEGAN package of R.
Since our quadrats were contiguous and spa-
tially autocorrelated, it would have been inap-
propriate to develop species-accumulation
curves which assume a random sample of quad-
rats (Colwell et al. 2004). Instead, we followed
Condit et al. (1996) and generated species-area
curves by aggregating quadrats into nonover-
lapping sampling areas at a range of grain sizes
(m2): 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 96 (one plot),
288 (all 3 plots in a given combination of habitat
and grazing treatment), and 576 (all 6 plots in
a given habitat or grazing treatment). The
336

num ber of replicates obviously declined as
grain size increased. At the 64-m2 grain, the
sampling area was defined as the 8 × 8-m
northern extent of each plot; at all other grain
sizes, every quadrat was assigned to one non -
overlapping sampling area. Species density was
calculated at each grain size and summarized
by means and 95% confidence intervals fol-
lowing Condit et al. (1996).
Indicator species were identified using in -
dicator species analysis (ISA; Dufrêne and
Legendre 1997). ISA accounts for the relative
abundance (measured as aerial cover) and fre-
quency of each species and is calculated in -
dependently for each species. Formulae are
described by Dufrêne and Legendre (1997),
McCune and Grace (2002), and Bakker (2008).
ISAs were conducted using quadrat-level cover
data. Separate ISAs were conducted to iden-
tify indicators of grazing treatments and of
habitats. Analyses of indicator species of graz-
ing treatment were conducted separately for
each pair of plots (one inside and one outside
the exclosure with similar soils, overstory, ele-
vation, etc.). Analyses of indicator species of
habitat were conducted separately for each
grazing treatment. By conducting analyses in
this fashion, we controlled one factor while
assessing differences in the other factor. Re -
sults were then combined using meta-analytic
techniques (see Bakker 2008) to yield a mean
indicator value (IV) and combined P value for
each species in each level of each factor. Spe -
cies were considered to be indicators if mean
IV ≥25 and combined P ≤0.05. ISAs were
conducted using a routine written for R (Bakker
2008).
RESULTS
General Plot Conditions
Substrate composition varied between habi-
tats but not between grazing treatments (Table
1). Litter composed most of the substrate in tree
plots, while bare soil and herbaceous plant
basal cover dominated park plots. Average litter
depth was more than 3 times higher in tree than
park plots. As expected, tree basal area and
canopy cover were substantial in tree plots and
negligible in park plots.
Total plant cover was much higher in park
than tree plots (Fig. 2). Native species dominated
the cover and were most abundant in park habi-
tat, while exotic species were most prevalent
in grazed park plots. Graminoid cover was
higher in park than tree plots, while forb cover
did not differ among treatments.
Species-Area Curves
We identified 98 species in our study area.
At grains up to 32 m2, total species density
was higher in park than tree plots and in
grazed than ungrazed plots. However, species-
area curves differed between habitats and
grazing treatments (Fig. 3). Habitats differed
strongly at small grain sizes but converged at
large grains, whereas grazed and ungrazed
plots did not differ as strongly at small grains
but diverged as sampling area increased. A
comparison of species densities at the 2 largest
grains shows that species were accumulating
more rapidly in the grazed area (12.3 m2 ⋅
species–1) than the ungrazed area (18.6 m2 ⋅
species–1). Furthermore, 95% of the species
identified in this study were present in the

in the ungrazed area.
Density of native species was higher in park
than tree plots at grains ≤32 m2 (Fig. 4A). Graz-
ing affected native species density only at very
small grains (≤4 m2), and the difference be -
tween grazing treatments at these grains was
much less than the difference between habitats.
Only 7 exotic species were encountered dur-
ing our sampling. Park plots contained more
exotic species than tree plots at grains ≤8 m2,
whereas grazed plots contained more exotic spe -
cies than ungrazed plots at all grains (Fig. 4B).
Density of graminoid species was higher in
park than tree plots at grain sizes ≤32 m2 and in
grazed than ungrazed plots at grains ≤8 m2 (Fig.
4C). Density of forbs was higher in park than
tree plots at grains ≤16 m2 and in grazed than
ungrazed plots at grains ≤32 m2 (Fig. 4D).
Indicator Species
Twenty-two species were indicators of
habitat and/or grazing treatment (Table 2).
Thirteen of 15 habitat indicators were indica-
tors of park plots, while 10 of 14 grazing treat-
ment indicators were indicators of grazed
plots. Seven of the 22 species were indicators
of distinct combinations of habitat and graz-
ing: 5 were indicators of grazed park plots, 1
of ungrazed park plots, and 1 of grazed tree
plots.

examination of ecological hypotheses (Gross et
al. 2000, Crawley and Harral 2001). Conserva-
tion and management decisions must explic-
itly ac count for the grain at which data have
been collected and analyzed when plant com-
munity responses to treatments are evaluated.
Our sampling was conducted using small
quadrats (0.5 m2) because we felt that ecological
interactions such as competition and dispersal,
which are important in structuring communities,
would be strongest at these scales. However,
species density differed significantly between
habitats and between grazing treatments at all
grains ≤4 m2, suggesting that future studies
could use quadrats up to this size to detect dif-
ferences in species density between treatments.
Nested sampling techniques, such as modified
Whittaker plots (Stohlgren et al. 1995), are also
used to assess large extents and to develop
species-area curves. But these techniques gen-
erally do not sample as intensively at larger
grains, raising the possibility that rare or diminu-
tive species will be missed. The optimal grain is
a balance between the required resolution and
the logistical constraints associated with sam-
pling more, smaller quadrats.
Species-area curves did not level off after
sampling 576 m2 in any treatment (Fig. 3). On
average, based on the difference in species rich-
ness between the 2 largest grain sizes, a species
was still being added for every 16 m2 of ground
sampled. An estimate of the true species rich-
ness of these treatments would clearly require
sampling of even larger areas.
Grazing
Livestock grazing might be expected to in -
crease species density at small grain sizes by
increasing the patchiness (spatial heterogene-
ity) of the vegetation and therefore the rate of
species turnover. Many studies have examined
grazing effects at small grains, but the results
are inconclusive: some have reported increased
richness in grazed areas (Rambo and Faeth 1999,
Stohlgren et al. 1999, Pykala 2004), while oth-
ers found no effect of grazing (Guenther et al.
2004, Bakker and Moore 2007) or reduced rich -
ness in grazed areas (reviewed by Fleischner
1994). These conflicting reports may reflect dif-
ferences in productivity, environmental condi-
tions, parent material, soil type, kind of livestock,
and season of grazing (Johnson 1956, Olff and
Ritchie 1998). 
We found that grazing increased species
density at small grains (Fig. 3), but this effect
was small compared to the differences in species
density between habitats. Furthermore, although
grazed areas did contain more exotic species,
they did not differ in substrate composition,
litter depth, or plant cover. Overall, grazing ef -
fects were minimal at small grains. This result is
surprising given that the exclosure was in place
for 93 years and vegetation might therefore be
expected to differ more strongly. However,
this result may relate to the very low livestock
grazing intensity outside the exclosure in recent
years (Bakker and Moore 2007).
Studies of grazing effects are less common at
large grain sizes. Stohlgren et al. (1999) found

no difference in species richness between 1000-
m2 grazed and ungrazed sites. We were unable
to detect statistically significant differences be-
tween grazing treatments at grains >32 m2,
though there was a tendency for grazing treat-
ments to diverge at larger grains (Fig. 3). How -
ever, we have presented results from a single
grazing exclosure; additional multiscaled assess-
ments of grazing effects are clearly warranted.
Ten species were indicators of grazed areas.
Included in this list are a number of diminu-
tive annuals (e.g., Polygonum douglasii Greene,
Chamaesyce serpyllifolia [Pers.] Small) and bien-
nials (e.g., Eri geron flagellaris A. Gray, Erigeron
divergens Torr. & A. Gray) that were also in -
dicators of park areas. These species are able
to persist likely because they are too small to
be grazed and/or because they can rapidly colo-
nize grazing-induced disturbances.
All larger-statured indicators of grazed areas
were grasses, and their indicator status could
often be explained by reference to their biol-
ogy. For example, Pascopyrum smithii (Rydb.)
A. Löve is strongly rhizomatous, while Elymus
elymoides (Raf.) Swezey has long, sharp awns
that protect it from grazing after flowering.
Elymus elymoides also colonizes sites quickly
and was more common in grazed than ungrazed
areas of the Hill plots between 1921 and 1941
(Arnold 1950), suggesting that it is a stable in -
dicator of grazed areas. Agropyron desertorum
(Fisch. ex Link) Schult., an exotic species, was
commonly seeded into grazed areas to increase
forage for livestock.
Indicators of ungrazed plots included bunch-
grasses (Muhlenbergia montana [Nutt.] Hitchc.
and Blepharoneuron tricholepis [Torr.] Nash) that
are palatable to cattle ( Johnson 1956, Smith
1967) and tall, showy forbs (Lupinus argenteus
Pursh and Solidago velutina DC.) whose above-
ground vegetative parts may be susceptible to
grazing damage due to their taller stature.
Muhlenbergia montana was also an indicator of
park areas, suggesting that it has a more nar-
rowly defined set of preferred environmental
conditions than the other indicators of ungrazed
areas.
Habitat
Based on all 5 Hill plots, Bakker and Moore
(2007) concluded that differences in overstory
abundance explained more of the variation in
understory herbaceous vegetation than did
grazing treatments. Our findings at small grain

aIndicator value (IV). All indicator species have mean indicator values ≥25 (shown) and combined P value <0.05 (not shown). Letters after the IV indicate the
treatment of which the species was an indicator (habitat: P = park; T = tree; grazing: G = grazed; U = ungrazed). Note that species can be indicators of either
or both treatments.
bCover data are the mean aerial cover and the percentage of quadrats on which a species occurred in a treatment combination. For example, A. desertorum had
a mean cover of 1.6% and occurred on 25% of quadrats within park grazed plots. A dash indicates that a species did not occur in that treatment combination.

sizes are consistent with their conclusion,
even though our study was conducted at a sin-
gle site in a different year and with a different
sampling methodology. Other studies have also
reported fewer understory species in treed areas
than in open or grassland areas (Arnold 1950,
McConnell and Smith 1970, Naumburg and
DeWald 1999, Crawley and Harral 2001). Dif-
ferences in species density between habitats
declined more slowly with increasing grain size
than those between grazing treatments, though
park and tree habitats never differed at grains
>32 m2. Crawley and Harral (2001) reported
that woodlands exhibited stronger scale-depen-
dent changes in the slope of the species–area
relationship, which was also the case here: tree
plots contained fewer species at small grains but
accumulated species more rapidly than park
plots.
The only indicators of tree plots were 2
perennial graminoids, Carex geophila Mack. and
E. elymoides. Naumburg and DeWald (1999)
observed that the presence of both of these
species was positively related to forest structure,
while Naumburg et al. (2001) concluded that
E. elymoides was less affected by experimental
shading than 3 other dominant grass species.
Elymus elymoides was more common in tree
than park plots before 1941, though it declined
in abundance as the overstory increased in
dominance (Arnold 1950).
Thirteen species were indicators of park
areas, possibly due to the high light availability
(McConnell and Smith 1970) or to other edaphic
variables within the park habitat, including in -
creased water during snow runoff, frost pock-
eting, and differences in soils and fire regime.
Several of these species were also identified as
indicators of park areas in earlier studies (Arnold
1950, Bakker 2005). Sporobolus interruptus
Vasey is of particular interest as it is locally
abundant but endemic to a small region of
northern Arizona. Poa fendleriana (Steud.) Vasey
does not appear to be reacting to light availabil-
ity in the park, as Naumburg and DeWald (1999)
did not detect a relationship between the pre -
sence or absence of this species and forest
structure. Similarly, Koeleria macrantha (Ledeb.)
Schult. was an indicator of park areas but was
less affected by experimental shading than 3
other common grass species (Naumburg et al.
2001).
Vegetative differences between habitats likely
affect livestock grazing patterns. Compositional
differences between habitats influence species
selection by livestock, and the very large differ-
ences in forage quantity mean that most grazing
likely occurs in the park areas. More detailed
analyses of these patterns, however, were be -
yond the scope of this project.
Conclusions
We conclude that habitat has a stronger ef -
fect than livestock grazing on the herbaceous
understory vegetation of this southwestern pon-
derosa pine–bunchgrass ecosystem, particularly
at small grain sizes. Our results also suggest
that grazing effects tend to be more pronounced
at larger grain sizes, though studies with repli-
cate grazing treatments would be required to
verify this conclusion. Evaluations of plant com-
munity response to treatments must explicitly
account for the scale at which data have been
collected and analyzed. Furthermore, particular
plant species are indicators of habitat, grazing
treatment, or unique treatment combinations.
This knowledge contributes to our understand-
ing of factors that control plant abundance and
diversity and enables more informed conserva-
tion and management. For example, treatment
effects could be more efficiently monitored by
focusing on those species identified as indica-
tors of that treatment.
Logistical constraints prevented this study
from being replicated at multiple sites. Future
studies could assess the generality of these
results by conducting similar studies at addi-
tional sites. The long-term nature of the grazing
treatments (>90 years) was a unique element
of this study, and short- and long-term responses
to grazing exclusion may differ. Examination
of this question would require the develop-
ment of species-area curves for sites that differ
in time since grazing exclusion.
