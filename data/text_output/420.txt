Policy Dialogue on Collaborative Forestry 
Flagstaff, Arizona 
September 2003 
 
 
 
After several years of effort, many collaborative and community-based forestry groups 
that formed in the 1990s are still struggling to implement their land management projects. 
The combined impact of several factors, including legal challenges, funding problems, 
agency history, bureaucratic processes, and poor internal communication, seems to 
conspire against collaborative solutions for today’s land management challenges.  
 
Several efforts have been made in recent years to identify barriers to collaboration and to 
identify various solutions to these complicated public resource issues. As part of this 
chain of examinations, the Ecological Restoration Institute, in cooperation with the 
Pinchot Institute, the Society of American Foresters, and American Forests, has 
organized a 2-day workshop to clarify policy and procedural factors that hinder 
collaborative forestry efforts and suggest policy changes to address those factors. This 
document, which summarizes the findings and suggestions from previous workshops and 
policy analyses, has been prepared for participants in the September 2003 workshop.  
In order to facilitate discussion, this document is divided into three sections. The first 
section reviews legal and regulatory problems faced by collaborative forestry groups. The 
second lists various funding challenges faced by agency partners and collaborators. The 
third section summarizes barriers to collaboration that have been attributed to Forest 
Service culture and practices. Each problem statement is followed by an explanatory 
discussion from the literature, and, where available, suggestions for policy changes that 
could alleviate the problem.

Laws and Policies  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The complex array of laws and policies governing Forest Service actions has created 
confusing and in some cases conflicting guidance on when, where, and how collaborative 
efforts can be undertaken. As a result, some agency personnel have grown reluctant to 
collaborate for fear of legal and professional repercussions. Examples of inconsistent 
interpretation and application of federal laws affecting collaboration are listed below. 
 
Problem: Many agency personnel are unwilling to participate in a group that is not 
Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA)-chartered.1
 
Discussion: Vague language within the Act has led to differing legal interpretations and 
inconsistent rulings of when FACA applies and when it does not.2 The Forest Service, in 
particular, has expressed confusion about whether or not their participation in a 
collaborative forestry group makes that group subject to FACA. 3 Because of this, some 
in the agency refuse to participate in any group which does not comply with FACA.4  
 
Suggestions:  
• Provide a single, clear interpretation of where FACA applies and where it does not.For 
example, develop a manual or guidelines and seminars that help FS employees to better 
understand the law.5
 
Problem: Compliance with FACA is a problem for collaborative forestry groups 
because the Act’s requirements are onerous.6
 
Discussion: Under FACA, federal advisory committees must be chartered, and their 
charters must include a description of duties, the estimated number and frequency of 
meetings, and other details. The chartering process often takes several months to 
complete, with final approval based upon a balanced membership and the nature of work 
conducted. Once a group is chartered, it must comply with the following requirements for 
every meeting it holds: publish the meeting time, date, place, and agenda in the Federal 
Register 15 days in advance of holding it; provide public access; keep detailed minutes; 
and have a designated federal employee in attendance.7  
 
Problem: Some federal laws have been found to discourage private landowners and 
businesses from collaborating with the Forest Service. 8
 
Discussion: NEPA and the Endangered Species Act (ESA) sometimes discourage private 
landowners from partnering with federal agencies on cross-jurisdictional projects because 
they do not want to become subject to federal environmental regulatory processes.9 The 
Freedom of Information Act sometimes discourages private entities from sharing 
sensitive information with federal agencies.10 The Sherman Antitrust Act may limit 
private companies from collaborating in collective landscape planning.11
 
 
 
- page 2 - 

 
Problem: Environmental laws such as the National Environmental Policy Act, the 
Endangered Species Act, and the National Forest Management Act pose 
cumbersome and time-consuming procedural requirements. 12
 
Discussion: Agency policies tend to manifest themselves in rigid and complex processes. 
The associated “red tape,” paperwork and required meetings can easily scare off potential 
collaborators, intimidate agency staff, and drain energy and support from collaborative 
projects.The NEPA process in particular has been questioned because of “1) the amount 
of time it takes to complete NEPA; 2) the costs of NEPA relative to project size and 
impact; 3) the process of NEPA and its usefulness in improving projects; 4) quality of 
NEPA analysis and agency capacity; 5) concern for litigation prevention over doing what 
is right for the land; and 6) problems with consultation.”13  
Increasingly, however, agency partners and policy scholars have found that these 
laws are not in and of themselves the problem. The problem, many say, lies in the delays 
associated with their implementation, which are sometimes due to agency regulations but 
also stem from excessive environmental analyses by agency personnel anxious to cover 
themselves in the case of potential appeals and litigation.14
 
Suggestions: 
• Streamline ESA Section 7 consultations for projects carried out under the auspices of 
the National Fire Plan.15
• Look at NEPA and ESA together to understand how and if they have become barriers to 
restoration.16  
• Review NEPA – the law, regulations, and implementation practices – to figure out 
what’s not working and change it.17
• Exempt hazardous fuels reduction and forest health projects from analysis of 
alternatives.18
• Exclude fuels reduction and forest health projects from the requirements for a full 
environmental impact statement.19
• Categorically exclude hazardous fuels treatments, forest health and restoration projects 
from NEPA analysis.20
• “Any changes to NEPA should be based on on-ground experience and should retain the 
value NEPA provides to decisions.”21
• Limit requests for judicial review of fuels reduction projects to a 15-day period, limit 
preliminary judicial injunctions to 45 days, and require judicial rulings within 100 days.22

Problem: When federal courts reach different decisions on certain national forest 
management procedures and standards, they leave forest managers in a quandary 
as to how to proceed.23  
 
Discussion: In some cases, all decisions on all pending projects have been put on hold 
while the agency waits for clarification on judicial rulings. For example, there are 
conflicting judicial decisions on the appropriateness of National Environmental Policy 
Act (NEPA) categorical exclusions for “extraordinary circumstances;” rulings supporting 
the use of wildlife population data versus habitat to comply with management indicator 
species monitoring; and whether or not the Migratory Bird Treaty Act applies to federal 
actions.24  
 
Problem: Widespread use of appeals to halt or delay forest management projects has 
caused significant delays in project planning and implementation.25
 
Discussion: There are many stories of collaboratively-designed projects delayed for 
months or even cancelled due to appeals by outside groups that have not participated in 
the collaborative process.26 These delays have led to new regulations and proposed 
legislation that would limit the ability to appeal to those who have participated in earlier 
planning or comment periods. 
On the other hand, those advocating for retaining access to appeals, particularly 
some environmental interest groups, argue that the appeals process should not be 
changed, for the following reasons. 1. Appeals are not born in isolation; in most cases 
there is a long-standing, unresolved conflict around the appealed issue. 2. A lack of 
involvement by some groups in the pre-decisional process may be a conscious choice. 
They may not have the time and personnel to participate in lengthy and expensive 
processes; appeals are a more efficient way of participating. 3. Delays can be a strategic 
tool. A project delay might enable participants to simultaneously pursue other entry 
points to the political process to achieve their goals before a final decision forecloses 
options that are undesirable to the group.27
 
Suggestion:  
• Make legislative and regulatory changes to limit the ability to appeal to those who have 
been involved in the process of project development and review.28

Funding Issues 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Although collaborative resource management is believed to reduce management costs (by 
reducing later conflict and allowing organizations to pool resources and develop joint 
management strategies), there are also substantial costs associated with collaborative 
group processes, most notably extremely large time demands placed on managers and 
other collaborators.29  
 
Problem: There is no source of consistent, long-term, yet flexible funding of the kind 
needed for collaborative forest efforts.30
 
Discussion: Research on collaborative groups has found that stable, long-term, and 
flexible funding is closely correlated with a group’s effectiveness.31 Yet the Forest 
Service, the primary funder of collaborative forestry, is chronically short on funding for 
collaborative efforts, and what funding is available is inconsistent (long turnaround times 
for grant approval, findings not distributed in a timely manner, funding limited to one 
year because of agency budgeting procedures).32  
 
Suggestion:  
• Institutionalize funding for collaborative efforts by creating standing programs.33
• Invest in forest restoration before fire suppression. 34
• Address forestry funding in the National Fire Plan and in Farm Bill’s Forestry Title.35
• Improve funding for agency restoration and maintenance activities, contracting 
personnel, the National Fire Plan, and regulatory agencies.36
 
Problem: Rigid budget structures limit the agency’s ability to fund collaborative 
efforts.37
 
Dicsussion: In some cases, the agency has funds but is unable to allocate them to 
collaborative activities. Forest Service budgets are driven by line items, and no lines exist 
for collaborative efforts or agency activities like public involvement and collaborative 
stewardship.38 As a result, managers have little flexibility to redirect appropriations, 
leaving many collaborative partnerships or projects unfunded because they don’t fit 
within the agency’s budgeting structure.39  
 
Suggestion: 
• Create a line item for collaboration or identify specific line item(s) from which 
collaboration will be funded. (e.g., Funds for collaboration in identifying and developing 
hazardous fuels reduction project under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act shall be 
derived from the Wildland Fire Management Program, line items for Preparedness and/or 
Hazardous Fuel).40
 
 
- page 5 - 

 
Problem: Much of the funding available for collaborative efforts is only available in 
large amounts; funding needs to be scaled to the needs of rural communities and 
institutionalized into standing programs.41  
 
Suggestion: 
• Reinstate and maintain funding for the Economic Action Programs, which “provide the 
planning, capacity building, and creation of social capital necessary to build a consistent 
program of work for restoration.”42
• Ensure county payment funding gets to the ground.43
• Create new fuels reduction funding program for local and tribal governments.44
 
Problem: Agency fiscal procedures, such as the match requirements for cost-share 
grants and borrowing funds for fire fighting, can undermine collaboration forestry 
efforts. 45
 
Discussion: Many community groups and small non-profit organizations report difficulty 
meeting the funding match required for Forest Service cost-share agreements. Although 
the law authorizing collaborative cost-share grants does not specify what percentage of 
the match must be provided by cooperators, the Forest Service manual instructs agency 
personnel to negotiate a dollar-for-dollar match.  
Forest Service rules generally do not allow managers to contribute funds to a 
project prior to its implementation. The Forest Service generally reimburses for work 
after it is completed. But agency partners, especially small rural governments and 
organizations, are not likely to be able to carry large project costs.46

Agency Culture and Practices  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Recent trends in American governance,emphasize “nonhierarchical, place-based 
networks in which government, citizens, and organized stakeholders cooperate and 
negotiate” land management issues.47 The public has come to expect that agency 
managers will be “accountable” to the groups with whom they collaborate; and to many, 
accountability has come to mean “the ability of government to actually deliver on 
promises.”48 This new definition of accountability is not widely accepted within the 
agency, however, and the persistence of traditional attitudes and practices presents a 
significant barrier to collaboration. 
 
Problem: Agency personnel are exclusionary and do not respond to input from non-
agency partners.49
 
Discussion: Would-be collaborators sometimes complain that agency employees have not 
always taken the time necessary to answer invitations or build relationships, leaving the 
impression that their work is somehow ‘above’ community relations and collaboration. 
This behavior may be due to several factors, including heavy workloads, lack of 
collaboration/facilitation skills, funding and budget constraints, and agency priorities.  
This sense of indifference towards collaboration is exacerbated by negative experiences 
with past public participation. Interest groups and individuals report participating in 
scoping meetings, hearings, and public comment periods only to see the agency make 
management decisions that they believe went against the expressed interests of the public 
and the best interest of the environment.50 The Forest Service’s ‘we are the experts’ 
attitude also leads to dismissal of critics who seem ill informed or extreme in their 
views.51 Others have observed damage to collaborative efforts due to turf battles among 
agencies.52
 
Problem: The agency is unwilling to commit to collaborative group rules or 
decisions. 53
 
Discussion: Policy analysts also report a continuing trend in the agency’s reluctance to 
yield significant control within a collaborative setting. While it may acknowledge an 
understanding of how partnerships should work, the philosophy of the agency appears to 
favor top-down delivery of programs and control at all times.54 Non-federal participants 
in collaborative groups complain that the Forest Service officials are unnecessarily 
protective of their discretion, to the point that they give their partners no guarantee that 
what is planned will actually be accomplished.55
 
Problem: Lack of communication between different agency branches and 
departments and among district, forest, regional, and national offices further 
impedes collaboration.56
 
Discussion: National Forest System staff are often unaware of existing networks of 
collaboration between Cooperative Forestry staff and local communities – even when 
staff from both units work out of the same office.57 In addition, there are wide gaps in 
- page 7 - 

 
understanding between line officers and contracting officers with regard to partnerships 
and collaboration. For example, many timber sale contracting officers and service 
contracting officers rarely work together, despite the need for an understanding of both 
sets of procedures under new legislation.58  In other instances, the agency’s leadership 
has expressed support of collaboration, but there has general inconsistency in their 
interpretation at the local/regional level.59
 
Problem: Agency employees are reluctant to use contracting authorities to their full 
potential, often due to misunderstanding the true intent and applicability of such 
authorities.60
 
Discussion: The Forest Service’s erratic interpretation of its  own contracting authorities 
is a common problem for collaborative forestry groups. Contracting officers in particular 
are resistant to using new authorities that raise ethical concerns (e.g., collaboration may 
be a violation of anti-trust law) and may become problematic in internal audits.61 As a 
result, some “collaboratives are experiencing the enormously frustrating experience of 
spending months or years carefully developing consensus-based solutions with diverse 
interests only to be told as they prepare to implement these that there are no vehicles to 
accomplish the tasks other than traditional timber sales, cost-share agreements, or 
cooperative agreements. Contracting officers consistently refuse to attempt more creative 
solutions because they believe they will be held personally liable should these projects 
fail.”62  
 
Suggestions:  
• Promote internal training sessions and seminars on how to make the best use of all 
contracting mechanisms and make contracting officers familiar with the use of new 
authorities. Any new authority passed in Congress should include adequately funding for 
training of FS employees so they can make the best use out of them.63  
• Support stewardship contracting authorities and monitoring. 64
• Support increased hires in procurement. 65
• Support Service Contract Act enforcement and accountability. 66
• Develop leadership within the agencies to better use existing authorities.67
 
 
Problem: The agency’s practice of transferring line officers every few years is 
problematic, because institutional knowledge about and commitment to 
collaborative efforts tends to leave with the individual. 68
 
Discussion: When key agency partners are transferred, non-agency partners find that they 
must inform new personnel of existing agreements, or even renegotiate them. One study 
that tracked 35 collaborative processes over a three-to-five year period found that 
personnel changes affected 42% of the original cases.69 In some cases, replacement or 
transfer of key agency personnel has caused the entire collaborative effort to fail.70  
 
 
 
- page 8 - 

 
Problem: There is a lack of internal support and incentives for agency staff to 
collaborate. 71
 
Discussion: Research on collaborative resource management groups has found that the 
most successful efforts are those which agencies have amply dedicated staff time.72 
Researchers have also found that decentralized agencies that delegate decision-making 
authority to their field staff are more effective collaborators than those from centralized, 
hierarchical agencies.73 Unfortunately, as Forest Service managers know, staff time and 
decision-making authority are in short supply in Forest Service field work. In the Forest 
Service, employees who attempt to collaborate and implement innovative ideas are 
unlikely to be rewarded or recognized for their efforts. The agency’s employee 
performance evaluation criteria do not include collaboration or partnership activities, so 
line officers who want to get ahead in the agency have little incentive to risk spending 
their time on new collaborative. In some cases, risk-takers have been actively censured 
for engaging in collaborative activities.74  
 
Suggestions:  
• Develop and utilize performance evaluation criteria that specifically measure the ability 
and willingness to work with communities and other external interests.75
• Ask Congress to authorize the creation of regional training teams comprised of 
representatives from federal agencies, community-based collaborative groups, 
contractors/workers, and academic institutions to provide training on local level 
collaboration.76  
• Ask Congress to authorize the creation of local and state advisory councils to assist the 
federal agencies in their efforts to develop meaningful collaborative processes at the local 
level.77
 
Problem: There is minimal agency support for monitoring and evaluation. 78
 
Discussion: Literature specific to collaborative forestry resounds with calls for 
monitoring and evaluation of collaborative group processes and outcomes as a way to 
provide accountability among different parties.79 In addition to providing a measure of 
accountability, monitoring and evaluation offer a means of documenting and learning 
from prior experiences in collaboration, reducing the risk that mistakes will be repeated.80 
Yet monitoring and evaluation are the most under-funded, least often implemented aspect 
of agency management.81
 
Suggestions: 
• Improve agency commitment to monitoring and evaluation, including use of 
standardized protocols.82
• Establish a “National Advisory Council on Hazardous Fuels Reduction;” a commitment 
to engaging local communities and ensuring access to data; an annual reporting 
requirement and structure; and a funding commitment similar to the one for 
collaboration. 83

51 KenCairn warns that “dismissal … [of] Zero-cut activists and other questioning commercial uses of 
public land resources … fails to recognize how significant and pervasive this distrust of the economy runs 
in the broader public [and] the legacy of past mis-management of public lands that was in many cases 
driven by maximizing commercial gain at the expense of ecological integrity” (p. 11). He advises the 
agency to acknowledge and address “the increasingly pervasive sense of distrust and disempowerment that 
the broader public feels” toward agency management of the national forests (KenCairn 2000, p. 11).

where Regional and Forest-level line officers says the agency does not have the authority to do something, 
while the Washington Office simultaneously says it does (Loucks and Kostishack 2001, KenCairn 2000).

80 Increasingly, sociologists and political scientists studying collaboratives are identifying a lack of 
mechanisms for enforcing group’s standards and agreements to be a major problem (Weber 1999, Mandell 
1999, Cigler 1999). Because of these issues of trust, as well as the reality that unscrupulous individuals can 
misuse collaborative processes, some sociologists advise that collaborative efforts should focus “not just on 
building trust but rather on establishing predictability and reducing vulnerability” (Mandell 1999, p.13).
