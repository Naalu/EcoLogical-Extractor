Reference conditions and historical changes in an
unharvested ponderosa pine stand on sedimentary soil
Eryn E. Schneider1,2,3, Andrew J. Sánchez Meador4, William W. Covington4
Much of the previous research on spatial reference conditions in dry frequent fire pine forests have come from stand-level
patterns under regionally average ecosystem conditions (e.g. soil type and precipitation). We evaluated the 1883 reference
conditions of an uncut ponderosa pine stand representing a far end of the range of variability in terms of regionally unusual
environmental conditions. Using a forest reconstruction model, univariate and bivariate Ripley’s K functions, and regression
analysis, we determined 1883 structural and spatial reference conditions, and compared those to the contemporary (2010)
stand. Historical stand density was 77 trees/ha with a basal area of 8.0 m2/ha. Reference spatial patterns were significantly
aggregated from 1 to 2 m and randomly distributed at distances greater than 2 m. Nearly 40% of the reconstructed trees
were individuals, the average patch size was 2.9 trees, and the largest patch had 7 members. The contemporary stand had
considerably greater densities and basal area than historical conditions and showed aggregation at all distances. Bivariate
spatial analysis indicated attraction of post-settlement recruitment to live pre-settlement trees from 1 to 6 m and no association
at distances greater than 6 m. We speculate that the historically random tree pattern is the product of a variety of factors
including soil parent material, climate, and more homogeneous resource partitioning.

Implications for Practice
• Before treatment, structural and spatial reference condi-
tions should be evaluated for each site; or at a minimum,
general factors such as soil parent material and properties,
vegetation composition, disturbance regime, and local cli-
matic variables (e.g. precipitation) should be considered.
• If the management goal is to restore structure and func-
tion, we suggest using the combined canopy radii-fixed
distance patch detection, as it allows for stand develop-
ment. Used independently, a fixed distance may identify
too many patches and canopy radii may detect too few.
• For sites with a global-level random pattern, man-
agers should use caution when implementing patch or
group-based management techniques and may want to
favor individual-tree based techniques to reduce the risk
of overemphasizing aggregation or grouping.
Introduction
Ecological restoration of frequent fire pine forests requires not
only restoring tree densities and size distributions but also spa-
tial patterns (Covington et al. 1997; Churchill et al. 2013). For-
est structure and spatial patterns are the result of a complex
interplay among historical and environmental mechanisms such
as climate, disturbance patterns, species life history, competi-
tion, microclimatic patterns, soil properties, and past land use
and management (Law et al. 1993; Landres et al. 1999; Abella
& Denton 2009; Sánchez Meador & Moore 2010). Analysis
of these patterns provides insight into stand development and
dynamics including tree establishment, competition, and mor-
tality (Cooper 1961; White 1985; Legendre & Fortin 1989).
Spatial patterns also influence tree growth, habitat availability,
species and genetic diversity, and disturbance patterns such as
fire and disease outbreaks (Ffolliott et al. 1977; DeWald 2003;
Fulé et al. 2007). Studying the changes in these patterns over
time can aid in predicting future stand development and man-
agement outcomes.
Frequent fire pine forests in the western United States
(Fulé et al. 1997; Mast & Veblen 1999), Mexico (Fulé &
Covington 1998; Stephens & Gill 2005), and Europe (Wirth
et al. 1999; Fulé et al. 2008) occur over a range of elevations
(900–3,000 m), climates (xeric to mesic), and soil types (e.g.
basalt and limestone). Species composition ranges from pure
pine to dry mixed conifer where frequent fire (mean return inter-
val from 2 to 35 years) exerts a primary control on forest struc-
ture and dynamics (Taylor 2010; Huffman et al. 2015)—this

Unharvested ponderosa pine reference conditions
forest type hereafter referred to as frequent fire forests. Regen-
eration of dominant species including Pinus ponderosa in the
western United States and Pinus sylvestris and P. nigra in
Europe requires the presence of bare mineral soil (Oliver &
Ryker 1990; González-Martínez & Bravo 2001), a release from
competition with herbaceous species, and an ample seed crop
(Kolb et al. 1994; Allen et al. 2002; Mast 2003). In North Amer-
ica, prior to Euro-American settlement in the mid-late 1800s,
frequent fire, climate, and regeneration processes maintained
open, park-like stands with patches of trees, grassy openings,
and large individuals (Cooper 1960; White 1985; Covington
& Moore 1994a; Reynolds et al. 2013). Natural fires, ignited
by lightning, occurred primarily as low severity surface fires
that were carried by the herbaceous understory. Fires typically
consumed all understory vegetation including seedlings and
saplings not yet fire resistant. Historical tree spatial patterns
tended to be aggregated although completely spatially random
(CSR) or uniform patterns have been found (Youngblood et al.
2004; Abella & Denton 2009).
Land use changes in the frequent fire forests of the west-
ern United States over the last 130 years has led to dramatic
changes in forest structure, composition, and disturbance regime
(Covington & Moore 1994a, 1994b). Logging, overgrazing, and
fire exclusion since the early 1800s have shifted forest structure
from open and park-like toward a homogenized matrix of dense
thickets of small diameter trees punctuated by patches of rem-
nant pre-settlement pines. Forest composition has also shifted
toward shade tolerant species and the disturbance regime is now
outside the natural range of variability (Moore et al. 1999). The
lack of surface fuels and fires in these frequent fire systems is
thought to have also shifted the patterns of regeneration from
recruiting and establishing near or within mature tree patches to
following a “gap” model (sensu Watt 1947).
Historical forest conditions obtained from relict sites are used
as one line of evidence informing reference conditions and con-
tribute to the natural range of variability when compiled across
an ecosystem type (Egan & Howell 2001). Currently, the range
of variability for frequent fire forests in North America is char-
acterized by stands located within regionally common environ-
mental conditions. Few studies presently address structural and
spatial reference patterns at sites with extreme or unusual abiotic
conditions that would comprise the far end of the range of vari-
ability (e.g. soil type and precipitation). Because the existence of
relict stands or those suitable for reconstruction across the land-
scape are rare, the probability of finding one with conditions that
falls toward the ends of the spectrum is small, but critical for
expanding the existing range of variability. Research suggests
that pine occurring on more productive sites, evaluated by a site
index for maximal growth, and those with coarse textured soils
(e.g. limestone) have been found to support greater tree densities
and produce greater tree biomass than similar lower productiv-
ity, fine textured (i.e. basalt) sites (Covington & Moore 1994b;
Klemmedson 1995; Puhlick et al. 2012). In terms of spatial pat-
terns, sites with warmer, wetter, and silty soil conditions tend to
support less variable forest patterns with smaller patch sizes, a
shorter distance at which aggregation begins to repeat, and few
large canopy openings (Harrod et al. 1999; Abella & Denton
2009).
Our study was designed to expand the existing historical
range of variability in structural and spatial reference condi-
tions for frequent fire pine forests by intensively analyzing an
uncut, old-growth ponderosa pine stand on rarely documented
site conditions. By census measuring and mapping existing
pre-settlement trees and historical structures, and reconstructing
pre-fire exclusion (circa 1883; Fulé et al. 1997) conditions, we
sought to: (1) determine pre-fire exclusion structural and spatial
reference conditions (1883); (2) examine how overstory stand
structure and spatial pattern has changed since fire exclusion
(from 1883 to 2010); and (3) examine post-settlement (>1883)
recruitment patterns following fire exclusion.
Methods
Study Site
We
examined
a
privately
owned
quarter
section
(34∘59′21.86′′N, 111∘48′23.03′′W) on the Mogollon Rim;
48 km southwest of Flagstaff, AZ (Fig. 1). Fire has been
excluded from the site since Euro-American settlement (1883).
Prior to this time, fires were frequently ignited by lightning and
burned every 2–8 years due to the site’s geographic location
in a high lightning strike zone (Huffman et al. 2015). This site
has never been logged, but has been subject to intermittent
grazing. The study area is flat, but periodically intersected by
drainages with an average elevation of 2,097 m. The soils are
Permian Kaibab limestone classified as fine montmorillonitic
Typic Paleboralf with a gravelly, fine sandy loam texture. Soil
pH is 5.27 with sand, silt, and clay contents of 78.6, 14.8, and
6.6%, respectively (Puhlick 2011). Site index (Minor 1964) is
28.7 m (n = 12) at 100 years. The closest weather station, 16 km
southeast of our site, reported a mean annual temperature of
16.9∘C with 64.7 cm of mean annual precipitation with half
falling as monsoonal precipitation and the other half as snow
(1986–2012; WRCC 2012). The study site is dominated by
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa C. Lawson var. scopulorum
Engelm.) with a minor component of Gambel oak (Quercus
gambelii) and an understory of bracken (Pteridium aquilinum)
with several lupine (Lupinus) species. Grasses, though present,
are not dominant.
The reconstruction year was chosen as 1883 as a close
approximate
for
the
time
when
the
broad
impacts
of
Euro-American settlement began altering the natural dis-
turbance regime, species composition, and forest structure. The
year 1883 is consistent with that used by Fulé et al. (1997),
which has a close geographic proximity to our site. A prelimi-
nary analysis of fire scars from our site also indicates this as an
appropriate estimated date for the beginning of fire exclusion.
Without being fenced off, we assume that our site was freely
grazed by cattle and sheep from allotments on the surrounding
federal lands. However, the frequency, intensity, and time
frames of grazing are unknown. For the remainder of this
analysis, years prior to 1883 are referred to as pre-settlement,
historical, or historical reference conditions and proceeding

fire has been completely excluded.
Data Collection
Pre-settlement (pre-1883) and potential pre-settlement rem-
nants were censused and a 4 ha subplot was intensively analyzed
for this study (n = 875). Remnant historical and potentially his-
torical structures in the form of old trees, dead trees (snags),
the occasional stump, and downed woody debris were identified
using a diameter threshold of 37.5 cm at breast height (1.37 m)
and/or structural characteristics such as yellowing bark, thick
branches, and degree of decay (White 1985; Fulé et al. 1997).
Trees smaller than 37.5 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) were
included if they exhibited historical structural characteristics.
Species, condition class (Thomas et al. 1979), dbh, and a prelim-
inary pre-/post-settlement designation were collected for each
individual as necessary parameters for the reconstruction model
described below. The x, y location of the rooting location of each
structure was mapped using the methods of Sánchez Meador
et al. (2011). All live pine trees greater than 37.5 cm dbh were
cored at 40 cm (n = 559).
In the laboratory, cores were mounted, sanded, and
cross-dated using standard dendrochronological techniques
(Stokes & Smiley 1968). Seventy eight percent of the cores
were successfully cross-dated, of which 84 trees were of
pre-settlement origin with growth increment measurements.
Cores were used to verify pre- and post-settlement field calls
and measurements of growth rates (i.e. annual basal area
increment) were used as additional model inputs.
Contemporary stand structure was determined using trees
greater than 2.54 cm dbh that were recorded on 30 randomly
located, basal area factor 2 (metric) variable radius plots across
the study site (Kulow 1966; Puhlick 2011). For equivalent
comparison, contemporary forest structure was analyzed using
only trees greater than 12.5 cm collected from the variable
radius plots. The use of a lower threshold of 12.5 cm is described
below. Smaller (<37.5 cm) contemporary trees were not mapped
so comparative spatial analysis with contemporary conditions
was restricted to trees greater than 37.5 cm dbh.
We measured live tree crown dimensions to evaluate crown
interconnectivity and patch-level (local-level) tree patterns. The
relationship between dbh and crown radius is known to be
strong for conifers, with a power model used for ponderosa
pine (Hitchcock 1974; Sánchez Meador et al. 2011). A site spe-
cific model was developed using the arithmetic mean from radii
measurements taken at the four cardinal directions for a sub-
set of contemporary trees (n = 33, radius = 0.1744 × dbh0.7344,
R2 = 0.77, standard error of estimate = 0.38). These trees were
systematically sampled with a random starting location within
the study site. Crown radius was estimated for each recon-
structed and contemporary tree by applying this model. Calcu-
lated crown radii were then used to examine local-level spatial
patterns.
Analysis
All mapped structures were entered into a deterministic, region-
ally parameterized, individual-tree based radial growth and
decay model developed by Bakker et al. (2008) to estimate 1883
forest structures. Initial parameters needed to run the model
included: a unique tree identification number, species, dbh, a
pre- or post-settlement field call, and condition class. Site spe-
cific growth rates, when available, were used to further improve
model estimates. Due to the uncertainty associated with detect-
ing small diameter pre-settlement trees in the field, which are no
longer detectable, and our interest in overstory tree pattern, anal-
ysis for the reconstructed stand was limited to trees greater than
12.5 cm dbh. This value is consistent with the 5 inches minimum
for overstory trees specified in the U.S. Forest Service Common
Stand Exam Field Guide (USDAFS 2013) and similar to other
regional reconstructions (Sánchez Meador et al. 2011).

Unharvested ponderosa pine reference conditions
Stand-level (global-level) spatial patterns were evaluated
using Ripley’s univariate K(d) function which compares the
distances between all pairs of points (Ripley 1976) using the
Spatstat package in R v.2.14.2 (Upton & Fingleton 1985; Bad-
deley & Turner 2005). This function tests a Poisson model
with the null hypothesis that points are randomly distributed.
A square-root transformation (Besag 1977) to L(d)-d was con-
ducted to linearize the function and stabilize the variance. An
approximate 95% acceptance envelope was computed using 999
permutations of a random point pattern via Monte Carlo sim-
ulations (Upton & Fingleton 1985). Because our spatial anal-
ysis was an initial exploration and no prior information on a
range of spatial interaction was determined, the use of a good-
ness of fit test was inappropriate (Baddeley et al. 2014). This
analysis was conducted for (1) reconstructed trees greater than
12.5 cm (n = 310); (2) reconstructed trees greater than 37.5 cm
(n = 98); and (3) contemporary trees greater than 37.5 cm
(n = 529).
Within stand, patch-level (local-level) patterns for the recon-
structed (1883) stand were evaluated using sensitivity analy-
sis and a clustering algorithm that assigns trees to patches or
as individuals using a fixed inter-tree distance and interlock-
ing canopies (Plotkin et al. 2002; Sánchez Meador et al. 2011).
When only a fixed inter-tree distance of 6 m (typical value used
in dry frequent fire forests, see Larson & Churchill 2012), for
example, is used to delineate patches, trees are considered mem-
bers of the same patch if the center of the bole of two adjacent
trees is less than or equal to 6 m apart regardless of canopy size.
In this case, large trees with interlocking canopies will not be
included in a patch if their boles are greater than 6 m apart. If
only an interlocking canopy is used as patch member criteria,
small trees near each other may not be considered members of
the same patch. For example, if 10 5-cm-dbh trees are all spaced
1.2 m apart but their canopy radius is only 0.5 m, they would all
be counted as individuals instead of as members of a patch using
the canopy proximity criteria alone. Combining these methods
allows for some degree of stand development (i.e. individual tree
growth and patch recruitment) to be accounted for when refer-
ence sites are single point estimates of historical structure. Using
a fixed inter-tree distance equivalent to the third quartile of the
canopy radius of the reconstructed trees is based on the conser-
vative assumption that most of the small trees may potentially
achieve this size. For our site, this value is 5.2 m. This method
allows for large trees with interlocking canopies but located
farther apart than the fixed inter-tree distance and small trees
without interlocking canopies but closer together than the fixed
distance to be considered members of the same patch. Open-
ing values were estimated using the empty space function F(d)
(Diggle 1983; Ripley 1988; Cressie 1991).
Bivariate K12(d)-d analysis was carried out on trees greater
than 37.5 cm to examine the spatial associations between
post-settlement (>1883) and pre-settlement (<1883) trees
(>37.5 cm dbh) in terms of recruitment patterns (Goreaud &
Pelissier 2003). The intertype K12(d) function with transforma-
tion to L12(d)-d was used (Lotwick & Silverman 1982; Diggle
1983) to evaluate this relationship. The null hypothesis tested
for the independence between the locations of post-settlement
trees from the antecedent location of pre-settlement trees. A
95% acceptance envelope was constructed using 999 Monte
Carlo simulations of the null model by holding the position
of pre-settlement trees constant. This envelope was used to
evaluate deviations from the null hypothesis.
Results
1883 Reference Conditions
Overstory pine structure in 1883 had a low density and con-
tained many 35–40 cm pines and fewer very old trees (300+
years). The reconstructed stand consisted of 77 trees/ha, a
basal area of 8.0 m2/ha, and an average diameter of 36.1 cm
(Table 1). The reconstructed diameter distribution indicates a
right-skewed distribution (Fig. 2). Historical pines ranged from
12.5 to 88.0 cm dbh with large trees (>50 cm) comprising about
15% of the stand.
Prior to Euro-American settlement, the pine on our site exhib-
ited an overall spatially random pattern with few patches and
many small openings. The global-level spatial pattern indicates
significant aggregation at 1–2 m, which is driven by the smallest
diameter trees (Fig. 3). At distances greater than 2 m, the pat-
tern exhibited CSR. Sensitivity analysis indicated an asymptote
near 9 m (figure not shown), the distance at which the majority
of trees are members of a patch. Locally, trees occurred primar-
ily as individuals and trees forked at or below dbh (which were
recorded as two trees) or two trees originating immediately adja-
cent to one another (Table 2). The 1883 stand had 18 patches/ha,
61.5% of trees were a member of a patch, and the average patch
size was 2.9 trees, with rare large patches containing 7 trees.
Areas maintained as openings unoccupied by trees in the recon-
structed plot were 16.9, 35.9, 31.7, 3.5, and 0.8%, respectively
for openings of size 0–3, 3–6, 6–9, 12–15, and 15+ m in radial
distance. As such, in 1883 openings were typically less than 9 m
wide, with only one area exceeding 15 m.
Changes Since Fire Exclusion (1883–2010)
One hundred and thirty years of fire exclusion has resulted in
some drastic structural changes with increases observed in pine
density and basal area. Stand density has increased by 338% and
basal area has increased by nearly 5 times, but with little change
in average tree diameter (Table 1). The contemporary diameter
distribution indicates a reverse J-distribution with a substantial
increase in the density of small to mid-size trees (12.5–45 cm
dbh; Fig. 2) and the contemporary presence of a high proportion
of larger, young trees, and few old trees. The age distribution
indicates regular tree establishment with bimodal peaks (Fig. 4).
The first is a broad peak from 1770 to 1860 with stronger
peaks from 1790 to 1810, and 1890 to 1930, following fire
exclusion.
The period of fire exclusion has also resulted in a conversion
in spatial patterning. The contemporary stand is significantly
aggregated from 1 to 65 m suggesting a single large patch
(Fig. 5). Conversely, the pattern of large diameter pre-settlement
trees is significantly random at all distances.

Post-Settlement Recruitment Patterns
Recruitment of post-settlement trees under fire exclusion
appears unaffected by existing stand structure at most dis-
tances. Bivariate Ripley’s K12 analysis shows a positive spatial
association (i.e. attraction) with pre-settlement trees at short
distances (1–7 m) and spatial independence at distances greater
than 7 m (Fig. 6). The initial positive peak is likely driven
by the strong 1–2 m aggregation peak in the contemporary
spatial pattern. The majority of post-settlement recruitment
was unaffected by the presence of pre-settlement trees sug-
gesting that regeneration was simply filling any available
growing space.
Discussion
1883 Reference Conditions
The 1883 reference conditions examined in this study extend
the natural range of variation captured by reference sites for
frequent fire forests and provide a useful addition and con-
trast to previously studied reference sites. We suspect the
underlying abiotic conditions of our site, with limestone soils,
higher regional precipitation (64.7 > 35–55 cm; Harrod et al.
1999; Youngblood et al. 2004; Abella & Denton 2009; Sánchez
Meador et al. 2009), and moderate temperatures (16.9∘C) asso-
ciated with its geographic position on the edge of the Mogol-
lon Rim, contribute to the site’s productivity (28 vs. 14–19 m;
Sánchez Meador & Moore 2010) and observed structural and
spatial differences compared with other regional sites that are
dominated by xeric conditions and basalt soils (Puhlick 2012;
Reynolds et al. 2013).
Our reconstructed 1883 stand structure is consistent with a
low density, open stand. The historical density of 77 trees/ha
and basal area of 8.0 m2/ha is on the lower end of the range of
other regional reconstructions on both basalt and limestone sites
(Harrod et al. 1999; Youngblood et al. 2004; summarized in
Reynolds et al. 2013). The uneven aged, flat, right-skewed dis-
tribution of historical diameters is similar to others in the region
(White 1985; Harrod et al. 1999; Sánchez Meador et al. 2011)
but inconsistent with the more common, pre-settlement reverse
J-distribution (Savage 1991; Bailey & Covington 2002; Fulé
et al. 2002). A pre-settlement reverse J may have been possi-
ble at our site based on contemporary regeneration density esti-
mates (Puhlick et al. 2012); however, the historical frequency
of seedling mortality agents (i.e. fire, herbaceous competition)
would have limited the necessary rates of establishment to pro-
duce this distribution (VanHorne & Fulé 2006; Sánchez Meador
et al. 2011). A smaller historical mean tree diameter compared
to contemporary conditions is inconsistent with previous stud-
ies where mean tree diameter almost always decreases as stand
density increases, limiting individual growth (Reynolds et al.
2013). However, the difference in size is about 2.5 cm (1.0 inch).
We suspect that the reconstructed trees, although not very large
in diameter on average were taller than most regionally simi-
lar sites based on comparing site index values (height of 28 vs.
14–19 m at 100 years; Minor 1964), suggesting trees were allo-
cating more resources to height than girth.
We observed a historical, global-level, random spatial dis-
tribution of pine in our pre-settlement stand, which is similar
to other moist, fertile sites, but deviates from the more com-
mon aggregated pattern in more arid conditions (Abella & Den-
ton 2009; Larson & Churchill 2012). Working in the same
area and under similar abiotic conditions, Abella and Denton
(2009) found CSR in one-third of their mesic limestone plots
and the other two-thirds were significantly aggregated. Across
the southwestern ponderosa pine environment types, 29% of all
plots exhibited CSR from 1 to 25 m and 71% exhibited some
degree of aggregation. Youngblood et al. (2004) also observed
CSR on one-third of their plots in the Pacific Northwest. Due to
the rarity of CSR, causal mechanisms are virtually absent from
the literature. Harrod et al. (1999) suggest that the lesser degree
of aggregation on warm, wet sites is due to site productivity
manifested in greater densities. Abella and Denton (2009) found
that spatial characteristics were strongly correlated with density,

which they suggest is more sensitive to environmental character-

story vegetation have been identified as multivariate factors that
influence recruitment densities and, indirectly, forest spatial pat-
terns (Abella & Denton 2009; Puhlick et al. 2012). Youngblood
et al. (2004) suggest that frequent fire shaped both aggregated
and random spatial patterns. We speculate that the observed ran-
dom spatial pattern is likely caused by a more homogeneous
partitioning of resources across the site due to the homogeneity
of limestone parent material across our site and moisture regime.
The uniform abundance of nutrients and the absence of water
stress, except in the most severe droughts, seem to have elimi-
nated isolated pockets of amendable soil moisture and nutrient
conditions that often drive patterns of aggregation (USFS 1995;
Allen et al. 2002; Baddeley 2008; Abella & Denton 2009).
A complex of abiotic conditions likely controlled historical
stand development. From field observations, we suspect that
dense pine regeneration occurred primarily in newly formed
canopy gaps that were influenced by intense understory com-
petition and highly frequent fire, every 2.0–8.5 years (Huffman
et al. 2015), due to its geographic location with one of the high-
est lightning strike rates in the nation (Dieterich 1980; Cov-
ington & Moore 1994b; VanHorne & Fulé 2006). Seedlings

and saplings that survived fire were likely aggregated but with-
out belowground resource limitations, light became the limiting
agent driving a size hierarchy within the group until one or
two dominants emerged, suppressing and eliminating the oth-
ers (Mast & Veblen 1999). Bi (2004) has shown that the degree
of self-thinning increases with increasing soil fertility, suggest-
ing that this process may be more important at more produc-
tive sites such as ours. Although this form of competition is
thought to ultimately lead to uniform patterns, Kenkel (1988)
found few studies that convincingly demonstrated this. The pro-
cess of intraspecific competition may lead to low levels of crown
interconnectivity, the occasional group of two or three trees, and
a global-level random distribution with greater inter-tree dis-
tances than aggregated stands.

line is the observed pattern. Above the shaded region indicates aggregation and below regularity in spatial distribution.
The within stand spatial patterns of the reconstructed forest
is characterized by small tree patches (2–3 trees) and small
openings (7 m). Sensitivity analysis indicates that most trees at
our site became a member of a patch at a limiting distance of
9 m or more. Previous studies in frequent fire pine forests have
found and used a limiting distance around 6 m which accounted
for 80–90% of pre-settlement trees as patch members. A 6-m
limiting distance included only 60% of trees at our site (Abella
& Denton 2009; Sánchez Meador et al. 2011; Churchill et al.
2013). Yet, crown allometry is very similar to that described
in the study of Sánchez Meador et al. (2011). This suggests
that although pre-settlement trees regionally had similar crown
dimensions, those on more productive sites may be more prone
to a random distribution. The number of patches/ha at our site
falls within the range found by Abella and Denton (2009) and
Sánchez Meador et al. (2011). However, the high percentage
of individual trees is inconsistent with previous reconstruc-
tions that have examined local-level patterns (Sánchez Meador
et al. 2009, 2011; Churchill et al. 2013). The wider 9 m
inter-tree distance, small openings, and large number of indi-
viduals is consistent with Harrod et al.’s (1999) suggestion
that productivity leads to smaller patches and few large
openings.
Currently, within stand patches are determined structurally
as consisting of two or more trees with interlocking or adja-
cent crowns (Sánchez Meador et al. 2011; Churchill et al. 2013;
Lydersen et al. 2013; Fry et al. 2014). Although there is no evi-
dence to support that two trees function as any less of a patch,
we suggest that many of the trees in immediate proximity of
a neighbor (a tree forked at or below dbh or two trees immedi-
ately adjacent to one another) at our site are functioning more as
individual trees. Research into within patch tree dynamics and
functioning would improve our ecological understanding of the
functional role of spatial patterns and help determine if a func-
tional definition of a patch, or a combined structure–function
delineation may be more appropriate than a strictly structural
definition. Delineation by function may also change what spatial
patterns are historically observed.

following 130 years of fire exclusion. The 338% increase in pine
density since fire exclusion is consistent with previous studies
that have recorded increases of 100–616% on basalt soils and
394–7,000% on limestone sites since the onset of fire exclusion
(Abella et al. 2011; see Reynolds et al. 2013 for a review). The
most significant change has been to the fire regime and these
results reinforce the essential role of fire in regulating regenera-
tion densities (Cooper 1960; Covington & Moore 1994a, 1994b;
Goodwin 2004). An increase in basal area is also consistent
with regional post-settlement changes in forest structure (Fulé
et al. 1997; Moore et al. 2004). Little change in the average tree
diameter suggests that the 1883 stand was relatively young and
post-settlement regeneration was not space, nutrient, or water
limited.
Following fire exclusion, our unharvested old-growth stand
underwent a spatial pattern conversion from CSR to an aggre-
gated post-settlement spatial pattern. The presence of a single
aggregated patch suggests that current trees have filled all avail-
able growing space (Sánchez Meador et al. 2009). The presence
of a random pre-settlement pattern makes this conversion incon-
sistent with previous studies that have found an increase in the
distance of aggregation, from small-scale pre-settlement aggre-
gation to aggregation at the plot level (Sánchez Meador et al.
2009, 2011; Sánchez Meador & Moore 2010). However, a con-
temporary single, stand-level patch is consistent with other spa-
tial analyses.
Post-Settlement Recruitment
Although mechanism(s) influencing recruitment are known to
be complex, in southwestern ponderosa pine forests, recruit-
ment has been shown to be repelled from pre-settlement trees
up to 28 m; a phenomenon largely attributed to shade intol-
erance (Mast & Veblen 1999; Sánchez Meador et al. 2011).
However, frequent fire often killed seedlings and saplings in
open areas and survivors were located in or around exist-
ing patches, which provided refugia from fire (White 1985).
At our site, post-settlement pine recruitment was attracted to
pre-settlement trees at short distances (1–6 m) and independent
at distances greater than 6 m. The attraction at short distances
is likely attributed to the pairs and triplets observed at short
distances as a product of seed dispersal mechanisms. Indepen-
dent post-settlement recruitment with random pre-settlement
tree locations suggests that regenerating trees were simply fill-
ing available growing space. These conditions are likely due to
the lack of frequent fire, reduced herbaceous competition, and a
more homogeneous distribution of resources.
Management Implications
This study provides managers and scientists with an example of
the natural range of variability that exists within the ponderosa
pine type and a description of a relatively rare, unharvested,
productive site that is underrepresented in the body of knowl-
edge about reference conditions. Determining the underlying
processes that have created these conditions may provide
researchers and managers with a greater understanding of stand
development and community dynamics. The stand conditions
outlined above may be used as a basis for structural and
process restoration objectives aimed at restoring ecosystem
health. Because the global-level pattern of our site was random,
directly translating the patch-level spatial parameters into
marking guidelines may arbitrarily aggregate the site unless
a range of inter-tree distances is used in prescription devel-
opment. Because this translation of pattern and structure (i.e.
random global-level patterns with local patch-level attributes) is
complicated, it will likely be difficult to implement. We suggest
that patch-level based treatments be used with caution when a
site exhibits a spatially random global-level spatial pattern and
managers might consider treatments that do not emphasize

The reference values included also provide qualitative and
quantitative ranges for comparing contemporary deviations that
may be used to predict future stand development. However,
the unique nature of this site precludes its extrapolation to the
landscape level or beyond sites with comparable biotic and
abiotic attributes.
