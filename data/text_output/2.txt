Summary 
 
1. Background 
 
After a century of fire suppression, logging, and grazing, conifer forests in the 
southwestern United States have undergone a dramatic departure from conditions that 
existed prior to Euro-American settlement.  Today’s ponderosa pine and mixed 
conifer forests are characterized by homogenous, dense, small-diameter stands that 
are susceptible to stand-replacing crown fires.  There is now an emphasis on 
ecological restoration in the Southwest, whereby forests are thinned, burned, or both 
to approximate presettlement structural conditions.  Ecological restoration treatments 
expose wildlife species to short- and long-term alterations to their habitat.  Treatments 
are an effort to return forest structure and composition to within the range of natural 
variability, which should benefit native wildlife species.  However, both thinning and 
burning treatments are being implemented across thousands of acres of forest in the 
southwestern United States, with limited quantitative data regarding wildlife 
responses.  Individual species have been studied, but no review exists that 
quantitatively examine the effects of thinning and burning treatments on multiple 
wildlife species in a systematic review framework.   
 
 
2. Objectives 
 
Primary objective: How do thinning and burning treatments in southwestern conifer 
forests in the United States affect wildlife density and population performance? 
 
Secondary objective: Which wildlife species are most vulnerable to habitat 
alteration?  How do the impacts of thinning and burning treatments compare to those 
of selective harvesting, wildfire, and overstory removal? 
 
 
3. Methods 
 
To identify studies relevant to our review, we searched databases supported by 
Northern Arizona University during September-December 2008, using a defined 
combination of search terms.  We then eliminated papers, first based on title, then 
abstract, then full text, based on a set of criteria that specified the review subject 
(wildlife species in southwestern conifer forests), intervention (small-diameter tree 
removal, burning, thin and burn, selective harvest, wildfire, or overstory removal), 
comparator (untreated control), and outcome (density, abundance, or reproductive 
response variable, including recruitment, number of offspring, percent offspring 
survival, etc.).  We assessed study quality based on whether the study was replicated 
and/or peer-reviewed, and applied a weighting factor (sampling area) to data used in 
the quantitative analysis.  Other covariates included treatment, forest type, time since 
treatment, species, study type, density estimation method, replication, quality of 
study, and study (identifying the origin of the data).  We identified data that met the 
requirements of meta-analysis, calculated effect sizes using the response ratio metric, 
built generalized linear models to predict effect size based on covariates, and 
identified the most parsimonious model using a model selection approach.  Each 

 
4 
covariate in the best-fitting model was examined via forest plots by calculating mean 
effect sizes with bootstrapped confidence intervals.  Data that were not appropriate for 
meta-analysis were analyzed using vote-counting techniques.   
 
 
4. Main results 
 
Our review identified 56 relevant studies, which were dominated by avian studies and 
generally occurred less than 10 years post-treatment.  Although the qualitative 
analysis resulted in broadly neutral or positive responses to treatments in terms of 
species abundances, the meta-analysis revealed a pattern of generally positive density 
responses to the restoration-like treatments (small-diameter removal, burning, and 
thin/burn) and negative responses to the high-severity treatments (wildfire and 
overstorey removal).  We recorded more positive responses by individual species to 
the high-severity treatments using the qualitative analysis compared to the meta-
analytic approach.  Reproductive responses were generally positive in the restoration 
treatments and negative in the high-severity treatments, but were compromised by low 
numbers of observations.  Overall, thinning and/or burning did not negatively affect 
species’ abundances or densities compared to unmanaged forest stands, and were less 
detrimental than overstorey removal or wildfire.   
 
 
5. Conclusions 
 
This review suggests that thinning and prescribed burning of southwestern ponderosa 
pine and dry mixed conifer forests will benefit passerine birds and small mammals.  
Based on the existing literature, small-diameter removal and/or burning does not 
negatively affect species’ densities compared to unmanaged forest stands, and is less 
detrimental than overstorey removal or wildfire.  However, no one treatment 
benefitted all species, at least in the short term.  Thus, a combination of various 
treatments in a patchy arrangement in time and space across the landscape is likely to 
result in higher diversity than any one treatment. 
 
The majority of studies in the analysis examined responses of birds to treatment, and 
we suggest that existing studies be carefully consulted before initiating similar 
research in order to eliminate duplication of effort.  Other under- or unrepresented 
taxa include reptiles and amphibians, rare birds and small mammals, medium and 
large mammals, including both predators and ungulates, and birds of prey.  
Furthermore, the lack of studies that assess reproductive responses across all species 
indicates a paucity of research on this important fitness parameter.  Finally, studies 
need to be conducted at larger temporal and spatial scales in order to understand both 
short- and long-term implications of treatments at the landscape level.

1. 
Background 
 
After a century of fire suppression, logging, and grazing, conifer forests in the 
southwestern United States have undergone a dramatic departure from conditions that 
existed prior to Euro-American settlement (Covington and Moore, 1994, Swetnam et 
al., 1999, Cooper, 1960).  Today’s ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and mixed 
conifer (Abies lasiocarpa, P. flexilis, P. ponderosa, Populus tremuloides, 
Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests are characterized by homogenous, dense, small-
diameter stands that are susceptible to stand-replacing crown fires (Fulé et al., 1997, 
Cocke et al., 2005).  This differs from the natural fire regime that occurred on a 2-25 
cycle at low intensity, which would maintain forests by removing small diameter 
trees, freeing up space and resources (Moore et al., 1999).  The results was an open, 
patchy forest structure of mostly mature trees with a herbaceous ground cover 
(Covington and Moore, 1994, Waltz et al., 2003).  There is now an emphasis on 
ecological restoration in the Southwest, whereby forests are thinned, burned, or both 
to approximate presettlement structural conditions.   
 
Ecological restoration treatments expose wildlife species to short- and long-term 
alterations to their habitat.  In the short-term, both mechanical harvesting of trees and 
prescribed fire are disturbance events that have immediate effects on the environment: 
removing or killing live trees, reducing shrub and herbaceous ground cover, altering 
structural components such as snags and downed woody material, and creating sites 
susceptible to colonization by  invasive plant species (Chambers and Germaine, 
2003).  In the long term, successful restoration treatments should create a forest with a 
decreased density of trees compared to today’s conditions, but increased 
heterogeneity in tree sizes and overall greater basal area due to the prevalence and 
growth of large, mature trees with a fairly open canopy (Moore et al., 1999, Cooper, 
1961).  In addition, such treatments should increase understory plant cover and 
species diversity (Waltz et al., 2003).  This increased spatial and temporal 
heterogeneity should diversify the composition and structure of habitat available for 
wildlife (Allen et al., 2002).   
 
Wildlife responses to forest treatments vary widely; generally, it is assumed that 
treatments which restore conditions consistent with those animals have experienced 
over evolutionary time will have more beneficial effects than treatments that create 
novel conditions (Noss and Csuti, 1994, Lindenmayer and Franklin, 2002, Soule, 
1985).  High severity disturbances such as clearcutting and wildfire (Anthony and 
Isaacs, 1989, Grialou et al., 2000, Cunningham et al., 2002) and unnaturally dense or 
open conditions (Brown and Davis, 1998, Shick et al., 2006) can have negative 
impacts on animal species, particularly in the short term, because of habitat alteration.  
Ecological restoration treatments are an effort to return forest structure and 
composition to within the range of natural variability, which should benefit native 
wildlife species (Allen et al., 2002). 
 
Due to the urgent need to implement restoration treatments to reduce fire risk, both 
thinning and burning treatments are being implemented across thousands of acres of 
forest in the southwestern United States, but with limited understanding of the 

 
6 
implications to wildlife.  Ecological restoration treatments have only been 
implemented in the last 20 years, and thus the corresponding studies on wildlife are 
relatively recent and limited in temporal and spatial scale.  Individual species have 
been studied, but no review exists that analyzes the existing literature across taxa. 
Existing reviews include summaries of impacts of thinning and burning treatments on 
birds (Block and Finch, 1997, Bock and Block, 2005a, Bock and Block, 2005b, 
Sallabanks et al., 2000) and qualitative reviews that described effects of thinning and 
fire on multiple wildlife species (Lyon et al., 2000, Pilliod and Bull, 2006, Chambers 
and Germaine, 2003).  The reviews point to individual species’ increases or decreases 
in responses to treatments, but have difficulty generalizing across studies due to the 
variability in response variables, treatments, sites, and species.  None of these reviews 
quantitatively examined the effects of thinning and burning treatments on multiple 
wildlife species in a systematic review framework.   
 
The objective of this review is to systematically review and evaluate the impacts of 
tree density-reducing treatments, including thinning and burning, on wildlife 
vertebrate species in conifer forests in the south-western United States.  Not all 
thinning and burning treatments are strictly “restoration treatments,” as the goal of the 
treatments may be to simply reduce fire risk and not necessarily to restore stands to a 
structure and function similar to that of pre-settlement conditions.  Thus, we will 
separately identify the effects of thinning, burning, and thin/burn treatments, which all 
share some elements of restoration treatments, with the thin/burn treatments most 
inline with the goals of ecological restoration.  We compared the treatments to 
controls, as well as to more severe forest treatments including highgrading, 
clearcutting, and high severity wildfire.  This review will serve as a starting point for 
researchers and managers in understanding the comprehensive impacts on wildlife of 
ecological restoration treatments and determining future monitoring and research 
needs.

Question formulation 
 
We contacted 20 wildlife managers and scientists from a range of government and 
academic institutions, including Northern Arizona University (NAU), Arizona Game 

 
7 
and Fish Department, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the U.S. Forest Service.  
We sent them an email questionnaire giving them specific criteria with which to 
evaluate and modify our proposed question.  We received 9 responses that helped us 
revise the question.  In addition, the team of authors representing the Ecological 
Restoration Institute, Northern Arizona University School of Forestry, and Arizona 
Game and Fish Department further refined the question.

After conducting the databases search we eliminated papers if they did not meet the 
following criteria: 
 Relevant subject(s): Vertebrate species that live in ponderosa pine or mixed 
conifer forests in the southwestern United States, including 
o Birds 
o Mammals 
o Reptiles 
o Amphibians

 Types of intervention: 
o Small-diameter removal (removal of small-diameter trees; included 
thinning and shelterwood treatments) 
o Burn (low-to-moderate severity prescribed fire) 
o Thin and burn 
o Selective harvest (individual tree selection, highgrading) 
o Wildfire (high severity fire) 
o Overstory removal (clearcut) 
 Types of comparator: 
o Experiments with controls (dense forest) and treatments 
(thinned/burned forest), either control-impact (C-I) or before-after 
(BACI) 
 Types of outcome:  
o Abundance 
o Density 
o Reproductive output, as defined by number of successful nests, number 
of offspring, and/or survival rates of offspring 
 
We considered all types of studies, include peer-reviewed, grey literature (government 
documents and theses), and observational and qualitative studies.  The primary 
reviewer conducted the initial database searches, and eliminated irrelevant papers 
based on title, using the above criteria.  The resulting list was examined by both the 
primary and a secondary reviewer, who eliminated irrelevant articles based on 
abstracts.  Agreement between reviewers was evaluated by an inter-rater agreement 
(Kappa) test (Altman, 1990).  The primary reviewer then eliminated studies based on 
the full text papers. 
 
Among studies, there is heterogeneity in the distribution of species across different 
forest types, elevation, and topography in conifer forests in the southwestern U.S.  
There is also variation in the application of thinning and burning treatments, including 
intensity, spatial extent, and duration.  This variability was addressed using multiple 
predictor variables (see Section 3.5).   
 
 
3.4 
Study quality assessment 
 
For the qualitative and quantitative analysis, we identified three covariates that 
assessed study quality: abundance or density estimation method (with or without 
detection probability), replication, quality of study (peer-reviewed or not).  In the 
qualitative analysis, we presented summary statistics of the number of studies that did 
and did not fall into these categories.   
 
For the quantitative analysis, we used the covariates as predictor variables in our 
model selection analysis to determine if they had an effect on the response variable 
(see section 3.6).  Furthermore, we applied a weighting scheme to our models to 
account for the reliability of results from large versus small studies.  In most meta-
analyses the inverse of the standard deviation is used to weight studies; however, in 
wildlife studies, the standard deviation between replicate means is often (1) 
unreported, (2) unavailable because sample size is one, or (3) not meaningful because 
the size of a replicate varies dramatically from study to study.  Here, we used the 

 
9 
natural log of the area sampled as a biologically meaningful weighting scheme, 
similar to Mosquera et al. (2000). Further methods involving the weighting scheme 
are provided in section 3.6.   
 
 
3.5 
Data extraction 
 
We built a database to record the data extraction process for the analysis; this helped 
determine which papers (of the final set) were relevant to qualitative versus 
quantitative analysis.  The primary reviewer read the full text of each study and 
recorded the species evaluated, density or reproductive output data, and covariates 
including treatment, forest type, time since treatment, species, study type (BACI or C-
I), density estimation method (with or without detection probability), replication 
(replicated or not), quality of study (peer-reviewed or not), and study (where each 
study was assigned a unique identifier, since some studies have multiple observations) 
(Appendix 1).  Data were separated by year and site whenever possible. If some data 
were missing from a paper we attempted to contact authors to acquire it. Studies 
lacking quantitative data were assigned to the qualitative analysis.  
 
 
3.6 
Data synthesis 
 
We used vote counting to incorporate the results of studies that could not be 
incorporated into the meta-analysis, and tabulated the number of observations that 
produced positive, neutral, or negative responses to the treatments and reported the 
“winner” across the categories.  For the individual species (abundance and 
reproduction response variables), we summed the positive responses (each given a 
value of 1) and negative responses (each given a value of -1) for an overall score; this 
was to improve readability of our results, but also because many “neutral” results 
(each given a value of 0) were attributable to a lack of data, not a true neutral response 
to treatment.  In addition, we eliminated all species for which there was only a single 
observation across all studies, in order to improve data quality. 
 
For the meta-analysis, we calculated effect sizes using the response ratio metric: 
ln(treatment mean/control mean) (Hedges et al., 1999).  Using JMP 8.0.2 (SAS 
Institute Inc. 2009), we built generalized linear models, weighted using the natural log 
of the area sampled (see Section 3.4), to predict effect size based on covariates (see 
Section 3.5).  We developed a priori models hypothesized to best predict effect size, 
and then used a model selection approach to identify the most parsimonious model 
(Burnham and Anderson, 2002).  This allowed us to address non-independence of 
data, as the “study” effect was assessed relative to the other covariates.  We compared 
models using Akaike’s Information Criterion adjusted for small sample sizes (AICc) 
to assess the overall strength of each model, ranked the models from highest to lowest 
according to their ∆AICc values, and then chose those models with ∆AICc <2 as the 
final set to be used for inference (Burnham and Anderson, 2002).  We performed 
separate analyses using weighted and unweighted generalized linear models.  There 
was no difference in the results; thus, we reported only unweighted model results.  We 
calculated the Akaike weight (wi) for each model as a measure of model support.  
Each covariate in the best-fitting model(s) was examined using Metawin software 

 
10 
(Rosenberg et al., 2000), with which we calculated mean effect sizes with 
bootstrapped confidence intervals using forest plots (Adams et al., 1997).     
 
 
 
4. 
RESULTS 
 
4.1 
Review statistics 
 
 
All studies retrieved were stored in a RefWorks reference manager database 
(www.refworks.com, supported by NAU) and assigned and YES or NO ranking after 
each stage of culling.  The initial database search produced 6,908 studies.  The 
primary reviewer performed a cull using our criteria (Section 3.3) based on the titles, 
which produced 367 studies.  At this point, we made the decision to focus only on 
southwestern conifer forests, due to the volume of papers and variety of species 
involved in multiple geographic regions. We identified 229 studies after eliminating 
those not conducted in the Southwest.   
 
The primary reviewer then culled based on abstract which produced 76 studies.  A 
second reviewer performed the same cull on 30% of the studies, with a Kappa statistic 
of 0.79 (out of 1.00) which is considered “good” agreement (Altman, 1990).  We then 
read all remaining full text articles, and used our data extraction form (Appendix 1) to 
determine if the studies were appropriate for the qualitative or quantitative analysis.  
A total of 36 studies were removed at this stage.  We added studies based on leads in 
other papers’ literature cited sections and the literature reviews we examined, and sent 
our draft reference list to several agency stakeholders to review for omissions.  A total 
of 16 additional studies were identified.   
 
4.2 
Description of studies 
 
Our review produced 56 relevant studies.  We determined that 22 studies reported 
density and were suitable for meta-analysis (number of observations [N]=1,095); 39 
reported abundance or presence-absence response variables that were not appropriate 
for the meta-analysis (N=1,580), and 12 reported reproductive response variables 
(N=59) (Table 1).  The number of observations is different than the number of studies 
because many studies reported multiple species, treatments, years, and/or response 
variables, and thus resulted in multiple observations.  Appendices 2 and 3 list studies 
used in qualitative and quantitative analyses, respectively.

We also tallied the number of observations per class (bird, mammal, or reptile) and 
found that the literature was dominated by avian studies (90% of the total 
observations), mostly focused on songbirds (Table 2).  The reptile observations 
consisted solely of lizard studies, and the mammal observations consisted mostly of 
rodents (58% of the mammal observations; Table 2).

Study quality assessment  
 
 
For the qualitative analysis, we found that most studies were replicated (Table 3).  
Most studies did not consider detection in their abundance or reproductive output 
estimates, and were not published in the peer-reviewed literature (Table 3).

For the quantitative analysis, the three covariates that assessed study quality 
(abundance or density estimation method, replication, whether the study was peer-
reviewed) used as predictor variables did not have an effect on the response variable 
in our model selection analysis (see section 4.5).   
 
4.4 
Qualitative synthesis  
 
Data that spanned 1-25 years post-treatment were available for the qualitative 
analysis.  Across the studies that assessed some measure of abundance, the small-
diameter removal, burn, thin/burn, and wildfire had mostly neutral effects on wildlife, 
and the second-most commonly observed effects were positive (Figure 1).  The 
selective harvest and the overstory removal had mostly positive effects.  Across the 
reproduction studies, the small-diameter removal elicited mostly neutral responses 
while the second-most commonly observed effects were negative; the burn, selective 
harvest, and wildfire produced mostly negative responses, and the thin/burn resulted 
in mostly positive responses (Figure 2).  We found no studies on reproductive 
responses to overstory removals.

In response to the combined small-diameter removal, burning, and thin/burn 
(restoration) treatments we found that 27 species exhibited a positive response, 11 a 
neutral response, and 18 a negative response (Table 4).  In response to the high-
severity treatments (wildfire and overstorey removal), 68 species demonstrated a 
positive response, 14 a neutral response, and 28 a negative response (Table 4).  
Special status species included one with a positive response to high severity 
treatments (northern goshawk), two with neutral responses (Mexican spotted owl and 
Peregrine falcon), and one with a negative response (flammulated owl) (Table 4).

Reproductive data indicated that 3 species responded positively, 1 neutrally, and 2 
negatively to restoration treatments; 2 species responded negatively to high-severity 
treatments; however, the number of observations was low for most species (Table 5).  
One special status species, the Mexican spotted owl, responded negatively to high-
severity treatments in terms of reproduction.

Meta-analysis  
 
The model (ΔAICc<2) that best predicted wildlife response to treatments with 83% of 
model weight included the variables treatment, species, time since treatment, and 
study (Table 6).  The second best model with 17% of model weight also included the 
study design variable.

Mean effect sizes (MES) for treatments showed that species responded positively to 
the small-diameter removal and the burning treatment, negatively to the wildfire and 
overstorey removal treatment, but did not differ from zero for the thin/burn and 
selective harvest (Figure 3).  We conducted the same analysis for 11 species for which 
there were data available for every treatment (American robin, chipping sparrow, 
dark-eyed junco, western bluebird, mountain chickadee, Steller’s jay, western tanager, 
yellow-rumped warbler, pygmy nuthatch, white-breasted nuthatch, and hairy 
woodpecker), and found a similar pattern (Figure 3).

observations, a) across all species for the 6 treatment types, and b) for only the 11 
species for which data were available in each of the 6 treatment types.  See section 3.3 
for a full description of the treatments. 
 
 
Species’ overall effect size averaged across the small-diameter removal, burning, and 
thin/burn (restoration) treatments was positive (MES = 0.5); the overall species effect 
size averaged across the wildfire and clearcut was negative (MES = -2.6).  Fourteen 
species had a strong positive response to restoration treatments, in that their 
confidence interval (CI) did not overlap zero; 4 species had a strong negative response 
to restoration treatments (Figure 4).  Nine species had a strong positive response to 
the wildfire and clearcut; 18 species that had a strong negative response (Figure 5).

Time since treatment ranged from 1 to 20 years, however most studies examined 
responses less than 10 years post-treatment (Figure 6).  Time since treatment had an 
overall negative effect on species density responses (slope = -0.35; Figure 6), and a 
slightly negative effect on species density responses in restoration treatments (slope = 
-0.08).

The presence of study as a variable in our top model (Table 5) indicated a lack of 
independence among observations from the same study, similar to a site effect. 
 
Study design was an additional variable that appeared in the second best model (Table 
5); BACI designs had a higher mean effect size (MES=0.75; CI 0.39-1.15; N=203) 
than did C-I designs (MES=-0.94; CI -1.25 to -0.65; N=892).

Outcome of the review 
 
Although the qualitative analysis resulted in broadly neutral or positive responses to 
treatments in terms of species abundances, the meta-analysis revealed a pattern of 
generally positive responses to the restoration treatments and negative responses to 
the high-severity treatments.  We recorded more positive responses by individual 
species to the high-severity treatments using the qualitative analysis compared to the 
meta-analytic approach.  Reproductive responses were generally positive in the 
restoration treatments and negative in the high-severity treatments, but were 
compromised by low numbers of observations.  Overall, small-diameter removal 
and/or burning did not negatively affect species’ densities compared to unmanaged 
forest stands, and was less detrimental than overstorey removal or wildfire.

Discussion 
 
5.1 
Evidence of and variation in effectiveness 
 
The meta-analysis approach worked well in summarizing the density response of 
multiple species across different treatments over time at a coarse scale.  We had a 
clear best model in our model selection analysis with 83% of the weight that 
contained meaningful covariates (i.e., the null and global models performed poorly in 
comparison).  We elucidated clear patterns of density responses to treatments, with 
non-overlapping confidence intervals, including positive responses to thinning and 
burning, neutral responses to thin/burn and selective harvest, and negative responses 
to wildfire and overstorey removal.  The qualitative analysis revealed a similar pattern 
except it recorded more positive response in the wildfire and overstorey removal 
treatments.   
 
There was general agreement between the qualitative and meta-analysis in terms of 
species responses with some exceptions: the house wren, northern flicker, violet-green 
swallow, pygmy nuthatch, chipping sparrow, and dark-eyed junco responded 
negatively or neutrally to restoration treatments according to the meta-analysis, but 
positively according to the qualitative analysis.  The mountain chickadee, Steller’s 
jay, Grace’s warbler, yellow-rumped warbler, American robin, and spotted towhee 
responded positively or neutrally to restoration treatments according to the meta-
analysis, but negatively according to the qualitative analysis.  Thus, 12 of 34 species 
showed inconsistent responses.   
 
Similarly, the violet-green swallow, white-breasted nuthatch, American three-toed 
woodpecker, Steller’s jay, western tanager, mourning dove, hairy woodpecker, 
northern flicker, warbling vireo, dark-eyed junco, and western wood-pewee responded 
negatively or neutrally to high-severity treatments according to the meta-analysis, but 
positively according to the qualitative analysis, while the yellow-bellied sapsucker 
and chipping sparrow responded positively to treatment according to the meta-
analysis but negatively according to the qualitative analysis.  Thus, 13 of 41 species 
had inconsistent results.  The reason for this may be that qualitative analysis was 
dominated by wildfire studies compared to overstory removal (1,109 observations 
versus 62) and thus we may be seeing a more positive response by species that 
respond negatively to clearcut but positively to wildfire, especially since fire severity 
varied among studies. 
 
The qualitative analysis used less rigorous statistical methods and smaller sample 
sizes than did the meta-analysis.  Further, although vote-counting is not uncommon in 
the ecological literature, it can be misleading because the method has low statistical 
power, with the results tending toward zero as the sample size increases (Gurevitch 
and Hedges, 1999).  Thus, we suggest that the meta-analysis produced the most 
reliable conclusions, and the qualitative analysis should be consulted only for species 
that could not be evaluated in the meta-analysis.

5.2 
Review limitations 
 
A drawback of the review is that we were unable to quantify fine-scale effects on 
wildlife.  The model selection analysis shows that there are similarities between 
density responses measured in the same study and using the same site; thus, there 
must be other important within-site variables that we did not use as covariates in our 
analysis.  Some may include characteristics of the control stands, post-treatment tree 
density or basal area, treatment intensity, seasonality of treatments, overstory 
composition, number of snags, and understory characteristics, as these variables were 
not consistently reported in the literature. 
 
Meta-analysis was restrictive in the types of response variables that could be 
analyzed.  Only animal density could be compared in treatments versus controls 
across different taxa, thus we included other responses such as home range size, 
abundance, and presence-absence in our qualitative analysis to the extent possible.  
Since fitness is often viewed as the best indicator of population performance (Bock 
and Jones, 2004), we compared density and reproductive output results and found that 
both were consistent in treatments versus controls (either both positive or both 
negative) for the plumbeous vireo and western tanager (Battin and Sisk, 2003), 
western bluebird (Wightman and Germaine, 2006, Germaine and Germaine, 2002, 
Hurteau et al., in press), and tassel-eared squirrel (Dodd et al., 2006).  However, black 
bear had similar densities pre- and post-fire, and in burned areas versus control, but 
lower reproductive output in the burned areas (Cunningham et al., 2003).  It is well-
documented in the literature that density is often a misleading indication of habitat 
quality (Van Horne, 1983); thus, assessing wildlife density may not always be 
meaningful in terms of understanding changes in habitat.  Yet, most studies in our 
review used this response variable presumably because reproductive output is more 
difficult, time consuming, and costly to measure.   
 
 
6. 
Reviewers’ Conclusions 
 
6.1 
Implications for management  
 
This meta-analysis suggests that thinning and prescribed burning of southwestern 
ponderosa pine and dry mixed conifer forests will benefit passerine birds and small 
mammals.  Based on the existing literature, small-diameter removal and/or burning 
does not negatively affect species’ densities compared to unmanaged forest stands, 
and are less detrimental than overstorey removal or wildfire.  These results support 
the hypothesis that thinning and burning at the landscape level are consistent with 
ecological restoration objectives for wildlife.  However, wildfire and clearcuts have 
overall negative effects on wildlife density and should be used with caution.  For 
example, clearcut fuel breaks will likely have negative impacts on species, but may 
prevent wildfire from spreading and thus reduce overall species loss.   
 
No one treatment benefitted all species, at least over the short term.  Even within the 
small-diameter removal treatment, which had the greatest overall positive effect of the 
six treatments on species densities, house wrens and red-faced warblers responded 
negatively relative to the controls.  This could be due to their need for understory 
vegetation for foraging (house wrens) and nesting (red-faced warblers) (Wheye et al., 

 
23 
1988).  Similarly, the negative density response of the Mexican woodrat to thin/burn 
treatment is likely caused by a  lack of coarse woody debris and downed logs, 
essential for nest-building and cover (Converse et al., 2006).  In response to high-
severity treatments, special status species, including the northern goshawk, Mexican 
spotted owl, and peregrine falcon, exhibited positive or neutral abundance responses; 
however, flammulated owls exhibited a negative abundance response, and Mexican 
spotted owls had a negative reproductive response.  Thus, at least in the near term, a 
combination of various treatments in a patchy arrangement in time and space across 
the landscape is likely to result in the highest diversity compared to any one 
treatment, at least for animals whose home ranges are restricted to the stand level.  In 
addition, treatments can be implemented to reduce the risk of wildfire to Mexican 
spotted owl and flammulated owl habitat. 
 
 
6.2 
Implications for research 
 
The majority of observations in the analysis examined responses of birds to treatment 
(90%).  In particular, recent studies (Dickson et al., 2009, Hurteau et al., 2008, Berk, 
2007, Kotliar et al., 2007, Pope et al., 2009) assessed 1-4 year bird responses to 
prescribed fire and thinning using sophisticated modeling techniques, and we suggest 
that these studies be carefully consulted before initiating similar research in order to 
eliminate duplication of effort.  On the other hand, there were 193 observations for 
mammals but most focused on rodents, and most observations were only appropriate 
for the qualitative analysis.  Other underrepresented taxa include reptiles and 
amphibians, as well as rare birds and small mammals that are not easily assessed 
using conventional survey methodologies; for example, shrews (Sorex spp.) or wild 
turkeys.  Other species under- or un-represented in this meta-analysis include medium 
and large mammals, including both predators and ungulates, bats, and birds of prey.   
 
In terms of response variables, 98% of observations focused on abundance or density, 
but only 2% examined a measure of reproductive output.  Reproductive studies are 
more expensive and time consuming, and generally only address one species; thus, 
they are more difficult to undertake and fund.  At the same time, they provide much 
more useful information than density studies on long-term effects of treatments on 
population viability, and we recommend that future research efforts focus on this 
variable particularly for species that already have sufficient density response 
information.  In particular, special status species are under-represented in the 
literature and especially in terms of reproductive responses.  Studies that focus on just 
population size should strive to calculate density, uses sophisticated methods that 
model detection, so that the results can be compared across studies and regions. 
 
Finally, studies need to be conducted at larger spatial and temporal scales in order to 
understand both short- and long-term implications of treatments at the landscape 
level.  Most studies were conducted at <10 years post-treatment, and so the long-
terms implications of treatments are poorly understood.  Repeat measures, rather than 
simple chronosequences, are lacking.  Further, most animals in our analysis had home 
ranges similar to the stand scale, and thus we were unable to draw conclusions on 
species that use multiple habitat types.  Studies that investigate the impacts of 
treatments on animals with large home ranges, using a landscape of both treated and 

 
24 
untreated areas, would greatly improve our understanding of how landscape metrics 
such as fragmentation and connectivity are affecting wildlife.

8.  
Potential Conflicts of Interest and Sources of Support 
 
The review was led by the Ecological Restoration Institute, which has funded and 
published studies on impacts of forest treatments on some wildlife species.  We 
addressed the possibility of conflict of interest by including scientists from Arizona 
Game and Fish Department in the development of the systematic review.  Another 
independent check is the review process through CEBC which solicits additional 
reviews from scientists whom are not affiliated with the Ecological Restoration 
Institute or Northern Arizona University. 
 
Support for this review, consisting of partial salary funding and computer/office space 
is provided by the U.S. Forest Service and by Northern Arizona University.
