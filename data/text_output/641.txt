ABSTRACT—Mixed conifer of southwestern Colorado is poorly understood in comparison to other
common forests in this area, in part due to its compositional complexity. We identified four stand types
in warm-dry, mixed-conifer forests; Abies concolor (white fir), Pinus ponderosa (ponderosa pine),
Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas-fir), and Populus tremuloides (aspen). We examined how composition and
abundance of understory varied across these four types, and assessed the correlation between biotic and
abiotic variables and understory vegetation. Composition of understory community differed
significantly among stand types, with aspen plots having the most distinct understory plant community.
Total plant cover was significantly higher in aspen, and shrub richness was significantly higher in the
Douglas-fir stand type. On average, for all stand types combined, shrubs dominated the understory
cover (11.35%), followed by forbs (7.89%), and graminoids (4.34%). Multivariate multiple regression
showed that several topographic site factors (distance to drainage, slope, and aspect) and characteristics
of stands (white fir/ha, ponderosa pine/ha and basal area, and basal area of aspen) explained variability
in the understory community. Univariate regression showed that variation in annual species richness
and Simpson’s diversity index were partially explained by stand type and site. Our findings illustrate the
necessity to not simplify forest dynamics for all western forest types or even within one forest type (warm-
dry mixed conifer) for a general region. Implementation of forest management should be based on site-
specific knowledge within localized geographic regions to restore or preserve semi-natural communities
within a range of natural variability.
RESUMEN—El bosque mixto de conı´feras del suroeste de Colorado es poco conocido en comparacio´n
con otros tipos de bosques comunes en esta a´rea, en parte debido a su compleja composicio´n.
Identificamos cuatro tipos de vegetacio´n arbo´rea dentro del bosque mixto templado y seco de conı´feras:
Abies concolor (abeto blanco), Pinus ponderosa (pino ponderosa), Pseudotsuga menziesii (abeto de Douglas),
y Populus tremuloides (a´lamo temblo´n). Examinamos co´mo varı´an la composicio´n y la abundancia de las
especies del sotobosque a trave´s de estos cuatro tipos y evaluamos la correlacio´n entre variables bio´ticas
y abio´ticas y vegetacio´n del sotobosque. La composicio´n especı´fica del sotobosque fue significativa-
mente diferente entre los distintos tipos de vegetacio´n arbo´rea, siendo la ma´s diferente la comunidad
vegetal del bosque de a´lamo temblo´n. La cobertura total fue significativamente ma´s alta en el bosque
del a´lamo temblo´n, mientras que la riqueza de arbustos fue significativamente ma´s alta en el bosque del
abeto de Douglas. Por lo general, reuniendo todos los tipos de vegetacio´n arbo´rea, la cobertura de
arbustos fue la mayor parte del sotobosque (11.35%), seguida por las herba´ceas no graminoides
(7.89%), y las gramı´neas (4.34%). Un ana´lisis de regresio´n mu´ltiple indico´ que varios factores del sitio
(distancia al drenaje, pendiente, y exposicio´n) y caracterı´sticas del rodal (a´rboles por hecta´rea [TPH]
del abeto blanco, del pino ponderosa, el a´rea basal [BA], y el BA del a´lamo temblo´n) explicaban la
variabilidad en la composicio´n especı´fica del sotobosque. Los ana´lisis de regresio´n simple indicaron que
la variabilidad en la riqueza de especies anuales y en el ı´ndice de diversidad de Simpson fue
parcialmente explicada por la composicio´n de los a´rboles dominantes y por variables del sitio. Nuestras
conclusiones ilustran la necesidad de evitar la simplificacio´n de la dina´mica forestal entre los tipos de
bosque del oeste e incluso dentro de un mismo tipo (bosque templado y seco de conı´feros mixto) de
una regio´n. La gestio´n forestal debe basarse en conocimiento especı´fico del sitio dentro de regiones
geogra´ficas restringidas para restaurar o conservar las comunidades seminaturales dentro de un rango
de variabilidad natural.

DECEMBER 2007

Federal legislation to reduce risk of wildfire to
communities and municipal water supplies and
to restore natural fire regimes (e.g., Healthy
Forest Restoration Act, 2003) may lead to an over
simplication
of
western
forests.
To
reduce
ecological problems that might ensue from such
generalizations, there is a need to quantitatively
describe types of forest in the western United
States and understand their variability (Schoen-
nagel et al., 2004). Mixed conifer is one of the
most variable and complex forests in the western
United States. Studies have been conducted in
mixed conifer of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade
ranges to understand general structure and
function of stands, and the impact of natural
and anthropogenic disturbances on attributes of
stands (Savage, 1994; Ansley and Battles, 1998;
Battles et al., 2001; Beaty and Taylor, 2001;
Stephens and Finney, 2002; York et al., 2003;
Knapp et al., 2005; North et al., 2005). In
comparison, there is a paucity of analogous
information for southwestern mixed conifer
(White and Vankat, 1993; Wu, 1999; Fule´ et al.,
2003; Grissino-Mayer et al., 2004; Mast and Wolf,
2004). Southwestern mixed conifer forests cover
about 1,000,000 ha in the Southwest (Dieterich,
1983) between the lower-elevational ponderosa
pine (Pinus ponderosa) and the higher-elevational
Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) and sub-
alpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa). In southwestern
Colorado and northwestern New Mexico, mixed
conifer has been divided into two classifications:
warm-dry, and cool-wet (W. H. Romme et al., in
litt.). These represent the two ends of a contin-
uum along an elevational gradient with the
warm-dry mixed conifer being more similar in
community structure and function to ponderosa
pine, and the cool-wet mixed conifer more
similar to Englemann spruce and subalpine fir.
The focus of this study is southwestern warm-
dry mixed-conifer, which is poorly understood in
part because it is comprised of different stand
types. These different stand types reflect varia-
tions in density of trees and saplings and basal
area for individual species of trees (Taylor, 2000;
Fule´ et al., 2003). In the southwestern warm-dry
mixed-conifer, there has been a shift in species
composition
from
the
shade-intolerant,
but
more fire resistant, ponderosa pine to shade-
tolerant species such as white fir (Abies concolor)
and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii; W. H.
Romme et al., in litt.; Mast and Wolf, 2004).
Increased continuity of vertical and horizontal
fuel also has developed (White and Vankat, 1993;
Heinlein et al., 2005). In our study region in the
San Juan Mountains near Pagosa Springs, Arch-
uleta Co., Colorado, this shift in stand structure-
has been attributed to the current fire-free
period (1881 to present) being longer than in
the past (1616 to 1880) when the mean fire
interval was 14.7–17.1 years in the warm-dry
mixed-conifer (Wu, 1999).
It is currently unknown if understory vegeta-
tion has undergone changes because of the past
century of fire suppression in the southwestern
warm-dry mixed-conifer. Increased stand density
and canopy cover associated with shade-tolerant
trees alters abiotic variables (e.g., soil moisture,
soil temperature, and surface light) that can
influence understory vegetation. A more com-
prehensive understanding of understory vegeta-
tion and its relationship to different stand types
in the warm-dry mixed-conifer is needed to
quantify effects of disturbance on composition
and
abundance
of
understory
communities.
Close associations have been identified in other
forests between stand types and understory
species, which have been attributed to stand
types and understory species responding to
similar environmental gradients (Gilliam et al.,
1995;
Sagers
and
Lyon,
1997;
Berger
and
Puettmann, 2000; Le´gare´ et al., 2001). However,
similar studies have not been conducted in the
warm-dry mixed-conifer. We hypothesized that
close associations exist between different stand
types and understory species in the warm-dry
mixed-conifer because of coordinating responses
to biotic and abiotic variables. Specifically, the
understory communities of aspen stand types will
differ from understory communities of conifer-
ous species because of the natural (deciduous
versus coniferous) growth form of the dominant
overstory trees. The main objectives of this study
were 1) to determine if understory composition
and abundance varies under different types of
forest within the warm-dry mixed-conifer and 2)
to determine what biotic and abiotic variables are
correlated with variation in understory vegeta-
tion.
MATERIALS AND METHODS—Study Area—The study
area is located on lower Middle Mountain, about 18 km
NW Pagosa Springs, Archuleta Co., Colorado. Lower
Middle Mountain encompasses roughly 370 ha in T35N,
R3W, Sections 16, 17, 18, and 20. Our study area is
159 ha, or 49% of lower Middle Mountain. Lower
Middle Mountain is part of the Piedra Roadless Area.

Currently there are no open roads, but there are about
8 km of closed, interior roads, constructed in the late
1980s to access a timber sale.
Lower Middle Mountain consists of moderately steep
(15–30%) mountain slopes on generally south-facing
aspects. Elevations range from 2,438 to 2,743 m. The
dominant soil type is Dutton loam, a silty clay loam
(United
States
Department
of
Agriculture
Forest
Service, in litt.). Average daily temperatures range
from a maximum of 25.7uC in July to a minimum of
217uC in January. Average annual precipitation is
55.4 cm and is distributed throughout the year with the
greatest amounts occurring in July and August. Pre-
cipitation from November to March is dominated by
snowfall, with an average annual snowfall of 326 cm
(Western Regional Climate Center, Pagosa Springs,
www.wrcc.dri.edu).
The warm-dry mixed-conifer at the study area is
a patchy mixture of ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, white
fir, and small pockets of both mature and young aspen
(Populus tremuloides). The midstory and understory are
dominated primarily by white fir and Douglas-fir, with
a variety of shrubs including Gambel oak (Quercus
gambelii), snowberry (Symphoricarpus rotundifolius), and
serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia). Occasional ponder-
osa pine regeneration is present. Common herbaceous
species at the site include Parry’s oatgrass (Danthonia
parryi), perennial brome (Bromus ciliatus), blue wild rye
(Elymus glaucus), Thurber’s fescue (Festuca thurberi),
northern bedstraw (Galium boreale), little sunflower
(Helianthella quinquenervis), tuber starwort (Pseudostel-
laria jamesiana), and meadowrue (Thalictrum fendleri).
Historical and current disturbances that have influ-
enced vegetation composition and structure in the
warm-dry, mixed-conifer forest on lower Middle Moun-
tain include timber harvesting, livestock grazing, and
fire suppression. Although this area has been impacted
by human disturbances, a large portion of the warm-dry
mixed-conifer forests have numerous old-growth char-
acteristics, which include large trees, spike-topped or
broken-topped trees, snags, and large, coarse, woody
debris (United States Department of Agriculture Forest
Service, in litt.). Stands have been commercially
harvested only once, between 1991 and 1993, using
an intermediate harvest system that modified the stand
to enhance growth and quality of trees for continual
development of stands. About 3,930,000,000 board feet
were harvested in the area, which consisted of 51%
ponderosa pine, 33% white fir, and 16% Douglas-fir
(United
States
Department
of
Agriculture
Forest
Service, in litt.). Sheep grazing in the late 1800s and
cattle grazing since the early 1900s has occurred in the
study area on a rotational-rest system over a 5-month
period from June to October with dates varying due to
the presence of snow. There are no large meadows or
water holes-tanks within the study area and, therefore,
grazing impacts
appear
minimal.
The
mean fire
interval from 1545 to 1861 was 12.6 years (range, 3–
50 years) using fire scars recorded on any tree (United
States Department of Agriculture Forest Service, in
litt.). For only those years with scars recorded on $10%
of trees, mean interval of fire was 19.8 years, also with
a range of 3–50 years. These results agree with Grissino-
Mayer et al. (2004), who determined that mean fire
interval in warm-dry mixed-conifer before 1880 was 18–
28 years in a landscape-scale assessment of fire regimes
in the southern San Juan Mountains. The last fire
recorded by a sampled fire scar at Middle Mountain
was in 1861 (United States Department of Agriculture
Forest Service, in litt.). Grissino-Mayer et al. (2004)
found no evidence of widespread fire after 1880.
Field Methods—Data were collected as pretreatment
data for a study of three forest-restoration treatments
on lower Middle Mountain. In each of 12, 16-ha
experimental units that will be used for control,
thinning and burning, or burning only treatments,
we established 20 study plots to characterize understory
and overstory vegetation. (total n 5 12 units 3 20 plots
5 240 plots). All plot centers were permanently
marked with iron stakes and were geo-referenced with
Global Positioning System.
Structure and fuels in overstory and understory
vegetation were measured in each of the 240 plots.
Nomenclature follows United States Department of
Agriculture, Natural Resource Conservation Service
(PLANTS database, ver. 3.5, http://plants.usda.gov).
Overstory trees and saplings taller than breast height
(137 cm) were measured in a 400-m2 (11.28-m radius)
circular plot. Species, condition (living or snag/log
classes–Thomas et al., 1979), diameter at breast height
(dbh), height, and a preliminary field classification of
presettlement or postsettlement origin were recorded
for each tree encountered in the plot. Regeneration
(trees below breast height) and shrubs were tallied as
live or dead and by three height classes (0–40, 40–80,
and 80–137 cm) in a 100-m2 (5.64-m radius) subplot
centered on the overstory-sapling plot. Richness and
density of shrubs, based upon counting individual
stems, were recorded in only the NE J of the nested
100-m2 subplot due to high density of shrubs. We used
a 15.24-m planar transect located in a random di-
rection from plot center to measure forest floor litter
and duff depths and dead woody biomass following
guidelines outlined in Brown (1974). In addition, a 50-
m transect was laid parallel to the topographic (slope)
gradient at plot center with 25 m below and above plot
center. At 3-m intervals along the transect, canopy
cover of trees was measured by vertical projection using
a densitometer (Ganey and Block, 1994).
We used a modification of the Modified-Whittaker
plot (Stohlgren et al., 1995) to describe understory
vegetation. One of the main objectives of this sampling
design was to quantify foliar cover for most species of
plants in the area, as well as to provide data on cover
that have low spatial autocorrelation. Each plot was
sampled once over a 4.5-week period (10 July–14
August). Plots were randomly sampled over this period
to insure sampling time and stand type did not
influence results. A 10 by 50-m belt transect was
centered over each 50-m line transect. All species of
herbs and shrubs in the belt were recorded. We did not
record any plant cover or substrate data for the belt
transects. Four 1-m2 (0.5 by 2 m) subplots were
established within the belt transect at 14-m intervals
with the 2-m-side parallel to the transect. The 1-m2
subplots were located in the top left (0–2 m) and
bottom right (48–50 m) corners of the belt transect
and on the right side of the line transect at 16–18 m
and the left side of the line transect at 32–34 m. For
each subplot, we estimated percent cover of each
December 2007
Korb et al.—Understory communities of forests

understory species (herbaceous, shrub, and tree seed-
lings) to the nearest 1% for values .1% and nearest
0.25% for cover values ,1% (0.25, 0.5, 0.75) using
cardboard cutouts of known sizes as visual guides.
Ocular estimation of plant cover is a commonly used
method for determining dominance, succession, and
treatment response in vegetation analysis (Hatton et
al., 1986). Estimates can total .100% because percent
cover was estimated independently for each species
and independent of canopy position. Abundance of
individual species was calculated by averaging abun-
dance of the species in the four 1-m2 subplots/transect.
Percent covers of litter, rock, wood, and bare mineral
soil also were estimated for each subplot.
Statistical Analyses—All 240 plots were grouped by
stand type based on methods described in Taylor
(2000). Importance values were calculated for each
species of tree as the sum of relative density and relative
basal area. The individual species of tree with the
highest importance value for each plot was used to
designate a specific stand type. Although the potential
exists for an individual plot to have two species with
high importance values, only the species of tree with
the highest importance value was used to assign
a particular stand type because we were interested if
dominance (density and basal area) of an individual
species impacted understory vegetation. For example,
ponderosa pine prior to the 1880s had higher density
and basal area than white fir in the warm-dry mixed-
conifer for our study area (Wu, 1999). Using impor-
tance value to determine stand type, if density of
regenerating
white
fir
outweighed
basal
area
of
ponderosa pine in a given study plot, then white fir
would be assigned as the stand type. A dense thicket of
small white fir would have a greater affect on un-
derstory vegetation than scattered, large-canopy pon-
derosa pines although both species existed in the study
plot.
A variety of overstory and general characteristics of
site were measured to examine effects of biotic and
abiotic factors on understory vegetation. Structural and
compositional characteristics of overstory-sapling basal
area, trees/ha, and percent canopy cover were calcu-
lated from structure data collected on each plot. Fuel
loadings were calculated from the planar fuel transect
by fuel type, using standard classes (1-h, 10-h, 100-h,
1,000-h sound, and 1,000-h rotten) that correspond to
time lags required for fuels of different sizes to reach
equilibrium with atmospheric-moisture content (An-
derson, 1982), as well as litter and duff depths (Brown,
1974). These fuel loadings were further divided into
fine woody debris (1-h, 10-h, 100-h) and course woody
debris (1,000-h sound and rotten). Abiotic factors of
elevation,
slope
and
aspect–transformed
into
an
ecologically meaningful continuous variable sensu
Beers et al., 1966, in which 0 indicates a southwest
aspect and 2 indicates northeast–were included in our
analyses. We also calculated distance from each plot to
nearest drainage using a map of the study site in the
ArcView software program (Environmental Systems
Research Institute, 2002).
Plant-community data from the 1-m2 subplots were
examined for differences in understory vegetation
among the stand types using a permutation-based
multivariate ANOVA. This analysis, using software
called PERMANOVA (Anderson, 2001; McArdle and
Anderson, 2001), uses common ecological distance
measures (Bray-Curtis in this case) to examine multi-
variate datasets for compositional differences. We used
the Shapiro-Wilks test to determine whether data met
the normality assumption and Levene’s test to de-
termine
if
data
met
the
homogeneity-of-variance
assumption (Milliken and Johnson, 1984). The Green-
house and Geisser correction for sphericity was used to
determine significant differences at P # 0.05. We made
multiple comparisons of means between different
stand types using paired t-tests followed by a Bonferroni
adjustment (Howell, 2002). We also used a distance-
based multivariate multiple regression (McArdle and
Anderson, 2001) to identify overstory-sapling or vari-
ables related to understory compositional gradients.
We used DISTLM software to calculate the ‘‘pseudo-F’’
statistic, an extension of the traditional F-statistic,
which quantifies effects of numerous variables on
a
multivariate
dataset.
Indicator-species
analysis
(McCune
and
Grace,
2002),
which
uses
species
richness and associated cover values of species was
used to identify species that were particularly faithful to
a stand type. A comparison between the maximum
indicator value (0–100) and random trials for occur-
rence of a given species (1,000 Monte Carlo randomi-
zations) provided an approximate P-value (McCune
and Grace, 2002). Species with P # 0.05 were accepted
as indicator species for a particular stand type.
We examined a variety of univariate measures from
our data to further investigate differences among stand
types, as well as to identify general relationships
between understory and overstory-sapling vegetation
or abiotic characteristics. We summarized community
data from belt transects to calculate richness of various
functional groups, as well as total richness, and then
used the quadrat data to calculate total cover and
Simpson’s diversity index. Univariate measures were
compared across stand types using nonparametric
Kruskal-Wallis tests, and then compared to overstory-
sapling and data from sites using multiple regressions.
These analyses were conducted using the JMP-IN
statistical package (SAS Institute, Inc., 2004).
RESULTS—Four stand types in the warm-dry
mixed-conifer at lower Middle Mountain were
identified: 1) white fir-dominated (149 plots or
62% of plots), 2) ponderosa pine-dominated (41
plots or 17% of plots), 3) Douglas-fir-dominated
(26 plots or 11% of plots), and 4) aspen-
dominated (24 plots or 10% of plots). Tree basal
area (H 5 9.17, P 5 0.027) and density (H 5
34.18, P 5 0.001) differed among these domi-
nant stand types (Table 1). Ponderosa pine-
dominated types had higher total basal area
than aspen-dominated types, with no difference
among any of the other stand types. Aspen-
dominated plots had the highest density (1,278
trees/ha); additionally, density in white fir-
dominated types was higher than in ponderosa
pine-dominated types. Canopy cover averaged

45.1% (P 5 0.761) and did not differ among
stand types. Amounts of woody debris on forest
floor differed among stand types with aspen-
dominated types having the highest overall
debris (pseudo-F 5 1.77, P 5 0.032). Fine woody
debris was higher in aspen-dominated types than
white fir-dominated types. In aspen-dominated
types 1,000-h sound fuels were higher than in
Douglas-fir or ponderosa pine-dominated stand
types.
Ponderosa
pine-dominated
types
had
lower 1,000-h rotten fuels than the other three
stand types.
We sampled a total of 199 species. Mean
species richness did not differ among the four
stand
types.
Shrub
richness
was
higher
in
Douglas-fir-dominated plots than in other stand
types
(H

9.0,
P
5
0.029).
Conversely,
graminoid richness was lower (,50%) in Dou-
glas-fir-dominated plots than in other stand types
(H 5 9.7, P 5 0.042). On average, 97% of species
were perennials and only 3% were annuals.
Natives comprised 96.4% of species. The most
abundant
non-native
species
were
Kentucky
bluegrass (Poa pratensis), dandelion (Taraxacum
officinale), and false salisfy (Tragapogon pratensis).
The only Colorado state-listed noxious weeds
were bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare), Canada thistle
(Cirsium arvense), and musk thistle (Carduus
nutans), all of which were on ,5% of plots.
Sedges (Carex) were present on all 240 plots.
Other herbaceous species that were not particu-
larly faithful to a stand type included northern
bedstraw (95%), peavine (Lathyrus; 89%), and
tuber starwort (75%), with each percentage
representing the minimum percentage of plots
for each stand type the species was located.
Understory composition differed among stand
types (F 5 1.81, P 5 0.001). Pairwise a posteriori
comparisons showed that the aspen-dominated
types differed from Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine,
and white fir-dominated types in regards to
understory composition with the latter types
showing no difference. Multivariate multiple
regression showed that several topographic fac-
tors (distance to drainage, slope, and aspect), and
stand characteristics (white fir/ha, ponderosa
pine/ha and basal area, and basal area of aspen)
accounted for 25% of variability in the understory
community (pseudo-F 5 4.39, P 5 0.001).
Total cover of understory plants differed (H 5
9.1, P 5 0.028) among stand types, and was
highest (38%) in aspen-dominated plots (Ta-
ble 2). Stand types also differed in cover of
shrubs (H 5 8.9, P 5 0.031) and tree seedlings

plots than white fir-dominated plots (Table 2).
Indicator-species analysis detected species that
were particularly faithful in each stand type
(Table 4). There were six indicators of aspen-
dominated types, two for both ponderosa pine-
and Douglas-fir-dominated types, but no indica-
tor for white fir-dominated plots. Both indicator
species for ponderosa pine-dominated and Dou-
glas-fir-dominated plots were herbaceous plants.
Three indicators of aspen were shrubs, two
indicators were herbaceous plants, and one tree
seedling (white fir).
Simpson’s diversity index and variation in
annual
species
richness
(species
completing
their lifecycle in 1 year) were partially explained
by stand type and site (Table 5). In context of
the multiple-regression models, annual richness
and Simpson’s diversity index both show nega-
tive correlations with distance to nearest drain-
age (plots in or close to drainages had higher
annual richness and Simpson’s diversity index)
and 100-hour fuels (2.5-5-cm size class). Further-
more, after statistically controlling for other
factors, annual richness also showed a negative
relationship with percent tree canopy cover and
conversely a positive relationship with aspect
(more northeasterly exposures tend to have
higher annual richness), while Simpson’s di-
versity index showed positive relationship with
several variables of individual species.

DISCUSSION—Warm-dry mixed-conifer on lower
Middle Mountain is a complex assemblage of
patches dominated by four species of trees that
represent
different
stand
types.
Understory
vegetation communities vary among these stand
types, being affected in part by topographic
variables such as slope, aspect, distance to
nearest drainage, and stand basal area and
trees/ha of white firs, ponderosa pines, aspens,
and Douglas-firs. This finding is congruent with
our
hypothesis
that
close
associations
exist
between different stand types and understory
species in warm-dry mixed-conifer due to biotic
and abiotic variables.
Differences among the four stand types were
largest among the three coniferous and one
deciduous stand types. Variation was present,
however, among coniferous stand types as well.
Tree density and 1,000-h rotten fuels were lower
in ponderosa pine-dominated plots than white
fir-dominated plots, with 1,000-h rotten fuels also
lower than in Douglas-fir-dominated plots. Sego
lily (Calochortus nuttallii) and pussytoes (Anten-
naria parvifolia) were both indicator species for
ponderosa pine-dominated
plots. These two
species thrive in open, dry areas with gentle
slopes, which is consistent with characteristics for
this stand type. Sego lily also was identified as an
indicator species in old-growth ponderosa pine
on the North Rim of Grand Canyon National
Park, Arizona (Laughlin et al., 2004). Douglas-
fir-dominated plots had the highest richness of
shrubs and 1,000-h rotten fuels and lowest
richness of graminoids. Cover of graminoids
was lower in Douglas-fir-dominated plots than in
white fir-dominated plots, and cover of forbs was
higher
in
Douglas-fir-dominated
plots
than
ponderosa pine-dominated plots. Parry’s golden-
rod (Oreochrysum parryi) was an indicator species
for Douglas-fir-dominated plots. This species
generally is associated with shady, moist environ-
ments, similar to Douglas-fir (W. H. Romme et
al., in litt.). Needlegrass (Achnatherum nelsonii)
was also an indicator species, despite richness
and cover of graminoids being lower in Douglas-
fir-dominated plots than other coniferous stand
types. Needlegrass is considered both an early
successional species following fire and a climax
species that occurs in well-drained soil (Hassell et
al., 1983).
Plots with aspen-dominated understory vege-
tation were distinct from the three coniferous
stand types. Aspen-dominated plots had higher
tree density and fine fuels (1-100-h) than the
three coniferous stand types. In addition, aspen-
dominated plots had higher 100-h sound and
rotten fuels than ponderosa pine-dominated
plots and higher 1,000-h sound fuels than
Douglas-fir-dominated plots. Aspen-dominated
plots had higher understory cover than the three
coniferous-dominated plots, a finding consistent
with other studies (Fisher and Fule´, 2004).
Reynolds (1969) compared forage production
beneath aspen groves and nearby mixed-conifer
stands in the Southwest and found up to 14 times
as much production of grasses and 4 times as
much production of forbs under aspens. In
contrast, our study showed that higher under-

story cover in aspen was the result of shrubs
rather than graminoids and forbs. Although we
estimated percent cover, cover and biomass
typically are correlated (Elzinga et al., 1998).
The higher plant cover under aspens might be
explained by the deciduous nature of aspen
trees, which results in greater solar input in the
early part of the growing season, as well as
differences in litter accumulation and resulting
soil characteristics (e.g., alkaline soil; Messier et
al., 1998). Deciduous forests have understory
species with different leaf phenologies because
of variation in canopy cover during the growing
season (Uemura, 1994), and deciduous trees
having
higher
infrared
radiation
and
light
transmittancy than conifers (Auclair and Goff,
1971).
Le´gare´ et al. (2001) reported that cover, rather
than understory richness, was the major distinc-
tion among different stand types in a mixed
boreal forest in southwestern Quebec that had
aspen as a dominant stand type. This finding is
consistent with our results, with the six indicator
species for aspen-dominated plots being partic-
ularly faithful because of higher cover values
rather than uniqueness of species. Specifically,
regeneration of white fir was an indicator species
for aspen-dominated plots, illustrating that this
shade-tolerant
species
was
regenerating
in
higher abundance under aspen-dominated plots
than adjacent types of coniferous forest. Pres-
ence of conifers decreases establishment of
aspens, but does not affect growth or increase
mortality of aspens (Kaye et al., 2005), indicating
that resprouting of aspen may be minimized due
to regeneration of white fir in aspen-dominated
plots until a disturbance removes regenerating
conifers. Three of the six indicator species for
aspen-dominated plots were shrubs; snowberry,
serviceberry, and Wood’s rose (Rosa woodsii).
Bartos
et
al.
(1994)
also noted
snowberry,
serviceberry, and Wood’s rose to be commonly
associated with aspen. Snowberry rarely occurs in
dense shade, preferring gap openings in tree
canopies and loamy soil. Serviceberry grows best
on well-drained, alkaline soils and is not shade
tolerant (Sutton and Johnson, 1974). Similarly,
Wood’s rose grows best on well-drained, weakly
basic, moist soils and is tolerant of both full sun
and moderate shade (Haeussler et al., 1990).
Although aspen tolerates a variety of soil types,
habitats occupied by aspens are similar to habitat
occupied by the above shrubs: well-drained,
nutrient-rich sites with high organic matter
(Perala, 1990).
Identifying individual variables that influence
understory vegetation is difficult due to interac-
tions among biotic and abiotic gradients. Other
studies
have encountered similar difficulties
when trying to identify environmental drivers
for
understory
vegetation
composition
and
structure (Pausas and Austin, 2001; North el
al., 2005). In a mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra
Nevada, California, which also experienced an
increase in white fir due to fire suppression,
understory vegetation was predominately influ-
enced by available light on the forest floor and
soil moisture (North et al., 2005). We did not
take measurements of soil moisture; however,
we
quantified
distance
to
nearest
drainage
(ephemeral streams during spring runoff and
summer monsoonal rains). This distance was
negatively correlated with overall understory
diversity,
indicating
that
plant
diversity
was
highest in plots in or near drainages. This
result is similar to other studies that show
species diversity highest in riparian areas with
aspens generally being the second-most diverse
community in the western United States (Kay,
1997; Stohlgren et al., 1997). Perennial shrubs
were dominant in the study of mixed conifers
by North et al. (2005), which was similar to our
results. This dominance of shrubs is unique in
the Southwest where herbs and graminoids
dominate mixed conifers in northern Arizona
and New Mexico (Alexander, 1985; Fisher and
Fule´, 2004). Dominance of shrub cover was
explained by perennial shrubs being able to
tolerate
high
temperatures
and
scarce
soil
moisture during summer drought and forming
large contiguous patches that occupied ecotonal
areas between tree clumps and openings (North
et al., 2005). Although we did not map spatial
distribution of understory vegetation, we ob-
served that shrubs in the warm-dry mixed-
conifer of our study also aggregated in patches
and tended to occupy ecotonal areas, with forbs
dominating under canopies of trees and grami-
noids dominating in open interspaces between
canopies. Dominance of shrub cover in the
warm-dry mixed-conifer impacts fire behavior.
Shrubs dry more slowly than herbaceous vege-
tation and generally support a slower rate of fire
spread
than
similar
vegetation
types
(e.g.,
ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer) dominated
by herbs and graminoids in northern Arizona

and New Mexico (Alexander, 1985; Fisher and
Fule´, 2004; Grissino-Mayer et al., 2004).
Aspen has long been recognized as an impor-
tant indicator of ecological integrity and ecolog-
ical biodiversity in the western United States (Kay,
1997). Aspen is often the only deciduous tree in
a landscape of conifers, providing scenic beauty
(Bartos, 2001) and unique habitat for birds and
mammals (DeByle, 1985). The findings from our
study are consistent with other research indicat-
ing the importance of aspen among conifers
(Bartos, 2001; Romme et al., 2001). In addition,
our findings illustrate variation within southwest-
ern warm-dry mixed-conifer by showing distinct
stand-understory relationships for all four stand
types. These findings illustrate the importance of
not oversimplifying all western forests or even one
forest (warm-dry mixed-conifer) for a general
region. Management of forests in the warm-dry
mixed-conifer needs to be based on site-specific
knowledge for individual stand types within
localized geographic regions to restore or pre-
serve natural communities within a range of
historic variability.
