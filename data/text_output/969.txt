ABSTRACT:  The increasing frequency of partial timber harvest prescriptions has created the need for an
efficient and accurate method of assessing residual stand damage. In this study, we developed and tested a new
sampling method that exploits the general pattern of residual stand damage being concentrated near primary
transport routes. The method, termed DamQuick, consists of systematic belt transects located immediately
adjacent and parallel to the harvesting operation’s extraction corridors. Plot measures of tree wounding are
scaled by sampling intensity and a concentration factor to yield stand-level estimates of residual damage. The
method was evaluated for a skyline thinning operation in western Oregon. DamQuick damage estimates were
compared with actual damage levels obtained from a 100% survey for three thinning treatments—30, 60, and
100 residual trees/ac. The mean DamQuick estimates were statistically similar to actual stand damage levels
(t = 0.366–0.651, P = 0.531–0.725) for all thinning treatments, with mean estimation errors (standard errors)
ranging from 0.7% (0.9%) to 2.1% (4.4%). Operationally, DamQuick was easy to implement. The primary
transport routes provided ready stand access, which facilitated plot location and establishment. West. J. Appl.

Key Words:  Partial harvesting, tree wounding, damage assessment.
Increasingly, foresters are prescribing partial timber har-
vests to enhance tree growth, maintain ecosystem health, and
promote forest regeneration. Such treatments include com-
mercial thinning and crop tree release; sanitation and salvage
logging; and shelterwood, seed tree, and selection harvests.
In Canada, the frequency of partial timber harvests increased
by more than 40%, on an area basis, from 1990 to 1997
(Natural Resources Canada 1999). A similar trend occurred
in the United States. McNeel and Dodd (1996) reported a
dramatic rise in the amount of commercial thinning con-
ducted in western Washington since the late 1980s, and this
strong growth is projected to continue throughout the Pacific
Northwest into the foreseeable future (Sessions et al. 1990,
Bettinger et al. 1993).

Besides achieving a range of silvicultural objectives,
partial harvesting systems appear to have broad public sup-
port. A large body of research demonstrates the public’s
general preference for management practices that leave re-
sidual trees following timber harvest (Brown and Daniel
1986, Ribe 1989, Brunson and Shelby 1992). However, such
practices may damage the remaining standing trees, possibly
diminishing residual growth, reducing future timber quality,
or impairing forest health (Han and Kellogg 2000a). Prevent-
ing residual stand damage is the primary concern of foresters
prescribing commercial thinning treatments (Lamson et al.
1985, McNeel and Dodd 1996). McLaughlin and Pulkki
(1992) have stated that partial timber harvests are “pointless”
if they result in unacceptable damage levels. Even if the
public currently deems partial harvest practices acceptable,
“partial cutting will be considered just as repulsive as
clearcutting” if residual stand damage exceeds tolerable
levels (Schmid and Mata 1993).
In a survey of logging contractors, McNeel and Dodd
(1996) found that, while many loggers had extensive knowl-
edge of clearcut harvest systems, their experience implement-
ing partial timber harvests was generally limited. Moreover, an

82
WJAF 18(2) 2003
extended learning curve was observed among contractors
making the transition from traditional clearcut operations to
more complex partial harvest systems. Thus, the increasing
frequency of partial harvest prescriptions, combined with
loggers’ relative inexperience implementing such treatments,
may prove problematic.
Harvest monitoring is an important element of the partial
harvesting operation because it permits the timely detection
of residual stand damage. If damage exceeds acceptable
levels, corrective action can be taken before extensive stand
injury is incurred. In addition, monitoring provides the log-
ging contractor with valuable real-time information that
could facilitate the efficient extraction of forest products
while protecting the residual stand. The challenge is to assess
residual stand damage in an expedient and accurate manner.
Because it is not feasible to inspect each tree, some form of
sampling is required. However, development and implemen-
tation of a statistically relevant sampling strategy can be a
daunting task. One must determine the optimum type and size
of sample plots, the appropriate sampling intensity, and the
sampling method to be employed. Physically locating the
plots and assessing the damage is, in itself, time-consuming
and arduous work. Thus, simplicity and ease of implementa-
tion are important criteria when developing a sampling strat-
egy (Stehman and Davis 1997).
In this article, we propose a new approach to damage
assessment that attempts to meet the dual objectives of effi-
ciency and accuracy. The method, termed DamQuick, was
tested using data from a cable thinning operation in western
Oregon. Results suggest that DamQuick may be a promising
approach for timber sale administrators and logging contrac-
tors responsible for monitoring residual stand damage.
Previous Work
Numerous studies have investigated residual stand damage
following partial timber harvests. Generally, the reports have
described the damage associated with a particular silvicultural
prescription (Aho et al. 1983, Kelley 1983, Lamson et al. 1985,
Kellogg et al. 1986, Sidle and Laurent 1986, Hassler et al.
1999) or harvesting system (Aulerich et al. 1976, Ostrofsky et
al. 1986, Cline et al. 1991, Fairweather 1991, McLaughlin and
Pulkki 1992, Bettinger and Kellogg 1993, Schmid and Mata
1993, Nichols et al. 1994, Lanford and Stokes 1995,
Athanassiadis 1997, Han and Kellogg 2000a).
In contrast, relatively little published research has exam-
ined methods for assessing residual stand damage. Stehman
and Davis (1997) reported on a sampling strategy that
partitions the harvest area into two strata: the area near the
trail network and the area off-trail. Using hypothetical data,
the authors demonstrated that under certain forest condi-
tions, a stratified approach may yield more precise damage
estimates than simple random sampling. They observed that
when the trail stratum occupies 25% of the total harvest
area, as is typically the case, the sampling effort must be
intensified in the trail stratum to capture the statistical
advantages of stratification.
More recently, Han and Kellogg (2000b) compared
four traditional approaches to estimating residual damage
following commercial thinning of a Douglas-fir
(Pseudotsuga menziesii) stand in western Oregon. The
authors found no significant difference in accuracy among
systematic plot, simple random plot, systematic transect,
and block sampling methods. However, they reported con-
siderable differences in simplicity and ease of implementa-
tion, with systematic plot sampling proving to be the easiest
to employ (Han and Kellogg 2000b).
Throughout the stand-damage literature, tree wounding is
consistently described as being concentrated generally in those
areas immediately adjacent to primary transport routes, such as
along skidder/forwarder trails or yarding corridors (Aulerich et
al. 1976, Aho et al. 1983, Kellogg et al. 1986, Ostrofsky et al.
1986, Fairweather 1991, Bettinger and Kellogg 1993, Nichols
et al. 1994, Stehman and Davis 1997, Han and Kellogg
2000a,b). This appears to hold true irrespective of the partial
harvesting prescription or the type of harvesting system em-
ployed. We found only two published exceptions to this result.
Cline et al. (1991) reported no relationship between residual
tree damage and location relative to skid trails or landings for
whole-tree partial cutting in hard- and mixed-wood forests in
New England. Athanassiadis (1997) observed uniformly dis-
tributed tree damage in a cut-to-length thinning operation in
two young coniferous stands in Sweden.
The concentration of damage near extraction routes is
intuitive because the greatest amount of activity occurs in
these areas during the harvesting operation. The tendency is
for residual damage to increase with more frequent exposure
to harvesting equipment (Zeglen 1997). Indeed, Nichols et al.
(1994) observed that the likelihood of tree wounding was
negatively correlated with the distance between the tree and
the extraction corridor. The authors reported that the prob-
ability of tree damage approached zero once distances from
the primary transport route exceeded 18 ft.
Assessing Residual Stand Damage Using
DamQuick
The DamQuick approach focuses sampling effort on those
areas where damage is most likely to occur, i.e., near primary
transport routes. The sampling method uses a systematic belt
transect, with the sample unit being a rectangular plot whose
width extends a fixed distance from the edge of the primary
transport route into the residual stand and whose length runs
parallel to the extraction route. Damage is assessed for all
trees within the sample plot. Figure 1 illustrates the layout of
a DamQuick plot for a typical skyline thinning operation.
Residual stand damage is estimated by calculating the
percentage of damaged trees in the plot and scaling the
result by the sampling intensity and an estimated concentra-
tion factor:

sample plot; SI is the sampling intensity, measured as the
percentage of the residual stand area excluding the clearcut

trail or skyline corridor occupied by the sample plot; and CF
is a concentration factor. The variables P and SI are deter-
mined from actual plot measurements, whereas the CF is
estimated based on prior experience. The use of an a priori
estimate of CF in DamQuick calculations is analogous to
using an a priori estimate of standard deviation when calcu-
lating a minimum sample size. In both cases, the practitioner
uses his or her best approximation of the variable of interest,
drawn from either previous experience or a pilot study, to
assess stand damage or determine the minimum required
sample size.
Specifically, CF is an estimate of the percentage of re-
sidual stand damage occurring immediately adjacent to pri-
mary transport routes. Studies by Kellogg et al. (1986),
Bettinger and Kellogg (1993), and Han and Kellogg (2000a)
found that from 63 to 85% of residual damage occurred
within 9 ft of the extraction route centerline. This range in
values suggests that damage distribution varies according to
the type of harvesting system employed (i.e., manual versus
mechanical felling and processing; tractor skidding versus
forwarding versus skyline yarding), the pre- and post-harvest
stand conditions, and the skill and experience of the logging
contractor implementing the treatment.
A special case may arise when sample plots overlap as
the result of intersecting and/or overlapping primary trans-
port routes. Typically, a concurrent objective of thinning
treatments is to minimize the visual impact of the harvest.
As a result, considerable efforts are undertaken to avoid
opening large areas of the canopy, as would occur when
two or more extraction routes overlap. This is not to say
that such events never occur. For example, overlapping
corridors may arise in a skyline thinning operation when
an adequate landing location or tail tree (or anchor) is not
available or when the desired skyline deflection is not
achievable. In most cases, however, overlapping areas are
nonexistent or too small to have a measurable impact on
stand-level estimates of residual damage. Consequently,
these overlapping areas can be safely ignored (Stehman
and Davis 1997). In those rare instances when consider-
able plot overlap exists, one belt transect can be shortened
to exclude the overlapping sample area.
An Illustration
Consider a commercial thinning operation in which the
harvested trees are extracted using a skyline yarding system.
Landings are 150 ft apart, and each skyline corridor is
clearcut to 12 ft wide and 800 ft long (Figure 1). Based on
previous experience with this prescription and harvesting
system, 50% of the damaged trees should be found within the
first 9 ft of the residual stand, i.e., the zone 6–15 ft from the
corridor centerline. Without loss of generality, one would
walk through the 9 ft residual tree zone to the right of the
corridor centerline and count a total of 60 trees, of which 20
are damaged. In this particular scenario, damage is defined as
trunk scarring that exceeds a maximum acceptable size,
severed roots, or a broken tree top; however, it could include
any criteria designated by the forest landowner or manager.
In this example the plot damage and the sampling intensity
are 33 and 13%, respectively (P = 20/60; SI = (9*800)/
(69*800)). From prior experience, one would predict the
concentration factor to be 50%. Thus, the estimated level of
residual stand damage, based on one sample plot, is 8.6%
[ RSD

A similar procedure would be followed for the sample plot
to the left of the corridor centerline and for the other corridors
in the stand, with each sample plot providing an independent
estimate of residual stand damage. From these individual
estimates one would calculate a mean percentage of residual
stand damage and an associated measure of precision, such as
a standard deviation or confidence interval. In this regard, the
DamQuick calculations are similar to those used in tradi-
tional timber cruising.
Putting DamQuick to the Test
Study Site
We evaluated the DamQuick methodology by comparing
estimated and actual levels of residual stand damage follow-
ing commercial thinning of a 34-yr-old conifer stand on the
Siuslaw National Forest near Hebo, OR (long. 123o28’12"W;
lat: 45o11’24"N). Douglas-fir was the predominant tree spe-
cies, representing 90% of the stand composition, with west-
ern hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) and Sitka spruce (Picea
sitchensis) making up the balance. From a preharvest timber
cruise, we determined average diameter at breast height (dbh)
and average total tree height to be 11.6 in. and 65 ft, respec-
tively. The stand was fully stocked at 238 trees and 476 ft2 of
basal area/ac. The terrain was broken by slopes that varied
from 15 to 60%.
Three different thinning treatments had been pre-
scribed—30, 60, and 100 residual trees/ac (TPA)—with

thinning corridor.

healthy, dominant and codominant Douglas-fir and west-
ern hemlock marked to leave as future crop trees. The
different treatments permitted evaluation of the DamQuick
methodology across a range of thinning intensities. Log-
ging was conducted during December 1993 and February
1994. The harvesting system consisted of manual chainsaw
felling, limbing, and bucking, with cable yarding of tree
lengths using a Thunderbird TMY-40 yarder and a me-
chanical slackpulling carriage. Members of the logging
crew had considerably different lengths of experience
with cable thinning operations, ranging from just over 6
months for the choker setter to over 10 yr for the yarder
operator. The logging contractor used a hand compass to lay
out all skyline corridors prior to timber felling. Corridor
spacing was capped at 150 ft to limit the lateral skidding
distance to 75 ft. Yarding followed a mix of parallel and fan-
shaped patterns to a series of small roadside landings (Figure
2). Target corridor width was 12 ft, and lengths varied from
480 to 814 ft. No intermediate supports were used. Total area
of the harvest unit was 22 ac.
Evaluation Method
Following the harvest, we conducted a complete census of
the unit, inspecting each residual tree for damage. Three
types of logging damage were recorded: trunk scarring greater
than 4 in. wide; removal of more than 50% of the live crown,
or broken top; and scarring or severing of the root systems.
Scars 4 in. or less in width were not tallied because such scars
generally close within 10 yr and have minimal impact on
future timber quality (Han et al. 2000). Damaged trees were
marked with fluorescent paint to prevent double counting.
The dbh of each damaged tree was measured along with
distances from the tree to the corridor centerline and from the
tree to the landing. Sample data were collected and organized
by treatment and individual corridor-side.
Using the DamQuick methodology, we established sample
plots that were 9 ft wide (specifically, the first 9 ft of the
residual stand adjacent to the corridor) and that ran the length
of the corridor. The percentage of damaged trees and the
sample area were calculated for each plot. The corresponding
harvest area (excluding the skyline corridor) was estimated
by using a planimeter on the logging plan map. Plot- and
harvest-area measurements were then used to calculate the
sampling intensity.
A CF of 44% was selected for the Hebo site, based on
aggregated data from similar cable thinning operations on the
Siuslaw and Willamette National Forests. Specifically, we
examined the distribution of more than 450 damaged trees
occurring across six different silvicultural prescriptions (post-
harvest densities ranging from 30 to 120 crop trees/ac) on two
different harvest units. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) had
revealed no significant difference in concentration factor among
those previous treatments or sites (F1,4 = 1.60, P = 0.275).
Results and Discussion
Actual stand damage from the 100% assessment was
14.2, 11.7, and 5.8% for the 30, 60, and 100 residual-TPA
thinning intensities, respectively. Scarring was the most
prevalent form of wounding, accounting for 68 to 93% of
the damage across treatments. All treatments were charac-
terized by substantial variation in actual damage among
individual corridor sides (Table 1). Nonetheless, the dis-
tribution of damage, with wounding concentrated near

skyline corridors, was consistent with findings by Kellogg
et al. (1986) and Han and Kellogg (2000a). The mean CF
varied from 47.8% for the 60 TPA treatment to 55.2% for
the 100 TPA. The ANOVA revealed no significant differ-
ence in mean CF among treatments, corridor sides, or the
interaction term treatment and corridor side (F5,17 = 1.03,
P = 0.430). Hypothesis tests that the mean CF equaled the
adopted CF of 44% could not be rejected for any of the
treatments using conventional significance levels (30 TPA:
t8 = 0.458, P = 0.659; 60 TPA: t6 = 0.357, P = 0.734; 100
TPA: t6 = 1.14, P = 0.298). Considering these results, we
could infer that the consistency among CFs across treat-
ments and corridor sides indicates that only one CF was
necessary to estimate residual stand damage at the Hebo
site. Landings exhibited a similar damage distribution
pattern as corridor centerlines, with tree damage occurring
more frequently near the landings and less often at in-
creased distances from the landings.
The performance of the DamQuick methodology at the
individual plot and treatment levels is summarized in Tables
1 and 2. Accuracy can be assessed by inspecting the estima-
tion-error columns (i.e., the difference between estimated
and actual damage). Table 1 reveals considerable variation in
accuracy among plots. The range of error values was greatest
for the 30 TPA treatment and least for the 100 TPA treatment
(50.5 and 7.4%, respectively).
The range in estimation errors among individual corridor
sides demonstrates the importance of having an adequate
sample size. When all sample plots were averaged to yield
treatment level estimates of residual stand damage, the accu-
racy of DamQuick improved considerably. Mean estimation
error (standard error) was 2.1% (4.4%) for the 30 TPA
treatment, 1.7% (2.5%) for the 60 TPA treatment, and just
0.7% (0.9%) for the 100 TPA treatment (Table 2). This
performance was comparable to or exceeded the mean accu-
racy levels reported by Han and Kellogg (2000b) in their
evaluation of conventional methods for estimating residual
stand damage. Our ANOVA revealed no statistical differ-
ence in mean estimation error by treatment, corridor side, or
the interaction of treatment and corridor side (F5,20 = 0.750,
P = 0.599). This suggests that the DamQuick approach
performed equally well across thinning intensities. Shapiro-
Wilk tests revealed that the estimation errors were distributed
normally (W = 0.849–0.942, P = 0.093–0.577), with means
statistically identical to zero (t = 0.479–0.779, P = 0.462–
0.530). This implies the DamQuick approach was free of
bias, generating damage estimates that neither consistently
under- nor overestimated the true damage levels.
In addition to yielding relatively accurate damage esti-
mates, DamQuick was easy to implement. The skyline
corridors provided ready access to the stand and eliminated
the time-consuming task of plot location that often charac-
terizes other sampling methods. The 9 ft plot width was an
effective compromise: it was sufficiently wide to capture
the concentration of tree wounding near the skyline corri-
dor, yet narrow enough to permit efficient damage assess-
ment in a single plot traverse. Mean sampling intensities
were 13.6, 19.2, and 16.7% for the 30, 60, and 100 residual
TPA treatments, respectively. These sampling intensities
are relatively low compared to those used by Han and
Kellogg (2000b) in their evaluation of systematic plot,
simple random plot, systematic transect, and block sam-
pling methods. It is interesting to note that the DamQuick
approach attained similar relative accuracy levels as the
more conventional sampling methods but with consider-
ably lower sampling effort. We speculate this was due to the
statistically efficient manner of sample plot location inher-
ent in the DamQuick approach.
Summary and Conclusions
The DamQuick sampling strategy used in this study to
assess timber harvest damage involved systematically estab-
lishing belt transects immediately adjacent and parallel to
primary transport routes. This placement of plots stratified
the stand and focused sampling effort on those areas where
residual damage was most likely to occur. Moreover, the
transport routes provided ready stand access, facilitating plot
establishment and damage assessment. Our experience with
DamQuick suggests that it is easier to implement than con-
ventional sampling methods while still generating accurate
estimates of residual stand damage.
Although the methodology was illustrated and tested
using a skyline yarding harvest system, the DamQuick ap-
proach can be adapted to ground-based skidding and for-
warding operations. Such adaptations would involve estab-
lishing belt transects parallel and adjacent to all or a portion
of the logging trails.
It is important to note that although DamQuick appears
to holds promise as an accurate and operationally efficient
sampling method, three caveats merit further discussion.
First, DamQuick requires accurate measurement of the
harvest area because any errors incurred during this phase
carry through to the final damage estimates. Thus, we
recommend that users of the DamQuick method obtain the
most accurate area measurements economically and feasi-
bly possible. This study demonstrates the levels of accuracy
that can be achieved with a logging plan map and careful use
of a planimeter. An alternative approach could involve
traversing the harvest area boundaries with a global posi-
tioning system receiver and generating area measurements

using a geographic information systems computer applica-
tion. Regardless of the method employed, the importance of
accurate area measurements cannot be overstated.
A second caveat pertains to selecting an a priori concen-
tration factor. Here we used a CF of 44%, which was based
on previous cable thinning experience using like harvesting
systems in similarly structured stands. Although this CF
value was fairly robust across the range of treatments at the
Hebo site, we are not suggesting that 44% be adopted univer-
sally. Rather, we recommend that DamQuick practitioners
develop their own concentration factor(s) based on their
specific silvicultural prescriptions and logging conditions.
Indeed, DamQuick users may find that a suite of CFs is
necessary to achieve a desired level of accuracy across a
range of treatments, harvesting systems, and sites.
Third, one must be concerned with the relatively large
coefficients of variation associated with the DamQuick esti-
mates. Large statistical variation is not unique to DamQuick
but characteristic of all methods used to estimate residual
stand damage (Han and Kellogg 2000b). The root cause is the
nonuniform distribution of damage throughout a stand fol-
lowing a partial timber harvest. Initially, we hoped that the
stand stratification inherent in the DamQuick approach, with
its focus on those areas where damage is most likely to occur,
would yield accurate damage estimates with small standard
errors and tight confidence intervals. Comparisons with the
standard errors obtained by Han and Kellogg (2000b) suggest
that the DamQuick estimates may be more precise than those
obtained using conventional sampling methods. Nonethe-
less, the 95% confidence intervals for mean residual damage
generated with the DamQuick approach have considerable
breadth (30 TPA: 7.1–27.2%; 60 TPA: 4.1–22.2%; 100 TPA:
2.5–10.3%).
Statistical imprecision has serious real-world implica-
tions for timber sale administrators and logging contractors.
Specifically, it can lead to the acceptance of diverse hypoth-
eses. Many management agencies set maximum thresholds
for the amount of residual damage they are willing to
tolerate. If actual damage exceeds the threshold, the logging
contractor may be fined, the logging operation may be shut
down, or both. Two cases of error can be considered, and
both cases proceed under the null hypothesis that actual
residual stand damage is greater than the maximum accept-
able threshold. In the first, the actual stand damage is
greater than the maximum acceptable threshold; however,
the damage estimate suggests otherwise, and the logging
contractor is permitted to continue operating. This is an
example of Type I Error; in this context it translates into
excessive crop tree damage, including potential reductions
in future growth, health, and value of the residual stand. In
the second case, the actual damage level is less than the
maximum acceptable threshold, but the sample data indi-
cate damage in excess of the threshold. This is an example
of Type II Error. If the timber sale administrator were to act
based on the estimated residual damage, the logging con-
tractor would be fined or shut down unfairly. Moreover, the
contractor’s reputation could be damaged, possibly impair-
ing his/her ability to secure future harvesting contracts.
We wish to stress that Type I and II Errors are not unique
to DamQuick. Rather, they are the product of uncertainty that
is intrinsic to all sampling methods. Damage assessors must
realize that estimates are imperfect information regardless of
the sampling approach employed and, consequently, are not
a substitute for good judgment. We recommend that the
practitioner augment the sample size using one of the more
conventional sampling approaches, such as systematic plot,
simple random plot, systematic transect, and block sampling,
should DamQuick yield imprecise or inconclusive findings.
Even then, the nonuniform distribution of post-harvest re-
sidual damage may make precise damage estimates impos-
sible for all but extreme sample sizes.
These caveats notwithstanding, the DamQuick method
appears to be a promising tool for individuals responsible for
assessing residual stand damage.
