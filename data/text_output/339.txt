Analyzing and interpreting
monitoring data
Collaborative Forest Restoration Program
January 2005

The multiparty monitoring handbook series
This multiparty monitoring handbook is part of a series of guides to
monitoring collaborative forest restoration projects. The series was
written specifically for projects funded through the USDA Forest
Service’s Collaborative Forest Restoration Program (CFRP). The
Handbooks in the series are:
Handbook 1—What is multiparty monitoring?
Handbook 2—Developing a multiparty monitoring plan
Handbook 3—Budgeting for monitoring projects
Handbook 4—Monitoring ecological effects
Handbook 5—Monitoring social and economic effects
Handbook 6—Analyzing and interpreting monitoring data
Multiparty monitoring is required of all CFRP grantees; however, the
methods and approaches presented in these workbooks are to serve as
guides and references only. The specific methods are NOT required.
Because there is a wide diversity of projects funded through the CFRP,
many grantees will have different requirements for monitoring and/or
monitoring assistance.
The content of these handbooks was largely conceived at a series of
workshops held in 2003 that were sponsored by the following:
Ecological Restoration Institute (ERI), Forest Trust, Four Corners
Institute, National Forest Foundation, Pinchot Institute for
Conservation, USDA Forest Service—Collaborative Forest
Restoration Program.
These handbooks are updated periodically and the latest versions will
be available on the Collaborative Forest Restoration Program Web site
at www.fs.fed.us/r3/spf/cfrp/monitoring. For more information on this
series, contact the Ecological Restoration Institute, Box 15017, Flagstaff
AZ 86011-5017.
CFRP grantees are also eligible for multiparty monitoring training
workshops and technical assistance from the CFRP monitoring team. This
free service will be provided through September 2006. Call 866.614.8424
for details.

Why analyze monitoring data?____________________________________
The basic purpose of data analysis it to identify patterns of change
in your indicator over time, and to evaluate these changes. Without
doing some kind of analysis, it will be difficult for you to know the
effect your project is actually having.
Data analysis methods__________________________________________
Your data may consist of numbers, descriptions, or images.
Numbers are quantitative data and are analyzed using mathematics.
Descriptions and images are qualitative data and can be analyzed
using tables, maps, or figures. For both qualitative and quantitative
data there are four basic steps to data analysis, but the methods used
at each step are different. In the boxes below you will find two
routes for completing your data analysis, one for qualitative data
and one for quantitative data. Depending on your indicators and
the type of data you collected, you may only need to follow one
route to complete your data analysis.
An indicator is something that can
be measured over time to document
changes in a specific condition.

When to analyze your data________________________________________
It may seem that data analysis is one of the last steps in the moni-
toring process, but we strongly suggest analyzing your data as soon
as possible after you have collected it. This is desirable for a number
of reasons. First of all, looking at your baseline data will help your
group decide what level of change would represent success and set
appropriate target values for your indicators. Secondly, if you
analyze your baseline data before you begin your project you may
identify additional questions that you want to monitor or even
refine your treatment methods to better meet your goals. Later on,
looking at changes in your indicators while the project is in prog-
ress will help your group decide if changes need to be made to the
management prescriptions, or the management process, to better
meet the project goals.
Where to get help_______________________________________________
The data analysis techniques presented in this handbook are not
difficult. Most of them can be easily done using little more than a
calculator and scratch paper. However, you may want may want
additional assistance analyzing your data.
The CFRP Multiparty Monitoring Technical Assistance Team is
available through September 2006 to provide FREE assistance with
monitoring and data analysis to any CFRP grantee. You can reach
us by calling 866.614.8424.
This handbook may also be used by project partners working
together with people who have experience with monitoring anal-
ysis. Is there someone in the community who is willing to help,
perhaps someone who recently took a course in statistics? Nearby
community colleges and universities usually have faculty members
who can help. Assistance might also be found at local, state, or
federal government natural resource or community development
agencies.

1
Understanding your indicator data
For many of the ecological, social, and economic indicators listed
in Handbook 4 (Monitoring ecological effects) and Handbook 5 (Moni-
toring social and economic effects), you will have collected numerical
data. Data represented by numbers are also called quantitative data.
Quantitative data are analyzed using mathematics. Some of the
more common methods for analysis, including some basic statis-
tical tests, are on pages 13–24 and in Appendix 5 of this handbook.
Quantitative data analysis can seem intimidating at first, but the
majority of the techniques presented in this handbook can be
easily done using little more than a calculator and scratch paper.
You also may have gathered data through interviews, maps, or
other methods that consist of words or pictures rather than
numbers. These data are called qualitative data. Qualitative data can
be analyzed in two ways. One way includes systematically
reducing, organizing, interpreting, and verifying the data you have
collected. This type of analysis does not use mathematics. Another
way includes reducing, describing, and then giving numbers to
qualitative categories. This type of analysis will give you both
descriptive information as well as numbers (quantitative data) that
can then be analyzed using quantitative methods. We will discuss
how to do this later in this handbook, on pages 32–33.
Indicators that will produce quantitative data______________________
Below, we list indicators (from Handbook 4 data sheets) that
should be analyzed quantitatively. For instructions on analyzing
these indicators, see pages 24–30 of this handbook.
w Bird and butterfly abundance and species composition
w Tree density and size
w Surface fuels
w Canopy cover
w Height from ground to tree crown
w Understory plant composition
Quantitative data is represented by
numbers.

Qualitative data is represented by
words or images.

w Understory cover
w Extent of bare soil
w Total number of workers employed by the project
w Amount paid to project workers
w Number of acres protected from fire through creation of
defensible space, fuelbreaks, or other fuel reduction
projects
Indicators that will produce qualitative data_______________________
You may also have gathered qualitative information through inter-
views, maps, photo points, or other methods that produce data
more easily described with words or pictures. Indicators that can
be monitored qualitatively are listed below. Instructions for
analyzing qualitative data are covered in pages 31–47 of this hand-
book. Indicators that will produce qualitative data include:
w Landscape openings
w Extent that traditional forest users’ knowledge and
practices are used
w Extent that stakeholders previously in conflict are now
working together on this project
w Quality and timeliness of communication among all
project partners
w Existence and use of written organizational procedures,
rules, and operational guidelines
w Existence and use of financial management tools or
system
Indicators that can produce both quantitative and qualitative data_____
If you have gathered both descriptive and numerical data for a
single indicator, you will want to do a combination of qualitative
and quantitative data analysis. For example, you may have
collected data on your project team’s level of commitment to
communication and group learning by asking each team member
to estimate the number of hours they spend on various activities
related to communication and group learning. This would give

3
you quantitative data—number of hours. However, you may also
have asked project participants to describe, in their own words,
how different project activities contribute to group learning, or to
give their perspectives on how communication is going overall.
This would give you qualitative data—verbal descriptions from
project participants. Indicators that can be monitored with some
combination of quantitative and qualitative data are listed below.
w Classification of riparian plant community structure
w Number and diversity of wood products that can be
processed locally
w Extent that project workers receive health benefits
w Extent that project workers can participate in family and
community life
w Extent that project workers are trained to use and do use
appropriate safety gear
w Opportunities for local families to recreate in the forest
w Availability of and access to medicinal, food, heating, or
building materials from the forest
w Location of acres of defensible space created by the
project in relation to areas considered to be at highest risk
from wildfire
w Level of and commitment to communication and group
learning
w Extent that different perspectives are represented on the
project team and in project activities
See Appendix 6 for an example of presenting qualitative and quan-
titative data together.
Transforming qualitative data to quantitative data_________________
In some cases, particularly when your data is in the form of verbal
responses from a survey or interviews, you may want to transform
qualitative data into quantitative data by coding it. Once qualitative
data has been coded, it can be transformed into numbers and
analyzed using statistics. Coding is described in Step 2 under
Analyzing qualitative data, page 32.
Coding is a process of classifying
data using terms (“codes”) that
describe the characteristic you are
interested in measuring.

4
Target values for your indicators_________________________________
For each indicator that will be monitored, your multiparty moni-
toring team should come to agreement on a target value or desired
direction and level of change for that indicator. For example, you
may have decided that you want to decrease tree density to 60 trees
per acre on your project site, or that you want to increase
understory cover by at least 20 percent. These values can then be
used as benchmarks to help you decide whether or not you are
achieving your goal.
It is difficult to prescribe target values for restoration project indi-
cators in a general way. For one thing, all forest stands and all
communities are different, and one restoration prescription would
not fit all sites. Every restoration project team will define success
in a different way, but many specific values for desired conditions
will be similar to values in other projects. For example, many
projects will want an increase in the number of jobs in the
community and a decrease in the number of exotic plant species in
the forest.
An example of a set of target values for ecological indicators is
presented in Table 1 on the facing page. These are examples only.
Your target values may vary, depending on the goals of your
project. Some version of this set of values might be suitable in
ponderosa pine forest restoration projects in the Southwest. Note
that Table 1 shows sample target values for ecological indicators
one year after treatment. Target values for different time periods,
such as two or four years after treatment, may be different.
For some qualitative indicators, your targets may simply indicate
the desired direction of change (e.g., “more communication
between community members and agency staff”). It is also
possible that you will not have a target value for an indicator. For
example, your multiparty monitoring team may want to measure
the number of sales resulting from different marketing mecha-
nisms to compare approaches and select the ones that work best. In

5
this case, you will be comparing the number of sales from each
approach against the number of sales from other approaches, not
against a pre-determined target value. Examples of target values
for some of the social and economic indicators described in Hand-
book 5 are presented in Table 2.

Analyzing quantitative data
Quantitative data analysis includes four steps:
Step 1 – Organize your data
Step 2 – Analyze your data
Step 3 – Interpret your data
Step 4 – Validate your data
The first two steps—organization and analysis—are important to
accurately interpret your monitoring data. The third step—inter-
pretation—will tell you what changes have occurred with your
indicators. The fourth step—verification—will help you know
whether your data are accurate enough to base management deci-
sions on them. Data verification is also important when there are
different points of view about the best way to reach your goals or
about the potential outcomes of your project.
Step 1– Organize your data
Organizing in one place all of the data your group has collected is
the first step in the analysis process. If your group has used the
Handbook 4 data sheets for the ecological indicators, it is likely
you had to make multiple copies of the data sheets for each indi-
cator. You now need to combine all of the data for each indicator
from every data sheet into a single table. If you have access to a
computer, it is best to put this information into an electronic
spreadsheet (see Appendix 3 for help in making a spreadsheet).
Similarly, for social and economic indicators, you will also want to
compile all of your data into a single table or spreadsheet. For
example, if you are measuring the number, type and duration of
educational and training opportunities for youth, you might create
something similar to Table 3 (next page).
After you have compiled your data, check to be sure that you did
not make an error when you copied the numbers from your data
sheets. Common errors include writing a number in the wrong
row or column, misplacing a decimal point (e.g., 2.45 has a very

numbers together.

different meaning than 24.5), or transposing numbers (e.g., 46
when you mean 64), and accidentally skipping a line on the data
sheet so that values collected for one specimen are actually written
on the line for another.
If a data point is clearly incorrect and you do not know the correct
value, you will need to throw that data point out. If this happens,
you will need to remove that data point from every data sheet, even
if it has been accurately recorded in the past. This is also true if you
have a missing data point on one of your datasheets but have that
point on all of the other datasheets. Do not guess about data or
make up numbers, it is better just to remove it from the analysis.
Always be careful when recording data onto the datasheet and
when entering them into the computer.
Step 2 – Analyze your data
Quantitative data is analyzed using mathematical calculations. To
know which calculations are appropriate for analyzing your indi-
cator data, you must first know what kind of data you have.
Continuous versus nominal data_________________________________
You’ll notice some data were collected by taking actual measure-
ments in inches or feet, such as diameter at breast height. These
are called continuous data. Other data you have collected will just be
tally marks, for example, indicating how many of each species you

counted in a particular plot. These are called nominal data. Qualita-
tive data that you have transformed into quantitative data (pages
32–33) are nominal.
It is important to understand the difference between continuous
data and nominal data, because this is what determines which
statistical test to use. You can do many more types of analysis with
continuous data than you can with nominal data; however analysis
of nominal data can also provide valuable results. Look at the list
below to see which type of analysis is right for the type of data you
have collected. Later in the handbook we will walk through the
step-by-step process of doing each of these tests. You will use these
statistical calculations frequently during the analysis process.
Skewed data___________________________________________________
Sometimes you will collect continuous data with a lot of numbers
that are big or a lot of numbers that are small. These are called
skewed data. This is very common with ecological data. Your data
are less likely to be skewed if your sample size is large (over 30
individuals).
Some statistical tests are more appropriate than others for skewed
data. For example, to find the average of a skewed data set, it is
better to calculate a median than a mean. These tests are discussed
in the following pages.

10
Types of calculations____________________________________________
Mean: Calculating the mean, or average value, for your data set
gives you an idea of the “typical” value for that indicator. You will
probably want to calculate a mean for each of your indicators.
Mean is calculated only for continuous data.
Median: The median is another way of measuring average, in this
case representing the “middle” point in an ordered data set. If your
data are skewed, you should calculate the median, not the mean.
Median is calculated only for continuous data.
Range: Range is the maximum spread of your data, from the
lowest value to the highest value. Calculating range is a quick way
to determine how variable your data are. Range is calculated only
for continuous data.
Standard deviation: Standard deviation is another way to measure
the spread of all of the data points in your sample. While range
measures the maximum spread of your data points, the standard
deviation tells you their average spread. A small standard deviation
means
there
is
not
a
lot
of
variability
within
your
sample—meaning most of the indicators you measured in that
sample are very similar—while a large standard deviation indicates
there is a large variability within your sample—meaning the indi-
cators you measured in that sample are very different. You will also
need to calculate standard deviation in order to calculate the stan-
dard error of your data set. Standard deviation is calculated only
for continuous data.
Frequency: Frequency is a measure of how often a certain
response or value is found in your data. For example, you may
want to know whether ponderosa pine trees are the dominant tree
species on your site. To answer this kind of question you will want
to count the frequency that you found ponderosa pine among all of
the tree species you observed. Frequency is calculated only for
nominal data.

11
Frequency distribution: A frequency distribution is a way of
showing how many times each value was observed. Frequency
distributions are only calculated for nominal data. Creating a
frequency distribution is a quick way to determine whether or not
your data are skewed.
Percentage: Percentage is a way to determine how often a certain
response or data value was observed compared to the total number
of observations. Percent change over time is often used to interpret
indicator data. Percentages can be calculated for both continuous
and nominal data.
Explanations of how you calculate each of these values are
provided in the section, How to do the calculations on page 13–24. In
the section, How to analyze your indicator data (page 24–30, you will
find specific instructions for analyzing each of the indicators
presented in Handbooks 4 and 5.
Step 3 – Interpret your data
Most monitoring consists of comparing two sets of data that were
collected at different points in time. This means that you measured
the same indicators, using the exact same methods, at two different times.
For instance, you probably collected baseline data before the project
began, and then repeated your measurements the next year, or after
your project was completed.
By doing the same calculations on your initial baseline data and on
the data you collected at a later time, you can identify changes in your
indicators over time. Look for patterns of change within your data set
for each indicator. Have the average values or percentages gone up or
down? Is this what you were expecting? Compare your results to the
target values you set at the start of your project (pages 4–6).
Most target objectives state that a specific number or a range of
specific numbers is acceptable. Look at the actual change you
measured and compare it to your target to decide whether or not
you are achieving your goal.
Frequency answers the question
“how many ponderosa pine trees
did we find?”
—
Percentage answers the question
“what proportion of all the trees we
recorded were ponderosa pine
trees?”

12
For example, say your community wants the forest canopy cover to
be reduced by at least 20 percent but no more than 40 percent. If, after
restoration treatments, a canopy cover reduction of 50 percent is
found, then the partners should revisit the thinning prescription and
revise it so that fewer trees are cut in the futures. Future thinning is
then more likely to succeed in reducing canopy cover to the desired
level.
If you only have pre-treatment data, you can still interpret your
statistics and use that information to adapt your management
protocol in order to better meet your project goals. Analysis of
baseline data can be very helpful for adapting your management
prescriptions and setting future monitoring goals. Looking at
baseline data early in the project will help your group set appro-
priate target values for your indicators. Instructions for analyzing
baseline data alone are provided on pages 23–24.
Step 4 – Verify your data
In most case, you will have collected data on a sample of your
study area (for example, trees measured within sample plots), not
the whole population (for example, all the trees contained within a
your treatment area). Data verification is a way to determine if the
change you observed in the sample is representative of change in
the entire population.
Mathematical data verification only works when samples are repre-
sentative of the population. Otherwise the data are said to be
non-representative and cannot be used to draw conclusions about the
population. The best way to assure a representative sample is to
use a random sampling method and to collect a large number of
samples (at least 30). Random sampling is discussed in Handbooks
4 and 5.
Verifying your data will help you know whether your data are
accurate enough to base management decisions on them. Data
verification is also important when there are different points of

13
view about the best way to reach your goals or about the potential
outcomes of your project.
Statistical methods such as the sign test (Appendix 5) can tell you
whether the changes you observed are statistically significant.
Methods such as constructing confidence intervals (Appendix 5) can
give you a range of values that is likely to contain the true mean of
the population you are sampling from. While the methods
described in Appendix 5 can be completed using a calculator or
computer spreadsheet program, many people will want to consult
a statistician for help with data verification.
How to do the mathematical calculations for continuous data_____
In this section we will explain how to calculate the average (mean
and median) value for your indicator, the range and standard devi-
ation of your data, percentages, and change over time for
Table 4 — Mock data for Data Sheet I (partial sheet shown)
Table 4 uses the following abbreviations to record tree species:
DF = Douglas fir, PP = ponderosa pine, JN = juniper

14
continuous data. Remember, continuous data means that each of
your data points is a measurement, such as inches or feet—it is not
a count, such as how many species are on each plot. We show
examples of each calculation using mock data for Data Sheet I
from Handbook 4, Density and size of live and dead trees, and Height
from ground to tree crown (Table 4). Mark the previous page because
we will use the data in this table for many examples throughout
the handbook.
If you are using a calculator, the following steps will guide you
through the process of calculating these statistics. All of these tests
can also be done using computer spreadsheets (directions
provided in Appendix 3.)
Mean__________________________________________________________
To calculate a mean, add all of the individuals and then divide by
the total number of individuals.
Example of calculating mean diameter using data from Table 4:
(1) 12.1 + 11.2 + 5.3 + 6.2 + 13.5 + 12.1 = 60.4
(2) 60.4/6 (total number of individuals) = 10.067
(3) Answer: mean = 10.07$
Explanation: The mean diameter at breast height for all of the trees
sampled is 10.07 inches.
Median_________________________________________________________
To calculate the median, simply list all of the data points in numer-
ical order, from smallest to largest. Then select the middle-most
number. If you have an even number of data points, add the two
middle-most numbers together and divide that total by two to find
the median.
Example of calculating median diameter using data from Table 4:
Use mean to calculate the average
unless your data are skewed.
—
If your data are skewed, use median
to calculate the average.

15
(1) Ordered list of values: 5.3, 6.2, 11.2, 12.1, 12.1, 13.5
(2) Since we have an even number of data points, we will
need to add the two middle-most numbers together and
then divide that total by two:
11.2 + 12.1 = 23.3/2 = 11.65
(3) Answer: median = 11.65$
Explanation: The median value for diameter at breast height is
11.65 inches. Notice that this value is larger than the mean. That is
because there were more large numbers than small numbers in
this data set.
Range_________________________________________________________
To calculate the range of a data set, subtract the lowest value from
the highest value for all data points.
Example of calculating range of diameters using data from Table 4:
(1) 13.5 - 5.3 = 8.2
(2) Answer: range = 8.2$
Explanation: The difference between the largest tree diameter and
the smallest tree diameter is 8.2 inches.
Percentage_____________________________________________________
You can calculate the percentage of your data set represented by a
particular value or response using the following steps:
(1) Count the number of times you recorded a value or
response.
(2) Divide that number by the total number of data points
in the set. This will give you a number less than or equal to
one (e.g., 0.50).
(3) Multiply that number by 100 to get percent (e.g., 0.50 x
100 = 50%).
Range tells you the maximum
spread of your data, from the lowest
value to the highest.
—
Standard deviation (page 17) gives
you the average spread of all data
points in your sample.

16
Example of calculating percent species composition using data
from Table 4:
Using the data from Table 4 on page13, we can determine the tree
species composition using the steps described above.
(1) From Table 4 we see there were one Douglas fir, three
ponderosa pine, and two juniper trees.
(2) There were six trees in the data set. Therefore, we
divide the frequency of each species by six and then
multiply by 100 to get the percentage.
a. One Douglas fir tree/6 trees in plot = 0.17 x 100 = 17%
b. Three ponderosa pine trees/6 trees in plot = 0.50 x 100
= 50%
c. Two  juniper trees/6 trees in plot = 0.33 x 100 = 33%
Explanation: The tree composition on our plot is 17% Douglas fir,
50% ponderosa pine, and 33% juniper.
Example of calculating percentage of survey responses:
Finding percentages for closed-ended survey questions is very
similar to finding percentages of species composition (discussed
above). Basically, you are just looking for a part of the whole.
For example assume that you had the following data from a survey
of project workers:
Monthly pay
Employees
Less than $500
2
$500–$100
4
$1001–$2000
11
$2001–$3000
2
More than $3000
1
Total number of employees
20
Suppose you are interested in knowing what percentage of your
project personnel make over $1000 per month. Using the given
data, you could calculate the following:

17
(number of employees paid >$1000 per month)/(total number of
project employees) = 14/20 = 0.7 x 100% = 70%
Explanation: From these results we see that 70% of the people
working on the project earn over $1000 per month.
Change over time_______________________________________________
Monitoring frequently involves calculating change in a specific
indicator between two time intervals such as before treatment and
after. Most often, this is expressed as percent change over time. For
example, assume we measure canopy cover before treatment and
we see we have 80 percent cover of our plot. We measure it five
years after the treatments and we see we have 64 percent cover on
our plot. We can calculate the percent change between two time
intervals using the following steps:
(1) Calculate the percent canopy cover before treatment, as
instructed above (let us assume it is 80%)
(2) Calculate the percent canopy cover after treatment
(assume it is 64%)
(3) Subtract the pre-treatment percent from the
post-treatment percent:
64% - 80% = -16% difference in treatment
(4) Divide the difference between treatments by the
percent canopy cover before treatment to get the percent
change:
Percent change = (-16/80) x 100% = - 20%
Explanation: From these results we see there was a 20% reduction
in canopy cover between the pre-treatment and post-treatment
measurements.
Standard deviation______________________________________________
Calculating standard deviation is easily done using a computer
program that can do statistics, such as Microsoft Excel (see Appendix

18
3 for help). If you don’t have access to a computer, standard devia-
tion can also be calculated by hand. To calculate standard deviation
by hand, make a table with four columns (as seen in Table 5 below)
and then work through the following steps:
(1) List all of the data points in column A
(2) Put the average of the data points in every row in column B.
(3) Subtract the average from each data point (column A -
column B), and record the difference in column C.
(4) Square each value in column C and place the result in
column D (squaring a number is multiplying it by itself).
(5) Add all of the values found in column D to get the total
sum of squares.
(6) Count the total number of individuals in the sample (call
this total “n”). Now subtract one from that number (n - 1).
Always subtract one, no matter how large your sample size is.
(7) Divide the sum of squares by the value calculated in step 6.
This is the variance for this set of data.

(8) Take the square root of the result from step 7 (the
variance) to find the standard deviation.
Example of calculating standard deviation using data from Table 4:
To calculate the standard deviation of the tree diameters shown in
Table 4, we created Table 6 with four columns, as described above
(Table 5).
(1) The numbers in column A are the same as those in the
second column of Table 4, and represent the diameter at
breast height of each tree.
(2) Column B shows the average diameter at breast height
that we calculated on page 14.
(3) Column C shows how much each tree diameter listed
in column A differs from the average tree diameter shown
in column B.
(4) Column D lists the values in column C, squared.

(5) The sum of the squares = 4.12 + 1.28 + 22.75 + 14.98
+ 11.76 + 4.12 = 59.01
(6) In this case we have six individuals in the sample:
6 - 1 = 5.
(7) Sum of squares = 59.01 = 11.80 = diameter variance
(n-1)

(8)
= 3.435
(9) Answer: standard deviation = 3.44 (by rounding up).
Explanation: Most of the data—about two-thirds of it—will fall
within one standard deviation from the mean. In our example, the
majority of the tree diameters measured are within 3.44 inches of
the mean (or 10.07 +/- 3.44). This means there is not a lot of vari-
ability within your data.
How to do the mathematical calculations for nominal data__________
In this section we will explain how to calculate the frequency
distribution, percentages, and change over time for nominal data.
You cannot calculate mean, median, range, or standard deviation
for nominal data, because your data is simply a count, such as
number of species, not a value, like feet or inches. We show
Table 7 –
Mock data for Data Sheet E (partial sheet shown)
Table 7 uses the following abbreviations to record tree species:
DF = Douglas fir, PP = ponderosa pine, JN = juniper,
AJ = alligator juniper, GO = Gambel oak

21
examples of each calculation using mock data for Data Sheet E:
Seedling density (Table 7).
If you are using a calculator, the following steps will guide you
through the process of calculating these statistics. All of these tests
can also be done in computer spreadsheets (directions provided in
Appendix 3.)
Frequency distribution__________________________________________
Once your group has identified what particular species of trees,
plants, or animals are in your plots, it will be useful and easy to
count how many individuals trees, plants or animals there actually
are of each species. This count of individuals of each type is a
frequency distribution. It is basically just counting how often
something occurs.
Using mock data from Table 7, previous page, we can make the
following frequency distribution by looking at the total number of
each species in column C:
Species
Frequency
DF
3
PP
2
JN
1
AJ
1
GO
3
When you are making a frequency distribution, it will be
important to make sure you are counting all of the data from
each data sheet that relates to that indicator. As we noted earlier,
it is likely your group will need to make copies of the datasheets,
so just be sure you have all of those copies handy when you
actually start counting how many individuals there are within
each species. Once you have made the frequency distribution, it
is very easy to turn this data into a bar chart (see Appendix 4).
Bar charts are a useful way to display data.

22
Percentage_____________________________________________________
Calculating percentages with nominal data is exactly the same as
for continuous data. You can calculate the percentage of your data
set represented by a particular value or response using the
following steps:
(1) Count the number of times you recorded a value or
response (the frequency).
(2) Divide that number by the total number of data points
in the set. This will give you a number less than or equal to
one (e.g., 0.50).
(3) Multiply that number by 100 to get percent (e.g., 0.50 x
100 = 50%).
Using the data from Table 7, we can determine the tree
species composition using the steps described above.
(3) From the frequency distribution table, we see there
were three Douglas fir, two ponderosa pine, one juniper
tree, one alligator juniper and three Gambel oak.
(4) There were ten trees in the data set. Therefore, we
divide the frequency of each species by ten:
a.Three Douglas fir/10 trees in plot = 0.30 x 100 = 30%
b.Two ponderosa pine/10 trees in plot = 0.20 x 100 = 20%
c.One juniper/10 trees in plot = 0.10 x 100 = 10%
d.One alligator juniper/10 trees in the plot = 0.10 x 100
= 10%
e. Three Gambel oak/10 trees in the plot = 0.30 x 100 = 30%
Explanation: The tree composition on our plot is 30% Douglas fir,
20% ponderosa pine, 10% juniper, 10% alligator juniper, and 30%
Gambel oak.
Change over time_______________________________________________
The procedure for finding percent change over time for nominal
data is identical to the method used for continuous data (page 17).

23
Interpreting baseline data alone_________________________________
If you only have pre-treatment data, you can still interpret your
statistics and use that information to adapt your management
protocol in order to better meet your project goals. Analysis of
existing data can be very helpful for adapting your management
prescriptions and setting future monitoring goals.
For example, we know how to calculate the percent change in an
indicator value (e.g., tree density) between two times using base-
line data and then data collected after baseline:
(1) Calculate the percent canopy cover before treatment, as
instructed above (let us assume it is 80%)
(2) Calculate the percent canopy cover after treatment
(assume it is 64%)
(3) Subtract the pre-treatment percent from the post-
treatment percent:
64% - 80% = -16% difference in treatment
(4) Divide the difference in treatments by the percent
canopy cover before treatment to get the percent change:
Percent change = (-16/80) x 100% = -20%
Explanation: From these results we see there was a 20% reduction
in canopy cover between the pre-treatment and post-treatment
measurements. However, if the group has collected baseline data
and already selected a specific tree density as one of its project
goals, you could work this equation in the opposite direction to
determine the exact difference the treatment must make to meet
this specific goal. Knowing the desired result of your treatment
can be an asset when planning treatment strategies or determining
how to allot limited funds among multiple projects.
For example, if your group would like to see tree density reduced
by 30 percent:
(1) Calculate the tree density before treatment (let us
assume average tree density across all your plots is 80%).

24
(2) Determine the desired change between pre-treatment
and post-treatment (let us assume it is 30%).
(3) Multiply the before-treatment value by the desired
percent change:  0.80 x 0.30 = 0.24
(4) Subtract the value obtained in step 3 from the
pre-treatment percent to find what the post-treatment
values must be to meet the monitoring goal of a 30%
change:  0.80 - 0.24 = 0.56 x 100 = 56% canopy cover
Explanation: To meet the monitoring goal of a 30% reduction in
tree density, the monitoring group must bring the post-treatment
tree density value from 80% to 56%.
How to analyze your indicator data_______________________________
You may be wondering how much data analysis is “enough” to
have useful information. This is a difficult question to answer
because it depends on how your group intends to use the moni-
toring data. The most important part of the analysis process is
collecting good data—meaning large sample sizes and data that
were selected randomly. With this type of data, any of the statis-
tical tests will produce valuable information. If your sample
sizes are small or your data are skewed you can still calculate
several of the statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation, percent,
change over time), but you will not be able to verify your data
using confidence intervals. Below you will find step-by-step
instructions for analyzing quantitative data for indicators
discussed in Handbooks 4 and 5. Page numbers in parentheses
direct you to instructions for performing the specific calcula-
tion. See pages 44–47 for examples of presenting results.

25
Ecological indicator data________________________________________
Bird abundance and species composition:
(1) From your data sheets, you have a list of bird species.
From this list you can count the abundance of birds of each
species.
(2) The first measurement, bird species composition, is
simply a list of birds found in the area. Make two species
composition lists, one for birds identified in the breeding
season and one for the non-breeding season. Within these
two categories, separate native from non-native bird
species.
(3) Use a frequency distribution to see the abundance of
bird species (page 21). Track the change in bird species
composition by counting the total number of species at
each time interval those data are collected
(4) Calculate the percent of each species at each time
interval (page 22).
(5) For species of concern, such as rare or problematic
species, you may also want to calculate percent change in
abundance between time periods (e.g., before and after
project) (page 17).
Butterfly abundance and species composition:
(1) You will have two kinds of data on butterflies. You will
have a list of butterfly species, and a series of abundance
values for each species.
(2) The first measurement, butterfly species composition,
needs no calculation. It is simply a list of butterflies found
in the area.
(3) Use a frequency distribution to see the abundance of
butterfly species (page 21). Track the change in butterfly
species composition by counting the total number of
species at each time interval that data is collected
(4) You can also calculate percent change in abundance
over time, for each species, for all species, or for a select
group of interest (page 17).

26
Seedling density:
(1) The data you collected are the number of seedlings
found in each transect.
(2) Use a frequency distribution to see the abundance of
tree species (page 21). Track the change in seedling density
by counting the total number of species at each time
interval that data are collected
(3) Calculate the pre-treatment (mean or median) number
of seedlings across all transects for each species (page 14).
(4) If desired, you can also calculate the percentage of seedling
density for each species across all transects (page 15).
(5) Calculate the percent change in total density of all
seedlings between two time periods (page 17).
Surface fuels:
(1) From your data sheets, you have information on the
amount of woody fuel by size category for two sampled
points on each transect.
(2) Combine the information from these data sheets and
enter the totals into the worksheet shown in Appendix 2.
(3) Calculate the amount of dead downed fuel in each size
class using the methods given in Appendix 2.
(4) Calculate the total amount of downed dead fuel in the
sampled area using the methods in Appendix 2.
(5) Calculate the percentage of wood fuel in each size class
(page 15).
(6) Calculate the percent change in fuel load over time
(page 17).
Extent of canopy cover:
(1) From your data sheets, you have a series of values for
the number of points with canopy cover overhead for each
transect.
(2) For each transect, find the percent canopy cover
(Handbook 4, page 32).

27
(3) Calculate the average (mean or median) percent canopy
cover across all of the transects (page 14).
(4) Calculate percent change over time in canopy cover
(page 17).
Classification of riparian plant community structure:
(1) Find the percentage of each structure type on every
transect (page 22).
(2) Find the percent change in each structure type between
two time intervals for every transect (page 17).
Density and size of live and dead trees:
(1) From your data sheets, you have the number of live
and dead trees per plot, and the diameter in inches of those
trees.
(2) Calculate the average (mean or median) number of
trees per plot, keeping track of live and dead trees separately
(page 14).
(3) Calculate separate densities for live and dead trees per
acre by using the area conversion shown in Appendix 1.
(4) Use a frequency distribution to see the abundance of
tree species (page 21). Track the change in tree species
composition by counting the total number of species at
each time interval that data is collected
(5) Calculate the percent of each species (page 22).
(6) Calculate the percent change in species between two
time intervals (page 17).
(7) Average size of trees (i.e., average tree diameter) can be
calculated using the same methods. Calculate either the
mean or median tree size and range of tree sizes (in
diameter) for all sampled plots (page 14).
(8) Repeat the same steps for dead trees.

28
Height from ground to tree crown:
(1) From your data sheets, you have a series of distances, in
feet, from the ground to the crown.
(2) For each plot, calculate the average (mean or median)
distance and the range of distances from the ground to the
bottom of the crown for all trees sampled (page 14).
(3) Calculate the average (mean or median) distance and
range of distances from ground to crown across all plots.
Understory cover and extent of bare soil:
(1) For each cover type (grasses, forbs, litter and bare soil),
calculate the average (mean) cover and the range in cover
for all of the small plots in a transect (page 14).
(2) To calculate the percent cover of vegetation, add the
percent cover values for grasses and forbs.
(3) For each cover type, calculate percent change in average
cover over time (page 17).
Understory plant species composition:
(1) From your data sheets, you will have lists of plant
species and the abundance of each species.
(2) Use a frequency distribution to see the abundance of
each plant species (page 21). Track the change in plant
species composition by counting the total number of
species at each time interval that data is collected. It is
also important to keep track of native and non-native
species composition. Make two separate lists for native
and non-native plant species.
(3) You can calculate percent change in plant
composition over time, for each species, for all species,
or for a select group of interest. See page 17 for
instructions on calculating percent change over time.

29
Social and economic indicator data______________________________
The statistics you perform on your social and economic indicator
data will depend on the type of data you gathered.
For several of the social and economic indicators, you will prob-
ably only have one value. Examples of indicators for which you are
likely to only have one value include:
w Total number of workers employed by the project
w Amount paid to project workers each month
w Number of community members or households
regularly gathering medicinal, food, heating, or building
materials from the forest
w Number of stakeholder groups involved in project
activities
w Number of acres protected from fire through creation of
defensible space, fuelbreaks, or other fuel reduction
projects
If you only have one number from each time you gathered indi-
cator data, the only statistical test you can perform is percent
change over time (see page 17). In some cases you will have several
numbers for the same indicator. This is particularly common if
you used surveys, interviews, or focus groups to collect your data.
For example, you may have asked several different people the same
question and gotten a range of different responses. Indicators for
which you are likely to have multiple values include:
w Level of commitment to group communication and
learning
w Quality and timeliness of communication among all
project partners
w Extent of community participation in project activities
w Extent of agency participation in project activities

30
If you have more than one value for an indicator, you will want to
calculate the average of all the values. You can also calculate stan-
dard deviation and standard error to determine the accuracy of the
average value. To analyze these indicators, do the following:
1 – Calculate the mean value of each indicator (page 14)

Analyzing qualitative data
Qualitative data analysis includes four steps:
Step 1 – Organize your data
Step 2 – Analyze your data
Step 3 – Interpret your analysis
Step 4 – Verify your data and your interpretation
Step 1– Organize your data
If you have collected qualitative data, you probably have gathered
extensive written notes, transcripts, or other non-numeric data
from interviews, observations, maps, diagrams, or photos. When
gathering qualitative data it is common to end up with interesting
information that may not be relevant to your project. The first
thing you will want to do is reduce the quantity of data you have
collected to focus just on the information that is useful to your
monitoring project. We recommend reconvening your entire
multiparty monitoring team to review the data collected and to
identify which data to analyze and which to leave out of the anal-
ysis.
Begin this process by revisiting your original monitoring indica-
tors. What were the questions about your project that your multi-
party monitoring team wanted to answer? You will want to work
with data that address these questions. You may also want to
analyze data that seem important to your project, even if you did
not identify them at the outset. Remember, you want to keep all
data that you collected in a safe place, even if you do not wish to
analyze it for this project.
If you have gathered qualitative data from interviews, focus
groups, surveys, and perhaps document review, you will want to
further organize your data by coding it. If you are using data gath-
ered from photo points or community mapping, you do not need
to code your data and can proceed to Step 2 – Analyze your data.

Coding qualitative data__________________________________________
Organizing qualitative data involves categorizing them according
to different topics and subtopics. This is also known as coding the
data. The simplest way to code your data is to identify and group
information related to each indicator that you are measuring.
There are three steps to coding data:
1 – Read through all responses to a question
2 – Identify themes and common responses
3 – Code all responses according to themes
Items 1 and 2 are ideally completed with a multiparty team. Each
person in the team reads responses to a question, and identifies
themes or common responses to these answers. As a group, the
multiparty team discusses these themes or responses and agrees on
which will be used to code the data.
For example, imagine your monitoring team used interviews to
identify issues related to small diameter wood utilization. Let’s say
your team interviewed a total of 30 people, including wood prod-
ucts
business
managers,
mill
operators,
cutting
crews,
end-product purchasers, and Forest Service staff. Once the inter-
views were completed, each person from the monitoring team
reads all of the interview responses and identifies themes that
came up in the interviews. Themes can be analyzed either qualita-
tively or quantitatively according to the project’s needs and
desires.
You can use numbers to code, or count, the number of times a
particular issue was discussed, as shown in Table 7. This is just one
way of organizing your data. Another way is to count the number
of times these issues were brought up by people in their different
roles as mill operators, cutting crews, Forest Service staff, etc.
When you use numbers to code qualitative data (as we do in Table
8, next page, by counting each time a theme was present in
people’s interview responses) you are transforming qualitative

33
responses into numbers. Using the coded responses in Table 8,
your monitoring team could say that “timing of supply” was the
most important issue, followed by “size of wood” and “milling
issues.”
You could also follow the steps described on pages 15–16 to calcu-
late the percentage of respondents who selected a particular
answer and other values, or use simple statistics, as described
earlier. Just beware of drawing any conclusions about the larger
population from a sample which is skewed, not random, or has a
sample size smaller than 30 (see Handbooks 4 and 5 for informa-
tion on random sampling).
It is also possible to use coding as an initial way to organize data
into tables, maps, or diagrams for qualitative analysis, as described
below. For example, rather than counting the number of times
each issue was raised, your team might instead pull out examples
of what different project partners said for each issue. This kind of
table allows you to see what different people said about the same
issue and will help you interpret qualitative data. Using tables to
organize descriptive data is described in the next section and
shown in Table 10.
When analyzing qualitative data from focus groups, interviews,
surveys, or other methods, it can be difficult to determine what
information is relevant and how to group your data into

meaningful categories. For instance, you may have dozens of pages
of transcripts from interviews you performed to determine issues
related to the extent of community participation in project activi-
ties. Look for patterns in the data, such as frequency, size, struc-
tures, causes, or consequences, as shown here:
Frequency (how often something occurs)
w How often are community partners invited to take part
in project activities?
w How often do they participate?
Size (how large or how many)
w How many people attend project activities?
w How long do the meetings last?
Structures (different forms of the indicator)
w What are the different types of project activities (e.g.,
field tours, meetings, ...)?
Causes (factors leading to a result)
w Why do people choose to get involved?
w Why do some stakeholders choose not to participate?
Consequences (results of causes)
w How does participation in project activities affect
people’s attitudes toward the project?
Organizing your data in this way will help you to pull out key
issues as well as important differences among your responses.
Step 2 – Analyze your data
Coding (described above) is really the first step in analyzing quali-
tative data from interviews, surveys, focus groups, and some

35
document analysis. The next step, described below, is to visually
display your coded data in a way that makes it easier to interpret.
You can do this by displaying the coded data in tables, maps, or
diagrams.
Tables_________________________________________________________
Assume your multiparty monitoring group was particularly inter-
ested in improving collaboration among groups and individuals
with different perspectives on forest restoration. The group chose
to hold a series of focus groups to gather data on the following
indicators:
w Number of different perspectives represented in project
activities
w Extent of the environmental community’s participation
in project activities
Table 9 — Example of a table for organizing qualitative data
Group 1 –
Project
employees
Group 2 –

36
w Extent that traditional forest users participate in project
activities
w Extent of Forest Service or other agency participation in
project activities
You might then choose to organize your data as in Table 9
(previous page). You would then fill in the table with the data you
had already gathered from interviews or surveys. You could
combine numeric and descriptive data in this table or use a sepa-
rate table to organize the quantitative and qualitative data related to
participation. An example of how it might look is shown in Table
10. Here we see the way people from three of the five groups
responded to “ways that traditional forest users have participated,
and how often.” In practice, you would fill in all the responses for
each of the categories in the table above using quotes from your
interviewees. You should choose quotes, or interview excerpts,
that capture the issues of importance to your interviewees or to
your group.
Table 10 — Example of organizing focus group responses
Group 1 – Project
employees
Group 2 – Traditional

“We haven’t had as much
luck getting traditional
forest users to participate
as we would have liked.
Some came to our initial
meetings, and we have
had some of the fuelwood
gatherers coming into the
project site to get wood.
We’d like to see more
involvement and get more
input into how they see
the project over the long
term.”
“At first I didn’t know the
project was happening, but
since I found out I’ve been
up there a few times to get
wood. Last season wasn’t
very good for pinyon nuts,
so we hope this year will
be better.  My grandmother
said she was interested in
checking the area for
medicinals she collects
every fall. I need to get up
there with her sometime
soon.”
“In the past, people used this
area for pinyon and juniper.
I’ve also seen some women
out there collecting herbs. I
think participation of these
groups has been pretty
good for fuel wood
collection, but I’m not sure
how much other users have
been involved. We issued a
total of 42 permits for
fuelwood, but we only gave
out  one permit for collecting
herbs.”

37
Maps__________________________________________________________
Maps can be used to display interconnections between different
kinds of data. For example, if your group is monitoring how your
project is affecting wildfire risk in your community, you may have
gathered data on areas that New Mexico State Forestry, USDA
Forest Service, or perhaps local fire departments consider to be at
highest risk from wildfire. You could show these areas on a map,
along with any areas where your project has conducted fuels
reduction work. You could also include other important informa-
tion such as the location of structures, important wildlife habitat,
and other areas or points of interest.
Similarly, if your community chose to gather data on different
opportunities for local families to recreate in the forest, you might
have interviewed households to find out where, when, and how
different families recreate in the forest. You could then create a
series of maps showing recreational uses at different times of the
year on the same area of land. By overlaying these maps, you can
begin to see overlapping patterns of use that may help you inter-
pret the data.
You could also use these methods to organize ecological data. For
example, if you collected data for tree size and density, understory
cover, and canopy cover, you could code data collected along
transects in plots so that different colors represent different cate-
gories. You might choose to color 0–25% canopy cover light green;
26–50% canopy cover medium green; 51–75% canopy cover
darker green; and 76% canopy cover very dark green. You could
also use different patterns as in the map on the next page.
You could make similar maps for tree size and density, and for
understory cover. By overlaying these maps, you begin to get a
simple, visual representation of the effects your project may have
had or may be having.

38
Diagrams______________________________________________________
Diagrams can be useful ways to depict networks of communica-
tion, flow of materials, or relationships. For example, assume
your multiparty monitoring team chose to measure the quality
and timeliness of communication among all project partners,
and surveyed project partners to determine how often they
communicate in person, over the phone, or in writing with
other project partners. You could then create a diagram with
different-looking lines (e.g., different colors or dashed and
solid lines) linking project partners who communicate. You

39
could use arrows on the ends of the lines to indicate the direc-
tion of communication (i.e., one way or two-way communica-
tion) and show frequency of communication by the thickness of
the line (or by drawing multiple lines), as shown in Figure 2:
Step 3 – Interpret your data
Once you have organized and described the data, you can move
to the next step and begin to ask what is causing the observed
change. When interpreting monitoring data, you will always be
comparing one set of data with a previously gathered set of data
and asking why there was or was not a change.
This is the stage where your multiparty monitoring team will
make comparisons and consider causes and relationships that
could be responsible for the observed data changes. Which
things appear to lead to other things? Which activities appear to
lead to observed outcomes? Having a team, rather than a single

40
person, answer these questions will help to remove personal
bias from the interpretation of qualitative data.
With some types of qualitative data, the focus is on describing
people’s perceptions, rather than determining whether something
is objectively “true” as in statistics. You may be measuring, for
instance, things like the quality and timeliness of communication
or extent of participation in project activities. In these cases, you
may want to report on the variety of opinions expressed rather
than trying to lump them into a single “result.”
When interpreting your data, be careful not to jump to conclusions
about cause and effect. An observed relationship between an action
and an outcome does not necessarily mean that the action caused
the observed outcome. Examine your data carefully, looking for
different explanations for apparent patterns. Discuss your inter-
pretations among the entire multiparty monitoring team. Ask
yourselves whether your interpretation is consistent with known
research and past experience. Interpretations of qualitative data
should always take into account the possibility that there could be
other explanations for the observed results.
The multiparty approach is critical to the interpretation of qualita-
tive data. It provides one of the best ways to improve the reliability
of your results by having several different people independently
interpret the data and then compare their conclusions.
When interpreting data, your group should be asking yourselves
the following questions:
w How do I know what I know? How might my
perceptions, experiences, and background be affecting my
analysis of the data?
w How do my sources (the people I interviewed, surveyed,
or observed) know what they know? What shapes their
views of this project? How do they perceive this project
and this monitoring effort? How might these
perspectives have affected their responses?
w What outside factors might be affecting the outcomes?

41
Step 4 – Verify your data and your interpretation
Verification of qualitative data means checking your data and your
interpretation for biases. Verifying your data will help you know
whether your data are accurate enough to base management deci-
sions on them. Data verification is also important when there are
different points of view about the best way to reach your goals or
about the potential outcomes of your project.
With qualitative data, verification can be particularly important
when you are measuring issues that may be somewhat controver-
sial, such as different groups’ perspectives on collaboration. The
most common means of verifying qualitative data and analysis is
triangulation. Other methods of verifying qualitative data and
interpretation include examining alternatives, looking for negative
cases, and checking results with respondents.
Triangulation___________________________________________________
Collecting data from multiple sources or with multiple methods is
called triangulation and it helps to verify qualitative data. If data from
several different methods point to a common result, then that result
has more validity than a result arising from only a single method. For
example, you can triangulate your data by having different focus
groups answer the same questions, as was shown in Tables 8 and 9.
The sample questionnaire on the next page (Figure 3) shows how
you can triangulate your data by asking the same question in different
ways. Section A of this sample questionnaire asks for a count—quan-
titative data, while Section B asks for narrative, qualitative data. You
can also triangulate your data by using two different data collection
methods, for example, both surveys and interviews, to gain answers
to the same questions. An example of using qualitative and quantita-
tive data together is given in Appendix 6.
You can also triangulate your data analysis by having multiple
analysts interpret the data and then comparing their results. In a
multiparty group it can be particularly useful to have people from
different stakeholder groups involved in interpreting data from
their perspectives.

43
When triangulating data, methods, or analysis, the goal is not to
look for exactly the same data or results, but to look for consistency in
the data or results. If there is consistency in results from
different methods, then you can be fairly confident your results
are accurate.
If, on the other hand, you find inconsistencies between the
results of different methods, or between data from a single
method, you may need to re-examine the issue. For example,
say you used open-ended survey questions to assess the extent
to which stakeholders previously in conflict are now working
together, and you find that most respondents say there is no
conflict on the project while a few respondents report very high
levels of conflict. You should not disregard the few who report
experiencing conflict. Instead, take a closer look at the differ-
ences between those who report no conflict and those who
report high levels of conflict: is it a certain kind of stakeholder
that reports conflict? Why is the conflict not reported by others?
If your monitoring gives you contrasting results, report on the
inconsistencies. They could be evidence of important dynamics
that will need further attention, or may indicate a problem in
the data collection or analysis process.
Examining alternatives__________________________________________
Examining alternatives means looking for alternative patterns,
themes, and explanations for your data. To do this, try organizing
your data differently and see if it suggests different findings. Think of
other logical explanations for the results you observed and see if they
can be supported by the data. Examining alternate explanations
improves the credibility of your data analysis by strengthening confi-
dence in your data interpretation.
Looking for negative cases______________________________________
Looking

means

outliers—data points that do not fit the pattern, theme, or explana-
tion that you are using to explain the data set as a whole. For

44
example, look at interview or survey responses that contradict the
majority of the responses, and discuss whether there may be other
explanations that may support these responses. There may be
logical reasons why these data points do not fit the overall pattern
(e.g., the respondents may be from a particular sub-set of the
population that has had different experiences than the majority). If
you cannot come up with any reasons for the data outliers, ask
yourselves whether these outliers might make your conclusions
less valid. On the other hand, outliers may suggest changes in your
methods.
Asking your data sources_______________________________________
Asking your data sources to review and confirm your interpreta-
tions is also an appropriate method of verifying qualitative data
analysis. You may want to re-convene a focus group or mail a
summary of your data analysis to people you interviewed or
surveyed and ask them for feedback on your group’s interpretation
of the data. This is an important step that will add credibility to
your findings.
Displaying and communicating results___________________________
Effectively communicating results to the monitoring group or
members of the community is an important part of your moni-
toring project. Depending on who you want to reach, you may
want to share your monitoring results through oral presentations;
posters or short leaflets that give a colorful, easy-to-understand
overview of what you learned; or more detailed technical reports.
Table 11 (next page) lists different ways to communicate results
and appropriate audiences for each method. When displaying and
communicating your results, it is important to remember your
obligation to protect the confidentiality of any interviewees or
focus group participants. You can give people pseudonyms (false
names) if you want to refer to them in a report or presentation, or
simply refer to them as “interviewee #1,” “focus group participant
#2,” etc.

45
Visual tools like graphs, maps, diagrams, and figures are very effec-
tive ways to communicate monitoring results. For example, the
familiar “thermometer” used by the United Way is a simple but
effective way of using a bar chart to display the level of funding it
has received to date. Instructions for making bar charts and pie
charts are provided in Appendix 4. Storytelling, or verbal descrip-
tion, is a valid way to report some data, and can be the most effec-
tive way of explaining results.
Use visual tools effectively and efficiently________________________
Two common mistakes in using tables, figures, and other visual
tools are making too many and making them too confusing. Each
visual tool should be easy for your audience to understand, and
presented in a way that makes sense to them. Instead of presenting

46
a large number of visual tools, choose a few that will have the most
meaning to your audience. If possible, consolidate information
from several tables or figures into a single visual tool. Just be
careful not to include so much information that it becomes clut-
tered and hard to follow. For examples of using visual tools, see
Appendix 4 and Appendix 6. Also see the discussion of tables,
maps, and diagrams on pages 35–39.
Know your audience and know what you want to say to them______
Whatever methods or tools you choose, focus your presentation
on information that is new, relevant to the project and to the audi-
ence, and useful. Do not waste time or space on things people
already know or findings that will not inform the project or the
community. Make sure the person developing these materials fully
understands the data and how they were analyzed, including
reasons why specific statistical tests were performed and the
specific methodologies for each analysis. This is important to
ensure the presenter does not misrepresent information and can
answer questions related to the data analysis.
Provide a balance of data and interpretation______________________
Conclusions and abstract concepts are more powerful when they
are combined with data summaries, whether they are numerical or
qualitative. Do not overwhelm your audience with data, rather
provide enough data that they can understand how you arrived at
your conclusions. Any recommendations you make need to be
substantiated by your findings. For an example of using both qual-
itative and quantitative data to arrive at a finding, see Appendix 6.
Prepare for the critics___________________________________________
In addition to your findings, be able to succinctly describe how
data was gathered, the data itself, and how the data was analyzed.
Be able to answer the following questions about your monitoring
results: How solid is the evidence? How will this information be

47
heard and understood? How might this information be used, or
misused? To avoid misinterpretation and misuse of your moni-
toring results, report your data gathering and analysis methods as
completely and truthfully as possible. If you need to include large
amounts of raw data in your report, consider putting these in an
appendix. Transparency is the key to credibility. Also, larger
sample sizes will always make the results of your statistical analysis
better.

Metric to English conversions:
1 centimeter
= 0.393 inches
1 meter
= 3.28 feet
1 square meter
= 10.76 square feet
1 hectare
= 2.47 acres
Area Conversion:
To convert a value per sampled area to a value per acre:
(1) Calculate the area sampled:
a. For the area of a plot, multiply the length times the
width of each plot.
Example: 30 x 30 = 900 square feet.
b. Add together all plot areas (for total area sampled).
Example: 30 plots x 900 square feet = 27,000 square feet.
(2) Divide the total area (in square feet) by the number of square
feet per acre. (The area of an acre is 43,560 square feet.) This will
give you the number of acres sampled.
Example: 27,000 square feet/43,560 square feet per acre is
equal to 0.62 acres sampled.
(3) Divide the number of trees sampled by the number of acres
sampled. This will give you the number of trees per acre:
There were 50 trees in the 30 plots, 0.62 acres were sampled,
therefore 50 trees/0.62 acres = 80.6 trees per acre.

Downed woody material computation summary (from Brown 1974)_____
To find tons per acre for each size class, multiply (1) x (2) x (3) x (4)
x (5) x (6) and divide the resulting number by (7). See text to find
values for these columns.
To find total tons per acre, add I + II + III + IV to get total V.
Fill in columns (1)–(8) using the following methods:
(1) Constant: This is 11.64 for all size classes
(2) n: For sizes less than 3$, this is the number of pieces encoun-
tered in each size class. For sizes over 3$, this value is 1.
(3) Diameter2: For sizes less than 3”, use the table below to deter-
mine diameter2 based on the dominant forest type. For example, in
the case of ponderosa pine nonslash in the 0.25–1$size class,
simply enter 0.2366.

For sizes over 3$, you do not need to use the table to determine
diameter2. Instead, square the diameter for each piece encountered
and add these squares together. Enter this “sum of squares” into
the space in column (3).
For example, if you encountered three pieces of debris, measuring
3.8$, 6.1$, and 12.0$, you would compute the following:
(3.8 x 3.8) + (6.1 x 6.1) + (12.0 x 12.0) =
14.44 + 37.21 + 144.0 = 195.65
Enter 195.65 into the table.
(4) Specific gravity: Use the table above to determine specific
gravity based on the dominant forest type.
(5) Secant: This is a number which corrects for the fact that pieces
of debris do not lie at perfectly perpendicular angles to the transect
line. The number you use will depend on the size and whether the
pieces are slash or nonslash fuels.

(7) Total transect length: This is the total length of transect line,
calculated for each size class. To get this value, multiply the
number of transects by the length of each transect. This value will
be different for different size classes, since the length of transect
varies for each size class. For example, if you had six transects of six
feet long for measuring the 0–0.25$ size class, your total transect
length would be 6 x 6 = 36. In these same six transects, if each
transect was 35 feet long for the 3$+ size class, your total transect
length for that row would be 6 x 35 = 210.
(8) Calculating fuel load: For each size class, multiply the values in
columns: (1) x (2) x (3) x (4) x (5) x (6). Divide the product of these
six columns by the value in column (7). This will give you tons per
acre for each size class. To calculate total fuel load, simply add the
values in column (8) for each size class: I + II + III + IV. The sum
of these values is the total fuel load of your sampled area, measured
in tons per acre.

Appendix 3 – Using computer spreadsheets
Instructions for setting up a spreadsheet and calculating descrip-
tive statistics using a computer.
Setting up a spreadsheet________________________________________
When you open a computerized spreadsheet, such as Microsoft
Excel, you will see a screen of blank data cells. There will be capital
letters running left to right along the top. Each one of these letters
represents a column. There will also be numbers running from top
to bottom along the left side of the screen. Each one of these letters
represents a row. Each box is called a cell.
(1) Define data worksheets
The data collected during a monitoring project will likely
represent many different indicators. If you look towards the
bottom of the screen, you can see tabs that say “Sheet
1…Sheet 2…Sheet 3.” If you choose, each indicator can be
analyzed and stored on its own worksheet, indicated by
these tabs. This is an easy way to organize the data. To do
this, simply place the cursor on the “Sheet 1” tab and then
click twice. When the words “Sheet 1” are highlighted, you
can rename the tab by typing in a label for a particular

56
indicator. For example, you may want to have one sheet for
adult living trees, one for dead standing trees, and one for
saplings.
w Inserting more worksheets: You can insert more
worksheets by clicking on the Insert button in the
toolbar and then clicking on Worksheet.
w Reordering the worksheets: You can change what order
the worksheets are in by clicking on a specific worksheet
tab and dragging it left or right, depending on which way
you would like it reordered.
(2) Label the columns
Once you have set up the worksheets in an organized and
easy-to-understand way, you can now begin entering the
data. It is a good idea to put a title at the top of every
column to label what the data in that column represents. As
seen above, we have used Data Sheet A: Tree stem density and
size, as an example.
w Adjusting the width of the column: If the wording in
your label is wider than the column, you can adjust the
width of the column by putting the cursor near the
capital letter of the cell you would like to enlarge. Once
the cursor has changed shape into a cross, place it on the
line at the side of the box, click, and then drag the box to
the desired width.
(3) Enter the data and save your work
It is important to make sure all of the data from the data
sheets are accurately entered into the worksheets.
w To change the format of the cell: If there are certain data
you would like to draw attention to, simply click on the
top cell of that set of data, click and drag your cursor to
the bottom cell of the set of data. You will notice now
your data is surrounded with a thick black line. Now
click on your right mouse button to see many options for
changing the cells. If you click on Format Cells, you will
see options for changing the color of these cells, how the
number is represented, etc.
w It is a good idea to save your work often when entering
data. Do this by clicking on the small disk symbol in the
toolbar or by clicking on the word File in the toolbar and

57
then Save As. The first time you save, you will have to
enter a file name. Once you have set the file name, the
program will automatically update the file every time you
save.
Using spreadsheets to calculate descriptive statistics_____________
The mean, median, mode, standard deviation, standard error,
range, and variance can all be easily calculated in a computer
spreadsheet. The following instructions are specific to Microsoft
Excel; however most spreadsheet programs work basically the
same way:
(1) Make sure all data have been entered from each data
sheet and checked for errors.
(2) Click on Tools in the toolbar.
(3) Click on Data Analysis in the drop-down menu.
This function is one that has to be installed. If you do not
see it in the drop down menu, you will have to install this
function.
(4) Find Descriptive Statistics in the menu of choices and
click on it.
(5) Input the data you would like to analyze.
Only put in the data you would like to analyze for one
indicator at a time. Generally that data will only be in one
column. Do not try to calculate the descriptive statistics for
more than one variable at a time.
w Input: Put your cursor in the input range box and click.
Now move your cursor over and highlight the cells
containing data you would like to analyze. You will
notice the data you have selected now has a flashing line
around it and the input box now contains the cell
numbers it will do the analysis on. If you have a label in
the first row, check that cell.
(6) Output options: If you would like to have the results of
the statistical analysis reported in the same worksheet as
your data, then click on the output range box and then click
on the cell where you would like to have the results

58
reported (e.g., the next empty column). If you would like to
have the results reported on a different worksheet, choose
that option. Make sure you select the box for Summary
Statistics. The results of your analysis will look similar to
the table below. Ignore the statistics that are not relevant to
your analysis (such as kurtosis).

59
Appendix 4 – Bar charts and pie charts
A simple but effective way to display your monitoring results is to
make bar charts and pie charts. This appendix describes how to do
that by hand and using Microsoft Excel.
Bar charts______________________________________________________
Bar charts illustrate the frequency of different values or responses
with bars or lines. They are an excellent way to visually display data
your group has collected. You can easily make a bar chart to display
relative frequency of your data points using the following steps:
(1) Put the number of individuals that have been counted
(frequency) on the y-axis (up and down axis).
(2) Put the name of the item being measured on the x-axis
(left to right axis).
Example: We can display tree species data from Table 4 on page 13
to make a bar chart:

60
Pie charts______________________________________________________
Pie charts are a good way to display percentages in visual form if
you are going to be presenting your data in front of a group, in a
report, or even if your group would like to “see” an overall repre-
sentation of the data you have collected. Pie charts illustrate the
percentages of the data visually. The whole pie represents 100
percent of the data.
Example: If you wanted to collect age data on a questionnaire, it
would be easy to display your results in a pie chart.
Age:
18–25 years

26–35 years

35–45 years

Using computer spreadsheets to make bar charts and pie charts____
Before your group is ready to make a bar chart or pie chart in a
computerized spreadsheet, it must first be comfortable with the
terminology and methods explained in Appendix 2. The following

61
instructions are specific to Microsoft Excel; however, they will work
for most spreadsheet programs:
(1) List the independent variables in column A (remember the
independent variables are those that are being measured,
such as tree species or the answer choices for the
close-ended survey questions). These will be on the x-axis
of your bar chart (the left to right axis) or they will be used
to label the “slices” of your pie in a pie chart.
(2) List the dependent variables in column B (remember the
dependent variables are those that have been counted,
either as a frequency or as a percentage). These will be on
the y-axis of your bar chart (the up and down axis) or they
will be used to describe the size of the “slices” of your pie
in the pie chart.
Your worksheet should look like this:
(3) Click, drag, and highlight all the cells that contain your
information. The cells that will be included in the graph
should now be changed to a different color.
(4) Go to the toolbar, look for the graph symbol, and click it.

62
(5) Choose which type of graph you would like to make (in
this function, bar charts may be  called “bar graphs” or
“column charts”). Click Next.
(6) Work your way through the steps that will allow you to
change many aspects of your graph. This may include
changing the color of the bars or “slices” of pie, having the
labels displayed, adding a title, etc.
(7) When you are finished making changes, click Finish and
save your work.

63
Appendix 5 – Data verification
There are many types of statistical tests that can be used to verify your
monitoring data. Providing instructions for all of the possible tests is
beyond the scope of this handbook. The purpose of this appendix is
to present some of the possibilities for verifying your monitoring data
should you want to use more rigorous statistical tests.
Non-representative data_________________________________________
Before you choose a verification (or inferential statistics) test, it is
important to know if your data are likely to be representative of the
whole population. Non-representative data result from sampling
methods that are not random or from a very small sample size. For
example, let’s say you wanted to monitor the extent to which
project workers receive health benefits. If your sample only
included workers employed by established businesses and didn’t
include self-employed contractors, your data would be non-repre-
sentative of the population of workers. Your results might show that
90 percent of project workers have health benefits when in fact,
when the self-employed are included, the real number is more like
50 percent. Similarly, if you hand-picked which plots to measure
for ecological data your data may be biased
If your data are non-representative, you can still calculate several
statistics that will be useful for comparing change over time on
your sample plots. However, you cannot use the sign test or confi-
dence intervals to verify your data and you should be cautious
about drawing conclusions about the larger population or area
based on non-representative data.
Did my treatment make a difference?_____________________________
If you have small sample sizes of skewed continuous data you can
use the sign test (page 64) to measure if the changes between the
pre-treatment data and the post-treatment data were significant
(not due to chance).

64
If you have nominal data and your data are not skewed, you can
answer this question by calculating a confidence interval (page 68).
(Remember, skewed data means a lot of your numbers are big or a
lot of your numbers are small.)
Sign test: This is a good way to measure whether or not the
changes between the pre-treatment data and the post-treatment
data are due only to chance or if the treatment really did have an
effect. The sign test is only used for continuous data and can be
used for skewed data.
Confidence interval: Information from the confidence interval
will tell you what kind of results you would expect to see in the
population at large if you had done the treatment on the entire
population, instead of just the sample. The confidence interval can
be used for nominal data, but is not valid for skewed data.
Other common tests used to verify the type of data you have
collected during your monitoring project include: t-tests,
chi-square, analysis of variance, and linear regression. Providing
instructions for all of the possible tests is beyond the scope of this
handbook. See the references listed in Appendix 8 for additional
resources.
Sign test_______________________________________________________
If you have a sample that has less than 30 data points or is skewed, the
sign test is an easy and appropriate way to assess the results of your
project. The sign test is only used for paired data—that is, data
collected before a treatment and data collected after a treatment from
the same places. The sign test is used for continuous data.
Calculating the sign test_________________________________________
(1) Make a four-column table like the one on page 66. List all
of your data points from the pre-treatment measurements in
column A.

65
(2)
List all of the data points from the post-treatment measure-
ments in column B.
(3) Subtract
the
post-treatment
measurements
from
the
pre-treatment measurements and put that value in column C.
(4) If the difference between the pre-treatment data and the
post-treatment data is positive put a plus sign in that row in
column D. If the difference in negative, put a negative sign in that
row in column D.
(5) Count the number of positive signs. In the equation we will
use, the number of positive signs will be labeled D.
(6) Count the number of data points in column A (this will be
labeled as n) and divide that number by two. This will be labeled as
n/2 in the equation.
(7) Divide the total number of data points in column A (n) by 4
and then take the square root of that number. This will be labeled
as           in the equation.
(8) Plug the values you calculated in steps 4 through 7 in the
following equation to get the z+score.
(9) Use the z+ score to look up the associated value in the z-table
(page 67).
(10) Once you have found the value associated with the z+ score,
multiply that value by 2.
(11) If this number is smaller than 0.05 you can say there are
statistically significant differences in the pre-treatment and
post-treatment data. This is very favorable.
(12) If this number is larger than 0.05 then you know there were
not any statistically significant differences in the pre-treatment
and post-treatment data.

66
Example of calculating the sign test:
From the table above, n = 6 and the total number of positive signs
(column D) = 4
Number of total data points (n) divided by 2:
(n/2) = 6/2 = 3
The square root of the number of data points divided by 4:
z+ = 4 - 3 = 0.82
1.22
Using the z-table (next page; see Table instructions), we see the
associated area for the z+ score of 0.82 is 0.2939. We multiply
that value by 2 to get 0.5878. Since 0.5878 is larger than 0.05 we
can conclude there were not any statistically significant differ-
ences between our pre treatment data and our post-treatment
data. This means the treatment did not have a measurable effect
on the plot.

Confidence intervals____________________________________________
A confidence interval is a range between two numbers that tells you
how closely the average value in your sample reflects the average
value for the entire population. The confidence interval for a
statistic is always calculated for a pre-determined confidence level
using the standard error for your sample data. We will always use
95 percent because it is the most commonly used value among
natural resource researchers.
Remember, do not use a confidence interval if your data are
skewed, were not randomly selected, or if you have a small sample
size. If any of those are true about your data, then the results of a
confidence interval would not accurately represent the population
as a whole. If you have less than 30 samples in your dataset, there
are other statistical tests we can help you do to analyze your data
other than the confidence interval.
Calculating the confidence interval for continuous data____________
A confidence interval includes two numbers: one to represent the
upper limits and one to represent the lower limits. To calculate the
confidence interval’s upper and lower limits, you will need to
know:
w the sample mean (average),
w the z-score (a constant, based on the confidence level; for a
95% confidence level, the z-score will always be 1.960),*
w the sample’s standard deviation (see page 17 for
instructions on determining your sample’s standard
deviation) and the total sample size (number of data
points or n).
* For data such as yours, where we do not have information about the
actual population, we could use a t-score instead of a z-score. We will be
using the z-score because it is easier to calculate and the differences
between the t-score and the z-score are insignificant.

69
Then simply plug those numbers into the following equations:
Upper limits = average +
Lower limits = average –
Example: Suppose your sample of tree diameters had a mean of
10.15 inches, a standard deviation of 3.44 inches, and your sample
size is 6.**
Upper limits = 10.15 +
= 10.15 + 2.75 = 12.90 inches
Lower limits = 10.15 -
= 10.15 - 2.75 = 7.40 inches
Explanation: In this case, we can say we are 95% confident that the
mean diameter of all the trees on the site (our total population) is
between 7.40 inches and 12.90 inches.
Confidence interval for nominal data_____________________________
A confidence interval is a range around your average value tells you
where the average value for your population is likely to fall. If the
average for your post-treatment data falls outside of the confidence
interval of your pre-treatment data, then the change that occurred is
said to be statistically significant. For nominal data you can
calculatethe confidence interval for a percentage (e.g., species compo-
sition at a site) and for percent change between two time intervals,
such as pre-treatment and post-treatment.
** In this example we have a sample size of only six. When calculating a
confidence interval with your real data, it is important to have a sample
size larger than 30.

70
Calculating confidence interval for a percentage__________________
To calculate the upper and lower limits for the percentage’s confi-
dence interval, you simply need to know what your percentage is.
For natural resources data we use a 95% confidence level, which
has a corresponding z-score of 1.96. Plug those values into the
following equation:
Upper limit = percentage + z-score
Lower limit = percentage – z-score
Example: Suppose you were measuring the percentage of tree
mortality from bark beetles. Your group counted six trees out of 100
that had died, making your percentage 6% (i.e., 6/100). The z-score
for a 95% confidence interval is 1.96. The confidence interval for
these values is calculated as:
Upper limit =
Lower limit =
Explanation: In this case, we can say we are 95% confident that the
proportion of the tree population that has died because of bark beetles
is between 0.013 and 0.107 of the whole. So, we can assume with 95%
confidence the percentage of bark beetle mortality within the entire
population is 1.3% to 10.7%.
Calculating the confidence interval for change over time__________
If you have found the percentage change of a specific species
between two time intervals you can calculate the confidence
interval for that value as follows. For this calculation, you will

71
need to know the percentage from each time you sampled (e.g.,
before and after treatment) and the total size of the sample for
each sample. Calculate the upper and lower limits of this confi-
dence interval following these steps:
(1) Subtract the percentage from the second time you sampled
(P2) from the first time you sampled (P1) to find the difference (D)
between the two:
P1 - P2 = D
(2) Find the standard error for the difference between the two
sample times using the following formula:
SE of difference =
(3) Plug the values you got from steps 1 and 2 into the following
formulas to find the upper and lower limits for the confidence
interval:
Upper limit: D + ( z-score x SE of difference)
Lower limit: D - (z-score x SE of difference)
Example: Suppose your group is curious to see if your restoration
efforts attracted more songbirds to the restoration site. The first
time you sampled the plots you found 150 birds (this is your n1)
and 25 of them were songbirds. To find the percentage of song-
birds in the plots you calculated 25/150, or 0.17 (P1) = 17%. Your
group performed some treatments and went back to take measure-
ments the next year. This time you found 160 birds (this is your
n2) and 52 of them were songbirds. This means your percentage of
songbirds for the second year was 52/160, or 0.33 (P2) = 33%. Your
group will use a confidence level of 95% (corresponding z-score is
1.96). Now simply follow steps we discussed above:
(1) Subtract the percentage in second time interval (P2) from the
first time interval (P1) to find the difference (D) between the two:

72
P1 - P2 = D
0.33 - 0.17= 0.16
33% - 17% = 16% change in songbirds from year 1 to year 2
(2) Find the standard error for the difference between the two
time intervals using the following formula:
In this case:
(3) Plug the values you got from steps 1 and 2 into the following
formulas to find the upper and lower limits for the confidence
interval:
Upper limit: D + ( z-score x SE of difference)
Lower limit: D - (z-score x SE of difference)
0.16+(1.96 x 0.05) = 0.26
0.16 - (1.96 x 0.05) = 0.06
Explanation: With this information, we can assume that if the
group performed the same treatments on the entire population
(the whole project area) that it had performed on the sample plots,
the increase in songbirds would be between 0.06 and 0.26 of all of
the birds, or between 6% and 26% of the total bird population.

73
Appendix 6 – Presenting qualitative and
quantitative data together
The following is an example of how to present findings from
qualitative data (such as from interview transcripts) and quanti-
tative data (such as numbers of groups participating, from docu-
ment review) together. Excerpts from the interview transcripts
are used to support claims made in the text, and these claims are
compared against quantitative data to produce a more complete
picture of the patterns of interest.
From interviews of twelve potential or actual project partners
representing nine different organizations, two major obstacles to
greater community participation emerged. The first was
communication. A primary reason many interviewees gave for
not participating more was that they felt uninformed as to when
and where meetings and projects were taking place. There does
not appear to be a standard, consistent place that community
members can find out when and where project activities are
occurring. For example, one potential partner explained,
By the time I hear about a meeting it’s usually already happened
…[our organization] doesn’t have email, so if that’s the way
they’re communicating then we’re out of the loop. We have a
phone and get U.S. mail….I think some people assume everyone
knows when a meeting is going to happen, but I don’t.
The second major obstacle is the timing and duration of the
organizational meetings. Usually held once a month on a
Tuesday evening, the meetings have been known to run longer
than three hours. Several interviewees expressed hesitation at
committing to such a long meeting, as most of the interviewees
work at least 40 hours a week and many spend evenings with
their children or grandchildren. Even some of the most active
project partners identified the timing and length of the organiza-
tional meetings as a frustration, and expressed some sympathy
with those who did not attend.

74
According to one project partner:
The Tuesday night meetings are probably the most frustrating
part. We have way too much to cover in a single night, and
most of us are already tired and itching to get home....I know
of at least a few individuals who went to one or two of the
meetings and then never showed up again. And I understand
not wanting to go through that every month, but unfortunately
those that don’t come on Tuesday nights almost never show up
in the field.
At the same time, eight of the nine organizations (89%) repre-
sented in our interviews participated in at least one project
activity (organizational meeting, field tour, or restoration
activity) and five of the nine organizations (56%) were “regular
participants,” meaning they took part in two or more organiza-
tional meetings, two or more field tours, and two or more resto-
ration projects. This indicates that, despite problems with
communication and frustration about long organizational meet-
ings, there was still a high level of interest in, and support for,
collaborative restoration activities.
In addition, interest and support for restoration, as measured by
the number of different stakeholder groups involved in project
activities, appear to be maintaining or even increasing over time,
as shown in the bar chart below. Between April and October,
stakeholder participation increased from four groups to seven

75
groups, an increase of 75 percent. Our target value was to have a
50 percent increase in stakeholder group participation, a level
that was met and  exceeded. In summary, the interest and
support for collaborative restoration is high but actual participa-
tion by community partners could be improved with better
communication and a restructuring of organizational meetings
to address the concerns of community partners.

categories based on similar characteristics.
Close-ended question: A question with a limited number of
pre-determined answers.
Coding:  Process of classifying data using terms (or “codes”)

Indicators: A unit of information measured over time that
documents changes in a specific condition.
Inferential statistics: Statistical tests used to make inferences or
draw conclusions about the entire population when only a sample
of the population has been collected. Used to indicate how reliably
your sample data reflects the real state of the larger population.
Likert-type: Set of survey or questionnaire response categories
(such as “strongly agree,” “agree,” “disagree,” and “strongly
disagree”) that are used to determine relative intensity.
Lower limits: The lowest number in a confidence interval.
Mean: The value obtained by dividing the sum set of numbers by
the total amount of numbers within the set. An average.
Median: Another average, representing the “middle” value in an

median is the middle-most number.
Mock data: Sample data used to illustrate a concept or methods
for analysis.
Monitoring: The periodic collection and evaluation of data
relative to stated project goals, objectives, and activities.
Monitoring plan: An outline for the steps taken to ensure that
a project is on track. A complete monitoring plan lists a project’s
audience, information needs, data collection strategies, indica-
tors, methods that will be used to collect data, and when, by
whom, and where data will be collected.

80
Monitoring team: The group of people involved in developing
and implementing a monitoring plan.
Multiparty monitoring: Monitoring involving a diverse group of
stakeholders to promote mutual learning and respond to concerns.
Nominal data: Data used make frequency distributions.
Non-representative sample: see “Representative sample.”
Null hypothesis: A formal statement that there is no associa-
tion between two variables.
Open-ended question: A question specifically worded to
encourage respondents to provide their own answers.
Open-ended questions often begin with words like “why,”
“what,” “how,” or “where.”
Outlier: In qualitative data, an outlier is a data point that does
not fit the predominant pattern or theme being used to describe
the data set. In quantitative data, outliers are data points that are
outside the range of the data values that we want to describe.
Outliers can be due to an error in measurement of the value or
simply a rare chance event.
Percentage: A method used to represent the parts of a whole.
The relative frequency of a value or response. Calculated by
totaling the number of times a particular value or response
occurs in a data set, then dividing that number by the total
number of data points in the data set.
Pie chart: A method used to graphically represent percentage data.
Population: A clearly defined set of individuals who represent all
of the individuals with a specific set of characteristics. For example,
all of the trees in plot 1.
Prescription: Any set of management actions designed to
achieve a specific goal.

81
Qualitative data: These are data are described with words
rather than having a numerical value.
Quantitative data: These are data that have a numerical value.
Questionnaire: A written survey document listing questions
designed to solicit information appropriate for analysis.
Random sampling: A method for selecting a portion of the
population for data collection. Every individual has an equal
chance of being selected.
Range: The highest value minus the lowest value in a data
set. An indication of the total spread of the data.
Representative sample: A sample which has the same distri-
bution of characteristics as the population from which it was
selected. Representativeness is enhanced by random sampling
and allows you to generalize beyond your sample to the larger
population and allows the use of inferential statistics.
Respondent: A person who provided data for analysis by
responding to interview or survey questions.
Sample: For statistical purposes a subset of a population.
Significance: The probability that a result is likely to be due
to chance alone. By convention, a difference between two
groups is usually considered statistically significant if chance
could explain it only 5 percent of the time or less.
Skew: A data distribution that is not symmetric, meaning
there are more large numbers or more small numbers. If, for
example, most respondents on a ten-point scale rated the
product a nine or ten, we would describe that distribution as
“skewed.” Refers to the general shape of a distribution of
scores when graphed as a frequency polygon.

82
Stakeholder: Person who has vested interst in the natural
resources or who potentially will be affected by project activities.
Standard deviation: The average amount that all data values
for some variable differ from the average (mean). The square
root of the variance.
Standard error: A measure of the extent that the mean of your
sample data is expected to differ from the mean of the entire
population. Calculated by dividing the standard deviation by the
square root of the sample size. Often abbreviated SE.
Survey: A set of questions posed to a group of subjects about
their attitudes, beliefs, plans, lifestyles, or any other variable of
interest. Surveys may be conducted in person, over the phone,
or through the use of a written form (a questionnaire).
Transparent: Easily accessed and understood; obvious in struc-
ture and meaning. Transparency means that all project informa-
tion, including goals, actions, and accomplishments, is available
to all and clearly understood by everyone.
Treatment: A management action designed to achieve a specific
outcome.
Triangulation: Collecting data from multiple sources or with
multiple methods to cross-check and validate data. Also, having
multiple team members analyze data to cross-check and validate
data interpretation.
Upper limits: The highest number in a confidence interval.
Variance: A measure of the average distance that data points in a
set spread from the mean of that data set.
x-axis: The left-to-right axis that represents the independent
variable.

83
y-axis: The up-and-down axis that represents the dependent
variable.
z-score: A specific value related to each confidence level which
is used to determine the confidence interval.
