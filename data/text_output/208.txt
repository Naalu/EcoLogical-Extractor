New hope for Western Bluebirds?
By Heather L. Germaine and
Stephen S. Germaine
Looking into my mirror I see three
tiny, pink creatures, hardly moving,
yet very much alive. Two other
siblings are still hiding in light-blue
oval packages, waiting for the right
moment to join the outside world.
The parents anxiously fly from perch
to perch scolding my intrusion with a
familiar "chweer, chweer."
Straining my neck and back to get
the perfect look inside this little
world, I count again three young
nestlings and two eggs. Keeping my
time there to a minimum, I climb
back down my rickety wooden ladder
smiling at the proud new parents.
This is just one of the many Western
Bluebird nests my colleagues and I
have closely monitored over the past
few years.
Western Bluebirds were histori-
cally birds of open areas, forest
clearings, savannahs, or forest edges.
However, recent dangerous declines
have been noted for the Western
Bluebird in many parts of its range.
These declines have been attributed
to the removal of large degenerating
trees in which nests were most often
found and to increased competition
for nest sites with House Sparrows,
European Starlings, and swallows.
In addition, the open forests in
which Western Bluebirds were
historically most abundant have
become dense forest stands domi-
nated by young trees that contain few
nest cavities and low numbers of
insects. Due to suppression of natural
fires, current tree densities in south-
western ponderosa pine forests may
be up to 8.5 times greater than a
century ago. These conditions lead to

poor nutrient cycling, increased
potential for large, high-intensity,
stand-replacing fires, and a reduced
ability of pine forests to support
wildlife species supposed to have
been present historically. For these
reasons, efforts to restore southwest-
ern forests are gaining momentum.
Forest scientists from Northern
Arizona University's (NAU) Ecologi-
cal Restoration Institute and the
Arizona Strip District of the Bureau
of Land Management (BLM) are
cooperatively working to experimen-
tally restore 4,000 acres of ponderosa
pine forest in the Mount Trumbull
area in northwestern Arizona. Resto-
ration treatments include mechanical
thinning of trees, slash manipulation,
burning, and reseeding of native
grasses and plants.
In addition, periodic prescribed
burning will be continued in this area
to reintroduce fire into the system.
Restoration of these lands will result
in an 85 percent decrease in tree
numbers. In the next few years, tens
of thousands of acres of western
forest lands will be treated in similar
fashion.
Changes of this magnitude have
great potential to affect populations
of wildlife. Therefore, as wildlife
biologists with the Research Branch
of the Arizona Game and Fish De-
partment, we are investigating the
effects of forest restoration treatments
on a variety of the wildlife groups
that inhabit these forests, including
the Western Bluebird.
Western Bluebirds do breed in
current-condition forests in northern
Arizona, but how would they respond
to restoration treatments creating
forest conditions more consistent with
1 3
descriptions of historical bluebird
habitat? Would nest success be higher
in open forests, or would there be no
difference? Would it be easier for
parent bluebirds to find food for
nestlings in open forests?
To begin answering these ques-
tions, we initiated a study comparing
Western Bluebird reproductive
success between current-condition
(dense) forests and restoration-treated
(open) forests. Specifically, we
monitored the number of nestlings
that survived to fledge, nest predation
rates, nestling parasitism, and the
parental provisioning rate (how often
parents feed their young).
We began by searching for West-
ern Bluebird nests once pairs estab-
lished territories each year. We
located nests by following adult
bluebirds transporting nesting mate-
rial or prey items to cavities. Upon
locating each nest we would visually
inspect the contents of each cavity
using a ladder, a mirror with a pivot-
ing head, and a mini-mag flashlight,
or a micro-video camera mounted on
top of a telescoping pole, depending
on cavity height. We continued to
visually inspect nests every three
days to monitor nesting progress
(e.g., start of incubation, number of
eggs or nestlings, and date of fledging
or failure).
In addition to nest inspections, we
rotated video cameras among active
nests to record parental provisioning
rates. We placed fully camouflaged
cameras within a few meters of a nest
tree with the field of view zoomed in
at the cavity entrance. We recorded
feeding sessions in both the morning
and evening with each taping session

lasting two hours. We reviewed tapes
at a later date to record the number of
times each parent visited the cavity
with a prey item.
Finally, after nestlings fledged, we
collected nesting material from all
accessible cavities and sent it to Dr.
Terry Whitworth, a leading expert on
nest parasites of songbirds. Dr.
Whitworth examined the contents of
each nest for the presence of blowfly
pupae or adults. Blowflies lay their
eggs in the nesting material shortly
after nestling bluebirds have hatched.
After a couple of days, blowfly larvae
emerge and spend up to 14 days
intermittently feeding on the blood of
the nestlings in the nest.
We monitored 64 active Western
Bluebird nests during the summers of
1998, 1999, and 2000; 36 were
located in current-condition forest, 28
were in restoration-treated forest. In
addition, we collected 45 nests to be
analyzed for parasitic infestations.
Finally, we recorded 365 feeding
sessions over the three summers,
collecting 730 hours of videotape!
To date, nest success (fledging of
at least one nestling per nest) has
been higher for bluebirds nesting in
restoration-treated forest than in
current-condition forest. On average,
93 percent of nests in treated, open
forests successfully fledged at least
one nestling, whereas only 61 percent
of nests in current-condition, dense
forests successfully fledged at least
one nestling.
Nest failure can be attributed to
many different factors. Common
bluebird nest predators include
snakes, corvids (jays, crows, and
ravens), ground squirrels, raccoons,
and in urban areas, house cats. Nest
failure can also result from abandon-
ment and severe weather, especially
in conjunction with low food avail-
ability. All of the failures we docu-
mented were a result of predation. We
have video documentation in two
instances revealing gopher snakes as
the perpetrators.
It takes an hour to watch and
record provisioning data from a two-
hour taping session; consequently, we
have only reviewed 210 tapes to date.
So far our data shows no difference in
the number of times adult bluebirds
deliver prey items to nestlings be-
tween the two forest conditions. On
average, adult bluebirds brought food

1 4
items to each nestling 4.5 times an
hour; this responsibility was split
fairly evenly between both parents.
These data suggest a couple of
different things: Either bluebirds are
not food-limited in the dense forests,
or, if they are, the predicted increase
in insect abundance in treated areas
has yet to occur.
Analysis of nesting material
revealed that almost three times the
number of nests in restoration-treated
forest were infested with blowflies.
Ninety-one percent of the nests we
monitored in treated areas were
infested with parasites while only 36
percent of the nests we monitored in
current-condition forest were in-
fested. In addition, infested nests in
restoration-treated forest had almost
five times the number of blowflies
per nest than infested nests in current-
condition forest. The average number
of parasites per nest in restoration-
treated forest was 25; however, some
nests contained over 100.
Most research investigating the
effects of blowfly parasitism on
nestling survival suggests that parasit-
ism alone rarely causes the death of
nestling birds (see Terry Whitworth's
story, Fall 2000 Bluebird). However,
parasitism does result in decreased
hemoglobin and haematacrit levels in
nestlings, and can drain a significant
amount of blood. The weakened
condition of parasitized nestlings may
increase susceptibility to cold
weather, and decrease ability to
compete with siblings for food. In
addition, little is known about the
ability of parasitized nestlings to
survive once they have left the nest.
The effects of forest restoration
treatments on the reproductive
success of Western Bluebirds are
complex; it is not a simple as know-
ing the number of fledglings pro-

duced in the two forest conditions.
Our research reveals that bluebirds
nesting in open forests have a better
chance of successfully fledging
young than bluebirds nesting in dense
forests; however, nestlings in open
forests have a higher parasitism rate
than those in dense forests.
While the increase in nesting
success is encouraging, bluebird
populations will increase only if
young bluebirds survive to produce
offspring of their own. Therefore, it is
now important to study the survival
rates of bluebirds fledged from
parasitized nests in treated forest
areas. Ultimately, we want to know
whether restoration treatments in
western forests will benefit Western
Bluebirds and other species of forest
songbirds dear to so many of us.
NOTE: Our inspection of natural
cavities discussed in this paper is for
the sole purpose of scientific investi-
gation. We take many precautions to
avoid unnatural attraction to cavities
by predators (e.g., checking dummy
cavities, walking different routes to
and from each nest tree, and listening
for presence of avian predators).
Number and availability of natural
cavities may limit western bluebird
populations in some areas and distur-
bance at nests may cause parents to
abandon nests. Therefore, we urge
readers not to begin inspection of
natural cavities unless under the
guidance of a defined research
project.
