Abstract—Between 1925 and 1936, the Fort Valley Experimental Forest (FVEF) sci-
entists initiated a study to examine a series of forest thinning experiments in second 
growth ponderosa pine stands in Arizona and New Mexico. These early thinning 
plots furnished much of the early background for the development of methods used 
in forest management in the Southwest. The plots ranged from 0.1 ac to 5 ac (0.04 ha 
to 2.02 ha) in size and many of the thinning plots and control plots were remeasured 
at 2 to 10-year intervals until the 1940s. The first thinning plots in the Southwest, 
called the White Spar plots, were established in 1925 on the Prescott National Forest. 
The residual trees on the thinned White Spar plots maintained higher growth rates 
than the control until the mid 1970s. The results from these early stand thinning ex-
periments led G.A. Pearson, Director of FVEF, and others to largely abandon uniform 
thinning treatments and adopt the crop-tree thinning method as an improved method 
for thinning southwestern ponderosa pine stands.
Introduction
In 1908, the Fort Valley Experiment Forest (FVEF) was established with a pri-
mary purpose of solving forest management problems in the Southwest (Pearson 
1942). One issue of particular importance was how to manage densely stocked 
young stands of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws. var. scopulorum Engelm.), 
which were numerous throughout the Southwest by the early 1920s. This prompted 
G.A. Pearson, Director of the Station, to initiate the first thinning experiments in 
the Southwest.

Between 1925 and 1936, a series of seven forest thinning sites were established 
in second growth ponderosa pine stands in Arizona and New Mexico (Gaines and 
Kotok 1954). The objectives of these original thinning were to: 1) convert an es-
sentially even-aged stand of second-growth ponderosa pine to a more uneven-aged 
structure through periodic partial cuttings, often referred to as crop tree thinnings 
(Krauch 1949); 2) shorten the rotation period required to produce crop trees of saw-
log size; and 3) determine the volume of wood that could be periodically harvested 
in both thinned and unthinned stands. The crop tree method involved selecting 60 
to 120 trees per acre as crop trees. If a designated crop tree held a dominant position 
in the canopy, then little to no release was prescribed. If the crop tree did not hold 
a dominant position in the canopy, then the crown was freed on at least three sides 
(Gaines and Kotok 1954). In this paper, we list the location, size, and establish-
ment date for all of the original thinning studies established by the FVEF between 
1925-1936, and we describe the earliest thinning study site, the White Spar site, in 
detail.
Study Sites
Stand thinning plots were located in a variety of locations and stand conditions, 
with the unifying factor being an overstory dominated by naturally regenerated 
ponderosa pine. Table 1 provides an overview of each study site. The majority of 
the plots was located in pole-sized stands of ponderosa pine of various ages while 
the Decker Wash and Corey Pasture plots were established in stands of sapling-
sized ponderosa pine (12-20 years old) that established in 1914 (Gaines and Kotok 
1954).

The White Spar plots were the earliest plots established, and are the only ones 
that have been re-measured since the late 1940s. These plots are located on the 
Prescott National Forest in central Arizona. The plots are located at an elevation of 
5,800 ft (1,768 m) and receive approximately 19 inches (50 cm) of precipitation per 
year (Fogarty and Staudenmaier 2007). The soils are derived from granite and are 
fairly shallow (Pearson 1936).
Methods
Upon plot establishment, trees were tagged and their height and diameter at 
breast height were measured and recorded. After each thinning treatment, plots 
were re-measured at 2 to10-year intervals up until the late 1940s. The White Spar 
site consisted of two control plots, plots B and D, and one treated plot, plot A.
To remeasure the White Spar plots, we used the same survey and inventory 
methods that were used at plot establishment in 1925. Measurements were taken 
in English units and later converted into metric units. The original plot corners 
were destroyed, so we relocated trees with historical tags and then reestablished 
a plot perimeter that captured all tagged trees. If the original tree tag still existed, 
we measured the diameter at the location of the original nail and tag. Otherwise, 
diameters were measured to the nearest tenth of an inch at breast height (4.5 ft or 
1.37 m above ground) using a diameter tape. All living trees, which were left as the 
result of thinning in 1925, were cored to determine age and decadal growth rates 
from 1925-2005.
Increment core samples were mounted, sanded, and cross-dated with a tree ring 
chronology from a research site near Granite Mountain on the Prescott National 
Forest (PIPO-ITRDB AZ036; NOAA 2006). After crossdating many cores, we 
adapted the Granite Mountain chronology data and created a chronology list for 
the White Spar plots. After each core was crossdated and inspected, radial decadal 
growth increments were measured.
To quantify radial growth, we converted the radial growth (from pith to last tree 
ring) measurements into 10-year basal area increments (BAI). A BAI is a mea-
sure of tree growth over a given period of time. This conversion was performed to 
account for the fact that distance between growth rings may decrease as the tree 
increases in size even if actual growth rates remain the same (Thomas and Parresol 
1989).
Results
The current status of each original thinning study site is summarized in Table 2. 
Many sites have yet to be relocated and a portion of those that have been relocated 
are no longer in a condition that can be re-measured.
The White Spar site was relocated and the plots were remeasured during the 
summer of 2005 (Figure 1a,b). The thinned plot had a higher BAI until the 1970s. 
Control plot B never surpassed the growth rates of either the thinned plot or control 
plot D. Control plot D had the highest BAI from the 1980s until 2005 (Figure 2).

Discussion and Conclusions
These studies were the first to demonstrate the effects of thinning ponderosa pine 
forests in the Southwest. All seven study sites demonstrated that diameter growth 
of crop trees was increased when competition was decreased (Gaines and Kotok 
1954). Although this does not seem surprising to foresters today, the spacing guide-
lines and potential tree growth for ponderosa pine stands were largely unknown 
when these studies were established.
Ultimately, the results from these early stand thinning experiments led Pearson 
and others to abandon uniform thinning treatments and adopt the crop-tree method 
as a more general thinning guide in southwestern ponderosa pine stands (Pearson 
1950). The findings of these studies were directly applied to timber stand im-
provement guidelines throughout the Southwest (Gaines and Kotok 1954, Pearson 
1940).
The White Spar plots demonstrate that the crop tree thinning method allowed 
the residual trees on the thinned plots to maintain higher growth rates for about 
50 years. Such findings are consistent with that of earlier studies performed on the 
White Spar plots (Gaines and Kotok 1954, Krauch 1949, Pearson 1936). Our data 
also suggest that an additional thinning occurred in the early to mid 1970s, because 
there is a notable increase in radial growth, especially in control plot D. More de-
tails about the pre-treatment stocking levels would be useful and may have shown 
why the thinned plot had a higher net basal area before the thinning treatment

occurred. For example, Krauch (1949) states that many of the pine stands were 
nearly clear-cut 40 years prior to the establishment of the White Spar study site. 
Such information on the stand history is critical in determining conditions prior to 
thinning and suggests other factors that might influence tree growth.
The rigor of experimental design in forestry studies has changed significantly 
since these early thinning trials in the Southwest. The study sites were not randomly 
located or thoroughly replicated. Microsite differences may have had a dispropor-
tionate affect on the results for the White Spar study site and possibly the other 
thinning studies. However, these original thinning plots, established by the Fort 
Valley Experimental Forest in the 1920s and 1930s, furnished much of the ear-
ly background for the development of methods used in forest management in the 
Southwest today.
