hosted by DICE and the British Ecological Society
16. Toward evidence-based conservation practice: a policy framework for co-
ordinating science and practice Abstracts
Organised by:
Andrew Pullin, University of Birmingham, UK
William Sutherland, University of East Anglia, UK
email: a.s.pullin@bham.ac.uk; w.sutherland@uea.ac.uk
Goals:
To debate the value and timeliness of evidence-based policy; 
To identify mechanisms for improving information flow between scientist and 
practitioner; and, 
To reach consensus on the next steps toward providing a greater evidence base to 
conservation practice.
