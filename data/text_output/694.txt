In the ﬁre-prone Western U.S., the scale of surrounding forest density can be realized by homebuyers as an ame-
nity for aesthetics and cooling effects, or as a disamenity in terms of wildﬁre risk. There has been a lack of academ-
ic attention to understanding this duality of forest density preferences for homebuyers in at-risk Wildland Urban
Interfaces (WUIs). To ﬁll this gap, we investigated the inﬂuence of forest density on WUI house sales in four high
ﬁre-risk zones in dry, mixed conifer forests of the Western U.S with a spatial hedonic pricing model. Explanatory
attributes related to house structure, neighborhood, and environmental amenities were assessed, along with a set
of WUI variables that included forest density ranges at two buffer levels— a 100 m radius level and a 500 m radius
level. Results indicate a strong preference for lower forest density at the 100 m level, but a countering preference
for higher forest density at the larger 500 m buffer. These ﬁndings suggest the need to reconsider broad ap-
proaches in public awareness campaigns and regional planning, as well as ﬁre management policies and strate-
gies. Preference for higher density forests implies that if left to homeowners, fuel treatments in public spaces will
be underinvested.

1. Introduction
Expansion of the wildland-urban interface (WUI) has been identi-
ﬁed as the primary cause of rapid increases in wildﬁre-related losses
in the United States (Keeley et al., 1999; Radeloff et al., 2005), Canada
(McFarlane et al., 2011; Goemans and Ballamingie, 2013), Australia
(Mell et al., 2010) and the Mediterranean (Darques, 2015). This is par-
ticularly true for ecosystems that once burned frequently with low-
moderate intensity before old-growth logging, overgrazing, and, per-
haps most signiﬁcantly, ﬁre exclusion (Covington, 2000). Many forests,
especially across the western United States, have experienced declining
ecological health and increased risk of uncharacteristically large and se-
vere wildﬁres (GAO, 2009a; GAO, 2015). Reducing wildland ﬁre risk and
damage within residential developments in the WUI has become one of
the most pressing issues in managing U.S. public lands (Stetler et al.,
2010).
Some of the most complicating factors for managing wildland ﬁre
risk are the costs of ﬁre suppression and risk reduction, and who pays
for ﬁre management. The costs of ﬁghting wildland ﬁres have been es-
calating continuously in the United States, doubling to more than $2.9
billion annually during 2001–2007 from an average $1.2 billion annually
during 1996–2000 (GAO, 2009b). Many studies have investigated the fac-
tors affecting wildland ﬁre suppression costs (e.g. Calkin and Gebert,
2006; Gebert et al., 2007; Liang et al., 2008; Abt et al., 2009; Yoder and
Gebert, 2012). The primary factors that explained the majority of varia-
tion in wildland ﬁre suppression costs, other than ﬁre size, were those re-
lated to the WUI, including proximity to the WUI and the proportion of
private land within ﬁre perimeters. About 897,000 properties (estimated
reconstruction value at $237 billion) in the western U.S. are now located
in high or very high wildﬁre risk areas (CoreLogic, 2015). Expansion of
the WUI is likely to continue in the future, especially in the intermountain
west states where the risk of large and severe ﬁres is ever increasing
(Theobald and Romme, 2007). The majority of wildﬁre suppression
costs are born at the federal level (Gude et al., 2008). Although more
than 30% of total wildﬁre costs can be attributed to defending private res-
idences (Rasker, 2015), there is little incentive for state, county, or local
governments who make land use decisions to curb the development
within the WUI (Gude et al., 2008; Abrams et al., 2015).
Homebuyers, along with locally elected ofﬁcials, may underestimate
the dangers and ﬁnancial consequences of ﬁre-prone forests (Abrams et
al., 2015). By assuming much of the ﬁre suppression and management
burden, the federal government may be providing a perverse incentive
to locate in hazardous areas (Busby and Albers, 2010). Homebuyers' de-
cisions to buy homes in the WUI are inﬂuenced by their preferences for

natural amenities as well as their perceived risk of natural disasters. For-
est cover provides certain amenities, including shade, privacy, noise re-
duction and aesthetics, while too many trees may manifest as
disamenities for blocking viewsheds and increasing the chance of
home ignitions during wildﬁres. This duality makes it hard to effectively
communicate with home owners about the needs for reducing forest
density in the WUI and to inform policy decisions that need to be ap-
plied in the landscape level. With forest cover representing both ameni-
ties and disamenities in high ﬁre risk areas, there is a need to
understand the inﬂuence of surrounding forest density on property
values in the WUI (Venn and Calkin, 2011; Hansen et al., 2014).
In this study, we focus our attention on properties in the dry mixed-
conifer WUI ecosystems of the American west where the rising trend of
wildﬁre risk is particularly severe. The trend is expected to worsen in
the future with higher frequency of ﬁre occurrences and longer dura-
tions of wildland ﬁre seasons with warmer and earlier springs
(Westerling et al., 2006). With limited evidence of forest density prefer-
ences of WUI homebuyers, a primary research question remains: How
does forest density inﬂuence sales value in high ﬁre risk WUI regions,
and to what scale? To investigate this question, we applied a spatial he-
donic pricing model to a set of high ﬁre risk WUI house sales in four
Western regions.
1.1. Literature review: WUI forest density and hedonic pricing
By observing home sale prices in the market, we can discern the
preferences of homebuyers for different attributes of homes in aggre-
gate form. The idea of measuring the value of certain implicit character-
istics of property, i.e. hedonic pricing, dates back many years. The ﬁrst
application of the hedonic method in residential properties was by
Ridker and Henning (1967), where they investigated the association be-
tween air quality and property values. Since then, there have been many
hedonic studies in urban housing markets that show evidence of nega-
tive impacts of poor air quality on housing prices (e.g. see the meta-
analysis of more than 160 separate estimates from 37 studies by
Smith and Huang, 1993).
However, the inﬂuence of tree density on housing prices has been
found to be both positive and negative, making results hard to general-
ize. Although there are many beneﬁts of increasing canopy covers in
communities, especially in urban areas, there are also costs, such as in-
creased ﬁre risk, energy costs and water usage (Nowak et al., 2010).
Thus, homebuyer preferences for tree density depend on the degree of
urbanization in the area (Cho et al., 2008) and the relative scarcity of
trees in the neighborhood (Netusil et al., 2010). Natural amenity values
of forests can vary spatially and temporally depending on forest-patch
size and density (Cho et al., 2009) and can vary based on prevailing eco-
logical, social, and economic conditions (Nowak et al., 2010). Addition-
ally, variations in tree density at the household level can create positive
and negative externalities for adjacent land owners and can inﬂuence
neighbors' efforts at creating defensible space (Shafran, 2008).
Given mixed ﬁndings of direction and scale for forest density prefer-
ences, we view forest density as a blessing and a curse depending on lo-
cation-speciﬁc and behavioral contexts reﬂecting home buyers'
knowledge, attitude, and preferences. Economists treat environmental
amenities, or avoidance of environmental disamenities, as spillover ef-
fects that are typically external (externality) to the measurement of
total economic trade-offs (Mendelsohn and Olmstead, 2009; Mishan,
1974). Hedonic price models are well suited for determining the ameni-
ty or disamenity inﬂuence of a perceived attraction or hazard on a par-
ticular market segment of home buyers. However, hedonic models
assume buyers and sellers have full and accurate information about
housing characteristics and that housing markets are mobile enough
to reﬂect current preference or risk (Mendelsohn and Olmstead, 2009).
The assumption of complete information may be particularly prob-
lematic for homeowner's perception of wildﬁre risk and the ﬁnancial
consequences of experiencing a wildﬁre. Abrams et al. (2015) found a
large discrepancy between community ﬁre risks perceived by local
homeowners and assessed by ﬁre ofﬁcials. Mozumder et al. (2009)
found positive willingness to pay among WUI residents for updated
wildﬁre risk maps, indicating that residents do not have complete infor-
mation. Donovan et al. (2007) found no preference for the level of sur-
rounding vegetation density (e.g., high or low) for WUI homeowners
outside of Colorado Springs, Colorado, despite ﬁnding a decrease in
prices after the ﬁre department initiated wildﬁre risk ratings for individ-
ual houses. Champ et al. (2009) surveyed WUI homeowners in the same
location and found little consideration (only 27% of WUI homeowners)
for wildﬁre risk when purchasing their house. They also found higher
preference for homes closer to “dangerous topography” in terms of
wildﬁre risk (Champ et al., 2009). Similarly, high natural amenity loca-
tions are typically correlated with high hazard risk (Loomis, 2004).
This suggests that in some areas, the attraction of the wilder natural fea-
tures that are typically associated with greater wildﬁre risk outweigh
the disamenity, or hazard, represented by wildﬁre risk.
None of the published hedonic studies were able to separate changes
in wildﬁre risk perception and natural amenities (Venn and Calkin,
2011), as it likely requires the use of survey-based stated preferences
methods as opposed to revealed preference methods. There is little in-
formation on the role of wildﬁre risk on homebuyer preferences in
ﬁre-prone areas (Champ et al., 2009). Even for homebuyers with some
awareness, the full level of risk is poorly deﬁned as many wildﬁre risk
variables are difﬁcult to quantify at the WUI parcel-speciﬁc level. Fur-
thermore, homebuyer's risk perceptions in high natural hazard areas
have largely been shown to be inaccurate for many natural disasters, in-
cluding ﬁre, ﬂooding, and earthquakes (Mueller et al., 2009). So in this
case, complete information is unknown and homebuyers have incom-
plete and varied level of risk assumptions. This is complicated by the
fact that the federal government assumes much of the ﬁre suppression
and management burden, providing a government subsidy to WUI
homeowners (Gude et al., 2008; Busby and Albers, 2010). Federal aid
and assistance for victims of natural disasters is common practice, but
the reactionary nature of federal payments and resources used to help
residents in high risk natural areas (e.g., WUI, ﬂoodplain, or coast) pro-
vides an incentive to locate in hazardous areas (Kim and Hjerpe, 2011).
This incentive creates a market failure leading to excessive risk taking by
individuals with insurance and federal assistance, generating free-rider
effects whose tabs are collectively paid by society (Loomis, 2004;
Talberth et al., 2006; Cavallo and Noy, 2009; Busby and Albers, 2010).
The hedonic ﬁre risk literature has largely been focused on empirical
ex post investigations of wildﬁres (Huggett, 2004; Loomis, 2004;
Mueller and Loomis, 2008; Mueller et al., 2009; Stetler et al., 2010).
They have generally found negative associations between housing
prices and proximity to a wildﬁre. A couple exceptions to the ex post in-
vestigations in the hedonic ﬁre risk literature include investigations of
the effects of a wildﬁre risk rating (Donovan et al., 2007; Champ et al.,
2009) and forest density variation for one community (Kim and Wells,
2005). Hedonic studies of other natural disasters, such as hurricanes
and ﬂoods, showed the effects of recent experience with a disaster on
perceived risk and property values (Bin and Polasky, 2004; Morgan,
2007). Although experiences with a disaster tend to increase perceived
risk and negatively affect property values, those impacts may be short
lived (Atreya et al., 2013). Much less is known about ex ante behavior
of WUI homebuyers before experiencing a close ﬁre. Preferences for for-
est density, prior to major ﬁres, as well as the mechanisms through
which forest density is processed in home owners' preferences, are in
need of further investigation and hold important policy implications
for correcting market failures.
2. Methods
We ﬁrst speciﬁed a comprehensive WUI hedonic price model a priori
of existing data, and then generated a sampling methodology that
would best ﬁt our model speciﬁcation. Once our hedonic model was
57

fully speciﬁed and populated with observational data, we conducted
numerous model and regression diagnostics.
2.1. Specifying a WUI hedonic price model
A house can be thought as a package of many characteristics. For ex-
ample, the price of a house is determined by size, number of rooms, and
natural amenities, as well as proximity to business centers or schools. In
other words, the ith house price (phi
0 ) is a function of housing structure
vectors (Si), neighborhood characteristic vectors (Ni), and location-spe-
ciﬁc environmental amenity vectors (Ei).

Previous hedonic price models for WUI houses are limited to a few
studies and generally include the traditional explanatory attributes of
S, N, and E (e.g., Donovan et al., 2007; Mueller et al., 2009; Stetler et
al., 2010). However, our interest was to isolate surrounding forest den-
sity as a potentially explanatory attribute in the most at-risk WUI areas.
Thus, we incorporate a set of WUI (W) variables that are deﬁned by des-
ignation of ﬁre-risk (Interface or Intermix), proximity to ﬁre stations,
and forest density levels surrounding WUI homes at two proximities
(100 m and 500 m radius circular density buffers). Our hedonic price
model is speciﬁed as:

or statistically as:
P ¼ c þ β X

where P is the WUI house sales price, c is a vector of constants, X is a
vector of house characteristics S, N, E, and W, β is the vector of coefﬁ-
cients, and ε is a vector of error terms.
Following previous literature (Graves et al., 1988; Palmquist, 1983;
Stetler et al., 2010), we have considered a number of structural variables
known to be signiﬁcant in determining the property price, such as lot
and living area sizes, total numbers of bedrooms and bathrooms, and
age of house at the time of purchase. For neighborhood variables, prop-
erties were categorized by census tracts and social-economic informa-
tion was estimated at census-tract level according to the 2010 US
Census. The variables included the WUI city (Flagstaff, Bend, S. Lake
Tahoe, and Missoula), income level of the neighborhood, distance to
shopping and business centers (downtowns), and buyer location. Over-
all, the four WUI regions contained 24 individual census tracts.
Homebuyer addresses were used to classify all WUI property sales to
in-region or out-of-region buyers. Zip codes of homebuyers were
cross-examined with Google Earth ecosystem imagery to indicate
whether or not the homebuyer was located in a similar dry-mixed coni-
fer and high wildﬁre risk area. Additional neighborhood variables were
explored, such as traditional hedonic variables including education
levels, quality of schools, and crime rates. However, our ﬁnal set of
WUI homes was similar enough that there was little variation in these
more urban-oriented variables, leading us to keep them out of the
model.
Three environmental amenities were included in our hedonic func-
tion model—distance of the WUI house to national forest lands,1 dis-
tance to a lake or reservoir, and distance to a perennial river. WUI
variables included measures of forest density, WUI designation as either
WUI Interface or Intermix, and distance to ﬁre stations. Given ﬁndings of
past wildﬁres inﬂuencing house sales prices, we considered including
recent wildﬁres as an explanatory WUI variable in our model. However,
based on aerial imagery, the four regions have not experienced many re-
cent wildﬁres within the WUI zones, limiting the representation of this
variable. WUI designations were modeled as dummy variables. Forest
density was measured in two different sizes of buffers around each
housing unit: 100 m radius and 500 m radius. We hypothesized that
homeowners' preference for forest density may differ for the immediate
surroundings and for the larger vicinity. To control for different regional
forest densities and variations in climate and geomorphology that affect
each regions' wildﬁre regime, forest density was classiﬁed into three
categories for each city: high, medium, and low. The high, medium,
and low classiﬁcation represented even allocation (one-third each) of
each region's WUI house forest density percentages. These forest densi-
ty ranges were entered as dummy variables so they could be combined
with other regions so as to observe any relative inﬂuence of local forest
1 Ham et al. (2012) illustrated that the inﬂuence of surrounding public lands on house
values was dependent on heterogeneity in types of land uses allowed (e.g., motorized
vs. non-motorized, resulting noise impacts, etc.). To account for this heterogeneity, we
have sampled from multiple WUI areas with similar forest types and land uses.

density in these high ﬁre risk regions. A full description of variables used
in our analysis is presented in Table 1.
2.2. Sampling methodology
We obtained sales records of single family residential housing units
for four ﬁre-prone WUI regions for multiple years (2011–2014) and
carefully selected residential development within the WUI only. Our
primary research question was aimed at isolating the potential inﬂu-
ence of forest density variation on house values in Western ﬁre-prone
forests. To do this, we selected WUI areas with similar forest types,
ﬁre regimes, and natural environmental amenities. Market segmenta-
tion across locations, geographies, and environmental attributes can
be a concern for a combined hedonic price function of multiple regions
and needs to be considered and accounted for in econometric analysis.
We employed a sampling design that would ensure consistency in
both the demand and supply structures of each sub-region (Freeman,
1993) and the subsequent vector of coefﬁcients for each region (Haab
and McConnell, 2003), allowing for the estimation of a single hedonic
price function.
2.2.1. Study area selection
The four WUI cities selected were: Bend, Oregon, Flagstaff, Arizona,
South Lake Tahoe, California and Missoula, MT (see Fig. 1).
These four Western communities have similar degrees of urbaniza-
tion and economic conditions (See Table 1), and can all be categorized
as natural amenity-based towns that include many outdoor recreation
and tourism industries and services. All WUI cities are in close proximity
to national forest lands and have relatively high percentages of second-
home ownership. All four cities also have similar ecological conditions
of dry, mixed conifer and have substantial wildﬁre risk in the surround-
ing forests. For example, approximately 13,000 houses in Deschutes
County, Oregon have been designated as “High” or “Very High” risk for
wildﬁre damage, representing a combined total reconstruction value es-
timated at more than $3.4 billion (CoreLogic, 2015). As seen in Table 2,
all four regions contain numerous houses in the WUI.
2.2.2. Geo-data selection and tabulation
Sales prices and descriptive characteristics for over 20,000 houses
from the four Western counties (Coconino, AZ; Deschutes, OR; El Dora-
do, CA; and Missoula, MT) from 2011 to 2014 were acquired from a real
estate ﬁrm. Data were cleaned and ﬁltered to remove duplicates, miss-
ing data, corrupt or incongruous data, and notable outliers. Geographi-
cal coordinates for each parcel centroid were used to display houses in
a GIS layer. Numerous manual checks were conducted to make sure
the coordinates were accurate at high resolution. We obtained National
Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) aerial imagery at 1 m ground sam-
ple distance (http://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/aerial-

photography/imagery-programs/naip-imagery/index) and overlaid
wildland-urban interface (WUI) GIS layers as deﬁned by Radeloff et al.
(2005) and presented by the SILVIS Lab at the University of Wisconsin
(http://silvis.forest.wisc.edu/maps/wui_main). The WUI classiﬁcations
from Radeloff et al. (2005) use the Federal Register 66 (USDA and
USDI, 2001) WUI deﬁnition and include both Intermix and Interface
WUI areas.2 All houses not designated as either WUI Intermix or Inter-
face (e.g., uninhabited or too low of housing density) were ﬁltered
out. Intermix and Interface were then classiﬁed as dummy variables.
The National Hydrography Data set was used for identifying house dis-
tances to lakes, reservoirs, and rivers (http://nhd.usgs.gov/index.html),
and Google Earth was used to indentify house distances to ﬁre stations.
Following a stepwise selection process, we mapped city boundaries
for each region, implemented a 7.5-mile buffer surrounding the city
boundary, and removed all houses from inside the city boundaries.
We were left with a doughnut-shaped WUI zone surrounding each
city (see Fig. 2). The 7.5-mile outer WUI buffer was clipped to our
Land Cover/Forest Area and populated with recently sold houses. Out-
side of 7.5 miles beyond city boundaries in general, housing density rap-
idly decreased and became too low compared to our WUI datasets. The
WUI buffer was created to separate WUI homes based near popular nat-
ural amenity cities from homes in more remote, rural settings. Homog-
enizing the most at risk WUI homes for each city was our priority as
rural homebuyers may exhibit different preferences and demographics
than our sample. Finally, through visual observation, we eliminated
WUI buffer areas with very low or no vegetation cover, such as open
grass lands, water bodies, and golf courses. Additionally, houses located
in land cover dominated by other forest types, such as pinyon/juniper,
were removed.3 Final selected WUI houses are illustrated in Fig. 2.
To determine our forest density WUI variables, each transacted
property in our WUI region was buffered at two distances. Two circles
were drawn around each parcel centroid—one with a 100 m radius
(3.14 ha/7.8 acres) and one with a 500 m radius (78.5 ha/194 acres).
Background land cover allowed us identify “tree” or “no tree” at a one
square meter resolution. Forest density buffers at the 100 and 500 m ra-
dius-level were tabulated by totaling tree and no-tree units. With two
unique tree percentages for each WUI house, we were able to classify
and isolate the inﬂuence of forest density in WUI house sales at a
broad level and at a more immediate level.
Our data were from a 3 year span from 2011 to 2014. To control for
regional market trends and timing, both seasonally and annually, we
adjusted all property sales to a common year (2013) and quarter (2).
We used quarterly housing price index from the US Federal Housing Fi-
nance Agency at the three-digit zip code level.
2.3. Hedonic regression analytics
The hedonic pricing method is a nonmarket valuation technique
used to estimate the inﬂuence of latent housing characteristics by gaug-
ing their individual contribution to overall selling prices. Advancements
in hedonic methods have addressed a number of analytical issues
concerning spatial dependence, multicollinearity, and interpretation of
regression results. Below, we detail our treatment of these hedonic
considerations.
2.3.1. Spatial dependence and hedonic regression
Our WUI dataset represents multiple neighborhoods across four dis-
parate regions. While we have included as many potentially inﬂuencing
variables as possible, there is still a chance that clustering of houses, or
their proximity to neighboring houses, may have an inﬂuence on their
sales price. This spatial dependence was ﬁrst formally stated by Tobler
(1970) and the ﬁrst law of geography: “everything is related to every-
thing else, but near things are more related than distant things.”
Anselin and Bera (1998) deﬁne spatial autocorrelation as the coinci-
dence of value similarity with locational similarity. Positive spatial auto-
correlation is the clustering in space of similar values, whereas negative
spatial autocorrelation describes the dissimilar values associated with
different neighborhoods farther out in space. Two types of spatial de-
pendence can occur. Spatial lag refers to spatial dependencies across ob-
servations of the dependent variable, while spatial autocorrelation
refers to dependence across error terms. Maximum likelihood is a com-
mon technique used for spatial estimation.
Mueller and Loomis (2008) analyzed effects of correcting for spatial
dependence in hedonic property models examining amenities and
disamenities of natural hazards and a wildﬁre risk model. Their ﬁndings
showed small differences between modeled spatial dependence and
spatially uncorrected OLS estimates, but highlight that the small differ-
ences can have serious implications for ﬁnal interpretations and implicit
prices. Donovan et al.'s (2007) WUI hedonic model, however, did ﬁnd
large differences for estimated coefﬁcients in spatially corrected regres-
sions versus uncorrected OLS regressions. Given the numerous ﬁndings
of spatial dependence in hedonic price functions, we investigated this
issue in our dataset and addressed the problem in our ﬁnal regression
models.
Because spatial data typically violate the assumption of observation
independence required by ordinary regression methods (Anselin and
Bera, 1998; LeSage, 2014), we analyzed our data in multiple spatial
models. Our motivation for accounting for spatial dependence was to
limit potential omitted variable bias by estimating the spatial effects of
house clusters (neighborhoods) within each region and to account for
potential house price association with neighbors (e.g., Anselin and
Bera, 1998, LeSage and Pace, 2009). Individual houses receive and
exert inﬂuence on other neighbors just by being in close proximity to
each other (e.g., selling values are often comprised of average surround-
ing selling prices) — a focus of the spatial lag function. We also hypoth-
esize that there may be other explanatory variables (characteristics)

2 Intermix and Interface deﬁnitions from the SILVIS Lab documentation: “The Wildland-
Urban Interface (WUI) is composed of both interface and intermix communities. In both in-
terface and intermix communities, housing must meet or exceed a minimum density of
one structure per 40 acres (16 ha). Intermix communities are places where housing and
vegetation intermingle. In Intermix, wildland vegetation is continuous, more than 50%
vegetation, in areas with more than 1 house per 16 ha. Interface communities are areas
with housing in the vicinity of contiguous vegetation. Interface areas have more than 1
house per 40 acres, have less than 50% vegetation, and are within 1.5 mi of an area (made
up of one or more contiguous Census blocks) over 1325 acres (500 ha) that is more than
75% vegetated. The minimum size limit ensures that areas surrounding small urban parks
are not classiﬁed as interface WUI.”
3 Pinyon pine/juniper forests occur in only two of our four regions and houses located in
pinyon/juniper were generally of lower value when compared to the primary ponderosa
and dry-mixed conifers forests of the WUI. Due to these differences, we excluded house
sales in pinyon/juniper forests to focus on a more homogenous set of WUI homes.

shared by certain neighbors that we were unable to isolate in our overall
model speciﬁcation. These shared characteristics could be a road, a
unique natural feature, or a particular school that could lead to spatial
autocorrelation among the error terms of WUI house price estimations.
These unknown variables may have an inﬂuence on home prices of
houses spatially clustered around them, indicating the need for a spatial
error model.
Estimating spatial models requires the construction of a spatial
weights matrix that can be applied to our ﬁnal functional form in Eq.
(3) to estimate spatial lag, spatial error, and combinations of the two
(e.g., Durbin or mixed). Spatial dependencies across the dependent var-
iable result in a spatially lagged model. The speciﬁed model for spatial
lag becomes:
P ¼ ρW1P þ βX þ ε;
ð4Þ
where P is a vector of house selling Prices, X is vector of house charac-
teristics, β is a vector of characteristic coefﬁcients, and ε is a vector of
the i.i.d error term. W1 is an N × N spatial weighting matrix describing
the spatial lag process, and ρ is the scalar spatial lag coefﬁcient
(Donovan et al., 2007).
If individual error terms of WUI house prices are spatially
autocorrelated, spatial error dependence will be present. The spatial
error model can be represented as:
P ¼ βX þ ε; where ε ¼ λW2ε þ μ;
ð5Þ
where P, X, and β are the same vectors of house price, characteristics,
and coefﬁcients. However, in the spatial error model, ε represents a
combined error term that has a spatially weighted matrix (W2) applied
to the error terms, λ is the scalar spatial error coefﬁcient, and μ is a vec-
tor of the error term (Elhorst, 2014).
With two broad categories of spatial dependence, lag and error, and
sub categories representing the various manners in which they manifest
(i.e., exhibited on dependent variable, independent variables, and/or
error term), there are multiple spatial models that provide for combined
lag and/or error spatial dependence estimates. Two popular models are
the spatial mixed model (or SAC) and the spatial Durbin model. The

spatial mixed model allows for lag and error autocorrelation and can be
represented as:
P ¼ ρW1P þ βX þ ε; where ε ¼ λW2ε þ μ;
ð6Þ
where matrix W1 may be set equal to W2, and the vectors are the same
as in Eqs. (4) and (5) (LeSage and Pace, 2009). The spatial Durbin model,
on the other hand, allows for spatial lags of the dependent variable and
the explanatory variables, or:
P ¼ ρW1P þ βX þ W1Xθ þ ε;
ð7Þ
where the new addition, W1Xθ, represents the exogenous interaction
effects among the independent variables (Elhorst, 2014).
2.3.2. Regression diagnostics
Variables were observed in scatterplots, histograms, and kernel den-
sity plots to investigate normality and heteroskedasticity. Our depen-
dent variable exhibited non-normal probability distributions, being
skewed to the right. Numeric and visual transformation tests in STATA
showed that a logarithmic transformation worked the best in reducing
skewness and kurtosis for the property values (smallest chi-square),
and more importantly for their residuals. There is little guidance on
functional form for hedonic property models (Taylor, 2003; Mueller
and Loomis, 2008; Hussain et al., 2013) and logarithmic transformation
of our dependent variable is consistent with previous research. Based on
data exploration, seven independent variables were transformed to log
and one was estimated as a square root function. Interaction effects
among primary explanatory variables and the four sub-markets illus-
trated similar preference structure of attributes on the demand side,
though some interaction coefﬁcients indicate that supply structures
are not exact matches among sub-markets. Further analysis showed
that regional WUI houses were more similar to WUI houses in other re-
gions, in terms of attributes, than when compared to houses found in
adjacent city limits. Finding homogeneity among the four WUI housing
markets provided conﬁdence that inclusion of regional dummies gener-
ated appropriate intercept shifts so as to estimate a single hedonic price
function.
Summary statistics and basic correlations were investigated and a
set of diagnostic tests were used to determine if multicollinearity or
heteroskedasticity
remained
problems.
A
White's
Test
on
heteroskedasticity led us to use Huber-White robust standard errors
in our ﬁnal analysis. Multicollinearity is especially problematic for he-
donic pricing models, given the inclusion of similar yet distinct housing
attributes such as the number of bathrooms and the number of bed-
rooms (Hussain et al., 2013). While some degree of multicollinearity
will always be present (Stewart, 2005), we employed various testing
of the degree and scale of correlation among our hedonic pricing attri-
butes to help estimate the most relevant model speciﬁcation. Variance
inﬂation factors (VIF) for all variables were determined, along with
overall model condition numbers. These diagnostics led to the removal
of four variables from our ﬁnal model speciﬁcation due to high correla-
tions with other variables: bedrooms, year built, income, and distance to
river. Our ﬁnal model estimated had a condition number of 17.02, which
is in the optimal range between 10 and 30 as suggested by Gujarati
(1998).
A Moran's I Test indicated the presence of spatial autocorrelation in
our communities (p = 0.000), requiring the use of spatial error and lag
models. A spatial weights matrix and eigenvalue vectors were generat-
ed and applied to our spatial regression. We used an inverse-distance
spatial weights matrix as recommended by Mueller and Loomis
(2008). Sensitivity analysis of varying band distances revealed robust
results largely insensitive to neighbor distance delineations. Under our
spatial weights matrix, parcels across regions are not considered neigh-
bors. Our distance band used was 3 km. The diagonal elements are
zeroes while the off diagonal elements are the weighted average of
the particular neighborhood, where rows sum to one. At less than
3 km, we began to see a few islands (houses with no neighbors) and a
sparse matrix.
Prior to spatial regressions, spatially uncorrected OLS regressions
were estimated and retained for comparison. Estimate statistics such
as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criteri-
on (BIC) were tabulated and used for guidance on preferred models. Ini-
tial OLS regressions were estimated as generalized linear models (GLM)
so as to obtain comparison criteria to our spatial regressions. Based on
maximum likelihood estimates, and AIC and BIC stats, the spatial regres-
sions were shown to be a superior ﬁt for our data over the spatially un-
corrected OLS regression.
The Moran's I Test provided for a ﬁrst view of spatial dependence in
our sample. To get more details on the nature of the spatial dependency
in our communities, we estimated robust Lagrange Multipliers (LM) for
the weights matrix after an OLS speciﬁcation. Starting with a non-spatial
linear regression and then investigating whether or not to move to a
spatial regression is known as the speciﬁc-to-general approach
(Elhorst, 2014). The robust LMs indicated that the spatial lag process
was likely present in our sample (p = 0.051), but that spatial error pro-
cess might not be present (p = 0.228). We continued to estimate four
spatial models: the lag, error, Durbin, and mixed (see Eqs. (4)-(7)).
However, as indicated by the robust LM tests, the spatial lag model
was ultimately the best speciﬁcation.
The four spatial models were estimated using maximum likelihood
and evaluated based on the following model selection criteria: signiﬁ-
cance of rho and lambda (the scalar coefﬁcients for lag and error pro-
cess), log likelihood function, the AIC, and the BIC. The individual
spatial dependence models, lag and error, were better speciﬁed than
the combination spatial models and we present the criteria estimates
for the lag and error models in Table 4. Of the spatial lag and error
models, the lag model had the lower AIC and BIC and the larger log like-
lihood estimate.
Both the lag and error models yielded a signiﬁcant rho estimate
(p = 0.053) and lambda estimate (p = 0.059). In the combined spatial
models (Durbin and mixed) however, neither individual rho nor lamb-
da were signiﬁcant, and the AIC and BIC estimates were substantially
larger. The log likelihood estimates are not as comparable across the
four spatial models due to different degrees of freedom, as the com-
bined spatial models have interaction parameters along with the ex-
planatory variables. AIC and BIC incorporate penalties for greater
model parameters, whereas the log likelihood function does not
(Stewart, 2005). As a result, AIC and BIC are better suited for evaluating
the speciﬁcation of multiple spatial models. Based on speciﬁcation tests
for four spatial models of our data, the spatial lag model is preferred,
with the spatial error model being next preferred.
2.3.3. Regression interpretation: implicit prices
The hedonic pricing method is a nonmarket valuation technique that
allows for the estimation of preferences for nonmarket attributes such
as forest density on housing prices. Partial derivatives of the attributes
are obtained and can be interpreted as implicit marginal prices for
those attributes. That is, the hedonic regression coefﬁcients of attributes
measure the rate of change in house price with respect to a one unit
change in the attribute. These coefﬁcients can be used to infer house-
holds' WTP for marginal changes in the level of WUI house
attributes—and is why they are termed implicit prices (Loomis, 2004).
Evaluation of attributes in a linear hedonic model is straightforward,
where attribute coefﬁcients represent the dollar increase or decrease in
home selling value associated with an additional unit of the attribute. In
transformed functional models, such as the semilog model, coefﬁcients
of attributes typically represent elasticities, where coefﬁcients are a per-
centage that is applied to the house value. Interpretation of dummy var-
iable coefﬁcients, however, is a bit more nuanced because they
represent relatively large changes in the dependent variable.
62
E. Hjerpe et al. / Forest Policy and Economics 70 (2016) 56–66

To interpret our regression coefﬁcients, we incorporate interpretive
expressions for our semilog model illustrated by Kennedy (1981) and
Stewart (2005) and applied to a hedonic price function by Hussain et
al. (2013). Speciﬁcally, the implicit price expression used for continu-
ous, non-transformed explanatory variables is:
IMPBathrooms ¼ β1  AdjSalesPrice:
ð8Þ
For explanatory variables measured in logarithms:
IMPLivingArea ¼ β1
AdjSalesPrice
LivingArea


:
ð9Þ
But, for discrete explanatory variables such as dummies, treating at-
tribute coefﬁcients as direct elasticities as done above results in a heavi-
ly biased estimator (Stewart, 2005). This is because a large absolute
change in binary variables (e.g., going from high, to medium, to low for-
est density) represents a relatively large change in our dependent vari-
able (WUI house sale price); whereas applying coefﬁcients directly as
done in the case of continuous variables captures smaller changes at a
ﬁner scale, resulting in less biased estimators. Thus, we use Kennedy's
(1981) estimator to reduce bias for interpreting our WUI dummy vari-
ables:
IMPForestDensity ¼

β1

AdjSalesPrice;
ð10Þ
where s is the standard error of the ForestDensity dummy variable.
Additionally, a spatial multiplier may exist when local spillover ef-
fects result in further neighborhood house price adjustments. Spillover
effects can be incorporated into the model resulting in a set of indirect
effects. Indirect effects occur when neighboring house values inﬂuence
the observed house sales price in that neighborhood, as is often the
case with real estate markets. So beyond the direct effects of spatially
corrected regression coefﬁcients calculated above in Eqs. (8)-(10),
there may be indirect spatial spillover effects that need to be interpreted
for ﬁnal marginal implicit price calculations. Kim et al. (2003) deﬁne the
spatial multiplier as the sum of each row of the inverse matrix of row-
standardized spatial weights, or 1 / (1 −ρ), if a unit change were in-
duced at every location. Adding this to Eq. (8), we have a ﬁnal implicit
price expression of:
IMPBathrooms ¼ β1  AdjSalesPrice 
1
1−ρ


;
ð11Þ
where the scalar parameter ρ is the coefﬁcient for the spatial lag
process.
The spatial error model does not allow for the estimation of indirect,
or spillover, effects. Our Eq. (11) illustrates an implicit price estimation
adjustment when using the spatial lag model or the spatial mixed model
(SAC). Elhorst (2014) illustrates that the ratio of spillover effects to di-
rect effects under the lag and mixed models is the same for every ex-
planatory variable, meaning that one general spatial multiplier is
applied to all variables. In many cases however, each explanatory vari-
able may have a unique spatial multiplier that can be difﬁcult to isolate.
For advanced interpretation of spatial multipliers for numerous spatial
speciﬁcations see LeSage and Pace (2009) and Elhorst (2014).
3. Results
After the spatial delineation described in Section 2.2.2, we had 418
property sales records from four communities. Table 3 shows summary
statistics for the dependent and independent variables in our model.
Our dependent variable is the log of adjusted home sale prices. Average
home sale prices in our sample was $358,380 in adjusted 2013 prices,
which is higher than the average prices of all four cities where the
study sites are located. Higher house values can be explained by the
fact that residential properties built in WUI areas tend to be quite a bit
larger than those in urban centers (averaging 2100 sq. ft., or 195 sq.
m. in our dataset), and are located on much larger parcel sizes (mean
WUI lot size was 1.3 acres, or 0.53 ha. in our dataset).
We present the results from both the spatial error and lag models in
Table 4. However, with lower AIC and BIC estimates and a higher log-
likelihood statistic (closer to zero), we focus our presentation of results
in the text on the spatial lag model. Some of the results followed our
general expectation. For example, larger houses with more bathrooms
were sold at higher prices. Housing prices tend to be higher in the
WUI area in California than places in other states. However, a few de-
scriptor variables such as proximity to shopping, buyer location, prox-
imity to public forests, WUI designation (Interface or Intermix), and
distance to ﬁre station were not signiﬁcant.
One of the most important ﬁndings was that forest density prefer-
ences of home owners vary for different buffer sizes. At more immediate
proximity (100 m buffer) and holding all other attributes constant, we
ﬁnd that WUI homebuyers prefer low forest density in close vicinity of
a house (100 m buffer). Speciﬁcally, results of our spatial lag model
show a $37,910 decrease (p = 0.006) in WUI house value when moving
from low forest density to medium forest density at the 100 m buffer
level, and a $26,499 decrease (p = 0.060) when comparing low to
high forest density. The interpreted implicit prices illustrate a convex
demand function where the price decrease is greatest between low
and medium density (see Fig. 3).
At the 500 m forest density buffer however, higher density was pre-
ferred. Results indicate a $29,529 decrease (p = 0.044) when moving
from high to low forest density, and a $25,573 decrease (p = 0.053) in
WUI home value when comparing high forest density to medium and

low densities combined. The difference of moving from high forest den-
sity to medium forest density for the 500 m buffer was barely insigniﬁ-
cant (p = 0.123), with a smaller coefﬁcient than comparing high to low
density. In this case, implicit prices illustrate a ﬂatter decreasing de-
mand function for broad level forest density preference in the WUI
when comparing high, medium, and low forest densities.
4. Discussion
For western dry-mixed conifer WUI regions of the U.S., we see that
forest density in close proximity to WUI homes (100 m radius) is nega-
tively associated with house values, as denser forests are realized as a
net disamenity. Expanding a WUI property's forest density buffer out
to the 500 m radius-level, however, shows a positive association with
proximate forest density, being realized as a net amenity. The conﬂict-
ing scales of WUI homebuyer preferences illustrate the push and pull ef-
fects of forests surrounding the examined natural amenity cities.
In surveys of WUI residents, Brenkert–Smith et al. (2006) noted con-
ﬂiction among residents concerning the tradeoffs associated with main-
taining certain aesthetics and views as compared to reducing or
increasing forest density of individual properties. While it is difﬁcult to
dis-entangle amenity and view effects related to forests from effects as-
sociated with ﬁre risk perception, it is likely that ﬁre risk is being capi-
talized into WUI homebuyer preferences. Our study shows that forest
density is ﬁgured into homeowners' preference in different ways de-
pending on the location, which has important policy implications.
Knowing these preferences can help identify home owners most in
need of wildﬁre information and awareness programs, can identify re-
gions where cost-sharing of ﬁre management funds might be most op-
timal, and can be tracked over time to determine trends.
Assuming that wildﬁre risk perceptions of WUI homebuyers are par-
tially responsible for the preference associated with varying forest den-
sity, we consider a few explanations. First, the preference for lower
density forests in the immediate vicinity of homes (100 m) suggests

wildﬁres has been increasing from an average of 209 structures per
year lost to wildﬁre in the 1960's to 2726 structures per year in the
2000's (insurance claims for structure losses in the WUI averaged
$800 million/year) (ICC, 2008). Existing WUI homeowners have more
awareness and incentives to reduce fuels on their properties. Preference
for lower density forests immediately surrounding WUI homes repre-
sents a market signal that wildﬁre risk is being considered for these
communities, which is notable given that 42% of sampled WUI house
sales were purchased by out-of-region and potential second-home
buyers. New arrivals to high risk WUI regions has been a commonly in-
vestigated theme, being offered as contributing factor to incomplete and
underestimated ﬁre risk information (Paveglio et al., 2015). In separate
correlation tests, we found no signiﬁcant association between in-region
and out-of-region WUI homebuyers and forest density levels; nor was
there an association between new migrants and WUI house sales price.
At the broader context however, we see that WUI homebuyers pre-
fer to be close to higher forest density and higher wildﬁre risk areas. De-
mand for higher forest density can be explained by personal preferences
for living in more remote areas with classic natural amenities such as
public forests and “dangerous topography” (Champ et al., 2009). Our re-
sults implied homeowners only value low density in their immediate vi-
cinity, which may be due to partial evaluation of their risk. Real estate
and insurance industries are now urged to recognize property losses
due to wildﬁres caused by windblown embers and pay attention to
risk in larger landscapes (CoreLogic, 2015). With rapidly increasing
ﬁre risk in these areas, and rapid expansion of WUI house development,
we believe that two forms of market failure are likely inﬂuencing forest
densities net amenity status at the broader level.
Missing and incomplete information concerning the level of wildﬁre
risk is the ﬁrst form of market failure. Many WUI homebuyers are sim-
ply not fully aware of the accompanying wildﬁre risk and are willing to
pay for more information (Mozumder et al., 2009). Donovan et al.'s
(2007) ﬁndings of changed house prices based on a parcel-level wildﬁre
risk rating conducted by the municipality suggests that information and
awareness campaigns can be effective in changing the homebuyer's ﬁ-
nancial accounting of wildﬁre risk. As wildﬁre risk awareness increases,
market failures due to incomplete information should decrease.
The second form of market failure stems from federal and municipal
subsidies in the form of ﬁre suppression and response, along with insur-
ance premiums that do not fully reﬂect the natural disaster risk.4 These
market failures provide incentives for WUI expansion and have shifted
the burden of ﬁre management in the WUI to the public. WUI residents,
on the other hand, are receiving partial free-rider effects because they
are not fully responsible for their decisions to locate in ﬁre-prone for-
ests. The results of our empirical analysis are in line with the ﬁndings
from a game theoretic model by Busby and Albers (2010). They con-
cluded that public liability to protect private values in mixed ownership
areas like the WUI essentially encourages private landowners to do too
little fuel treatments. Similar to how suppressing ﬁre today increases
ﬁre suppression need in the future, assistance and replacement values
from both federal policies and insurance during and after wildﬁres cre-
ates greater WUI expansion and protection needs in the future and thus,
ever increasing taxpayer-funded ﬁre management.
5. Conclusions and policy recommendations
Evidence that variation in forest density inﬂuences house sales
prices in the most at-risk western WUI areas is critical and novel infor-
mation that should be incorporated in the larger calculus of developing
broader wildﬁre management policies. Our ﬁndings suggest the need to
reconsider broad approaches in awareness campaigns (e.g., Firewise
communities), community wildﬁre protection plans (CWPP), regional
development polices, and preventive versus reactionary ﬁre manage-
ment strategies. For example, fuel reduction treatments are a primary
policy mechanism for decreasing wildﬁre threats and our results indi-
cate that parcel-level defensible space creation and immediately adja-
cent fuel reduction efforts may increase WUI home values. However,
preference for higher density forests implies that if left to homeowners,
fuel treatments in adjacent public spaces may be underinvested and
may be opposed by a portion of WUI homeowners. Larger or more ag-
gressive publicly funded fuel treatments may have a reducing effect
on WUI house values in the short run and may exacerbate existing mar-
ket failures by providing further subsidies and incentives to WUI
homebuyers.
The preference for high forest density in WUI areas at the larger scale
(500 m radius-level) may be the result of incomplete information that
does not accurately reﬂect the wildﬁre hazard. Recommendations for
reducing these market failures and shifting the burden of wildﬁre risk
to the WUI homebuyer include greater accounting of societal costs
and beneﬁts of wildﬁre management, greater education and outreach
efforts concerning wildﬁre risk and mitigation, and greater coordination
among federal, state, county, and local governments when considering
their development policies within high ﬁre risk areas. Often, local policy
can inﬂuence the direction of WUI development.
We recommend further research on who pays for wildﬁre manage-
ment and who beneﬁts from it. Research should include close examina-
tions of economic incentives and disincentives created by wildﬁre
insurance, local wildﬁre management and education, and federal wild-
ﬁre management policies. For forest density in the American West,
greater sampling of additional communities and homes would provide
for more robust estimation. Increased collection of parcel characteristics
that comprise ﬁre risk and avoidance such as building/roof materials
and slope may identify important variables. Further research on sepa-
rating the implicit values of view and amenity effects related to forest
density from ﬁre risk perception is also needed. For example, stated
preference techniques could be used to survey the same sample used
in our revealed preference study and comparisons could be made be-
tween revealed and stated forest density preferences, along with
being able to directly interpret reasons and drivers for density
preferences.
Likewise, there is a need to understand WUI homebuyer behavior
and preference in the very rural and forested communities. We restrict-
ed our sample of WUI cities to natural amenity towns greater than
20,000 people so as to boost our sample size. As such, our ﬁndings
should not be generalized to the small communities and isolated houses
far from any communities. Additional research is needed on these ﬁre-
prone property owners, as they likely represent a large share of the
wildland ﬁre management responsibility and may behave differently.
For example, people living in very dense forests in at-risk hinterlands
may prefer low density openings due to their scarcity in their region.
They may also have very different budgets and different housing charac-
teristic preferences from those in our study, along with different local
development and ﬁre policies.
