Abstract: We measured soil heating and subsequent changes in soil properties between two forest
residue disposal methods: slash pile burning (SPB) and air curtain burner (ACB). The ACB consumes
fuels more efﬁciently and safely via blowing air into a burning container. Five burning trials with
different fuel sizes were implemented in northern California, USA. Soil temperature was measured
at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 cm depth. Immediately after burning, soil samples from two depths (0–10 and
10–20 cm) and ash samples were collected for analyzing organic matter; carbon and nitrogen content;
and calcium, magnesium, and potassium concentrations. The highest temperature observed was
389 ◦C at 1 cm depth under the SPB. Mean peak temperatures were 133.2 ◦C and 162.2 ◦C for ACB
and SPB, respectively. However, there were no signiﬁcant differences in peak temperatures and
duration of lethal soil temperatures (total minutes over 60 ◦C) between ACB and SPB. Heat transfer
decreased rapidly as the soil depth increased. There is little evidence that any subsequent changes in
soil chemical properties occurred, concluding that these small-scale burns had few negative impacts
at our study site. Therefore, given the lack of extreme soil heating and more efﬁcient and safer woody
residue reduction, the ACB may be more effective than open SPB, especially where ﬁre escape or
long-term ﬁre damage to soils are of concern.

1. Introduction
Fire suppression and drought have led to a signiﬁcant amount of land that must be treated to
reduce wildﬁre risk [1], particularly in California, USA. There are many ecological beneﬁts of forest
residue disposal through burning [2,3], but selecting the most appropriate method is important for
sustainable forest management [4]. Currently, piling residues is the preferred method for disposal
of woody residues among land managers. As an effective fuel reduction tool, slash pile burning
(SPB) has been widely used in western USA forests as one method to reduce ﬁre risk and extreme ﬁre
behavior [3,5]. Large amounts of woody residues can be generated by thinning or removing dead trees
and residue disposal can be a nuisance for land managers [6]. Pile burning has been preferred since it
is relatively inexpensive and can usually be conducted in a controlled manner [7]. It also allows land
managers to burn fuels safely under various weather conditions if correctly implemented [8]. Thus,
SPB has often been selected as the most economically feasible option for disposing forest residues,
especially at the wildland—urban interface or areas without local bioenergy facilities [3].

However, SPB also has limitations and challenges: piling and burning has been shown to alter
soil chemical and physical properties such as clay mineralogy [9], loss of organic matter [10], and
changes in base cation concentration [9,11]. In addition, building piles can cause considerable soil
disturbances such as compaction, displacement, or rutting depending on the time of year when piles
are created [12,13]. Unburned piles can be an ideal breeding area for pine engraver (Ips pini), thereby
potentially increasing insect attack of surrounding live trees [4,14]. Although pile burning can be
conducted under a wide range of weather conditions, low-ﬁre risk days (e.g., days with low wind
speed, cool temperature, and high humidity) are commonly recommended [7]. One of the most
signiﬁcant drawbacks of SPB is that it emits considerable smoke containing various air pollutants such
as particular matter, CO, NOx, and volatile organic compounds [5]. As a result, burning could be
restricted in areas near the public where emissions could negatively impact air quality [15].
An alternative method to dispose forest residues after harvesting is the air curtain burner (ACB),
also known as air curtain destructor/incinerator (Figure 1a). ACBs are metal boxes (size: 5–53 m3) with
a high velocity air curtain blown across the top of the residue (see [16] for a description of the ACB).
It minimizes many of the limitations of SPB. For example, it has higher combustion efﬁciency, thereby
burning residues faster (Table 1). Compared to pile burning, it produces fewer air emissions [17].
Moreover, it can reduce the risk of spreading ﬁre, insect breeding in unburned piles, and burning can
occur under a wider range of weather condition [16]. Thus, the ACB could provide an environmentally
acceptable or technically feasible (i.e., safe) method of woody residue management, but the impacts on
soil chemical properties under it are largely unknown.

Due to its higher burning efﬁciency, there could be a greater amount of heat released from the
ACB as compared to SPB, leading to adverse impacts on soil properties. Heat produced in the ACB box
can be transferred into the underlying forest ﬂoor and mineral soil by heat transfer processes such as
radiation, convection, conduction, vaporization, and condensation [18], thereby changing soil physical,
chemical, and biological properties. However, the spatial scale of impact may be less with an ACB than
SPB because one location is used for several burns rather than numerous slash piles within one site.
In general, during woody residue burning temperatures that reach ca. 60–80 ◦C kill seeds, roots,
and other plant tissue, even when the burn is for a short duration [19–21]. Soil temperatures reaching
100 ◦C can be lethal to the soil microbes [22] and temperatures ranging 200–500 ◦C cause reductions of
soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), aggregate stability, and thermal conductivity [20]. While numerous
studies have documented soil temperature ﬂux during slash pile burning (e.g., [23,24]), we could ﬁnd
no information on soil heating while using ACB. We hypothesize that temperatures could be much
higher since larger volumes of wood can be burned at once and the high turbulence associated with
air movement across the burning wood can increase the chamber temperature to ≥980 ◦C. However,
although the impacts of burning on belowground processes are highly variable [25], lack of in situ
heat transfer measurements hinders the evaluation of heating damage from ACB and, perhaps, an
increased use in areas with excess woody residues.
Wood ash is a byproduct of woody residue management created during burns. There has been
some interest in using wood ash as a soil amendment [26]. Indeed, wood ash can return nutrients such
as phosphorus (P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) to the soil [27] and salts in wood
ash can act as a fertilizer when dissolved in the soil solution [26]. However, in large quantities, wood
ash can signiﬁcantly increase soil pH [28] resulting in changes in fungal populations and subsequent
impacts on decomposition [29–31]. However, ash nutrient contents can be variable, depending on
the burn temperature, since nutrient volatilization occurs at different temperatures [32]. Thus, we
expect changes in soil nutrients, organic matter (OM), or C under an ACB might be different from
those under SPB and an investigation of wood ash properties is necessary to evaluate using wood ash
as a soil amendment.
Therefore, the objectives of this study were to investigate: (1) heat pulse into the mineral soil from
an ACB and SPB; and (2) their effects on underlying soil properties. This study focused on disposal of
forest residues resulting from thinning treatments around residential areas and city parks. For this, we
tested the following hypotheses:
1.
The ACB will produce a greater heat pulse and subsequently higher soil temperature proﬁle
within the mineral soil proﬁle than SPB.
2.
A greater heat pulse associated with ACB will cause larger changes in soil chemical properties as
compared to SPB.
3.
If the heat pulse between ACB and SPB is signiﬁcant, then properties of wood ash generated by
ACB would differ from those of SPB.
2. Methods
2.1. Study Sites and Burning Description
The ﬁrst burning trial was conducted in the Pine Mountain Lake Association Compost Area
(hereafter “Groveland”) located approximately 5 km north of Groveland, California (37◦51′52” N,
120◦12′33” W). At Groveland, two kinds of fuel types were tested per burning method: small (<10.2 cm
in diameter) and mixed sizes (including both large (≥10.2 cm in diameter) and small fuel) on 26 and
27 March 2017, respectively (Table 1). Fuel was from nearby landscaping and fuel treatment wastes
and consisted of a mix of conifer species. On average, 1.93 and 1.18 ton (green) of fuels were consumed
in small and mixed size burning trials, respectively. One gallon of diesel was used as a ﬁre starter
in each batch run in the ACB and SPB. Mixed size slash piles were constructed with an excavator
and were 1.2 m in diameter and height. Slash piles from the small fuels were constructed by hand to

a size similar to the excavator piles. Fuel remaining after initial SPB piling and ACB loading were
manually added to the piles or ACB continuously as fuel was consumed. Both SPB and ACB were
tested simultaneously. The average burning time of small-size fuel burning was 5.34 h, whereas 3.92 h
for mixed-size fuel burning. Maximum temperatures of ﬂame (measured by the ThermaCAM® SC640
IR camera (FLIR Systems, North Billerica, MA, USA) in 10-min intervals) of each burning method
were 1005 ◦C (ACB) and 897 ◦C (SPB) for small fuel, whereas 984 ◦C (ACB) and 953 ◦C (SPB) were
for mixed size fuel. On the days we burned, air temperature was 23.8 ◦C (small fuel), 20.1 ◦C (mixed
fuel), and relative humidity was 38.1% (small fuel) and 59.2% (mixed fuel). Soil series at Groveland
was a Trabuco and is classiﬁed as ﬁne, mixed, superactive thermic Mollic Haploxeralf and has a loamy
texture [33].
A second study site was near the Indian Grinding Rock State Historic Park campground
(38◦25′17” N, 120◦38′39” W) and was located 3.2 km south of Volcano, California (hereafter “Volcano”).
Three kinds of fuel types were tested during 13–15 June 2016: (1) cured mixed size fuel (mixture of
small (<10.2 cm in diameter) and large size (≥10.2 cm in diameter) fuel); (2) (fresh) small fuel (<10.2 cm
in diameter); and (3) fresh mixed size fuel (mixture of small and large size fuel). Residues for this study
came from nearby ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Lawson & C. Lawson) stands in the Park. Cured
fuels were one-year-old air-dried residues created in a fuel reduction thinning. Fresh residues were
drought/insect damaged or recently killed standing trees. Overall, an average of 0.66 (green) ton of
fuel was burned during 2.97 h per burning trial. Measured maximum temperatures of ﬂame for mixed
size cured fuel trial were 1026 ◦C (ACB) and 1081 ◦C (SPB). For small size fresh fuel trail, 1080 ◦C (ACB)
and 1010 ◦C (SPB) were the maximum ﬂame temperature. The maximum ﬂame temperature for mixed
size fresh fuel trial were 1055 ◦C (ACB) and 1010 ◦C (SPB). Air temperatures were 30.2 ◦C, 24.4 ◦C,
and 19.4 ◦C, and relative humidity was 35.8%, 28.7%, and 37.8% for mixed size cured, small size fresh,
and mixed size fresh fuel burning trials, respectively. Soil series at Volcano was a Mariposa soil series:
ﬁne-loamy, mixed semiactive, mesic Typic Haploxerult and has a gravelly silt loam texture [33].
The BurnBoss® air curtain burner (Air Burners, Inc., Palm City, FL, USA) was used. The BurnBoss®
is trailer-mounted, containing the FireBox® (combustion chamber) with 10.1 cm thick steel walls ﬁlled
with thermo-ceramic materials. The bottom of FireBox® is open to the ground (i.e., bottomless), and
has 3.7 m × 1.2 m × 1.2 m dimensions (L × W × H). At Volcano, we used the BurnBoss® with the
ember case attached because of a high ﬁre risk for escaping. Burning trials were conducted for a
maximum 5.55 h (Groveland day 1), but we left the ﬁre burning until the next morning to ensure
complete combustion of all materials. After completion of each burning trial (both ACB and SPB), the
next burning trials were conducted in different locations.
2.2. Soil and Ash Sampling
Three sampling points were assigned for each burning method. Under the ACB, we sampled in
the center, and along the long- and short-edges. Under the SPB, we sampled at the center, along the
edge, and halfway between the center and edge of the pile (hereafter, “midpoint”). Before and one day
after each burning trial, soil samples were taken at two depths (0–10 cm and 10–20 cm) at each sample
point location using a slide hammer and soil core (185 cm3 volume) for soil property analyses. After
burning, ash samples were taken from the same locations as the soil samples. Samples were sealed
in the zip-type plastic bags, kept cool until shipping, and sent to Rocky Mountain Research Station
(RMRS; Moscow, ID, USA) for processing and lab analyses.
2.3. Soil Heat Transfer Measurement
Before the SPB and ACB were ignited, we installed thermocouple units in each soil core sampling
point. Each thermocouple unit contained six horizontally-exposed thermocouples at six soil depths
(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 cm). Type K thermocouples connected to TC101A temperature data logger
(MedgeTech, Warner, NH, USA) were used. Soil temperature was recorded at 5-s intervals for
Groveland, but, to save memory and battery capacity, 15-s recording intervals were used at Volcano.

The burning trials lasted until combustion was complete, but we only collected temperature proﬁles
for the ﬁrst 240 min because of the limited data storage of the logger. Recorded data were aggregated
into 1-min averages, and erratic measurements from data logger malfunctions were removed from
further analyses.
2.4. Lab and Data Analyses
At each sampling depth, soil was analyzed for OM, C and N contents, and exchangeable cation
(Ca, Mg, and K) concentrations. Before analyzing, soil samples were dried at 80 ◦C and all live roots
and rocks were removed during sieving through 2 mm sieve. Soil samples were subsequently split,
homogenized, and ground. Total C and N were analyzed with LECO-600 analyzer (LECO Corp,
St. Joseph, Michigan, USA). Calcium, Mg, and K were extracted using pH neutral ammonium acetate,
and measured with an atomic absorption spectrometer (Model PinAAcle 500, Perkin Elmer, Shelton,
CT, USA). Total OM was measured by weight loss-on-ignition method [34] after 8-h after combustion
at 375 ◦C. In addition, C and N concentration of the wood ash samples were measured similarly to
soil samples.
Analysis of variance was conducted to detect the differences in response variables by burn
method (ACB vs. SPB) and depth. For soil temperature data, peak temperature and lethal temperature
duration were tested as the response variables. Lethal temperature duration was calculated through
the summation of minutes over 60 ◦C [22,24] during the 240 min of burning. Peak temperature was
log-transformed to satisfy the assumptions of model’s error structure. In addition to burn method and
depth, soil moisture content, fuel moisture content, and fuel type (i.e., small-fresh, mixed-fresh, and
mixed-cured) were tested as the covariates. For soil properties, changes (∆; pre-burning−post-burning)
in OM, C, and N contents, and Ca, Mg, and K concentrations after burning were used as the response
variables. Total burning time was added in the soil-property-test models. For ash properties, C and N
contents, and Ca, Mg, and K concentration were tested. Burn method, fuel moisture, fuel type, and
total burning time were included in the ash-test models. All analyses were conducted using the R
statistical package [35].
3. Results
3.1. Soil Heat Transfer
At Volcano, the peak temperature (389 ◦C) was at 1 cm depth in the cured mixed-size fuel SPB.
Data from the 1 cm depth under the ACB were lost due to mechanical malfunction. However, it is
likely the 1 cm depth ACB temperature would be similar to the SPB with a similar fuel since the peak
temperature at 2 cm depth reached 315.6 ◦C. Highest peak temperatures were recorded at the midpoint
and long-edge locations of SPB and ACB, respectively. Both sites’ average peak temperature of all
three sample locations at 1 cm depth for ACB was 133.2 ◦C, whereas it was 162.2 ◦C for SPB (Figure 2;
overall average of ACB and SPB: 147.7 ◦C). As expected, the temperature pulse decreased with increase
of soil depth and average peak temperatures at 8 cm depth were 81.8 ◦C and 78.0 ◦C for ACB and
SPB, respectively.

The result of analysis of variance indicated that there was no signiﬁcant difference in peak
temperature between ACB and SPB (p = 0.446) (Table 2). However, signiﬁcant differences were
detected by soil depth (p < 0.001) and soil moisture content (p < 0.001). The coefﬁcient for soil depth
indicated that peak temperature decreased by 7.8% for 1 cm increase in soil depth. A 1% increase
in soil moisture content was associated with 4.9% decrease in peak temperature. Other covariates
(i.e., fuel moisture content and fuel type) were not signiﬁcantly correlated with peak temperature.

Lethal temperature duration exhibited similar results with peak temperature (Figure 3).
As expected, the maximum lethal temperature duration was observed at the 1 cm depth and occurred
at the SPB midpoint location (range: 200–235 min out of 240 min) and it was consistent to the results of
peak temperature. The average lethal temperature duration of all locations under the SPB occurred
at 1 cm depth and lasted for 191 min. At 8 cm depth, lethal temperature lasted for only 89 min.
Approximately 25% of all temperature measurements across both burning methods had no lethal
temperatures at 8 cm depth.

Figure 3. Mean lethal temperature duration by soil depth. Error bars represent one standard deviation.
The analysis of variance of lethal temperature yielded a similar result as peak temperature
(Table 2). Burning method (SPB vs. ACB) did not affect the duration of lethal temperature (p = 0.180).
As soil depth increased, lethal temperature duration was signiﬁcantly shorter (p < 0.001): for each 1 cm
depth increment increase, the lethal temperature duration was reduced by approximately 15.3 min.
Similar to the result of peak temperature, only soil moisture content was signiﬁcantly associated with
the lethal temperature duration among the tested covariates (p < 0.001). The estimated coefﬁcient
indicated that 1% increases in soil moisture content was related with 7.3 min decrease in the lethal
temperature duration.
3.2. Change in Soil Properties
In general, Volcano had lower nutrient contents than Groveland (Table 3). In particular, N contents
at Volcano was quite low: only 3.3% the level of Groveland. Groveland had 64% and 43% higher OM
and C contents than Volcano. Cation concentrations were consistent: Groveland’s soil contained 114%,
363%, and 488% more Ca, Mg, and K as compared to Volcano’s soil.
Across all soil properties, burning method appeared not to result in any notable changes except
K concentration (Table 4). The average of OM contents did not change at the level of 81 Mg ha−1 by
burnings, and reductions of OM contents were found only at 0–10 cm depth of SPB in Groveland and
ACB in Volcano. However, we could not ﬁnd any statistical evidence for the effects of burning method
on the changes in OM contents (p = 0.485). In addition, none of the other covariates were associated
with the changes in OM contents after burning trials. The tests for changes in C and N contents yielded
the same results with OM.

Overall average pre-burning Ca, Mg, and K concentrations were 3404.0 mg kg−1 (SE = 45.7),
176.7 mg kg−1 (SE = 11.5), and 346.2 mg kg−1 (SE = 17.5), respectively (Table 2). After burning, they
were 3391.4 mg kg−1 (SE = 43.7), 181.0 mg kg−1 (SE = 12.2), and 408.7 mg kg−1 (SE = 20.9), respectively.
Among the measured cations, only K was affected by the burning method (p = 0.009; Table 4). The SPB
retained more K than ACB by 121.2 mg kg−1 in the soil after burning trial. Soil moisture content was
positively associated with the changes in Mg (coefﬁcient = 5.3) and K (coefﬁcient = 21.4) concentrations.
However, Ca concentration change was affected by none of the tested factors.
Average C concentration in ash generated from ACB and SPB burns were 30.3% (Groveland;
ACB), 51.5% (Volcano; ACB), 35.3% (Groveland; SPB), and 65.5% (Volcano; SPB) (Table 2). Average Ca
concentration of ash for ACB and SPB across all burning trials were 11,666 (SE = 58) and 10,614 (SE = 49)
mg kg−1, indicating a similar level between two burning methods (p = 0.292; Table 5). In addition, Mg
concentration in the ash was did not differ by burning method (ACB: 6105 (SE = 66) mg kg−1, SPB:
4159 (SE = 46) mg kg−1; p = 0.678). Contrary to the other cations in the wood ash, K concentration from
the ACB was 21,597 (SE = 123) mg kg−1, which was signiﬁcantly higher than SPB (10,911 (SE = 85) mg
kg−1; p = 0.020). Fuel moisture and fuel type were not associated with any of ash properties. Total
burning time was a signiﬁcant factor for the C and N concentration in the ash. An additional 1 h of
burning time reduced 9.5% and 0.06% of C and N concentration, respectively.

4. Discussion
As a byproduct of harvesting or thinning activities for various objectives including restoration
or stand density reduction, increasing amount of forest residues are being produced and piled in the
western United State forests [36]. One of the simple disposal methods is burning; however, its impacts
on soil health and productivity vary from temporary to long-term soil damage due to many factors such
as soil characteristics, fuel distribution, piling method, and species composition [36]. However, our
knowledge of the ecological consequences of the soil damages is still limited [37]. Since the coverage
of piled woody residues could reach up to 30% of thinning units on some sites in California [38],
a detrimental soil impact can lead to not only substantial economic costs but also ecological damages.
Thus, investigation of soil heat transfers and subsequent changes in soil properties are required to
evaluate the potential adverse impacts on soil health and productivity.

The measured soil properties in this study play the important roles in addressing soil health
and productivity. Soil OM provides various essential functions such as supporting soil C cycling,
regulating N and water availability, and supporting biodiversity [39,40]. Soil C is a major element of
OM. Soil N is generally the most important limiting nutrient of plant growth in forests [41,42]. The
cations are also the elements consisting of the body of plant, and the amount of those cations can also
indicate the degree of fertility and health of soil (i.e., cation exchange capacity) [43].
Findings of this study indicate that there was not enough evidence to support the hypothesis
that ACB generates greater heat pulse than SPB as there were no notable differences in temperature
proﬁles or soil chemical properties between two burn methods. Both ACB and SPB burns maintained
the maximum temperature that wood fuel combustion can reach approximately 1027–1100 ◦C [44,45]
when there is a continuous fuel and the optimum fuel conﬁguration for efﬁcient combustion. Therefore,
since the heat generated did not signiﬁcantly alter soil quality using these burning methods, heat
duration, including smoldering phase, may be an underlying cause of soil change. The ACB can
consume fuels more efﬁciently [46] than SPB. Furthermore, because of air quality requirements and
proximity to local communities, woody residue burning is often conducted on a small scale making
the ACB a reasonable option to manage forest woody residues in many regions.
Continuously supplying fuel to the ACB and SPB resulted in elevated soil temperatures at the
long-edge of ACB and midpoint of SPB. As operation proceeded, added fuels were more likely placed
to the long-edges of the ACB. This fuel addition method is also supported by the result that high
peak temperatures were observed by the thermocouples along the long-edge of the ACB, primarily
at Volcano. At Volcano, we also used the ACB with the ember screening cover so that the fuel was
inserted only through the slot located in the center of ACB. Therefore, the fuel supplying personnel
threw fuels preferably toward the long-edge side so the fuel in the center was not stacked and did not
block the feeding entrance. Similarly, in SPB, fuels are more likely stacked at midpoint, because the
radiated heat made it difﬁcult to approach the burning pile.
The majority of heat generated by ﬁre is transferred to upward into the atmosphere by radiation,
convection, and mass transfer along with smoke, gases, and particular matters [47]. Thus, only limited
heat (approximately 10–15%) is estimated to be transferred into the soil by radiation [18]. In addition,
since soil is not a good heat conductor [20], elevated soil temperatures near surface diminished rapidly
with increasing soil depth [18]. Hartford and Frandsen [48] suggested that the soil temperature
rarely exceeds 80 ◦C at 4 cm depth, while surface layer temperature reach 300–500 ◦C. This study
demonstrated a consistent outcome with those assertions: a moderate heat transfer to deeper soil
layer while maintaining the maximum temperatures for wood combustion aboveground (Figure 3).
However, heat transfer can vary with multiple factors such as fuel characteristics, weather conditions,
ﬁre behavior, and soil properties [22,47]. Thus, more experimental replicates with a wider range of
environmental conditions are essential to understand the rate of temperature reduction with soil depth.
Fire duration can also play an important role; long-duration ﬁres caused by smoldering or
heavily-loaded SPB can transfer substantial heat to belowground. Busse et al. [24] mimicked broadcast
burning after mastication and reported the maximum soil surface temperatures reached 500–600 ◦C
(dry soil) and 400–500 ◦C (wet soil), and observed peak temperatures at 10 cm ranged 40–105 ◦C.
Neary et al. [22] also observed severe soil heating; 700 ◦C at surface over 250 ◦C at 10 cm depth, and
greater than 100 ◦C at 22 cm depth. In the extreme, soil heating has been observed 1.36 m deep under
heavy slash pile [23]. Thus, to minimize possible adverse impact of soil heating, the duration of
aboveground combustion, including smoldering phase, should be minimized.
Fire acts to reduce the chemical elements and physical condition of the wood [49]. Heat reduces
the amount of nutrients and OM through volatilization and combustion. There have been abundant
reports concerning how intensive ﬁres, such as SPB, reduces OM contents (e.g., [44,50–53]). Even
at low temperatures (<100 ◦C), losses of soil OM may occur [22,47,49]. As temperature increased,
sensitive functional groups such as phenolic OH groups and COOH groups were eliminated [54]. Thus,
high heat pulse can consume OM in the soil layer, resulting in the decrease of soil OM [6]. However,

Forests 2017, 8, 297
11 of 15
increased soil OM in mineral soil layer has also been observed, mainly due to the redistribution of OM
from forest ﬂoor or slash [55,56]. In addition, soil texture and soil moisture content can affect the soil
chemical properties after burning [36].
In general, soil N decreases after burning.
Fire scars in Arizona that were created by
heavily-loaded SPB, had a signiﬁcant reduction in total N [6]. Therefore, if a burning operation
is conducted on soil where long-term degradation is a concern, then forest managers might have to
pay attention to how slash is burned so that N losses are minimized. However, ﬁre can transform
many chemical elements, including N, to more available forms for plants or organisms [49]. Fire
causes an immediate increase in ammonium ions (NH4+), a readily available form of N through
mineralization [57,58]. In addition, favorable microenvironments (e.g., elevated nutrient, improved
soil microclimate, and increased pH) increase N-ﬁxation [40]. Wan et al. [59] support the argument
that there is a signiﬁcant decrease of fuel N and an increase in NH4 and NO3. However, the post-ﬁre
pulse of available N quickly returns to pre-burning levels, or lower, with immobilization as C:N ratio
increases or through leaching if OM is lost [56]. Soil N responses to ﬁre emphasize the importance of
encouraging native vegetation recovery immediately after SPB.
Extractable cations such as Ca, Mg, and K have been known to increase after burning due the
oxidation of surface OM (e.g., [51,60]). However, results from this study failed to ﬁnd supporting
evidence for increases in those cation concentrations. Because all of burning trails were conducted on
the bare grounds with exposed mineral soil surface, thus there likely was not enough surface OM to
induce any signiﬁcant changes in these nutrients. In addition, the lack of signiﬁcant differences may
have been due to high variability of cations or an insufﬁcient number of samples.
Wood ash applications have been considered as a potential soil amendment for both forest and
agricultural sites [26,61]. Not only can wood ash neutralize soil acidity [62], it can also provide
nutrients, including C, N, Mg, Ca, K, and P, to the mineral soil [63]. However, the degree and extent of
the nutrient changes are related to burn temperature. For example, the C and K concentration in ash
decreases as burn temperature increases [63,64]. Thus, the outcome for ash chemical concentrations
in our study may be partially supported by the fact that soil heating under ACB and SPB were not
signiﬁcantly different. Difference in soil C and N concentrations at our two locations indicated that they
were likely affected by the interaction of other factors such as fuel type (i.e., tree species), fuel moisture
condition, and weather condition. Although there is little empirical evidence in the literature [26]
that C and N contents in ash increased site productivity, there is evidence that it can act as a fertilizer
source or to increase soil pH in acidic soils [65]. Moreover, the abundant cation concentration in wood
ash can play a critical role in compensating for the loss of mineral nutrients by burning, if needed.
Thus, we recommend using wood ash created in ACB as a soil amendment, especially on the sites with
substantial nutrient deﬁciencies.
5. Conclusions and Management Implications
In this study, we compared differences in heat transfer and subsequent changes in soil
properties between ACB and SPB. Our experimental trials displayed the results that there were
no signiﬁcant impacts of different burning methods on peak temperature and lethal temperature
duration. Accordingly, we could not ﬁnd any substantial changes in soil chemical properties except
K concentration. This effect on K concentration was also observed in the analysis of ash properties.
However, other wood ash properties were not affected by the burning methods. There was not enough
evidence for the different effects on soil heat transfer and soil properties between the two different
burning methods. Rather, the results indicate that the soil moisture content is a key factor for heat
transfer and soil property changes.
North American, especially western USA, forest managers are now facing challenges of managing
increased woody residues generated from harvesting such as fuel reduction treatments, salvage
logging from wildﬁre and insect outbreak, or other diverse restoration efforts. Utilization of woody
biomass for bioenergy or other by-products still has many constraints. Thus, it is expected that burning

Forests 2017, 8, 297

disposal methods will be commonly adopted in many forests to reduce potential environmental
hazards. However, each burning method has its own disadvantages and they may also cause other
environmental or safety issues. Therefore, forest managers should determine the advantages and
limitations of each burning method when deciding on which method to use based on site and wood
biomass volume. This study investigated the heat ﬂux into the soil from ACB and SPB and subsequent
changes in soil properties. Our results suggest that:
1.
Since both ACB and SPB produce high burn temperatures close to the maximum for wood
combustion, it is important to shorten the burn duration to prevent potential adverse ecological
consequences associated with excessive heat. In terms of burning duration for a given amount of
fuel, ACB is preferred to SPB because ACB has higher productivity than SPB.
2.
Wet and/or high OM content soils can provide some ameliorative qualities for reducing negative
impacts of heat as compared to dry or low OM content soils. Thus, burning after rain over the
ground with duff layer is recommended.
3.
If we extend our results to other sites, cold or arid regions may need to do post-burning
amendments to provide for immediate vegetation recovery.
4.
Using wood ash as a fertilizer can ameliorate some potential negative impacts of burning on the
mineral soil.
This study determined there were no signiﬁcant differences between ACB and SPB on two
forest–urban interface sites in northern CA, USA, but may be limited in scope since the replicates
of experiment were lacking due to high monetary and time costs, and limitations by logistics and
regulation. In addition, our trials were conducted on bare mineral soil where the surface was highly
disturbed and compacted. Thus, our result may not be consistent with other trials conducted on less
disturbed forest soil where an intact forest ﬂoor is present. Further studies with additional replicates
that encompass a wider range of soil and fuel conditions are required.
