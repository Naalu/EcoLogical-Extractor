Interest in use of naturally ignited wildland fires managed to meet multiple resource objectives (resource 
objective wildfire) is increasing among U.S. public forest managers; however, only a limited number of studies 
have examined this approach for conserving or restoring understory plant diversity, productivity, and commu­
nity structure. We analyzed understory community changes two and twelve years after resource objective fire, 
using permanent sample plots in three montane contrasting forest types in Grand Canyon National Park, AZ. Our 
findings indicated that species composition in the pine-oak forest rebounded to be similar to that observed before 
the fire, but plant cover did not recover to pre-fire levels by the twelfth year post-fire. Plant cover showed mixed 
results post-fire in mixed-conifer and spruce-fir forests, and species composition was still characterized by ruderal 
species twelve years later. Patterns observed in this study likely reflect interacting factors of burn severity, pe­
riodic drought, large ungulate herbivory, and inherent site variability. Other than cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), 
we found no non-native species occurring with high frequency. Continued monitoring with increased frequency 
and intensity could lead to better understanding of long-term changes in these forests after resource objective 
fire, and enhance our understanding of important drivers of variation including interactions of climate, burn 
severity and herbivory by large ungulates.   
1. Introduction 
Managing naturally ignited wildland fires for multiple objectives 
(hereafter, “resource objective fire”) may serve as a low-cost alternative 
for mechanical treatments for restoring structure and function on fire- 
excluded landscapes (North et al., 2015; Huffman et al., 2020). In the 
southwestern US, departures from natural disturbance patterns through 
fire exclusion and land-use changes over the past century, have led to 
tree densification and associated homogenization in plant community 
composition and species diversity (Covington & Moore, 1994; Keane 
et al., 2002; Hessburg et al., 2019; Wilkin et al., 2021). Furthermore, 
some studies suggest that various changes occurring in forested eco­
systems might be exacerbated as warmer and water-stressed microcli­
mates become more prevalent across the landscape (Brusca et al., 2013; 
Stevens et al., 2015). Resource objective wildfire can provide an array of 
ecological benefits including restoring and maintaining ecological 
function and structure and increasing species diversity and soil moisture 
(Stoddard et al., 2020; Stephens et al., 2021). A body of literature has 
been compiled on the effects of resource objective wildfires on forest 
structure and fire behavior, but our knowledge of the impacts to the 
understory plant community is lacking (Huffman et al., 2020). 
Understory plants in forest understories play important roles, 
including increasing soil stability, nutrient cycling, and providing 
human cultural uses and wildlife habitat. Diverse plant communities can 
contribute to ecological resilience to disturbance through non-native 
invasion resistance (Gundale et al., 2008; McGlone et al., 2011). Un­
derstory plants also influence community structure and composition 
through competitive and/or facilitative effects (Stachowicz, 2001). 
Better understanding of understory plant community responses to 
resource objective wildfire, particularly in terms of diversity, abun­
dance, and composition, is useful for ecological restoration and con­
servation planning.

Ponderosa pine-Gambel oak (Pinus ponderosa-Quercus gambelii), dry 
mixed-conifer, and spruce-fir forests, interspersed with open park-like 
meadows, occupy much of the Kaibab Plateau and the North Rim of 
Grand Canyon National Park in northern Arizona (McHenry, 1933; 
Merkle, 1954; Merkle, 1962; Moir & Ludwig, 1979; White & Vankat, 
1993; Moore & Huffman, 2004; Vankat, 2011; Kearsley et al., 2015; 
Matonis & Binkley, 2018). Increases in tree density occurred in the 
greater southwesern region in ponderosa pine and dry mixed-conifer 
forests primarily due to selective logging, intensive livestock grazing, 
and disruption of natural surface fire regimes around 1879 (Ful´e et al., 
2002, 2003b). Prior to fire exclusion and Euro-American settlement, 
fire-prone forests of this region exhibited lower tree density than 
observed contemporarily (Ful´e et al., 2002). Dry mixed-conifer forests 
have shown an influx of shade-tolerant coniferous species including 
Pseudotsuga menziesii and Abies concolor. Intensive, unregulated livestock 
grazing and active fire suppression, as well as selective harvesting and 
climate variations, led to uncharacteristic increases in tree establish­
ment (Savage et al., 1996; Ful´e et al., 2003a; Brown & Wu, 2005). Un­
derstory communities on the Kaibab Plateau were also altered by 
intensive browsing by wild ungulates, believed to be due mainly to early 
20th century predator control (Rasmussen, 1941; Leopold et al., 1943; 
Merkle, 1962; Russo, 1964; White & Vankat, 1993; Mitchell & Freeman, 
1993; Binkley et al., 2006; Acton, 2014). According to Rasmussen 
(1941) and others (Russo, 1964; Acton, 2014), deer heavily browsed 
palatable species during two irruptions in the first half of the 20th 
century, although even unpalatable species were eventually consumed 
when there was little else left, possibly defining contemporary plant 
communities on the North Rim. 
Effects of tree density, forest type, fire and topographic features can 
lead to major plant community differences over relatively short dis­
tances on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, where deep incisions 
crisscross the landscape and the canyon itself can influence temperature 
and precipitation in the surrounding environment (Strahler, 1944; 
Halvorson, 1972). Pinus ponderosa forests on north-facing slopes and 
those with a component of Quercus gambelii have greater plant cover, 
while higher species richness occurs on the warmer and drier southern 
slopes (Laughlin et al., 2005). In the montane forests of the park, di­
versity is highest on southern aspects (Laughlin et al., 2005). Under 
dense canopies in unburned Pinus ponderosa and dry mixed-conifer 
forests and, to some degree, in spruce-fir forests, growth and repro­
duction of many shade intolerant understory species may be inhibited by 
heavy accumulations of needles and a lack of sunlight, moisture and 
nutrients (Laughlin et al., 2004; Abella & Springer, 2015; Higgins et al., 
2015). 
It is widely understood that plant communities change over time 
after disturbance, and diversity in some communities may be generally 
related to disturbance frequency and intensity as well as soils and site 
properties (e.g., Grime, 1979; Laughlin & Grace, 2006; Laughlin et al., 
2007). Initially, fire can increase plant diversity in high-elevation 
southwestern forests, with the frequency, richness and diversity of 
introduced species often increasing with fire intensity (Crawford et al., 
2001; Griffis et al., 2001; Fornwalt et al., 2010; Abella & Springer, 
2015). Other studies have reported a negative relationship between time 
since fire and plant cover and richness. This relationship, particularly for 
annual forbs, has been reported for forests on the North Rim (Laughlin 
et al., 2005). 
The southwestern US has been experiencing long-term drought since 
approximately 1995, with trends of decreasing precipitation and 
increasing temperature over roughly the last three decades (Arizona 
State Climate Office, 2021; https://azclimate.asu.edu/drought/, 
accessed 12/10/21). The interaction between fire effects and increas­
ingly xeric conditions is likely to have substantial impacts on ecosystem 
sustainability and biodiversity, potentially leading to rapid composi­
tional shifts toward dominance of species better adapted to warmer and 
drier conditions (Stevens et al., 2015; Stevens et al., 2019; Feeley et al., 
2020; Miller & Safford, 2020). For example, this process of 
“thermophilization,” when communities change to show increasing 
abundance of species from lower latitudes or elevations, has been re­
ported to be related to disturbance severity in forests of Colorado and 
California (Stevens et al. 2015; Stevens et al., 2019). Similar to other 
North American forest ecosystems, mixed-conifer and spruce-fir forests 
and the understory plant species that are endemic to them are of con­
servation concern in the Southwest. As fires become larger and more 
frequent with a warming climate, temperatures increase, and precipi­
tation decreases, associated increasing tree mortality and more open, 
warmer, and drier conditions may lead to shifts in species composition 
and novel ecological states (Springer et al., 2018; Falk et al., 2022). 
Prescribed fire and resource objective wildfire can be acceptable 
restoration treatment approaches for national parks and other public 
lands in the US where mechanical thinning is off-limits or undesirable. 
Fire can be used effectively to reduce hazardous fuel loads and thin 
small-diameter and fire-intolerant trees (Ful´e & Laughlin, 2007; 
Laughlin et al., 2011; Huffman et al., 2017; Stoddard et al., 2020; 
Huffman et al., 2020). Often, reducing potential fire behavior receives 
highest priority in western forest restoration goals, and less is known 
concerning long-term effects of managed fires on understory plant 
communities (Huffman et al. 2020). Studies of changes in plant com­
munities over time following prescribed fire and wildfire in warm, dry 
forests have shown that, in the absence of additional disturbance, 
ruderal species tend to decline in abundance and cover over time, while 
perennial forbs, shrubs and grasses tend to increase (Griffis et al., 2001; 
Laughlin & Ful´e 2008; Abella & Springer, 2015). However, these pat­
terns may not be seen in higher elevation, cooler and shadier, spruce-fir 
forests following low-severity fire, or in microsites that are moderated 
by tree canopy and protected more from temperature extremes (Chris­
tiansen et al., 2021). More open conditions associated with high-severity 
patches in all forest types, coupled with a warming climate, may lead to 
shifts toward thermophilization over time. Further, resource objective 
fires can be planned to meet different objectives, and, to limit damage to 
values on the landscape, managers may allow wildfires to burn mainly 
under mild weather conditions and higher fuel moisture levels (Huffman 
et al., 2017). This approach is intended to result in minimal fire activity 
and low burn severity. To date, little is known about how resource 
objective wildfires and associated burn severities affect plant commu­
nities and their associated species. 
Our goal for this study was to capitalize on a natural experiment and 
analyze understory plant community changes twelve years after 
resource objective wildfires burned over long-term monitoring plots in 
three contrasting forests and to evaluate the effects of the fires on species 
composition and frequency over time. Our research questions were: 1) 
How have the understory plant communities changed in species 
composition with time since fire, 2) How has species richness, diversity 
and cover changed over time in the three forest types, and, 3) Are 
communities shifting toward dominance by species adapted to warmer/ 
drier conditions (i.e., thermophilization)? We expected that ruderal 
species would decline in abundance and cover over time while perennial 
forbs, shrubs and grasses would increase, which is in line with other 
studies of community succession following fire in southwestern pon­
derosa pine and dry mixed-conifer forests. 
2. Methods 
2.1. Study sites 
Our study sites were located on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon 
in northern Arizona at the southern end of the Kaibab Plateau within 
Grand Canyon National Park (GCNP) (Fig. 1). Elevation ranges from 
approximately 2280–2800 m over the study area. The Kaibab Plateau 
consists of a complex of sedimentary rock types known as the Kaibab 
Formation (Wood, 2019). The primary soil type over much of the study 
area is described as Kanabownits-Kippers-Kaiparowits complex, on 
relatively flat plateaus. These soils are derived from parent material that

is residuum weathered from calcareous sandstone or cherty limestone 
(Lindsay et al., 2003). Steeper slopes consist of a Kaiparowits gravelly 
fine sandy loam. All soil types are well drained. 
Precipitation falls in a bimodal pattern with the majority falling as 
rain during the monsoonal period from July-September and the 
remainder in the form of snow in winter, although this pattern can be 
upset on an annual or seasonal basis by local or regional weather con­
ditions. Based on mean annual climate data at Bright Angel Weather 
Station (1925–2015), the closest weather station to our study site, pre­
cipitation averaged 51.8 cm annually (https://wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/ 
rawMAIN.pl?azACAN, accessed March 2020). The average growing 
season on the North Rim is approximately 90 days with the average date 
of the last killing frost in late May to mid-June and first frost in early to 
late September (freeze free probabilities available at https://wrcc.dri. 
edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?azbrig, accessed April 2022). Trends toward 
decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature have been occur­
ring over the last three decades (Fig. 2). 
Ponderosa pine (with a major component of Quercus gambelii), dry 
mixed-conifer (comprised primarily of Pinus ponderosa, Pseudotsuga 
menziesii, and other montane conifer species), and spruce-fir (Picea 
engelmannii and Abies lasiocarpa) were the three main forest types in our 
study. Our study sites, Powell Plateau, Swamp Ridge, and Big Springs/ 
Little Park, were located within these three major forest types, respec­
tively, and were correspondingly arrayed across an elevation gradient 
with differing fire regimes and land uses. Due to their remoteness and 
location with Grand Canyon National Park, forest overstories had never 
been harvested at any of the three sites (Ful´e et al, 2002; Yocom-Kent et 
al, 2015). Several lightning-ignited resource objective wildfires were 
allowed to burn on the North Rim in 2003, burning through permanent 
monitoring plots we installed between 1998 and 2001 to monitor 
ecosystem changes and natural disturbance patterns. Additional perti­
nent information on the study sites and fires is provided in Table 1 (Ful´e 
et al. 2002, 2003a, 2003b; Yocom-Kent et al., 2015). 
2.2. Pine-oak site burned by Powell Fire (Powell Plateau) 
Located at the edge of the rim, Powell Plateau juts into the Grand 
Canyon at a slightly lower elevation than the Kaibab Plateau and ex­
hibits more xeric conditions than at higher elevations. Soils on Powell 
Plateau are relatively shallow and rocky. In addition to Pinus ponderosa, 
Quercus gambelii and Robinia neomexicana are commonly present. Also 
occurring here are more xeric shrubs such as Cercocarpus spp., Artemisia 
tridentata and Purshia stansburiana. The contemporary understory plant 
community is dominated by a mix of diverse forb species, most 
commonly represented by species in the Asteraceae family, as well as the 
invasive non-native Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) in some areas. 
Our study area at the northern portion of the plateau had burned at 
least three times since 1879, and the 2003 fire was mostly an unburned 
and low-severity surface fire, with a small amount of moderate and high- 
severity fire. Fire history and stand reconstructions indicate that fire 
behavior and forest structure are presently similar to the natural range 
of variability (NRV) (Ful´e & Laughlin, 2007) (Fig. 1). 
2.3. Warm-dry mixed-conifer forest burned in the Rose fire (Swamp 
Ridge) 
Warm-dry mixed-conifer forests found at the Swamp Ridge site 
generally consisted of Pseudotsuga menziesii, historically co-occurring 
with Pinus ponderosa, Abies concolor, Picea pungens, Populus tremuloides, 
and occasionally Robinia neomexicana, the latter two species particularly 
following fire (Pearson, 1931). Pseudotsuga menziesii and Populus trem­
uloides are fairly common on our overall study site, extending into the 
spruce-fir forest at higher elevations of the Kaibab Plateau. This forest 
type has experienced an increase in density of Abies concolor on more 
productive soils and in the absence of fire (Merkle, 1962). Shade- 
tolerant and fire-intolerant species include Abies concolor and 
A. lasiocarpa, while shade intolerant species include Pinus ponderosa and 
Populus tremuloides. Scattered shrubs in this forest type include Rosa

woodsii and Mahonia repens. Most grasses are found in open habitats and 
decrease with increasing canopy cover, but some, along with several 
species of Carex, can persist in shaded sites. Mixed-conifer forb com­
munities on the Kaibab Plateau are not as diverse as in other similar 
forest types in the Southwest, and some species require heavy shade 
found under tree canopies (Merkle, 1962). Historically these forests 
were Pinus ponderosa-dominated. As in much of the Southwest, quanti­
tative historical data on understory species composition is lacking. 
Prior to the Rose Fire, the area had not burned since 1879, and forest 
tree density was reported to be higher by a factor of nearly four at this 
time, with a greater abundance of shade-tolerant species, compared with 
historic conditions indicated by dendrochronological reconstructions 
(Fule et al., 2002). The Rose Fire brought tree density at the site down to 
levels closer to the natural range of variability (NRV) with respect to fire 
and forest structure (Ful´e & Laughlin, 2007; Stoddard et al., 2020) 
(Fig. 1, Table 1).

2.4. Spruce-fir site burned by the Poplar fire (Big Springs/Little Park) 
Forests of the Big Springs/Little Park site were dominated by spruce 
(Picea engelmannii, P. pungens) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), with a 
number of other co-occurring coniferous species, contributing to a more 
xeric mix of species than found at more northern latitudes. Understory 
plant communities contained species typical of northern boreal habitats, 
with Juniperus communis and Berberis repens the only notable shrubs 
historically (Rasmussen, 1941; Merkle, 1954; White & Vankat, 1993). 
Populus tremuloides was also a dominant species at this site, and Abies 
concolor, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Picea pungens and Pinus ponderosa were 
all found at lower elevations historically and currently (Merkle, 1954). 
Common herbaceous species at this site included those that are more 
shade tolerant, such as Pyrola spp., Aquilegia spp., Goodyera oblongifolia, 
Chimaphila umbellata, Poa fendleriana and upland Carex spp. 
The fire regime of these forests was historically mixed-severity, 
differing between aspects, with low-severity surface fires occurring 
primarily on drier south and west-facing aspects and infrequent stand- 
replacing fires on more mesic north-facing slopes. The Poplar Fire 
burned in a combination of cool and wet mixed-conifer forest and 
spruce-fir forest types with a mix of surface and crown fire activity. Plots 
were located primarily on the northern portion of the fire in the spruce- 
fir type. Before the Poplar fire, the site had not experienced a major fire 
since 1879; however, long fire-free periods are characteristic of natural 
disturbance regimes of this forest type (Ful´e & Laughlin, 2007). 
2.5. Field data collection 
Prior to the fires of 2003, we installed long-term monitoring plots, in 
1998 in the pine-oak and mixed-conifer sites, and in 2001 in spruce-fir. 
Plots were placed using a systematic 300 × 300 m grid in the pine-oak 
and mixed-conifer forest types, and placed on a 600 × 1200 m grid 
across the landscape in the spruce-fir type. Measurement protocols were 
derived from the National Park Service’s Western Region Fire Monitoring 
Handbook (National Park Service, 1992), and were designed to capture 
understory plant cover and species presence-absence. Plots were 20 ×
50 m rectangles (0.1 ha in size), aligned parallel with the general slope 
of each plot, with the halfway point located at plot center. Plant com­
munity data were collected using the point line-intercept method on two 
50 m transects along the outer edges of the plots. Species were recorded 
at each point at 30 cm intervals. In addition, a complete species list was 
compiled along the two “belt” transects, 5 m to either side for a total of 
10 × 50 m per transect (500 m2). At 30 cm intervals along each transect, 
we recorded tree canopy (vegetation > 137 cm in height) using a 
densitometer. As part of a larger study examining the effects of these 
fires on forest structure, we collected additional overstory measure­
ments that are detailed in Stoddard et al. (2020). 
The fires of 2003 burned a subset of the originally sampled plots, and 
we remeasured this subset of plots in late spring and summer of 2005. 
For the current study, the subset of plots was remeasured in 2015 over 
the same timeframe in spring and summer, which was twelve years after 
the 2003 fires, and fourteen/seventeen years after our first round of 
measurements (1998, 2001). We remeasured 17 randomly selected plots 
of the 36 original plots installed in the pine-oak site and burned by the 
Powell Fire, 15 of 20 in mixed-conifer burned in the Rose Fire, and 11 of 
18 of the plots installed in the spruce-fir and burned by the Poplar Fire. 
Burn severity was calculated using the Monitoring Trends in Burn 
Severity (MTBS) database (https://www.mtbs.gov, accessed May 2016). 
The percentage of our plots in each burn severity class are listed in 
Table 1. More detailed information on methods and fire characteristics 
can be obtained from Laughlin et al. (2005) and Stoddard et al. (2020). 
Taxa that could not be reliably identified to species were grouped to 
the genus or family level. Those that could not be identified to family 
were removed from community analyses. Species were classified by 
growth habit (tree, shrub, forb, graminoid, etc.), life form (perennial, 
biennial or annual) and nativity (native or non-native). Nomenclature 
was obtained from published Flora of North America volumes (Flora of 
North America Editorial Committee, 1993+), Integrated Taxonomic 
Information System (ITIS) and Kearney & Peebles (1960). Nativity of 
plant species was assigned using the USDA Plants Database (https 
://www.plants.usda.gov) (USDA, NRCS, 2021). We recorded 218 spe­
cies over the three forests. Based on work by Stevens et al. (2015, 2019) 
all species were assigned biogeographical affinity codes relating to their 
evolutionary history (see Raven & Axelrod, 1978) (Supplemental Ma­
terials - Appendix A1). We grouped species according to whether they 
were cool-mesic or warm-xeric and determined the proportion of species 
that had an affinity for north-temperate conditions. 
2.6. Data analysis 
We addressed our research question of determining whether there 
were differences in species richness, diversity (Shannon index) and ab­
solute cover over time by analyzing data within each site before the fire 
and two and twelve years after fire. We analyzed differences in pre- and 
post-fire species absolute cover and richness (Fehmi, 2010) of all woody 
and herbaceous species in understory communities, which we defined as 
vegetation <137 cm in height. Furthermore, we analyzed differences in 
pre- and post-fire growth form cover. We tested for changes in these 
univariate variables two and twelve years after the fire using a Wilcoxon 
signed-rank test (SAS JMP® Version Pro 13 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, 
1989–2021)). Transect data were summarized for each plot, and plot 
data within each of the three forest types were averaged to produce a 
single value for each understory variable. Alpha levels (0.05/3) were 
adjusted using a Bonferonni correction (Kuehl, 1994). Plant cover values 
were obtained from point line-intercept transect data and richness and 
diversity used presence data from plot belt species lists. 
Prior to community analyses, species found in two or fewer plots 
were removed from the analysis. Due to the smaller number of species 
captured by the point line-intercept method, we used species presence 
data from the larger belt transects for each plot for all community an­
alyses. To assess compositional changes over time we used nonmetric 
multidimensional scaling (NMS) (PC-ORD version 7.08) using year to 
define the communities in each forest type (Peck, 2016). Based on stress 
levels, 3-D ordinations were recommended at all three sites but are 
shown graphically in 2-D for easier viewing. We also calculated a 
distance-based MANOVA (perMANOVA) (Anderson, 2001) with 
Bray–Curtis dissimilarity distance measure (Faith et al., 1987) to 
compare whether the plant communities were similar across years, and 
an indicator species analysis (ISA) for each site × year combination 
using the Dufrˆene & Legendre (1997) method (PC-ORD software version 
7.08; McCune & Mefford, 2016). We assessed for explanatory variables 
associated with the NMS ordination axes, including burn severity, trees 
per hectare (TPH), tree basal area (BA), tree importance values (which 
measure dominance of tree species), percent tree canopy, slope, eleva­
tion, aspect, slope position, IMI (integrated moisture index, which in­
corporates a slope-aspect shading index, cumulative flow of water 
downslope, curvature of the landscape, and water-holding capacity of 
the soil) (Iverson et al., 1997), CTI (compound topographic index or 
steady state wetness index, a secondary attribute that is a complex of 
primary attributes including slope, aspect, and others), SEI (site expo­
sure index), and VPD (vapor pressure deficit is the amount of water in 
the air in terms of pressure versus how much water the air can hold when 
saturated) (see Moore et al., 1993; Gessler et al., 1995; Balice et al., 
2000; and Jenness, 2006 for discussions of these environmental tech­
niques). Topographic Position Index (TPI) and other landform variables 
were obtained using Topographic Position Index (TPI) v. 1.2 (Jenness, 
2006), which calculates TPI grids from elevation grids and then classifies 
the landscape into slope position and landform categories. Explanatory 
variables were log-transformed. In the final analyses we removed those 
variables that were redundant. The r2 cutoff was 0.2.

3. Results 
3.1. Pine-oak (Powell Plateau) 
Mean species richness derived from the 10x50 m belt transect data 
increased in 2005, from 35 to 42 species per plot, and then returned to 
roughly pre-fire levels of 37 species per plot by 2015 (Fig. 3). Species 
diversity was significantly lower in 2015 from pre-fire levels (Fig. 3). 
Species with the highest cover, based on point line-intercept data in 
1998 prior to the fire, were primarily perennial grasses and legumes. 
Following the fire, there was a significant decline in aerial plant cover in 
both 2005 and 2015, when compared to pre-fire values (Fig. 3). All 
growth forms except for trees experienced this decline (Table 2). By 
2005 (two years after fire), highest cover was still represented by 
perennial grasses and legumes, with the addition of Bromus tectorum 
(cheatgrass), an annual invasive grass, and this trend continued into 
2015. While most species decreased in cover, B. tectorum increased by 
202% in 2015 over pre-fire levels. Of the 57 forb species recorded over 
the course of the study, cover of 45 species decreased between 1998 and 
2015, and only five species increased. Those with the largest increases 
(160–260%) were Crepis intermedia, Dieteria canescens and Heliomeris 
multiflora, all wind-dispersed members of the Asteraceae family. 
Tragopogon dubius, and Castilleja spp. showed a very slight increase. In 
2015 we failed to observe cover for twenty-three forbs for which we had 
recorded cover prior to the fire. 
Graminoids exhibited a similar trend to that of forbs with eight of ten 
species recorded in 1998 declining in cover, including five for which we 
failed to record cover in 2015. Elymus elymoides, Poa fendleriana and 
Carex spp. declined 68–83% in cover between 1998 and 2015. Of the 
twelve woody species recorded in 1998, cover of all declined by 2015, 
with the exception of Pinus ponderosa. Non-native cover increased over 
time due to an increase in B. tectorum, detected in 82% of plots. Other 
than cheatgrass, the only other non-native species recorded was Trag­
opogon dubius. 
The NMS ordination (Fig. 4) hints strongly that the plant community 
composition shifted away from the pre-fire community in 2005, but by 
2015 was similar to the pre-fire community once again. The explanatory 
variables of elevation and vapor pressure deficit may have been 
contributing in part to changes in the plant community over time. No 
other explanatory variables tested had r2 cutoff values > 0.2. The Per­
MANOVA had an F value of 3.8120 (p < 0.001). Pairwise comparisons 
by year all demonstrated p-values < 0.002. The MRPP produced an A 
value of 0.159 with a p-value < 0.001. The only indicator species from 
1998 was Comandra umbellata. Indicator species in 2005 were mostly 
Fig. 3. Changes in understory diversity, richness and cover over time from pre- to post-fire measurements within each forest type were tested with non-parametric 
matched pairs Wilcoxon signed-ranked tests. Alpha levels (0.05/3) were adjusted using a Bonferonni correction (Kuehl 1994). Box plots represent minimum, 25th, 
50th, and 75th percentiles, whiskers represent 10th and 90th percentiles and dotted lines represent means. Grey bands represent the 95% confidence interval.

ruderals (early colonizers) with the addition of two geophytes (Allium 
bisceptrum and Calochortus spp.). 2015 indicator species were a wind- 
dispersed perennial with prolific seed production (Dieteria canescens), 
Pinus ponderosa, and the perennial forb Pseudocymopterus montanus 
(Table 3). The proportion of species with a north-temperate biogeo­
graphical affinity remained similar across all three years of measure­
ments (Fig. 5). 
3.2. Warm-dry mixed-conifer (Swamp Ridge) 
Mean species richness per plot increased over time with a significant 
difference between 1998 and 2015 (22 vs. 29 species). Shannon di­
versity also increased with time and was significantly different all three 
years (Fig. 3). Following the 2003 fire, there was a significant decline in 
mean plant cover two years post-fire when compared to pre-fire, fol­
lowed by a slight increase by 2015. However, at this time cover had not 
regained levels recorded prior to the fire (17% pre-fire (1998), 11% in 
2005 and 12% in 2015). The trends observed were exhibited by all plant 
life forms, including the graminoids, perennial forbs and trees, with 
shrub cover remaining flat following the fire. There was little shrub 
cover at this site (<1% all three years) and also low cover of annual/ 
biennial forbs (<1%) (Table 2). Plant cover at this site was nearly 100% 
native in all time periods. Species with the highest cover in 2015 were 
perennial sedges and grasses, Abies concolor, Pinus ponderosa, and Fra­
garia virginiana. Cover for only one species of fern (Pteridium aquilinum) 
was recorded over the course of the study. Forbs with the largest in­
creases in cover by 2015 included Antennaria parvifolia, Geranium 
richardsonii, and Fragaria virginiana. Solidago spp. decreased in cover by 
80%, Antennaria marginata by 75%, and Achillea millefolium by 50%. 
Cover of Pinus ponderosa and Populus tremuloides in the understory 
increased by 186 and 134% respectively. Abies concolor and Robinia 
neomexicana declined by 59 and 83%, respectively, but for Robinia this 
may have been due in part to increased growth leading to their entry 
into the overstory size classes and no longer recorded as part of the 
understory. 
Cover of non-native species was negligible (<1%) and was repre­
sented only by Verbascum thapsus in 2015. Differences in non-native 
cover before and after fire were not significant in this forest type. 
Presence of other non-natives was detected in 2015 on belt species lists, 
although not widespread enough to be detected in cover estimates. Non- 
native species recorded across the site on species lists included the in­
vasives Cirsium vulgare and Bromus tectorum, as well as Lactuca serriola, 
Tragopogon dubius, and Verbascum thapsus. 
The NMS ordination indicated the plant community twelve years 
post-fire had a slightly different composition than pre-fire (Fig. 4). The 
explanatory variables of tree canopy cover, IMI (integrated moisture 
index) and SEI (site exposure index) were possible influencers of the 
observed community responses. No other explanatory variables tested 
had r2 cutoff values > 0.2. The PerMANOVA had an F value of 5.0133 (p 
< 0.001). Pairwise comparisons by year all had p values < 0.001. The 
MRPP produced an A value of 0.2257 and a p value of 0.001. One species 
was an indicator of pre-fire conditions, the orchid Goodyera oblongifolia 
(Table 3). By two years post-fire, there were two ruderal indicator spe­
cies/genera (Chenopodium spp. and Polygonum douglasii). In 2015, there 
was an assortment of eleven indicator species consisting mostly of ru­
derals, fire-adapted and/or wind dispersed species (Table 3). After an 
increase in species with a more xeric/southern biogeographical affinity 
in 2005, the proportion of those with a northern affinity returned to pre- 
fire levels (Fig. 5). 
3.3. Spruce-fir (Big Springs/Little Park) 
At the spruce-fir site, neither richness nor diversity were significantly 
different among the three years (Fig. 3). This site exhibited a similar 
pattern to that found in the mixed-conifer, with a non-significant decline 
in plant cover in 2005. However, it was followed by a slight significant 
increase in cover by 2015 (Fig. 3). The initial decline was likely due 
primarily to loss of tree and graminoid cover. There was a very slight 
increase in cover of forbs, both perennial and annual/biennial, as well as 
shrubs, by 2015, but no significant differences were observed between 
any growth forms over time. 
The most common species pre-fire were graminoids and woody 
species. Cover for only one fern species was recorded (Pteridium aquili­
num), and cover of this species declined over time, by 67% between 
2001 (pre-fire) and 2015. Cover was recorded for 44 forb species over 
the course of the study (2001–2015). Many of the forb species that 
increased in cover were wind-dispersed members of the Asteraceae and 
Onagraceae families, whereas many of the species that decreased in 
cover were in Ericaceae, Fabaceae, and Orchidaceae. Many graminoids 
also decreased in cover, but Poa fendleriana increased by 54% over pre- 
fire levels. Carex spp. cover declined by 32% from pre-fire levels. Most 
shrub species increased by 2015, but Berberis repens, Juniperus communis 
and Amelanchier alnifolia all decreased by 69–100%. By 2015 Populus 
tremuloides cover increased by 68%, but all other tree species in the 
understory decreased. Non-native cover was negligible (<1%), other 
than one instance of Bromus tectorum contributing to cover values and 
recorded in 2015. Thus, differences in non-native cover before and after 
fire were not significant. Presence of non-native species recorded in 
2015, but not in the previous measurements, included B. tectorum, 
Verbascum thapsus and Dieteria canescens. 
The NMS ordination revealed a plant community in 2015 that was 
quite different from the pre-fire community (Fig. 4). The explanatory 
variables of CTI, SEI, TPI, and BA may have been contributing to changes 
in composition over time. No other explanatory variables tested had r2 
cutoff values > 0.2. The PerMANOVA had an F value of 2.8266 (p <
0.001). Pairwise comparisons by year all showed p-values < 0.02. The 
MRPP produced an A value of 0.175 and p-value < 0.001. Indicator 
species pre-fire were species adapted to shade and intolerant of distur­
bance and included Goodyera oblongifolia, Pyrola spp. and Abies lasio­
carpa (Table 3). Following fire, indicator species were primarily

ruderals. By 2015, ruderals were still present, represented by wind- 
dispersed perennial forbs in the Asteraceae family, and joined by other 
species with a tolerance for more open and sunny conditions including 
Rubus idaeus and Pinus ponderosa. The pattern for biogeographical af­
finities was similar to the mixed-conifer in that the proportion of those 
with a northern affinity returned to pre-fire levels in 2015, after an in­
crease in species with a more xeric/southern biogeographical affinity in 
2005 (Fig. 5).

the vegetation of the North Rim has led to various published papers and 
related debates (for example see Young, 2002; Binkley et al., 2006). 
Naturally ignited fires for multiple benefits or objectives have been used 
for decades on the North Rim in an effort to return fire to its natural role 
in the system. Overall these fires in our study sites have had mostly a 
thinning effect on the smaller, shorter, fire-susceptible species such as 
true firs and spruces, a delayed mortality effect of larger and older trees, 
and a shift toward Pinus ponderosa dominance at the higher elevation 
sites (Ful´e et al., 2004a, 2004b; Higgins et al., 2015; Stoddard et al., 
2020). 
In most southwestern ponderosa-pine dominated forests, low- 
severity fires result in few changes to the overstory environment and 
little mortality of sprouting woody species, generally performing more 
of a maintenance role (Strand et al., 2019). Any effects to the understory 
are likely because of a reduction in organic matter on the forest floor and 
associated changes occurring to the soil environment (Gildar et al., 
2004). Changes to the understory environment and associated plant 
community are highly variable, depending on the amount of organic 
matter at the soil surface that is consumed, effects from previous fires, 
species’ tolerance to fire, aspect, and other environmental factors (Gil­
dar et al., 2004; Kuenzi et al., 2008; Laughlin & Ful´e, 2008). Two years 
after fire in the same general area as our current study, species richness 
was highest at sites with moderate duff (dense layer of partially 
decomposed pine needles) depths, but this relationship did not hold for 
burned spruce-fir forests (Laughlin & Ful´e, 2008). 
Following moderate to high intensity fires, effects are also variable 
depending on a particular species’ tolerance to fire. In general, under­
story cover rebounds after the initial mortality, due in part to decreased 
tree canopy cover and subsequent increased sunlight, as well as other 
factors such as a release of nutrients. In some cases, higher cover values 
persist through time (Stoddard et al., 2011; Springer et al., 2018). There 
is also often a corresponding increase in diversity due to the appearance 
of ruderals from the soil seedbank or nearby remnant populations 
(Crawford et al., 2001; Korb et al., 2005). 
4.1. Pine-oak changes following the Powell Fire (Powell Plateau) 
The Powell Fire that burned over our plots consisted of primarily 
unburned and low-severity conditions and was basically a maintenance 
fire as described in Stoddard et al. (2020) (Table 1). However, even 
though the fire was mostly low-severity and had statistically insignifi­
cant impacts on the forest structure, the fire would have consumed 
enough of the O horizon to allow plants to capitalize on newly created 
suitable habitat. Cheatgrass was able to increase by a significant amount 
following fire. This species is well-adapted to fire and can increase 
considerably following prescribed burning and wildfires (McGlone et al., 
2009; Brooks et al., 2016). Plant cover declined steeply over time for all 
growth forms (Fig. 3) (Table 2). Though seed sources were likely still 
present in the mineral soil (Korb et al., 2005), and competing vegetation 
may have been reduced by fire, the understory species may have been 
constrained in their responses due to drought or bison grazing. Although 
we did not have the benefit of a control in our study to tease out drought 
effects, we did capitalize on a set of sample plots established before the 
wildfires and described changes as allowed by this natural experiment. 
The only two potentially influential explanatory variables we tested 
with an r2 value >0.2 were elevation and vapor pressure deficit, which 
displayed an oppositional relationship to one another (Fig. 4). Responses 
in plant cover and diversity at this lower elevation and drier site may be 
related to microsite variations such as slope and aspect that were not 
detected at the scale available for use in our analyses, but climate change 
coupled with long-term drought may be having a deleterious impact on 
the plant community. 
The ordination of the data suggested that the site experienced a shift 
in species composition two years after fire, but then over a decade later, 
was more similar to the pre-fire composition (Fig. 4). Significant 
indicator species two years post-fire included several annual ruderal 
species (e.g., Chenopodium spp., Polygonum douglasii, Collinsia parviflora, 
Lactuca serriola, Microsteris gracilis). This group of species occurring post- 
fire is similar to reports by others studying frequent-fire forest systems 
(Bataineh et al., 2006; Moore et al., 2006; Laughlin & Ful´e, 2008). Other 
significant indicator species were the invasive annual grass Bromus tec­
torum, and two geophytes (Calochortus spp., and Allium bisceptrum) 
(Table 3). By 2015 the ruderals were no longer indicators of the plant 
community, but Pinus ponderosa and the common wind-dispersed 
perennial Dieteria canescens were now indicators, along with Pseudocy­
mopterus montanus. All are commonly found in pine forests in northern 
Arizona and are well-adapted to the more open, dry, and sunny condi­
tions at this lower elevation site. The lack of major species compositional 
changes may be site-specific, since the pine-oak forest on Powell Plateau 
has experienced a fairly regular fire regime since Euro-American set­
tlement, whereas the other two sites in our study have not. 
Although not examined in our study, contemporary year-round 
presence of bison on the plateau may also be a possible contributing 
factor to the declining plant cover. Evidence of bison from the Grand 
Canyon region in fossil and archaeological records, as well as in local 
ethnography (NPS GCNP, 2017) up to European contact, does support 
their likely presence at times, but never in any great abundance in the 
Holocene prior to the release of bison onto the Kaibab Plateau in 1906 
(Martin et al., 2017). They have been permanent year-round residents of 
the forests of the Kaibab Plateau since 2009 (Pearson, 2019), and recent 
estimates place the herd numbers at between 300 and 600 (National 
Park Service, 2019, 2020). Although their effects in GCNP are currently 
being monitored, there is evidence of damage to vegetation, and their 
numbers are being actively reduced (Reimondo, 2012; National Park 
Service, GCNP, 2017). Elevated numbers of bison in Yellowstone Na­
tional Park have been found to limit the structure, composition and 
distribution of woody plant communities through herbivory and tram­
pling as well as damage to tree bark (Beschta et al., 2020). Bison are also 
known to heavily utilize vegetation during extreme drought and to move 
to more productive areas in search of forage (Plumb et al., 2016). 
Although bison impacts were not a focal point of this study, we observed 
scat, well-defined game trails, hoofprints and wallows on plots in the 
mixed-conifer and spruce-fir (J. Springer, personal observations). Bison 
have been observed to utilize Powell Plateau, particularly in the winter 
(National Park Service, 2020). 
In the sense of species composition returning to a plant community 
similar to that present pre-fire, this site demonstrated the most resiliency 
of the three sites. However, the decline in plant cover and increase in 
cheatgrass are of concern and demonstrate a corresponding lack of 
resiliency due most likely to some form of continuing disturbance such 
as drought, grazing, a lack of propagules, or a combination of factors. 
4.2. Warm-dry mixed-conifer forest changes following the Rose fire 
(Swamp Ridge) 
At the mixed-conifer site, while not significantly lower than pre-fire, 
average plant cover had declined to 12.2% by 2015, below pre-fire levels 
of 17.3%. Tree basal area and canopy cover were notably reduced by the 
fire (see Stoddard et al., 2020), so lack of an increase in understory cover 
was an unexpected finding. A review by Abella & Springer (2015) 
concluded that plant cover in mixed-conifer forests tended to increase 
following reductions in overstory canopy cover due to restoration 
thinning and prescribed fire, and also tended to persist through the 
short-term. The most likely causal factors of the decline at this site could 
be bison grazing, long-term drought, or an interaction of the two. 
Community changes at the mixed-conifer site showed mixed and 
difficult to interpret results for a potential shift toward dominance of 
species adapted to warm-xeric conditions (Stevens et al., 2015). For 
example, the genus Carex spp., was the most frequently recorded 
component of plant cover prior to the fire. However, by 2015, cover of 
these mostly shade-tolerant and highly adaptable species (that are also 
J.D. Springer et al.

consumed by grazing herbivores including bison) had decreased by 
46%. Many southwestern members of this genus can also thrive in open 
and sunny conditions following a decrease in tree canopy, so this 
reduction may have been due to grazing or drought or an interaction of 
the two but likely not to a reduced tree canopy. Abies concolor seedlings 
were also a major component of plant cover prior to the fire, but 
consistent with findings by Stoddard et al. (2020), cover of this species 
decreased in the understory by 60% in 2015, likely due to direct fire 
impacts to individual trees, but also possibly due to competition or to 
long-term drought conditions, since seedlings are very susceptible to soil 
drying or heating (Fire Effects Information System (FEIS), 2020). 
Mesic or north-temperate species that were present before the fire 
but not observed in subsequent monitoring from the plot species lists 
included Goodyera oblongifolia and Ligusticum porteri. However, analysis 
of the proportion of north-temperate species indicated the percentage of 
species that are adapted to cooler and moister conditions eventually 
returned to pre-fire levels (Fig. 5). Likely, the species adapted to these 
conditions changed, perhaps from Carex and grass-dominated to 
perennial forb or woody species domination. By 2015 Pteridium aquili­
num had declined 73% from pre-fire levels, which is unusual because it is 
a fire-adapted species and often highly persistent. Under current climate 
projections, modeling simulations indicate that the Kaibab Plateau 
could undergo a type change to forests dominated by pinyon-juniper, 
Quercus gambelii and Pinus ponderosa (Flatley & Ful´e, 2016). Climate 
change is increasing fire frequency and severity throughout the South­
west, and the post-fire climate drives successional trajectories. Unex­
pected outcomes may ensue from the linkages between fire, climate 
change and other disturbances (Buma, 2015) that may or may not be 
easily observable at the community level. Examples of such outcomes 
might include loss of species requiring a mesic habitat due to modifi­
cations of forest structure or the creation of novel ecosystems due to the 
introduction of invasive plant or animal species, or as a result of climate 
change. 
Verbascum thapsus was the only non-native species for which cover 
was reported in 2015, an important finding, for non-native and/or 
invasive species are often common following disturbance such as high- 
severity fire (Crawford et al., 2001). Non-native species tend to 
decrease with increasing elevation and with distance from hiking trails, 
roads and cities, and our study sites are fairly remote from any major 
roads (Guo et al., 2018). Although we did not record cover of Bromus 
tectorum at this site on our point line intercept transects, its presence was 
detected on the overall species lists. Generally regarded as an invader of 
middle elevations, it is adapted to live at higher elevations of the North 
Rim and has been recorded in burned areas in close proximity to our 
study site (Huisinga et al., 2005). 
Species richness was low compared to other southwestern dry mixed- 
conifer forests in the region in eastern Arizona and southwestern Colo­
rado, where species richness averages 50–60+ per 500 m2 (Springer 
et al., 2018, Korb et al., 2020). Higher richness in these other regions is 
most likely due to a monsoonal gradient or topographic features that 
favor increased precipitation. The North Rim is also geographically 
isolated from similar forest types, preventing introduction of propa­
gules. However, richness and diversity trended upward through time. 
Some explanatory variables that may have been contributing to trends in 
the composition of the plant community at the North Rim included tree 
canopy, likely due to a reduction from fire, and IMI (integrated moisture 
index) (Iverson et al., 1997) (r2 > 0.2). The fire potentially created an 
environment favoring species adapted to lower moisture levels and 
higher light levels associated with decreased tree canopy. 
Based on indicator species analyses and presence-absence surveys, 
species composition appears to be moving away over time from those 
species that prefer mesic conditions to those that are tolerant of more 
xeric and sunny conditions. Only two species/genera produced signifi­
cant indicator values in 2005 and both were annual ruderals (Cheno­
podium spp. and Polygonum douglasii) (Table 3). In contrast, eleven 
species with varying growth habits, life forms and functional groups 
demonstrated significant indicator values in 2015 (Table 3). Ruderals 
were still common, which ran counter to our expectations, because 
twelve years had passed since fire and ruderals are generally assumed to 
be ephemeral following disturbance. However, these species do well in 
open and sunny areas following disturbance, lending weight to our 
research objective to determine if species are becoming more adapted to 
warm-xeric conditions and points toward possible effects of fire severity. 
Other possible explanations for the presence of ruderals could be due to 
continued disturbances such as tree mortality, tree fall, soil erosion or 
bison impacts. Many 2015 indicator species were either fire tolerant or 
fire-adapted (Table 3) (FEIS, 2020), including two fire-adapted tree 
species, Pinus ponderosa and Pseudotsuga menziesii. Both species are 
indicative of, and dominant in, this warm-dry mixed-conifer forest type 
across the Southwest. 
Factors that may have limited community responses in our study 
include long-term effects of drought (Fig. 2) as well as direct mortality 
from fire, fire severity, and possible limited availability of propagules. In 
addition, bison evidence was more numerous and widespread in this 
area in 2015 than in 2005, and bison grazing could be having an in­
fluence on herbaceous vegetation (J. Springer, personal observations). 
As opposed to the pine-oak site, the presence of so many species adapted 
to drier and more open conditions indicates that the site may still be in 
the process of recovery or reorganizing (Falk et al., 2022). As tree 
regeneration increases and in the absence of new disturbance, mesic 
species occupying the site previously may begin to return, or the 
dominant species may adapt to drier and warmer conditions. Both could 
be considered a type of resilience. According to Falk et al. (2022), re­
covery requires the establishment of new individual plants. However, if 
recovery fails to re-establish the pre-disturbance community, such as 
might occur if there are limited propagules, the end result may be a new 
state or a type conversion. 
4.3. Spruce-fir site in the Poplar Fire (Big Springs/Little Park) 
Stoddard et al. (2020) reported that the spruce-fir site had the 
highest burn severity and accompanying delayed tree mortality. Initially 
a decline in tree basal area, density, and canopy cover was due to 
mortality of smaller, fire-intolerant and shade-tolerant species that 
would be expected to occupy a spruce-fir forest: Abies lasiocarpa, Picea 
engelmannii, Abies concolor and Populus tremuloides. However, by 2015, 
there was a six-fold increase of quaking aspen saplings, and the post-fire 
community was dominated by P. tremuloides, A. concolor, Pinus ponder­
osa and Robinia neomexicana, all species that can tolerate more open and 
dry conditions (Stoddard et al., 2020). In this current study, plant cover 
percentage at the spruce-fir site was roughly similar to that in the mixed- 
conifer, but the plant community was more diverse and with higher 
variability across plots. Reasons for this were probably a combination of 
factors, including a variety of microsites created by topography as well 
as a higher percentage of the area burned by high-severity fire, leading 
to tree mortality and the creation of new habitat and more heterogeneity 
across the landscape. By 2015 plant cover had not recovered to pre-fire 
levels (Fig. 3). 
The ordination indicated that species composition on the plots 
became more similar following the fire. However, the community in 
2015 appeared to be less similar to that which was present prior to the 
fire. Plant community characteristics may have been influenced by tree 
basal area (BA), SEI (site exposure index), CTI (compound topographic 
index or steady state wetness index) and TPI (topographic position 
index). The indicator species Goodyera oblongifolia, Pyrola spp. and Abies 
lasiocarpa represented the pre-fire community; ruderals and annuals 
were the primary indicator species of the community in 2005; and wind- 
dispersed, ruderal and fire-adapted species were indicator species of the 
plant community in 2015. Similar to the mixed-conifer site, this site 
appears to be in a reorganization phase (Falk et al., 2022). 
In the pine-oak forest, in areas of low and perhaps moderate burn 
severity (without much tree mortality or canopy loss), we would expect 
J.D. Springer et al.

to see a return to a pre-fire community on the order of five to ten years, 
depending on annual precipitation. In mixed-conifer or spruce-fir, 
especially in areas of high severity and with accompanying tree mor­
tality and canopy cover loss, we would expect a to return to a pre-fire 
community only after many decades or even a century or more. With 
accelerated climate change, however, forest plant communities may 
move into a new trajectory where a novel species assemblage is created 
(see Falk et al., 2022). Whether these three plant communities revert to a 
pre-fire composition, experience a permanent shift that is still within the 
natural range of variability, or a permanent change with a new and 
novel trajectory due to climate change, remains to be seen. 
5. Conclusions 
Our findings indicate that the pine-oak plant community at the North 
Rim, while maintaining diversity and species richness, is not recovering 
to pre-fire cover levels following fires managed for resource objectives. 
Twelve years post-fire, cover remains at roughly pre-fire levels in warm 
mixed-conifer and spruce-fir, even though additional habitat has opened 
up, indicative of these forests still being in a recovery or reorganization 
phase. These trends are likely due to fire severity and direct mortality 
from the fires themselves followed by long-term drought leading to 
microsite changes favoring ruderal species and disfavoring species 
requiring shady and mesic conditions. Ungulate browsing and propagule 
limitation may also be factors affecting these patterns. Other than Bro­
mus tectorum, we found no other non-native species with high fre­
quencies across the study area, although some species such as Cirsium 
vulgare should be monitored. The Kaibab Plateau is a high elevation sky 
island surrounded by deserts and grasslands with few opportunities for 
propagule introductions and gene flow once species are extirpated. Ef­
forts to conserve circumboreal, shade tolerant understory species and 
their genetic integrity through in-situ and ex-situ means will ensure their 
presence in future forests of the park. Continued monitoring with 
increased frequency and intensity could lead to better understanding of 
long-term changes in these forests after resource objective fire, and 
enhance our understanding of important drivers of variation including 
interactions of climate, burn severity and herbivory by large ungulates.
