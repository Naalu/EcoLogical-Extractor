Abstract
Background: Frequent-fire forests of the western United States have undergone remarkable changes in structure,
composition, and function due to historical exclusion of naturally occurring fire. Mechanized tree thinning to
reduce forest density and fuel loads tends to be expensive and cannot be effectively implemented across all lands,
and there is increasing interest in managing naturally ignited wildfires for meeting forest restoration objectives. To
investigate general effectiveness of resource objective (RO) wildfires for restoring frequent-fire and associated
forests of the western United States, we conducted a review of the related peer-reviewed literature.
Results: Formal analysis of ecological responses to RO fires is relatively recent, and 21 of the 37 papers (57%) we
reviewed were published between the years 2010 and 2018. We found 17 studies that investigated RO fire
outcomes in Sierra Nevada forests, while other ecoregions that were represented in the literature included Arizona–
New Mexico Mountains, Middle Rockies–Blue Mountains, and the Colorado Plateau. Yosemite National Park was
utilized in 14 of the studies we reviewed. We noted several ecoregions where frequent-fire forests occur, but for
which published studies on RO fires are lacking. The main focus of research (14 studies) was related to RO fire
effects on forest structure, and next in importance was research (12 studies) related to fire severity, extent, and type,
with studies of understory vegetation responses and landscape-scale patterns or dynamics also prevalent. Research
findings indicated that RO fires were effective for reducing tree density and fire behavior; however, densities often
remained above known historical ranges of variation in several studies. Understory responses reported in the
literature were mixed with respect to effects on abundance and species richness. Increases in invasive species
abundance in areas of high burn severity were consistently reported. Research on landscape patterns indicated that
RO fires can increase heterogeneity with respect to vegetation distribution.
Conclusion: RO fires can be generally effective for restoration of frequent-fire forests, particularly on landscapes
with long histories of fire use and in areas of moderate burn severity. More research is needed to test fire outcomes
against specific restoration targets, and additional studies are needed concerning important ecological processes
and functions.

Resumen
Antecedentes: Los bosques del oeste de los Estados Unidos sujetos a incendios frecuentes han experimentado
cambios notables en estructura, composición y funciones, debido a la exclusión histórica de los fuegos que
ocurrían naturalmente. El raleo mecánico para reducir la densidad forestal y la carga de combustibles tiende a ser
costoso y no puede ser aplicado eficientemente en todos los terrenos, por lo que hay un creciente interés en
manejar fuegos iniciados naturalmente para lograr objetivos de restauración del bosque. Para investigar la
efectividad general de los fuegos como objetivo de manejo del recurso (RO) para restaurar fuegos frecuentes en
bosques asociados a ese disturbio en el oeste de los Estados Unidos, realizamos una revisión de bibliografía
relacionada y que estuviese sujeta a evaluación por pares.
Resultados: El análisis formal de las respuestas ecológicas a fuegos como objetivo de manejo (RO) es relativamente
reciente, y 21 (57%) de los 37 artículos que analizamos fueron publicados entre los años 2010 y 2018. Encontramos 17
estudios que investigaron los resultados de fuegos RO en los bosques de la Sierra Nevada, mientras que otras eco-
regiones que estuvieron representadas en la bibliografía incluyeron las Montañas de Arizona y Nuevo México, las
Rocallosas Centrales y la Cordillera Azul, y la Meseta de Colorado. Notamos diferentes eco-regiones donde los fuegos
de bosques son frecuentes, pero que carecen de estudios de RO. El principal foco de la investigación (14 estudios)
estuvo relacionada con los efectos de los RO en la estructura forestal, y el siguiente en importancia fue la investigación
(12 estudios) relacionada con la severidad, extensión, y tipo de incendio, con estudios también prevalentes de
respuesta del sotobosque y patrones a escala de paisaje o de dinámica de la vegetación. Los resultados de las
investigaciones indican que los fuegos RO fueron efectivos para reducir la densidad de árboles y el comportamiento
del fuego; sin embargo y en varios estudios, las densidades frecuentemente permanecieron por encima de los valores
conocidos de variación histórica. Las respuestas del sotobosque reportados en la literatura fueron mixtos con respecto
a los efectos sobre la abundancia y riqueza de especies. Los incrementos en especies invasoras en áreas de severidad
alta de fuegos fueron reportados consistentemente. La investigación en patrones del paisaje indicó que los fuegos RO
pueden incrementar la heterogeneidad relacionada a la distribución de la vegetación.
Conclusión: Los fuegos como objetivo de manejo de recursos (fuegos RO) pueden ser generalmente efectivos para
restaurar bosques en los cuales éste es un disturbio frecuente, particularmente en paisajes con mucha historia de uso
del fuego y en áreas quemadas con moderada severidad. Más investigaciones son necesarias para probar los
resultados del fuego ante objetivos de restauración específicos, y estudios adicionales son necesarios en relación a
otros importantes procesos y funciones ecológicas.

Introduction
Interruption of historical fire regimes and decades of fire
suppression during the twentieth century were primary
factors leading to major shifts in structure, composition,
and function of dry forest ecosystems in the western
United States (Covington et al. 1994; Allen et al. 2002;
Hessburg et al. 2019). In many frequent-fire forests, lack
of surface fire at frequent intervals allowed tree regener-
ation to proceed at rates much higher than indicated for
historical forests. In more mesic systems, shifts in tree
composition toward fire-intolerant and shade-tolerant
species resulting from fire exclusion have also been widely
reported (Schmidt et al. 2006; Hagmann et al. 2013;
Strahan et al. 2016). Changes related to tree population ir-
ruptions have included increases in hazardous fuels and
uncharacteristic fire behavior, reduced understory diver-
sity, and homogenization of stand and landscape hetero-
geneity (Covington et al. 1994; Hessburg et al. 2019). Con-
cern over these changes has motivated a series of natural
resource policy mandates aimed at expanding and acceler-
ating ecosystem restoration on public lands (Schoennagel
et al. 2009; Franklin and Johnson 2012; Schultz et al. 2012;
Stephens et al. 2016). It is widely understood that the
combination of tree thinning using machinery or by hand-
felling, with reintroduction of controlled, low-intensity
fire, is effective for meeting structural and functional res-
toration objectives, at least at small scales, in Western
frequent-fire forests (Fulé et al. 2012; McIver et al. 2013;
Sánchez Meador et al. 2017; Roccaforte et al. 2018). How-
ever, thinning treatments are often expensive, particularly
in regions where restoration treatments focus on the re-
moval of small, low-value trees (Hjerpe et al. 2009;
Nicholls et al. 2018). Further, mechanized thinning may
be infeasible for large and remote landscapes (North et al.
2015). In response to these limitations, there is increasing
interest in managing wildfires that initiate from natural ig-
nitions to achieve restoration objectives at multiple scales.

Fire has long been recognized as a critical process in
many forest ecosystems, and reintroduction of fire, with
attention to natural fire regime characteristics, is a
critical step in ecological restoration (Arno and Fiedler
2005). Ecological roles of fire include regulating tree re-
generation and influencing stand dynamics, consuming
fuel and modifying subsequent fire effects, driving under-
story
vegetation
dynamics
and
species
composition,
stimulating regeneration of sprouting species and those
with dormant seed strategies, and creating landscape mo-
saics through variability in fire behavior and tree mortality
(Whelan 1995). As early as 1968, wildfires have been
allowed to burn and play their natural role in some remote
areas of US National Park Service lands and, soon after, in
US Forest Service wilderness areas (van Wagtendonk
2007). Wildfire may also serve as a restoration treatment
to reverse ecological degradation following many years of
fire exclusion (Huffman et al. 2017). In 2009, the Federal
Wildland Fire Policy expanded the role of wildland fire
use to explicitly include fuels management as well as sev-
eral other resource management objectives, and shifted
the application of wildfire use from areas set aside for eco-
system preservation to areas managed for multiple uses
(Miller and Landres 2004). “Let burn,” the original term
for resource objective fires, was later modified to a variety
of terms including “prescribed natural fire,” “wildland fire
use” (WFU), or “managed fire,” and sometimes referred to
as “restoration wildfire” (Hunter 2007; Barros et al. 2018).
Today, these fires are often managed for multiple objec-
tives, including resource objectives. For the purposes of
our study, we use “resource objective” (hereafter, RO)
wildfire. RO wildfires may help restore degraded forests
by reducing tree densities, fuel loading, and potential for
uncharacteristic crown fire; increasing understory abun-
dance and species richness; and reestablishing landscape
conditions more resilient to disturbances such as fire,
insects, and drought. Restoration effectiveness may be
evaluated by comparing wildfire outcomes with refer-
ence information from intact sites or historical ranges
of variation (HRV) compiled from historical data or
reconstructions (White and Walker 1997; Landres et al.
1999; Romme et al. 2012). In contrast, wildfires that re-
sult in large areas of high-severity burning or loss of
key structures such as old trees, large snags, or logs, or
fires that encourage increases in invasive, nonnative
species are likely to conflict with goals for restoration
of frequent-fire forests (Noss et al. 2006; Kolb et al.
2007; Waltz et al. 2014).
To date, there has been no systematic review of peer-
reviewed literature to evaluate RO wildfire effectiveness
for accomplishing restoration objectives. Further, re-
search needs for utilizing wildfire for restoration of
frequent-fire forests of the western US have not been
clearly articulated. The objectives of our analysis were to
review the available peer-reviewed literature and address
the following questions: (1) what are the basic demo-
graphics of the available literature including publication
trends, location of studies, forest types, and research
focus?; (2) what are the primary findings related to ef-
fectiveness for restoration of frequent-fire forests of the
western United States?; and, (3) what science is still
needed to address effectiveness of RO wildfires from an
ecological restoration perspective?
Methods
Database search
To address our research questions, we conducted an
evidence-based review of articles published in peer-
reviewed journals. We systematically searched biblio-
graphic databases and compiled the relevant literature
related to wildfires utilized to meet ecological restor-
ation, fuels reduction, and ecosystem management (e.g.,
natural
disturbance
process) objectives.
Our
search
encompassed CAB Abstracts (https://www.cabdirect.org/
cabdirect), BIOSIS (https://www.ebsco.com/), Web of
Science (http://www.webofknowledge.com/), GreenFILE
(https://www.ebsco.com/),
and
the
Agricultural
and
Environmental Science Database (https://about.proquest.
com/). We used search strategies that combined terms
commonly used to describe wildfires managed to achieve
resource objectives with keywords that delineate major
frequent-fire forests of the western US. We used the fol-
lowing search strategy, with syntax depending on data-
base: [resource objective OR resource objectives OR
resource benefit OR resource benefits OR naturally ig-
nited OR natural ignition OR naturally ignite OR
lightning AND fire OR wildfire AND mixed conifer OR
mixed-conifer OR pinyon juniper OR pinyon–juniper
OR ponderosa pine OR pinus ponderosa OR jeffrey pine
OR pinyon OR juniper OR pinus jeffreyi OR pinus edulis
OR juniperus OR pinon OR WFU OR fire use OR man-
aged wildfire OR managed wildfires OR natural fire OR
natural fires OR natural wildfire OR natural wildfires].
Our initial search returned 289 articles, and this number
was then reduced to 120 articles after we examined titles
for relevance. Articles that we accepted into the final
set for review needed to represent original research that
analyzed ecological responses to resource objective
wildfires. Abstracts and body text were evaluated to de-
termine whether papers met these criteria. In addition,
published papers that did not appear in the database
searches, but were known by our team or identified
during analysis, were included if they met our criteria.
We did not review papers that solely considered
unwanted wildfires that had elicited a suppression re-
sponse from land managers, nor did we include studies
solely focused on human-ignited, prescribed fire. Lastly,

ecological restoration; therefore, we did not include
studies that solely focused on mesic forest types with
infrequent, stand-replacing fire regimes. We limited
our review to peer-reviewed journal articles, since these
are typically considered to be the highest quality
sources of science information in terms of accuracy and
reliability (Esch et al. 2018). The final set of papers we
reviewed comprised 37 peer-reviewed articles published
in scientific journals through the year 2018.
Data extraction and analysis
Data and information extracted from the 37 selected arti-
cles included basic bibliographic specifics (e.g., author
names, publication year, title, and journal), study location
and focal forest type or types, methods and analytical ap-
proaches, research findings, and author interpretations of
results. We compiled the extracted information in a mas-
ter spreadsheet to allow for categorization, sorting, and
synthesis of details to address on our main research ques-
tions. To investigate our primary research questions, we
chose to use simple counts of basic demographic charac-
teristics of the literature such as publication rate, ecore-
gions within which studies were conducted, forest type,
and research focus. We used a broad classification and de-
scriptions published by The Nature Conservancy (http://
maps.tnc.org/gis_data.html) to identify ecoregions. Be-
cause we were interested in a broad synthesis of current
state of knowledge, and due to variability in methodolo-
gies and metrics across studies included in the review, we
did not pursue meta-analysis; however, we identified and
tallied directional responses of attributes commonly used
to evaluate restoration success in frequent-fire forests of
the western US. In addition, we expected studies of wild-
fire effects to be primarily retrospective and observational,
so we did not attempt to evaluate scientific rigor or rank
science quality.
Results and Discussion
Literature demographics
Although public land managers have allowed lightning-
ignited wildfires to play their natural role in large na-
tional parks and wilderness areas beginning in the 1960s
(National Park Service) and 1970s (US Forest Service),
research on ecological responses to these events has only
recently been pursued. For example, out of the 37 papers
we reviewed, 57% were published between the years
2010 and 2018, and 38% were published between 2000
and 2009 (Fig. 1a). Only two published studies examined
ecological outcomes of RO fires between 1970 and 2000.
This recent increase in research effort likely reflects a
growth in awareness concerning ecological changes that
have resulted from anthropogenic fire exclusion in fire-
prone ecosystems, the corresponding need for ecological
restoration and fuels reduction in these forests, and
interest in using wildfire to meet targeted resource ob-
jectives. During this period (2000 to 2018), several major
policies and programs were enacted, including the
Healthy Forest Restoration Act, the Collaborative Forest
Landscape Restoration Act, Guidance of Federal Wild-
land Fire Management Policy, and the National Cohesive
Wildland Fire Management Strategy (Steen-Adams et al.
2017). We also recognize that some earlier research on RO
fires was published in “gray” literature sources (e.g., general
technical reports, government documents, conference pro-
ceedings, etc.). Although gray literature varies in terms of
scientific rigor, some of these earlier studies could have
provided additional, useful information not examined here.
Seventeen of the 37 studies we reviewed investigated
RO fire outcomes in Sierra Nevada forests in California
(Fig. 2). Other ecoregions that were less well represented
in the literature included Arizona–New Mexico Moun-
tains (seven studies), the Middle Rockies–Blue Moun-
tains (six studies), and the Colorado Plateau (four
studies). A smaller number of RO fire studies were con-
ducted in the Canadian Rocky Mountains (two studies)
and Apache Highlands in Arizona (one study) ecore-
gions (Fig. 2). Thirty-one of the 37 studies were con-
ducted in national parks or wilderness areas and 11
studies included or were focused on multiuse lands (Fig.
1b). Yosemite National Park was utilized in 14 of the
studies we reviewed. These patterns parallel wildfire pol-
icy history and development of modern fire landscapes.
For example, the National Park Service implemented
policy to allow wildfires to burn in 1968, and the first
parks to establish “let-burn zones” were Sequoia and
Kings Canyon National Parks in the Sierra Nevada range
(see van Wagtendonk 2007). Following this, Saguaro
National Park (formerly Saguaro National Monument) in
the Apache Highlands ecoregion began allowing “natural
prescribed fires” to burn in 1971, and Yosemite imple-
mented a wildland fire use program in 1972. Similarly, the
US Forest Service began allowing wildfires to burn wilder-
ness areas, the first being within the Selway-Bitterroot
Wilderness in Idaho (Middle Rockies–Blue Mountains
ecoregion) and the Gila Wilderness in New Mexico
(Arizona–New Mexico Mountains ecoregion).
As we were interested in restoration applications of
RO
fires
and
purposely
restricted
our
review
to
frequent-fire forest types, it was not surprising that 28 of
the total 37 studies we reviewed were conducted in pon-
derosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. Lawson & C. Lawson)
or Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi Murray) forests, and simi-
larly 28 of the studies were conducted in dry mixed-
conifer forests. Several studies examined fire landscapes
where more than one forest type was present. A smaller
number of the total studies (14) examined ecological re-
sponses
in
mesic
mixed-conifer
or
lower-elevation
pinyon–juniper woodlands (5 studies; Fig. 1c).

Fourteen studies were related to effects of RO fires on
forest structure, although studies reviewed were not
wholly exclusive in their objectives and some investi-
gated multiple topics (Fig. 1d). Next in prominence as a
research topic were studies of fire type (12 studies; e.g.,
crown fire or surface fire), size, or severity. We found six
studies investigating RO fire effects on understory vege-
tation, and six studies addressed landscape-scale patterns
or dynamics. We found few other topics of research in
the literature; one paper examined water resources and
forest resiliency (Boisramé et al. 2017b), one studied fire
effects on soils (DeLuca and Sala 2006), and another ex-
amined small mammal responses to RO fires (Roberts
et al. 2015).
Research findings
Forest structure
The 14 studies of forest structure (Table 1) mostly fo-
cused on tree density, mortality across diameter classes,
and impacts on species composition. Relatively few stud-
ies examined RO fire effects on hazardous fuels. Most
studies utilized unburned areas for comparison, while a
limited number of studies compared structural outcomes
to HRV. Results on responses of important fine-scale
structural attributes such as tree spatial patterns, snags,
and “large” trees were not widely reported. Restorative
effects in terms of reducing tree density were particularly
pronounced in areas where wildfires had burned repeat-
edly, such as in parks and wilderness areas with long-

standing RO fire policies. Nearly all studies reporting on
tree density changes indicated that effects aligned with
ecological restoration objectives (Table 2).
In ponderosa pine forests of the Saguaro Wilderness
in Arizona (now within Saguaro National Park) and the
Gila Wilderness in New Mexico, Holden et al. (2007)
found significantly lower tree density and fewer small-
diameter trees in burned versus unburned areas. In for-
ests experiencing two or more fires, densities ranged
from 376 to 540 trees ha−1 (Holden et al. 2007), al-
though HRV for Southwestern ponderosa pine forests
typically ranged from 56 to 138 trees ha−1 prior to an-
thropogenic fire exclusion (Reynolds et al. 2013). Large
(>45 cm diameter at breast height [dbh; 1.37 m above
ground]) tree density was not statistically different be-
tween unburned and RO fire areas (Holden et al. 2007).
Hunter et al. (2011) also found significantly lower tree
densities and canopy fuels in RO fires compared with
unburned areas on the Gila National Forest outside of
the Gila Wilderness in New Mexico. In ponderosa pine
forests experiencing two or three fires, tree densities
ranged from 310 to 337 trees ha−1 and remained above
HRV. Huffman et al. (2017) examined an array of
structural variables and found that, after first-entry RO
fires on multiuse US Forest Service lands in northern
Arizona ponderosa pine, density approached HRV (172
± 97.1 trees ha−1, 95% CI) only in areas classified as
moderate burn severity. Relative numbers of large (>40
cm dbh) trees were deficient in other burn severity clas-
ses except moderate severity, but effects on absolute
densities of large trees were not reported (Huffman et al.
2017). Huffman et al. (2018) reported that RO fires man-
aged for low-severity burning resulted in few significant
structural differences between first-entry and second-
entry wildfires, and ponderosa pine tree densities (440.2
to 480.5 trees ha−1) remained above HRV.
In mixed-conifer forests, Fulé and Laughlin (2007)
found that a single RO fire in Grand Canyon National
Park in Arizona reduced small-diameter trees by 75 to
95% and moved mid- and high-elevation forests toward
historical conditions. Much of this mortality was experi-
enced by shade-tolerant conifers, many of which had
likely established as a result of anthropogenic fire exclu-
sion, and large-tree (>37.5 cm dbh) mortality ranged
from 7 to 29% across all fires and species. Higgins et al.
(2015) also found that small-diameter white fir (Abies

was significantly lower on unburned plots (28 trees ha−1)
than on plots burned by two RO fires (113 trees ha−1) in
dry mixed-conifer forests of Grand Canyon National
Park. Larson et al. (2013) concluded that repeated wild-
fires could restore forest structure in dry mixed-conifer
forests of the Bob Marshall Wilderness in Montana by
reducing numbers of smaller Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga
menziesii [Mirbel] Franco) and lodgepole pine (Pinus
contorta Douglas ex Loudon) without negatively affect-
ing more fire-resilient ponderosa pine, but single fires
may move these ecosystems along alternative trajectories
due to initial inputs of coarse wood and unchecked
lodgepole pine regeneration. After two RO fires, mortal-
ity of small trees (<40 cm dbh) tended to be greater than
that of larger trees (>40 to 120 cm dbh) for all species
combined. In Yosemite and Sequoia and Kings Canyon

(2007a) found that trees established following fire exclu-
sion remained alive even after several decades of wildfire
use. Collins et al. (2011) compared historic (1911) tim-
ber
inventories
to
contemporary
(2005
to
2007)
conditions within dry mixed-conifer forests of Yosemite
National Park and reported that contemporary tree
densities were significantly greater than historic inven-
tories except in RO fire areas classified as moderate burn
severity.
Fire characteristics
Common variables of interest in the 12 studies of fire
characteristics (Table 1) included fire type, size, and se-
verity. Similar to studies of structure, most comparisons
of RO fire outcomes were compared against unburned
sites, but a smaller number of studies compared RO fires
to historical regimes. Most studies examining changes to
fire characteristics showed desirable outcomes of RO
fires, particularly with respect to decreases in subsequent
burn severity and fire size (Table 2). For example,
Hunter et al. (2011) reported that fire type was predicted
to be surface fire or passive crown fire at sites burned by
RO fires, whereas unburned areas were predicted to
show active crown fire in ponderosa pine forests of New
Mexico. In the Gila Wilderness in New Mexico, Rollins
et al. (2001) found that mean and maximum fire sizes
(fire area) were larger during the recent fire-use period
(1975 to 1993) compared with fires prior to Euro-
American settlement (“presettlement”). This was likely
related to changes in fuels and forest structure that arose
during the pre-modern suppression period (1909 to
1946). Parks et al. (2014) found that previous fires mod-
erated burn severity of subsequent fires, likely through
consumption of fuel, and areas with repeated fire in the
Gila Wilderness experienced lower burn severity than
those that had no other recent fires. High-severity fire in
the Gila Wilderness tended to occur more frequently on
more mesic, cooler, north-facing sites (Holden et al.
2009). Haire et al. (2013) found similar results in South-
western wilderness areas where landscape heterogeneity
resulting from fire use moderated the role of large fires,
but this pattern was not observed in the Sierra Nevada
range or Northern Rockies. Huffman et al. (2018) re-
ported no significant differences in active crown fire per-
centage between first- and second-entry RO fires, a
result probably related to mild weather conditions and
low-severity burning in these fires on multiuse, non-
wilderness lands.
In Yosemite National Park, Collins et al. (2009) re-
ported that fire landscapes can reach a self-regulating
condition in which fire extent and severity is moderated
by previous fires; however, this effect can be negated
with increasing time since last fire and fire weather.
Similarly, van Wagtendonk et al. (2012) found that fire
severity in the same Yosemite National Park area studied
by Collins et al. (2009) was related to time since last fire,
number of fires, weather, and vegetation type. In another
study, Collins and Stephens (2010) reported that stand-

ecological restoration success in frequent-fire forests of the
western United States. Bolded responses are typically

studies; some publications reported on responses of multiple

replacing fire patch sizes were related to vegetation,
whereas smaller patches were associated with shrub-
and pine-dominated vegetation and larger patches were
more common in shade-tolerant and fir-dominated for-
ests. Miller et al. (2012) concluded that, due to differ-
ences in fire-use policies and history, fires in Yosemite
National Park showed a lower percentage of high-
severity
burning,
smaller high-severity
patches,
and
smaller fire sizes than fires in non-wilderness areas on
national forests of the Sierra Nevada region. Indeed,
Collins and Stephens (2007a) found that RO fires in
Yosemite and Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks
behaved similarly to those of the historical, pre-fire-
exclusion period in terms of frequency, effects, and ex-
tent, although trees established during the fire-exclusion
period survived. In contrast, Brown et al. (1994) esti-
mated that, for all fire regimes types in the Selway-
Bitterroot Wilderness in Montana, annual area burned
by stand-replacing fire was 1.5-fold greater during the
pre-fire-exclusion period, and annual area burned by
non-lethal “understory” fire was 1.9-fold greater during
this period (determined from fire return interval sam-
ples), compared with annual area burned during the re-
cent RO fire period (determined from total area of
mapped fires averaged over the 12-year RO period). For
lower-elevation fire regime types, presettlement to RO
period ratios for annual area burned by stand-replacing
and understory fire were 1.2 and 2.2, respectively. Inter-
estingly, Meyer (2015) reported that RO fire severity
proportions and high-severity patch sizes tended to be
within HRV in four national forests of the southern
Sierra Nevada range.
Understory vegetation
We found relatively few studies (6) focused on under-
story vegetation (Table 1), and RO fire effects on abun-
dance and species richness varied (Table 2). Studies
reporting on understory species composition changes
consistently indicated increases in exotic species abun-
dance after RO wildfires (Table 2). Laughlin et al. (2004)
made use of repeated measurements before and after
RO fires and compared a first-entry fire site to two refer-
ence sites with intact, frequent-fire regimes in ponderosa
pine forests of Grand Canyon National Park. These au-
thors found that the RO fire shifted species composition
to greater similarity to the reference sites, but species
richness, plant cover, and diversity at the RO site
remained significantly lower than the reference sites
(Laughlin et al. 2004). In another study at Grand Canyon
National Park, Laughlin and Fulé (2008) showed minor
increases in understory plant cover and species richness
two years after a low-severity fire at a ponderosa pine
reference site. Increase in graminoid richness was ex-
plained by occurrence of the invasive, exotic cheatgrass
(Bromus tectorum L.; Laughlin and Fulé 2008). In pon-
derosa pine forests of the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness,
Merrill et al. (1980) reported that herbaceous biomass in
burned areas ranged from 1.3 to 1.6 times greater than
in unburned areas over four years of monitoring. Cheat-
grass showed 10 to 24% cover in burned areas over two
years, whereas cover of this species in unburned areas
was 6 to 9% (Merrill et al. 1980). In contrast to these
studies, Evangelista et al. (2004) found lower cover of
vascular plants and biological soil crust, and lower native
species richness on burned sites in comparison with un-
burned sites in juniper woodlands of Grand Staircase-
Escalante National Monument in Utah. Nonnative spe-
cies richness and cover were also higher on burned sites
than unburned sites, although cheatgrass dominated
both types of sites in this system (Evangelista et al.
2004). Based on parallel findings at ponderosa pine–
Douglas-fir sites in Selway-Bitterroot and Frank Church
River of No Return (Idaho) wilderness areas, Keeling
et al. (2006) suggested that site characteristics may be
more important than fire exposure in driving species
composition, and expectations of increasing understory
richness with repeated fires may not hold over long time
periods. Hunter et al. (2011) found no significant effects
of RO fires on grass and forb cover as compared with
unburned plots.
Landscape patterns
Similar to our findings for understory responses, studies of
RO fire effects on landscape-scale changes were not plentiful
in the literature (n = 6; Table 1). Studies we reviewed that
examined RO fire effects on landscape patterns, mainly
through comparisons with unburned sites, consistently
showed increases in heterogeneity (Table 2). A small num-
ber of studies suggested that landscapes experiencing de-
cades of fire use appeared stable in terms of burn severity
and increases in heterogeneity conferred greater resiliency
than fire-excluded landscapes (Table 2). Several authors sug-
gested that RO landscapes could serve as references for res-
toration planning. For example, Collins et al. (2007) studied
fires in Yosemite and Sequoia and Kings Canyon national
parks and concluded that landscape heterogeneity, as mea-
sured by variation in forest type, increased as a result of
areas burning at different severities, and over time these mo-
saics likely resembled natural patterns and could be used to
guide restoration treatments on other landscapes. Kane
et al. (2013) showed that trajectories of structural changes
were related to burn severity and forest type, but high-
severity fire tended to produce transitions to open, treeless
patches in Yosemite National Park. Similarly, Collins et al.
(2016) found that variation in vegetation structure in Yo-
semite National Park was influenced by site productivity and
previous fire severity, and again suggested that RO fires,
which have been allowed to burn in the Illilouette Creek
Huffman et al. Fire Ecology           (2020) 16:18 
Page 9 of 13

Basin since 1972, have produced a reference landscape that
could inform landscape-scale restoration planning else-
where. Boisramé et al. (2017a) reported that four decades of
Yosemite National Park fires had decreased forest cover and
had increased vegetation heterogeneity within the Illilouette
Creek Basin. Lower forest cover and greater heterogeneity at
this study site wee associated with lower drought-related
tree mortality than on adjacent fire-excluded watersheds
(Boisramé et al. 2017b). Although Collins et al. (2009) con-
cluded that free-burning fires in the Illilouette Creek Basin
can be self-limiting in terms of severity and extent when
weather conditions are not extreme and time since fire is
less than nine years, Boisramé et al. (2017a) found that met-
rics describing landscape structure at the same site were not
stable, which indicated continuing recovery from approxi-
mately 100 years of earlier fire exclusion.
Synthesis and research needs
Our review of published studies indicated that RO wild-
fires may be generally effective for restoring forest struc-
ture and fire characteristics in western US forests where
historical fire exclusion has led to degraded conditions.
However, studies focused on ecological restoration appli-
cations, and evaluation of RO wildfire effectiveness from
a restoration perspective, are not numerous. Several re-
search areas that would be productive for informing res-
toration were revealed in our review.
Multiuse lands
Relatively few published studies have been conducted out-
side national parks and wilderness areas, and although
these studies have yielded important information, particu-
larly with respect to development of fire landscapes, most
were conducted after 2010 (Fig. 1). For locations such as
Yosemite and Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks,
and Gila and Selway-Bitterroot wilderness areas, this is
around three decades after initiation of fire-use policies.
More research is needed to understand ecological re-
sponses to initial fire entry (e.g., first or second entry) and
management approaches that help optimize effectiveness
of these fires for restoration of forests on multiuse lands.
On these lands, concern over fire escape and damage to
various types of resources often forces managers to be
more cautious with regard to when and where they allow
fires to burn (Black et al. 2008). Present guidance allows
for concurrent management of any given wildfire for vari-
ous objectives, and objectives for a fire may change over
time. Thus, to more clearly evaluate general effectiveness
of wildfires for meeting restoration objectives, researchers
must work closely with managers to better understand de-
cisions and actions taken for each individual fire. Future
research should examine forest responses and restoration
benefits over time on multiuse landscapes where RO fires
are
repeatedly
managed
for
low-severity
burning.
Response variables of interest could include fuels dynam-
ics and those that can be affected by forest density such as
potential fire behavior and understory vegetation.
Understudied ecoregions
RO fire studies were predominantly located in ecore-
gions of California, particularly in the Sierra Nevada
range, the northern Rocky Mountains, and the South-
west. Interestingly, we found a lack of published studies
for some important ecoregions where frequent-fire eco-
systems occur and where wildland fires are utilized for
resource benefits. For example, LANDFIRE Fire Regime
Groups maps (https://www.landfire.gov/) indicate fre-
quent, low-severity fire, forest landscapes in Utah High
Plateaus, Southern Rocky Mountains, Utah-Wyoming
Rocky Mountains, Black Hills, and Okanagan ecoregions;
however, we found no studies of RO fires in these ecore-
gions. Broader understanding of RO fire use for restor-
ation of Western forests requires additional work in
these understudied ecoregions.
Fine-scale structural effects
We found strong evidence that RO fires reduce tree
density, ladder fuels (small trees), canopy fuels, and
density of fire-intolerant species. Effects on tree density
and species composition were related to burn severity
and number of wildfire events. Several studies indicated
that RO fires had minimal effects on large and old trees,
but in areas where burn severity was high, loss of trees
of all sizes often led to stable shrublands or meadows.
More research and monitoring is needed to better
understand burn severity thresholds at which stand
density is reduced and composition is shifted toward
fire-tolerant species without undesirable effects on large
and old trees. Other understudied structural responses
include tree spatial patterns, and effects on large log
density and snags.
The limited number of studies we found related to RO
fire effects on understory communities showed mixed
results. Abundance and native species richness were
found to show a range of responses from increases to
decreases. Several studies indicated increases in nonna-
tive species such as cheatgrass, especially in areas of high
burn severity. These findings are not unexpected and
similar patterns are reported in the broader literature re-
lated to wildfire effects on understory communities
(Crawford et al. 2001; Floyd et al. 2006; Kuenzi et al.
2008). Although increasing understory diversity is often
a restoration objective, responses to changes in tree
density and fire can be complex and influenced by vari-
ous factors including burn severity, soil conditions, cli-
mate variability, herbivory, and plant functional traits
(Abella and Springer 2015). It has been suggested that
community trait characteristics that confer resilience to

anticipated
environmental
conditions
and
climate
change may be better restoration targets than increases
in overall plant abundance or species composition per se
(Laughlin et al. 2017). Research analyzing RO fire effects
on functional responses of understory communities
would be productive.
Restoration success
In several studies, tree density remained above HRV
even after repeated RO fires. Limited research suggested
that moderate burn severity in first-entry fires can ad-
equately reduce stand density and move forest condi-
tions within HRV (Huffman et al. 2017). However,
minor effects from low-severity burning, even after re-
peated fires, may not satisfactorily meet restoration ob-
jectives. These conclusions are difficult to reach in
studies utilizing unburned sites as a sole comparator, or
without interpretation that considers pre-fire-exclusion
conditions
or
desired
outcomes.
More
research
is
needed to evaluate RO fire effects against explicit and
well-articulated restoration objectives.
We found strong evidence to indicate that RO fires
may reduce subsequent fire size and severity, particularly
as compared with areas that have experienced no recent
fire. Studies indicated that effects were dependent on se-
verity of previous fires, forest type, and time since last
fire. Over time, areas with repeated RO fires may de-
velop fire regime characteristics such as frequency, ex-
tent, and severity that are similar to HRV. However,
results were mixed, and at least one study concluded
that some landscapes historically experienced more area
burned than that observed contemporarily. It should also
be noted that fire size and burn severity alone may be
poor indicators of restoration success. Rather than being
closely related to fuel loading and forest structural con-
ditions, low-severity fire may simply reflect mild weather
conditions and high fuel moistures under which RO fires
tend to be managed (Huffman et al. 2018).
On landscapes with longer histories of fire use, RO
fires can increase landscape heterogeneity with respect
to distribution of vegetation patches, and these changes
were related to burn severity, forest or vegetation type,
and physical setting. However, more research is needed
to determine whether mosaics produced by wildfire
events on landscapes altered by many years of fire exclu-
sion resemble historical patterns, and how these patterns
affect important ecological processes such as wildlife use
and movement, resilience to climate change, and wide-
spread
disturbances
such
as
insect
outbreaks
and
drought. Further, landscapes experiencing a long period
of fire use provide opportunities to test hypotheses re-
garding landscape dynamics and recovery from changes
related to historical fire exclusion. It is presently unclear
whether managers should consider such landscapes as
reference sites for restoration planning, and more work
could be done to compare patterns on fire-use land-
scapes with those where fire regimes have not been sub-
stantially disrupted. Lastly, our review identified research
and monitoring gaps related to effects of RO fires and
fire-use landscapes on wildlife habitat and ecological
functions such as soils and hydrologic responses.
