Science Delivery
Effective land management requires
understanding an ecosystem’s
vulnerability to climate change
impacts and the appropriate
management responses to these
threats.
 
The ERI hosted a workshop in March
2022 for the Coronado National
Forest, in partnership with USDA
Forest Service Region 3 and the
Western Wildland Environmental
Threat Assessment Center
(WWETAC).

Institutes
The Southwest Ecological Restoration Institutes (SWERI) include three
university-based institutes that work together to develop a program of applied
research and service to help create healthy forests, prevent wildﬁres, sustain
the resiliency of water supplies to wildﬁres, and create jobs.
