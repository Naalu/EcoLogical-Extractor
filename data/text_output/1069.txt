Accurate estimates of canopy base height (CBH) and canopy bulk density (CBD) are critical inputs for many fire 
modeling and simulation programs. Commonly used LANDFIRE estimates of CBH and CBD are only available at 
30 m resolution and have relatively low accuracy, and traditional field-based estimates can lead to inaccurate 
spatial estimates by assuming averages across spatial extents. Discrete-return airborne light detection and 
ranging (lidar) has become increasingly common in forestry applications, with demonstrated success in 
measuring canopy metrics and forest structure across broad landscapes and varied forest types. However, few 
studies have investigated the potential of airborne lidar for estimating these metrics in southwestern forests. This 
study developed an approach for estimating CBH and CBD using airborne lidar data and evaluated the accuracy 
of estimates at 20 m resolution. We also evaluated the predicted accuracy between managed and unmanaged 
forest stands. We employed a quantile-based method to derive CBH and utilized the Fire and Fuels Extension of 
the Forest Vegetation Simulator to estimate CBD from a lidar-derived tree list. Our results indicate that airborne 
lidar produced more accurate estimates of both CBH (R2 = 0.4; RMSE = 1.25 m) and CBD (R2 = 0.76; RMSE =
0.021 kg−3) as compared to LANDFIRE and other regional remote-sensing based estimates. We also report that 
airborne lidar is more accurate at estimating CBH in unmanaged stands versus managed stands, but CBD esti­
mates maintain similar accuracy regardless of management history. Compared to methods developed in other 
regions, our approach resulted in relatively low R2 values, but our RMSE values were found to be similar or 
slightly improved. Our approach for deriving both metrics are conceptually and computationally simple making 
them especially valuable for use by land managers and ecologists alike. This study provides clear evidence that 
airborne lidar can be used to derive broad-scale, fine-resolution fuel data layers, which are commonly required in 
fire modeling and forest management activities and decision-making.   
1. Introduction 
Over a century of land management practices, including fire sup­
pression, timber harvest, and overgrazing, have altered the structure, 
composition, and function of forested landscapes across the western 
United States (Moore et al., 2004; Lydersen et al., 2013). A distinct shift 
in structure has been documented in the ponderosa pine (Pinus ponder­
osa) forests of the Southwest, resulting in forests with accumulated 
surface and canopy fuel loads (Covington and Moore 1994; Covington 
et al., 1997). Current conditions, coupled with increasing global tem­
peratures and extended fire seasons, render these forests especially 
susceptible to high-severity, stand-replacing crown fires that are un­
characteristic of the historical fire regimes, yet increasing in frequency 
(Covington et al., 1997; Westerling et al., 2006; Poling 2016). These 
stand-replacing fires have negative impacts such as altering ecosystem 
function, increasing erosion, threatening the safety and infrastructure of 
wildland urban interface communities, and producing emissions harm­
ful to human health (Cannon and Reneau 2000; Hardy et al., 2001; 
Dombeck et al., 2004; Miller et al., 2009). 
In this modern era, fire managers increasingly rely on wildfire 
behavior modeling to assess the hazard of current conditions and make 
predictions about emissions and potential fire behavior (Andrews and 
Queen 2001; Arroyo et al., 2008). However, accurate predictions from 
models require accurate and spatially explicit canopy fuel data. Popular 
simulation software, such as FARSITE (Finney, 2004) and FlamMap 
(Finney, 2015) and current decision support systems like the Wildland

Fire Decision Support System (WFDSS) (McDaniels 2007) and the 
Interagency Fuels Treatment Decision Support System (IFTDSS) 
(Rauscher et al., 2009), require canopy base height (CBH) and canopy 
bulk density (CBD) estimates to predict fire initiation, growth, and 
propagation. While field-based methods have traditionally been used to 
estimate these metrics, such methods are time consuming, costly, and 
can lead to inaccurate spatial estimates by assuming averages across 
spatial extents (Andersen et al., 2005). LANDFIRE data, derived from 
satellite imagery and biophysical gradient data, provides spatially 
explicit, 30 m resolution CBH and CBD estimates across the entire United 
States and is commonly used for fire simulation applications (Rollins, 
2009). However, the coarse-resolution of LANDFIRE data limits its po­
tential in fine-scale fire simulations (Stratton, 2006), and the low ac­
curacy of CBH (correlation coefficient, or R2, = 0.32) and CBD (R2 =
0.58) estimates for forests in the Southwest reduces the reliability of 
modeling outputs (Reeves et al., 2009). 
Discrete-return airborne light detection and ranging, or lidar, is an 
active form of remote sensing that records the echo and frequency of a 
laser pulse emitted from an aircraft, producing a three-dimensional 
point cloud of forest vegetation. Lidar has emerged as a popular 
method for forestry applications (Akay et al., 2009) and is commonly 
used to estimate canopy metrics like CBH and CBD because of its unique 
ability to penetrate the canopy and provide sub-canopy information 
(Means et al., 2000; Lim et al., 2003). Furthermore, airborne lidar data 
has been used to characterize tree-level forest structure over large areas 
(Kane et al., 2013), and individual-tree segmentation methods are 
increasingly being used to characterize detailed forest structure and 
canopy metrics (Jeronimo et al., 2018) at multiple scales (Wasserman 
et al., 2019). 
Many studies that assess the accuracy of airborne lidar at estimating 
canopy fuel loads use an area-based method, in which plot level metrics 
derived from an airborne lidar point cloud are used to develop statistical 
models using regression techniques (White et al., 2013). Andersen et al. 
(2005) used an area-based method to estimate CBH and CBD in a 
Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and western hemlock (Tsuga hetero­
phylla) forest in Washington. Their CBH model had an R2 of 0.77 and a 
root mean squared error (RMSE) of 3.9 m, and their CBD model had an 
R2 of 0.84 and RMSE of 0.27 kg m−3, indicating a relatively strong 
predicting capability of airborne lidar. Another study combined area- 
based lidar metrics and color infrared imagery to predict plot-level 
CBH and CBD in a ponderosa pine and dry mixed-conifer forest in 
eastern Washington, obtaining a high R2 of 0.94 and low RMSE of 1.44 
m for CBH and a high R2 of 0.83 and relatively low RMSE of 0.024 kg 
m−3 for CBD (Erdody and Moskal 2010). Hall et al. (2005) also used an 
area-based method to predict CBH and CBD in a ponderosa pine forest in 
Colorado’s Front Range using airborne lidar, and obtained an R2 of 0.80 
and standard error of 0.36 m for CBH and an R2 of 0.83 and standard 
error of 0.32 kg m−3 for CBD. 
Other studies have used an individual-tree segmentation method to 
estimate forest metrics, whereby trees are segmented from the airborne 
lidar point cloud, and analysis is conducted on a tree by tree basis. Luo 
et al. (2018) developed a method using reflection point detection to 
estimate individual tree CBH in a mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra 
Nevada, resulting in an R2 of 0.88 and RMSE of 1.62 m. Another study by 
Solberg et al. (2006) used an individual-tree segmentation method to 
compare field- and lidar-derived estimates of tree height, crown width, 
and CBH in a Norway spruce (Picea abies) forest, finding an R2 of 0.45 
and an RMSE of 3.5 m for CBH. In this study, deciles were calculated 
from each tree’s height distribution and CBH was estimated as the decile 
with the greatest distance from the previous decile. 
To our knowledge, the only study that has assessed the accuracy of 
airborne lidar at predicting CBH and CBD in southwestern forests used 
an area-based method in a dry mixed-conifer forest in the Pinaleno 
Mountains in southeastern Arizona. The study found a modest R2 of 0.49 
and high RMSE of 6.2 m for CBH, and an even weaker model for CBD 
with an R2 of 0.37 and RMSE of 0.026 kg m−3 (Mitchell et al., 2012). 
Shin et al. (2018) also attempted to estimate CBH and CBD in northern 
Arizona forests, but they used imagery from an unmanned aerial vehicle 
(UAV) instead of lidar, and found a low R2 of 0.4 and RMSE of 2.52 m for 
CBH and no reliable correlation for CBD estimates. 
The demand for accurate, extensive, and fine-resolution estimates of 
CBH and CBD for forests across the Southwest is evident, however lidar- 
based methods for estimating these metrics have not been thoroughly 
explored in this region, and current LANDFIRE estimates are limited by 
their low resolution and poor accuracy. Since extensive, high-quality 
airborne lidar data exists for much of the forested landscapes of the 
Southwest (Office for Coastal Management, 2020), demonstrating the 
potential utility of this data to forest managers is critical. While various 
approaches for estimating CBH and CBD from lidar data have been 
documented in other regions, to our knowledge a concise approach for 
estimating these metrics and a validation of their accuracy has yet to be 
reported for southwestern forests. In this research, we sought to fill this 
gap in knowledge by meeting the following four objectives: 1) develop 
an approach for deriving plot-level CBH and CBD metrics from lidar 
data, 2) validate and assess our approach using an independent dataset, 
3) determine how the accuracy of estimates differs between managed 
and unmanaged forests, and 4) compare results with other studies from 
different regions with similar forest types. 
2. Methods 
2.1. Study sites 
Our study sites were located on the Fort Valley Experimental Forest 
and the Centennial Forest which are about 15 km northwest and 10 km 
west of Flagstaff, AZ, respectively. Both sites consist of level to slightly 
rolling terrain, with well-drained volcanic soils (Covington et al., 1997). 
The climate of the area is sub-humid, receiving 57 cm of mean annual 
precipitation (Ful´e et al., 2001). Overstory vegetation across the study 
site is exclusively ponderosa pine and understory vegetation consist of 
various perennial grasses and forbs (Mast et al., 1999) and some oc­
currences of Gambel oak (quercus gambelii) at the Centennial Forest site. 
Restoration treatments were applied to portions of both sites between 
1998 and 2000 as part of Northern Arizona University’s Ecological 
Restoration Institute’s Long-term Ecological Assessment and Restoration 
Network or LEARN (ERI 2020), in collaboration with the USDA Forest 
Service’s Rocky Mountain Research Station, the Coconino National 
Forest, and the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management. 
Treatments were based on residual tree density targets guided by pre- 
settlement (circa 1876) evidences (logs, stumps, and snags pre- 
settlement in origin), and generally ranged from dense forest in the 
control to less dense in the restoration stands (Ful´e et al., 2001). Gaylord 
et al. (2010), report similar mean tree densities (1912 and 756 trees per 
hectare), basal area (37.0 and 36.9 m2/ha), and mean tree sizes (17.1 
and 22.2 cm) for untreated conditions at nearby (within 2.5 km of each 
site) experiments at both Fort Valley and Centennial Forest (respec­
tively) and Van Horne and Ful´e (2006) report similar fire histories and 
fire exclusions dates (1876 for Fort Valley and 1881 for Centennial 
Forest). At Fort Valley, three study blocks were designated for treat­
ment, each containing four, ~14 ha treatment units, or stands, in which 
one of four treatments was randomly applied (including a control). 
Similarly, at the Centennial Forest site, two study blocks were desig­
nated for treatment, each containing two, ~10 ha treatment units, or 
stands, in which one of two treatments was randomly applied (including 
a control). Our study specifically focused on the control (hereafter un­
managed) and the full restoration (hereafter managed) stands, since 
these conditions are representative of much of the forested landscapes in 
the region. This selection resulted in a total of 6 stands at Fort Valley and 
two stands at Centennial Forest, with an even representation of managed 
and unmanaged stands (Fig. 1). We used previously established plot 
locations in each stand (initially based on a systematic random sampling 
design) resulting in a total of 120 plots at Fort Valley and 40 plots at

Centennial Forest, the latter of which acted as our independent valida­
tion site. The selected stands represent a range of forest structure con­
ditions, as demonstrated by the airborne lidar-derived summary metrics 
in Fig. 2. 
2.2. Field surveys 
At each established plot location in both the study area and the 
validation site, we established fixed-area, 0.04 ha circular plots. For all 
overstory trees (trees > 1.37 m) within each plot, we recorded species, 
diameter at breast height (DBH), total tree height, and individual tree 
crown base height (defined as the lowest live branch of each tree). Total 
tree height and individual tree crown base height were measured with 
the Hagl¨of Vertex IV Digital Hypsometer. The spatial position of each 
plot location was recorded using a Trimble Geo 7X H-Star receiver, 
which was post-processed through differential correction using data 
from local base stations, resulting in sub-meter plot location accuracy. 
Field data from the study area and validation site was ultimately 
compiled into a tree list containing total tree height, DBH, and CBH 
values for each tree within each plot. 
2.3. Airborne lidar data 
The airborne lidar data used in this study was collected via aircraft 
on October 16, 2017 and the lidar acquisition covered an area of the 
Coconino National Forest 89.7 km2 in size with an average point density 
between 8 and 12 points m−2 (Donager, 2018). An overview of the lidar 
data analysis and comparison of CBH and CBD values is shown in Fig. 3. 
2.4. Lidar data analysis 
We utilized existing techniques reported in the literature to create 
lidar-derived tree lists for each of the 120 plots in our study area. First, 
we processed the airborne lidar data using the lidR package (version 
2.1.4; Roussel and Auty 2019) within the R environment (version 3.6.2; 
R Core Team, 2019). Initially, we imported LAS (American Society for 
Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 2019) files already clipped to 
each stand boundary and normalized (i.e., subtracting the ground 
elevation from individual points converting to height above the ground) 
and removed ground points from the point cloud. We then used the Li 
et al. (2012) algorithm to segment trees across each stand, using default 
parameters for the algorithm. Based on the location of our field plots, we 
then clipped the segmented trees to our 0.04 ha plot boundaries. For 
each tree within each plot, we derived estimates of individual tree crown 
base height, total tree height, and DBH. We used a method similar to 
Solberg et al. (2006) to estimate individual tree crown base height, in 
which 5% quantile values were calculated from height values within 
each tree’s point cloud. Using the difference between each quantile 
value, we estimated individual tree crown base height as the upper 
quantile value where the greatest difference was found (Fig. 4). We 
tested several quantile increment values, including 1%, 3%, 5%, and 
10%, but ultimately selected an increment of 5% since it proved most 
accurate. Total tree height was derived as the maximum height value 
within each tree’s point cloud, and DBH was imputed from height using 
nonlinear (weighted) least-squares regression via maximum likelihood 
using a power function and our field data (Fig. 5). The resulting model fit 
exhibited approximately normal residuals and homoscedasticity, and 
thus the following equation (Eq. (1)) (n = 2755, SEresid = 2.601, R2 =
0.8896) was used to impute individual tree DBH: 
DBH = 1.6*height0.71
(1) 
In the above equation, height represents the maximum height value 
within each tree’s point cloud. The above process resulted in a lidar- 
derived tree list for each of the 120 plots within our study area. 
2.5. Calculating Plot-level CBH and CBD 
We calculated plot-level CBH and CBD from the field- and lidar- 
derived tree lists for each of the 120 plots in our study area. To calcu­
late plot-level CBH, we found the mean of individual tree crown base 
heights for each plot. To calculate plot-level CBD, we used the Fire and 
Fuels Extension of the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS-FFE), since this 
software is commonly used by land managers (Crookston and Dixon 
2005). FVS-FFE requires estimates of DBH, tree height, and crown ratio 
(derived from tree height and individual tree crown base height). From 
these estimates, crown fuel weight is calculated for each tree and sum­
med into 0.3 m horizontal layers for each plot. FVS-FFE then calculates 
plot-level CBD as the maximum of a 4.5 m running mean of the 0.3 m 
deep layers (Scott and Reinhardt 2001; Reinhardt and Crookston 2003). 
This method of calculating CBD does not necessarily equate to canopy 
mass divided by canopy depth, rather it estimates the effective density of 
the canopy by assuming a non-uniform distribution of canopy mass 
(Scott and Reinhardt 2001). Lastly, if bias was relatively high, lidar- 
derived plot-level estimates were corrected by regressing the resulting 
predictions errors against the lidar-derived estimates using simple or­
dinary least-squares regression to provide bias corrected estimates.

2.6. Field vs. Lidar canopy metric comparisons 
Within our study area, we compared field- and lidar-derived esti­
mates of CBH and CBD between all plots, and between the managed and 
unmanaged plots independently. For each comparison, we examined R2 
(Eq. (2)), RMSE (Eq. (3)), and bias (Eq. (4)) to determine the accuracy of 
our estimates. We used the following equation forms: 
R2 = 1 −

In the above equations, n represents the number of plots, xi repre­
sents the ith field-derived estimate, yi represents the ith lidar-derived 
estimates, and xm is the mean of field-derived estimates. 
2.7. Independent validation 
We performed an independent validation using the Centennial Forest 
stands to assess the accuracy of our approach with an independent 
dataset. We followed the same procedure to create lidar- and field- 
derived tree lists for each of the 40 plots within our validation site. 
We then calculated plot level estimates of CBH and CBD from both the 
field and lidar tree lists, and examined R2, RMSE, and bias to assess 
accuracy. Due to the limited sample size at our validation site, we did 
not 
compare 
estimates 
for 
managed 
and 
unmanaged 
plots 
independently. 
3. Results 
3.1. Canopy base height 
Comparison of CBH between lidar- and field-derived estimates for all 
120 plots in the study area are shown in Fig. 6. We obtained an R2 of 
0.64, RMSE of 1.66 m, and low bias of 0.47 for this comparison, indi­
cating relatively strong agreement between lidar- and field-derived es­
timates of CBH (Fig. 6). No bias correction was undertaken for CBH 
predictions considering the low bias. 
For the 120 plots in the study area, we also compared CBH between 
lidar- and field-derived estimates for the managed and unmanaged plots 
independently, as shown in Fig. 7. For the managed plots, we obtained 
an R2 of 0.57, RMSE of 1.79 m, and bias of 0.92. For the unmanaged 
plots, we obtained an R2 of 0.69, RMSE of 1.53 m, and bias of 0.09. 
These comparisons indicated strong agreements between lidar- and 
field-derived estimates of CBH in unmanaged plots, with a somewhat

weaker accord and a higher positive bias in the managed plots (Fig. 7). 
3.2. Canopy bulk density 
Initial comparisons between lidar- and field-derived CBD revealed a 
negative, linearly increasing prediction bias with model fit statistics 
obtained as R2 of 0.68, RMSE of 0.034 kg m−3, and relatively high bias of 
−0.027. 
Following bias correction, we obtained an R2 of 0.68, RMSE of 0.017 
kg m−3, and bias of 0.000002 for this comparison, indicating a strong 
correlation between lidar- and field-derived estimates of CBD. Bias- 
corrected estimates of CBD for all 120 plots in the study area are 
shown in Fig. 8. 
For the 120 plots in the study area, we also compared CBD between 
bias corrected lidar- and field-derived estimates for the managed and 
unmanaged stands independently, as shown in Fig. 9. In the managed 
plots, we obtained an R2 of 0.48, RMSE of 0.015 kg m−3, and bias of 
0.008. In the unmanaged plots, we obtained an R2 of 0.49, RMSE of 
0.018 kg m−3, and bias of −0.007. These comparisons indicated a 
weaker match and higher bias for comparisons of bias corrected lidar- 
and field-derived estimates when the managed and unmanaged plots 
were viewed independently (Fig. 9). 
3.3. Independent validation 
Comparison of lidar- and field-derived estimates of CBH for all 40 
plots in the validation site are shown in Fig. 10. We obtained an R2 value 
of 0.4, RMSE of 1.25, and bias of −0.12, suggesting a somewhat weak

agreement but with high accuracy and low bias for comparisons be­
tween lidar- and field-derived estimates in the validation site (Fig. 10). 
Comparison of bias corrected lidar- and field-derived estimates of 
CBD for all 40 plots in the validation site are shown in Fig. 11. We ob­
tained an R2 value of 0.76, RMSE of 0.021, and bias of −0.013, sug­
gesting a strong correlation with a small negative bias in higher density 
plots (Fig. 11). 
3.4. Comparisons to other studies 
We compared the accuracy of our CBH estimates from our validation 
site to results from studies conducted in different regions with similar 
forest types, as shown in Table 1. We selected studies for comparison 
that 1) used both area-based and individual-tree segmentation-based 
methods and 2) only used discrete-return airborne lidar data. High R2 
values of 0.77 (Andersen et al., 2005) and 0.80 Hall et al., 2005) were 
found from the area-based models but RMSE values ranged from 0.36 m 
(Hall et al., 2005) to 3.9 m (Andersen et al., 2005). From the individual- 
tree segmentation-based models, R2 values ranged from 0.45 (Solberg 
et al., 2006) to 0.88 (Luo et al., 2018) and RMSE values ranged from 
1.62 m (Luo et al., 2018) to 3.5 m (Solberg et al., 2006). For our vali­
dation site, we obtained an R2 value of 0.4, which was low compared to 
other area-based models, but similar to individual tree detection-based 
models, and our RMSE value of 1.25 m was low compared to all other 
models (Table 1). 
We also compared the accuracy of our CBD estimates from our 
validation site to results from studies conducted in different regions with 
similar forest types, as shown in Table 2. We only selected studies for 
comparison that used discrete-return airborne lidar data and area-based 
methods. High R2 values between 0.83 (Hall et al., 2005) and 0.88 
(Erdody and Moskal 2010), and relatively low RMSE values between 
0.024 kg m−3 (Erdody and Moskal 2010) and 0.32 kg m−3 (Hall et al., 
2005) were found from other studies. In our study we obtained an R2 
value of 0.76 which was somewhat lower compared to other studies, but 
our RMSE value of 0.021 kg m−3 was the lowest of all studies used in the 
comparison. 
4. Discussion 
With the increasing frequency of uncharacteristic wildfires in 
southwestern forests, land managers continue to rely on outputs from 
fire simulation software to support critical decision making that protects 
human safety, infrastructure, and ecosystem services. However, to 
improve the precision and reliability of fire simulation outputs, exten­
sive, fine-resolution, and accurate forest fuel data layers are necessary. 
To meet this demand, we developed an airborne lidar-based approach 
for predicting CBH and CBD at fine resolutions (e.g., 0.04 ha) and across 
large spatial extents (e.g., 40,000 ha) in southwestern ponderosa pine 
forests. We also validated the accuracy of our approach with an inde­
pendent dataset, assessed the strength of our approach across different 
forest conditions (i.e. managed and unmanaged forests), and compared

RMSE, low bias, and relatively high R2 suggested a strong agreement between 
lidar- and field-derived estimates of CBH. (For interpretation of the references

our results to the findings from similar studies conducted in different 
regions across the western US. 
We developed a relatively simple approach for deriving plot-level 
estimates of CBH and CBD from lidar data. Our approach utilized 
individual-tree detection methods to produce tree lists for each plot, 
which were then scaled up to reach plot-level estimates. Results from 
our approach showed an improvement in accuracy and resolution over 
LANDFIRE estimates of CBH and CBD. Our validation site R2 values of 
0.4 for CBH and 0.76 for CBD indicated a stronger correlation between 
lidar- and field-derived estimates than LANDFIRE estimates, which have 
an R2 of 0.32 for CBH and 0.58 for CBD (Reeves et al., 2009). Addi­
tionally, LANDFIRE data is limited to a 30 m resolution, whereas our 
estimates provide additional detail at a 20 m resolution. 
Our approach also resulted in similar or higher R2 compared to other 
regional approaches, including the area-based airborne lidar-based 
models produced by Mitchell et al. (2012) (R2 of 0.37) and the UAV- 
based model developed by Shin et al. (2018) (R2 of 0.40). Our RMSE 
values for both CBH and CBD were also higher compared to those pro­
duced from area-based models developed by Mitchell et al. (2012) (CBH 
model RMSE of 6.2 m; CBD model RMSE of 0.026 kg m−3). RMSE values 
provide a description of the expected error in a prediction. Our results 
indicated that our CBH and CBD predictions over- or under-estimated by 
1.25 m and 0.021 kg m−3, respectively. In practice, these values are 
relatively low, especially compared to the values reported in previous 
studies in Arizona (e.g., Mitchell et al., 2012, Shin et al., 2018). 
We reported low positive bias of 0.47 for our study site CBH esti­
mates indicating no consistent directionality in our observed error. 
Thus, we concluded that our approach consistently provided suitable 
estimates of CBH and did not necessitate bias correction. For CBD 
however, our approach produced relatively high bias prior to applying 
our bias correction equation, indicating that lidar consistently under­
estimated CBD values. Several explanations may exist for this observed

bias. It is most likely that the underestimated CBD values were the result 
of the lower total tree counts obtained from the lidar tree-segmentation 
process. Our lidar-derived tree lists had, on average, one third of the 
trees as reported in their associated field-derived tree lists. This under- 
segmentation was expected, as it is well-documented in the literature 
that lidar tree-segmentation algorithms are often unable to detect sub­
ordinate trees that grow under the canopy of larger trees (Maltamo et al., 
2009; Lamb et al., 2017; North et al., 2017; Jeronimo et al., 2018). For 
example, Klauberg et al. (2019) found that lidar under-segmented trees 
by about one third, with an increased discrepancy in unmanaged forest 
stands. With only one third of the trees, less canopy mass is estimated by 
FVS-FFE, and thus lower CBD values are reported. This issue of 
under-segmentation is the most likely cause of the high negative bias 
initially observed in our lidar-derived CBD estimates. 
Our independent validation of our approach for estimating CBH and 
CBD suggested that our methods can be utilized in different forest stands 
and produce estimates with similar accuracy. For CBH, while we ob­
tained a lower R2 of 0.4 in the validation, this only indicated that there 
was weaker correlation between lidar- and field-derived estimates. The 
lower RMSE of 1.25 m and the similarly low bias of −0.12 resulting from 
the independent validation indicated that our approach produced 
consistently reliable estimates of CBH in these forest types. Clearly, more 
work is needed across a larger geographic range and with a larger 
dataset to determine if the bias observed in the uncorrected CBH 
approach is a function of the selected approach, the tree segmentation of 
the lidar, or just a characteristic of our data. For CBD, we obtained a 
higher R2 in the validation, indicating a stronger correlation between 
lidar- and field derived estimates, and the RMSE value suggests decent 
accuracy. The relatively low negative bias of −0.013 for our CBD esti­
mates suggests that our approach for bias correction effectively reduced 
bias in the case of CBD (no correction as needed for CBH) despite being 
applied in different forest stands. However, the systematic nature of the 
bias observed in the validation site (higher values being underestimated 
more) suggests that a different cause of bias may be at play. 
Our results suggested that airborne lidar provide improved pre­
dictions of CBH in our unmanaged plots compared to our managed plots. 
These results were not anticipated, since the unmanaged plots have 
higher canopy cover and airborne lidar has been shown to produce 
increased error in these conditions (Andersen et al., 2005; Erdody and 
Moskal 2010; Klauberg et al., 2019). Several possible reasons for this 
observation exist. First, it is possible that the increased number of trees 
per plot in the unmanaged areas may have had a smoothing effect on the 
mean estimates (since a larger sample size reduces the influence of any 
individual outlier) thereby improving our prediction for unmanaged 
plots. Additionally, since some of the plots in the managed areas had 
only one or two trees per plot, it is possible that the scale of sampling 
(0.04 ha) may have driven the increased inaccuracy. For example, if our 
algorithm predicted incorrectly for one tree, then the estimate for that 
entire plot was incorrect. Lastly, from an ecological perspective, it is 
possible that trees in the unmanaged plots exhibited more uniform 
crown lift, which is common in dense forest stands where competition is 
higher due to limited resource availability. Conversely, in the managed 
areas, access to plentiful resources may have led to more variable crown 
lift, making estimates of CBH in those plots less reliable and ultimately 
leading to the observed discrepancy between lidar- and field-derived 
estimates. 
Our results suggested that the accuracy of CBD estimates did not 
change considerably between managed and unmanaged plots, since R2 
and RMSE values were similar. However, in the managed plots the bias 
of our estimates was slightly positive whereas in the unmanaged plots 
the bias was slightly negative. This observation was most likely the 
result of the Li et al. (2012) algorithm under-segmenting trees in the 
control plots, which is more common in dense forest conditions where 
many subordinate, lower canopy trees exist. This under-segmentation 
likely led to the under-estimated lidar-derived CBD estimates, repre­
sented by the positive bias. 
When comparing results from our validation site to studies con­
ducted in different regions with similar forest types, our results indi­
cated somewhat lower R2 values, but the RMSE values for our CBH and 
CBD predictions were lower compared to those reported by others. 
Although the area-based approach used in studies in other regions re­
ported generally higher R2 values, the results from Mitchell et al. (2012) 
indicate that an area-based approach may not perform well for forests in 
the Southwest. Additionally, when we compared our CBH approach to 
others using individual-tree detection, our results indicated similar R2 
and RMSE values (Solberg et al., 2006; Luo et al., 2018), suggesting that 
an individual-tree segmentation approach is perhaps best for predicting 
CBH and CBD in open, conifer-dominated systems. 
Differences between airborne lidar predicting capabilities among 
different regions could also be the result of differences in the consistency 
of forest structure between different regions. For example, approaches 
developed in the highly productive forests of the Pacific Northwest 
(Andersen et al., 2005; Erdody and Moskal 2010) may show improved 
accuracy because forest canopies develop in more consistent patterns 
where resources are not as limited. On the other hand, in the degraded 
and less-productive forests of Colorado’s Front Range (Hall et al., 2005) 
and in the Southwest (Mitchell et al., 2012) canopy structure is more 
variable and thus predictions are less reliable. 
While our lidar-derived estimates of CBH and CBD may be somewhat 
less accurate than other studies, our approach has the added benefits of 
requiring only lidar data and being relatively simple to implement. The 
Li et al. (2012) algorithm that we used to segment trees was easy to 
apply using the lidR package (version 2.1.4; Roussel and Auty 2019) in 
the R environment. Derivation of plot-level tree lists only required 
estimating quantile values, and maximum values for each tree. While 
iterations of this step for all trees in a plot required some knowledge of R 
programing, it was conceptually simple. The conceptual and

computational simplicity of this approach makes it especially suitable 
for use by land managers. Land managers may not always have the time 
or resources necessary to learn and implement some of the more com­
plex methods, which often require calculation of several lidar metrics 
(Andersen et al., 2005), the use of multivariate regression equations 
(Hall et al., 2005), or the additional processing of satellite or aerial 
imagery (Erdody and Moskal 2010). 
With airborne lidar data becoming widely available, the approach 
developed in this study can be implemented over large areas, providing 
reliable estimates of CBH and CBD for use in fire behavior modeling or 
other endeavors requiring canopy attribute estimates. Automation of 
this approach easily enabled the creation of 20 m resolution raster data 
layers of CBH and CBD across large landscapes of the ponderosa pine 
forest of the Southwest. Since our approach showed an improvement in 
accuracy over LANDFIRE and other previously developed models for 
estimating CBH and CBD (Reeves et al., 2009; Mitchell et al., 2012; Shin 
et al., 2018), airborne lidar may represent the missing tool needed for 
developing accurate, fine-resolution, and extensive data layers for use in 
fire simulations. Additionally, a study conducted by Kelly et al. (2018) 
found that typical error associated with lidar-derived estimates of CBH 
have a minimal influence on the outcome of fire behavior simulations. 
Thus, while lidar-derived data layers may exhibit inherent error, they 
still provide suitable fire simulation inputs which ultimately assist land 
managers in making more informed decisions related to wildfire initi­
ation, propagation, and growth. 
5. Conclusion 
Results from this study indicate that discrete-return airborne lidar is 
capable of estimating CBH and CBD with reasonable accuracy in the 
ponderosa pine forests of the southwestern United States. The methods 
developed and implemented in this study provides a conceptually and 
computationally simple approach for deriving these metrics, making it 
potentially useful for a wide variety of applications. Additional valida­
tion studies are needed to further assess the accuracy of this approach in 
other forest types common in the western United States, such as mixed- 
conifer and pine-oak woodlands. Future applications could use this 
method to develop landscape-scale, canopy fuel data layers, which could 
then be used to more accurately assess potential fire behavior via 
simulation.
