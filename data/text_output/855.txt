Although development of pinyon–juniper woodlands is understood to require decades after stand-replac-
ing ﬁre, data describing relationships between many key structural elements and time since ﬁre (TSF) are
lacking. In this study, we sampled live trees, seedlings, shrubs, snags, and downed logs on 13 sites that
together comprised a 370-year ﬁre chronosequence. We analyzed individual relationships between struc-
tural attributes and TSF. We also developed an additive index of structural complexity and analyzed its
relationship with TSF. Live juniper and total tree density were positively and linearly related to TSF
(R2 = 0.76 and 0.49, respectively). Pinyon tree density and TSF were not signiﬁcantly related. No live trees
(P1.37 m height) were found on sites burned less than 30 years before sampling, although seedlings
were found as early as 6 years TSF. Live pinyon tree biomass, live juniper biomass, and total tree biomass
followed ‘‘s-shaped’’ functions (4-parameter Weibull; R2 = 0.32, 0.62, and 0.96, respectively), with total
biomass maximizing at 65 Mg ha1 around 250 years since ﬁre. Seedling densities and shrub cover were
not signiﬁcantly related to TSF. Juniper snag density showed a signiﬁcant negative relationship with TSF
(R2 = 0.54) and total snag density followed a ‘‘u-shaped’’ function depending on TSF (2nd-order polyno-
mial; R2 = 0.47). Pinyon snag density and TSF were not signiﬁcantly related. Density of rotten logs was
positively and linearly related to TSF (R2 = 0.46) whereas sound logs and TSF were not statistically related.
Structural complexity showed a positive linear relationship with TSF (R2 = 0.46). These results indicate
that although individual structural elements show various relationships with TSF, structural complexity
increases as sites approach persistent woodland conditions. Findings from this study provide resource
professionals with information that can help in developing and assessing management approaches
intended to emulate natural structural patterns.

1. Introduction
Pinyon–juniper ecosystems occur on approximately 20 million
hectares across the semi-arid landscapes of the western United
States. In the American Southwest, these systems are commonly
dominated by mixed stands of Colorado pinyon (Pinus edulis), Utah
juniper (Juniperus osteosperma), and/or one-seed juniper (Juniperus
monosperma) (West, 1999). Sites range in structure from open sav-
annas of scattered trees and herbaceous-shrubby understories, to
persistent woodlands with higher tree density and canopy closure
(Brown, 1994; Romme et al., 2009). Woodlands commonly occur
on sites where climatic, topographic, or edaphic factors constrain
abundance and continuity of ﬁne surface fuels, which in turn limits
spread of low-severity surface ﬁre (Floyd et al., 2000; Romme et al.,
2003; Huffman et al., 2008). Infrequent, stand-replacing ﬁres char-
acterize both historical and modern ﬁre regimes in southwestern
pinyon–juniper woodlands (Baker and Shinneman, 2004; Floyd
et al., 2004; Huffman et al., 2008; Romme et al., 2009). Fires in
these systems are typically wind-driven events that occur under
hot, dry weather conditions and result in death of most or all trees
on extents that range from small groups of trees to patches hun-
dreds of hectares in size (Floyd et al., 2004; Huffman et al., 2008).
Previous studies of long-term post-ﬁre responses have focused
on successional dynamics. During the initial years of community
reorganization, burned areas are often dominated by annual and
perennial grasses, forbs, and sprouting shrubs (Arnold et al.,
1964; Barney and Frischknecht, 1974; Floyd et al., 2000). Tree
recruitment following severe ﬁre may proceed over many decades
to centuries (Erdman, 1970; Wright et al., 1979; Tress and Klopa-
tek, 1987). Few details are available, however, concerning dynam-
ics of important structural elements that, in addition to live
vegetation, include coarse woody material such as standing dead
trees (snags) and downed logs. Coarse wood plays numerous eco-
logical roles related to plant regeneration, wildlife habitat, nutrient
cycling, and carbon dynamics (Harmon et al., 1986). Understanding
dynamics of structural attributes is essential as these elements
both inﬂuence, and are a result of, ecological processes and func-
tions (Franklin et al., 2002). Of the factors that are likely to inﬂu-
ence structural patterns in pinyon–juniper woodlands, time since

major disturbance is likely to be a key determinant. In turn, knowl-
edge of long-term structural patterns allows land managers to for-
mulate treatment strategies that emulate natural processes. Such
strategies are more likely to be successful at restoring habitat for
forest biota and conserving other elements of biodiversity than
those that impose novel structural patterns or processes (Linden-
mayer et al., 2006).
In this study, we analyzed relationships between structural
attributes and time since ﬁre (TSF) on pinyon–juniper sites that to-
gether comprised a 370-year ﬁre chronosequence in northern
Arizona. Our main research questions were: (1) How do quantities
and qualities of key structural elements, including live trees,
change as a function of TSF? and, (2) Does structural complexity in-
crease with TSF as sites approach woodland conditions? In order to
answer these questions, we sampled live trees, seedlings, snags,
downed logs, and shrubs within 13 sites that comprised the ﬁre
chronosequence. Although we acknowledged that numerous fac-
tors may affect long-term patterns of structural development, we
were speciﬁcally interested in testing the importance of TSF.
2. Methods
2.1. Study sites
We sampled structural characteristics on 13 sites representing a
chronosequence of severe wildﬁres in pinyon–juniper woodlands
in northern Arizona (Table 1). Sites were located on the Flagstaff
Ranger District of the Coconino National Forest (CF) (seven sites)
and the Tusayan Ranger District of the Kaibab National Forest
(KF) (six sites) (Fig. 1). We included ﬁres in our study if they met
the following criteria: (1) site experienced high-severity, stand-
replacing ﬁre with 100% tree mortality P20 ha in extent; (2) P.
edulis, J. osteosperma, and/or J. monosperma were listed as major
compositional components in Terrestrial Ecosystem Survey for
the site (USDA, 1991, 1995); (3) soils were derived from sedimen-
tary parent material; and (4) site showed minimal evidence of
anthropogenic disturbances such as fuelwood cutting. Nine ﬁre
sites were identiﬁed using a number of information sources. For
example, US Forest Service geographic databases were used to
identify ﬁres that occurred from 1960 to 2004 (i.e., JF, GF, LIZ,
and YJ). For these ﬁres, databases provided precise locations in
terms of points or polygons, ﬁre sizes, and ﬁre dates (month and
year). Two ﬁres (AF and DIL) were previously described in pub-
lished literature (Arnold et al., 1964; Tress and Klopatek, 1987).
The DIL site was located through personal communication with
Dr. Jeffrey Klopatek (Arizona State University). An aerial photo-
graph presented in Arnold et al. (1964) allowed us to locate the
AF site. Once located, perimeters of these ﬁres were clearly distin-
guishable on digital satellite imagery (Landsat). We located the CF
site after examining photographs archived at the US Forest Service,
Rocky Mountain Research Station in Flagstaff, Arizona. We subse-
quently conﬁrmed the location of the disturbance through ﬁeld
reconnaissance. The remaining ﬁre sites (RBW, and RBE) were
found by studying digital imagery of areas near the DIL site and
conﬁrming through ﬁeld reconnaissance. We mapped perimeters
of these older ﬁre sites using boundaries of landscape ﬁre scars vis-
ible on digital images. Thus, ﬁre sizes we report for these sites are
likely underestimates.
In addition, we sampled four relatively undisturbed woodland
sites that were located near the ﬁre sites. These woodland sites
met species composition and soils criteria and were similar to
the ﬁre sites in terms of other conditions such as slope and topog-
raphy. However, the undisturbed sites lacked clear evidence of his-
torical stand-replacing ﬁre that may have occurred within the last
100 years; in this sense, the sites showed persistent woodland con-
ditions (sensu Romme et al., 2009). Although we could not discern
stand-level ﬁre evidence such as extensive areas of charred snags
and stumps, we understood that severe ﬁres were part of the his-
torical disturbance regime of pinyon–juniper woodlands on these
landscapes (Leiberg et al., 1904; Drake, 1910; Phillips and Mulford,
1912). We therefore accepted that these sites may have experi-
enced signiﬁcant ﬁres at some more distant point in time. We as-
sumed
that
the
undisturbed
sites
represented
structural
conditions that may develop after more than a century since major
ﬁre disturbance.
Study sites all fell within the Great Basin Conifer Woodland bio-
tic community described by Brown (1994). Annual precipitation at
the sites averages around 320–460 mm (USDA Forest Service,
1991, 1995) (Table 1) and is characterized by bimodal seasonal dis-
tribution, with roughly half the annual total falling in winter as
snow and the other half in summer as monsoonal rains. Although
annual precipitation in the semi-arid Southwest is variable, at least
one notable drought occurred in 2002, after which die-back in pin-
yon pine tree populations was substantial (Breshears et al., 2005).
Average maximum and minimum temperatures are 29.3 and
7.3 C, respectively (WRCC, 2010). Soils at the sites are mainly
shallow-moderately deep, lithic and calcic Ustochrepts, derived
from limestone and sandstone parent material; soils at one site
were classiﬁed as Halplustalfs.
2.2. Field sampling
Sites were sampled May through July in 2007 and 2010

sampled in 2007 with the exception of YJC and CFC; only three
plots were sampled at these sites due to the relatively small
amount of area undisturbed by woodcutting. Five sample plots
were established on sites sampled in 2010. Plots were randomly
selected from 200  200-m point grids generated using a geo-
graphic information system (GIS). Sampling grids were overlaid
within ﬁre perimeters and points were at least 50 m from the ﬁre
edge. Selected points were located in the ﬁeld using global posi-
tioning systems and served as centers for 0.25-ha (50  50 m) sam-
ple plots. Plot dimensions were slope-corrected in the ﬁeld.
On each plot, we measured all live trees and dead tree struc-
tures. We deﬁned ‘‘trees’’ as pinyon or juniper individuals that
had attained heights of greater than 1.37 m. We recorded species
and condition, and measured diameter (taken at root collar
(DRC)) of all trees. We used the classiﬁcation system described in
Thomas et al. (1979) to record tree condition. Trees were classiﬁed
as follows: (1) live; (2) fading; (3) recent snag; (4) loose-bark snag;
(5) clean bark snag; (6) snag broken above 1.37 m from ground le-
vel; (7) broken below 1.37 m; (8) log; and (9) cut stump. We also
examined each tree structure for evidence of ﬁre (e.g., presence
of char). For trees in condition classes 1–6, we measured total
height using Häglof Vertex IV hypsometers. For live trees, we also
estimated average crown radius. A random 20% of live trees were
sampled for age on each plot. Increment borers were used to col-
lect cores at 40 cm above ground. ‘‘Seedlings’’ were deﬁned as pin-
yon or juniper individuals less than 1.37 m in height and these
were tallied by species on all plots. Although deﬁning tree seed-
lings in this way is common in forestry (Young, 1982), it should
be noted that pinyon and juniper individuals reaching this height
may be 25 years of age or more (Huffman unpublished data). Shrub
species richness and cover were measured using the line intercept
method (Canﬁeld, 1941) along 25-m transects formed by the wes-
tern boundary of the northwest quadrant of each plot. Downed
logs were sampled using four 15.24-m transects per plot according
to the methods described by Brown (1974). Transects were located
at 10-m intervals along plot centerlines beginning at the south plot
boundary. Each transect was oriented at a random direction from
its starting point. Logs (P7.6 cm in diameter at intercept) were tal-
lied along transects as either ‘‘sound’’ or ‘‘rotten’’ and measured for
diameter and piece length.
2.3. Analysis
Tree ages from increment core samples were used to approxi-
mate time since ﬁre (TSF) for sites where speciﬁc information
was lacking from databases and published literature (i.e., sites
>85 years TSF; Table 1). Increment cores were glued to wooden
mounts in the laboratory and then sanded with progressively ﬁner
grit sandpaper to enhance visibility of growth rings in preparation
for age analysis. For pinyon pine samples, we used standard den-
drochronological techniques described by Stokes and Smiley
(1996) and crossdated samples against a locally-derived master
chronology. We did not attempt to crossdate juniper samples but
instead simply counted growth rings of these species under binoc-
ular microscopes. We assigned TSF for these sites by examining
tree age distributions based on 10-year classes constructed from
increment core data. We assumed that samples more than 40 years
from the upper ends of the distributions likely represented older,
residual trees that survived the ﬁres. Thus, conservative estimates
of TSF were made based on the oldest tree cohorts excluding such
outliers. Clearly, TSF estimates provide a minimum time since ﬁre
and cannot give exact ﬁre dates due to unknown lag times between
ﬁre occurrence and tree establishment. In addition, ages for the
persistent woodland sites were uncertain as samples of the very
oldest trees were limited due to heart rot.
Structural variables summarized included density of live trees
and snags (trees ha1; TPH), live tree aboveground biomass
(Mg ha1), density of conifer seedlings (no. ha1), shrub cover (%)
and species richness (no. site1), and density of sound and rotten
logs (no. ha1). Live tree biomass was calculated for P. edulis and

J. monosperma using allometric equations provided by Grier et al.
(1992) that relate component biomass to stem diameter (DRC).
Biomass for J. osteosperma was calculated using equations de-
scribed in Miller et al. (1981) that relate biomass to stem diameter
measured at breast height (DBH) and crown area. We used regres-
sion equations in Chojnacky (1999) to estimate DBH from our mea-
surements of DRC. Shrub cover was calculated for each species as
the sum transect distance covered by leaves, foliage or branches di-
vided by total transect distance (25 m). Log tallies were converted
to density using the formula described in Waddell (2002), where:
Log density ðno: ha
1Þ ¼ ðp=2LÞð1=liÞf
L is length of transect, li is piece length, and f is a factor used to con-
vert the result to a per-hectare value.
Relationships between structural variables and time since ﬁre
were tested using simple linear and nonlinear regression in SAS
JMP (SAS Institute Inc., 2009). Means calculated from plot samples
at each site were used as dependent variables in these regressions.
Relationships were considered statistically signiﬁcant at P 6 0.05
and selection among competing models was made by comparing
root mean square error values. Models with lower RMSE values
were considered better for explaining the set of observations being
tested. In addition, we derived an overall index of structural com-
plexity to describe the sites (McElhinny et al., 2005). Site values for
live tree biomass, seedling density, snag density, log density, shrub
cover, and number of shrub species were relativized by dividing
the mean site value for a given variable by the maximum mean va-
lue observed for that variable across all sites. Thus, relativized val-
ues for a given variable ranged from 0 to 1.0. Structural complexity
for each site was calculated by summing the relativized values
(McElhinny et al., 2005). Thus, possible complexity scores ranged
from 0 (lowest relative abundance in all structural variables) to 6
(highest relative abundance in all variables). The relationship be-
tween complexity score and time since ﬁre was tested using simple
linear regression.
3. Results
3.1. Fire chronosequence
Information from US Forest Service ﬁre databases, published lit-
erature, and dendrochronology data indicated that sites ranged
from 3 to 370 years TSF (Table 1). Evidence in terms of charred
snags, logs, and/or stumps was prevalent and identiﬁable at all ﬁre
sites. The distribution and size of ﬁre evidence suggested that ﬁres
had been stand-replacing events occurring in persistent pinyon–
juniper woodlands. For example, average number of combined
charred snags, logs, and stumps ranged from 14–167 trees ha1,
with a maximum diameter at root collar of 61–110 cm.
3.2. Structural dynamics
Total live tree density and juniper tree density were positively
and linearly related to TSF (P = 0.007, R2 = 0.49, and P < 0.001,
R2 = 0.76, respectively) (Fig. 2). There was no signiﬁcant relation-
ship between live pinyon tree density and TSF. Juniper and pinyon
trees were lacking from ﬁres younger than 30 years. The tree den-
sity maximum of 493 trees ha1 was found at the GFC site
(340 years TSF). Most sites, regardless of time since ﬁre, showed
diameter distributions dominated by smaller trees (Table 2).
Exceptions were sites CF, YJC, and CFC, which showed relatively
greater numbers of trees in mid-range diameter classes. Differ-
ences among sites in density and size of trees were reﬂected in sig-
niﬁcant curvilinear relationships between total aboveground live
tree biomass, pinyon tree biomass and juniper tree biomass and
TSF (4-parameter Weibull function: P < 0.001, R2 = 0.96; P = 0.04,
R2 = 0.32, and P = 0.004, R2 = 0.62, respectively). Total live tree bio-
mass reached an asymptote maximum of 65 Mg ha1 around
250 years. No signiﬁcant relationships were found between total
seedling density or seedling density by species and TSF (Fig. 2).
Tree seedlings were absent on 2 of 3 of the youngest ﬁres in the
chronosequence but were found as early as 6 years TSF (GF site).
Pinyon seedlings outnumbered juniper seedlings on nearly all ﬁres
greater than 60 years.
Shrubs occurred at all sites but shrub cover was variable and
was not signiﬁcantly related to TSF (Fig. 2). The most common
shrub species found was broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae
(Pursh.) Britton Rusby), which occurred on 11 of the 13 sites and
showed mean cover values ranging from 0.3% to 10.6%. Other com-
mon species were rubber rabbitbrush (Ericameria nauseosa (Pall. Ex
Pursh) G.L. Nesom & Baird), Fremont’s mahonia (Mahonia fremontii
(Torr.) Fedde), big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.), and cliff-
rose (Purshia stansburiana Torr.). Shrub species richness was not
signiﬁcantly related to TSF and from 1 to 5 species was found on
any individual site.
Total snag density showed a signiﬁcant 2nd-order polynomial
relationship with TSF (P = 0.04, R2 = 0.47). Minimum total snag
density estimated by this function occurred at 240 years. There
was no signiﬁcant relationship between density of pinyon snags
and TSF. Juniper snag density showed a negative linear relationship
with TSF (P = 0.004, R2 = 0.54) (Fig. 2). No signiﬁcant relationship
was found between sound log density or total log density and
TSF. Density of rotten logs was positively and linearly related to
TSF (P = 0.04, R2 = 0.46) (Fig. 2).
3.3. Structural complexity
Structural complexity index scores ranged from 0.48 (LIZ site)
to 4.09 (GFC site). Complexity was signiﬁcantly and positively re-
lated to TSF (P = 0.01, R2 = 0.46) (Fig. 3). Sites with unexpectedly
high complexity values were YJ and RBE. Scores for these sites were
driven by high relative abundance of seedlings, logs, and shrubs.
Sites with low relative abundance of structural elements and thus
low complexity values were LIZ and CF.
4. Discussion
4.1. Long-term patterns
Sites sampled in this study represented post-ﬁre recovery of
pinyon–juniper woodlands along a long-term chronosequence of
370 years. Geographic databases and published research were
used to identify ﬁres that burned during the 20th century whereas
archival photographs and data as well as satellite imagery were
helpful in locating earlier ﬁres. Field evidence such as charred
snags, logs, and stumps in combination with tree age data con-
ﬁrmed occurrence of 19th century stand-replacing ﬁres in these
pinyon–juniper woodlands. Arnold et al. (1964) similarly used an-
nual ring counts of live trees growing near charred ﬁre evidence to
identify late 19th century ﬁres in Arizona. Erdman (1970) and
Floyd et al. (2004) estimated time since ﬁre for a presettlement
burn in Colorado by aging ﬁre-killed trees as well as live trees that
had established after the ﬁre. Although these methods are not ro-
bust for pinpointing exact ﬁre years, they provide minimum time
since ﬁre estimates that are valuable for describing long-term pat-
terns such as those presented here. Further, our ﬁndings as well as
those of others (Arnold et al., 1964; Erdman, 1970; Floyd et al.,
2004), conﬁrm two important details: (1) stand replacing ﬁres of

pinyon–juniper woodlands and (2) historical ﬁres may be initially
identiﬁed through remote sensing techniques and subsequent ver-
iﬁcation may be done through ﬁeld surveys of ﬁre evidence that
can persist for more than a century. These ﬁndings in turn indicate
that historical increases in woodland cover as well as current open
structural conditions on some sites represent reestablishment pro-
cesses following earlier stand-replacing ﬁre.
Previous studies of long-term responses to ﬁre in pinyon–juni-
per ecosystems have primarily focused on successional patterns in
plant communities. Several studies report early dominance of an-
nual species and gradual recruitment of perennial herbaceous
plants, shrubs, and relatively slow reestablishment of woodland
cover (Arnold et al., 1964; Erdman, 1970; Barney and Frischknecht,
1974; Koniak, 1985). In our study, overstory tree density was a lin-
ear function of TSF and woodland densities reached 500 trees ha1
(>270 years TSF). We did not ﬁnd an asymptotic relationship be-
tween tree recruitment and TSF as we did with tree biomass. Sim-
ilarly, Wangler and Minnich (1996) found that tree density in
stands of pinyon, juniper, and other conifers continued to increase
over time, reaching 360–544 trees ha1 along a 160-year ﬁre
chronosequence in the Sierra Nevada Range of California. Barney
and Frischknecht (1974), however, found that pinyon and juniper
tree density in Great Basin woodlands reached 692 trees ha1
around 86 years TSF with no higher density in stands >100 years

TSF. Although these results, taken together with those in our study,
demonstrate variability in recovery time and site potential among
pinyon–juniper systems, they also show that stand density gener-
ally requires several decades to more than a century to reach pre-
burn levels following stand replacing ﬁre. On our sites, juniper
density was positively related to TSF whereas no similar relation-
ship was found for pinyon. This suggests that sites we sampled
were more suitable for juniper (J. osteosperma and J. monosperma)
than pinyon and reﬂects general differences among species in eco-
logical amplitude and conditions of temperature and moisture un-
der which juniper and pinyon establish and survive (Evans, 1988).
Seedling density along our chronosequence was variable and not
signiﬁcantly related to TSF, although density was generally sparse
on sites where TSF was <30 years. Similar results have been re-
ported for other pinyon–juniper sites (Arnold et al., 1964; Erdman,
1970; Wangler and Minnich, 1996). In general, juniper species at
our study areas are relatively drought tolerant and are likely to
establish sooner after disturbance than pinyon pine (Johnsen,
1962; Tausch and West, 1988). Pinyon establishment is increased
by nurse structures such as shrubs, rocks, and coarse woody mate-
rial that ameliorate harsh environmental conditions and provide
protection from herbivory (Chambers, 2001; Pearson and Theimer,
2004). Thus, biological legacies and physical structures remaining
after disturbance as well as colonization and development of woo-
dy vegetation likely affect regeneration patterns for this species.
Indeed, the highest densities of pinyon regeneration were on older
persistent woodland sites, a pattern not observed for juniper seed-
lings (Fig. 2). It is not clear whether a signiﬁcant positive relation-
ship with TSF would have been observed if we had restricted our
analysis only to recently established seedlings.
Live tree biomass accumulation followed an ‘‘s-shaped’’ (sig-
moidal) curve with TSF. In our study, a Weibull function ﬁt the data
well but similar classic growth functions are likely to model bio-
mass changes adequately (Yin et al., 2003). This s-shaped growth
function has been widely reported for other forest systems. For
example, Spies (1998) described a response function of this form
for succession in Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests of the
US Paciﬁc Northwest, with maximum biomass values being
reached in approximately 300 years. Similarly, Whittaker et al.
(1974) estimated that aboveground woody biomass of a broadleaf
deciduous forest in the eastern United States would reach an
asymptotic climax value of approximately 350 Mg ha1 300 years
after clearcutting. Paré and Bergeron (1995) analyzed a 230-year
chronosequence in southern boreal forests of Canada and found
maximum
aboveground
biomass
reached
about
170 Mg ha1
approximately 75 years after stand-replacing ﬁre. Maximum bio-
mass values in our study (65 Mg ha1) were similar to those re-
ported by Grier et al. (1992) for mature pinyon–juniper (P.

edulis–J. monosperma) (53 Mg ha1) in Arizona. Live tree biomass in
our study reached maximum values in approximately 250 years
TSF, a rate of woodland reestablishment similar to the model sug-
gested by Erdman (1970).
Shrub cover was variable and was not signiﬁcantly related to
TSF in our study. Other pinyon–juniper studies have reported
shrub cover to follow a 2nd- or 3rd-order polynomial function over
time since ﬁre, maximizing at early to mid stages of succession
(Barney and Frischknecht, 1974; Koniak, 1985; Wangler and Min-
nich, 1996). These patterns may be more predictable on Great Ba-
sin or Sierra Nevada pinyon–juniper sites where shrubs are
abundant in understory communities, or may reﬂect variability
in environmental or edaphic conditions not analyzed here. In
northern Arizona, Arnold et al. (1964) described separate succes-
sional pathways after ﬁre depending upon the occurrence of par-
ticular shrub species. For example, broom snakeweed is often
killed by ﬁre but can reestablish from wind-dispersed seed (Tir-
menstein, 1999a). In contrast, rubber rabbitbrush may resprout
immediately after ﬁre as well as colonize from off site (Tirmen-
stein, 1999b). Site-speciﬁc factors such as pre-ﬁre community
composition, species’ regeneration niches, and potential for coloni-
zation by off-site species likely contributed to variability in our
study.
Dead wood in the form of standing snags, logs, and stumps is
ecologically important in pinyon–juniper woodlands and other
semiarid environments as it inﬂuences soil processes, contributes
to wildlife habitat, and provides plant regeneration microsites
(Reichle, 1975; Pearson and Theimer, 2004; Stoddard et al.,
2008). Previous work to quantify woody debris in pinyon–juniper
woodlands has generally been limited to studies of old-growth
conditions (Ernest et al., 1993; Waichler et al., 2001; Floyd, 2003)
and few data are available to describe long-term dynamics. In
our study, total snag abundance followed a ‘‘u-shaped’’ function
over time (Fig. 2). Similar ‘‘u-shaped’’ patterns for snag dynamics
after ﬁre have been reported for other ecosystems (e.g., Passovoy
and Fulé, 2006; Brassard and Chen, 2008). This result reﬂects both
falling of ﬁre-killed trees over time as well as snag recruitment in
the developing woodland. A negative linear relationship between
snag abundance and TSF for juniper in our study suggests that snag
recruitment at later stages of stand development was driven by
pinyon pine mortality. This may be due to density-dependent mor-
tality of pinyon pine populations on our sites. Indeed, Negrón and
Wilson (2003) found that pinyon die-off in regional drought years
was signiﬁcantly related to tree size and age, mistletoe occurrence,
and stand density (but see Floyd et al., 2009). Although we could
not determine snag fall rates in our study, Kearns et al. (2005)
found that pinyon snags killed by bark beetles and root disease
in southwestern Colorado persisted for up to 25 years before fall-
ing. Because juniper wood is relatively more resistant to decay,
snag fall rates for juniper species are likely to be longer than those
for pinyon pine. Surprisingly, downed log density did not follow a
pattern similar to snags. Total log density (sounds and rotten) and
density of sound logs were variable and not signiﬁcantly related to
TSF, which may be the result of interacting processes including
snag fall, log fragmentation, and decomposition. These same pro-
cesses are likely reﬂected in the positive linear relationship be-
tween rotten log density and TSF (Fig. 2). Log densities on the
oldest sites in our study were somewhat high compared with those
reported for old-growth western juniper (J. occidentalis) woodlands
in Oregon (Waichler et al., 2001).
Although individual structural elements showed differential
trends along the chronosequence, aggregate structural complexity
generally increased as a linear function of TSF (Fig. 3). Relatively
high complexity values found on sites (YJ and RBE) suggest rela-
tively rapid recovery toward woodland conditions. In contrast, rel-
atively
low
complexity
values
(LIZ
and
CF)
may
indicate
developmental trajectories characterized by more open conditions
with lower abundance of key structural elements such as seedlings,
logs, and shrubs. More work is needed to investigate factors inﬂu-
encing the levels of these elements and their relationship to eco-
system dynamics. Pre-burn stand characteristics, ﬁre severity,
climate, and physical site factors are likely to be important in
determining structural complexity and subsequent developmental
trajectories (Bradley et al., 1992). In particular, the interactions be-
tween climate, ﬁre severity, and the inﬂuences of biological lega-
cies in determining long-term structural patterns are in need of
further study. In addition, relationships between other indices of
structural complexity and TSF could be explored (McElhinny
Fig. 4. Representative structural characteristics of sites along a pinyon–juniper, time-since-ﬁre chronosequence. Shown are photos of sample plots at JF (A), AF (B), RBE (C),
and GFC (D) sites, which correspond to 3, 85, 140, and at least 340 years since stand-replacing ﬁre, respectively.

et al., 2005). In our study, we analyzed a simple additive index of
key structural parameters. Additional attributes that may change
with time since ﬁre include variation in tree diameter and height
as well as spatial arrangement of structures. Lastly, more work is
needed to investigate links between long-term structural changes
and ecosystem function and process.
4.2. Management Implications
Results of this study provide quantitative information concern-
ing long-term structural patterns in pinyon–juniper woodlands
after ﬁre. This information can be used by land managers desiring
to conserve biological diversity while designing activities to reach
various goals. For example, silvicultural prescriptions aimed at
reducing hazardous fuel loads, enhancing wildlife habitat, or
restoring degraded woodland sites can be developed that emulate
structural conditions associated with different points along the
developmental trajectory. Canopy openings intended to mimic
conditions found immediately after natural ﬁre disturbance should
retain relatively high numbers of snags and downed logs (Fig. 4A
and B). Treatments aiming to reduce stand density and mimic later
stages of development (Fig. 4C and D) should retain all-aged diam-
eter structure and encourage seedling establishment and shrub
cover. Managers should expect old-growth conditions to be rela-
tively complex with higher tree density and biomass, shrubs,
snags, and downed logs present. Approaches that emulate struc-
tural patterns resulting from natural disturbance processes are
likely to conserve habitat across a range of spatial scales (Linden-
mayer et al., 2006).
Results from this study suggest that future conditions on sites
may be understood by examining current structural characteris-
tics. Structurally complex sites will likely move toward persistent
woodland conditions over time, given no major disturbances. Con-
versely, sites with low structural complexity may move along tra-
jectories
leading
toward
more
open
conditions
rather
than
persistent woodland. Management actions affecting structural
characteristics are likely to inﬂuence long-term developmental
pathways.
