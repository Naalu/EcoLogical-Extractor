Making accurate predictions of plant community responses to grazing management is a major objective of
rangeland ecology. Metrics such as species composition are site speciﬁc, whereas others such as functional
groups and functional traits can be generalized across different rangeland types. We analyzed long-term
(1912–1941) shifts in the understory community at ﬁve sites in a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. &
C. Lawson var. scopulorum Engelm.) forest when protected from heavy livestock grazing. We examined dif-
ferences in total basal cover, species composition, species richness, functional group composition, and
community-weighted mean (CWM) functional traits between heavily grazed and ungrazed areas in four
time periods (1912, 1920, 1930, 1940). Total understory basal cover was greater in ungrazed than heavily
grazed areas in 1920 but not in later time periods. Understory species composition diverged by 1930 and
continued to differ in 1940. Functional group composition differed from 1920 onwards. In 1920 and 1930,
C3 graminoids declined more in relative abundance in heavily grazed than ungrazed areas. By 1940, forbs
accounted for much more of the cover in heavily grazed than ungrazed areas. During the study period,
CWM speciﬁc leaf area and foliar Nmass declined by 8% and 11%, respectively, in ungrazed quadrats,
while CWM leaf dry matter content increased 8%. Leaf traits, but not maximum height or seed mass, dem-
onstrated consistent and predictable responses to protection from heavy grazing. Herbaceous understory
species with leaf traits that allow for slower resource acquisition became more abundant in response to
protection from heavy grazing. Our results indicate that managers should expect to observe more rapid
changes in functional group composition and leaf functional traits than in species composition and species
richness following protection from heavy livestock grazing.

Introduction
Grazing by domestic ungulates is one of the most widespread
forms of land use world-wide (Díaz et al., 2006). Research on the im-
pacts of grazing (here, referring speciﬁcally to livestock grazing) has
largely focused on understanding shifts in species composition
(Milchunas and Lauenroth, 1993). However, this approach may
have hindered a broader understanding of the processes underlying
community-level responses to grazing because it does not allow for
generalizations beyond a speciﬁc locality (Vesk and Westoby, 2001).
Given the degree to which land-use change impacts plant biodi-
versity (Chapin et al., 2000), understanding the functional conse-
quences of grazing can improve management of rangelands.
Identifying consistent shifts in plant functional strategies (as quanti-
ﬁed by functional groups or plant traits) in response to grazing can
improve regional and global models of vegetation dynamics (Díaz
et al., 2006). While livestock grazing is one of the factors resulting
in dramatic increases in tree density (Bakker and Moore, 2007) and
shifts in plant community composition (Arnold, 1950; Cooper,
1960; Clary, 1975; Milchunas, 2006) across the Southwest US, rela-
tively little attention has been given to functional responses follow-
ing protection from heavy grazing (Arnold, 1955).
Plant functional classiﬁcations have received much attention
from ecologists seeking predictable patterns in response to distur-
bance, particularly grazing (McIntyre et al., 1999). A classiﬁcation

based on life history strategies is common and has revealed a com-
mon pattern with increased grazing pressure favoring annual versus
perennial plant species (Arnold, 1955; Milchunas and Lauenroth,
1993; McIntyre and Lavorel, 2001). Many classiﬁcation schemes
exist (Smith et al., 1997), including the well-established GFL classiﬁ-
cation of graminoids (G), nonleguminous forbs (F), and legumes
(L) (Wright et al., 2006). Graminoids are often further reﬁned by
distinguishing between taxa with C3 (cool season) and C4 (warm sea-
son) photosynthetic pathways to reﬂect phenological differences and
because utilization by grazers varies with grazing season (Smith,
1967).
A more recent alternative is to consider continuously distributed
plant functional traits instead of categorical functional groups. Func-
tional traits inﬂuence vegetation dynamics, community response to
disturbance, and ecosystem function (Pakeman and Quested, 2004).
Westoby (1998) proposed a leaf-height-seed (LHS) scheme that quan-
tiﬁes plant strategies by locating species in a three-dimensional trait
space deﬁned by speciﬁc leaf area (SLA), vegetative height, and seed
mass. These traits play a central role in a plant’s ability to capture re-
sources, compete, and regenerate. The leaf economics spectrum repre-
sents a gradient of resource acquisition rates (Wright et al., 2004) and
can be examined using a set of coordinated traits: SLA, leaf dry matter
content (LDMC), and leaf nitrogen concentration (foliar Nmass)
(Laughlin et al., 2010). Leaves with high SLA have low LDMC and
high foliar Nmass; species with this set of coordinated traits tend to
have high relative growth rates stemming from high net photosyn-
thetic capacity (Reich et al., 1997; Wright et al., 2004). Maximum veg-
etative height at maturity primarily reﬂects a species’ competitive
ability. In ecosystems where light is limited, taller plants have the po-
tential to realize faster growth rates due to their ability to intercept
more light (Poorter et al., 2008). Seed mass reﬂects variation in a spe-
cies’ ability to disperse to and colonize sites. Seed mass also reﬂects a
fundamental tradeoff between seed size and reproductive output.
Larger-seeded species produce fewer seeds for a given reproductive ef-
fort; however, seedlings of these species have more reserves with
which to establish in low-resource environments (Kitajima, 2002)
and are better equipped to tolerate defoliation (Armstrong and
Westoby, 1993).
Westoby (1999) related the LHS scheme to grazing response. He
proposed that under heavy non-selective grazing, high SLA species
should be at a competitive advantage due to faster regrowth. Taller
species should decrease in abundance because they would receive
more attention from livestock. Species that produce large quantities
of small seeds should increase in abundance because heavy grazing
would create many gaps in which seedling establishment could
occur. These responses are based on the underlying concept that
through the selective removal of plant material, grazing affects a
plant’s ability to capture resources, compete, and regenerate
(Grime, 1977; Noy-Meir et al., 1989). As grazing intensity increases,
selection is thought to favor less competitive species adapted to rap-
idly acquire resources under temporarily favorable conditions. Alter-
natively, by excluding grazing from the environment, competition for
light and nutrients should increase.
Some prior work has examined the effects of grazing on plant
traits. Vegetative height has long been a key functional trait thought
to reﬂect a mechanism of grazing avoidance, with increased levels of
grazing
intensity
consistently
favoring
shorter
plants
(Dyksterhuis, 1949; Arnold, 1955; Díaz et al., 2001; Díaz et al.,
2006). Seed mass, SLA, foliar Nmass, LDMC, and leaf toughness have
been used to understand and predict the impact of grazing because
these traits are thought to reﬂect a general trade-off in growth versus
defense (Moles and Westoby, 2004; Adler et al., 2004; Cingolani
et al., 2005; Louault et al., 2005; Laliberté et al., 2012; Wesuls et al.,
2012; Moreno García et al., 2014). Some researchers suggest that
generalizations of grazing impacts described by plant traits may be dif-
ﬁcult (Vesk and Westoby, 2001), whereas others suggest that plant
species’ responses to herbivory might be idiosyncratic with regard to
LHS traits (Butterﬁeld and Callaway, 2012). Nevertheless, Díaz et al.
(2006) suggested reanalyzing existing species-based studies to evalu-
ate trait-based responses to grazing.
Both compositional and trait-based approaches provide valuable
information regarding rangeland responses to grazing. Where a func-
tional trait-based approach has the potential to be more generaliz-
able across rangeland types, species and functional group data are
easier to collect and provide important site-speciﬁc information.
Combining both can allow for a more comprehensive understanding
of the effects of grazing on vegetation structure and function.
In this study, we reanalyzed data from a unique long-term study to
determine vegetation responses to continued heavy livestock grazing
and recovery patterns when livestock were excluded for 30 yr. Perma-
nent chart quadrats were established in 1912 in heavily grazed
ponderosa pine–bunchgrass forests in northern Arizona. About half of
the quadrats continued to experience heavy grazing while the others
were protected from livestock grazing and are hereafter referred to
as being ungrazed. A subset of the quadrats were used to document
the inﬂuence of increasing pine regeneration on perennial grass
cover (Arnold, 1950), but no studies have been published that used
them to examine the effects of excluding heavy grazing over time.
To isolate the effects of grazing during the study period, we statisti-
cally controlled for overstory dominance, soil texture, and elevation
among quadrats and over time. To date, this is one of the few long-
term studies examining changes in species composition due to graz-
ing in the ponderosa pine type of the Southwest (Arnold, 1950;
Milchunas, 2006; Loeser et al., 2007).
We formulated three hypotheses on the basis of our understand-
ing of grazing management during the study period. First, we hy-
pothesized that ungrazed and continuously grazed communities
would diverge in species composition and in functional group com-
position, and that these changes would result primarily from recov-
ery by perennial graminoids in ungrazed areas because these
species would have been at a competitive disadvantage under the
heavy levels of grazing common before protection (Talbot and Hill,
1923; Arnold, 1955). Second, we hypothesized that species richness
would be higher in ungrazed areas because the duration and intensi-
ty of grazing would limit richness in grazed areas to those species
able to tolerate or avoid grazing. Third, we hypothesized that func-
tional traits would diverge between ungrazed and grazed communi-
ties. Speciﬁcally, we hypothesized that ungrazed communities would
exhibit 1) lower mean SLA, lower foliar Nmass, and higher mean LDMC
because species with this set of coordinated traits would have a
greater competitive advantage in less disturbed environments
(Grime, 1977), 2) a higher mean vegetative height due to increased
competition for light, and 3) greater seed mass because seedling es-
tablishment would be favored by species that produce larger seeds
in low-light and lower-resource environments (Kitajima, 2002).
Methods
Study Area
Between 1870 and 1910, the Southwest experienced an unprece-
dented introduction of domesticated livestock as a result of Euro-
American settlement of the region (Olberding et al., 2005; Milchunas,
2006). In 1914, national forests in Arizona issued grazing permits for
6 800 horses, 243 200 cattle, and 379 000 sheep (Hill, 1915). Al-
though little information is available regarding speciﬁc stocking
rates, it was widely recognized that the ponderosa pine–bunchgrass
forests of northern Arizona were overstocked and grazing ranged
258

from heavy to severe (Hill, 1918; Talbot and Hill, 1923; Arnold,
1950).
In 1912, Robert R. Hill initiated a study to examine the effect of
grazing on the herbaceous understory species associated with the
ponderosa pine–bunchgrass forests of northern Arizona. Five sites
spanning a range of soil types and elevations within 25 km of Flag-
staff, Arizona were selected as representative of the overgrazed
rangeland common during this time period (Talbot and Hill, 1923;
Arnold, 1950) (Table S1; available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.
1016/j.rama.2015.03.008). At each site, an ~0.7-ha exclosure was
built to exclude domestic livestock (Fig. 1). Within each exclosure,
ﬁve permanent 1 × 1 m quadrats were established. Adjacent to
each exclosure, in areas where livestock grazing continued, ﬁve addi-
tional permanent quadrats were established. At each site, individu-
al quadrats inside and outside the livestock exclosures were
interspersed within different overstory canopy types (e.g., full
shade, partial shade, no shade) (Talbot and Hill, 1923; Arnold,
1950). In total, 50 quadrats were established. Quadrats were sampled
intermittently between 1912 and 1941. Due to the temporally unbal-
anced sampling of the quadrats (Fig. S1; available online at http://dx.
doi.org/10.1016/j.rama.2015.03.008), we partitioned the data into
four time periods: 1912–1917 (termed 1912), 1920–1926 (1920),
1930–1933 (1930), and 1938–1941 (1940). For a given quadrat, all
data from years within a given time period were averaged. A total of
185 quadrat–time period combinations were used in the analysis.
Before fencing the exclosures, all sites were heavily grazed by cat-
tle and sheep for 40 yr (since 1870). In general, livestock were grazed
continuously from May through October (Hill, 1915). All sites were
considered heavily grazed to overgrazed when the exclosures were
established (Talbot and Hill, 1923). Subsequent grazing intensity at
each site was estimated on the basis of the degree of utilization of
the dominant bunchgrasses (Merrick, 1939). For example, sites
were considered overgrazed if these species were consumed to
such a degree that their likelihood of continued persistence was re-
duced. Better livestock control resulted in lighter and more uniform
utilization at Reese Tank, though the other sites were considered
heavily grazed to overgrazed at least through 1938 (Merrick, 1939)
(Table S1; available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rama.2015.
03.008).
Data from the nearby USFS Fort Valley Experimental Forest show
that between 1912 and 1941 annual precipitation ranged from
43.4 cm in 1939 to 81.4 cm in 1919 (WRRC 2012). Figure S1B (avail-
able online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rama.2015.03.008) shows
annual precipitation between 1912 and 1941 as a percent departure
from the long term (1909–2012) average of 56.5 cm (WRCC, 2012).
Environmental Variables
We incorporated percent sand, elevation, and overstory tree basal
area as covariates in our analysis. These variables were measured as
described in Bakker and Moore (2007) and Laughlin et al. (2011).
Percent sand content and elevation were constant over time while
tree basal area (m2 ha-1) increased during the study period. To quan-
tify this change in basal area, we reconstructed historical tree basal
area on 20 × 20 m overstory plots centered on each quadrat in each
time period. For trees that were alive during contemporary sampling,
radial growth increments were measured on tree cores and a propor-
tional reconstruction method (Bakker, 2005) was used to calculate
historical tree diameters. For trees that were dead during contempo-
rary sampling, a transition matrix decomposition model was used to
estimate tree death date and then tree diameter was reconstructed at
each time period using a stand reconstruction model (Bakker et al.,
2008). Comparisons of reconstructed and historical data indicate
that these methods are reliable within ± 10% (Huffman et al., 2001).
Reconstructed tree densities and pine basal areas were signiﬁcantly
positively correlated (R2 = 0.43, P b 0.0001). Reconstructed forest
structure showed increases in pine basal areas on both grazed and
ungrazed quadrats throughout the study period. Between 1912 and
1940, average pine basal area increased from 3.4 to 6.6 m2 ha-1 on
grazed quadrats and from 4.3 to 7.2 m2 ha-1 on ungrazed quadrats.

The reconstruction model was performed in R version 2.11.0 (R Devel-
opment Core Team, 2010) using code available in Bakker et al. (2008).
Vegetation Data
From 1912–1941, trained botanists from the U.S. Forest Service
compiled lists of all plant species present and mapped the basal
cover of all understory vegetation on each quadrat. In general,
graminoids were mapped as polygons and forbs were mapped as
points. Digitized quadrat maps were used to calculate the area occu-
pied by each herbaceous species. We assumed that each point repre-
sented a plant with 0.0025% basal cover, the approximate diameter of
a typical forb stem on these plots (Laughlin et al., 2011). For each
quadrat, we calculated the average basal cover by species in each
time period. Due to the use of common names on historical
datasheets, some species identiﬁcations were lumped at higher taxo-
nomic levels (i.e., genus), but are referred to here as species for sim-
plicity. A total of 69 species were used in our analyses, including 16
graminoids, 45 nonleguminous forbs, 6 legumes, and 2 shrubs
(Table S3). Seven of the sixteen graminoids are C3 species. In terms
of lifespan, 2 of the graminoids (Muhlenbergia minutissima [Steud.]
Swallen and Bouteloua simplex Lag.) are annuals, one (Elymus
elymoides [Raf.] Swezey) is a short-lived perennial (Lauenroth and
Adler, 2008), and the remainder are all thought to be long-lived pe-
rennials. Five of the nonleguminous forbs are considered annual-
biennial, and the rest are perennials. All six legumes are perennials.
To quantify understory community dynamics in response to exclu-
sion of heavy livestock grazing, we calculated several multivariate and
univariate metrics for each quadrat in each time period. Community
composition was examined on the basis of the average percent basal
cover of each species and functional group composition based on the
average percent basal cover of ﬁve functional groups (C3 graminoids,
C4 graminoids, nonleguminous forbs, legumes, and shrubs).
Functional strategies were examined by focusing on ﬁve function-
al traits: SLA, LDMC, foliar Nmass, seed mass, and maximum vegetative
height. The mean value for each trait was obtained for each species as
described in Laughlin et al. (2010). Where species were lumped at
higher taxonomic levels, we used the average trait value for the com-
bined species. We calculated the community-weighted mean (CWM)
trait value for each trait. A quadrat’s CWM trait value is the mean trait
value across all species in a quadrat weighted by their relative
abundance (Shipley et al., 2011):
T jk ¼

i¼1
tijpik
where tij is the average value of trait j for species i and pik is the rela-
tive abundance of species i in quadrat k. ThereforeT jk is an estimate of
the value of trait j for the average individual in quadrat k.
Data Analyses
Response metrics were analyzed for differences between grazing
treatments after accounting for the environmental variables (percent
sand, elevation, and tree basal area) as covariates. Each time period
was analyzed separately. In each model, the effects of covariates
and grazing were only investigated if the overall model was signiﬁ-
cant at α = 0.05. A model with Type I (sequential) sums of squares
was used so that the effect of grazing was examined after ﬁtting the
covariates to the data.
All analyses were conducted using distance-based linear models
(DISTLM) in the PERMANOVA+ add-on (v. 1.0.3) to PRIMER
(v.6.1.13). DISTLM (Anderson, 2001) relieves the assumption of normal-
ly distributed data and can be applied equivalently to univariate and
multivariate ecological response variables. The appropriate sums of
squares are calculated from a distance matrix that can be obtained
using any distance measure (Anderson, 2001). Bray–Curtis dissimilarity
was used as the distance measure for multivariate compositional
metrics (community and functional group compositions) as recom-
mendedby Faith etal. (1987);these matrices wererelativized by rowto-
tals to reﬂect relative basal cover before analyses. Euclidean dissimilarity
was used as the distance measure for the multivariate analysis of CWM
traits and for all univariate comparisons (total understory basal cover,
species richness, basal cover of each functional group, and individual
CWM
traits).

Results
In 1912, at the start of the experiment and following a period of
intense livestock grazing, the grazing treatments did not differ in
total understory basal cover or how that basal cover was distribut-
ed among species or functional groups. By 1920, total basal cover
was signiﬁcantly greater in ungrazed quadrats. Though this effect
disappeared in later decades, when averaged over periods, total
basal cover in ungrazed quadrats and grazed quadrats was 16.8 ±
0.25 and 14.2 ± 0.58 (mean ± SE, n = 4), respectively (Fig. 2A;
Table S3; available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rama.2015.
03.008). Community composition did not differ until 1930 and 1940
(Table S2; available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rama.2015.
03.008). Species richness was consistently higher in ungrazed than

grazed quadrats, though this difference was only statistically signiﬁ-
cant in 1940, suggesting that the treatments were gradually diverg-
ing (Fig. 2B; Table S2; available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/
j.rama.2015.03.008). Changes in model signiﬁcance (based on P
values) suggest that overall differences in community composition
between grazing treatments continued to increase into the 1940
time period. However, the low partial R2 values for the grazing
term indicate that the compositional differences between grazing
treatments were subtle (Table S2; available online at http://dx.doi.
org/10.1016/j.rama.2015.03.008).
Functional group composition responded more quickly than com-
munity composition; differences were already evident in 1920
(Fig. 3; Table 1). In 1920 and 1930, these differences were due to a
lower abundance of C3 graminoids in grazed than ungrazed quadrats
(Fig. 3). However, we observed a decline in C3 graminoid abundance
in ungrazed quadrats throughout the study period as C4 graminoid
abundance increased. For example, the dominant C4 graminoid,
Muhlenbergia montana (Nutt.) Hitchcock, increased from 11.1% in
1912 to 31.3% in 1940 in ungrazed quadrats while Festuca arizonica
Vasey, the dominant C3 graminoid, declined from 16.4% to 11.8% be-
tween 1912 and 1940, respectively (Table S3; available online at
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rama.2015.03.008). In 1940, differences
between treatments reﬂected an increased abundance of forbs in
grazed quadrats (Fig. 3).
CWM traits responded signiﬁcantly to grazing (Fig. 4; Table 2).
Considering all traits together, differences between the grazing treat-
ments were evident in 1930 and 1940. LDMC was lower in grazed
than ungrazed quadrats already in 1912, but the difference between
these grazing treatments increased throughout the study period; the
amount of variation explained by the grazing treatment increased
from 6% to 21% (Table 2). Between the 1912 and 1940 time periods,
CWM LDMC increased on average 8% (0.03 mg mg-1) in ungrazed
quadrats. CWM foliar Nmass was lower in ungrazed than grazed quad-
rats from 1920 onwards, decreasing on average 11% (0.17% N) in
ungrazed quadrats between the 1912 and 1940 time periods. CWM
SLA was lower in ungrazed than grazed quadrats from 1930 onwards,

DISTLM results for functional group composition and for abundance of each functional
group. “Covariates” refers to the combined effects of ponderosa pine basal area, percent
sand, and elevation. “Grazing” refers to whether a quadrat is inside or outside the
exclosures built in 1912. Each time period was analyzed separately. The overall R2 value
is reported in all cases, but the results (pseudo-F statistic, P-value, partial R2) for covari-
ates and the grazing term are reported only if the overall model is signiﬁcant (α =
0.05). P-values ≤0.05 are highlighted in bold. Models that were not signiﬁcant are indi-
cated by “NS.”

decreasing on average 8% (1.0 mm2 mg-1) in ungrazed quadrats be-
tween the 1912 and 1940 time periods. Although CWM height in-
creased 16% in ungrazed quadrats between 1912 and 1940, no
differences between grazing treatments were detected. Similarly,
CWM plant seed mass was unaffected by grazing treatment.
Discussion
Protection from continuous (May through October) heavy live-
stock grazing resulted in changes in species composition, functional
group composition, and functional traits in the understory ﬂora of
this ponderosa pine–bunchgrass ecosystem. Our results suggest
that the herbaceous plant community responds within 1–2 decades
of protection from heavy grazing by altering its functional group
composition and some CWM functional traits; changes in species
composition and species richness were not evident until after 2–3 de-
cades. By combining a trait-based approach with analyses of commu-
nity composition and functional group composition, we gained a
more comprehensive understanding of how these understory plant
communities respond when protected from continuous heavy live-
stock grazing.
Functional Traits
SLA, foliar Nmass, and LDMC represent aboveground traits associ-
ated with tradeoffs between resource acquisition and conservation
and between growth and defense (Westoby, 1998; Díaz et al.,
2001). Westoby (1999) proposed that under heavy nonselective graz-
ing, high SLA should be favored, whereas low SLA should be favored at
moderate to low stocking rates. Our results support this hypothesis:
Protection from heavy grazing led to a shift toward more conservative
leaf traits (low SLA, low foliar Nmass, and high LDMC). Other research
in grasslands around the world has shown similar patterns
(Cingolani et al., 2005; Louault et al., 2005; Wesuls et al., 2012;
Moreno García et al., 2014). A community-level shift in ungrazed
communities toward reduced acquisition and increased conservation

of nutrients and dry mass would suggest a greater accumulation of
litter due to slower rates of decomposition (Garnier et al., 2004;
Kazakou et al., 2006; Laughlin et al., 2010). Therefore changes in
livestock grazing pressure can alter ecosystem functioning be-
cause community-level litter quality inﬂuences the below-
ground decomposer subsystem (Wardle and Bardgett, 2004).
Because traits were weighted by relative abundance, changes in
traits reﬂect changes in the dominant species, particularly C4
graminoids. Most of the graminoids in our system can be character-
ized as long-lived perennial species that allocate a relatively small
proportion of their energy to reproduction and produce litter with
lower rates of decomposition (Bazzaz et al., 1987; Laughlin et al.,
2010). Species aligned with this strategy are at a competitive advan-
tage when protected from heavy grazing because they are able to re-
duce resource availability. Conversely, species with the opposite
strategy (high SLA, high foliar Nmass, and low LDMC) are at a compet-
itive advantage in heavily grazed areas because they can more rapidly
acquire nutrients and regrow after disturbance. In grasslands of
Argentina and Israel, grazing-resistant species have higher SLA than
grazing-susceptible species (Díaz et al., 2001).
Westoby (1999) proposed that taller species should decrease
with increasing grazing pressure. We found a tendency for vegeta-
tive height to be greater in communities protected from heavy
grazing, though this difference was not statistically signiﬁcant. Al-
though a number of studies have shown an increase in taller
plants with a decrease in grazing pressure (Dyksterhuis, 1949;
Noy-Meir et al., 1989; Díaz et al., 2006; Golodets et al., 2009),
our results are in line with Wesuls et al. (2012) who found no sig-
niﬁcant grazing response for vegetative height. This can be attrib-
uted in part to the dominance in both areas by C3 and C4
graminoids, which differed minimally in maximum vegetative
height (Table S4; available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.
rama.2015.03.008).
With regard to seed mass, our results agree with work by Garnier
et al. (2007), who found seed mass showed no consistent response
following a reduction in land-use intensity across 11 sites in Europe.
Species that produce larger quantities of smaller seeds should have
higher establishment success in gaps created by heavy grazing
(Westoby, 1999), but we found that CWM seed mass tended to be
higher in heavily grazed quadrats. This can be attributed in part to
heavier-seeded forbs (e.g., Hymenoxys richardsonii [Hook.] Cockerell,
Phlox spp. [L.]); legumes (e.g., Trifolium longipes Nutt.); and grasses
(e.g., Sporobolus interruptus, Elymus elymoides) (Tables S3–S5; avail-
able online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rama.2015.03.008), which
responded positively to heavy grazing over time. Higher average
seed mass in heavily grazed quadrats could also reﬂect the ability of
larger seeded species to better tolerate defoliation (Armstrong and
Westoby, 1993).
Species Richness and Composition
We found limited support for our hypothesis that communities
protected from heavy grazing would have a higher number of species
because only those species that were able to tolerate or avoid grazing
would occupy grazed quadrats. Areas protected from heavy livestock
grazing tended to have greater species richness throughout the study
period, though this difference was not statistically signiﬁcant until
the 1940 time period. It is possible this delayed response is due to
slow recruitment of additional species into the study areas after
heavy grazing. The slower response in terms of richness than abun-
dance of speciﬁc functional groups is similar to the pattern observed
in restored ponderosa pine forests, where richness did not differ for a
decade (Laughlin et al., 2008), whereas standing crops responded in
just a few years (Moore et al., 2006).
Species composition and diversity also responded to protection,
but more slowly than functional group or CWM traits. On the basis
of Arnold’s (1955) life form stages, Clary (1975) suggested that
100 yr may be required for full recovery from a denuded stage to a
bunchgrass stage under reduced grazing pressure. Pearson (1942)
found that clipping to 2 in for 10 yr had little impact on overall grass
cover. Lacking direct evidence for understory reference conditions, it
is difﬁcult to know what it means for these herbaceous understory
communities to “fully recover.” Although this system is assumed not
to have evolved with grazing (Milchunas, 2006), both the semiarid en-
vironment and presence of species that can withstand grazing
(i.e., Bouteloua gracilis and Sporobolus interruptus [blue grama and
black dropseed, respectively]; short-statured, sod-forming C4
graminoids) are thought to confer a degree of grazing resistance
(Milchunas et al., 1988) and can help to explain the subtle composi-
tional and functional trait differences found between treatments.
Inﬂuence of Covariates
The effects of excluding heavy grazing were determined after
accounting for environmental controls, which were generally strong.
Elevation, soil physical (texture) properties, and tree basal area are
good predictors of herbaceous understory community composition
(Bakker and Moore, 2007; Laughlin and Abella, 2007) and trait distri-
butions (Shipley et al., 2011; Laughlin et al., 2011). On the basis of R2
values, the importance of excluding heavy grazing increased with
time for CWM traits while the inﬂuence of covariates remained con-
stant. However, this was not generally the case for community or
functional group composition, where the inﬂuence of grazing
remained relatively constant while the importance of covariates
tended to increase. Given that elevation and soils were constant,
the changing importance of the covariates must reﬂect the increase
in tree basal area throughout the study period.
Total basal cover declined substantially from 1930–1940 and did
so in both grazed and ungrazed quadrats. Typically, we would attri-
bute this response to the pulse of ponderosa pine regeneration (in-
crease basal area) in northern Arizona in the 1930s and 1940s
(Arnold, 1950; and see Fig. 1). However, it should be noted that Ar-
nold (1950) showed a similar decrease in graminoid basal cover on
a subset of quadrats that were not inﬂuenced by pine regeneration
from 1912–1941. Other factors that were not analyzed in this study
may also have contributed to this decline in graminoid cover in 1940.
Management Implications
Anticipating plant community responses to disturbance and land-
use change is a primary objective of rangeland ecology. The results
from this study provide an important long-term perspective on
plant community responses to protection from heavy grazing and
provide insight into the speed at which managers will be able to
detect changes in plant communities following a change in man-
agement. Our results indicate that managers should expect to ob-
serve more rapid changes in functional group composition than in
species composition and species richness following protection
from continuous heavy grazing.
Our results also indicate that managers can anticipate changes in
leaf functional traits within plant communities following a change in
grazing management. Species with low SLA, low foliar Nmass, and
high LDMC will become increasingly more abundant in sites
protected from heavy grazing. These species can be characterized as
slow-growing perennial species that allocate a relatively small pro-
portion of their energy to reproduction and produce litter that de-
composes slowly (Reich et al., 1997; Wright et al., 2004). These
ﬁndings contribute to a growing body of evidence that there are
263

consistent shifts in community-level leaf traits under a variety of
grazing regimens around the world (Louault et al., 2005; Laliberté
et al., 2012; Wesuls et al., 2012; Moreno García et al., 2014). Species
with low SLA are at a competitive advantage when protected from
heavy grazing because they are able to reduce resource availability.
Conversely, under heavy grazing, species with high SLA are at a com-
petitive advantage in grazed areas because they can more rapidly ac-
quire nutrients and regrow after disturbance. Consistent trait-based
responses indicate that these results are generalizable across species
and ecosystems. Managers can utilize these results by anticipating
similar community-level responses to protection from heavy grazing
across a variety of rangeland types. Although our ﬁndings support a
more generalizable understanding of plant community response to
grazing
on
the
basis
of
functional
trait
differences,
our
inferences are limited to rangelands where grazing intensity is
heavy. More research is needed within contrasting grazing regimens
to develop a more comprehensive understanding of trait-based re-
sponses to grazing.
