Abstract—Potential fire behavior was compared under dry, windy
weather conditions in 12 ponderosa pine stands treated with alter-
native thinning prescriptions in the wildland/urban interface of
Flagstaff, Arizona. Prior to thinning, stands averaged 474 trees/
acre, 158 ft2/acre basal area, crown bulk density 0.0045 lb/ft3, and
crown base height 19.2 ft. Three thinning treatments differing in
residual tree density were applied to each of three stands (total of
nine treated, three control). Treatments were based on historic
forest structure prior to Euro-American settlement and disruption
of the frequent fire regime (circa 1876). Thinning reduced stand
densities 77–88 percent, basal areas 35–66 percent, crown bulk
densities 24–48 percent, and raised crown base height an average of
11 ft. Before thinning, simulated fire behavior under the 97th
percentile of June fire weather conditions was predicted to be
intense but controllable (5.4 ft flame lengths). However, active or
passive crownfires were simulated using crown base heights in the
lowest quintile (20 percent) or winds gusting to 30 mph, represent-
ing the fuel ladders and wind gusts that are important for initiating
crown burning. Under the identical conditions after thinning, all
three treatments resisted crown burning. The degree of resistance
was related to thinning intensity. It is crucial to remove thinning
slash fuels through prescribed burning or other means. If not
removed, slash fuels can cause crownfire behavior in the thinned
stands under severe wildfire conditions. Finally, the crownfire
resistance achieved through thinning will deteriorate over time
unless maintenance burning and/or thinning is continued.
Introduction ____________________
Flagstaff, Arizona, is located at the northwestern end of
the largest contiguous ponderosa pine forest in the world.
Increased fire intensity and severity are major concerns
around Flagstaff and generally in southwestern ponderosa
pine forests (Swetnam and Betancourt 1998), due to the
regional increase in surface and canopy fuels following a

century or more of fire exclusion and other human-caused
disruptions of ecological processes (Cooper 1960; Covington
and others 1994). In 1996, the two largest wildfires in the
history of the Coconino National Forest burned a few miles
north of Flagstaff. Seeking to prevent such fires from
burning into developed areas, a collaborative group called
the Grand Canyon Forests Partnership was formed to
restore ecosystem health, reduce catastrophic fires, and
improve economic benefits and management on public
lands (GCFP 1998).
Tree thinning, prescribed burning, and/or other fuel re-
duction methods can reduce the hazard of intense fires (for
example, Van Wagtendonk 1996; Graham and others 1999;
Agee and others 2000). Using these techniques to restore a
regime of frequent, low-intensity fires and tree structures
approximating the relatively open presettlement forest
stands should, in theory, simultaneously address the
Partnership’s goals. These treatments have potential for
improving ecosystem health (Kolb and others 1994), reduc-
ing fire hazard (Covington and others 1997), and offering
some economic benefits through forest product removal
(Larson and Mirth 1998). Actually achieving this array of
outcomes in complex ecosystems and social systems is diffi-
cult, requiring choices among competing interests. For ex-
ample, Scott (1998a) compared the economic, aesthetic,
ecological, and fire behavior tradeoffs of a set of alternative
fuel treatments in a western Montana ponderosa pine forest.
Kalabokidis and Omi (1998) carried out a similar analysis in
a Colorado lodgepole pine forest.
The Grand Canyon Forests Partnership’s initial wildland/
urban interface experimental treatments were started in
1998 in cooperation with the Coconino National Forest and
Rocky Mountain Research Station. The experiments had
multiple objectives, but our focus in this paper is only on the
treatment effects on potential fire behavior. The greatest
concern in the wildland/urban interface is crownfire, both
“passive” crownfire (tree torching) and “active” crownfire
(fire spreading through the canopy). Crownfires spread
rapidly (Rothermel 1991), resist control by hand crews and
often mechanical or aerial equipment (Pyne and others
1996), and threaten structures with intense heat and fire-
brand showers (Cohen 2000).
Several complementary actions can improve the ability of
communities to resist fire hazards to lives and property,
including enhanced firefighting resources, improved access
routes and rural address systems, heightened public aware-
ness, reduction of structure flammability (Cohen 2000), and
reduction of forest susceptibility to crownfire. The forest
treatments discussed here address this latter factor. Local

initiatives are under way to enhance other fire-resistance
factors in the Flagstaff wildland/urban interface.
Until recently, fire behavior modeling tools such as BE-
HAVE (Andrews 1986) simulated only surface fire behavior.
New tools such as FARSITE (Finney 1998) and Nexus (Scott
1999) have greatly increased the ease with which many
aspects of crownfire behavior can be modeled and compared.
It is important not to attach too much specificity to crownfire
behavior predictions: the fundamental reason that crownfire
modeling has advanced slowly is that crownfires are rare
and occur in extraordinarily complex weather and fuel
environments (Rothermel 1991). With caveats, however,
simulations provide useful insights into the relative differ-
ences between treatments and the relative sensitivity of
crownfire behavior to different variables.
From previous simulations with FARSITE and Nexus, as
well as from literature results (Van Wagtendonk 1996;
Scott 1998a,b), we recognized that simulations often re-
sulted in outputs that appeared contrary to actual wildfire
experience. In particular, simulated fires using our fuel
and weather conditions proved nearly impossible to crown
using realistic data, even though real fires had crowned
under similar or even less severe conditions. One possible
solution was to manipulate model output with adjustment
factors. However, this method is unsatisfactory for model-
ers and their audiences, who would prefer to use well-
supported numbers.
We tried a different approach. Both with weather and fuel
data, we reasoned that “average” conditions were a misrep-
resentation of the real forest situation. For instance, to cross
the threshold into tree torching, surface flame lengths must
preheat the branches and leaves close to the bottom of the
crown. Achieving this transition in simulations has been
difficult because the average crown base height is often a
relatively high value (15–30 ft). The fuel ladders, surface
fuel jackpots, and wind gusts that facilitate the transition to
the crown in real fires are not accounted for when uniform
averages are used.
Taking the variability of the data into account could help
simulate more realistic fire behavior, but which fraction of
the variability is important? A single low crown is probably
insufficient to initiate a crownfire, but crownfires can start
and be sustained in strong winds even with much less than
50 percent of the stand in a crownfire-susceptible condition.
We chose to rank the data by quintiles—20 percent groups—
and compare fire behavior and treatment effects on both the
stand averages and the susceptible quintiles, suggesting
that the fire behavior in the vulnerable quintiles may be
important in triggering intense fires.
Methods _______________________
Treatments
The Grand Canyon Forests Partnership chose to compare
three treatments differing in residual tree density. All treat-
ments were based on the presettlement pattern of tree
structure as inferred from: (1) living trees of presettlement
origin, characterized by larger size and yellowed bark (White
1985; Covington and Moore 1994), and (2) remnant material
from snags, logs, and stumps of presettlement origin, which
were well-conserved in the dry environment in the absence
of fire (Dieterich 1980; Fulé and others 1997; Covington and
others 1997; Mast and others 1999). All living presettlement
trees were retained. In addition, wherever evidence of rem-
nant presettlement material was encountered, several of the
largest postsettlement trees within 30 ft were retained as
replacements. If suitable trees were not found within 30 ft,
the search radius was extended to 60 ft. The three thinning
treatments each had a different replacement tree density:
• 1.5-3 replacements: replace each remnant with 1.5 trees
(in other words, 3 replacements per every 2 remnants)
if the replacements were 16 inches d.b.h. or larger,
otherwise replace each remnant with 3 trees. Because
relatively few greater than 16 inches postsettlement
trees were encountered in any of the sites, all the
thinning treatments tended to retain the higher num-
ber of replacement. The 1.5-3 treatment, called “full
restoration,” reduced tree density most closely to pre-
settlement levels.
• 2-4 replacements: replace remnants with 2 trees greater
than 16 inches d.b.h., otherwise 4 trees.
• 3-6 replacements: replace remnants with 3 trees greater
than 16 inches d.b.h., otherwise 6 trees.
• Control treatment: no thinning, no burning.
Study Sites
The treatments were tested on three experimental blocks
in or adjacent to the Fort Valley Experimental Forest,
approximately 15 km NW of Flagstaff, Arizona (fig. 1). Each
block contained a 35-acre replicate of each of the three
thinning levels and a control. The study area is at 7,400 ft
elevation with gentle topography and a cool, subhumid
climate (Avery and others 1976). Mean annual precipitation
is 57 cm, with approximately half occurring as snow. The
remainder occurs as summer monsoonal rains following the
spring/early summer drought. Soils are of volcanic origin, a
fine montmorillonitic complex of frigid Typic Argiboroll and
Mollic Eutroboralf (Mast and others 1999). Experimental

blocks were laid out in cooperation with Forest Service staff,
subject to constraints of other experimental studies and
wildlife habitat. As a result, the treatment units in experi-
mental blocks 1 and 2 could not be contiguous. All treat-
ments were randomly assigned.
The timing and method of treatment differed in the experi-
mental blocks due to economic constraints, primarily the
very low value of the material removed, and to the
Partnership’s intention to make the site available to differ-
ent operators. Thinning of the blocks began in November
1998 and was completed in September 1999. Blocks 1 and 2
were thinned with a mechanical feller and limbed at the tree,
resulting in broadcast slash fuels. Block 3 was thinned in a
whole-tree harvesting operation, resulting in slash piles.
Piles in block 3 were burned in February 2000. All blocks
were scheduled for broadcast burning in the spring or fall
2000.
Measurements
Twenty experimental block (EB) plots were established on
a 60-m grid in each of the 12 units. Plot centers were
permanently marked with iron stakes at ground level and
slope and aspect were recorded. Overstory trees over breast
height (bh, 4.5 ft) were measured on a 0.1 acre (37 ft radius)
circular fixed-area plot. Species, condition (1-living, 2-de-
clining, 3-recent snag, 4-loose bark snag, 5-clean snag, 6-
snag broken above bh, 7-snag broken below bh, 8-downed, 9-
cut stump), and d.b.h., were recorded for all live and dead
trees over breast height, as well as for stumps and downed
trees that surpassed breast height while alive. Tree heights
and average crown base height per plot were measured.
Trees below breast height and shrubs were tallied by condi-
tion class and by three height classes (0–15.7, 15.8–31.5, and
31.6–54 inches) on a nested 0.025 acre (18.5 ft radius)
subplot. Shrubs over breast height were also measured.
Herbaceous plants and canopy cover (vertical projection)
were measured along a 164-ft line transect oriented up- and
down-slope. Point intercept measurements were recorded
every 11.8 inches along each transect. Dead woody biomass
and forest floor material were measured on a 50 ft planar
transect in a random direction from each plot center. Fuels
were measured by diameter/moisture timelag classes (1H
timelag = 0–0.25 inch diameter, 10H = 0.25–1 inch, 100 H =
1–3 inches, 1000H = over 3 inches, sound (S) and rotten (R)
categories). Woody debris biomass was calculated using
procedures in Brown (1974) and Sackett (1980). Forest floor
depth measurements were converted to loading (Mg/ha)
using equations from Ffolliott and others (1976). Plots were
originally measured from August through November 1998.
After thinning, preburn fuels were measured on the same
transects in October 1999.
Modeling
Fire behavior was modeled with the Nexus Fire Behavior
and Hazard Assessment System (Scott and Reinhardt 1999).
As described by Scott (1998a, 1999), Nexus integrates mod-
els of surface fire behavior (Rothermel 1972) with crown fire
transition (Van Wagner 1977) and crown fire spread
(Rothermel 1991). Nexus is similar to the landscape fire
behavior modeling program FARSITE (Finney 1998) in that
both link the same set of surface and crownfire models.
However, Nexus is better suited for comparing fire hazards
under alternative conditions because environmental and
fuel factors are kept constant for each simulation, rather
than changing continuously with time and location, as in
FARSITE.
Custom fire behavior fuel models were developed and
tested with the NEWMDL and TSTMDL modules of BE-
HAVE (Andrews 1986). Pretreatment fuel models were
modified from the standard fire behavior fuel model 9,
“hardwood litter” (Anderson 1982). Postthinning fuel mod-
els were modified from standard model 11, “light slash.”
Future fuels, after thinning and burning, are likely to have
reduced woody fuel loads and increased herbaceous fuels. A
hypothetical future fuel model was developed by modifying
standard model 2, “timber (grass and understory).” The
predicted future herbaceous fuel load was 200 lbs/acre,
based on a basal area/herbaceous production relationship
developed in northern Arizona (Brown and others 1974).
Crown fuels were estimated with locally developed allom-
etric equations for ponderosa pine shown in table 1. Crown
volume was estimated using averages of maximum tree
height (top of the canopy) and crown base height (bottom of
the canopy). Crown bulk density was calculated as crown
biomass divided by crown volume. This procedure is straight-
forward and appears to adequately represent the canopy
fuels actually available in a ponderosa pine crown fire.
Alternative methods of crown fuel estimation can lead to
substantially different numerical values, so density values
in different studies may not be directly comparable. The
situation is further complicated by the relatively high sensi-
tivity of crownfire behavior modeling to canopy bulk density.
Fire weather extremes representing the 90th and 97th
percentiles of low fuel moisture, high winds, and high tem-
perature were calculated from 30 years of data on the
Coconino National Forest using the FireFamily Plus pro-
gram (Bradshaw and Brittain 1999). Weather values were
calculated for the entire fire season (April 23 to October 16)
as well as for June, historically the month with the most
severe fire weather (table 2). Fire behavior information from
the two largest wildfires on the Coconino, the 1996 Horse-
shoe (May) and Hochderffer (June) fires, was used to esti-
mate wind gusts during periods of extreme fire behavior

(McCoy 1996). Wind gusts to 40 mph and sustained winds of
30 mph were observed on these fires. The 30-year fire
weather record also shows that winds of 30 mph or more
were recorded in the 1,300 hours observation on approxi-
mately 1 percent of June days.
Results ________________________
Prior to treatment, forest structural conditions were simi-
lar across the study sites (table 3). Basal area ranged from
148.5 to 167.7 ft2/acre, while tree density was more variable
(386.7 to 603.9 trees/acre). Average stand heights were
within 7 ft of each other across the sites (67.2 to 73.9 ft) and
average crown base heights were within approximately 4 ft
(17.4 to 21.5 ft). Crown bulk density values averaged 0.064
to 0.083 kg/m3, similar to values reported by Scott (1998a) in
a Montana ponderosa forest. Thinning reduced tree density
and biomass most strongly in the full restoration (1.5-3)
treatment and least in the 3-6 treatment, as expected.
Postthinning densities ranged from 56.8 to 98.3 trees/acre,
an average reduction of over 396 trees/acre (77 percent to 88
percent of trees removed). Because the largest trees were
retained, however, basal area and crown biomass decreased
by much smaller proportions. Postthinning basal area ranged
from 44 percent to 65 percent of pretreatment values. Thin-
ning reduced crown bulk density to 52 percent to 76 percent
of pretreatment values. Crown base height was raised an
average of 11 ft and the lowest quintile (20 percent) of crown
base height was raised an average of 10.6 ft from 8.5 ft before
thinning to 19.1 ft after thinning. Pretreatment surface
fuels averaged 25.4 tons/acre, but the quintile (20 percent) of
plots with the heaviest loading of less than 1000H fuels
averaged 38.2 tons/acre (table 4). Postthinning fuels were
surprisingly similar between the broadcast slash blocks
(11 tons/acre of less than 1000H fuels) and the whole-tree
harvested block (7.2 tons/acre of less than 1000H fuels).
However, the primary difference was an extra 3.9 tons/acre
of 1H fuels in the broadcast blocks, the fuel component most
strongly influencing fire behavior. The broadcast blocks did
have 80 percent more heavy fuel (more than 1000H and duff)
loading, 18 versus 10 tons/acre. Burnout of these heavy fuels
would be expected to lead to increased canopy and soil
heating in the broadcast blocks after the passage of the
flaming front.
Fires modeled in pretreatment conditions using the aver-
age stand values for crown bulk density and crown base
height remained surface fires (table 5) even under the severe
Table 3—Forest stand structure and crown fuels at the Fort Valley study sites. See text for description of
treatments. Prior to thinning, the lowest quintile of crown base heights averaged 8.5 feet. After
thinning, the lowest quintile of crown base heights in the treated units averaged 19.1 feet.

fire weather conditions represented by the June 97th percen-
tile (table 2). Fire behavior outputs were virtually identical
across treatments prior to treatment, with only slight differ-
ences in the torching index (an estimate of the windspeed
required to initiate tree torching or “passive” crown fire
behavior) and the crowning index (an estimate of the
windspeed required to support “active” fire spreading through
the crown). The minor fluctuations in these two indices
reflected the small differences in crown base height (impor-
tant for the transition from surface fire to torching) and
canopy bulk density (important for sustaining active
crownfire). The torching index showed that a wind of at least
45 mph would have been needed to cause passive crownfire.
If fire were already in the crown or entered from outside the
stand, a windspeed of 28–34 mph would have sufficed to
sustain active canopy burning. However, both indices were
above the modeled 25 mph windspeed.
The simulated flame lengths, 5.4 ft, would have precluded
direct attack by firefighters but mechanized equipment or
indirect attack would have a high likelihood of successful
suppression (Pyne and others 1996). The fact that modeled
fires were amenable to suppression even under severe wild-
fire conditions is an accurate reflection of reality: the over-
whelming majority of wildfires on the Coconino are con-
tained below 10 acres (99.6 percent, fire records 1970–1999).
With 30 mph winds and/or the lowest quintile of crown
base height, however, crownfire was simulated in the pre-
treatment sites. Keeping the crown base height at the
average values but increasing wind to 30 mph led to condi-
tional crownfire behavior (crownfire won’t start, but could be
sustained if it entered from outside the stand) in the stand
with the highest crown bulk density. Lowering the crown
base height to 8.5 ft, the average of the lowest pretreatment
quintile, caused active or passive crownfire in all the sites
at both the 25 and 30 mph windspeeds (table 5). Because
30 mph or higher wind gusts occur, and because at least
one-fifth of the modeled forest is vulnerable to crownfire,
these results may bridge the apparent contradiction be-
tween observed crownfire behavior and the unrealistically
high windspeeds required for simulated crownfires using
average stand characteristics.
Thinning treatments substantially reduced fire behavior
under the same environmental circumstances. As shown in
table 5, with the identical 30 mph wind and the lowest
quintile of posttreatment crown base height, the simulated
fire did not achieve any category of crown burning. All three
treatments had the same torching index (49 mph) but the
crowning index differed with canopy bulk density. The
modeled 3-6 treatment could support conditional crownfire
at windspeeds as low as 40 mph, while the modeled 1.5-3
treatment required 58 mph, 45 percent higher.
Although the comparison in table 4 shows a clear change
in fire behavior due to the restoration treatments, the
postthinning fuels are different than the pretreatment fuels.
As the treatments progress, the slash fuels created by
thinning are scheduled to be removed by prescribed burning.
Mechanical means could also be used. But as long as these
fuels remain in the stand, they present a threat of intense
fire behavior. Active or passive fires crowned in all the
simulated stands, including the treated sites, using either the
broadcast or the whole-tree harvest slash fuel models in
table 4. With standard fuel model 11, however, the control had
active crownfire but the treated stands had only surface fires.
Fire behavior in future fuels, after removal of the slash,
will probably be influenced by a higher herbaceous compo-
nent. Under the hypothetical model presented in table 4,
with 30 mph winds and the lowest quintile of crown base
height, conditional crown fire was predicted for the control
stands and surface fire for all the treated stands.
Discussion _____________________
Model results should always be applied cautiously. Cur-
rent models that link surface and crownfire behavior are
highly sensitive to crown base height, windspeed (or wind
reduction factor), fuel moisture, and surface fuel model
variables (1H fuel loading, herbaceous fuels, surface-area-
to-volume ratio, fuel bed depth). We held slope constant at 7
percent (the average slope of the experimental blocks) but
similar fuels on steeper slopes would exhibit higher fire
intensity. There are a number of uncertainties in the models
integrated in Nexus, reflecting the complexity of fire behav-
ior (Scott 1998b). The actual numerical values used for
model inputs produced realistic predictions but in some
instances the differences between crown and surface fire
behavior were separated by only a few miles/hr of windspeed
(table 5). If wind gusts of higher speeds or higher surface fuel
loadings were encountered, portions of the stands would be
more likely to exhibit crownfire behavior. The behavior of
real fires in these stands would be affected by roads, mead-
ows, surrounding forest fuels, landscape topography, and
suppression activities.
The purpose of the modeling analysis was not to accu-
rately estimate the behavior of a real fire but rather to
compare the treatment alternatives. All three thinning
treatments tested by the Grand Canyon Forests Partner-
ship substantially reduced the potential for passive and
active crownfire. All the treatments increased crown base
height to nearly 30 ft, making passive crownfire initiation
difficult. However, the different thinning levels in the three
treatments created differences in crown bulk density that
were reflected in the potential for active crownfire. Prior to
treatment, the crowning indices of all the stands were
separated by only 6 mph (top section of table 5). After
treatment (bottom of table 5), the crowning index ranged
from 28 mph (control stands), 40 mph (3-6 treatment), 47
mph (2-4 treatment), to 55 mph (1.5-3 treatment). In relative
terms, taking the control crowning index as unity, the 3-6
treatment required 43 percent more windspeed, the 2-4
treatment required 68 percent more windspeed, and the 1.5-
3 treatment required nearly double (96 percent) more
windspeed, for active crownfire.
The restoration treatment is not complete when the thin-
ning is finished. Slash fuels increase the fire hazard as long
as they remain on the ground, so prompt treatment with
prescribed fire or mechanical means is important. Over
time, vegetation in the treated units will change as both
herbaceous plants and trees respond to the thinning. The
potential intensity of grass-fueled fires should not be under-
estimated. Stand basal area even in the full restoration
stands remained high enough to limit predicted herbaceous
production to approximately 200 lbs/acre. If herbaceous

production in the treated stands reached the 1,000 lbs/acre
in the standard fire behavior fuel model 2, passive crownfire
was predicted in the lowest crown base quintile for all
treatments under severe weather conditions. However, grass
fuels would be unlikely to have reached full productivity or
to be fully cured in June. Even with a high fireline intensity,
grass fires are of short duration with few heavy fuels and are
more amenable to control than timber fires.
Strictly from a fire control perspective, therefore, a bal-
ance of relatively more trees and relatively less grass, such
as the 2-4 or 3-6 treatments, might be useful in areas close
to homes. On the other hand, future fire behavior will also be
influenced by the growth of residual trees and new regenera-
tion. Treatments with relatively high residual density might
more rapidly grow back into a hazardous condition. Mainte-
nance burning and/or further thinning can be used to regu-
late growth and keep the stands relatively crownfire-resis-
tant. The failure to carry out these management activities
would eventually eliminate the original treatment effects on
fire behavior.
Potential fire behavior is an important consideration in
the design of wildland/urban interface forest treatments,
but it is not the only consideration. Fire hazard tradeoffs
should be recognized and evaluated against many other
forest values. In the present analysis, we have incorporated
some of the variability in fuels and weather. A more com-
plete analysis, however, could include spatial variability
within stands and across landscapes, temporal variability
(diurnal to seasonal change), successional change (years to
centuries), and predicted changes in land use. In addition to
modeling intensity and behavior of the flaming front, the
effects of fuel burnout and smoke production should be
considered. Many of the tools and components of such a
comprehensive analysis are being rapidly improved.
