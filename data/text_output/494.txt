Abstract: Penstemon clutei, a rare perennial beard tongue endemic to the ponderosa pine forest
of the Sunset Crater volcanic field of northern Arizona, presents an opportunity to test the
hypothesis that restoration of historic ecosystem conditions may enhance the sustainability of
a rare species. We tested prescribed burning and root trenching treatments as proxies for the
surface fires and reduced tree densities characteristic of historic ponderosa pine ecosystems
in a study area at O'Leary Peak, part of the Sunset Crater volcanic field (Coconino National
Forest, AZ). Prescribed burning killed many mature P. clutei plants and negatively affected
density for at least 3 years post-burn. In contrast, trenching to cut root competition of over-
story trees led to a 1200 percent increase in P. Glutei plants. Precipitation influenced the re-
sponse. Seed germination experiments showed that P. Glutei does not have innate dormancy.
Germination rates in the lab ranged from 5 to 70 percent under a range of environmental and
fire-related conditions (i.e., cold stratification, light, exposure to ash, NH4), but these factors
were not statistically significant. Tested seedling establishment rates in situ were very low
(0.4%). These experiments suggest that the observed P. Glutei population increase following
severe wildfires (1973 Burnt fire, 1996 Hochderffer fire) may have been due primarily to the
removal of tree competition rather than to direct fire effects. Further experimentation is sug-
gested to develop ecological information for thoughtful integration of ecosystem restoration
with the habitat needs of rare plants.
Rare plant species present fundamental challenges
for the management of forest ecosystems. Conser-
vation of native biological diversity is central to
management of public resources, as mandated by
the Endangered Species Act and other legislation,
but often little is known about the ecology of rare
species (National Plant Conservation Initiative,
1995). The very fact of rarity limits our ability to
adequately sample or experimentally study spe-
cies to obtain the types of ecological information
needed to support management decisions (Palmer
1987, Owen and Rosentreter 1992). In the absence
of information, the conservative position is to
minimize management action in the hopes of
avoiding habitat degradation. This approach may
be the best we can do in many settings, but it may
be useless or even counterproductive in others.
Many ecosystems are currently in conditions far
removed from the structural and disturbance
patterns characteristic of the environment in which
native species evolved. These altered conditions
may be an underlying reason for the present rarity
of some species and perpetuation of these condi-
tions through "no-action" management may unin-
tentionally contribute to further loss of habitat.
Penstemon 
clutei, a rare perennial beardtongue
endemic to the ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)
forest of the Sunset Crater volcanic field of north-
ern Arizona, presents an opportunity to test the
hypothesis that restoration of historic ecosystem
conditions may enhance the sustainability of a rare
species. Changes in ponderosa pine ecosytems
have been well documented (Weaver 1951, Cooper
1960, Covington and Moore 1994, Arno et al. 1995,
Swetnam and Baisan 1996, Fule et al. 1997, Moore
et al. 1999). Briefly, the historic regime of frequent
low-intensity 
fires was disrupted by livestock
grazing and fire suppression beginning around
1870-1880. Extensive timber harvesting and snag
cutting removed a major fraction of the old-
growth trees, but dense stands of young trees form
continuous fuels across landscapes and vertically
within stands. Heavy tree competition causes
reduced productivity and increased mortality of
old-growth trees (Biondi 1996, Stone et al. 1999,
Mast et al. 1999) and reduced understory plant
productivity (Riegel et al. 1995, Covington et al.
1997), and affects a host of ecosystem attributes
including nutrient cycling and wildlife habitat
(Covington et al. 1997). Wildfire size, intensity
(crownfires), and severity (overs tory and under-
story mortality) have increased throughout the
ponderosa pine range (Swetnam and Betancourt
1998). As a result, the restoration of historic eco-

and Phillips et al. (1980) described the habitat of P.
clutei as limited to about 65 sq km in the cinder
hills around Sunset Crater on soils covered with
up to 25 cm of raw volcanic cinders of alkaline
olivine basalt formed in the most recent volcanic
eruption 
(A.D. 1046). An apparently disjunct
population is located in cinder hills around Indian
Flat, about 20 km northwest of Sunset Crater.
Penstemon clutei is distributed in patches, with the
greatest occurrence in areas of sparse herbaceous
vegetation, past logging disturbance (stumps, skid
trails), and recently killed snags (Phillips et al.
1992, Crisp 1996). The dominant vegetation is
ponderosa pine, with scattered Pinus edulis and
Juniperus osteosperma. Understory species com-
monly associated with P. clutei include Chryso-
thamnus nauseosus, Fallugia paradoxa, Penstemon
barbatus, and Verbascum thapsus. An intensive
survey of the southern habitat region by Phillips et
al. (1992) also found Rhus trilobata occurring
frequently with P. clutei, although no associated
species were reliable P. clutei indicators. Because
the age of the oldest P. clutei plants was estimated
at 5 to 10 years, maintenance of a soil seed bank
could be important for the regeneration of such
short-lived plants (Phillips et al. 1992).. The pres-
ence of a root-boring insect larva that could reduce
the life span of the plants was also noted (Phillips
et al. 1992). Pollination by both hummingbirds and
bees has been observed in P. clutei (Phillips et al.
1980) and the closely related P. pseudospectabilis
{Reid et al. 1988, Lange and Scott 1999). Phillips et
al. (1992) summarized the legal protection history
and status of P. cluteii.it is currently considered a
sensitive species with the USDA Forest Service
(Arizona Game and Fish Department 1997).
The experimental studies described here were
conducted on Coconino National Forest lands at
O'Leary Peak, adjacent to Sunset Crater National
Monument (Figure 1). The elevation of the study
area is approximately 2100 m. Soils are cindery
and deep, well-drained Vitrandic Ustochrepts and
Typic Ustorthents (USDA Forest Service 1995).
Weather records from Sunset Crater National
Monument, 1 km south of the study area, show a
bimodal precipitation pattern typical of southwest-
ern forests. Annual precipitation averages 43.9 cm
(1969-1993), occurring in winter and during the
summer monsoon Guly-September),but precipita-
tion has varied widely in recent decades from 23.6
from residual seed or seed rain from surviving
plants, rather than from buried seed populations.
In an investigation of the regeneration of several
understory species following 
fire in California
chaparral, Keeley et al. (1985) distinguished sever-
al reproductive strategies. Herbaceous perennials
tended to resprout, whereas annuals divided into
an opportunistic class with varying germination
requirements and a fire-dependent class that dis-
played strong germination response to heat or the
presence of charred wood (Keeley et al. 1985).
In 1997, after evaluating negative results from
the prescribed burning 
experiment described
below, we investigated the hypothesis that the
vigorous P. clutei responses seen after the Burnt
and Hochderffer fires and the 1992 tornado were
due to the mortality of overs tory trees, thereby
removing root competition. 
Competition 
with
overstory vegetation may affect understory plants
either through light interception or through the
relatively greater ability of trees to extract water
and nutrients from the soil. Southwestern ponde-
rosa pine forests have relatively open canopies
(40-65% canopy cover by vertical projection at
sites across northern Arizona, Fule et at. 1997 and
unpublished data). Riegel et al. (1995) tested the
effects of light versus root competition on under-
story species composition and cover in an Oregon
ponderosa pine forest. Both factors were signifi-
cant, but trenching to remove tree root competi-
tion increased the cover and density of 60 percent
more understory species than in the canopy-
reduction treatment (Riegel et al. 1995).
From 1992 to 2000, we conducted the follow-
ing studies on P. clutei: (1) We measured germina-
tion response to a variety of environmental factors
in lab and field settings. (2) We tested the hypothe-
sis that prescribed fire would increase P. clutei
density by removing litter and competing vegeta-
tion. (3) We tested the hypothesis that cutting root
competition through trenching would increase P.
clutei density.
Methods
P. clutei was described by Nelson (1927) and
named after the original collector, Willard N.
Clute. The plant was classified as a subspecies of
Perzstemorz 
pseudospectabilis 
by Keck (1937), then
reclassified as an independent species by Clokey
and Keck (1939) who considered it intermediate
between P. pseudospectabilis

mum temperature in January is -110 C and the
average maximum temperature in July is 290 C.
Seed Germination Studies
Seed lots were collected from P. cIutei plants
on May 18 and October 18 in 1993. The May
collection (spring) was from seed capsules that
matured in 1992, and the October collection (fall)
was from 1993 seed. Seeds were collected below
and above 2,290m elevation (low and high eleva-
tion, in the vicinity of O'Leary Peak, Coconino
National Forest). A seed predatory insect was
encountered in 70 percent of seed collections from
20 separate plants in May of 1996. The insect was
identified by the USDA Sytematic Entomology
Laboratory as Kleidocerys ovalis Barber (Hemiptera:
Lygaediae), a seed bug. Subsequent informal
examinations of P. cIutei seed capsules have shown
the bugs to be present every year but at lower
rates of infestation than that observed in 1993.
Two lab germination experiments and a field
seeding trial were conducted. The first lab study
followed a fractional factorial experimental design
for an exploratory test of multiple factors that
were associated with triggering germination in
other fire-adapted plant species. The defining
relation for the 28-2V design was I = ABCDG =
ABEFH = CDEFGH. The alias of any effect can be
found by multiplying the effect by the words in
the defining relation (Montgomery 1984:342), so
the alias structure of C, for example, was C =
ABDG = ABCEF = DEFGH. Study factors at high/
low or presence/absence levels were (a) heat
pulse, 700 C for 5 minutes which mimics low seed-
'bank temperature average from California chapar-
ral (Keeley et al. 1985, Keeley 1987) and New
Jersey grass studies (Cheplick and Quinn 1988); (b)
ammonium-nitrogen, 77 ppm, based on post-fire
NH! concentration in ponderosa pine (Covington
and Sackett 1992); (c) charred litter (Keeley et al.
1985, Keeley 1987); (d) collection elevation, which
is related to genetic diversity; (e) charred P. cIutei
litter; (f) nitrate-nitrogen, 40 ppm, based on post-
fire NO3 concentration in ponderosa pine (Cov-
ington and Sackett 1992); (g) light, 12-hour photo-
period presence/absence (Meyer and Kitchen
1992); and (h) collection date, which is related to
primary dormancy. Groups of 25 P. cIutei seeds
were placed on moistened filter papers in covered
(not sealed) pyrex petri dishes and allowed to
germinate in a Percival growth chamber at 150 C
and 60 percent relative humidity. 
Germinated
seeds were counted and removed weekly for 5
weeks, beginning January 21,1994. Analysis of the
design was done with Yates' algorithm (Mont-
gomery 1984:337). The alpha level for all analyses
was 0.05.
The second lab germination study tested P.
clutei seeds from the four seed lots collected in
1993. Seeds were stored in paper bags at approxi-
mately 20° C until germination tests were con-
ducted in 1997. Germination tests were conducted
in climate-controlled incubators (Percival model
137-11). Five cold stratification periods (0, 30, 60,
90, and 120 days) and two germination tempera-
tures (10 and 70° C) were tested. For cold stratifi-
cation treatments, seeds were soaked in deionized
water for 24 h, drained, placed in plastic bags, and
stored in the dark at 3-4° C for the length of the
treatment period. At the end of the stratification
period, 20-50 seeds were placed in petri dishes on
moistened filter paper. Five dishes were used per
treatment combination (seed lot X stratification X
temperature). Two germination chambers were
used and conditions were set at 30 percent relative
humidity, 10 h of light exposure, and a constant
temperature of either 10 or 20° C.
Seeds were counted every 3 days and the
number of germinated seeds was recorded until
germination was complete (i.e., no additional
seeds germinated between successive counts).
Seeds were considered to have germinated when
emerging radicals reached at least 2 mm in length.
Germination (%) was calculated as the maximum
number of seeds counted per dish divided by the
total number of seeds present. Factorial analysis of
variance (ANOV A) was used to test for main
effects due to stratification 
period and growth
chamber temperature. Analyses were conducted
separately for individual 
seed lots. Data were
square root transformed when necessary to meet
analytical assumptions (normal distribution and
similar variance). Main effects were~ tested at an
alpha level of 0.05.
A field seeding trial was conducted as part of
a mitigation effort for a natural gas pipeline proj-
ect. The factors were disturbance and seeding at
two levels each (presence/absence), applied in a
split-plot design implemented on April 27, 1993,
with 10 blocks consisting of two quadrats of 1 sq
m each in the disturbed right-of-way and two in
the adjacent undisturbed forest. Seeding with 50
stratified seeds was assigned randomly to one
quadrat in each of the disturbed and undisturbed
sites. The blocks were distributed at approximate-
ly 900 m intervals along the 11 km transect where
the pipeline passed through P. clutei habitat. No
143

winds averaged 8.5 km per hour (max 17 kmjh),
and relative humidity decreased slightly from 28
to 27 percent during the burning period. Flame
lengths averaged 34.7 cm, corresponding to an
average fire line intensity of 25.9 kW per m (Agee
1993). The fall burn plots were remeasured on July
10-11,1995. All 120 plots, including spring and fall
bums, were remeasured August 28-September 4,
1996, August 5-7,1997, and August 20-25,1998.
Changes in P. clutei density, species richness,
and fuels were analyzed with repeated measures
analysis of variance (Systat 8.0, SPSS Science, Chi-
cago). Data were square-root transformed to meet
ANOV A assumptions. Community 
data were
assessed with nonrnetric multidimensional scaling,
a nonparametric ordination procedure (PC-Ord
4.0, MjM Software, Gleneden Beach, Oregon).
Indicator values were calculated for individual
species based on relative abundance and relative
frequency. A Monte Carlo procedure with 1000
iterations was used to assess the probability of
encountering indicator values by chance.
seedlings were found on quadrat inventories in
June and September, so the experiment was re-
peated on October 2,1993, using unstratified seeds
from a September, 1993, seed collection along the
pipeline. One hundred seeds per sq m wer~ placed
in new quadrats adjacent to the original locations.
Quadrats were inventoried in June and August of
1994.
To minimize mortality to the species, the role
of vegetative propagation in P. clutei was not
assessed directly. Several dead P. clutei were exca-
vated and found to have long rhizome-like roots.
However, the small "seedling" P. clutei plants
observed on the plots each summer appear~d to be
actual seedlings starting with cotyledons.
Prescribed Burning
An experiment on the effects of prescribed
burning on the P. clutei community was estab-
lished in 1994. Forty P. clutei plant-centered plots
were established between July 29 and August 1 of
1994 at the same sites described for seed collection
in the first germination studie~. Because the sam-
ple plots were centered on existing plants, a tech-
nique often used in rare-plant studies (Travis and
Sutter 1986), all data were calculated in terms of
plants per plot and the actual absolute density of
P. clutei and other species (plants per ha) in the
study sites was unknown. Each plot was a 2.5 m
radius circle (area = 19.6 sq m) centered 0.3 m
northwest of an existing P. clutei plant. All species
were tallied within each plot. P. clutei was tallied
in four categories: seedling, second-year plant,
mature plant, and dead. Field experience indicated
that the distinctions between the living plant cate-
gories were approximate. Fuels were measured on
two perpendicular planar transects established SE-
NW and SW-NE on each plot following the meth-
ods of Brown (1974) and Sackett (1980). Plots were
randomly selected for bum or control treatments.
Burning was conducted on September 26, 1994,
between 9:30 AM and 2:30 PM Temperatures
ranged from 21.1 to 23;90 C, winds averaged 8.5
km per hour (max 13.6 km/h), and relative humid-
ity decreased from 26 to 20 percent during the
burning period. Flame lengths averaged 29.1 cm,
corresponding to an average fireline intensity of
17.7 kW per m (Agee 1993). Bum season effects
were tested on a second experimental site imme-
diately north of the lower elevation fall burning
site. Forty new plots were established April 6-7 of
1995. Twenty 
randomly 
selected plots were
burned on April 27, 1995, between 9:30 and 11:30
AM. Temperatures ranged from 12.8 to 16.1° C,
Belowground Competition
In 1997 (October 1-10) we established eight
new experimental plots within the low-elevation
burning study area, each paired with a nearby
control plot from the original burn experiment.
The below ground effects of tree removal were
simulated by digging a narrow trench approxi-
mately 1 m deep around each plot. Trenches were
located 50 cm outside the plot boundary to avoid
physical disturbance within the measured area
and were lined with plastic sheeting to minimize
tree root regrowth (Milne 1979). Trenches were
backfilled immediately after lining. Plots were re-
measured on August 25, 1998, September 1, 1999,
and August 15, 2000. P. clutei density, species rich-
ness, fuels, and community data were analyzed as
described for the prescribed burning study above.
..
Results
Seed germination in the fractional factorial
experiment ranged from 8 to 80 percent. Analysis
of variance for main effects and two-way inter-
actions indicated that only the pre-existing eleva-
tion and collection date factors were statistically
significant, with fall seeds and high-elevation
seeds germinating best. Tests of statistical signifi-
cance in the fractional factorial design rely on the
assumption that higher-order interactions may be
considered as error, in the absence of a pure error
term, so the ANOV A P values should be treated
with caution. Because the collections were not

percent on the disturbed pipeline quadrats and 0.1
percent on the undisturbed quadrats. These values
were considered too low for meaningful statistical
analysis.
Prescribed Burning
Contrary to expectations, burning caused a
significant decline in P. clutei density, dropping
from an average of 6.5 plants per plot before
burning to 1.6 plants per plot at the end of the first
growing season after the fire, a 75 percent reduc-
tion (Table 1). Season of burning (fall/spring) and
site elevation (low/high) were not significant
factors. P. clutei densities also declined over the
study period in two of the three control sites. The
low-elevation fall control declined by 53 percent
and the low-elevation spring control declined by
75 percent between 1994-95 and 1998. Only the
high-elevation fall control maintained a nearly
constant P. clutei density (2% decline). Coupled
with a recovery of P. clutei densities in the burned
plots, P. clutei densities in burned and control plots
differed by less than 1 plant per plot by 1998, aver-
aging 2.1 and 3.0 plants, respectively. Litter (total
of freshly fallen as well as decomposing material)
declined significantly in the burned plots, with an
average reduction of 2.0 cm, and the litter depth
remained constant through 1998. Species richness
was not significantly affected by the burning
treatment. Plant community ordinations indicated
minor shifts between treatments and years. Burn
treatment plots tended to group together by year,
whereas control plots were generally clustered.
replicated, the identification of "elevation" and
"season" as causal factors of differences between
seed lots is tenuous.
The second germination experiment showed
that cold stratification significantly affected P.
clutei germination for three of the four seed lots
(Figure 1). In all cases, mean germination de-
creased as cold-stratification period increased
from 0 to 120 days. Decreases were most dramatic
for the fall high-elevation collection, which had
consistently higher germination than the other
seed lots under all treatment conditions. Germi-
nation for this lot decreased almost 50 percent as
the stratification period was increased from 0 to
120 days. Although during stratification seeds
were kept in the dark and at temperatures just
above freezing (3-4° C), germinated seeds were
observed in the stratification bags at 120 days.
Temperature significantly affected germination of
all seed lots (Figure 2). On average, germination
was increased by 9.7 percent when germination
temperature was kept at 20° C compared with a
constant 10° C. Similar to cold-stratification tests,
the difference in germination between the two
temperature regimes was most dramatic for the
fall high-elevation seed lot compared with the
other collections.
The field seeding trial resulted in extremely
low seedling establishment. No seedlings were
established following the April 1993 seeding. Seed-
lings established on only three seeded quadrats
and no unseeded quadrats following the October

control plots, but the rise was much steeper in the
treated plots (104.9 plants) than the controls (14.0
plants). The monsoon season in" 1999 was the
wettest of the 1992-2000 study period, with 37.2
cm of precipitation from June through September
(Table 2). The 1999 monsoon also comprised the
highest proportion (78%) of annual precipitation
during the study period. In 2000, a dry year, P.
clutei densities declined to an average of 30.6
plants in the trenched plots and only 1.5 plants in
the controls. No notable P. clutei increase occurred
on the disturbed trench areas outside the plots.
Community ordination indicated a minor separa-
tion between the trenched and control plots, but
with considerable overlap. Indicator species for
trenched plots are shown in Table 1.
Belowground Competition
P. clutei density in the eight trenched plots
(average 7.9 plants per plot) was higher than that
of the eight nearest control plots (3.4 plants per
plot) even prior to treatment in 1997/ but the
difference was not statistically significant (Figure
3). By 1998/ the trenched P. clutei density averaged
8 plants but the control density dropped to 2.5
plants, a significant difference. In 1999/ P. clutei
densities increased sharply in both trenched and

Figure 3. P. clutei density increased substantially in 1999-a year with excellent growing season mois-
ture-in both trenched and control plots, but t~e increase in the trenched plots was eight times greater
than in the controls. P. clutei densities declined sharply in 2000, a dry year, but trenched densities re-
mained significantly higher than controls.
Discussion
The reasons why P. clutei is sparsely
distributed in nature were not completely clarified
by this set of studies. P. clutei germinated readily
with moisture under lab conditions with little or
no innate dormancy necessary. Increasing periods
of stratification, in fact, decreased germination,
contrary to the experience of Plants of the South-
west (Santa Fe, New Mexico). These germination
characteristics are adaptive in light of the fact that
warm, moist soils are typically present during the
monsoon season (late June through September) in
the Sunset Crater area and that we have observed
most seedling regeneration to occur in the mon-
soon season, rather than the spring. However, in
contrast to the high lab germination rates, field
establishment of the species on seeded quadrats
was dismal (0.4%). The long-term demographic
data (1993-2000) from the burning and trenching
control plots also show a general decline in P.
clutei numbers over time, and no counteracting
increase in P. clutei density was obs!rved outside
the permanent plots. Variability in germination
among seed lots collected-at different dates and
elevations suggests that genetic or environmental
factors may influence germination.
Trenching was the only experimental treat-
ment that resulted in highly significant increases
in P. clutei density, but our approach had many
limitations due to the small scale of the experiment
(N = 16). The control plots started out with a lower
average density than the trenched plots and we
did not quantify differences in soil moisture,
physiological processes, plant vigor, biomass,
flowering, pollination, seed production, viability,
predation, soil seed bank, or plant herbivory.

turbance, within certain parameters.
Low-intensity surface fire alone appears un-
lik~ly to benefit P. clutei, although there are other
valuable reasons for burning in the forest environ-
ment. However, more intense prescribed fires that
kill some trees or a combination of thinning trees
and burning may be promising treatments that
could facilitate P. clutei regeneration and simulta-
neously meet other ecosystem management goals,
such as restoring historic forest structure and fire
disturbance regimes. Other methods of simply kil-
ling overs tory trees, such as snag creation through
cutting cambium or inducing insect attack, may
also benefit P. clutei regeneration.
Even severe ground disturbance may create
environments that benefit P. clutei vigor and repro-
duction. Many P. clutei plants observed on the
Transwestern pipeline and on roadcuts were
among the most vigorous in the region. However,
repeated physical impacts that destroy established
plants, such as off-road vehicle use in the Cinder
Hills, appear to reduce P. clutei populations.
The management of a rare species that is
adapted to disturbance is difficult because "protec-
tion" by excluding disturbance that might damage
the plants may contribute to the decline of the
species. The Coconino National Forest has had a
proactive management policy of encouraging
experimentation and monitoring of the species.
Further management-level experiments focusing
on restoration of historic disturbance patterns and
understanding the mechanisms of P. clutei re-
sponse would be valuable.
Therefore the mechanisms underlying the increase
remain uncertain and further research will be
useful. The trenching process itself and the plastic
liner may have affected plot hydrology apart from
simply cutting root competition, but the effect may
have been just as likely to keep water out as to
keep it in. Three preliminary conclusions were
drawn from the trenching study: (a) cutting root
competition has a significant positive effect on P.
clutei reproduction, (b) the trenching effect was
more pronounced in a year with favorable climate
(1999) but was also evident in a less-favorable year
(1998) and was sustained into a dry year (2000),
and (c) root competition appears to be much more
important for P. clutei response than light competi-
tion, consistent with the results reported by Riegel
et al. (1995). We did not manipulate the light envi-
ronment but still had a highly significant popula-
tion increase.
Although prescribed burning decreased P.
clutei density, contrary to the initial research hy-
pothesis, the historic role of fire in the ponderosa
pine ecosystem may not have been adequately
simulated in our experiment. The prescribed fires
were of low intensity and did not kill any trees,
unlike the severe wildfires that led to questions
about P. clutei fire ecology in the first place. Prior
to European settlement there is no evidence for
extensive crown fires at the scale of the Burnt and
Hochderrfer fires in southwestern ponderosa pine
forests (Swetnam and Baisan 1996). But naturally
occurring surface fires in relatively undisrupted
ponderosa and related forests do create patchy
tree mortality at scales ranging from individual
,trees to a few hectares (Fule and Covington 1997,
Fule et al., unpublished data). These patches of
fire-caused mortality and other tree deaths from
wind throw, insects, pathogens, or lightning may
have comprised important disturbance patterns
that facilitated P. clutei regeneration. Figure 4
shows vigo_~ous 
P. clutei regeneration around the
base of a recently deceased mature ponderosa pine
tree, possibly a natural analog to the trenching
experiment.

Management Recommendations
The high year-to-year variability in P. clutei
densities and the general trend in the control plots
toward declining P. clutei density are issues of
concern for sustaining this rare species. Results
from this study and others (Goodwin 1979, Phil-
lips et al. 1992, Crisp 1996) support a positive
relationship between P. clutei abundance and dis-
