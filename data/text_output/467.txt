―Each generation has its own 
rendezvous with the 
land….  By choice or by 
default, we will carve out a 
land legacy for our heirs.‖

– Historical Evidence
The X-section on the left is 
from Durango, Mexico where 
grazing was infrequent with 
no fire suppression. Naturally 
caused fires were still burning 
about every 12 years.
The X-section on the right is 
from Mt. Trumbull in the AZ 
Strip.  Prior to introduction of  
grazing in 1870’s fires could 
be expected to burn 
repeatedly every 5-8 years.

applicability for managers and 
communities as one of the most 
important qualities.

ERI facilitated collaborative, science-

management actions on a landscape 
scale that more closely matched the 
largest disturbance in the Southwest 
so far—the Rodeo Chediski fire.
Products (maps & reports) have been 
used in national forest planning and in 
the creation of a Community Wildfire 
Protection Plan (see next slide for

The AZ Gov’s Forest Health Advisory Council has 
developed a framework for planning and 
implementing forest ecosystem restoration and 
community protection projects statewide.
Arizona is the first state to have developed such a 
framework.  ERI co- chairs both the advisory and 
oversight councils.

The Western Governor’s 
Association, in 
recognition of the 
uniquely unbiased 
technical support the ERI 
has provided for 
developing restoration 
policy, has been a strong 
supporter of the 
establishment and 
funding for SWERI.

ERI has provided funding and 
student interns for the 
establishment of the City of 
Flagstaff Fuels Management 
Program.  Although fuels 
reduction is not restoration, it 
does raise community awareness 
of the unhealthy forest 
conditions, and is a positive step 
toward a healthy relationship 
between the forest ecosystems 
and the human community.
The following slide is an example 
of the work they do.

National conferences conducted by the 
ERI, Steps Toward Stewardship (2000) 
and Putting the Pieces Together (2003), 
brought together large groups of 
researchers and practitioners to acquire 
new knowledge and discuss restoration.  
The conferences provided a focal point

Conclusion
We know what happens when today’s 
forests burn:
And they leave behind an ugly, degraded 
resource for our children.
They put many 
people and 
resources at risk,

Southwest Ecological Restoration Institutes 
(SWERI)
•
Conclusion
We all know what to do:
Because we’ve seen that restoration 
treatments work, even with 
catastrophic wildfire!
No treatment, killed by fire.
Tree thinning and prescribed burning,
survived fire.

•
Conclusion
Time has run out for ideological hand-wringing, we 
must act now!
•We are at a fork in the trail.  
•One path leads to 
depauperate, degraded land, 
burned over by unnaturally 
severe fires—a liability to future 
generations.
•Down the other path lies 
diverse, sustaining land, where 
fire plays a rejuvenating role—
an asset for generations to use, 
enjoy and care for.

Conclusion
Treat the earth well.
We do not inherit the Earth from our ancestors,
we borrow it from our children.
