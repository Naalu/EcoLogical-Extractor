Abstract.
It has been suggested that large, high-severity fires historically structured warm–dry mixed conifer forests in
the American South-west. To test this, we reconstructed fire regime characteristics of an 1135-ha (11.3 km2) mixed conifer
landscape in northern Arizona using complementary approaches. We analysed composite fire intervals, point fire
intervals, natural fire rotation, landscape characteristics and forest age structure. Composite analysis of cross-dated fire
scars from 133 trees indicated a mean fire interval (MFI) of 2.0–8.5 years between 1670 and 1879. Frequent fires halted
abruptly after 1879. Mean point fire interval (MPFI) was 11.8 years and ranged 2–61 years. Mean fire rotation was
14.4 years. Density of most occurring tree species increased dramatically after fire regime disruption, with south-western
white pine (Pinus strobiformis) and white fir (Abies concolor) showing large numerical gains. Tree establishment patterns
compared with widespread fire dates did not suggest historical high-severity fires at the site level. Although strong
evidence of high-severity fire at finer scales was lacking, spatial locations of ‘young’ plots suggested the possibility of
historical high-severity disturbances #25 ha in size. The historical fire regime on this landscape was one of high-
frequency, low-severity fires. Current conditions call for restoration of forest structure and function.

Introduction
Mixed conifer forests cover ,1.7 million ha in the American
South-west (Dieterich 1983; Korb et al. 2013). These ecosys-
tems occupy the life zone between lower, drier ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa Lawson and C. Lawson) forests and the
colder, more mesic spruce-fir (Picea sp.–Abies sp.) type at
higher elevations. Reflecting a range of environmental condi-
tions within the life zone, mixed conifer forests vary in species
composition, stand structure and natural disturbance processes.
For simplicity, the type has been classified into ‘warm–dry’ and
‘cool–moist’ mixed conifer subtypes, but it is recognised that
these are respective ends of a continuum of biotic and abiotic
conditions (Romme et al. 2009; Korb et al. 2013). Forest
overstorey of the warm–dry subtype is characteristically dom-
inated by ponderosa pine, but may also include species such as
Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt.) Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga
menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), south-western white pine (Pinus
strobiformis Engelm.), white fir (Abies concolor (Gord. and
Glend.) Lindl. ex Hildebr.) and quaking aspen (Populus tre-
muloides Michx.) (Brown 1994; Romme et al. 2009). However,
due to selective timber harvesting and historical disruption of
natural fire regimes by intensive livestock grazing and fire
suppression, forest composition and structure have been altered
on many warm–dry mixed conifer sites (Heinlein et al. 2005;
Fule´ et al. 2009; Korb et al. 2012). As site conditions become
cooler and moister with increasing elevation or changes in
aspect, relative abundance of shade-tolerant and fire-intolerant
species, such as fir (Abies sp.), and cold site species, such as
spruce (Picea sp.), increases.
In general, it is thought that low-severity surface fires
characterised natural fire regimes of south-western warm–dry
mixed conifer, whereas infrequent, stand-replacing crown fires
typify natural fire regimes of the cool–moist subtype (Fule´ et al.
2009; Romme et al. 2009; Margolis et al. 2011). Composite
mean fire intervals (MFIs) reported for warm–dry mixed conifer
forests range from 4 to 30 years, and weak positive relationships
between elevation and MFI have been described to account for
this variability (Swetnam and Baisan 1996; Brown et al. 2001;
Grissino-Mayer et al. 2004; Heinlein et al. 2005). However,
using various lines of evidence including fire scars, changes in
tree ring growth patterns and tree establishment dates, Margolis
and Balmat (2009) reconstructed a mid-1800s fire of mixed

severity, comprised of both surface fire and high-severity
patches, in the lower mixed conifer zone of a site in northern
New Mexico. Similarly, Fule´ et al. (2003) documented histori-
cal mixed-severity fires at a complex mixed conifer site in Grand
Canyon National Park in northern Arizona. Recently, Williams
and Baker (2012) used historical survey data to reconstruct
forest structural characteristics on 260-ha land units and con-
cluded that higher severity fire regimes were common on dry
forest landscapes in the western United States, including sub-
stantial extents of the Mogollon Plateau in Arizona.
In this study, we investigated historical fire regime charac-
teristics at a warm–dry mixed conifer site in northern Arizona.
Our research questions were (1) what was the historical fre-
quency of surface fire at the site before Euro–American settle-
ment? (2) Was there evidence of modern changes in fire regime?
(3) Was there evidence of high-severity or mixed-severity fire?
To reconstruct the historical fire regime, we used complemen-
tary approaches of composite fire scar analysis, point fire
interval analysis, natural fire rotation and landscape analysis,
and compared the results to develop a robust interpretation. To
assess evidence for high-severity fire, we compared tree estab-
lishment dates with dates of widespread fires at the site level,
and evaluated fine-scale patterns of tree ages and stump densi-
ties relative to locations of fire-scarred trees.
Methods
Study area
Our study area was an 1135-ha warm–dry mixed conifer forest
landscape on the Black Mesa Ranger District of the Apache–
Sitgreaves National Forest in northern Arizona. The site is
located at 2313–2405 m in elevation and ,300–900 m north of
the Mogollon Rim escarpment and the southern edge of the
Colorado Plateau (3482204000N, 11180001100W). Annual precip-
itation averages 695 mm at the site, and temperature averages
5.58C (Laing et al. 1987). Soils at the site are generally skeletal
Alfisols and Inceptisols derived from sedimentary parent
material, primarily limestone, chert and sandstone. Topography
at the site is typical of the Mogollon Rim, with gently sloping
terrain bisected by small, steep drainages. Rock outcroppings
are infrequent, although moist conditions in drainages may serve
as barriers to fire spread. Tree species occurring on the site
include ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, south-western white pine,
white fir, quaking aspen and Gambel oak. Bigtooth maple (Acer
grandidentatum Nutt.) also occurs on scattered, moister
microsites, primarily in drainages. Understorey vegetation
includes Symphoricarpos oreophilus A. Gray; Mahonia repens
(Lindl.) G.Don; Pachystima myrsinites (Pursh) Raf; Fragaria
sp., Festuca arizonica Vasey; Poa fendleriana (Steud.) Vasy
and Bromus ciliates L. Elevation, soils, topography and species
composition at the site were consistent with those of an exten-
sive community classified as Petran Montane Conifer Forest
that occurs along the Mogollon Rim in northern Arizona (Brown
1994).
Fire scar sampling
Fire scars from across the study site were collected following a
targeted sampling approach (Swetnam and Baisan 1996; Van
Horne and Fule´ 2006). The site was systematically searched for
trees showing multiple fire scars and sound wood. This method
(targeted sampling) has been shown to yield an unbiased esti-
mate of fire frequency similar in accuracy to census and random
sampling (Van Horne and Fule´ 2006; Farris et al. 2013). Spatial
coordinates were recorded for these trees and fire scar samples
were collected using chainsaws. For each sample collected,
notes were made concerning tree species, condition (i.e. live
tree, snag, down log, or cut stump), orientation of scars, and
height of sample, microsite aspect and slope. Digital images of
the cut sample were taken.
Overstorey sampling
Overstorey structure was sampled on 0.04-ha plots arrayed on a
250-m systematic grid. Grid point locations were generated
using a geographic information system (ArcGIS 9.3) and over-
laid on a site map. Global positioning system units were used to
navigate to sample point locations in the field and those that
coincided with roads were rejected from the sample grid. In
total, 149 points were established. Points were used as centres of
circular (11.28-m radius) sample plots on which we recorded
species and condition for all trees present, both living and dead.
Diameter at breast height (DBH; measured at 1.37-m height on
stem) was recorded for live trees, and diameter at stump height
(DSH; measured at 40 cm above root collar) was recorded for
dead trees. In addition, we sampled age of live trees by col-
lecting increment cores for all trees with diameters greater than a
predetermined value (Fule´ et al. 2009), and for a random 20%
sample of trees with smaller diameters. Predetermined sizes by
species were as following: (1) $37.5 cm; ponderosa pine,
Douglas-fir, south-western white pine, white fir; (2) $20 cm;
quaking aspen; and (3) $17 cm; Gambel oak. The purpose of
this scheme was to obtain a comprehensive age sample for trees
that were big enough to conceivably predate Euro–American
settlement (,130-years old). Increment cores were stored in
labelled straws and transported to the laboratory for processing.
Analysis
Tree rings of fire-scarred partial cross-sections and increment
cores were cross-dated. Local master chronologies (http://
www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/treering.html; Graybill – AZ523 and
Graybill – AZ527) were used to guide cross-dating. In addition,
ring widths of fire-scarred samples were measured and cross-
dating was verified using COFECHA software (Grissino-Mayer
2001). For all analyses, we used one partial cross-section sample
per fire-scarred tree, including only those samples showing two
or more fire scars and excluding samples with a single scar. This
approach was taken in order to arrive at a conservative estimate
of surface fire frequency and limit fire dates that may have
resulted from small fires. Additionally, we excluded fires
occurring earlier than 1670 due to inadequate record and sample
depth. Our interest was in characterising the several centuries of
fire regime that prevailed before the era of Euro–American
settlement of the South-west. Numerous other studies have
indicated fire regime interruption occurring in the mid- to late
1800s (Swetnam and Baisan 1996; Fule´ et al. 2003; Van Horne
and Fule´ 2006). Indeed, we found only one scar in our dataset
later than 1879. Thus, we restricted our composite analysis to
the period between 1670 and 1879. Composite MFIs were

determined for all fires as well as only those occurring on 10%
and 25% of the recorder trees. For this analysis, we used cross-
dated fire dates from both recording and non-recording seg-
ments on samples (Aldrich et al. 2014). Recording years began
with earliest fire date identified on a sample and continued
through subsequent years presumed to be susceptible to further
fire scarring. Non-recording segments were those periods when
the tree was less susceptible to scarring (i.e. before the first
injury) and periods when identification of fire scars was hin-
dered by decay or charring. Filtering the dataset to fire dates on
10 and 25% of recorder trees provides more conservative esti-
mates of MFI than calculation based on all fires. Fire dates
identified using the 25% filter were assumed to represent the
‘major’ fires at the site (Swetnam and Baisan 1996).
We also analysed MFIs for scars on individual trees (hereaf-
ter ‘point’ intervals). This approach provides an indication of
fire frequency at a single location on the landscape rather than
compositing all fire dates at the site. Point intervals were
calculated for individual tree samples that showed two or more
fire scars between 1650 and 1879. Mean point fire interval
(MPFI) for all sampled trees was calculated following methods
suggested by Baker and Ehle (2001). Each interval between
recorded fire dates was treated as an independent value. The sum
of the interval values was divided by the total number of
intervals observed across all partial cross-sections; thus, the
overall mean was weighted by the number of intervals observed
on each tree. Point interval analysis is likely to yield a longer
MFI than composite interval analysis as a result of fires that did
not burn the entire study area or may not be recorded on an
individual tree even if a fire did burn around it (Van Horne and
Fule´ 2006).
In addition to describing fire frequency, we also were
interested in understanding spatial patterns of historical fires.
We investigated fire patterns in the following two ways: (1) we
mapped mean point intervals for individual trees across the
landscape; and (2) we estimated fire sizes and quantified fire
size distribution. For landscape analysis of point intervals, we
used the spatial analyst feature in ArcGIS (www.esri.com)
to plot point interval values and generate a map of continuous
point interval values using inverse distance-weighted interpola-
tion. After interpolating point intervals to generate a map of
90  90-m resolution, we reclassified it into 5-year point fire
interval classes, and then used the FRAGSTATS software
application (McGarigal et al. 2012) to calculate total area,
landscape percentage and area-weighted mean patch size for
each interval class. We also calculated an index of connectivity
for each class as described by Turner et al. (2001). The
connectivity metric provides an estimate of relative size of the
largest patch within a class, and is calculated as Ci ¼ LCi/
(pi  E), where Ci is connectivity index for patch type i; LCi
is the size of the largest patch of type i; pi is the proportion of the
landscape in patch type i and E is the area of the analysed
landscape. Thus, for any patch type, greater connectivity is
indicated as Ci approaches 1.0 (relative size of largest patch
increases). Conversely, low connectivity is indicated by values
of Ci close to 0 (dispersed smaller patches).
Fire sizes were estimated by plotting fire dates in ArcGIS
and using a convex hull algorithm to construct fire polygons.
Fire sizes were estimated for fire dates occurring on three or
more tree samples (North et al. 2005). Although Farris et al.
(2010)
found

correspondence
between

reconstructed perimeters and mapped perimeters in an Arizona
forest, we recognised that this approach may be imprecise as it
assumes both that (1) a given fire completely burned the area
within the polygon; and (2) fire perimeters are evidenced by
scarred trees. In our study, estimating fire size provided the
opportunity to investigate historical fire frequency in terms
of NFR.
We used estimates of historical fire sizes to calculate NFR
for five periods: 1670–99; 1700–49; 1750–99; 1800–49; and
1850–79. NFR was calculated as NFR ¼ total site area (ha)/(sum
of the area burned within given period (ha)/number of years in
period). This yielded the number of years required for the entire
site area to burn within the given time periods. From these values
we calculated a mean NFR for the fire scar record depth and a
standard deviation. ‘Widespread’ fires were defined as those
with dates found both in the upper quintile of proportion of
scarred tree samples and in the upper quintile of estimated
fire size.
Overstorey tree data were summarised at the site level by
species, condition, size and age. Means and standard deviations
of density (trees per hectare, TPH) were calculated for these
strata. Total age of individual trees was determined by cross-
dating increment cores in the laboratory (Stokes and Smiley
1996). Transparent ‘pith locators’ were used to estimate number
of additional rings to pith for off-centre cores. Tree age was not
adjusted for number of years to grow to 40 cm in height.
To investigate evidence of historical high-severity distur-
bance at the site level, we compared establishment dates of live
trees with widespread fire dates (see above). We expected high-
severity fire to be evidenced by: (1) a lack of live trees preceding
the fire date (i.e. substantial mortality of earlier cohorts); and
(2) abrupt increases in establishment following the fire date
(i.e. regeneration response). We also investigated evidence of
high-severity disturbance at the plot level. We assumed that
these disturbances at would be indicated by (1) an abundance of
dead, charred tree structures on plots; (2) plots with a lack of
‘older’ trees (.150 years); (3) plots with a lack of large stumps
(.40 cm DSH); and (4) plots with a lack of nearby fire scars.
We defined plots meeting assumptions (2) and (3) as ‘young’
plots. Fine-scale (i.e. plot-level) evidence of high-severity
disturbance was evaluated by comparing locations of young
plots and fire scars in ArcGIS.
Results
Composite fire interval
Evidence of low-severity surface fire was abundant across the
study site. Partial cross-sections from a total of 133 tree samples
and 1023 individual fire scars were cross-dated, yielding 104
unique fire dates between 1670 and 1879. Ninety-five % of all
samples were collected from ponderosa pine and 79% of these
were taken from cut stumps. The remainder of the samples was
primarily from living and standing dead south-western white
pine; one sample was collected from a Douglas-fir stump.
Results of the composite analysis indicated that MFI for all fires
with occurrence dates between 1670 and 1879 was 2.0 years
(1.29 s.d.) (Fig. 1). Weibull median probability interval

(WMPI) was 1.9 years and ranged from 1 to 7 years (Fig. 1). For
progressively more widespread fires recorded on $10% and
$25% of the samples, MFI respectively was 3.0 (1.7 s.d.)
(WMPI ¼ 2.9 years; range 1–7 years) and 8.5 years (5.37 s.d.)
(WMPI ¼ 8.0 years; range 2–23 years). Frequent fires halted
abruptly in 1879 and we found only one scar representing a fire
(1960) that occurred after this time (Fig. 1).
Point intervals
MPFI was 11.8 years (8.1 s.d.; 0.57 95% CI) and ranged
from 2 to 61 years. Individual tree samples showed an average of
7.8 recorded fires and ranged up to 19 recorded fires per sample.
Thirty-nine of the 133 samples (29%) showed $10 fire scars.
The number of recording years on each sample averaged 85.5
years and ranged up to 278 years. Landscape analysis of inter-
polated point intervals indicated that prior to 1879, fires burned
at intervals of #15 yrs across 86% of the landscape (Fig. 2;
Table 1). In contrast, only ,1.2% of the landscape burned at
intervals of $25 yrs. Area-weighted mean patch size was
greatest for the 11–15-years interval class (652.3 ha), which also
showed a relatively high connectivity index value (0.98)
(Table 1). The 6–10-years interval class also showed a high
mean patch size (78.0 ha) compared with other classes, but
showed relatively low connectivity. All other classes had low
mean patch sizes (,13 ha) and most showed connectivity index
values below 0.5.
Fire size and natural fire rotation
We identified 88 fire dates between 1670 and 1879 that were
recorded on three or more fire-scarred trees. Convex hull
estimates of fire size based on the location of these samples
ranged from 0.06 to 673 ha. Mean size for the 88 fires was
280.9 ha (195.3 s.d.; 40.8 95% CI). Mean fire rotation for the
period 1670–1879 was 14.4 years (11.0 s.d.; 10.8 95% CI),
with range 6.3–32.7 years (Table 2).
Stand structure
Live tree density averaged 943.8 (TPH) at the study site
(561.8 s.d.). Mean densities of ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir,
Gambel oak, south-western white pine and white fir were 171.5
(s.d. ¼ 487.5), 185.7 (198.5 s.d.), 52.7 (63.7 s.d.), 141.7
(175.5 s.d.) and 260.7 (235.5 s.d.). Other species present in
lower densities included quaking aspen, corkbark fir (Abies
lasiopcarpa (Hook.) Nutt. var. arizonica (Merriam) Lemmon),
and bigtooth maple (Acer grandidentatum Nutt.). Live tree
density was composed mainly (92%) of trees ,40-cm DBH
(Fig. 3). For trees $40-cm DBH, mean densities were 22.0
(32.7 s.d.), 15.0 (19.2 s.d.), 3.7 (13.7 s.d.), 8.7 (20.2 s.d.)
and 13.2 (23.0 s.d.) TPH for ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir,
Gambel oak, south-western white pine and white fir. Standing
dead snags and dead and down logs at the site were of smaller
size classes and represented all major species in the live over-
storey (Fig. 3). Mean total density of white fir snags (75.7 ha1)
was greater than that of total ponderosa pine snags (10.0 ha1)
by a factor of more than seven and nearly twice that of Douglas-
fir snags (42.7 ha1). Similarly, logs of white fir were about
twice as abundant as ponderosa pine logs and 1.6 times more
abundant than Douglas-fir. Cut stumps of all major species were
observed and stumps $40-cm DSH comprised ,40% of the
total density (Fig. 3).

Based on analysis of increment core samples, 95% of the live
trees at the site established after 1880 (Fig. 4). White fir
established after 1880 comprised ,29% of the live trees at the
site, whereas younger cohorts of Douglas-fir, south-western
white pine and ponderosa pine made up 25, 19 and 18% of the
live trees at the site. We found lesser amounts of aspen and
Gambel oak (Fig. 4). In contrast, live trees that had established
before 1880 were primarily Gambel oak (2.1%) and ponderosa
pine (1.4%) with only ,0.5% each of Douglas-fir and south-
western white pine, and 0.15% white fir. We found very few
(,0.1%) live aspen that had established before 1880.
Evidence of high-severity disturbance
Ten fire dates met the criteria of being both in the upper quintile
of proportion of samples scarred ($30%) and in the upper
quintile of estimated fire sizes ($469 ha), and thus were con-
sidered widespread fires. Analysis of tree establishment dates at
the site level showed no missing age cohorts apparent preceding
the 10 fires identified (Fig. 5). Further, clear regeneration
responses were not apparent, although there were slight
increases in tree establishment densities across the site follow-
ing fires in 1782 and 1785 as well as following fires in 1851and
1879. At finer scales, 19 of 149 (13%) plots were considered
‘young’ with maximum tree age ,150 years and a lack of large

(.40-cm DSH) stumps (Fig. 2). Although dead tree structures
can be identified for several decades in these forests without fire
(Moore et al. 2004), we did not observe plots with an abundance
of dead, charred tree structures that would suggest areas of
historical stand-replacing fire. Of the plots considered young,
eight showed locations $250 m distant from fire-scarred trees
(samples used in fire scar analysis) or older plots. We identified
two areas of the site where two and four young plots, respec-
tively, were adjacent to one another (Fig. 2). Assuming each plot
represented an area of 6.2 ha (250  250 m), the largest area of
young forest lacking fire scars was 25 ha.
Discussion
Historical frequent, low-severity fire regime
Composite fire scar analysis indicated that fires scarring at least
two trees occurred at our site at mean intervals of 2–8 years.
These results were similar to those reported in other studies. For
example, Swetnam and Baisan (1996) provided a summary of
tree ring-based studies conducted at 24 mixed conifer sites in
Arizona and New Mexico and reported historical MFIs of 2.9–
12.3 years for all fires in forests classified as ponderosa pine–
mixed conifer and 2.9–25.2 years for those considered simply
mixed conifer. For widespread fire recorded on $25% of the
trees sampled, Swetnam and Baisan (1996) reported MFI values
of 7.3–27.4 years for ponderosa pine–mixed conifer and 7.8–
26.1 years for mixed conifer. Similarly Brown et al. (2001), Fule´
et al. (2003), Heinlein et al. (2005), Margolis and Balmat (2009)
and Bigio and Swetnam (2010) found historical mean fire return
intervals at sites in New Mexico, northern Arizona and southern
Colorado within the ranges reported by Swetnam and Baisan
(1996). Longer mean fire return intervals (22–38 years; $25%
of recording samples) were reported by Grissino-Mayer et al.
(2004) for three mixed conifer sites in southern Colorado.
Similarly, Fule´ et al. (2009) and Korb et al. (2013) reported MFI
($25% of recording samples) ranges of 10.0–32.3 years for
three southern Colorado sites. Our study showed that although
physical site conditions were conducive to mixed conifer forest
composition represented by historical co-dominance of pon-
derosa pine, Douglas-fir and white fir, composite fire interval
seemed relatively low compared with other studies of warm–dry
mixed conifer, including sites characterised as being dominated
by ponderosa pine (e.g. Swetnam and Baisan 1996). Fire regime
properties, however, are spatially variable and interval estimates
have been shown to be scale dependent (Falk et al. 2007). Thus,
it is important to note that direct comparison of MFI across

Mixed conifer fire history

studies is problematic, particularly without additional infor-
mation concerning scale of observation. Further insights
regarding historical fire regimes in warm–dry mixed conifer
ecosystems could be gained from analysis of factors affecting
variability in scaling functions.
Baker and Ehle (2001) suggested that MPFI could be used in
addition to composite scar analysis (i.e. MFI) to reduce uncer-
tainties in interpretation of historical surface fire regimes. Taken
together, MFI and MPFI results from our study indicated that
fires were frequent both at the scale of the site as well as at
individual locations. However, MPFI (11.8 years) was 39%
greater than the composite MFI for a $25%-scarred filter (8.5
years). In contrast, Fule´ et al. (2003) reported MPFI of 31.9
years, which, although longer than ours by a factor of nearly
three, was only ,3% greater than MFI (31 years; 25%-scarred
filter). Greater discrepancy between MPFI and MFI in our study
likely reflects a substantial number of smaller fires. Few other
fire history studies in south-western mixed conifer forests have
quantified point intervals. We concur with Baker and Ehle
(2001) that use of complementary approaches such as MPFI
and MFI could provide deeper insight into historical fire regimes
of western dry forest types. Further, we suggest that reporting
additional measures and statistics such as point interval sample
distribution and variance would improve interpretation of MPFI.
In our study, large sample size (n ¼ 133) and relatively low
variation among sample intervals (95% CI  0.57 years) con-
tributed to a robust estimate of MPFI. In addition, broad spatial
distribution of fire scar samples allowed us to construct a map of
point fire intervals and analyse landscape patterns of historical
fire frequency. Similar methods have been used to examine
stand ages and changes in forest structure and potential fire
behaviour on other south-western forest landscapes (e.g. Huff-
man et al. 2008; Roccaforte et al. 2008; Fule´ et al. 2004).
Landscape analysis suggested that a large proportion of the
study site (.98%) burned at frequencies of ,25 years and
patches of up to 650 ha (57% of landscape extent) burned at
frequencies of ,15 years. These findings corresponded well
with our analysis of fire sizes, which indicated that mean fire
size for individual fires that scarred at least three trees was
281 ha, or 25% of the landscape extent, and NFR averaged just
over 14 years between 1670 and 1879. Although we acknowl-
edge potential errors in fire size estimates (e.g. some fires may
have extended outside our study area boundaries; see also
Methods), our findings suggested that historical fires were both
frequent and many were large relative to the site area. The
abundance of historical fires at our site suggests that occurrence
was driven by both regional climate, and local factors such as
fuels and ignitions. Lightning occurrences with summer mon-
soon storms are frequent along the Mogollon Rim in Arizona
(Lo´pez et al. 1997). The importance of Native Americans in
igniting fires at our site is unclear, although aboriginal burning
of lands for various purposes was common in the South-west
before Euro–American settlement (Allen 2002).
Effects of fire regime disruption on stand structure
and species composition
We would expect extensive, frequent fires to maintain
open structural conditions and encourage fire-tolerant plant
communities across the study site. Previous studies of other
frequent-fire mixed conifer systems in the South-west have
indicated pre-fire disruption mean tree densities and basal area
to range ,52–244 TPH and 8–28 m2 ha1 (see Stoddard 2011).
Reconstruction of stand structure at our site using dendrochro-
nology and decomposition modelling, such as described by
Bakker et al. (2008), would provide insight concerning links
between the historical fire regime and overstorey conditions.
These investigations may be further informed using simulation
modelling of landscape dynamics. Recently, Williams and
Baker (2012) reconstructed landscape conditions from land
survey records and concluded from historical tree density and
diameter distribution that the historical fire regime must have
included substantial extents of higher severity fires on portions
of the Mogollon Plateau near our study site. In our study,
however, tree establishment patterns compared with widespread
fire dates suggested a lack of historical high-severity fires at the
site level. Subtle increases in tree establishment, however, were
apparent following widespread fires occurring in 1782, 1785,
1851 and 1879. Similarly at finer scales, we did not find strong
evidence of high-severity fire. Although charred tree structures
were not apparent, spatial patterns of old trees (.150 years) and
large stumps (.40-cm diameter) suggested young areas up to
25 ha in size. These results taken together with fire scar analysis
strongly indicate that the historical fire regime comprised high-
frequency, low-severity fires. Although the landscape described
by Williams and Baker (2012) is ,8 km north of our study, it is
difficult to compare findings. However, we suggest that rela-
tionships between forest structure and fire regime characteristics
are complex, and inferring one from the other should be verified
using multiple lines of evidence (Fule´ et al. 2014). Future work
to expand understanding of natural ranges of variability in dry
mixed conifer forests should employ direct evidence and com-
plementary reconstruction of both stand structure and fire
regime parameters (e.g. Heinlein et al. 2005; Fule´ et al. 2009).
Species composition and structural characteristics at the
Black Mesa study site fit descriptions of the warm–dry mixed
conifer classification (Romme et al. 2009). Ponderosa pine was
a dominant species in terms of density; however, Douglas-fir,
Gambel oak, south-western white pine and white fir also were
well represented at the site. Age data showed that the Gambel
oak, ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir trees were the oldest at the
site. Although occurring in relatively low numbers, live south-
western white pine cohorts dating to 1770 were observed
(Fig. 5). White fir trees were relatively young and living cohorts
established before 1820 were not observed. Although we did not
conduct an in-depth reconstruction as part of the present study,
numbers of snags, logs and cut stumps $40 cm in diameter were
similar among ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir and white fir,
suggesting that these species were co-dominant at the site during
the 19th century and possibly earlier. Many of these stumps
remain from selective logging in the mid-20th century. White
fir is considered to be less fire tolerant and found under more
mesic conditions than ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir (Minore
1979). We hypothesise that white fir, and probably south-
western white pine, were able to maintain populations by
successfully regenerating during short fire-free periods and on
protected microsites.
Other studies have shown large 20th century increases
in overall tree density, as well as increases in densities of

shade-tolerant and fire-intolerant species in warm–dry mixed
conifer forests of the South-west (Cocke et al. 2005; Heinlein
et al. 2005; Fule´ et al. 2009). Moore et al. (2004) reported that
Douglas-fir, south-western white pine and white fir increased on
sites that were historically considered within the ponderosa pine
type. In our study, tree age data indicated dramatic increases in
overall tree density after 1880 (fire regime interruption in 1879),
with south-western white pine and white fir showing relatively
greater numerical gains than other species (Fig. 2). Large 20th
century increases in overall tree density and increases in fire-
intolerant species have been interpreted as responses to fire
exclusion and interruption of historical fire regimes (Moore
et al. 2004; Heinlein et al. 2005; Fule´ et al. 2009). Fire regime
disruption has been attributed to intensive livestock grazing in
the late 1800s and early 1900s (and its effects on fine fuel
continuity and understorey competition), followed later by land
management policies that emphasised active fire suppression
(Covington et al. 1994). Although our data suggested historical
co-dominance of ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir and white fir at the
site, live age class distributions suggested large increases in
overall density and in abundance of south-western white pine
and white fir, corresponding to the abrupt cessation of frequent
fires in 1879 as indicated by fire scar records.
Implications for management
In our study, results of complementary analytical approaches
converged to indicate that widespread, frequent, low-severity
fires characterised the historical disturbance regime of this
mixed conifer forest for at least 200 years just before the period
of western expansion of Anglo–American human settlement.
Fire regime disruption beginning in 1879 corresponded to
substantial increases in tree density, particularly white fir and
south-western white pine. Large increases in density of smaller,
shade-tolerant trees have likely resulted in a landscape-scale shift
from low-severity surface fire to a greater potential for high-
severity crown fire. Warm–dry mixed conifer forests may be
among the most altered ecosystems in North America as a result
of modern land uses such as intensive livestock grazing and
commercial timber harvesting. The proliferation of fire-intoler-
ant, mesic tree species and increased fuel loading, primarily due
to fire exclusion butalso asa result ofselective timber harvesting,
have produced a decline in ecosystem health and an increased
vulnerability to severe insect outbreaks and destructive, high-
severity crown fire.
Current conditions in these forests call for management
approaches aimed at ecological restoration in order to increase
resilience to forecasted climate change, and conserve ecological
and social values (Reynolds et al. 2013). In order to implement
such approaches, a solid foundation of science-based information
is needed. In particular, information concerning historical refer-
enceconditions and ecologicalresponses tooperational treatment
prescriptions plays a central role in the development of sound
restoration strategies. Key reference information for these forests
includes pre-settlement fire frequency, severity and spatial pat-
terns as well as historical tree density, species composition and
size distribution. This information can be generated through
dendrochronology and systematic analysis of biological field
data, augmented by examination of cultural evidence such as
historical reports, photographs, oral histories and other records.
