Abstract: This study assessed the effects of restoration treatments on growth, leaf physiology, and insect resistance
characteristics of presettlement-age ponderosa pines (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) at the Gus Pearson Natural
Area in northern Arizona. Treatments (C, control; T, thinned from below; TB, thinned and prescribed burned) were
designed to restore stand structure and disturbance regime to a pre-Euro-American settlement reference condition. Tree
growth and some physiological characteristics differed between wet (1995) and dry (1996) years. Soil water content
was greater in both thinned treatments than in the control. Compared with the control, trees in both thinned treatments
had greater leaf nitrogen content (C = 1.44, T = 1.57, TB = 1.59 g·m–2), leaf toughness (C = 65.1, T = 71.3, TB =
69.3 g), and basal area increment (C = 14.3, T = 19.9, TB = 20.7 cm2). Resin flow was greater in the thinned and
burned treatment (12.2 mL·day–1) than in the thinned treatment (4.3 mL·day–1) and control (3.6 mL·day–1). Treatment
differences in predawn water potential and net photosynthetic rate varied among sample dates, with the largest
differences during a period of drought (C < T and TB). Our results suggest that restoration treatments improved
resource uptake, growth, and insect resistance capabilities of presettlement ponderosa pines.
Résumé : Cette étude a évalué les effets des traitements de restauration sur la croissance, la physiologie foliaire et la
résistance aux insectes des pins ponderosa (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) précoloniaux dans l’aire naturelle Gus
Pearson de l’Arizona du Nord. Les traitements (C, témoin; T, éclaircie par le bas; TB, éclaircie et brûlage contrôlé) ont
été conçus pour permettre la restauration de la structure du peuplement et du régime des perturbations telles qu’ils
existaient avant la colonisation euro-américaine. La croissance des arbres et quelques caractéristiques physiologiques
étaient différentes entre les années humides (1995) et sèches (1996). La teneur en eau du sol étaient plus élevée dans
le cas des deux traitements d’éclaircie que chez le témoin. Comparés avec le témoin, les arbres ayant subi les deux
traitements d’éclaircie avaient un contenu en azote foliaire plus élevé (C = 1,44; T = 1,57; TB = 1,59 g·m–2), une plus
grande coriacité des aiguilles (C = 65,1; T = 71,3; TB = 69,3 g) et une surface terrière plus forte (C = 14,3; T = 19,9;
TB = 20,7 cm2). Le flux de résine était plus élevé dans le traitement d’éclaircie et de brûlage (12,2 mL/jour) que dans
le traitement d’éclaircie par le bas (4,3 mL/jour) et le témoin (3,6 mL/jour). Les différences entre les traitements par
rapport au potentiel hydrique mesuré avant l’aube et le taux net de photosynthèse variaient selon la date
d’échantillonnage, avec les plus grandes différences durant la période de sécheresse (C < T et TB). Les résultats
suggèrent que les traitements de restauration ont amélioré le prélèvement la croissance et la capacité de résister aux
insectes des pins ponderosa précoloniaux.

Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) for-
ests in northern Arizona have experienced dramatic changes
in stand structure over the past century resulting from hu-
man alteration of the natural fire regime, overgrazing, and
logging (Arnold 1950; Cooper 1960; White 1985; Covington
and Moore 1994; Fulé et al. 1997). In most areas of northern
Arizona, fires have been suppressed for at least 87 years
(Madany and West 1983; Savage and Swetnam 1990). Pre-
Euro-American settlement forests were characteristically open,
with clusters of old pines separated by lush grassy areas.
These open canopy conditions were maintained by low-
intensity surface fires that occurred every 2–12 years
(Weaver 1951; Cooper 1960; Dieterich 198; Dieterich and
Swetnam 1984; Covington and Moore 1994; Swetnam and
Baisan 1996). The present forests are dense, consisting of
thickets of sapling- and pole-sized trees. They have heavy
accumulations of litter and woody fuels and poor understory
grass, forb, and shrub growth (Cooper 1960; Harrington and
Sackett 1992; Covington and Moore 1994; Dahms and Geils
1997). These conditions have increased the risk of stand-
replacing wildfires and insect outbreaks (Sartwell and

Stevens 1975; Wilson and Tkacz 1994). Consequently, we
consider the present forest conditions to be unhealthy (Kolb
et al. 1994; Covington et al. 1997; Dahms and Geils 1997).
There is currently much interest in improving the condi-
tion of southwestern ponderosa pine forests by thinning to
reduce competition among trees and by prescribed burning
to reduce fuel loads. While there is some information on the
effects of these treatments on postsettlement trees in the
Southwest (e.g., Schubert 1974; Wyant et al. 1983, 1986;
Ronco et al. 1985; Sutherland et al. 1991; Peterson et al.
1994; Kolb et al. 1998), little information is available for
presettlement trees. Consistent with general usage, we use
the term “postsettlement” to refer to ponderosa pines that
became established in northern Arizona after 1876 (the ap-
proximate year of settlement by Euro-American people), and
“presettlement” to refer to the old-growth ponderosa pines
that established before 1876.
Presettlement ponderosa pines are currently scarce in the
Southwest because of harvesting (Dahm and Geils 1997).
Studies of historical tree growth rates have suggested that
the remaining presettlement trees are declining because of
competition from postsettlement trees (Sutherland 1983,
Biondi 1996). While postsettlement ponderosa pines often
respond to stand thinning by increased growth (Barrett and
Youngberg 1965; Wollum and Schubert 1975; Ronco et al.
1985; Cochran and Barrett 1993) and greater uptake of water
and carbon (Kolb et al. 1998), it is unknown whether thin-
ning treatments can be used to improve the growth and
physiological condition of presettlement trees.
The effects of prescribed burning on presettlement trees
are also poorly understood. Two studies have reported nega-
tive effects of prescribed burning on the growth, water rela-
tions, and survival of presettlement trees (Sutherland et al.
1991; Swezy and Agee 1991). In both studies, the burns
were conducted in stands containing heavy fuel loads due to
fire suppression, causing heat damage to the presettlement
trees. Belowground responses to burning in ponderosa pine
forests include a temporary increase in plant-available nitro-
gen (Vlamis et al. 1955; Covington and Sackett 1986, 1992;
Kovacic et al. 1986; Ryan and Covington 1986; Monleon
and Cromack 1996; White 1996). However, there is also evi-
dence that frequent burning (at 2-year intervals) over several
decades can decrease soil total nitrogen in ponderosa pine
forests (Wright and Hart 1997).
At endemic population levels, pine bark beetles (Den-
droctonus spp.) are often secondary agents of mortality that
attack trees already weakened by abiotic or biotic stresses.
Ponderosa pine stands that are even aged, at least 50- to
100-years old, with mean diameters at breast height (DBH)
of 20.3–30.5 cm and basal areas greater than 34.4 m2·ha–1 or
that have been subjected to drought, snow, wind, or light-
ning damage, are particularly susceptible to bark beetle out-
breaks (Sartwell and Stevens 1975; Dahlsten and Rowney
1983; Shrimpton and Thomson 1985; Cochran and Barrett
1993). Such outbreaks can be an important cause of tree
mortality in ponderosa pine forests (Dahlsten and Rowney
1983; Amman and Pasek 1986).
Studies of postsettlement ponderosa pines have shown
that stand thinning decreases attack rates of mountain pine
beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) (McCambridge
and Stevens 1982; Larsson et al. 1983; Olsen et al. 1996)
and increases resin flow in response to wounding (Kolb et
al. 1998). Greater tree resin flow in response to wounding is
associated with greater resistance to western pine beetle
(Dendroctonus
brevicomis
LeConte)
(Smith
1975)
and
mountain pine beetle (Reid et al. 1967; Raffa and Berryman
1982, 1983). However, no studies have examined the influ-
ence of stand treatments on characteristics of tree resistance
to bark beetles for presettlement ponderosa pines.
Pine sawflies (Neodiprion spp.) also occur in ponderosa
pine forests in the Southwest (McMillin and Wagner 1993).
In general, longer foliage with lower toughness is most sus-
ceptible to pine sawfly ovipositioning and herbivory (Wag-
ner and Zhang 1993; McMillin and Wagner 1996; McMillin
et al. 1996). A study of postsettlement ponderosa pines in
northern Arizona showed that a reduction of stand basal area
by thinning increased leaf toughness (Kolb et al. 1998), but
there is no information on whether stand thinning influences
the leaf toughness of presettlement ponderosa pines.
We have initiated a study designed to evaluate techniques
for improving the health of ponderosa pine forests in the
Gus Pearson Natural Area (GPNA) in northern Arizona
(Covington et al. 1997). The GPNA is a unique, relict stand
of presettlement ponderosa pines that has been protected
from harvesting and heavy grazing. Because of these special
characteristics, the GPNA has been the subject of several
previous studies of changes in forest condition since Euro-
American settlement (e.g., Avery et al. 1976; Sutherland
1983; White 1985; Biondi et al. 1994; Biondi 1996; Savage
et al. 1996; Covington et al. 1997).
In 1993, restoration treatments were applied to a portion
of the GPNA. These treatments were designed to simulate
the stand structure and fire disturbance regime that was pres-
ent before Euro-American settlement. The rationale for these
treatments is that ponderosa pine forests should be healthier
growing under conditions that simulate their long-term evo-
lutionary environment (i.e., low stand density and a fre-
quent, low-intensity fire regime). In this paper, we compare
growth, leaf physiological attributes, and characteristics of
resistance to pine bark beetles and pine sawflies of pre-
settlement trees among the control, thinned, and thinned and
burned treatments over the initial 2 years following treat-
ment. We predicted greater uptake of carbon, water, and nu-
trients and greater growth of presettlement trees in both
thinned treatments versus the control resulting from reduced
tree-to-tree competition for soil resources following thin-
ning. We also predicted greater uptake of carbon and nutri-
ents and greater growth of presettlement trees in the thinned
and burned treatment versus the thinned treatment due to ex-
pected increases in plant-available nitrogen following burn-
ing. Finally, we predicted that trees in both thinned
treatments would have greater resin flow, thicker phloem,
and tougher leaves than in the control because of a greater
availability of resources to support resin synthesis and leaf
development.
Study site
The study was conducted at the GPNA, located within the
Coconino National Forest approximately 10 km northwest of Flag-
staff, Ariz. The study site occupies 3 ha of the 30-ha GPNA at an

elevation of 2195–2255 m. Aspect is generally southwest, with
gentle topography (slopes 0–5%). Soils, derived from basalt and
volcanic cinders, are classified as a Brolliar stony clay loam, fine,
smectitic, Typic Argiboroll. Mean annual precipitation in Flagstaff
is 56.7 cm, with approximately one half of the precipitation falling
as snow from November to May and one half falling as rain pri-
marily during the late-summer monsoon season (July and August).
Mean annual air temperature in Flagstaff is 7.5°C. The climate is
subhumid, with early summer droughts common. The average
frost-free growing season is 94 days (Schubert 1974).
The vegetation community at the GPNA is a previously unhar-
vested ponderosa pine stand. Several species of grasses, forbs, and
shrubs comprise the understory, including Arizona fescue (Festuca
arizonica Vasey), mountain muhly (Muhlenbergia montana (Nutt.)
Hitchc.), mutton bluegrass (Poa fendleriana (Steud.) Vasey), pine
dropseed (Blepharoneuron tricholepis (Nash) Torr.), bottlebrush
squirreltail
(Sitanion
hystrix
J.G.
Smith),
showy
goldeneye
(Viguiera multiflora Nutt.), showy aster (Aster commutatus Torr.,
and Gray), spreading fleabane (Erigeron divergens Torr., and
Gray), snakeweed (Guterrezia spp.), and buckbrush (Ceanothus
fendleri Steud.) (Covington et al. 1997).
The GPNA stand is uneven-aged with even-aged groups of
pole-sized trees and uneven-aged groups of presettlement trees
(Schubert 1974, White 1985). Pole-sized trees (10–37.4 cm DBH)
are the predominant size class. At the start of the study (1992), the
age of the presettlement trees that we sampled ranged between 115
and 423 years (Table 1). The predominant Euro-American influ-
ences at the GPNA have been livestock grazing, which occurred
between 1876 and 1910, and fire suppression. The last natural fire
was in 1876; prior to that time, the fire return interval averaged ap-
proximately 2 years (Dieterich 1980).
Experimental design
The GPNA study site was subdivided into three largely contigu-
ous areas, each occupying approximately 1 ha (Covington et al.
1997). Each area was subjected to one of three treatments: control,
thinned, and thinned and burned. Each treatment area was further
subdivided into five approximately 0.20-ha plots that served as ex-
perimental units. We grouped these plots into five blocks (one plot
per treatment) that were used to implement all measurements.
Because our experimental design does not include true spatial
replication across the landscape, we used precautions to strengthen
our inferences regarding treatment effects. First, an earlier analysis
(Stone 1997) showed similar pretreatment levels of soil total nitro-
gen (P = 0.19), phosphorus (P = 0.25), organic matter (P = 0.19),
predawn leaf water potential (P = 0.82 for May to June, P = 0.25
for July to August), basal area growth rate (P = 0.96), stem diame-
ter (P = 0.32), and tree-to-tree competition index (P = 0.66) of
presettlement trees among the areas to be treated. Thus, resource
availability, tree growth, and tree physiological condition were
similar among areas prior to treatment.
Second, our interpretation of statistical results applies only to
the specific locations in the GPNA where the treatments were ap-
plied. Given the limited number of presettlement ponderosa pine
stands
remaining
in
the
Southwest
and
available
for
experimentation, true spatial replication with plot sizes large
enough for meaningful interpretation and with enough replication
for adequate statistical power was not possible for this study.
The thinning was conducted to simulate the presettlement (ca.
1876) stand structure, which was determined using dendro-
chronological techniques (Edminster and Olson 1996, Covington et
al. 1997). The average pretreatment basal area was 34.5 m2·ha–1
(average of 3100 trees·ha–1), which was retained in the control
area. In November of 1993, two thirds of the site was thinned to an
average basal area of 13.0 m2·ha–1 (average of 151 trees·ha–1), with
all presettlement trees and all trees >40 cm DBH retained. Follow-
ing the thinning treatment, the unthinned control area had an aver-
age DBH of 16.6 cm in 1993, while both thinned areas had an
average DBH of 40.9 cm (Covington et al. 1997). Thinning did not
substantially change light availability to the presettlement trees
used in the study, because the crowns of the thinned postsettlement
trees were lower than the crowns of the presettlement trees.
Half of the thinned area was also subjected to a low-intensity
prescribed burn on October 12, 1994. Prior to the prescribed burn,
the Oi (slightly decomposed organic matter), Oe (moderately de-
composed organic matter), and Oa (highly decomposed organic
matter) layers of the forest floor and woody debris were removed
to simulate presettlement forest floor conditions, which would
have had little forest floor litter and debris because of frequent
fires. The Oi layer (2–4 years of litterfall) was replaced prior to
burning with dried native grass foliage from a nearby prairie
(672 kg·ha–1 dry biomass) to simulate presettlement forest floor
conditions in which grasses were dominant. Fire characteristics
were previously reported by Covington et al. (1997). Flame length
averaged about 15 cm with maximum lengths of 60 cm. Maximum
cambial temperature (20 cm above the ground) during the fire var-
ied greatly among presettlement trees. Tissue-lethal temperatures
(>60°C) occurred in the cambium of two of five monitored trees
but only on one of the six thermocouples per tree. Surface soil
temperatures peaked in excess of 204°C during burning, while
subsurface temperatures (2–10 cm depth) exceeded 65°C for one
of five soil temperature monitoring sites.
We sampled 10 presettlement trees from each treatment area
(two trees per each of five plots) for leaf gas exchange, nutrient
concentration, and water potential every 2 weeks from May to Sep-
tember of 1995, and from May to August of 1996 (Table 1). All
sampled presettlement trees were located at least 10 m from the
plot boundary to reduce potential influences from other treatments,
and all had good crown condition with little dieback.
Water relations
We measured predawn (05:00–07:00) and midday (10:30–13:30)
leaf water potential with a pressure chamber (Plant Moisture Sys-
tems Instrument Co., Corvallis, Oreg.) on lower crown, 1-year-old
needles. Needles were cut from fascicles and sealed in plastic bags
with slightly moistened paper towels (no free water) and placed
into a cooler immediately after branch excision. Measurements of
water potential were made until three readings were obtained

age value used for each tree. We measured water potential within
3–4 h of branch excision based on findings that water potential of
conifer needles does not differ significantly from the time of shoot
excision up to 4 h afterward if samples are stored in a dark, humid
environment (Kaufmann and Thor 1982).

cover types: presettlement (old-growth trees ≥375.
cm DBH and
>116 years old), retained groups of postsettlement trees (saplings
1–9.9 cm DBH and 57–73 years old), and grassy openings. At each
location, SWC was measured at 0–15 cm and at 0–30 cm. We cal-
culated SWC from 15–30 cm using the following relationship:
[1]
SWC(15–30) = 2 × SWC(0–30) – SWC(0–15)
We estimated SWC for each treatment by averaging across canopy
cover types, because SWC typically did not differ significantly
(P > 0.10) among these types. Precipitation during the study was
recorded daily by a datalogger (Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan,
Utah) using a tipping rain gauge.
Leaf nutrients
At each sample date, we also collected 1-year-old needles adja-
cent to those used for the water potential measurements for nutri-
ent analysis. Needles were oven-dried at 70°C for 48 h and were
ground in a Thomas–Wiley mill (3383-L10 series, Thomas Scien-
tific, Swedesboro, N.J.) to pass through a 20-mesh screen. Ground
samples were digested using a modified micro-Kjeldahl digestion
technique (Parkinson and Allen 1975) and analyzed for total foliar
nitrogen (NT) and total foliar phosphorus (PT) with a Lachat flow
injection analyzer (Lachat Instruments Inc., Milwaukee, WI, USA,
Lachat Instruments, Inc. 1992a, 1992b). Leaf NT and PT were ex-
pressed both on a leaf mass basis (mg·g–1) to be comparable with
previous studies and on a leaf area basis (g·m–2) to be more compa-
rable to the leaf gas exchange measurements.
Leaf gas exchange
We measured instantaneous leaf area-based net photosynthetic
rate (A), stomatal conductance to water vapor (gs), and leaf inter-
cellular CO2 concentration (Ci) over a 30-s period with a portable,
closed-system LI-6200 infrared gas analyzer (LI-COR Inc., Lin-
coln, Neb.). These measurements were conducted on sunlit, lower
crown, 1-year-old needles on excised branches between 10:30 and
13:30, during peak light intensity. We measured over two consecu-
tive days for each biweekly sample period, with blocks one and
two measured on the first day and blocks three through five mea-
sured on the next day. The order of measurement for treatments on
each day was determined randomly. All gas exchange measure-
ments were made under photosynthetic light-saturated conditions
for ponderosa pine (photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD)

three-needle fascicles were used for each measurement. Electronic
digital calipers (Model CD- ′′
6 BS, Mitutoyo Corp., Tokyo, Japan)
were used to measure average leaf radius (±0.01 mm) of the six
needles. We calculated leaf area using leaf radius and the length of
the needles inside the 250-mL cuvette by a geometric model that
considers the fascicle as a dissected cylinder (Svenson and Davies
1992).
Tree growth
We measured DBH for all presettlement trees in the fall of 1992.
In October and November of 1996, we sampled three increment
cores (120° apart) from each tree with an increment borer. We then
measured yearly radial growth increment (to the nearest 0.001 mm)
after the cores were mounted and sanded (Stokes and Smiley
1968). Yearly DBH was calculated from the DBH in 1992 and the
average of the three radial increment measurements for each tree.
We then converted DBH values to basal areas at breast height and
calculated basal area increment (BAI) for the 5 years prior to treat-
ment (1989–1993) and the 1995 and 1996 posttreatment years.
Treatment mean BAI for each year was calculated for trees without
missing rings. We used a subsample of presettlement trees located
at least 10 m from a plot border, which included those trees used
for the leaf water potential, nutrient, and gas exchange measure-
ments,
for

differences

BAI
(Table 1). We also compared the percent change in BAI between
1995 (a wet year) and 1996 (a dry year) among treatments.
Pine bark beetle resistance characteristics
We measured resin flow and phloem thickness of 71 pre-
settlement trees in late June of 1995 and 1996 (Table 1). All sam-
pled presettlement trees were located at least 10 m from the plot
boundary to reduce potential influences from other treatments, and
all had good crown condition with little dieback. We wounded
each tree once to the outside of the xylem on the west side at a
height of 1 m with a 2.54-cm diameter Osborne arch punch (Model
149, King Bearing Co., Flagstaff, Ariz.), removed the phloem, and
collected resin with funnels attached to 10-mL vials over the first
24-h period following wounding. Vials were checked periodically
and replaced to prevent overfilling. We measured thickness
(±0.01 mm) of the removed phloem with electronic digital calipers
(Model CD- ′′
6
BS, Mitutoyo Corp., Tokyo, Japan) with two per-
pendicular measurements that were averaged for each tree.
Pine sawfly resistance characteristic
We measured leaf toughness on the same 10 presettlement trees
per treatment used for the leaf water potential measurements
(Table 1) biweekly from May to September of 1995 and from May
to August of 1996. We collected 10–12 lower-crown, 1-year-old
needles prior to dawn (05:00–07:00) from an excised branch. The
needles were then sealed in plastic bags, and transported to the lab-
oratory in a cool, dark environment. At the laboratory, leaf tough-
ness was measured as the amount of pressure required to penetrate
the needle with a penetrometer (TA-XT2 Texture Analyser, Texture
Technologies Corp., Scarsdale, N.Y.) on the same day as the col-
lection. A constant penetration depth (1 mm), needle velocity, and
needle surface area was used for all measurements; thus, differ-
ences in toughness are expressed in units of mass (g). We calcu-
lated an average leaf toughness for each tree by averaging three
measurements on each of five needles from different fascicles.
Data analysis
We compared differences in the response variables among the
control, thinned, and thinned and burned areas of the GPNA using
a fixed-effects analysis of variance (ANOVA) on plot means for
data pooled over dates and years. For variables sampled on multi-
ple dates each year, sources of variation in the ANOVA were: year,
date(year), block, treatment, year × treatment, and date(year) ×
treatment. The F test for year was calculated using the date(year)
mean square as the error term, and the F test for year × treatment
was calculated using date(year) × treatment as the error term; F
tests of all other effects were calculated using the error mean
square. For variables sampled only once each year, sources of vari-
ation in the ANOVA were: year, block, treatment, and year × treat-
ment. The identification of treatment effects with our design

assumes pretreatment similarity in tree resources and tree condition
among treatment areas. As noted previously (see Experimental de-
sign), our pretreatment data supports this assumption.
Variances were homogeneous among treatments, dates, and
years for all variables as indicated by Hartley’s test (Neter et al.
1990), except for A, gs, and resin flow. We log transformed the A
and gs data and square-root transformed the resin flow data to sta-
bilize variances. Also, we used average BAI for 5 years prior to
treatment as a covariate in the analysis of posttreatment BAI to ad-
just posttreatment BAI to the same pretreatment BAI. For analyses
resulting in significant year × treatment or date(year) × treatment
interactions, we used ANOVA on data from each sample date to
identify significant differences among treatment means at each
date. Mean comparisons among treatments were performed with
Fisher’s protected LSD, and a threshold P value of 0.10 was used
in all tests because of the inherent large variability of a population
of old trees. All statistical analyses were conducted using the SAS
statistical package (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, N.C.).
Water relations
Total annual precipitation at the study site was greater in
1995 (483 mm) than in 1996 (425 mm). Also, the seasonal
pattern of precipitation varied between years (Fig. 1).
Compared with 1995, precipitation in 1996 was 72% lower
for January to June and 105% greater for July to December.
Total precipitation for January to June was 42% greater than
the long-term average (1960–1990) in 1995 and 60% lower
than the long-term average in 1996. Total precipitation for
July to December was 52% lower than the long-term aver-
age in 1995 and 1% lower than the long-term average in
1996.
SWC varied significantly among sample dates within a
year at both depths (0–15 and 15–30 cm) (Table 2) and gen-
erally followed seasonal variation in precipitation (Figs. 1
and 2). SWC also differed significantly among treatments,

was
significant
(Table 2). Average SWC at 0–15 cm was highest in the
thinned treatment, intermediate in the thinned and burned
treatment, and lowest in the control (Table 3, Fig. 2). Aver-
age SWC at 15–30 cm was highest in the thinned and
burned treatment, intermediate in the thinned treatment, and
lowest in the control (Table 3, Fig. 2). Average differences
in SWC among treatments were greater in 1995 than in 1996
(Fig. 2), but treatment ranks were the same in both years.
Tree predawn water potential (PWP) differed significantly
between years and among dates within a year (Table 2). Av-
erage PWP was lower in 1996 than in 1995 (Table 4). The
seasonal pattern of PWP also differed between years. In
1995, PWP was 0.2–0.3 MPa higher in late May than during
the summer months (Fig. 3). In contrast, PWP in 1996 was
highest in late July and early August, and these values were
0.3–0.5 MPa greater (depending on treatment) than the low-
est values, which occurred in late June (Fig. 3). The highest
average PWP for a sample date in 1996 (–0.9 MPa) was the
same as the lowest average PWP for a sample date in 1995.
Tree PWP also varied significantly among treatments, and
the date(year) × treatment interaction was significant (Table 2).
Average PWP was significantly greater in both thinned treat-
ments than in the control (Table 3). In each year, significant
differences in PWP among treatments generally occurred on
those dates with the lowest average PWP; there was no dif-
ference in PWP among treatments on dates with high aver-
age PWP (Fig. 3).
Midday water potential (MWP) of trees also differed sig-
nificantly between years and among dates within a year
(Table 2). Average MWP was lower in 1996 than in 1995
(Table 4). In 1995, MWP decreased by approximately
0.3 MPa from late May to late June, after which differences
among dates were small (Fig. 4). In 1996, MWP was similar
among dates, except for July 8, which was about 0.2 MPa
greater than other dates (Fig. 4). MWP did not differ signifi-
cantly among treatments, and all interactions with treatment
were also not significant (Table 2, Fig. 4).
Leaf nutrients
Leaf NTarea differed significantly between years (Table 2),
with greater NTarea in 1996 than in 1995 (Table 4). Both leaf
NTarea and NTmass differed significantly among dates within a
year (Table 2), with generally greater values in July and Au-
gust than in May and June (data not shown). Leaf NTmass and
NTarea also differed significantly among treatments (Table 2).
Average NTmass over all dates and years was significantly
greater in the thinned and burned treatment than in the con-
trol and the thinned treatment, whereas NTarea was signifi-
cantly greater in both thinned treatments than in the control
(Table 3). The significant year × treatment interaction in
NTarea occurred because differences among treatments were
less in 1995 (control, 1.43 ± 0.0184 g·m–2 (mean ± SE);
thinned, 1.54 ± 0.0288 g·m–2; thinned and burned, 1.53 ±
0.0347 g·m–2) than in 1996 (control, 1.45 ± 0.0252 g·m–2;
thinned, 1.61 ± 0.0311 g·m–2; thinned and burned, 1.65 ±
0.0410 g·m–2).
Average leaf PTmass and PTarea differed significantly be-
tween years (Table 2), with greater values in 1996 than in
1995 (Table 4). Leaf PTmass also differed significantly among
treatments, and the year × treatment interaction was signifi-
cant (Table 2). Average leaf PTmass was greatest in the con-
trol, intermediate in the thinned and burned treatment, and
lowest in the thinned treatment (Table 3). The significant
year × treatment interaction for PTmass occurred because dif-
ferences among treatments varied between years. In 1995,
PTmass was greater in the thinned and burned treatment (1.42 ±
0.0543 mg·g–1) and control (1.42 ± 0.0179 mg·g–1) than in
the thinned treatment (1.35 ± 0.0356 mg·g–1). In 1996,
PTmass was greatest in the control (1.58 ± 0.0273 mg·g–1),

Leaf gas exchange
Leaf A differed significantly among dates within a year
(Table 2). In 1995, A generally decreased from late May to
early August, and then increased in mid-August and early
September (Fig. 5). In 1996, A was lowest in May and June
and increased in July and August (Fig. 5). Leaf A also dif-
fered significantly among treatments and the date(year) ×
treatment interaction was significant (Table 2). Average A
was significantly greater in both thinned treatments than in
the control (Table 3). In 1995, A was significantly lower in
the thinned and burned treatment than in the thinned treat-
ment and control in late May (Fig. 5). In late June and
mid-August of 1995, A was significantly greater in the
thinned treatment than in the thinned and burned treatment
and control, which were similar (Fig. 5). In 1996, A was sig-
nificantly greater in both thinned treatments than in the con-
trol in May and early June, with no significant differences
for the rest of the sample dates (Fig. 5).
Leaf gs was significantly correlated with A (r = 0.830, P <
0.001, n = 225, over all treatments, dates, and years), al-
though the results of the AVOVA differed somewhat be-
tween the two variables (Table 2). In particular, average gs
differed significantly between years, with higher gs in 1995
than in 1996 (Table 4). The year × treatment interaction was
significant for gs because treatment differences varied be-
tween years. In 1995, average gs was lower in the thinned
and burned treatment (40.0 ± 3.40 mmol·m–2·s–1) than in the
thinned treatment (47.5 ± 4.10 mmol·m–2·s–1) and the control
(44.8 ± 4.10 mmol·m–2·s–1). In contrast, all treatments had
similar average gs in 1996 (control, 29.2 ± 3.40 mmol·m–2·s–1;
thinned, 30.3 ± 2.50 mmol·m–2·s–1; thinned and burned,
30.2 ± 2.40 mmol·m–2·s–1).
The only significant sources of variation for leaf Ci were
date(year) and block (Table 2). Leaf Ci was significantly
correlated with gs (r = 0.528, P < 0.001, n = 225) but was not
correlated with A (r = 0.07, P = 0.281, n = 225). Correlation

thinned treatment or the control (Table 3). Tree phloem
thickness did not differ significantly among treatments or
years, and their interaction was not significant (Table 5).
Pine sawfly resistance characteristic
Leaf toughness varied significantly among dates within a
year and among treatments (Table 2). Leaf toughness was
greatest in the thinned treatment, intermediate in the thinned
and burned treatment, and lowest in the control (Table 3).
Although statistically significant (Table 2), differences in
leaf toughness among dates within years were small (maxi-
mum difference of 12% in 1995 and 21% in 1996) with little
systematic variation (data not shown).
The difference in precipitation between the 2 years in-
cluded in our study caused pronounced interannual differ-
ences in the growth and physiology of presettlement trees at
the GPNA. Late-winter and spring precipitation was 42%
greater than average in 1995 compared with 60% below av-
erage in 1996. Compared with 1995, the average BAI of
presettlement trees was 33% lower in 1996. Lower BAI of
presettlement trees in 1996 can be explained by lower PWP
(0.34 MPa), A (27%), and gs (47%) compared with 1995.
Resin flow in 1996 was 53% greater than in 1995, suggest-
ing a relative shift in the priority for carbon allocation from
growth in 1995 to the production of defensive compounds
such as resin in 1996. This shift is consistent with the
growth-differentiation hypothesis, where environmental con-
ditions conducive to growth, such as 1995 in our study, limit
carbohydrate allocation to resin production (Lorio 1986,
1993).
There are several possible explanations for the increase in
BAI of presettlement trees in the thinned treatments com-
pared with the control. Leaf A of trees in the thinned treat-
ments averaged 5% higher than in the control, suggesting
that more photosynthate was available for growth in the
thinned treatments. Further, treatment differences in A were
most pronounced during the periods of the year with severe
drought (mid-May to mid-June of 1996), when PWP was the
lowest and differences in PWP between the thinned treat-
ments and the control were largest. Lower PWP and A of
presettlement trees in the control versus the thinned treat-
ments during this droughty period provides a physiological
explanation for the greater decrease in BAI between 1995
and 1996 for trees in the control. Of the physiological vari-
ables that were significantly correlated with A (gs, PWP,
MWP, NTarea), only PWP and NTarea differed significantly be-
tween the thinned treatments and the control, suggesting an
influence of low PWP and NTarea in limiting A of trees in the
control. The lack of a significant difference in Ci and gs be-
tween the thinned treatments and the control suggests non-
stomatal limitations to A of trees in the control, such as by
enzymatic constraints associated with low leaf NTarea.
Differences in BAI among treatments also might be re-
lated to leaf physiological characteristics in the upper crown
that were not included in our measurements. We have evi-
dence from an earlier study that the NT of 1-year-old foliage
on sunlit branches does not differ significantly between
lower, middle, and upper crown positions of the pre-
settlement trees at our study site (Stone 1997). However, our
measurements of water potential in the lower crown of the
presettlement trees were probably greater (less negative)

than water potential in the upper crown because of the de-
crease in water potential that occurs with increasing tree
height due to gravity, and a greater hydraulic resistance to
water flux in the xylem with increasing transport distance
(Fredericksen et al. 1996; Mencuccini and Grace 1996; Ryan
and Yoder 1997). Thus, our light-saturated values of A for
the lower crown may be greater than A in the upper crown
because of greater water potential in the lower crown. Dif-
ferences in A among treatments might have been even more
pronounced in the upper crown than in the lower crown if
threshold values of water potential leading to stomatal clo-
sure occurred more often in the upper crown in the control,
where water availability (PWP, SWC) was typically lower
than in the thinned treatments.
Greater BAI for presettlement trees in the thinned treat-
ments compared with the control also might be related to
greater leaf area. In fact, we have evidence from an earlier
study (Stone 1997) that bud mass and average leaf length of
presettlement trees at the GPNA increased in the thinned
treatments in the first year following thinning (1994). Leaf
area production in the control might be limited by low leaf
water potential or leaf NT, or perhaps because of greater pro-
portional allocation of carbohydrates to root growth because
of drier soil (e.g., Keyes and Grier 1981).
A result of the study that we did not anticipate was the
higher leaf PTmass for trees in the control compared with
both thinned treatments. There is evidence that the basalt-
derived soils in northern Arizona have phosphorus concen-
trations that do not limit ponderosa pine growth (Potter
1964; Klemmedson 1994). If phosphorus is not seriously
limiting, then greater growth rates in the thinned treatments
could have caused lower leaf PTmass because of a dilution of
leaf phosphorus by tissue growth.
Negative effects of prescribed burning on the physiologi-
cal condition, growth, and survival of presettlement ponder-
osa pines have been reported in other studies where fuel
loads were not reduced prior to burning (Sutherland et al.
1991; Swezy and Agee 1991). In our study, where fuels
where greatly reduced before burning by thinning post-
settlement trees and raking the forest floor litter away from
the base of the presettlement trees, tree BAI in the thinned
and burned treatment was similar to BAI in the thinned
treatment 1 and 2 years following the burn. While A of trees
in the thinned and burned treatment was lower than A of
trees in the thinned treatment and similar to A in the control
on three dates in the first year following the burn (1995),
this effect of burning did not extend into the next year
(1996) and apparently had little overall impact on tree BAI.
We hypothesized that thinning the postsettlement trees
would increase resin flow and phloem thickness of the pre-
settlement trees because of increased resource availability.
Partially consistent with our hypothesis, tree resin flow in-
creased above that of the control only when thinning was
combined with prescribed burning. Average resin flow of
trees in the thinned and burned treatment was 184% greater
than trees in the thinned treatment and 239% greater than
trees in the control. One explanation for the greater resin
flow for trees in the thinned and burned treatment compared
with the control or the thinned treatment is that the burning
stimulated resin production because of heat damage to cam-
bium, phloem, or xylem tissues. Wounding of pines often in-
creases resin production (Kozlowski and Pallardy 1997), and
lethal temperatures during the fire (>60°C) occurred in the
cambium of two of the five trees that were implanted with
thermocouples (Covington et al. 1997). Another explanation
is that trees in the thinned and burned treatment had more
carbohydrate available for resin production than trees in the

control. High carbohydrate supply has been linked to high
resin
production
in
previous
studies
with
conifers
(Christiansen et al. 1987; Dunn and Lorio 1992). This expla-
nation may partly account for the difference in resin flow
between trees in the thinned and burned treatment and the
control because of their difference in A, but it seems insuffi-
cient to account for the difference in resin flow between the
thinned and burned treatment and the thinned treatment be-
cause their A was similar.
Regardless of the mechanism, we find it interesting that
resin flow was greatest in the treatment that most closely
matches the recent (past several thousands of years) evolu-
tionary environment of ponderosa pine, which was charac-
terized by frequent, low-intensity fires that maintained low
tree densities (Cooper 1960; Dietrich and Swetnam 1984;
Covington and Moore 1994; Swetnam and Baisan 1996).
Our results suggest that restoration of these presettlement
conditions at the GPNA will increase resistance of pre-
settlement ponderosa pines to bark beetle attack because of
higher resin flow. Thus, presettlement trees in the thinned
and burned treatment of the GPNA appear to offer a better
defended resource to bark beetles compared with trees in the
control or thinned treatment.
Our hypothesis that thinning would increase leaf tough-
ness was supported. Compared with the control, average leaf
toughness was 10% greater in the thinned treatment and 6%
greater in the thinned and burned treatment. Based on this
result, presettlement trees in the thinned treatments at the
GPNA may be more resistant to pine sawfly attack because
tough leaves can inhibit sawfly feeding and oviposition
(Wagner and Zhang 1993; McMillin and Wagner 1996;
McMillin et al. 1996).
Despite their great age, the presettlement trees at the
GPNA were still responsive to a thinning treatment aimed at
restoring the stand structure present before Euro-American
settlement. Thinning of competing postsettlement trees im-
proved the physiological condition of the presettlement trees
as indicated by greater growth; greater uptake of carbon, wa-
ter, and nitrogen; and greater defensive capability against
pine sawflies for the second and third years after thinning.
Also, our results show that prescribed fire in the fall can be
safely used at the GPNA with no apparent detrimental ef-
fects on presettlement trees, if fuel loads are greatly reduced
before burning. Further, defense against bark beetles (i.e.,
resin flow) in the presettlement ponderosa pines at the
GPNA appears to be stimulated by prescribed burning in
combination with thinning. The applicability of our findings
at the GPNA to restoration projects at other sites containing
presettlement trees should be tested in future studies.
