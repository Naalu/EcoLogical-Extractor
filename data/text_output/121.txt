Abstract 
Southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest ecosystems have become uncharacteristically 
dense as a result of livestock grazing, logging, and fire exclusion, which has led to an increase in 
vulnerability to high-severity, landscape-scale crown fires. In 2002, the Ecological Restoration Institute 
(ERI) at Northern Arizona University (NAU) and the Apache-Sitgreaves (A-S) National Forests 
cooperatively implemented a replicated ecological restoration experiment to (1) determine site-specific 
reference conditions, (2) measure and evaluate contemporary (pre-treatment) forest structure variables, 
and (3) test responses to three treatments: control, full restoration, and burn only. The site is located in a 
ponderosa pine forest and spans an elevation gradient from the pinyon-juniper ecotone to the dry mixed 
conifer ecotone. Reconstructed total basal area (BA) averaged 40 ft²/acre and total tree density averaged 
35 trees/acre across all treatments indicating that a relatively open forest structure existed at the Mineral 
site in 1880. By 2002, prior to treatment, total BA had increased by more than 300% to an average of 125 
ft²/acre and total tree density increased by more than 1000% to an average of 376 trees/acre. In 2009, 
following treatment, the full restoration treatment  reduced total BA by 53% from 135 ft²/acre to 64 
ft²/acre and total tree density by 83% from 404 trees/acre to 67 trees/acre. In the burn only treatment, total 
BA increased by 3% from 120 ft²/acre to 123 ft²/acre and tree density was reduced by 18% from 339 
trees/acre to 279 trees/acre between 2002 and 2009. In the control, little change in total BA and tree 
density occurred between 2002 and 2009. Post-treatment diameter distributions in the full restoration 
treatment closely matched the historical distribution. In contrast, the burn only treatment had only small 
reductions in the lower diameter classes. Following treatment, about 15% of the presettlement trees died 
or were cut in the full restoration treatment compared to 23% mortality of presettlement trees in the burn 
only treatment. Ten percent of presettlement trees died in the control during the same time without active 
treatment. One year after application, the full restoration treatment shifted forest structure and diameter 
distributions within the range of variability historically present at the Mineral site. In contrast, the burn 
only treatment did not shift forest structure and diameter distributions within the historical range of 
variability in the short term. The ERI will conduct a five-year remeasurement at the Mineral site in the 
summer of 2013 and will build upon the information provided in this report to evaluate five-year post-
treatment responses on forest structure, regeneration, surface fuels, canopy cover, herbaceous understory, 
and potential fire behavior. 
Introduction 
Southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest ecosystems have become uncharacteristically 
dense as a result of livestock grazing, logging, and fire exclusion (Cooper 1960, Covington et al. 1997) 
which has led to an increase in vulnerability to high-severity, landscape-scale crown fires (Allen et al. 
2002). The two largest fires in Arizona history — the 2002 Rodeo-Chediski fire (468,638 acres) and the 
2011 Wallow fire (538,049 acres total, 522,642 acres in Arizona) — occurred in the White Mountains of 
east-central Arizona (InciWeb.org). In addition to the loss of critical wildlife habitat and old-growth trees 
and the possibility that previously forested areas may experience type conversion (Savage and Mast 2005, 
Roccaforte et al. 2012), the fires have cost a combined $417 million to date including fire suppression, 
loss of property, and rehabilitation (Western Forestry Leadership Coalition 2010). 
In recent decades, managers have implemented restoration and fuels treatments in altered forests to 
restore ecological integrity and increase resilience to disturbance events, such as high-severity crown fires 

3 
 
and insect outbreaks (Covington et al. 1997, Stephens et al. 2009, Roccaforte et al. 2010) and associated 
research about these treatments has increased substantially (see  Fulé et al. 2012). In 2002, the Ecological 
Restoration Institute (ERI) at Northern Arizona University (NAU) and the Apache-Sitgreaves (A-S) 
National Forests cooperatively implemented a replicated ecological restoration experiment on four 
replicated experimental blocks comprising approximately 400 acres in a ponderosa pine forest near 
Springerville, Arizona. 
The goals of this study were to (1) determine site-specific reference conditions based on 
dendrochronological reconstructions of historical forest structure, (2) measure and evaluate contemporary 
(pre-treatment) forest structure variables, and (3) test responses to three treatments: control, full 
restoration, and burn only. 
Methods 
Study Area 
The study site is located within the Mineral Ecosystem Management Area (EMA) in east-central Arizona 
on the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests. The site has a north aspect with slopes ranging between 0 – 
27%. Elevations range from approximately 7,700 – 8,400 feet. The site is located in a ponderosa pine 
forest and spans an elevation gradient from the pinyon-juniper ecotone to the dry mixed conifer ecotone. 
Overstory tree species present at the site include: ponderosa pine, Gambel oak, juniper, pinyon, 
southwestern white pine, Douglas-fir, white fir, and aspen (see Table 1 for scientific names of species). 
Shrub species present include: wax current (Ribes cereum), Woods’ rose (Rosa woodsii), and Fendler’s 
ceanothus (Ceanothus fendleri). The understory herbaceous plant community is characterized by a mix of 
mostly native perennial graminoids and forbs. Common perennial grasses include squirreltail (Elymus 
elymoides), Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica), mountain muhly (Muhlenbergia montana), muttongrass 
(Poa fendleriana), Junegrass (Koeleria macrantha), and there is also a dominant component of sedge 
species (Carex spp.). Common forbs include ragworts (Packera spp.), fleabanes (Erigeron spp.),

Eutroboralfs, Lithic Argiborolls, and Eutric Glossoboralfs, of fine to cobbly clay loam texture, derived 
from volcanic parent material (USDA Forest Service 1987). Between 1979 and 2009, annual precipitation 
at Greer, Arizona (elevation 8,200 feet, approximately 14 miles southeast of the study site) averaged 
21.28 inches with an average January temperature of 30.8 degrees Fahrenheit and an average July 
temperature of 64.4 degrees Fahrenheit (Western Regional Climate Center, www.wrcc.dri.edu, accessed 
5/8/13).  Most precipitation occurs in winter and during summer monsoon storms. Land use history at the 
site includes grazing beginning in the late 1800s and fire suppression since the early 20th century.  
Experimental Design 
We established four experimental blocks of approximately 100 acres each, each representing one 
complete replicate (Figure 1). Each block was divided into treatment units of about 33 acres. One of three 
treatments, untreated control, full restoration, and burn-only was randomly assigned to each unit. The 
thinning design in the full restoration treatment was developed according to the site-specific historical 
(pre-1880) pattern of tree species composition and spatial arrangement (Covington et al. 1997). We chose 
the year 1880 because it represented disruption of the historical frequent fire regime and Euro-American 
settlement of the Southwest (Moore et al. 1999). All living ponderosa pines older than 1880 (i.e., 
presettlement trees) or > 16 inches diameter at breast height (dbh) were retained. Presettlement ponderosa 
pines of any size were identified in the field based on yellow bark coloration and other tree characteristics 
(White 1985). In addition, wherever evidence of presettlement conifer material was encountered (i.e., 
snags, logs, stumps, stump holes), an average of 1.5 postsettlement (i.e., trees established after 1880) 
ponderosa pine “replacement” trees (if > 16 inches dbh) or three ponderosa pine replacement trees (if ≤ 
16 inches) were retained within a 60-foot radius of the dead structure. The purpose of leaving more trees 
when they were ≤ 16 inches was to account for the smaller amount of biomass contributed by smaller 
diameter replacement trees, possible loss of presettlement evidence due to fire or decomposition,

and to allow for unintended mortality resulting from prescribed fire (Covington et al. 1997). Oak and 
aspen were not thinned. Slash was lopped and scattered. Accumulated forest floor material was raked 
away from living presettlement trees to prevent cambial girdling (Sackett et al. 1996) and away from 
large snags to limit ignition during prescribed fires. Treatment units were broadcast burned in October of 
2008 (Figure 2). 
Field Methods 
We installed 20 permanent sample plots on a 197-foot grid in each unit to characterize forest structure and 
fuels (n = 4 experimental blocks; 4 blocks x 3 treatments x 20 plots = 240 plots). We collected pre-

treatment data in the summer of 2002 and post-treatment data in the summer of 2009. We measured all 
trees taller than breast height (4.5 feet) within a 1/10th acre (37 foot radius) circular plot. We recorded 
species, condition (living or snag/log classes from Thomas et al. 1979), dbh, total height, crown base 
height, and a preliminary field classification of pre- or post-settlement origin for each tree located within 
the plot. We identified potentially presettlement ponderosa pine trees based on size (> 16 inch diameter at 
stump height [dsh], 16 inches above ground level) or yellow bark (White 1985). We identified other 
conifers as potentially presettlement if dsh > 16 inches and aspen were noted as potentially presettlement 
if dsh > 8 inches. We collected increment cores for all potentially presettlement trees and a 10% 
subsample of all postsettlement trees to determine age and past size. 
We collected regeneration and surface fuels data before and after treatment; however, these data are not 
presented in this report due to high variability in the first year following treatment. Regeneration and fuels 
results will be collected and analyzed following the five-year post-treatment remeasurement in the 
summer of 2013.

Analysis 
We mounted and surfaced tree increment cores and visually cross-dated (Stokes and Smiley 1968) them 
with local tree-ring chronologies. We counted rings on cores that could not be cross-dated, usually 
junipers or young trees. We estimated additional years to the center ring using a pith locator (concentric 
circles which were matched to the curvature and density of the inner rings) for cores that missed the pith 
(Applequist 1958). 
We reconstructed historical forest structure (tree density, basal area [BA], and diameter distribution by 
species) using dendroecological methods (Fulé et al. 1997; Mast et al. 1999, Bakker et al. 2008). We 
reconstructed diameter for all living trees by subtracting the radial growth since 1880 measured on 
increment cores and estimated death date of dead trees on the basis of tree condition class using diameter-
dependent snag decomposition rates (Thomas et al. 1979; Rogers et al. 1984). 
Forest structure reconstruction methods were based on the assumption that evidence of trees (i.e., snags, 
logs, stumps, stump holes) present in 1880 was intact and correctly identified during pre-treatment 
inventory. The probability that this occurred was relatively high given the absence of fire since 1880 
combined with the semiarid environment limiting the decomposition of conifer wood (Fulé et al. 1997, 
Mast et al. 1999, Huffman et al. 2001) and because field crews were trained to identify the presence and 
species of presettlement structures. Moore et al. (2004) found that reconstruction techniques in a similar 
environment and forest type were reliable within ±10% for tree density over approximately 90 years. 
We analyzed differences of total BA and total tree density among treatments using analysis of variance 
(ANOVA). If a significant effect was found, the ANOVA was followed by Tukey’s honestly significant 
difference (HSD) post-hoc multiple comparisons test. All data met the assumptions of normality and 
homogeneity of variance based on the Shapiro-Wilk test and Levine test. Treatment differences were 
assessed at α = 0.05.  
Results 
Forest Structure 
Total BA and tree density were lowest in 1880, highest in 2002, and variable in 2009 depending on 
treatment. Reconstructed total BA averaged 40 ft²/acre and ranged between 38 – 44 ft²/acre and total tree 
density averaged 35 trees/acre and ranged between 30–37 trees/acre across all treatments (Table 2) 
indicating that relatively open forest structure existed at the Mineral site in 1880. There were no 
differences in total BA (F = 0.1, p = 0.9) or total tree density (F = 0.2, p = 0.8) among treatments in 1880 
(Table 2). Ponderosa pine was the dominant tree species at the Mineral site in 1880, making up about 
95% of total BA and total tree density. Overstory composition differed between blocks in 1880. Block 1 
was comprised of ponderosa pine, juniper, and Gambel oak; block 2 was comprised of ponderosa pine 
only; block 3 was comprised of ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, and aspen; and block 4 was comprised of

ponderosa pine, aspen, Douglas-fir, and white fir. Pinyon and southwestern white pine were not detected 
at the Mineral site in 1880. 
In 2002, prior to treatment, total BA averaged 125 ft²/acre and ranged between 120 – 135 ft²/acre and total 
tree density averaged 376 trees/acre and ranged between 175 – 470 trees/acre. There were no differences 
in total BA (F = 0.5, p = 0.6) or total tree density (F = 0.2, p = 0.9) among treatments (Table2). Between 
1880 and 2002, total BA and total tree density increased by more than 300% and more than 1000%, 
respectively. Ponderosa pine was the dominant tree species at the Mineral site prior to treatment, making 
up about 95% of tree density and BA in 2002. 
In 2009, following treatment, forest structure was variable depending on treatment. In the control, total 
BA increased from 121 ft²/acre in 2002 to 128 ft²/acre in 2009 and total tree density decreased from 384 
trees/acre in 2002 to 371 trees/acre in 2009 (Table 2). Full restoration treatments reduced total BA by 
53% from 135 ft²/acre to 64 ft²/acre and total tree density by 83% from 404 trees/acre to 67 trees/acre 
between 2002 and 2009. In the burn only treatment, BA increased by 3% from 120 ft²/acre to 123 ft²/acre 
and tree density was reduced by 18% from 339 trees/acre to 279 trees/acre between 2002 and 2009. In 
2009, the full restoration treatment was significantly different in total BA (F = 6.6, p = 0.02) compared to 
both the control and the burn only treatment. For total tree density (F = 7.3, p = 0.01), the full restoration 
was significantly different compared to the control but not significantly different compared to the burn 
only treatment and the burn only was not significantly different compared to the control (Table 2). There 
was no significant difference between the control and burn only in 2009. Ponderosa pine was the 
dominant tree species at the Mineral site following treatment, making up ≥ 90% of tree density and > 95% 
of BA across all treatments. In 2002 and 2009, overstory composition differed between blocks. Block 1 
was comprised of ponderosa pine, Gambel oak, pinyon, and juniper; block 2 was comprised of ponderosa 
pine only; and blocks 3 and 4 were comprised of ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, white fir, southwestern 
white pine, and aspen. 
Reconstructed (1880) diameter distributions for each treatment were unimodal (Figure 3, A-C). Two-
thirds of the trees in 1880 had a dbh between 8 — 20 inches and only 16% — 27% of the trees had dbh < 
8 inches. By 2002, the diameter distribution had shifted from a unimodal to a reverse J-shaped 
distribution with 62% – 69% of the trees having a dbh < 8 inches (Figure 3, D-F). Trees > 24 inches 
decreased from 2.3 trees/acre in 1880 to 1.5 trees/acre by 2002. By 2009, the diameter distribution in the 
control remained reverse J-shaped with only a slight decrease from 2002 in total tree density (Figure 3, 
G). Although total tree density in the full restoration treatment was nearly double the historical mean, the 
diameter distribution shifted from a reverse J-shape back to a unimodal distribution with only 15% of the 
trees having a dbh < 8 inches (Figure 3, H [Note scale differences]). The post-treatment diameter 
distribution in the burn only treatment remained dominated by the lower dbh classes (Figure 3, I). 
Tree Mortality 
Tree mortality varied with treatment.  In the control, 15% of the trees alive in 2002 died by 2009 (Figure

other causes between 2002 and 2009. Three presettlement trees (all ponderosa pine), or 5.6% of the 
presettlement trees alive prior to treatment, were cut in the full restoration treatment. Five presettlement 
trees (one ponderosa pine, four aspen), or 9% of the presettlement trees alive prior to treatment, died in 
the full restoration treatment. In the burn only treatment, 18% of the trees alive in 2002 died by 2009. Six 
presettlement trees (four ponderosa pine, two juniper), or 23% of the presettlement trees alive prior to 
treatment, died in the burn only treatment (Figure 4). 
Discussion 
This experiment is part of the ERI’s Long-term Ecological Assessment and Restoration Network 
(LEARN) which is designed to test treatment alternatives and long-term responses using a robust 
replicated study design. Other sites within the network are located in Arizona at Mt. Trumbull, Kaibab 
National Forest/Grand Canyon National Park, and the Centennial Forest; and the San Juan National 
Forest in Colorado. The addition of the Mineral site to this network fills an important gap by providing 
information about restoration and burn- only treatments in the White Mountains in the heart of the largest 
contiguous ponderosa pine ecosystem in the world. Furthermore, results from this study will inform 
planners and land managers involved in the upcoming landscape-scale (2.4 million acres) restoration 
project known as the Four Forests Restoration Initiative (4FRI).

Forest Structural and Compositional Changes 
Prior to Euro-American settlement, the forest at Mineral had a relatively open forest structure and was 
heavily dominated by ponderosa pine. The average BA values/tree density (40 ft²/acre, 35 trees/acre) as 
well as their range (13-70 ft²/acre , 13-59 trees/acre) was similar to that found at other LEARN ponderosa 
pine sites, including Fort Valley (average 49 ft²/acre, 39 trees/acre, range 27-80 ft²/acre, 24–50 trees/acre) 
and Mt. Trumbull (average 32 ft²/acre, 25 trees/acre, range 20-60 ft²/acre, 14-33 trees/acre) (Stoddard 
2011). 
Between 1880 and 2002, both average BA and average tree density increased substantially in all units at 
Mineral. Similar increases in BA and tree density were also observed at the Fort Valley (Fulé et al. 2001) 
and Mt. Trumbull (Waltz et al. 2003) LEARN sites. While ponderosa pine was the tree species exhibiting 
the greatest increases at Mineral, there were also increases in several mesic species, including 
southwestern white pine, white fir, and Douglas-fir — all of which either had limited presence or were 
absent historically. 
After treatment, in 2009, the full restoration treatment produced statistically significant differences in BA 
and tree density compared to the control.  Although total BA in the full restoration was about 1.5 times 
greater and total tree density was nearly double the 1880 values, BA was reduced by more than 50% and 
density was reduced by more than 80% compared to pre-treatment levels, moving these areas close to the 
historical reference condition. A before/after photo series visually illustrates the reduction of tree density 
and BA following the full restoration treatment (Figure 5). Similar reductions in BA and tree density 
following full restoration treatments were also observed at the Fort Valley (Fulé et al. 2001) and Mt. 
Trumbull (Waltz et al. 2003) LEARN sites. It is important to note that the higher BA and density values 
in the full restoration treatment (compared to 1880 values) were intentional. The thinning prescription 
was designed to leave excess replacement trees, indicating that the treatments were implemented 
effectively. 
In contrast, the burn only treatment produced only slight reductions in BA and tree density by 2009. 
Although the reductions primarily occurred in the lowest diameter classes, forest structure in burn only 
treatments was moved only slightly toward the historical reference condition. Fulé et al. (2006) found 
similar reductions in BA and tree density following burn only treatments at the Grand Canyon LEARN 
site. 
Treatment effectiveness is also captured by evaluating post-treatment diameter distributions relative to 
historical distributions. The diameter distribution in areas that were thinned and burned closely matched 
the historical distribution indicating that the full restoration treatment effectively addressed the project 
goals. Studies at Mt. Trumbull (Roccaforte et al. 2010, Waltz et al. 2003) and in northeast Oregon 
(Youngblood et al. 2006) have also documented a change from a reverse J-shaped to a unimodal

diameter distribution for ponderosa pine following thinning and burning treatments. In contrast, the 
distribution remained virtually unchanged in the control and slightly shifted towards the historical 
distribution in areas that were burned but not thinned, similar to the findings at Grand Canyon (Fulé et al. 
2006). 
Tree Mortality 
The overall goal of implementing restoration and burn only treatments is to restore open forest structure 
conditions, thus allowing the reintroduction of low-severity surface fire. As expected, the majority (80%) 
of the tree reductions in the full restoration treatment were due to thinning of small diameter trees and < 
5% of trees died from other causes (e.g., fire, natural mortality). Tree cutting did not occur in the burn 
only treatment, thus the majority of the 20% reduction in tree density was presumably due to the effects 
from fire. 
By definition, presettlement trees are irreplaceable (DellaSalla et al. 2004) and were not intended to be cut 
in this project. In addition, the goal of the treatments was to limit mortality of these “legacy” trees 
because they provide genetic and structural diversity to the ecosystem, and take centuries to replace 
(Moore et al. 1999, DellaSalla et al. 2004). In the full restoration treatment, 15% of presettlement trees 
were cut or died between 2002 and 2009, an intermediate value compared to presettlement tree mortality 
in the control (10%) and the burn only treatment (23%). Roccaforte et al. (2010) reported similar 
percentages of presettlement trees that died or were cut as a result of thinning and burning treatments on a 
landscape-scale restoration project at Mt. Trumbull. Fulé et al. (2007) reported delayed mortality that 
disproportionally affected large trees at the Mt. Trumbull LEARN site five years after full restoration 
treatment. 
Conclusions 
Results from previous studies indicate that responses to restoration treatments may include improved 
ecosystem function (Covington et al. 1997, Kaye et al. 2005), increased vigor in old trees (Feeney et al. 
1998), improved resistance to disturbance agents, such as bark beetles (Wallin et al. 2004) and fire (Fulé 
et al. 2001, Roccaforte et al. 2008), and increases in native herbaceous understory vegetation (Stoddard et 

14 
 
al. 2011).This study at the Mineral site tested the responses of restoration and burn only treatments on 
forest structure in a ponderosa pine forest in the White Mountains, Arizona.  
Of the three treatments tested in this experiment, the full restoration treatment was the only one that, after 
one year, shifted forest structure conditions and diameter distributions to levels within the range of 
variability historically present at the Mineral site. Although the restoration treatment had higher 
presettlement tree mortality than the control, presettlement trees had a higher probability of surviving 
thinning and burning treatments when compared to the burn only treatment.  
The results from this experiment will provide information about ecological responses to such treatments 
and are likely to affect management decisions on the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests. For example, it 
is commonly argued that burning without thinning may be an appropriate management alternative in some 
cases because burn only treatments usually cost less and are less likely to be litigated than restoration 
treatments that involve tree cutting. However, results from this study indicate that burn only treatments 
will not shift forest structure conditions to levels within the historical range of variability in the short 
term. Moreover, while burn only treatments may be appropriate in areas with limited access to 
mechanized thinning, repeated entries may be necessary to shift the ecosystem to historical levels. 
Finally, the study results indicate that burn only treatments have the potential to increase presettlement 
tree mortality at rates higher than other restoration treatments. Thus, managers will have to consider the 
tradeoffs between the full restoration and burn only treatments and increasingly make those decisions in 
the context of climate-induced, landscape-scale forest fires (Fried et al. 2004, Saeger and Vecchi 2010). 
Both full restoration and burn only treatments will require frequent maintenance burns and continued 
monitoring to evaluate long-term responses. To that end, the ERI will conduct the five-year post-
treatment re-measurement at the Mineral site during the summer of 2013. Following the measurements, 
we will build upon the information provided in this report and evaluate five-year post-treatment responses 
on forest structure, regeneration, surface fuels, canopy cover, herbaceous understory, and potential fire 
behavior. In addition, we plan to collect fire scar samples to provide a detailed fire history for the Mineral 
site. The ERI will continue to collaborate with Forest Service staff and encourage feedback regarding the 
Mineral project.
