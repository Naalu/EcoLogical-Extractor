ecosystems of Jocassee Gorges, southern 
Appalachian Mountains, South Carolina 
Scott R. Abella, Victor B. Shelburne, and Neil W. MacDonald 
Abstract: Ecosystem classification identifies interrelationships within and among the geomorphology, soils, and vegeta­
tion that converge to form ecosystems across forest landscapes. We developed a multifactor ecosystem classification 
system for a 13 000 ha southern Appalachian landscape acquired in 1998 by the South Carolina Department of Natural 
Resources. Using a combination of multivariate analyses, we distinguished five ecosystem types ranging from xeric oak 
(Quercus spp.) to mesic eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carriere) ecosystems. Ecosystems segregated along 
geomorphic gradients influencing potential moisture availability, with soil properties such as solum thickness distin­
guishing among ecosystems occupying similar topographic positions. Our results suggest that different combinations of 
geomorphic and soil factors interact to form similar ecosystems across the landscape, and a given environmental factor 
can impact ecosystem development at some constituent sites of an ecosystem type but not at other sites. A regional 
comparison of ecosystem classifications indicates that environmental variables important for distinguishing ecosystems 
in the southern Appalachians vary, with Jocassee Gorges characterized by unique suites of environmental complexes. 
Our study supports the contention that the strengths of ecosystem classification are providing (i) comprehensive infor­
mation on the interrelationships among ecosystem components, (ii) a foundation from which to develop ecologically 
based forest management plans, and (iii) an ecological framework in which to conduct future research on specific eco­
system components or processes. 
Resume : La classification des ecosystemes fait ressortir les interrelations dans et entre la geomorphologie, les sols et 
la vegetation qui convergent pour former des ecosystemes dans les paysages forestiers. Nous avons mis au point un 
systeme multifactoriel de classification des ecosysternes pour une region de 13000 ha dans la partie sud des Appala­
ches acquise en 1998 par Ie Departement des ressources naturelles de la Caroline du Sud. A l'aidc d'une combinaison 
d'analyses multivariees, nous avons distingue cinq types d'ecosystemes allant des ecosystemes xeriques a chene (Quer­
cus spp.) aux ecosystemes mesiques a pruche du Canada (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carriere). Les ecosysternes se sont re­
groupes Ie long de gradients geomorphologiques qui influencent la disponibilite potentielle en eau alors que les 
proprietes du sol telles que l'epaisseur du solum permettent de distinguer les ecosysternes qui occupent des positions 
topographiques similaires. Nos resultats indiquent que differentes combinaisons de facteurs geomorphologiques et pedo­
logiques interagissent pour former des ecosystemes semblables dans Ie paysage et qu'un facteur environnemental donne 
peut influencer Ie developpement de I'ecosysteme dans certains sites constitutifs d'un type d'ecosysteme mais pas dans 
d'autres sites. Une comparaison de la classification des ecosysternes it l'echelle regionale indique que les variables en­
vironnementales importantes pour distinguer les ecosystemes varient dans la partie sud des Appalaches telles que les 
Jocassee Gorges caracterisees par des ensembles uniques de complexes environnementaux. Notre etude supporte 
l'assertion que la solidite de la classification des ecosystemes procure (i) une information detaillee sur les interrelations 
entre les composantes de I'ecosysterne, (ii) les fondements sur lesquels on peut elaborer des plans damenagement fo­
restier sur une base ecologique et (iii) un cadre ecologique pour conduire des recherches futures sur des composantes 
ou des processus specifiques de I'ecosysteme.

and soils, and to describe the characteristics of the classified 
ecosystems to facilitate ecosystem identification (Whittaker 
1962; Barnes et al. 1982; Host and Pregitzer 1992). An eco­
system classification incorporates the characteristics of inter­
related 
sites, 
integrating 
information 
and facilitating 
communication about numerous sites of a landscape (Rowe 
and Sheard 1981; Pregitzer and Barnes 1984; Hix 1988). 
Ecosystems segregate on a landscape along topographic 
and soil gradients impacting the distribution of vegetation 
(Spies and Barnes 1985; Archambault et al. 1990; McNab et 
al. 1999). In the Manistee National Forest of Michigan, for 
example, Host and Pregitzer (1992) found that glacial land­
forms, by influencing soil properties and disturbance re­
gimes, constrained the distribution of ecosystems and their 
productivity. Mean annual biomass increment of overstory 
trees ranged from 1.3 t-hal-year! in xeric oak (Quercus 
spp.) forests on sandy outwash plains to 3.6 t-hal-year! in 
mesic sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) -
red oak 
(Quercus rubra L.) forests on glacial moraines (Host et al. 
1988). On the South Carolina Coastal Plain, Jones et al. 
(1984) distinguished ecosystems along a topographic gradi­
ent influencing the depth to groundwater, ranging from xeric 
uplands characterized by deep, sandy soils dominated by 
sparse overstories of turkey oak (Quercus laevis Walter) and 
longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Miller), to swamps consisting 
of bald-cypress (Taxodium distichum (L.) Rich.) and water 
tupelo (Nyssa aquatica L.). These examples from contrasting 
landscapes illustrate that the environmental factors influenc­
ing ecosystem distribution and the nature of ecosystem clas­
sification vary regionally, but the principle that an ecosystem 
results from a repeating combination of landforms, soils, and 
vegetation is consistent among landscapes (e.g., Mueller­
Dombois 1964; Goebel et al. 2001). 
The southern Appalachian landscape, not glaciated during 
the Pleistocene and containing the highest mountain ranges 
in the eastern United States, consists of a myriad of land­
forms of various sizes and shapes differing in moisture avail­
ability and impacting ecosystem distribution (Braun 1950; 
Callaway et al. 1987; McNab et al. 1999). While abrupt tran­
sitions do occur between ecosystems, much of the southern 
Appalachian landscape contains continua of subtle segrega­
tions of species varying with changes in topography (Day 
and Monk 1974). Ecosystem classification in the southern 
Appalachians must respond to high topographic diversity 
and complex topographic gradients in continuously varying 
forests (Whittaker 1967; Golden 1981). 
This study was undertaken to develop a landscape ecosys­
tem classification for Jocassee Gorges, a 13 000 ha contigu­
ous Appalachian landscape acquired in 1998 by the South 
Carolina Department of Natural Resources. The South 
Carolina Department of Natural Resources is currently de­
veloping a forest management plan for Jocassee Gorges, but 
there is little existing published data for the area on which to 
base the plan. The objectives of this study were to (i) relate 
the distribution of late-successional vegetation to soils and 
landforms in an ecosystem classification system, (ii) eluci­
date reasons for the distribution of ecosystems across the 
landscape, and (iii) provide an ecological framework in 
which to develop a forest management plan and in which to 
conduct future research. This study focuses on landscape 
ecosystems occurring at scales of <1 to >10 ha and are anal-

ogous to the USDA Forest Service's landtype phases, the 
lowest classification level in the national hierarchical frame­
work of ecological units of the United States (Cleland et al. 
1997; Hix and Pearcy 1997; McMahon et al. 2001). 
Materials and methods 
Study area 
Jocassee Gorges occurs in northern Oconee and Pickens 
counties in northwestern South Carolina along the South 
Carolina - North Carolina border (Fig. 1). Lying in the ex­
treme southern section of the Blue Ridge Mountain physio­
graphic province of the southern Appalachians, Jocassee 
Gorges occupies the southern chains of mountains that rise 
abruptly from the lower-elevation Piedmont region of South 
Carolina (Bowman 1911; Griffith et al. 2002). The topogra­
phy of Jocassee Gorges consists of ridges, stream-dissected 
hillslopes composed of sideslopes and convex nose slopes 
between stream ravines, deep stream gorges, bottoms or 
steep slopes adjacent to large streams, and flat-floored coves 
embedded on upper slopes or near the origins of first-order 
streams. Slope gradients on hillslopes range from 20% to 
70% and vary along the hillslope plan. Typical elevations in 
the study area range from 350 to 850 m, and elevations of 
the larger streams are 180-250 m lower than upper portions 
of surrounding hillslopes. Elevations of Jocassee Gorges are 
higher than those of the Piedmont region to the south but 
lower than the elevations of many mountain chains to the 
north in western North Carolina (Whittaker 1956; Carter et 
al. 2000). Within the study area, elevation does not impact 
ecosystem composition (Mowbray and Oosting 1968; Racine 
1971) as it does in the higher-elevation mountains of the 
southern Appalachians (Callaway et al. 1987; McNab et al. 
1999; Carter et al. 2000). 
Major soil taxonomic categories in the study area include 
coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Dystrochrepts; fine­
loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludults; clayey, oxidic, mesic 
Typic Hapludults; fine-loamy, micaceous, thermic Typic 
Hapludults; and fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Humic Hapludults 
(Byrd 1963, 1972). Soils in the study area are typically shal­
low (solum thickness <70 ern), with A horizons <20 em 
thick. Parent material of the soils includes granite, gneiss, or 
schist; as a result, soil is usually acidic (pH <6) throughout 
the profile. 
Jocassee Gorges is in the extreme southern portion of the 
oak-chestnut forest region of Braun (1950). Presettlement 
vegetation was dominated by oaks and American chestnut 
(Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh.) on hillslopes, which 
comprise the majority of the land area of the study area 
(Ayres and Ashe 1905; Holmes 1911; Braun 1950). Moun­
tain laurel (Kalmia latifolia L.) and rhododendron (Rhodo­
dendron spp.) were characteristic shrubs of these oak­
chestnut forests (Bartram 1791; Redfield 1879). Riparian 
vegetation consisted of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis 
(L.) Carriere) and a variety of hardwoods, often with 
understories of doghobble (Leucothoe axillaris var. editorum 
(Fern~ld. and Schubert) Ahles) and rhododendron (Oosting 
and Billings 1939). Other common species in presettlement 
forests of the region included tulip-tree (Liriodendron 
tulipifera L.), hickories (Carya spp.), red maple (Acer 
rubrum L.), black-gum (Nyssa sylvatica Marsh.), Carolina

Stand selection and plot location 
We digitized locations of the >350 stands in the study area 
from stand maps provided by Crescent Resources, Inc., a 
land and timber company that managed Jocassee Gorges un­
til the area was acquired in 1998 by the South Carolina De­
partment of Natural Resources. Using these stand records 
combined with field reconnaissance, we identified areas to 
be sampled in 48 stands distributed across the landscape that 
had no known history of major disturbance in at least the 
past 70 years. Previous research has demonstrated that geo­
morphology is a primary factor controlling the distribution 
of vegetation in the Appalachian Mountains (Braun 1950; 
Whittaker 1956; Hack and Goodlett 1960), and based on this 
previous research, we randomly selected in each of the 48 
stands one of eight topographic positions to be sampled. 
Topographic positions included stream bottoms, ridgetops, 
and lower, middle, and upper slope positions on both north­
facing (270-90°) and south-facing (90-270°) slopes. If topo­
graphic maps and field reconnaissance indicated that the ran­
domly selected topographic position did not occur in the 
stand or did not meet our disturbance criteria, we randomly 
selected another topographic position to be sampled in that 
stand. We randomly located one O.I-ha, 20 m x 50 m plot 
(dimensions were corrected for slope gradient to be 0.1 ha 
on a horizontal plane; Husch et a1. 1982) oriented parallel to 
contours within the assigned topographic position of each of 
the 48 stands for a total of 48 plots. Plots represented inde­
pendent sampling units across the landscape (Hurlbert 
1984). Because we did not locate plots within a priori de­
fined ecosystems, a common procedure in ecosystem classi­
fication research, our sampling design and independence of 
plots facilitated our sampling of the full forest continuum. 
Plot sampling 
In each plot, we sampled geomorphology, soils, and vege­
tation; sampling occurred from 1 May to 26 September 
2001. At plot centers, we determined aspect, slope gradient, 
landform index (McNab 1993), and terrain shape index 
(McNab 1989). Landform index quantifies site protection by 
landforms surrounding a plot, with high values of the index 
(e.g., 40) occurring in coves and stream ravines where pro­
tection is high and low values (e.g., 10) occurring on ex­
posed sites such as ridgetops (McNab 1993). Terrain shape 
index, a measure of land surface curvature at the plot scale, 
was determined from the plot center to land surfaces sur­
rounding a plot at a distance of 20 m from the plot center 
(McNab 1989). Average measurement error «Ioriginal mea­
sure - repeated measurel/original measure) x 100), based on 
one repeated measure for each of 10 randomly selected 
plots, was 4.3 ± 1.7% (mean ± 95% confidence interval) for 
landform index, 58.4 ± 62.7% for terrain shape index, and 
2.1 ± 1.0% for slope gradient. Although measurement errors 
have not previously been published for terrain shape index, 
our results suggest the index is difficult to measure

reproducibly; therefore, we did not use the index in statisti­
cal analyses. Plot surface shape (convex, concave, or linear) 
was described downslope and across the slope (Wilson 
1968; Ruhe 1975). 
We determined species and measured diameter to the 
nearest 0.1 em for all live trees >I em in diameter in the 
0.1-ha plots. Species were classified as trees for these mea­
surements following Radford et al. (1968); nontree species 
were inventoried as ground-flora. We divided plots into ten 
10 m x 10 m (0.01 ha) subplots to inventory ground-flora 
(vascular plants including tree seedlings and saplings <1 em 
in diameter at 1.37 m) rooted in subplots by species. Each 
subplot was traversed until no new species were found, and 
the areal percent cover of each species was visually catego­
rized for each subplot using 10 cover classes in Peet et al. 
(1998). Plant nomenclature follows Radford et al. (1968). 
We sampled soils on each plot using a bucket auger in the 
centers of two randomly selected subplots (Soil Survey Divi­
sion Staff 1993). We measured the thickness of the Oe + Oa 
horizon to the nearest 0.5 em in four cardinal directions 2 m 
from each soil sampling location. All horizon thickness mea­
surements were averaged on a plot basis. We composited 
soil in the field throughout each horizon for the A and B ho­
rizons, and we composited samples from both subplots into 
one plot sample each for the A and B horizons for laboratory 
analysis (48 plots x 2 horizons per plot = 96 total composite 
samples). 
Soil laboratory analysis 
We determined moist soil color for each soil sample under 
outdoor lighting using Munsell color charts. Based on one 
repeated color determination for each of 10 randomly se­
lected samples, seven samples exhibited repeated determina­
tions identical to original determinations and three samples 
differed by one unit of value or chroma. After sieving the 
samples through a 2-mm sieve, we analyzed the samples for 
texture (hydrometer method), organic C (Walkley-Black pro­
cedure of H2S0cK2Cr207 oxidation followed by titration 
with FeS04), and pH (1:1 soil-water) following methods in 
Klute (1986) and Page et al. (1982). Average measurement 
error, based on one repeated measure for each of the A and 
B horizon samples for six randomly selected plots, was 1.6 ± 
0.6% (mean ± 95% confidence interval) for sand, 3.4 ± 1.5% 
for silt, 2.2 ± 1.2% for clay, 4.6 ± 2.2% for organic C, and 
0.3 ± 0.1% for pH. 
Data summary 
Slope aspect was transformed following Beers et al. 
(1966). Categorical variables (landform shape (convex, lin­
ear, or concave), plot surface shape (combinations of across­
slope and down-slope shapes), landform type (ridgetop, 
hillslope, cove, stream ravine, or stream bottom), broad 
landform aspect (90-270° or 270-90°), and slope position 
(upper, middle, or lower)) were ranked according to poten­
tial moisture availability. We integrated geomorphic charac­
teristics for each plot using the topographic relative moisture 
index (ranges from 0 on xeric sites to 100 on mesic sites) ex­
pressed as a percentage by scaling measurements of aspect, 
slope position, slope shape, and slope gradient following 
Parker (1982). We calculated importance values for trees 
(average of relative density and relative basal area) and 
Can. J. For. Res. Vol. 33, 2003 
ground-flora (average of relative cover class and relative fre­
quency (based on 10 subplots per plot)) for each species on 
each plot. 
Statistical analyses 
We developed the ecosystem classification by ordinating 
and classifying the 28 environmental variables measured in 
this study using principal components analysis (PCA) 
(cross-products matrix derived from correlation coefficients) 
and cluster analysis (Ward's group linkage method, variables 
rank transformed) and the vegetation and environment com­
bined using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) (plot 
scores derived from species). We used species importance 
values for the vegetation analyses, and species occurring in 
less than three plots were removed from the data set before 
analysis (Gauch 1982). All analyses were conducted using 
the software PC-ORD (McCune and Mefford 1999). Classi­
fication and ordination techniques both identified similar 
plot groupings, strengthening the robustness of the classifi­
cation. This ecosystem classification represents an inclusive 
multifactor approach integrating and providing equal weight 
to the three ecosystem components of geomorphology, soils, 
and vegetation in a corroborative suite of multivariate analy­
ses. 
We compared overall vegetation and environmental com­
position among the classified ecosystems using pairwise 
multiresponse permutation procedure (MRPP) tests in PC­
ORD (McCune and Mefford 1999). MRPPs are multivariate, 
nonparametric tests that evaluate the null hypothesis of no 
difference in composition between groups using a random­
ization procedure. A significant result indicates that cluster­
ing within groups is greater than expected by chance 
(McCune and Mefford 1999). This analysis, therefore, 
provides a means for assessing the distinctness of each eco­
system in vegetation and environmental composition. Envi­
ronmental variables were rank transformed before this 
analysis to provide equal weighting to each variable. Using 
the six most important environmental variables identified by 
CCA, we tested the null hypothesis of no relationship of 
these variables with the vegetation matrix using the Monte 
Carlo test associated with CCA (McCune and Mefford 
1999). We also conducted univariate tests of mean soil and 
topographic variables among the ecosystems using one-way 
analyses of variance and Tukey's multiple comparison test 
(SAS Institute Inc. 1999). Data not meeting the assumptions 
of homogeneity of variance or normality were logarithmic or 
arcsine transformed before analysis (SAS Institute Inc. 
1999). 
Results and discussion 
Classification 
Five ecosystem types were distinguished and named ac­
cording to their inferred moisture status, dominant overs tory 
species, and characteristic ground-flora composition: xeric 
oak-blueberry, xeric chestnut oak - mountain laurel, sub­
mesic oak - mixed flora, mesic hardwoods-bloodroot, and 
mesic hemlock-rhododendron (Table I). These ecosystems 
represented repeating combinations across the landscape of 
landforms, soils, and their associated plant assemblages.

complexes did not differ among the three mesic ecosystems, 
reflecting the similarity and variety of topographic positions 
on which these ecosystems occur and the need to include 
soil variables to distinguish these ecosystems. The mesic 
hardwoods-bloodroot ecosystem exhibited a distinct combi­
nation of soil properties (thick sola, thin Oe + Oa horizons, 
higher soil pH), separating this ecosystem from other mesic 
ecosystems. The submesic oak -
mixed flora and mesic 
hemlock-rhododendron ecosystems were the only ecosys­
tems that did not differ from each other in overall environ­
mental composition. Geomorphic and soil complexes were 
extremely variable in the mesic hemlock-rhododendron eco­
system, making it difficult to detect differences (Table 2). In 
contrast with vegetation where all vascular plant species 
were measured, the 28 environmental variables measured in 
this study are only a fraction of the total that could be mea­
sured (Billings 1952). It is possible that soil nutrients or hy­
drological variables not measured in this study could have 
distinguished the submesic oak - mixed flora and mesic 
hemlock-rhododendron ecosystems. Additional research ex­
amining soil nutrient or hydrological variables not measured 
in this study could be undertaken to refine differences in en­
vironmental complexes among the ecosystems. 
Ecosystem classification has been criticized for not being 
responsive to temporal transitions in vegetation due to the 
occurrence or absence of disturbance (Ecological Society of 
America Vegetation Classification Panel 2002). For example, 
three of the ecosystems in this study are dominated by oaks, 
but given the current lack of disturbance in the southern Ap­
palachians, it seems unlikely that oak dominance will persist 
(Lorimer 1993; Brose et a1. 2001). However, 9 of 10 MRPP 
pairwise comparisons of understory composition (1-10 em 
in diameter) between ecosystems were significant (Table 2). 
Understory composition provides a measure of possible fu­
ture forest composition (Oliver and Larson 1996), and al­
though understories of the oak ecosystems were dominated 
by species other than oaks (e.g., black-gum, red maple, 
tulip-tree), the ecosystem types still supported distinct un­
derstory assemblages and remained in their ecosystem 
groupings (Table 2). These data suggest that vegetation 
changes in the ecosystems are constrained by underlying en­
vironmental influences, and the ecosystem classification will 
remain viable, although with different vegetative composi­
tion, during the future period of reduced fire frequencies 
expected to characterize many areas of the southern Appala­
chians (Brose et a1. 2001). 
Ecosystem components 
Vegetation 
Oaks (Quercus coccinea Muenchh., Quercus velutina 
Lam., Quercus alba L., and Quercus prinus L.) dominated 
much of the landscape (Table 3), consistent with the inclu­
sion of the study area in the oak-chestnut forest region 
(Braun 1950). The null hypothesis of the CCA Monte Carlo 
test of no relationship between vegetation and environmental 
matrices was rejected (axis 1 eigenvalue = 0.34, P < 0.001; 
axis 2 eigenvalue = 0.10, P < 0.001). Variables exhibiting 
the highest correlations (interset correlations because WA 
scores were used; ter Braak 1986) with axis 1 were landform 
index (-0.83) and the topographic relative moisture index 
(-0.76), and for axis 2 Oe + Oa horizon thickness (0.61) and 
solum thickness (-0.52). 
Geomorphology and soils 
Ecosystems differentiated along geomorphic gradients in­
fluencing potential moisture availability, consistent with eco­
system classifications in other regions (e.g., Jones et a1. 
1984; Host and Pregitzer 1992; Hix and Pearcy 1997). 
Landform index and the topographic relative moisture index 
were higher in mesic ecosystems than in xeric ecosystems 
(Table 4), indicating that topography at both broad and fine 
scales impacted ecosystem distribution. For example, eco­
systems occurring along streams flowing down hillslopes be­
came more mesic as the streams descended to lower slope 
positions, where topographic protection (indicated by high 
landform indices) and moisture accumulation are greater 
(Hack and Goodlett 1960; Helvey et a1. 1972). These results 
suggest that ecosystem classification in the southern Appala­
chians is most accurate when both the local topographic 
form and the position of the topographic feature on the land­
scape are examined simultaneously.

tF statistic and probability associated with a one-way analysis of variance. 
ILandform index is a measure of site exposure with increasing values indicating increasing protection from solar radiation by the surrounding topogra­
phy (McNab 1993). 
IValues are means (coefficient of variation (0/0».

lRanges from 0 (225°) to 2 (45°). 
Soil properties contributed to the specificity of the ecosys­
tems and were important for distinguishing several ecosys­
tems (Table 5). Mean sand and clay concentrations in the B 
horizon differed between the xeric ecosystems, with higher 
clay and lower sand occurring in the oak-blueberry ecosys­
tem than in the chestnut oak - mountain laurel ecosystem. 
Higher B horizon clay in the oak-blueberry ecosystem re­
flects this ecosystem's frequent occurrence on south-facing 
upper slopes where weathering is intense (Graham et a1. 
1990; Graham and Buol 1990). These results are consistent 
with studies in areas adjacent to Jocassee Gorges (Mowbray 
and Oosting 1968; Losche et a1. 1970) but for reasons that 
remain unclear differ from those of Daniels et a1. (1987a, 
1987b), who found higher clay concentrations on north­
facing than on south-facing slopes in the Joyce Kilmer Me­
morial Forest in western North Carolina. Higher B horizon 
sand concentrations in the chestnut oak - mountain laurel 
ecosystem than in the oak-blueberry ecosystem result from 
lower weathering on north aspects where the chestnut oak 
ecosystem often occurs and from the tendency of this eco­
system to occur on slopes characterized by boulders and 
rock outcrops that generate coarse fragments when weath­
ered (Daniels et a1. 1987a). Dominance of chestnut oak on 
rocky slopes is consistent with the published silvics of this 
species (Bums and Honkala 1990). Soil properties partially 
distinguish the two xeric ecosystems from each other on 
sites where geomorphology is similar between the ecosys­
tems. 
The mesic hardwoods-bloodroot ecosystem occupied top­
ographic positions typically supporting the mesic hemlock­
rhododendron or the submesic oak - mixed flora ecosys­
tems, but this ecosystem was differentiated by higher soil pH 
combined with A horizons and sola twice as thick as in the 
other ecosystems (Table 5). These soils had large soil vol­
umes favorable for root penetration (Stone and Kalisz 1991; 
Richter and Markewitz 1995), high total organic matter con­
tent, and a large water-holding capacity when combined 
with elevated levels of A horizon silt (Yeakley et a1. 1998). 
Higher pH values in the hardwoods-bloodroot ecosystem, 
combined with the absence of heavy shade from hemlock 
and ericaceous shrubs (Daubenmire 1929; Oosting and Bill­
ings 1939), contributed to the rich layer of such forest herbs 
as ginseng (Panax quinquefolium L.) and blue cohosh 
(Caulophyllum thalictroides (L.) Michaux) common in the 
hardwoods-bloodroot ecosystem but rare elsewhere (Graves 
and Monk 1985). 
Mean Oe + Oa horizon thickness was low in the mesic 
ecosystems compared with the xeric ecosystems, consistent 
with an ecosystem classification study in an area adjacent to 
Jocassee Gorges (Hutto et a1. 1999). The hardwoods­
bloodroot ecosystem exhibited the thinnest Oe + Oa hori­
zons, reflecting a high decomposition rate and the absence in 
this ecosystem of hemlock and ericaceous litter resistant to 
decomposition. In contrast, the chestnut oak - mountain lau­
rel ecosystem exhibited thick Oe + Oa horizons because of 
slow decomposition on the xeric sites that the ecosystem fre­
quently occupied, in combination with litter derived from 
chestnut oak and mountain laurel resistant to decomposition 
(Mudrick et a1. 1994). These examples illustrate that the cur­
rent soils of the ecosystems partly reflect long-term interac­
tions with vegetation. 
Several soil properties, when used in combination, are 
useful for identifying the ecosystems in the field (Table 5). 
For example, thickness of the Oe + Oa horizon can be deter­
mined rapidly and, when combined with soil color, can be 
used to distinguish the hardwoods-bloodroot ecosystem 
from other ecosystems. Our results additionally show that 
despite a general uniformity of texture and solum thickness 
across the landscape (Table 5), as was also documented in 
previous studies in the southern Appalachians (Neary et a1.

ited loadings greater than 0.3 on the first PC of the com­
bined environmental matrix, reflecting the complex interac­
tions among variables and the complex structure of the 
environmental matrix (Table 6). However, the five highest 
loadings on the first PC were geomorphic variables, while 
the second PC was characterized by higher loadings of soil 
variables. These data portray the influence of geomorphol­
ogy on soil properties and are consistent with the results of 
the CCA ordination (Fig. 2; high geomorphic correlations on 
the first axis, high soil correlations on the second axis) for 
the presence of a primary geomorphic and secondary soil 
gradient on this landscape. 
Results of PCA combined with the range of properties oc­
cupied by the ecosystems (Tables 4 and 5) suggest that dif­
ferent combinations of environmental factors interact to 
produce similar ecosystems. For example, the hemlock­
rhododendron ecosystem occupied a wide range of slope 
gradients from 2% on stream bottoms to more than 90% in 
V-shaped ravines nested on hillslopes (Table 4). By exhibit­
ing high topographic protection and high landform indices, 
slopes of high gradient support mesic ecosystems even on 
south aspects (Table 4). On other geomorphic combinations 
of lower slope gradient, however, the subtle drying effects of 
a south aspect may result in the development of a submesic 
oak - mixed flora ecosystem on concave sites rather than a 
mesic hemlock-rhododendron ecosystem. Mean slope gradi­
ent and aspect did not differ among ecosystems in univariate 
analyses (Table 4), but the multivariate results demonstrate 
that at some constituent sites of an ecosystem, these vari­
ables strongly impact ecosystem development and the struc­
ture of the environmental complex (Table 6). Although 
differences in B horizon texture were important for distin­
guishing the two xeric ecosystems, the wide range of soil 
textures occupied by the mesic hemlock-rhododendron eco­
system suggests that the distribution of this ecosystem is rel­
atively independent of soil texture (Table 5). These examples 
illustrate that combinations of environmental factors result­
ing in ecosystem development are difficult to detect using 
strictly univariate approaches, environmental combinations 
differ among constituent sites of an ecosystem type, and a 
given environmental factor (e.g., slope gradient) may impact 
ecosystem development at some constituent sites of an eco­
system type but not at other sites. Efforts to develop reliable 
predictive models for ecosystem distribution must account 
for the interacting suites of environmental complexes pro­
ducing ecosystems across forest landscapes and the differen­
tial influences of the same environmental factor at different 
constituent sites of an ecosystem type. 
Ecosystem applications 
Ecosystems classified in this study can be mapped in fu­
ture research (Kuchler 1967; Barnes et al. 1982; Palik et al. 
2000). Map scale is a critical consideration; for example, the 
rare mesic hardwoods-bloodroot ecosystem occurs at fine 
scales of <1 ha and may need to be mapped at a finer scale 
than the other ecosystems. Reliable ecosystem mapping ei­
ther in the field or remotely requires reliable ecosystem 
identification based on field characteristics and predictive 
models (Kuchler 1967). Much of the study area consists of 
the xeric oak ecosystems (Table 1), and an automatically

while McNab et al. (1999) reported that soil variables were 
most important for distinguishing ecosystems. In forests of 
western North Carolina at elevations higher than Jocassee 
Gorges, Carter et al. (2000) found that elevation primarily 
distinguished ecosystems. Hix and Pearcy (1997) determined 
that aspect largely constrained ecosystem distribution in 
southern Ohio, while in this study, aspect was a secondary 
factor differentiating ecosystems. In general, there is a wide 
range of different factors impacting ecosystem composition 
and distribution in different parts of the southern Appala­
chian region (Table 7). The published data suggest that cau­
tion should be used when extrapolating the importance of 
environmental variables far from a study area and that addi­
tional ecosystem classification studies are needed in this re­
gion to adequately describe broad patterns of ecosystem 
variability. 
Mapping of level IV ecoregions is currently occurring in 
the southern Appalachians as part of the national hierarchi­
cal framework of ecological units of the United States 
(Cleland et al. 1997; Griffith et a1. 2002). However, inade­
quate local data exist for many areas to reliably determine 
divisions for ecological units at lower hierarchical levels 
such as land type phases. Studies such as this one provide 
the local data necessary to link fine- and broad-scale map­
ping of hierarchical ecological units. For example, north­
western South Carolina is mapped as a single level IV 
ecoregion (Southern Blue Ridge Ecoregion; Griffith et al. 
2002), with Jocassee Gorges located in the center. Jocassee 
Gorges is distinguished from surrounding areas within this 
ecoregion by exhibiting uniquely deep stream gorges (Mow­
bray and Oosting 1968) and topography more dissected by 
small, high-gradient streams (Cooper and Hardin 1970). 
These differences warrant the mapping of Jocassee Gorges 
as a separate ecological unit on finer-scale ecoregion maps.
