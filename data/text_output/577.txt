ABSTRACT  
Tassel-eared squirrel foraging patterns and projected effects of ecological  
restoration treatments at Mt. Trumbull, Arizona  
Michael T. Elson  
Tassel-eared squirrels tSciurus aberti) are an important component of 
southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) ecosystems. Tassel-eared squirrel 
habitat has been altered by the interruption ofthe natural fire regime, which maintained 
low tree densities and diverse stand structures prior to Euro-American settlement. 
Although ecological restoration efforts seeking to restore presettlement conditions 
through mechanical thinning and prescribed fire are currently underway in many areas 
ofthe Southwest, the effects of restoration treatments on tassel-eared squirrels are 
unknown. We selected three experimental blocks at Mt. Trumbull, Arizona, to 
represent a continuum of stand types prior to ecological restoration. The locations of 
all tassel-eared squirrel feed trees were mapped in a total of 27 hectares. Data 
collected on each feed tree included tree status (leave or take) , dbh, number of clipped 
I· I 
needle clusters, number of peeled cone cores, number of fungi digs, relative abundance 
ofold clipped clusters, tree damage, and the presettlement status ofthe tree. We 
determined the characteristics and spatial pattern of feed trees under current conditions 
at Mt. Trumbull and predicted changes due to restoration treatments using the marked 
status of trees. The current prescription resulted in low percentages of the trees 
11 

currently used for foraging on inner bark being marked for retention in the three 
treatment units surveyed. Trees selected by squirrels for foraging on ovulate cones 
were retained at higher percentages . More random spatial distribution and larger 
average sizes of retained feed trees are predicted. We predict corresponding 
reductions in squirrel populations, larger home range sizes, and increased seasonal 
movements. We developed two possible modifications of the current prescription to 
mitigate impacts on squirrel foraging habitat. The individual tree approach is predicted 
to significantly reduce impacts on forage availability while having little impact on 
structural objectives of current prescriptions. It is uncertain, however, whether the 
available forage will be fully utilized. The patch approach is predicted to have greater 
benefits for squirrels and is considered a more reliable approach to mitigating impacts. 
Implementing the patch approach, however, would require fundamental changes in 
current objectives and marking guidelines-a cost which may outweigh the anticipated 
benefits.

CHAPTER 1 
lNTRODUCTION 
The tassel-eared squirrel and its habitat 
Tassel-eared squirrels (Sciurus ahem) are an important component in 
southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) ecosystems. These squirrels disperse 
the spores ofhypogeous fungi (Maser et al. 1978), increase nutrient cyclingthrough 
their feeding habits (Skinner and Klemmedson 1978; Allred and Gaud 1994a), may 
exert a selective pressure on ponderosa pine genetics (Soderquest 1987; Hall 1981; 
Linhart 1989; Linhart et al. 1989; Snyder 1993), and are an important prey species for 
northern goshawks (Accipiter genti/is atricapi//us) and other predators in these 
ecosystems (Farentinos 1972; Hall 1981; Reynolds et al. 1992). 
The ponderosa pine ecosystems which this species inhabits north of the United 
States-Mexico border have changed dramatically within approximately the last 130 
years, resulting in atypical habitat conditions when viewed from an evolutionary 
perspective. Prior to Euro-Arnerican settlement, southwestern ponderosa pine 
ecosystems were characterized by a frequent, low-intensity fire regime which kept the 
tree densities very low (Cooper 1960). Trees occurred in a clumped arrangement, 
typically surrounded by open bunchgrass communities. When Euro-Americans began 
to settle in southwestern ponderosa pine ecosystems in the early 1870's the natural fire 
regime was disrupted, resulting in widespread alterations of ecosystem structure and 
function. Fire exclusion was initiated primarily due to livestock grazing which reduced 
9  

fine fuels, and was later perpetuated through active fire suppression efforts. Today the 
forests are much denser, often withcontinuous canopy cover and smaller average tree 
diameters (Covington and Moore 1994a). It is not known how these postsettlement 
habitat changes may have altered the habitat relationships of the tassel-eared squirrel in 
ponderosa pine ecosystems. Covington and Moore (1994b) postulated that 
postsettlement changes in forest structure probably favor closed-forest species, such as 
tassel-eared squirrels and porcupine, to the detriment ofopen-habitat species, such as 
pronghorn and grasshoppers. Hall (1981), in contrast, thought that fire exclusion may 
lower habitat quality for tassel-eared squirrels. Hall (1981) suggested that the 
evolutionary habitat of squirrels (open forests) would probably be more favorable 
habitat than today's altered forests. A clear explanation ofwhy such forests would be 
more favorable is somewhat lacking. Hall (1981) does note, however, the invasion of 
more shade-tolerant species into the understory of pine forests where fire exclusion 
has occurred. A shift in species composition could indeed have negative implications 
for squirrel habitat. 
While Ratcliff et al. (1975), Patton (1977), and Ffolliott and Patton (1978) all 
reported increasing squirrel density with increasing ponderosa pine basal area, Patton 
(1977, 1984) noted that the basal area should be comprised of'uneven-aged groups of 
trees, including large, over-mature cone producers to provide high quality squirrel 
habitat. States et al. (1988) also stressed the importance of clumped trees of different 
sizes which provide different forage and cover resources for squirrels. In many areas 
10 
•

stands are becoming increasingly homogenous, with competition from younger trees 
increasing mortalityrates among the larger trees (Covington et al. 1997), possibly due 
to a competitive advantage in obtaining soil moisture (Oliver and Larson 1996). It is 
therefore unclearwhat the future may hold for tassel-eared squirrel habitat in the 
absence offorest restoration, despite increasing tree densities and basal area. 
Ecological restoration 
Currentlythere is a great deal of interest in restoring southwestern ponderosa 
pine ecosystems to conditions that resemble those thought to have occurred prior to 
Euro-American settlement (Covington et al. 1997). Restoration treatments, which 
typically include a combination of mechanical thinning and prescribed fire, provide an 
opportunity to compare how tassel-eared squirrels use two distinctly different stand 
structural conditions (i.e., habitats). Pre-treatment structures represent current (post­
~ettlement) habitat conditions, while post-treatment (restored) structures are designed 
to develop habitatconditions which likely existed for thousands ofyears prior to Euro­
American settlement. 
Feed trees 
Forage availability has been shown to be a potentially limiting factor in sciurid 
populations (e.g.; Sullivan et al. 1983). Tassel-eared squirrels are selective herbivores, 
confining most oftheir foraging to particular "feed trees," and selective herbivores 
may be more sensitive to reductions in forage availability than less specialized species. 
(e.g., Johns 1997). Feed trees have been shown to be chemically distinct from non­
11 

feed trees by some researchers (Farentinos et aL 1981 ~ Zhang and States 1991 ~ Snyder 
1992), and are important as a primary source offorage during winter and other 
periods when more desirable foods are unavailable (Goldman 1928 ~ Keith 1965; 
Stephenson 1975 ~ HaI11981~ Allred et aI. 1994). This importance is accentuated by 
the lack offood cachingby these squirrels (Golightly and Ohmart 1978). It is possible 
that the availability of sufficient numbers of appropriate feed trees may play an 
important role in tassel-eared squirrel fitness and survival. 
There are numerous studies which describe the characteristics oftrees selected 
~I  by squirrels for foraging on inner bark (Goldman 1928; Bailey 1931; Pearson 1950; 
Keith 1965~ Reynolds 1965~ Hall 1967; Patton and Green 1970; Farentinos 1972; 
Stephenson 1974, 1975; Pederson et aI. 1976; Ffolliott and Patton 1978; Capretta and 
Farentinos 1979; Thomas 1979; Capretta et al. 1980; Farentinos et aI. 1981; Hall 
1981; Pederson and Welch 1985; Soderquist 1987; States et al. 1988; Linhart et aI. 
1989; Austin 1990; Zhang and States 1991; Snyder 1992, 1993; Allred and Gaud 
1994a, 1994b). These studies yielded consensus on some characteristics, such as 
average size offeed trees, while showing large variation in other characteristics, such 
as the frequency offeed tree occurrence in forest stands and fidelity to feed trees on an 
annuaI basis. 
Linhart et aI. (1989) reponed that feed trees are approximately 10 % oftrees in 
stands aIong the Front Range in Colorado, while Soderquist (1987) reported up to 
68% of ponderosa pine at Mt. Trumbull, AZ, were feed trees, and States et aI. (1988) 
12 

reported up to 67% of trees in stands near Flagstaff, AZ were used as feed trees. Part 
of this variation may be explained by annual variation in the squirrels' dependence on 
inner bark as a food source (Keith 1965; Hall 1981; States et al. 1988; Allred et al. 
1994), and on varying definitions for classification as a feed tree. The high estimates 
offeed tree occurrence given by Soderquist (1987) and States et al. (1988) were based 
on a very liberal definition for a feed tree--any evidence of use, even a single clip. 
Ffolliort and Patton (1978) reported that only 2% ofthe feed trees examined 
were used in each offour years examined, although heavily used trees were typically 
revisited after a 2 or 3 year rest period. States et al. (1988) reported that 23% offeed 
trees were used in each ofthree years studied. While noting some annual variation, 
Larson and Schubert (1970) stated that in their 10 year study "repeated clipping ofthe 
same tree year after year was the rule." Soderquist (1987) also reported data which 
suggest consistent use of moderate to heavily used feed trees (>22 clipped needle 
clusters) for many consecutive years. Hall (1981) found that feed trees were 3 times 
more likely to be used in a subsequent year than non-feed trees, and reported a 90% 
fidelity rate among feed trees for a 3 year period analyzed. Interestingly, Snyder 
(1993), reported that none ofthe 90 trees designated as non-feed trees in his study 
were ever used by squirrels in the four years examined. It appears that while tassel­
eared squirrels rotate use of feed trees, they do so within a somewhat limited set of 
acceptable trees, as suggested by Ffolliott and Patton (1978) and States et al. (1988). 
Hall (1981) suggested two scales of rotating use, at both the individual tree level and 
13  

the stand level. Among feed trees, moderately and heavily used trees appear to be 
used more predictably over the years than lightlyused trees (Ffolliott and Patton 
~ 
1978). 
Chemical characteristics of trees selected for foraging on inner bark have been 
investigated by several researchers (Pederson et al. 1976; Capretta and Farentinos 
1979; Thomas 1979; Farentinos et al. 1981; Hall 1981 ; Pederson and Welch 1985; 
Zhang and States 1991; Snyder 1992) . A chemical basis for selection ~as suspected 
prior to actual research to identify such a link (Keith 1965; Hall 1967). Results of 
chemical analyses have varied by researcher. Perhaps the most thorough and 
convincing study (Snyder 1992) found that selected trees had lower oleoresin flow
' .. " 
rates, lower concentrations of some monoterpenes, lower"fron and mercury 
concentrations, higher sodium concentrations, and higher nonstructural carbohydrate 
concentrations. Hoffmeister (1986) stated that innerbark becomes less nutritious as 
trees age, and Keith (1965) also suggested this may be the case; however, no evidence 
for these claims was provided. States et al. (1988) found that some of the most 
heavily used feed trees were the older yellow pines on their study sites. 
Tassel-eared squirrels also appear to select particular trees for feeding on 
immature ovulate cones , however, investigations of cone-feeding tree characteristics 
have been more limited (Larson and Schubert 1970; Pederson et al. 1976; Hall 1981). 
Immature ponderosa pine cones are an important and nutritious late-summer food 
source that may have major influences on squirrel fitness and population levels (Hall 
14 

1981). I will distinguish between feed trees utilized for foraging on inner bark and 
ovulate cones by referring to them as twig and cone trees, respectively. 
Impact of Restoration 
Few studies have investigated the impact of timber harvesting on squirrel · 
populations directly (Patton et al. 1985; Pederson et al. 1987), and none have 
addressed the impact ofrestoring presettlement stand structures. As noted earlier, 
Ratcliff et al. (1975) and Ffolliott and Patton (1978) found that higher squirrel 
densities are associated with greater basal area (of ponderosa pine, and restoration 
I 
treatments dramatically reduce basal area (Covington et al. 1997). Patton et al. (1985) 
and Pederson et al. (1987) found decreased squirrel activity following timber 
harvesting. It is not clear whether the availability ofappropriate feed trees may limit 
squirrel populations, or if other factors such as cover, nesting habitat, or the 
availability ofother food sources, are more important. For example, Patton (1975) 
and Hall (1981) emphasized the importance ofconnecting canopies around nest trees, 
while States (1985) noted the association offungi heavily utilized by squirrels 
(Stephenson 1975) with high canopy cover blackjack ponderosa pine stands. 
While the impact of tree removal is unknown, it is reasonable to assume that 
the loss offeed trees may have a significant impact. Even feed trees not removed may 
become less suitable ifisolated or exposed by openings in the canopy. States et al. 
(1988) suggested that isolated yellow pine received less use than those surrounded by 
other trees-sand such isolation is more likely to occur following restoration treatments. 
15  

The nutritional value ofinner bark is low (Patton 1974), and extended dependence on 
this food source is believed to result in reduced fitness and increased mortality (Keith 
1965~ Stephenson and Brown 1980). Thus, inner bark is at most a subsistence food 
resource, and when utilized exclusively may be little more than a starvation resource. 
Since feed trees may be nutritionally superior to non-feed trees (Snyder 1992), the 
availability ofsufficient numbers of appropriate trees could influence squirrel fitness 
-
and survival, particularly during years with persistent snow cover (Stephenson and 
Brown 1980). The role ofpersistent snow cover in squirrel mortality could be 
accentuated by reduced interception of snow following restoration treatments. It is 
therefore possible that a deliberate effort to retain feed trees, particularly twig trees, 
may be necessary to mitigate impacts on tassel-eared squirrels in restored areas. 
Previous studies have indicated that most twig trees are medium-sized trees 
averaging approximately 30 to 50 em diameter at breast height or dbh (Patton and 
Green 1970~ Ffolliott and Patton 1978~ Pederson et al. 1976~ Snyder 1992~ Allred and 
Gaud 1994b). Trees in this size class are frequent in today's forests, and are removed 
in large numbers by restoration treatments which reduce the unnaturally high 
frequency oftrees which became established in the last century (Pearson 1950; 
Covington and Moore 1994a). Previous researchers have found that squirrels select 
against very small trees (less than about 10-20 ern dbh), however, it has not been 
clearly demonstrated in previous research if all trees above this minimum threshold size 
are equally suitable, or if there is a disproportionate selection for trees in the 30-50 em 
16 
I 

diameter class (patton and Green 1970; Ffolliott and Patton 1978; Pederson et ai. 
1976; Snyder 1992, Allred and Gaud 1994b). Ffolliott and Patton (1978) found that 
the characteristics offeed trees were the same regardless ofvarious prior silvicultural 
treatments. Hall (1981), however, observed that higher percentages of ponderosa pine 
were used as feed trees in areas where they were less abundant at higher elevations in 
the mixed conifer zone, possibly indicatingless selectivity when ponderosa pine are 
scarce. 
It is unclear precisely how feed trees are distributed on the landscape, either 
before or after timber harvesting, although States et al. (1988) and Linhart (1989) 
reported that feed trees tend to be clumped at small scales (a few trees to a few 
acres), possibly due to genetic relatedness or local squirrel population levels. Hall 
(1981) described "hot spots" which occurred in different locations at different times 
during his 14 year study in Grand Canyon National Park. Ecological restoration 
treatments seeking to restore the clumped nature of presettlement forests will result in 
cutting some small clumps of trees while retaining at least portions of other clumps. 
How the spatial distribution offeed trees and trees selected for retention during 
restoration treatments correspond has not been investigated. Determining how 
squirrel foraging patterns change with re,spect to tree characteristics and spatial 
distribution following restoration treatments will provide insights into how these 
treatments will affect squirrel populations, as well as providing clues about how 
current habitat use may differ from that which occurred prior to human induced

Abstract 
Sciurus aberti (tassel-eared squirrels) are an important component of 
southwestern Pinus ponderosa (ponderosa pine) ecosystems which may be adversely 
affected by ecological restoration treatments. We characterized two types offeed trees 
used by this species on experimental blocks ofthe Mt . Trumbull Ecological Restoration 
Project in northwestern Arizona. Most trees used by squirrels for foraging on inner bark 
of twigs (twig trees) were in the 30 to 50 em diameter class as reported in other studies. 
<, 
Unlike other researchers, however, we discovered that this selection tended to be 
proportional to the availability oftrees 31 cm dbh or greater. Selection for trees in 
smaller size classes was less than expected based on availability. Trees selected for 
foraging on immature ovulate cones (cone trees) were larger, with 78% having greater 
than 40 ern dbh. Because restoration treatments will remove a large proportion of small 
feed trees, but a smaller proportion of large feed trees, the average diameter for feed 
trees may increase following restoration. Currently used twig trees will be reduced by 
treatments by up to 71%, and cone trees by up to 50%. We predicted decreases in 
squirrel numbers and increases in home range sizes and seasonal movements following 
treatments.

Introduction: 
Ecological restoration treatments are increasingly considered in many 
southwestern Pinus ponderosa (ponderosa pine) forests (Covington et al. 1997). 
Restoration treatments seek to restore ecosystem structure and function which existed 
prior to disturbance of the natural fire regime by Euro-American settlers, hereafter 
"presettlement" (Covington et al. 1997). These treatments may have negative impacts 
<, 
on wildlife species such as Sciurus aberti (the tassel-eared squirrel). Tassel-eared 
squirrels are considered vulnerable due to their selection for high ponderosa pine basal 
area (Ratcliffet al. 1975; Patton 1977; Ffolliott and Patton 1978) and interlocking 
canopies (Patton 1975, 1977, 1984; Hall 1981; Snyder and Linhart 1994). Restoration 
treatments dramatically reduce ponderosa pine basal area (e.g., Covington et al. 1997) 
and create numerous breaks in the canopy cover, simulating conditions which existed in 
presettlement forests (Covington and Moore 1994a). 
Tassel-eared squirrels are a species of particular interest due to their unique 
dependence on ponderosa pine (Keith 1965), and their ecological roles in dispersing 
fungal spores (Maser et al. 1978), in nutrient cycling (Skinner and Klemmedson 1978; 
Allred and Gaud 1994a), as a selective pressure on ponderosa pine genetics (Hall 1981; 
Soderquist 1987; Linhart 1989; Linhart et al. 1989; Snyder 1993), and as an important 
link in the food web (Farentinos 1972; Hall 1981; Reynolds et al. 1992). 
One important and highly visible element of tassel-eared squirrel habitat is the 
use of particular "feed trees" for most of their winter foraging on the inner bark ofpine 
21 
? 
•  

twigs, and most of their summer foraging on irrunature ovulate pine cones (Keith 1965 ~ 
Stephenson 1975~ Hall 1981). The impacts of restoration treatments on these habitat 
elements may provide important indications of the overall impacts of treatments on 
squirrel populations. Comparing the characteristics offeed tree use patterns under 
current conditions with those projected following treatment may also provide insights 
into changes in squirrel habitat use from pre-settlement times to the present. 
Tassel-eared Squirrel Feed Trees 
'\ 
Numerous studies have investigated the characteristics oftrees selected by 
tassel-eared squirrels for foraging on inner bark of pine twigs (e.g., Keith 1965 ~ Patton 
and Green 1970; Stephenson 1975 ~ Ffolliott and Patton 1978; Hall 1981; States et al. 
1988; Snyder 1992), while few have given much attention to trees selected for foraging 
on immature ovulate cones (Larson and Schubert 1970~ Pederson et al. 1976; Hall 
1981). Much ofthe focus on feed trees used for foraging on inner bark has been on the 
chemical characteristics ofthose trees (Pederson et al. 1976; Capretta and Farentinos 
1979 ~ Thomas 1979 ~ Farentinos et al. 1981 ~ Hall 1981 ~ Pederson and Welch 1985~ 
Zhang and States 1991; Snyder 1992). Although there is much agreement on the size of 
typical feed trees (Patton and Green 1970 ~ Pederson et al. 1976; Ffolliott and Patton 
1978 ~ Snyder 1992 ~ Allred and Gaud 1994b), there is a lack ofagreement on the pattern 
of squirrel use from one year to the next--although all authors acknowledge some 
variation in feed tree use on an annual basis. Ffolliott and Patton (1978) and States et 
al. (1988) indicated relatively low levels offidelity to particular feed trees, although their 
I:> 
22 

calculations include all trees used, even if only one clip had been counted. Larson and 
Schubert (1970), Hall (1981), and Snyder (1992) reported much higher levels of squirrel 
fidelity to feed trees, particularly heavily used feed trees. 
Study Site: 
The Mt. Trumbull Resource Conservation Area is located in the Uinkaret and 
Sawmill Mountains of northwestern Arizona, approximately 85 kilometers southwest of 
Fredonia, AZ. Elevation for ponderosa pine ranges from approximately 1,980 m to 
2,447 m, and the area contains a total ofapproximately 4,000 ha ofponderosa pine 
forest. This island of ponderosa pine is isolated by lower-elevation vegetation on all 
sides. The forest has been characterized as an ecotonal pine for~st (Soderquist 1987), 
with ponderosa pine occurring at atypically low elevations. The dry climate ofMt. 
Trumbull is influenced by proximity to the Great Basin, and there is a noticeable mixing 
oflower elevation species (e.g., Artemesia tridentatay with plants more typical ofthe 
ponderosa pine zone. Sciurus aberti kaibabensis (Kaibab squirrel), a subspecies of 
tassel-eared squirrel, was introduced to Mt. Trumbull in 1972 from the Kaibab Plateau 
approximately 48 kilometers to the east (Hall 1981). Prior to that time there were no 
tree squirrels at Mt. Trumbull, possibly due to a prehistoric extinction related to 
isolation effects. All tassel-eared squirrels in the Southwest are behaviorally and 
physiologically very similar (Hoffmeister and Diersing 1978; Hoffmeister 1986; Hall 
1981), and would be expected to exhibit similar responses to habitat alterations.

approximately 40 ha to 100 ha were selected for this study. Althoughthe blocks were 
untreated, the treatment half of each block had been marked for individual tree retention 
during the treatment. The marking guidelines were based on a prescription which 
retained all trees of presettlement status, and from 1.5 to 3 replacement trees (depending 
on size) in locations where evidence ofpresettlement trees (stumps, logs) was observed. 
Blocks were separated by approximately 2 km, and represent a continuum of elevations, 
stand densities, and soil conditions. The selected blocks had previously been designated 
as experimental blocks 1,3, and 5, and will be referred to as such using notation such as 
EB-1 T for experimental block 1, treatment unit. Table 2.1 provides detailed infotmation 
concerning the characteristics of each block. 
Methods: 
Data Collection 
Within each treatment and control unit ofeach block (except EB-1 C) a central 
5.4 ha portion was mapped between May and August of 1998 for the exact location of 
all tassel-eared squirrel feed trees . Feed trees were distinguished as twig and cone trees 
depending on the type offoraging use they received. Twig trees were defined as those 
with 10 or more clipped needle clusters from the previous year (trees typically had 10 or 
more clips ifthey had any), and cone trees as those with 20 or more peeled ovulate cone 
cores from the previous year (if trees had more than 5 sone cores they typically had 
20+). Reported levels of use found in the literature (Keith 1965; Ffolliott and Patton 
1978; Allred and Gaud 1994b) were also considered in making these determinations. 
24  

I 
Distinct color changes which occur with time (Brown 1984) were used to determine if 
feeding evidence was greater or less than one year old. Position offeeding evidence 
under the canopy, slope angle, prevailing wind direction, and evidence of clipping in the 
canopy were all considered when assigning feeding evidence to a particular tree. In 
most cases we feel the evidence was unambiguous; however, difficult judgement calls 
were noted for particular trees in dense clumps. The total number ofclips in the areas 
was systematically counted or in some cases estimated, although exact locations oftrees 
providing fewer than 10 clips were not mapped and detailed data for those trees were 
not collected. Data collected for each mapped tree included: number ofclipped needle 
clusters, number of peeled twigs, number ofpeeled cone cores, number offungi digs, 
dbh, dominance, aspect, damage (due to squirrel use or other causes), tree status (leave 
or take), relative abundance offeeding evidence>1 year old, and distance and azimuth 
to one ofthe permanent rebar stakes placed at 60 m intervals on the grid. Mapping was 
conducted using graph paper and a 20 m x 20 m grid system marked on the sites using 
wire flags or forestry flagging. Results from spatial analyses based on these maps are 
reported elsewhere (chapter 3). 
Statistical Analysis 
The chi-square goodness-of-fit test was used to test for selection oftwig trees by 
size class among trees 31 em dbh or greater. The diameter distribution of available trees 
was obtained from data collected by the Northern Arizona University Ecology Lab 
(pers. comrn. Amy Waltz). Observed values were the actual number oftwig trees in 
25  

each size class, and expected values were obtained by multiplying the proportion of live 
pine ~ 31 em dbh in each size class by the total number oftwig trees ~ 31 em dbh. Ten-
centimeter size classes were used unless expected values were less than one, in which 
case size classes were combined (after Cochran 1954). 
Predicting Treatment Effects 
For the purpose of making predictions from this study we assumed that the feed 
trees used at moderately high levels in 1997-1998 represented a large percentage of the 
suitable feed trees on.the study sites into the near future. While this assumption is open 
to debate, we provide evidence to support the assumption, and also provide a means to 
test its validity. We used feed trees marked for retention as a means of predicting 
available feed trees following treatments. 
Results: 
I 
Twig tree characteristics 
When all five mapped units were combined, twig trees on our study sites had a 
median dbh of36.0 em, with a range from 16.1 to 114.3 em. Seventy percent ofall twig 
trees had a dbh between 25 and 50 ern. We found that use by size class was roughly 
proportional to availability when looking at trees Iargef'than 31.0 ern (Figure 2.1), but 
~ 
selection oftrees in smaller size classes was less than expected based on availability. 
Fifty percent of the total number ofclips counted in the units came from just 21% of the 
twig trees. Twig trees as a group represented from 4.9 to 14.2% ofthe ponderosa pine 
greater than 20 ern dbh, which is approximately the minimum threshold size for use by 
26 

squirrels. Eighty-four percent of twig trees showed evidence of at least two consecutive 
years of previous use as a twig tree. Clips from non twig trees «10 clips) accounted for 
12.9% ofthe total number of clips on the sites. Table 2.2 provides the characteristics of 
twig trees by unit. The number of clipped needle clusters was not correlated with the 
diameter of twig trees (Figure 2.4). 
Twig trees that remain after restoration treatments are applied will have a 
somewhat larger median size. We do not anticipate that the number of clips per tree will 
increase. Table 2.2 describes projected characteristics of retained twig trees, using leave 
trees in treatment units as a forecasting method. 
/ 
Cone Tree Characteristics 
Cone trees had a median dbh of 52.8 em, and 86% of cone trees had diameters 
greater than 40 em. Cone trees as a group represented from 0.13 to 3.7% ofthe 
ponderosa pine in the stand greater than 20 em. Since cone and twig trees had 
inherently different and somewhat arbitrary definitions, it is difficult to say based on 
these data that cone trees are necessarily less common than twig trees, however, based 
(~ 
on our definitions that is the case. A chi-square analysis of cone tree selection by size 
class was not attempted due to the small sample sizes ofcone trees. Table 2.3 provides 
characteristics of cone trees by unit. There was very little correlation between the 
number ofcone cores and the diameter ofcone trees (Figure 2.5). 
It appears that cone tree characteristics will also be somewhat affected by 
restoration treatments, however, these effects are less striking than those for twig trees 
27 
...J 

(Table 2.3). 
, 
Twig Tree Retention 
We projected the impact of restoration treatments on the number of twig trees in 
each unit (Figure 2.2). We made these projections by removing from the data set all 
twig trees in the treatment units which were not marked for retention. Other suitable 
trees in the units will probably begin to receive use following treatment. However, it is 
also likely that alterations in stand structure will reduce the attractiveness of some of the 
retained twig trees due to increased exposure to predators. Ifcurrently unused but 
suitable trees in the stands are reduced at similar levels as the current twig trees, it seems 
highly probable that twig tree availability will be substantially reduced-by restoration 
treatments. 
Cone Tree Retention 
It appears that impacts on the availability of cone trees (Figure 2.3) will be less 
severe than the impacts on twig trees. This difference is probably related to the larger 
average size of cone trees, making them more like'(v to be retained under the current 
restoration prescription. It should be noted, however, that sample sizes for cone trees 
are small (Table 2.3). 
Discussion: 
Restricted food availability has been shown to be a limiting factor in some sciurid 
populations (Sullivan et al. 1983). Food availability is most restricted for tassel-eared 
squirrels during the winter, and winter mortality is a major factor in tassel-eared squirrel 
28  

population fluctuations (Keith 1965; Stephenson and Brown 1980; Hall 1981). Almost 
exclusive dependence on inner bark for food during periods when snow cover is >10 em 
has been shown to be a period of particularly high squirrel mortality, and may limit the 
range oftassel-eared squirrels (Stephenson and Brown 1980). Since Patton (1974) 
showed that pine twigs have low food value, and Snyder (1992) provided evidence 
suggesting that the selected feed trees have higher nutritional value, the availability of . 
appropriate feed trees may be a crucial factor in squirrel survival during winters with 
prolonged snow cover. Ovulate cones are a favored food source during the summer and 
autumn, and may be one of the most important elements in the diet ofsquirrels 
contributing to weight gain and maintenance ofgood health (Keith 1965; Hall 1981). 
Reductions in the availability oftrees selected for foraging on cones and inner bark, 
therefore, have important implications for squirrel populations. Our projections indicate 
that twig trees may be substantially reduced by restoration treatments, while cone trees 
will be less affected. These projections suggest that summer foraging habitat may be 
-r 
less affected than winter foraging habitat. Increased seasonal movements ofsquirrels 
may result ifrestored areas continue to receive use during summer and fall, but are less 
suitable during winter months. Larger home range sizes may also result ifsquirrels 
compensate for reduced forage availability by increasing their range ofactivity, as 
reponed by Farentinos (1972) and Patton et al. (1985). 
Changes in the characteristics offeed trees following restoration may provide 
clues to the changes which have occurred in squirrel foraging patterns since Euro­

Abstract 
Tassel-eared squirrels depend on Pinus ponderosa (ponderosa pine) for 
survival, and depend particularly on individual trees known as feed trees for much of 
their foraging activity. We mapped exact locations of tassel-eared squirrel feed trees on 
five, 5.4 ha units of the Mt. Trumbull Ecosystem Restoration Project in northwestern 
Arizona. Spatial patterns ofthis important habitat element were analyzed using 
Ripley's K(t), K12(t), and Moran's I Coefficient. Trees used for foraging on inner bark 
were clumped at scales ranging from 5 to 120 meters. It is projected that restoration 
treatments will result in a more random distribution of selected trees. Trees receiving 
similar levels of squirrel use were not clumped with each other, and trees utilized for 
inner bark foraging and cone harvesting were not associated with one another. Two 
modified prescriptions to mitigate impacts on tassel-eared squirrels are proposed. An 
individual tree approach would have little impact on restoration objectives, however, 
the effectiveness ofthis approach for mitigating impacts on squirrels is uncertain. The 
patch approach appears more promising as an effective method to mitigate impacts on 
squirrel habitat, but requires significant alterations of current restoration objectives and 
marking guidelines.

Introduction: 
Sciurus aberti (tassel-eared squirrels) live exclusively in Pinus ponderosa 
(ponderosa pine) forests of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico 
(McKee 1941). The dependence of tassel-eared squirrels on ponderosa pine, and the 
important ecological roles squirrels play in these forests, have been described 
previously (e.g., Goldman 1928; Keith 1965; Hall 1981; Brown 1984; Allred and Gaud 
1994a). Ponderosa pine forests ofthe Southwest have undergone significant changes in 
approximately the last 130 years following interruption ofthe frequent, low intensity 
fire regime by Euro-American settlement (Cooper 1960). Livestock grazing and active 
fire suppression efforts have led to a dramatic increase in tree densities and associated 
loss ofthe formerly open, park-like forest structure (Covington and Moore 1994a). 
Currently there are ecological restoration efforts underway in several areas of the 
Southwest which seek to restore presettlement reference conditions through mechanical 
thinning and prescribed fire (Covington et al. 1997). 
Because tassel-eared squirrels are associated with areas ofhigh ponderosa pine 
basal area (Ratcliff et al. 1975; Patton 1977; Ffolliott and Patton 1978), restoration 
treatments may reduce the quality of tassel-eared squirrel habitat. Restoration 
treatments will directly remove some ofthe feed trees where the squirrels do much of 
their foraging. 
Feed trees are an important habitat element for tassel-eared squirrels during the 
critical winter months when other favored food resources are unavailable (Keith 1965; 
41  
..  

Stephenson and Brown 1980; Hall 1981). Tassel-eared squirrels do not cache food 
(Golightly and Ohman 1978) and do not hibernate, making it necessary to forage for 
food daily. Despite their extensive use ofinner bark from pine twigs, this food source 
is of relatively limited nutritional value (Patton 1974) compared to preferred, high-value 
food items such as pine seeds . Previous research indicates that the particular feed trees 
selected by the squirrels may have a nutritional and energetic advantage to the squirrels 
due to their chemical characteristics (Snyder 1992) and possibly the ease with which the 
bark can be peeled (Pederson and Welch 1985). The availability of suitable trees which 
make foraging more efficient could, therefore, be an important factor influencing 
squirrel survivorship. The distribution offeed trees has been casually described as 
clumped (Hall 1981; States et al. 1988; Linhart 1989), but has never been formally 
analyzed. Particular trees are also selected as sites for much ofthe immature ovulate 
cone harvesting which occurs in summer and autumn, but these trees have received 
limited research attention (Larson and Schubert 1970; Hall 1981). Trees utilized for 
inner bark and cone harvesting will be referred to as twig and cone trees respectively. 
In order to protect an important habitat element it is necessary to understand 
how that element is spatially distributed, and in particular to understand that 
distribution at a scale which is applicable to the scale ofmanagement activities. 
Ecological restoration treatments in southwestern ponderosa pine forests are currently 
being marked at the individual tree level, making the scale ofinterest one fine enough 
to detect individual tree locations . Iffeed trees are distributed in a non-random way, 
42  

that distribution may be important for squirrel foraging behavior, and should be 
considered when attempting to mitigate impacts on foraging habitat.  
Study Site:  
Our research was conducted on the Mt. Trumbull Resource Conservation Area 
administered by the Bureau ofLand Management. The area is located in northwestern 
Arizona approximately 85 km southwest ofFredonia, AZ. Operational-scale 
restoration treatments began in the area in 1996, and three planned but untreated 
experimental blocks were selected for this study. A detailed description ofthe study  
sites has been provided previously (chapter 2).  
Methods:  
Data collection  
We mapped exact locations ofall tassel-eared squirrel feed trees in a central 5.4 
ha portion ofboth the control and treatment halfof each ofthe three blocks, with the 
. exception ofthe control half ofexperimental block 1 (EB-lC). This resulted in a total 
of 5 units and 27 mapped hectares. Entire blocks were not mapped due to time 
constraints. We designated feed trees as twig trees ifthey had 10 or more clipped 
needle clusters from the previous year, and cone trees if they had 20 or more peeled 
cone cores from the previous year. Trees that did not meet one or both ofthese 
definitions were not mapped (see chapter 2 for further explanation). Distinct color 
changes which occur with time (Brown 1984) allowed feeding evidence to be aged as 
greater or less than one year old. We established grid cells 20 meters on a side across 
43 

the entire mapped area using compass, tape measure, and wire flags or forestry 
flagging. We mapped locations of trees within grid cells using graph paper. Data was 
collected for each mapped tree, and has been reported previously (chapter 2). Tree 
locations were later digitized using ArcInfo software for use with a computerized map 
of the study area. 
Statistical Analysis 
Ripley's K functions and Moran's I coefficient were used to describe spatial 
patterns of feed trees in the study units at Mt. Trumbull. The K(t) function is a 
univariate analysis used to characterize the distribution of a set of points as random, 
clumped, or uniform (Ripley 1977), and was used to determine if feed trees occur in 
clumps. The K12(t) function is a bivariate analysis used to describe two sets of points 
as being independent, positively, or negatively associated (Lotwick and Silverman 
1983). This function was used to test if twig arid cone trees occur together. Moran's I 
coefficient is used to describe the distribution of a variable associated with a set of 
points (Upton and Fingleton 1985), and was used to see if feed trees receiving a high 
level of use (measured by number of clips) are clumped . We used software developed 
.by Duncan (1990) to perform the analyses. Using these statistical tools distributions 
can be described at scales up to one-halfthe width ofthe plot. For each distance class, 
the observed K(t) is compared to a 95% confidence envelope obtained by computing 
K(t) for 19 sets of randomly-selected points (Monte Carlo simulations), with the 
number of points in each set equal to the number offeed trees in the analysis. A 
44  


~ 
minimum population size of20 or more trees was set as a requirement for analysis, 
after Fule and Covington (1998). 
Alternative restoration prescriptions designed to mitigate impacts on tassel­
eared squirrel foraging habitat were developed using current patterns of squirrel use as 
an indicator ofindividual tree potential as a feed tree. Although individual feed tree use 
may vary from year to year, several studies indicate that previous use is a good 
predictor offuture use as a feed tree (Larson and Schubert 1970; Hall 1981; Soderquist 
1987; Snyder 1992). We found evidence of at least two consecutive years of previous 
use for 84% ofthe feed trees mapped on our study sites. For the purposes ofthis 
exercise, we made the assumption that future use would be the same as use recorded 
for the year 1997-1998. We then projected the effects of restoration treatments by 
removing from the data set all mapped trees which were not marked for retention (for 
additional details, see chapter 2). Various modifications ofthe current prescription 
were examined by adding back take trees as appropriate based on the criteria ofthe 
proposed modified prescriptions. We were not able to predict how treatments might 
impact the level of use received by retained trees in the future, and thus assumed use on 
an individual tree level would remain constant. 
Results: 
Spatial Analysis 
Twig trees tended to be clumped at spatial scales ranging from 5 to 120 meters, 
the maximum distance at which clumping could be detected in our units (Table 3.1). 
•
45  

Within each unit twig trees were clumped in all 5 meter distance classes from 5 to 40 
meters, with clumping inconsistent across units at distances greater than 40 meters. 
Following simulated treatments, some clumping ofretained twig trees was still evident, 
however, this pattern was less consistent than it had been previously (Table 3.1) 
The clumping pattern of cone trees varied by unit, possibly due to small sample 
SIZes. Sample sizes were so small for two units that analysis was not attempted (Table 
3.1). The clumping pattern observed in EB-3C, the unit with the largest sample size for 
cone trees, suggests that cone trees may indeed exhibit significant clumping patterns. 
Because a larger proportion of cone trees than twig trees are retained in restoration 
treatments (see chapter 2), mitigation efforts for cone trees may not be as important as 
those directed at twig trees. Due to the varied results of spatial analyses (likely due to 
small sample sizes), and less ofa sense ofurgency, we did not attempt to incorporate 
cone trees into the modified prescriptions. 
While collecting data in the field it appeared that twig trees receiving similar 
levels of use were clumped; however, using Moran's I coefficient the clumping was not 
consistently shown to be statistically significant in any units or in any particular distance 
classes. These results imply that particular clumps of feed trees are no more likely to 
contain especially heavilyused twig trees than other clumps oftwig trees. 
.­
Twig trees and cone trees also appeared to be positively associated with one 
another based on casual observations in the field. Using the K12(t) function this was 
not shown to be consistently statistically significant, however (Table 3.2). It should be 
46  
- 
~  

noted again that small sample sizes of cone trees prevented analysis in two units, and 
may have influenced analysis in the other units. Ifthese results are supported by further 
investigation, they may indicate that separate approaches will be necessary to mitigate 
impacts on cone and twig trees, ifnecessary. 
Modified Restoration Prescriptions 
Two approaches for mitigating impacts oftreatments on tassel-eared squirrels 
were considered. Figure 3.1 graphically depicts the concept behind the individual tree 
approach to modifying current prescriptions. Under this approach the intent is to save 
the most heavily used twig trees in order to preserve the greatest amount of foraging 
habitat with the least amount ofimpact on stand structural objectives ofthe current 
prescription. Although the approach ofidentifying the 'best' twig trees on an 
operational scale (depicted in Figure 3.1) is not a: practical approach (because it would 
require mapping and tagging all twig trees and then a second marking effort), similar 
results could be obtained using squirrel use-levels as a criteria (Figure 3.2). Such an 
approach could easily be implemented through minor modifications of current marking 
guidelines, either through substituting qualifying feed trees for non-feed trees currently 
marked, or by adding qualifying trees to those currently marked for retention. We 
found that the additional retention ofapproximately 2-4 heavily used twig trees per 
hectare could theoretically reduce impacts on inner bark foraging by 50% or more 
(Figure 3.2). 
The second approach to mitigating impacts is based on the results ofthe spatial 
47 

analyses which show that twig trees tend to be clumped, suggesting that perhaps 
modified prescriptions should also seek to clump retained twig trees. This patch 
approach is likely to have further benefits for squirrels if entire clumps of trees-feed 
and associated non-feed trees--are retained to provide additional cover, nesting, and 
foraging habitat. Previous research has indicated that tassel-eared squirrels typically 
select dense clumps of trees with interlocking canopies for nest locations (Patton 
1975), possibly to allow a more concealed approach to the nest through the canopy 
(Hall 1981). Protection from aerial predators such as Accipiter gentilis atricapillus 
(northern goshawk), perhaps the primary predator oftassel-eared squirrels (Farentinos 
1972; Hall 1981; Reynolds et al. 1992), during foraging would likely be enhanced in 
dense patches oftrees. Retaining such clumps may have energetic benefits for squirrels 
which would not have to travel as far between trees, particularly during periods of 
powdery snowcover which make ground travel difficult or impossible for squirrels (Hall 
1981). Fungi utilized heavily by squirrels have also been associated with closed canopy 
forests (States 1985), suggesting that an additional food resource would also be 
benefitted by retaining dense clumps oftrees. 
Using unit EB-l T as an example (Figure 3.3), it would be relatively easy to 
designate clumps oftwig trees approximately 25 meters across for retentionin the 
treatment. Since spatial analyses showed that heavily used trees are not clumped, and 
therefore patches can be considered somewhat equal in value, it would not be necessary 
to make two passes using this approach. In the case ofEB-l T, three such patches of 
48 

approximately 25 m 1i .meter could be used to retain a similar number of additional 
feed trees as the inc I' .iual tree approach when using 30 clips per tree as the criteria for 
retention (Figure :. ~ 
. 3.3). The potential amount offorage retained, however, may 
vary because the .e .d trees retained are not exclusively heavily used trees as those in 
the individual tree approach. As an alternative to complete exclusion from treatment, 
designated clumps could receive reduced levels of thinning, or only minor thinning of 
understory vegetation. At essentially anylevel ofadditional twig tree retention, 
impacts on structural objectives of current prescriptions will be greater under the patch 
approach then the individual tree approach. This is results from the large number of 
additiona: t 'ees retained in even a single clump ifnon-feed trees (not shown in figure 
3.3) are .r :iuded. 
Discussf -n: 
[he consistently clumped pattern ofdistribution for tassel-eared squirrel twig 
tree-. i i 5 units at Mt. Trumbull prior to restoration suggests that squirrel foraging 
hahi' '.t should be viewed as a mosaic ofpatches, despite virtually continuous canopy 
C:" , er of pine on the sites. Whether these patches are the result of genetic relatedness 
/ 
)f dumps of trees (Linhart 1989), or due to some other factor influencing squirrel 
: ctivity is not known. Regardless ofthe cause of clumping, it is easy to hypothesize 
.enefits to squirrels if such clumps of trees are intentionally retained-including 
increased cover, nesting, and foraging habitat. Modifying current restoration 
prescriptions to preserve dense patches containing known twig trees would be relatively 
49  

easy, although the most effective size of patches is not known, and in practice would 
depend on the extent to which modifications are acceptable to decision makers. Since 
trees receiving particular use levels do not appear to be clumped, it would not matter in 
theory which clumps were designated for retention, and since tassel-eared squirrels are 
not territorial (Brown 1984) spacing should not be particularly important. The research 
upon which the current prescription is based does not indicate, however, that such 
patches existed under presettlement reference conditions (pers. comm. Peter Z. Fule, 
Research Assistant Professor, Northern Arizona University, 1999), which must be 
seriously considered in view of the stated objective for the treatments to restore those 
reference conditions. In the small areas currently designated for restoration treatments, 
such major alterations to the current marking guidelines may not be warranted for the 
protection of a currently wide-spread and abundant species. 
An alternative to retaining patches would be to retain individual, heavily-used 
twig trees regardless of their location or proximity to other trees . In terms of current 
usage, this approach could cut impacts on forage availability by half, while the number 
of additional trees retained (approximately 2-4 per hectare) would have only minor 
impacts on structural objectives ofthe current prescription (pers. comm. Peter Z. Fule, 
Research Assistant Professor, Northern Arizona University, 1999). This approach, 
however, seems less certain to mitigate impacts on squirrels. Previous research has 
indicated that squirrel habitat use declines following timber harvesting (Patton et al. 
50  

1985; Pederson et al. 1987). Retained twig trees may not receive the same levels of 
use following the reduction in surrounding tree densities, thus limiting the effectiveness 
of this approach. Alternatively, when twig trees become more scarce following 
treatment they may be used more heavily. Hall (1981) noted that where pine were 
scarce within mixed conifer forests they seemed to be used in higher percentages than 
where they were abundant. 
It is also important to consider the possible impacts on forest genetics iffeed 
trees are intentionally retained at higher levels. Shifts in gene frequencies and 
associated tree characteristics could alter vulnerability to other herbivores, insects, 
pathogens, and fire. It is not known how the suggested modifications of the current 
prescription might influence such factors. 
Decision makers will ultimately have to determine how tassel-eared squirrel 
habitat requirements fit into the larger picture of ecological restoration in southwestern 
ponderosa pine forests. We have provided two possible approaches to mitigating 
impacts on squirrels. The predicted benefits ofthese modifications ofthe current 
prescription should be viewed as" testable hypothesis based on imperfect assumptions. 
As with any management decision, tradeoffs must be made when choosing between 
available options. We suggest monitoring squirrel populations in restored areas, and 
then experimenting with modified prescriptions if reductions in squirrel numbers or 
other species of wildlife are deemed to be unacceptable.

Young yellow pine. May be additional sign  
hidden in oak clump.  
Heavier use in past.  
Plot tree #17.  
Many bud tips, probably from pollen cone  
feeding, only counted substantial terminal  
clusters as clips . Many early season cores, hard  
to age and find.  
Heavier past use likely.  
Some sign could be from smaller trees to E. and  
S.

Cone cores estimated, multiple tops and dead  
limbs.  
DBH from north trunk, both similar in diameter.  
Sign from trees 42 and 43 overlap.  
Cone core overlap with tree 48, only attributed  
some to tree 46 due to condition-broken top.  
Cone cores estimated. Old, scraggly tree. 
Sign of trees 50, 51, 52 overlap somewhat. 
Heavy past use 
Possibly some clips from smaller adjacent tree on 
SE side. 
) 
Adjacent, smaller trees may contribute a few  
clips.  
A few clips from nearby trees.  
Some clips from surrounding trees.  
Some clips from nearby trees, some overlap.  
Heavy past use. Crooked, forked top.  
Dead top tree under it might have contributed a  
few clips.  
Several clips with long twigs, no nest though.  
Very many old clips, essentially defoliated at top;  
lower limbs relatively full.  
Smaller tree joined at base may add a few clips,  
one long twig, no nest.  
Some look like nest clips (long twigs attached),  
can't see a nest though: No peelecLtwigs.  
Very many old clips  
Sign of trees 73, 74, and 75 overlap.  
Many fresh cone cores, many old clips. pollen

Very difficult to tell if all sign coming from this  
treee, intennediate between 77 and 78,  
positioned right for much of sign, but doesn't  
show any damage.  
Tree joined at base may be contributing some  
sign.  
Short and squat, possibly broken top in past?  
Tree broken halfway up, only a few lower limbs  
still left, missing bark N. side. Many old clips,  
considering condition amazing it's still alive (and  
brake looks very old).  
Very many old clips  
Difficult to tell which tree sign is from.  
Some of sign may be from feed trees uphill (73,  
74, 75) and upwind.  
Tree in surprisingly good shape considering level  
of use and past use.  
Difficult to tell which tree sign is from (87, 88 and  
possibly a tree joined to base of 87).  
Very hard to assign sign to trees, counted most in  
"dispersed clips" category.  
Big search area, may be twigs I didn't see,  
probably quite a few more cones too. Crooked  
top, scraggly.  
Uphill from tree 91, beyond likely cone fall range  
if just gravity involved. Many yellow pine below  
in fairty steep little swale-no running water.  
Some clips from surrounding trees.  
Trees 94 and 95 in dense thicket of small PIPO,  
damage to crown is primary indicator these trees  
contribute majority of sign.  
Heavy past use  
Nest in adjacent tree, didn't count clips w/very  
long twigs attached.  
May be osme overtap with other trees. Old fire  
scar East side. Dead top.  
Some overtap with tree 101.  
Crooked, scraggly top . Possibly some overtap  
with understory trees, old fire scar W. side.  
Trees 102, 103, and 104 overtap somewhat.

Heavy past use  
Some overlap with other trees, dead top.  
Leaning and branches twisted around YP snag  
next to it. A few clips like nest clips, but no next  
visible. Some clips hard to age, could be quite a  
few more than 65-1 was conservative in aging  
them.  
Sign of 108, 109, 110 overlap extensively. Many  
cores attributed to tree 110 which are near this  
tree.  
Number of cone cores estimated.  
Trees surrounding 111, 112 also contributing  
some clips.  
Tree between 113 and 114 may be contributing  
clips.  
Flat top, scraggly.  
Trees 119, 120 overlap somewhat.  
Very heavy past use, most damaged at top.  
Surrounding trees also a few clips, some look  
more damaged, but less sign.  
Also clips from nearby trees.  
Adjacent tree might contribute a few clips.  
Some clips from surrounding trees. '"  
Several limbs dead, brown needles, uncertain of  
cause. 
­
Flat top. Saw squirrel shred bark from dead  
ARTR nearby, then carry mouthful to top of this  
tree (assume for a nest, but can't see-went to  
very top where it's flat).  
Flat top. Cones of trees 134, 135 overlap  
somewhat. Many of the cores are from mostly  
mature cones, only bottom portion eaten.

Surrounding trees show damage from past use, 
may contribute a few clips.  
Probably many more twigs under clips .  
Sign of 139-142 overlap in continuous belt of  
clips .  
Difficult to be sure sign is being correctly  
assigned to this tree.  
Some clips had long twigs, others didn't-no nest  
and 7+ twigs.  
Flat, crooked top, scraggly.  
Several trees in area appear to have been used  
fairly heavy in past, some feed trees off sampled  
area. Very heavy past use of this tree.  
Heaviest damage at top.  
Many fresh cone cores from trees to N., not from  
last year though.  
Trees 152, 153 overlap.  
Heaviest damage at top.  
DBH estimated, dead tree next to trunk.  
Open grown .

Many bud tips, probably from previous pollen  
cone feeding.  
Not nest clips, but surprisingly few clipped twigs.  
No twigs, but definitely a bonified feed  
tree-damage, old clips, no nest, etc.  
Yellow pine to E may be former feed tree-old  
clips and scragly appearance. Most current clips  
appear to be nest clips.  
Plot tree #34. Heavier use in past.

Possible overtap w/neighboring trees.  
Why no twigs? Likely overtap w/other trees.  
Plot tree #1. Some clips may be from smaller

Appear to be feeding clips, don't know why so few 
twigs. Broken top.

In group of light to mod. feed trees. Plot tree #1 
Sign of trees 2 and 14 impossible to separate in 
much of area-grow right together, similar crown 
cover region. Plot tree #f37 
Very difficult to assign clips to trees in this area, 
but severe clip damage, probably used heavier in 
past. Plot tree #f38 
Sign easier to distinguish than other trees in 
group, no clips from surrounding tree to outside 
of clump. Plot tree #84 
Plot tree #87 
Sign of trees 6,7,8 overlap some 
Bird nest in top 
Plot tree #46 
Some evidence of feeding on pollen cones. No 
cores despite many cones produced. A few clips 
from small PIED to S. of tree . Most clips 
probably nest clips. 
Relatively isolated feed tree . Only found 1 old 
clip. Seemed to have a higher proportion of twigs 
to clips than most trees. 
Two trees joined at base, most sign seems to be 
from larger (western) stem; one I measured for 
DBH. 
Twig/clip counts probably less than actual 
number. Most cones old, 3 cores appear to be 
only cones from last year. 
Bark falling off on NE side 
Surrounded by very dense PIPO, evidence of 
some feeding on pollen cones 
Two neighboring trees almost qualify as feed 
trees. Evidence of pollen cone feeding. 
Nest on SW side, most clips nest clips, centered 
below nest.

APPENDIX B  
Track station data  
Explanation: 
Track stations (Drennanet aI. 1998) were used in 1997 and 1998 to determine 
the relative abundance ofsciurids in experimental blocks. This data was not reported 
in the text ofthe thesis due to inconsistent results for tassel-eared squirrels, and 
incomplete analysis for rock squirrel (Spermophilus variegatusi and cliff chipmunk 
(Eutamias dorsalis) results. Using this method only presence or absence can be 
determined for a particular track station, so the number 1 on data forms is intended 
only to indicate presence oftracks. Track station numbers correspond to rebar 
locations as numbered on maps in Appendix D, not as numbered on NAU Ecology 
Lab maps. 
Data Codes: 
SCAB =Sciurus aberti kaibabensis 
SpyA = Spermophilus variegatus 
EUDO =Eutamias dorsalis

APPENDIX C 
Tassel-eared squirrel feeding index data 
Explanation: 
A tassel-eared squirrel feeding index was used to determine relative levels of 
foraging activity by squirrels in the experimental blocks. This data is not presented in 
the text ofthe thesis due to incomplete analysis. The index was conducted by placing 
a 1 m2 frame on the ground and counting the amount offeeding evidence from the 
past year in the listed categories. Counts were made approximately 15 m apart on 
transects beginning in front ofrebar grid points and progressing In the direction ofthe 
next grid point in a straight line. A transect as defined on the data forms consists of 
four counts between grid points, so the total number of times counts were made in 1 
m2 frames may be obtained by multiplying the number oftransects by four. See Dodd 
et al. (1998) for further details.
