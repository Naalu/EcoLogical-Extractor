Abstract
We report on survival and growth of ponderosa pines (Pinus ponderosa
Douglas ex P. Lawson & C. Lawson) 2 decades after forest restoration treat-
ments in the G. A. Pearson Natural Area, northern Arizona. Despite protection
from harvest that conserved old trees, a dense forest susceptible to uncharac-
teristically severe disturbance had developed during more than a century of
exclusion of the previous frequent surface-fire regime that ceased upon
Euro-American settlement in approximately 1876. Trees were thinned in 1993
to emulate prefire-exclusion forest conditions, accumulated forest floor was
removed, and surface fire was re-introduced at 4-years intervals (full restora-
tion). There was also a partial restoration treatment consisting of thinning
alone. Compared with untreated controls, mortality of old trees (mean age
243 years, maximum 462 years) differed by <1 tree ha1 and old-tree survival
was
statistically
indistinguishable
between
treatments
(90.5%
control,
92.3% full, 82.6% partial). Post-treatment growth as measured by basal area
increment of both old (pre-1876) and young (post-1876) pines was significantly
higher in both treatments than counterpart control trees for more than
2 decades following thinning. Drought meeting the definition of megadrought
affected the region almost all the time since the onset of the experiment,
including 3 years that were severely dry. Growth of all trees declined in the
driest 3 years, but old and young treated trees had significantly less decline.
Association of tree growth with temperature (negative correlation) and precipi-
tation (positive correlation) was much weaker in treated trees, indicating that
they may experience less growth decline from warmer, drier conditions
predicted in future decades. Overall, tree responses after the first 2 decades fol-
lowing treatment suggest that forest restoration treatments have led to sub-
stantial, sustained improvement in the growth of old and young ponderosa
pines without affecting old-tree survival, thereby improving resilience to a
warming climate.

INTRODUCTION
Large-scale tree decline and mortality is a hallmark of a
warming climate worldwide (Allen et al., 2015). The
multidecadal megadrought currently impacting south-
western North America (Williams et al., 2021) is impli-
cated in increasing tree mortality (Breshears et al., 2005;
Ganey et al., 2021; van Mantgem et al., 2009). Reduced
growth and decreased capacity for post-drought recovery
constrain the resources needed for trees to produce
defensive chemicals against herbivory (Kolb et al., 2016).
Slowing growth is a strong predictor of impending
tree mortality in angiosperms (Ireland et al., 2014;
Rodríguez-Caton et al., 2019) and conifers (Camarero
et al., 2015; Ogle et al., 2000). Old trees, typically the lon-
gest lived and largest organisms in the forest ecosystem,
are particularly at risk (Lindenmayer, 2017). Old trees
generally have substantial biomass, carbon storage, and
wildlife habitat value, contain valuable scientific infor-
mation such as long-term genetic variability and tree-ring
records, and have aesthetic value and cultural impor-
tance for people (Kolb et al., 2007). Past practices of
heavy exploitation of timber resources removed the
majority
of
old
trees
over
vast
areas
(Covington
et al., 1994). Contemporary forests are dense and domi-
nated by abundant young trees, so old trees can suffer
disproportionately from competition (Biondi, 1996) and
are highly vulnerable to severe wildfire due to dense lad-
der fuels and high canopy bulk density (Fulé et al., 2012).
Drought and severe wildfires threaten forest sustainabil-
ity, especially at the warmer, drier edges of species’ distri-
butions (Camarero et al., 2013; Parks et al., 2019).
Ponderosa
pine
(Pinus
ponderosa
Douglas
ex
P. Lawson & C. Lawson), with two recognized varieties
(scopulorum and ponderosa), has the most widespread
distribution of any North American conifer, ranging from
the USA–Mexico border into southwestern Canada in
pure and mixed-conifer stands. Prior to abrupt cessation
of the frequent, predominantly surface-fire regime associ-
ated with Euro-American settlement in the second half of
the 19th century (Fulé et al., 1997), ponderosa forests
were relatively open and dominated by patchy groups of
large, old trees that reached several 100 years in age
(White, 1985); the oldest on record exceeded 900 years
(OLDLIST,
http://www.rmtrr.org/oldlist.htm,
visited
22 April 2020). Contemporary forests typically have dense
contiguous stands that support severe, stand-replacing
wildfires (Coop et al., 2020; Singleton et al., 2019)
exacerbated
by
increasingly
arid
climate
(Mueller
et al., 2020). Ponderosa pines are well adapted to drought
and fire intensities short of crown fire behavior (Stevens
et al., 2020), but the small number of remaining old trees
growing in dense conditions suffer disproportionately
from competition with younger trees (Biondi, 1996) and
from pathogens (Aflitto et al., 2015; Negron et al., 2009).
Ecological
restoration
and
related
treatments
are
designed to reduce forest vulnerability to disturbance from
fire and pathogens (Allen et al., 2002; Stephens et al., 2012)
and have been widely tested over the range of ponderosa
pine and associated species (e.g., Pseudotsuga menziesii,
Pinus jeffreyi). Treatments typically include retention of old
trees, thinning of young trees, and reintroduction of surface
fire through prescribed burning (Fulé et al., 2012).
Restoration of key characteristics of the prefire-exclusion
ecosystem has been a specific goal in southwestern USA
ponderosa forests (Covington & Moore, 1994), where treat-
ments have included removal of accumulated forest floor
fuels prior to burning (Covington et al., 1997), attention to
spatial
pattern
of
retained
trees
(Sanchez
Meador
et al., 2009), and understory community reestablishment
(Laughlin et al., 2017).
Old ponderosa pine trees have shown positive short-
term responses to restoration treatments, such as rapid
significant increases of resin flow (related to bark beetle
defense), foliar nitrogen content, and foliar toughness
(foliovore defense) in the first 2 years post-treatment
(Covington et al., 1997; Feeney et al., 1998). Skov et al.
(2005) found no significant increase in old-tree radial
growth in the first 3 years following treatment, perhaps
due to a lag in the ability of trees to allocate new
resources to radial growth (Latham & Tappeiner, 2002).
However, decadal-scale studies at an intensively mea-
sured study site (Kolb et al., 2007) as well as at the land-
scape scale (Erickson & Waring, 2013) showed significant
and sustained post-treatment growth increases in trees
averaging over 200 years in age. Similar results were
reported in central Oregon by McDowell et al. (2003) and
for old ponderosa and Jeffrey pines in Northern California
by Hood, Cluck, and Pinnell (2018). Crown dieback was
also reduced in old trees post-treatment compared with
controls (Kolb et al., 2007). Drought reduced old-tree
growth in Arizona, but trees in treated forests declined
less and recovered more quickly than trees in controls
(Kolb et al., 2007).
Warming climate and concurrent drying were less
well appreciated at the onset of forest treatments aimed

explicitly at ecological restoration in the 1980s and 1990s,
when ecological restoration principles were focused on
historic
reference
conditions
to
guide
interventions
(Society for Ecological Restoration, 2002). Profound
drought conditions and associated tree death in the
southwestern
USA
since
the
mid-1990s
(Breshears
et al., 2018), coupled with a better understanding of his-
toric drought (Steiger et al., 2019) and the implications of
future climate projections on native forests (Williams
et al. 2021; Yazzie et al., 2019) have drawn attention to
the interaction of treatments and climate. We took
advantage of the longest-standing intensively measured
forest restoration study site in the southwestern USA, at
the G.A. Pearson Natural Area (from this point forward
“Pearson Natural Area”) in Arizona, to investigate long-
term impacts of restoration treatments on both young
and
old
ponderosa
pine
trees
during
an
ongoing
megadrought. The site has a high density of old trees
(Avery et al., 1976). Young trees were thinned in
1992–1993 and prescribed fire was applied on a 4-year
cycle in half of the thinned area beginning in 1994
(Covington et al., 1997). Prescribed fires were carried out
in autumn, a standard practice in the region, resulting in
low burn severity (Covington et al., 1997).
Using tree measurements and tree-ring data from
1992 to 2016 (25 years), we addressed research questions
centered on the survival of old trees, tree growth changes
in the treated sites affecting old and young trees,
and climate–growth interactions. Our hypotheses were
H1: Survival of old trees would be higher in treated areas
than control areas. H2: Tree growth would respond posi-
tively to thinning, with younger trees growing relatively
faster than older trees. H3: Drought would reduce tree
growth, but both old and young treated trees would expe-
rience less drought impact on growth than control trees.
H4: fine-scale (monthly) influence of climatic factors
would be attenuated for treated trees.
METHODS
Study area
The study area was located in the Fort Valley Experimental
Forest, the oldest such forest in the United States
Department
of
Agriculture
(USDA)
Forest
Service
system, within the G.A. Pearson Natural Area (GPNA),
located ~10 km northwest of Flagstaff, Arizona. The area
comprises ~4.3 ha, of which the southern two-thirds were
decommissioned from Natural Area status in 1988 to per-
mit tree cutting due to concerns about the high fuel haz-
ard threatening historic Forest Service buildings. The
decommissioned area became the site for the ecological
restoration treatments with an adjacent portion of the
Natural Area serving as the control. Here, 15 ≈0.28 ha
plots were established and assigned to three treatments:
control, thinning restoration, and composite restoration.
The control plots with no treatments remained in the
designated Natural Area, forming a contiguous portion of
the study (shaded gray in the northwestern portion of the
study area map; Figure 1). The area for treatments (col-
ored in Figure 1), comprising the southern to eastern por-
tion of the site, was officially decommissioned from
Natural Area designation. The 10 treatment plots were
randomly assigned to full or partial restoration treat-
ments. Two areas at the southwestern and eastern edges
of the site were excluded from the experiment (Figure 1).
The study site was ~2200 m in elevation, with flat to
gently rolling topography. Soils are derived from Tertiary
basalt flows and cinders, and are classified as a Brolliar
stony clay loam, and a complex of fine, smectitic Typic
Argiborolls and Mollic Eutroboralfs (National Coopera-
tive Soil Survey, 2006). The average annual temperature
is 7.8C and average annual precipitation is ~540 mm,
with a bimodal distribution in winter and summer (mon-
soon) (Flagstaff Airport weather station, 1950–2016).
Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) forms a mono-
specific, uneven-aged forest (White, 1985). Several large
trees were selectively harvested from GPNA in 1894 but
subsequently the area has been set aside as a control site
since the early days of the Fort Valley Experimental For-
est
and
was
considered
“virgin
forest”
(Avery
et al., 1976). The frequent surface-fire regime ended in
1876 (Dieterich, 1980), followed by massive pine regener-
ation in 1914 and especially 1919 (Savage et al., 1996)
that grew into a dense midstory.
Forest restoration experiment
The forest restoration experiment has been described in
detail by Covington et al. (1997) and other authors
(e.g., Kaye et al., 2005; Laughlin et al., 2017); it is summa-
rized here. As stated above, the 4.3 ha study site was
divided three 1.4 ha areas and then further subdivided into
15 0.28 ha plots (N = 5 per treatment). All trees above
1.37 m in height were stem-mapped and measured for
condition and diameter at breast height (dbh; 1.37 m) in
1992. Treatments were carried out in the decommissioned
area and the experimental control was the adjacent por-
tion of the Natural Area. Treatments were “full” and “par-
tial” restoration. Both treatments had the same guidelines
for trees: all old trees were retained. Old trees were those
present prior to the exclusion of fire after 1876 and were
provisionally defined in the field as those having dbh

(White, 1985). Tree ages were confirmed with tree-ring
sampling (Mast et al., 1999). Most young trees were
thinned in 1993, with a small percentage retained near
places where evidence of formerly living trees such as
snags, logs, or stumps were present. In the full restoration
treatment, accumulated forest floor material was removed
by hand. Litter and mown native grasses were scattered
back over the forest floor to emulate a natural fuelbed for
the first fire only. The full treatment was burned with a
prescribed surface fire using strip headfires under cool
autumn conditions in 1994 and every 4 years thereafter:
1998, 2002, 2006, 2010, and 2014. The 4-year fire interval
is an average of fire frequencies from the northern Ari-
zona
region
prior
to
fire
exclusion
(Baisan
&
Swetnam, 1990; Fulé et al., 1997). The use of relatively
cool fires in autumn differs from pre-1876 patterns, but
the season and intensity had to be controlled in practical
terms as the study area was adjacent to buildings, dense
forest, and a highway. The partial treatment had no fur-
ther intervention after the 1993 tree thinning.

Tree-ring data
Condition (living, declining, or several dead categories)
and dbh were remeasured in 2004 and again in 2014–2015
for all old trees. In addition, all younger trees in the full
and partial treatments were remeasured as well as a 6.7%
random subsample of younger trees in the control. In the
autumn of 2016 after the growing season had ended, short
increment cores intended to capture the past 40–50 years
of growth were collected from the measured trees; all cored
trees were living in 2016. Full-length cores had been previ-
ously collected in 1992 to determine age (Mast et al., 1999).
Cores were glued to wooden mounts and surfaced so that
cells were clearly visible under magnification. Tree rings
were cross-dated with ponderosa pine tree-ring chronology
AZ521 (Graybill, 1987) and our unpublished chronologies.
Ring widths were measured and cross-dating was checked
for
possible
errors
with
the
COFECHA
program
(Holmes, 1983). Ring widths were converted to annual
basal area increment (BAI) by calculating inside-bark
diameter (Laughlin et al., 2011) and then subtracting
annual growth from the measured tree diameters using the
baiout function in R package dplR (Bunn, 2008, 2010).
Climate data
Climate data in the form of monthly temperature and pre-
cipitation were obtained from the Flagstaff Airport weather
station (NOAA ID USW00003103) for the years 1950–2016.
The weather station is at 2135 m elevation and is located
~23 km southeast (SE) of the study site (Figure 2).
Analysis
We addressed hypothesis H1, that survival of old trees
would be higher in treated areas than control areas, by
checking the condition of the original 146 pre-1876 trees
that were alive in the three treatments in the initial 1992
measurement at the start of the experiment (Mast
et al., 1999). We calculated survival (%) of old trees on
each of the N = 15 plots and tested the effect of treatment
on survival using the one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) in R, checking that ANOVA assumptions
were met.
We tested H2, that tree growth would respond posi-
tively to thinning, with younger trees growing relatively
faster than older trees, by fitting linear mixed effects
models to samples from each age category (old and
young) using the lmer function in the lme4 package
(Bates et al., 2015) in R (The R Foundation for Statistical
Computing, v. 4.0.4). We analyzed changes in individual
tree BAI, or tree growth, measured using increment cores
collected at breast height. Growth was modeled as a func-
tion of the following fixed effects: a three-level treatment
factor,
year,
treatment-by-year
interaction,
and
a
pretreatment covariate (i.e., pretreatment dbh; to account

for potential pre-existing differences). Autocorrelation of
repeated measurements was accounted for by estimating
random intercepts for each tree, while allowing responses
for each tree to have varying slopes with respect to time.
Quantifying the random variation among trees was
undertaken to better understand the nature of responses
to restoration treatments (Laughlin et al., 2017; Munson
et al., 2015). To this end, we computed the marginal R2
(from this point forward, R2
m, the proportion of variance
explained by the fixed effects) and the conditional R2
(from this point forward, R2
c, the proportion of variance
explained by both fixed and random effects) using the r.
squaredGLMM
function
in
the
MuMIn
package
in
R (Barton, 2015; Nakagawa & Schielzeth, 2013).
We tested H3, that drought would reduce tree growth,
but both old and young treated trees would experience
less drought impact on growth than control trees, by
comparing mean BAI reduction in the driest 3 years
of the post-treatment record: 1996, 2000, and 2002.
Numerous authors have developed indices or models of
tree-ring
drought
response
based
on
multiple-year
data (e.g., Lloret et al., 2011; Peltier & Ogle, 2019;
Sangüesa-Barreda et al., 2015). Even when modeling
takes lagging drought effects into account (Peltier &
Ogle, 2019), there are limitations to pre-/post-drought
methods associated with the number of years chosen for
comparison (Ovenden et al., 2021; Schwarz et al., 2020).
In the present case, a full assessment of drought impact is
particularly complicated by the fact that the study has
been in drought essentially since the experiment was
initiated
(treatments
1993–1994,
drought
initiated
1995–1996) and two of the three driest years, 2000 and
2002, are within 2 years of each other. Therefore, we
constrained the analysis to comparing BAI from the
predrought year to the drought year by calculating
drought
reduction
(DR) = (BAIdr – BAIdr1)/BAIdr1.
We tested for statistically significant differences in DR by
treatment and old/young category in each drought year
with ANOVA in R. We checked diagnostic plots of resid-
uals and normal distribution of the data to be sure that
ANOVA assumptions were met. Post-hoc testing of differ-
ences in DR between treatments and categories was carried
out using Tukey’s honestly significant difference test.
Finally, we tested H4, that fine-scale (monthly) influ-
ence of climatic factors would be attenuated for treated
trees by correlating monthly climate values with BAI of
old and young trees in each of the three treatments. The
BAI values from 1983 to 2016 were converted to dimen-
sionless indices by fitting a horizontal line through the
mean and averaging the values using the R package dplR
(Bunn, 2008). This procedure creates deviations from the
overall mean without any detrending. Correlations of the
six BAI chronologies with monthly precipitation and
temperature data were carried out using the R package
treeclim (V. 2.0.5.1, Zang & Biondi, 2015, https://github.
com/cszang/treeclim).
Statistical
significance
of
the
Pearson’s correlation coefficient was assessed with 1000
bootstrapped samples taken from the original distribu-
tions of climate and BAI data.
RESULTS
Ecological restoration treatments caused major changes
in forest structure following thinning of young trees in
1993. Thinning removed an average of 2226 trees ha1
and basal area declined nearly by half (Figure 3).
Subsequent
measurements
showed
relatively
stable
density and a gradual basal area increase in the two
treatments. By the end of the study period (2014–2015),
the control averaged 2941 trees ha1 and 46.7 m2 ha1, the
partial averaged 165 trees ha1 and 19.7 m2 ha1, and the
full averaged 175 trees ha1 and 21.9 m2 ha1. The control
displayed substantial mortality, primarily of young trees,
~1000 trees ha1 by 2014–2015, while basal area continued
to increase (Figure 3).
Survival of old trees was not different in treated areas
compared with the control (90.5% control, 92.3% full,
82.6% partial; F = 0.56, p = 0.59), contradicting H1. Of
146 living old trees (mean age 245 years) at the beginning
of the experiment in 1992, 16 (10.9%) had died by 2016
(Table 1). Mortality was numerically approximately
equally distributed temporally between the first and sec-
ond decade following the initial treatments and among
the three treatments (six trees died in the control, five in
each of the treatments). On a percentage basis, however,
mortality was 65% higher in the partial treatment (15.2%)
than the control (9.2%), with the full treatment interme-
diate (10.4%) (Table 1).
Growth of young and old treated trees was signifi-
cantly higher than that of their counterparts in the con-
trol, supporting H2, despite the region entering into
extended drought essentially concurrent with the start of
the experiment (Figure 4). Both old and young tree cate-
gories of treated trees displayed high and sustained
growth in the first 2 decades following treatment. Sharp
declines occurred in the severe drought years, but BAI
growth remained higher than that of control trees and
rapidly returned to the predrought trajectory. In the most
recent decade (2007–2016) after the most severe drought
years
had
passed,
control

BAI
averaged
12.0 cm2 year1, 36% less than for old trees in the full
(18.8

and

less
than
the
partial
(23.6 cm2 year1) treatments. The difference was much
greater for young trees: controls averaged 2.6 cm2 year1,
83% less than trees in the full (15.3 cm2 year1) and
6 of 15
FULE ET AL.

86% less than the partial (18.2 cm2 year1) treatments.
Fixed effects (treatment, time, and pretreatment covariate)
explained about a third of the variation in BAI growth, and
random tree effects accounted for just more than two-thirds
the total variation (R2
m = 0.30, R2
c = 0.67) in old trees, while
fixed effects and random tree effects accounted for almost
60% and 80% of the variation, respectively (R2
m = 0.59,
R2
c = 0.78) observed in young trees.
Growth reductions in both old and young trees in the
control were significantly greater than those of treated trees
in all three of the most severe drought years (Figure 5),
supporting H3. The greatest year-to-year declines in BAI
growth were in old trees in the control, dropping by 60%,
42%, and 98% in 1996, 2000, and 2002, respectively.
Corresponding values for old trees in the full treatment
were 37%, 41%, and 83%, and for old trees in the partial
treatment they were 37%, 31%, and 77% (Figure 5). In 2002,
46 out of the 51 old control trees (90%) had absent rings,
meaning zero BAI growth. In comparison, 51% of old trees
in the full treatment and 26% of old trees in the partial
treatment had absent rings in 2002. Growth declines in
younger trees were similar to older ones in their respective
treatments except in 1996, when younger treated trees had
significantly less decline (Figure 5).
Fine-scale climatic variables of precipitation and tempera-
ture
(H4) were significantly correlated with old and
young tree BAI growth in numerous months (Figure 6).
Precipitation was always positively correlated with BAI and
temperature was always negatively correlated, except for one
case each of the opposite correlation. Growth of control trees
was more than three times as often strongly correlated to cli-
mate compared with treated trees. From a total of 36 possibly
significant correlations between climate and growth for the
months of previous October to current July, there were
15 significant correlations for old and young control trees,
versus four (plus one opposite correlation) for the full treat-
ment and three (plus one opposite) for the partial treatment.
The most notable seasonal grouping of climate effects was the
negative effect of temperature on control trees, old and young,
in May–July of the current year (Figure 5). Significant correla-
tions for the treated trees were more common for old than for
young trees, but there were only 1–3 months that were linked
to climate for old treated trees for precipitation or tempera-
ture, in contrast with 4–6 months for old control trees.

DISCUSSION
The unique opportunity to study restoration in the setting
of multicentury-old ponderosa trees in the Pearson
Natural Area has been of high scientific value (Covington
et al., 1997; Kaye et al., 2005; Kolb et al., 2007; Laughlin
et al., 2017). This experiment is a case study from within
the subcontinental range of ponderosa pine, but numer-
ous other southwestern studies have provided useful
points of comparison, as described in detail below. Across
the broader range of ponderosa pine in North America,
findings from the Pearson Natural Area experiment are
broadly
consistent
with
studies
farther
north
(e.g., Keeling & Sala, 2012; Tepley et al., 2020), albeit
with regional differences.
The effects of forest restoration treatments were posi-
tive on tree growth according to the objectives of restora-
tion and did not negatively affect old-tree survival in the
first 2 decades following treatment, despite entering into
an extended warm drought with climate-change-type
characteristics. Pre-existing differences provide an impor-
tant context to consider at the outset. The control treat-
ment had higher tree density and lower BAI growth than
the two thinning treatments prior to the experiment,
although initial BA and age distributions were nearly
identical (Figures 3 and 4; Table 1). These differences

may be an artifact of the constraint that the treated areas
were a contiguous block decommissioned from the south-
ern end of the Natural Area, meaning that random
assignment of treatments was only possible for the
thinned areas, while the control had to be the adjacent
forest that remained in Natural Area status.
A separate distinction related to treatment design is
likely to explain the higher BAI growth of young trees in the
thinned areas prior to treatment, shown in Figure 4c. The
thinning treatments removed an average of 2226 trees ha1,
all of which were in the young category (Covington
et al., 1997). The retained young trees in the thinned treat-
ments were selected based on spatial proximity to evidence
of past tree structures in the forest (Covington et al., 1997).
Of the young trees potentially suitable for retention, those
of larger size and seemingly good conditions for survival
and growth, based on attributes such as a relatively full
crown and vertical stature, were selected for retention.
These trees probably had better BAI growth on average
than the control young trees that included a random
assortment of trees growing in the dense forest, including
highly suppressed and snow bent individuals.
Survival of old trees was not statistically distinguish-
able among treatments, contradicting our first hypothesis.
Mortality was equally distributed over time and differed
by only one tree per treatment (Table 1), so there was not
a strong basis for drawing conclusions about differences
between treatments. It should also be noted that due to
the limitations of the initial experimental design—the
need to protect the historic Fort Valley Experimental
Forest headquarters—our findings regarding mortality may
have been consequently hindered (i.e., nonindependence
of replicates and small sample sizes, a limitation common
in ecological work) and may not represent conditions
elsewhere. However, one clear early indicator is that the
prescribed burning initiated in 1994 and repeated every
4 years in the full treatment did not lead to a pulse in
mortality. Fire can lead to tree death through numerous
pathways, including soil, root, and cambial heating
(Hood, Varner, et al., 2018). High cambial temperatures
associated with lengthy smoldering of deep forest floor
material probably contributed to high mortality at the
Chimney Spring research site, ~3 km from our study area
with similar forest characteristics (Sackett et al., 1996).
Those observations led to recommendations for manual
fuel reduction prior to fire reintroduction in our experi-
ment, where raking reduced accumulated duff from an
average
of
8.4–1.0
cm
before
burning
(Covington
et al., 1997). High mortality associated with forest floor
burning has not been detected consistently in studies on
other ponderosa pines in Arizona (Fowler et al., 2010; Fulé
et al., 2002, 2007) or elsewhere (Hood, Varner, et al., 2018)
but, given the high density of old, large pines at the Pearson
Natural Area, the fuel removal was judged worthwhile
(Covington et al., 1997). The cumulative mortality data
in the first 2 decades following treatment suggest that
neither the initial prescribed burn nor the five subsequent
ones in the full treatment led to old-tree death.
Overall, old-tree mortality in this experiment was sub-
stantially less than at a larger scale, long-term experimental
ponderosa forest restoration experiment carried out at
Mt
Trumbull
in
northwestern
Arizona
(Roccaforte
et al., 2010). Mortality of old trees in the current experi-
ment averaged 11% two decades after the initial measure-
ment, with 16 trees dying out of 146 total (Table 1).
At Mt Trumbull, old-tree mortality averaged 27% by 21 years
post-treatment, with 39 old trees dying out of 147 total
(control 22%, full 31%; unpublished data, J.P. Roccaforte and
others). The slightly lower elevation of the Mt Trumbull
forest (range 2000–2250 m vs. 2200 m in the current study)
and relatively severe fire effects in parts of the initial
prescribed burns following thinning (Fulé et al., 2002)
may be factors contributing to the higher mortality rate.
Growth data supported our remaining hypotheses of
increased growth, less growth decline during severe
drought, and attenuated influence of fine-scale climate
factors on treated trees. The rapid post-thinning growth
responses of old trees averaging close to 250 years old in
this experiment was reported shortly after treatment by
Feeney et al. (1998) and Stone et al. (1999), who linked
growth with higher (less negative) predawn water poten-
tial, leaf nitrogen content, and increased stomatal con-
ductance and net photosynthetic rate. Wallin et al. (2004)
showed
that
the
treatment-induced
ecophysiological
changes persisted 7 years after treatment. The present
study shows that growth differences were strongly
sustained into the second post-treatment decade with old
trees in the partial treatment averaging nearly double the
annual BAI of those in the control (Figure 4). Young
trees also had quick, positive responses to thinning that
were consistent with ecophysiological attributes (Skov
et al., 2004, 2005). Over the most recent decade, the pre-
sent study shows that BAI growth differences among
young trees were closer to an order of magnitude greater
in the treatments versus, the control, with young trees
moving closer in absolute growth to old trees: the com-
bined average for young trees in the full and partial treat-
ments for 2007–2016 was a BAI = 16.8 cm2 year1
compared with an average BAI = 21.2 cm2 year1 for old
trees in these treatments. Our experiment did not have a
“burn-only” treatment, but a repeated burning experi-
ment was installed nearby at Chimney Spring in the Fort
Valley Experimental Forest in 1976 (Sackett et al., 1996).
Forest growth was statistically indistinguishable between
controls vs. plots burned at fire rotations of 1–10 years
(Peterson et al., 1994). The difference between the

burn-only treatment and the treatments in the present
experiment are that the effects of tree thinning: basal
area was substantially reduced by thinning in the present
experiment, but that the low-intensity surface fires
caused no significant reduction of basal area in the
Chimney Spring experiment (Peterson et al., 1994).
Despite entering into “climate-change-type” drought—
that
is,
severe
drought
accompanied
by
unusually
warm temperatures (Breshears et al., 2005; Williams
et al., 2021)—both old and young trees in the treatments
had significantly less growth reduction in the driest 3 years
than their counterparts in the control. Trees in thinned
treatments
frequently
displayed
improved
drought
response, consistent with reduced competition for below-
ground resources and improved water relations and photo-
synthetic capability compared with dense stands (Feeney
et al., 1998; McDowell et al., 2007). The current study
lengthens the timeframe of growth responses, showing that
trees approaching 500 years of age are capable of extended
growth increases following thinning treatments, even after
documented declines due to intercohort competition with
younger trees (Biondi, 1996). The young trees in this study,
most of them originating in 1914 or 1919 (Savage
et al., 1996), have rapidly developed a sustained pattern of
high growth nearly an order of magnitude greater than
their control counterparts.
High growth and attenuated drought impact support
the utility of restoration treatments from a carbon
(C) dynamics perspective. James et al. (2018) found that
the majority of forest restoration treatments across west-
ern North America reported reduced C storage following
thinning and prescribed burning, adding that most infor-
mation was from short-term studies (<25 years). In these
treatments, C reduction is the intended result given the
excess of C accumulated through fire regime disruption,
compared
with
reference
conditions
(Hurteau
&
Brooks, 2011). In a ponderosa forest near the present
study site, Hurteau et al. (2010) estimated that untreated
forests had 2.3 times as much live tree carbon compared
with the same sites prior to fire exclusion. The improved
growth (C sequestration) and increased size (C storage)
per tree after treatment is at less risk of catastrophic loss
because of improved tree defenses (Wallin et al., 2004)
and greater resilience to severe fire (Fulé et al., 2012) and
climate warming (this study). Associated ecosystem bene-
fits include understory community recovery (Laughlin
et al., 2017), and, at broader scales, wildlife habitat and
watershed properties (O’Donnell et al., 2018). The pre-
sent study also reports findings <25 years after treatment,
but the stable trajectories of growth after 21 years
(Figure 4) suggest that the trends will continue.
The dependence of growth on climate (temperature
and precipitation) was strikingly weaker for treated trees
of both old and young categories (Figure 6). Typically,
such relationships are relatively stable for centuries over
broad spatial scales (e.g., Touchan et al., 2017). We are
not aware of a comparable finding in which the positive
and negative links between climate variables and tree
growth
were
rapidly
altered
by
forest
treatments.
The decoupling of temperature and precipitation from
tree growth suggests that trees in the treated areas will be
less negatively affected by warming temperatures and
drier
conditions
predicted
in
the
coming
decades
(Anderegg et al., 2019). Reductions of forest density close
to
historic,
prefire-exclusion
densities
have
been
suggested to enhance resilience not only in terms of
reducing vulnerability to wildfire but also favoring robust
growth of individual trees (North et al., 2022).
Indicators of differences between full and partial
treatments are suggested in the trend toward higher
growth of old and young trees in the partial treatment
(Figure 4) and less growth reduction during drought in
this treatment as well (Figure 5). There was no difference
between these treatments in terms of the selection of
residual trees (Covington et al., 1997) and little structural
difference between them over time (Figure 3). The
growth differences were generally relatively small and
not statistically significant, but the trends were consis-
tent. We speculate that while fire treatments have not led
to increased mortality, they may contribute to modest
growth reductions through various mechanisms of injury
(Hood, Varner, et al., 2018). Burning may impose other
financial and social costs such as fire crew expenses,
smoke, and risk of escaped fire. However, burning may
also bring about benefits such as higher plant diversity
(Laughlin
et
al.,
2017),
higher
nutrient
cycling
(Covington & Sackett, 1992), and maintaining open forest
structure in the future by controlling tree regeneration
(Hurteau et al., 2014).
The tree responses after the first 2 decades following
treatment are broadly consistent with the objectives of
restoration and suggest that these treatments at the
Pearson Natural Area have led to substantial, sustained
improvement in the growth of old and young ponderosa
pines. Treated trees are relatively less impacted by severe
drought and less linked to climate controls, implying bet-
ter performance under continuing warming trends com-
pared to untreated forests. These results are consistent
with findings across a broad southwestern network
(Stoddard et al., 2021) and with simulated performance
of similar forests under future climate scenarios (Bagdon
et al., 2016; O’Donnell et al., 2018). The fact that fire
treatments appear not to have increased mortality is also
beneficial given extensive calls for reintroduction of
surface-fire regimes (e.g., Stephens et al., 2019). Warning
signs for the future appear in the data, however.

Individual mortality of old trees is consequential at ~11%
over 21 years, and treatments have not shown a protec-
tive effect against it, although the risk of mass mortality
from wildfire is substantially lower in treated stands
(Fulé et al., 2012) and bark beetle mortality risk is also
much lower (Fettig et al., 2007). Conversely, the rapid
growth of young treated trees indicates the development
of a new cohort of large trees to replace dying ancient
trees. The trend toward higher growth performance
(albeit lower survival) in the partial versus the full treat-
ment may imply some negative effects of burning on
average growth. Finally, despite strong confirmation that
restoration treatments are far superior to no-action in
terms of improving future forest adaptation to warming
climate, bioclimatic niche estimates (Rehfeldt et al., 2020),
simulation studies (Yazzie et al., 2019), and trait-based
modeling (Laughlin et al., 2012) indicate that warming
may result in severe declines in ponderosa pine in the
region during this century.
