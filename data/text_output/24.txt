ABSTRACT  
SNAGS AND PARTIAL SNAGS IN MANAGED, RELICT, AND RESTORED  
PONDEROSA PINE FORESTS OF THE SOUTHWEST  
JUSTIN D. WASKIEWICZ  
Snags form an important habitat resource in ponderosa pine forests, but are 
susceptible to destruction in wildfires. Partial snags - live trees bearing dead parts - have 
been suggested as a more fire-resistant alternative to snags that may have played an 
important role in pre-settlement forests and may become important following treatments 
designed to emulate pre-settlement forest structure and function. I studied snags and 
partial snags in a managed forest receiving restoration treatments at Mt. Trumbull, 
Arizona to learn how restoration treatments affect the densities, characteristics, and use of 
snags by wildlife. I studied partial snags at four unmanaged relict sites in Arizona and 
New Mexico to estimate their quantity, quality, and use in relatively undisturbed forests, 
and to establish a protocol for their future measurement and description. 
At Mt. Trumbull, snag loss was five times higher in treated than in control plots 
Newly recruited snags outnumbered losses in both treatment and control plots, leading to 
net snag density increases 10 times higher in treatment than control plots. Partial snags 
were destroyed at the same rate in both treatment and control plots, but were more likely 
to remain standing than snags in treatment plots. Cavity-bearing snags decreased slightly 
in both control and treatment plots . Trees bearing evidence of woodpecker foraging 
11 

increased slightly in control plots and by almost four times in treatment plots. Trees 
bearing ant colonies increased by half in control plots and decreased slightly in treatment 
plots. 
Partial snag densities at relict sites ranged from 2.13 to 3.18 per ha and spike­
topped trees were the most common type at all four. The managed site had 1.70 partial 
snags per ha and lightning scars were the most common type. At relict sites, 19% of 
partial snags contained excavated cavities, while at the managed site, 42% did. Partial 
snags with greater-than-median surface area of dead wood, distance to nearest 
neighboring snag and dbh, and less than median crown-base height were 
disproportionately selected from partial snags at relict sites. I developed models for 
estimating dead wood surface areas in spike-topped and in lightning-scarred trees that do 
not require time-consuming measurements or heavy equipment.

CHAPTER 1 
INTRODUCTION 
Snags (standing dead trees) are an important component of wildlife habitat in 
ponderosa pine forests (Scott 1978, Cunningham et al. 1980), providing many species of 
birds, mammals, reptiles and invertebrates with food and cover (Thomas et al. 1979, 
Davis 1983). The structure and composition of snag populations has likely changed since 
European-American settlement (about 1875) just as have the forests that contain them 
(Covington and Moore 1994, Ganey 1999, Fule et al. 2002). Frequent fires prior to the 
turn of the century probably consumed many snags before they reached advanced stages 
of deterioration; so current populations may be both more dense and more heavily 
skewed toward older deterioration classes than would be seen under a historic fire regime 
(Boucher et al. 1999, Ganey 1999). 
Ecosystem restoration treatments, consisting of understory thinning followed by 
prescribed surface burning, are used to create forest structures and functions more 
consistent with pre-settlement conditions in the Southwest (Covington et al. 1997). 
Restoration efforts do not explicitly address wildlife habitat, rather aiming at broad 
ecosystem goals that are implicitly assumed to improve native wildlife habitat conditions 
(Reynolds et al. 1996, Long and Smith 1998, Wagner et al. 2000, Block et al. 2001) . 
Treatments dramatically and abruptly alter forest structure, but achieving final desired 
conditions and desired ecosystem function may take decades or even centuries. There is 
some concern about the effects of the initial treatment and recovery period on wildlife 
1  

at least European-American settlement. I expected the partial snag resources at these 
sites to be representative of that available prior to settlement and after successful 
restoration. 
The objectives of this study were: 1) to estimate the density, size, condition, and 
wildlife use of snags in a managed forest, and compare the snag resource there to 
published standards, 2) to record the quantitative and qualitative changes in snag and 
partial snag populations and their use following restoration treatments, and 3) to estimate 
the quantity, quality and use ofpartial snags in relict sites of the Southwest and establish 
a protocol for their measurement and description.

CHAPTER 2  
LITERATURE REVIEW  
Ecological Importance of Snags 
Jefferies (1878) was first to note the ecological importance of snags, describing 
their use by owls, woodpeckers, nuthatches, creepers and swallows, as well as beetles, 
woodlice and other insects, and advocating that snags and hollow trees should be 
"permitted to linger awhile safe from the axe." Grinnel and Storer (1924) were also early 
to recognize the utility of snags, thought the subject was not widely investigated until the 
1970's (Neitro et al. 1985). Standing dead trees are now know to be important to many 
bird species as sites for foraging (Raphael and White 1984, Morrison et al. 1987, Weikel 
and Hayes 1999), roosting (Sydeman and Giintert 1983, Cooper 1999), display, 
communication, and other uses (Miller and Miller 1980, Davis 1983). Mammal species 
also use snags (Armijo 1979, Thomas et al. 1979, Smith and Mannan 1994, Chambers et 
al. 2002) ; some species of forest bats depend on them for roost sites (Rabe et al. 1998). 
Dead trees act as growth substrates for fungi, mosses and lichens, and are used by 
invertebrates as food and cover (Thomas et al. 1979, Neitro et al. 1985, McComb and 
Lindenmayer 1999). 
Snag removal reduces cavity-nesting bird numbers (Scott 1979, Scott and 
Oldemeyer 1983, Lohr et al. 2002). In northern Arizona, over 25 species of bird, ranging 
in size from the pygmy nuthatch to the threatened Mexican spotted owl depend on dead 
trees for nesting sites (Scott and Patton 1975). In ponderosa pine forests, these cavity­
nesting species may constitute over a third of total bird diversity and their population 
6  

densities are significantly correlated with snag densities (CUnningham et al. 1980). 
Whether snags are limiting to bird populations depends on the species in question as well 
as the stand in question (Welsh and Capen 1992, Brush 1983, Brawn and Balda 1988). 
Wildlife selection of snags 
Birds disproportionately select larger snags for nesting (Scott 1978, Thomas et al. 
1979, Cline et al. 1980, Cunningham et al. 1980, Mannan et al. 1980, Raphael and White 
1984, Raphael and Morrison 1987). Forest bats also roost disproportionately in larger 
than average pine snags Rabe et al. (1998). Larger diameter snags provide more 
insulating volume as well as more surface area in which to locate nest or roost sites 
(Miller and Miller 1980). Larger snags are also heavily selected for foraging sites, 
presumably because their larger volume and surface areas provide habitat for more 
invertebrate prey (Raphael and White 1984). Thomas et al. (1979) suggested that a 
relatively large snag could always be substituted for a smaller one, but not vice-versa. 
The habitat value of small snags should not be discounted, however; Horton and Mannan 
(1988) noted heavy foraging use of small snags produced following prescribed fire and 
Thomas et al. (1979) noted that snags of deciduous species, though often smaller than 
pine snags, are heavily used wherever they occur. 
Soft (rotten) snags with high bark retention are heavily used by birds for both 
nesting and foraging (Thomas et al. 1979, Cunningham et al. 1980, Raphael and White 
1984, Neitro et al. 1985), although Miller and Miller (1980) stress an important 
distinction between heartwood decay, which is of high value, and sapwood decay, which 
is oflesser importance. Hard (fresh) snags are very important as well, since they serve as 
7  

a recruitment pool for soft snags and also because they are used directly by bark-gleaners 
and some stronger-billed cavity-nesters (Mannan et al. 1980). Bark retention is an 
important parameter in wildlife use; bats, brown creepers, and invertebrates seek food 
and shelter directly in, on or under bark (Scott and Patton 1975, Neitro et al. 1985), and it 
can play an important role in retaining moisture which influences rate of decay (Raphael 
and White 1984). Forest bats disproportionately select snags with loose patches of bark 
(Rabe et al. 1998), and Cunningham et al. (1980) found that many active cavity-nesting 
bird nest holes were surrounded by bark. Broken tops are also often associated with 
cavity nests, possibly because bole breakage facilitates the entrance of wood-decay fungi 
(McClelland and Frissel 1975). 
Wildlife selection of snags may ultimately depend on factors that are undetectable 
to human observers (Schepps et al. 1999). Bole hardness and the presence of heart-rot 
fungi are apparently very important in determining both the selection of a tree for cavity­
building and in the location of cavities but are nearly impossible to determine without 
dissection of the tree (Conner et al. 1976, Miller and Miller 1980, Schepps et al. 1999). 
Snag management guidelines 
Representation of a variety of decay states and size classes, with enough young 
(recently died) snags to provide for future old snags, is an appropriate habitat 
management goal (Neitro et al. 1985). Cunningham et al. 1980 recommended 5.2 snags 
(>33 em dbh X 6 m height) per ha in southwestern ponderosa pine forests to maintain 
"natural" cavity nester populations. U.S. Forest Service guidelines for the same type 
recommend 4.9 large (> 46 em X 9 m) snags per ha (Reynolds et al. 1992). Ganey (1999) 
8  

observed only (1.0-2.0) large snags/ha in northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests, and 
found that most were highly decayed. Large snag densities were lower than USFS 
recommendations even in stands that had never been logged, with a median density of 
only 2.0 large snags per ha. Ganey (1999) and Boucher et al. (1999) cast doubt on the 
appropriateness of Forest Service guidelines, suggesting that natural snag densities under 
a frequent fire regime might have been much lower, given the propensity for snags to be 
destroyed by fire. 
Snag Dynamics 
Recruitment 
Snags are recruited from live trees by mortality, which has many causes. Pearson 
(1938) estimated mortality rates of 1% per year in southwestern ponderosa pine over 30 
em in diameter breast height (dbh), listing wind, lightning, dwarf mistletoe, and insects as 
the primary mortality factors, with smaller losses attributed to fire and competition. 
Lightning and wind together account for about 70% of the mortality in northern Arizona 
pine forests (Gaines and Shaw 1959). Wind is more likely to produce logs than snags , so 
lightning, which alone accounts for about a third of mortality, is the largest single source 
of new snags (Wadsworth 1943). Bark beetles are the third largest mortali ty factor, also 
leaving individual or small groups of snags (Pearson 1933, Gaines and Shaw 1959, Avery 
et al. 1976). Wildfires and large insect outbreaks - particularly prevalent in Arizona in 
the summer of2002 - can recruit millions of snags at high densities. These are 
undoubtedly important snag recruitment factors on a landscape scale, but are not a 
consistent contributor to stand-scale snag populations. 
9 

Competition induces mortality among smaller trees and is likely an important 
factor as the dominant cohort of pines passes through the stem exclusion stage of stand 
development (Oliver and Larson 1996, Boucher et al. 1999, Mast and Veblen 1999). 
Ganey (1999) found that small snags «30cm dbh) dominated snag populations in 
southwestern ponderosa pine forests. Asymmetric competition between the dense 
regeneration and the overstory may also induce mortality in large size classes (Biondi 
1996, Mast et al. 1999). 
Deterioration 
As snags decay, they lose needles, twigs, branches, bark and eventually sections 
of bole (Thomas et al. 1979, Bull 1983, Cline et al. 1980, Neitro et al.l985). Numerous 
authors have devised systems to classify snags by their level of decay, based on 
observations ofbark cover, twig and limb retention, wood quality, or some combination 
(Keen 1955, Gale 1973, Scott 1978, Thomas et al. 1979, Cline et al. 1980, Raphael and 
White 1984, Horton and Mannan 1988, Boucher et al. 1999, Waskiewicz and Fu16in 
review). Classification systems are used to model future snag numbers and quality 
(Neitro et al. 1985), to predict wildlife selection (Raphael and White 1984), to describe 
management impacts (Horton and Mannan 1988), and to model past forest structure 
(Mast et al. 1999). Decay rates (progression through a given class system) are likely 
influenced by a host offactors, including size (Keen 1929, Kimmey and Furniss 1943, 
Basham and Belyea 1960, Cline et al. 1980, Bull 1983), soil conditions (Keen 1955), 
cause of death (Morrison and Raphael 1993), ring density (Kimmey and Furniss 1943, 
10  

Basham and Belyea 1960), exposure (Raphael and Monison 1987), species (Clark 1957, 
Fule et al. 2002) and breakage (Mannan et al. 1980, Raphael and Monison 1987). 
Snags are lost from a population when they collapse (either break or fall over), are 
cut down, or are consumed by fire. Microbes and wood boring insects consume dead 
wood until a snag becomes too weak to support its weight or the stresses of wind and 
weather (Keen 1929, Kimmey and Furniss 1943). Keen (1955) estimated the falling rates 
of beetle-killed pine in southeastern Oregon and northeastern California, finding a 
sigmoid pattern in which the majority of snags fell between 5 and 15 years after tree 
death. A similar pattern was reported by Keen (1929, 1955), Dahms (1949), 
Cunningham et al. (1980), Bull (1983) and Chambers (2002) with a high initial treefall 
dominated by smaller snags, followed by a tapering off of treefall as larger trees are lost 
more gradually. Prior to the 1970's, management focused on removing snags to increase 
growing space for live trees, and reduce fire hazard (Woolsey 1911, Keen 1929, Pearson 
1938, Dahms 1949, Keen 1955). 
Fire-Altered Snag Dynamics and Use 
Dynamics 
Fire killed trees that remain standing add to a snag population (Gaines et al. 
1958). Surface fires may kill trees through crown injury, cambium injury or root injury 
(Reinhart and Ryan 1988). Larger trees and trees with thick bark are more likely to 
survive fire, though deep basal litter and debris piles can kill otherwise resistant trees by 
11  

buming hotter or smoldering longer than the tree bark can withstand (Reinhardt and Ryan 
1988, Sackett et al. 1996). In the Coronado National Forest, Horton and Mannan (1988) 
reported that most new snags created by a prescribed surface fire in ponderosa pine were 
small - less than 15 em dbh. Gordon (1996), found that 69% of new snags created 
following prescribed burns in Coconino and Kaibab national forests were 15 to 20 em in 
diameter (she did not measure those below 15 em). 
Fire can radically alter a snag 's decay state without destroying it completely by 
causing breakage, burning off leaves, twigs, or limbs, or burning away bark cover 
(Gordon 1996). Snags recruited from fire-killed timber may deteriorate more rapidly than 
those killed by other causes (Laudenslayer 2002). 
Gaines et al. (1958) did not specifically report on the destruction and creation of 
snags following the two fall burns in Arizona's Blue Mountains, but did report net 
changes in numbers of small (5-29 em dbh) and large (30+ ern dbh) snag numbers as part 
of an assessment of fuels. The cooler fire resulted in a net loss and the hotter fire a net 
gain of snags, particularly those of small size. 
Horton and Mannan (1988) provided a detailed assessment of snag population 
changes following a controlled bum in the Coronado National Forest. Snags greater than 
30 ern dbh, and those in the fourth decay class (of their six) were destroyed in higher 
proportion than the remainder of the population. They speculated that larger and more 
decayed snags had developed deeper litter and debris layers around their bases than 
smaller or younger snags, but that the debris piles of snags in classes 5 and 6 had decayed 
enough that they contained less caloric content than those in class 4. Snags in classes 1-3 
were apparently protected from flames by both a smaller debris pile and by the retention 
12  

of fire-resistant bark. In Horton and Mannan's (1988) study, fires created fewer snags 
than were destroyed, and mostly from smaller «15 em) size trees, resulting in a net 45% 
loss of snags by one year after treatment. 
Gordon (1996) found that 65% ofponderosa pine snags remained "useful to 
wildlife" following prescribed fire. She found that snags on slopes or with deeper litter 
piles at their bases were more likely to be destroyed than those on level ground or with 
less basal debris. She also found that raked buffers that exposed mineral soil around 
snags improved survival (27% of raked snags were destroyed, versus 50% of.un-raked). 
Wildlife use 
Horton and Mannan (1988) studied changes in cavity-nesting bird populations 
following a prescribed burn. They found a reduction in violet-green swallow and 
northern flicker populations, and an increase in mountain chickadee numbers in treated 
areas one year after burning. Dwyer and Block (2000) found that moderately intense 
wildfires caused non-significant decreases in most cavity-nesting species (western 
bluebirds increased) . They found no secondary cavity-nesting birds in severely burned 
plots. Lowe et al. (1978) reported changes in snag dependent species following high­
intensity fires. They classified birds by foraging type. Drillers briefly increased in 
numbers, then leveled off, while timber gleaners decreased. 
Partial snags 
Live trees bearing deadwood components, such as lightning scars , dead ("spike") 
tops, large dead limbs and other types of wounds or scars are called partial snags or 
13  

"living snags" (Mast et al. 1999). Lightning damage is common in ponderosa pine 
forests of northem Arizona (Pearson 1938, Wadsworth 1943). Besides lightning, partial 
snags may be created by mistletoe, bark beetles, competition, fungal infection, or drought 
stress (Pearson 1938). Animal damage (especially girdling by porcupines) and logging 
damage may also create some partial snags. Fule et al. (2002) noted that Gambel oak 
often die gradually, in sections, and heart rot is common in larger oak (Reynolds et al. 
1970). Gaines et al. (1958) reported unspecified damage to residual live trees from 
prescribed bums in the fall, suggesting that non-lethal fire damage may also create partial 
snags. 
Partial snags may be used by many of the same wildlife species and for many of 
the same purposes as "full" snags (Boucher et al. 1999, Ganey 1999). Rabe et al. (1998) 
noted bats roosting in lightning scars, Raphael and White (1984) found 21% of avian 
cavity nests in live trees, and Li and Martin (1991) found 38% in live trees. Miller and 
Miller (1980) noted that 40 percent of the cavities found in 6 published and unpublished 
studies were in live trees. Scott et al. (1978) found cavities in dead tops and scars on the 
Fraser experimental forest (CO) and Cunningham et al. (1980) reported numerous active 
cavities in spike-topped trees, particularly broken ones. Partial snags may also have an 
important role to playas a ready recruitment pool for future snags, as they are often 
already under stress (Mast et al. 1999). 
"Trees are excavated because of what is going on inside them, not because they 
are dead" (Miller and Miller 1980, p. 340). Partial snags with dead or especially with 
broken tops (Cunningham et al. 1980) may be particularly useful for nesting sites, 
because the introduction of heart rot within a sound shell of sapwood is more likely 
14  

(Miller and Miller 1980) and produces a structure of great utility to wildlife (McClelland 
and Frissel 1975, Miller and Miller 1980, Cunningham et al. 1980). Snags that were 
partial snags before their complete death may be more valuable than snags that were 
killed instantly, also because of the introduction of heart rots while alive (Miller and 
Miller 1980, p. 340 - "whether a tree will be a good potential nest tree is actually 
determined before the tree dies.. ."). 
Partial snags may be more likely to survive (at least remain standing, ifkilled) 
after a fire than snags, because they retain a living layer of insulating bark at the base. 
Because of this, some have suggested an important habitat role for partial snags prior to 
the disruption of the pre-settlement fire regime (Boucher et al. 1999, Ganey 1999, Mast et 
al. 1999).

CHAPTER 3 
INVENTORY OF SNAGS AT MT. TRUMBULL, ARIZONA PRIOR TO 
INITIATION OF ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION TREATMENTS 
Abstract: Snags are important habitat components for a variety of wildlife 
species in northern Arizona. I inventoried the quality, quantity, and wildlife use of 
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) snags at Mt. Trumbull, AZ. Pine snag densities 
ranged from 2.1 to 5.6 per ha, with populations dominated by small snags. Snag 
populations failed to meet the density criteria recommended by the US Forest Service and 
cavity-nesting bird literature. Snag populations were dominated by snags of recent 
condition, but among large (;:83 ern dbh) snags seperately, the most advanced condition 
dominated . Larger diameter snags of both species were disproportionately used as 
excavated cavity sites, foraging sites, and ant colony sites. Excavated cavity presence was 
also associated with taller snags . 
INTRODUCTION 
In northern Arizona, over 25 species of forest birds, ranging in size from the 
pygmy nuthatch to the threatened Mexican spotted owl, depend on dead trees for nesting 
sites (Scott and Patton 1975). In ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum) 
forests, these birds may constitute over a third of total avian biodiversity and their 
population sizes are strongly correlated with snag density (Cunningham et al. 1980). 
Standing dead trees are also important to many bird species as sites for foraging (Raphael 
22  

and White 1984, Morrison et al. 1987, Weikel and Hayes 1999), roosting (Sydeman and 
Guntert 1983, Cooper 1999), display, communication, and other uses (Miller and Miller 
1980, Davis 1983). Mammal species are also known to use snags (Armijo 1979, Smith 
and Mannan 1994, Thomas et al. 1979); some species of forest bats depend on snags for 
roost sites (Rabe et al. 1998). Dead trees act as growth substrates for fungi, mosses and 
lichens, and are used by invertebrates for food and cover (Thomas et al. 1979, Neitro et 
al. 1985). 
Invertebrates that use snags for sustenance or shelter include species important to 
forest ecosystems. Wood borers (Buprestidae) and bark beetles (Scolytidae) are 
important food items for woodpeckers, together making up over 40% of the diet of hairy 
woodpeckers (Picoides villosus) in Otvos and Stark's (1985) California study. Ants 
(Formicidae), including carpenter ants (Camponotus species), also form a large part of 
the hairy woodpecker diet and form a majority of the food volume consumed by northern 
flickers (Colaptes auratus). Carpenter ants are also very important to the diets of 
sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus) and acorn woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorusi (Scott and 
Patton 1975, Otvos and Stark 1985), and they may additionally play an important role in 
regulating the numbers of other insects (Sanders 1970). 
Birds disproportionately select relatively larger snags for nesting (Scott 1978, 
Thomas et al. 1979, Cline et al.l980, Cunningham et al. 1980, Mannan et al. 1980, 
Raphael and White 1984, Raphael and Morrison 1987). Forest bats also roost 
disproportionately in larger than average pine snags Rabe et al. (1998). Larger diameter 
snags provide more insulating volume as well as more surface area in which to locate 
nest or roost sites (Miller and Miller 1980). Larger snags are also heavily selected for 
23  

foraging sites, presumably because their larger volume and surface areas provide habitat 
for more invertebrate prey species (Raphael and White 1984, Weikel and Hayes 1999). 
Cline (1977) found that carpenter ant colonies were most common in large diameter 
snags. Thomas et al. (1979) suggested that a large snag could always be substituted for a 
smaller one, but not vice-versa. The habitat value of small snags should not be 
discounted, however; Horton and Mannan (1988) reported heavy foraging use of small 
snags produced following prescribed fire, and Thomas et al. (1979) noted that snags of 
deciduous species, though often smaller than pine snags, are heavily used wherever they 
occur. 
Soft (rotten) snags with high bark retention are heavily used by birds for both 
nesting and foraging (Thomas et al. 1979, Cwmingham et al. 1980, Raphael and 'White 
1984, Neitro et al. 1985), although Miller and Miller (1980) stress an important 
distinction between heartwood decay, which is of high value for nest construction, and 
sapwood decay, which is of lesser value. Heavily decayed snags may be more likely to 
harbor carpenter ants (Cline 1977). Hard (fresh) snags are very important as well, since 
they serve as a recruitment pool for soft snags and also because they are used directly by 
bark-gleaners and some stronger-billed cavity-nesters (Mannan et al. 1980). Bark 
retention is an important parameter in wildlife use. Bats, brown creepers (Certhia 
americana) , and invertebrates seek food and shelter directly in, on or under bark (Scott 
and Patton 1975, Thomas et al. 1979, Neitro et al. 1985), and bark can play an important 
role in retaining moisture, which influences rate of decay (Raphael and White 1984). 
Forest bats disproportionately select snags with loose patches of bark (Rabe et al. 1998), 
and Cunningham et al. (1980) found that many active cavity-nesting bird nest holes were 
24

surrounded by bark. Broken tops are also often associated with cavity nests, possibly 
because bole breakage facilitates the entrance of wood-decay fungi (McClelland and 
Frissel 1975). 
Higher snag densities are significantly correlated with higher cavity-nesting bird 
densities in southwestern ponderosa pine forests (Cunningham et a1. 1980), and snag 
removal is known to reduce cavity-nesting bird numbers (Scott 1979, Scott and 
Oldemeyer 1983). However, whether snags' are limiting to bird populations depends on 
the species in question as well as the stand in question (Welsh and Capen 1992, Brush 
1983, Brawn and Balda 1988). McComb and Lindenmayer (1999) suggested establishing 
deadwood or cavity tree goals as the first step in managing for these resources. 
Cunningham et a1. 1980 recommended 5.2 snags (>33 em dbh X 6 m height) per 
ha in southwestern ponderosa pine forests to maintain "natural" cavity nester populations. 
In addition, they recommended that snags should have ~ 40% bark cover. U.S. Forest 
Service (USFS) guidelines for the same type recommend 4.9 snags (> 46 em X 9 m) per 
ha (Reynolds et al. 1992). Ganey (1999) found that only 6.7% of ponderosa pine plots 
surveyed in northern Arizona forests met or exceeded Forest Service standards, and that 
median large snag densities ranged from 1.0 to 2.0 per ha (95% CI). Even on un-logged 
sites, only 30% (of 10) of plots met or exceeded USFS snag guidelines. 
I inventoried ponderosa pine snags on five 7.6 to 10.4 ha plots in a managed 
forest in Northern Arizona in 1998 and 1999. I recorded the size, condition, and wildlife 
use of all snags greater than 10 em dbh and 1.8 m in height within the five plots. My 
objective was to estimate the number and characteristics of snags and cavity-bearing 
snags of different size and condition classes prior to implementation of restoration 
25  

treatments within the plots (McComb and Lindenmayer 1999). I hypothesized that, as in 
the managed forests in Ganey's (1999) study, snag populations at Mt. Trumbull would 
not meet the density requirements of either Cunningham et al. (1980) or the USFS. I also 
hypothesized that bird-created cavities would be concentrated in snags of larger diameter 
classes (Scott 1978, Cunningham et al. 1980, and others), taller height classes (diameter 
is directly related to height), and in closer proximity to other snags (Miller and Miller 
1980). I expected that evidence of foraging on the bole by birds would show similar 
associations with diameter, height, and proximity to .other snags. I expected ant colonies 
to be concentrated in snags of larger diameter and more decayed condition, but to be 
unrelated to height or proximity to other snags. 
METHODS 
The study area for this project was between Mt. Trumbull and Mt. Logan, north of 
the Colorado River in Arizona, 36
0 22' N, 113
0 7' W, within the Grand Canyon-Parashant 
National Monument. Elevation ranged from about 2,000 to 2,300 m, with volcanic­
derived soils. Precipitation fell mostly in winter and in Monsoon season (July­
September) thunderstorms, averaging 50.5 em annually (1977-1997). Vegetation was 
dominated by ponderosa pine and Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii), with some Utah 
juniper (Juniperus osteosperma), Colorado pinyon (Pinus edulis), and New Mexican 
locust (Robinia neomexicana). The area experienced frequent surface fires prior to 1870, 
when grazing, logging, and fire suppression altered the natural structure and disturbance 
regime, leading to the pathological tree densities and fuel levels now typical of 
southwestern forests (Moore et al. 1999). 
26 

Five blocks (designated "EB" 1-5) of approximately 14 ha each were established 
in 1997, representing the range of elevations and forest structures at the Mt. Trumbull site 
(Table 1.1). Forty permanent points (plot centers for another study) were established in 
each block, at 60 by 60m spacing, and permanently marked with steel rebar stakes driven 
into the ground (Fule et al. 2001). I established snag inventory plots as the polygons 
formed by connecting the outermost points in each block. 
Within each plot, all standing dead ponderosa pine trees greater than 10cm in 
diameter breast height (dbh ) and 1.8m in total height were defined as snags. These limits 
are the smallest dimensions reported (Thomas et al. 1979) for nest trees of any species 
found in the area (the mountain chickadee, Poecile gambeli), and are consistent with a 
personal experience-based estimate of the minimum size of snag likely to be used. 
Gambe1 oak snags OCCUlTed in some EBs, but at variable and often low density. They 
were not included in this inventory. 
In the summers of 1998 and 1999, I marked each snag within the 5 plots with a 
uniquely-numbered aluminum tag and recorded its measurements. For each tree I 
measured dbh with a metric steel diameter-tape, height using a clinometer, and polar 
coordinate location from the nearest permanent grid point using a hand-compass and 
metric tape measure. Diameter is an important parameter for describing snag population 
characteristics, and is likely to be closely related to wildlife use. Height may also be 
related to wildlife use. Location data make nearest neighbor distances calculable and 
may be useful in the future to find snags in resurveys. Nearest neighbor distances help to 
quantify snag distribution, and may also be a factor in wildlife selection. 
27  

I classified each snag into one of three condition classes, a modified version of 
Thomas et al.' s (1979) system for snags in the Blue Mountains of Oregon. Fresh snags, 
retaining most bark and twigs were classified as "recent." Snags missing patches of bark, 
and with gaps between remaining bark and wood were classified as "loose-bark." Snags 
that were missing most to all of their bark were classified as "clean." These designations 
correspond to chronological deterioration of pine snags at Mt. Trumbull (Waskiewicz and 
Fule in review), but do not correspond to wood condition. Bole breakage was recorded 
separately. 
In each snag, I visually inspected the bole to determine the presence of cavities 
excavated by primary cavity-nesting birds. At Mt. Trumbull, these species include the 
hairy woodpecker (Picoides villosus), northern flicker (Colaptes auratusi, acorn 
woodpecker (Melanerpes formicivorusi, Williamson's sapsucker (Sphyrapicus 
thyroideus) and pygmy nuthatch (Siua pygmaea). Abandoned cavities at Mt. Trumbull 
may be used again by the western bluebird (Sialia mexicana), white-breasted nuthatch 
(Sitta carolinensis), violet-green swallow (Tachycineta thalassia) and mountain 
chickadee, but I made no attempt to ascertain cavity occupation, defining snags with ~1 
excavated cavity as "cavity-bearing" (Scott 1978, Swallow et al. 1986). Most primary 
cavity-nesting birds excavate at least one new cavity each year, and often use more than 
one in a given year for roosting (Short 1979). They may also initiate, but not finish, 
many cavities (Jackson 1976), which would be indistinguishable from complete cavities 
by an observer on the ground. Cavities may also persist long after creation, and even after 
occupation has ceased. Cavity-bearing trees cannot, therefore, be used to estimate bird 
density, and can be used to indicate nest site selection only with caution. Snags bearing 
28  

cavi ties may no longer possess some attributes that occurred at the time of bird selection. 
Snag condition class, in particular, is likely to change in the years following cavity 
excavation. 
I also visually inspected snag boles for evidence of foraging. Visible foraging 
evidence consisted of bark scaling on the surface of, or deep drilling into the bole. At Mt. 
Trumbull, hairy woodpeckers are most likely to be responsible for both types of foraging 
evidence as they harvest bark beetles and wood borers, although northern flickers and 
nuthatches may be responsible for some evidence. Like excavated cavities, foraging 
evidence, especially drilling, can persist long after the conditions present at its creation 
have changed, so it can only be compared to relatively permanent or slow-changing snag 
attributes, such as diameter, height, and nearest-neighbor distance, not condition. 
Some snags were vigorously defended by ants (most likely Camponotus sp.) and I 
interpreted this behavior as an indicator of ant colony presence. Ant use of snags was 
current at the time of inventory, so I considered all snag attributes to be potential 
indicators of selection. 
For each plot, I calculated the density of pine snags meeting first Cunningham et 
al.'s (1980), then the USFS size criteria. One-sample t-tests (Ho: Density at Mt. Trumbull 
< recommended density, n = 5, a = 0.05) compared snag densities at Mt. Trumbull to 
recommended densities. 
Snags used by wildlife were infrequent, so I pooled use data across the five plots 
before testing selection. I tested wildlife selection of snags using an ad hoc distribution 
free exact test: ENi=n [N! / ((i!) * (N - i)!)] /2 N = P(n+ IN), where N is the total number 
of snags with a characteristic of interest (cavity-bearing trees, for example), and n is the 
29  

total number of those trees whose variable of interest (diameter, for example) exceeds the 
population median for that measurement. The test yields the exact probability of 
randomly selecting n number of snags greater than the population median for a given 
variable from N number of snags bearing a given characteristic (for example, the 
probability that 30 of 31 cavity-bearing snags will be larger than the median snag 
diameter is 1.49 * 10-8 if selection is random with respect to diameter). I used this test on 
the following hypotheses for each type of wildlife use (cavity presence, foraging 
evidence presence and ant colony presence) and for each of three continuous variables 
(dbh, height and distance to nearest neighbor): 1) selection for the given use among the 
whole population is random with respect to the given variable, 2) selection for the given 
use among the segment of the population that has a value of the given variable ;:::the 
minimum value of that variable for used snags is random with respect to the variable, 3) 
selection for the given use among the segment of the population that has dbh ~inimum 
dbh of used snags is random with respect to the given variable. The first hypothesis test 
determined if a relationship might exist between a given use and variable. The second 
and third tests were used only when hypothesis 1 was rejected for a given use - variable 
combination and test whether the relation exhibits a threshold pattern (2) or is driven by 
diameter (3), which is considered to be the most important factor in snag selection 
(Thomas et al. 1979). All tests had ex = 0.05. 
Because ant colony presence is a direct and current, rather than indirect and 
retrospective measure of use, I tested ant selection of snags against the more ephemeral 
characteristics of condition class and bole breakage. I used Chi-square tests of 
independence (Pearson 1900) to test the null hypotheses of 1) independence between ant 
30  
7 

colony presence and snag condition 2) independence between ant colony presence and 
bole breakage (ex = 0.05). 
RESULTS 
I tagged and measured 184 pine snags across the five plots. Snag densities 
averaged 4.1 per ha (95% CI: 2.3 to 6.1)(Table 1.2). The distribution of pine snag 
diameters across the five plots was skewed, with large numbers of small snags, but 
appeared to approximate a normal distribution for sizes greater than about 30cm (Fig. 
. 1.1). There was no relationship between total snag density and the density of "large" (by 
either recommendation standard) snags - large snags constituted neither a constant 
proportion of the snag populations, nor did they occur at a constant density. 
Snags meeting Curmingham et al.'s (1980) size criteria had an average density of 
1.6 per ha (95% CI: 0.6 to 2.6), which was significantly lower (P = 0.001) than the 
recommended density of 5.2 per ha. When Curmingham et al.'s bark cover 
recommendations were also considered, Mt. Trumbull snag densities were still more 
deficient (Table 1.2). Snags meeting USFS size criteria had an average density of 1.0 per 
ha (95% CI: 0.1 to 1.9), which was significantly lower (P < 0.001) than the recommended 
density of 4.9 per ha. 
Almost 55% ofMt. Trumbull snags bore at least one type of wildlife use; 17% 
contained excavated cavities, 38% displayed foraging evidence and 27% harbored ant 
colonies. Wildlife use types were not mutually exclusive; 41% of the trees that were used 
by wildlife exhibited use of more than one type. 
31  

Distribution free exact test results failed to reject hypothesis I for cavity presence 
relative to nearest neighbor distance, and foraging evidence relative to height and nearest 
neighbor distance, but rejected the random selection hypothesis for the other six use ­
variable combinations (Table 1.3). Birds at Mt. Trumbull disproportionately selected 
snags in the broader and taller halves of the population for nesting, and in the broader 
half of the population for foraging. Ants disproportionately selected snags in the broader 
and taller halves of the population and beyond the median distance from other snags. 
Tests ofhypothesis 2 indicated that the minimum diameters of cavity-bearing 
(42.6 ern) and ant colony-bearing (22.7 em) snags were threshold levels. For each use, 
selection among snags equal to or exceeding the minimum diameter did not differ from 
expectations ofrandom chance allocation (P = 0.141 and P = 0.101, respectively). Such 
threshold values did not appear for cavity site selection by height (P = 0.015), forage 
selection by diameter (P = 0.046), nor for ant selection by height (p = 0.033) and nearest 
neighbor distance (P = 0.008). 
Tests of hypothesis 3, performed for use-variable combinations not already 
including dbh, indicated that dbh was driving the apparent ant selection by height and 
nearest neighbor distance. When minimum diameter thresholds were satisfied, ant 
colonies were found no more often than expected on either side of the median height (P = 
0.336) or the median distance (P = 0.336). Cavity nesting birds, however, still 
disproportionately selected taller snags even among those that met the minimum diameter 
threshold (P = 0.015). A similar test showed that, among snags that met or exceeded both 
the minimum height (4.2) and minimum diameter of used snags, selection was no longer 
disproportionately distributed around the median height (P = 0.360). 
32 
b 

Because diameter was a factor in snag selection by ants, I entered only snags 
meeting or exceeding the minimum used diameter into Chi-square analysis of selection 
by condition class and bole breakage. Smaller snags tend to be of younger condition and 
are less likely to be broken than larger snags because they are more likely to fall over 
before they reach advanced states of decay and are less exposed to wind. Including 
smaller snags in the test might have confounded the known diameter effect on snag 
selection with possible condition or breakage effects. Ant colony presence was 
independent of condition class in snags for the 122 snags "el2.7 ern dbh (X- = 1.413, P = 
0.493). It was also independent of bole breakage among the same snags (X- < 0.001, P = 
0.990). 
DISCUSSION 
Pine snag densities at Mt. Trumbull were well below the density 
recommendations ofboth Cunningham et al. (1980) and the USFS. They were also 
somewhat lower than those reported in Ganey (1999). Many of the smaller snags in the 
five Mt. Trumbull plots likely represent competition-induced mortality, as the dense 
reproduction that followed settlement activities here and elsewhere in the southwest 
(Covington et a1.1997) passes through the stem exclusion stage of stand development 
(Oliver and Larson 1996). The lack of a relationship between total snag density and the 
density oflarge snags suggests that distributions could neither be characterized as a 
consistent large snag population surrounded by a variable population of small snags, nor 
as large snags making up a consistent proportion of the population.

t 
Both Ganey (1999) and Boucher et al. (1999) found that older condition classes 
dominated the snag populations of southwestern ponderosa pine forests. At Mt. 
Trumbull, I found the opposite to be the case, with "recent" snags being the most 
common and "loose-bark" snags being least common (Table 1.4). Among larger snags, 
however, the "recent" condition was the least common. Most recent snags were small. 
Smaller snags do not stand as long as larger snags (Thomas et al. 1979), and so are less 
likely to reach the more advanced stages of decay before falling. The dominance of older 
snags among the large snag population is not strong, but is consistent with others' 
findings. 
Over half of all snags at Mt. Trumbull have been used by wildlife at some time. 
This is likely a very conservative estimate of the actual number. Some signs of wildlife 
use were probably missed and not recorded. Other signs have probably disappeared as 
bark sloughed off and boles broke. Less obvious use of snags, such as foraging by bark 
gleaners, nesting by secondary cavity nesters, and use by insects other than ants were not 
recorded but certainly took place. 
Nearest neighbor distances did not appear to be important in the selection of snags 
used for foraging or nesting, and height did not appear to be related to foraging. 
Diameter was closely related to all three types of wildlife use, but cavities and ants 
displayed a threshold pattern, wherein no snags below a minimum diameter were used, 
and those above that diameter were used in equal proportions. For cavity nests, the 
minimum appeared to be -40 em; for ant colonies, ~2 0 em. Foraging use also showed a 
threshold pattern, with proportional use among snags above 33 em dbh (P = 0.284) at a 
higher rate (43% vs. 28%) than the proportional use (P = 0.250) among snags below 33

em. The apparent relationships between ant colonies and height and nearest neighbor 
distance were artifacts of those variables' relationships to diameter, but height remained 
important in cavity presence even after diameter was accounted for. Diameter was the 
only important factor in wildlife use by foraging birds and ants, even after condition class 
and bole breakage were considered for ants. Diameter and height were both important in 
cavity presence. This is consistent with earlier literature (Scott 1978, Thomas et al. 1979, 
Cunningham et al. 1980). Ant colonies in larger diameter snags may also be better 
insulated from weather and protected from predators, and so be more likely to survive. 
Cunningham et al.'s (1980) and the USFS snag density recommendations and size 
criteria are built around the requirements of cavity-nesting birds. I found that 
Cunningham et al.'s size criteria to be more appropriate at Mt. Trumbull. About 17% of 
all pine snags at Mt. Trumbull bore excavated cavities (95% C1: 9.2 to 24.9%)(Table 
1.5). The proportion of cavities in trees meeting Cunningham et al.'s (1980) size criteria 
was 11 to 37%higher (95% C1, P = 0.007, paired t-test) than the proportion in the general 
population, but the proportion of cavities in trees meeting the USFS size criteria was not 
significantly higher than for the Cunningham et al. criteria (P = 0.051). Over 90% of 
cavity-bearing snags met Cunningham et al. 's size criteria, while nearly a third (32%) of 
them were smaller than the USFS size standards. 
The fact that 90% of cavity-bearing trees met Cunningham et al.'s (1980) size 
criteria suggests that these criteria are appropriate for nesting birds at Mt. Trumbull. The 
minimum cavity-bearing tree diameter was 42.6cm, so an even higher diameter standard 
may also be appropriate. Almost a third of cavity-bearing trees did not fit the USFS 
criteria, not because of small diameter but because of insufficient height. Over two-thirds 
35  

(67.7%) of cavity-bearing trees have broken tops, compared to 51.1% of the snag 
population generally, and to only 44.2% of trees meeting USFS size criteria. All but one 
of the cavity-bearing snags that met Cunningham et al.' s criteria but failed to also meet 
USFS criteria lacked only height. 
MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS 
The Mt. Trumbull snag resource is understocked, according to two important 
standards of appropriate snag density. In future management prescriptions, efforts should 
be made to preserve all snags, especially large ones, and consideration should be given to 
snag creation. Though small snags are less important to wildlife than large ones, they 
currently make up the majority of the population and should be retained whenever 
possible. 
Boucher et al. (1999) and Ganey (1999) both suggested that USFS guidelines for 
snag retention were unrealistic, particularly in the presence of a frequent fire regime such 
as that believed to have existed prior to settlement and prescribed as part of future 
ecosystem restoration efforts. Good conservation practice demands prudence, which 
would advocate erring on the side of snag preservation, even if we believe that the current 
densities are above that found in the natural forest (Ganey 1999). Prescribed fires are 
known to destroy snags, particularly when unprotected (Gaines et al. 1958, Horton and 
Mannan 1988, Gordon 1996, Laudenslayer 2002), so there is considrable risk of 
reducing the snag resource when fire is reintroduced into an ecosystem. With the heavy 
fuel loading in current ponderosa pine forests, it is advisable to rake duff away from the 
bases of any snags in areas prescribed for restoration or other fire-oriented treatments.

CHAPTER 4 
CHANGES IN THE STANDING DEADWOOD RESOURCE FOLLOWING 
RESTORATION OF A PONDEROSA PINE FOREST IN 
NORTHERN ARIZONA 
Abstract: Snags provide habitat structures for many vertebrate and invertebrate 
species in northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests. Living trees bearing deadwood 
components ("partial snags") such as lightning scars and spike tops also provide wildlife 
use opportunities. The effects of ecosystem restoration treatments on the standing 
deadwood resource (snag and partial snags) have not previously been studied. I 
inventoried snags and partial snags before and after restoration treatments at Mt. 
Trumbull, Arizona to assess changes in standing deadwood quantity, quality, and use by 
wildlife. Plots treated for forest restoration experienced a rate of pine and oak snag loss 
five times that in untreated controls. New snag creation in both treated and control plots 
exceeded loss, with treated plots netting a 60 - 1714% increase in pine snag density and 
69% increase in oak snag density to the controls' 12 -33% increase in pine and 13% 
increase in oak. After treatment, treated plot snag populations of both species were 
skewed toward recent snags. Pine partial snags in treatment plots were as likely to die or 
be destroyed in those in controls. Oak partial snags in treatment plots died at 2.5 times 
the rate of control plots, and were destroyed at 9 times the rate of controls. Snags and 
partial snags used by wildlife were destroyed at higher rates in treatment than control 
plots. Densities of cavity-bearing and ant-infested trees in treatments experienced little 
net change, while the density of trees bearing foraging evidence quadrupled. Many of the 
45 
" "1 

large snags created in treatment areas resulted from unexpectedly intense prescribed fires. 
Future restoration treatments may show much lower levels of snag recruitment than 
observed at Mt. Trumbull. 
INTRODUCTION 
Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum) and Gambel oak (Quercus 
gambelii) snags are important to many southwestem forest wildlife species for a variety 
of uses (Scott and Patton 1975, Davis 1983), including foraging (Raphael and White 
1984, Morrison et al. 1987), roosting (Sydeman and Guntert 1983, Rabe et al. 1998), 
display, communication and other uses (Miller and Miller 1980, Davis 1983). 
Cunningham et al. (1990) found a significant positive correlation between snag density 
and cavity-nesting bird populations. Both birds and bats disproportionately select larger 
snags for nesting and roosting (Scott 1978, Cunningham et al. 1980, Rabe et al. 1998). 
Thomas et al. (1979) recommended that a larger snag could always be substituted for a 
smaller one in management decisions, although smaller snags are often used for foraging 
(Horton and Mannan 1988), and smaller deciduous species are often strongly selected 
(Thomas et al. 1979). Soft, particularly heart-rotten, snags with loose bark clinging to the 
bole are heavily used for nesting, roosting and foraging (Thomas et al. 1979, 
Cunningham et al. 1980, Miller and Miller 1980, Raphael and White 1984, Rabe et al. 
1998), but Neitro et al. (1985) recommended that managed forests should have snags of a 
variety of decay states, with enough young snags to provide for future old snags. 
Partial snags (living trees with dead wood components like lightning scars, spike 
tops, and other wounds) are potentially also an important source of standing dead wood 
46  

for wildlife (Mast et al. 1999). Wildlife use of partial snags has been recorded in a 
number of studies (Scott et al. 1978, Cunningham et a1. 1980, Raphael and White 1984, 
Li and Martin 1991, Rabe et al. 1998), and the role of partial snags as recruitment pools 
for future snags is likely also important (Miller and Miller 1980, Mast et al. 1999). Mast 
et a1. (1999), Boucher et al. (1999) and Ganey (1999) have suggested that partial snags 
might have had an important role to play in the pre-settlement forest, where fully dead 
trees (hereafter, "snags") may have been less common due to the frequent fire regime. 
As frequent fire regimes are reintroduced to southwestern forests through restoration and 
other fuel-reduction treatments, partial snags may again take on a prominent role. 
Fire and forest treatments can change both the numbers and the qualities of snags 
and partial snags present in a stand. Horton and Mannan (1988) found a net decrease in 
snag abundance following prescribed fire in the Coronado National Forest. They also 
found that larger and more decayed snags were more likely to be destroyed than younger 
and smaller ones. They attributed this to the larger accumulation of litter and debris at 
the bases of the former type. Gordon (1996) also found that basal fuel depths were a 
strong predictor of snag destruction. New snags in both Horton and Mannan's (1988) 
and Gordon's (1996) studies were disproportionately ofsmaller size classes, likely 
because smaller trees are less fire resistant than mature ones (Reinhardt and Ryan 1988). 
Because cavity nesting bird populations are closely associated with the density of large 
(>46cm) snags (Cunningham et a1. 1980), a disproportionate loss of large snags followed 
by disproportionate gain of small snags is likely to be important to wildlife. 
Restoration treatments, consisting of small-tree thinning followed by prescribed 
surface fire, are being employed throughout the southwestern ponderosa pine-Garnbel 
47  

oak type to restore ecosystem structure and function and to ameliorate fire and disease 
risks resulting from overstocking (Covington et al. 1997, Lynch et al. 2000). Restoration 
treatments have the potential to greatly alter the snag resource, as old snags are burned 
up, cut down (for safety reasons), or blown over after exposure to wind, while new snags 
are created by fire mortality. 
Restoration treatments differ from the prescribed bums in Horton and Mannan' s 
(1988) and Gordon's (1996) studies in a number of respects. First, small pine trees are 
dramatically thinned (approximately 85% reduction - Waltz et al. in review), leaving 
fewer small trees from which snags may be recruited. Secondly, efforts are made to 
protect large, old-growth pine (>37.5cm dbh, or displaying the yellow, plated bark of 
maturity) by thinning around them and raking away litter and duff accumulations at their 
bases (Covington et al. 1997). Lastly, large snags are retained whenever possible during 
thinning and many of these also receive duff-raking to protect them from flames. 
Gambel oak snags and partial snags, which are also used by cavity-nesting birds 
and other wildlife (Leidolf et al. 2000), have received less attention in the literature than 
the larger pine snags, but are also likely to be affected by treatments. Oak are not 
explicitly thinned in restoration treatments (though some are cut to expedite operations), 
but are much more susceptible to fire mortality than pine, as they lack thick, protective 
bark. The effects of fire on oak snags have not yet been explored . 
I tagged, measured, and recorded wildlife use ofponderosa pine and Gambel oak 
snags and partial snags on four restored and three control plots at Mt. Trumbull, northern 
Arizona before and after restoration treatments. My objective was to record the 
quantitative and qualitative changes in the standing dead wood resource (snags and 
48 
~---------------------------------------------­

I 
.~. 
partial snags) resulting from restoration treatments. Changes resulted from standing 
deadwood loss and recruitment. I hypothesized that loss would exceed recruitment in 
treated areas , with larger and older (in time since death) snags more susceptible to 
destruction than smaller and younger ones. Such results would be consistent with 
previous literature (Horton and Mannan 1988, Gordon 1996, Laudenslayer 2002). I 
further hypothesized that partial snags would be more resistant to destruction than full 
snags, because they maintain a protective layer of bark. I predicted that recruitment 
would be dominated by small-sized trees, though less so than in previous studies because 
of the reduced small tree recruitment pool available after thinning operations that is 
typical of restoration. .New partial snags in treatment areas were not expected to make up 
for losses of old ones, since restoration activities include no mechanism capable of 
creating spike tops or lightning scars. Post-restoration plots were expected to have 
relatively lower standing deadwood density and size, and to have reduced density of older 
condition snags. I anticipated a net loss of cavity-bearing and ant colony-bearing trees, 
but expected a net gain of trees displaying evidence of use for foraging, with new snags 
being scaled for insect larvae. 
METHODS 
Study area 
The study area for this project was located between Mt. Trumbull and Mt. Logan, 
north of the Colorado River in Arizona, 36° 22' N, 113°7' W, within the Grand Canyon-
Parashant National Monument. Elevation ranged from about 2000 to 2300m, on volcanic-
derived soils. Precipitation fell mostly in winter and in Monsoon season (July­
49 

September) thunder storms, averaging 50.5cm annually (1977-1997). Precipitation 
during the years of the study (1998 - 2002) was 56, 28, 36, 33, and 19 ern, respectively. 
Vegetation was dominated by ponderosa pine and Gambel oak, with some Utah juniper 
Uuniperus osteosperma), Colorado pinyon (Pinus edulis), and New Mexican locust 
(Robinia neomexicana). The area experienced frequent surface fires prior to 1870, when 
grazing, logging, and fire suppression altered the natural structure and disturbance 
regime, leading to the pathological tree densities and high fuel levels now typical of 
southwestern forests (Moore et al. 1999). 
Four experimental blocks ("EB's" 1 - 4), each consisting of two separate units 
(control: C and treatment: T) of approximately 7 ha each, were established in 1997, 
representing the range of elevations and forest structures at the Mt. Trumbull site (Table 
2.1). Twenty permanent points (plot centers for another study) were established in each 
unit, at 60 by 60m spacing, and permanently marked with steel rebar stakes driven into 
the ground (Fule et al. 2001). Standing deadwood inventory plots were established by the 
polygons formed from connecting the outermost points in each unit. Plot sizes ranged 
from 2.88 to 5.04 ha. Control-treatment plot pairs in each block were separated by a 
buffer of approximately 100 m. 
Initial inventory 
Within each plot, all standing dead trees greater than 10 em in diameter breast 
height (dbh) and 1.8 m in total height were defined as snags. These limits are the 
smallest dimensions reported (Thomas et al. 1979) for nest trees of any species found in 
the area (the mountain chickadee, Poecile gambeli). In the summers of 1998 (EB 1, EB 
50  
m5 

2, EB 3T) and 1999 (EB 3C, EB 4), I marked all snags within the eight plots with 
uniquely-numbered aluminum tags and recorded measurements for each. I also marked 
and measured all partial snags bearing deadwood of equal or greater dimensions (1.8 m 
height or length X 10 em diameter or width) in spike tops, lightning scars, or other 
substantial wounds. In EB4, I marked and measured only pines. For each tree I recorded 
species, dbh using a steel metric diameter tape, polar coordinate location from the nearest 
grid point using a hand compass and metric tape measure, wildlife use (excavated 
cavities, evidence of woodpecker foraging on the bole, and ants) and condition (classes 3­
5, following Thomas et al. 1979, where 3 = "recent" 4 = "loose bark" 5 = "clean"). 
Thomas's condition class 6, "broken above breast height," was not recorded as a separate 
class, as it is probably unrelated to fire resistance or age (Waskiewicz and Fu16, in 
review). I recorded wildlife use as presence or absence for three types of use: excavated 
cavities, foraging evidence, and ant colonies. Excavated cavities in this area are most 
likely to be created by the hairy woodpecker iPicoides villosus), northern flicker 
(Colaptes auratus), or pygmy nuthatch (Sitta pygmaea) although acorn woodpeckers 
(Melanerpesformicavorus) and Williamson's sapsuckers iSphyrapicus thyroideus] also 
inhabit the study area and construct cavity nests (Scott and Patton 1975). Excavated 
cavities are distinguished from natural holes by a round or oval shape with smooth edges. 
Foraging evidence was defined as scaling of bark or drilling into the surface of a tree 
bole, an activity likely to be engaged in primarily by hairy woodpecker seeking bark 
beetles (Scolytidae) or wood borers (Buprestida e)(Otvos and Stark 1985). Ants 
(Formicada e) inhabit many snags, logs, and live trees on the study site. Their presence 
was determined by observing aggressive defense behavior while trees were being tagged 
51  

and measured. The same information was taken for partial snags, with condition values 
assigned to dead portions alone. Lightning scars and other wounds were noted; spikes 
were described in tenus of base and top height using a clinometer. 
Treatments 
Thinning of treatment units took place in 1999. All pine displaying the reddish-
yellow, plated bark characteristic of mature trees ("pre-settlement" trees) were retained. 
For each snag, log, or stump encountered, three replacement trees within a 10 to 20m 
radius were also retained (Fule et a1. 2001, Waltz et a1. in review). Deciduous species 
were not thinned. Slash was lopped and scattered. Litter and duff were raked back 0.3 to 
1m from the boles of old-growth pine and large pine snags. Prescribed burns were 
conducted in the fall of 1999 and spring of 2000 (Fule et a1. 2001). In EB 4, there was 
more logging slash than expected and more trees were left standing than prescribed. As a 
result, the prescribed burn caused high mortality (Waltz et a1. in review). In EB 3, fires 
escaped control lines and burned through the adjacent control area, rendering it 
unacceptable for its original purpose. No results are therefore reported here for EB 3C. 
Re-measurement 
In 200 I, I relocated all snags and partial snags, or their remains, and recorded 
their new condition. During the re-measurement, I sought to avoid bias in classification 
by not looking at the previous inventory's designations for each tree. Snags that no 
longer met the minimum qualifications for measurement were considered "destroyed." I 
coded destroyed snags with a modified version of Thomas' (1979) conditions: "broken 
above bh, but below 1.8 m", "broken below bh", "downed," taken to mean tipped out by 
52  

the roots, rather than broken off low to the ground, "cut stump" and "stump hole," which 
remained after complete consumption of the wood by fire. For some snags, no trace 
remained, and their loss was also recorded. Many broken snags in treatment areas 
actually burned off, and it is possible that snags re-classified as stump holes were initially 
destroyed by another means before fire consumed their remains. 
In 2002 (allowing another year for latent mortality and injury to manifest - Swezy 
and Agee 1991), I collected data on new recruits to the snag and partial snag populations, 
recording the same information as in 1998 and 1999 for trees that died (or partially died) 
in the interim period. There were so many new pine snags in EB4 that I could not tag 
and measure all of them, so I consulted sample data collected from 0.04 ha plots laid out 
at the permanent grid points placed in each plot (for another study - Waltz et al. in 
review) to estimate their quantity and qualities, but not their use. 
Data analysis 
Each snag was classified as destroyed (present in 1998/9, gone in 2001), created 
(present in 2002, not present in 1998/9) or surviving (present in 1998/9, still present in 
2001). I created 90% confidence intervals for the number per ha and percent of destroyed 
snags, the number of created snags per ha, and the post -treatment number per ha and 
percent net change of snag numbers in control (3) and treatment (4) plots . Paired­
samples t-tests were used to compare destruction of large (~7.5 em dbh) and small pine 
snags in treatments and in control areas separately. Since diameter and destruction 
seemed to be related in treatment units, I built a logistic regression model of probability 
of destruction based on diameter.

I used an independent samples t-test (n = 4) to compare the percent destruction of 
pine full snags to that of partial snags within treatment units (a = 0.10). Partial pine 
snags were on the whole rather uncommon, so I pooled their numbers within C and 
within T, and reported changes in their density without statistical comparison. The same 
was done for trees used by wildlife, because they were also uncommon. Oak snags and 
oak partial snags were common only in EB 2, so all comparisons of change in the oak 
snag and partial snag resource were based on that block alone. 
RESULTS 
Snag and partial snag fates following treatment 
In control units, 14.5% (90% CI: 5.8 - 23.1%) of the original pine snags were 
destroyed between the initial inventory (1998 and 1999) and the re-measurement (2001). 
Over the same time period, treatment units lost 76.2% (90% CI: 46.8-105.5%, N = 4) of 
their original snags (Table 2.2). In control units , all (100% of 8) of the pine snags that 
were destroyed were lost to falling. In treatment units, a plurality of the pine snags was 
lost to burning (35% of 60). Other large proportions were lost to cutting (28.3 %) or 
without a trace (21.7%)(Table 2.3) . 
Pine snags "?:.37.5 em dbh had lower rates of destruction than smaller snags in 
both treatment (59% versus 95%) and in control units (6% versus 19%), but the 
difference was statistically significant only in treatment units (p = 0.088). In treatment 
units, 37 of 60 destroyed snags were smaller than the median diameter; the probability of 
this occurring if destruction is random with respect to diameter is 0.050 (distribution-free 
exact test described in Chapter 3). In control units, 6 of 8 destroyed snags were smaller 
54  

than the median diameter (P = 0.145). When cut snags were eliminated from analysis in 
treatment areas, 23 of 43 destroyed snags were larger than the median diameter (P = 
0.40) ; large snags in treatment units had a higher rate of survival only because they were 
less likely to be cut down. Cut snags do represent a real loss, even if unintended, so they 
were not excluded from further analysis of snag destruction. 
Pine snags in more advanced condition classes in control units appeared to be lost 
in lower proportions than those in lower condition classes, but the effect is inconclusive 
since only 8 such snags were destroyed in all. (Table 2.4). In treatment units, condition 
class had a less obvious impact on fate, and the outcome varied by size class. In 
treatment units , 80 to 100% of small pine snags were destroyed following treatment, 
independent of condition class. Large loose bark and clean pine snags were destroyed in 
higher proportions than large recent snags (X- = 3.34 , P = 0.068). 
Because 92% (of 59) of pine partial snags were large (;:87.5 em dbh), my 
analysis excluded the five partial snags small enough to have been cut down as part of 
thinning operations. On average, 8% of large partial snags in treatment areas were 
destroyed (no longer standing) following treatments (90% CI: -4 - 21%, N = 4). This is a 
significantly lower rate of destruction than the 60% rate for large pine snags (P = 0.009), 
but did not differ from the 0% destruction rate for partial snags in control units. Some 
partial snags that were not destroyed were killed but remained standing, adding to the 
snag population. In treatment units, 23% (of35) of the original partial snags became full 
snags (90% CI: -3 - 48%); in controls, 5% (1 of 19) died and remained standing. 
Oak snags were too rare to analyze in any unit except in EB 2. There, 43.2% (of 
289) of the original oak snags were destroyed by 2001 in the treatment unit; in the control 
55  
..:t ~ . 
l 

unit, only 8.1% (of 219) were lost. Cutting accounted for 72.2% (of 18) of the oak snag 
destruction in the control. Non-anthropogenic losses were divided between breakage and 
falling (11.1 and 16.7%, respectively). In the treatment unit, 50.4% (of 125) of oak snag 
losses were due to bole breakage. Most of these broken boles resulted as flames burned 
most of the way through the base, leaving insufficient supporting wood though logging 
equipment broke some off. Falling claimed 18.4% ofoak snags, 24.0% left no trace 
(most of these were probably completely consumed by fire and left no visible stump hole; 
some were obliterated by skid trails), 4.0% were cut, and 4.8% were incinerated. 
In EB 2C, 15 of the 18 destroyed oak snags were larger than the median oak snag 
•
diameter (P = 0.004). When the 13 cut snags are excluded from analysis, however, only 
4 of 5 are larger than the median diameter (p = 0.188), so the apparent relationship 
between size and destruction probably reflects the preferences ofa woodcutter, rather 
than any natural proclivity. There was no tendency for destroyed oak snags in the 
treatment unit to be larger or smaller than the median, even when cut snags were 
excluded. There was also no apparent difference in proportions of oak snags destroyed in 
each of the three condition classes, in either control or treatment units. 
In EB 2C, 15.3% (of 137) oak partial snags died between 1998 and 2001, and 
1.5% were destroyed (all cut illegally). In the treatment unit, 39.4% (of99) oak partial 
snags were killed, and 13.1% were destroyed. Because oak partial snags were much 
smaller than pine partial snags, and because there were only 7 large (>37.5cm dbh) oak 
partial snags, these rates are not directly comparable to those for pine partial snags.

Snag and partial snag recruitment 
Control plots gained, on average, 1.8 new pine snags per ha, while treatment plots 
gained 13.5 per ha (Table 2.5). In control areas, new pine snags averaged slightly smaller 
in diameter than those present prior to treatment (90% CI for mean difference: 0.9 ­
11.1em, P = 0.084). In treatment units there was no difference in diameter between new 
and old pine snags. Ofthe new pine snags, 94% (17 of 18) in control units, and 99% 
(153 of 154) in treatment units were of recent condition - the other two snags were 
classed as loose bark . 
Very few pine partial snags were created between 1998 and 2002. No data were 
available for new partial pine snags in EB 4, but EBs 1 through 3 gained only 5 new pine 
partial snags on treatment and control plots combined, and one of these was < 37.5 em 
dbh. There appeared to be no tendency for more pine partial snags to be created in 
treatments than controls (2 new in treatment, 3 new in control) . 
EB 2C gained 11.9 oak snags per ha, while EB 2T gained 90.0 per ha. New oak 
snags in the control were approximately the same size as those present in 1998, but new 
oak snags in the treatment unit were larger (90% CI for difference: 1.5 - 2.7 em, P < 
0.001), averaging 15.2 em dbh. As expected, almost all new oak snags in EB 2 were of 
recent condition (94% in C, 90% in T). The remaining oak snag recruits were in the 
loose bark class, except for a single snag in the treatment unit that was clean. 
Fifty-four new oak partial snags were created in treatment and control units ofEB 
2. In 2002, there were 7.1 new partial oak snags per ha in EB 2C, and 7.2 new partial oak 
snags per ha in EB 2T. 
57  

r 
Net changes in the standing dead wood resource 
Between the pre-treatment inventory and 2002, both treatment and control units 
experienced a net gain in total pine snag density (Table 2.6). On average, control units 
had 1.7 more pine snags per ha in 2002 than at initial inventory, and treatment units had 
7.8 more per ha. In 2002, I detected no change in average pine snag size (P > 0.10) since 
initial inventory. 
Net numbers ofrecent and loose bark snags increased over 25% in control areas 
and clean snag numbers decreased trivially (Table 2.7), causing a shift toward fresher 
snag condition classes. Increases in snag number were not expected in control areas, but 
probably resulted from drought conditions in 2000 and 2002. In treatment units, loose 
bark and clean snags both decreased by about 67%, while recent snag numbers almost 
quadrupled (Table 2.7). As a result, the post-treatment distribution of snag classes in 
treatment areas was skewed toward younger classes, with 92% of post treatment pine 
snags classified as recent (Table 2.7) . 
Pine partial snag numbers decreased in 2 of 3 treatment units (by 1 in EB 2 and by 
8 in EB 3; no post-treatment partial snag data are available for EB 4), and increased in 2 
of 3 control areas (EB IT by one tree and EB 2C by one) . Numbers for net change in 
partial snag numbers are too low to draw any statistically valid conclusions. 
Oak snag numbers increased by 13.2% (to 62.6 per ha) in the EB 2C, and by 
68.9% (to 135.6 per ha) in EB 2T. Average oak snag diameters remained unchanged in 
the control unit, but increased by 1.2 em in the treatment unit. In the control unit, recent 
and loose bark oak snag numbers increased by about 20%, but clean oak snag numbers 
decreased by 55% (Table 2.8) . The decrease in clean oak snag numbers was not caused 
58  

by the loss of any of the 22 clean oak snags. Instead, 12 snags on the borderline ofthe 
class definitions (having very small amounts of bark remaining) were re-assigned to the 
loose-bark class in the re-measurement (during the re-measurement, I sought to avoid 
bias in classification by not looking at the previous inventory's designations for each 
tree), and no new snags advanced into the clean category. Only one loose bark snag was 
reclassified as recent. In the treatment unit, loose bark and clean snag numbers decreased 
by 22% and 7% (respectively), while recent oak snag numbers increased by 288% (Table 
2.8). Numbers of oak partial snags increased by a net 3.6% (to 142) in the EB 2 control 
unit, but decreased by a net 26.3% (to 73) in the treatment unit. 
Changes in wildlife use of standing dead wood 
Snags and partial snags bearing signs of wildlife use were subjected to the same 
destructive forces as other trees - no special effort was made to preserve wildlife trees 
during treatment. Loss of wildlife trees occurred when previously used trees were 
destroyed or ceased to show evidence of use. For all three types of wildlife use, loss 
tended to be higher, as a proportion of initial number, in treatment than in control plots 
(Table 2.9). New wildlife use was recorded in surviving snags and partial snags, and in 
newly created snags (recruited both from formerly pristine live trees and from former 
partial snags) and new partial snags. New cavity trees were created at about the same 
density in both control and treatment units, and both treatments and controls experienced 
a small net loss of cavity trees. New forage trees were created at five times the density in 
treatment than control areas . Control units netted an 12% increase in forage tree 
numbers, while treatment units gained a net 392% increase (Table 2.9). New ant 
59  

infestations occurred in 3.5 trees per ha in control units, but only in 2.2 per ha in 
treatment areas. There was a 43% net gain in ant infested tree numbers in control units, 
while treatment units experienced a 9% loss. 
DISCUSSION 
Snag and partial snag fates 
Restoration treatments may cause the destruction of snags through mechanical 
damage during harvesting operations (knocked over or broken offby equipment), cutting 
for safety reasons or by accident (misidentification of a snag as a live tree scheduled for 
removal), burning by prescribed fire, or windthrow following live tree density reduction 
(Lyon 1977). In control areas, pine snags were lost to falling. Several snags and partial 
snags in one clump of oak in EB2C were harvested by a woodcutter, accounting for much 
of the oak snag loss in the control. 
In treatment areas, snags over 37.5cm dbh were less likely to be destroyed. This 
contrasts with Horton and Mannan's (1988) results, in which larger snags were more 
susceptible to destruction, but smaller pine snags in restoration treatments were often cut 
down (though this is not called for in the prescription), inflating small snag rates of loss 
compared to the effects of fire alone. In addition to their greater resistance to decay 
{Thomas et al. 1979), large pine snags under restoration treatment practices were much 
less likely to be cut, and many were granted a fuelbreak at their base, which is known to 
improve survival during prescribed fire (Gordon 1996, Boucher et al. 1999). Like Horton 
and Mannan (1988), I did find a relationship between destruction and condition in large 
pines, with recent snags less likely to be destroyed than loose-bark or clean snags. 
60  

Though treatments may certainly kill or destroy partial snags through many of the 
same means as for snags, treatment apparently did not have an effect on pine partial snag 
destruction (with only 8% destroyed in treatments and 0% in controls) nor on the fate of 
those that did not survive. It is possible that the sample sizes in this case were simply too 
small, disguising a real effect in pines that did show up in oak. On the other hand, pine 
are much more fire resistant than oak, so it is quite possible that a treatment effect on 
partial snags exists only for oak. 
Following treatment, partial snags of both species were more likely to remain 
standing (even if dead) than full snags, suggesting that they may play an important role in 
providing habitat where frequent fire precludes the long-term maintenance ofsnag 
populations (Ganey 1999, Boucher et al. 1999). The importance of partial snags in 
restored forests is also suggested by their abundance in relict sites (Chapter 5). 
Snag and Dartial snag recruitment 
New snags are created when trees are killed by lightning, insect attack, drought, 
disease, competition, fire, or some other cause. Often causes of death are not readily 
apparent, and they were not recorded in this study. More snags were recruited than lost 
in both treatment and control years between 1998 and 2002. The years following 1998 
all experienced below average precipitation, with precipitation for 1999 just over half and 
precipitation for 2002 just over a third the previous two-decades' average. Drought likely 
contributed to mortality in both treatment and control areas. 
In treatment areas, average snag recruitment per ha was 7.6 times that in controls 
(Table 2.5). This result may not be typical for restoration projects, because of 
61 

abnormally high recruitment in EBs 1T and 4T. Treatment did not follow prescription in 
EB 4 T, resulting in high mortality, especially among pole-sized trees (Waltz et al. in 
review). In EB 1, unusually shallow soil conditions resulted in high mortality via root­
killing of large-diameter trees (Fule et al. 2002). Although EB 1T and 4T make up a 
small proportion of the total area subject to restoration at Mt. Trumbull (~1 0%), these 
plots make up 50% of the treatment sample, so their influence is magnified, exaggerating 
the apparent snag recruitment (Fule et al. 2002). 
Horton and Mannan (1988) and Gordon (1996) found that most new snags 
recruited by prescribed fire were of small size. I found no size difference between 
created and original pine snags within treatment units, while in controls, new snags 
tended to be smaller than average. New oak snags were larger than originals in the 
treatment unit. My results are likely due to the heavy thinning of small trees prior to 
burning; this reduced the small-tree pool of potential pine snag recruits. For oaks, which 
were not mechanically thinned, the resulting size difference may be due to the small 
sample size (1 plot). 
Few partial snags of either species were created, and creation was unrelated to 
treatment or control plot designation. Elements that create partial snags are largely 
stochastic events unrelated to treatment. Though fire may have the potential to create 
dead streaks and other wounds (Gaines et al. 195'8), it did not appear to do so at Mt. 
Trumbull, unless such wounds require more time to.become visible. 
62  

Net changes in the standing dead wood resource 
The net effects of restoration treatment on the snag resource were increased pine 
and oak (EB2) snag density, with no significant change in mean diameter ofpine snags 
and an increase in diameter of oak snags. 
Nearly all new snags created following treatments were of recent condition, 
though some «10%) lost some to all of their bark in the process of being killed and were 
classified as class loose-bark or clean. The large influx of fresh snags, combined with the 
large losses of loose-bark and clean snags, increased the relative representation of recent 
snags in treatment areas; in controls, recent snags also increased compared to other 
classes, although less so. 
Restoration treatments did not seem to have a net adverse effect on any measures 
of wildlife use of snags. In pre-treatment measurements, the presence of a cavity or 
foraging sign in a snag only indicates that it was used at some time, possibly years ago. 
An unknown fraction of the cavity or forage trees recorded prior to treatment were in 
active use during the pre-treatment inventory. After treatment, new cavities and foraging 
sign necessarily represent recent activity. Because I re-measured original snags in 2001, 
but inventoried only new recruits in 2002, any use of original snags occurring between 
2001 and 2002 was not recorded. Wildlife use following treatment is therefore probably 
underestimated. The large increase in trees bearing foraging evidence may reflect an 
increase in hairy woodpecker activity and numbers at Mt. Trumbull since treatment (J. 
Battin, personal communication). The stability of excavated cavity numbers and the 
relatively high density of new holes in treatment units indicates that woodpecker breeding 
was not adversely affected by treatment. This is consistent with the findings of Koplin 
63  

T 
(1969) and Lowe et al. (1978), that drilling species (including the HAWO) briefly 
increased in numbers, then leveled off following fires. 
Ant use of snags increased in control units, suggesting an increase in ant 
populations. I cannot, however, exclude the possibility that infestations recorded in new 
snags also existed when the trees were alive, nor can I suggest a plausible cause for an 
increase in ants in the control units. The net decrease in snags infested by ants in the 
treatment areas was surprisingly slight, given that> 75% of the original ant-bearing snags 
were lost following treatment. Establishment of new ant colonies (per ha) in treatment 
areas was lower than that in controls, but still nearly offset the loss of snags that had been 
used by ants before treatment. Established ant colonies act as points of dispersal from 
which queens establish new colonies (Ross 1948). In control units, 1.5 new colonies 
were added for each 1 original colony remaining in 2001. In treatment units, the ratio 
was 2.9:1. It is unknown whether new ant colonies established in the treatment units are 
established from founding colonies inside or outside the units, but either way, snags in 
treatment units were likely in proximity to fewer potential colonization points than snags 
in control units. This suggests a greater success rate for ant colony establishment in 
treatment units, perhaps due to the increase in suitable substrates (more snags). Without 
data on ant colonies in logs, however, any analysis of ant use of deadwood is incomplete. 
MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH 
The results of this study suggest that initial restoration treatments do not have 
negative impacts on the standing deadwood resource or its use by wildlife. However, this 
64  

statement must be interpreted with caution for several reasons. First, the disproportionate 
destruction of large snags in conditions classes above 3 is important. Large snags in the 
loose bark condition are particularly value to wildlife (Cunningham et al. 1980, Rabe et 
al. 1998), so the full impact of treatments will depend partly on how rapidly the new, 
recent condition recruits advance in deterioration and make up for the loss ofloose bark 
snags. A second caveat is that the mortality (snag recruitment) of large pines during 
treatment was not desired nor expected at such high levels. The snag recruitment which 
compensated for snag loss in treatment areas does not represent intended results, and 
should not be typical in future restoration treatments, especially in non-drought 
conditions and on non-lava rock soils (Fule et al. 2002). Finally, this study reflects the 
impact of initial restoration treatments only. Full restoration is a decades-long process, 
which includes continuing periodic prescribed fires intended to mimic a natural fire 
regime. Because of large changes in overstory structure and fuel loading (Fule et al. 
200 1), snag loss and recruitment in future burns may be lower than what I observed. 
The lack of a significant relationship between size and survival (for un-cut snags) 
is likely due to the practice of raking fuel lines around larger snags (Gordon 1996). I 
suggest that this practice be continued in future restoration treatments, perhaps increasing 
the line width to as much as 8m (Gordon 1996) for particularly high-value snags (large , 
loose-bark or cavity-bearing), or snags at high risk of destruction by fire (loose-bark or 
on steep slopes). Snag cutting accounted for over a quarter of snag loss, and nearly half 
the loss of smaller snags. In treatments, cutting probably resulted from workers mis­
identifying snags, especially small ones, as live trees. The largest pine snag destroyed by 
cutting was 22.6 em dbh. Pine snags of such sizes are below the threshold of use by both 
65 
It''?S:i 

r  
ants and cavity-nesting birds (Chapter 3), but are used for foraging. In the interest of 
maintaining the full complement of snags through the initial treatment period, it may be 
worthwhile to identify snags during timber marking to avoid accidental cutting (this is 
currently done only for snags believed to represent pre-settlement trees - general> 37.5 
em dbh). Without better protection of existing snags, future treatments that avoid 
mortality levels of this study will experience a net loss of pine snag density. Oaks were 
not thirmed during treatment and mortality was anticipated; the burn was used to 
accomplish thinning. Duff raking around oak snags should not be necessary, except in 
the case of particularly valuable individuals (>20-30cm dbh, or containing obvious 
cavities or hollows). Thirteen snags and partial snags in EB 2C and an unknown number 
in EB 2T were lost to illegal woodcutting. Efforts should be made in future to reduce this 
factor by placement of signs informing of regulations. 
This study does not address the effects of other thinning, burning or fuels­
reduction treatments on the deadwood resource - only the restoration treatments 
described . Results may also not be applicable on sites with other tree species, soil types 
or topography. For example, Gordon (1996) found greater snag loss on steep slopes than 
gradual ones. 
Though my results suggest that treatments increase bird (most likely hairy 
woodpecker) foraging on snags, this should not be taken to imply that restoration is 
necessarily "good" for hairy woodpeckers. Density can be a misleading indicator of 
habitat quality (VanHorne 1983). For a more comprehensive examination of one cavity 
nesting species (western bluebird) fitness following restoration treatments, see Germaine 
and Germaine (2002).

;q:;--------------------------------------------­

This study has high potential for future research. All snags and partial snags used 
in the study are marked with aluminum tags, and also located relative to permanent grid 
points. Future re-measurements may address how restoration affects snag progression 
through condition classes (increased exposure likely accelerates deterioration, though, 
alternatively, it may cause drying and slowing of decay processes). It will also be 
interesting to examine how snags survive through future maintenance bums, when less 
fuel remains on the ground, how condition and size class proportions change given 
frequent fire and changes in the recruitment pool's characteristics, and how wildlife use 
progresses over time.

QUANTIFYING THE DEADWOOD RESOURCE IN LIVING TREES 
("PARTIAL SNAGS") IN MANAGED AND RELICT PONDEROSA PINE SITES 
OF THE SOUTHWEST 
Abstract: Living trees bearing deadwood components ("partial snags"), such as 
lightning scars and spike tops provide habitat values similar to snags. Pre- settlement era 
frequent-return fire regimes in the Southwest may have limited snag densities in 
ponderosa pine forests, and may present a problem for maintaining snag numbers as 
ecosystem restoration projects are implemented in the future. The contribution of partial 
snags to pre-settlement habitat structure and their potential role in future restored forests 
is unknown. I inventoried one managed and four relict ponderosa pine sites in the 
Southwest to describe partial snag quantity, qualities, and use by cavity-nesting birds, and 
to establish a protocol for future partial snag inventories. Partial snag densities at relict 
sites ranged from 2.13 to 3.18 per ha, with spike-topped trees being the most common 
type. At the managed site, partial snags occurred at 1.70 per ha, and lightning scars were 
most common. At relict sites, 19% of partial snags contained excavated cavities, while at 
the managed site, 42% did. At relict sites, cavities were more likely to occur in partial 
snags with less than median crown-base height, and greater-than-median surface area of 
dead wood, distance to nearest snag and diameter. I developed models for estimating 
surface areas of exposed dead wood in spike-topped and in lightning-scarred trees that do 
not require time-consuming measurements, and suggested a simplified protocol to 
improve efficiency in future partial snag surveys.

INTRODUCTION 
Snags (standing dead trees) are an important component of southwestern 
ponderosa pine forest wildlife habitat (Scott 1978), providing many species of birds and 
mammals, reptiles and invertebrates with food and cover (Thomas et al. 1979, Davis 
1983). The habitat structures provided by snags are not exclusive to dead trees. Live 
trees bearing dead portions, such as dead ("spike") tops, lightning scars, dead limbs and 
other types of wounds and scars are called partial snags or "living snags" (Mast et al. 
1999) and are an understudied but probably important component of forest habitat (Mast 
et al. 1999, Boucher et al. 1999, Ganey 1999). 
Partial snags are used by wildlife for many of the same purposes as snags (Miller 
and Miller 1980). Rabe et al. (1998) noted bats roosting in lightning scars, Raphael and 
White (1984) found 21% of avian cavity nests in live trees, and Li and Martin (1991) 
found 38% in live trees . Miller and Miller (1980) noted that 40% of cavities in six 
studies of cavity nesting birds were located in live trees. 
Lightning damage is common in ponderosa pine forests of the Southwest (Pearson 
1938, Wadsworth 1943). In addition to lightning , partial snags may be created by dwarf 
mistletoe, bark beetles, competition, fungal infection or drought stress. Gaines et al. 
(1958) reported unspecified damage to residual live trees following prescribed bums in 
the fall, suggesting that non-lethal fire damage may also create partial snags. 
Partial snags may be more likely to survive (at least remain standing, ifkilled) 
after a fire than snags because they retain a living layer of insulating bark at the base 
(Chapter 4). Some authors have suggested an important role for partial snags in wildlife

habitat prior to .settlement, when frequent surface fires visited the ponderosa forests and 
are likely to have consumed nearly all full snags (Boucher et al. 1999, Ganey 1999).

"Trees are excavated because of what is going on inside them, not because they 
are dead" (Miller and Miller 1980, p. 340). Partial snags with dead or broken tops 
(Cunningham et al. 1980) may be particularly useful for nesting sites, because the 
introduction of heart rot within a sound shell of sapwood is more likely (Miller and 
Miller 1980) and produces a structure of particular utility (Miller and Miller 1980, 
McClelland and Frissel 1975). 
Partial snags may also have an important role as potential future snags, as they are 
often already under stress (Mast et al. 1999). Snags that were partial snags before their 
complete death may be more valuable than snags that were killed instantly, also because 
of the introduction of heart rots while alive (Miller and Miller 1980). 
Fire suppression, livestock grazing, logging, and unusual climatic conditions have 
caused changes in the structure and function ofmodern southwestern ponderosa pine 
forests (Fule et al. 2002). These changes are characterized by increased small-tree 
density, decreased growth and increased mortality of old trees, decreased herbaceous 
biomass and diversity, replacement of the 2 to 7 year interval low-intensity fire regime 
with infrequent high-intensity fire, and increases in susceptibility to insect, disease and 
drought mortality (Covington and Moore 1994). Scattered across the southwest, there 
remain a few sites that have been sheltered from the usual disturbances by inaccessibility 
or special land use designation (Moore et al. 1999, Fule et al. 2002). These "relict" sites 
are generally uri-logged, often ungrazed, and some have experienced multiple surface 
fires in the last century. Relict sites are often isolated, or otherwise unusual in some 
78 

respect, and often have been altered indirectly by the changes in adjacent lands . However, 
I-
i 
relict sites do retain the full old-growth component, and have not been subjected to direct 
management actions, so they are often used to help designate "reference conditions" 
(Moore et al. 1999, Fule et al. 2002). Reference conditions are the basis for ecosystem 
restoration treatments, which aim to improve ecosystem health by emulating the structure 
and function of pre-settlement era forests (Covington et al. 1997). 
Ifpartial snags were an important part of the pre-settlement forest's structure and 
function, as suggested by Ganey (1999) and Boucher et al. (1999), then they are an 
important consideration in establishing reference conditions for restoration goals. I 
surveyed partial snags on five ponderosa pine sites (one managed and four relict) in 
Arizona and New Mexico. My objectives were to determine the quantities and qualities 
(especially with respect to risk of fire mortality) of partial snags occuring in managed and 
unmanaged forests, and to determine if partial snags used by cavity-nesting birds share 
any common features. To facilitate inclusion of partial snags in assessments of wildlife 
habitat, I developed a protocol to efficiently measure partial snags. 
METHODS 
Study areas 
I conducted partial snag inventories at one managed site (Mt. Trumbull) and four 
relict ponderosa pine-dominated sites in the Southwest: the Gus Pearson Natural Area, 
Fire Point, Galahad Point, and Iron Creek Mesa. The five sites represent a range of fire 
and management histories, and site conditions across the southwestern ponderosa pine 
type (Table 3.1).

The Mt. Trumbull site (MT) lies between Mt. Trumbull and Mt. Logan, north of 
the Colorado river in Arizona, 36 0 22' N, 113 0 10' W, within the Grand Canyon 
Parashant National Monument. The area experienced frequent surface fires prior to 1870, 
when grazing, logging, and fire suppression altered the forest's natural structure and 
disturbance regime, leading to the pathological tree densities and high fuel levels now 
typical of southwestern forests (Moore et al. 1999). Vegetation is dominated by 
ponderosa pine and Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii), with some Utah juniper (Juniperus 
osteosperma), Colorado pinyon (Pinus edulis), and New Mexican locust (Robinia 
neomexicanay. In 1998 and 1999 I established five plots of7.6 to lOA ha, totaling 44.6 
ha. 
The Gus Pearson Natural Area (GPNA) is located about 16 Ian north ofFlagstaff, 
Arizona in the Fort Valley Experimental Forest in the Coconino National Forest, 35
0 16' 
N, 111044' W. Grazing between 1876 and 1910, and fire suppression since 1876 have 
resulted in small tree densities typical of southwestern forests (Covington et al. 1997), but 
the retention of all old-growth trees makes it valuable as a relict site nevertheless. The 
GPNA overstory is dominated by ponderosa pine, with a sparse understory. US route 180 
runs through the middle of the GPNA. The road's pavement and a thinned buffer on 
either side of it account for a total of approximately 3 ha. In 2001, the entire area was 
sampled as one plot of 21 ha, not including the road or its buffer. 
Fire Point (FP) is within National Park boundaries on the northwestern edge of 
the North Rim of the Grand Canyon (36021' N, 112020' W). The site has never been 
logged. FP experienced frequent fires until 1879, then two large surface fires in 1923 and 
1999, with fires in 1926,1931, and 1989 burning over smaller areas of the site (Fule et al. 
80  

2003) . The site is dominated by ponderosa pine, with some New Mexican locust 
occurring in the understory. In 2001, a single plot of27 ha was established and 
inventoried as a rectangle of approximately 300 X 900m (oriented east-west) following 
the flat top of a ridge. 
Ga1ahad Point (GP) is also within National Park boundaries on the North Rim 
(36
0 16' N, 112
0 14' W), and has never been logged. Fires burned GP frequently until 
1879. Since then, several small fires - > 12ha, and most > 3.7ha - burned (Fule et al. in 
press) until 2001, when a surface fire burned across most of the site. The site was 
dominated by ponderosa pine, but quaking aspen (Populus tremuloidesi, Garnbel oak, 
white fir (Abies concolor), and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesiii also occurred. In 
2002, I established and inventoried three square (300 X 300m) plots of 9 ha each, 
approximately 300m apart (to avoid drainages; where other tree species were more 
common and ponderosa pine less so). 
Iron Creek Mesa (lCM) is located at the northeast end of the Gila Wildemess of 
New Mexico, above Snow Lake (33 024' N, 108° 33' W). The area was never logged, 
and has experienced 5 fires since the late 1890 's, most recently in 1993 (Boucher et al. 
1999). An L-shaped (to avoid a meadow) plot of 24 ha was established and inventoried 
in 2002. 
Data collection 
At MT, I defined partial snags to be living pine trees "?37.5 em dbh (diameter 
breast height, 1.37 m above ground on the uphill side of the bole) bearing dead wood of 
dimensions equal to or greater than approximately 1.8 m height by 10 em width in spike 
81  

tops, lightning scars, or other wounds. I chose these dimensions because they are the 
minimum reported size for snags used by any cavity-nesting bird in the area (the 
mountain chickadee, Poecile gambeli) (Thomas et al. 1979). I tagged each partial snag 
with a uniquely-numbered aluminum tag and recorded its measurements. For each, I 
recorded dbh, height, polar coordinate location from the nearest grid point, and type(s) of 
dead wood feature displayed. For spike-topped trees , I recorded the height of the spike 
base and top, and whether it was broken. For lightning scars and other wounds, I 
recorded presence only. For wildlife use, I recorded the presence of excavated cavities, 
but not their number. 
At the four relict sites, I took more detailed data, focused on obtaining three kinds 
of information: the surface area of deadwood available to cavity-nesting birds in live 
trees, variables that might be correlated with nesting use, and variables that might 
influence partial snag fate in a prescribed or low-intensity natural fire. 
I collected data on all partial snags at least 37.5 em in dbh or bearing the yellow­
red colored bark of mature trees (these criteria are commonly used to establish "pre­
settlement" age trees in restoration reconstructions). I ignored smaller partial snags, or 
those of species other than ponderosa pine. I counted and measured spike tops at least 10 
em in diameter at the base and at least 30 em tall (the relaskop was used to check 
questionable trees), and lightning scars that averaged 10 em or more in width . Other 
deadwood features that meet the general requirement of rising at least 1.8 m above 
ground level and having a width of at least 10 em were also measured. Fire scars rising 
at least 1.8 m above ground level and having a width of at least 10 em, and dead limbs at 
least 10 em in diameter and 30 em long were measured only if they occurred on a tree 
82  

bearing other features (otherwise the numbers tallied could have become impractically 
large). 
Each measured tree was assigned a number, but not tagged (those at Gus Pearson 
are already tagged). Except at GPNA, I used a GPS unit to record each tree 's UTM 
coordinates. Because Miller and Miller (1980) suggested that proximity to a snag may be 
a nest selection criteria, I measured the distance from each partial snag to its nearest (full) 
snag neighbor by pacing. I measured height to the nearest 0.5 m with a relaskop and 
recorded lean if < 80 degrees from horizontal using the clinometer on a hand compass. 
measured tree diameters at breast height to the nearest 0.1 em using a steel diameter tape, 
and estimated diameters at Y4, Y2, and % of height to the nearest 1 em using a relaskop 
stabilized on a tripod. All sufficiently sized deadwood features were noted (and measured 
separately, as described below) . I measured crown base height (ground to bottom of 
continuous crown), dead wood exposure at the base ofthe bole (centimeters of 
circumference in exposed dead wood), and the vertical extent of exposed dead wood 
above ground level. These all may be potential risk factors for fire mortality. I also 
measured litter depths at the base of each tree (at four cardinal directions from the bole) . 
Woody debris near the tree base, another potential mortality risk factor, was also tallied 
for thousand-hour fuels (27.5 em in diameter) touching, within half the debris diameter's 
distance, its diameter's distance, and twice its diameter's distance of the tree bole. 
For spike tops, the height of the spike's base and top (which may differ from the 
tree 's highest point) were measured with a relaskop . The diameter of each spike was 
estimated at the base, mid-point, and top (since some are broken) using a relaskop. I 
83  
I 

tallied the number of excavated cavities (usually distinguishable by being round and 
relatively smooth-edged) in each spike top. 
For each lightning scar, I measured the height of the scar base and top with a 
relaskop, and measured or estimated the width of the approximate base, middle, and top 
of the scar either with a measuring tape for reachable measuring points, or visually for 
unreachable points. I classified each scar as continuous (scar is uninterrupted from top to 
bottom) or discontinuous (scar is interrupted by live bark). Lastly, I tallied excavated 
cavities found on the scar. 
Other deadwood features, including wounds from mechanical injury, disease or 
unknown cause and non-lightning dead streaks, were described and measured to provide 
information on their surface area and condition. I tallied excavated cavities for each 
feature separately. 
I tallied and measured large dead limbs and fire scars only on trees with some 
other feature (spike top, lightning scar, or other wound). For dead limbs, I estimated limb 
length, diameter and bark cover visually, and counted number of excavated cavities per 
limb. Fire scars were classified as either convex or concave. Their height was measured, 
and their width at 1.8m above ground. I tallied any cavities found in fire scars . 
Data analysis 
I calculated the density of partial snags for each relict site and for each partial 
snag type. Because sites differed in a number of features, I presented results on a site-by­
site basis. I reported density of cavities, average litter depth, deadwood exposure, crown­
base height, diameter, and other variables for each partial snag type separately. 
84 

I used geometric formulas to calculate the surface areas of each deadwood feature 
on each partial snag at the relict sites. For spike tops , I used base, middle, and top 
diameter measurements with top and base height measurements to calculated the surface 
area of each spike from its base to the point where either its taper indicated it would be 
less than 10 em in diameter, or to where it broke off (if its top diameter was greater than 
10 ern). Depending on the characteristics of taper and breakage, spike surface areas were 
calculated differently for different spikes. Formulas for the lateral surface areas of cones 
and truncated cones (A = 7r * basal radius * Y[(basal radius/ * (heightt '] and A = 7r * 
(basal radius + top radius) * V[(basal radius-top radius/ * (heightt']; respectively) 
formed the basis for spike surface area calculations. 
For lightning scars at GPNA and FP, I first used bh, Y4, Y2, and % height diameters 
to estimate taper and the length ofthe scar from 1.8 m to the point where taper indicated 
the bole diameter would be less than 10 ern. I then multiplied half the scar length by the 
average width of the upper half of the scar plus the average width of the lower half of the 
scar (A = ~ scar height * [((scar top width + scar middle width)/2) + ((scar middle 
width + scar bottom width/2))). The surface area of discontinuous scars was halved. 
When taper was estimated using all intermediate diameters scar length calculations never 
differed by more than 0.009 m from that when taper was estimated from only the dbh and 
total tree height. I used the simpler scar length calculation (using top to bottom, rather 
than section-by section taper) for trees at Galahad and Iron Creek Mesa.

The surface area of other wounds and scars was calculated from length and width 
measurements taken in the field. In all calculations, the measures of height were 
corrected to actual bole length for leaning trees.

I calculated the surface area of each dead branch as the lateral surface area of a 
cylinder with diameter and length given by field estimates (A = st * diameter * length). 
Branch surface areas were summed per tree . Fire scars were assumed to form an 
approximate triangle and surface area above 1.8m was estimated by A =0.5 * width at 
1.8m * (height - 1.8). 
I tested cavity tree selection of partial snags using an ad hoc distribution free 
exact test: ENi=n [N! / ((i!) * (N - i)!)] /2 N = P(n+ IN), where N is the total number of 
partial snags bearing cavities, and n is the total number of those trees whose variable of 
interest (diameter, for example) exceeds the population median for that measurement. 
The test yields the exact probability of randomly selecting n number of partial snags 
greater than the population median for a given variable from N number ofsnags bearing 
cavities (for example, the probability that 30 of 31 cavity-bearing partial snags will be 
larger than the median snag diameter would be 1.49 x 10.8 if selection were random with 
respect to diameter). I used this test (a = 0.05) to evaluate cavity tree selection based on 
height, diameter, distance to nearest snag neighbor, surface area of dead wood , crown 
base height, and litter depth. Then I used binary logistic regression to create a model 
predicting probability of cavity presence given the parameters found to be important in 
the previous test.. 
Some measurements used in this survey were more difficult to obtain than others 
and I noted which were most difficult or time consuming. To find easier to obtain, but 
still important variables for estimating the surface areas of spike tops and lightning scars, 
I used simple linear regression models to test correlations between actual surface area and 
surface area calculated using simpler measurements and calculations. 
86 

For partial snags at MT, I calculated density and proportions of partial snag types 
at each plot separately, then estimated means across the five plots. I could not estimate 
surface areas for lightning scars and other deadwood features. I used the exact test 
(above) to evaluate cavity selection based on height, diameter, and distance. 
RESULTS 
Characteristics of partial snags 
Relict sites 
Among the four relict sites GPNA had the lowest density of live old-growth and 
highest densities of spike tops and lightning scars (Table 3.1). It also had the largest 
mean tree diameters for all partial snag types. rCM had the lowest partial snag densities 
and sizes, though no information was available on live old-growth densities or sizes at 
that site. 
Spike tops were the most common type of partial snag at all four relict sites 
(Table 3.2), and were also the largest in terms of surface area of deadwood (Table 3.3). 
Spike tops consistently occurred on smaller trees (both in diameter and in height) than 
lightning scars. Compared to lightning scars, spike-topped trees had slightly lower crown 
base heights at all sites (mean difference = 1.1 m), but were less likely to have an overlap 
between the vertical extent of deadwood exposed at the ground and the crown base. The 
percent of spike tops with cavities ranged from 0% at ICM to 30% at FP. 
Lightning scars were the second most common type of partial snag (except at FP, 
where other wounds were more common), and their density varied more than the other 
87  

types (Table 3.4). Lightning scarred trees were taller and thicker in diameter than other 
partial snags, but the scars themselves had smaller surface areas than spike tops. Cavities 
were found in lightning scars at all sites, from 9% at GP to 33% at FP. The average 
cavity-bearing lightning scar was smaller than the average cavity-bearing spike top, but 
had more cavities per m2 of surface area. 
Partial snags with other wounds and scars were not a coherent group. Other types 
included small wounds resulting from mechanical injury or the breaking away of a fork, 
and large dead streaks of indeterminate origin, which sometimes covered over half the 
tree. They did not share any characteristics as a group, but contained cavities more often 
than either lightning scars or spike tops at both GPNA and FP, and more often than spike 
tops at GP. 
Large dead limbs occurred on 14% (lCM) to 55% (GPNA) of partial snags that 
had some other feature. Their presence added an average of 1.75 m2 of deadwood to a 
partial snag. There appeared to be no tendency for either spike tops or lightning scars to 
have dead limbs more often. Of trees with dead limbs, 0 (lCM , GP) to 4.5% (GPNA) had 
cavities in those limbs. 
Fire scars large enough (>1.8 m high X 10 em across at 1.8 m from ground) to be 
included in the survey were rare. Only 0 (GP) to 7% (FP) of partial snags bearing some 
other feature also had such fire scars. The surface area of dead wood available above 
1.8m on large fire scars averaged 0.01 (lCM) to 0.17 m2 (FP), and not one scar bore an 
excavated cavity. It is possible that some of the large dead streaks classified as "other" 
features originated from fire, but were not classified as fire scars . 
88  

Managed site 
At Mt. Trumbull, partial snag densities ranged from 0.8 to 3.1 per ha across the 
five plots (average: 1.7 / ha)(Table 3.2). Lightning scars were more common than spike 
tops on all five plots (p = 0.03). The two types showed no tendency to differ in size 
across the plots, but the overall average spike-topped tree was 12.6 em broader and 0.7 m 
shorter than the average lightning-scarred tree. 
Wildlife use of partial snags 
Relict sites 
No cavities were found in partial snags displaying less than 0.64 m2 of total 
deadwood, although the smallest single feature to contain a cavity was a lightning scar 
with surface area of 0.53 m2. The exact test indicated that total surface area, distance to 
nearest snag, crown base height, and dbh were all important in nest site selection (Table 
3.4). I entered these values into a logistic regression model. The model correctly 
classified 15% of cavity-bearing trees and had r-square = 0.17. 
Managed site 
Cavities were present in 42% of MT partial snags: 65% of spike tops bore 
cavities, 64% of other types, and 30% oflightning scars. Nineteen of 32 (p = 0.2) cavity­
bearing trees were greater than the median dbh, 17 (p = 0.4) were greater than the median 
height, and 20 (p = 0.1) were beyond the median distance from the nearest large snag.

Models for simplifying future partial snag surveys 
Measurement effort 
Partial snag surveys at each of the four sites required approximately 60 to 70 man­
hours to complete. Ten to 20 minutes was required to complete measurements on each 
tree, excluding search time, depending on the complexity of its features. By far the most 
time consuming measurements were diameters taken above bh, using the relaskop. 
Considerable effort was needed to measure out the correct viewing distance in a direction 
from which the feature was readily visible, set up the tripod, and read and record the 
measurements. It was sometimes necessary to measure a tree from multiple angles, to 
provide unobstructed views of the bole. Height measurements were also taken with the 
relaskop, but could have been taken with a much lighter clinometer, which would not 
have required a tripod for stability. Litter depth measurements were the next most time 
consuming measures, requiring the observer to measure radial directions from the bole, 
then kneel and measure four separate times for each tree. Distance to nearest full snag 
was measured by pacing - it often took longer to locate the nearest snag than to pace its 
distance. Ocular estimates of scar widths and debris proximity took the least time of all 
measurements. 
Spike-topped tree model 
I created two groups of spike-topped trees from which to build models of spike 
surface area based on simple measurements (specifically, measurements not requiring the 
use ofthe relaskop). Group 1 included spike tops at GPNA and GP and group 2 included 
FP and rCM. I chose these groups so that each would contain nearly equal numbers of 
90  

spike tops, and each would contain near the full range of their size. I eliminated forked 
spikes (2) and one unusually narrow and tall spike (at reM) to eliminate potential outlier 
values caused by these unusual shapes. Eighty-two trees in remained in group 1 and 81 
in group 2. In both groups, tree diameter and tree height by themselves were poor 
predictors of spike surface area . Spike height (distance from spike base to spike top) 
performed much better. About 71% of the variability in group 1 and 63% of the 
variability in group 2 was explained by (approximately) A = 0.72 *spike height -1. Next 
I created an equation to take into account spike height, tree diameter, and whether the 
spike was broken. The equation A = it" (0.5 + (0.5 * broken)) * (spike height / total 
height) * (dbh /100) * spike height estimates spike base diameter as a proportion of the 
dbh equal to the proportion of the spike height to the total height. It estimates surface 
area of the spike as a cone ifit is unbroken, as a column if broken. This equation 
explained 88.5% of the variability in spike surface areas in group 1,84.1% in group 2, 
using linear regression. For both groups, the equation underestimated spike surface 
areas, by a factor of 1.15 (~) + 0.49 (a) in group 1 and by a factor of 1.52 W) + .45 (a) in 
group 2. To determine which model was better overall, I used model 1 (1.15 * equation + 
.49) on group 2 spikes, and model 2 (1.52 * equation + .45) on group one spikes, and 
compared based on how well each model predicted surface areas in the spikes not used to 
build it. When the model predictions were regressed against actual surface areas, I found 
that model 1 performed better in group 2 than model 2 did in group 1 Wcloser to 1, a 
closer to 0). When applied to all spike-topped trees in both groups, model 1 explained 
83.4% of the variability in surface area, with predicted values slightly lower than actual 
values W= 1.10, a =0.04) . 
91 
·i 

Lightning scar model 
Estimates of surface area for lightning scars were virtually the same regardless of 
whether scar length (from 1.8 m above ground to the point where either the scar ends or 
diameter goes below 10 em, given bole taper), or simple scar height (from top to bottom) 
was used as the vertical measurement. Whether scar width was estimated as a single 
average, or as the average of the upper and lower halves also apparently made little 
difference. Scar surface area estimates given by A = (top height - bottom height) * 
average width * (1 / (discontinuous + J)) explained over 99% of the variability in the 
meticulously calculated scar surface areas. This was true for trees at GPNA and ICM 
(47, eliminating one forked tree) and at FP and GP (47, eliminating one forked tree). In 
both groups, the equation slightly overestimated surface areas W= 0.92 in both groups). 
DISCUSSION 
At all ofthe relict sites surveyed in this study, snag density exceeded partial snag 
density by 3 to 5 times. At the managed site, snag density was only 1.4 times that of 
partial snags. The total surface area of deadwood on snags is surely also much greater on 
a per-ha basis than that for partial snags because each snag's entire surface area is of dead 
wood, not just part of it. The number of cavities found in partial snags is therefore almost 
certainly far out of proportion to the amount of deadwood they offer. At MT, for 
example, as many partial snags as full snags bore cavities, although partial snags 
occurred at only 71% the density of snags.

There may be several explanations for the differences in partial snag densities at 
the five sites in this study. Partial snag creation is obviously related to weather (lightning 
and drought, especially), but also mistletoe and insect outbreak. Partial snag loss is likely 
related to factors such as soil type, wind velocity, management and fire history. It is 
possible that the relative lack of lightning scars at FP and rCM to wildfire occurrence. It 
seems likely that lightning scars, with exposed wood at the base forming a fuel ladder 
into the crown, would be especially susceptible to death or destruction in a surface fire. It 
is also possible that the relative lack of partial snags at MT is due to management actions 
over the last century. Certainly, occurrence of partial snags depends on the presence of 
large live trees, so where these have been removed few partial snags are likely. Also, 
past management practices have often focused on removing "defective" trees. 
Comparison between sites where confounding factors have not been controlled is risky, 
however, so I must stress that this study does not support such conclusions. 
Measures of potential fire mortality risk factors did not suggest that spike-topped 
trees should be expected to be any more susceptible to fire than lightning-scarred trees, 
although about 10% of lightning-scarred trees had an overlap between the upper extent of 
deadwood from the ground and the lower extent of the live crown, suggesting that they 
might be at greater risk of mortality or destruction in the event of a fire because of the 
fuel ladder to the crown provided by the often resinous scars. 
Lightning-scarred trees did not appear to contain cavities relatively more or less 
than spike tops, but among those that were used, there were more cavities per m2 of 
surface area. This suggests that lightning scars need not be as big as spike tops to attract 
a hole-making bird.

Over a third of snags bearing other wounds and scars also bore lightning scars 
and/or spike tops. Trees bearing other wounds and scars were heavily used when they 
also displayed lightning scars or spike tops (56% of trees containing an "other" wound in 
addition to lightning or spike contained a cavity) but not when other wounds occurred 
alone (19% bore cavities). It is possible that trees bearing other wounds in addition to 
spike tops or lightning scars are more likely to have heart rot. 
Large dead limbs occurred on partial snags of all types and at all sites. They 
added considerable deadwood to a tree's total when present, but rarely bore cavities 
themselves. The horizontal orientation of most branches may make them less suitable for 
nesting sites than similarly-sized spike tops . Surface area may not be an appropriate 
measure for the availability of deadwood in branches because the upper half of the branch 
surface is not a likely location for a cavity entrance. Dead branches are used for foraging 
and perching, and so their presence may be a factor in nest site selection . Of partial snags 
having large dead limbs, 27% (of91) also had cavities, compared to 19% (of280) in 
partial snags generally. 
Large fire scars were rarely encountered and never used as a nesting substrate by 
cavity-nesting birds. It seems unlikely that a cavity would ever be constructed in a 
concave fire scar, as these are usually charred and case-hardened. Convex scars, 6 of the 
8 in this survey, are more likely to contain cavities, and I have seen this on a few 
occasions, but not at these study sites.. 
That surface area might be an important variable in nest site selection in partial 
snags was expected, given that snag size affects use of full snags (Thomas et al. 1979). 
Cavity-bearing partial snags appear at about the same number in each surface area size

class, regardless of the availability of trees in a size class (Fig. 3.1), so larger classes are 
over-represented in cavity trees. Crown base heights tend to be lower on spike-topped 
trees, which had larger surface area, so crown base height may appear to be important 
because it is correlated with surface area. I had anticipated that partial snags in closer 
proximity to full snags would be more likely to contain cavities, but the opposite 
appeared to be the case. As with surface area class, partial snags more distant from full 
snags are over-represented among cavity trees relative to their availability (Fig. 3.2). The 
poor predictive ability of the logistic regression model of cavity presence may reflect the 
fact that ultimate selection of cavity sites depends on internal tree characteristics that are 
impossible to observe from the ground, such as presence ofheartrot (Conner et al. 1976, 
Miller and Miller 1980, Schepps et al. 1999). 
All of the relict sites had higher density of partial snags than the managed forest at 
Mt. Trumbull. The ratio of lightning-scarred to spike-topped trees was the reverse (fewer 
lightning) at all four relict sites than at MT. For both spike tops and lightning scars, MT 
partial snags tended to be short but broad, probably a site effect not related to 
management. 
Partial snags at MT were used much more heavily than at any of the relict sites. 
This may be related to the fact that the relict sites had many more snags than MT had. 
Partial snags at MT were used at a higher rate than full snags of similar minimum dbh 
(above 37.5 em dbh, 30% were used), and spike-tops and trees with other wounds at a 
much higher rate (-65%). This result may reflect wildlife selection, longer persistence of 
partial snags, or both. The variables dbh, height, and distance to nearest snag did not 
appear to be good indicators of cavity presence at MT. Surface area and/or crown-base 
95 

height may be important, but that cannot be determined with the data collected in this 
study. 
MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH 
The results of this study imply that partial snags are an important component of 
the standing deadwood resource in relict forests, with almost a fifth of all types bearing 
cavities. The partial snag resource should be evaluated in wildlife habitat inventories, 
and also should be considered as part of post-restoration goals. Special efforts should be 
used to protect partial snags during the initial treatments of a restoration effort - they 
should certainly not be cut down and litter and duff should be raked back from their 
boles. Duff raking may be especially important for those with deadwood exposed at their 
base, such as lightning scars. At GP, which recently experienced a surface fire following 
a long fire-free period, I observed that many of the partial snags I measured were in the 
process of dying, and that a number of former partial snags were already dead . Killed 
partial snags may make particularly good quality snags (Miller and Miller 1980), but fires 
are probably much more likely to kill partial snags than to create them , diminishing one 
resource pool to feed another one. It would be better to attempt to preserve all standing 
dead wood through the critical initial treatment of a restoration effort (when snag and 
partial snag mortality is most likely because of high fuel loading), and consider 
supplementing the snag population through the use of nest boxes or artificially induced 
mortality in some post-settlement trees otherwise scheduled for removal. Creating partial 
snags through partial girdling or other intentional wounding may be possible, but partial 
snags created from any trees otherwise scheduled for removal would likely be rather

small in size, and intentionally wounding trees otherwise scheduled for retention is 
inadvisable for the risk of killing them. 
Future partial snag surveys at the sites used in this study could provide 
information about the creation and mortality rates of partial snags under both natural 
conditions and restoration treatments. In future partial snag surveys, at these sites and at 
any other sites of interest, I recommend amending the protocol used here to improve 
efficiency. Fire scars probably do not need to be measured in future surveys, as they 
were relatively rare, and never bore cavities. In future, branches probably do not need to 
be measured individually either; since they rarely contained cavities, though it might be 
useful to note the presence or absence of large branches. Measurements using the 
relaskop appeared to be unnecessary. Measures of diameter above bh did not much 
improve the calculation of lightning scar surface area. Although they allowed better 
estimates of bole taper, and thus of scar length, scar lengths calculated given bole taper 
differed very little from scar heights from top to bottom . Measures of spike diameter had 
a bigger influence on calculating spike surface area, but modell, given in the results, 
above, accounts for almost all of the differences in spike surface areas and uses easier-to­
obtain measurements. Height measurements were important for calculating surface area 
in both spike tops and lightning scars, but could be obtained more easily with a much 
lighter, cheaper, and more portable clinometer rather than the relaskop. Partial snags in

measurements of fire mortality risk are unnecessary, though they may be of interest if a 
survey precedes a prescribed fire. Distance to nearest snag appeared to be important in 
wildlife selection and is not difficult to measure. Spike and lightning scar conditions and 
bark cover may be related to bird used, but if use is defined as cavity presence, these age 
related variables will be poor predictors because cavities may remain long after use has 
ceased and after condition has changed from when use was initiated.
