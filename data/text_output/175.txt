Understory vegetation from sawt imber, pole, and sapling strata was sampled for biomass and nutrient concentrations, the
summer following a fall-prescribed fire in ponderosa pine on basalt soils in Arizona. United States. Nutrient concentrations
were generally higher on burned than unburned plots, with striking differences among oversto ry strata. K showed the most
consistent response, while N showed the greatest increase in magnitude. The greatest increases in nutrients were in the
sawtimber stratum, where Festuca arizonica Vasey and the miscellaneous grasses category were at times twice as high in N
concentration on the burned sites. Differences in understory biomass were most obvious in September when both pole and
sapling strata were twice as high on burned plots as controls. These production and nutrient responses varied highly depending
on species considered. overstory type, and season. However, in general this prescribed fire appears to have increased nutrient
availability, stimulating understory production and increasing nutrient concentration thus improving forage quality for both
livestock and wildlife .

Introduction
Although prescribed burning is being used exten-
sively in the ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws')
forest type of North America as a fuel reduction tool ,
little is known about its effects on ecosystem properties.
The few studies that do exist suggest that prescribed
burning in ponderosa pine can have a profound effect on
nutrient cycling and production of both trees and under-
story vegetation (e.g., Fuller et al. 1955; Biswell er al.
1973).
In 1976, a study of the effects of prescribed burning
in ponderosa pine on fuel loading, nutrient cycling, and
productivity was initiated at the Fort Valley Experi-
mental Forest near Flagstaff, Arizona, United States.
Cooperative research is being conducted by scientists of

1980; W.

The research reported in this paper was designed to
determine changes in nutrient concentration and bio-
mass of the understory vegetation for the first growing
season after the burning. Changes in nutrient concen-
tration and biomass of the understory are important for

evaluating changes in forage for livestock and wildlife,
as a diagnostic tool for assessing chan ges in nutrient
availability for overstory vegetation, and for examining
the role of the understory in functioning as a tempora ry
sink (c.f., Marks 1974; Safford and Filip 1974) for
nutrients released by the fire.
Specifically, this study presents results of the effects
of a fall-prescribed fire on nutrient concentrations and
biomass for four categories of understory vegetation,
Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica Vasey), mountain
muhly (M uhlenbergia montana (Nutt.) Hitchc.), mis-
cellaneous grasses, and miscellaneous forbs . Since
southwestern ponderosa pine is characterized by ex-
tremely small-scale (less than 0.5 ha) variation in com-
munity characteristics associated with the even-aged
overstory
groups
(Schubert
1974;
Cooper
1961),
sampling and
analysis was
stratified according to
overstory strata: sawtimber-sized patches, pole- sized
patches, and sapling-sized patches.
Research area
The study area is part of the Chimney Spring Unit , Fort
Valley Experimental Forest, located about 10 km northwest
of Flagstaff. Arizona , United States, on sections 30 and 19 of
T 22 N and R 7 E. The Fort Valley Experimental Forest has
been the site of numerous studies, summarized in Schubert
(1974). Based on fire scar analysis, the last fire on the study
area occurred in 1876, but before that, fires occurred period-
ically at
an average
interval
of
approximatel y
2 years
(Dieterich 1980).
By extending the boundaries of a soils report for an area
adjacent to our study area, we determined that the soil on the
site is predominantly a Brolliar stony clay loam, tentatively
classified as a fine, montmorillonitic. frigid, typic Argiboroll
(R. T. Meurrise, unpublished data"). The area is gentle in
topography (slope 0-5%); elevation ranges from 2240 to
2290 m.
Mean annu al temperature is approximately 6°C with a mean
monthly maximum temperature of 23°C during the growing
season, which averages 94 days (Schubert (974). Average
annual precipitation is 57 em, occurring in two distinct peri-
ods, winter and midsummer. Precipitation varies greatly from
year to year, with prolon ged droughts being common.
The study area is in a Pinus ponderosa -
Festuca arizo-
nica habitat type (E. L. Fitzhugh, personal communication).
The overstory consists entirely of uneven-aged ponderosa
pine that is distributed in even-aged groups of trees. The
irregularity of these groups causes numerous small open ings
where herbaceous vegetation is dominant. Understory vegeta-
tion is dominated by grasses such as Arizona fesc ue (Festuca
arizonica Vasey ), mountain muhly tMuhlenb ergia montana
(Nutt.) Hitchc.), squirrel tail tStitanion longifolium 1. G.
Smith),
and
pine
drop seed
(Blepharoneuron
trieholepis
(Torr) Nash ). The major browse species in the area is Fendler

ceanothus (Ceanothus [endleriana Gray). A variety of fOrbs
is also present with thistle (Clrsium spp.). groundse l (Senecio
spp.), and golde nrod (Solidago spp.) well represented.
The controlled burn ing of 18 plots ( I ha each) was con,
ducted in November 1976, with 3 unburned plots permanently
reserved as controls and 7 unburn ed plots set aside for future
burning or destructive sampling. The overall study design.
fuel description, and burning conditi ons are described in
Sackell () 980 ).
Rainfall on the study area was below normal during the late
summer and fall prior to the initial fires in 1976. On OctOber
21.0.69 cm of rain fell; 4 days later. 0.08 cm was recorded
with no other recordable precipitation until several weeks
after the plots were burned. On the evening of November 5,
the study area was burned. Ignition began at 5:30 p.m. and
continued until II :00 p.m.
Surface needle (L-Iayer) moisture content increased from 8
to 12% durin g the night as temperatures fell. Similarly, lower
layers (F and H layers) of the forest floor increased from 10
to 19% moisture content. Temperatures in the stand dropped
from 15°C at 5:30 p.m . to 3°C at midnight. when the flaming
combustion of the forest floor was complete. During the same
time period relati ve humidity increased from 21 to 48%. Ini-
tially backing fires were used but when they no longer carried
well, short (9- 12 m between strips) strip head fires were
used . Rates of spread were no greater than 3.7 m/min . gener-
ally ranging from 1.2 to 1.8 m/ min. Flame lengths in litter
fuels seldom exceeded 40 cm. Glowing combustion in deep
duff fuel continued for 2- 3 days. Some large woody debris
and stumps smoldered for as long as 4 weeks .
The fire consumed surface needles on 94% of the area.
exposing mineral soil on 16% of the area. Fuels less than
2.54 cm in diameter were reduced by 63%, while large
woody fuels (>2.54 ern diameter) were reduced by 69%. The
greatest fuel reduction occurred under the sawtimber-sized
trees where fuel loads were the heaviest. Here . the forest floor
was almost completely consumed. leaving only an ash bed
over the mineral soil. Fuel reduction was least in the sapling-
sized group s, while pole-sized groups were intermediate.
Methods
Sampling for this study was on
I 1 burned plots and
7 unburned plots dur ing the summer of 1977. With in each
plot five permanentl y located 0.04-ha circular basal area
(BA)
plots
were
classified
into
strata:
( I)
sawtimber
(> 27.5 em dbh. == 366 stems/ ha, age = 200-500 years).
(2) pole (10 .0- 27.5 ern dbh , == 400- 1500 stems/ha, age =
57 -150 years) , and (3) sapling « 10.0 ern dbh , == 1900
stems/ha, age = 57 years). For the entire area , basal area
averaged 33 m2/ha for trees ;;.10 cm dbh; site index is 82
(Sackett 1980).
The sawtimber stratum consisted of sawtimber-sized trees
with interspersed openings. Sample plots within this stratum
were either under the canopy or within 3 m of the canopy's
edge. The denser pole and sapling strata had no canopy open-
ings; therefore all samples in these strata were collected under
full canopy cover. Based on the relative area of each stratum.
7 locations for each treatment (bum and control) were selected
randomly in the sawtimber and in the sapli ng strata with 14 in
the pole stratum .

Herbage production in Arizona ponderosa pine exhibits two
pronounced peaks (early and late summer) in response to the
(WO distinct precipitation periods (winter and midsummer)
which characterize the region (Clary 1975). Thus standing
crop was sampled on the BA plots in June and September, the
approximate dates of biomass and flowering peaks of the
major understory species. At each sample location the current
season' s standing crop of (I) Arizona fescue, (2) mountain
muhly,
(3) miscellaneous
forbs,
and (4) miscellaneous
grasses was clipped from two 0.89-m2 sample quadrats and
composited. Therefore, the sawtimber and sapling strata each
had a sample size of 7 composite samples (of two 0.89-m
2
quadrats) while the pole stratum had 14 composite samples.
The samples were dried 24 h at 80°C, then weighed. This
estimate of production does not include any root production or
the base of Arizona fescue up to I in. (I in. = 25.4 mm)
above ground, due to problems in sampling a dense bunch-
grass like fescue.
Collection of vegetation for nutrient analysis was I week
later on the same BA plots as production samples. At least
I g of sample was collected, a composite of clippings from
several plants in the same category. These samples were also
oven-dried 24 h at 80°C.
Samples were analyzed for ( I) nitrogen, (2) calcium,
(3 ) phosphorus, (4) magnesium, and (5) potassium. Prepara-
tion of plant material for analysis was by Caro acid digestion
(Bowen 1967). Nitrogen and phosphorus were determined
calorimetrically on a Turner 330 spectrophotometer while
cations were determined on a Perkin-Elmer 303 atomic
absorption spectrophotometer. Data were analyzed by r-tests
at the 95% probability level.
Results
Nutrient concentrations
Nutrient
concentrations in understory vegetation
were generally higher on burned than unburned plots
(Tables 1- 4); concentrations were never significantly
(p = 0.05) higher on unburned than burned plots.
Potassium showed the most consistent response of all
the elements sampled, being significantly higher on
burned plots for more than half of the comparisons.
Nitrogen concentrations in burned sawtimber showed
the greatest increase in magnitude. Arizona fescue and
miscellaneous grasses in the sawtimber stratum were at
times twice as high in N concentration on the burned
sites (Tables 2 and 3). While burned sawtimber and
pole strata had significantly higher nutrient concen-
trations than their unburned counterparts for numerous
comparisons, sapling stands had few.
Although forbs (Table 1) were generally higher in
nutrient concentration than grasses (Tables 2,3, and 4),
grasses exhibited greater increases in nutrient concen-
tration due to burning. Suggestion of a seasonal trend is
apparent in the decline in nutrient concentrations from
June to September (Tables 3 and 4).
In summary, nutrient concentrations were consis-
tently higher on burned sites than on unburned sites.

These differences varied
according to the element
examined as well as the stratum, species, and season
thus resulting in complex nutrient behavior within the
system.
Biomass
Differences in understory biomass between burned
and unburned sites were more apparent in September
than in June (Tables 1-5). Burned sapling and burned
pole stands were twice as high in biomass as unburned
counterparts in September (Table 5). In the sawtimber
stratum burned and unburned sites were not signifi-
cantly different in understory biomass, but differed in
percent composition by plant categories. On unburned
sawtimber plots miscellaneous forbs made up 54% of
the standing crop while miscellaneous grasses and
Arizona fescue were 28%. On burned sawt imber plots
composition
was
the
reverse,
with
miscellaneous
grasses and Arizona fescue
providing 61 % of the
stand ing crop and miscellaneous forbs only 28%. How-
ever, in localized areas where large woody fuel accu-
mulations or especially heavy forest floor loads were
consumed, high densities of several forbs with wind
dispersed seeds occurred. Particularly important were
Solidago spp., Cirsium spp., Chenopodium spp., and
Verbascum thapsus.
Discussion
Standard errors were proportionately much higher for
biomass (generally 25- 40% of the mean) than for
nutrient
concentrations
(generally 5-10%
of
the

mean). Thus , while we feel we have an adequate test for
mean ingful differences in nutrient concentrations. bio-
mass was so much more variable that only major differ-
ences were detectable.
Significant standing crop increases in the understory
vegetation on burned plots in sapling and pole strata
were apparent by September. This is in agreement with
results of Pearson et al. (1972) and Campbell et al.
(1977) who found understory production increases fol-
lowing moderate- to low-intensity wildfires in south-
western ponderosa pine.
Generally, burning in ponderosa pine seems to favor
grasses. Weaver (1951) observed that burning generally
increases the production of perennial grasses thus
improving
understory
forage
quality .
Moderate-
intensity fires seem to favor grass production over forb
production (Pearson et al. 1972; Ffolliott et al. 1977).
This effect was apparent in our study. especially for
Arizona fescue. However, Gaines et al. (1958) found
decreases in grass density the Ist year after two pre-
scribed fires in ponderosa pine on the Fort Apache
Indian Reservation in east central Arizona.
The
increased
growth
of
understory
vegetation
following burning may be attributed to reduced forest
floor depth (Clary et al.
1968). rejuvenated plants
(Daubenmire 1968), increased moisture and nutrients
(M. G. Ryan and W. Covington. to be published"), and
decreased allelopathy (Christensen 1977). Of these .
nutrient increases have received the most attention.
Evidence for increased nutrient availability following
burning in ponderosa pine comes from our results
which indicate generally higher nutrient concentrations
in the understory vegetation. However. Christensen
(1977) found that not only burning but also clipping
unburned plots resulted in increased understory nutrient
concentrations (especially potassium and phosphorus)
in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Miller) . Thus some of.
our observed changes in nutrient concentrations may be
due to the removal by the fire of carry-over blades and
stems rather than the direct effects of burning on nutri-
ent availability in the soil.
Several studies suggest increased nutrient availability
following burning in ponderosa pine. M. G. Ryan and
W. Covington (to be published') found higher soil am-
monium and nitrate concentrations in the soil on the
same plots and during the same year as the study
reported in the present paper. In pot bioassay tests,
using lettuce and ponderosa pine as indicators, soils that
had been burned by light surface fires showed higher
yields than controls due to better nutrient relations
(Wagle and Kitchen 1972; Vlamis et al. 1955). This
increased nutrient availability is attributed to leaching
of nutrients from ash as well as increased microbial
mineralization. Our results indicate that nutrient con-
centrations in understory vegetation were highest in
June; few categorie~ were
~ighe~ in September. This
occurred even for nitrogen 10 spite of sustained high
nitrogen availability (M. G. Ryan and W. Covington
to be published"). The September decrease in under:
st.01J'. nutrient conce?trations may be due to the growth
dilution effect ; that IS. that growth was proportionately
greater than nutrient uptake as the season progressed
Also, during senescence nutrients are retranslocated
from the leaves to basal storage areas in perennial
grasses such as those which dominate our study area
(Clary 1975).
The greatest increases in understory vegetation num.
.ent concentration were in the sawtimber stratum. Forest
floor accumulations were greatest in this stratum as was
fuel reduction. I.n fact, t?e forest floo.r was generally
burned to the mineral SOIl under sawtimber canopies,
leaving a thick layer of ash to provide a fertilizing effect
on plants.
Nitrogen. phosphorus. and potassium, the most im-
portant limiting elements for plant growth; showed the
greatest treatment effects. Increasing nitrogen availabil-
ity may be due to increased decomposition of residual
material left after burning (W. W. Covington and S. S.
Sackett, to be published'). Phosphorus availability was
least affected by burning, perhaps due to its slow rate of
leaching from ash (Lloyd 1971) or possibly phosphate
fixation in the soil (Vlamis et al. 1955; Wagle and
Kitchen 1972). Because potassium leaches rapidly from
ash, there may have been a mass ion effect in the soil.
thus providing excess potassium for plant uptake (Grier
1975).
Our observed increases in nutrient concentration and
biomass of the understory following prescribed burning
have several important ecological implications. First.
the understory production response suggests a general
improvement in site productivity which may be re-
flected in overstory production as well. Second . the
increase in both biomass and nutrient content suggests
that the understory serves as a sink, at least temporarily,
for some of the nutrient s released by burning . Third,
higher forage value for grazing animals. especially elk
and cattle, is affected not only by increased nutrient
conc entrations and biomass of the understory but also
by a shift
in species composition toward
grasses.
Finally, all of these effects varied greatly among over-
story types with the most striking changes occurring in
the sawtimber stratum while the least effect was in the
sapling stratum; the pole stratum was intermediate. This
gradation in effects is most likely related to differences
in fuel load and fuel reduction with the sawtimber stra-
tum having the greatest fuel load and also the most
complete fuel consumption, the pole str1tum inter-
mediate. and the sapling stratum the least.
Our results suggest that before useful generalizations
about fire effects on resource yields can be developed.

substantially more information needs to be collected.
Even in a monospecific forest type such as south-.
western ponderosa pine, understory production and
nutrient responses varied highly depending on indi-
vidual species, overstory condition, and season. When
variation in response associated with burning condi-
tions is added in, it becomes apparent that careful
experimental design with small-scale stratification is
essential for obtaining the required resource response
data economically.
