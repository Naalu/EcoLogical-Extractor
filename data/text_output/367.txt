Stand- and landscape-level effects of prescribed
burning on two Arizona wildfires
Mark A. Finney, Charles W. McHugh, and Isaac C. Grenfell
Abstract: Performance of fuel treatments in modifying behavior and effects of the largest wildfires has rarely been
evaluated, because the necessary data on fire movement, treatment characteristics, and fire severity were not obtainable
together. Here we analyzed satellite imagery and prescribed fire records from two Arizona wildfires that occurred in
2002, finding that prescribed fire treatments reduced wildfire severity and changed its progress. Prescribed burning in
ponderosa pine forests 1–9 years before the Rodeo and Chediski fires reduced fire severity compared with untreated ar-
eas, despite the unprecedented 1860-km2 combined wildfire sizes and record drought. Fire severity increased with time
since treatment but decreased with unit size and number of repeated prescribed burn treatments. Fire progression cap-
tured by Landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+) clearly showed the fire circumventing treatment units and
protecting areas on their lee side. This evidence is consistent with model predictions that suggest wildland fire size and
severity can be mitigated by strategic placement of treatments.
Résumé : L’impact de la réduction des combustibles sur le comportement et les effets des incendies de forêt de grande
envergure a rarement été évalué parce qu’il n’était pas possible de rassembler les données nécessaires sur le mouve-
ment du feu, les caractéristiques du traitement et la sévérité du feu. Les auteurs ont analysé des images satellitaires et
des données de brûlages dirigés associés à deux incendies de forêt qui sont survenus en Arizona en 2002. Les résultats
montrent que les brûlages dirigés ont réduit la sévérité des incendies de forêt et modifié leur progression. Des brûlages
dirigés dans les forêts de pin ponderosa, un à neuf ans avant que surviennent les incendies de Rodeo et Chediski, ont
réduit la sévérité du feu comparativement aux zones non traitées, malgré la dimension combinée sans précédent de ces
incendies, soit 1860 km2, et une sécheresse record. La sévérité du feu a augmenté en fonction du temps écoulé depuis
le traitement mais a diminué en fonction de la dimension et du nombre de fois que les brûlages dirigés avaient été ré-
pétés. La progression des incendies captée par Landsat 7 (appareil de cartographie thématique amélioré) a clairement
démontré que le feu a contourné les aires traitées et que les zones situées du côté sous le vent des aires traitées ont
ainsi été protégées. Cette observation est consistante avec les prédictions du modèle qui indique que la dimension et la
sévérité des incendies de forêt peuvent être atténuées en disposant les traitements de façon stratégique.

Introduction
Prescribed burning and thinning treatments are of particu-
lar interest for wildfire hazard reduction in ponderosa pine
forests now altered after 20th century fire exclusion (Cooper
1960; Arno and Brown 1991; Covington and Moore 1994).
Treatments deny fuel to future wildfires and can thereby re-
duce fire severity (Biswell et al. 1973; Wagle and Eakle
1979; Pollet and Omi 2002; Fernandes and Botelho 2003).
Fire severity is a general term for biological and ecological
effects of different fire behaviors (e.g., vegetation, soil, etc.)
(Ryan and Noste 1985; Reinhardt et al. 2001; Graham et al.
2004). Scorching and ignition of tree crowns (Van Wagner
1973, 1977) are related to fireline intensity, which depends
on fire spread rate and fuel availability in flaming combus-
tion (Byram 1959; Alexander 1982). Heating of tree stems,
roots, and soil is related to fuel consumption and duration of
smoldering combustion that depends on fuel loading and
moisture content (Ryan and Frandsen 1991; Albini et al.
1996). Injuries to trees from both fireline intensity and fuel
consumption can ultimately cause mortality, depending on
interactions with tree physiology and insect and disease agents
(Ryan 1990; Reinhardt et al. 2001).
Fuel treatments specifically attempt to reduce fuel quantity,
depth, and continuity (vertical and horizontal) to mitigate
potential fire behaviors and their ecological and management
impacts (Graham et al. 2004). Treatment by prescribed fire
removes surface fuels, kills small trees and shrubs, and
scorches lower limbs to reduce vertical continuity of the for-
est stand. Prescribed burning has been used to mitigate wild-
fire behavior and effects in dry conifer forests (ponderosa
pine and mixed conifer) of the southwestern United States
for decades (Weaver 1943; Kallander et al. 1955; Cooper
1961; Biswell et al. 1973; Wagle and Eakle 1979). Pre-
scribed burns are consistent with effects of low-intensity
fires that occurred in these forests every 2–10 years before
19th century settlement (Weaver 1943; Swetnam and Baisan
1996). Continued exclusion of these surface fires through
fire suppression has permitted forest stands to become dense

with accumulated living and dead fuels across large land-
scapes (104–105 km2) (Weaver 1943; Cooper 1960; Fulé et al.
1997; Allen et al. 2002). Modern wildfires now burn only
under extreme weather conditions, when suppression efforts
fail, and when fuel and forest structure contribute to severe
crown fires (Biswell et al. 1973; Wagle and Eakle 1979;
Arno and Brown 1991; Covington and Moore 1994). Al-
though fuel modifications may physically change fire behav-
ior, the changes may be insufficient to produce the desired
modification of severity under extreme weather conditions.
Fuel treatment effectiveness under extreme weather condi-
tions is open to a number of questions, namely the longevity
of treatment effects, requirements of maintaining or repeat-
ing treatments, the importance of the size of treatment units,
effects of treatments on wildfire growth and progress, and
the amount of treatment required to change large fire behav-
ior. These issues span a range of spatial scales, from the
stand level, where treatments are intended to improve forest
survival, to the landscape level, where treatments have po-
tential for disrupting fire growth and reducing fire movement
and ultimate size. This paper reports on analysis, at several
spatial scales, of fuel treatment effects on two wildfires that
encountered prescribed burn units conducted over a range of
years, sizes, and with repetition.
Materials and methods
The opportunity to evaluate fuel treatment effects follow-
ing extreme wildfires was provided in summer of 2002, when
the ponderosa pine forests on part of the White Mountain
Apache lands and the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest ex-
perienced the largest fire events in Arizona history. The
Rodeo and Chediski fires began approximately 15 km apart
(Fig. 1a) on 18 and 20 June and eventually burned more
than 1860 km2 (460 000 acres) under record drought condi-
tions (Kipfmueller 2003). Strong winds pushed the fires north
into fuel treatments on White Mountain Apache lands and
then across the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest. The Lime-
stone weather station (RAWS No. 020309), located within
the final fire perimeter, recorded afternoon wind gusts above
40 km·h–1 (25 mph) for most days and 73 km·h–1 (45 mph)
on 21 June, sustained relative humidity below 10% for most
afternoons, and calculated moisture content of dead fuels for
all size classes below 4%.
The White Mountain Apache Tribe located in central Ari-
zona, USA (Fig. 1a), has been conducting prescribed burn-
ing, thinning, and harvest operations on their commercial
timberlands since the early 1940s (Weaver 1943; Cooper
1961; Biswell et al. 1973; Wagle and Eakle 1979). The US
Forest Service had also conducted prescribed fire treatments
in conjunction with various forest management activities on
the adjacent Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest. Management
records contained the date and boundaries of prescribed fire
treatment units (Fig. 1b). Our analysis focused only on effects
of the prescribed fire treatments, because these had relatively
well-defined boundaries and dates of completion. Treated ar-
eas received the most recent prescribed burn between 1993
and 2001, providing 157 polygons that ranged in size from
0.02 to 22.6 km2 (5–5600 acres). These polygons overlapped
with smaller units receiving previous prescribed fire treat-
ments, which resulted in 811 polygons burned one to six
times since 1950.
Fire severity for the treated and untreated areas burned by
the Rodeo–Chediski fires was inferred from the differenced
normalized burn ratio (dNBR) developed from Landsat 7 en-
hanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+) imagery at 30-m resolu-
tion provided by the National Park Service – US Geological
Survey Burn Severity Mapping Project (http://burnseverity.
cr.usgs.gov/fire_main.asp). The ratios of near-infrared to mid-
infrared spectral reflectance (band 4, 0.76–0.90 µm; and band 7,
2.08–2.35 µm) are calculated on images before and after a
fire (Miller and Yool 2002; van Wagtendonk et al. 2004).
Large differences between the pre- and post-fire ratios (dNBR)
indicate high fire severity because of lower near-infrared
reflectance associated with foliage on green vegetation (trees
and understory) and higher mid-infrared reflectance associ-
ated with increased exposed and blackened soil, and de-
creased moisture content of surface materials (White et al.
1996; Miller and Yool 2002). The dNBR index and similar
band combinations have been found to correspond well with
burn severity in Arizona, Colorado, Montana, and New Mexico
(White et al. 1996; Bertolette and Spotskey 2001; Miller and
Yool 2002; van Wagtendonk et al. 2004). Ranges of dNBR
are typically classified with respect to levels of tree damage
visible from ground observation (Fig. 1c), varying from un-
burned to complete foliar consumption (Key and Benson
2005).
We analyzed a subset of the 30-m dNBR pixels, sampled
on a regular spacing of 90 m, to minimize artifacts from
coregistration of the separate satellite images taken just be-
fore the wildfire (5 June 2002) and soon after the wildfire (7
July 2002) used to calculate dNBR. The selected pixels were
then identified as inside or outside of treatment units. The
large number of pixels outside of treatment units was re-
duced to 21 421 by resampling at a regular spacing of 270 m
to accommodate statistical software limitations. Pixels inside
(34 867) were assigned values of time since treatment (years),
number of repeated prescribed burns, size of the most recent
treatment unit (square kilometres), and nearest distance from
the edge of the defining polygon (metres). Having these
nominal treatment descriptors in common qualifies the pix-
els as pseudoreplicates within treatment units and even the
whole Rodeo–Chediski wildfire (van Mantgem et al. 2001).
Retaining a large sample size, however, was important to our
objective of understanding variation in local fire severity
within this data set. There are many independent sources of
variation in local severity that are only partially related to
the nominal treatment descriptors or the wildfire event itself,
including (1) the characteristics and variability of the pre-
scribed fire treatment (e.g., amount of fuel consumption, in-
tensity) within a given treatment unit, (2) the structure of the
forest and fuels at the time of the treatment and in 2002 at
the time of the wildfire, and (3) the behavior characteristics,
timing, and movement direction of the wildfire as it encoun-
tered each pixel location.
Spatial linear regression was used to explore general rela-
tionships of the independent variables to dNBR. We used
conditional spatial autoregression (CAR) (Kaluzny et al. 1998),
which relaxes the assumption of independent residuals used
in ordinary least-squares regression by accounting explicitly
for spatial covariance. Variogram modelling indicated spatial

autocorrelation out to approximately 3 km, suggesting patchiness
related to topography, wildfire behavior, and the treatments
themselves. The CAR routine in the S+ software program
(Kaluzny et al. 1998) estimates spatial covariance from the
dNBR values of neighboring pixels. The regression parti-
tions the variance according to three sources: the fitted trend,
the spatial covariance component, and residual error. Before
analysis, the dNBR data were normalized with a square-root
transformation and range-shifted to offset negative values
(dNBR + 700)0.5.
Possible nonlinear or discontinuous relationships between
the independent variables and dNBR were then explored us-
ing least-squares regression trees (Breiman et al. 1998). Re-
gression trees are fit by sequentially splitting data into two
subsets. Each split is based on the independent variable that
minimizes the squared deviance from the mean of a continu-

6, 4, and 3 show (a) the general location of the study area and the positions of the Chediski and Rodeo fires spreading north at 1100 h
on 21 June 2002; (b) locations and dates of the most recent prescribed fire treatments (since 1993) on White Mountain Apache Tribal
and Apache-Sitreaves National Forest lands reveal that fire spread has circumnavigated a 3-year-old area of treatment and is contacting
a 1-year-old treatment unit on the right side; (c) fire severity for the entire Rodeo–Chediski fire area was indexed by the differenced
normalized burn ratio (dNBR) and displayed on a background image from 24 August 2002. The dNBR index is the difference between
ratios of near-infrared to mid-infrared spectral reflectance (band 4, 0.76–0.90 µm; and band 7, 2.08–2.35 µm) before the fire (5 June 2002)
and after the fire (7 July 2002). Values of dNBR were classified into general fire severity categories (Key and Benson 2005) based on
ranges that correspond with visible indications of fire damage to tree crowns. Unburned (dNBR ≤50), low (51–200, foliage still green),
moderate–low (201–350, green and brown foliage), moderate–high (351–605 mostly brown with some foliage consumed by fire), and
high (>605, complete consumption of foliage). Treatments reduced fire severity within treatment units (outlined in black) and in three
cases, marked by an arrow, outside the units on their lee side because heading fire spread was diverted; (d) historic fires greater than
78 ha (200 acres) within 30 years of the Rodeo–Chediski fire including the Carrizo (1971, 24 708 ha), Day (1974, 1056 ha), Cottonwood
(1976, 567 ha), Elks (1987, 247 ha), and White Springs (1996, 1663 ha).

ous dependent variable. The tree forms terminal nodes when
the fractional reduction in total error falls below a specified
limit, in this case 0.01. The procedure diagrams a hierarchy
of relative explanatory value of predictors within subsets of
the data without requiring an explicit nonlinear model form
to be specified. Thus, regression trees are becoming more
commonly used in modelling and exploring spatial data (Yang
et al. 2003; Lawrence and Labus 2003). Since the regression
tree analysis could not account for spatial autocorrelation of
the dNBR data (it has the same assumptions of data inde-
pendence as standard linear regression), the splits were eval-
uated for significance using the CAR analysis by including
dummy variables to distinguish the subgroups. Relative mean-
squared error was estimated for the regression tree (generally
scaled from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 indicates perfect agree-
ment) by methods of resubstitution (using mean-squared er-
ror (MSE) for the regression tree from the entire data set)
and cross-validation (using MSE for regression trees from
random subsamples of the data, which are cross-validated
with remaining subsamples).
Results
The spatial linear regression suggested dNBR of 30-m
pixels within treatments was significantly lower than outside
treated areas (Table 1). All coefficients were significant, sug-
gesting that fire severity in treated areas was positively re-
lated with time since treatment and negatively related to
number of repeated prescribed burns, treatment size, and dis-
tance from the edge of the treatment (Table 1). A low pro-
portion of variance was explained by linear functions of the

Fig. 3. The 30-m data from the Rodeo and Chediski wildfires are summarized to show single-factor treatment effects on burn severity
(differenced normalized burn ratio, dNBR). Standard error bars are included but may not be visible at every data point. (a) Severity in-
side treatments was less than untreated areas and decreased as a function of the time since treatment. (b) Mean dNBR (with standard
errors) decreased with distance inside the edge of treatments younger than 4 years old but not in older treatment units. (c) Mean
dNBR (with standard errors) decreased with the size of units for treatments older than 3 years. (d) Mean dNBR decreased significantly
with number of repeated prescribed fire treatments for those units treated 2–4 years and <2 years before the wildfire but not for treat-
ments conducted earlier (see Table 3).

fitted variables (0.073) compared with the spatial covariance
(0.444).
Further analysis with regression trees and spatial regres-
sion suggested fire severity responded differently to the inde-
pendent variables depending on time since treatment. Where
prescribed burning was conducted less than 4 years before
the wildfire, dNBR was consistently reduced in relation to
time since treatment (Fig. 2, nodes 4 and 6; Table 2; Fig. 3a).
In these recent treatments, dNBR was then reduced among
pixels located farther from the nearest treatment edge (Fig. 2,
node 12; Fig. 3b) and in units larger than 3.6 km2 (Fig. 2,
node 10). For treatments conducted 4 years or more prior to
the wildfire, dNBR decreased significantly for treatments
larger than about 8.5 km2 (Fig. 2; Table 2; Fig. 3c), except
between nodes 14 and 15 (Fig. 2), which corresponds with
particular data variability in treatment unit size around the
split point of about 10 km2 (Fig. 3c). Fire severity was re-
duced compared with untreated areas even in units treated
9 years before the wildfire, as indicated by a χ2 test among
severity categories in Fig. 3a (P < 0.001). The number of re-
peated treatments was not identified in the regression tree,
but spatial regression analysis suggested that dNBR decreased
significantly with more repeated treatments where the final
treatment occurred less than 4 years before the wildfire (Ta-
ble 3, Fig. 3d). The similarity of standard errors among
nodes in the regression tree suggests the data conformed to
assumptions of constant variance. The relative MSE of the
regression tree was estimated at 0.74 by methods of resub-
stitution and a ninefold cross-validation.
At the broadest landscape scale, effects of fuel treatments
were found in the fortuitous Landsat 7 (ETM+) overpass that
occurred at approximately 1100 h local time on 21 June
2002. This image provided a rare glimpse of the fire, as it
actively encountered and circumvented several of the fuel
treatment units. Unburned inclusions are visible within the
spreading fire (Fig. 1a), each displaying a chevron-shaped
edge on its leeward northern side. The largest of these inclusions
on White Mountain Apache land was found to correspond
with an area treated 3 years before the wildfire (Fig. 1b).
Smaller inclusions on the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest
each had the same shape characteristics and were each asso-
ciated with prescribed burn treatment units conducted 2 and
6 years before the Rodeo–Chediski fires. In all cases, the
chevron-shaped fire front occurred outside of the treatment
boundaries and downwind of the leeward treatment edge.
The image (Figs. 1a and 1b) also shows the right-angled east
flank of the wildfire was formed as the fire encountered a 1-
year-old treatment unit. Compared with adjacent untreated
lands, lower dNBR values appear within the leeward shadow
of the largest three large treatment units (Fig. 1c).
Discussion
Satellite data from the Rodeo–Chediski fires provided ex-
ceptionally clear examples of both stand-level and landscape-
level effects of prescribed fire fuel treatments in these south-
western ponderosa pine forests. The complete coverage and
large sample sizes of dNBR permitted analysis of fire sever-
ity in relation to stand-level variables including “time since
treatment” and number of repeated treatments. Broader-scale
effects of unit size and edge proximity would have been dif-
ficult and impractical to obtain for such large wildfires and
treatments from ground sampling alone. Nonlinear relation-
ships of all of treatment variables to fire severity were revealed
by the significance of the splits in the regression tree (Fig. 2;
Table 2) and low proportion of explained variance in the
spatial regression (Table 1). As with other studies relying on
remote sensing of operational fuel treatments (Weatherspoon
and Skinner 1995; Graham 2003), the high relative MSE of the
regression tree revealed that local fire effects were dependent
upon many factors not represented by the independent vari-
ables available. For landscape-level effects, information on
changes in fire movement caused by treatment units could
only be obtained by remote sensing.
The results of this study were consistent with reports from
more than a half-century of research showing reduced fire
severity following fuel treatment in ponderosa pine forests
(Weaver 1943; Kallander et al. 1955; Cooper 1961; Biswell
et al. 1973; Wagle and Eakle 1979; Pollet and Omi 2002;
Graham 2003; Schoennagle et al. 2004). Compared with
ground-based data, analysis of the satellite data suggested a
more complex picture of fuel treatment effects, including the
diminishing of treatment effectiveness over time (Fig. 3a), which
has been difficult to quantify and only rarely been docu-
mented (Biswell et al. 1973; van Wagtendonk and Sydoriak
1987). Repeated treatment was also related to lower fire se-
verity in more recent treatments (Table 3; Fig. 3d) but was
not represented in the regression tree. This suggested that
treatment history was less important than the characteristics
of the last treatment, including time since treatment and unit
size. Weak trends related to treatment history may partially
reflect the high variability in the data set in which treatments

occurred on irregular intervals and over inconsistent time
spans, some as long as five decades. But, the strong influ-
ence of the most recent treatment emphasizes the importance
of repeating treatments to maintain fuel conditions that miti-
gate wildfire severity.
The decreasing fire severity with distance from the treat-
ment edge and in larger units indicated the importance of
spatial scales broader than the local or stand level. Edge
proximity likely reflected the abrupt reduction of fireline in-
tensity as the fire moved from untreated areas into recent
treatments (Weatherspoon and Skinner 1995) (Fig. 3b). Re-
duced intensity is responsible for lower scorching and con-
sumption of tree crowns that are represented in dNBR fire
severity data. Recent treatments likely limited fire severity
more than older treatments, because patchy fuel accumula-
tion and vegetation recovery was not yet sufficient for in-
tense surface fire and initiation of crown fire (Van Wagner
1977). In units having treatment 1 year prior to the wildfire,
about 40% of the area was indicated in the dNBR data as re-
maining unburned (Fig. 3a), similar to reports by Wagle and
Eakle (1979) and Graham (2003). Thus, the regression tree
and spatial regression suggested that unit size was relatively
less important in these recent treatments than in older treat-
ments (Figs. 2 and 3c). The role of unit size in older treat-
ments may reflect the effects of greater fuel and topographic
heterogeneity that partially compensated for fuel recovery by
collectively slowing fire movement (Weatherspoon and Skinner
1995). The fine-scale “fingering” of the wildfire produced
by such heterogeneity has been shown to increase the pro-
portion of flanking and backing fire within the area as a
whole (Finney 2003), thus, reducing fireline intensities and
tree crown damage or ignition within the unit. The analysis
suggests that this effect was distinct from edge proximity,
which was only significant in treatments occurring less than
4 years before the wildfire. Larger treatment units also re-
quire longer burn times and, thus, better chances that weather
will moderate as the fire burns through these areas (e.g.,
wind shifts, nighttime).
All studies of fuel treatment effects on wildfire behavior
or severity are necessarily opportunistic, because large wildfires
cannot be set to experimentally test treatment performance.
This leads to high variance in treatment effects and typically
anecdotal kinds of information restricted to the stand level
(e.g., Biswell et al. 1973; Wagle and Eakle 1979; Helms
1979; Martin et al. 1989). Some of the variability in dNBR
in this study was likely related to the widespread, but un-
known, forest harvest and thinning activities that occurred
throughout the Tribal and Forest Service lands. Thinning and
harvesting can reduce vertical and horizontal continuity of
the tree canopy and limit initiation and spread of crown
fires, especially in conjunction with prescribed burning (van
Wagtendonk 1996; Stephens 1998; Graham et al. 2004). The
high variance and high relative MSE of the regression tree
likely reflects the combined influence of these and other fac-
tors not controllable or knowable for this study. For example,
we did not have site-specific information on stand structure,
the silvicultural or burning prescriptions within the treatment
units, or the wildfire characteristics as it crossed the location
of every 30-m pixel. Furthermore, the boundaries of the pre-
scribed fire units were largely independent of the many other
management activities that have occurred throughout the wild-
fire and treatment areas. Thus, the large size of the pre-
scribed burn units and inherent variability of prescribed fire
within the treated areas precludes a simple characterization
of the burn prescription or stand structure existing at the
time of the fire. The interaction of different harvesting and
burn combinations certainly warrants more study.
Some of the variations in dNBR outside the recorded
treatments were associated with past wildfires (Fig. 1d). In
particular, the Day Fire (1974) center-top, the Cottonwood
fire (1976) center-right, and the recent White Springs fire
(1996) within the larger Carrizo fire (1971, described by
Biswell et al. 1973) are coincident with apparently lower se-
verity in the Rodeo–Chediski fires. In these cases, the re-
duced dNBR likely results, because little forest vegetation
had developed by 2002 limiting the changes in NBR that
would be detectable between images taken before and after
the Rodeo–Chediski fires.
Evidence of landscape-level effects of treatment units was
visible at several places in the Landsat image from 21 June.
Most notably, the chevron-shaped holes within the actively
spreading fire resulted as a wake effect when the wildfire
flanked around the leeward side of the treatment units. Simi-
lar lee-side and adjacency effects were reported by Graham
(2003) and Weatherspoon and Skinner (1995). Fire growth
modeling has demonstrated the reasons for these chevron-
shaped fire growth patterns around slower-burning patches
(Richards and Bryce 1995; Finney 1998, 2001). By burning
more slowly than untreated stands, these recent treatments
disrupted fire growth, slowing local fire progress by divert-
ing it laterally. Lateral detours around the downwind sides of
treated areas burn by flanking and backing with much lower
intensity (Catchpole et al. 1982) and consequently produce
less crown damage (Van Wagner 1973, 1977) detectable by
the satellite imagery. Such diversions of fire spread are con-
sistent with assumptions of models of landscape-level treat-
ment effects (Finney 2001; Hirsch et al. 2001), where certain
patterns of treatment units efficiently retard fire growth across
a landscape by causing repeated diversions of fire growth.
Within the Rodeo–Chediski fires, however, the units were
not arranged to test or produce collective effects at the land-
scape level, and the units acted similarly to random patterns
that disrupt fire growth only when large fractions of the land-
scape are treated (Finney 2003; Bevers et al. 2004; Loehle
2004; Gill and Bradstock 1998). Even with random patterns,
decades of free-burning fires in large wilderness areas can
produce a jigsaw puzzle mosaic that becomes complete enough
to limit the growth of new fires (van Wagtendonk 1995;
Parsons and van Wagtendonk 1996; Rollins et al. 2001).
Landscape level effects of multiple units will depend on
complex spatial and temporal interactions between the fre-
quency of new or repeated treatment, the sizes of the units,
and the time-dependent lapsing of treatment benefits. The
single satellite image provided no opportunity to evaluate ef-
fects on fire spread rate of treatments conducted more than
3 years before the wildfire, although prescribed burning re-
duced fire severity for treatments through 9 years old. After
an unknown period of time, fuel recovery will probably al-
low fire spread rate and intensity to return to pretreatment
potential, but prescribed burns conducted on a regular cycle
would create a perpetual pattern of many recent and slow-
burning fuel patches (Kallander et al. 1955; Biswell et al.

1973; Wagle and Eakle 1979) that can collectively reduce
overall fire growth rates. Such mosaic treatments have long
been advocated as a landscape fuel management strategy
(Kallander et al. 1955; Brackebusch 1973; van Wagtendonk
1995; Gill and Bradstock 1998) to limit rapid fire spread
over large distances (Finney 2001; Hirsch et al. 2001) and
impose spatial heterogeneity consistent with presettlement
fire regimes (Kallander et al. 1955; Cooper 1960; Swetnam
and Baisan 1996; Fulé et al. 1997).
Conclusions
Data analyzed for this study suggested that fire growth and
severity of a large wildfire under extreme weather conditions
were mitigated by fuel treatments that included prescribed
burning. Longevity of treatment benefits was suggested to
improve with unit size, perhaps because the increased spatial
heterogeneity in larger units compensated for varying treat-
ment effects and fuel recovery. High-resolution satellite im-
agery of fire activity, although rare, revealed fuel treatments
in process of diverting fire movement. This is consistent
with modelling of landscape treatment patterns that indicates
overall fire growth and large fire sizes can be reduced (Finney
2001). The prescribed fire units analyzed here reflect the
commitment by land managers to implementing large-scale
prescribed burning for fuel treatment. Prescribed fire alone,
however, may not be sufficient to achieve structural goals of
forest restoration (Weaver 1943; Cooper 1960; Swetnam and
Baisan 1996; Fulé et al. 1997), although it will certainly be
necessary for long-term maintenance of ecological process.
