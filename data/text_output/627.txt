he U.S. Department of the 
Interior (USDI), National Park 
Service has been a leading 
agency in the application of both 
prescribed fire and wildland fire use 
(WFU) for resource benefits (van 
Wagtendonk 1991; Stephens and 
Ruth 2005).
In 2003, Grand Canyon National 
Park fire use modules managed the 
largest and most complex group 
of WFU fires in the park’s history, 
totaling more than 19,000 acres 
(7,690 ha) of North Rim old-growth 
forests that span from 7,300 to 
8,800 feet (2,225 to 2,682 m) in 
elevation.
Since 1997, 202 permanent plots 
have been established in Grand 
Canyon National Park to study the 
relationships between:
• Fire history,
• Forest structure,
• Fuel load, and
• Understory plant communities.
The 2003 North Rim fires burned 
83 plots across the entire eleva-
tion range, providing an excellent 
opportunity to evaluate low- to 
mixed-severity fire effects.

Three WFU Fires
In 2003, three lightning-initiated 
fires were managed by the USDI 
National Park Service as WFU fires 
to meet resource objectives:
1. The Powell Fire.  This low-
intensity surface fire occurred in 
lower montane ponderosa pine-
Gambel oak forest (see photo), 
which has burned naturally 
several times in the past century 
(Fulé and others 2002, 2003a). 
2. The Rose/Big Fire Complex.  
This was an intense surface fire

with high scorching in upper 
montane mixed-conifer forest, 
which has been invaded by fire-
intolerant white firs (Fulé and 
others 2004).
3. The Poplar Fire.  This was a 
mixed-severity fire in spruce–
fir–aspen forests that have not 
burned in more than a century, 
which is not out of the historic 
range of fire return intervals for 
subalpine forests (Turner and 
Romme 1994; Fulé and others 
2003b).
To evaluate fire effects—with fund-
ing from the six-agency partnership 
Joint Fire Science Program and 
the USDA Forest Service—we mea-
sured all of the permanent plots 
that burned in these three fires and 
nearby unburned reference plots. In 
each plot we:
• Recorded the species and diam-
eter of trees,
• Measured fuel loads using planar 
transects, and
• Measured plant cover and species 
composition of the understory 
plant community.

hree 2003 Grand Canyon 
National Park fires burned 83 
plots across the park’s North 
Rim old-growth forests that range 
from open ponderosa pine groves 
to dense spruce–fir–aspen stands 
at 7,300 to 8,800 feet (2,225 to 
2,682 m) elevation.
Ignited by lightning, these 
fires were managed by the U.S. 
Department of the Interior (USDI) 
National Park Service as wildland 
fire use (WFU) to meet resource 
objectives. As outlined below, they 
provided an excellent opportunity 
to evaluate low- to mixed-severity 
fire effects.
Forest Structure
The low-intensity fire in the 
ponderosa pine forest reduced 
total tree densities but did not 
significantly reduce total basal 
area because small trees (less than 
5 cm) were disproportionately 
killed. The mixed-severity fire 
in the spruce–fir–aspen forests

reduced both density and basal area 
of the forest and trees across all 
diameter classes.
Three of the 18 plots at high eleva-
tion incurred more than 90-percent 
tree mortality. Our permanent 
plots might underrepresent the 
actual proportion of high-sever-
ity fire in the Poplar Fire. Across 
all elevations, larger trees had a 
higher probability of survival than 
small trees. Pine and Douglas-fir 
had a higher probability of surviv-
ing the fire than aspen, white fir, 
Engelmann spruce, or subalpine fir.
Fuel Load
Forest floor depth (litter + duff) 
declined by an average of 43 per-
cent in the ponderosa pine forest 
and 64 percent in the spruce–fir–
aspen forests. Fine woody debris, 
material less than 3 inches (7.6 cm) 
in diameter, was also reduced by 
35 percent and 40 percent, respec-
tively. Coarse woody debris went 
down by an average of 40 percent 
in the ponderosa pine forest and 
60 percent in the spruce–fir–aspen 
forests.
After burning, coarse woody debris 
averaged 4 tons/acre (9t/ha) in the 
ponderosa forest and 10 tons/acre 
(22t/ha) in the spruce–fir–aspen 
forests. In contrast, unburned con-
trol sites increased in coarse woody 
debris loading over the same time 
period, reaching levels of 10 tons/
acre (22t/ha) in the ponderosa for-
est and 21 tons/acre (47t/ha) in the 
spruce–fir–aspen forests.
Understory Vegetation
In ponderosa pine forests, under-
story plant species richness and 
cover increased slightly 2 years 
after the fire, but was not much dif-
ferent than unburned forest. This 
suggests that old-growth ponderosa 
pine forest plant communities are 
resilient to changes in plant abun-
dance following surface fire.

land management agencies. They 
were successful, both in terms of 
logistical operations and ecological 
outcomes. Unless they can meet 
resource objectives, WFU fires are 
not allowed to burn.
Our study’s results suggest that 
many key objectives were met:
• Forest densities were reduced and 
large old-growth trees—especially 
from fire-resistant species—sur-
vived the fire much better than 
small, younger trees;
• Forest floor depth was reduced 
by 43 to 64 percent and coarse 
woody fuels were reduced by 40 
to 60 percent; and
• Native plant cover and richness 
were not harmed, though com-
munity composition was altered 
toward greater occurrence of 
native annual plants.
Fire effects were consistent with 
our general understanding of fire 
ecology in these systems. The low-
intensity fire at low elevation killed 
primarily small-diameter pines and 
oaks, whereas the mixed-intensity 
fires at high elevation burned with 
greater severity, killing trees across 
all diameter classes.

Changes in forest 
structure, fuel load, and 
plant diversity in burned 
and unburned ponderosa 
pine and spruce–fir–aspen 
forests before and after 
wildland fire use. 
The fire induced a shift in com-
munity composition toward greater 
occurrence of native annual forbs. 
The non-native annual cheatgrass 
(Bromus tectorum), which was 
present on Powell Plateau well 
before the fire, increased in fre-
quency across the plateau after the 
fire.
In spruce–fir–aspen forests, under-
story plant richness increased 
slightly in the burned forests 
whereas richness declined in the 
control. Community composition 
shifted dramatically toward greater 
occurrence of native annual forbs.
Plant species loss increased with 
fire severity, though most losses 
were short-lived. This suggests 
that plant richness and abundance 
recovered rapidly after the mixed-
severity fire in spruce–fir–aspen 
forests, but the composition of the 
community is still different than 
pre-fire conditions.

Some negative effects, however, 
also occurred. After the fire, the 
frequency of cheatgrass increased 
across the remote Powell Plateau. 
Cheatgrass has been noted at 
this site since as early as 1941 
(McDougall 1941). We detected a 
post-fire increase in the burned 
plots.
Native Ecosystem 
Dynamics
Land managers often face conflict-
ing objectives when managing for 
native ecosystem dynamics in a 
time of widespread exotic plant 
invasions (Keeley 2006). It is uncer-
tain whether cheatgrass could 
significantly affect the natural fire 
regime in ponderosa pine forests, 
but it can possibly reduce native 
plant cover and diversity over time.
Now that fuels and forest densities 
have been reduced by these fires, 
future ignitions can be managed 
more easily within these burns due 
to reduced fire intensities and more 
manageable fire behavior. Fires on 
the North Rim have consistently 
met resource objectives (Fulé and 
others 2004; Laughlin and others 
2004; Huisinga and others 2005), 
though non-native species inva-
sions and the loss of some old-
growth trees in mixed-severity fires 
are causes for continued monitor-
ing in the park.
The Grand Canyon’s never-har-
vested forests are an important 
resource for understanding rela-
tively undisturbed forest dynamics. 
Based on the results of the 2003 
fires, we recommend the continued 
use and monitoring of wildland fire 
in these old-growth forests where 
natural processes can still operate 
at landscape scales.
