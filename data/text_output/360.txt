Abstract-Dendroecological forest reconstnletion techniques are
used to estimate presettlement structure of northern Arizona pon-
derosa pine forests. To test the accuracy of these techniques, we
remeasured 10 of the oldest forest plots in Arizona, a subset of 51
historical plots established throughout the region from 1909 to
1913, and compared reconstruction outputs to historical data col-
lected. Results of this analysis revealed several distinct sources of
error: (1) After about 90 years, 94 percent of the recorded trees were
relocated and remeasured, but approximately three trees/ha were
missing in the field due to obliteration by fire or decay; (2) sizes of
trees living in 1909 were overestimated by an average of 11.9
percent; (3) snag and log decomposition models tended to un-
derestimate time since tree death by an undetermined amount; and
(4) historical sizes of cut trees were difficult to estimate due to
uncertainties concerning harvest dates. The aggregate effect of
these errors was to overestimate the number of trees occurring in
1909-1913. Sensitivity analysis applied to decomposition equations
showed variations in reconstructed sizes of snags and logs by :t 7
percent and stand density estimates by 7 percent. Results suggest
that these reconstruction techniques are robust but tend to overes-
timate tree size and forest density.
ecological function (Covington and Moore 1994a). Associ-
ated biomass accumulation and the development of fuel
ladders represent extreme fire hazards and expose these
forests to an increased potential for stand-replacing crown
fires. Restoration of ecological processes and structure holds
promise for reestablishing indigenous levels of biological
diversity arid ecological function in northern Arizona ponde-
rosa pine forests (Covington and Moore 1994b; Covington
and others 1997).
Treatments designed to restore ponderosa pine ecosys-
tems are based on an understanding of presettlement struc-
tural and compositional characteristics that are collectively
known as reference conditions. Forest reconstruction is one
tool used to estimate reference conditions. Techniques for
reconstruction include dendrochronological measurement
of fire scars and increment cores from stumps, logs, and
living trees, direct measurement of remnant woody evi-
dence, and backwards radial growth modeling (Fule and
others 1997). Forest structural information generated by
reconstruction includes past diameter distribution and stand
density estimates. The precision of these analyses is highly
dependent on field identification of pre settlement evidence,
dendrochronological proficiency, and relationships utilized
in "reverse" growth and decay modeling. Our objective in
this study was to use data from historically measured forest
plots to test the precision of our forest reconstruction tech-
niques. Specifically, we wanted to (1) test our ability to
identify historically measured trees in the field, (2) compare
reconstruction model outputs such as stand density and tree
sizes to historical data, and (3) identify key sources of error
associated with the reconstruction process.
I ntrod uction
Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Douglas ex P. Lawson &
Lawson) forest ecosystems in northern Arizona have under-
gone dramatic physiognomic changes over the past 120
years (Covington and Moore 1994a; Covington and others
1997; Fule and others 1997). Logging, fire suppression, and
overgrazing in the latter part of the 19th century created
conditions suitable for a population explosion of pine regen-
eration. Open parklike stands, maintained by frequent sur-
face fires prior to Euro-American settlement (about 1876) of
the region, have been replaced by closed canopied forests
with resulting deleterious effects on biological diversity and
Background
Between 1909 and 1913, a series of 51 permanent plots
were established within the ponderosa vegetation type
throughout Arizona and New Mexico (Woolsey 1911,1912).
The purpose of these plots was to increase understanding of
western yellow pine (now ponderosa) growth, regeneration,
and management. These are the oldest known ponderosa
pine sample plots in the Southwest. Plots of around 1 to 6 ha
(2 to 14 acres) were established on areas where up to two-
thirds of the standing overstory volume had recently been
harvested. The permanently marked plots were subdivided
into 20 m (66 ft) grids wherein all trees greater than 10.16
cm (4 inches) in diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) (1.4 m)
were mapped. Measurements for these trees included d.b.h.,

remeasured these plots every 5 years until the studies were
abandoned around 1934-1939. In the mid-1990s, we began
to uncover the historical data and maps associated with the
"Woolsey" plots. In 1996, we initiated a project to relocate
and remeasure as many of the historic plots as possible. By
2000, we had remeasured and applied reconstruction analy-
sis to 15 plots. This paper describes the results of analysis of
10 plots located near Flagstaff, Arizona.
Methods
Study Area
The 10 historical plots used in this study are within a 24-
kIn radius of Flagstaff (35°8'N latitude, 111°40'W longi-
tude), Arizona, on the Coconino National Forest (fig. 1).
Elevation at the sites ranged from around 2,100 to 2,200 m.
Average annual precipitation in the area is 50.3 cm with
about half falling in winter as snow and the other as rain
associated with a mid-summer monsoon pattern. Mean
annual temperature is 7.5 °C. The soil of the area is a stony
clay loam of basalt derivation.
Ponderosa pine is the dominant overstory species of the
area often occurring in pure stands or mixed with Gambel
oak (Quercusgambelii Nutt.). Important understory species
include grasses, Festuca arizonica Vasey, Muhlenbergia
montana (N utt.) Hitchc., Blepharoneuron tricholepis (Torr.)
Nash, and Sitanion hystrix (Nutt.) J.G. Smith, and forbs,
Achillea millefolium var. occidentalis D.C., Pseudocymop-
terus montanus (Gray) Coult. & Rose, Erigeron divergens
Torr & Gray, and Potentilla crinita Gray. Shrubs are not
common but include scattered populations of Ceanothus
fendleri Gray and Rosa woodsii Lindl.
Remeasurement of Historical Plots
The 10 plots, originally established in 1909 (eight plots)
and 1913 (two plots) were remeasured in 1997-1999. We

used copies of the stem maps drawn in 1915 to relocate plot-
corners and grid intersections. Although the historical plots
ranged in size, we standardized our methods to remeasure
subplots of 1.02 ha (2.5 acres), systematically originating
from the northwest corners of the original plots. After
consulting historical maps to determine plot orientation, we
used a transit, staff compass, and tape to reestablish the
original grid system as truly as possible. Subplots con-
sisted of 25 grid cells of approximately 404 m2 each. Mter
subplots were established, 1915 maps were not referenced
again until after remeasurement had been completed. Due
to the size of the subplots, results presented here are inter-
preted in terms of trees per hectare.
Grid cells within subplots were thoroughly searched and
all structures equal to or greater than 1.4 m in height, either
presently or at some past time, were numbered and tagged.
Tree structures included live trees, snags, logs, stumps, and
stump holes. Diameter at breast height (d.b.h.; measured at
1.4 m above the ground) and/or diameter at stump height
(d.s.h.; measured at 40 cm), total tree height, condition class
(1-9), and age class (presettlement, "preplot", or postsettle-
ment; see below) were recorded for all tree structures. For
stump holes, d.s.h. was estimated. Tree condition classes
followed a classification system commonly used in ponde-
rosa pine forests (Maser and others 1979; Thomas and others
1979). The nine classes were as follows: (1) live, (2) fading,
(3) recently dead, (4) loose bark snag, (5) clean snag, (6) snag
broken above breast height, (7) snag broken below breast
height, (8) dead and down, and (9) cut stump.
In the field, age classifications were based on tree size and
bark characteristics and then verified when possible in the
laboratory. Tree ages were grouped in the field into three
categories: presettlement, preplot, and postplot. Structures
greater than 37.5 cm d.b.h., clearly yellow-barked, or dead,
large, and highly decayed, were presumed to be greater than
100 years old (White 1985) and classified as presettlement in
age. We classified trees as "preplot-aged" (in other words,
established prior to historical plot measurement) if they did
not meet presettlement classification criteria (for example,
did not have yellow bark) but were larger than a predeter-
mined size. Preplot size was determined for individual
subplots by measuring diameter and field aging a sample
(10) of nearby trees. Ponderosa pine with bark appearing
transitional in age between yellow barked and black barked
trees were located just outside the subplot boundaries and
cored at 40 cm. Ring counts were made and the results were
compared with the plot establishment date. The average
diameter of trees within 10 years of the plot establishment
date was used as the preplot size cutoff. Live trees of this size
or larger without yellow bark were classified as preplot-
aged. In some cases, preplot size was not different than
presettlement (37.5 cm at d.b.h.) and classification was
made based on bark characteristics. Trees with black bark
and smaller than the minimum presettlement and preplot
diameters were classified as postplot.
Diameter at stump height and crown radius (average of
two measurements) was measured for all presettlement and
preplot ponderosa pine trees. For species other than ponde-
rosa pine, d.s.h. was measured on all trees. Increment cores
were collected at 40 cm for all trees greater than 37.5 cm
d.b.h. and for oak and juniper species greater than 17 cm.
Additionally, increment cores were collected and d.s.h. and

crown radius was measured for a 20 percent random sub-
sample of live postplot (all species) trees. Increment cores
were stored in paper straws until denrochronological analy-
sis could be done in the laboratory. Dendrochronological
analysis involved cross-dating cores (Stokes and Smiley
1996) against known annual ring patterns (Graybill 1987)
and measuring radial increments from the year prior to core
collection (1997-1999) to the year of plot establishment
(1909-1913). Radial increments to fire exclusion date (1876;
Fule and others 1997) were also measured. Our age classifi-
cation scheme was designed to assure that detailed data,
including increment cores, were coliected for all trees that
were historically measured or presettlement in age. It also
allowed comparisons to be made regarding changes in age
structure on these plots since establishment.
Thus, five model iterations were done for each subplot
reconstructed to historical establishment dates. Size errors
were calculated as follows: Error = (Reconstructed 
d.b.h. -
Historical d.b.h./ Historical d.b.h.) * 100.
Results
Field Identification of Historical Trees
Nearly all the trees mapped and recorded in 1909 and
1913 were found on the 10 subplots (table 1). The number of
trees missed ranged from 0 to 9 and the overall error rate was
5.7 percent. Historical trees were found in all condition
classes from highly decomposed remnant structures to live
trees still bearing 90-year-old tags. Frequently, missed trees
were highly decomposed and little evidence was observable.
A high rate of identification was possible although dense
stand conditions existed at the time of subplot remeasure-
ment (1997-1999); there was an average of 1,379 total
structures acrosS the 10 subplots. No clear relationship was
observed between the number of trees missed and the
number that were historically measured. However, the
greatest number of trees were missed on the subplot with the
greatest total number of structures at remeasurement.
Analyses
Reconstruction Model
Historical Tree Diameter-Diameter reconstruction of
historical trees that were still alive at remeasurement over-
estimated d.b.h. by an average ofll.9 percent (table 2). We
found a slight trend of increased error for smaller trees
(fig. 2). There were no subplots on which tree diameter was
underestimated. Unexpectedly large errors (greater than 60
percent) resulted for diameter reconstruction of unusually
fast- or slow-growing trees for which increment data were
unavailable (rotten tree centers, incomplete cores, and so
forth).
Field Identification 
of Historical 
Trees-Historical
trees were identified in the field by noting tree locations
displayed on 1915 maps and examining structures mea-
sured on subplots. Historical trees not measured on subplots
(in other words, missed during remeasurement) were noted
and the error rate was calculated as follows: Error = (number
missed/number on historical map) * 100. A weighted aver-
age for error incorporating all 10 plots was calculated as
follows: Error = (total number missed over all subplots/total
number of historical trees over all subplots) * 100.
Reconstruction 
Modeling-Field 
measurements and
increment core data were entered into a computerized stand
reconstruction model (Covington and others, unpublished).
The model applies a series of mathematical functions to field
data in order to estimate tree diameters (d.b.h.) and death
dates for a particular point in time that is defined by the
user. Growth functions employed were gleaned from empiri-
cal growth (Myers 1963) and decay studies (Rogers and
others 1984) of Southwestern ponderosa pine as well as
other species. Sizes of live trees for which increment cores
were collected were reconstructed by subtracting twice the
radial increment from field recorded tree diameters. Sizes of
trees for which no cores were collected or for which core data
were unusable were estimated by applying "reverse" growth
functions. Dead trees were moved backward through decay
classes (Maser and others 1979; Thomas and others 1979)
until an estimated death date was reached, before which the
reverse growth function was applied. Separate equations
were used for blackjack and yellow pine age classes. For cut
trees (stumps) measured in the field, trees were grown in
reverse prior to a cut date that we defined in the model.
For our analyses, we compared stand density and tree
diameter output from the reconstruction model with data
available from the historical ledgers. Because data in his-
toricalledgers was restricted to trees greater than or equal
to 10.16 cm d.b.h., we limited our analysis of stand density
to trees of this size. To test reconstruction sensitivity, we
varied cut date and decay rate parameters in the model.
Cut dates of 1910 (1914 for the two plots established in
1913),1945, and 1980 were tested for field-measured stumps,
and dead/down trees were moved backward through decay
classes at rates corresponding to the 25th, 50th, and 75th
percentiles found in other studies (Roger and others 1984).

Error for diameter reconstruction of historical trees that
were dead and down at remeasurement averaged -0.6 per-
cent (table 3). Sensitivity analysis showed that dead and
down were most accurately reconstructed when moved
through decay classes at the 50th percentile rate. Varying
decay rate to the 25th percentile slowed movement through
decay classes, resulting in earlier estimated death dates and
a greater overestimate of historical diameters. Conversely,
decay rate set to the 75th percentile sped movement through
decay classes, resulting in later estimated death dates and
an underestimate of historical diameters. Thus, varying
decomposition rates altered size estimates by approximately
7 percent. Due to limited sample sizes for most plots, the
overall average was heavily influenced by subplot S2A.

Diameter reconstruction of historical trees that had been
cut since original plot establishment (1909-1913) was most
accurate when the cut date in the model was set to 1980
(table 4). This was true for every subplot except S4A for
which diameter estimates were most accurate when the cut

related to initial or present density of forest structures
emerged to affect identification 
success. Identification 
of
presettlement-aged structural evidence is important for imple-
menting ecological restoration prescriptions in northern
Arizona ponderosa pine forests (Covington and others 1997).
The reconstruction model tested in this analysis tended
to overestimate tree diameters for live trees (11.9 percent),
slightly underestimate (~O.6 percent) dead and downed
trees, and overestimate trees that had been cut (11.4 per-
cent). For live trees, slightly greater inaccuracies were
produced for smaller size classes. Possible explanations for
live-tree errors include model equations used to predict bark
thickness and d.b.h. from d.s.h. (Myers 1963; Hann 1976),
unusable increment cores, particularly for trees that were
especially fast- or slow-growing, and eccentricity of tree bases.
Although prediction of tree death date is difficult due to
factors affecting snag longevity and condition, the d.b.h. esti-
mates provided by the reconstruction model were relatively
accurate. Accuracy here was likely affected by the interac-
tion of death date estimates and reverse growth functions.
In our analysis, global cut dates were set in the model,
although in reality, trees on the subplots were not all cut in
the same year. This undoubtedly affected d.b.h. reconstruc-
tion errors. Cut dates for harvested "cohorts" could be
individually coded in the model using additional informa-
tion not examined in this study such as harvest records and
stump decay classes.
Overestimation of d.b.h. coupled with death date and cut
date uncertainties lead to overestimates of past tree density.
However, our reconstruction techniques allowed reductions
of these estimates based on increment core data and sizes of
cut trees. Refinement of decay functions may allow better
accuracy in stand density reconstruction.
The reconstruction techniques evaluated in this study
appear to be robust and useful for estimating past forest
structural characteristics. Although the model was used
generally, adjustments could be made for specific sites using
relationships developed from site-specific field data. The
reconstruction techniques allow a better understanding of
reference conditions in ponderosa pine forests of the South-
west. Further analysis will be done to reconstruct presettle-
ment structural conditions on these plots.
establishment to be mapped, (3) trees that had died or been
cut prior to plot establishment, and (4) large trees for which
no increment core data existed. Tree density estimates were
also affected by variations in decay functions used in the
model. Varying the rate at which dead and downed material
moved through decay class by 25 percent altered estimated
tree densities by approximately 7 percent.
To more clearly evaluate reconstructed tree densities
(1945 cut date and 50th decay percentile) we subtracted
large cut trees that were not historically recorded, as well as
trees for which increment core center dates were less than
plot establishment dates. We presumed these to represent
trees cut prior to plot establishment and trees too small to be
historically measured, respectively. Subtraction resulted
in tree density overestimates of 10-51 trees per subplot
(table 5). Trees reconstructed in excess of historical densi-
ties were mainly dead and down trees for which death dates
were inaccurately estimated.

Conclusions
Evaluation of reconstruction techniques revealed several
key sources of error. These included field identification of
historical trees, size reconstruction of live trees, and deter-
mination of tree death dates. Forest structures on the
subplots were readily identified in the field after:!: 90 years.
Missed trees resulted in an underestimate of stand density
by 5.7 percent or about three trees per hectare. Factors not
addressed in this analysis but that may affect success rate of
identification include disturbance such as fire, time, and
experience level of personnel. Very little disturbance, Qut-
side of individual tree selection harvest, occurred on the
subplots in this study. Intense fire had not occurred on any
of the subplots since establishment and precommercial thin-
ning had occurred only in 83A and 83B. No clear pattern
