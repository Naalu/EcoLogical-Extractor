Ecological Restoration Institute, Forest Restoration Education and Training Land Manager Survey 2003 
I. METHODOLOGY 
Survey Content 
The Ecological Restoration Institute (ERl) at Northern Arizona University commissioned 
the Social Research Laboratory (SRL) to create and administer a telephone survey of land 
managers in the Southwest, primarily in Arizona and New Mexico. The purpose of the 
study was to gauge the demand for training and education of land managers in ecological 
restoration of forested lands in the region. The SRL and the ERl collaboratively designed 
a survey instrument. In addition to determining the level of interest in further ecological 
restoration education, the survey also investigated preferred types of education, delivery 
methods (web-based, classroom or field-based), the access respondents have to 
technology, the best timing for educational programs, the preferred location for 
classroom-based workshops or field-based sessions, the preferred length of workshops, 
perceived employer support for the programs, and levels of interest in particular subject 
areas for future ecological restoration education and training. 
The target respondent for this study is a land manager or administrator currently involved 
in ecological restoration and interested in professional development opportunities in this 
field. Two initial screening questions determined whether respondents met these criteria. 
The land managers work in areas that include both ponderosa pine and other types of 
forests and ecosystems common to the Southwest. 
Data Base Construction 
The SRL created a database of land managers affiliated with the National Park Service 
(NPS), Arizona and New Mexico State Land Departments (AZSLD and NMSLD 
respectively), Bureau of Land Management (BLM) , Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), 
Arizona Game and Fish Department (AZGFD) and the New Mexico Forestry Division 
(NMFD). From each agency, the SRL requested contact information for land managers 
within New Mexico and Arizona. Also included in the database were a small number of 
land managers located in southern Colorado, Utah and Texas. 
In order to compile a comprehensive database, the SRL included land managers from 
various agencies involved in forest restoration. A "snowball" sampling methodology was 
employed using known contacts to identify other potential contacts. 
A telephone 
protocol was developed for use in explaining the project to perspective respondents (see 
Appendix I). Regional and state offices were initially contacted to determine the best 
method of obtaining prospective respondents' contact information. If agencies requested 
written validation, the following documents were sent: 1) a letter outlining the purpose of 
the survey and how information would be used; and, 2) a copy of the survey instrument. 
This correspondence was sent upon request to the United States Forest Service, Bureau of 
Land Management, New Mexico State Land Department and New Mexico Game and 
Fish Department. The SRL relied on various methods to compile an extensive database 
The Social Research Laboratory, Northern Arizona University 

Ecological Restoration Institute. Forest Restoration Education and Training Land Manager Survey 2003 
of contact information. In some instances, a complete list of contacts was sent to the SRL 
from a central location such as a regional office. In other cases, the SRL was provided 
with lists of supervisors who oversee land managers in specific regions. These 
supervisors were contacted and asked to provide contact information for land managers 
from each office. A total of 268 names with contact information were submitted by 
cooperating agencies. 
Agencies cooperated with the request for contact information, with the exception of the 
New Mexico Fish and Game Department (NMFGD) and the U. S. Forest Service (USFS). 
The NMDFG and the USFS declined to participate in the study for similar reasons -- both 
agencies felt that completing a telephone survey would be too time-consuming for their 
employees. Although the USFS declined to participate in a telephone survey, the agency 
did agree to allow its employees to complete an e-mail or Internet-based version of the 
survey. 
Initially, staff at the SRL designed an e-mail survey in .pdf format, enabling respondents 
to access and complete the survey on their personal computer and submit their responses 
directly to the SRL (see Appendix 1). After reviewing the final .pdf instrument, staff at 
the SRL decided this format would be too complicated and decided to use a web survey 
format that would be accessible through a web link. Respondents could access the survey 
and submit their responses through the web (see Appendix K). Ultimately, the USFS 
revoked its participation in the project and the web surveys were not utilized. This 
resulted in the loss of potential data from surveys of 80 land managers. 
Individual National Park Service parks in Arizona and New Mexico were contacted by 
the SRL in order to reach land managers involved in ecological restoration. The NPS had 
relatively few land managers within Arizona and New Mexico involved in ecological 
restoration, due to the small number of employees in each park and its geographic 
location. Many of the parks had only one or two land managers involved in ecological 
restoration. Additionally, some parks were located in areas that are not conducive to 
ecological restoration practices and principles. The National Park Service submitted 
contacts for 24 land managers. 
The Bureau of Indian Affairs and Bureau of Land Management sent lists to the SRL from 
a regional office and a field office, respectively. The BIA faxed the most comprehensive 
list of all of their employees in the Southwest Region. The BLM submitted a list of 
employees primarily located in the Arizona Strip, Lake Mead National Recreation Area 
and parts of southern Utah. The Bureau of Land Management submitted 58 contacts, and 
the Bureau of Indian Affairs provided 95. Upon receipt of both lists, contacts from BIA 
and BLM were entered and included in the database. 
The SRL contacted the head supervisor at the Arizona Game and Fish Department by 
telephone and informed him of the project. He sent a list of e-mail addresses of six main 
supervisors of Arizona offices to the SRL. 
The SRL e-mailed a request to each 
supervisor, who then replied with names and phone numbers of the land managers who 
worked in their divisions. The Arizona Game and Fish Department submitted contacts 
The Social Research Laboratory, Northern Arizona University

for 34 employees. 
The main supervisors from the New Mexico State Land Department offices were reached 
via telephone. Through e-mail, the New Mexico State Land Department provided contact 
information for 20 land managers to the SRL. 
The Arizona State Land Department submitted their contacts to ERl, which was 
forwarded to the SRL. The AZSLD submitted contacts for seven managers. 
After receiving a letter of request from the ERl, The New Mexico Forestry Division sent 
a letter with the names of its land managers. This list was forwarded to the SRL and 
entered into the database. 
The New Mexico Forestry Division provided contact 
information for 30 land managers. 
Fielding the Survey 
At the initiation of this study and before the fielding of the survey, the project was 
submitted to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at NAU and approved through the IRB 
process. Once fielding of the survey had begun, the SRL regularly submitted progress 
reports to the Ecological Restoration Institute. After receiving the first set of progress 
reports, ERl requested that additional questions be added to the survey to clarify a few of 
questions that emerged during survey fielding. After 34 surveys had been completed, the 
SRL added four questions, developed by ERl (7b1, 7cl, 7d1 and 32a) to the survey and 
used the new version for the subsequent 58 completed surveys [Both versions of the 
survey are found in Appendix L]. 
The surveys were conducted over the telephone by a group of trained and experienced 
interviewers. 
In general , respondents were willing to take the survey and share 
information with the interviewers. At the beginning of the phone call, respondents were 
informed of the purpose of the study and the sponsor. They were assured that all of their 
answers were voluntary and confidential and would only be reported as a group response. 
Respondents were screened to determine whether they qualified for the survey as a land 
manager or an administrator involved in ecological restoration with an interest in 
professional development opportunities in ecological restoration. 
If the respondent 
requested more information regarding ERl, the interviewers were trained to give the 
respondent a scripted synopsis of ERl's mission and goals. [See Appendix L, p. 1]. At the 
end of the survey, respondents were asked whether they were interested in learning more 
about a variety of restoration topics. If the respondent did not understand the meaning or 
context of the topic areas , interviewers read definitions of the topic areas provided by 
ERl [See Appendix M]. 
In order to gather an adequate data set and complete the study, a goal was set to 
administer 172 surveys. 
Although 172 surveys was the initial target, the lack of 
participation by the USFS and the subsequent omission of 80 completes resulted in a 
smaller final "n" size. At the completion of fielding, 92 surveys had been administered. 
Seventeen completes were obtained from the National Park Service; Arizona and New 
The Social Research Laboratory, Northern Arizona University 
3 

Ecological Restoration Institute, Forest Restoration Education and Training Land Manager Survey 2003 
Mexico State Land Departments produced two and six completes, respectively; 16 
surveys were completed by the Bureau of Land Management; 24 completes were 
obtained from the Bureau of Indian Affairs; 11 surveys were administered to Arizona 
Department of Fish and Game land managers; and lastly, 16 surveys were completed by 
the New Mexico Forestry Division. 
Report Layout 
Appendices A-H contain verbatim responses to open-ended questions on the survey. For 
ease of use, appendices are arranged in one or more of the following ways: I) top 
choices, 2) region, and 3) alphabetically. Appendices I-N contain telephone recruitment 
protocol, surveys in multiple formats, definitions of the topic areas and data entry 
protocol. Also, Appendix 0 includes additional comments that were captured by the 
interviewers. These are comments made by the respondents in addition to answering a 
question and include the question number for reference. 
Data Analysis 
Survey question responses were recorded on paper and the data was entered into a 
Filemaker database file, designed to maximize accuracy and ease of entry of survey data 
into a database format. A protocol for data entry was developed and monitored to assure 
the accuracy and consistency of data entry [see Appendix N]. Trained and experienced 
coders entered the survey data. In order to assure coder accuracy and reliability, all 
entries were double-checked by a different coder. Once the information was entered into 
Filemaker, the data was imported into a statistical software package (SPSS) for further 
analysis. 
This report includes an annotated questionnaire that presents the survey questions, as well 
as descriptive statistics that relate the number of responses to each question. 
Due to 
rounding, percentages may not always total 100 percent. Additionally, if the respondent 
declined to answer a question, responses were coded as "missing" in the data set and 
omitted from calculations for valid percentages. 
Study Limitations 
In order for the results to be representative of the population and statistically valid, all 
land managers from the various agencies would have to be represented within the sample 
with an equal chance of being selected for the study. 
A "snowball" sampling 
methodology is not inclusive of all of the land managers from the various agencies in the 
Southwest. Therefore, the information in this report can be used for descriptive purposes 
only. The results cannot be inferred to the general population of land managers in the 
Southwest.

TRAINING FORMATS 
Web-based Education and Training 
A majority (80%) of all respondents are interested in web-based education or training programs. 
Among those interested in web-base educational or training programs, 84 percent prefer a short­
term (2-4 week) training program. 
Among those interested in a short-term web-based training program, most (66%) prefer a short­
term program offered "two to three times per year." Nineteen percent prefer a short-term 
program offered only "one time per year," and 15 percent would like programs offered "four or 
more times per year" [See Executive Summary Addendum for additional graphic display of data, 
Figure AI, pg.16]. 1

According to respondents interested in short-term training, the best time of year to complete the 
program is in the "winter" (51%), followed by "fall" (29%), "summer" (14%) and lastly, 
"spring" (7%) [see Executive Summary Addendum, Figure A2, p. 16]. 
Respondents interested in web-based training programs were asked how likely they would be to 
use "up-to-date, web-based information and downloads." The majority (91%) said they were 
likely to utilize web-based information, and 92% said they would be likely to utilize "up-to-date 
web-based tutorials, one to two hours in length" (see Figure 4). Eighty-five percent of 
respondents said it is important that web delivered programs be interactive (see Figure 5).

Eighty-five percent of respondents are interested in classroom-based educational workshops. 
Those interested in classroom programs were asked about the ideal location to conduct a 
workshop. Just over half of this group (56%) would like to attend the classroom workshop at "a 
location that is not close to Northern Arizona University (NAU); " 4 I percent said "an area near 
NAU and Flagstaff' would be the best location [Refer to Appendix C for a list of locations that 
are not near NAU and Flagstaff. See Executive Summary Addendum, Figure A3, p. 17].

A majority of all land managers or administrators (62%) said they would like to see a classroom­
based workshop offered "two to three times a year." Twenty-eight percent of land managers and 
administrators would only like to see it offered "one time per year," and 10 percent of 
respondents are in favor of the workshop being offered "four or more times a year" [See 
Executive Summary Addendum, Figure AI, p. 16]. 
A majority (89%) of those interested in a classroom-based program believe the ideal length of 
classroom-based training should be between "two to four days." Six percent said they preferred 
it to last "five to seven days" and three percent said an ideal length would be "one day or less" 
[see Executive Summary Addendum, Figure A4, p. 17]. 
Respondents prefer participating in 
classroom workshops in the "winter" (37%), and the "fall " (32%) [see Executive Summary 
Addendum, Figure A2, p. 16]. 
Field-based Education and Training 
Most respondents (96%) are interested in participating in field-based training and education 
workshops. Respondents interested in field-based training and education workshops were asked 
about the ideal location for these trainings. A majority (57%) of this group prefers "a location 
that is not close to NAU." Thirty-nine percent prefer an "area near NAU and Flagstaff' and the 
remaining five percent have no preference. [A list of field-based training sites can be found in 
Appendix D. Refer to Appendix E for a list of reasons why respondents selected these locations 
as ideal field-based training sites. See Executive Summary Addendum, Figure A3, p. 17]. 
The majority (84%) of respondents interested in field-base training and education programs 
would like to see the training programs last "two to four days." A much small number of 
respondents (8%) thought field-based training should last "one day or less" and 5 percent said a 
"five to seven day" program would be ideal [see Executive Summary Addendum, Figure A4, p. 
17]. 
Almost half (49%) of respondents interested in field-based training would like to see trainings 
take place in the "fall." Twenty-nine percent prefer to have the training in the "spring" [see 
Executive Summary Addendum, Figure A2, p. 16]. 
Preparation for Classroom or Field-based Training 
Most respondents (94%) are interested in the combination of classroom and field-based training 
programs. Respondents interested in classroom or field-based trainings were asked how willing 
they would be to complete 20 hours of self-paced preparatory work before participating in the 
programs. Thirty-three percent said they would be "very willing" and 51 percent said they 
would be "somewhat willing" to complete the preparatory studies (see Figure 7). Fifteen percent 
said they were "somewhat unwilling" and only one percent said they would be "very unwilling" 
to engage in 20 hours of preparatory studies.

would be "very wilIing" and just over half (51%) said they would be "somewhat wilIing" to 
complete the I0 hours of post-work (see Figure 7). Sixteen percent of respondents said they 
would be "somewhat unwilIing," while two percent would be "very unwilling" to complete 10 
hours of studies after attending a field-based training program. 
College Credit for Training and Education Programs 
Figure 8: Preferred Courses for 
College Credit 
Over half (58%) of alI land managers and administrators 
expressed interest in receiving college credit for attending 
educational programs while 41 percent said they were not 
interested in this option. Of the respondents who said 
they were interested in college credit, most (81%) would 
like to receive credit for taking web-based formal courses 
(see Figure 8). Fifteen percent are interested in taking 
formal courses at NAU, and four percent of the 
respondents are wilIing to participate in both types of 
courses. 
EMPLOYER SUPPORT 
Land managers were asked how supportive their employers would be of taking time off to attend 
restoration-training programs. Fifty-seven percent said their employer would be "somewhat 
supportive" and 28 percent stated that their employer would be "very supportive" (see Figure 9).

"very likely" or "somewhat likely" to receive support (see Figure 10). When administrators 
were asked the same question, all replied that they would financially support their employees. 
Respondents who were both land managers and administrators answered similarly to the 
administrators, with 94 percent likely to offer financial support to their employees. A small 
portion of this group (6%) stated they would be "not very likely" to financially support their 
employees.

Land managers estimated their employers would be willing to pay between "$100-$200" (34%) 
and "$200-$300" (38%) to attend an ecological restoration workshop (see Figure 11). 
Administrators selected either the "$200-$300" (30%) or the "$400-$500" (25%) range as 
monetary support for their employees to attend these programs. The majority of respondents, 
who are both administrators and land managers, chose "$200-$300" (20%), "$300-$400" (33%), 
and "$400-$500" (20%) categories.

INTEREST IN TOPICS FOR FUTURE RESTORATION EDUCATION 
In general, land managers and administrators expressed interest in learning more about various 
ecological restoration subject areas. Of the ten topic areas offered to respondents, most are 
interested in learning more about "Components of Healthy Ecosystems" (95%), "Basics of 
Ecological Restoration" (91%), "Fire Ecology" (90%) and "Management Applications" (89%) 
(see Figure 14).

DEMOGRAPHICS OF RESPONDENTS 
Forest Type 
Slightly more than half (54%) of the 92 land managers and administrators reported currently

The remaining 46 percent reported working in "other types of forests." In the last five years, a 
slightly larger percentage (60%) of respondents primarily worked in "ponderosa pine forests" or 
"both ponderosa pine forests and other types of forests equally." Forty percent of the remaining 
respondents said that they primarily worked in other types of forest types in the last five years. In 
the next five years, 64 percent plan on primarily working in either "ponderosa pine forests" or 
"both ponderosa pine forests and other types of forests equally." Thirty-six percent of the 
respondents reported that they plan on working in "other types of forests" in the next five years.

Over half (52%) of the land managers and administrators have worked in ecological restoration 
for "more than 10 years." Only 7 percent of respondents have worked in restoration for "less 
than one year" [Refer to Appendix H for the respondent's primary work location]. 
Respondents ranged in age from 24 to 63 years old. Thirteen percent of respondents were 24-33 
years of age; 29 percent were 34-43 years old. Most respondents (45%) were 44-53 years of age. 
Similar to the youngest age range, 13 percent were 54-63 years of age. 
Education 
Almost all of land managers and administrators have a bachelor's degree (99%) and 30 percent 
have a post-bachelor's degree. 
Income 
Fifty-eight percent of respondents earn between "$30,000 and $75,000." Thirty-nine percent of 
land managers and administrators earn "more than $75,000." Only four percent of respondents 
earned "less than $30,000."

IV. Annotated Questionnaire 
Hello, may I speak with 
? (state first and last name ofperson on the list) 
If the person does not work there any longer. .. · 
•  May I speak with the person in the position of 
? -or­
•  Can I speak with a person in your office that is a land manager and is involved in ecological 
restoration? 
Introduction: 
Hello, my name is (state your first name and last name) and I'm calling from Northern Arizona 
University on behalf of the Ecological Restoration Institute. I am not selling anything. As you may 
know, the Ecological Restoration Institute, known as ERI, at Northern Arizona University, works to 
restore degraded forests in dry, fire adapted ecosystems in the western United States. ERI is interested 
in efficiently providing information to land managers or administrators involved in forest restoration. 
Your feedback will assist them in creating an effective training and education program. These questions 
will only take about ten minutes to complete. All of your answers are voluntary and confidential and will 
only be reported as part of a group response. Is now a good time to answer some questions? 
If yes ~ Continue with screening question #1 
If no~ When would be a more convenient time to call you back? 
Interviewer: Land managers might include line officers,foresters, range conservationists, biologists, 
fuel specialists, fire management personnel, NEPA coordinators, and silviculturists. 
(Interviewer note: read only ifrespondent needs more information about ERI) 
The goal of the Ecological Restoration Institute is to provide the best-applied restoration knowledge in 
both ecological and socioeconomic disciplines to the public, nongovernmental organizations, state and 
federal agencies, academic researchers and students. The ERI works closely with agencies, 
communities, and members of the public in assisting with the design, implementation and monitoring of 
science-based treatments that restore forests while simultaneously reducing the threat of unnatural 
wildfire.
