Abstract
 
Efforts to restore ponderosa pine ecosystems to open,
park-like conditions that predominated prior to Euro-
pean-American settlement result in altered stand struc-
ture and increased landscape heterogeneity, poten-
tially altering habitat suitability for invertebrates and
other forest organisms. We examined the responses of
two butterfly species, 
 
Colias eurytheme
 
 and 
 
Neopha-
sia menapia
 
, to microclimatic changes at structural
edges created by experimental restoration treatments
in northern Arizona. We monitored microclimate, in-
cluding air temperature, light intensity, and vapor
pressure deficit (VPD), on several mornings during
butterfly releases. We placed adult butterflies at east-
and west-facing edges approximately one half-hour
before dawn to determine their behavioral response
to microclimatic differences between east- and west-
facing edges. After sunrise, all three microclimatic
variables were higher at east-facing edges, and the
difference in microclimate between the two edge ori-
entations increased through early morning. For both
species, butterflies placed at east-facing edges flew ear-
lier than butterflies at west-facing edges. 
 
Colias eury-
 
theme
 
, an open-habitat species, tended to move toward
the treated forest during initial flight, while move-
ments of 
 
Neophasia menapia
 
, a forest-dwelling spe-
cies, did not differ from random flight. Our results
indicate that butterflies respond to microclimatic fac-
tors associated with restoration treatments, while re-
sponses to structural changes in habitat vary among
species, based on habitat and food plant preferences.
These changes in forest structure and microclimate
may affect the distribution of many mobile inverte-
brates in forested landscapes undergoing restoration
treatments.

Introduction
 
A
 
nthropogenic influences shape landscapes in novel
ways, often creating spatial arrangements of habi-
tats that have not existed in the past (Wiens et al. 1985).
The effect of this spatial heterogeneity on environmen-
tal conditions and biodiversity is important to ecosys-
tem restoration and management (Forman & Gordon
1986; Noss & Csuti 1994). The effect of spatial pattern
on biotic processes has been extensively researched, fo-
cusing on plant and animal assemblages in fragmented
habitats (Rosenberg & Raphael 1986; Saunders et al.
1991; Roland 1993; Turner 1996; Yahner 1996; Bayne &
Hobson 1997; Bierregaard & Stouffer 1997) and near
habitat edges (Lovejoy et al. 1986; Kroodsma 1987; Palik
1990; Santos & Telleria 1992; Sisk 1992; Marini et al.
1995; Renhorn et al. 1997; Manson et al. 1999). More re-
cently, the effect of landscape structure on abiotic fac-
tors, such as microclimatic conditions, has received in-
creased attention (Chen & Franklin 1992; Brothers 1993;
Matlack 1993; Young & Mitchell 1994; Chen et al. 1996;
Jose et al. 1996; Brosofske et al. 1997; Saunders et al.
1998). Few studies, however, have linked animal re-
sponses to microclimate changes within affected land-
scapes. We examined the behavioral responses of two
species of adult butterflies to microclimate at habitat
edges created by restoration treatments in 
 
Pinus pon-
derosa
 
 (ponderosa pine) forest in northern Arizona.
Present day ponderosa pine forests in the intermoun-
tain West typically support dense stands of small-diam-
eter trees and a forest structure that differs considerably
from that prevailing prior to European settlement (Cov-
ington et al. 1994). Before 1900 these forests were com-
posed of large trees distributed in clumps, resulting in
an open forest structure and a diverse herbaceous un-
derstory capable of carrying ground fires (Cooper 1960;
Swetnam 1990; Covington et al. 1994). Current efforts to
restore ponderosa pine forest to open, park-like stands

involve thinning dense, small trees, reestablishing a di-
verse herbaceous understory, and reintroducing fre-
quent ground fire (Covington et al. 1994; Covington et
al. 1997). Restoration treatments create large patches of
relatively open treated forest, imbedded in a dense ma-
trix of untreated forest, creating stark contrasts in forest
structure.
Forest microclimates are sensitive to changes in over-
story structure (Kittredge 1948; Reifsnyder & Lull 1965;
Ranney 1977) and are an important component of habi-
tat quality for many species, influencing survival, re-
productive success, and behavior (Geiger 1966; Meffe &
Carroll 1994; Oke 1996). Microclimates altered by resto-
ration treatments have the potential to influence inter-
specific interactions, such as pollination, herbivory
rates, and the distribution and abundance of food re-
sources for mobile organisms (Weiss et al. 1988).
Butterflies are particularly sensitive to microclimatic
conditions in all of their life stages (Weiss et al. 1991;
Calvert et al. 1992), and their activity has been directly
linked to macro- and microclimatic conditions (Clench
1966; Pollard 1991; Roland 1993). Air temperature and
light intensity, in combination with behavioral ther-
moregulation, have been shown to determine minimum
and maximum flight conditions for adult butterflies
(Douwes 1976; Rawlins 1980; Casey 1981; Heinrich 1981;
Kingsolver & Watt 1983), and several studies have dem-
onstrated the relationship between flight duration, air
temperature, and solar radiation (Shreeve 1984; Ohsaki
1986). These studies, among others, confirm that micro-
climate influences butterfly behavior, affecting their re-
productive success, survival, and dispersal (Clench
1966; Tsuji et al. 1986). Butterflies are therefore useful
model organisms for examining the interacting effects
of restoration treatments, landscape structure, and mi-
croclimate on animal ecology.
We have examined differences in microclimate fol-
lowing restoration treatments in ponderosa pine forests
in northern Arizona (Meyer et al. 2001). Overall, effects
were modest, but changes were pronounced in morn-
ing and evening and near edges between treated and
untreated forest. Here we examine the responses of two
adult butterfly species, 
 
Colias eurytheme
 
 (Orange sul-
phur) and 
 
Neophasia menapia
 
 (Pine white), to early-morning
microclimatic differences at paired east- and west-facing
edges created by ponderosa pine forest restoration. This re-
search focuses on butterflies because they are known to be
sensitive to microclimate and may be suitable indica-
tors of the response of other organisms to changes in
microclimatic conditions induced by forest restoration
(Beccaloni & Gaston 1995; Pearson & Carroll 1998).
Overall, our objectives are to (1) determine how the
structural edge associated with restoration influences
microclimate, (2) assess the responses of two butterfly
species with different life histories to microclimatic fac-
 
tors, and (3) determine how these species respond to
structural edges between treated and untreated forest.
 
Methods
 
Study Site and Treatments
 
This study was conducted at the Flagstaff Urban Wild-
land Interface (FUWI) restoration site within the Fort
Valley Experimental Forest, Coconino National Forest,
located 10 km northwest of Flagstaff, Arizona (lat

W). Mean annual precipitation is
573 mm, about half of which falls as snow, and half as
summer rains (Schubert 1974; Savage et al. 1996). Mean
air temperature and precipitation for July and August,
when this research took place, are 16.5
 
!
 
C and 70.4 mm,
respectively (Western Regional Climate Center 2000).
Forests are composed of both large presettlement pines,
established prior to 1870, and small postsettlement
pines, established primarily during the first half of the
twentieth century (Covington et al. 1994). Prior to resto-
ration treatment, presettlement trees in the treatment
units constituted 5.3% of the total number of trees, and
postsettlement trees 94.7% (W. W. Covington, unpub-
lished data).
Restoration treatments were implemented in 1999,
several months before the initiation of this experiment.
Treatment involved the retention of all presettlement
trees and a sufficient number of postsettlement trees to
compensate for cut or dead presettlement trees. All
other postsettlement trees, about 87% of the total num-
ber of trees, were cut and removed (W. W. Covington
and P. Fulé, unpublished data). The implementation of
the treatments in the forested landscape created stark
edges between treated and untreated forest. For this re-
search, microclimate and butterfly responses were in-
vestigated at paired east- and west-facing edges in two
treatment units.
 
Microclimate Data Collection
 
Ambient air temperature, light intensity, and relative
humidity were measured near east- and west-facing
edges between the treated and untreated forest. Gen-
eral-purpose thermometers (VWR Scientific Products,
West Chester, PA) were used to measure air tempera-
ture during butterfly release experiments occurring from
early- to mid-morning at both edge orientations. We placed
two thermometers at ground level, within one meter of
the edge, and recorded temperature every 15 minutes.
In addition, portable Hobo dataloggers (Spectrum Tech-
nologies, Plainsfield, IL) integrated with light intensity,
air temperature, and relative humidity sensors, moni-
tored microclimate at edges during one experiment on

6 August 1999. Light intensity dataloggers, measuring
wavelengths between 400 and 1,100 nm, were placed at
ground level, inside clear plexiglass protective cases
(Spectrum Technologies, Plainsfield, IL). One air tem-
perature datalogger and one relative humidity datalog-
ger were also placed at each site, at ground level, inside
a radiation shield (Spectrum Technologies, Plainsfield,
IL). Relative humidity readings were converted to VPD
using equations from Lowe (1977).
 
Butterfly Flight Behavior
 
Adults of two butterfly species, 
 
Colias eurytheme
 
 and
 
Neophasia menapia
 
, were selected for this study because
of their high abundance and differing life history char-
acteristics. Both species, from the family Pieridae, are
common throughout their ranges in North America, yet
they show markedly different habitat and host-plant af-
finities. Because of these differing life history character-
istics, the two species may provide useful information
about how other invertebrates will respond to restora-
tion treatments. 
 
C. eurytheme
 
 uses a wide variety of
open habitats and is closely associated with recently
disturbed sites (Scott 1986). It is a host-plant generalist,
whose larvae utilize many species in the family Fa-
baceae. Adult 
 
C. eurytheme
 
 consume nectar on a wide
variety of flowering plants. 
 
N. menapia
 
, in contrast, pre-
fer coniferous forests and use several pine species as
host plants, including ponderosa pine (Scott 1986). Lar-
val outbreaks of this species occasionally defoliate pon-
derosa pine stands (Tunnock et al. 1978; Young 1986;
Opler et al. 1995). Adult 
 
N. menapia
 
 also consume nectar
on a wide variety of flowering plants.
We collected numerous individuals from both spe-
cies at the FUWI site and near Upper Lake Mary, 18 km
southeast of Flagstaff, Arizona. We netted butterflies
and held them overnight at approximately 5
 
!
 
C. To ex-
amine the responses of these butterflies to habitat edges
and related microclimates, we released the butterflies at
both east- and west-facing edges one half hour before
dawn. Male and female butterflies were randomly as-
signed to one of the two edge orientations, with a simi-
lar number of butterflies being placed at each edge. The
capture ratio of males to females collected was skewed
toward males for both species, and this is reflected in
the release experiment. The male-to-female ratio for re-
leased 
 
C. eurytheme
 
 was 2:1 at both edges, and for 
 
N.
menapia
 
 it was 8:1. Individuals were placed upright on
the ground, within one meter of the edge, and observed
until they flew at least 10 m from the release point. Ini-
tial flight time and direction were recorded. Direction
was identified as one of the eight cardinal or inter-car-
dinal directions (N, S, E, W, NE, SE, NW, SW). These re-
leases took place on four mornings between 30 July and
13 August 1999. 
 
C. eurytheme
 
 were released on two clear
 
mornings, 6 August and 13 August 1999, and one over-
cast morning, 29 July 1999. Releases on clear mornings
occurred at different locations along the east- and west-
facing edges; the overcast morning release occurred at
the same location as the 6 August release, and 
 
N. mena-
pia
 
 were released at this site on one clear morning, 30
July 1999. We conducted the release experiments in the
mornings because at this time of day, flight by diurnal
lepidoptera is typically limited by microclimatic condi-
tions. The timing also allowed us to minimize handling
effects by releasing butterflies at a time when butterfly
body temperature, and thus activity level, would in-
crease gradually with ambient conditions.
 
Data Analysis
 
The weather, even in the morning, was highly variable
between butterfly release dates; therefore, we did not
combine microclimate data across days. Butterfly flight
times were normalized to the time of the first butterfly
flight on each day. The clear morning flight times of 
 
C. eu-
rytheme
 
 were analyzed with a two-way ANOVA, using
edge orientation and release day as factors. The overcast
morning flight times of 
 
C. eurytheme
 
 and the clear morn-
ing 
 
N. menapia
 
 flight times were analyzed with a one-way
ANOVA, using edge orientation as the factor. Skewed sex
ratios precluded consideration of sex as a factor in the
analyses. The data were checked for normality and ho-
mogeneity of variances; when these assumptions were
not met, Kruskal-Wallis tests were run, in addition to
ANOVA. In all cases, the two tests yielded similar results,
so we present ANOVA results here, for the sake of conti-
nuity and clarity. For all comparisons, a value of 
 
p
 
 
 
#
 
 0.05
was deemed sufficient to reject the null hypothesis that
the observed differences were due to chance alone.
We summarized flight direction for both edge orienta-
tions by grouping individual butterflies into three direc-
tional categories: those that flew into the treated forest,
those that flew along the edge, and those that flew into
the untreated forest. Direction of first flight was analyzed
by comparing expected and observed frequencies of flight
in these three categories (i.e., expected frequencies were
three-eighths flying into treated forest, one-quarter along
the edge, and three-eighths into untreated forest) with a
chi-square test of goodness of fit (Sokal & Rohlf 1981). A
value of 
 
p
 
 
 
#
 
 0.05 was deemed sufficient to reject the null
hypothesis that initial flight direction was random.

of 6 August 1999, average light intensity was 51%
higher, average air temperature was 24.2% higher, and
average VPD was 61.5% higher at the east-facing edge
(Fig. 1), and all variables increased earlier there. On
clear morning release days, air temperature was, on av-
erage, 2.7

out the morning (Fig. 2a). On the single overcast morn-

Butterfly Behavioral Response
 
On clear mornings both species of butterfly flew earlier
at east-facing edges than west-facing edges. 
 
Colias eu-
rytheme
 
 flew significantly earlier at east-facing edges on
clear mornings (
 
p

 0.0001; Fig. 3a); a significant effect
due to release day was also observed (
 
p
 
 
 
%
 
 0.02). On 6
August butterflies at the east-facing edge flew 57 min-
utes earlier; on 13 August they flew, on average, 81
minutes earlier. On the overcast morning, flight times
of 
 
C. eurytheme
 
 were similar at the two edge orienta-
tions (
 
p
 
 
 
%
 
 0.40; Fig. 3b), with individuals at the east-fac-
ing edge flying only 6 minutes earlier, on average.
 
Neophasia menapia
 
 exhibited a similar trend to 
 
C. eury-
theme
 
; on clear mornings individuals flew 42 minutes
earlier at the east-facing edge (
 
p

The direction of first flight differed for the two spe-
cies. 
 
C. eurytheme
 
 flew into the restoration treatment
from both east- and west-facing edges more often than
would be expected by chance (Fig. 4a). The clear-day re-
leases were analyzed separately due to the significant
release-day effect found when analyzing initial flight
times. On 6 August, 69% of the butterflies at the east-
facing edge (

into the restoration treatment. The pattern was similar
on 13 August when 70% of the butterflies at the east-
facing edge (

at the west-facing edge (

treatment. Caution should be used when interpreting
tests of the 13 August results because expected values
for some flight directions were low (

Rohlf 1981). On the overcast morning as well, 
 
C. eury-
theme
 
 flew more often into the restoration treatment.

facing edge (

toration treatment (Fig. 4a). Flight direction for

 followed a pattern that did not differ from random.

Discussion
Restoration treatments in ponderosa pine forests al-
tered forest microclimate near the structural edges and
influenced butterfly behavioral patterns during morn-
ing hours. Microclimatic differences were greatest on

and (c) vapor pressure deficit (kPa) at east- and west-facing

clear mornings, when east-facing edges received sun-
light earlier, increasing light intensity, warming air tem-
perature, and elevating VPD, when compared to west-
facing edges. In contrast, on overcast mornings, air tem-
perature was similar at opposing edges because of the
insulating effect of clouds (Wales 1967).
The timing of first flight for adult butterflies was al-
most certainly influenced by the favorable microclimatic
conditions present at east-facing edges in the morning.
Butterfly thermoregulation is highly constrained by mi-
croclimatic conditions, and butterflies are particularly
sensitive to light intensity and air temperature (Clench
1966; Casey 1981). Several studies have shown that but-
terfly behavior is influenced directly by these microcli-
matic variables (Douwes 1976; Shreeve 1984; Tsubuki &
Takizawa 1996), and Shreeve (1984) found that higher
air temperature and light intensity allowed males of
Pararge aegeria (Nymphalidae) to patrol longer in search
of mates. Also, microclimate conditions have been shown
to control foraging rates of moth and beetle species (Ca-
sey et al. 1988; Bach 1993). Our data suggest that Colias
eurytheme and Neophasia menapia responded to increased
light intensity, warmer air temperature, and higher VPD
by flying earlier at east-facing edges. On an overcast
morning, when microclimatic conditions were similar
across the landscape, C. eurytheme flew at approximately
the same time from both edges.
Individual butterflies that are able to move earlier in
the day, such as those at east-facing edges, may have an
advantage over those that remain inactive until later in
the day. Increased foraging time (i.e., they get to nectar re-
sources sooner in the morning), greater reproductive suc-
cess (i.e., more time searching for mates and oviposition
sites), and greater opportunities for dispersal all contrib-

ute to an individual’s success (Clench 1966; Tsuji et al.
1986). Similarly individuals near west-facing edges in the
afternoon may have advantages over individuals else-
where in the landscape. Empirical information on how
animal movement is influenced by microclimate, edges,
and landscape heterogeneity is limited (Lima & Zollner
1996), but butterfly movement across habitat edges may
also be influenced by the life history of species or the de-
gree of edge contrast (Ries 1998; Haddad 1999).
Initial flight directions for the two species in this
study differed markedly, presumably because of their
contrasting life history characteristics. C. eurytheme, a
vagile species associated with open habitat (Scott 1986),
flew into the restoration treatment more often at both
edge orientations, probably because of favorable micro-
climatic conditions and visual cues present in the more
open treated areas. N. menapia, a species more closely
associated with forested habitat (Scott 1986), exhibited
movement patterns that did not differ statistically from
directionally random flight. These individuals flew to
ponderosa pines, their primary host plant, whether in
the treatment or at the edge. For N. menapia the struc-
tural edge did not act as a boundary to movement, as it
did for the open-habitat species, C. eurytheme.
Butterfly movements and distributions across hetero-
geneous landscapes may be influenced by many factors

other than microclimate and tree density, including the
density and quality of host plants and nectar resources
(Weiss et al. 1988; Loertscher et al. 1995). Reestablishing
the herbaceous understory is a goal of forest restoration
that we were unable to assess, because we worked dur-
ing the first growing season following treatment at our
study sites. At the end of August, the understory cover
was minimal, and approximately equivalent, in the treated
and surrounding untreated forest (J. Korb, unpublished
data). Future changes in the forest understory may fur-
ther alter butterfly behavioral patterns; however, but-
terflies observed in this study clearly demonstrate a
strong response to the combination of microclimate and
forest structural characteristics.
Our results suggest that butterfly species associated
with more open habitat are likely to be attracted by res-
toration treatments in ponderosa pine forest. At a finer
level, the influence of structural edges on microclimate
is likely to lead to a redistribution of butterflies (and
other volant arthropods) across the landscape, poten-
tially impacting herbivory and pollination rates, as well
as the density and distribution of larvae, important
food resources for breeding birds and other animals.
Restoration treatments have been proposed for large
expanses of ponderosa pine and other long-needle pine
forests in western North America (e.g., Covington et al.
1997). If implemented, these treatments cannot take
place simultaneously; instead they will occur sequen-
tially, stand by stand, creating a shifting patchwork of
treated and untreated forest, greatly increasing the
amount of edge habitat. Our results for two common
butterfly species suggest that restoration ecologists
should consider the influence that this novel landscape
structure is likely to exert on microclimate, arthropod
distributions, and other key drivers of ecosystem struc-
ture and function.
