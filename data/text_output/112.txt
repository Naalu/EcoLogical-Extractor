Prescribed Fire Is Not the Issue 
W. Wallace Covington 
We cannot bury our heads in the sand 
any longer. Los Aiamos, Flagstaff, 
Storm King--western 
forest 
landscapes 
and human communities have been 
ravaged by preventable 
catastrophic 
fires. Does it matter whether the fires 
were prescribed, 
accidental, 
or caused 
by lightning? 
Is that the issue? 
Not re- 
ally--in fact arguing 
about who starts 
a 
fire is unproductive. 
All of us caused 
the fires. We caused 
them by allowing 
our forests to become so overstocked 
with trees that they exceeded 
the carry- 
ing capacity 
of the land. The real ques- 
tion is: How do we overcome the barri- 
ers that prevent the restoration 
of west- 
ern forest landscapes, 
especially 
in our 
increasingly 
vulnerable 
ponderosa 
pine 
and lower mixed conifer forests? 
Two myths contribute to the cur- 
rent situation: (1) that we do not have 
sufficient information to act, and (2) 
that we must achieve consensus on 
restoration treatments before we act. 
Despite the first myth, in fact we 
know a great deal about how to accom- 
plish restoration. 
Abundant scientific 
knowledge 
has resulted 
from research 
begun in the 1890s that continues 
today. We have solid information 
about 
presetdement 
forest 
conditions, 
changes 
in fire regimes, 
and ecological 
responses 
to thinning 
and prescribed 
burning. 
As for the second 
myth, total con- 
sensus 
among conservation 
profession- 
als, environmental activists, and scien- 
tists is not possible--never 
has been, 
never will be. As we wait for consensus 
and perfect information, 
the forest be- 
comes more vulnerable. This is unfor- 
givable. We have the knowledge 
to 
protect these magnificent 
forests. 
We 
just need the courage 
and will to im- 
plement solutions, 
and to learn some- 
thing while we do it. 
Our dry, western 
forest ecosystems, 
once dominated by open, park-like 
stands of ponderosa 
pine and mixed 
conifer, 
have become 
increasingly 
vul- 
nerable over the past 140 years. Symp- 
toms of their vulnerability 
were appar- 
ent to local residents, conservation 
leaders, and scientists such as John 
Wesley Powell and AIdo Leopold. Na- 
tive plants, animals, and landscapes 
started 
disappearing 
shortly after Euro- 
pean-American 
settlement 
of the West 
in the late 1800s. Overgrazing 
elimi- 
nated herbaceous surface fuels and 
caused native biodiversity to crash. 
Park-like forests with diverse grass, 
shrub, and wildflower understories 
were invaded 
with pines, firs, junipers 
and other woody vegetation. 
By the 
1940s, enough trees and surface 
fuel 
had accumulated to allow fire to re- 
turn--but not the natural, low-inten- 
sity surface 
fires that had shaped 
these 
ecosystems 
over millions of years. 
The fires that began in the 1940s 
burned through tree canopies. 
At first 
the fires were small (a few hundred 
acres) and a small proportion of that 
area burned severely. 
By the 1950s and 
1960s fires were larger and more se- 
vere. Beginning 
in the mid-1980s we 
saw sudden leaps in fire size, severity, 
and destructiveness, 
not just to ecosys- 
tems but also to human lives and prop- 
erty. Such leaps are often observed 
when complex 
systems 
fail. 
Ecologically 
based 
forest restoration 
is the most effective 
way to reestablish 
the ecological 
integrity, or complete- 
ness, of the forest while protecting 
human communities. 
This approach 
is 
informed by science 
and establishes 
as 
its primary goal the restoration 
of fully 
functional ecosystems 
that are linked 
to sustainable 
use by humans. 
For more than 25 years the faculty, 
staff, and students associated with the 
recently 
designated 
Ecological 
Restora- 
tion Institute at Northern Arizona Uni- 
versity have been working with federal 
and state land management 
agencies, 
tribes, 
state and local governments, 
and 
nongovernmental 
organizations 
to de- 
velop and test scientifically 
and ethi- 
cally sound forest restoration treat- 
ments. This merging 
of managers, 
sci- 
entists, 
and communities 
to accomplish 
restoration is the basis for what Secre- 
tary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt and 
US Senator 
Jon Kyi (Arizona) have re- 
cently called "The Flagstaff 
Plan." The 
restoration 
approaches 
developed 
by 
the Ecological 
Restoration 
Institute-- 
working with governmental 
and non- 
governmental 
organizations 
at Mt. 
Trumbull and in Flagstaff are the 
basis for defining a socially 
acceptable 
series 
of restoration 
treatments 
to pro- 
tect the threatened community of 
Flagstaff 
and its surrounding 
forests. 
Unfortunately, 
there are barriers to 
success. 
One is funding; this barrier, 
while not trivial, is relatively 
easy 
to over- 
come when the will exists. The other 
barrier is inaction 
caused 
by obstruction- 
ism and perfectionism. 
Some 
people 
pre- 
fer inaction 
and attempt 
to stall progress 
by using legal challenges, 
bureaucratic 
entanglement, 
and unrealistic 
demands 
for perfect 
knowledge. 
Ironically, 
in de- 
graded 
forests 
this inaction 
becomes 
an 
action that leads to more degradation 
and increasingly 
severe 
crown fires that 
lead to loss of critical wildlife habitat, 
loss of homes, and, most importantly, 
loss 
of human lives. 
The consequences 
of 
obstructionism 
are tragic. 
Time has run out. Knowing what 
we know now, we must act, and we 
must act now. â€¢lb do otherwise would 
be an abdication 
of our responsibility 
to future generations.
