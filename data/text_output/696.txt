Abstract.
Many Mexican pine ecosystems are characterized by great biological diversity and are strongly influ-
enced by fire. We summarize fire ecology information for 35 taxa (including infraspecific taxa) in terms of nine
types of fire traits: serotiny, seed germination after fire, grass stage, fast initial growth, thick bark, protected buds,
self-pruning capacity, resprouting, and canopy recovery from scorch. The majority of Mexican pine species appear
to be adapted to a predictable, stand-thinning fire regime. Current fire regimes are often altered from long-term
historical patterns due to a combination of natural fires plus anthropogenic fires. Human-caused fires are the most
common and burning practices have deep historic and socioeconomic roots. As a consequence, there are three main
categories of fire conditions: (1) pine forests endangered by excessive anthropogenic fire (eventually leading to
deforestation); (2) pine forests maintained by an appropriate fire regime; and (3) pine forests with insufficient fire or
fire exclusion due to fire protection. For managers, conservationists, and landowners concerned with maintaining the
important benefits associated with fire, such as fuel hazard reduction and nutrient cycling, different approaches are
needed. While recognizing the difficult social and economic factors that foster forest degradation, we recommend
basing fire management in pine forests upon a site-specific and species-specific understanding of the historical
and ecological role of fire, trying to reduce excessive anthropogenic burning, maintain appropriate burning, and
restore fire into fire-excluded forests. The interaction of fire with other resource uses, such as timber harvesting
and livestock grazing, should also be balanced in a holistic ecosystem management approach. These changes must
be made in the context of seeking alternative economic options for rural residents and by thoughtful planning to
obtain as many ecological and economic benefits from fire as possible while minimizing negative impacts.

Introduction
Forest fires are one of the most common disturbances on
earth and a vital presence in many ecosystems. This is cer-
tainly the case with many of the pine forests of Mexico which
are rife with natural and anthropogenic fires. In some areas,
excessive burning has contributed to degradation and even
outright deforestation. In other areas, frequent, low intensity
fires facilitate regeneration and maintain an open structure.
An understanding of fire’s ecological role is essential to any
program of restoration, conservation or management. Unfor-
tunately, the quantity of research concerning fire ecology
and fire impacts in Mexican pine ecosystems is not large
and the majority of what exists is not known in interna-
tional circles. This paper seeks to review and integrate the
available information and to propose a strategy of fire use
in resource management, considering both ecological and
socioeconomic factors in order to help conserve and restore
pine ecosystems.
Forest fires in Mexico
Most fires in Mexico occur during the spring before the sum-
mer rains and greenup of vegetation. In the Baja Peninsula,
with a Mediterranean climate, fire season starts in sum-
mer. The average number of forest fires per year from 1995
to 2000 was 8877, with the area burned per year averag-
ing 330 384 ha (Rodríguez-Galindo 2001), or 0.26% of the
surface area covered by temperate and tropical forests plus
shrublands. In 1998, under the influence of the strongest ‘El
Niño’onrecordbysomemeasures(McPhaden1999),Mexico
experienced historic droughts and an extraordinary fire sea-
son (Rodríguez-Trejo and Pyne 1998). A total of 14 445
fires affected 849 632 ha (SEMARNAT, unpublished report,

2000a) and the smoke reached the United States and other
nations in the Caribbean.
According to SEMARNAT (2002a), only 6.2% of fires in
Mexico start from lightning, illegal crops, and rare causes.
However, we suggest that this figure underestimates the nat-
ural occurrence of fire, at least in northern Mexico. By way
of comparison, 45% of wildland fires in Arizona and New
Mexico, USA, are due to lightning (data 1992–2001, USDA
Forest Service, Albuquerque, NM). Human-caused fires in
Mexico are mostly due to agricultural and pastoral activ-
ities, accounting for 46% of ignitions for 2001 and 2002
(January–August 8) in the country (SEMARNAT 2002a). In
northern Mexico, natural fires are more common. According
to the same source, and for the same period of time, in north-
ern Mexico (Baja California, Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila,
Nuevo León and Tamaulipas), the causes related to agricul-
tural and pastoral activities account for 20%, and other causes
(including lightning), for 38%. In central Mexico (Distrito
Federal, Estado de México, Puebla, Tlaxcala and Morelos),
the figures are, respectively, 56% and 5%. Finally, in south-
ern México (Yucatán, Quintana Roo, Campeche, Chiapas,
Tabasco), the percentages are, respectively: 44% and 3%.
The reason for the predominance of human-caused igni-
tion stems from the history and present socioeconomic
situation of the country. Beginning thousands of years ago
with the first inhabitants of present-day Mexico, the natural
fire regimes were altered by anthropogenic fire with increas-
ing frequency and effects on the ecosystems as the human
population grew.The ancient cultures, such as Mayan,Aztec,
and Texcocan, were concerned with sustaining forests; the
Chichimec culture promulgated legislation to prevent for-
est fires (Rodríguez-Trejo and Sierra-Pineda 1992).After the
Spanish conquest, the indigenous human population declined
and livestock grazing started (Melville 1994; Pyne 1997a).
The influence of the European pastoral economy led to the
application of broadcast fire for range improvement; subse-
quent deforestation in parts of Mexico was a repetition of
what happened in Spain (Pyne 1997b). After Mexican inde-
pendence in the 19th Century, the government created the
‘Secretaría de Fomento’ (Gutiérrez-Palacio 1989), leading
to the establishment of a Forest Service in 1861 (Esquinca
1950). Presently the Secretariat is named Secretaría de Medio
Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (SEMARNAT).
Over time, this organization has gradually increased its
size and capability to prevent, detect, and fight fires in collab-
oration with other federal, state, and private fire management
agencies. The Mexican army and volunteers offer additional
support during difficult fire seasons. Firefighters are work-
ing diligently at presuppression and suppression given the
level of economic, human and material resources they have
(Gonzales-Caban and Sandberg 1989). Recent improvements
include better satellite and computer capability, as well as
improved formal training of firefighters. But like many other
countries in the world, and as demonstrated during the historic
1998 fire season (Rodríguez-Trejo 1998a, b), they cannot
begin to detect or fight 100% of the wildfires. Contributing
factors include the lack of resources and the common use and
misuse of fire in agricultural activities across Mexico, prac-
tices with deep historic roots in which rural poverty plays
a key role. For instance, econometric modeling showed that
the most significant variables related with number of fires
in different regions of Mexico in 1980, 1990 and 1994 were
education level and the availability of land for cattle growing
(Torres-Rojo and Hernández 1999).
Pine ecosystems in Mexico
Mexico is one of the world’s richest countries in number
of pine species, with 47 species and 20 infraspecific taxa
recognized by Farjon and Styles (1997), nearly 50% of the
approximately 110 pine species worldwide. Other taxon-
omists have counted as many as 120 species for Mexico
(see Farjon and Styles 1997, pp. 4–5).Appreciable confusion
about species names exists among taxonomists, foresters,
and ecologists. Throughout this article, we have used the
nomenclature of Farjon and Styles (1997) and have provided
synonyms wherever applicable.
Coniferous forests dominated by pines, mixed conifer
hardwood forests, and hardwood forests cover 32.8 million ha
in Mexico (SEMARNAT 2002b; note that other sources give
differing numbers for various types of forest, e.g. Klooster
and Masera 2000). Pines may form pure or mixed forests
with other conifers and there are extensive pine–oak forests,
but pines also associate with chaparral vegetation, juniper
woodlands, deciduous forest and transitional and tropical
vegetation (Farjon et al. 1997). Environmental conditions
where pines occur are extraordinarily variable: elevations
from sea level to >4000 m; mean annual temperature from
6◦C to 28◦C; mean annual precipitation from 350 to more
than 1000 mm; from 1 to 7 dry months; commonly on soils
formed from igneous parent material but also on sedimentary
soils, acidic to neutral pH, rich in organic matter (Rzedowski
1978; Perry 1991; Farjon and Styles 1997).

or varieties (scientific names are given in Table 1). Where
fire regime information is known, we applied the fire regime
classification system used by Keeley and Zedler (1998):
(1) fire predictable/unpredictable (2) stand-thinning/stand-
replacing.The fire-related traits mentioned here are generally
recognized as important in fire ecology, although there is
debate regarding whether such traits evolved specifically as
adaptations to fire (Mutch 1970; Bond and Midgley 1995;
Whelan 1995). The traits listed in Table 2 include nine types
(number of taxa in parentheses): serotinous cones (11), good
regeneration on burned localities (25), resprouting capacity
(8), grass stage (4), fast initial growth (4), thick bark (27), bud
protected by heat resistant scales (1), self-pruning capacity
(18), and recovery from crown scorch (3). Twelve taxa have

When summarizing the fire ecology literature, it must
be stated clearly that research on Mexican ecosystems has
been limited. Probably other traits and responses to fire are
empirically known by foresters, biologists and people living
in the rural areas. For instance, the profuse regeneration in
burned sites of Pinus patula, as observed by Mirov (1967)
for other pine species, was largely known before its technical
documentation. Furthermore, even when information from a
given region exists, the fire-related traits may vary in their
manifestation over the entire range of the species. Pinus
hartweggii (=P . rudis, Table 1) does not sprout at every
site, for example, just as a serotinous species may not be
always serotinous along all its range.Variation in serotiny has
been documented in the USA in Pinus contorta (Lotan 1974),
P. muricata (Zedler 1986), and P . coulteri (Borchert 1985).
The three species are present in Mexico. Moreover, Myers
(1992) reported that no consistent morphological differences
besides serotiny were found between Pinus clausa var. clausa
(serotinous) and P . clausa var. immuginata (non-serotinous)
in south-eastern USA, suggesting that the degree of serotiny
was likely a function of fire regime.
Fire ecology of Mexican pines
In this section we summarize fire ecology information by
species for several of the taxa listed in Tables 1 and 2.
Since most temperate Mexican forests are mixed, fire studies
frequently include multiple species. Wherever possible, indi-
vidual studies have been listed by the dominant pine species.
As is frequently the case in fire ecology research (Whelan
1995), the majority of studies to date have been observational
rather than experimental and the effects of fire have often
been variable, if not even contradictory, between different
studies and locations. Much of the fire ecology information
in Mexico is in the ‘gray literature’: reports, proceedings, and
theses.
P. arizonica (classified together with P . ponderosa in
Mexico by Rzedowski 1978:294). Regenerates well on
burned areas (Verduzco-Gutiérrez et al. 1962) and thick bark
and good self-pruning capacity protect it from fire. How-
ever, in Durango, survival of P . arizonica and P . durangensis
trees declined after burns with fuel loading ≥36–49 Mg/ha
and pest susceptibility increased with fuel loading ≥22–
35 Mg/ha (Zapata-Pérez 1991).Alanís-Morales (1995) tested
successive fall or winter prescribed burns in P. arizonica
stands in Chihuahua, finding increases in water flow, par-
ticularly on the second fall burn. In a cross-border com-
parison of the Sierra de los Ajos, Sonora, and Animas
Mountains, New Mexico, Villanueva-Díaz (1996) found that
total nitrogen and cation exchange capacity were lower in the
Mexican site, consistent with the lower tree densities asso-
ciated with the frequent fire history and logging activities
in Sierra de los Ajos. In a Pinus arizonica-dominated stand
in Chihuahua, Alanís-Morales et al. (2000) found increased
runoff in prescribed-burned sites, with higher runoff asso-
ciated with lower forest fuels loads and lower litter-layer
depths.

(1993) recorded 161 seedlings/ha in control areas, 1257/ha in
areas burned with heading fires and 1394/ha in areas burned
with backing fires.They also found an increase in soil cations,
mainly Ca, after fire.
P. durangensis. The fire regimes of P. durangensis (usu-
ally in mixed-species stands) are perhaps the best-studied
of Mexican pines. The categorization of the fire regime for
this species as predictable and stand-thinning (Keeley and
Zedler 1998) is supported by several fire history reconstruc-
tions. In the Sierra de los Ajos of northern Sonora, Dieterich
(1983, 1985) found a fire frequency of 3.8 years for stands
of P . durangensis, mixed with P. engelmannii and other
species, a fire regime that probably reflected human influ-
ences. Fulé and Covington (1994, 1996, 1997) compared
the fire regimes of three stands in north-western Durango
dominated by P . durangensis with other conifers and Quer-
cus spp. The pine stands had fire return intervals ranging
from 3.8 to 4.7 years (counting all fire scars) or 6.6 to 9.0
years (counting only fires that scarred 25% or more of the
fire-recording sample trees, presumably fires that were larger
and/or more intense).A mesic stand nearby with Pseudotsuga
and Abies had similar fire frequency statistics (5.0 years for
all scars, 8.6 years for 25%-scarred samples). Only one of
the four stands maintained the frequent fire regime up to the
present; the others entered extended periods of fire exclusion
beginning after 1945–1955. Stands without recent fire had
higher tree densities and greater forest floor fuels, suggest-
ing that fire exclusion contributed to increasing the hazard
of severe fire (Fulé and Covington 1997). Similar patterns
of frequent fire were observed in P . durangensis-dominated
forests of Durango and Chihuahua (Heyerdahl andAlvarado-
Celestino, in press) and south-eastern Durango (Fulé and
Covington 1999) until the establishment of ejidos (a form of
community-based ownership created after the Mexican Rev-
olution [1910–1915]) led to increased livestock grazing in
the 20th Century. According to Park (2001), the regeneration
of Pinus durangensis, Pinus teocote and Quercus crassifolia
was more abundant in localities recently affected by surface
fires in Durango.
A winter-season prescribed burn in Chihuahua killed 87%
of P. durangensis trees shorter than 30 cm in height, while
54% were killed by a fall prescribed burn (Sánchez-Córdova
and Dieterich 1983). Winter-season prescribed burning did
not significantly affect chemical or physical soil properties
but increased the frequency of two forb species, Pteridium
aquilinum and Lupinus mashallianus (Sánchez-Córdova and
Dieterich 1983). Fire-caused mortality of mature trees of
P . durangensis and P. arizonica in Durango increased when
fuel loads ≥36–49 Mg/ha and susceptibility to forest pests
increased in burned areas with fuel loads ≥22–35 Mg/ha
(Zapata-Pérez 1991).
P. hartwegii. Historically P. hartwegii and P . rudis have
been considered distinct species (e.g. Perry 1991). However,
Matos (1995) and Farjon and Styles (1997) recognized only
P . hartwegii. We adopt their nomenclature but the reader
should recognize that the authors of several of the following
studies referred to the species as P . rudis.
Probably this species is the best studied, among Mexi-
can pines, in terms of fire ecology. P . hartwegii reaches the
upper altitudinal limit for trees, 4300 m above sea level on the
volcanoes in central Mexico. P . hartwegii forms monospe-
cific stands with a grass understory including Muhlenbergia
macroura and Festuca tolucensis. The fire regime apparently
is characterized by frequent low intensity fires (Rodríguez-
Trejo, in press). On the highest sites, changes in the fire
frequency would not change the tree species composition:
P . hartwegii is the pioneer and also the climax tree because
is the only one that can reach such altitudes. According to
Rzedowski (1978) and Miranda and Hernández-Xolocotzi
(1985), however, very frequent fires will favor grasses to the
detriment of this pine. Grasses propagate fire and fire facil-
itates sprouting from the rhizomatous grasses (Rzedowski
1978). Fire also affects the timing and amount of flower-
ing in grasses (Benítez-Badillo 1988). Seeds find favorable
conditions for establishment in burned areas, as shown by
González et al. (1991) in Tlaxcala, where seedling survival
was higher on burned areas than in unburned areas.
Seedlings were able to survive very low intensity fires,
after winter prescribed burns at −3◦C in the Distrito Fed-
eral. After 2 weeks, the P. hartwegii seedlings between 0.5
and 1.2 m in height had 97.5% survival (Cedeño-Sánchez
1989). Over 84% of P . hartwegii seedlings survived a low
intensity prescribed burn conducted on flat land, but survival
was reduced to 8% when burning was conducted on steep
slopes (Velázquez-Martínez et al. 1986). Susano (1990) sug-
gested that seedling mortality could exceed 50% when the
fuel load is greater than 4 Mg/ha. Fuel loads ranged from
5.6 to 22.6 Mg/ha (COCODER 1988; Rodríguez-Trejo and
Sierra Pineda 1995), with grasses and woody fuels commonly
accounting for the largest proportion.
Regeneration (sprouting) dynamics of a P. harwegii
stand in central Mexico under the influence of frequent
surface fires were reported by Rodríguez-Trejo (1996), fol-
lowing a synchronic (Pickett 1989; Whelan 1995) approach.
The density of seedlings <1.3 m in height was 2764 trees/ha;
97% of these trees had sprouts, averaging 7.8 sprouts/tree.
Density declined to 1190 trees/ha for stems taller than
1.3 m. Sprouting rate also declined to 28%, averaging 3.3
sprouts/tree. Sprouting capacity was progressively reduced
as the trees grew older. In time, competition led to the death
of all the stems, with exception of one or two. Eventually
given a period of approximately 5–10 years without fire, the
stems grew tall enough that the terminal bud could survive
low intensity fires and the bark became thick enough to pro-
tect the cambium (Fig. 1). P. hartwegii on the borders of the

Estado de México and Tlaxcala recovered from 100% crown
scorch, regaining 40% of the original crown after 16 months,
as long as the terminal bud survived (Rodríguez-Trejo 1996).
Crown scorch greater than 50% led to a 32.2% reduction in
diameter growth during the following growing season in the
35-year-old P. rudis stand (Rodríguez-Trejo 1996) (Fig. 2).
Fire effects on P. hartwegi growth were studied by González-
Rosales (2001) and González-Rosales and Rodríguez-Trejo
(in review). They found that light crown scorch (<30%) was
associated with 32% greater radial growth than an unburned
control. Trees with medium crown scorch (30–60%) had
radial growth similar to the control, while intense crown
scorch (>60%) was associated with reduced radial growth.
The effects of fire on soil were studied in stands with
P. hartwegii, Quercus spp. and Alnus firmifolia, on deep
soils with abundant organic matter, pH from 5.5 to 7.1, high
levels of N, fertile, classified as Eutrandpets.After low inten-
sity prescribed burns, Aguirre-Bravo and Rey (1980) found
no changes in pH, a slight loss of N by volatilization, and
increases in P, Ca, K, Mg and Na levels. Erosion levels per
year were low, 560 kg/ha in the burned sites, and 140 kg/ha
in the controls. Runoff per year in burned sites averaged
200 m3/ha versus 70 m3/ha on controls.
The fuel complex in forests of the Distrito Federal was
dominated by tall sprouting grasses plus needles and woody
fuels. The average fuel load in pine forests (P. rudis,
P. hartwegii, P. montezumae, P. teocote and pine–broadleaf
forest) was 23 Mg/ha, reaching a maximum of 76 Mg/ha
(Rodríguez-Trejo and Sierra-Pineda 1995). As these forests
are open and occur on high mountains (around 3000 m above
sea level), strong winds are also common. Even on gentle
slopes, fire rate of spread may reach 36 m/min or more under
dry conditions (Rodríguez-Trejo, in press). Smoke has been
studied for this stands of this species in Central Mexico.
Contreras-Moctezuma (2002) and Contreras-Moctezuma
et al. (in review), reported emissions of 4.07 kg NO/ha,
3.65 kg NO2/ha, 198.69 kg CO/ha and 2.84 kg SO2/ha.
P. leiophylla. Cones are very persistent (Little 1962), the
species regenerates well on burned sites, and burned trees
may resprout from the root collar, a rare trait among pines
(Perry 1991). Adult trees have thick bark that isolates the
cambium from lethal temperatures. Keeley and Zedler (1998)
grouped this species in the stand-replacing fire regime cat-
egory. However, Fulé et al. (2000) found that a xeric forest
at La Michilia Biosphere Reserve in south-eastern Durango,
with P. leiophylla, P. leiophylla var. chihuahuana, and P.
teocote, had a surface fire regime (mean fire interval 4.1–6.3
years) until heavy livestock grazing began in 1932. Similar
forests further north, in the borderlands region of Sonora,
Chihuahua, Arizona, and New Mexico, generally also had
frequent surface regimes in the past (Kaib 1998; Swetnam
et al. 2001). Barton (1995) suggested that the weak sprouting
capability of P. leiophylla made it a weak competitor against
vigorous oak sprouts following severe fire. In Michoacán,
P.leiophyllatreesaffectedbyforestfiresaremoresusceptible
to attack by bark beetles (Pérez-Chávez 1981).
P. montezumae. This species regenerates with a grass-
stage strategy (Perry 1991; Becerra-Luna 1995) and mature
trees have thick bark and a self-pruning habit. Fire favors the
liberation and dispersion of seeds (Zendejas and Villarreal
1971), but González et al. (1991) did not find differences
in seedling survival between burned and unburned areas.

Sixteen months after a crown fire in surrounding shrubs, this
adult Pinus hartwegii regenerated 40% of its crown in central Mexico.
Intermediate stand density conditions appear to favor P. mon-
tezumae. Becerra-Luna (1995) reported that germination and
early survival of P. montezumae seedlings was better under
a partial canopy than either full shade or exposure of bare
mineral soil. Either fire exclusion or excessive fire can be
detrimental to this species. In the absence of fire and cat-
tle grazing (fires are often set to stimulate forage production
for livestock), P. montezumae in Puebla was displaced by
successionalchangetowardAbiesreligiosaandP.ayacahuite
var. veitchii (Rzedowski et al. 1977). Frequent fires made P.
montezumae stands more susceptible to forest insects in the
Estado de México, where Espinosa and Muñoz (1988) found
a direct relationship between fire-affected area in one year
and P. montezumae and P. leiophylla forest area affected
by the bark beetle Dendroctonus mexicanus during the next
year. P. montezumae can sprout from the root collar when the
main leader is damaged, a capacity that reduces with age from
more than 90% of seedlings in the grass stage to 65% 3 years
after the elongation of the epicotyl (Becerra-Luna 1992). P.
montezumae seedlings remain in a grass stage for 2–12 years
in central Mexico. Emergence seems to take place when the
cotyledonary node reaches 2 cm in diameter (Becerra-Luna
1995). Seedlings that had developed secondary needle fasci-
cles could sprout after the tops were killed by fire or clipped
(Becerra-Luna 1995).
P. oocarpa. Fire favors the opening of the serotinous cones
of some varieties and the burned sites are a good seed bed for
its seeds. Seedlings 2–4 years old and young trees are able
to sprout if fire kills the shoot (Rzedowski et al. 1977; Perry
1991). Mature trees have thick bark and a self-pruning habit.
P. patula. This species of mesic sites, around 1000 mm
mean annual precipitation, is one of the most conspicuous
examples of fire-adapted species among Mexican pines. Fire
stimulates its serotinous cones to open (Vela-Gálvez 1980;
Keeley and Zedler 1998). The seed bed created after the pas-
sage of fire allows hundreds of thousand of seeds per hectare
to germinate during good seed years. When in the seedling
stage the tree is susceptible to fire, but its growth rate allows
it to reach the minimum height to survive low intensity fires
relatively soon and a thick bark develops to protect the cam-
bium. Epicormic sprouts appear in the lower stem in some
adult individuals.
P. patula often forms pure stands or dominates stands,
but can be codominant in a forest undergoing successional
change. In the absence of recent fire, on deep and fertile soils
with abundant precipitation in Puebla, P. patula was found
mixed with P. ayacahuite var. veitchii, Abies religiosa and
several Quercus species.The fuel load was high and vertically
continuous, including herbs, shrubs, several tree strata and
dead woody fuels of every size. This structure appears likely
to support infrequent, high intensity crown fires that may
favor the re-establishment of P. patula from seed protected
in its serotinous cones, as observed by Mirov (1967) for other
serotinous pine species.
In contrast, on rocky soils with less precipitation, P. patula
is found mixed with oaks and the fuel load is lower because
of the reduced site productivity. Jardel and Sánchez (1989)
found an example of a predictable, stand-thinning fire
regime where fire prevented the replacement of P. patula
by broadleaf species in the Sierra de Juárez, Oaxaca.
P. pseudostrobus. This species exhibits fire traits such as
thick bark, self-pruning capacity, and recovery of scorched or
partially burned crown, at least when young.Along the border
of Tlaxcala and Puebla, P. patula and P. pseudostrobus coex-
ist in some stands but the former is less fire-resilient when
young. In an area burned in 1998, crowns of some young
pines 2 m tall of both species were completely scorched or
even needle consumption, but after a few months only the P.
pseudostrobus produced new foliage, starting from the ter-
minal bud (M. Rodríguez-Aguilar, personal communication,
1998). This case study suggested that the species might have
contrasting ecological strategies: P. patula is better suited to
colonize burned areas than P. pseudostrobus, a fire-resilient
response, because the latter species is not serotinous. But

Fire ecology of Mexican pines
31
when young, P. pseudostrobus has a better capacity to restore
its scorched foliage, a fire-resistant response that may be
better adapted than P. patula to intense surface fires.
In mixed conifer forests including P. pseudostrobus in
Jalisco, soil erosion per year in burned areas was 86–170 Mg/
ha (Hernández 1990). In a pine-oak forest in Michoacán, ero-
sion and water runoff were 0.02 Mg/ha and 1.7 m3/ha, respec-
tively, on control areas, versus 15.6 Mg/ha and 77.1 m3/ha on
burned areas. The burned area values declined 99% and 95%
respectively by the second year post-fire, due to increased
understory growth (Chávez and Carmona 1994).
Pinyon pines. P. cembroides, P. monophylla and P.
quadrifolia do not appear to have a predictable fire regime
(Keeley and Zedler 1998). The limited studies of fire ecol-
ogy in Mexican pinyons have also not suggested consistent
effects. Fire was believed by Verduzco-Gutiérrez (1976) to
favor the regeneration of pinyon pines and P. quadrifolia
recruited quickly after burns (Minnich and Franco-Vizcaíno
1998). These authors noted that the fire ecology of this
pine has not been investigated formally, but field observa-
tions suggested that the rapid establishment of seedlings was
related to efficient seed caching from living stands by birds
and mammals. Díaz et al. (2000) suggested that a wave-
like age distribution in Pinus cembroides ssp. lagunae, an
endemic species of Baja California Sur, was probably related
to hurricanes and fires. Several P. cembroides forests were
considered a fire-maintained climax by Rzedowski et al.
(1977) but excessive fire degraded pinyon forests in Coahuila
(López-Reyna and Gómez-Mendoza 1989; Perry 1991).
Summary of pine fire ecology
Fire trait and fire regime relationships in Mexican pines are
consistent with the general categorizations of Keeley and
Zedler (1998). The most common fire traits are regenera-
tion on burned sites and thick bark. Most of the pines (33
out of 35, or 94%) exhibit one or both of these traits, and
the documented examples correspond to both stand-thinning
or stand-replacing fires. Of the 12 species with serotinous
cones, 5 (42%) have been documented to correspond with
stand-replacing fire regimes and none were documented with
frequent, low-intensity fire regimes.Also, 11 out of 12 seroti-
nous species (92%) show good regeneration on burned sites.
Self pruning is present in 19 species (54%), and 11 out of
19 (58%) of these correspond to low-intensity fire regimes
or where there is evidence of a fire-maintained successional
stage. Of the 19 species with self pruning, 13 (68%) also
exhibit good regeneration on burned sites. The majority of
resprouter species (7 out of 8, 88%) also have thick bark.
Most of the resprouter species (75%) have non-serotinous
cones. Finally, the species with grass stage correspond to low-
intensity fire regimes. As future research focuses on pine fire
ecology in Mexico, more data will become available to assess
the links between fire traits and evolutionary relationships.
A fire use proposal
The fire situation in Mexican pine forests can be summarized
in three broad categories: (1) excessive fire; (2) appropriate
fire; and (3) insufficient fire.
(1) Excessive fire
Pine ecosystems adapted to fire are resilient to certain
amounts of anthropogenic fire; in fact, human-caused fires
may have played important roles over evolutionary time (e.g.
see descriptions of indigenous fire practices in Chihuahua
[Pennington 1969] and California [Anderson 1996]). When
the frequency of human-originated fires increases, how-
ever, long-lasting changes may occur in forest structure
(e.g. fire-resistant species invade or increase, changes in
age-distribution in pines with demographic implications
[Rzedowski 1978]). When excessive human-originated fire
is applied, usually accompanied by heavy resource extrac-
tion, degradation occurs. Anthropogenic fire is a contributor
to the 769 350 ha of temperate and tropical forests annually
deforested in the country (Masera et al. 1995; SEMARNAT
2002b) and an important factor endangering directly or indi-
rectly 11 pine taxa, according to Perry (1991). Forest fires are
threats to endangered pine species such as P. culminicola,
P. maximartinezii, P. rzedowskii, P. cembroides ssp. lagunae,
P. jaliscana and P. nelsoni (Perry 1991). Anthropogenic fires
have been a major factor contributing to the loss of more com-
mon pine species as well, including P. flexilis var. reflexa,
P. arizonica, P. lumholtzii, and P. ayacahuite in the Sierra
Madre Occidental (DeBano et al. 1998).
The obvious management option in the case of excessive
fire is to reduce the fire frequency to allow the pine forest to
recover. Throughout Mexico, attempts to control excessive
burning have included public education campaigns (Fig. 3)
and increasing the ability of foresters to prevent or suppress
fire by providing (limited) funds for personnel, training, tools,
and vehicles. But these activities are unlikely to be suffi-
cient, for the root of the problem is, and historically has
been, socioeconomic. Rural residents farm and graze live-
stock in forests and pine savannahs. Fire is applied because it
is cheap, relatively easy to use, and an efficient tool to dispose
of crop residues and weeds, add nutrients to the soil, control
agricultural pests, and promote sprouting in grasslands.Agri-
cultural fires are often allowed to spread through forestlands.
For example, fewer than 10% of the farmers who own lands
contiguous to forest in the eastern part of the state of México
create a fire break around their property when burning
(Rodríguez-Trejo and Mendoza-Briseño 1992). Many forest
owners lack the resources to develop productive forests and
many forest types are poorly suited for sustainable profitable
resource use.
If forests are to be conserved in the face of growing
pressure on rural lands, then the challenge for Mexico—
as in much of the world—is at the macroeconomic scale,

32

A substantial investment has been made in educating people about the importance of fire prevention,
as in this sign from the Sierra Madre Occidental, Durango. However, more complex messages about the
ecological role of fire and its beneficial as well as deleterious effects will be needed in order for the public
to understand a transition to the use of fire as a management tool where ecologically and socially desirable.
to provide better economic opportunities to the campesinos
(rural residents) so they could use their natural resources in a
more economically and ecologically sustainable way, thereby
reducing deforestation and the misuse of fire.Approximately
70% of Mexico’s forest lands are in communal ownership
(Masera et al. 1995). Despite liberalization of land tenure
laws in 1992, Barbier (2002) found that formal and infor-
mal institutions such as ejido ownership still served as a
constraint on land conversion from forests to agriculture.
Klooster and Masera (2000) argued that the international
community should support community forest management,
perhaps through the clean development mechanism (CDM)
of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, because of the global benefit of
mitigating carbon emissions. An analysis by Masera et al.
(1995) found that afforestation and forest conservation could
have significant positive effects on both carbon sequestration
and economic returns to landowners, as long as national and
international policies were adjusted to support sustainable
forest management.
(2) Appropriate fire
Few Mexican pine ecosystems appear to be maintained by
the prevailing anthropogenic and/or natural fire regimes. For
example, Minnich and Franco-Vizcaíno (1998) suggested
that P. jeffreyi dominance of mixed-conifer forests in Baja
California may be due to its thick bark, high canopy, and
good regeneration following surface fires, in contrast to
competing species of Abies and Calocedrus that are more
fire-susceptible. Forest sites where modern fire regimes
remain relatively similar to those of past centuries have been
identified in the Sierra de los Ajos, Sonora (Swetnam et al.
2001), Sierra San Pedro Mártir, Baja California (Minnich
et al. 2000), and the Sierra Madre Occidental of Durango
and Chihuahua (Fulé and Covington 1997, 1999; Kaib 1998).
However, sites with undisrupted fire regimes appear to com-
prise relatively small, rare fragments within heavily disturbed
landscapes (Fulé and Covington 1997, 1999; Kaib 1998). In
several managed forests, prescribed fire is used as a silvicul-
tural tool (e.g. Chihuahua, Alanís-Morales 1995; Durango,
Rentería-Anima 2001).
Where fire appears to be playing an appropriate ecological
role, a good approach is to maintain the present fire regimes
while refining management practices to achieve multiple
objectives from fire, such as forage production, wood pro-
duction or recreational opportunities. Particular care must be
taken in finding an appropriate point of equilibrium between
fire frequency to sustain the pine forest and cattle growing,
because a preference toward livestock has historically been a
major factor in deforestation in Mexico (Melville 1994). Here
universities and research centers have an opportunity and
challenge to evaluate the effects of fire on different ecosystem
components, structure, and processes.
However, it must be mentioned that in some cases frequent
fires sustain pine forests, preventing successional change to
more biologically diverse and endangered ecosystems, such

Fire ecology of Mexican pines
33
as the cloud forest in the Sierra de Manatlán, Jalisco (Saldaña
and Jardel 1991; Jardel et al. 2001). Similarly, anthropogenic
disturbance in montane rain forests of Chiapas, including fire,
increases the dominance of pines and reduces the floristic
richness of mixed forests (e.g. Pinus–Quercus–Liquidambar
forest) (Ramírez-Marcial et al. 2001).
(3) Insufficient fire
In many areas, fire exclusion has allowed successional change
or fuel accumulation to progress to a high hazard for severe
wildfire. For example, some pine forests in the states of
Estado de México and Puebla show dramatic fuel increases
(Rodríguez-Trejo 1996), as do some forests with heavy
surface fuels and dense regeneration in the Sierra Madre
Occidental (Fulé and Covington 1997). This case is typical
of preserves, parks, forests in which heavy grazing has elim-
inated herbaceous fuels, and several managed and/or well
fire-protected forests in which fire is used little or not at all.
Managers may be averse to fire use simply because it is feared
and its ecological relevance, complicated by human-caused
wildfires, is not well understood. In managed forests, silvi-
cultural treatments may be used to maintain pine dominance
by thinning fire-susceptible species from advanced succes-
sional stages, such as oaks. Nonetheless, in the absence of
fire the fuel load still increases every year. Where fire has
been excluded, it would be advantageous to use prescribed
burning to reduce the fuel load in general, to reduce activ-
ity (slash) fuels, to promote nutrient recycling, and to prepare
seed beds for future pine regeneration (Alanís-Morales 1995;
Alanís-Morales et al. 2000).
No single or simple formula for fire management can be
applied to the diversity of Mexican pine forests.All three fire
categories can be considered as part of a human and/or nat-
ural fire-gradient (Rodríguez-Trejo 1998a, 1999) and each
may require a variety of different responses depending on the
land’s ownership, managers’goals, economic value, and eco-
logical situation.As a guiding principle, however, we assume
that it is in Mexico’s best interest to preserve the ecosys-
tems that it presently has and to restore those ecosystems
that have been modified or have lost their original compo-
sition, structure, and function. In all three fire categories
discussed above, the point of reference for the use of fire
should be an understanding of the long-term, historical fire
regime. A starting point for management would be mim-
icking natural fire as much as possible and applying it to
reach clear and specific objectives at well-defined times.
Fire management plans, tiered to broader forest manage-
ment plans, should consider such factors as fire frequency
(considering both the average return period and variability),
intensity, areal extent, and season of burning. Potential bene-
fits of fire use, such as enhancing regeneration, maintaining
biodiversity and habitats, or fire hazard reduction, must be
balanced against the negative effects of fire, such as higher
erosion, smoke emissions, and the possibility of escaped fires
(Rodríguez-Trejo 2000a,b, 2001).
A fire management example
There is no uniform approach to fire management because
every forest has a unique ecological and social environment,
but here we present an example to illustrate concerns and
suggest management approaches for a specific place: La
Michilía biosphere reserve, on the Durango/Zacatecas bor-
der (latitude ∼23o 20′ N, longitude ∼104o 10′ W). The site
was established as a biosphere reserve because it is represen-
tative of millions of hectares of temperate forest in central
and northern Mexico (Barbault 1978). The reserve consists
of a 7000 ha core area managed for biological conservation
and an approximately 70 000 ha ‘buffer zone’ under private
or communal ownership. Forests range from dry oak-pine
woodlands around 2000 m elevation, pine–oak forests at mid-
elevations, to pine and mixed-conifer forests at elevations up
to 2985 m (González-Elizondo et al. 1993).
Prior to the 20th Century, surface fires recurred frequently
inalltheseforests,withfirereturnintervalsaveraging3.2–7.2
years (Fulé and Covington 1999). Between 1932 and 1945,
however, fires ceased over most the landscape as a result of
intensive livestock grazing; only the high-elevation core area
maintained a surface fire regime throughout the 20th Century
(Fulé and Covington 1999). The current management policy
of wildfire suppression has not been successful. An intense
fire burned about 10 000 ha of low-elevation forest in 1996
with substantial tree mortality (Fulé et al. 2000), an event
likely to foster long-term degradation (Barton 2002), while a
high-elevation forest fire in 1998 caused little environmental
damage but resulted in the death of a firefighter (A. García-
Arévalo, personal communication, 1999).
AnanalysisofthefiresituationatLaMichilíasuggeststhat
‘excessive fire’ does not appear to be a problem here, unlike
many other regions of Mexico. ‘Appropriate fire’ is a good
description of the high-elevation core area, a small but impor-
tant natural site. Currently, reserve managers feel obligated to
fight fires in order to demonstrate that they are protecting the
site. With documentation that the historic fire regime is rela-
tively undisrupted (Fulé and Covington 1999) and evidence
of fire-resistant forest structure (P.Z. Fulé, unpublished data),
managers may be able to design and defend an alternative
policy of allowing wildland fires to burn under certain con-
ditions. This approach would save money, avoid subjecting
firefighters to unnecessary risk, and maintain a key distur-
bance regime in the core. The largest portion of La Michilía
falls into the ‘insufficient fire’ category, where accumulated
living and dead fuels present a high hazard of severe fire (Fulé
et al. 2000). Allowing wildfires to burn in the low-elevation
forests would be inappropriate because of the threat of crown
fire, damage to trees and soils, and danger for people and
livestock. Instead, fire could serve as one of several restora-
tion tools. A combination of tree thinning and well-designed

34
D. A. Rodríguez-Trejo and P. Z. Fulé
harvest, with rapid burning of activity fuels, could produce
some economic benefit while creating fuelbreaks to reduce
future wildfire losses (Agee et al. 2000). Broadcast pre-
scribed fire could play a role in reducing forest floor material
and spurring understory growth. Ultimately, La Michilía and
similar regions will probably remain dominated by human
influences indefinitely, but a management approach closely
aligned with the natural fire ecology of the forests is more
likely than a simplistic fire suppression approach to favor a
sustainable and economically beneficial social/ecosystem.
Future challenges
Previously, fire was not broadly considered as an ecological
factor in Mexico, but this started to change in the past two
decades.Theuseofprescribedburnshasbeengrowinggradu-
ally, and support for fire management has been strengthened.
In some respects, the historic 1998 fire season was a setback
for the incorporation of fire into management, because of
the traumatic impact that the wildfires had on the public and
even on foresters, biologists, and government officials. But
the 1998 fire season also increased awareness of wildfires and
fire management among Mexicans (Rodríguez-Trejo 1998b).
The initial social responses to the 1998 fires appear to be
mixed.A reaction to increase protection from fire may benefit
pine forests in the short term but simply exacerbate the sever-
ity of future fires. Another reaction is increased support for
fire-related research, although such gains might not last long.
We suggest that a useful approach would be the application
of fire where appropriate, based on thoughtful consideration
of the ecological and social circumstances of specific forest
lands. There are several challenges to confront:
• Promote more fire-ecology research on fire regimes, fire
effects, and management alternatives; research should
include long-term monitoring and experimental compar-
isons.
• Increase the economic, human and material resources to
manage wildfire and prescribed burning.
• Educate society about the natural role of fire, including an
honest presentation of the risks and benefits of alternative
fire management approaches.
Perhaps the most fundamental challenge is to seek innova-
tive means and international support to reduce the economic
constraints that currently contribute to degradation of forests
in Mexico and much of the world. Because of the social and
economic aspects of the fire problem in Mexico, conserva-
tion and ecological restoration of pine forests, and in general
of all ecosystems, are likely to be reached only if the own-
ers of the land have access to more education and economic
opportunities.
