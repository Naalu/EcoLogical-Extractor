Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment of Upland Ecosystems 
US Forest Service Southwestern Region 
Introduction and Background 
Climate change is impacting western forests, woodlands, and arid-lands. Ecosystems in the 
southwestern US are expected to experience significant impacts to landscape processes and 
ecosystem function through increased temperature and decreased moisture, and increased wildfire 
activity. The projected trends towards warmer and drier conditions impact fire season length, forest 
fuels, amount of snowpack, and spring melt-off. The ecosystems may experience vegetation type 
conversions, invasive species, reduced carbon stocks, lower resilience to disturbance events, impacts 
to wildlife habitat and watershed health, and impacts to humans and communities. 
Effective land management requires an understanding of 
an ecosystem’s vulnerability to climate change impacts 
and the appropriate management responses to these 
threats. Climate Change Vulnerability Assessments 
(CCVAs) are tools that focus on species, habitats, or 
systems of interest and help identify risks to them from 
climate change impacts. In 2019, Triepke et al. completed 
a CCVA of upland ecosystems for the US Forest Service’s 
Southwestern Region (Region 3; Arizona and New 
Mexico) to quantify the potential impacts of climate 
change and vulnerability of these systems to projected 
change. 
The all-lands vulnerability assessment included major 
upland ecosystems of Arizona and New Mexico. Based on 
the anticipated effects of a changing climate to site 
potential, vulnerability was determined by the level of 
future climate departure from the pre-1990 climate 
envelope for given ecosystem types. The CCVA resulted 
in a probability surface (map) for Arizona and New 
Mexico representing the potential for significant change to 
ecosystem structure, composition, and processes, and 
probability of type conversion as a result of future climate 
conditions. This fact sheet summarizes the regional 
climate vulnerability assessment and provides a guide for 
managers looking to assess climate vulnerability within 
their landscape.

Key Messages 
• The Region 3 CCVA can be
used to support local planning,
project prioritization, and a
climate adaptation strategy
• The Region 3 CCVA should
be combined with local
knowledge of on the ground
conditions to inform
management prioritization and
landscape project decisions.
• Region 3 is developing an
adaptation strategy as an
additional component in an
overall climate adaptation
framework to help identify
management options for a
given circumstances of
vulnerability, current
conditions, and local
management objectives.

Methods 
Analysis Overview 
The Region 3 CCVA was an ecosystems approach to predicting vulnerability based on year 2090 
climate projections. The landscape was stratified into ecosystem types, or Ecological Response Units 
(ERUs), that repeat across the landscape. Base level polygons (segments) were generated for the 
analysis area by the US Forest Service Geospatial Technology Applications Center, with each 
segment representing similar site potential at the scale of individual plant communities. Polygons 
were attributed with biophysical, contemporary climate, and projected climate for multiple Global 
Climate Models (GCMs) and emissions scenarios. Climate envelopes were developed for each ERU 
based on pre-1990 climate data, according to the most discriminating climate variables. Finally, each 
segment was assigned a vulnerability score according to the projected departure in future climate 
from the characteristic climate envelope of each ERU. For a given reporting area (e.g., watershed, 
admin unit) vulnerability was summarized using graphics (Figures 1–3) and tabular summaries 
(Tables 1 and 2). The vulnerability surface (probability surface map) was tested against current 
patterns in ecological processes of fire severity, tree recruitment from lower life zones, plant 
production, and desert scrub encroachment into the Semi-Desert Grassland ERU; in all cases, there 
were significant relationships between these ongoing processes and vulnerability predictions. The 
CCVA did not include the desert ERUs due to issues (underrepresentation, low sample numbers) 
encountered in the initial interpretation of results. 
Climate Models 
Downscaled climate data for both pre-1990 and future projections were obtained from the US Forest 
Service Rocky Mountain Research Station Moscow Lab and included climate surfaces from multiple 
GCMs and emission scenarios. For this assessment, researchers scored the overall vulnerability using 
data derived from the CGCM3 GCM for the 2090 projection using the A1B emission scenario 
(moderate emissions).

and New Mexico.

Vulnerability
The Region 3 CCVA categorized climate vulnerability based on the projected difference between the 
historical climate envelope (pre-1990) and projected future climate (2061–2090) for a given location 
and ERU (Figure 1). Vulnerability was categorized as “low,” “moderate,” “high,” “very high” based 
on the level of climate envelope departure, with envelopes represented by the mean and two standard 
deviations (i.e., approx. 95% of the characteristic climate variability). For some analyses, “high” and 
“very high” categories were grouped as “high” and collectively represent areas expecting to exceed 
three standard deviations departure from mean envelope conditions (Table 1).  
Table 1. Vulnerability categories for upland ecosystems in Arizona and New Mexico. 
Uncertainty Reporting 
Uncertainty was assessed according to the level of agreement in vulnerability results among multiple 
global circulation models. Three GCMs were used to assess uncertainty (CGCM3, HADCM3, and 
GFDLCM21). This process was completed at the individual segment scale, and then aggregated up to 
watersheds as proportional values. The level of agreement was given by the following rule set: 
•
If all three GCMs produce the same vulnerability category, then uncertainty is “low.”
•
Otherwise, if two of the GCMs produce the same vulnerability category, then uncertainty is
“moderate.”
•
When all three GCMs differ on vulnerability, then uncertainty is “high.”
Category 
Rating 
Low Vulnerability: 
≤ 2 std of the envelope mean and are considered within their climate envelopes. 
Moderate Vulnerability: 
2-3 std standard deviations from the envelope mean.
High Vulnerability: 
3-4 std from the envelope mean.
Very High Vulnerability: 
≥4 std from the envelope mean. 
Key Points 
•
Uncertainty tends to be lower in basins and plains and greatest in mountainous terrain.
•
The magnitude of vulnerability provides an inference of uncertainty by the level of
predicted departure — areas of high vulnerability carry less uncertainty than moderate,
all else being equal.
•
Vulnerability can be considered the “relative probability of type conversion.”
•
Only those areas rated as low vulnerability in this assessment are expected to maintain a
climatic envelope characteristic of the ERU (i.e., within two standard deviations).

Interpretation of Results 
The CCVA infers vulnerability based on the projected climate departure from the historical climate 
envelope for a given ERU and location. In broad terms, it may be helpful to think of future climate 
simply as a potential stressor with the potential to cause significant change to structure, composition, 
function, and the vulnerability rating as an indicator of risk or probability of stress, either low, 
moderate, high, or very high. The thematic resolution of most ERUs is similar, and the ERU framework 
was modified to ensure normal distributions for key climate variables. As a result, the breadth of the 
climate envelopes is fairly similar among ERUs. An ERU with a relatively broad climate envelope is 
inherently less vulnerable, keeping in mind that climate departure also depends on the projected climate 
for a given location and on how a given plant community currently falls relative to its envelope.   
Vulnerability should be assessed at both the local and landscape scales. Relating the local vulnerability 
in the context of the broader ecosystem is an important step in determining the appropriate climate 
adaption approach for a given area. An ecosystem type with a high local vulnerability and a low 
landscape vulnerability will often warrant different management approaches from an ecosystem type 
with a low local vulnerability and a high context vulnerability (see Figure 2).  
At the project level, it is important to validate vulnerability findings by assessing ecosystem stress in 
the field (e.g., plant mortality, changing species composition, insect and disease, novel disturbances) or 
by considering other information on climate vulnerability for the same area. 
Vulnerability ratings are a consequence of three factors: 
•
Breadth of the envelope for a given ERU.
•
Current status of a given location relative to its ERU envelope.
•
Magnitude of projected change in climate at that location.
Example 
Vulnerability of Ponderosa Pine-Evergreen Oak (PPE) at local and landscape scales: The CCVA 
predictions indicate that the majority of PPE in the Southwest is in moderate to high+ climate 
vulnerability, but vulnerability can vary considerably by location, with areas of higher vulnerability 
concentrated in the southern extremities of the range of PPE (Figure 2). At the regional scale, PPE is 
less vulnerable than Ponderosa Pine Forest.

distribution of climate 
vulnerability for 
Ponderosa Pine-
Evergreen Oak (PPE).

Assessing vulnerability at multiple scales can help drive on the ground decision-making in a given area 
with climate change impacts. Evaluating climate vulnerability of a given location in the context of the 
vulnerability of the surrounding landscape can aid in informing management prioritization of an area 
and the selection of the appropriate management action. The watershed scale results of this CCVA can 
be generated, providing an additional scale to evaluate vulnerability. Region 3 has used watershed-
scale results to generate a vulnerability layer for 6th-level watersheds of the Southwest, according to 
area-weighted vulnerability scores of all CCVA polygons within each watershed (Figure 3). Watershed 
vulnerability ratings provide some inference of the vulnerability of these systems to 21st century 
climate trends. An all-lands Aquatic-Riparian Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment (ARCCVA) 
has also been completed and is available from the R3 GIS Library to aid in management planning.
