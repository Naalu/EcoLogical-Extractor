Executive Summary 
Portions of mixed conifer forests have undergone changes in disturbance regimes, species composition, 
and forest structure since European settlement and have been impacted by recent landscape-scale fires 
which have burned large patches with high severity. The Wallow Fire, the largest fire recorded in 
Arizona, burned a total of 217,741 ha (538,050 ac) in Arizona and New Mexico in the summer of 2011. 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate high-severity burn patch characteristics in the Wallow fire and 
determine if they were within the historical range of variability (HRV) for southwestern mixed conifer 
forests. We used a spatial pattern analysis program to evaluate patch metrics by severity for mixed conifer 
forests within the Wallow Fire perimeter. The major findings from this analysis indicate that: 
 
The Wallow Fire burned 31,643 ha (78,191 ac) of mixed conifer forest; 16,677 ha (41,210 ac), or 
53%, were classified as dry mixed conifer; 14,966 ha (36,981 ac), or 47%, were classified as wet 
mixed conifer. 
 
About 50% of the mixed conifer forest was classified as high severity based on the four-class 
RAVG layer; 48%, or 8,005 ha (19,780 ac), of dry mixed conifer forest, and 53%, or 7,932 ha 
(19,600 ac), of wet mixed conifer forest was classified as high severity. 
 
Less than 1% of high-severity patches in dry mixed conifer forest were greater than 50 ha (> 
123.5 ac) in size, however, these patches comprised 28% of the area classified as high severity. 
The largest patch classified as high-severity in dry mixed conifer was 221 ha (546 ac) in size. 
 
Only 2% of high-severity patches in dry mixed conifer forest were greater than 50 ha (> 123.5 ac) 
in size, however, these patches comprised 41% of the area classified as high severity. The largest 
patch classified as high-severity in dry mixed conifer was 387 ha (955 ac) in size. 
 
Between 28% and 69% of the dry mixed conifer forest burned outside the HRV based on our 
analysis of high-severity patches. 
 
Wet mixed conifer forests in the Wallow Fire were entirely within the HRV based on our analysis 
of high-severity burn patches. 
This study focused on the evaluation of high-severity patch characteristics to evaluate how mixed conifer 
forests burned in relation to reference conditions, however, it should be noted that areas that burned at 
lower severities, particularly, moderate severity, may have had beneficial effects consistent with 
outcomes observed following restoration treatments. 
Alternatively, although the analysis indicates that large patches of high-severity fire may be normal in wet 
mixed conifer forests, this does not mean that low- or moderate-severity burn patches are not normal nor 
would it preclude implementing forest treatments in wet mixed conifer areas if other values (e.g., private 
property, human structures) were in need of protection. 
Ultimately, managers, policy makers, and the public will have to decide what level of high-severity fire is 
acceptable and assess the tradeoffs of forest treatments in mixed conifer forests.

Introduction 
Mixed conifer forests occur across a broad continuum of climatic zones and have variable stand structure, 
species composition, and spatial patterns (Evans et al. 2011). Common overstory tree species in mixed 
conifer forests include fire-tolerant species such as ponderosa pine, southwestern white pine and Douglas-
fir, and fire-intolerant species such as white fir, subalpine/corkbark fir, aspen, and spruce. Mixed conifer 
forests in the western United States have undergone changes in disturbance regimes, species composition, 
and forest structure since European settlement (Stephens and Collins 2004, Heyerdahl et al. 2005, Beaty 
and Taylor 2008, Lydersen et al. 2013). Recent landscape-scale fires (e.g., Rodeo-Chediski Fire [2002], 
Hayman Fire [2002], Wallow Fire [2011]) have burned large patches within mixed conifer forest.  
In Arizona, mixed conifer forests cover approximately 191,000 ha (472,000 ac), or about 3% of the state’s 
total land cover. They generally occur between lower elevation pine stands and higher elevation stands of 
spruce and fir (Moir and Ludwig 1979, USGS 2004). While relatively rare in Arizona, mixed conifer 
forests provide important wildlife habitats, valuable biodiversity, and numerous recreational opportunities 
including hiking, camping, hunting, and skiing (Dolan and Rogstad 2007).  
Forest ecologists have identified two subtypes of mixed conifer forests: warm-dry mixed conifer 
(hereafter “dry mixed conifer”) and cool-moist mixed conifer (hereafter “wet mixed conifer”) (Romme et 
al. 2009). Historically, dry mixed conifer, which are generally found at lower elevations, was a relatively 
open forest that experienced frequent (< 50-year fire-return interval), low- to moderate-severity surface 
fires with high-severity fire occurring occasionally across a limited spatial extent (Smith 2006, Smith et 
al. 2008, Romme et al. 2009). Ponderosa pine was usually dominant or at least present in dry mixed 
conifer forests prior to fire exclusion (Reynolds et al. 2013). Contemporary dry mixed conifer forests are 
often dominated by mesic species due to the lack of surface fires during the last century (Reynolds et al. 
2013). Wet mixed conifer, which are generally found at higher elevations, historically experienced 
infrequent, mixed-severity fires (> 50-year fire return interval) with stand-replacing events occurring 
across large portions of this forest type (Romme et al. 2009). Due to this type of fire regime, the forest 
structure in wet mixed conifer was typically comprised of even-aged stands of shade-tolerant species with 
a closed canopy (Smith et al. 2008). Ponderosa pine was usually absent with mesic species dominant in 
wet mixed conifer forests prior to fire exclusion (Reynolds et al. 2013). Disturbance regimes in 
contemporary wet mixed conifer forests have not been severely altered, thus, these ecosystems are 
generally in a condition similar to their evolutionary environment. 
As is the case throughout the western United States, the stand structure, species composition, and fire 
regimes in most dry mixed conifer forests in the Southwest are currently outside the historical range of 
variability (HRV) (Dahms and Geils 1997, Landres et al. 1999). Many studies in the Southwest have 
focused on the dry mixed conifer subtype (Dieterich 1983, Touchan et al. 1996, Brown et al. 2001, Fulé et 
al. 2004a, Fulé et al. 2006, Heinlein et al. 2005). For example, Swetnam and Baisan (1996) summarized 
24 tree-ring based studies conducted in mixed conifer forests in Arizona and New Mexico and reported 
historical mean fire intervals ranging from about 4-26 years. Likewise, Reynolds et al. (2013) studied the 
historic forest structure at 15 southwestern dry mixed conifer sites and reported that average tree density 
ranged between 51.6-245.6 tph (20.9-99.4 tpa) while the average basal area was 9.1-28.5 m²/ha (39.6 -124 
ft²/ac). 
Information about reference conditions in southwestern wet mixed conifer forests is somewhat limited 
when compared to that of dry mixed conifer forests. Nonetheless, some good studies do exist. For 

4 
 
example, in a fire history study in mixed conifer forest at the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park, 
Fulé et al. (2003) found a mixed-severity fire regime with surface fire occurring predominantly on south 
aspects (dry mixed conifer) and evidence of fire-initiated stands (i.e., stand-replacing fire) occurring on 
wetter sites (wet mixed conifer). Meanwhile, Smith et al. (2008) report a fire-return interval between 22-
150 years in wet mixed conifer forests.  
Information about the historical spatial extent of high-severity fires in southwestern mixed conifer is 
likewise limited. For example, Brown et al. (2001) sampled dry mixed conifer forests in the Sacramento 
Mountains of New Mexico and obtained long-term inventories of past fires at the stand-scale (10 – 30 ha) 
and did not find evidence of historic crown fires. Similarly, Fulé et al. (2009) did not find evidence of 
historical high-severity fire in a stand-scale study in a southwestern Colorado mixed conifer forest. 
Although the study by Fulé et al. (2003) at the North Rim of the Grand Canyon did not explicitly 
differentiate between dry and wet mixed conifer, it can be inferred from their findings that high-severity 
burning historically occurred mostly in wet, not dry mixed conifer because fire-initiated plots were 
generally found on cool/wet north aspects. Williams and Baker (2012) used historical land surveys to 
reconstruct forest structure and predicted that substantial high-severity fire occurred historically in dry 
mixed conifer forests of Arizona. Direct historical evidence of broad-scale (100 ha to > 1000 ha or ≈250 
to > ≈2500 ac) patches of stand-replacing fire has been documented in southwestern wet mixed conifer 
forests (Margolis et al. 2007, 2011).  
The Wallow Fire, the largest fire recorded in Arizona, burned approximately 217,741 ha (538,050 ac) in 
Arizona (97% of the area) and New Mexico (3% of the area) during the summer of 2011 
(www.inciweb.org). Prior to the fire, about 27,841 ha (68,796 ac) were classified as mixed conifer based 
on LANDFIRE data (Wadleigh 2011). Following the fire, managers and researchers raised questions 
regarding how mixed conifer forests burned in relation to reference conditions. The purpose of this study 
was to evaluate wildfire effects in mixed conifer forests of the Wallow Fire compared to reference 
conditions. Specifically, our goal was to evaluate high-severity burn patch characteristics and determine if 
they were within the HRV for southwestern mixed conifer forests. 
Methods 
In order to meet our goal of understanding how mixed conifer forests responded to the Wallow Fire 
compared to reference conditions, we employed two different methods: 1) undertaking a review of the 
literature to identify site-specific reference conditions, and 2) use of a spatial pattern analysis program to 
evaluate fire severity within the Wallow Fire perimeter. 
Historic forest structure 
We performed a literature review to confirm that site-specific reference conditions for structure, species 
composition, and disturbance in mixed conifer forests within, and adjacent to, the Wallow Fire were 
similar to general reference conditions for mixed conifer forests. Although we did not find any studies 
reporting site-specific reference conditions for stand structure and species composition, we obtained three, 
0.5-0.8 ha (1.2-2.0 ac), historic stem maps from 1911 showing all tree structures in three mixed conifer 
areas within or directly adjacent to the Wallow Fire perimeter (Figure 1; Sánchez-Meador, unpublished 
data). We counted the overstory structures by species on the plot maps to determine historical stand 
structure and composition.

Evaluation of patch metrics 
We used the mid-scale dominance type classification produced by the USDA Forest Service (Triepke et 
al. 2005) as the base layer for the analysis. (Dominance type classifications are a way to organize plant 
communities according to existing, as opposed to potential, natural vegetation). We selected the 
dominance type descriptors “douglas-fir”, “white fir”, and “aspen-evergreen tree mix” to create a “mixed 
conifer” layer. We subdivided the mixed conifer layer into dry mixed conifer and wet mixed conifer using 
the “vegetation type” field from the Terrestrial Ecosystem Survey (TES) layer (USFS 1998) in ArcGIS 
(ESRI 2011). Vegetation types that included mixed conifer species (e.g., Douglas-fir, white fir, etc.) plus 
ponderosa pine were classified as “dry mixed conifer,” while those that included mixed conifer species 
without the presence of ponderosa pine were classified as “wet mixed conifer.” We then intersected the 
dry and wet mixed conifer layers with the Rapid Assessment of Vegetation Condition after Wildfire 
(RAVG) layer, which uses immediate basal area (BA) loss to determine fire severity (USFS 2011). We 
used the four-class RAVG layer that classified severity as follows: unburned (0% BA loss), low (≤ 25% 
BA loss), moderate (> 25% and ≤ 75% BA loss), and high (≥ 75% BA mortality). We clipped all layers to 
a truncated perimeter (area = 210,170 ha or 519,342 ac) that excluded Apache Reservation lands and 
areas of New Mexico that burned in the Wallow Fire because those data were unavailable. We used 
FRAGSTATS (v4), a spatial pattern analysis program, to evaluate patch metrics by severity for mixed 
conifer forests within the Wallow Fire perimeter. FRAGSTATS is designed to compute a wide variety of 
landscape metrics for categorical map patterns (McGarigal et al. 2012). We imported the ArcGIS files for 
dry and wet mixed conifer into FRAGSTATS and ran the program to produce the following patch metrics 
for each severity class: area, proportion of the landscape, area-weighted mean patch size, largest patch 
index, and patch density (Table 1). 
Criteria for determining historical range of variability in southwestern mixed conifer forests 
We reviewed existing literature to determine if the size of high-severity burn patches in the Wallow Fire 
were within the HRV for southwestern mixed conifer forests. For dry mixed conifer forests, evidence 
from the North Rim of the Grand Canyon (Fulé et al. 2003) indicated that some high-severity fire 
occurred historically at the stand-scale (< 10 ha or 25 ac). We did not find evidence that broad-scale (> 50 
ha or 123.5 ac) high-severity fires occurred historically. We, therefore, determined that high-severity burn 
patches less than 10 ha (25 ac) were within the HRV while burn patches greater than 50 ha (123.5 ac) 
were outside the HRV for dry mixed conifer forests in the Wallow Fire. We were less certain about high-
severity burn patches from 10-50 ha (25-123.5 ac) in size and evaluated this category as both within and 
outside HRV for comparison. For wet mixed conifer, high-severity patches from 0 to greater than 1000 ha 
(0 to greater than 2471 ac) were considered within the HRV.

Results 
Verification of mixed conifer reference conditions for the Wallow Fire 
We did not find any studies that documented site-specific reference conditions for structure or species 
composition in mixed conifer forests within or directly adjacent to the Wallow Fire. However, using 
unpublished data from three historical plots originally mapped by T.S. Woolsey, Jr. in 1911, we were able 
to determine site-specific information for overstory tree density and species composition for the dry 
mixed conifer subtype (Figure 1, Table 2). Mean tree density for all species was 328.4 trees per hectare 
(132.9 trees per acre) and ranged between 29.5-369.4 tph (120-149.5 tpa) on the three historic plots 
(Table 2). We found one fire history study that was conducted in a dry mixed conifer forest within the 
Wallow Fire. Dieterich (1983) reported a mean fire interval of 22 years prior to 1900 in the Thomas 
Creek Experimental Watershed. We did not find any information documenting site-specific reference 
conditions for wet mixed conifer forests within or adjacent to the Wallow Fire. 
Mixed conifer 
The Wallow Fire burned 31,643 ha (78,191 ac) of mixed conifer forest based on the mid-scale dominance 
type classification (Triepke et al. 2005). This figure accounts for about 15% of the area within the Wallow 
Fire perimeter used in this study (Figures 2 and 3). Based on RAVG burn severity rating, about 16% of 
mixed conifer forest was classified as unburned, about 19% as low severity, about 15% as moderate 
severity, and about 50% as high severity. 
Dry mixed conifer patch metrics 
Based on TES data, about 16,677 ha (41,210 ac), or 53% of the overall mixed conifer forest, were 
classified as dry mixed conifer (Figure 2, Table 3). Sixteen percent of the dry mixed conifer within the 
Wallow Fire perimeter was classified as unburned, 21% as low severity, about 15% as moderate severity, 
and about 48% as high severity (Table 3). 
The area-weighted mean patch size in dry mixed conifer forest was less than 20 ha (< 50 ac) for 
unburned, low, and moderate severity classes compared to high-severity patches, which averaged more 
than 40 ha (> 100 ac) in size (Table 3). The largest patch classified as high-severity in dry mixed conifer

was 221 ha (546 ac) in size. The largest patch index, or the percentage of the landscape comprised by the 
largest patch, was greater than 1% for areas classified as high severity and less than 1% for areas 
classified as unburned, low, or moderate severity. Patch density, or the number of patches of the 
corresponding patch type divided by the total landscape area, ranged between 13.5-29.0 patches per 100 
ha, and was highest in the moderate severity areas of dry mixed conifer forest (Table 3). 
The distribution of high-severity burn patches by size class for dry mixed conifer forest is shown in 
Figure 4. About 71% of high-severity patches in the dry mixed conifer forest type were less than 1 ha (2.5 
ac), although the area of these patches accounted for only 6% of the area classified as high severity 
(Figure 4). About 22% of high-severity patches were 1-10 ha (2.5-25.0 ac) in size and about 6% were 10-
50 ha (25.0-123.5 ac) in size, but these patches comprised 66% of the area classified as high severity 
(Figure 4). Less than 1% of high-severity patches were greater than 50 ha (> 123.5 ac) in size, and these 
patches comprised 28% of the area classified as high severity (Figure 4). 
Wet mixed conifer patch metrics 
Based on TES data, about 14,966 ha (36,981 ac), or 47% of the overall mixed conifer forest, were 
classified as wet mixed conifer (Figure 3, Table 3). About 16% of the wet mixed conifer within the 
Wallow Fire perimeter was classified as unburned, 17% as low severity, about 14% as moderate severity, 
and about 53% as high severity (Table 3).

The area-weighted mean patch size in wet mixed conifer forest was less than 30 ha (< 74 ac) for 
unburned, low, and moderate severity classes compared to high-severity patches, which averaged about 
66 ha (163 ac) in size (Table 3). The largest patch classified as high severity in wet mixed conifer was 
387 ha (955 ac) in size. The largest patch index was more than 2.5% for the high severity class and 1% or 
less for all other severity classes. Patch density ranged between 11.0-26.4 patches per 100 ha, and was 
highest in the moderate-severity areas of wet mixed conifer forest (Table 3). 
The distribution of high-severity patches by size classes is shown in Figure 5. Nearly two-thirds of high-
severity patches in the wet mixed conifer forest type were less than 1 ha (2.5 ac), although the area of 
these patches accounted for less than 4% of the area classified as high severity (Figure 5). About 26% of 
high-severity patches were 1-10 ha (2.5-25.0 ac) in size and about 8% were 10-50 ha (25.0-123.5 ac) in 
size, but these patches comprised about 55% of the area classified as high severity (Figure 5). Only 2% of 
high-severity patches were greater than 50 ha (> 123.5 ac) in size, and these patches comprised about 
41% of the area classified as high severity (Figure 5).  
Discussion 
Verification of mixed conifer reference conditions in the Wallow Fire 
Mixed conifer forests are one of the most variable and complex forest types in terms of stand structure, 
species composition, and disturbance regimes (Romme et al. 2009). Due to the limited geographical scope 
of this study, our approach was to use regional and local reference conditions for the Wallow Fire, if 
possible, rather than using more general information from other mixed conifer sites located throughout 
the western United States. Although forest structure variables, such as tree density and basal area, are not 
always directly correlated with fire severity, they contribute to the overall understanding of fire behavior 
dynamics.

The 15 sites summarized by Reynolds et al. (2013) provided adequate regional reference condition 
information for stand structure, however, we did not find any published studies reporting mixed conifer 
reference conditions for stand structure located within or directly adjacent to the Wallow Fire. 
Fortunately, we were able to obtain three detailed maps of historic plots established in dry mixed conifer 
sites within or near the Wallow Fire. The average tree density of 209 tph (85 tpa) for trees greater than 10 
cm (> 4 in.) dbh found on the plots in 1911 (Table 2), several decades after Euro-American settlement, 
falls within the range of 52 – 255 tph (21 – 99 tpa) for southwestern dry mixed conifer forests reported by 
Reynolds et al. (2013). This is a reasonable estimate of tree density given that most of the trees less than 
10 cm (< 4 in.) dbh were likely to have established in the three decades preceding plot establishment in 
1911. Even if all trees from the Woolsey plots are included, the average density of 328 tph (133 tpa) is 
only slightly outside the range reported by Reynolds et al. (2013), thus verifying that historic tree density 
within and near the Wallow Fire was similar to other southwestern dry mixed conifer sites. The mean fire 
interval of 22 years reported by Dieterich (1983) verified that the frequent fire regime at Thomas Creek, a 
dry mixed conifer site within the Wallow Fire, was similar to other southwestern sites (Swetnam and 
Baisan 1996). 
Fire severity in mixed conifer forests of the Wallow Fire compared to reference conditions 
While we found studies that reported information about historical fire regimes and stand structure in 
southwestern mixed conifer forests, many did not explicitly differentiate between the dry and wet 
subtype. This, along with the fact that none of the studies reported information about the size of historic 
high-severity burn patches in dry mixed conifer forests, made it difficult to determine an exact patch size 
threshold that would indicate if observed fire severity was within the HRV in the Wallow Fire. It is likely 
that high-severity fire burned patches up to 10 ha (25 ac) in size and unlikely that high-severity patches 
greater than 50 ha (123.5 ac) occurred historically in southwestern dry mixed conifer. We are less certain 
about what occurred at the 10-50 ha (25.0-123.5 ac) scale. 
Dry mixed conifer forests in the Wallow Fire were not entirely within the HRV based on our analysis of 
high-severity patches. High-severity fire burned 48% of the dry mixed conifer forest in the Wallow Fire. 
The mean patch size in those areas was more than 40 ha (> 100 ac), compared to the other three classes 
which all had a mean patch size of less than 20 ha (< 50 ac), indicating that as severity increased, the fire 
burned more homogeneously across the landscape. The largest high-severity burn patch was more than 
200 ha (> 500 ac) in size, comprising more than 1% of the landscape—an area much larger than would 
have historically burned in southwestern dry mixed conifer. Although more than 90% of the high-severity 
patches were less than 10 ha (< 25 ac) in size, their combined area amounted to only 30% of the total area 
of dry mixed conifer forest. Alternatively, about 7% of the high-severity patches were greater than 10 ha 
(> 25 ac) in size, and comprised nearly 70% of the dry mixed conifer landscape. Assuming that high-
severity patches 10-50 ha (25.0-123.5 ac) in size burned in pre-settlement dry mixed conifer, a minimum 
of 28% of the Wallow Fire landscape burned outside the HRV. Assuming those patches would not have 
burned historically, 69%, or 11,583 ha (28,621 ac), of dry mixed conifer forest in the Wallow Fire would 
be considered outside the HRV. Even at the low estimate, 4,660 ha (11,515 ac) of mixed conifer forest 
burned outside the HRV increasing the potential for erosion and flooding, loss of wildlife habitat, and loss 
of recreational opportunities in the Wallow Fire.

Wet mixed conifer forests in the Wallow Fire were entirely within the HRV based on our analysis of 
high-severity burn patches. High-severity fire burned more than half of the wet mixed conifer forest in the 
Wallow Fire. The mean patch size in those areas was about 66 ha (163 ac), which was more than 1.5 
times larger than the mean patch size found in the dry mixed conifer forest, supporting the conclusion that 
the occurrence of high-severity fire was historically more widespread in wet mixed conifer forests 
compared to dry mixed conifer forests. The largest high-severity patch was 387 ha (955 ac) in size, more 
than 2.5% of the landscape, which was within the HRV for wet mixed conifer forests as reported by 
Margolis et al. (2007, 2011). 
Conclusions 
This study provides an analysis of patches across four severity classes in the Wallow Fire. The overall 
assessment from the analysis indicates that mixed conifer forests in the Wallow were not entirely within 
the HRV based on the size of high-severity burn patches compared to reference conditions. Specifically, 
the results suggest that portions of the dry mixed conifer burned outside the HRV and that the entire wet 
mixed conifer forest burned within the HRV documented in the literature. This study focused on the 
evaluation of high-severity patch characteristics to evaluate how mixed conifer forests burned in relation 
to reference conditions, however, it should be noted that areas that burned at lower severities, particularly, 
moderate severity, may have had beneficial effects, including reductions of tree density and surface fuels, 
consistent with outcomes observed following restoration treatments (Fulé et al. 2004b). Alternatively, 
although the analysis indicates that large patches of high-severity fire may be normal in wet mixed conifer 
forests, this does not mean that low- or moderate-severity burn patches are not normal nor would it 
preclude implementing forest treatments in wet mixed conifer areas if other values (e.g., private property, 
human structures) were in need of protection. Ultimately, managers, policy makers, and the public will 
have to decide what level of high-severity fire is acceptable and assess the tradeoffs of forest treatments in 
mixed conifer forests.
