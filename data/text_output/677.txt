Abstract.
Post-ﬁre predictions of forest recovery under future climate change and
management actions are necessary for forest managers to make decisions about treatments.
We applied the Climate-Forest Vegetation Simulator (Climate-FVS), a new version of a widely
used forest management model, to compare alternative climate and management scenarios in a
severely burned multispecies forest of Arizona, USA. The incorporation of seven
combinations of General Circulation Models (GCM) and emissions scenarios altered long-
term (100 years) predictions of future forest condition compared to a No Climate Change
(NCC) scenario, which forecast a gradual increase to high levels of forest density and carbon
stock. In contrast, emissions scenarios that included continued high greenhouse gas releases
led to near-complete deforestation by 2111. GCM-emissions scenario combinations that were
less severe reduced forest structure and carbon stock relative to NCC. Fuel reduction
treatments that had been applied prior to the severe wildﬁre did have persistent effects,
especially under NCC, but were overwhelmed by increasingly severe climate change. We tested
six management strategies aimed at sustaining future forests: prescribed burning at 5, 10, or
20-year intervals, thinning 40% or 60% of stand basal area, and no treatment. Severe climate
change led to deforestation under all management regimes, but important differences emerged
under the moderate scenarios: treatments that included regular prescribed burning fostered
low density, wildﬁre-resistant forests composed of the naturally dominant species, ponderosa
pine. Non-ﬁre treatments under moderate climate change were forecast to become dense and
susceptible to severe wildﬁre, with a shift to dominance by sprouting species. Current U.S.
forest management requires modeling of future scenarios but does not mandate consideration
of climate change effects. However, this study showed substantial differences in model outputs
depending on climate and management actions. Managers should incorporate climate change
into the process of analyzing the environmental effects of alternative actions.

INTRODUCTION
Climate change is altering forest ﬁre regimes by
shifting vegetation distributions (Lenoir et al. 2008),
creating hotter, drier, and longer ﬁre seasons (West-
erling et al. 2006), and interacting with uncharacteris-
tically high fuel loads to produce ﬁres of record size,
severity, and cost in dry coniferous forests of North
America and Europe (Finney et al. 2005, Miller et al.
2009, San-Miguel-Ayanz et al. 2013). In dry forest types
that were historically characterized by frequent surface-
ﬁre regimes, such as ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa),
management interventions aimed at reducing fuels and
restoring the functional properties of surface ﬁre regimes
have been demonstrated to reduce wildﬁre severity (Fule´
et al. 2012, Safford et al. 2012, Stephens et al. 2012).
However, there is limited understanding of how the
climate–fuel–ﬁre relationship may change under future
climate conditions, so it is not clear which approaches
may help managers conserve native ecosystems in place,
or allow forested landscapes to adapt gradually in
composition and structure (Millar et al. 2007), to novel
environmental conditions over the next century.
The Rodeo-Chediski ﬁre of 2002 that burned 189 658
ha in Arizona, USA, was the largest and most severe
wildﬁre to have burned in southwestern U.S. forests to
that date, adding urgency to the call for the implemen-
tation of fuel reduction policies. Fuel reduction treat-
ments had been implemented on some areas of the
landscape burned over by the Rodeo-Chediski ﬁre.
Finney et al. (2005) used satellite data to show that ﬁre
behavior became less intense, often changing from
crown ﬁre to surface ﬁre, as the ﬁre fronts moved
through treated patches. Postﬁre studies on the ground

in the forested areas of the burn conﬁrmed that treated
sites experienced lower ﬁre severity than untreated sites,
resulting in higher survival of overstory trees (Cram et
al. 2006). Postﬁre forest structure and plant communi-
ties differed by ﬁre severity, with more severely burned
sites having few surviving trees, many sprouting trees,
and high understory production (Cram et al. 2006,
Strom and Fule´ 2007, Kuenzi et al. 2008, Ffolliott et al.
2011).
The shift to dominance by sprouting species and loss
of the formerly dominant seeding species, ponderosa
pine, implies a long-term change in vegetation charac-
teristics and perhaps conversion from forest to shrub-
land or grassland for a number of decades (Haire and
McGarigal 2010) or indeﬁnitely (Savage and Mast
2005). Strom and Fule´
(2007) simulated vegetation
change for 100 years following the ﬁre to assess the long-
term effects of fuel treatments on paired treated-
untreated sites. Results indicated that preﬁre treatments
affected the forest for over a century, leading to
distinctly different vegetation trajectories: ponderosa
pine/Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) forest in treated
sites, and oak/manzanita (Arcotostaphylos spp.) shrub-
ﬁelds in a matrix with junipers (Juniperus spp.) and New
Mexico locust (Robinia neomexicana) in untreated sites.
They concluded that fuel treatments were valuable for
sustaining the native forest in the face of severe wildﬁre
conditions (Strom and Fule´ 2007).
The simulation model used by Strom and Fule´ (2007),
the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS), is a statistical
model used for predicting forest stand dynamics (Dixon
2011). The FVS model and its extensions are used by
many management agencies to simulate forest stand
development, compare management treatments, and
assess ecological disturbances effects in speciﬁc geo-
graphic areas of the United States. FVS affects the
foundations of forest management on U.S. public lands
because it is the most widely applied model for planning
and environmental assessment on the National Forest
System, supporting decisions that have important
ecological, social, and economic ramiﬁcations. FVS is
valued for planning at decadal to century scales because
it permits assessment of silvicultural treatments and
provides highly precise outputs. The FVS model was
designed to take advantage of widely used ﬁeld
measurements and is available for free download,
supported by a permanent staff, and accompanied by
extensive low-cost training opportunities, with variants
for all major forest types in the United States.
The original FVS system had no formal mechanism
for incorporating climate or climate change because the
tree growth models of FVS were based on regression
models of tree growth measured on research plots over
past decades. However, a suite of models predict the
future climate of the southwestern United States to
change abruptly and dramatically to drier conditions
(Seager et al. 2007) with potentially large impacts on
species distributions (Rehfeldt et al. 2006). Because
considerable uncertainty remains regarding the timing
and magnitude of change, researchers have long
recognized the importance of including alternative
future climate scenarios in vegetation modeling (Mal-
colm et al. 2002). The problem for site-speciﬁc forest
management is that while vegetation simulation models
that incorporate climate change have been used in
research for many years, there has been a disconnect
between research and practice. Models that simulate
ecological processes such as photosynthesis and respi-
ration (e.g., the BioGeoChemical [BGC] family of
models [Running and Coughlan 1988]) readily accom-
modate climate change because climatic variables of
precipitation or temperature are direct inputs. However,
these models require parameter data that can be difﬁcult
to obtain (Keane et al. 1996). In contrast, forest
managers require detailed model outputs that give
precise forecasts of future stand structure and biomass.
Models such as the original FVS, developed to predict
growth and yield based on highly accurate ﬁeld studies,
were not designed to take into account the possibility
that climate could change. Recently researchers have
sought to develop more useful modeling approaches by
integrating process and statistical models (e.g., FVS-
BGC [Milner et al. 2003]). Climate-FVS, developed by
Crookston et al. (2010), is a new model integrated
seamlessly within FVS. Climate-FVS uses plant–climate
relationships in conjunction with predictions of climate
change from General Circulation Models to obtain plant
responses relating carrying capacity, mortality, tree
growth, and regeneration to future climate (Rehfeldt et
al. 2012).
Our goal in the present study was to reassess the
possible future trajectories of treated and untreated sites
burned in the Rodeo-Chediski ﬁre using the Climate-
FVS model to incorporate climate change effects. In
2011, we remeasured the plots originally established in
2004 and applied the Climate-FVS model to ask the
following questions: (1) Did the forest conditions in
2011 match previously published predictions? (2) How
did the incorporation of climate change effects alter
long-term (100-year) forecasts of future forest condi-
tion? And (3) how do alternative future management
regimes of ﬁre use and tree cutting mitigate or
exacerbate climate change effects? In each case, we
compared variables of forest structure (basal area and
tree density by species) and carbon content.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study area
The study area is located in the Apache-Sitgreaves
National Forest in northeastern Arizona. Our sites
ranged in elevation from 1990 to 2072 m. The soils
varied from clays to sandy loams. Annual climate
averages for the period of record of 1 August 1950 to
30 June 2012 from the Heber Ranger Station (Western
Regional Climate Center) were, precipitation, 438 mm;
snowfall, 955 mm; average maximum temperature, 198C

SIMULATING FUTURE FOREST TRAJECTORIES

(July maximum temperature 298C; data available on-
line).5 Forests are predominantly ponderosa pine (P.
ponderosa ssp. scopulorum), with a mixture of Gambel
oak and alligator juniper (J. deppeana). The understory
includes New Mexico locust.
After the Rodeo-Chediski ﬁre in 2002, Forest Service
staff identiﬁed seven stands that had received fuel
reduction treatments of noncommercial thinning and
slash disposal within 12 years prior to the Rodeo-
Chediski ﬁre. In 2004, the seven treated stands and seven
paired untreated stands were sampled with 10 perma-
nently marked plots per stand (total 140 plots) by Strom
and Fule´ (2007).
Measurement of current forest conditions
In 2011, we remeasured the same seven pairs of
treated/untreated stands sampled in 2004 by Strom and
Fule´ (2007). We relocated all 10 plots in each stand,
except for four stands in which we could not ﬁnd one of
the plots. In total, we remeasured 136 plots, 70 in treated
areas and 66 in untreated areas.
The measurement protocols were the same as in the
initial study (Strom and Fule´
2007). Trees were
measured on a variable-radius plot using a prism with
a basal area factor of 2.3 m2ha1tree1. We recorded
diameter at breast height (dbh; 1.37 m), tree condition,
and height. Tree and shrub regeneration density were
measured in a ﬁxed-area subplot with 3.6 m radius by
species, and height class (0–40 cm, .40–80 cm, .80–
137 cm). Downed woody biomass and forest ﬂoor depth
were measured along a 15.2-m planar transect (Brown
1974) in each plot. We converted litter and duff depth to
forest ﬂoor fuel loadings in Mg/ha.
Forest simulation and climate change modeling
We simulated vegetation change for 100 years,
matching the time scale used by Strom and Fule´
(2007), but we used the Climate-FVS model (Climate-
FVS; Crookston et al. 2010) rather than the original
FVS model (Dixon 2011), in order to assess the effects of
potential climate scenarios. Climate-FVS was described
in detail by Crookston et al. (2010); we summarize the
key features in the online Appendix A.
Within Climate-FVS, we used the southwest Ponder-
osa Pine model of the Central Rockies variant, which
represents forests types in the Rocky Mountain region
of the United States, including Arizona, specifying the
Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest code location (Key-
ser et al. 2008). Model simulations were projected for
2011–2111 in 10-year increments. Site index, deﬁned as
the height of dominant or codominant trees at an index
age of 100 years for ponderosa pine, was calculated from
height and age measurements on our sites. We compared
tree diameters and height measurements in 2004 and
2011 for all species to calculate growth rates, which are
used in Climate-FVS for empirical calibration of
simulated tree growth.
To simulate regeneration events using ﬁeld measure-
ments, we compared two regeneration scenarios in a
manner similar to Strom and Fule´ (2007) so that the
results could be compared directly. Regen-1 correspond-
ed to the regeneration measured in 2011, while Regen-2
added a second regeneration episode 20 years later with
the same composition and density of regeneration as in
2011. The intent of the Regen-2 scenarios was to
simulate ponderosa pine’s episodic regeneration (Savage
et al. 1996).
The GCMs were run under different emissions
scenarios, reﬂecting alternative possible levels of green-
house gas emissions. In general, A2 scenarios predict
continuous increment on gas emissions while A1B, B1,
and B2 predict restrictions on gas emissions. The GCM-
emissions scenario combinations thus covered a range of
moderate to severe climate change, and we also included
a no-climate-change condition (NCC; Table 1). The
predictors used by Climate-FVS to adjust climate effects
were mean annual temperature, growing season precip-
itation, mean temperature of the coldest month, mean
minimum temperature, degree days above 58C (dd5),
day of the year (with 1 January ¼ 1) that dd5 reaches
100, and degree days below 08C (Fig. 1).
Validation of the Climate-FVS model has various
aspects. No simulation model can give an unequivocal
answer about forest conditions under future climates,
but Climate-FVS was developed from one of the largest
data sets of species presence and climate variability in
North America. The Climate-FVS model was developed
from Forest Inventory and Analysis data covering the
western United States. The dominant species for our
modeling, ponderosa pine, was present on 24 280 sample
points out of about 117 000 observations (Crookston et
al. 2010). Validation was carried out by comparing
model predictions against a random 40 000 observations
removed from the full data set. The prediction of species
presence/absence based on climate variables, which
forms the basis for predicting species viability scores
under future climate, had low error rates (average 5.1%
misclassiﬁcation; Crookston et al. 2010). The bioclimatic
modeling that serves as the basis for determining species
viability scores is difﬁcult to assess under current
climate, but Rehfeldt et al. (2009) took advantage of
recent mortality of aspen (Populus tremuloides) to show
that it was consistent with abrupt shifts in four of the
eight variables of the climate proﬁle in 2000–2003,
helping validate the utility of the approach. Speciﬁcally
for our study, we calibrated the species-speciﬁc diameter
and height growth models with ﬁeld data measured in
2004 and 2011, and we tested the initial Climate-FVS
outputs at the end of the ﬁrst decadal modeling period
against the 2011 ﬁeld data.
Viability scores were included in the Get Climate-FVS
Ready Data set but for New Mexico locust due to the
fact that FVS model does not presently include this

species. In order to use New Mexico locust viability
scores, we inserted them in the ﬁle under Emory oak
(Quercus emoryi), the most similar sprouting hardwood
species that FVS recognizes (see Supplement).
Comparing alternative management regimes
We tested several alternative future management
regimes based on the practical options available to
forest managers, developed from interviews with man-
agers (Diggins et al. 2010) and the literature (Stephens et
al. 2012, Fule´ et al. 2012). These included: no treatment
(NT), application of ﬁre at varying intervals through
prescribed burning, and tree thinning. For ﬁre treat-
ments, we introduced the amount of dead surface fuels
from ﬁeld measurements by fuel size class and ran three
simulations with different prescribed burning intervals:
5, 10, and 20 years, under each regeneration and GCM-
emissions scenario using the Fire and Fuels Extension
(FFE) to FVS (Rebain 2010). The shorter ﬁre return
intervals were similar to the ﬁre regime prior to the late

SIMULATING FUTURE FOREST TRAJECTORIES

19th century (Swetnam and Baisan 2003), while the 20-
year interval reﬂected the practical usefulness of a longer
ﬁre-free period to reduce costs, smoke, and mortality to
trees stressed by climate (Diggins et al. 2010). We used
the following weather and burning conditions in FFE:
wind speed was 8.9 km/h, moisture level was 2 (dry),
temperature was 10.48C, and the area of the stand
burned was 70%. The weather data were taken from the
1964–1996 averages at Heber Ranger Station for
October, the most common month for prescribed
burning. The FFE model tracks changes in fuel loading
from Climate-FVS outputs, including litterfall, tree
mortality adding coarse woody debris, and decomposi-
tion. The ﬁre behavior fuel model used was 9, tree litter
(Anderson 1982).
We simulated two thinning treatments, both of which
were thinning from below at a 50-year interval (2041 and
2091). The Thin 40 scenario removed 40% of basal area
and the Thin 60 scenario removed 60%. Ponderosa pine
was the only species removed. Trees removed had a dbh
, 41 cm, which is the generally largest dbh considered
for removal in ponderosa restoration (Allen et al. 2002).
If small ponderosa trees were not available in the
simulated forest at the time of the thinning, the
treatment had no effect.
The average live aboveground carbon stock for each
simulation was calculated at 10-year intervals. For each
10-year growth cycle, total aboveground tree C stocks
were calculated using the existing FFE biomass algo-
rithms. Biomass estimates are converted to units of
carbon applying conversion factors (Rebain 2010).
Statistical descriptions of results are reported on a per-
site basis (N ¼ 7 sites each for treated and untreated
forests).
RESULTS
Did the forest conditions in 2011 match short-term
predictions?
The 2011 measurements were either similar to the
2004 values or changed in a manner consistent with the
short-term predictions made by Strom and Fule´ (2007).
For example, the treated forest sites where large
overstory trees survived the ﬁre were unchanged
(average 331 trees/ha in 2004, 330 in 2011; Table 2),
whereas the untreated sites had a large inﬂux of small
trees, mostly from sprouting alligator juniper (Table 2),
as forecasted in the Strom and Fule´ (2007) study. By
2011 the untreated sites were 33% higher in average
density than the treated sites, but because the trees were
mostly small in diameter, total basal area was still 350%
higher in the treated sites (Fig. 2). Regeneration was still
dominated by oak and locust, as well as juniper, but the
very high densities of these species encountered in 2004
had declined by 2011, reaching levels that were 68%,
26%, and 92% less than the 2004 densities, respectively.
Meanwhile, ponderosa pine regeneration in untreated
sites increased by 90% relative to 2004, reaching a level
comparable to that of treated sites, averaging 140 trees/
ha. Additional details of fuel and forest structural
conditions on these study sites in 2011 were presented by
Stevens-Rumann et al. (2013), who carried out an
assessment of post-wildﬁre fuel change.
We compared overstory density and regeneration
density across treatment (treated, untreated) and time
of measurement (2004, 2011) using a multifactorial
MANOVA analysis. Treatment was the only statisti-
cally signiﬁcant factor (Wilks’ k ¼ 0.44, F1,24 ¼ 9.111,

P , 0.001) explaining density differences of overstory
trees (Appendix B: Table B1); whereas time was the
only statistically signiﬁcant factor (Wilks’ k ¼ 0.29,
F1,24 ¼ 12.529, P , 0.001) for regeneration (Appendix
B: Table B2). ANOVA analyses performed on the
individual responses showed time as the variable
explaining ponderosa pine densities’ difference between
treatments (Appendix B: Table B3). Time showed
statistical signiﬁcance on all the species’ regeneration
excluding New Mexico locust (Appendix B: Table B4).
Based on our results, pre-wildﬁre treatment was the key
factor for the greater post ﬁre ponderosa pine survival.
Regeneration was similar between treated and untreat-
ed areas, but was not signiﬁcant for New Mexico locust
probably because it was just present on 6 of the 136
sampled plots.
Simulation results at the end of the closest modeled
period (2014) closely matched the 2011 ﬁeld measure-
ments (Fig. 2). Simulated basal areas in 2014 for treated
and untreated sites, respectively, averaged 16.0 and
3.4 m2/ha. The corresponding measured basal areas in
2011 were 13.5 and 2.8 m2/ha, meaning that the values
simulated for three years later were 15–17% higher. We
interpreted this close correspondence as indicating
accurate performance by Climate-FVS during the initial
modeling period.
How do climate change effects alter forecasts of future
forest condition?
Different models and scenarios of climate change had
enormous impacts on simulated forest structure over the
next century, ranging from recovery to a highly dense
forest condition to complete elimination of the forest
(Table 3, Fig. 3). There were no notable differences in
simulation outcomes using the Regen-1 or Regen-2
scenarios (,2 m2/ha difference in ﬁnal basal area), so
only results using Regen-2 are shown. The most
pronounced differences were observed between emis-
sions scenarios, with all three GCM-scenario combina-
tions that included scenario A2, the sociopolitical
scenario of no reduction in greenhouse gas emissions,
leading to complete or near elimination of ponderosa
pine and Gambel oak as early as 50 years from now
(Fig. 3). Under the A2 scenario, total basal area in 2111
was zero in 50% of the simulations and did not exceed
5 m2/ha in the remainder (Table 3). In contrast, GCM-
scenario combinations that included some level of future
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions resulted in
moderate to high levels of forest density and basal area
at the end of the simulation period (Table 3, Fig. 3).
Total live aboveground carbon was proportional to
basal area, ranging from 0–8.5 Mg/ha under the A2
emissions scenarios (severe climate change) to a maxi-
mum of 59.3 Mg/ha under the no climate change
(NCC)/no treatment (NT) condition (Table 3).
Species responded to climate change in an individu-
alistic manner (Fig. 3). Ponderosa pine, the dominant
species prior to the Rodeo-Chediski ﬁre, always had the
highest simulated basal area after 100 years under the
NCC condition. In contrast, all three of the other species
had higher ﬁnal simulated basal area than NCC under at
least two of the GCM-scenario combinations that did
not include scenario A2.
Pre-Rodeo-Chediski ﬁre treatments had persistent
effects in the scenarios that did not lead to forest
elimination (A1B, B1, and B2). Ponderosa pine domi-
nated in treated stands but Gambel oak was dominant in
untreated stands after 100 years. Alligator juniper and

SIMULATING FUTURE FOREST TRAJECTORIES

New Mexico locust had a much higher absolute basal
area and greater proportion of the total basal area in
untreated stands. Since the dominance of ponderosa
pine was reduced in all the GCM-scenario combinations
except NCC, every level of climate change ampliﬁed the
effect of treatment on future forest composition: pine
dominance after 100 years was most likely under no to
moderate climate change and when the forest had been
treated prior to the Rodeo-Chediski; otherwise Gambel
oak and the other species dominated.
How will future management interact with climate
change?
Future forests were affected substantially by GCM-
scenario combinations, alternative management regimes,
and the persistent inﬂuence of pre-Rodeo-Chediski

treatments. For simplicity, Fig. 4 does not show all the
simulation outcomes (192 total combinations) but rather
summarizes the results into three groups: NCC (left
columns), moderate climate change under the B1
emissions scenarios (middle columns), and severe
climate change under the A2 emissions scenarios (right
columns). See Appendix C for all simulations. Under
GCM-emissions scenarios of severe climate change (A2
emissions scenario), the forest was essentially eliminated
irrespective of management actions, just as in the
preceding analysis. In the absence of ﬁre, shown in the
NT and Thin40 management regimes in Fig. 4, a small
basal area of conifers (,5 m2/ha) remained after 100
years. Under the ﬁre treatments, all tree species were
eliminated by 90 years of simulation.
In contrast, under the moderate climate scenarios,
simulated basal areas after 100 years were quite similar
to the NCC condition (Fig. 4), with reductions in basal
area at the end of 100 years of only 2.2–6.4 m2/ha
compared to the NCC basal area. Under the GCM-
emissions scenarios where forests persisted (i.e., every-
thing except the A2 emissions scenario), the biggest
differences among simulation outcomes were due to
different management regimes. In the no treatment (NT)
condition, forest basal area increased throughout the
simulation period to high levels, 25.3–37.1 m2/ha by
2111. The thinning treatments, Thin 40 and 60 had
similar results with a range of basal area in 2111 of 26–
38.6 m2/ha. In contrast, the management regimes that
included burning maintained low basal areas. The 5-year
burning cycle (Burn 5) led to the lowest values (3.2–
6.3 m2/ha), while Burn 10 resulted in 5.6–10.9 m2/ha and
Burn 20 had the highest values (10.2–14.6 m2/ha).
Species composition also differed strikingly. Ponderosa

pine dominated under the burning regimes, representing
99%, 97%, and 82% of total basal area under prescribed
burning every 5, 10, and 20 years respectively, but
ponderosa represented just 14% of the total basal area
under the thinning regimes. Gambel oak was the
dominant species in terms of basal area in several of
the no-ﬁre conditions (Fig. 3).
The effects of the pre-Rodeo-Chediski treatments
were less notable than the differences created by GCM-
emissions scenarios or management regimes in the non-
A2 emissions scenarios, but there were persistent
differences in forest structure and species composition
(Fig. 4). Basal areas were consistently much lower in
untreated vs. treated stands under burning regimes,
averaging 58% less after 100 years. In contrast, the
management regimes without ﬁre had similar total basal
areas in untreated vs. treated stands after 100 years but
different species compositions. Ponderosa pine made up
an average of 21% of total basal area in untreated stands
vs. 44% in treated stands.
DISCUSSION
How do climate change effects alter forecasts of future
forest condition?
The incorporation of climate change scenarios dra-
matically altered the conditions forecast 100 years in the
future, as compared to the previous predictions present-
ed by Strom and Fule´ (2007) using the same study sites
but the climate-invariant original version of FVS (Strom
and Fule´ 2007). The difference in predictions was not
due to unexpected changes on the ground or unusual
model behavior; forest conditions in 2011 were consis-
tent with the short-term forecasts of the original study
(Table 2, Fig. 2) and the ﬁrst decade of Climate-FVS
simulation corresponded closely with ﬁeld measure-
ments. Instead, the effects of climate change on tree
mortality, growth, viability, and competitiveness as
simulated through the Climate-FVS model led to
complete or nearly complete elimination of the forest
in cases of severe climate change (A2 emissions
scenarios) and notable changes in structure, carbon,
and composition in cases of moderate climate change.
The historical structural characteristics of southwest-
ern forests have been widely used as a reference
condition for ecological restoration and fuel reduction
(Allen et al. 2002), so it would be logical to compare
them to the outcomes of different simulations. Quanti-
tative data from historical forest inventories and
paleoecological reconstruction studies of forests across
the southern Colorado Plateau were summarized by
Stoddard (2011). Taking the 25th and 75th percentiles of
historical forest conditions (BA, 9–15 m2/ha; density,
59–142 trees/ha) as a rough guide to the range of
historical means, none of the 16 simulations fell within
this range. All simulations using the A2 emissions
scenarios had basal areas and tree densities well below
the minimum values, approaching or reaching a non-
forested condition, while the other scenarios were much
higher than the maximum values (Table 3). At the low
end of the range, the forest will have changed to another
vegetation type, probably dominated by shrubs and
sprouting juniper and herbaceous species, with much
lower biomass and carbon stock. The ‘‘hyperdense’’
forests (sensu Savage and Mast 2005) at the high end of
the range would be highly susceptible to severe wildﬁre
(Fule´ et al. 2012), so they would be unlikely to be
sustainable over the long term.
The results from Climate-FVS modeling on the
Rodeo-Chediski were consistent with the ﬁndings of
Crookston et al. (2010), who found a similar range of
forest declines using the same set of GCM-emissions
scenarios in a mixed conifer forest in Idaho, a spruce
(Picea)–ﬁr (Abies) forest in Colorado and a Douglas-ﬁr
(Pseudotsuga menziesii)–western hemlock (Tsuga heter-
ophylla) forest in Washington. In both studies, species-
speciﬁc responses led to changes in simulated forest
composition. Crookston et al. (2010) found that some
GCM-emissions scenarios led to basal area declines but
others led to increased growth for seven conifer and one
broadleaved species. For four species, the NCC condi-
tion always resulted in the highest ﬁnal basal area,
meaning that any amount of climate change reduced
growth. For three other species, however, GCM-
emissions scenarios other than NCC led to the highest
ﬁnal basal area, with 10–20% greater growth (Crook-
ston et al. 2010). Our analysis showed species differences
over a greater range: only one species (ponderosa pine)
grew best under NCC, and the maximum increase in
ﬁnal basal area attributable to a GCM-emissions
scenario was 23% (Gambel oak; Fig. 3). Unlike our
study, Crookston et al. (2010) did not ﬁnd a consistent
relationship between a speciﬁc emissions scenario and
forest elimination; their three geographically dispersed
study areas differed in which scenario resulted in the
greatest decline. The fact that our study site is close to
the southern edge of the range of the dominant species,
ponderosa pine, is probably the biggest factor explaining
the difference. The projected changes in suitable habitat
under climate change for most species shift consistently
northward (Rehfeldt et al. 2006), resulting in reduced
species viability scores for our Arizona site compared to
those of Crookston et al. (2010). In both Crookston’s
and our studies, however, despite the fact that some
individual species performed better under climate
change, every single climate change simulation led to
an overall reduction in forest basal area and carbon
compared to NCC and both studies had at least one
scenario that resulted in forest elimination.
Setting the Climate-FVS approach in a broader
context, there are a number of different modeling
strategies attempting to forecast future forest attributes
under changing climate and disturbance regimes. Seidl et
al. (2011) reviewed a full range of models from
individual-tree to global scales for ﬁve major distur-
bance factors including ﬁre. They made the primary
differentiation between statistical vs. process models,
ALICIA AZPELETA TARANCO´ N ET AL.

while recognizing that these concepts represent a
continuum rather than binary poles. In the case of
process models, dynamic models that actively incorpo-
rated simulated disturbance effects into the subsequent
processes were preferred. However, Seidl et al. (2011)
noted that statistical models still made up the majority
of simulation studies because of the greater ﬂexibility
and precision of many statistical models, compared with
high data demands and insufﬁcient understanding for
simulating many processes.
A review by Keane et al. (2004), more narrowly
focused on ﬁre models, drew similar conclusions. Recent
work by Feddema et al. (2013) provides an example of
detailed modeling of physiological and environmental
interactions in ponderosa pine following severe wildﬁre,
aimed at predicting post-wildﬁre pine regeneration.
Ultimately such research could feed into dynamic,
scalable models that integrate from trees to forests to
the globe (Krawchuk et al. 2009). Recognizing the
urgency of management choices related to ﬁre (Driscoll
et al. 2010) as well as the fact that the uncertainty related
to atmospheric modeling at global and regional scales is
at least as important as the forest and ﬁre modeling
uncertainty (Fernandes 2013), Seidl et al. (2011) argued
that practical models such as FVS were useful to provide
a range of projections to assist management decisions
and in generating hypotheses for new research.
How will future management interact with climate
change?
Management regimes were indispensable for obtain-
ing a sustainable forest condition after 100 years. In the
absence of management, all seven GCM-emissions
scenarios and NCC led to either forest elimination or
excessively dense conditions. In contrast, the three
burning management regimes each had at least one
simulation that led to forest conditions remaining within
the historical range after 100 years, and several
additional simulations that were fairly close (Fig. 4).
As before, the A2 emissions scenario led to forest
elimination, but otherwise burning at frequencies
ranging from 5–20 years maintained a high proportion
of ponderosa pine and kept forest densities from
returning to hyperdense levels.
Simulated management actions under alternative
climate scenarios was carried out elsewhere in Arizona
by Diggins et al. (2010), who also found that repeated
burning maintained sustainable forest structures even
under climate change. Diggins et al. (2010) used the
FFE-FVS model but carried out the climate analysis by
modifying two FVS keywords, a basal area increment
multiplier and an addition to the predicted mortality, to
reﬂect the effects of ‘‘low’’ and ‘‘high’’ levels of climate
change to test burning at 5-, 10-, and 20-year intervals.
The optimal future ﬁre management regime varied with
the level of climate change: burning at 10-year intervals,
close to the historical disturbance regime frequency,
maintained the forest best under NCC and low climate
change conditions, but the 20-year intervals were
preferred under high climate change because forest
decline was exacerbated by the extra tree mortality
associated with more frequent ﬁres (Diggins et al. 2010).
In contrast to burning, the thinning management
regimes tested here and by Diggins et al. (2010) were not
effective for long-term conservation. Pine basal area was
reduced by the initial thinning but the forest structure
shifted to dominance by small oaks and junipers,
creating a dense forest with many fuel ladders. If
thinning guidelines were changed from their present
emphasis on pines to include all species, then thinning
could potentially play a more useful role. Both Gambel
oak and alligator juniper are effective resprouters
(Barton 1999). The frequent burning regimes (5–
20 years) kept the densities of these ﬁre-susceptible
species low, but mechanical thinning at such frequent
intervals would probably be prohibitively expensive and
raise other environmental concerns, such as the need to
maintain a dense road network for access.
Modeling exercises that do not incorporate climate
change or other signiﬁcant disturbances give incomplete
results. A previous study on these sites showed that pre-
Rodeo-Chediski fuel treatments were projected by FVS
to have persistent effects a century later, but both
treated and untreated stands were projected to become
dense forests or shrublands (Strom and Fule´ 2007).
Reassessing the study area with Climate-FVS, the
outcomes covered a much broader range, all the way
to forest elimination. Notably, every single climate
change scenario resulted in lower basal area and carbon
stock than NCC. At a minimum, this suggests that
studies using models without incorporating climate
change are likely to overestimate, perhaps drastically,
the forest structure and carbon pools at the end of the
simulation period. Previous modeling studies such as
Strom and Fule´ (2007), analysis of future carbon stock
and emissions (Hurteau et al. 2011, Colombo et al.
2012), or future wildﬁre hazard (Johnson et al. 2011),
should be assessed critically in light of the range of
potential effects of climate change.
Managers should incorporate climate change into the
process of analyzing the environmental effects of
alternative actions. FVS is routinely used to support
forest management decisions by the government agen-
cies in the United States responsible for managing the
largest forests in the nation. Logistical support and
training, which already include resources supporting
Climate-FVS, are provided to managers. It would not be
difﬁcult to switch to Climate-FVS or future climate-
explicit simulators to provide a more thorough analysis.
Moving beyond the U.S. case, similar forest conditions,
wildﬁre hazards, and climate change effects occur in
many regions of the world (Koutsias et al. 2012, San-
Miguel-Ayanz et al. 2013). While regional differences
may be important, it is likely true that forest ecosystems
will display important differences under different
climate scenarios. Modeling exercises should incorpo-

rate alternative future scenarios and forest managers
should seek to develop conservative management
strategies that best preserve future options. Adaptive
management, in which management actions are moni-
tored and ﬁndings are used to reﬁne future actions,
becomes even more important as climate changes in
uncertain ways. At present, a wide range of GCM-
emissions scenarios may be equally likely, but 10 or 20
years into the future the actual pattern of change should
become increasingly clear, allowing managers to make
better choices between attempting to conserve native
ecosystems or facilitate their transition to better-adapted
communities.
