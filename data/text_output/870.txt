and Assessing Spatial Reference Conditions
of Ponderosa Pine Forests in Northern Arizona

Abstract
Multiscale spatial patterns of forest reference conditions
offer insight on how historical and environmental processes
have inﬂuenced forest stand dynamics. Yet, spatial infor-
mation is often either unavailable or partial, because many
studies provide nonspatial reference condition information,
whereas others only report the local (i.e. observed at plot
extent) spatial arrangement of trees. However, knowledge
of multiscaled spatial patterns, including stand-, among-
patch-, and within-patch-level patterns, is needed to ensure
that forest management strategies suit a wide range of
objectives in ecosystem restoration. In this study, we pro-
pose a new framework for delineating tree patches based
on common stand attributes. We found that patch refer-
ence conditions for presettlement ponderosa pine in north-
ern Arizona ranged from 10 to 27 patches/ha, accounted
for 62–75% of the total historic stand basal area (m2/ha)
and varied in size from 0.01 to 0.15 ha. Lastly, discussion
was made on the importance of using a patch-delineation
framework, such as the one proposed in this study, as a
basis for quantifying stand- and patch-level patterns of
reconstructed presettlement and current forest conditions
and how this information should guide spatially explicit
restoration management (e.g. thinning prescriptions).

Introduction
Vegetation spatial pattern is determined by a complex combi-
nation of mechanisms including initial conditions, disturbance
history (i.e. harvesting, livestock grazing, ﬁre exclusion, nat-
ural, or prescribed ﬁres), species life history (e.g. seed dis-
persal), and the underlying heterogeneity inherent to the envi-
ronment (Law et al. 1993). Either natural or anthropogenic in
origin, these processes inﬂuence change in the structure of
forest communities through time and space (Oliver & Larson
1996), often obscuring prior patterns. Whereas it is not possi-
ble to indisputably determine that the observed spatial pattern
of vegetation has resulted from a speciﬁc process (Pielou 1961,
1974), quantitative descriptions of spatial patterns offer insight
into the scale at which historical and environmental mech-
anisms inﬂuence forest stand dynamics (Youngblood et al.
2004; Boyden et al. 2005; Fortin & Dale 2005). Numerous
studies have examined the importance of spatial patterns in
a wide variety of ecosystems (Watt 1947; Greig-Smith 1952;

et al. 2009).
The importance of understanding the spatial patterns of ref-
erence conditions and their inﬂuence on stand dynamics is of
particular interest throughout the frequent-ﬁre conifer forests
of the western United States. Throughout these systems, pre-
settlement and remnant old-growth stands often exhibit an
aggregated tree distribution (Harrod et al. 1999) in uneven-
aged patches, except for the random tree arrangement found
in a few ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws. var. scop-
ulorum) stands in Oregon, United States (Youngblood et al.
2004). Canopy openings alternating with tree patches are
thought to typify within-forest patterns in many frequent-ﬁre
conifer forests (Abella et al. 2007). Furthermore, this is par-
ticularly true for the southwestern ponderosa pine ecosystem
of the United States where grass openings account for the
highest level of plant diversity (Laughlin et al. 2006) and spa-
tial patterns have been shown to inﬂuence genetic diversity
(DeWald 2003), growth of large trees (Biondi 1996; Ffolliott
et al. 2000), forest dynamics (Youngblood et al. 2004; Boy-
den et al. 2005; S´anchez Meador et al. 2009), wildlife habitat
(Graham et al. 1994; Ffolliott et al. 1977; Meyer & Sisk 2001;
Waltz & Covington 2003; Dodd et al. 2006; Wightman & Ger-
maine 2006), and risk of catastrophic, stand-replacing crown
ﬁres (Ful´e et al. 2007).

A New Method for Delineating Tree Patches
Knowledge of these spatial patterns, combined with non-
spatial quantitative assessment of stand structure and reference
conditions, can help to guide the development of silvicultural
practices and forest management strategies to suit the wide
range of objectives applied in ecosystem restoration. Further-
more, it is widely accepted that restoring spatial pattern to its
previous condition is vital to the resiliency of most frequent-
ﬁre ecosystems (Finney 2001). For example, the increase
in tree density over the past century in the western United
States has occurred at the expense of spatial heterogeneity and
resulted in widespread eradication of canopy openings (Bon-
nicksen & Stone 1982; Zier & Baker 2006). Yet, to date, the
majority of presettlement stand structural descriptions used as
targeted conditions have been derived solely from stand-level
collective attributes such as tree density, basal area, canopy
cover, and mean tree size.
The objectives for this project were (1) to summarize the
spatial distribution of trees (i.e. whether the pattern was
random, aggregated, or uniform) in presettlement ponderosa
pine forests of northern Arizona, to expand reference condition
information presented in S´anchez Meador et al. (in press);
(2) to develop a framework that could be used to delineate
tree patches based on common stand attributes; (3) to compare
stand-, among-patch-, and within-patch-level patterns derived
using this new method to those reported in the literature and
commonly cited as spatial reference conditions in southwestern
ponderosa pine.
Methods
Project History and Study Sites
For this study, we utilized a subset of the network of 50
permanent plots established between 1909 and 1913 on the
National Forests of Arizona and New Mexico (U.S. Forest
Service [USFS] Southwestern Region; now USFS Region 3)
known as the “Woolsey plots” (Moore et al. 2004; Bell et al.
2008; S´anchez Meador et al. in press). The subset examined
in this study was composed of six permanent plots on the
Coconino National Forest near Flagstaff, Arizona. These plots
were reconstructed to presettlement conditions (1873–1874)
by S´anchez Meador et al. (in press), who, in brief, used his-
toric stem-maps and dendrochronological reconstructions to
determine that structural reference conditions for southwest-
ern ponderosa pine in northern Arizona exhibited irregular
uneven-aged size distributions. These reference conditions
were derived from two sampled plots of similar stand structure
at each of three sites located 10 km northwest (plots denoted
as S1A and S1B), 15 km northeast (S4A and S4B), and 21 km
south (S5B2 and S5B3) of Flagstaff (see S´anchez Meador
et al. in press for location map). The plots range in size from
1.21 to 4.05 ha, are located at elevations between 2,050 and
2,250 m, and are composed of vegetation/soils units represent-
ing roughly 12% of the vegetation types found in the Coconino
National forest (Miller et al. 1995). Those plots were com-
posed almost exclusively of ponderosa pine and varied from
pure ponderosa pine (S1A and S1B) to mostly ponderosa pine
with very little Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt.; found
on S5B2 and S5B3). We only examined the spatial pattern of
ponderosa pine.
Historical and contemporary ﬁeld methods, as well as
contemporary conditions, are detailed by S´anchez Meador
et al. (in press) and Moore et al. (2004), who report forest
structural reference conditions (size distributions, tree density
ranges, etc.) on these same plots. We measured all live and
dead tree structures including stumps, snags, and windfallen
trees that grew to at least breast height (1.37 m) on each
plot at its original extent (1.21–4.05 ha). We located all tree
structures using historical stem-maps and measured spatial
coordinates to the nearest 0.1 m and 0.1◦using the Impulse
400 laser rangeﬁnder and MapStar compass system (Laser
Technology Inc., U.S.A.)
Stand-Level Patterns
To determine whether the spatial distribution of trees was
random (also called complete spatial randomness [CSR]),
aggregated, or uniform, we used point pattern analysis (Upton
& Fingleton 1985). Speciﬁcally, we used the Ripley’s K(t)
function (Ripley 1976, 1977) with a square-root, variance-
stabilizing transformation of K(t) to L(t) −t (Besag 1977).
L(t) −t values larger than, equal to, and smaller than 0
indicate aggregated, random, and uniform spatial distributions,
respectively. We also used a Monte Carlo simulation approach
to test for signiﬁcance (Upton & Fingleton 1985; Dale 1999)
by comparing the resulting L(t) −t values with a frequency
distribution from 99 simulated random point patterns. Ripley’s
K(t) analyses were implemented in R v.2.2.0 using the splancs
package (Rowlingson & Diggle 1993; Bivand & Gebhardt
2000).
Patch-Level Patterns
In cases where the reconstructed stand-level spatial patterns
were aggregated, we further described the stand in terms of
patch density, proportion of trees in patches, and the patches
themselves including size, tree density, and basal area. We
estimated patch size ﬁrst by estimating the value of L(t) −t
at the point of maximum divergence from CSR (Boyden et al.
2005). To describe among- and within-patch attributes, as
well as facilitate comparisons between plots, we proposed
a new method for designating and delineating patches. This
framework consists of two steps: (1) establishing a minimum
number of trees per patch (i.e. clearly deﬁning a patch);
(2) selecting an among-tree limiting-distance criterion based
on a sensitivity analysis of the delineated patches resulting
from a range of limiting distances.
To develop our methodology, we considered the following
issues. First, as there is no evidence suggesting that two
trees function as less of a patch than three trees, we chose
to use Lang’s (1994) deﬁnition of two or more trees to
deﬁne a patch. Next, we selected a starting distance-based
membership criterion or “between-tree limiting distance” and
assessed the sensitivity of our selection using the following

491

A New Method for Delineating Tree Patches
steps: starting with a map containing the positions of all
trees, each tree is deﬁned as a patch composed of a single
individual. Next, we examined circular windows determined
by a range of radius r centered on each tree across the
stand. The use of these windows is rooted in the concept
that crown interconnectivity is an important patch attribute,
and that these windows approximate the limit of an individual
tree’s area of inﬂuence (White 1985; Lang 1994). Thus, we
interpreted any degree of overlap between two or more trees as
evidence of interactions at that scale. At this point, we merged
interacting trees into discrete patches (composed of two or
more trees) and calculated the proportion of trees in patches.
Speciﬁcally, we repeated this process for progressively larger
radii (r = 1–12 m) until the entire stand was included into one
patch. We selected the between-tree limiting distance based
on the sensitivity analysis aimed at maximizing trade-offs of
scale. For example, in forested systems where “patchiness”
is deemed desirable, between-tree limiting distances resulting
in one large patch or patch densities essentially equal to
tree densities are impractical and provide managers with little
additional understanding. This issue was facilitated by using
a between-tree limiting distance based on the relationship
between tree diameter and projected crown area, which results
in among- and within-patch characteristics varying based on
structural conditions (e.g. patch density will decrease and patch
size will increase with increasing tree densities).
Lastly, to examine historic crown interconnectivity and
patch area for the reconstructed stand conditions, we predicted
crown radii as a function of reconstructed diameter at breast
heights (dbhs) (1873–1874; S´anchez Meador et al. in press)
using a regression built on data from 5,075 ponderosa pine
trees collected from 18 permanent plots on the Coconino
National Forest. The relationship between crown radius and
tree dbh is known to be strong (Hitchcock 1974; Hemery
et al. 2005), which we modeled for ponderosa pine using the
contemporary average of two measurements of crown radius
(taken from the center of the tree stem to the perimeter of the
crown along the longest and shortest radii of the crown form)
and tree dbh.
We then combined patches, which were delineated using
the selected between-tree limiting distance, with projections
of canopy area derived from reconstructed stand conditions
and compared these estimates to those presented in the
literature. Using all patches that fell entirely within the
plots and correcting for edge effects (excluding patches with
tree limiting distances intersecting the plot boundary), we
examined the range of variability for attributes characterizing
among-patch (such as patch size, basal area, and tree density)
and within-patch (such as tree size and nearest neighbor
distance) structures.
Results
Stand-Level Patterns
As expected, the trees on the reconstructed plots (as they would
appear in 1873–1874) were signiﬁcantly aggregated on all
sites (Fig. 1). Trees were most strongly aggregated on S1B
(most deviation from CSR) and least aggregated on S5B3.
Although trees on all sites were aggregated up to at least 36 m,
scales of signiﬁcant aggregation varied up to an extent larger
than the plot extent for sites S1B, S4A, and S5B3. All sites
exhibited single distinct peaks in aggregation except S5B3 and
S1B, which appeared to ﬂuctuate between 5 and 15 m and
exhibited a second peak at around 80 m, respectively.
Patch-Level Patterns
All sites exhibited peaks in aggregation between 6 and 22 m
lag distances (Fig. 1), corresponding to presettlement patches
of trees ranging in size from 0.01 to 0.15 ha. As expected,
sensitivity analysis (Fig. 2) revealed that the proportion of
total trees designated as members of patches was positively
correlated with increasing between-tree limiting distances. All
sites (i.e. two closely located plots with similar reconstructed
structure) were designated as one large patch when the limiting
distance reached 12 m (on average) and an asymptote was
reached at around 6 m, which corresponded to the maximum
crown radius observed in the contemporary data.
The resulting equation and ﬁt statistics quantifying the
strong positive relationship between crown radius and dbh are
presented in Figure 3. A power function provided the best ﬁt
as judged by the distribution of residuals and a high coefﬁcient
of determination (r2 = 0.83). We ultimately used the resulting
predicted crown radii to delineate the area of inﬂuence for
all reconstructed individual trees. Furthermore, we selected
the third quartile crown radius for use as the individual tree
limiting distance because it most closely met the criteria listed
in the methods section.
Corresponding between-tree limiting distances (sum of the
two trees’ crown radii) ranged between 5.3 and 6.6 m and
produced as few as 10 and as many as 27 patches/ha (S1B
and S5B3, respectively). The resulting range of variability
for among-patch and within-patch attributes is presented in
Table 1. Trees in patches exhibited less variability in dbh
(Table 1). The average size of trees on each of the sites ranged
from 32.2 to 44.4 cm for trees in patches, and 39.5–58.4 cm
for trees outside of patches. By deﬁnition, the mean distance
to the nearest neighboring tree was lower between trees in
patches than those not members of patches. For example,
stem-maps illustrating patches that fell entirely within the plots
S1B and S5B3 are shown in Figures 4a and 5a, in addition to
their corresponding tree density and size variability (Figs. 4b
and 5b, respectively). Patches composed of two to three trees
exhibited highly variable tree dbh distributions (e.g. Fig. 4,
patches 5 and 6). For patches of more than three trees, there
appeared to be a decreasing trend in median tree size and
overall variability as number of trees increased (e.g. Fig. 4b,
patches 27 through 37).
The majority of individual trees on the study area were
members of patches (75–84% of the total trees/ha), and these
trees accounted for 62–75% of the total basal area (m2/ha).
The resulting average densities ranged from 3.6 to 5.4 trees per
patch, the largest being composed of 24 trees (Table 1; S4A).

Discussion
Stand-Level Patterns
Point pattern analysis indicated that an aggregated spatial
pattern best described the arrangement of trees across all
sites at short distances (≤36 m). These results agree with the
common interpretation of southwestern ponderosa pine stand
development as consisting of episodic tree establishment in
uneven-aged patches (Bailey & Covington 2002). Spatial anal-
ysis revealed that two sites (S1B and S5B3) were aggregated
at all spatial scales, likely due to their proximity to large grass
expanses, or parks. These parks, which were common prior to
Euro-American settlement, would have further restricted tree
establishment and suggest that larger-scale landscape-type pat-
terns, such as exact location within a larger-scale mosaic, are
an important consideration. We also observed aggregation at
all spatial scales on one of the cinder soil sites (e.g. S4A)
where no parks are noted but ponderosa pine is known to

persist in lower densities (Abella 2008; Dyer et al. 2008) as
compared to other studies on basalt-derived soils (Savage et al.
1996). Furthermore, we speculate that regardless of study site,
spatial aggregation at all scales (≤100 m) is to be expected in
areas with increased seedling mortality, likely resulting from
frost-heaving (Heidmann 1976), periods of extreme drought
(Larson & Schubert 1970), and/or increased competition from
herbaceous plants for important resources such as soil moisture
(Larson & Schubert 1969).
Presettlement and remnant old-growth stands frequently
exhibit aggregated tree patterns (White 1985; Lang 1994;
Youngblood et al. 2004; Boyden et al. 2005), suggesting that
ponderosa pine established in small patches. Whereas the ﬁnd-
ings reported by Cooper (1961) represent neither presettlement
nor old-growth conditions, our range of 0.01–0.15 ha patch
sizes is remarkably similar to those (0.06–0.14 ha patch sizes)
Cooper reported for 26–80-year-old stands of even-sized pon-
derosa pine in the White Mountains of Arizona (Fort Apache
Reservation; near McNary, Arizona).
More importantly, our patch sizes derived from point pattern
analysis and the patch-delineation framework are consistent
with numerous studies conducted in presettlement and remnant
old-growth ponderosa pine stands. Speciﬁcally, the range of
patch sizes reported in this study overlaps the 0.02–0.29 ha
range reported by White (1985) and the 0.03–0.38 ha range
reported by Boyden et al. (2005) for patch sizes on the G. A.
Pearson Natural Area (GPNA) near Flagstaff, Arizona, and the
Manitou Experimental Forest, northwest of Colorado Springs,
Colorado, respectively. Our range of patch sizes is only
slightly narrower than the 0.005–0.2 ha range reconstructed
by Harrod et al. (1999) on the Wenatchee National Forest,
near Wenatchee, Washington; but smaller and more variable
than the 0.15–0.18 ha range reported by Youngblood et al.
(2004) on the Metolius Research Natural Area and Pringle
Butte Research Natural Area in central Oregon and Blacks
Mountain Experimental Forest of northern California. Lastly,
the average patch size (0.002 ha) reported by Lang (1994) for
“old-growth” ponderosa pine-Gambel oak sites in the White
Mountains of east-central Arizona was almost an order of
magnitude smaller than any minimum patch size reported by
any other study of old-growth forests, including those reported
by Harrod et al. (1999).
These multiple lines of evidence in the form of spatial ref-
erence conditions, in conjunction with the reconstructed struc-
tural data from S´anchez Meador et al. (in press), frequency
of individual-tree mortality events shown on the historical
stem-maps, and the documented uneven-age distributions of
numerous nearby studies (e.g. White 1985; Ful´e et al. 1997;
Mast et al. 1999) as well as other studies conducted on these
same sites (Huffman et al. 2000; Moore et al. 2004; S´anchez
Meador et al. 2009), support the notion that presettlement
southwestern ponderosa pine forests near Flagstaff, Arizona
were historically composed of a mosaic of small, uneven-aged
patches.

illustrating reconstructed diameter distribution for live trees in patches

Patch-Level Patterns
Sensitivity analysis revealed that the proportion of trees
designated as members of patches was highly sensitive to the
between-tree limiting distance over short distances (≤6 m).
Even though the number of patches varied with spatial scale,
the proportion of total trees and associated basal area in patches
varied little, suggesting that some stand-level attributes are
not sensitive to the patch designation. Sensitivity analysis also
aided in the selection of crown radius as the tree limiting
distance, which proved to be an efﬁcient means to place trees
into distinct patches.
Within-patch size data were highly variable and had wide-
ranging tree sizes, contrary to Cooper’s even-aged (and
therefore size) hypothesis for ponderosa pine of the White
Mountains. Although dbh is known to be a poor surrogate
for age in southwestern ponderosa pine, variability in the
reconstructed data and the historical stem-maps does not
support the presence of even-sized trees within patches nor
does it show any events of entire patch mortality (i.e. dead

structures mapped on original stem-maps were predominantly
isolated and did not occur in patches).
Another possible explanation for the high degree of among-
and within-patch variability is the lack of adequate regener-
ation sites as suggested by White (1985). Similar to White’s
ﬁnding that 22% of the GPNA was historically occupied by
presettlement trees (≥9.14 cm dbh), our study shows that
11–19% of our reconstructed study area was historically occu-
pied by trees of a similar designation, suggesting that low
frequency of safe sites might have been a limiting factor
for regeneration events. However, the premise regarding lack
of safe sites would still not explain how single and paired
trees came to occupy the interspaces between patches, as evi-
denced by the reconstructed conditions. Further investigation
is needed to assess whether these single and/or paired trees
represent the beginning of a new patch, the lone survivors of
a previous patch, or another tree (seedling) establishment pro-
cess. Although numerous snags and logs were reconstructed as
being present prior to Euro-American settlement (average of
5 ha−1; S´anchez Meador et al. in press), the majority of snags
and logs seemed to occur in close vicinity of existing patches
or as isolated structures.

does not dominate (e.g. S4A). Likewise, Lang’s method may
be impractical for management objectives and ﬁeld opera-
tions, because it results in extremely high patch densities.
On the other hand, our selected between-tree limiting distance
produced relevant practical results by its ability to accommo-
date subtle differences between sites (e.g. the value selected
is allowed to vary in stands with varying densities). For
example, smaller dbh and closer neighbors will character-
ize sites with high tree densities. Therefore, the correspond-
ing selected between-tree limiting distance should be smaller,
which would in turn allow detecting and quantifying subtle dif-
ferences for among- and within-patch attributes. This method
is also broadly applicable beyond ponderosa pine forests and
customizable by practitioners, who could modify the patch-
designation criterion by selecting other data characteristics
(such as other quartiles, other measures of central tendency,
etc.) wherever aggregated spatial patterns dominate.
Management Implications
Once the between-tree limiting distance (based on canopy con-
tinuity) has been selected, the proposed method is expected
to provide useful and straightforward approach for practition-
ers to assess presettlement or other reference stand conditions,
current conditions to determine the need for restoration, aggre-
gation in shrub and woodland ecosystems, or the success of
alternative restoration prescriptions at restoring spatial pat-
terns.
Using that information to quantify the spatial heterogene-
ity of presettlement forest structure could provide guidance for
setting restoration targets. However, this study likely only cov-
ered a portion of the natural historical range of patch sizes and
densities that occurred in presettlement times as a function of
ecological and local disturbance characteristics. Laughlin et al.
(2006) found that herbaceous standing crop targets (in biomass
per area) were not met after restoration treatments under
tree patches and suggested the need for increased patch type
heterogeneity, including the creation of openings. Similarly,
restoration treatments targeting spatial patterns in the form of
a shifting patchwork of tree patches within a relatively open
matrix have been recommended to achieve improved inverte-
brate habitat and increased microclimate heterogeneity (Meyer
& Sisk 2001). Current restoration (thinning) prescriptions,
such as those outlined by Mast (2003), focus on the preser-
vation of all presettlement trees and often indirectly advocate
the retention of the largest postsettlement trees by selecting the
largest “leave-trees” within a certain distance of presettlement
evidence (presettlement aged snags, logs, stumps, stump holes,
etc.). The retention of these large postsettlement trees, which
commonly established ﬁrst in the overgrazed grass interspaces
(S´anchez Meador et al. 2009), may likely result in tree spatial
patterns very different from those presented in this study, sug-
gesting the importance of considering tree locations, as well
as size or age, when marking restoration prescriptions.
The management of highly altered ecosystems is a major
challenge for land managers. This is particularly true in the
southwestern ponderosa pine forests of northern Arizona,
which have changed drastically since presettlement times. The
method proposed in this study allows for the spatial analysis of
stand- and patch-level patterns of not only reconstructed pre-
settlement but also current conditions. Ultimately, information
generated by this approach may serve to compare both con-
ditions and establish guidelines to achieve forest management
and restoration objectives that incorporate spatial structure.
Implications for Practice
• Reconstructed reference and current spatial patterns, as
well as stand- and patch-level forest structure, should
be quantiﬁed by using a patch-delineation framework
similar to the one proposed in this study as a basis for
implementing and assessing the outcomes of spatially
explicit restoration management (e.g. thinning prescrip-
tions).
• Multiple lines of forest structural/spatial evidence sug-
gest that frequent-ﬁre conifer forest structure in the
southwest was typiﬁed as “patchy” and targeted future
conditions ignoring spatial pattern may be unsuccessful.
• Practitioners should consider silvicultural treatments that
promote presettlement “reference” spatial patterns that
are consistent with the historical evidence, keeping in
mind that the differences in patch size and density
attributed to soils, topography, moisture, site history, and
genetics are relatively unknown but possibly inﬂuential.
• Frameworks quantifying spatial pattern such as the one
presented in this study can be used for a variety of pur-
poses, including quantifying reference and current con-
ditions to determine the need for restoration, assessing
wildlife habitat, or evaluating the effects of alternative
treatments on spatial patterns.
