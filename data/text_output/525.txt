Invasions by exotic plant species can threaten forest ecosystems in numerous ways. Theories on relation-
ships of exotic species invasions with native vegetation, resource availability, and disturbance could
assist in managing exotic plants by identifying parts of the landscape and ecological conditions most sus-
ceptible to invasion. However, generality of these theories is complicated by considerable variation
among landscapes and ecology of individual species. We assessed hypotheses on relationships of exotic
plant communities with native vegetation, environmental (soil, topographic, and climate), and distur-
bance (roads and grazing) variables using data from 66 plots within a 110,000-ha Pinus ponderosa forest
landscape in northern Arizona, USA. We further assessed exotic plant relationships with ecosystem clas-
siﬁcation, which has a long history of use in forest ecology and management but has been underutilized
for understanding exotic species distributions. Plots contained a total of 251 native and 20 exotic plant
species. As hypothesized for distributional studies, native and exotic species were positively correlated,
but the correlation varied with scale for species richness (m2, r = 0.65; 500 m2, r = 0.41) and was weaker
for cover (r = 0.32). Multiple regression, including native vegetation and environmental variables,
accounted for similar amounts of variation in exotic species richness (50% of variation) and cover
(51%). Disturbance variables only entered regression models when native vegetation was excluded from
models. Exotic species richness m2, cover, and community composition were strongly related to the eco-
system classiﬁcation. For example, mean exotic cover ranged from <0.1% in ecosystems with volcanic cin-
der soils to 7% in ecosystems containing Populus tremuloides. As hypothesized, moist ecosystems were
generally most invaded. However, also considering factors such as past management of the ecosystems
and literature on the introduction histories (e.g., intentional seeding for range improvement) of the spe-
cies, we hypothesize that the ecosystem classiﬁcation integrated co-varying environmental, disturbance,
and management variables related to exotic plant communities. Ecosystem classiﬁcation was a useful
framework for understanding distributions of exotic plant communities across the landscape.

1. Introduction
Exotic plant species can impact human–environment forested
systems in numerous ways, such as by replacing high-quality
native forage on rangelands, ‘engineering’ novel ﬁre regimes
through fuel production, reducing indigenous biodiversity, and
interfering with tree regeneration (Chornesky et al., 2005). Recog-
nizing the threat that exotic species pose to indigenous ecosys-
tems, many countries have created legal mandates for managing
exotic species. In 1999, for example, Executive Order 13112 by
the U.S. government established the National Invasive Species
Council which seeks to promote management strategies for exotic
species on U.S. federal lands (Clinton, 1999). As a participating
agency, the U.S. Forest Service (2004) issued guidelines for manag-
ing exotic species on its lands. These guidelines emphasized pre-
vention (limiting invasions from occurring), early detection of
new infestations, strategically managing priority exotic species
and parts of the landscape, and restoration to strengthen indige-
nous ecosystems. Knowledge of the relationships of exotics with
indigenous vegetation and disturbance, and the distribution and
abundance of exotics across landscapes, is fundamental to meeting
these guidelines. Ecological theories provide some general expec-
tations regarding these relationships and distributions, but in
order to make management decisions, further work is needed to
understand reliability of these theories and to relate exotic species

ecology are that native and exotic species richness are positively
correlated at the landscape scale and invasibility increases when
moisture, nutrients, or disturbance increase.
A general postulate from landscape sampling studies is that
native plant species richness and cover are positively correlated
with exotic richness and cover, suggesting that environments
favorable for native species also are favorable for exotic species
(Stohlgren et al., 1999; Gilbert and Lechowicz, 2005; Fornwalt
et al., 2010). These favorable environments often are nutrient-rich
and productive. However, some studies have not reported positive
correlations between native and exotic species (e.g., Vilà et al.,
2007; Hejda et al., 2009) or have found that for richness, results
vary with spatial scale (e.g., Keeley et al., 2003). Moreover, a com-
peting theory predicts that moist, nutrient-rich sites with high pro-
ductivity would have lower species richness because a few
dominant species usurp the resources and competitively exclude
other species (Levine et al., 2004). This could reduce an ecosys-
tem’s invasibility by exotic species.
Invasibility is considered related to resource availability and
disturbance, but the relative strength of relationships of environ-
mental variables and disturbance with exotic species is not fully
understood and can vary among landscapes and exotic species
(Lockwood et al., 2009; Mortensen et al., 2009). The intermediate
disturbance hypothesis predicts that total species richness peaks
at intermediate levels of disturbance (Huston, 1979). Speciﬁcally
for exotic species, however, high disturbance levels may promote
high richness and abundance of exotic species through a variety
of mechanisms, including disturbance effects on native vegetation
(Eschtruth and Battles, 2009). Similar to environmental variables,
the importance of disturbance variables to species invasions
appears to vary among landscapes and species (Fowler et al.,
2008; Eschtruth and Battles, 2009; Fornwalt et al., 2010). This var-
iation complicates efforts to develop general theories and practical
strategies for exotic species mapping and management, underscor-
ing a use for multifactor studies that examine several factors
potentially related to landscape-scale distributions of exotic spe-
cies communities. Data sets including native and exotic plant com-
munity composition, disturbance variables, and environmental
variables (with soil properties) at the landscape scale are rare but
necessary for evaluating reliability of predictions regarding exotic
species community distributions (Bashkin et al., 2003; Keeley
et al., 2003; Gilbert and Lechowicz, 2005).
Ecosystem classiﬁcation could be a valuable tool for integrating
often co-varying factors such as environment and disturbance that
affect exotic species distributions across landscapes, but its poten-
tial has been little explored for this purpose. Also known as ecolog-
ical
land
classiﬁcation,
forest
site
classiﬁcation,
and
other
designations, ecosystem classiﬁcation is based on the concept of
ecosystems as volumetric units that include the atmosphere, topog-
raphy, vegetation, and soil (Barnes et al., 1982; Dolan and Parker,
2005). The landscape is viewed as a mosaic of polygons representing
different ecosystems that can be conceived at different resolutions
by combining or dividing (e.g., moist versus dry ecosystems) ecosys-
tems at different hierarchical levels (Palik et al., 2000). Ecosystem
classiﬁcation could be useful for understanding exotic species inva-
sions across landscapes by integrating environmental factors and
some disturbance regimes, if they are ecosystem-speciﬁc, poten-
tially linked to exotic species distributions. If exotic species abun-
dance and composition differ among ecosystems, ecosystem
classiﬁcation could also facilitate development of ecosystem-spe-
ciﬁc management strategies.
The objectives of this study were to: (1) assess relationships
between native and exotic species richness and cover; (2) evaluate
relationships of environmental, disturbance, and native vegetation
variables with exotic plant community distributions across the
landscape; and (3) compare exotic species richness, cover, and
composition among landscape ecosystems. We anticipated that:
(1) native and exotic richness would be positively correlated at
multiple spatial scales and native and exotic cover also would be
positively correlated; (2) native vegetation, environmental, and
disturbance variables would account for equal proportions of the
variance in distribution of exotic species communities; and (3) dis-
tribution of exotic species communities would correspond to the
distribution of ecosystems across the landscape, with moist, nutri-
ent-rich ecosystems being the most heavily invaded.
2. Methods
2.1. Study area
We conducted this study within a 110,000-ha Pinus ponderosa
forest landscape within the Coconino National Forest and Northern
Arizona University School of Forestry Centennial Forest in northern
Arizona, USA (Fig. 1). Topography is primarily ﬂat to undulating,
dissected by canyons, limestone ridges, and volcanic landforms
such as cinder cones. Six ﬁre-history studies within the study area
have reported ﬁre frequencies of 2–5 years in the centuries preced-
ing 1880 (Van Horne and Fulé, 2006). Following approximately
1880, Euro-American settlement introduced new land-use prac-
tices including livestock grazing (cattle and sheep), timber harvest,
and ﬁre exclusion. Based on a study reconstructing historical tree
density at 53 sites, the 1880 density of ponderosa pine trees varied
across the landscape, ranging from treeless basins several hectares
in size (locally termed ‘parks’) and low-density (<10 trees ha1)
sites (e.g., due to high clay content likely limiting regeneration),
to a site containing 183 trees ha1 (Abella and Denton, 2009). With
few exceptions, such as in some parks, density of ponderosa pine
trees has increased by orders of magnitude since 1880 (Bakker
and Moore, 2007). The landscape was generally historically domi-
nated by graminoids and remains so today, although herbaceous
vegetation has declined overall in many areas concomitant with
the increase in tree density (Covington et al., 1994). Cattle and
sheep are still grazed, but at lower stocking levels than near the
turn of the 20th century and grazing intensity is spatially variable
(Bakker and Moore, 2007).
The study area is covered by a terrestrial ecosystem survey, the
U.S. Forest Service’s ecosystem classiﬁcation and mapping program
for national forests in Arizona and New Mexico (U.S. Forest Service,
1986). The Forest Service mapped ecosystems with a 16-ha mini-
mum mapping unit (U.S. Forest Service, 1986; Miller et al., 1995).
In our study, we included 11 terrestrial ecosystem types predomi-
nant in the study area and encompassing a range of climatic regimes
and soil parent materials. Ecosystems spanned four soil orders, with
major soil great groups including Ustochrepts and Ustorthents on
drier sites and Eutroboralfs and Argiborolls on moister sites (Miller
et al., 1995). Based on similarity in environmental and vegetation
factors determined in a previous study (Abella and Covington,
2006a), we grouped plots on basalt soils from four to three ecosys-
tems for analysis to result in 10 total ecosystems. Ecosystems ran-
ged from xeric, nutrient-poor, black cinder ecosystems containing
little understory vegetation, to moist basalt ecosystems with silt
loam soils and productive understories (Table 1).
2.2. Data collection
Using a geographic information system (GIS), we randomly
selected 6–7 mapping units of each of the terrestrial ecosystem
types for sampling and generated a random point to establish a
66

plot in each mapping unit. The slight variation in the number of
mapping units among ecosystems resulted from rejecting units
for sampling if they had been burned by wildﬁre and did not con-
tain forest cover. Excepting park and aspen ecosystems that had
either continuous open (park) or forest (aspen) cover, we estab-
lished the plot in the nearest opening to the random point in each
unit. Openings were usually located near groups of old trees
(establishing prior to 1880), were ca. 0.1–1 ha in size, and were
readily identiﬁable in the ﬁeld (Larson and Churchill, 2012). We
sampled openings because they contain understory vegetation, as
opposed to dense post-settlement tree patches where understory
vegetation is minimal or absent (Covington et al., 1994). Moreover,
in a previous study we found that the probability of detecting exo-
tic species was lowest when sampling in densely treed patches,
which usually contain no exotic plants (Abella and Covington,
2006a). In May–August 2003, we measured a total of 66 plots that
were sampled in a temporal sequence of alternating plots by eco-
system so there was no temporal bias to sampling. Plots were
20  25 m (0.05 ha) and contained 15, 1-m2 subplots centered at
0.5, 5, 12.5, 20, and 24.5 m along the bottom, middle, and top
25-m sides. The areal percent cover of each vascular plant species
rooted in each subplot was visually categorized as 0.1%, 0.25%, or
0.5%, 1% intervals from 1–10% cover, and 5% intervals from 10–
100%. Measurement error, based on remeasuring two randomly se-
lected subplots every six plots and calculating the difference be-
tween original and repeated measures, averaged <0.25% for total
cover and <0.25 species m2. We also surveyed the whole 0.05-
ha plot for species not already detected in subplots and assigned
these species a cover of 0.0067% (0.1%/15 subplots). We named
species, categorized their lifeform (graminoid, forb, or shrub),
and assigned native/exotic status (in North America) following
NRCS (2011).
In addition to plant community composition, we recorded and
derived a suite of environmental and disturbance variables on each
plot. From the center of plots, we recorded slope gradient (in %,
using a clinometer), aspect (transformed following Beers et al.
(1966)),
elevation,

system). At the southwestern and northeastern corners of plots, we
collected a 0–15 cm sample of the mineral soil from soil pits. We
analyzed the <2-mm fraction of samples for texture (hydrometer
method), pH (1:2 soil:CaCl2), organic C and total N (C/N analyzer),
and CaCO3 equivalent (gravimetric method) following Sparks
(1996) and Dane and Topp (2002). We converted nutrient concen-
trations to contents based on bulk density averaged from two,
280-cm3 soil cores with coarse fragment (>2 mm) volume in-
cluded. We obtained average annual precipitation and temperature
(using average minimum or maximum temperature returned re-
sults similar to average annual) for each plot using PRISM climate
data (Daly et al., 2008). We obtained several indicators of distur-
bance on plots including a grazing intensity variable (three catego-
ries of low, medium, and high) from Laughlin and Abella (2007),
distance in km to the nearest source of water (usually to livestock
tanks which can concentrate animal use and disturbance), and dis-
tance in km to the nearest road (based on mapped roads) from
georeferenced layers supplied by the U.S. Forest Service (Coconino
National Forest, Flagstaff, Arizona).
2.3. Data analysis
We calculated frequency (% of the 66 plots occupied) for each
species and its average percent cover (based on the mean of 15
subplots plot1) and relative percent cover. Relative percent cover
was calculated using the midpoints of cover classes for each spe-
cies on each plot as: (cover of speciesi/P cover of all species)  100.
For each plot, we calculated the mean number of species (richness)
m2 and the total number of species.
We assessed exotic species richness and cover relationships
with habitat variables using several techniques. We examined rela-
tionships between native and exotic richness at the two scales (m2
and 500 m2) and between native and exotic cover using best-ﬁt
regressions that maximized coefﬁcients of determination. To
assess multivariate relationships for exotic species richness and
cover, we used multiple regression with all potential environmen-
tal, disturbance, and native vegetation variables input as candidate
variables and with native vegetation variables excluded to isolate
inﬂuences of abiotic variables (SAS Institute, 2009). We used
one-way analysis of variance to compare exotic species richness
(m2 and 500-m2 scales) and cover and relative cover among eco-
systems followed by Tukey’s test for mean separation (SAS
Institute, 2009). All variables met assumptions of equal variance
(Levene’s test) and normality (Shapiro–Wilk test) after relative
cover was log transformed.
We evaluated patterns of exotic species composition using indi-
cator species analysis and multi-response permutation procedures.
At different hierarchical levels starting with a broad, two-group
classiﬁcation of dry (the ﬁrst four ecosystems of Table 1) and moist
(the last six) ecosystems, and ending at the ﬁnest resolution with
10 groups corresponding to each of the ecosystems, we used indi-
cator species analysis (Dufrêne and Legendre, 1997) to identify
species that signiﬁcantly corresponded to different ecosystem
groupings. Indicator species analysis combines the relative fre-
quency (based on the number of sampling units, in our case, plots
that a species occupied within a group) and relative abundance
(relative cover in our study) to produce an indicator value ranging
from 0% (no ﬁdelity to a group) to 100% (high ﬁdelity to a group)
for each species. We calculated P-values through 1000 permuta-
tions and implemented the analysis in PC-ORD (McCune and
Mefford, 1999). To compare exotic species composition (relative
cover) among ecosystems, we used multi-response permutation
procedures, with a Bonferroni correction for multiple tests applied
for pairwise comparisons among ecosystems (corrected P = 0.001;
McCune and Mefford, 1999).
3. Results
We recorded a total of 271 species (251 native and 20 exotic) on
the 66 plots. Of the exotic species, 10 were annuals or biennials,
two were annuals–perennials, and eight were perennials (Table
2). All of the exotic species were forbs or grasses; none were
shrubs. Taraxacum ofﬁcinale, Tragopogon dubius, Bromus tectorum,
Verbascum thapsus, and Poa pratensis were the most prevalent exo-
tic species. The total relative cover of exotic species ranged from 0%
to 47% among plots and averaged 4 ± 8% (±1 SD) across all plots.
Native and exotic species richness was positively correlated at
both the m2 and 500-m2 scales (Fig. 2). Native and exotic species
cover was also positively correlated, but the correlation was
weaker.
Multiple regressions including native vegetation and environ-
mental variables (no disturbance variables were statistically signif-
icant in these models) accounted for similar amounts of the
variance in exotic species richness (50% of variance) and cover
(51%; Table 3). Models excluding native vegetation variables and
including only environmental and disturbance variables portrayed

26–32% of the variance among exotic species measures. Combina-
tions of variables best estimating exotic species measures varied
by the measure of exotics and whether models included native
species. For example, exotic richness m2 was most strongly ex-
plained by geographic location and native plant cover. When na-
tive species variables were removed, however, distance to water
and slope gradient were included in the model, replacing location
variables. Native richness or individual native species were related
to exotic species richness at the 500-m2 scale and to exotic species
relative cover, but not to exotic richness m2. While exotic species
cover was positively related to total native cover, it was negatively
related to cover of two dominant native species, Muhlenbergia
montana and Bouteloua gracilis.
Exotic species richness m2, cover, and relative cover were
strongly related to ecosystem types (Fig. 3). Mean exotic richness
m2 varied from 0 in the black cinder to 1.6 species in the park eco-
system (F9,56 = 10.86, P < 0.001). In general, moist ecosystems were
more heavily invaded than dry ecosystems. Variation among eco-
systems did not statistically differ (F9,56 = 1.83, P = 0.080) at the
500-m2 scale, but the overall pattern of variation at the extremes
was the same: black cinder contained the fewest and park ecosys-
tems the most exotic species. Exotic species raw (F9,56 = 6.48,
P < 0.001) and relative cover (F9,56 = 4.00, P < 0.001) differed among
ecosystems, being greater in park and aspen ecosystems than in
drier ecosystems.
Exotic species community composition varied across ecosys-
tems based on multi-response permutation procedures (A = 0.18,
P < 0.001). Composition of park ecosystems differed from all eco-
systems except mesic limestone, mesic basalt, and aspen. This dif-
ference
was
driven
by
Poa
compressa,
as
park
ecosystems
averaged 1.4 ± 0.9% (±1 SD) while differing communities averaged
0.001 ± 0.007%,
and
by
P.
pratensis
where
parks
exhibited
4.0 ± 3.6% compared to an absence of this species in ecosystems
that differed from parks. Exotic communities in xeric limestone
ecosystems differed from all but clay basalt and xeric basalt ecosys-
tems. B. tectorum relative cover was greater in xeric limestone than
in differing ecosystems, with 0.8 ± 1.6% compared to 0.03 ± 0.15%.
Black cinder ecosystems differed from xeric limestone, mesic lime-
stone, rocky basalt, and park ecosystems. Five of six plots of the
sparsely invaded black cinder ecosystem were free of exotic plants.
Distributional patterns of individual species were harder to dis-
cern than those of community measures because more than half the
species were infrequent, occupying <10% of plots (Table 2). How-
ever, indicator species analysis at different hierarchical ecosystem
groupings and ecosystem-level analyses of frequency revealed that
some species showed ﬁdelity to some ecosystems. At the broadest
grouping (moist versus dry ecosystems), B. tectorum indicated drier
sites (indicator value [IV] = 44, P = 0.013).
P. pratensis (IV = 50,
P < 0.001) and T. ofﬁcinale (IV = 69, P < 0.001) indicated moist sites.
At the ﬁnest resolution (ecosystem level), P. compressa (IV = 83,
P < 0.001) and Polygonum aviculare (IV = 83, P < 0.001) indicated
park ecosystems. T. ofﬁcinale (IV = 69, P = 0.003) and P. pratensis
(IV = 46, P = 0.024) both indicated aspen ecosystems. Considering
plot frequencies among ecosystems, T. ofﬁcinale only occurred in
the six moist ecosystems, P. aviculare only in parks, P. pratensis
and P. compressa only in moist ecosystems, and Sisymbrium altissi-
mum only in drier ecosystems (Table 2). T. dubius, V. thapsus, and
Lactuca serriola displayed no clear site afﬁnities.
4. Discussion
4.1. General patterns
Some of the general ecological principles advanced in the litera-
ture and our a priori expectations for distributions of exotic species
communities were supported by the data, while others were not.
We found support for the principle that native and exotic species
richness and cover are positively correlated in landscape-scale sam-
pling studies (Stohlgren et al., 1999; Gilbert and Lechowicz, 2005;

Fornwalt et al., 2010). However, we found that environmental vari-
ables were more strongly related than disturbance to exotic species
richness and cover. Moreover, we introduced a tool – ecosystem
classiﬁcation – new to invasive species science that shows promise
for integrating factors (both environment and disturbance along
with management history) apparently related to exotic species dis-
tribution. As anticipated, moist ecosystems were generally most in-
vaded. Findings further have important implications for managing
exotic species related to information needs identiﬁed by mandates
such as the National Invasive Species Council (Clinton, 1999) and
U.S.
Forest
Service
(2004)
guidelines
for
managing
species
invasions. Results can help managers understand characteristics
of forest sites that are most invaded (useful for mapping and mon-
itoring of invasions), identify exotics that are most prevalent to
partly help prioritize species for monitoring and management,
and prioritize particular ecosystems for management and develop
ecosystem-speciﬁc management strategies. Evidence for our a pri-
ori hypotheses about native–exotic species relationships, the rela-
tive
importance
of
habitat
variables,
and
relationships
of
ecosystem classiﬁcation with distributions of exotic species com-
munities is important both for advancing theory on species inva-
sions and formulating management strategies.
4.2. Native–exotic species relationships
The hypothesis that native and exotic species richness would be
positively correlated was supported, indicating that sites with high
native richness were the most invaded. Determining the underly-
ing mechanisms behind the observed positive correlations requires
experimental research. Mechanisms could be related to environ-
mental conditions, inﬂuences of species richness per se, or other
factors. Positive correlations can result from site conditions favor-
able for natives also being favorable for exotics, coupled with the
ability of some or all of these species to thus far coexist (Levine
et al., 2004). The data provide some support for the hypothesis that
the most invaded sites were favorable for both native and exotic
species. The top two invaded ecosystems both share the character-
istic of lack ofP. ponderosa dominance: aspen ecosystems have only
small proportions of P. ponderosa and park ecosystems have no tree
overstories. These conditions alleviated a well-known limitation to
understory growth in P. ponderosa forests, as many studies have re-
ported negative correlations between P. ponderosa tree density and
understory productivity likely due to heavy shading, litter produc-
tion, and resource use by the trees (Sabo et al., 2009). Moreover,
both native (r = 0.55) and exotic (r = 0.51) species richness m2
were positively correlated with soil total N and negatively with
sand (r = 0.58 native, 0.43 exotic). This suggested that sites high
in N and water-holding capacity (primarily of the aspen and park
ecosystems) were favorable to both species groups. On the other
hand, the least-invaded ecosystem (black cinder) had the driest,
most nutrient-poor surface soils of all ecosystems (Table 1). This
ecosystem, also with the fewest native species, was apparently
unfavorable for the establishment of native and exotic species.
Palmer and Maurer (1997) offered three explanations for how
species richness per se might promote invasion. First, high species
richness can enhance environmental heterogeneity (e.g., multi-lay-
ered vegetation), creating a diversity of microsites available for col-
onization by invaders. Understory vertical and horizontal structure
was more complicated in the most-invaded ecosystems compared
to the least invaded (black cinder), but more detailed methods
quantifying structure would be needed to evaluate patterns in
intermediately invaded ecosystems. Second, sites with high rich-
ness can have a greater chance of containing a species promoting
invasion (i.e. ‘sampling effect’), such as a species that enhances soil
N availability. This is difﬁcult to evaluate in our data, as it is not
known which species in the P. ponderosa forest ﬂora might facili-
tate invasion. Moreover, legumes (e.g., Lupinus argenteus) that
may ﬁx N occurred in some heavily invaded ecosystems (e.g., as-
pen) but not others (park), and characteristics of potential inva-
sion-facilitators may vary among ecosystems. Additionally, high
species richness could have the opposite effect: a greater chance
of a site containing an invasion-inhibiting species (Fargione and
Tilman, 2005). Third, ecological equivalency can facilitate high
invasibility of species-rich sites. This theory suggests that species
can coexist because the environment is segregated into patches,
and while competitive exclusion can occur within a patch, the
‘winner’ will vary from patch to patch, if the species are equivalent,
thus increasing overall site species richness. None of our sample
sites contained >57% total plant cover, with vegetated patches

At
an
experimental
P. ponderosa forest site, McGlone et al. (2011) found that estab-
lished vegetated patches (whether comprised of native perennial
plants or the exotic annual B. tectorum) were resistant to invasion,
implying that new species would need to invade openings rather
than vegetated patches. The many mechanisms that might result
in observed invasibility patterns lend themselves to multifactor
experiments that manipulate these factors and also include the
potential for interactions among the factors and ecosystem types
across the landscape.
Based on Palmer and Maurer’s (1997) proposed mechanisms, it
could be hypothesized that in mensurative studies, the native:exo-
tic species richness correlation is strongest at broader (such as
500 m2) than at ﬁner scales (m2). Larger areas would include more

species, greater chances for equivalency, and more patch structure
and heterogeneity. However, we actually observed a stronger posi-
tive relationship between native and exotic richness at the m2
compared to 500-m2 scale. This ﬁnding also differs from Keeley
et al. (2003), where native and exotic richness were more posi-
tively correlated (r = 0.67) at 1000-m2 than m2 (r = 0.26) scales in
California Sierra Nevada conifer forests. Apparently in our study,
the averaging of the 15, m2 subplots spatially distributed within
a plot captured mechanisms responsible for the positive relation-
ship, or the number of exotic species 500 m2 had begun to satu-
rate. With the exception of the black cinder ecosystem, there was
evidence for saturation in that exotic species richness 500 m2
was more consistent among ecosystems than was exotic richness
m2. In other words, the 500-m2 plots may have detected the
majority of exotic species in the vicinity of plots which was reason-
ably consistent across ecosystems (with most averaging 3–4 exotic
species plot1), tempering variation in exotic richness between na-
tive species-poor and species-rich sites (Fig. 3).
The relationship between native and exotic species cover also
was positive, but weaker than for species richness. What appeared
consistent, however, based on examining the scatterplot, was a
threshold where sites with less than about 10% native cover did
not support the higher levels of exotic cover that could occur on
sites containing >10% native cover (Fig. 2). This may arise from
dry, infertile environments not being favorable for either exotic
or native species. Many sites with >10% native cover, however, also
supported minimal amounts of exotic cover. In these cases, the
identity of the native species might be more tightly linked to com-
munity invasibility than total native cover, serving to temper nati-
ve:exotic cover relationships (Abella et al., in press). For example,
the native perennial bunchgrasses (e.g., Festuca arizonica) and
sedges (e.g., Carex geophila) are strong competitors (Pearson,
1942) and may have reduced exotic cover on some of the sites with
high native cover.
4.3. Relative importance of habitat variables
Contrary to our hypothesis that native vegetation, environmen-
tal factors, and disturbance would account for equal proportions of
the variance in exotic species communities, native vegetation and
environmental factors were more closely related to exotic species
communities than the disturbance variables. Only distance to
water (linked primarily to artiﬁcial tanks where livestock and dis-
turbance are concentrated) entered exotic species models as a dis-
turbance variable and only when native vegetation variables were
not included (Table 3). However, our ﬁndings related to distur-
bance should be placed within the sampling context of the study.
For instance, we did not sample intensively disturbed areas such
as severe burns, expected to promote exotic plants (Floyd et al.,
2006; Hunter et al., 2006; Fornwalt et al., 2010). Examining a range
of disturbances across ecosystems warrants further research to
understand if disturbance and ecosystem type interact statistically
to inﬂuence exotic species communities. The landscape also was
the scale of our sampling. We did not speciﬁcally sample, for in-
stance, ﬁne-scale gradients (e.g., a scale of tens of meters) in dis-
tance from roads that can be related to exotic plant distribution
(e.g., Fowler et al., 2008; Mortensen et al., 2009), though not al-
ways (e.g., Craig et al., 2010). We also acknowledge that our mea-
sures of disturbance are crude (e.g., categorical variable of grazing
intensity). Yet, some other studies have used similar measures of
disturbance and have found stronger relationships with exotic
plant distributions (e.g., Gelbard and Harrison, 2003). The possible
importance of historical disturbances, such as late 1800s grazing
and railroad line development, in creating opportunities for exotic
plant introduction and spread should not be dismissed but are dif-
ﬁcult to retrospectively evaluate.
While a central tenet in invasive species science is that distur-
bance promotes invasions, we also should not assume that distur-
bance is always the principal driving factor for the establishment
and spread of exotic plant invasions (Alpert et al., 2000; Eschtruth
and Battles, 2009). Our ﬁnding of weaker relationships of exotic
plants with disturbance than with native vegetation and environ-
mental factors concurs with ﬁndings of some other studies includ-
ing in P. ponderosa forests. In Colorado, for instance, Fornwalt et al.
(2003) found that no exotic species measures differed between a
study area where logging, grazing, and most human recreation
had been excluded for the past 100 years compared to an area
where these uses had occurred. Speciﬁcally considering grazing,
studies in P. ponderosa forests have not reported that grazed areas
contain more abundant exotic plants than ungrazed areas. Study-
ing a 93-year-old livestock grazing exclosure within our study area,
Bakker et al. (2010) concluded that differences in plant composi-
tion were negligible inside and outside the exclosure. Similarly,
Sorensen and McGlone (2010) found that cover of the exotic
annual B. tectorum averaged 1% both inside and outside of 2-
year-old exclosures, while Rambo and Faeth (1999) reported that
exotic cover was actually greater outside (21%) compared to inside
(13%) exclosures. Again, however, a historical context is needed,
because all of these studies occurred in a contemporary period of
less intensive grazing than occurred in the past (Bakker and Moore,
2007). Furthermore, several of the exotic plants we recorded were
speciﬁcally introduced for range ‘improvements’ to provide live-
stock forage or were seed contaminants (Fowler et al., 2008).
4.4. Utility of ecosystem classiﬁcation
The hypothesis that exotic plant communities differed among
ecosystems was supported, with a general gradient of decreasing
invasion from moist to dry ecosystems. The speciﬁc patterns, how-
ever, suggested that factors other than general moisture availabil-
ity were related to invasion patterns and were captured by the
ecosystem classiﬁcation. For example, the rocky basalt ecosystem
is moist (Table 1) but had among the lowest exotic richness m2
and exotic cover. Rocky soils and clay bands near the surface
may have limited plant establishment (Abella and Covington,
2006a). Aspen ecosystems, among the most heavily invaded, con-
tained different overstories, leaf litter, soil properties, and likely
animal use (Martinsen et al., 1990) than other ecosystems, all of
which may have inﬂuenced the growing environment for plants.
The mesic basalt ecosystem contained silty soils high in N and
available water, which could be predicted to promote invasion,
yet this ecosystem was not among the most heavily invaded. Na-
tive species identity in this ecosystem may have been important
because the ecosystem was dominated by perennial bunchgrasses
and sedges that might competitively constrain invasion (McGlone
et al., 2011). An additional factor warranting consideration and fu-
ture research is that geographic locations of sites of some ecosys-
tems
were
clustered.
Spatial
correlation
of
sites
within
ecosystems would be expected if particular geographic regions
have a climate that supports only certain ecosystems or if soil par-
ent material is spatially clustered (Urban et al., 2000). For example,
sites of the black cinder ecosystem were clustered in the northeast-
ern part of the study area because this was an area of recent volca-
nic activity that also was climatically dry (Fig. 1). This type of
spatial structure can be viewed as a positive for helping to under-
stand species distributions if other factors (e.g., broad-scale species
dispersal) are also related to this spatial structure (Hawkins, 2012).
However, sites of other ecosystems were not spatially clustered,
such as the widely dispersed aspen ecosystem or the clay basalt
ecosystem
which
contained
sites
separated
by
over
65 km
(Fig. 1). These ecosystems appeared to re-occur wherever their
characteristic environments were located.
72

We hypothesize that the ecosystem classiﬁcation was related to
exotic species communities because it reﬂected interconnected envi-
ronmental, disturbance, and management regimes. In other words,
ecosystem-speciﬁc environments may have led to ecosystem-
speciﬁc disturbance and management regimes. For instance, parks
have unique environments because they are treeless, occupy low
positions in the landscape that accumulate water, and often have
clayey soils (Abella and Covington, 2006a). These are also locations
where native ungulates and livestock congregate; thus grazing (or
grazing-related activities such as livestock herding) may have been
important in this particular ecosystem even if not reﬂected in overall
landscape patterns. In another example, black cinder ecosystems
have unique environments characterized by coarse, gravelly soils.
These droughty, N-poor soils in turn limit plant productivity and
suitability for construction of livestock watering tanks. As a result,
livestock management and range improvements through intentional
seeding of exotic plants would not be anticipated to be as important
in this ecosystem in comparison to others (Abella and Covington,
2006a). While the regression models using continuous independent
variables accounted for ca. 50% of the variation in exotic species mea-
sures, these variables (e.g., soil laboratory data) are expensive to ob-
tain. The ecosystem classiﬁcation is already available to forest
managers as a map, and it accounted for orders of magnitude varia-
tion among forest sites in exotic plant abundance (Fig. 3). The data
suggest that ecosystem classiﬁcation integrated co-varying factors
related to exotic community distribution and is a useful tool for land-
scape-scale exotic species management.
4.5. Species distributions, introduction history, and impacts
The exotic species we detected appear widespread in south-
western P. ponderosa forests and many were introduced intention-
ally. For example, 14 of the 20 species detected in our study were
also detected by Fowler et al. (2008) at sites in three northern
Arizona national forests including our study forest. Excepting
Taraxacum laevigatum, 19 of our study’s species were on Sieg’s
(2003) list of exotic plants of P. ponderosa forests.
Over half of the exotic species in our study were on Fowler
et al.’s (2008) compilation of exotic species surmised to have been
intentionally introduced to North America or introduced as seed
contaminants (Table 2). It is difﬁcult to evaluate which species,
in what quantities, and in which locations exotic plants were
seeded speciﬁcally within our study area. Rangeland seeding pro-
jects have occurred for over 70 years, foresters and others some-
times carried seed bags and sowed seed during routine travels
and project visits (C.W. Denton, U.S. Forest Service retired, personal
communication, 2012), and little or no documentation exists for
most seedings. Lavin and Springﬁeld (1955), however, do provide
speciﬁc examples of seeding the exotics Dactylis glomerata, P. prat-
ensis, and Thinopyrum intermedium for livestock within our study
area, and based on Fowler et al. (2008), several other species have
likely been seeded speciﬁcally within the study area. Some exotic
species we recorded, such as Melilotus ofﬁcinalis, D. glomerata,
and T. intermedium, also have been used for wildﬁre revegetation
in the past 40 years in the Southwest (Peppin et al., 2011). While
the importance of these intentional seedings in the establishment
and spread of exotic plants is not known relative to other dispersal
mechanisms (e.g., transport by animals, wind, and human forest
visitors), the potential impact of intentional seeding and seed con-
tamination should not be overlooked (Fowler et al., 2008).
The stage of invasion of the species in our study is not clear, nor
is it apparent what impacts these species have had in the past or
may have in the future (Crooks, 2005). Many exotics seeded for
revegetation purposes have the ability to spread from introduction
sites, as Williamson and Harrison (2002) documented for D. glom-
erata in California grasslands and woodlands, at least under certain
climatic and site conditions. A common invasion pattern is a lag
phase after introduction, which can last many decades, followed
by exponential population growth of species with high invasive-
ness (Crooks, 2005). Few data on long-term spread rates of exotic
species are available for P. ponderosa forests, highlighting the po-
tential application of plot networks such as this study, combined
with other methods (e.g., surveys) for monitoring exotic plant dis-
tributions. Impacts of the invaders to indigenous ecosystems may
include competing with native plants, altering forage for native
herbivores and livestock, modifying soil properties, and changing
fuel characteristics that can alter ﬁre ecology (Parker et al.,
1999). Not all of the invaders may impact indigenous ecosystems
equally, however, potentially inﬂuencing which species are the pri-
orities for management. For example, B. tectorum is known to alter
soil properties and fuel characteristics (Upadhyaya et al., 1986). In
contrast, species such as T. ofﬁcinale may have less substantial im-
pact, or in the case of species such asV. thapsus, disappear from vig-
orous stands of native species (Stoddard et al., 2011). Moreover,
managers might be less concerned about the study area’s exotic
perennial grasses, which provide forage values, but more con-
cerned about species such as B. tectorum or Linaria dalmatica that
have little documented beneﬁt relative to their harmful effects in
indigenous ecosystems (Sieg et al., 2003).
4.6. Conclusion
Results can help meet information needs identiﬁed by the
National Invasive Species Council (Clinton, 1999) and U.S. Forest
Service (2004) guidelines for managing exotic species. For exam-
ple, while not intended as an exhaustive botanical survey, the data
provide a landscape-scale inventory of exotic species. This inven-
tory identiﬁed species that are currently infrequent, which can as-
sist
with
early
detection,
including
detecting
a
species
(T. laevigatum) not previously found on lists of exotic plants in
southwestern P. ponderosa forests (Sieg et al., 2003). Relating exotic
species community measures to native vegetation and environ-
mental factors helped to identify areas of the landscape that were
most invaded, which generally included sites with high ﬁne-scale
(1 m2) native species richness, high soil N and available water
(excepting rocky basalt sites), and low amounts of native perennial
bunchgrasses. This study also found that ecosystem classiﬁcation
was valuable for understanding invasion patterns across the land-
scape and is useful for exotic species management planning. For
example, management strategies may be ecosystem-speciﬁc: in
the little-invaded black cinder ecosystem, early detection of new
invaders may be a primary strategy, whereas containing existing
invasions may be more important in heavily invaded ecosystems.
