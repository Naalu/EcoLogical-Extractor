any ponderosa pine (Pinus
ponderosa) forests in the south-
western United States currently con-
sist of numerous small trees, with
high fuel loads and low herbaceous
understory diversity and productiv-
ity. Two mechanisms to restore these
forests include tree thinning and pre-
scribed fire (Fulé and others 1997).
Tree thinning can significantly affect
soil processes and tree and herba-
ceous productivity due to soil profile
disturbance and compaction (Jur-
gensen and others 1997, McNabb
and others 2001). The amount of
soil disturbance associated with tree
thinning often varies with the type of
equipment used, the amount of tree
removal, soil moisture content at the
timing of thinning, and the soil type
(for example, the amount of soil sur-
face organic matter) (Greacen and
Sands 1980, Howard and others
1981, Rab 1996).
As members of the Ecological
Restoration Institute, we undertook a
study to determine how different
thinning systems affected soils in pon-
derosa pine forests near Flagstaff in
northern Arizona. The specific objec-
tives of this study were to: 1) deter-
mine the effect of different harvest
severity levels and different harvest
systems on soil disturbance by catego-
rizing soil profile disturbance, and 2)
determine the effects of different har-
vest severity levels and different har-
vest systems on soil bulk density and
dead woody biomass. We hypothe-
sized that harvest levels, no matter
how severe, would not significantly
affect soil disturbance if the harvest
was conducted when the soil moisture
content was appropriate for specific
soil types because studies by Gent and
colleagues (1984) and Rab (1996)
showed that the majority of soil pro-
file disturbance and compaction
occurs during the initial passes of
thinning equipment. We also hypoth-
esized that different harvest systems
would have varying effects on soil dis-
turbance since studies by Dickerson
(1976) and Incerti and colleagues
(1987) illustrated that significantly
greater localized soil profile distur-
bance and compaction occurred in
areas that were harvested using desig-
nated skid trails than in areas without
designated skid trails.

Different Restoration Thinning Treatments
Affect Level of Soil Disturbance in Ponderosa
Pine Forests of Northern Arizona, USA
by Julie E. Korb, Peter Z. Fulé and Brian Gideon
ABSTRACT
Forest restoration in southwestern ponderosa pine forests often consists of tree thinning and prescribed fire. Under-
standing the effects of thinning treatments on soil integrity is important due to the potential negative effects on soil prop-
erties and plant composition and abundance. We investigated the effects of harvest severity levels (control, low,
intermediate, high) and harvest systems (machine, hand, whole-tree) on soil profile disturbance, soil bulk density, and
dead woody biomass. There were no significant differences in soil profile disturbance, soil bulk density, or dead woody
biomass among harvest severity levels. The whole-tree harvest system produced significantly larger areas with high lev-
els of soil profile disturbance and significantly smaller areas with no soil disturbance than either the machine- or hand-
harvest systems. There were no significant differences in soil bulk density due to insufficient sampling design. Dead woody
biomass was significantly lower in the whole-tree harvested areas than the hand- or machine-harvested areas. Dead
woody biomass can play an important role in providing microsites for plant reestablishment following disturbance. Our
results illustrate that the type of harvest system used in forest restoration treatments is an important factor that needs to
be incorporated into forest restoration design to insure compatibility with overall restoration goals.

the study site consisted of pure pon-
derosa pine stands, with a few large
trees intermixed with numerous
small trees. Dominant grass species
included mountain muhley (Muh-
lenbergia montana), Arizona fescue
(Festuca arizonica), and muttongrass
(Poa fendleriana). The elevation is
about 7,315 ft (2230 m) with an
average of 94 frost-free growing
days. Precipitation patterns include
scattered snowfall and rain during
the winter months, a pronounced
drought in May and June, followed
by frequent monsoon rains in July
and August.
Experimental Design
The U.S. Forest Service and Grand
Canyon Forests Partnership estab-
lished three blocks with four different
harvest severity treatments during the
summer of 1998 (12 treatment units).
Each treatment unit was roughly 40
acres (16 ha). Treatment units within
each block were randomly assigned
one of four harvest severity levels: 1)
no disturbance (control), 2) low-sever-
ity harvesting of about 598 trees/acre
(242 trees/ha), 3) intermediate-sever-
ity harvesting of about 420 trees/acre
(170 trees/ha), and 4) high-severity
harvesting to a level of remaining trees
similar to the forest density prior to
European settlement circa 1876 or
about 346 trees/acre (140 trees/ha).
We only counted trees taller than
breast height (4.5 ft or 1.4 m). All har-
vested treatment units were subse-
quently treated with prescribed fire
two years following the completion of
harvesting treatments. Data to deter-
mine the effect of different levels of
harvest and harvest systems on soil dis-
turbance, soil bulk density, and dead
woody biomass were collected before
prescribed burning treatments.
The reference condition for all har-
vest treatments was the pre-European
settlement pattern of tree species com-
position and spatial arrangement
(Moore and others 1999, Fulé and
others 2001). For our study, we
retained all living pre-European settle-
ment trees of all species for all harvest
treatments. In addition, wherever we
encountered remnant pre-settlement
material (snags, stumps, logs), several
of the largest post-settlement trees of
the same species within 30 ft (9.1 m)
were retained as replacements. If no
suitable trees were located within that
radius, the radius was extended to 60
ft (18.2 m). This thinning protocol
followed that established by Fulé and
his colleagues (2001).
We randomly assigned a different
harvest system to each block. Block 1
was machine harvested (referred to as
“machine” throughout the remaining
manuscript) between fall 1998 and
1999 using a cut-to-length head on a
small excavator. Yarding was done
with a rubber-tired forwarder and logs
were placed directly on haul trucks.
Fellers with chain saws harvested
Block 2 (referred to as “hand”
throughout the remaining manu-
script) between fall 1998 and 1999. A
rubber-tired forwarder was used to
bring harvested trees to landings. In
fall 2000, technicians used a small
dozer to pile slash to reduce fire haz-
ard and to permit broadcast pre-
scribed
burning.
Block
3
was
whole-tree harvested (referred to as
“whole-tree” throughout the remain-
ing manuscript) between fall 1998
and March 1999 when the soils were
dry or frozen. A feller-buncher was
used to harvest trees and yarding was
done with a rubber-tired skidder. A
de-limber/bucker was used at landing
areas where decks and slash piles were
created. All harvest systems were
implemented during dry weather
conditions.
All treatment units were treated
with prescribed fire within a year
timeframe (summer 1999-summer
2000) of cutting. Due to severe wild-
fire conditions, we were unable to
burn all units within the closer time-
frame that we actually preferred. The
variability in burn time did not affect
the results of this study, however,
because all measurements, except tree
measurements, were taken prior to
any of the treatments being burned.
Trees per unit area were estimated in
1999 for post-treatment data based
on residual tree information and were
compared with actual measurements
in 2000. We found no significant dif-
ferences between these numbers.
Soils
Soils in the study area are moderately
well-drained clays and clay loams
derived from flow and cinder basalt.
The A horizon extends only 4 inches
(10 cm), with the remaining soil pro-
file reaching from 45.6 to 60.8 inches
(114 to 152 cm) deep before encoun-
tering
fractured
basalt
bedrock
(Overby pers. comm.). All three
experimental blocks included two
classified soils: 1) a loamy-skeletal,
mixed Mollic Eutroboralf (Block 1
low severity thinning treatment,
Block 2 low severity, and Block 3 con-
trol) and 2) a fine, montmorillonitic
Mollic Eutroboralf (Block 1 and
Block 2 intermediate and high sever-
ity and control, and Block 3 low
severity). The soils found in Block 3’s
intermediate- and high-severity thin-
ning treatments are classified as fine,
montmorillonitic Typic Argiboroll
(Terrestrial Ecosystem Survey of the
Coconino
National
Forest, TES
1995). The fine, montmorillonitic
Mollic Eutroboralf and fine, mont-
morillonitic Typic Argiboroll soils are
both classified as being subject to soil
damage (compaction and displace-
ment) when wet. However, problems
with these soils can be mitigated if
ground-disturbing activities are lim-
ited to periods when the soils are dry
as they were during our harvest oper-
ations (TES 1995).
Field Sampling
We sampled 20 permanently located
plots using a 60-m grid within each of
the 12 treatment units. Each perma-
nently located plot consisted of a
400-m2 circular, fixed-area plot and
50-m line transect, both referenced
from the plot center. Overstory trees
taller than breast height were measured
on the 400-m2 circular, fixed-area plot
in 1998 and 2000. In addition, in
1998 and 2000, we recorded overstory

canopy cover (vertical projection) every
30 cm along the 50-m line transect ref-
erenced from plot center with 25 m ori-
ented upslope from plot center and 25
m below plot center. We estimated
overstory canopy cover by dividing the
total number of canopy hits by the total
number of points (166) collected along
the 50-m transect.
Dead woody biomass may either
increase or decrease depending on the
harvest system and severity level.
Quantifying dead woody biomass is
important because it can be either
detrimental or beneficial to vegetation
recovery following harvest. We mea-
sured dead woody biomass and forest
floor depth along the same 50-m tran-
sect following thinning in 1999, but
prior to prescribed burning, using the
methodology of Brown (1974). We
recorded fuel tallies for intercepts
along the transect in diameter classes
0-0.002 inches (0-0.6 cm), 0.002-0.1
inches (0.6-2.5 cm), 0.1-0.3 inches
(2.5-7.6 cm), and sound or rotten
fuels larger than 0.3 inches (7.6 cm)
by their specific diameter. The smaller
three diameter classes were measured
from 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 m along
the transect for 5-m intervals. We also
recorded sound or rotten fuels larger
than 0.3 inches along the entire tran-
sect. We recorded the depth of litter
and duff every 5 meters. Woody fuel
biomass for individual size classes was
calculated using procedures presented
in work by Brown (1974).
In 1999, we visually assessed soil
profile disturbance and categorized it
into five different groups along the
entire 50-m line transect using a soil
profile disturbance classification sim-
ilar to the method established by Rab
(1994). This methodology can be
used for different forest types because
it is based strictly upon the percentage
of disturbance to the O-horizon,
thereby minimizing differences in O-
horizon depths between forest types.
The five disturbance groups included:
1) bladed road, 2) heavy disturbance,
3) intermediate disturbance, 4) light
disturbance, and 5) no disturbance. A
bladed road is any area where a road
was constructed to remove trees.
Heavy disturbance is any area where
more than 75 percent of the organic
soil (O-horizon) has been removed or
disturbed and/or where deep gouges
or ruts are visible in the soil. Moder-
ate disturbance is any area where 40-
75 percent of the O-horizon has been
removed or disturbed due to harvest-
ing activity. Light disturbance is any
area where less than 40 percent of the
O-horizon has been removed due to
harvesting activity.
Prior to the prescribed burning treat-
ments in 1999, we sampled soil bulk
density at 20 m along each transect to
quantify soil compaction (n = 20/unit)
following the initial thinning. Field
staff used a 1.9-inch (4.8-cm) cylindri-
cal metal bulk density sampler to
remove soil samples at a depth of 4
inches (10 cm) and 0.5 m away from
the transect to prevent disturbance on
the transect. These samples were oven-
dried for 24 hours at 221˚ F (105˚ C)
to determine bulk density (Page-
Dumroese and others 1999). We deter-
mined the total bulk density by divid-
ing the oven-dry mass by the sample
volume. Bulk density was not corrected
for rock fragments because few samples
had rock fragments.
Statistical Analysis
We used analysis of variance (ANOVA)
to determine the effect of harvest treat-
ments on soil disturbance and bulk
density for data collected in 1999. We
used repeated measures multivariate
analysis of variance (MANOVA) in
SPSS version 8 (SPSS 1998) to deter-
mine the effect of harvest treatments on
trees/hectare, tree basal area, tree
canopy, and the effect of slash piling in
Block 2 (hand) on post-harvest soil dis-
turbance. We used the Shapiro Wilk
test to test data for normality and
Leven’s test to test for homogeneity of
the variance (Milliken and Johnson
1984). Prior to analysis, data were
square root transformed as necessary to
improve normality and homoscedas-
ticity assumptions (Zar 1984). We used
Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference
(HSD) test to make multiple compar-
isons of means following a significant
result (p ≤0.05).
Results
We found that the harvest severity
level did not cause significant differ-
ences (p ≤0.05) in soil profile distur-
bance (Figure 1a), soil bulk density
(Table 1), or dead woody biomass and
forest floor depth (Table 2). In con-
trast, different harvest systems pro-
duced significant differences in soil
profile disturbance (Figure 1b) and
dead woody biomass (Table 2),
although there were no significant
differences in soil bulk density (Table
1) or forest floor depth (Table 2).
Specifically, the whole-tree system
caused no disturbance on a signifi-
cantly (p ≤0.05) smaller portion of
the study area (41.3 percent) than
machine (64.5 percent) or hand
(64.9 percent) systems (Figure 1b). In
addition, there was a significantly
(p ≤0.05) higher proportion of the
study area with high disturbance in
the whole-tree system thinned areas
(13 percent) than either the machine
(3 percent) or hand (2.3 percent)
system thinned areas (Figure 1b).
Intermediate disturbance with the
whole-tree system (22.3 percent) was
almost double both the machine
(10 percent) and hand systems
(11.3 percent), although these differ-
ences were not significant (p ≤0.05)
(Figure 2b).
Total woody debris was signifi-
cantly lower in areas treated with the
whole-tree system (34.7 lbs/acre or
38.9
kg/ha)
than
the
machine
(56.4 lbs/acre or 63.2 kg/ha) or hand
(59.6 lbs/acre or 66.7 kg/ha) systems
(Table 2). In Block 2 (hand), where
soil profile disturbance was measured
before and after slash piling, there was
a significantly (p ≤0.05) larger area
that had no disturbance prior to pil-
ing (64.9 percent) than after piling
(29.2 percent) (Figure 1c). There was
also significantly (p ≤0.05) lower
high disturbance prior to piling (2.3
percent) than after piling (14.2 per-
cent) (Figure 1c).

Not surprisingly, trees per hectare,
tree basal area, and tree canopy cover
declined significantly from pre-treat-
ment to post-treatment in all cases,
except for the controls (Table 3).
There were no significant differences
for trees per hectare for individual
diameter classes among pre- or post-
treatment measurements for different
harvest severity levels (Figure 2a). In
contrast, there were significantly more
trees per unit area pre-treatment in
the 3.9-inch (10-cm) and 7.9-inch
(20-cm) diameter classes for the areas
thinned with machine and hand sys-
tems than the whole-tree system (Fig-
ure 2b). In addition, there were
significantly fewer trees in the 11.8-
inch (30-cm) diameter class per unit
area pre-treatment for the machine
and hand treatments than the whole-
tree treatment (Figure 2b). Overall,
there was no significant difference
(p ≤0.05) between either pre- or
post-treatment trees per unit area, tree
basal area, and tree canopy cover
among harvest severity levels or
among harvest systems due to the
high variability in our data within
replicated treatments (Table 3). There
was, however, a difference between
the low- and high-severity harvest lev-
els post-treatment for trees per unit
area (p ≤0.06).
Discussion and
Management
Recommendations
While reducing tree density is one nec-
essary component to restoring south-
western ponderosa pine ecosystems
(Covington and others 1997, Lynch
and others 2000), restoration thinning
treatments need to be designed to min-
imize their effects on ecosystem
integrity. Because soils are important to
the ecological integrity of an ecosys-
tem, and play a vital role in ecosystem
function and vegetation response fol-
lowing disturbance (Wali 1999), their
integrity must be considered.
While we controlled for differences
in soil types by harvesting during
periods of dry weather, we found that

areas harvested using the whole-tree
system produced a significantly larger
proportion of the study area with high
soil profile disturbance than the
machine or hand harvested areas.
Specifically, our study showed that
the machine and hand systems
resulted in significantly less soil pro-
file disturbance than the whole-tree
system. Numerous other studies have
shown tree-length harvesting with a
rubber-tired skidder caused soil dis-
turbance and compaction (Dickerson
1976, Jakobsen and Moore 1981, Rab
1996, Brais 2001), which is similar to
our whole-tree harvest system. How-
ever, the high level of soil profile dis-
turbance in whole-tree harvested areas
may also have been caused by a larger
amount of basal area being removed
from these areas—more than twice
the amount removed from either the
machine- or hand-harvested system
areas. Because of these confounding
factors, it is impossible to conclude if
only one factor was the reason for dif-
ferences in soil disturbance or if it was
a combination of factors.
Contrary to our expectations, our
study did not show significant changes
in soil compaction due to our experi-
mental design being insufficient to
detect these changes. We systemati-
cally located transects throughout the
study units but did not stratify for
areas with skid trails and landing areas.
Other soil disturbance studies have
shown that generally there are only
significant changes in soil compaction
in small portions of the harvested area
and that locating sampling areas in
skid trails and landing areas using
stratified sampling is necessary to
accurately quantify soil compaction
associated with skid trails and landing
areas (Incerti and others 1987, Rab
1996). As a result, we recommend
that future studies use a stratified ran-
dom sampling approach to quantify
soil disturbance in severely disturbed
areas, such as skid trails and landing
areas. In addition, while we only sam-
pled for changes in soil compaction,
other soil physical properties may have

been altered due to disturbance,
including decreased macroporosity,
redistribution of organic matter,
decreased
infiltration
rates,
and
increased surface runoff (Rab 1994).
We also want to acknowledge that
studies designed to measure differ-
ences in harvest severity levels and
harvest systems are difficult because
of the logistics and expense of mov-
ing equipment considerable dis-
tances to treat different areas. In our
study, we randomly located different
harvest severity levels within individ-
ual experimental blocks; we were not
able to randomly locate different
harvest systems in each block. As a
result, a particular harvest system
was only applied within one block
making our inferences regarding how
different harvest systems affect soil
disturbance limited.
Despite
its
shortcomings,
the
results of our study do suggest that
soil disturbance during the forest
restoration thinning process is the
result of numerous interacting fac-
tors. Moreover, determining one
major causal factor is difficult, if not
impossible, due to the difficulty of
controlling all variable factors in
large-scale studies. We recommend
that land managers design harvest
treatments that will minimize unnec-
essary soil disturbance. Specifically,
managers should choose the harvest
treatment on a site-specific basis tak-
ing into account both ecological com-
ponents, such as soils, that are not
always included in designing harvest
treatments, and mechanized compo-
nents so that the outcome of harvest
treatments will be more compatible
with restoration goals. For example, if
the restoration goal is to minimize soil
disturbance and add dead woody bio-
mass to provide microsites for plant
establishment, then the machine or
hand harvest systems are more desir-
able than a whole-tree harvest system.

Figure 2 (a-b). Trees per hectare in 10-cm diameter classes for pretreatment (1998) and post-
treatment (1999) for a) three different harvest severities; and b) three different harvest systems.
Significant difference (p ≤0.05) among pretreatment harvest severities and among pretreatment
harvest systems were determined by ANOVA and are denoted by asterisks: * (< 0.05), ** (< 0.01).
There were no significant differences among post-treatment harvest severities or among post-
treatment harvest systems.
