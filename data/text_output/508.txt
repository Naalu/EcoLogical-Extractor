Abstract—Disturbances generated by forest restoration treatments have the potential 
for enhancing the establishment of nonnative species thereby impeding long-term 
native plant recovery. In a ponderosa pine forest next to the Fort Valley Experimental 
Forest, Arizona, we examined the establishment of nonnative species after three alter-
native treatments with different intensities of tree thinning, coupled with prescribed 
burning and an untreated control, in relation to total species abundance and rich-
ness. Pretreatment data were collected in 1998 and postreatment responses were 
measured from 2001 through 2006. Total herbaceous cover and richness were signif-
icantly higher in the two more intensely thinned areas compared to the control over 
the entire post-treatment period. Native species were the most prevalent in terms of 
cover (92%) and richness (90%) across all treated units, though greater understory 
plant responses were linked to heavier amounts of tree thinning. Nonnative species 
abundance and richness also increased significantly in response to restoration treat-
ments, particularly in the two more intense treatments. The proportion of nonnative 
abundance to the total abundance within the two heavily treated areas decreased 
through time and began to converge back towards the undisturbed control unit. One 
year following treatments, 15% of the total cover (27%) was composed of nonna-
tive species in the heaviest treated unit. This proportion dropped almost 50% by the 
fifth year following treatment. Our results suggest that disturbances associated with 
restoration treatments can facilitate establishment of nonnative plants, however the 
post-treatment plant community was increasingly dominated by native species.
Introduction
Altered forest structure, functional processes and past land management prac-
tices have led to many critical conservation problems in southwestern ponderosa 
pine ecosystems, including loss of native biological diversity, declining herbaceous 
productivity and increased severity of disturbances such as wildfires (Bakker and

Moore 2007, Covington and Moore 1994). Currently, efforts are underway to restore 
the ecological integrity and biodiversity of these ecosystems. Ecological restoration 
treatments, using thinning and prescribed fire are an effective approach for revers-
ing the loss of habitat and biodiversity in ponderosa pine ecosystems (Landres et 
al.1999, Moore et al. 1999). Both overstory thinning and prescribed burning can have 
mixed results on understory recovery, depending upon thinning level, burning fre-
quency and severity, the community composition prior to the disturbance, past land 
use and climatic conditions during ecosystem recovery (Swetnam and Betancourt 
1998; Wienk et al. 2004). While a primary goal of ecological restoration is to promote 
a self-sustaining indigenous plant community possessing all functional groups neces-
sary to maintain the ecosystem (SER 2004), disturbances can shift the system into an 
alternate stable state (Laycock 1991). Proliferation of nonnative, disturbance-loving 
plant species can alter the successional trajectory of an ecosystem, leading to unde-
sired results from the restoration project (Allen et al. 2002, Westoby et al. 1989).
Here, our objectives were to: (1) evaluate nonnative plant responses to different 
intensities of restoration treatments and (2) track changes in understory vegetation 
cover and richness over time. We hypothesized that total plant cover and richness, 
including nonnative species, would increase with increasing treatment intensity. 
However, we also hypothesized that nonnative species would eventually decline over 
time and contribute relatively little to the overall understory composition.
Methods
Study Site
We implemented restoration treatments on a ~56-ha (140-acre) site adjacent to 
the Fort Valley Experimental Forest, on the Coconino National Forest, northwest of 
Flagstaff, Arizona (N 35° 16’, W 111° 44’). Prior to treatment, stands were close- 
canopied, even-aged “blackjack” Pinus ponderosa that averaged 726 trees/ha 
(1793  trees/acre) with occasional patches of presettlement “yellowpine.” Stands 
were previously thinned but remained close-canopied. For a detailed site description 
reference Korb et al. (2007). Mean annual precipitation is 56 cm (22 in), although 
precipitation varied extremely throughout the duration of the study (Figure 1).
Restoration Treatments
All treatments focused on restoring site-specific overstory density and spatial ar-
rangement consistent with presettlement forest patterns (Covington and Moore 1994, 
Fulé et al. 1997, Mast et al. 1999). Restoration treatments retained all living pre-
settlement trees (described in: Covington and Moore 1994, White 1985). In addition, 
we retained postsettlement trees as replacements for remnant presettlement materials 
(e.g snags, logs, stumps). The three treatments differed in the numbers of postsettle-
ment trees selected to replace dead presettlement evidence as described in Fulé et al. 
(2001). Trees were whole tree harvested, creating large slash piles. Slash piles were 
then burned prior to broadcast burning. Broadcast burning was conducted in spring 
2000.
Treatments were randomly assigned to each unit and included: (a) 1.5-3 tree re-
placement (high-intensity), (b) 2-4 tree replacement (medium-intensity), (c) 3-6 tree 
replacement (low-intensity), and (d) no thinning, no burning (Control).

Field methods and analysis
Each treatment was applied on a 14-ha (35-acre) unit. We established twenty 
subplots in each of the four treatment units. Understory data were collected in 
1998 (pre-treatment), and re-measured in 2001, 2002, and 2006. A 50-m (164-ft) 
point line transect was used to quantify plant foliar cover and a belt transect 500m2 
(5382ft2) was use to quantify species richness on each plot (modified from USDI 
NPS 1992).
Statistical comparisons between the treatment units were carried out using 20 
pseudoreplicated subplots in each treatment, since only one instance of each ex-
perimental treatment was implemented to each experimental unit. Understory 
total cover and richness within treatment were analyzed with repeated measures 
MANOVA. To account for significant differences in pretreatment richness, 1998 
data were included as part of the effects model and analyzed with repeated mea-
sures MANCOVA. Total cover was transformed (square-root) in order to meet 
ANOVA assumptions. Following a significant treatment x time result, we compared 
treatment differences within year with Tukey’s post hoc tests. Treatment effects on 
nonnative cover and richness were analyzed using non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis 
tests because these data strongly violated the assumption of normality. When re-
sults were significant, Mann-Whitney tests were used to make pairwise treatment 
comparisons. For all analyses, α = 0.05. Where appropriate, alpha levels were ad-
justed using a Bonferonni correction (Kuehl 1994).

Results
We detected no pretreatment differences for any parameter except total richness 
(Figure 2). Total cover and richness averaged 12.3% and 18.4 species, respectively 
across all experimental units. Nonnative species contributed <1% of the cover and 
richness prior to treatment.

After treatment, total plant cover and richness differed significantly among treat-
ments, time and treatment x time interaction (Figure 2). Plant cover and species 
richness were greatest in the high- and medium-intensity units following every 
posttreatment year. There were no differences in plant cover between the control 
and low-intensity treatments, although species richness was significantly greater in 
the low-intensity unit when compared to the control unit. Graminoids dominated 
the posttreatment understory (Table 1). Though the majority of increases in total 
cover and richness were due to native plants, there was a significant increase in 
nonnative species richness on all three treatments and nonnative cover in the high- 
and medium-intensity plots.
In 2001(one year following burning), the understory in the high- and medium-
intensity treatments showed significant increases in nonnative species cover and 
richness when compared to the low-intensity treatment and untreated control unit 
(Figure 2). Nonnative species comprised of 17% and 12% of the total understory 
cover (24.6%) and species richness (35.0), respectively across the two higher in-
tensity treatments. In 2006, nonnative species cover continued to be significantly 
greater in the high- and medium-intensity treatments though decreased when com-
pared to initial responses (Figure 2). Species richness continued to be significantly 
different between treatment and control units, however did not differ among the 
treatment intensities (Figure 2). The most common nonnative species across all 
treated units included: Verbascum thapsus, Linaria dalmatica, Cirsium vulgare 
(Table 1).
Discussion
Plant cover and species richness increased with thinning and prescribed burning 
treatments with the greatest responses occurring in the areas most heavily thinned. 
Our results are consistent with several other overstory-understory studies in ponde-
rosa pine forest that demonstrated increases in understory productivity through the 
reduction of overstory density (Moore et al. 2006, Wienk et al. 2004, Moore and 
Deiter 1992). Research has also shown that understory production and diversity 
increases following fire, though increases are often species specific and highly de-
pendent on the fire severity (Harris and Covington 1983, Wayman et al. 2006).
Disturbances have highly variable impacts on understory communities and often 
promote the establishment of nonnative species (Griffis et al. 2001, Keeley 2005). 
In our study the post-disturbance flora was comprised of mostly native species, 
although significant increases in nonnative species were found in the high- and 
medium-intensity treatments. While several of the nonnative species are of man-
agement concern, the total average cover of nonnative species did not exceed 5.0% 
in any of the treated units. Only Verbascum thapus had foliar cover greater than 3%, 
immediately following treatment. After five years, however, cover had reduced to 
less than 0.5%.

Disturbance severity is often an important predictor in the spread of nonnative 
species (Crawford et al. 2001, Hunter et al. 2006, Keeley 2005). For example, 
Crawford et al. 2001 found high values of nonnative species establishment follow-
ing severe wildfires, whereas Laughlin et al. (2004) found few nonnative species 
following a low-intensity wildfire. In the present study, prescribed fire severities 
were relatively low; though burning of slash piles resulted in high fire severity on 
a local scale that may have promoted the establishment of nonnative species. Our 
results suggest that varying levels of thinning intensity may influence the estab-
lishment of nonnatives species, though thinning trees in general has the potential 
to promote the establishment of nonnative plants (Hunter et al. 2006). Different 
harvesting techniques may also produce different levels of soil disturbance that can 
facilitate the establishment of nonnative species (Battles et al. 2001, Korb et al. 
2007). The present study was whole-tree harvested which can produce high levels 
of soil disturbance (Korb et al. 2007), thereby facilitating the initial establishment 
of nonnative species.
Disturbance is inevitable in ecological restoration treatments, thereby providing 
an opportunity for nonnative species to establish (D’Antonio and Meyerson 2002). 
What is not exactly clear is whether this invasion is short-lived or whether such 
disturbances provide an opportunity for the long-term persistence of nonnative spe-
cies. Our results suggest disturbances associated with restoration treatments can 
facilitate the establishment of nonnative plants. Encroachment by nonnative species 
does not mean that these species will dominate the system (Figure 3). Time since 
disturbance should be considered an important factor when evaluating restoration 
targets within southwestern ponderosa pine forests. While our results are encourag-
ing, more research is clearly needed as ecosystems are dynamic and further changes 
in community composition and structure are to be expected. The continued pres-
ence of aggressive nonnative species suggests continued monitoring of the site and 
potentially, further maintenance of the understory.
