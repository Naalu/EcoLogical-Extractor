Executive Summary 
This Rapid Assessment (RAP) report provides a summary of research on forest structure 
reference conditions and natural range of variability (NRV), as they relate to the frequent-fire 
vegetation types within the Black River Forest Restoration Project (BRFRP). The project lies 
entirely within the Wallow Fire perimeter but was largely burned with low to moderate severity. 
The assessment focused on the ponderosa pine and dry mixed-conifer frequent-fire Ecological 
Response Units (ERUs) within the BRFRP perimeter. This report includes a summary from a 
report on restoration needs within the Wallow Fire. The RAP concludes with how best available 
science (BASI) may fit within the context of U.S. Forest Service policy and the Apache-
Sitgreaves National Forest (ASNF) Land Management Plan (Revised Aug. 15, 2016).   
 
Project Background and Intent 
In the aftermath of the 2011 Wallow Fire, the Ecological Restoration Institute (ERI) at Northern 
Arizona University has provided program and project support to the Apache-Sitgreaves NF 
(ASNF) on several fronts. On May 10, 2016, ERI met with ASNF leadership and 
Interdisciplinary (ID) Team members1 to accomplish a Needs Assessment of how ERI could 
provide Best Available Science Information (BASI) to contribute to the ASNF National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) analysis of key watershed areas within the Wallow Fire 
footprint.   
 
At that time, the ASNF had recently (February 2015) initiated the 170,000-acre Black River 
Forest Restoration Project (BRFRP) to assess and consider additional restoration and 
rehabilitation treatments in the fire area. The Needs Assessment process identified the following 
considerations during the project planning phase of the project:  
 
 The BRFRP would be based on BASI and built on previous assessments and treatments 
(i.e., BAER, R-3 RAT Recovery Plan, Beaver Creek RAP, research publications, 
Watershed Rapid Assessment Plan, Proper Functioning Condition Assessments, etc.) 
 Desired Conditions, guidelines, and subsequent treatments will adhere to the newly 
revised (2016) ASNF Land Management Plan and current Forest Service Manual (FSM) 
policy direction. 
 The assessments and project design would inform restoration desired conditions for 
ecosystem structure, composition, and function across the watershed. 
 The ERI will provide a RAP report for the BRFRP for ID Team reference. The RAP will 
include a review of local literature for forest structure reference conditions and NRV, and 
other relevant information for dry mixed-conifer and ponderosa pine forests for the 
project area.

After the project initiation meeting with ASNF leadership and staff officers in May 2016, staff 
from ERI sought input from ASNF resource specialists to further assess best available science 
support, frame questions that would need to be answered through site visits and literature review, 
and identify priority areas within the project. ERI staff conducted field assessments with ASNF 
during July and September (2016) field visits and met with available resource staff on priority 
areas across the project throughout summer 2016. 
 
In general, ERI uses a two-pronged approach when working with Forest Service staff to rapidly 
assess the best available science for a project the size and scope of BRFRP:  
 
(1) Understand the project scope, including predominant vegetation types and draft 
objectives.  
(2) Support opportunities to achieve forest restoration goals, including scientific summaries 
based on regional and local research on:  
a) Forest and fire ecology. 
b) The NRV and reference conditions for dry forest systems. 
 
Science Summaries  
The BRFRP is approximately 170,000 acres and includes a total of nine vegetation 
classifications (Ecological Response Units, Figure 2). For the purposes of this RAP, ERI focused 
on ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and dry mixed-conifer forest types with multiple species 
including Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga 
menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), aspen 
(Populus tremuloides), southwestern 
white pine (Pinus strobiformus) and 
more mesic-adapted white fir (Abies 
concolor). These two vegetation types 
combined represent 48 percent of the 
planning area, with ponderosa pine the 
majority at just over 60,000 acres. Past 
projects and forest plan direction 
recognize the majority of management 
needs fall within these vegetation types. 
The scientific literature on southwestern 
ponderosa pine ecology and disturbance 
regimes is some of the most abundant of 
forested types. Dry mixed-conifer 
research has been rapidly accumulating 
in recent years, although the 
classification represents a broader range 
of forest types, including a range of 
forest composition and disturbance 
variability.  
 
The NRV for forest structure can be 
estimated by pooling reference 

3 
 
conditions across sites within a forest type and can help to describe attributes of forest structure, 
composition, and key functional processes, such as fire frequency, that were associated with 
resilient and sustainable systems (Landres et al. 1999). Reference conditions for a forest type are 
developed from site-specific data and vary from site to site due to differences in factors such as 
soil, elevation, slope, and aspect (Reynolds et al. 2013).  
 
Reference conditions are limited to the spatial extent and sample area of that study. However, 
reference conditions can be established for a variety of systems at different scales (ponderosa 
pine reference conditions within the BRFRP area versus ponderosa pine reference conditions 
across the state of Arizona).  
 
Some key resources for understanding reference conditions associated with the BRFRP are the 
Rocky Mountain Research Station’s General Technical Report 310 (Reynolds et al. 2013); the 
ERI Fact Sheet “Compilation of Historical Forest Structural Characteristics across the Southern 
Colorado Plateau” (Stoddard 2011); and the Nature Conservancy’s Historical Range of Variation 
and State and Transition Modeling work for U.S. Forest Service Region 3 (TNC 2008). 
 
Ponderosa Pine (ERU = Ponderosa pine forest) 
 
Forest Structure, Composition, and Disturbance 
Ponderosa pine (PIPO) forests throughout the Southwest formerly experienced low-intensity 
surface fires of frequent return intervals (Weaver 1951, 1952; Cooper 1960; Dieterich 1980; 
Covington and Moore 1994; Swetnam and Baisan 1996). These low-severity fires maintained 
forest composition, structure, and spatial patterns characterized by low densities of often-
clumped trees, in a matrix of grasses, forbs, and shrubs (Covington et al. 1994b). Multiple 
studies have documented southwestern ponderosa pine pre-settlement age and size structure, and 
found that southwestern ponderosa pine tree densities tend to fall into a density range of 20-60 
trees per acre (TPA), with some situations of higher densities (Covington and Moore 1994; Fulé 
et al. 1997; Mast et al. 1999; Moore et al. 1999; Huffman et al. 2001; Fulé et al. 2002; Fulé et al. 
2003; Gildar et al. 2004; Moore et al. 2004; Cocke et al. 2005; Roccaforte et al. 2014; and 
summarized in Stoddard et al. 2011). Historically, there was a larger proportion of older, larger 
trees than younger smaller trees compared to contemporary forests (Covington and Moore 1994, 
Fulé et al. 1997). Ages of stems within groups were variable, both even and un-even aged. White 
(1985) found an even-aged group had tree regeneration all within the range of 33 years, while an 
uneven-aged group had tree regeneration across a range of 268 years. The Woolsey plot study 
(Moore et al. 2004) showed contemporary tree diameter distribution shifted toward smaller size, 
and younger age classes from 1910 to 1999.  
 
Canopy cover can be measured a variety of ways, which makes it difficult to utilize for 
management. On basalt soils, White (1985) determined a pre-settlement canopy cover value of 
22 percent, while Covington and Sackett (1986) determined a value of 17 percent. Pearson 
(1923) stated “rarely does ponderosa pine crown cover reach more than 30 percent, and usually 
not over 25 percent.” In general, “the typical western yellow pine forest of the Southwest is a 
pure parklike stand made up of groups from 2-20 trees, usually connected by scattered 
individuals” (Woolsey 1919). Overall, the range of canopy cover for ponderosa pine from studies 
in Arizona was about 10-50 percent (Reynolds et al. 2013). 

4 
 
 
Studies of pre-settlement ponderosa pine reference spatial patterns in the Southwest are limited 
to small scales of less than 10 acres. Studies using historic mapped plots (Woolsey plots, 
established between 1909 and 1925 (Moore et al. 2004)) show changes from forests with 
aggregated trees (patches) to a forest of one patch, with a largely homogenized diameter and age 
distribution (Sánchez Meador et al. 2009). Additionally, Cooper (1960) used a contiguous 
quadrat analysis of two study areas in the White Mountains of eastern Arizona to determine trees 
were clumped, with tree groups ranging in size from 0.16 to 0.32 acres (Covington and Moore 
1994). White (1985) used the nearest neighbor technique to determine clump size and 
distribution in the Gus Pearson Natural Area, and reported that most groups were composed of 3 
to 44 trees, and each group varied in size from 0.05 to 0.70 acres in size. Moore et al. (1993) 
studied the same area and determined groups to average around 0.16 acres, with a range of 0.08 
to 0.64 acres. Other studies show variable tree patterns, with evidence of random tree distribution 
where stands consist of many single trees (Abella and Denton 2009). Random versus aggregate 
spatial distributions of ponderosa pine trees can be correlated to soil type and climate. Abella and 
Denton (2009) found higher proportions of tree aggregation were found on mesic basalt soils, 
with higher proportions of trees in a random distribution found on black cinder or clay basalt soil 
types. Regional ecosystem classifications, e.g., Terrestrial Ecosystem Survey (Robbie 1992), 
may be used to inform expected density and distribution patterns (Abella and Denton 2009). 
 
In addition to stand reconstruction studies, an analysis of a comprehensive network of fire scar 
studies indicates that for 53 ponderosa pine sites in Arizona and New Mexico, the mean fire 
return intervals (MFI) were 2 to 17 years for fires scarring one or more trees and 4 to 36 years for 
fires scarring between 10 percent and 25 percent of trees (Swetnam and Baisan 1996). Fire scar 
data has the highest confidence between the years of 1700 (older samples are fewer on the 
landscape) and 1900 (fires were excluded by 1900 by a variety of factors (Swetnam and Baisan 
1996)). Touchan et al. (1994) identified the major factors controlling differences in fire intervals 
among sites as topography, grazing history, and climatic variability, and not habitat type.  
 
Recent literature also suggests evidence for longer fire return intervals historically in ponderosa 
pine and dry mixed-conifer forests (Baker and Ehle 2001; Williams and Baker 2012; Williams 
and Baker 2013). While the authors have added to the body of science and contributed research 
that utilized historical data (e.g., General Land Office Surveys), they have also spurred rebuttal 
papers questioning their methodology and conclusions. For example, the 2012 Williams and 
Baker paper suggests GLO data infer stand replacing fires were a key component of ponderosa 
pine forests. However, the paper lumped data across forest types, including higher elevation, 
historically mixed-severity fire, to make that conclusion. The paper also includes assumptions—
for example, that the presence of small trees infers a stand-replacing event—that are not 
supported by other stand reconstruction data sets (Fulé et al. 2013). The 2001 Baker and Ehle 
paper confounds fire return intervals by creating the assumption that all trees should show a scar 
from all fires (Fulé et al. 2006). 
 
The 1960 Cooper study is widely cited across the West, but also provides localized information 
from the White Mountains, ASNF, Arizona, where Cooper found an average TPA of 40, with a 
range of 35-45 TPA. In addition to Cooper’s study, Stoddard’s (2011) compilation of published 
historic data cited two study locations on the ASNF: 1) Mineral, Arizona with basalt soils, at 

5 
 
8,000 feet, reported an average of 35 TPA (range of 13-59, and standard error = 4.7), and a basal 
area (BA) of 40.3 ft2/acre; and 2) The Sitgreaves study by Woolsey (1911) found an average of 
31 TPA, and a BA of 66.9 ft2/acre at an elevation of 6,300 feet on basalt soils. Studies on fire 
history exists within the BRFRP: a data set was collected on Castle Creek, and one on Thomas 
Creek, Apache National Forest (ANF) (Swetnam and Baisan 1996, Gottfried et al. 1999) in 
ponderosa pine forest type and an elevation of 8,000-8,200 feet. These studies had a MFI of 2.94 
(Thomas Creek) and 3.4 (Castle Creek) for all fire scar dates years (Swetnam and Baisan 1996). 
The frequent fire return interval within the BRFRP was within the range described by the 
regional studies. 
 
Understory 
Before European settlement, ponderosa pine forests were generally open stands with well-
developed herbaceous understories (Cooper 1960). Historical data regarding understory 
vegetation are insufficient in most southwestern ponderosa pine forests. However, multiple lines 
of evidence, including historical accounts, early photographs, soil phytolith studies, and remnant 
stands with uninterrupted fire, suggest historic ponderosa pine forests supported a robust 
community of grass, forbs, and shrubs (Beale 1858; Rusby 1889; Merriam 1890; Kerns 2001), 
with minimal pine regeneration (Bailey and Covington 1994). 
 
For effectiveness of treatment studies, ERI has a LEARN site with replicated treatments and 
controls on the ASNF that includes reconstructed reference conditions. Treatments include full 
restoration, burn-only, and control (Roccaforte et. al. 2014). Of the treatments tested in this 
study, the full treatment (densities to approximate reconstructed historic densities and prescribed 
burning) shifted forest structure, diameter distributions, and canopy fuel loadings to levels near 
or within historical reference conditions, the burn-only treatment did not. The study also 
indicated that higher elevation ponderosa pine sites were more degraded than lower elevation 
sites due to increased proportions of mesic species which may have implications for treatment 
prioritization. Literature reviews also cover the effects of fire suppression and livestock grazing 
on understory and herbaceous vegetation (Korb and Springer 2003) and effects of tree thinning 
and prescribed burning (Abella 2004). Generally, as the overstory density has increased, both 
total cover and species richness have decreased (Korb and Springer 2003). Abella (2009) 
reported that understory species richness was greater and plant cover was up to eight times 
greater in openings than under tree canopies in a ponderosa pine/Gambel oak forest (like those 
around Black River).   
 
Ponderosa Pine Forest Summary 
Based on the available literature, it is likely the general conditions of the historic frequent fire 
ponderosa pine stands within the BRFRP area were as follows: 
 
 TPA: 20-60, BA: 30-80. 
 Canopy cover: <30 percent. 
 Stand structure including high proportions of spatial aggregation, with tree clumps 
ranging in size from 0.01–0.75 acres, separated by grass, forb, and shrub interspaces that 
were maintained and regulated by frequent fire. 
 Frequent fire of return intervals between 3-10 years.

The natural range of variability is a “best” estimate of a resilient and functioning ecosystem 
because it reflects the evolutionary ecology (i.e., low intensity, frequent fire systems) of these 
forests.  
 
Dry Mixed-Conifer Forests (ERU = Mixed-Conifer Forest Frequent Fire) 
 
Forest Structure, Composition and Disturbance 
Warm/dry mixed-conifer is generally located at a higher elevation than ponderosa pine forests, 
but at the lower elevation of the mixed-conifer continuum. It is dominated by fire resistant 
ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir but also can include species adapted to mesic conditions such as 
white fir, aspen and sometimes southwestern white pine (Strahan et al. 2016). Data from 
dendroecological stand reconstructions and historical inventories of southwestern warm/dry 
mixed-conifer forests are more limited compared to southwestern ponderosa pine. However, 
studies-to-date indicate that tree densities of warm/dry mixed-conifer forests ranged from 21 to 
99 TPA while BA varied from 34 to 124 square feet per acre, prior to Euro-American settlement 
of the region (Stoddard 2011). Data from the Woolsey plots in the Sitgreaves National Forest, 
basalt soils, elevation 6,300 feet, (Woolsey 1911), had a mean TPA of 31 trees and a mean BA of 
70. The Stoddard (2011) compilation included a site in the Blue Mountains with an average TPA 
of 68.7 and a BA of 84.4 ft2/acre (Greenmayr 1913). Fulé et al. (2005) reconstructed forest 
structure for dry mixed-conifer forests on the San Francisco Peaks and found historic tree 
densities ranged from 43to 60 TPA and a BA of ~65-78 ft2/acre. Species composition and 
structural characteristics studies show ponderosa pine was a dominate species in terms of 
density; however Douglas fir, southwestern white pine, Gamble oak, aspen, and white fir are 
represented (Romme et al. 2009; Cocke et al. 2015; Strahan et al. 2016). Regeneration in 
southwestern mixed-conifer stands can be continuous at higher elevation, mesic sites; at lower 
sites, regeneration was episodic, dependent on favorable climate windows and fire-free locations 
(Cocke et al. 2015, Strahan et al. 2016). At a warm/dry mixed-conifer site in southern Colorado, 
Fulé et al. (2009) reported that prior to fire regime disruption, ponderosa pine trees comprised 
42-54 percent of the tree density and 54-68 percent of the stand BA, whereas in 2003 ponderosa 
pine was reduced to only 4-16 percent of the tree density and 27-46 percent of the BA. It is also 
important to note that many forests dominated by warm/dry mixed-conifer species today may 
have historically been ponderosa pine forests, but have in-filled with fire intolerant mixed-
conifer species (e.g., white fir) following fire exclusion (Moore et al. 2004). Finally, canopy 
cover is weakly correlated with BA. Using this method for dry mixed-conifer forests on the 
Uncompahgre Plateau in Colorado, Binkley et al. (2008) reported reference conditions for 
canopy cover ranging from 12.0-21.5 percent in areas that exhibit fine-scale aggregation. 
Fornwalt et al. (2002) modeled reference canopy cover conditions of 13-22 percent for dry 
mixed-conifer forests with fine-scale tree aggregation on the Colorado Front range. 
 
Although information about tree spatial patterns in dry-mixed-conifer is very limited, frequent 
fire in dry forest types is thought to promote fine-scale heterogeneity characterized by mosaics of 
openings, single trees, and groups of trees with interlocking crowns (Larson and Churchill 2012, 
Rodman et al. 2016). Based on reported studies, historical dry, mixed-conifer forests were 
structurally similar to ponderosa pine with respect to tree groups with small meadows between 
them (Binkley et al. 2008). 
 

7 
 
Fire history reconstructions based on dendroecological analysis of fire scared trees indicate that 
prior to the late 1800s, fires in warm/dry mixed-conifer forests of the Southwest were relatively 
frequent and low severity (Margolis and Swetnam 2013). Swetnam and Baisan (1996) provided a 
summary of tree ring studies conducted at 24 mixed-conifer sites in Arizona and New Mexico, 
and reported mean fire intervals (i.e., of spreading fires that scarred more than 10 percent of 
recording trees) that ranged from about 4-15 years for mixed-conifer sites dominated by 
ponderosa pine. Additional studies in southwestern Colorado found MFIs between 18 and 32 
years (Grissino-Mayer et al. 2004, Fulé et al. 2009). Fire scar records indicate that the frequent, 
low-severity fire regime in warm/dry mixed-conifer prevailed for more than four centuries prior 
to 1900 (Swetnam and Baisan 1996, Margolis and Balmat 2009). Because frequent fire was a 
key ecological process operating over very long time periods, elimination of fire led to critical 
changes in ecosystem structure and function, including increased tree densities, loss of grassy 
interspaces, and a shift in tree species toward shade tolerant species.  
 
A study on the Mogollon Rim (Black Mesa Ranger District) in a 2,800-acre, mixed-conifer forest 
landscape, at an elevation of  ~7,589–7,891 feet collected a composite analysis of cross-dated 
fire scars from 133 tree and found a mean fire interval of 2.0-8.5 years between 1670 and 1879 
(Huffman et al. 2015). Frequent fires halted abruptly after 1879. Mean point fire interval was 
11.8 years and ranged 2-61 years. Mean fire rotation was 14.4 years. The Weibull Median 
Probability Interval (WMPI) was 1.9 years and ranged from 1-7 years (Huffman et al. 2015). 
Understory. It is difficult to find studies that document historical understory composition and 
subsequent changes through time. The open historic forest structure, with frequent fire, does 
support a higher understory basal cover of grasses and forbs (Laughlin et al. 2006; Ahlgren and 
Ahlgren 1960; Ffolliott et al. 1977). 
 
Treatment effectiveness studies found that fuel reduction treatments implemented in areas 
burned by the Wallow Fire showed reduced fire severity effects, including lower overstory 
mortality, and smaller patch sizes of overstory mortality. Restoration and fuel reduction 
treatments may enhance ecosystem resiliency to uncharacteristically severe fire (Waltz et al 
2014).  
 
Warm/Dry Mixed-Conifer Forest Summary 
From regional and local studies, there is evidence that warm/dry mixed-conifer forests within the 
BRFRP were: 
 
 TPA: 20-60, BA: 30-100. 
 Canopy cover: <30 percent. 
 MFIs found as frequent as 12 years and as high as 32 years.

Wallow Fire and Restoration Needs Post-Fire 
 
In 2012, ERI did an assessment of restoration needs across the ASNF, including the footprint of 
the Wallow Fire (Crouse and Waltz 2012). The Wallow Fire in 2011 impacted more than 
500,000 acres of ASNF lands, but with burn intensities and severities ranging for no burn to high 
severity. Rather than assume there were no restoration needs within the fire perimeter, ERI 
incorporated the Wallow Fire in the analysis, utilizing the Rapid Assessment of Vegetation 
Condition (RAVG) after wildfire information. The initial restoration opportunity areas were 
developed with the Mid-Scale Existing Vegetation data layer (Region 3, Brohman and Bryant 
2005) and used series of criteria to 
identify stands that had the potential to in 
need of restoration. The first criteria was 
defined as being a dry conifer forest type 
having a canopy cover greater than 30 
percent and with average stand tree 
diameters <20 inches diameter at breast 
height (dbh). The dry conifer forest types 
selected from the mid-scale data included 
ponderosa-pine mix, ponderosa pine-
evergreen oak mix, and Douglas-fir 
(please see Crouse and Waltz 2012 for 
full criteria). Within the Wallow Fire, 
these data layers were further qualified by 
RAVG data where dominant vegetation 
experienced ≤50 percent BA mortality. 
There were more than 50,000 acres within 
the BRFRP found to fit priority 
restoration criteria (Figure 3). Note, 
although Figure 3 overlays this analysis 
on the ERUs, the data layers used to 
construct the restoration needs are 
different from the ERU data layers. 
 
 
Planning Overview 
 
Forest Service Manual (FSM) 2020 – Ecological Restoration and Resilience Policy 
The newly released (effective May 27, 2016) FSM 2020 directive provides guidance for 
reestablishing and retaining resilience of National Forest System lands and resources to achieve 
sustainable management, and provide a broad range of ecosystem services through restoration 
activities. With respect to utilizing reference conditions and NRV, this policy states:  
 
In order to construct a desired future condition for an area, one should assess 
past and current conditions as well as how these conditions may change into the 
future. Ecological restoration focuses on reestablishing the composition, 
structure, pattern, and ecological processes necessary to facilitate terrestrial and 

9 
 
aquatic ecosystem sustainability, resilience, and health under current and future 
conditions. Assessing current and potential future conditions should result in a 
detailed description of the composition, structure, pattern, and ecological 
processes of the ecosystem as it moves along an ecological trajectory through 
time. 
 
The desired future condition of an ecosystem should be informed by an 
assessment of spatial and temporal variation in ecosystem characteristics under 
historic disturbance regimes during a specified reference period. The spatial and 
temporal variation of characteristics in the specified reference period is often 
called the natural range of variation (NRV). The NRV should be used to inform an 
understanding of ecosystem function and biophysical capability, the dynamic 
nature of ecosystems associated natural and current disturbance regimes, and 
potential responses to future environments resulting from climate change and 
increasing human uses. The NRV does not define a management target or desired 
condition; it provides context for understanding ecological integrity.  
 
Ecological restoration typically focuses on recreating the ecosystem conditions 
that were present prior to European influences. However, some ecosystems may 
have been altered to such an extent that reestablishing pre-European conditions 
may be ecologically or economically infeasible. In such circumstances, 
management goals and activities should create functioning ecosystems in the 
context of changing conditions through the process called functional restoration. 
(FSM 2020, 2016) 
 
The policy emphasizes that forest supervisors and district rangers are responsible for project 
development and approval to reestablish and retain ecological resilience of National Forest 
System lands and resources to achieve sustainable management and provide a broad range of 
ecosystem services that are consistent with regional and national policy. Also, the final policy 
acknowledges that when an ecosystem has been degraded such that it is impossible or 
impractical to return conditions to those within the NRV, or that the projected environmental 
conditions will not support returning an ecosystem to within the NRV, that functional restoration 
may be appropriate to restore ecological processes but achieve the essential functions of the 
ecosystem with different species composition and structure than pre-European settlement 
conditions. The Forest Service handbook defines NRV as “a tool for assessing the ecological 
integrity” and that it “does not necessarily constitute a management target or desired condition” 
(FSM 2020.5, citing the planning handbook at FSH 1909.12, zero code, section 05). 
Consequently, management actions that are consistent with the inherent capability of the 
planning area are the best approach to restoring ecological integrity. 
 
Relationship Between Natural Range of Variability and the Apache-
Sitgreaves National Forests’ Revised Land Management Plan 
There is a strong correlation between the new ASNF Forest Plan direction and what research has 
shown about NRV as it relates to both ponderosa pine and warm/dry mixed-conifer forest types 
within the BRFRP area. In summary, the new plan advocates: 
 

10 
 
 
 Ponderosa pine forests: 
o The larger portion (60 percent or greater) of the soil cover is composed of grasses 
and forbs as opposed to needles and leaves. 
o Interspaces range from 10-70 percent. 
o Tree density within forested areas ranges from 20-80 square feet of BA per acre. 
o The forest arrangement consists of individual trees, small clumps, and groups of 
trees with variably sized interspaces of grasses, forbs, and shrubs (vegetation 
associations are similar to reference conditions). 
o Tree groups are typically less than 1 acre (average 0.5 acre), with mid- to old-
aged tree groups containing 2-40 trees (note: tree group size is somewhat larger 
than what NRV data would suggest for the Black River project).  
o Frequent, low-severity fires (fire regime I), occurring approximately every 2-17 
years 
 Warm/dry mixed-conifer forests:  
o The larger portion (60 percent or greater) of the soil cover is composed of grasses 
and forbs as opposed to needles and leaves. 
o Interspaces typically range from 10-50 percent. 
o Tree density within forested areas ranges from 30-100 square feet of BA per acre. 
o Tree groups are typically less than 5 acres, but often less than 1 acre (note: tree 
group size is somewhat larger than what NRV data would suggest for the Black 
River project), with mid- to old-aged tree groups containing 2-50 trees. 
o Frequent, low to mixed-severity fires (fire regime I), occurring every 10-22 years  
 Uneven-aged management.   
 
This direction can be tailored to, and supported by, the information on NRV presented in this 
document. 
 
Conclusion 
Assessing BASI for forest structural conditions within the BRFRP provided both regional and 
local data sets to inform the NRV within the project area. Forest Service direction at national and 
forest unit levels emphasizes the role of NRV in crafting desired conditions toward a resilient 
and functioning ecosystem. The NRV, and the current departure of forest structure from the 
NRV, should be a baseline of data for any project planning effort. The ERI recognizes that other 
forest management goals and resource needs can further inform the desired conditions. There 
may be project desired conditions that can only be met with forest structural conditions outside 
the range of NRV. Understanding where that occurs on the landscape, and assessing the tradeoffs 
for long-term ecosystem resilience and sustainability, can help inform any additional priority 
management needs, such as fire protection. 
 
The literature summaries of ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer reference conditions fit well 
within the ASNF LMP’s management goals.  
 
Ponderosa Pine Forest Summary 
Based on the available literature, it is likely the general conditions of the historic frequent-fire 
ponderosa pine stands within the BRFRP area were as follows: 

11 
 
 TPA: 20-60, BA: 30-80. 
 Canopy cover: <30 percent. 
 Stand structure including high proportions of spatial aggregation, with tree clumps 
ranging in size from 0.01–0.75 acres, separated by grass, forb, shrub, interspaces that 
were maintained and regulated by frequent fire. 
 Frequent fire of return intervals between 3-10 years.   
 
Warm/Dry Mixed-Conifer Forest Summary 
From regional and local studies, there is evidence that warm/dry mixed-conifer forests within the 
BRFRP were: 
 
 TPA: 20-60, BA: 30-100. 
 Canopy cover: <30 percent. 
 MFIs found as frequent as 12 years and as high as 32 years.
