How resilient are southwestern ponderosa pine
forests after crown fires?
Melissa Savage and Joy Nystrom Mast
Abstract: The exclusion of low-severity surface fire from ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson) forests of
the Southwest has changed ecosystem structure and function such that severe crown fires are increasingly causing ex-
tensive stand mortality. This altered fire regime has resulted from the intersection of natural drought cycles with human
activities that have suppressed natural fires for over a century. What is the trajectory of forest recovery after such fires?
This study explores the regeneration response of ponderosa pine and other species to crown fires that occurred in the
region from the late 1940s to the mid-1970s. We address two main questions: (1) What is the success of ponderosa re-
generation and establishment, and (2) Can these sites, burned in stand-destroying fires, be “captured” by other species
on the scale of decades? Two main trajectories of recovery were found: (1) establishment of unnaturally dense ponder-
osa pine stands vulnerable to further crown fire and (2) establishment of nonforested grass or shrub communities.
Résumé : L’exclusion des feux de surface peu sévères dans les forêts de pin ponderosa (Pinus ponderosa P. & C.
Lawson) du Sud-Ouest a modifié les fonctions et la structure de l’écosystème de telle sorte que des feux de cime sévè-
res causent de la mortalité de plus en plus importante parmi les peuplements. Cette modification du régime de feu est
le résultat combiné des cycles naturels de sécheresse et de l’activité humaine qui a supprimé les feux d’origine natu-
relle depuis plus d’un siècle. Quelle est la trajectoire de la récupération de la forêt après de tels feux? Cette étude ex-
plore la réaction de la régénération de pin ponderosa et des autres espèces aux feux de cime qui sont survenus dans la
région entre la fin des années 1940 et le milieu des années 1970. Les auteurs ont examiné deux questions principales :
(1) Quel est le taux de succès de la régénération et de l’établissement du pin ponderosa? (2) Est-ce que ces sites, une
fois brûlés par des feux qui détruisent le peuplement, peuvent être envahis par d’autres espèces après plusieurs décen-
nies? Ils ont observé deux voies principales de récupération : (1) l’établissement de peuplements artificiellement clair-
semés de pin ponderosa vulnérables à d’éventuels feux de cime et (2) l’établissement de communautés non forestières
d’herbacées et d’arbustes.

Introduction
What happens to forest ecosystems when key natural pro-
cesses, such as disturbance regimes, are drastically deflected
by human impacts? In southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus
ponderosa P. & C. Lawson) forests, a century or more of do-
mestic grazing, logging, and fire suppression has altered the
fire regime from one of frequent, low-impact surface fires to
one of severe crown fires that cause extensive stand mortal-
ity. If history matters in the development of natural systems
(Ricklefs 1987), how is the alteration of this key process
changing the patterns and dynamics of the regional ponder-
osa pine forest? That is, how resilient is this system to a hu-
man-induced fire regime that is markedly outside the range
of natural variability?
The concept of range of natural variability (RNV) refers
to the spectrum of conditions characterizing dynamic sys-
tems over time and space (Morgan et al. 1994; Landres et al.
1999). RNV can provide a benchmark against which human
alterations in dynamic systems can be evaluated (Stephenson
1999). In southwestern ponderosa pine forests, RNV prior to
fire suppression has been extensively reconstructed using
historical records, dendrochronology, stand reconstruction,
and relict stands (e.g., Swetnam and Baisan 1996; Fulé et al.
1997; Mast et al. 1999; Covington 2003). For at least 300–
500 years prior to the late 19th century, a regime of high-
frequency, low-intensity fires prevailed (with return intervals
of approx. 2–20 years), while low-frequency, high-intensity
crown fires were rare or nonexistent (Swetnam and Baisan
1996). An evolutionary environment of frequent, low-intensity
fire promoted adaptive traits such as thick bark, rapid seed-
ling growth, longevity, resinous needles, and flammable lit-
ter (Agee 1998). Surface fires thinned seedlings, left the
overstory largely intact, and in most areas resulted in rela-
tively open stands of uneven-aged ponderosa pine. While the
timing varied somewhat from place to place, the rapid onset
of intensive livestock grazing in the late 19th century, fol-
lowed soon after by active fire suppression efforts, brought
an abrupt end to the surface-fire regime throughout the re-
gional forest (Swetnam and Baisan 1996).
The large-scale shift to stand-destroying fires in south-
western ponderosa pine forests over the past century tracks a
marked shift toward unprecedented increases in small-tree
density, surface fuels, and landscape connectivity caused by

human activities (e.g., Weaver 1951; Covington and Moore
1994a; Swetnam et al. 1999). Fire suppression, grazing, and
other activities created heavy ladder fuels that now conduct
fires into the canopy and burn hotly enough to cause large
areas of near-complete tree mortality. Stand-destroying fires,
historically rare in these forests, are now increasing in size
(e.g., Swetnam 1990; Covington et al. 1997). Prior to the
1960s, a 20-ha crown fire was considered large (Friederici
2003), whereas in recent years single crown-fire events have
burned thousands of hectares (Dahm and Geils 1997;
Swetnam and Betancourt 1998).
Climate trends affect the severity, extent, and synchrony
of fires in southwestern forests (Swetnam and Betancourt
1992,1998). The phenomena of stand-destroying fires first
manifested in the region a half century or so ago (Swetnam
1990; Covington and Moore 1994b) when decades of
anthropogenic fuel accumulation intersected with the regional
drought of the 1950s, which prevailed for varying time peri-
ods and severity in different areas. Local climatic conditions
also influence recovery from fire, since ponderosa pine re-
generation and establishment has been shown to be sensitive
to specific precipitation and temperature patterns (Savage et
al. 1996).
Relatively short-term effects of recent severe fires have
been investigated (e.g., Foxx 1996; Allen 1996; Crawford et
al. 2001), but we have little understanding of the longer term
effects of such fires on forest demography and structure.
Here we study vegetation recovery at 10 sites across the
Southwest where crown fires burned from the late 1940s to
the 1970s, to investigate ponderosa pine forest resilience to
such fires. We use the term “recovery” to refer to the trajec-
tory of the establishment of vegetation after fire and not to
the recovery of a forest similar to prefire or RNV structures.
In addition, we use Holling’s (1973) definition of resilience
as “the degree to which a system can absorb disturbance —
kind, rate and intensity — before it shifts into a fundamen-
tally different behavior”. Specifically, we ask the question,
Are stand-destroying crown-fire burn sites recovering to the
ponderosa pine forest type on the decadal scale?
It has been suggested that natural communities can exist
in alternative states (e.g., May 1977; Van de Koopel 2001).
Alternative states are defined by Sutherland (1974) as the
persistence of one of several potential sets of coexisting spe-
cies with relatively similar abundances for some period of
time. In ecological terms, this phenomenon is consistent with
the “inhibition model” proposed by Connell and Slatyer
(1977), where a species assemblage captures a site for some
period of time without a successional trend. Varying initial
conditions and the spatial scale of a disturbance (Gilpin and
Case 1976) can result in different trajectories of community
development. Petraitis and Latham (1999) describe the
mechanism pushing a system into another state (sensu Moir
and Mowrer 1995) as a “switch”. Here we consider alterna-
tive states to include those of structure as well as composi-
tion, and we ask whether anomalous crown fires are driving
these forests past a critical threshold into new states via the
“switch” of a novel disturbance regime.
The study used a natural experiment and thus lacked ex-
perimental control. There are numerous uncertainties related
to variance in site factors, prefire stand structure, and
postfire management history that reduce site comparability
and constrain interpretation of results. Moreover, a set of
only 10 fires scattered across a broad region constrains our
conclusions. Our intention is not to analyze the causes of
variation in regeneration pathways at different sites. Instead,
we attempt a broad-brush portrait of forest recovery at crown-
fire burn sites across the regional landscape.
Materials and methods
Study sites
We sampled woody species recruitment at 10 sites in the
Southwest where ponderosa pine forests burned in crown
fires that occurred from 1948 to 1977. Sites were selected
from the relatively small set of old crown fires provided by
the nine national forests in the Southwest and were consid-
ered suitable if they (1) were surrounded by mature, near-
monotypic ponderosa pine forest, (2) were located centrally
in the ponderosa pine range, and (3) had documentation on
fire location, size, and behavior. In all cases, burn sites were
clearly demarcated from surrounding relict stands by a visi-
ble contrast in stand structure. Sites were on gentle to mod-
erate slopes (<8° for most sites; range 2°–14°) (Table 1).
The elevation range of the sites was <600 m (Table 1).
Burn sites were located throughout the regional forest,
across the Mogollon Rim in Arizona, and in northern and
southern New Mexico (Fig. 1). Forests with a dominant pon-
derosa pine overstory occur from 2150 to 3000 m under a
similar climate regime. Mean annual temperature ranges
from 5 to 7 °C, and mean annual precipitation ranges from
520 to 660 mm depending on latitude and elevation (Moir et
al. 1997). Climate variation is reflected in shifts in associ-
ated understory vegetation. Shrubs tend to be widely and ir-
regularly spaced (Howard 2003). In the more xerophytic sites,
broadleaf evergreen species predominate in the understory,
and at the lowest elevations woody species occur from ad-
joining pinyon–juniper woodlands (primarily Pinus edulis
and Juniperus spp.). In the more mesophytic zones at higher
elevation, the ponderosa pine forest grades into mixed-conifer
forest with few understory shrubs and a grassy understory of
Festuca arizonica and Muhlenbergia montana.
The burn sites studied vary by factors such as time since
burn, environmental traits, postfire climatic conditions, and
postfire manipulations (Table 1) and thus are not compara-
ble. Prefire forest structure and compositional characteris-
tics, which we have been unable to document, may also have
influenced both the nature of the fire and the vegetation that
established afterward. We assume frequent fires ceased at
the study sites around the same time as the synchronous re-
gional decline in the late 19th century (Swetnam and Baisan
1996).
Vegetation sampling
At each burn site, tree and shrub structure, herbaceous
cover, and slope were sampled in 2001 or 2002. The sam-
pling design consisted of a series of five 1 km long parallel
transects at each burn site, spaced 500 m apart, and located
centrally in the burn. At 200-m intervals along each transect,
a 10 m × 10 m plot was established, for a total of 30 plots
per site. Within each plot, we recorded diameter and species
of adult trees (≥1.4 cm in height and diameter at breast
height (dbh) ≥6 cm), counted the number of saplings (≥1.4 m

in height but dbh <6 cm), seedlings (<1.4 m in height), and
shrub stems, and measured the slope. We estimated percent
understory cover separately for herbaceous and graminoid
plants in five randomly located 1-m2 plots within each
10 m × 10 m plot, for a total of 150 plots per site. Nomen-
clature follows Vines (1960).
We took an increment core at 0.3 m height from every
adult tree in the larger plots to broadly estimate establish-

ment dates of trees in the burns. Cores were prepared ac-
cording to standard procedures (Stokes and Smiley 1968).
Tree rings were counted, visually cross-dated, and reported
in histograms as an estimate of age at coring height. Where
the sample did not intercept the pith, years from innermost
ring to the pith were estimated with a pith locator (concen-
tric circles matched to the approximate curvature and den-
sity of the remaining inner rings) (Applequist 1958).
Because of significant differences in postcrown fire surface
conditions for growth as compared to within forest condi-
tions, we do not correct for growth to corning height for age
calculation.
Historical records
Information about the land-use history of burn sites was
collected from maps and documents in Forest Service re-
cords, such as fire incidence reports, and newspaper reports.
Records included data on fire location, date, and size (Ta-
ble 1). In most instances, other documentation about early
fires had been discarded, and oral history replaced quantified
information on preburn stand structure and postburn treat-
ments such as levels of tree planting, salvage logging, live-
stock grazing, and seeding with grasses. The lack of quantified
information on these important factors compromises an ex-
planation of vegetative recovery after crown fires. Old crown
fires with more reliable historical documentation, generally
speaking, do not exist. We view this study as a first step in
characterizing the trajectory of vegetative change after crown
fires in anticipation of an investigation of the successional
mechanisms of recovery.
Results
Ponderosa pine forest reestablished across five of the postburn
sites. Of the remaining sites, ponderosa pine trees coexist
with large areas of shrubfields on two other sites and with
meadow on another site. Meadows dominate the remaining
two sites.
Woody-species density and structure
Forest
At five sites, a dense ponderosa pine forest has established
or is establishing. Ponderosa pine densities range from mod-
erately dense to very dense (Table 2). This includes sites
that were planted with ponderosa pine seedlings and those
that were not (Table 1), those with ongoing regeneration,
and those with little continued establishment (Table 3). Pon-
derosa pine densities are high at Escudilla (616 adults·ha–1,
750 saplings·ha–1, 247 seedlings·ha–1), Ocate (443 adults·ha–1,
467 saplings·ha–1, 687 seedlings·ha–1), Black River (600
adults·ha–1, 1033 saplings·ha–1, 687 seedlings·ha–1), and Bull
Flat (836 adults·ha–1, 4212 saplings·ha–1, 2864 seedlings·ha–1)
(Table 3). The number of saplings and seedlings at these
sites often equal or exceed the number of adults. At Fort
Valley, a notably lower density forest has established (183
adults·ha–1, 23 saplings·ha–1, 27 seedlings·ha–1).
Mixed forest and shrubfields
At two sites, ponderosa pine stands are interspersed with
shrubfields. At Circle Cross, a low level of ponderosa pine re-
generation (40 adults·ha–1, 10 saplings·ha–1, 63 seedlings·ha–1)
coexists with highly dense Quercus grisia (grey oak) and
Quercus gambelii (Gambel oak) shrub thickets and a low
density of other tree species (Table 3). Faught Ridge is
characterized by robust ponderosa pine regeneration (417
adults·ha–1, 267 saplings·ha–1, 180 seedlings·ha–1) on ridgetops.
However, large swaths of the site are covered exclusively by
dense Arctostaphylos pungens (manzanita) thickets and com-
pletely lack ponderosa pine regeneration (Table 3). Fourteen
of 30 plots (47%) at Circle Cross and 8 of 30 plots (27%) at
Faught Ridge lacked adult trees.
Mixed forest and meadow
Mean density values of ponderosa pine are much lower at
La Mesa (97 adults·ha–1, 240 saplings·ha–1, and 140 seed-
lings·ha–1), the most recent burn (1977). Dense stands of
ponderosa pine trees occur near seed sources at the edges of
the burn. Fifteen of 30 plots (50%) are dominated by meadow
and lack pine trees.
Meadow
Two sites, A1 Mountain and Slaughter Mesa, are domi-
nated by meadow communities (Table 2). At both sites, a
ground cover comprised primarily of grass species is corre-
lated with low levels and very low levels, respectively, of
ponderosa pine regeneration (A1 Mountain: 77 adults·ha–1,

Table 3. Mean density of woody species per hectare in 10 crown fire sites.

7 saplings·ha–1, 2 seedlings·ha–1; Slaughter Mesa: 20 adults,
83 saplings, 117 seedlings ha–1). Many plots at both sites
contain only grasses: 67% (21 of 30) of the A1 Mountain
and 80% (24 of 30) of the Slaughter Mesa plots lack trees.
The domination by grass species at these sites is reflected in
the concentration of regeneration of ponderosa pines near
meadow edges, close to seed sources.
Understory cover
Understory cover ranges widely (3%–54%) across the 10
sites (Table 2). Forb cover is <5% at over half the sites and
<12% at all sites. Grass cover ranges from 2% to 47%.
Grass cover values are predictably highest at sites dominated
by meadow, including A1 Mountain (35%) and Slaughter
Mesa (47%). Grass cover values are lowest in sites with
dense shrub populations, including Circle Cross (3%) and
Faught Ridge (2%), and relatively low at sites with dense
tree populations, including Bull Flat (5%), Black River (10%),
and Escudilla (19%).
Tree size
Ponderosa pine trees at most sites are small, with a mean
dbh of 16 cm or less (Table 2). Mean dbh values at Slaugh-
ter Mesa (21 cm; range 8–34 cm), Fort Valley (22 cm; range
7–41 cm), and A1 Mountain (28 cm; range 9–40 cm) are
larger, yet still relatively small. Mean ponderosa pine basal
area values are also low, ranging from 0.8 to 11.4 m2·ha–1
(Table 2). Neither mean dbh nor stand basal area for ponder-
osa pine trees shows a linear trend associated with time
since burn.
Other tree species
At most sites, ponderosa pine was the most abundant of
any tree species. All adult trees at A1 Mountain, Fort Valley,
La Mesa, Slaughter Mesa and 96% at Bull Flat are ponder-
osa pine trees. Lower percentages of adult ponderosa pine
trees (72% at Faught Ridge, 63% at Ocate, 55% at Black
River, 51% at Escudilla, and only 22% at Circle Cross) re-
flect the degree of success of other tree species in establish-
ing postburn (Table 3). These species include primarily those
that commonly occur in low numbers in ponderosa pine
dominated forests, for example, Populus tremuloides, Pinus
edulis, Quercus spp., and Juniperus spp. A higher proportion
of mixed-conifer forest species, specifically Abies concolor
(white fir) and Populus tremuloides, occur at higher eleva-
tion (approx. 2900 m) burn sites that regenerated to forest,
such as at Escudilla and Ocate. Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas-
fir) occurs at mid-elevation (approx. 2600 m) burn sites that
regenerated to forest or shrubfield, such as Black River, Bull
Flats, and Circle Cross.
Tree establishment dates
A total of 1119 trees (922 of which were ponderosa pine)
were aged to pith at coring height. Because we do not cor-
rect for growth to coring height for age, the actual dates of
establishment precede the dates reflected in Fig. 2. In north-
ern Arizona, 2–7 years is considered typical for ponderosa
pine seedling for growth to our coring height of 0.3 m
(Sackett 1984). While there is an inherent uncertainty, we
conservatively estimate up to 5–10 years for the number of
years of growth to coring height, or less where postfire re-
generation conditions were favorable. A shift backward in
time of establishment dates on this order is consonant with
the time since fire. Recruitment of ponderosa pine trees ap-
pears to commence soon after fires, even at those sites with
little overall regeneration (Fig. 2). It also appears that at
many sites, if establishment dates are shifted back in time up
to a decade, there was an abundance of regeneration that be-
gan during the years of the 1950s drought and which sur-
vived for many decades (Fig. 2).
At many sites, fires were severe enough to cause virtually
complete mortality, although there may have been some un-
authorized removal of live trees by salvage logging. Fort
Valley, A1 Mountain, and La Mesa had no living remnant
trees in the burn. Numbers of living remnant ponderosa pine
trees are low at half the sites: Slaughter Mesa (3 trees·ha–1),
with a median date of establishment (mde) of 1954; Black
River (10 trees·ha–1; mde = 1885), Escudilla (53 trees·ha–1;
mde = 1939), Circle Cross (40 trees·ha–1; mde = 1940), and
Ocate (33 trees·ha–1; mde = 1949). At the remaining sites,
200 ponderosa pine trees·ha–1 survived the fire at Faught
Ridge (mde = 1940) and 273 trees·ha–1 at Bull Flat (mde =
1962). Patches of trees often survive intense fires because of
the mosaic of intensities characteristic of most wildfires (Turner
et al. 1989; Fulé et al. 2002). Virtually all of these ponderosa

pine trees germinated in the 20th century, providing post-
burn seed sources.
The vast majority of tree species other than ponderosa
pine appear to have regenerated after the fires: one third of
the Populus tremuloides at Ocate (67 trees·ha–1, mean pith
date = 1956, SEM = 2), all the Abies concolor at Ocate (37
trees·ha–1, mean pith date = 1976, SEM = 1), all Populus
tremuloides at Escudilla (300 trees·ha–1, fire date = 1951,
mean pith date = 1956, SEM = 0.5), and all Quercus gambelii
at Circle Cross (43 trees·ha–1, fire date = 1954, mean pitch
date = 1957, SEM = 3). Both Populus and Quercus resprout,
which accounts for the short postburn establishment dates.
Discussion
Two general trajectories of recovery emerged in the de-
cades after stand-destroying crown fire at these sites: (1) a
robust recovery to ponderosa pine forest, with densities in
excess of ranges of natural variability, or (2) a deflection of
forest recovery toward another vegetation state.

Multiple lines of evidence have been used to construct a
general consensus on RNV for prefire-suppression south-
western ponderosa pine forest structures, including early his-
torical accounts (e.g., Beale 1858; Lang and Stewart 1910),
historical photographs (e.g., Fulé et al. 2002), early forest in-
ventories (Lang and Stewart 1910; Woolsey 1911), and
dendrochronological reconstructions (e.g., White 1985; Fulé
et al. 1997; Mast et al. 1999). These studies and accounts
tend to converge on a characterization of typical prefire sup-
pression forest structure that was open and park-like with
relatively low tree densities. For example, Woolsey (1911)
conducted a census of ponderosa pine at nine sites in the re-
gion and found a mean of 88 trees·ha–1 with a dbh > 10.2 cm
(ranging from 57 to 141 trees·ha–1). In specific survey sites
in New Mexico, ponderosa pine densities with dbh > 10.2 cm
averaged 36 trees·ha–1 in north central New Mexico; 23
trees·ha–1 in western New Mexico; 47 trees ha–1 in south-
eastern New Mexico; 57 and 38 trees·ha–1 in northeastern
New Mexico, and 116 and 131 trees·ha–1 in west central
New Mexico (Woolsey 1911). Similar surveys by Lang and
Stewart (1910) on the Kaibab Plateau reported a mean stand
density of 128 trees·ha–1 for ponderosa pine trees with dbh >
15.2 cm in northern Arizona on the Kaibab Plateau.
Stand structure reconstructions of prefire-suppression pon-
derosa pine forests found comparable densities in northern
Arizona ponderosa pine forests, for example, 37 trees·ha–1
(White 1985), 86 and 111 trees·ha–1 (Cooper 1960), 43
trees·ha–1 and 61 trees·ha–1 (Covington and Moore 1994a),
23 and 56 trees·ha–1 (Covington and Moore 1994b), 65
trees·ha–1 (Fulé et al. 1997), and 60 trees·ha–1 (Mast et al.
1999). The relevance of structural values reconstructed from
historical forests should be tempered by the knowledge that
contemporary climate conditions may provide a significantly
different context for regeneration (Fulé et al. 2002).
This study reports far higher mean densities on many sites
that reforested after crown fires than these RNV values. For
most sites, minimum density values exceed the mean histori-
cal density values found in reconstructions. We recalculated
mean densities of ponderosa pine trees at our forested sites
using a criterion of dbh >10.2 cm to directly compare our
data with Woolsey’s data: Faught Ridge (mean 280 trees·ha–1;
standard error of the mean, SEM = 69), Black River (233
trees·ha–1; SEM = 55), Ocate (320 trees·ha–1; SEM = 57),
Bull Flat (470 trees·ha–1; SEM = 79), and Escudilla (450
trees·ha–1; SEM = 62). These density values are three to five
times greater than the Woolsey mean density value for a set
of sites with 88 trees·ha–1.
Extreme densities of adults and saplings at the reforested
sites make these stands vulnerable to crown fire (Covington
et al. 1997). Clearly the densest stands, such as at Bull Flat,
with over 5000 adults and saplings·ha–1, and Black River,
with over 1600 adults and saplings·ha–1 (Table 3), are un-
likely to escape a crown fire in the near future. Other sites
vulnerable to crown fire include Escudilla (1366 adults and
saplings·ha–1) and Ocate (910 adults and saplings·ha–1), as
well as stands where ponderosa pine populations are spa-
tially crowded, for example, Faught Ridge (684 adults and
saplings·ha–1) and La Mesa (337 adults and saplings·ha–1).
Of the sites which recovered to ponderosa pine forest, only
Fort Valley may not currently be vulnerable to crown fire be-
cause of its notably lower density, especially of saplings
(183 adults·ha–1 and 23 saplings·ha–1). The density values of
these reforested postcrown fire sites are comparable to con-
temporary stands where fire has been excluded since the end
of the 19th century (e.g., Cooper 1960; White 1985; Cov-
ington and Moore 1994a; Fulé et al. 1997). In these forests,
which have not burned since fire suppression, density can
exceed presuppression values by an order of magnitude, for
example, 3097 trees·ha–1 (Covington et al. 1997) and 2103
trees·ha–1 (Covington and Moore 1994b).
There seems to be little evidence of self-thinning in his-
torical southwestern ponderosa pine forests (Biondi et al.
1994), nor would it have been adaptive under a low-intensity
fire regime. Self-thinning has not occurred to any extent in
the regional 1919 cohort, which survives as thickets of sup-
pressed individuals and provides large amounts of ladder
fuel (Covington and Moore 1994b; Savage et al. 1996). In
some cases, prescribed fires have been used to thin stands,
but their use is limited because of the challenges of burning
in high-density stands (Sackett et al. 1996; Mast 2003; Fulé
et al. 2004).
At the remaining study sites, recovery after crown fire was
deflected entirely or partially to another vegetation type. At
these sites, density values of ponderosa pine trees with
≥6 cm dbh are relatively low: densities were 77 trees·ha–1 at
A1 Mountain, 33 trees·ha–1 at Circle Cross, and 17 trees·ha–1
at Slaughter Mesa. Species other than ponderosa pine are
successful in occupying large parts of the site or even largely
excluding ponderosa pine trees. At the sites dominated by
grasses, one (A1 Mountain) has yet to yield to tree regenera-
tion, while the second (Slaughter Mesa) shows a very slow
trend toward ponderosa pine regeneration. Circle Cross is
dominated by a shrub community, with a slow trend toward
ponderosa pine regeneration. Both shrubs and grasses effec-
tively compete or present allelopathic problems for ponder-
osa pine seedlings (Harrington 1981). A reburn may favor
resprouting grass and shrub species and set back ponderosa
pine seedling and sapling establishment. Barton (2002) doc-
uments such a conversion of a different species of pine for-
ests to oak woodlands caused by intense fires in southern
Arizona.
The herbaceous understory at the study sites is sparse.
Even at the two sites dominated by meadow, A1 Mountain
and Slaughter Mesa, understory plant cover is still low rela-
tive to the >60% cover that Moir and Dieterich (1988) sug-
gest as a generality for full-meadow sites in the region.
Studies have found that high-intensity fires in the ponderosa
pine system can be implicated in the decline of native grasses,
perhaps through negative impacts on duff layer and soil seed-
bed (Griffis et al. 2001; Crawford et al. 2001) and suggest
that understory cover can remain sparse for decades after se-
vere fire. Without data on prefire understory cover or soil
type, however, we cannot assess the degree of recovery in
understory vegetation at these sites.
A tendency for succession to vulnerable states is illus-
trated by a model of hypothetical transitions for ponderosa
pine forest (Fig. 3). Stands that recover from stand-
destroying fires into dense, or what may be considered
hyper-dense, ponderosa pine forests may then follow a path-
way of repeated crown fire, with similar outcomes, cycling
on this pathway indefinitely or until the seed source is ex-
hausted. Stands dominated by Quercus or Arctostaphylos

shrubfields, such as Circle Cross and parts of Faught Ridge,
may also experience fires whose intensity would tend to
reinforce this pathway. Similarly, grass-dominated sites,
such as A1 and Slaughter Mesa, could be self-perpetuating if
they continue to exclude ponderosa pine regeneration. Such
successional pathways have not been reconstructed in pre-
suppression ponderosa pine forests. Preburn vegetation com-
position and structure clearly play a significant role in the
specifics of rate and kind of recovery, and the lack of such
information for our study sites hampers an analysis of the
fate of these stands. In the absence of another stand-
destroying fire, it is unclear how further successional dy-
namics will play out in these unnatural stands.
Land-use factors
The current state of the vegetation at these sites reflects
postburn management history, such as tree planting, salvage
logging, seeding, and livestock grazing (Table 1), which pre-
clude an explanation of recovery after burns. A program of
tree planting was instituted at four sites: Slaughter Mesa,
where planting failed entirely; Black River and Bull Flat,
where survivors became part of a large, natural cohort; and
Fort Valley, where visible rows of adults indicate that plant-
ing succeeded where natural regeneration did not. Establish-
ment dates from cored trees are not precise enough to allow
discrimination between natural regeneration and successful
planting of ponderosa pine trees for Black River and Bull
Flats. In addition, seeding with grasses was implemented at
six sites, but with major uncertainties in the timing and
amount of seeding.
Livestock grazing and salvage logging occurred at all burn
sites except La Mesa. Records of intensity and continuity of
grazing were poor and were generally described qualitatively
as “intermittent” or “seasonal”. Browsing impacts include
impacts on vegetation, soil damage, and increased erosion
rates (Beschta et al. 2004). Salvage logging of the dead
overstory causes soil compaction and accelerated rates of
soil erosion and removes structural components important
for ecosystem recovery (Beschta et al. 2004). Control sites
and quantitative documentation would be needed on a site-
by-site basis to explore the influence of these activities on
postfire recovery.
Climate factors
Recovery of vegetation is influenced by postfire climatic
conditions. Some crown-fire burns studied here occurred
during the most extreme drought in the southern United
States in the past 300 years (Stahle and Cleaveland 1988;
Meko et al. 1993) (Fig. 4). Tree-ring climate reconstructions
in central western New Mexico indicate a severe event from
1945 to 1958 (Grissino-Mayer 1996). This reconstruction re-
flected a significant correlation with 25 other archaeological
tree-ring chronologies in the Southwest, indicating a re-
gional drought. The 1950s drought, however, varied in inten-
sity and length from place to place in the Southwest. For
example, little climatic fluctuation was recorded in tree rings
during this period in northern Arizona (Biondi 1998; Salzer
2000).
The 1950s drought might have been expected to constrain
ponderosa pine regeneration in those parts of the region
where it was severe. Six of the crown fires sites studied oc-
curred during this drought: in 1948 (Fort Valley), 1950 (A1
and Faught Ridge), 1951 (Escudilla), 1953 (Circle Cross),
and 1956 (Ocate). Two of the sites, Fort Valley and A1, oc-
curred near Flagstaff in northern Arizona, where the drought
was not significant. Three of the sites (Faught Ridge,
Escudilla, and Ocate) have moderate to high levels of pon-
derosa pine recruitment during this period, despite poten-
tially unfavorably postfire climate conditions. There appears
to have been no significant time lag in the timing of regener-

ation after the fire at these sites (Fig. 2), although this find-
ing is tentative because of uncertainty in establishment
dates.
Natural rates of regeneration in historical ponderosa pine
stands have been found by some researchers to be low but
relatively continuous (e.g., White 1985), even during the
1950s at sites in northern Arizona (Fulé et al. 1997; Fulé et
al. 2002). Other reconstructions of past stand structure in
northern Arizona stands indicate regeneration of approxi-
mately 1–4 trees·ha–1 per decade in the centuries prior to
Euro-American influences, but showing broad peaks of tree
establishment (Mast et al. 1999). These reconstructions are
supported by studies suggesting that ponderosa pine regener-
ation is generally episodic and depends on favorable local
climate conditions (Schubert 1974; Moir et al. 1997). Epi-
sodic pulses are visible in reconstructions of establishment
over past centuries throughout the regional forest (Schubert
1974; Swetnam and Betancourt 1990).
Vegetation recovery following crown fires at some of the
study sites resemble a natural regeneration pulse, character-
ized by a fairly broad time frame on the order of decades, as
suggested by Mast et al. (1999). If establishment dates at
these sites are reasonably reliable, we may want to recon-
sider the suggestion of some studies (e.g., Savage et al.
1996) that such pulses depend on specific, favorable climate
conditions.
Conclusion
This study suggests that alternative recovery trajectories
can result from anomalous crown fires in southwestern pon-
derosa pine systems on a decadal scale. Crown fires at the
10 study sites appear to fit Petraitis and Latham’s (1999) no-
tion of an abrupt “switch” that can lead ecosystems into
states that differ significantly from historical structures. Un-
certainties temper the generality of the study, but the com-
munity structures at many of the high-density postburn sites
appear to represent anthropogenically induced states outside
a natural range of variability. Other postburn sites have de-
veloped into nonforest communities that Allen et al. (2002)
term “landscape scars”.
The question that we cannot answer here is, How long
will current states persist? Will these burn sites manifest as
historical accidents, frozen on the landscape for long periods
of time or merely successional stages, albeit changing
slowly in some cases? One phenomenon that will promote
alternative states is a fire regime that tends to reprise the cur-
rent structure. If Quercus or Arctostaphylos shrubfields or
hyperdense ponderosa pine foster more crown fires, the pat-
tern will recursively create a self-perpetuating community
structure. Ponderosa pine forests with structures within a
natural range of variation may then not return to such sites
for the foreseeable future. This will be more likely if contin-
ued drought conditions or rising temperatures (Gray et al.
2003; Mann et al. 1998) foster more high-intensity crown
fires.
The long-term undesirable consequences that appear to re-
sult from crown fire at many of these sites make a case for
continued attention to an increasingly urgent question: What
intervention can enhance the resiliency of southwestern pon-
derosa pine forests? Mitigation of the effects of intense fires
may begin by avoiding actions that increase stress on these
ecosystems, such as salvage logging or grazing, and instead
taking action to assist natural recovery processes. High-
density postcrown fire stands may be just as vulnerable to
future crown fires as southwestern ponderosa pine forests al-
ready considered at high risk. Restoration treatments recom-
mended for fire-suppressed ponderosa pine forests — thinning
of dense, young stands and reestablishing a surface-fire re-
gime at appropriate scales — are also urgently needed to in-
crease resiliency in high-density postcrown fire stands.
