Abstract
Predicted climate warming is expected to have
profound effects on bark beetle population dynamics in the
southwestern United States. Temperature-mediated effects
may include increases in developmental rates, generations
per year, and changes in habitat suitability. As a result, the
impacts of Dendroctonus frontalis and Dendroctonus
mexicanus on forest resources are likely subject to ampli-
ﬁcation. To assess the implications of such change, we
evaluated the generations per year of these species under
three climate scenarios using a degree-day development
model. We also assessed economic impacts of increased
beetle outbreaks in terms of the costs of application of
preventative silvicultural treatments and potential eco-
nomic revenues forgone. Across the southwestern USA, the
potential number of beetle generations per year ranged
from 1–3? under historical climate, an increase of 2–
4? under the minimal warming scenario and 3–5? under
the greatest warming scenario. Economic beneﬁts of
applying basal area reduction treatments to reduce forest
susceptibility to beetle outbreaks ranged from $7.75/ha
(NM) to $95.69/ha (AZ) under historical conditions, and
$47.96/ha (NM) to $174.58/ha (AZ) under simulated
severe drought conditions. Basal area reduction treatments
that reduce forest susceptibility to beetle outbreak result in
higher net present values than no action scenarios. Coupled
with other deleterious consequences associated with beetle
outbreaks, such as increased wildﬁres, the results suggest
that forest thinning treatments play a useful role in a period
of climate warming.

Introduction
Bark beetles are arguably the largest source of biological
disturbance in coniferous forests (Lieutier and others 2004;
Price and others 1990; Ayres and Lombardero 2000).
Recently, two economically important species in the genus
Dendroctonus (D. frontalis [SPB] and D. mexicanus
[XPB]) have been found occurring sympatrically in iso-
lated pine forests in southern Arizona and northern Mexico
(Moser and others 2005), well to the north of the previously
reported northern distribution of XPB (Salinas-Moreno and
others 2004). While a plethora of biotic (Hofstetter and
others 2006; Paine and others 1997; Byers 1989) and abi-
otic (Paine 1984; Coppedge and others 1994) factors
inﬂuence the population dynamics of these species, tem-
perature is identiﬁed as one of the primary limitations on
beetle development rates and phenology (Tran and others
2007; Ungerer and others 1999). In addition, prolonged
climatic shifts qualitatively affect species interactions and
population demographics within insect communities (Sau-
vard 2004; Stireman and others 2005; Walther and others
2002). Keeley (2006) suggests abrupt invasions, changes in
population dynamics, and long distance movements by
native and non-native species will result from climate
change. Insect habitat, namely trees, is also likely to
change with the climate, further complicating herbivore
dynamics (Loehle 1996). Therefore management must be
adaptive, promote resilience to pests, and enable forests to

respond to change in the face of changing climates (Logan
and others 2003; Millar and others 2007; Sauvard 2004).
Background of SPB and XPB
The SPB and XPB share many ontogenic and morphologic
similarities (Vite and others 1974; Wood 1982). Both
species exhibit well-developed glandular mycangia and
mycophagy, mass attraction to hosts via pheromone com-
munication, and require live host material for successful
reproduction (Cibrian-Tovar and others 1995; Barkawi and
others 2003; Moser and Macias-Samano 2000). As well,
XPB is apparently no more constrained by cool tempera-
tures than SPB because XPB tend to extend into higher
elevations than SPB where the species co-occur in Mexico
(Wood 1982; Cibrian-Tovar and others 1995). As with
many bark beetle species (Logan and others 2003), an
increase in the number of generations a year will have a
signiﬁcant impact on the outbreak potential of SPB
(Coulson 1979). Because of these similarities, the well-
researched biology and ecology of SPB is useful as a proxy
in predicting behaviors of the lesser-researched XPB in
regions where the two occur sympatrically. Thus, rate and
direction of spread, interactions with ﬁre, and economic
damages affected by both species can be estimated
concurrently.
Aside from life-cycle similarities, SPB and XPB display
an equivalent capacity for biological disturbance (Moser
and others 2005). For example, in a three-year infestation
in the southeastern US, SPB was associated with extensive
tree mortality across some 8000 ha of pine forest (Price
and others 1990). The outbreak on the Bankhead National
Forest (Alabama) resulted in an estimated economic loss of
$50–80 million worth of timber resources (USDA Forest
Insect and Disease Conditions 2001). Moser and others
(2005) reported XPB infestations [8000 ha as recently as
2002 in south-central Arizona and northern Mexico.
However, infestations in the southeastern U.S. are restric-
ted to SPB alone, whereas in Arizona and Mexico XPB are
found co-occurring with SPB in some locations (Moser and
others 2005).
Historic and Contemporary Beetle Populations
in the Southwest
Endemic populations of bark beetles have always existed in
southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) systems
(Sanchez-Martinez and Wagner 2002). At endemic levels
there is less than one percent background bark beetle-
induced tree mortality in southwestern forests. Samman
and Logan (2000) reported a background mortality of
susceptible trees of less than 2 percent per year in the
Rocky Mountain West. Outbreaks on the other hand, occur
when there are high beetle populations, an abundance of
available hosts, and favorable environmental conditions.
Therefore, managers can only modify the abundance and
vigor of available hosts in order to reduce the potential
threats of outbreaks on the landscape (Fettig and others
2007).
Prior to European settlement in the late nineteenth
century, a frequent low-intensity ﬁre regime maintained a
relatively open structure in southwestern ponderosa pine
forests (Cooper 1960; Covington and others 1997). Fire
exclusion, grazing, and logging practices have contributed
to current homogeneous dense stands (Covington and
Moore 1994; Covington and others 1997). High densities
and therefore high levels of intraspeciﬁc tree competition
for water and nutrients have created stands that are more
susceptible to insect epidemics (Olsen and others 1996;
Feeney and others 1998). Stand density index (SDI) is a
relative measure of stand density that can be used to
compare the actual number of trees per unit area to the
maximum number of trees per unit area that can survive at
a standardized average size (quadratic mean diameter of
25 cm) on a given site (Reineke 1933). SDI values for
individual stands can then be used to develop management
guidelines that minimize density-dependent mortality or
rate stands for risk of bark beetle mortality (Long and Shaw
2005). Oliver (1995) proposed a threshold for increased
beetle activity of SDImetric equal to 568 (given maximum
SDImetric equal to 902 in pure ponderosa pine stands),
above which endemic beetle populations would begin to
thin stands. Management recommendations for the SPB
suggest preventative measures to minimize timber losses
and avoid costly, short-term suppression projects by
maintaining forests in a vigorous, healthy condition
(Thatcher and Barry 1982; Nowak and others 2008). An
appropriate approach is to thin stands before inter-tree
competition results in increased suppression and slower
growth rates (Fettig and others 2007); Nowak and others
(2008) suggest reducing pine basal area to less than
approximately 19 m2/ha.
Effects of Thinning Treatments on Bark Beetle Activity
Previous research has found thinned pine stands have
higher soil water availability and thus the potential for
greater resistance to drought stress and insect attack (Kolb
and others 1998; Skov and others 2005; Zausen and others
2005). Zausen and others (2005) and Kolb and others
(1998) also found increased tree growth and larger diam-
eters in thinned stands with lower basal areas. Larger trees
had higher resin ﬂow (collected over a 24 h time period),
the primary defense mechanism against bark beetle attack,
and thicker phloem (Kolb and others 1998). Thinning
treatments can simultaneously reduce stand susceptibility

to bark beetles (Wallin and others 2008), create more
drought resistant trees, and reduce hazardous fuels (Fule´
and others 2001, 2002) that support stand-replacing ﬁres.
Treatments to reduce basal area in the Southwest have
moved from traditional thinning treatments to modiﬁed
individual tree selection systems that enable managers to
provide more variation in vertical and horizontal stand
structure. Such structures allow managers to meet multiple
objectives, such as reduction of ﬁre hazard, improved
wildlife habitat and increased aesthetics (O’Hara 1998).
Objectives
Given recent climate change projections of average tem-
perature increases ranging from 1.6 to 6.3C in the coming
50 to 100 years (McKenzie and others 2004; Seager and
others 2007), the attack behavior, range, ecological and
economic signiﬁcance of SPB and XPB in the southwestern
United States are subject to potentially signiﬁcant change,
affecting land management strategies. We evaluated the
potential impacts of increased SPB and XPB populations
under two climate change scenarios, addressing three
questions: (1) what are the potential effects of climate
change on the development rate of SPB and XPB? (2) what
are the projected economic impacts of tree mortality
associated with increased bark beetle outbreaks? (3) what
are the estimated costs of preventative silvicultural treat-
ments to reduce forest susceptibility to beetle-caused
mortality?
Methods
Climate Scenarios and Degree-Day Model
We modeled bark beetle generation times under three cli-
mate scenarios: (1) 30-year historical average tempera-
tures,
(2)
estimated
best-case
temperature
increase
(?1.6C) by the year 2100, and (3) estimated worst-case
temperature increase (?6.3C) by the year 2100. We used
the same climate change scenarios as McKenzie and others
(2004) in order to compare our predictions of beetle gen-
eration change with the wildﬁre predictions they devel-
oped. The scenarios were originally simulated in the
Parallel Climate Model of the U.S. National Center for
Atmospheric Research (Washington and others 2000),
under a scenario of relatively low future CO2 levels, and
the HadCM3 model of the Hadley Center for Climate
Prediction with the socioeconomic scenario A2, predicting
relatively high future CO2 levels.
We used a degree-day model of beetle development for
SPB (Ungerer and others 1999) to estimate changes in
generations per year for both SPB and XPB in the South-
west. The model incorporates physiological measurements
of insect developmental responses to temperature, and was
originally constructed to test the role of minimum and
maximum temperature in determining the northern distri-
bution limits and resulting annual generations of SPB.
Through experimentation, upper and lower developmental
thresholds have been established for SPB (Ungerer and
others 1999; Friedenberg and others 2008). The lower
lethal temperature is that at which the haemolymph and
other body ﬂuids crystallize when an animal is gradually
cooled (Somme 1982; Ungerer and others 1999; Tran and
others 2007). Generally, exposure for even a few minutes
to temperatures below the crystallization temperature
triggers irreparable tissue damage and death (Lombardero
and others 2000). Winter mortality has been reported in
natural populations of SPB that experienced minimum air
temperatures of -12 to -18C (Ungerer and others 1999;
Tran and others 2007). Laboratory experiments on SPB in
the eastern U.S. conducted by Ungerer and others (1999)
and the western U.S. by Hofstetter (unpublished) matched
reports of cold mortality, resulting in -16C as the lower
lethal air temperature for the model. Additionally, extended
periods of extreme high temperatures may also have
demographic impacts. The developmental rates of most
SPB life stages decrease above 32C (Gagne and others
1982; Wagner and others 1984). Temperatures above 43C
are known to kill larvae outright (Beal 1933).
The degree-day model predicts the developmental rate
of SPB through ﬁve distinct developmental phases in the
gallery environment: (1) oviposition, (2) egg incubation,
(3) larval development, (4) pupation, and (5) emergence.
Since SPB and XPB closely resemble one another mor-
phologically, phenologically, and ontogenically (Vite and
others 1974), we considered it reasonable to use the model
developed by Ungerer and others (1999) for predicting
generation dynamics of both species. Additionally, the
ﬂight patterns and generations per year of SPB predicted by
the model match results from published records in the
Southwest (Gaylord and others 2006, 2008; Williams and
others 2008). Total beetle population abundances were not
calculated or used in our models to predict landscape level
impacts. Beetle density, beetle-beetle interactions, and
tree-beetle interactions are important factors in determining
outbreak impacts and beetle population growth and success
(Coulson 1979), thus the use of generations per year alone
should be used cautiously when interpreting the effects of
temperature on beetle performance and potential impacts
on tree mortality.
We selected thirteen weather station sites across the
regional distribution of potential host Pinus species in
Arizona, New Mexico, and northern Mexico (Fig. 1). We
initialized the degree-day model with average daily

Regional Climate Center (http://www.wrcc.dri.edu), the

Oceanic
and
Atmospheric
Administration’s
Satellite and Information Service (www.noaa.gov), and the
Extractor Ra´pido de Informacio´n Clima´tica (ERIC III)
database for the time period 1971–2001. A sine function
was used to estimate temperatures at 3-h intervals from
daily minimum and maximum temperatures and develop-
ment was incremented at 3-h intervals based upon pre-
vailing temperatures (similar to Ungerer and others 1999).
We simulated increased future temperatures by adding
1.6C and 6.3C to daily values (Fig. 2).
Economic Analysis: Background, Assumptions, Losses,
and Treatment Costs
In order to evaluate the economic impacts associated with
the range expansion of SPB and XPB, we conducted the
with and without analysis to evaluate the economic beneﬁts
of preventative basal area reduction treatments. This eco-
nomic analysis was conducted for ponderosa pine exclu-
sively, and it should be noted that XPB and SPB are
capable of exploiting other pine hosts, possibly including
pinyon pine which is widespread in the Southwest. Fur-
thermore, while forests have many market and non-market
values, we limited our analysis to the potential effects on
timber revenues. Therefore our analysis is conservative and
does not capture the full breadth of potential damage in
either ecological or social terms.
Forest structural data came from the Forest Inventory
and Analysis (FIA) for Arizona and New Mexico (O’Brien
2002, 2003). Ponderosa pine forests covered 1,233,185 ha
in Arizona and 1,135,004 ha in New Mexico. Total area
and density of ponderosa pine trees in each state were used
to create the diameter distributions for modeling. Mean
basal areas for Arizona and New Mexico were approxi-
mately 21.8 and 20.7 m2/ha, respectively. We selected
forest stands for modeling based on the average stand basal

area plus one standard deviation in each state to capture
only those stands considered to be at risk of bark beetle
attack. These denser forest stands would beneﬁt most from
basal area reduction in both states. The average stand basal
area plus one standard deviation for Arizona and New
Mexico were approximately 34 and 30 m2/ha, respectively.
Tree diameter distributions that followed the shape of the
average diameter distribution, with densities increased to
match the basal area values of 34 and 30 m2/ha, were used
to initialize the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS),
Southwestern Ponderosa Pine model type. FVS is an
individual-tree, distance-independent growth and yield
model that can simulate a wide range of silvicultural
treatments for most major forest tree species, forest types,
and stand conditions of the United States. Since its initial
development in 1973, the basic FVS model structure has
been calibrated to unique geographic areas to produce
individual FVS variants which include well-known growth
and yield models based on decades of natural resources
research. Because of its applicability to a wide range of
treatments and forest stand conditions, FVS is the most
widely used forest stand simulator in the United States. The
FVS scenarios were set up for 100-year simulations to
parallel the beetle development model. However, FVS is a
statistical model that does not incorporate climate variables
directly, so the tree growth estimates did not reﬂect

temperature changes. Process models for simulating veg-
etation change would be more appropriate for incorporat-
ing climate variables directly, but such models are much
less accurate and less precise for assessing relatively short-
term (100 yr) changes (Keane and others 2004). The effect
of selecting FVS is that tree growth was probably overes-
timated at the end of the simulation period. The time period
for this study was from year 2007 to year 2107. Site factors
were selected at the approximate geographical center of
ponderosa pine forests in each state, corresponding to the
Coconino (AZ) and Cibola (NM) National Forests. Site
index was 22.9 m (base age 100) and maximum basal area
was set at 47 m2/ha.
We ran simulations for Arizona and New Mexico with
and without basal area reduction treatments. The with-
treatment scenario was more complex, with individual tree
selection scheduled at 40-year cycles beginning in year 10;
each entry reduced basal area to 12 m2/ha. The low
residual basal area accounted for tree growth between
cutting cycles, maintaining the stand below the published
guidelines for bark beetle prevention (19 m2/ha; Nowak
and others 2008; Oliver 1995). We assumed that costs
associated with treatments were highest in the ﬁrst entry at
$617/ha to thin and burn slash piles, and lower for the next
two entries at $371/ha (USFS personal comm. Oct. 2007).
Revenues from treatments were calculated for three size
classes
based
on
current
timber
sizes
and
values:
trees B23 cm in diameter, between 23 and 30 cm in
diameter, and C30 cm in diameter. The contributing per-
centage of volume per size class was calculated using
height and diameter outputs from the FVS tree list ﬁles for
each thinning event. Tree values differed by diameter, such
that one unit of volume increased in value at a ratio of
1:6:10 dollars respectively for the three size classes (USDA
Forest Service 2007). Therefore, the stumpage values for
pulpwood, chip-n-saw and sawtimber were assumed to be
$1, $6 and $10 per hundred cubic feet (CCF). Annual
compound softwood sawtimber and pulpwood stumpage
price growth in the interior west between levels in the late
1990s and 2050s was projected at 1 and 0%, respectively
(Haynes 2003). Labor costs were assumed to increase at a
real rate of 1.7% per year (Council of Economic Advisers
2007). We used a real interest rate of 4% to perform dis-
counted cash ﬂow analyses.
In the without-treatment scenario, we used FVS to
project 100-year growth for the model stand. We estimated
timber revenues forgone using the same inputs for FVS as
described above, except we did not schedule treatments.
Instead, we assumed total mortality on a given hectare
under two mortality frequency scenarios based on con-
temporary and predicted severe drought events (Seager and
others 2007) leading to bark beetle outbreaks. The ﬁrst
mortality
scenario
was
based
on
historical
drought
frequency over the past century in the Southwest: the 1950
s drought and the 2002 drought that caused the largest
recorded bark beetle outbreak in Arizona and New Mexico.
Thus, scenario 1 assumed that two bark beetle outbreaks
occurred per century, associated with the two severe
drought
events.
However,
climate
change
modeling
strongly suggests that the future will be characterized by
more frequent and severe droughts than the past (Seager
and others 2007). The second mortality scenario thus
assumed a ﬁve-fold increase in severe droughts, increased
from two to ten droughts per 100 years. Each drought
would be associated with a bark beetle outbreak, increasing
the simulated bark beetle outbreaks and mortality to ten
events per century. The two bark beetle species were
assumed to behave similarly in these scenarios (outbreaks
result in 100% mortality on any given hectare) and inter-
actions between the beetles were not considered.
Results
Future Bark Beetle Dynamics: Degree Day Modeling
The degree-day model predicted a substantial increase in
the number of generations per year achievable by SPB and
XPB throughout the southwestern region (Fig. 3). How-
ever, the most substantial increase was seen in the south-
west and southeast portions of our focus area (Fort Bayard,
NM; Portal, AZ; northern Mexico). In contrast, the north-
ern weather stations (Flagstaff and Jacob Lake, AZ; Win-
dow Rock and Chama, NM) maintained a smaller increase
with fewer generations per year over both warming
scenarios.
Under historical climate conditions, bark beetle gener-
ations were no greater than 4 per year at any site and less
than two at most northern sites. Under the best-case
warming scenario, ?1.6C, all except two stations in the
north (Flagstaff, AZ and Chama, NM) exceeded two gen-
erations.
The
worst-case
warming
scenario,
?6.3C,
resulted in three to over four generations throughout the
Southwest. The warmest station (Portal) exceeded four
generations under the best-case and approached six under
the worst-case scenario.
Economic Analysis
Net present value (NPV) per hectare for basal area reduc-
tion treatments (with treatments) and no action option
(without treatments) for ponderosa pine forests in Arizona
and New Mexico are presented in Table 1. Two bark beetle
outbreak scenarios were investigated. The NPVs with
treatments for Arizona and New Mexico was -$344.32
and
-$382.78
per
hectare,
respectively
(Table 1).

Although timber revenues derived from the basal area
reduction treatments were not enough to offset the costs of
thinning and pile burning due to low stumpage values, the
ponderosa pine forests investigated in this study would still
exist, providing ecosystem services. On the other hand,
under the two bark beetle outbreaks scenarios, the NPVs
for the ‘‘without treatments’’ scenario were more negative
than the values for the ‘‘with treatments’’ scenario. They
ranged from -$440.01 (scenario 1) to -$518.90 (scenario
2) per hectare for Arizona and from -$390.53 (scenario 1)
to -$430.74 (scenario 2) per hectare for New Mexico. As a
result, under scenario 1, the economic beneﬁts of the basal
area reduction treatments were $95.69 and $7.75 per
hectare for Arizona and New Mexico, respectively. Under
scenario 2, the economic beneﬁts of treatments increased to
$174.58 and $47.96 per hectare for Arizona and New
Mexico, respectively.
Discussion
Degree-Day Model and Predicting Future Outbreaks
Physiologically-based models are a tool for supporting land
management decisions in forests and illustrate a general
method for predicting the regional consequences of climate
change on the distribution of bark beetles (Moser and
others 2005). Given the climate change scenarios and
previous regional data on epidemic conditions of mor-
phologically similar primary bark beetles, it is possible that
bark beetle-induced tree mortality could be as high as or
higher than recorded in the historical maximum of year
2002 in the southwestern United States. If regional
warming forecasts hold, degree-day modeling suggests that
XPB and SPB populations are likely to achieve the greatest
number of generations per year, exceeding 5, branching
across southern Arizona and New Mexico from the recently
detected population in the Chiricahua Mountains (Moser
and others 2005), located near the Portal, AZ weather
station. Although negative effects of high temperatures
were not apparent in our models, the possibility remains
that beetle populations may suffer signiﬁcant mortality
events with extended periods over 32C (Friedenberg and
others 2008) thus limiting beetle outbreaks during those
years.
In comparison, the predicted number of SPB generations
per year in the southeastern United States (Ungerer and
others 1999), using the same model, ranged from six in the
southern Gulf States to four near the northern limits of SPB
(in southern Illinois and Indiana). This difference was
attributed to the coastal climates, which had more days per
year when temperatures allowed beetle development to
proceed (Ungerer and others 1999). The southeastern SPB
population increase was modeled spatially by Ungerer and

others (1999) with projected isolines moving northward, an
approach consistent with the relative abundance of pine
forests and relatively homogeneous topography of the
region. In contrast, the southwestern U.S. is characterized
by abrupt topographical changes, with pine forests gener-
ally restricted to isolated mountaintops (Fig. 1). Therefore,
future bark beetle outbreaks are likely to be more geo-
graphically constrained and the spread of XPB and SPB
will probably be highly dependent upon local introductions
and interactions (Brooker and others 2007; Tran and others
2007) in the disconnected islands of pine habitat, rather
than smoothly following temperature change.
A major source of uncertainty in our analyses is whether
XPB, a non-native species apparently currently extending
its range into the southwestern U.S., will in fact have
similar behavior to the anatomically and physiologically
similar native species, SPB. To date, SPB has been rela-
tively inconsequential as a forest pest in the Southwest, but
an exception has been the infestation (starting in 2000)
within the Chiracahua Mountains of the Coronado National
Forest in southern Arizona which proved to be a mix of
SPB and XPB (Moser and others 2005) and infestations
during 2002 and 2003 within the Tonto and Coconino
National Forests in central Arizona which proved to be a
mix of SPB, western pine beetle (D. brevicomis) and Ips
species (DeGomez 2004). Two key questions for further
investigation are whether XPB is similarly constrained by
cold temperatures as SPB and whether the two species will
have similar patterns of tree attack. The XPB has recently
been documented to attack pinyon pines in northeastern
Mexico (Pinus cembroides, closely related to the south-
western species P. edulis) (Cue´llar and others in press). If
similar attacks were to commence on P. edulis in the
Southwest, a species more widely distributed than pon-
derosa pine, the extent of XPB impact on ecosystems and
the regional economy could be much greater than forecast
in our analysis. Additionally, the impacts to host trees by
these two beetle species across the landscape may or may
not be additive, in that they are likely to carry different
microbial communities or the co-attack of both species on
host trees may alter beetle ﬁtness and tree susceptibility.
Economic Analysis
In the United States, the average annual impact area of
insects and pathogenic disturbances was estimated to be
20,400,000 hectares, and the average annual economic cost
of the disturbances was projected to be $1.5 billion (Dale
and others 2001). Managing our forested landscapes in the
face of uncertain climate change will require a vast array of
strategies that focus on enhancing ecosystem resilience
which will facilitate structural transitions that may be less
susceptible to disturbance (Millar and others 2007). Pre-
vious research suggests climate change can be a catalyst for
range expansion of native species and may even allow
native species to become invasive in their new environ-
ments. A proactive approach to mitigate these potential
threats is to conduct periodic basal area reduction treat-
ments across the landscape. The beneﬁts of such thinning
treatments extend far beyond bark beetle control. Pyne and
others (1996) stated, ‘‘An ounce of pre-suppression activity
is worth a pound of suppression funds’’. Although Pyne
was describing prevention and suppression of wildland ﬁre,
bark beetle outbreaks and catastrophic crown ﬁres both
occur in forests that are outside their range of natural
variability and can be prevented through basal area

Our economic analysis of the situation has provided a
quantitative approach to decision making in the south-
western region. According to the results of this study, the
most costly of all possible management strategies would be

‘no action’. Even though the current low timber values in
the southwest did not make thinning treatments a proﬁtable
investment in our analysis, the economic beneﬁts of the
treatment in terms of reducing potential bark beetle out-
breaks are signiﬁcant. Since only the value of timber was
considered in our analyses, the estimates of revenues
foregone resulting from the no-action management strategy
are extremely conservative. A 4% real interest rate was
used in this study to perform discounted cash ﬂow analy-
ses. Sensitivity analysis can further be conducted to
investigate how sensitive the NPV and economic beneﬁts
for basal area reduction treatments are to changes in
selected inputs such as interest rate, treatment costs and
stumpage prices.
The economic consequences of treating or not treating
forests in our analysis address only a fraction of all the
economic and social issues involved. An analogous anal-
ysis from the perspective of avoiding ﬁre suppression costs
was completed recently by Snider and others (2006).
Wildland ﬁre suppression costs in the U.S. now routinely
exceed $1,000,000,000 annually (Calkin and others 2005).
Snider and others (2006) calculated that investments in
thinning of $588 to $1,485/ha were justiﬁed solely in terms
of saving the future costs of suppressing severe ﬁres. As in
our analysis, only quantiﬁable values were considered. Yet,
the ecological and social values of southwestern forests are
clearly much higher than the measureable costs of wood
products or ﬁre suppression; these lands are critical in
terms of habitat, recreational values, carbon sequestration,
aesthetics, watersheds, and spiritual values. The threats to
existing ecosystems from interacting disturbances associ-
ated with global climate change, non-native species, and
resource exploitation are high (Hulme 2005). However,
intersecting lines of evidence from insect ecology, ﬁre
ecology, and drought response studies indicate that man-
agement intervention to thin dense forests can make these
ecosystems more resilient to catastrophic change. At the
same time, economic analyses indicate that intervention is
ﬁnancially more attractive than non-intervention even
when only a fraction of the value of forest ecosystems is
considered.
Implications for Forest Management
Predicted increases in generations per year of SPB and
XPB will interact with several other disturbances for a
cumulative effect that exceeds that of the beetles alone.
First, warming will affect not only these species but other
aggressive, tree killing bark beetles in the region, as shown
by Williams and Liebhold (2002) for both SPB and
Dendroctonus ponderosae. Similar effects are anticipated
for other Dendroctonus species of the southwest, such as
Dendroctonus brevicomis and D. adjunctus. D. brevicomis
occurs throughout the west and is known to co-colonize
trees with SPB (Gaylord and others 2008; Hofstetter and
others 2008). Currently D. ponderosae reaches its southern
limit in Arizona and New Mexico; climate-based modeling
suggested the species would move to higher elevations and
the northern boundary of its distribution would move fur-
ther north, but the southern boundary might remain in the
Southwest (Logan and Bentz, 1999; but see Logan and
others 2003). Increased populations of SPB and XPB are
likely to coexist with increases in other bark beetle popu-
lations. A second factor is ﬁre. Using the same climate
scenarios as in our analysis, McKenzie and others (2004)
forecast approximately a doubling of average annual area
burned in Arizona and a nearly ﬁve-fold increase in New
Mexico (the greatest increase of all the western states) by
2100 under the best-case Parallel Climate Model PCM-B2
(?1.3C) scenario. The 6.3C scenario, HadCM3, led to
predictions
far
outside
the
range
of
historical
ﬁres
(McKenzie and others 2004). Beetle outbreaks and ﬁre
interact synergistically (Parker and others 2006), with
beetles attracted to burned areas (Breece and others 2007)
and ﬁre hazard increased in recently attacked trees that still
retain dry foliage. Finally, drought itself is a disturbance
that can cause direct mortality (Breshears and others 2005),
in addition to fostering conditions for ﬁre spread and
weakening tree defenses. Severe droughts are forecast to be
increasingly common across the Southwest in the twenty-
ﬁrst century (Seager and others 2007).
Silvicultural interventions designed to reduce forest
vulnerability to non-native bark beetle attack (Waring and
O0Hara 2005) will also reduce the hazard of severe wild-
ﬁres and increase tree resistance to drought. Stand basal
area reductions to densities below 19-23 m2/ha, recom-
mended for minimizing beetle outbreaks, will also increase
the crowning index (windspeed required to sustain active
crown ﬁre) to levels that are less common during the ﬁre
season, reducing the probability of severe burning (Fule´
and others 2001). Individual pine trees, including old-
growth trees, respond rapidly to thinning in terms of
reduced water stress at the driest period of the growing
season and increased resin ﬂow, a defense against bark
beetles (Stone and others 1999; Feeney and others 1998),
with the greatest responses at the lowest densities (Skov
and others 2005). Although there is clearly overlap in terms
of the conservation beneﬁts of treatments, not all goals are
necessarily achieved together. For example, in higher-ele-
vation ponderosa pine forests where Abies and Pseudots-
uga have increased in density since ﬁre exclusion,
removing many of these trees may be beneﬁcial from the
perspectives of ecological restoration of the pine stands and
reducing the vertical canopy fuels created by the long
crowns of these shade-tolerant species (Fule´ and others
2006), but retaining many of these trees may limit pine

bark beetle outbreaks by keeping the stands mixed in
species (Waring and O0Hara 2005). It is probable that cli-
mate change will occur more rapidly than trees can migrate
into new ranges (Neilson and others 2005). If this occurs,
the population of susceptible ponderosa pine may decline
in the southwest, limiting host material to support beetle
outbreaks.
