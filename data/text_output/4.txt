PUBLIC OPINION 
Fire in the Forest: Public Perceptions of 
Ecological Restoration in North-central Arizona 
David M. Ostergren, Jesse B. Abrams and Kimberly A. Lowe 
ABSTRACT 
In recent years residents of the intermontane West have experienced a series of expensive and high-profile fire seasons. 
One result is that the concept of ecological restoration has moved squarely into public view. As scientists and practitioners 
continue to refine the definition of ecological restoration as a practical matter, citizens are forming their own perceptions of 
how restoration should be applied to local forests. We used a recent public opinion survey in north-central Arizona to assess 
public views of restoration. Our findings indicate broad support for restoration although portions of the population, particularly 
those in rural areas, see restoration primarily as a means to protect human lives and property from fire. Most importantly, our 
findings suggest that a majority of the public in this region have a view of restoration beyond fire risk reduction, but vary in 
their willingness to accept dramatic changes to forest conditions.

 Extensive 
crown 
fires 
in 
southwestern United States forests 
over the last decade, such as the 
2000 Cerro Grande fire in New 
Mexico and the 2002 Rodeo-
Chediski burn in Arizona, have 
precipitated federal policy changes 
that emphasize preemptive forest 
treatments in addition to traditional 
fire suppression activities. In 2000, 
for example, an interagency report 
to the president emphasized the 
importance of "reducing hazardous 
fuel accumulations in our forests 
and rangelands and restoring the 
health and natural processes of 
forest and rangeland ecosystems" 
(USDA/ DOI 2000, 14). The 2000 
National Fire Plan emphasizes 
fuels reduction and restoring fire to 
forest ecosystems (National Fire 
Plan 2001). A primary purpose of 
the Healthy Forest Restoration Act 
(HFRA) is "to reduce wildfire risk 
to communities, municipal water 
supplies, and other at-risk Federal 
land 
through 
a 
collaborative 
process of planning, prioritizing, 
and implementing hazardous fuel 
reduction projects" (HFRA 2003, 
§2501). 
These 
policies 
institutionalize a new direction for 
the management of forests on 
public lands and have placed 
forest restoration squarely within 
public view. 
  A wide spectrum of managers, 
policy makers, nongovernment 
organizations and members of the 
public 
agree 
that 
restoration 
efforts are needed to produce 
"healthier" or 
"more 
natural" 
conditions on public lands. There 
is wide debate, however, about 
specific parameters and processes 
of restoration (e.g., Jordan 2000, 
Katz 2000). In addition, planning 
for restoration on public lands 
means involving a wide array of 
participants with divergent, often 
competing, agendas. Key com-
ponents to planning include the 
1969 
National 
Environmental 
Policy Act process and new 
strategies that involve the public 
to a greater degree, such as 
collaborative planning (Brick et 
al. 2001), adaptive governance 
(Brunner 
et 
al. 
2005), 
and 
participatory landscape analysis 
(Sisk et al. 2006). The process is 
often slow, as these issues are 
ecologically complex and contain 
a     high   degree   of   uncertainty  
(Joyce 
2003). 
While 
these 
strategies place a high premium on 
public 
participation, 
forest 
restoration 
can 
have 
different 
meanings for different individuals. 
In this article, we share the results 
of a self-administered mail survey 
completed in 2001 that aimed to 
assess 
how 
residents 
of 
the 
southwestern U.S. view forest 
restoration. 
 
A Continuum of 
Restoration 
 
Southwestern forests have received 
a great deal of attention from 
restoration 
researchers 
and 
practitioners (Schumman 2004). 
Timber harvesting, overgrazing, 
and fire suppression after Euro-
American 
settlement 
changed 
ecosystem structure, comp-osition, 
and processes with the result that 
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) 
forests are generally described as 
degraded and out of their natural 
range of variability (Cooper 1960, 
Covington et al. 1994, Covington 
2003a, Kaufmann et al. 2004, 
Moore et al. 2004). Some authors 
emphasize the urgency of declining 
forest health in the southwest and 
call for swift remedial action to 
restore     ecological  health  before

more acres are lost to uncharacteristic 
and devastating crown fire (Covington 
2000). 
Confounding this call to action, the 
social landscape of ponderosa pine 
restoration is characterized by discord 
and disagreement (Friederici 2003, 
Burns 2003, Moote 2003). Approaches 
to restoration treatments are diverse 
and sometimes conflicting, but can be 
understood to fall on a kind of 
continuum. Noss et al. describe 
restoration as "guiding an ecosystem 
along a trajectory of recovery of natu-
ral structure, function, and composi-
tion, that is, toward ecological health 
and integrity" (2006, 7). A strict 
interpretation of restoration incorpo-
rates principles of ecological fidelity to 
bring degraded forests back in line with 
historic trajectories on large spatial and 
temporal scales (Covington 2003b, 
Friederici 2003). One model attempts 
to recreate forest structure using 
historic evidence (e.g., stumps, holes) 
as a guide for restoring clumps of trees, 
openings, and individual trees in a 
given stand (Mast et al. 1999, Moore et 
al. 1999, Friederici 2005). This 
approach 
might 
recommend 
an 
aggressive thinning program to reduce 
a 3,000 stems/ha density to 150 stems/ 
ha and then reintroduce fire. Allen et 
al. (2002) advocate slower, more 
incremental change that preserves 
existing patterns of larger trees, rather 
than attempting to restore exact pre-
degradation patterns. While there are 
some important differences between 
these two models, they both advocate a 
mixture of mechanical interventions 
and low-intensity fire reintroduction 
(i.e., Wildland Fire Use). 
Restoration as "fire risk reduction," 
on the other hand, has the primary goal 
of altering fire behavior via changing 
fuel loads, and does not emphasize 
ecological patterns and processes 
(Allen et al. 2002). This form of forest 
restoration is increasingly common in 
close proximity to communities and 
homes. 
Another approach to forest resto-
ration is the "natural regulation par-
adigm," which has received a great 
deal of criticism (Bonnicksen 1994, 
Agee 2002, Thomas 2002). Under this 
"hands-off" paradigm, nature is self-
regulating and should be allowed to 
take its course unimpeded by human 
actions (Bonnicksen 1994). Advocates 
view crown fires, for example, as a first 
step toward 'the forest healing itself 
because they leave a mosaic of forest 
conditions. Significant portions of the 
public appear to be sympathetic to a 
passive management strategy (Winter 
and Cvetkovich 2003, Shindler et al. 
2002, Brunson and Shindler 2004). 
This review indicates the broad 
social context of restoration as well as 
the fundamental questions that remain 
about what to restore to, when to 
restore, and how much intervention is 
good without being too much (for 
further discussion see Gobster and Hull 
2000, Gross 2003, Allison 2004, 
Simpson 2005). With our mail survey, 
we sought to shed light on residents' 
opinions 
and 
perceptions 
of 
restoration. This area is at a high risk 
for large fires, and residents have heard 
a variety of messages about forest 
restoration from the news media, 
nonprofit groups, the U.S. Forest 
Service (USFS), and the Ecological 
Restoration 
Institute 
at 
Northern 
Arizona University as well as state and 
municipal agencies. A review of 
National Forest web sites in north-cen-
tral Arizona, for example, reveals that 
the USFS is very careful to describe its 
activities as hazardous fuels treatment 
and not restoration. Nonetheless some 
of the hottest news stories reported on 
forest restoration, come from the USFS 
and multiple interest groups (Arizona 
Daily Sun 2001). The Greater Flagstaff 
Forests Partnership (www.gffp.org), 
for 
example, 
is 
a 
collaborative 
multistakeholder effort with multiple 
missions, one of which is outreach and 
education on forest restoration. 
Literature on the 
Public View 
Public knowledge and perception of 
any management action influences the 
debate and acceptance or rejection of 
that action. Several years after the 1988 
wildfires in Yellowstone National 
Park, for example, public outcry 
caused all federal land management 
agencies to dramatically reduce the 
number of lightning-ignited fires they 
allowed to burn. Since then, land 
management agencies have slowly 
increased the number of fires allowed 
to burn, however, as the positive results 
from the Yellowstone fires emerge. 
Common elements of southwestern 
forest restoration include prescribed 
fire, mechanical thinning, and manip-
ulating plant and animal populations to 
favor native species and reduce the 
presence of nonnative species. These 
elements may be applied in isolation or 
in combination. They may also be 
included in management actions that 
are not restoration projects. Even 
regarding something as apparently as 
straightforward as treating excessively 
dense, small-diameter stands of pine, 
however, public attitudes can vary 
widely-the result of "a diverse set of 
individual experiences, connections to 
the forest, knowledge sources, cultural 
influences, and fundamental values" 
(Findley et al. 2001, 24). Definitions of 
restoration are informed by individual 
understandings 
of 
"naturalness" 
(Vining et al. 2000, Bright et al. 2002), 
perceptions of science (Helford 2000, 
Woolley and McGinnis 2000), as well 
as 
emotional 
attachments 
to 
a 
landscape (Vining et al. 2000, Findley 
et al. 2001, Graber 2003). 
Prescribed fire 
Fire is a keystone ecological process in 
southwestern forests and is often the 
most visible element to the public. 
Indeed, the redefinition of some fire as 
"good" is the most dramatic change in 
forest policy since 1910 (Pyne 2004). 
Changes in attitude toward prescribed 
fire have been examined extensively as 
it has become more common. Trends 
show an increase in public acceptance 
and understanding of prescribed fire 
(Shelby and Speaker 1990, Loomis et 
al. 2001). However, positive attitudes 
toward prescribed fire are far from 
universal. Public acceptance of the 
practice appears to be influenced by a 
number 
 
52 
 March 2008    ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION    26:1 

of factors, including the extent of peo-
ple's knowledge about prescribed fire 
(Taylor and Daniel 1984, Manfredo et 
al. 1990, Loomis et al. 2001), the level 
of trust in the agency implementing the 
practice (Winter et al. 2002, Winter et 
al. 2004, Vogt et al. 2003), and beliefs 
regarding 
the 
ultimate 
outcomes 
(Manfredo et al. 1990, Winter and 
Fried 2000). As knowledge, trust, and a 
belief in the outcome increase, so does 
acceptance. Demographic factors such 
as age, income, gender, location, and 
education also influence acceptance of 
prescribed fire and smoke (Manfredo 
et al. 1990, Shindler et al. 2002, Winter 
and Cvetkovich 2003, Brunson and 
Shindler 2004, Ostergren et al. 2006). 
In addition, a study in Utah revealed 
that prescribed fire and whether 
managers 
can 
use 
it 
"wherever 
managers see fit" loses some its 
acceptance if the fire escapes, but the 
general support for prescribed fire 
remained high enough to continue its 
use (Brunson and Evans 2005). 
Mechanical thinning 
Like prescribed fire, mechanical thin-
ning is both a means of reducing wild-
land fuels and a tool for achieving 
restoration. Thinning tends to be pub-
licly supported, but issues of agency 
credibility and trust are important 
determinants of acceptance (Vogt et al. 
2003, Winter et al. 2004). Some view 
thinning simply as commercial logging 
in disguise (Findley et al. 2001). In 
some western forest cases, survey 
respondents showed greater support for 
thinning than prescribed fire (Shindler 
et al. 2002, Vogt et al. 2003, Brunson 
and Shindler 2004, Brunson and Evans 
2005). However Toman and Shindler 
(2003) found that northeast Oregon 
residents solidly preferred thinning 
followed by prescribed fire over either 
one in isolation or no management at 
all. 
  Attitudes toward mechanical thin-
ning vary across personal experience 
and environmental value orientations 
(Vogt et al. 2003, Abrams et al. 2005). 
Brunson and Shindler (2004) found 
significant differences in support for 
mechanical thinning between Ari-
zona, Colorado, Oregon, and Utah.  
 
 
 
 
 
Shindler et al. (2002) found that very 
large majorities of urban and rural 
residents in the Pacific Northwest 
believed mechanical thinning was 
appropriate for "overstocked forests," 
but significant differences were found 
in their approval under "depleted" and 
"healthy" conditions. Vogt (2003) 
found no significant differences in 
acceptance of mechanical fuel reduc-
tion between seasonal and permanent 
home owners in California, Colorado, 
and Florida. Mechanical fuel reduc-
tion seems to be best supported when 
the goals of the project are clear and 
related to improving forest health. 
Manipulating plant 
and animal species 
A third element in ecological restora-
tion is species composition and either 
extirpating invasives or reintroducing 
native species. The literature is rela-
tively scant on public perception of 
species manipulation in southwestern 
forests. In a national survey for the 
National Park Service, Solop et al. 
(2004) found the public evenly split on 
species eradication or reintroduction. 
More educated and higher income 
respondents were more likely to favor 
removal of nonnative species. Meadow 
et al. (2005) examined changing 
attitudes 
of 
people 
in 
Arizona, 
Colorado, and New Mexico toward 
restoration of the gray wolf (Canis 
lupus). They found 64% of all 
respondents 
favored 
reestablishing 
wolves and 33% opposed, although 
more than half of all rancher respon-
dents did not favor wolf restoration. 
Passive management 
Several recent studies have addressed 
public 
perceptions 
of 
"passive 
management." In a 2001-2002 survey, 
7.5% 
of 
southwest 
resident 
respondents (ranging from 5.4% of 
Californians to 
10.5% 
of New 
Mexicans) felt that fires should be 
allowed to "take their natural course 
when 
burning 
in 
wildland 
or 
wilderness areas, even if structures are 
involved" (Winter and Cvetkovich 
2003).    Fewer than 10% of Oregon  
and     Washington         resident  
 
 
 
 
 
 
respondents felt that this was an 
appropriate course of action even for 
overstocked forests (Shindler et al. 
2002). However, 42% of urban 
respondents 
and 
32% 
of 
rural 
respondents believed "letting nature 
take its course" was appropriate man-
agement for healthy forests. Nearly 
half (48%) of respondents in four 
western states agreed that "following 
nature's 
way 
is 
preferable 
to 
intervention in ecosystems" (Brunson 
and Shindler 2004). Natural regulation 
is a valueladen phrase, and its 
acceptability may depend on whether 
the public believes that the forest is in a 
"natural" state, that is, whether people 
judge the forest to be healthy or 
normal. 
These survey results indicate that 
residents of these areas are aware of 
forest management practices and have 
definite opinions on the various ele-
ments of specific actions that may be 
entailed in forest restoration. But do 
residents understand that each action, 
or combination of actions, has quali-
tative implications for forest health and 
restoration? Mechanical thinning alone 
in a ponderosa pine ecosystem would 
not have the same restorative effect on 
function, composition, and process as 
would a comprehensive strategy of 
density 
reduction, 
species 
reintroduction, and eradication, and the 
reestablishment of the historic fire 
regime (regardless of whether these 
ends are met through mechanical or 
non-mechanical means). 
While the scientific literature is 
replete with detailed descriptions of 
what "good" ecological restoration is 
(Jackson et al. 1995, Hobbs and 
Norton 1996, Higgs 1997), no pre-
vious studies have tried to assess the 
public perception of restoration in 
southwestern ponderosa pine forests. 
Fighting fire and forest conditions in 
general are salient issues for residents 
in north-central Arizona. Before our 
survey, we expected the public to be 
aware of fuel reduction strategies but 
did not expect a majority of the public 
to have a deeper understanding and 
support of restoration.

Surveying 
North-Central Arizona 
Residents 
As part of a research project funded by 
the Ecological Research Institute at 
Northern Arizona University, we 
administered a mail survey to regional 
residents in 2003. Questions on the 
survey were split between people's 
perceptions of forest restoration and 
mountain lion policy. Our target 
population was adult (> 18 years old) 
seasonal or permanent residents who 
have lived in the area one year or 
longer. We selected our independent 
variables based on current literature of 
fire perceptions and policy acceptance 
(Brunson et al. 1997, Shindler et al. 
1993, Cortner et al. 2003). Complete 
details on the survey format and 
methodology are available from the 
authors. 
Thirty-five zip codes in the sample 
area were determined by laying a zip 
code map over a vegetation map of 
Arizona. The area surveyed starts at the 
Utah border and north rim of Grand 
Canyon National Park and stretches 
southeast through the largest urban 
area of Flagstaff (population 60,000) 
along the Mogollon Rim and the Fort 
Apache Reservation to the New 
Mexico border, with an "island" that 
includes Prescott (Figure 1). In 2003 
we sent four mailings to 1,644 U.S. 
Postal Service-approved addresses. 
Our initial mailing was a pre-notice 
letter (Dillman 2000). Forty-six per-
cent (750) of the questionnaires were 
returned.  Fifty-seven of the ques-
tionnaires were unusable, for a total 
sample size of 693. This return rate is 
consistent with other natural resource 
focused mail survey return rates 
(Connelly et al. 2003). 
Respondents were mostly white 
males, aged 45-65 years and compara-
tively well-educated. Eighty-eight per-
cent of the respondents reported their 
ethnicity as Caucasian. U.S. Census 
Bureau (Census) data for Coconino 
County indicates that only 77% of 
residents are Caucasian. The sample 
underrepresents 
Native 
Americans 
(1.2% vs. 10%) and Hispanics (4% 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
vs. 10.9%), and we do not draw any 
conclusions based on ethnicity. Mean 
respondent age was 57.8 years old (n = 
676, SD = 14.33), with age ranging 
from 19 to 93. This age range does not 
match Census Bureau 2000 statistics 
but is consistent with a voting 
population, the group we assumed 
would participate in decision making 
(Theodori and Luloff 2002). Ninety-
-one percent of respondents were per-
manent residents. Sixty-eight percent 
were male and 32 percent female, 
which is skewed from an even gender 
ratio reported by the 2000 Census. A 
plurality of the respondents reported an 
income of $30,000 to $59,999 (38%). 
Sixty percent of respondents reported 
living in rural areas, while 39.9% 
reported living in an urban area i.e., 
Flagstaff ). 
 
Survey Results  
 
Management activities 
Respondents were asked what activi-
ties they believed were included in 
forest restoration from a list of choices 
that included "thinning of trees," 
"removing nonnative plant and animal 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
species," "prescribed burns," "planting 
native species," and "native plant and 
animal 
species 
preservation." 
Respondents could select more than 
one activity. A large majority (76.5%) 
believed that restoration included at 
least the two activities of thinning and 
prescribed burning (Table 1). A key 
question, however, is to what degree 
respondents believed restoration con-
sists simply of thinning and burning, 
and to what degree they believe res-
toration goes further to include more 
"holistic" activities such as native spe-
cies preservation and reintroduction or 
nonnative species control. 
Just 16.5% of respondents believed 
forest restoration includes only thin-
ning and prescribed burning and none 
of the other activities. A full 60% of all 
survey respondents agreed that forest 
restoration 
includes 
thinning, 
prescribed burning, and at least one 
more action. About 30% selected non-
native species removal, and roughly 
half selected native species planting or 
native 
species 
preservation. 
The 
remainder (23.5%) did not choose both 
thinning and burning, but may have 
selected thinning without choosing 
burning (7.1%), burning but not

thinning (11.7%), or neither thinning 
nor burning (4.7%). 
Purpose of restoration 
A second series of questions aimed to 
identify how residents perceived the 
purpose of restoration and their 
opinion on some of the more concrete 
results of restoration (Tables 2 and 
3). Table 2 shows percentages of 
respondents answering survey ques-
tions according to education level and 
residential location. Table 3 provides 
chi-square 
comparisons 
of 
respondents according to education 
level and area of residence. 
In general, this public supports res-
toration. Eighty-one percent believe 
restoration is important because "they 
like forests." Respondents with high 
school education were more likely to 
agree with this statement than those 
with some college or graduate educa-
tion. An even larger majority, 84.3%, 
support restoration because they 
agree "it is our duty to care for the 
natural world." We anticipated that 
the 200,000-ha Rodeo-Chediski fire 
in 2002 would bias residents to 
believe that the purpose of restoration 
is primarily to protect humans from 
fire. However only 31.7% agreed 
with this statement and 50.1% 
disagreed. The chi-square results 
reveal that people who completed 
high school were more likely to agree 
with this statement than people with 
some college or graduate education. 
Urban residents were more likely to 
disagree with this statement than 
rural residents. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In terms of the purpose of resto-
ration, a large majority, 87.1%, of 
respondents agreed that the main pur-
pose of forest restoration should be to 
promote working ecosystems. People 
with some college or graduate school 
education were more likely to agree 
with this statement than people who 
only completed high school. Urban 
residents were more likely to agree 
with this statement than rural resi-
dents. When we designed the question 
we intended "working ecosystems" to 
be synonymous with "functioning" or 
"natural ecosystems." However, a rea-
sonable interpretation by respondents 
could have been that a "working eco-
system" is a commercially productive 
forest. A follow-up statement was that 
"forest restoration efforts should be 
used to help recover plant and animal 
species that are rare and endangered." 
Seventy-four (74.2) percent agreed 
with this statement. We interpret this 
to support our assumption that the 
term "working" means to function as 
an ecosystem. Urban residents were 
more likely to agree with this state-
ment than rural residents. 
In one strategy of restoration a sig-
nificant portion of ponderosa pine 
trees are removed before fire is 
reintroduced. Respondents were split 
on this issue, with 38.7% agreeing 
with the statement "I would support 
forest restoration even if most trees, 
large and small, were removed" and 
48.3% disagreeing. Rural respondents 
were more likely to disagree with this 
statement than urban respondents. 
Continuing this line of analysis we  
 
asked about removing large trees in 
general. One obstacle to implementing 
restoration plans is a debate over 
diameter caps. A 40-cm diameter cap 
(i.e., a prohibition on cutting trees 
over 40 cm in diameter at breast 
height) is often advocated by groups 
and 
individuals 
opposed 
to 
the 
removal 
of 
large 
trees 
during 
restoration efforts. Fifty-five (55.2) 
percent of north-central Arizonan 
respondents 
disagreed 
with 
the 
statement that "large trees should 
never be removed in restoration 
efforts" and 30.5% agreed. Though a 
majority accepts large tree removal, 
the minority has a strong political 
voice. 
For 
instance, 
an 
early 
ponderosa pine restoration effort in the 
Flagstaff region was amended to 
restrict cutting trees over 40 cm in 
diameter, despite the fact that large 
trees are not necessarily old trees and 
that, more importantly, the USFS and 
many researchers agree that some 
large trees need to be removed for 
structural restoration of an area 
(Ghiotto 2000, USFS 2000). Rural 
residents were more likely to disagree 
with 
this 
statement 
than 
urban 
residents. 
We also sought to determine public 
perceptions of the ultimate manage-
ment requirements of a restored forest. 
That is, does the public agree that the 
forest should be thinned only once and 
then allowed to go wild? A strong 
61.5% disagreed with this approach, 
implying that the forest should not be 
allowed to "go wild." We infer that the 
public expects forest management 
activities to continue to shape ponde-
rosa pine ecosystems into the future. 
Rural residents were more likely to 
disagree with this statement than 
urban 
residents. 
One 
potential 
confounding variable in this question 
is the term "wild." Our intention was 
that 
wild 
is 
synonymous

A follow-up statement sheds light 
on the issue: "we should allow natural 
areas to evolve as they will without 
any intervention." Fifty (50.8) percent 
of north-central Arizonans surveyed 
disagreed with this statement and 34.6 
% agreed. Slightly more than half of 
north-central Arizona respondents 
agreed that the forest should not be 
left 
unmanaged. 
People 
who 
completed high school were more 
likely to agree with this statement 
than people with some college or 
graduate school education. At the 
same time, nearly half (49.3%) of 
residents believed that restoration will 
help us "control nature," while 28.4% 
disagreed. People with a high school  
education or who completed 
some  college  were  more likely to 
 
agree with this statement than those 
who attended graduate school, and 
rural residents were more likely to 
agree than urban residents. Our 
interpretation is that "control" is 
equated with "manage" and that a bare 
majority of the public in north-central 
Arizona expects continued human 
activity and intervention in Arizona 
forests. 
Discussion and 
Management Implications 
Our survey results show that north-
central Arizonans believe that forest 
fuel loads must be reduced. A 
majority view "restoration" as active 
management that includes more than 
fire risk reduction. In   fact,  87.1 % 
 
 
agreed 
that 
restoration 
means 
restoring 
"working 
ecosystems." 
Strong support for the idea that 
restoration should promote "working 
ecosystems," combined with strong 
support for the idea that restoration 
should recover rare and endangered 
species, 
suggests 
that 
most 
north-central Arizonans see restora-
tion as restoring forest structure, 
function, and composition rather than 
as 
synonymous 
with 
fire 
risk 
reduction. Our survey results indicate 
that the public is divided, however, on 
issues such as whether appropriate 
restoration involves removing large 
trees or removing most trees both 
large and small. This highlights 
challenges faced by managers and 
practitioners     in    implementing

Table 3. Responses to survey questions on local perceptions of forest restoration in north-central Arizona. To define "the public," chi-square 
comparisons are reported on two demographic categories that revealed significant differences: highest education level achieved and urban 
vs. rural residence. "Highest education" compares respondents with a high school education to those with at least some college or graduate 
school experience. Strongly agree and agree were pooled together (SA/A), as were strongly disagree and disagree (SD/D). Respondents 
reported an average of 15.5 years of formal education completed (n = 673, SD = 3.01). All percentages are within 5% with a confidence level 
of 95%.

restoration projects that dramatically 
change the appearance of restored sites 
(see Friederici 2003). 
Nearly a third (31.7%) of respondents 
agreed that the purpose of restoration is to 
protect humans from fire, and nearly half 
agreed that restoration will help humans 
to control nature. This view is particularly 
strong among rural residents, who are 
likely to experience greater personal risks 
from forest fires. Rural residents are also 
more likely to support continued active 
management of the forest and the removal 
of large trees. Rural residents were less 
likely to agree that restoration should 
promote working ecosystems and less 
likely than urban residents to support 
restoration as a means to recover 
endangered species. But rural residents 
were also less likely to support the 
removal of most trees, suggesting a high 
value for the aesthetic quality of the 
forest. We infer that they are accustomed 
to relatively dense forest stands and thus 
may have difficulty perceiving a heavily 
thinned forest as a "healthy" forest. The 
fact that many respondents accept that 
restoration will change the appearance of 
the forest suggests that the USFS and 
organizations 
like 
the 
Ecological 
Research 
Institute 
are 
successfully 
communicating 
the 
implications 
of 
restoration. However, this reference 
condition is not necessarily favored by 
those living within or near current forests. 
Respondents with some college or 
graduate school education are less likely 
to support the concept that restoration will 
help us control nature (i.e., the biocentric 
notion that nature controls itself). This is 
consistent with other studies (Vaske et al. 
2001), but those with higher levels of 
education were also less supportive of 
"allowing natural areas to evolve without 
human intervention."    The   apparent 
S 
March 2008 ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION 26:1      
 57

contradiction between believing that 
people cannot control nature with 
restoration, but should intervene in 
natural area evolution merits further 
investigation. 
While over 60% believe that resto-
ration involves thinning, prescribed 
burning, and either reintroducing/ 
preserving native species or eradicat-
ing invasives, 34.6% said that natural 
areas should be allowed to evolve 
"without any intervention." Further-
more, 16.4% of respondents selected 
"prescribed fire but no thinning" or 
"neither prescribed fire nor thinning," 
suggesting that they believe mechani-
cal treatment is not part of restoration. 
These numbers are strong enough to 
indicate a significant portion of the 
public prefers to "let nature go wild." 
We believe further investigation would 
reveal that acceptance of letting nature 
manage itself depends on the state of 
the forest. This conclusion is consistent 
with Brunson and Shindler's (2004) 
study of opinions on fuel reduction in 
four western states, where large 
majorities 
supported 
active 
management to reduce fuels, but nearly 
half agreed that "following nature's 
way 
is 
preferable 
to 
human 
intervention in ecosystems." Likewise, 
Shindler et al. (2002) found that very 
small numbers of respondents believed 
letting nature "take its course" was 
appropriate in depleted or overstocked 
forest conditions, but up to 42% felt it 
was appropriate under "healthy" forest 
conditions. 
It 
is 
possible 
that 
respondents in the present study 
support "no intervention" as an option 
for currently healthy forests but would 
support 
active 
management 
of 
degraded forests. We encourage more 
research into public perceptions of the 
current state of forest health as well as 
social 
preferences 
for 
tradeoffs 
between maintaining dense forest con-
ditions and the risk of catastrophic, 
stand-replacing wildfire. 
Questions designed to measure the 
purpose of restoration and what may be 
the acceptable effects of restoration 
received neutral responses ranging 
from 12 to 22% (with the exception of 
the "working ecosystems" question). 
Our interpretation is that while a solid 
proportion of the public is aware of 
restoration and the actions of the USFS 
in north-central Arizona, more work 
can be done to communicate the 
intentions 
of 
the 
restoration 
community. 
The findings here suggest that the 
public in north-central Arizona is 
diverse, but generally supports forest 
management that provides for more 
than just fuels reduction. In the end, 
however, we still must ask how much 
"good fire" can the public tolerate? 
Will the goal to restore ponderosa pine 
forests justify the five National Forests 
in Arizona producing smoke and 
flames on 20,000-48,000 hectares per 
year indefinitely? Our results indicate 
that public perceptions and opinion 
have shifted to include a basic under-
standing of restoration principles and 
goals. There is every reason to hope 
that we can continue the trend of public 
support to restore processes, function, 
and species composition across the 
Southwest.
