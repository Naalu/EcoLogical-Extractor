ABSTRACT: Small patch cutting (1 ha in size) in mature lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas var.
latifolia Engelmann) stands has been introduced in central British Columbia, Canada to slow the spread of
mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopk.) populations. This practice is locally referred to as
“Snip and Skid” logging. This article addresses the operational challenges of implementing the method,
with an emphasis on the cost of each phase of logging. Total stump-to-truck expenses incurred with Snip and
Skid logging in each patch at an average of C$17.00/m3 (C$14.98 to C$19.71/m3). However, if one includes
other cost allowances, such as overhead and profit for the logging contractor, the overall cost is
C$22.28/m3. These costs greatly increase when trees are smaller. Other costs for implementing the Snip and
Skid method, such as planning and layout, ground probing, and baiting, further increase the total cost of
implementation. Walking and low-bedding, that are not required for typical timber-production logging
operations, accounted for 57% of the total delay in Snip and Skid logging. In this particular study, five trees
were damaged per 100 m along the skid trails created to access the patches, but we found no high stumps
or significant impacts on soils. West. J. Appl. For. 20(2):128–133.
Key Words: Forest health, lodgepole pine, logging costs, skidding productivity.
The mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae
Hopk.) is the most destructive forest insect in British Co-
lumbia (BC) (van Sickle 1995). Large outbreaks in the
north-central interior of BC frequently develop in dense
stands of large-diameter, mature lodgepole pine (Pinus con-
torta Douglas var. latifolia Engelmann), which accounts for
more than 50% of the growing stock in BC’s interior (Task
Force 2000). Recently, the largest epidemic of mountain
pine beetle in the province’s history has spread over an area
of more than 5.7 million ha, creating a state of emergency in
BC’s west-central interior (Task Force 2000). These epi-
demics greatly influence harvest scheduling and manage-
ment priorities, as one must control the spread of the beetles
and quickly harvest infested timber over wide areas.
The current control strategies of controlling the spread of
mountain pine beetle in BC include felling and burning,
pesticides, single-tree sanitation harvesting, partial cutting
in small patches, and large clearcuts (Ministry of Forests
2000). The most common methods being used are large
clearcuts and small patch cuts. Large clearcuts employ
conventional logging practices in a form of salvage harvest-
ing and are used in severely infested areas to reduce large
beetle populations. The cost of implementing large clearcuts
is similar to any timber production harvest operation. Fell-
ing and burning is a commonly used tactic for killing the
beetles in remote locations; the cost ranges between
C$45–C$99 per tree. Debarking is a less common and more
expensive (C$75–C$150 per tree) method for killing bee-
tles. Treatment with a pesticide (Monosodium Methanear-
sonate; MSMA) has been quite popular; however, its use is
under environmental review in BC. Although an MSMA
treatment is generally cheaper than other single tree treat-
ments, such as debarking and felling and burning, it must be
conducted during a 4-week period in which the host and
pine beetle are most susceptible.
The harvesting of numerous small (1 ha) patches that
are scattered over a large area is termed “Snip and Skid.”
This approach involves luring the adult beetles into trees
within a small patch that has been baited with a synthetic

pheromone attractant (trans-verbenol and exo-brevicomin)
during the spring and summer, then destroying the insects
by harvesting and processing both the baited and the pre-
viously infested trees during the winter. This approach is
used to control the spread of beetle populations at the
beginning stage of infestation. The initial infestation is
detected by identifying red-colored trees from flying over
lodgepole pine stands. Regional regulations have been
largely reduced as Snip and Skid logging needs a time span
of no more than 6 months to be successful in controlling the
spread of beetles. The BC Ministry of Forests may exempt
the plan requirements for forest development, access devel-
opment, and silvicultural prescription in an attacked area,
providing the attack is confirmed by on-ground surveys and
that no more than 5,000 m3 of timber is harvested, exclud-
ing any timber removed for road access.
Although the Snip and Skid method has been routinely
used to control the spread of mountain pine beetle infesta-
tion in this region, little information is available to describe
its detailed procedures and associated issues, such as log-
ging costs and the impact on the environment. Past obser-
vations have indicated that expenses are typically higher
compared with conventional timber harvest operations be-
cause increased nonproductive time (or delays) and longer
skidding distance. Snip and Skid logging requires signifi-
cant time to move equipment between small patches scat-
tered over a large area. The distances between patches vary,
ranging from 1 km to 10 km. The most common harvest-
ing system for Snip and Skid logging is a mechanized
system, consisting of a feller-buncher, grapple skidder, pro-
cessor, and loader. Each machine must be moved to the next
patch location when one patch is completed, requiring con-
siderable time for relocation of each machine. Equipment is
either self-propelled or transported using a low-bed to the
next patch. This is nonproductive time (or a delay) that is
unnecessary with larger clearcut blocks where all logging
activities take place in one location.
The small, wide-spread patches are often located far
from existing forest roads, requiring longer skidding dis-
tances to access each baited patch. High-quality planning
and layout is critical to minimize skidding distance. Trees
on proposed skid trails need to be removed to allow ma-
chinery access to baited and infested trees. However, the
total volume extracted from one patch and the access skid
trail is often less than one truckload. Snip and Skid logging
costs are typically high due to the combined effect of
increased nonproductive time for machine movement, long
skid trails, increased low-bedding costs, and small harvest
volume from each patch. There have been no previous
studies determining how much more costly Snip and Skid
logging is compared to the logging cost for a conventional
timber-production operation. In addition to logging cost
(stump-to-truck), implementing Snip and Skid method re-
quires other costs, including planning and administration
(C$0.42/m3), ground probing (C$0.24/m3), layout with a
global positioning systems (GPS) (C$1.55/m3), baiting
(C$6.00 per bait plus deployment cost), and cruising for
larger patches (C$1.09/m3) (Dunham, 2001). Ninety-four
percent of the forestland in BC is held in trust by the
provincial government and 1% by the federal government
(Land and Water British Columbia Inc.; Available at
www.lwbc.bc.ca/02land/index.html. Accessed by the author
November 4, 2004), and the increased costs of implement-
ing the method result in reduced revenue to the BC govern-
ment, which charges a fee, often called as “stumpage,” for
any timber harvested. The fee is determined by then-current
market value of timber minus all the production costs in-
curred to deliver the timber to the mill thus increased cost
means lower stumpage rates.
There are certain requirements for logging contractors to
meet in relation to Snip and Skid logging: skid trail width,
damage to remaining trees, and stump heights. Although
trees must be removed on the skid trails to gain access to
designated patches, trail widths have to be minimized. For
example, the Prince George Forest District (in north central
BC) allows the average trail to be no more than 6 m wide.
Damage to the residual trees along skid trails and patches
should be avoided. Han and Kellogg (2000) have shown that
trail width is highly correlated with residual stand damage:
damage to the remaining trees was increased with a de-
crease of the width of skid trails. The risk of leaving beetles
in a stand is minimized if stump heights are kept as low as
possible, and if the harvested stems are used to a 10-cm top
diameter (Safranyik et al. 1974). Lower stumps, i.e., 30
cm high, can be easily accomplished through feller-buncher
felling (Hall and Han 2004).
The objectives of this study were: (1) to determine the
actual logging costs of Snip and Skid operations; (2) to
quantify and categorize delays which are unique to the Snip
and Skid method; and (3) to describe the impacts of Snip
and Skid logging on soils and residual trees along skid trails
and patches.
Methods
We selected 29 small (0.01- to 0.80-ha) patches that were
sparsely distributed on the Mt. Mackenzie Management
Area, approximately 65 km northwest of Prince George, BC
(Figure 1 and Table 1). Stands in this area are even-aged,
with an average age of 113 years and a range in dbh of 20
to 32 cm. The dominant species is lodgepole pine (72%),
with a minor component of Douglas-fir (15%; Pseudotsuga
menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), white spruce (12%; Picea glauca
(Moench.) Voss.), and subalpine fir (0.5%; Abies lasiocarpa
(Hook.) Nutt.). Basal area in this area ranges from 30 to 45
m2 per ha, with an average stand density of 570 to 1,200
trees per ha. Slopes are 15%, with a few exceptions in
isolated areas. Snow accumulation at the time of harvesting
was less than 50 cm within the stands, and could not be
considered a factor in the decision to leave high stumps. In
each patch, the lodgepole pine trees were baited with a
synthetic pheromone to attract beetles.
During the winter of 2000–2001, one logging contractor
was selected by the forest company licensee to remove the
trees via whole-tree harvesting. Stems were felled with a
Madill 3200B feller-buncher and skidded to the landings by
either a John Deere 748G rubber-tired skidder or a Cat 527

track skidder. The latter was used for forwarding in steep,
uphill, or broken-slope areas. Tree-length logs were pro-
cessed with a Cat 320 stroke boom delimber equipped with
a Limmit processing head. When the volume of wood at a
particular landing was greater than five truckloads, a Madill
3800LL butt’ n top (grapple) loader was used. Otherwise, a
self-loading truck picked up smaller amounts in isolated
locations. Landings were located by existing roads or in
recently harvested areas to minimize additional clearing of
trees for landing (Figure 1).
A low-bed trailer was used to move equipment between
patch locations when the distance between patches was
around 5 to 6 km. The low-bed was fully occupied with its
task throughout the logging operations because patches

were scattered over a large area. The low-bed was owned by
the contractor, allowing for a higher level of cooperation
with other machine operators, largely due to a long-term
working relationship between the operators. The machines
were walked between closer patch locations (5 km). One
foreman coordinated the equipment allocation for each site
to minimize nonproductive time taken for these moves. Skid
trails were identified from the existing roads nearest each
patch: no new access roads and landings were built. The
felled trees were skidded to the nearest landing area, which
is typically an open space on the existing roads or recent
clearcut. A small, portable bridge served as a temporary
stream crossing when necessary.
We used a handheld computer (DAP Microflex PC9800)
to collect production data for the feller-buncher and skidder
operations, as well as information about slopes, trees per
turn, tree length, and skidding distance. The nonproductive
time spent for low-bedding and walking between patches
was recorded as a delay for each machine, as noted in
detailed and shift-level data forms. Productivity for process-
ing and loading was based on shift-level data forms filled in
by the machine operators.
During the spring of 2001, a postharvest survey was
conducted to measure skid-trail widths, using an interval of
10 m to calculate the average. We also assessed residual
stand damage, looking at scarring damage (removal of bark
down to the cambium layer). Because the total population
was unknown, the level of damage was recorded as the
number of injured trees per 100 m of skid trail. Finally, we
tallied the number of high stumps, i.e., those taller than 30
cm, for each patch and skid trail.
Results and Discussion
Harvesting Productivity
A total of 6,492 m3 of timber was harvested from the 29
patches and their associated skid trails, accounting for 136
truckloads. Seventeen landing locations were used, with
each landing accommodating one to five patches (Table 1).
Average volume harvested from each landing location was
381 m3. The delay-free cycle time for felling and bunching
averaged 0.53 min per tree, and operators produced 30.05
m3 during each scheduled machine hour, for an average of
0.66 m3 per tree.
A regression model was developed from this detailed
study to predict the delay-free cycle time for skidding
(Table 2). The number of trees per cycle, slope, and tree
length did not significantly affect total cycle time (P 
0.05). Average maximum skidding distance to all patches
was 415 m, resulting in a skidding cycle time (12.43 min.)
that was approximately three times longer than a typical
timber-production operation (Tufts et al.1988; Mitchell
1994; Keegan et al. 1995). The cycle time was reduced by
56 seconds if the track skidder was used for forwarding. The
skidder operator was often required to gather small bunches
into a full load. This accumulation occurred in 61% of the
total cycles observed (n  185), with an average time of
1.36 min. Neither processing nor loading productivity dif-
fered greatly from logging operations where timber produc-
tion is the primary objective, except for the extra walking
and low-bedding time required because of the scattered
decks of wood. Heavy traffic on logging roads also raised
safety issues during roadside operations.
Harvesting Costs
The stump-to-truck cost averaged C$17.00/m3, including
expenses for low-bedding and coordination (Table 1). How-
ever, if overhead and profit allowances were included, the
overall cost of Snip and Skid logging rose to C$22.28/m3.
These values were based on an average tree volume of 0.66
m3, and, being greatly sensitive to size, would significantly
increase with smaller trees (Figure 2). For example, an
average stem size of 0.80 m3 translated to an overall cost of
C$21.20/m3; a lower tree volume, e.g., 0.3 m3, would bring
the total up to C$29.50/m3. Thus the Snip and Skid method
was much more expensive than a typical timber-production,
ground-based operation that has its costs ranging from
C$12.00 to C$17.50/m3 around the study area (Spence
2001).
The Madill 3200B feller-buncher had an hourly fixed
and variable cost of C$141.44, and felling cost ranged from
C$2.20 to C$5.73/m3 (average $3.22/m3). The hourly rate
for the Cat 527 track skidder was higher (C$137.58) than for
the John Deere 748G rubber-tired skidder (C$100.40). Skid-
ding was the most expensive component in stump-to-truck
costing, averaging C$4.48/m3. The skidding costs in the
Table 1 were based on the John Deere 748G skidder since
this machine was used more than 90% of the skidding
operations because of its high speed. Processing and loading
costs, based on the shift-level form, averaged at C$3.55/m3
and C$3.09/m3, respectively. The total time spent on low-
bedding was 71 hours for a cost of C$1.12/m3. This value
might have increased significantly if the job had been sub-
contracted because of the inherent higher contract rates and
increased delays that could result from less efficient team-
work (Spence 2001). Low-bedding and machine moves
between patches in this study were considered highly effi-
cient due to their long-term work experience within one
company.

Delays and Coordinating Machine Allocations
The tracked machines (feller-buncher, track skidder, pro-
cessor and loader) had lower traveling speeds and were not
designed to travel for a long distance. These machines were
transported to the next site using a low-bed if a distance
between patch locations was greater than 5 km. The ma-
chine walked to the next patch location if the distance was
less than 5 km. The processes of walking and low-bedding
represented 57% of the total delay (22% of its scheduled
machine hours) in Snip and Skid logging (Table 3), and had
a large impact on overall harvesting productivity. Detailed
timing revealed small delays (10 min.) during felling
(8.2%) and skidding (9%), which increased the total delays
to 36.6% and 25.8%, respectively. The walking (9.3%) and
bedding (3.2%) delays could be translated to an increase of
operational cost of C$2.13/m3 in Snip and Skid harvesting
method. This additional cost would not occur with typical
production logging operations that do not require such fre-
quent equipment movement and transportation between
patches. For tracked machines, prolonged walking on hard
road surfaces may increase maintenance and repair costs
because it shortens the life of the track, undercarriage,
machine body, and other attachments. We observed that,
when possible, machine operators attempted to walk on the
snow piled next to the road to minimize the impacts on
tracks and machine body. Compared with other crawler-
type machines, walking time for the rubber-tired skidder
had less effect on its productivity because it was able to
travel at higher speeds
A foreman at the study site maintained good communi-
cations with the machine operators, including the low-bed,
and assisted them in moving to the next patch, minimizing
relocation delays. The planning and layout for Snip and
Skid logging was prepared by the licensee during spring and
summer, 3 to 6 months before Snip and Skid logging
actually took place. Open, clear, and concise communica-
tion between a licensee and the logging contractor is also
essential to high operations efficiency. For example, the
feller-buncher was required to move back into an area
adjacent to where timber had previously been felled in the
winter. This unnecessary low-bedding could have been
avoided if the contractor had known in advance which
patches were to be harvested. Likewise, highly visible flag-
ging and clear mapping are required if the machine operator
is to avoid wasting time looking for entrances to the skid
trails and patches. This should be emphasized to the crews
who conduct field layout and marking of patches.
Postharvesting Survey: Skid Trail Width, Stand
Damage, and High Stumps
A total of 17 skid trails (5,974 m) were used, some more
than once, to access all the small patches. New skid trails, as
created by the clearing of trees, represented 59% (3,520 m)
of the total length; the remainder ran through areas opened
in recently clearcut blocks. The average width for each new
skid trail ranged from 4.4 to 6.5 m; however, only three of
the 17 trails were beyond the maximum allowed (6 m).
Stand density (trees/ha) varied between locations, and af-
fected on the final width of the particular skid trail.
We found 177 trees scarred along 3,520 m of skid trails,
i.e., five stems per 100 m. Scars averaged 13.0 to 20.4 cm
wide and 34.6 to 68.6 cm long. Damage was found right
along the skid trails and most scars faced in that direction,
indicating that skidding was the primary cause. The inci-
dence of scarring also increased with narrower, curved

trails. No damage was observed on the boundary trees of
harvested patches.
In all patches and along each skid trail, every stump was
30 cm high; most were cut close to ground level. This
confirms that high stumping is not an inevitable conse-
quence of mechanized felling, and that this type of logging
can help reduce the risk of leaving beetles behind. In addi-
tion, the combination of snow and frozen conditions meant
that winter logging was effective in protecting soils from
damage caused by repeated skidding.
Conclusion
Snip and Skid logging is used to control the spread of
remote outbreaks of mountain pine beetle by removing the
pest and infected hosts (lodgepole pine trees) in BC. Com-
pared with a normal harvesting operation, in which timber
production is the primary objective, production rates were
significantly lower from each type of machinery used in
Snip and Skid logging. This was mainly due to the increase
in nonproductive time spent while equipment was moved
between small patches scattered over a large area. Walking
and low-bedding, two activities that do not occur with
regular harvests, accounted for 57% of the total delay. The
long skidding distances also contributed to lower produc-
tivity and higher costs, which were 30.3 to 85.7% higher
than those incurred by the conventional logging methods
used locally. Total stump-to-truck expenses at each location

C$17.00/m3). However, this value would have increased to
C$22.28/m3 if we had included overhead and profit allow-
ances for logging contractors. Other costs for implementing
the Snip and Skid method, such as planning and layout,
ground probing and baiting, further increase the total cost of
implementing Snip and Skid method. This results in re-
duced revenue to the BC government because the govern-
ment owns 94% of forestlands and charges a fee for timber
harvested. Tree size was an important factor, with costs
increasing as stem diameters decreased. Scarring was often
found on sharp curves, increasing along the lower sides of
sloping skid trails. The frequency of damage was calculated
at five trees per 100 m of skid trail, which might have been
minimized through more careful planning and layouts. We
also observed that mechanized felling and winter logging
could be conducted without increased concerns for high
stumps and soil disturbances.
