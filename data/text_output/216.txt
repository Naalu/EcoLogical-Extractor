ABSTRACT 
REFERENCE CONDITIONS AND SPATIAL DYNAMICS 
 
IN A SOUTHWESTERN DRY MIXED-CONIFER FOREST 
 
KYLE RODMAN 
 
 
Structural conditions in southwestern “frequent-fire” forests, or forests that have a 
history of frequent, low-severity fire, have changed considerably since Euro-American 
settlement (ca. late 1800's); these changes are primarily due to excessive livestock 
grazing, extractive logging, road construction, and organized fire suppression. As a result 
of these land-use changes, forest densities in many locations have increased, contributing 
to increases in fire size and severity and alterations to ecosystem function. A recognition 
of these impacts has prompted interest in forest restoration treatments across broad 
swaths of the landscape. Forest restoration attempts to mimic the natural range of 
variability - or the structure and function inherent to intact natural ecosystems - but many 
aspects of these ecosystems are poorly understood. In combination with studies of the 
natural disturbance regime, reference conditions and studies of the natural range of 
variability also provide an ecological basis for silvicultural treatments. Spatial pattern, or 
the horizontal distribution of trees, is an important component of the natural range of 
variability and influences a wide array of ecological processes. 
 
With this study, we reconstructed historical structure (density and spatial pattern) 
and species composition for four dry mixed-conifer stands on the Mogollon Rim, 

 
iii 
 
Arizona, USA. We reconstructed conditions from the year 1879, the time of the 
widespread cessation of fire in the area. We found that these forests showed evidence of 
increased tree density between 1879 and 2014 with major increases in density in the 
smaller size classes. During this time period, the number of live trees ha-1 increased from 
an average of 129.5 to 744.3, basal area increased from 10.1 to 41.9 m2 ha-1, and mean 
canopy cover increased from 14.8 to 54.7 percent. Our results also showed shifts in 
species composition to a higher relative proportion of Abies concolor, and Pseudotsuga 
menziesii, and a lower relative proportion of Pinus ponderosa and Quercus gambelii. 
Mean group size, or the average number of trees in explicit tree groups, also increased as 
tree canopy cover became more continuous. Finally, we investigated the roles of different 
species groups within fine-scale spatial pattern. Species groups showed distinctly 
different patterns, suggesting that the patterns of individual species are an important 
consideration during the implementation of silvicultural treatments that are meant to 
mimic natural patterns and processes. Mechanical treatments and thinning operations in 
dry mixed-conifer forests on the Mogollon Rim should target an aggregated spatial 
structure of leave trees with a range of group sizes within a given site. Treatments based 
on the natural range of variability are likely to increase resistance and resilience of these 
ecosystems in the face of uncertain future conditions.

Table 3.3: Summaries of tree density and size metrics for study sites on the  
Mogollon Rim, AZ, USA following dendrochronological reconstruction of  
1879 and in 2014. All metrics are provided for trees > 5cm diameter at  
breast height (DBH, 1.37m). Canopy cover is given as the percent of the  
total site covered by the vertical projection of tree crown. Reineke’s stand  
density index (SDI; Reineke 1933) is a commonly-used measure of stand  
density that gives the number of 25.4 cm (DBH) trees ha-1 that would be  
present on a site of equivalent density. SDI is given in metric values.  
Maximum SDI values (metric) for Pinus ponderosa-,Pseudotsuga  
menziesii-, and Populus trumuloides-dominated stands are approximately  
1100, 1450, and 1600 respectively (Shaw and Long 2010)..………............................... 121

membership was determined for each tree using two different patch- 
delineation methods 1) trees within 6m of another tree (pith to pith) were  
considered to be part of the same group (designated “6m Fixed”) following  
Larson and Churchill (2008), and 2) trees with overlapping crowns are  
considered to be part of the same group (designated “Crown”) following  
Lydersen et al. (2013). Summary statistics were calculated based on group  
designation. Single trees do not belong to a group, small groups were 2-4  
trees, large groups were 5 are more trees..…………………........................................... 122

are given as the percent of row total, or percent of a given species (for both  
trees and basal area, independently) being isolated individual trees,  
members of small groups (2-4 trees) or members of large groups (5 or  
more trees). Chi-square analysis of cell counts for individual trees revealed  
that species affects the likelihood of a given tree being an isolated individual,  
part of a small group, or part of a large group (X2=44.45, p<0.0001).Values  
in parentheses are the results of cell-wise post-hoc analysis. These numbers, 
 standardized Pearson residuals, indicate relative departure and distance  
from expected values in a given cell. Negative vlues indicate that fewer  
individuals (than expected) were present in a given group size class,  
positive values indicate the opposite trend. Greater distance from zero  
indicates greater relative departure from expected values. We only  
performed these analyses for species that have at least two trees in each  
group size-class.………………………………………………………………………... 123

confidence envelopes for complete spatial randomness (CSR). Envelopes  
are based on 999 Monte Carlo simulations of a random Poisson point  
process. Deviations above the confidence envelope suggest aggregation at  
a given scale while deviations below the envelope suggest uniformity at a  
given scale. Significant deviations from the envelope were determined 
using the Diggle, Cressie, Loosmore, and Ford (DCLF; Baddeley and  
Turner 2005) goodness of fit test. If p-values for this test were less than  
0.05, we also fit a Matérn cluster model to the observed pattern. Dashed  
lines are a 95% confidence envelope of these models (based on 999  
simulations). Mean patch area (for a given pattern) is based on the mean  
patch radius parameter from these fitted models………………………………………. 129

This thesis is written in a “manuscript format”, a format endorsed by the Northern 
Arizona University School of Forestry and the Northern Arizona University Graduate 
College. Chapter 3 is formatted for direct submission and eventual publication in the 
peer-reviewed journal Ecological Applications. For this reason, I also use the term “we” 
instead of “I” throughout the text; upon submission, this manuscript will have multiple 
authors. There may be some repetition and redundancy of information between chapters. 
Chapter 3 is intended to “stand alone”, but greater detail on relevant literature and 
implications to land management can be found in Chapters 2 and 4 respectively.

Chapter 1 
Introduction 
 
Ecological patterns and process are closely related and interact at multiple spatial 
scales (Urban et al. 1987, Turner 1989, Levin 1992); therefore, a shift in the structure of 
an ecosystem is likely to cause substantial changes to its ecological function. Overstory 
forest conditions and spatial pattern (the horizontal distribution of trees) are known to 
exert strong control over conditions in the understory, including light infiltration 
(Battaglia et al. 2002), species composition (Bigelow et al. 2011), understory diversity 
and productivity (Laughlin et al. 2006, Moore et al. 2006), tree recruitment (Sánchez 
Meador et al. 2009), water availability (O'Hara and Nagel 2006, Dore et al. 2012), and 
the variability of fuels and associated fire behavior (Thaxton and Platt 2006, Fry and 
Stephens 2010). Frequent-fire ecosystems in the West exhibited, historically, a 
heterogeneous structure that led to functional diversity at fine-, intermediate-, and coarse-
scales (Larson and Churchill 2012, Reynolds et al. 2013). At the fine-scale (< 4ha extent), 
forests had a mix of individual trees and groups of trees with interlocking crowns, 
discrete openings, and grassy interspaces (Larson and Churchill 2012, Reynolds et al. 
2013). At the intermediate-scale (4-400 ha extent; hereafter referred to as “stand-scale”), 
trees could be arranged in an aggregated spatial distribution (trees tending to grow in 
groups), a random spatial distribution, or, less commonly, in a uniform spatial 
distribution (evenly spaced) (Abella and Denton 2009, Reynolds et al. 2013). At a coarse-
scale (> 400 ha extent; hereafter referred to as the “landscape-scale”), forests probably 

 
2 
 
had a variety of densities, seral stages, and species compositions. These differences were 
based on disturbance history, aspect, slope position, soils, and many other factors (Evans 
et al. 2011, Reynolds et al. 2013). 
 
Land use changes following Euro-American settlement in the southwestern 
United States excluded fire from many frequent-fire forests, altering local tree carrying 
capacities (Bond et al. 2005) and increasing rates of recruitment (Covington and Moore 
1994, Jones 1994, Mast et al. 1999, Allen et al. 2002). This, in turn, led to dramatic 
increases in forest density, shifts in species composition to a greater proportion of shade-
tolerant and fire-intolerant species (in mixed-species forests), and decreases in average 
nearest neighbor distance (Cooper 1960, Covington and Moore 1994, Fulé et al. 2002, 
Sánchez Meador et al. 2009). Pure ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and pine-oak 
(Pinus ponderosa/Quercus gambelii) forests have deviated most substantially from their 
natural conditions, but these changes have also occurred in some mixed-conifer forests 
(Cocke et al. 2005). Mixed-conifer forests lie between ponderosa pine forests (typically a 
frequent, low-severity fire regime) and spruce-fir forests (typically an infrequent, high-
severity fire regime) on a gradient of temperature and moisture (driven by elevation, 
aspect, and other factors; Evans et al. 2011). Forest structural changes over the last 150 
years are more pronounced in the lower warm/dry mixed-conifer forests (hereafter 
referred to “dry” mixed-conifer) than the cool/wet mixed-conifer forests due to a 
comparatively greater deviation from the natural disturbance regime (Mast and Wolf 
2006, Romme et al. 2009, Evans et al. 2011). Southwestern dry mixed-conifer forests are 
typically dominated by Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum (Engelm.) with other tree 

 
3 
 
species present including: Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Mayr) Franco, Abies 
concolor var. concolor (Gordon) Lindley ex Hildebrand, Populus tremuloides Michx., 
Pinus strobiformis Engelm., Pinus flexilis E.James, and Quercus gambelii Nutt. (Romme 
et al. 2009, Evans et al. 2011, Reynolds et al. 2013).  
 
Dry mixed-conifer ecosystems are both complex and poorly understood 
(Reynolds et al. 2013), however, many of these forests are the target of forest 
management activities that aim to restore natural ecosystem structure and function (e.g. 
Four Forests Restoration Initiative, 4fri.org). Many southwestern dry mixed-conifer 
forests experienced fire regimes that were historically frequent, burning at least 25% of 
the landscape every 4-30 years (Dieterich 1983, Swetnam and Baisan 1996, Brown et al. 
2001, O’Connor et al. 2014, Huffman et al. 2015). These frequent, low-severity fire 
regimes maintained low forest densities, and the interruption of this process altered forest 
structure. Dendrochronological reconstructions and historical plot data suggest that 
overstory densities in these forests ranged 51-246 trees ha-1 and 9-28.5 m2 of basal area 
ha-1 in the late 1800's (Fulé et al. 2002, Matonis et al. 2013) and have increased by nearly 
one order of magnitude relative to historical densities. In recent years, these forests have 
been found to have as many as 1613 live trees ha-1 and as much as 51 m2 of basal area ha-
1 in the overstory (Heinlein et al. 2005). Mixed-conifer forests, as a whole, cover 
approximately 1,000,000 ha in the Southwest (Dieterich 1983), but this is probably a 
greater area than was present historically. Johnson (1994) found that the mixed-conifer 
cover type increased by about 400,000 hectares between 1962 and 1986, primarily due to 
the encroachment of shade-tolerant and mid-tolerant conifers into many pure Pinus 

 
4 
 
ponderosa and Populus tremuloides stands. 
 
Efforts to quantify forest structure and spatial heterogeneity can provide useful 
information to land managers both through greater knowledge of the natural range of 
variability (NRV: the range of conditions present in naturally functioning ecosystems; 
Swanson et al. 1994), and through an improved understanding of ecological processes 
such as disturbance dynamics (Thaxton and Platt 2006), competitive and facilitative 
interaction, and patch formation (Mast and Veblen 1999, Mast and Wolf 2004, Stephens 
and Fry 2005). An understanding of these factors allows managers to more closely align 
silviculture with the ecology of the areas being managed (O’Hara 2002). Multi-scaled 
heterogeneity, a common component of the structure of these ecosystems historically, is 
thought to increase ecosystem resistance and resilience (Larkin et al. 2006, O’Hara and 
Ramage 2013, Reynolds et al. 2013). These terms reflect the ability of ecosystems to 
experience disturbance with only minimal change to structure (resistance), or maintain 
similar functional attributes following disturbance (resilience; DeRose and Long 2014). 
Resistance and resilience are especially important in a rapidly changing environment in 
which fire occurrence and drought-related disturbance are increasing (Westerling et al. 
2006, Allen et al. 2010, Garfin et al. 2013). Lower stand densities and a heterogeneous 
forest structure allow ecosystems to better persist in an uncertain future (Fulé 2008) by 
reducing fire hazard (Stephens et al. 2009), and decreasing drought stress (O'Hara and 
Nagel 2006, Dore et al. 2012). Heterogeneity may also increase genetic diversity at the 
population level (Li et al. 2001, Huang et al. 2002) due to the presence of a wider range 
of environmental conditions in the understory (Meyer et al. 2001). This genetic diversity 

 
5 
 
may facilitate in-situ adaptation under uncertain future conditions (Hoffman and Sgrò 
2011). Forest management partially informed by the NRV is still relevant in light of these 
climatic changes because these natural structural conditions and disturbance regimes 
reflect the evolutionary history under which many current tree populations and forest 
communities have developed (Fulé 2008).  
 
Our study uses a combination of spatial analyses to quantify historical fine-scale 
heterogeneity in dry mixed-conifer forests of the Southwest, a recognized gap in 
scientific knowledge (Reynolds et al. 2013) that will help inform future land management 
strategies. The spatial and temporal relationships discussed in this study also help to 
describe inter and intraspecific competition and facilitation (e.g. Mast and Wolf 2004), 
ecological niche theory, and gap-partitioning in mixed-species forests (Canham 1989).
 
This study is primarily concerned with the spatial ecology and NRV of dry mixed-
conifer forests in the Southwest. Chapter two, a comprehensive literature review, covers: 
a) the importance of fine-scale and stand-scale spatial pattern in influencing ecosystem 
function, b) the factors that drive spatial pattern formation and maintenance in forests, c) 
the current state of knowledge regarding dry mixed-conifer forests in the Southwest, d) 
methods of identifying reference conditions and the NRV, and e) methods for quantifying 
spatial pattern. Chapter three describes a spatially explicit reconstruction of forest 
structure and composition for several forest stands in dry mixed-conifer ecosystems on 
the Mogollon Rim in central Arizona, USA. Chapter four provides an overview of results 
and conclusions from this study and other similar studies in the Southwest, specifically 
focusing on the implications of these findings to the management of public lands.

Chapter 2 
Literature Review of Southwestern Mixed-Conifer Forests and Spatial Dynamics  
 
 
Ecosystem pattern and ecological processes are intimately intertwined (Urban et 
al. 1987, Turner 1989), and species composition, vertical structure, density, and the 
horizontal spatial distribution of trees (hereafter referred to as spatial pattern) all play 
important roles in the ecological function of forested ecosystems (Oliver and Larson 
1996, Larson and Churchill 2012). Many aspects of ecosystem structure in frequent-fire 
forests of the southwestern United States have shifted quite considerably over the last 150 
years (Covington and Moore 1994, Cocke et al. 2005, Sánchez Meador et al. 2009, 
Sánchez Meador et al. 2010a, Reynolds et al 2013). Dry mixed-conifer forests lie at the 
upper range of these frequent-fire forests (on a gradient of elevation and moisture) in the 
Southwest. In the absence of widespread, low-severity fire (Swetnam and Baisan 1996), 
many dry mixed-conifer forests have had increases in density, shifts in composition to a 
greater proportion of shade-tolerant (and fire-intolerant) species (Heinlein et al. 2005, 
Fulé et al. 2009). As a result of these structural changes, many forests have become more 
susceptible to uncharacteristically severe wildfire (reviewed in Evans et al. 2011) and 
have experienced alterations to ecosystem function (reviewed in Reynolds et al. 2013). 
 
A combination of mechanical thinning treatments and prescribed fire has been 
proposed as a potential solution to these problems, and can, under all but the most 
extreme climatic conditions, be very effective in reducing the occurrence of severe 
wildfire in Southwestern forests (Fulé et al. 2001, Fulé et al. 2012). The nature of 

 
12 
 
silvicultural treatments has changed in recent years, as managers have begun to focus on 
uneven-aged management techniques (O'Hara 2002) that attempt to restore systems and 
mimic natural patterns of disturbance and regeneration (Franklin et al. 2002). Uneven-
aged management is also thought to decrease the susceptibility of many forests to 
disturbance (O’Hara and Ramage 2013). As stated by O'Hara (2002), “Successful 
uneven-aged management in the future will require practices that recognize the 
disturbance and stand dynamics of individual ecosystems and use these to guide 
management.” These concepts align well with the ideas of restoration ecology, using 
knowledge of the natural range of variability (NRV, the range of structure and function 
present in natural systems; Swanson et al. 1994) and disturbance dynamics to manage 
forest systems in ways that more closely mirror their evolutionary history. The natural 
stand structure (especially spatial pattern) and many aspects of the ecological function of 
dry mixed-conifer forests in the Southwest are not thoroughly understood (Reynolds et al. 
2013).  
 
In this review, I will discuss the ecological importance of spatial pattern, the 
environmental factors that influence forest spatial pattern, methods of identifying 
reference forest structure, methods of quantifying spatial patterns at multiple scales. 
Because of the relatively small number of studies (of this type) in the Southwest, I will 
also discuss our current state of knowledge regarding the NRV in dry mixed-conifer 
forests in the western United States.

Ecological Importance of Spatial Pattern 
 
Land managers often attempt to target “heterogeneity” in forest systems, because 
heterogeneity may increase ecosystem resistance and resilience to disturbance (Larkin et 
al. 2006, O’Hara and Ramage 2013). Resistance allows for the persistence of ecosystems 
(largely unchanged) following disturbance, while resilience allows forests to “absorb 
inevitable [disturbances] without fundamentally changing the system at the landscape 
scale” (DeRose and Long 2014). Unfortunately, heterogeneity is a relatively ambiguous 
term. It can be expressed at multiple scales (Reynolds et al. 2013), and in a variety of 
ways. In recent years, studies have attempted to quantify this heterogeneity in a way that 
can be explicitly incorporated into silvicultural treatments (Sánchez Meador et al. 2011, 
Churchill et al. 2013). Forest spatial pattern has long been recognized as a structural 
component of forests in the Southwest (see Cooper 1961), but an understanding of its 
ecological importance is still relatively new. Spatial pattern has a number of influences 
on climate change adaptation (both by species within forests and by humans reliant on 
them), the effects of fire and other disturbances, understory plant diversity and 
composition, tree regeneration, and wildlife habitat.  
 
Climate Change Adaptation 
 
Climate in the southwestern United States is becoming warmer and drier, and 
these changes are expected to continue in upcoming years (Seager et al. 2007, Garfin et 
al. 2013). Climate change-induced drought can lead to dramatic shifts in disturbance 
patterns and tree mortality (Westerling et al. 2006, Allen et al. 2010). These shifts in 

 
14 
 
climate and disturbance have already had noticeable ecological impacts on species 
phenologies and ranges (Walther et al. 2002). While the ability of many species to adapt 
to a changing climate is unknown, it is believed that a variety of micro-environmental 
conditions (like that provided by a spatially heterogeneous overstory, Meyer et al. 2001) 
may promote genotypic (Li et al. 2001, Huang et al. 2002) and phenotypic (Nicotra et al. 
2010, Laughlin et al. 2011, Auger and Shipley 2013) diversity within species. This 
diversity may facilitate future adaptation of plant species at the population level. Local 
adaptation is especially important when range shifts are not feasible because of 
topographic limitations or limitations of dispersal (Jump and Peñuelas 2005). 
 
Forests may also help to offset some of the immediate effects of climatic change, 
both through direct carbon sequestration in woody biomass (Marland and Shlamadinger 
1997) and through soil carbon storage (Lal 2005). In a study of spruce-dominated (Picea 
spp.) forests in New Brunswick, Canada, Wang et al. (2011) found that increases in 
structural diversity increased the potential for carbon storage. Additionally, in a review 
summarizing even-aged and uneven-aged management of ponderosa pine (Pinus 
ponderosa), O'Hara and Nagel (2006) found that uneven-aged stands with greater spatial 
variability exhibited less summer water stress and slightly higher growth efficiency than 
even-aged stands with less spatial variability. Battaglia et al. (2002) found that spatially 
aggregated overstories in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forests allowed greater overall 
light infiltration into the understory than evenly spaced thinning treatments with similar 
residual densities. This increase in resource availability was also shown to benefit 
seedling growth efficiency (Palik et al. 2003). 

 
15 
 
Disturbance Dynamics 
 
The spatial distribution of trees within forests can influence the effects of 
disturbance. In a study of Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi)-dominated mixed-conifer forests in 
Sierra San Pedro Martir, Mexico, Fry and Stephens (2010) found a strong relationship 
between overstory structure and the spatial distribution of fine fuels. Greater levels of 
fine fuels were associated with populations of Abies concolor, and lower levels of fine 
fuels were found near Pinus jeffreyi trees. The study suggests that the spatial pattern and 
species composition of the overstory can have important influences on variations in fine-
scale burn severity. In Pinus palustris forests in Louisiana, Thaxton and Platt (2006) 
demonstrated that variability in local fuel loading led to more heterogeneous burns. This 
fine-scale heterogeneity of disturbance resulted in greater understory species richness and 
diversity. Many fire-modeling projects (reviewed in Reynolds et al. 2013) indicate that 
heterogeneous forest canopies are less susceptible to active crown fire, instead forcing the 
fire to the surface after small flare-ups. Because forest restoration is often concerned with 
returning natural ecosystem function, understanding the effects of residual tree patterns 
on disturbance is of paramount importance. 
 
Spatial pattern can also affect the behavior of other disturbances beyond fire. In 
mixed-conifer forests in the Sierra Nevada, trees in dense groups die more frequently 
from insects and pathogens than do those in more open areas (Smith et al. 2005). Large 
trees also die more frequently than expected from these disturbances (Smith et al. 2005). 
Dwarf mistletoes (Arcuethobium spp.), common parasitic plants in Southwestern forests, 
tend to spread more quickly in open and uneven-aged forests, but more slowly through 

 
16 
 
dense groups of larger trees (Castello et al. 1995, Conklin and Fairweather 2010). This 
positive affect on spread may only be true up to a point because of limitations of dispersal 
(Mathiasen 1996). Western spruce budworm (Choristonuera occidentalis), a native 
species that is one of the most common and destructive defoliating insects in the West, 
tends to spread “top-down” from tree canopies and causes more damage in uneven-aged 
stands with vertical complexity (Brookes et al. 1987). White pine blister rust, an non-
native tree disease caused by the pathogen Cronartium ribicola, is more likely to affect 
trees in riparian areas or cool and moist abiotic environments (Geils et al. 2010). Dense, 
closed-canopy tree groups with vertical heterogeneity are associated with cooler, wetter, 
understory conditions (Rambo and North 2009), and could facilitate the establishment 
and success of white pine blister rust. The spatial distribution of large trees may increase 
the susceptibility of adjacent trees to colonization and mortality in mountain pine beetle 
(Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreaks (Mitchell and Preisler 1991).  
 
Growth and Composition 
 
From a silvicultural perspective, the sizes of canopy gaps and tree groups have 
important implications for tree growth form, growth efficiency, and future species 
composition of forested stands. In a study of spatial pattern in Pinus ponderosa forests in 
northern Arizona, Sánchez Meador et al. (2011) found that trees within groups had, on 
average, smaller diameters than trees on the edges of groups or within openings. York et 
al. (2004) found that trees adjacent to harvested openings had 41% greater growth 
efficiency than those within the unharvested matrix. In old-growth Picea abies forests in 

 
17 
 
Sweden, Fraver et al. (2014) demonstrated that competition intensity reduced growth 
rates of individual trees. Heterogeneous growing conditions create a variety of 
competitive environments. These environments then promote differential selective 
pressures on the individuals within a stand. 
 
The gap-partitioning hypothesis as discussed in Canham (1989), is particularly 
applicable to mixed-species stands in the western United States. The success of tree 
seedlings and germinants depends not only on the overstory density, but also on the 
spatial arrangement of overstory trees. Changes in resource availability and competitive 
interactions (between seedlings) occur with alterations to forest spatial pattern (Palik et 
al. 2003). Light thresholds limit the trees that can regenerate in the understory, and shade 
intolerant species (e.g. Pinus ponderosa, Pinus jeffreyi, Populus tremuloides) may need 
larger gaps than shade-tolerant species (e.g. Abies concolor, Abies lasiocarpa, Picea 
engelmanii, Acer grandidentatum) to establish and persist (Burns and Honkala 1990a, 
1990b, Bigelow et al. 2011). Mid-tolerant species (e.g. Pinus strobiformis, Pseudotsuga 
menziesii, Quercus gambelii) are somewhere in the middle of this spectrum. A diversity 
of disturbance types and gap sizes likely promotes species diversity on a site. 
 
Tree spatial patterns influence subsequent regeneration patterns in forests. 
Stephens and Fry (2005) found that the combination of overstory structure and 
heterogeneous fire behavior in Pinus jeffreyi forests leads to the creation of regeneration 
patches ranging from 6-650 square meters; the majority of regeneration patches were in 
the smaller end of this range. Group sizes reported by Stephens and Fry (2005) are 
similar to others summarized in Larson and Churchill (2012), and Reynolds et al. (2013), 

 
18 
 
suggesting that this regeneration mechanism may also occur in other western forests.  
Fine-scale patterns and processes have an important role in the patterns of tree 
recruitment. York et al. (2004) demonstrated that seedlings grew more efficiently when 
they were in openings and not in close proximity to established overstory trees. Sánchez 
Meador et al. (2009) found a negative relationship between Pinus ponderosa recruitment 
and established overstory trees, suggesting that these individuals first colonized the 
centers of openings after the onset of fire exclusion. In mixed-conifer forests in the Sierra 
Nevada, North et al. (2004) found conflicting results, instead demonstrating that openings 
may have inhibited tree regeneration. Location within the canopy gap is an important 
factor in determining the success of tree regeneration (Gray and Spies 1996), and 
competition with the herbaceous understory (Puhlick et al. 2012) is one possible 
explanation for this effect. Broad-scale climatic conditions are known to affect tree 
recruitment (Brown and Wu 2005). These conditions could interact with overstory and 
understory conditions to affect the patterns of tree recruitment. 
 
Understory Communities 
 
Overstory structure has dramatic influences on understory community structure 
and composition. In forests in southwestern Colorado, Korb et al. (2007) found that 
percent understory cover was highest beneath Populus tremuloides, and lowest beneath 
Pinus ponderosa. Moore et al. (2006) found that restored Pinus ponderosa forests in 
northern Arizona had significantly greater C3 graminoid biomass in the first few years 
after treatment than did untreated control plots. After a 4-5 year lag, the biomass of forbs 

 
19 
 
and legumes were also greater than levels in control plots. Laughlin et al. (2006) 
suggested that grassy openings and interspaces may have (historically) covered as much 
as 70% of the understory in many Pinus ponderosa forests in the Southwest. These 
frequent-fire ecosystems probably had characteristics of both forest and grassland 
communities. Reductions in tree density and the creation of overstory gaps in Pinus 
ponderosa forests lead to increased overall herbaceous standing crop biomass and 
understory species richness (Griffis et al. 2001, Laughlin et al. 2006, Moore et al. 2006, 
Thomas and Waring 2014). 
 
Implications for Wildlife 
 
Differing forest structures can (simultaneously) be beneficial to certain types of 
wildlife while being detrimental to others. The Mexican spotted owl (Strix occidentalis 
lucida; a threatened species) prefers to nest or roost in areas that have high canopy cover 
(Grubb et al. 1997), and many large trees (May et al. 2004). These types of forest are also 
selected by the northern goshawk (Accipter gentilis), but competitive interaction plays an 
equally important role in nest site selection for the goshawk (Reich et al. 2004). Avian 
species differ in their responses to treatments at a fine-scale. Using multi-species 
occupancy models, White et al. (2013) suggested that heterogeneous fuel reduction 
treatments in the Sierra Nevada would have higher avian species richness than more 
homogeneous treatments, however the effects differed between species. Though results 
from a similar study were not conclusive in northern Arizona, the distribution of snags, 
large trees, and areas of low canopy cover appear to be important contributors to avian 

 
20 
 
habitat quality (Kalies and Rosenstock 2013). 
 
Landscape variability is well-understood to affect animal movement (Fahrig 
2007), but fine-scale and stand-scale habitat components may also be more important to 
smaller or less mobile organisms. Meyer and Sisk (2001) found that variability in Pinus 
ponderosa forest cover can influence insect behavior, primarily through dramatic changes 
to the understory microclimate across relatively short distances. Converse et al. (2006) 
and Kalies et al. (2012) found that small mammals were often associated with open-
canopied Pinus ponderosa forests with greater understory productivity, more snags, and 
higher levels of coarse woody debris. Biological legacies (Franklin et al. 2002) and the 
spatial distribution of tree groups and openings are important functional components of 
fine-scale and stand-scale structural heterogeneity. 
 
Factors Driving Spatial Pattern in Forests 
 
The processes that drive forest heterogeneity are complex and variable, causing 
considerable differences between and within forest types. Numerous factors probably 
play important roles, particularly species composition, site productivity, seral state, and 
disturbance. 
 
Species Composition 
 
Species composition can influence forest spatial pattern through competitive and 
facilitative interactions, as well as through the growth strategies of individual species. In 
some species, allelopathic effects can limit tree recruitment. For example, Picea 

 
21 
 
engelmanii can inhibit the growth of its own seedlings, as well as those of Pinus contorta 
in close proximity to established overstory trees (Taylor and Shaw 1983). Understory 
plants can also express this trait, and the western bracken fern (Pteridium aquilidum) may 
inhibit the growth of Douglas-fir seedlings (Pseudotsuga menzeisii), though this 
relationship has only been effectively demonstrated in laboratory settings (Stewart 1975).  
Facilitation is also an important process governing the patterns of establishment of trees 
(Bruno et al. 2003). Overstory trees can strongly influence the understory microclimate 
(Meyer et al. 2001, Rambo and North 2009), which, in the absence of fire, facilitates the 
growth of late-seral species (Fulé et al. 2009). This same process also reduces the success 
of regeneration by shade-intolerant, early-seral tree species (Fulé et al. 2009, Bigelow et 
al. 2011). Ecological theory suggests that harsh sites may require facilitation for any 
successful tree regeneration to occur (Bertness and Callaway 1994). 
 
Pinus ponderosa can demonstrate aggregated (closer than expected distance 
between trees), random, or uniform (evenly spaced) tree distributions, based on local site 
conditions (Abella and Denton 2009). Group membership can be beneficial to shallow-
rooted species such as Picea pungens or Picea engelmanii to prevent windthrow 
mortality (Jones 1974). This might create an adaptive pressure that prevents individual 
tree establishment in open areas. Populus tremuloides, Acer spp., Quercus gambelii, 
Robinia spp., all reproduce, at least partially, from sprouting and suckering (Jones 1974, 
Burns and Honkala 1990b) and commonly occur in groups. If these species are a 
dominant component of a forested stand, it makes sense that the forest would be more 
likely to demonstrate aggregation. Less is known about the spatial distributions of many 

 
22 
 
other species; this is an important area for future research.  
 
Site Productivity 
 
Climate, topography, and soils interact to help determine the productivity of a 
given site. Abella and Denton (2009) demonstrated that forests with different soil types  
can have very different spatial patterns. Spatial pattern was less sensitive to site 
differences (than measurements of tree density), but both pattern and density were 
influenced by climate and soil type (Abella and Denton 2009). In southwestern forests, 
more productive sites typically have a higher tree density than less productive sites 
(Abella and Denton 2009, Reynolds et al. 2013).  
 
Site productivity also influences the herbaceous understory, which could exclude 
the regeneration of some trees due to competitive effects (Abella and Denton 2009, 
Puhlick et al. 2012). Studies have shown that Pinus ponderosa forests growing on the 
less-productive basalt and cinder soils of the Southwest had aggregated patterns 
historically (Dyer et al. 2008, Sánchez Meador et al. 2009, Sánchez Meador et al. 2011). 
In these forests, aggregation could be an expression of a limited number of sites with 
greater water availability or the prevalence of slightly rockier areas that are less prone to 
grass establishment (and therefore better suited to tree regeneration). It could also reflect 
the “patchier” nature of fires, when a flammable understory may not cover the entire site. 
These findings contrast with Pinus ponderosa stands on more productive soils 
(sedimentary-derived) that primarily have random spatial patterns (Schneider 2012). 
Stands underlain by sedimentary soils may have had more “uniformly good” site 

 
23 
 
conditions, with fewer barriers to tree establishment. Low-severity fire may also have 
burned more continuously throughout the understory because of greater herbaceous 
cover. 
 
Temporal Dynamics 
 
In many parts of the United States, spatial analysis of forest patterns began in the 
1950’s and 1960’s; much early work on this topic focused on the changes in forest 
structure as stands progressed through the stages of stand development (Oliver and 
Larson 1996). In southwestern Pinus ponderosa forests, Cooper (1961) demonstrated that 
tree patterns are initially aggregated, as groups of small seedlings establish in openings or 
in advantageous microsites. However, as the new cohort ages tree patterns begin to shift 
towards random or uniform distributions. Williamson (1975) found similar dynamics in 
old-growth beech/maple forests in Indiana. Peet and Christensen (1987) describe a 
possible mechanism for these changes: self-thinning after initial cohort establishment 
leads to substantial tree mortality, resulting in only a handful of trees surviving in each 
tree group. In Pinus ponderosa forests in the Front Range of Colorado, Mast and Veblen 
(1999) demonstrated that trees established in small, even-aged groups, and that pattern 
shifted with age. Many Pinus ponderosa forests show the presence of even-aged groups 
even in later stages of stand development, suggesting that more than one individual 
usually survives after self-thinning of the initially dense regeneration patches (Mast and 
Wolf 2004), but tree size becomes more variable with cohort age (Mast and Veblen 
1999). Temporal patterns of tree growth are tied to community structure and successional 

 
24 
 
processes; spatial patterns of forests are a reflection of both deterministic and stochastic 
components (Halpern 1989, Sánchez Meador et al. 2009). 
 
Disturbance 
 
Patterns of disturbance play a very important role in determining overstory pattern 
and subsequent regeneration (Moustakas 2015). This is especially true for fire-related 
disturbance, but is also the case for insects and pathogens. In Sequoia National Park, CA, 
Rice (1993) demonstrated that burn severity and microtopographic variation have 
important influences on post-fire establishment of vegetation, primarily through effects 
on soil nutrient availability. Small areas of high-severity fire had less vegetative cover 
than low-severity areas following a year of recovery (Rice 1993). In the Sierra Nevada, 
areas that had more frequent and intense fire typically had fewer tree seedlings and a 
greater level of shrub cover (Lydersen and North 2012). Fry et al. (2014) found that areas 
with intact low-severity fire regimes did not have significantly larger openings than 
forests that had experienced long-term fire suppression. These findings suggest that 
persistent meadows and disturbance types other than fire can also contribute to fine-scale 
variability in spatial pattern. Fire can also create landscape-scale heterogeneity of burned 
and unburned patches in large mixed or high severity fire events (Romme 1982). 
 
Similarly, insects, parasitic plants, and disease can have a variety of effects on the 
patterns of growth and mortality in western forests (Wilson and Tkacz 1993). Due to 
methods of spread, root diseases, dwarf mistletoes, and some insect species can cause tree 
mortality in an aggregated fashion (Wilson an Tkacz 1993, Smith et al. 2005, Bruhn et al. 

 
25 
 
1996). However, Silver et al. (2013) show that recent mortality (from root rot fungi, 
drought, windthrow, and other factors) in stands dominated by Pinus resinosa occurred 
randomly across the forest, and snags were only aggregated at very small scales (2-4m). 
Phellinus weirii (laminated root rot), creates slowly expanding gaps of mortality, 
maintaining open areas for long periods of time (Hansen and Goheen 2000). Western 
spruce budworm (Choristenuera occidentalis) tends to outbreak periodically and 
preferentially targets certain species (notably Pseudotsuga menziesii) in mixed-conifer 
forests (Swetnam and Lynch 1993). Considering the importance of species composition 
to spatial pattern, this has important implications. Both dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium 
spp.) and western spruce budworm spread top-down, and cause more rapid mortality in 
smaller trees (Swetnam and Lynch 1993, Conklin and Fairweather 2010). Though this 
mortality is more likely to affect vertical heterogeneity and size structure, it probably also 
has important effects on horizontal spatial pattern and may limit tree recruitment in 
openings. 
 
Methods of Identifying Reference Forest Structure 
 
A combination of historical plot data (e.g. Moore et al. 2004), studies of reference 
sites with intact fire regimes (e.g. Fulé et al. 2003a, Stephens and Fulé 2005), and 
historical reconstructions (e.g. Fulé et al. 1997) are often used to quantify the NRV in 
disturbed or degraded forests. In many western forests, data (referred to as historical plot 
data) were collected on federal lands beginning in the early 1900's to monitor the effects 
of silvicultural treatments over time. Data were often collected for all live trees above a 

 
26 
 
given diameter (usually 9.14 cm diameter at 1.37m above ground level). Historical plot 
data can be useful because these data were relatively accurate, and were collected and 
recorded thoroughly and at regular intervals (Moore et al. 2004, Sánchez Meador and 
Moore 2010, Vankat 2011a, 2011b). Unfortunately, the number of these historical data 
sets is relatively minimal. Also, these plots may only be representative of a small 
subsample of all the ecosystem types in the Southwest (Bell et al. 2009). Additionally, 
collection of historical plot data began in the early 1900's, 2-4 decades after the initial 
onset of fire exclusion (Moore et al. 2004, Sánchez Meador et al. 2009, Lydersen et al. 
2013); it is possible that forests on these plots had already undergone substantial changes 
due to Euro-American settlement by this point. While studies using these historical plot 
data can provide very useful information, they are not without limitations. Studies of 
current reference sites with intact fire regimes are especially useful because they provide 
data within the context of current environmental conditions (Stephens and Fulé 2005), 
and there is greater certainty associated with current conditions than past ones. But, like 
historical data, these sites only exist in a small number of locations. In the Southwest, 
these sites include the Gila Wilderness in New Mexico, some remote mesa tops in the 
Grand Canyon, AZ, and parts of Mexico (Fulé et al. 2003a, Stephens and Fulé 2005). 
Much like historical plot data, the applicability of these sites to the entirety of the 
southwestern forests is limited. 
 
Reconstruction of historical structure helps to fill some gaps in knowledge of the 
NRV. On sites where “historical remnant” (snags, logs, stumps, etc.) is still present, 
forest structure prior to Euro-American settlement can be effectively reconstructed (Fulé 

 
27 
 
et al. 1997, Moore et al. 2004). Because decomposition rates are slow in the arid 
Southwest and many species are relatively long-lived, these methods demonstrate 
minimal bias (Moore et al. 2004).  
Many techniques have been utilized by scientists for the purpose of forest 
reconstruction. Youngblood et al. (2004), Abella and Denton (2009), Dickinson (2014), 
and Greco and Sensibaugh (2014) all present methods of historical reconstruction that are 
based, primarily, on size-age relationships. With this “size-age relationship method”, all 
live trees and historical remnants above a given diameter threshold, or showing old 
growth characteristics, are considered to have been present prior to Euro-American 
settlement. Any trees or evidences smaller than this threshold are not believed to have 
been present historically. These data can be quickly collected, leading to a broad census 
across many sites in a short time-period. Size-age relationships can vary both within and 
between sites (Oliver and Larson 1996), leading to inaccuracy in the results presented in 
these studies.  
 
More accurate results are presented in studies where the majority of live trees and 
historical remnants are dated using standard dendrochronological techniques (Stokes and 
Smiley 1968). Mast et al. (1999), Brown and Wu (2005), and Brown et al. (2012) are 
three such studies. Mast et al. (1999) and Brown and Wu (2005) crossdated all historical 
remnants on their plots. Brown et al. (2012) determined age structure of dead trees with a 
small subplot within each larger plot. Though these methods are highly accurate, they are 
also very time-consuming in the field and the laboratory, leading to a very small sample 
size relative to the number of person-hours invested. Our approach (outlined in Chapter 

 
28 
 
3, slightly modified from Sánchez Meador et al. 2011) is a hybrid of dendrochronology 
and size-age relationships. When using this method, we sacrifice some of the accuracy 
presented by Mast et al. (1999) and Brown and Wu (2005) (especially in historical 
remnants) for a larger sample size. 
 
Methods of Quantifying Spatial Patterns at Multiple Scales 
 
Point pattern analyses, statistics quantifying spatial autocorrelation, and 
geostatistics, are useful methods that are the basis for many ecological studies concerned 
with the relationship of events within space (Perry et al. 2002). Point pattern analysis is 
typically concerned with the pattern of events, solely based on their location relative to 
other events in one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional space (Baddeley 
et al. 2014). Spatial autocorrelation and geostatistics focus on the relationship of a 
variable (such as age, size, genotype, etc.) across space (e.g. Fry and Stephens 2010). 
Methods of spatial autocorrelation and geostatistics often assume that events that occur in 
close proximity to one another (spatially or temporally) have greater similarity than 
events that occur far from one another (Tobler 1970). 
 
Point Pattern Analysis 
 
Point pattern analysis, broadly, can be broken down into three categories: first 
order methods, second order methods, and local indicators of spatial association (LISA, 
Anselin 1995). First order methods, such as those described by the the Clark and Evans' 
R index (Clark and Evans 1954), and Pielou's Alpha statistic (Pielou 1959), describe the 

 
29 
 
overall pattern of events at the plot extent with one numerical value. The Clark and 
Evans' R index is a ratio of observed mean nearest neighbor (the average of the distances 
from each point to its closest neighbor) distance divided by the “expected mean distance” 
with a given point density (Clark and Evans 1954).  This expected distance is a function 
of the number of events and the total area surveyed. The difference between observed and 
expected is often tested with a Z-test to determine statistical significance (Baddeley and 
Turner 2005).  
 
Pielou's α index (Pielou 1959) is an improvement upon the method of Clark and 
Evans (1954). With this method, the researcher performs the analysis in two steps. 
During the first step in Pielou's method, one calculates the mean nearest neighbor 
distance in the observed dataset. Then a set of points (with the same intensity), 
representing complete spatial randomness (CSR) is simulated. The interpattern nearest 
neighbor distance is calculated for each individual in the observed pattern (the distance to 
the closest of the random points). The mean of these values (the expected value for CSR) 
is then compared to the mean nearest neighbor distance between points in the observed 
pattern (Pielou 1959).  
 
For either first order method, if events are closer in space than would be expected 
under randomness then the pattern can be described as aggregated. Aggregation implies 
that events occur close to one another, suggesting that there is some ecological benefit or 
underlying process driving events to occur in this way. If events are uniformly distributed 
(evenly spaced), such as in a plantation, they are further than expected under CSR. In a 
natural ecological setting, uniform spatial distributions are the result of some ecological 

 
30 
 
benefit or process that makes events occur far from one another. Strong competition 
between individuals or allelopathy are two possible explanations for this type of pattern. 
Clark and Evans' R index is the most widely used first-order point pattern statistic in the 
study of tree spatial patterns (Larson and Churchill 2012) 
 
Second-order analyses, such as the univariate Ripley's K (Ripley 1977) and the 
Paired Correlation Function (PCF, Stoyan and Stoyan 1994) also test questions relating to 
the distance between events, but the use of these methods adds the complexity of changes 
in spatial scale. The Ripley's K analysis is cumulative, meaning that observed patterns at 
a short distances can influence the observed patterns at a larger distances. The PCF gives 
very similar results to Ripley's K, but it is non-cumulative. For this reason, the results of 
the PCF (at a given lag distance) may be more easily interpreted than the Ripley's K 
(Loosmore and Ford 2006). Both tests are statistically valid if interpreted correctly 
(Baddeley et al. 2014). Historically, Ripley's K analysis has been the most widely used 
measure to quantify forest spatial pattern (Larson and Churchill 2012), but the PCF has 
seen increased use recently (e.g. Fry et al. 2014).  
 
Hypothesis tests for these second order methods are based on Monte Carlo 
simulations of a random Poisson point process (Baddeley et al. 2014). For these 
simulations (if the assumption of isotropy or site homogeneity is not rejected), each 
location within the study area is equally likely to have a simulated point within it; the 
intensity parameter for the Poisson distribution is based on expected number of points per 
unit area. Two-tailed confidence envelopes are then developed by simulating a large 
number of patterns (often 999), and taking the 2.5th and 97.5th quantile values at each 

 
31 
 
point in the tested interval (Baddeley et al. 2014).  
Because comparisons between the observed pattern and the simulation envelopes 
are being made at each tested distance, statistical significance must be interpreted 
carefully to prevent α-inflation (Loosmore and Ford 2006). If the observed pattern 
exceeds this envelope at a given distance, either more aggregated or more uniform than 
random, it is assumed that the observed point pattern is significantly different from 
random at a given scale, but this assumption should also be tested with a goodness of fit 
test (Loosmore and Ford 2006). The most commonly used goodness of fit tests are the 
Diggle, Cressie, Loomis, and Ford test (DCLF) or the Maximum Absolute Deviation 
(MAD) test (Baddeley et al. 2014). The MAD test is more powerful than the DCLF test 
when there is no prior knowledge of the expected scale of a relationship, though the 
DCLF is preferable when the researcher has an a priori hypothesis of interaction distance 
(Baddeley et al. 2014). 
 
Local indicators of spatial interaction (LISA; Anselin 1995), such as those 
described by Plotkin et al. (2002) and Getis and Ord (1992), do more than quantify the 
mean patterns of a data set. LISA can tell us about the effect of each event on the overall 
pattern, or the distribution of events within the pattern, and can be used to quantify the 
number of tree groups, the range in group sizes, and the number of isolated individuals 
(Larson and Churchill 2012). These aspects of pattern are crucial in the development of 
silvicultural prescriptions that target heterogeneity (See Larson and Churchill 2012, and 
Churchill et all. 2014). Quantifying the size and number of openings or empty space 
between events, is valuable and an important area for future research (Larson and 

 
32 
 
Churchill 2012, Lydersen et al. 2013, Dickinson 2014).  
 
The continuum percolation method (described in Plotkin et al. 2002) determines 
group size and distribution by searching for points within a given lag distance of other 
points (Plotkin et al. 2002, Larson and Churchill 2008). Though previous studies have 
used a wide range of lag distances, a commonly used lag distance is 6m (Larson and 
Churchill 2008, Sánchez Meador et al. 2011, Lydersen et al. 2013). This value 
corresponds to the 75th percentile crown diameter of historical trees in Pinus ponderosa 
forests of northern Arizona (Sánchez Meador et al. 2011). In this case, any trees within 
6m of another tree are considered to be a part of the same group. Because the biological 
definition of tree groups is multiple trees with overlapping crowns (Larson and Churchill 
2012, Reynolds et al. 2013), methods that incorporate tree crown size have also been 
developed (Sánchez Meador et al. 2011, Lydersen et al. 2013). The methods of Sánchez 
Meador et al. (2011) correct a bias that may predispose large trees (beyond the 75th 
percentile of size) to be isolated individuals rather than members of groups. If using this 
method, the lag distance for a given tree is 6m unless the estimated crown diameter 
exceeds this value. If crown diameter exceeds 6m, then the crown diameter becomes the 
lag distance for this tree when assigning group membership. Methods presented in 
Lydersen et al. (2013), Fry et al. (2014), and Chapter 3 also determine group size and 
membership based on measured or estimated crown radius. Use of a fixed lag distance 
estimates the “biotic potential” of trees to become members of groups (Sánchez Meador 
et al. 2011), while methods based solely on crown overlap determine if a tree is a member 
of a group at that given point in time.

Measures of Spatial Autocorrelation 
 
Tests of spatial autocorrelation measure the relationship of a variable in space, 
and determine if events close to one another are likely to have similar values. Moran's I 
(Cliff and Ord 1981), a measure of spatial autocorrelation, is a commonly used method 
for the analysis of spatial pattern in forests (Larson and Churchill 2012). Mast and 
Veblen (1999), Mast and Wolf (2004, 2006), and Sánchez Meador et al. (2009) use this 
metric to quantify the patch size of even-sized and even-aged groups of trees. Because 
point pattern analyses are solely based on the proximity of points to one another, spatial 
autocorrelation may provide more insight into the underlying ecological processes 
driving spatial pattern. When using Moran's I, variables tested for autocorrelation must be 
continuous. The Join Count Statistic (Cliff and Ord 1981) provides a test of spatial 
autocorrelation for binary categorical variables (such as species groups or size-classes). 
These global methods test the hypothesis (Ho) of “no significant autocorrelation of the 
given variable at the plot extent.” Ha: points with similar values are more likely to occur 
near one another. 
 
Autocorrelograms are a local adaptation of the Moran's I statistic. These analyses 
typically include a Bonferroni correction (Bonferroni 1936) of pointwise p-values for 
multiple comparisons. Autocorrelograms allow one to go beyond the hypothesis test of 
“spatial autocorrelation at the extent” to ask questions relating to spatial autocorrelation 
at a given scale. These differences are analogous to the first-order (Clark and Evans' R, 
Pielou's α) and second-order (Ripley's K, PCF) tests within Point Pattern Analysis.

Geostatistics 
 
Geostatistics compare observations of a given variable between events to create 
predictive surfaces. Hessl et al. (2007) provides a good overview of some of these 
analyses, and describe the use of Kriging, Inverse Distance Weighting, and 
Thiessen/Vorronoi Polygons to predict values around sample locations of fire occurrence. 
These methods all have benefits and drawbacks, discussed at length by Hessl et al. 
(2007), and will not be discussed at length here. Geostatistics can prove useful for 
visualizing data and can be utilized in presenting temporal relationships such as 
regeneration dates in different spatial locations (Sánchez Meador et al. 2009). Some of 
these methods, such as semivariogram analysis, can be particularly useful in making 
connections between pattern and process (e.g. Fry and Stephens 2010). Certain 
geostatistical methods can also be utilized for hypothesis testing (e.g. kriging; Perry et al. 
2002). 
 
Collection of Spatial Point Pattern Data at Multiple Scales 
 
Studies of forest spatial pattern most commonly rely on field-based stem-mapping 
at stand-scales (Larson and Churchill 2012), but new remote sensing-based methods 
(such as airborne LiDAR) may provide an additional way to collect and analyze spatial 
data in forests (e.g. Swetnam 2013). Because many methods of spatial analysis are 
vulnerable to edge effects (Ripley 1988), collection of data in plots that maximize the 
ratio of inner area:outer edge, may be best for the purpose of maximizing the efficiency 
of data collection. Circles have the highest ratio of area:edge of any standard shape, so 

 
35 
 
circular plots are the best shape for this purpose. However, circular plots can also be 
logistically difficult to establish when plot sizes are large. Most studies of forest spatial 
pattern use plots that are square (e.g. Sánchez Meador et al. 2009, Lydersen et al. 2013, 
Fry et al. 2014). Spatial analyses can only be performed for ½ the length of the shortest 
plot diameter, with some form of edge correction either eliminating observations near the 
plot edge (reduced sample/guard correction) or reducing the weight of the outermost 
points (isotropic edge correction, translation correction) towards the observed pattern 
(Ohser 1983, Ripley 1988). These methods of edge correction account for the fact that 
there is no knowledge of events outside the plot perimeter. 
 
The Current State of Knowledge for Southwestern Mixed-Conifer Forests 
 
Mixed-conifer forests are one of the most diverse and productive cover types in 
the Southwest and cover approximately 1,000,000 hectares in this region (Dieterich 1983, 
Korb et al. 2007). Southwestern mixed-conifer has been defined as the intermediate zone 
between ponderosa pine forests (at lower elevations) and spruce-fir forests at higher 
elevations, sharing species and environmental characteristics of both adjacent forest 
types, but often with a higher overstory species richness (Romme et al. 2009, Evans et al. 
2011). This species richness is perhaps the most recognizable aspect of the ecosystem.  
Mixed-conifer is commonly grouped into cool/wet and warm/dry categories based on 
relative species composition and historical disturbance regimes (Romme et al. 2009). It is 
believed that cool and wet mixed-conifer forests have a history of mixed-severity fire and 
structure within these forests has not substantially changed as a result of fire exclusion 

 
36 
 
(Evans et al. 2011). Contrarily, warm and dry mixed-conifer forests (with a history of 
frequent low-severity fire) have seen substantial structural changes since Euro-American 
settlement (summarized in Evans et al. 2011, Reynolds et al. 2013). In the Southwest, dry 
mixed-conifer forests are typically dominated by Pinus ponderosa, but also commonly 
include components of: Pseudotsuga menziesii, Abies concolor, Quercus gambelii, 
Populus tremuloides, Acer spp., Quercus gambelii, Pinus flexilis, Pinus strobiformis, and 
occasionally Abies bifolia, Picea engelmanii, or Picea pungens. (Dieterich 1983, Romme 
et al. 2009, Evans et al. 2011). In other regions of the western United States, Pinus 
jeffreyi, Larix occidentalis, Abies grandis, Tsuga spp., Thuga spp., Calocedrus spp., 
Sequoia spp., and Quercus spp. may also be important components of these ecosystems 
(Evans et al. 2011, Larson et al. 2012, Fry et al. 2014). 
 
Southwestern mixed-conifer forests may occupy a greater area today than they did 
historically due to the effects of fire suppression. Johnson (1994) found substantial 
decreases in the cover of ponderosa pine and aspen forests, and associated increases in 
mixed-conifer cover in the Southwest between the 1960's and 1980's. These changes are 
due, in large part, to increases in forest densities, favoring regeneration of shade tolerant 
species (see also: Dahms et al. 1997). Though mixed-conifer forests may cover only a 
small portion of the total area for southwestern forests, they are sanctums of biodiversity, 
providing important habitat for many plant and animal species. For example, the Mexican 
spotted owl (Strix occidentalis lucida) preferentially nests in mixed-conifer forests over 
other cover types (May and Gutiérrez 2002). See: Battaglia and Shepphard (2007), Evans 
et al. (2011), Margolis et al. (2013), Looney and Waring (2013), and Reynolds et al. 

 
37 
 
(2013) for recent reviews of structural and functional characteristics in these ecosystems. 
 
In the context of this project, we define dry mixed-conifer as, historically, having 
a dominant component of Pinus ponderosa with at least one other more shade-tolerant 
and fire-intolerant coniferous species (commonly occurring at a more mesic or high-
elevation site) in a dominant or codominant position in the overstory. This is an important 
distinction, because many contemporary mixed-conifer forests were historically 
ponderosa pine, or pine-oak forests with the site potential to become mixed-conifer 
(Johnson 1994). Our analysis focused on ecosystems that were historically mixed-conifer.  
 
Reference Conditions- Fire History 
 
Swetnam and Baisan (1996) developed fire chronologies for 63 sites across the 
Southwest; 24 of these sites included at least some mixed-conifer forest. The 25% mean 
fire return interval (filtered: at least 25% of samples for a site scarred in a given year) for 
these mixed-conifer sites ranged from 7.8-26.1 years. This is generally less frequent than 
fire regimes in ponderosa pine ecosystems (Swetnam and Baisan 1996). In Pinus 
ponderosa forests, years with widespread fire occurrence are typically dry years that are 
preceded by 2-3 wet years (Swetnam and Baisan 1996, Brown et al. 2001). These 
preceding years of moist conditions help to develop a lush herbaceous understory, 
providing greater levels of fine fuels for fire to ignite and carry (Swetnam and Baisan 
1996, Brown et al. 2001). Contrarily, fires in mixed-conifer forests are less likely to be 
limited by fuels, rather they are controlled by top-down climatic factors (Swetnam and 
Baisan 1996, Brown et al. 2001). Years of widespread fire occurrence in mixed-conifer 

 
38 
 
forests are typically those with abnormally low PDSI (Palmer Drought Severity Index), 
and are often preceded by dry years (Swetnam and Baisan 1996). Dry mixed-conifer 
forests in the Southwest are probably somewhere in the middle of this spectrum, being 
affected by both bottom-up and top-down controls (Huffman et al. 2015). 
 
Other studies of historical fire regimes in mixed-conifer forests of the Southwest 
have corroborated Swetnam and Baisan (1996). In the White Mountains in eastern 
Arizona, Dieterich (1983) reported 22 year fire intervals of “landscape wide” fires in 
mixed-conifer forests. In the Sacramento Mountains of southern New Mexico, Brown et 
al. (2001) reported a 4-14 year mean fire return interval (MFRI) on their mixed-conifer 
sites (unfiltered), and stated that fire occurrences were primarily due to top-down 
controls. In the Pinaleños Mountains of southern Arizona, Grissino Mayer et al. (1994) 
found an unfiltered MFRI of 5 years, and O’Connor et al. (2014) reported that more than 
80% of this landscape has transitioned from forests typified by low-mixed severity to 
mixed-high severity (33% filtered MFI 9.3 years). In northern New Mexico, Touchan et 
al. (1996) reported a 25% mean fire return interval of 10-22 years on their mixed-conifer 
sites. Sakulich and Taylor (2007) reported a 25% MFRI of 16.3 years for Sky Island 
forests in the Guadalupe Mountains in west Texas.  Fulé et al. (2003a), Heinlein et al. 
(2005), and Huffman et al. (2015) all reported relatively frequent fire regimes on their 
mixed-conifer sites in northern Arizona with 9, 9-10, and 8.5 years respectively (all 25% 
filtered MFRI). Much evidence exists to justify the hypothesis that dry mixed-conifer 
forests in the Southwest experienced a relatively frequent and low-severity fire regime. 
All studies cited showed a near-total elimination of fire in the late 1800's or early 1900’s. 

 
39 
 
 
Other studies focusing on forest stand structure have suggested that less frequent, 
higher severity fire could also be an important factor in dry mixed-conifer forests 
(Williams and Baker 2012, Odion et al. 2014). Higher elevation sites (Fulé et al. 2003b) 
and those closer to the Rocky Mountains (Grissino Mayer et al. 2004, Fulé et al. 2009) 
may burn with a lower relative frequency, though filtered mean fire return intervals on 
these sites are often less than 30 years. In the Madrean Sky Islands of central and souther 
n Arizona, Margolis et al. (2011) demonstrated that there is considerable variability in 
fine-scale fire frequency in mixed-conifer forests, especially those with topographic 
diversity. The authors suggest that south-facing slopes (often the warm/dry subtype) burn 
at least every ten years, while north facing slopes and more mesic areas (often the 
cool/wet subtype) may burn much less frequently (Margolis et al. 2011). Mixed-conifer 
forests have a wide range of disturbance histories. This is an important consideration for 
managers when planning future treatments. 
 
Reference Conditions- Density and Composition 
 
The elimination of fire from much of the landscape has had dramatic impacts on 
stand structure and species composition in many southwestern forests. Reynolds et al. 
(2013) provide a summary of forest structure from current reference sites, historical plot 
data, and historical reconstructions (similar to: Fulé et al. 1997) in the ponderosa pine, 
pine-oak forests, and dry mixed-conifer forests in the Southwest. In dry mixed-conifer 
forests, reference sites ranged from about 50-250 live trees ha-1 and 9-29 m2 of basal area 
ha-1. Contemporary densities are generally much higher than historical densities. Mast 

 
40 
 
and Wolf (2004), Heinlein (2005), and Fulé and others (2009) reported ranges in 
contemporary densities of 584-1700 live trees ha-1 per hectare, and 24.3-51.5 m2 of basal 
area ha-1 (Mast and Wolf do not report contemporary basal area). Data from the San 
Francisco Peaks and the Mogollon Rim in Arizona show similar patterns (Sánchez 
Meador et al. unpublished data; Chapter 3 - Table 3). The wide variability (both 
historically and contemporarily) in density reflects the heterogeneity of these dry mixed-
conifer forests, and probably relates to variations in site productivity, differing 
disturbance histories, and human land use history in these ecosystems across the 
Southwest. A better understanding of the drivers of this variability may be necessary to 
encourage more site-specificity in management. 
 
The exclusion of fire (in addition to other Euro-American influences) has also led 
to a decrease in the prevalence of shade-intolerant species such as Pinus ponderosa and 
Populus tremuloides in many dry mixed-conifer forests (Reynolds et al. 2013). 
Historically, the importance of these species, especially Populus tremuloides, varied 
across the landscape however. Some dry mixed-conifer forests had a large component of 
Populus tremuloides historically (Heinlein et al. 2005, Fulé et al. 2009), though in other 
forests the species may have been a less important component (Chapter 3). Shade-tolerant 
species and mid-tolerant species, such as Pinus strobiformis, Pinus flexilis, Abies 
concolor, and Pseudotsuga menziesii, have increased quite substantially in relative 
abundance within many dry mixed-conifer forests of the Southwest since Euro-American 
settlement (Mast and Wolf 2004, Heinlein et al. 2005, Fulé et al. 2009). 
 

 
41 
 
Reference Conditions-Spatial Pattern 
 
Fine-scale spatial patterns of trees in frequent-fire forests of the West are often 
described as consisting of individual trees, groups of trees with interlocking crowns, 
grassy openings, and interspaces (Larson and Churchill 2012, Reynolds et al. 2013). 
Depending on the ecology of a given forest stand, the relative importance of these 
components may vary. 
 
As densities in dry mixed-conifer forests have increased (Chapter 3 - Fig 3), the 
proportion of trees in large patches has generally increased as well, and the proportion of 
individual trees, and those in small groups, has decreased (Sánchez Meador et al. 2011, 
Churchill et al. 2013, Lydersen et al. 2013). Conflicting results have been presented in 
regards to the size and distribution of openings. By comparing sites with ongoing fire 
exclusion to sites with an active fire regime, Fry et al. (2014) suggested that mean 
opening size may not have changed substantially due to fire exclusion. Findings of 
Lydersen et al. (2013) suggest otherwise. In their use of historical plot data in California, 
Lydersen et al. (2013) found a decrease in the size and number of openings 
(contemporarily) relative to historical levels. Results from the Front Range of Colorado 
show a decrease in the number of smaller openings since the onset of Euro-American 
settlement (Dickinson 2014).  
 
Studies of spatial pattern in dry mixed-conifer forests of the Southwest are under-
represented in the scientific literature (Reynolds et al. 2013). In the Appendix – Table 1, I 
present a summary of published studies in this ecosystem type across the western United 
States. Across the West, mean group sizes in dry mixed-conifer ecosystems ranged from 

 
42 
 
0.003 ha (Matonis et al. 2013) to 0.72 hectares (North et al. 2007) historically, and small 
groups were generally much more abundant than large groups (see Appendix-Table 1 for 
a detailed review of patch sizes and spatial patterns). The factors affecting this variability 
in patch size and patch formation are poorly understood (Larson and Churchill 2012). To 
date, only about 150 hectares of dry mixed-conifer forest have been studied (presented in 
the published literature) across the entire western United States to establish spatially 
explicit reference conditions; these ecosystems likely cover several million hectares 
across the region.

Reference Conditions and Shifting Community Dynamics in Southwestern Dry 
Mixed-Conifer Forests 
 
 
Abstract 
Structural conditions in southwestern “frequent-fire” forests, or forests that have a 
history of frequent, low-severity fire, have changed considerably since Euro-American 
settlement (ca. late 1800's); these changes are primarily due to excessive livestock 
grazing, extractive logging, road construction, and organized fire suppression. As a result 
of these land-use changes, forest densities in many locations have increased, contributing 
to increases in fire size and severity and alterations to ecosystem function. A recognition 
of these impacts has prompted interest in forest restoration treatments across broad 
swaths of the landscape. Forest restoration attempts to mimic the natural range of 
variability - or the structure and function inherent to intact natural ecosystems - but many 
aspects of these ecosystems are poorly understood. In combination with studies of the 
natural disturbance regime, reference conditions and studies of the natural range of 
variability provide an ecological basis for silvicultural treatments. Spatial pattern, or the 
horizontal distribution of trees, is an important component of the natural range of 
variability and influences a wide array of ecological processes. 
 
With this study, we reconstructed historical structure (density and spatial pattern) 
and species composition for four dry mixed-conifer sites on the Mogollon Rim, Arizona, 

 
59 
 
USA. We reconstructed conditions from the year 1879, the time of the widespread 
cessation of fire in the area. We found that these forests showed evidence of increased 
tree density between 1879 and 2014 with major increases in density in the smaller size 
classes. During this time period, the number of live trees ha-1 increased from an average 
of 129.5 to 744.3, basal area increased from 10.1 to 41.9 m2 ha-1, and mean canopy cover 
increased from 14.8 to 54.7 percent. Our results also showed shifts in species 
composition to a higher relative proportion of Abies concolor, and Pseudotsuga 
menziesii, and a lower relative proportion of Pinus ponderosa and Quercus gambelii. 
Mean group size, or the average number of trees in explicit tree groups, also increased as 
tree canopy cover became more continuous. Finally, we investigated the roles of different 
species groups within fine-scale spatial pattern. Species groups showed distinctly 
different patterns, suggesting that the patterns of individual species are an important 
consideration during the implementation of silvicultural treatments that are meant to 
mimic natural patterns and processes. Mechanical treatments and thinning operations in 
dry mixed-conifer forests on the Mogollon Rim should target an aggregated spatial 
structure of leave trees with a range of group sizes within a given site. Treatments based 
on the natural range of variability are likely to increase resistance and resilience of these 
ecosystems in the face of uncertain future conditions. 
 
 
Introduction 
Ecological patterns and process are closely related and interact at multiple spatial 
scales (Urban et al. 1987, Turner 1989, Levin 1992); therefore, a shift in the structure of 

 
60 
 
an ecosystem is likely to cause substantial changes to its ecological function. Overstory 
forest conditions and spatial pattern (the horizontal distribution of trees) are known to 
exert strong control over conditions in the understory, including light infiltration 
(Battaglia et al. 2002), species composition (Bigelow et al. 2011), understory diversity 
and productivity (Laughlin et al. 2006, Moore et al. 2006), tree recruitment (Sánchez 
Meador et al. 2009), water availability (O'Hara and Nagel 2006, Dore et al. 2012), and 
the variability of fuels and associated fire behavior (Thaxton and Platt 2006, Fry and 
Stephens 2010). Frequent-fire ecosystems in the West exhibited, historically, a 
heterogeneous structure that led to functional diversity at fine-, intermediate-, and coarse-
scales (Larson and Churchill 2012, Reynolds et al. 2013). At the fine-scale (< 4ha extent), 
forests had a mix of individual trees and groups of trees with interlocking crowns, 
discrete openings, and grassy interspaces (Larson and Churchill 2012; scales defined in 
Reynolds et al. 2013). At the intermediate-scale (4-400 ha extent; hereafter referred to as 
“stand-scale”), trees could be arranged in an aggregated spatial distribution (trees tending 
to grow in groups), a random spatial distribution, or, less commonly, in a uniform spatial 
distribution (evenly spaced) (Abella and Denton 2009, Reynolds et al. 2013). At a coarse-
scale (> 400 ha extent; hereafter referred to as the “landscape-scale”), forests probably 
had a variety of densities, seral stages, and species compositions. These differences were 
based on disturbance history, aspect, slope position, soils, and many other factors (Evans 
et al. 2011, Reynolds et al. 2013). 
 
Land use changes following Euro-American settlement in the southwestern 
United States excluded fire from many frequent-fire forests, altering local tree carrying 

 
61 
 
capacities (Bond et al. 2005) and increasing rates of recruitment (Covington and Moore 
1994, Jones 1994, Mast et al. 1999, Allen et al. 2002). This, in turn, led to dramatic 
increases in forest density, shifts in species composition to a greater proportion of shade-
tolerant and fire-intolerant species (in mixed-species forests), and decreases in average 
nearest neighbor distance (Cooper 1960, Covington and Moore 1994, Fulé et al. 2002, 
Sánchez Meador et al. 2009). Pure ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and pine-oak 
(Pinus ponderosa/Quercus gambelii) forests have deviated most substantially from their 
natural conditions, but these changes have also occurred in some mixed-conifer forests 
(Cocke et al. 2005). Mixed-conifer forests lie between ponderosa pine forests (typically a 
frequent, low-severity fire regime) and spruce-fir forests (typically an infrequent, high-
severity fire regime) on a gradient of temperature and moisture (driven by elevation, 
aspect, and other factors; Evans et al. 2011). Forest structural changes over the last 150 
years are more pronounced in the lower warm/dry mixed-conifer forests (hereafter 
referred to “dry” mixed-conifer) than the cool/wet mixed-conifer forests due to a 
comparatively greater deviation from the natural disturbance regime (Mast and Wolf 
2006, Romme et al. 2009, Evans et al. 2011). Southwestern dry mixed-conifer forests are 
typically dominated by Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum (Engelm.) with other tree 
species present including: Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Mayr) Franco, Abies 
concolor var. concolor (Gordon) Lindley ex Hildebrand, Populus tremuloides Michx., 
Pinus strobiformis Engelm., Pinus flexilis E.James, and Quercus gambelii Nutt. (Romme 
et al. 2009, Evans et al. 2011, Reynolds et al. 2013).  
 
Dry mixed-conifer ecosystems are both complex and poorly understood 

 
62 
 
(Reynolds et al. 2013), however, many of these forests are the target of forest 
management activities that aim to restore natural ecosystem structure and function (e.g. 
Four Forests Restoration Initiative, 4fri.org). Many southwestern dry mixed-conifer 
forests experienced fire regimes that were historically frequent, burning at least 25% of 
the landscape every 4-30 years (Dieterich 1983, Swetnam and Baisan 1996, Brown et al. 
2001, O’Connor et al. 2014, Huffman et al. 2015). These frequent, low-severity fire 
regimes maintained low forest densities, and the interruption of this process altered forest 
structure. Dendrochronological reconstructions and historical plot data suggest that 
overstory densities in these forests ranged 51-246 trees ha-1 and 9-28.5 m2 of basal area 
ha-1 in the late 1800's (Fulé et al. 2002, Matonis et al. 2013) and have increased by nearly 
one order of magnitude relative to historical densities; in recent years, these forests have 
been found to have as many as 1613 live trees ha-1 and as much as 51 m2 of basal area ha-
1 in the overstory (Heinlein et al. 2005). Mixed-conifer forests, as a whole, cover 
approximately 1,000,000 ha in the Southwest (Dieterich 1983), but this is probably a 
greater area than was present historically. Johnson (1994) found that the mixed-conifer 
cover type increased by about 400,000 hectares between 1962 and 1986, primarily due to 
the encroachment of shade-tolerant and mid-tolerant conifers into many pure Pinus 
ponderosa and Populus tremuloides stands. 
 
Efforts to quantify forest structure and spatial heterogeneity can provide useful 
information to land managers both through greater knowledge of the natural range of 
variability (NRV: the range of conditions present in naturally functioning ecosystems; 
Swanson et al. 1994), and through an improved understanding of ecological processes 

 
63 
 
such as disturbance dynamics (Thaxton and Platt 2006), competitive and facilitative 
interaction, and patch formation (Mast and Veblen 1999, Mast and Wolf 2004, Stephens 
and Fry 2005). An understanding of these factors allows managers to more closely align 
silviculture with the ecology of the areas being managed (O’Hara 2002). Managing for 
multi-scaled heterogeneity, as was common in these ecosystems historically, is thought to 
increase ecosystem resistance and resilience (Larkin et al. 2006, O’Hara and Ramage 
2013, Reynolds et al. 2013). These terms reflect the ability of ecosystems to experience 
disturbance with only minimal change to structure (resistance), or maintain similar 
functional attributes following disturbance (resilience; DeRose and Long 2014). 
Resistance and resilience are especially important in a rapidly changing environment in 
which fire occurrence and drought-related disturbance are increasing (Westerling et al. 
2006, Allen et al. 2010, Garfin et al. 2013). Lower stand densities and a heterogeneous 
forest structure allow ecosystems to better persist in an uncertain future (Fulé 2008) by 
reducing fire hazard (Stephens et al. 2009), and decreasing drought stress (O'Hara and 
Nagel 2006, Dore et al. 2012). Heterogeneity may also increase genetic diversity at the 
population level (Li et al. 2001, Huang et al. 2002) due to the presence of a wider range 
of environmental conditions in the understory (Meyer et al. 2001). This genetic diversity 
may facilitate in-situ adaptation under uncertain future conditions (Hoffman and Sgrò 
2011). Forest management partially informed by the NRV is still relevant in light of these 
climatic changes because these natural structural conditions and disturbance regimes 
reflect the evolutionary history under which many current tree populations and forest 
communities have developed (Fulé 2008).  

 
64 
 
 
Our study uses a combination of dendrochronological reconstruction and spatial 
analyses to quantify historical fine-scale heterogeneity in dry mixed-conifer forests of the 
Southwest, a recognized gap in scientific knowledge (Reynolds et al. 2013) that will help 
inform future land management strategies. The spatial and temporal relationships 
discussed in this study also help to describe inter and intraspecific competition and 
facilitation (e.g. Mast and Wolf 2004), ecological niche theory, and gap-partitioning in 
mixed-species forests (Canham 1989). The primary objectives for this study were to: 1) 
describe the spatial and temporal dynamics of dry mixed-conifer forests on the Mogollon 
Rim, AZ, USA and 2) provide new information concerning the spatial relationships of 
trees both within and between species. 
 
Methods 
Defining Dry Mixed-Conifer 
In the context of this project, we define dry mixed-conifer as, historically, having 
a dominant component of Pinus ponderosa with at least one additional coniferous species 
in a dominant or co-dominant position in the overstory. The possible coniferous species 
included are commonly found at more mesic or higher-elevation sites (e.g. Pseudotsuga 
menziesii, Abies spp., Picea spp., and others) and do not typically include Juniperus spp. 
or Pinus edulis. Being “historically dry mixed-conifer” is an important distinction 
because many contemporary mixed-conifer forests were historically ponderosa pine, or 
pine-oak forests with the site potential to become mixed-conifer, limited by frequent low-
severity fire (Johnson 1994). Our analysis focused on ecosystems that were historically 

 
65 
 
dry mixed-conifer, and the results of this study are most applicable to these types of sites 
along the Mogollon Rim, AZ, USA. 
 
Field Sites and Site Selection 
 
In the summer of 2014, we collected data on field sites within the Mogollon Rim 
Ranger District of the Coconino National Forest in Arizona, USA (Figure 3.1). We 
selected these sites using several GIS layers, including the Southwest Regional Gap 
Analysis (SWReGAP) dataset of cover type classification (USGS 2004), an airborne 
LiDAR (Light detection and ranging)-derived digital elevation model (1x1m resolution), 
a layer of fire perimeters (for fires greater than 10 acres) between 1970 and 2013 (USDA 
2014), and two layers with the locations of all roads and trails on Coconino National 
Forest (USDA 2014). We selected sites that could accommodate a 100m x 100m plot on 
relatively moderate and homogeneous slopes (< 30% slope). Additionally, we selected 
study sites that were all on south or west-facing aspects with vegetation identified as 
“Rocky Mountain Dry-Mesic Montane Mixed-Conifer Forest” in the SWReGAP layer 
(USGS 2004). We selected these south or west aspects because these are the areas that 
are likely to be targeted for future restoration treatments in dry mixed-conifer ecosystems 
on the Mogollon Rim.  
We also avoided selection of study sites with intensive timber harvests and areas 
that overlapped the boundaries of recent fires (fires since 1970); loss of historical 
remnants due to decomposition and fire occurrence can decrease the accuracy of 
reconstructions (Fulé et al. 2002). Through visual analysis of overstory structure, we also 

 
66 
 
rejected any sites that appeared to have been pine or pine-oak forests (historically) that 
had experienced recent mixed-conifer encroachment. Finally, we ensured that field sites 
were at least 100m from any roads or designated trails; this stratification reduces the 
likelihood of human tampering with sites during data collection and ensures that we were 
sampling from sites that received minimal levels of recent human disturbance. Finally, 
we selected sites non-randomly to ensure observation could be made in multiple canyons 
across the broader landscape. 
 
Soils were derived from sedimentary parent materials at all sites (Table 3.1). Soil 
texture analysis revealed that all soils were loam or sandy loam. Soils were also well-
drained and rocky. The Soldier soil series is the most common type, and is present on all 
sites; this soil series is composed of cherty limestone and sandstone from the Kaibab 
formation, and typically underlies forests with high timber value (Soil survey staff, 
NRCS 2015). The Palomino series (high productivity), Clover series (high productivity), 
and Rockland series (low-moderate productivity) were also present on our sites (Soil 
survey staff, NRCS 2015). Three of our four sites had site indices (for Pseudotsuga 
menziesii, following the methods of Edminster et al. 1991) exceeding 26m with a base 
age of 100 years. The least productive site (West Leonard) showed evidence of past 
insect and pathogen damage with overstory mortality for small proportions of larger 
Pseudotsuga menziesii, leading to few options for proper “site trees.” Dils et al. (2015) 
report that mortality of Pseudotsuga menziesii from Douglas-fir beetle (Dendroctonus 
pseudotsugae) has been common on this part of the Mogollon Rim in recent years. For 
these reasons, the site index (of 18.2m) on the West Leonard site may be under-

 
67 
 
representing the actual growth potential on the site. However, this site also had a 
substantial component of the Rockland soil series, the least productive soil type on our 
sites. A more thorough description of site differences and soil conditions can be found in 
Table 3.1. All analyses of soil texture, structure, and macro and micronutrient 
composition were performed by the Environmental Analysis Laboratory at Brigham 
Young University, Provo, UT, USA, in the spring of 2015. 
 
Mean elevation of the sites is approximately 2300m. Annual precipitation, 
averaging 84.5cm, is bi-modal, with the majority falling in the summer monsoon (July-
September), or as winter snowfall (December-February; PRISM Climate Group, 2004). 
Annual temperatures range between 3.5 (avg. min) and 15.5 (avg. max) °C; temperatures 
are typically warmest in June and July, and coolest in January and February (PRISM 
Climate Group, 2004) with diurnal shifts of 15°C or more. Our sites had nine tree species 
present: Abies concolor var. concolor (Gordon) Lindley ex Hildebrand, Acer 
grandidentatum Nutt., Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum (Engelm.), Pinus strobiformis 
Engelm., Populus tremuloides Michx., Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Mayr) Franco, 
Quercus gambelii Nutt., Robinia neomexicana A.Gray, and Salix scouleriana Barratt ex 
Hook. (Table 3.2). We also identified Acer negundo L., Juniperus depeana Steud., 
Juniperus scopulorum Sarg., and Pinus edulis Engelm. beyond the site boundaries but in 
the immediate area. 
 
Timber harvests began in this portion of Coconino National Forest in the late 
1950's and proceeded through the late 1980's, with more limited harvest occurring to 
current day (B. Greco, personal communication, November 15, 2014). Early harvests 

 
68 
 
focused on the removal of large conifers, but later harvests attempted to create a two-
aged structure by removing both large and small conifers and facilitating the growth of a 
new cohort in the understory (B. Greco, personal communication, November 15, 2014). 
Sanitation treatments to remove trees infected by dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium spp.) 
were also common (B. Greco, personal communication, November 15, 2014). For all 
analyses, we assumed a single harvest year of 1982 on the Hi Fuller, East Barbershop, 
and West Leonard sites, and two harvests (1960 and 1980) on the the East Bear site. 
These years were based on visual analysis of release years on increment cores adjacent to 
cut stumps. O’Reilly et al. (2015) later quantified harvest on the sites (see Results, 
Objective 2) using growth release data. 
 
Field Data Collection and Laboratory Methods  
 
Field methods were a slight variation of those used by Fulé et al. (1997) and 
adapted for spatial analysis by Moore et al. (2004) and Sánchez Meador et al. (2011). On 
each of four sites, we established a 100m x 100m square fixed-area plot. O’Neill et al. 
(1996) recommend that study extent should be at least 2-5 times the size of the patches 
being measured; group sizes reported in previous studies of dry mixed-conifer spatial 
pattern in the West rarely exceed 0.3 hectares (Larson et al. 2012, Churchill et al. 2013, 
Appendix-Table 1).  
On each site, we collected data for all live trees taller than 1.37m (breast height), 
and for every historical remnant (stump, log, snag, or stump hole) greater than 20cm or 
15cm in diameter (for conifers and hardwoods, respectively). Runs of the Bakker et al. 

 
69 
 
(2008) historical reconstruction model (see “Data Analysis - Objective 1…”) predicted 
that any historical remnants smaller than these sizes were not present prior to Euro-
American settlement (based on dendrochronological data across many similar sites in the 
Southwest and an exponential decay model). We measured diameter at breast height 
(DBH, 1.37m above ground level) for all live trees and diameter at stump height (0.4m 
above ground level) for all historical remnants. For each live tree and historical remnant, 
we also identified species, and recorded condition class following Thomas et al. (1979) 
and Waddell (2002). Condition classes were as follows: live, declining, recent snag, 
loose-bark snag, clean snag (no bark), snag broken above breast height, snag broken 
below breast height, downed and dead (log), cut stump, and stump holes. For historical 
remnants, we identified tree species using a combination of bark characteristics, limb 
structure, wood density, wood scent, and adjacent overstory species composition.  
For all “large trees” (live hardwoods greater than 20cm and live conifers greater 
than 40cm), and for a random sample of small live trees (smaller than above cutoffs; 10% 
of Abies concolor and 20% of all other species), we also measured diameter at stump 
height (40cm above ground level) and collected two crown radius measurements (long 
and short sides of the tree crown). Sampling rates were the same as those presented by 
Fulé et al. 1997, but Abies concolor was sampled at a lower rate because of its 
widespread abundance at each site. For large live trees and the sample of small live trees, 
we collected increment cores at 40cm above ground level. More accurate tree ages can be 
obtained by coring closer to ground level, but age data is used in conjunction with 
measured tree size to determine historical tree size (Bakker et al. 2008); tree size shows 

 
70 
 
large variation below 40cm due to butt swell (Fulé et al. 1997). We used these data (of 
tree age) to develop species-specific growth rates for historical reconstructions. Finally, 
we determined the spatial location of all live trees and historical structures using an 
Impulse 400 surveying laser and Mapstar compass (Laser Technology Inc., U.S.A.), with 
accuracy within 0.1m and 0.1◦, respectively. 
 
We mounted, surfaced and cross-dated all increment cores in the laboratory 
according to standard dendrochronological techniques (Stokes and Smiley 1968). If 
increment cores were partially rotten or did not intersect pith (tree center), we estimated 
the number of rings to pith using a transparent estimator sheet (Applequist 1958).  Cores 
that were not within 10 years of pith were excluded from the age analysis.  
 
Data Analysis – Objective 1, Describe the spatial and temporal dynamics of dry mixed-
conifer forests on the Mogollon Rim, AZ, USA  
 
We reconstructed stand structure, species composition, and spatial pattern using 
the historical reconstruction model of Bakker et al. (2008). Huffman et al. (2001) 
demonstrated that an earlier version of this model has minimal bias in reconstructing 
historical forest structure in the Southwest. For all analyses, we reconstructed forest 
conditions in 1879, the year of widespread fire exclusion in the area (Huffman et al. 
2015). We assumed that this was the time at which forest structure and processes began 
to deviate from the NRV. Additionally, we reconstructed forest conditions for 1910 (30 
years after fire-exclusion) and for 1983 (immediately after most timber harvests) to 
quantify the relationships between tree recruitment, established overstory trees, and 

 
71 
 
harvested areas. 
 
The reconstruction model of Bakker et al. (2008) relies on a combination of 
dendrochronological data, species-specific size-age relationships calculated across many 
sites in the Southwest, and exponential models of wood decomposition. When the pith of 
increment cores predated 1879, we used the proportional reconstruction method 
described by Bakker (2005) to determine tree size in 1879. Any trees with establishment 
dates after 1879 were not considered to have been present in the 1879 reconstruction. For 
trees without age data, and for all historical remnants, historical tree size was predicted 
using species-specific backgrowth models. These predictive models “backgrow” trees 
beginning at the year of data collection (2014; for live trees), or at the estimated death 
year (based on exponential decay models; for historical remnants.) These methods of 
historical reconstruction are further described by Bakker et al. (2008). 
 
We calculated the number of live trees ha-1, the amount of live basal area ha-1, 
percent canopy cover, quadratic mean diameter (QMD), and Reineke's stand density 
index (Reineke 1933) as measures of absolute and relative forest density for 1879 and 
2014. All metrics provided are for trees > 5cm DBH. Stand density index (as provided) is 
the number of 25.4 cm trees ha-1 as a function of the total number of live trees ha-1 and 
the QMD. We also estimated canopy cover using the buffer and clip tools in ESRI 
ArcGIS 10.2. (ESRI 2011). We defined canopy cover as the proportion of the total plot 
area covered by measured or estimated tree crowns. When not measured (and for all 
historical trees) we estimated crown size using species-specific non-linear regressions of 
tree diameter to crown radius. We developed the fitted model for Populus tremuloides 

 
72 
 
from data on the San Francisco Peaks, AZ, USA (n=32, Sánchez Meador et al. 
unpublished data), because of sample size limitations on the Mogollon Rim (n=6). 
Sample size used for model development ranged  27-363 for all species (Appendix-Table 
4). Models of diameter to crown radius for all coniferous species had R2 values of 0.76-
0.89. Models for hardwood species had R2 values of 0.19-0.34. Though model fits for 
hardwood species were poor, these equations were still used because residuals for the 
predictive models did not demonstrate heteroscedascity. Including nearest neighbor 
distance or height as additional variables in multiple regression models did not 
significantly improve model fit. 
 
We examined changes in species composition using ecological importance value 
(EIV), a measure of relative species dominance on a site determined by combining the 
measurements of basal area and live trees (by species) into one standardized metric 
(Curtis and McIntosh 1951). Our method differs from the original EIV method of Curtis 
and McIntosh (1951) because it does not incorporate presence/absence across multiple 
sites as a third variable of species dominance. Our formula was as follows: 
 
where X is the target species of analysis, and EIV is the ecological importance value for 
species X on a given site. 
 
We also created stem maps and diameter distributions for each site for both 1879 
and 2014, and contemporary standing age distributions for each site. Because we did not 
collect age data for all live trees on all sites, age distributions were estimated by 
multiplying the number of trees sampled in each 10-year bin by an expansion factor 

 
73 
 
(based on the number of trees dated out of the total sampled). We did not correct for the 
time needed to grow to 40cm in height, which probably varies by species and site.  
To determine how historical conditions on our sites relate to the established NRV, 
we combined the results of all studies of reference conditions summarized in Reynolds et 
al. (2013), or completed more recently (Matonis et al. 2013), that reported both tree 
density (trees ha-1) and basal area (m2 ha-1) for a given site. We developed 95% 
confidence intervals for historical and contemporary conditions of the previous studies 
meeting these qualifications, and compared the findings from our sites to these intervals. 
 
We used a combination of spatial analyses to quantify mean patterns at the site 
extent and the range and variability of fine-scale structural elements for both 1879 and 
2014 (individual trees, small groups, and large groups; Anselin 1995, Larson and 
Churchill 2012). We also examined spatial autocorrelation of size and species to gain 
further insight into the ecological function of these ecosystems. All spatial analyses for 
this project were completed in the R environment (R Core Team, 2014). Specifically, we 
used the “spatstat” package (Baddeley and Turner 2005) for point pattern analysis, and 
the “spdep” package (Bivand 2014) for tests of spatial autocorrelation. 
 
1. Average Patterns at the Site Extent 
 
To characterize global spatial patterns at the site extent, we calculated the Clark 
and Evans (1954) R index for all trees (>5cm) on each site for both 1879 and 2014. Clark 
and Evans R, a first-order point pattern statistic, is a ratio of the average nearest neighbor 
distance of a given pattern to the expected distance of a Poisson point process with the 

 
74 
 
same density (Clark and Evans 1954). For each site, we also performed one-sided 
significance tests for the R index based on 999 Monte Carlo simulations of complete 
spatial randomness (CSR). For this test, Ha: R index less than under simulations of CSR, 
indicating significant aggregation of events. P-values for this test are given as the rank of 
the observed R index among the R indices for the 999 simulations of CSR divided by 
1000 (number of simulations plus the observed pattern). We corrected for edge effects in 
this analysis using a guard correction (i.e., reduced sample; Baddeley and Turner 2005). 
The tested extent was the outer boundary of the plot minus the maximum observed 
nearest neighbor distance for the given dataset (on all sides).  
 
As a further measure of spatial pattern that incorporates changes in scales at the 
site extent (second order), we performed univariate Ripley's K analyses (Ripley 1977) 
following the L transformation of Besag (1977). Though the paired correlation function 
(PCF; Stoyan and Stoyan 1994) has seen increased use recently because of its ease of 
interpretation (e.g. Fry et al. 2014), the Ripley's K analysis allows direct comparison to a 
greater number of published studies (Larson and Churchill 2012), and both tests are 
statistically valid if interpreted correctly (Baddeley et al. 2014). For each point pattern, 
we tested for homogeneity (trees equally likely to be present on majority of site; an 
assumption of the Ripley's K analysis) using the spatial scan test at a radius of 16.5m 
(Kulldorff 1997). This radius, derived from analysis of a 1x1m LiDAR-derived DEM, 
corresponds to the size of drainages or changes in slope on each site that might result 
greater densities in parts of a given site, and, therefore, an inhomogeneous pattern. 
 
To develop confidence envelopes for each Ripley's K analysis, we performed 999 

 
75 
 
Monte Carlo simulations of complete spatial randomness. The upper and lower bounds of 
these pointwise envelopes are the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile values (of simulations and 
the observed pattern) at each distance in the test interval. We performed these tests at 
distances of 0-50m with 1m breaks. To determine if aggregation was statistically 
significant (for a given pattern) we used the Diggle, Cressie, Loosmore, and Ford (DCLF) 
goodness of fit test (described in Loosmore and Ford 2006). We used a one-tailed test 
between 0 and 30m, corresponding to the range of reported patch sizes in southwestern 
ponderosa pine forests (Reynolds et al. 2013) and the minimum and maximum observed 
patch sizes in dry mixed-conifer forests in the West (North et al. 2007, Matonis et al. 
2013). Patterns were determined to be significantly different from random (rejecting the 
null hypothesis of complete spatial randomness) if p-values for the DCLF test were < 
0.05. For any site-level patterns demonstrating significant aggregation, we also fit a 
model of a Matérn cluster process (using minimum contrast methods) to the given point 
pattern (Matérn 1960; as used in Baddeley et al. 2014). Fitting this model allows for the 
estimation of mean patch sizes in the given dataset (Baddeley et al. 2014). To correct for 
edge effects in the Ripley's K analyses, we used isotropic edge correction (Ripley 1988), 
which reduces the weight of points adjacent to the site boundary to the overall pattern. 
 
We performed global and local Moran’s I analysis for all trees by diameter in both 
historical and contemporary datasets (Cliff and Ord 1981). These analyses determine if 
trees of similar size are growing in close proximity to one another (global), and the scale 
at which this occurs (local). We determined p-values for these analyses with 999 random 
permutations of the original observed pattern; p-values were one-sided, and were the rank 

 
76 
 
of the observed pattern within the 999 simulations divided by 1000. Lower ranks showed 
greater relative autocorrelation. We also performed local Moran's I analyses (for both 
contemporary and historical diameter) for trees on each site, producing autocorrelograms. 
For each autocorrelogram, p-values (at each 2m lag distance of 2-50m) were adjusted for 
multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method (Bonferroni 1938; p=observed p * 
number of comparisons).  
 
2. Range and Variability of Fine-Scale Structural Elements 
 
Many previous studies of tree spatial pattern have focused solely on stand-scale 
patterns and average patterns across study areas (Larson and Churchill 2012). Ripley's K 
analysis can help to infer the mean patch size if a pattern displays aggregation, but does 
not describe the range and distribution of group sizes (Larson and Churchill 2012, 
Reynolds et al. 2013). We used a group delineation method first employed by Larson and 
Churchill (2008) and developed from the continuum percolation method of Plotkin et al. 
(2002). With this method, trees must be within a given lag distance of another live tree to 
be considered part of a group. To determine group membership we used a 6m lag 
distance, following Sánchez Meador et al. (2011). In addition, we used measured and 
estimated crown radii to determine group membership. This “crown radius method” 
projects circular buffered polygons onto each tree based on measured or estimated crown 
radius and determines if overlap occurs between adjacent crowns. The crown radius 
method simply assumes that any trees with overlapping crowns are part of a given group. 
A combination of both patch delineation methods is useful for two reasons: 1) the 

 
77 
 
biological definition of tree groups involves contiguous groups of trees with interlocking 
crowns, and is not solely based on distance between trees (Reynolds et al. 2013), and 2) 
models are inherently imperfect and exact reconstruction of tree size and crown radius is 
unlikely (Sánchez Meador et al. 2010), so point proximity (without weighting by tree 
size) can be a useful metric to identify biological interactions.  
 
To correct for edge effects, we used a “reduced sample” method for all patch 
delineation procedures (similar to Lydersen et al. 2013). To perform this correction, we 
created an interior buffer 10.6m within the site boundary. This distance corresponds to 
the maximum observed crown radius measurement on any tree on our study sites, and 
reduces the impact of tree crowns outside the plot perimeter. To be included in the final 
tally, an individual tree must be within the buffered plot area. Tree groups are removed 
from the analysis if they are entirely outside of the buffered area. Because very large tree 
groups may begin within the buffered area, continue through the buffer, and extend off 
the plot, it is possible that we are under-representing the size of some large tree groups 
(Lydersen et al. 2013). 
 
We binned groups into three distinct size classes: single trees, small groups (2-4 
trees), and large groups (5+ trees). These bin sizes were based on historical mean group 
sizes reported in Sánchez Meador et al. (2011) for southwestern ponderosa pine forests, 
and Lydersen et al. (2013) for mixed-conifer forests in the Sierra Nevada. Large groups 
were the same size or greater than the largest mean patch sizes reported in these two 
studies. 
 

 
78 
 
Data Analysis – Objective 2, Provide new information concerning the spatial 
relationships of trees both within and between species  
 
For analysis of within-species patterns, we performed Univariate Ripley's K 
analysis for each of four different species groups: 1) hardwoods (Acer grandidentatum, 
Quercus gambelii, Populus tremuloides, and Robinia neomexicana), 2) conifer species 
with intermediate fire and shade tolerance (Pinus strobiformis, and Pseudotsuga 
menziesii), 3) Abies concolor only, and 4) Pinus ponderosa. Species were grouped 
because of relatively similar species silvics (Burns and Honkala 1990a, Burns and 
Honkala 1990b). For example, all hardwoods on our sites tend to re-sprout from shared 
root systems of other nearby individuals. These four analyses (for hardwoods, mid-
tolerants, fire-intolerant/shade-tolerant Abies concolor, and fire-tolerant/shade intolerant 
Pinus ponderosa) provide information on four distinctly different functional groups that 
can be compared across multiple sites. We pooled results from each analysis (using the 
pool.envelope function in spatstat; Baddeley and Turner 2005) that had greater than 25 
observations (for both 1879 and 2014 separately) to display the pattern for each species 
group; small sample sizes can produce abnormally large values of the test statistic at a 
given scale. This “pooling” of multiple samples produces a weighted mean envelope, 
where the weight for a given site is based on the number of points in each analysis 
divided by the total number of points in all analysis being pooled.  
 
To analyze bivariate relationships between species groups, we performed a Monte 
Carlo permutation test (999 simulations) of the Join Count statistic (Cliff and Ord 1981). 
This analysis tests for spatial autocorrelation of binary variables (1=tree of a test species, 

 
79 
 
0=tree of any other species), and determines if members of a given species tend to 
intermix with other species or if they are spatially segregated (significant autocorrelation 
by species). We performed this analysis for each species in both historical and 
contemporary datasets, pooling the results of ranks within the simulations from each site 
with a weighted average. The weight for a given test was based on the number of 
individuals of species x on a given site, divided by the total number of species x across all 
sites. We then determined the p-value by dividing the weighted mean statistic by 1000 
and subtracting the subsequent value from 1. For example, if weighted mean rank for all 
tests was 112, then p=0.888. 
 
We also performed the Ripley's Bivariate K test (Lotwick and Silverman 1982) to 
understand the scales of attraction and inhibition between overstory trees and 
regeneration. We performed this test for the reconstructed 1879 overstory and first cohort 
after fire exclusion (1879-1910), and for the reconstructed 1983 overstory and the first 
cohort following timber harvests in the 1980's (1983-2014). For these analyses, we 
developed 95% confidence envelopes using 999 random shifts of regeneration relative to 
original overstory trees. These methods test the antecedent hypothesis of spatial 
dependence between overstory and regeneration (Goreaud and Pélissier 2003). We tested 
for significant interaction between the two types of points using the two-tailed variation 
of the Maximum Absolute Deviation test at all distances because we had no a priori 
estimate of interaction distance (Baddeley et al. 2014). We performed this analysis for 
recruitment of all species at each site, and performed separate analyses for individual tree 
species. 

 
80 
 
 
 Finally, we used chi-square contingency analysis (Pearson 1900) to compare the 
distributions of different tree species across patch sizes. We used this analysis to 
determine the likelihood of individuals of a given species being isolated single trees, 
members of small groups (2-4 trees), and members of large groups (5+ trees). In this 
analysis, we combined results from both patch delineation methods (6m fixed distance 
and crown overlap) into one matrix and divided the matrix by two, thus giving each 
delineation method equal weight without artificially increasing sample sizes. We 
compared observed group membership to expected group membership for each species 
across all sites in 1879 and 2014 (Ha: interaction between species and group membership 
for a given tree). Following recommendations in Frankfort-Nachmias and Leon-Guerrero 
(2011), we only performed this analysis for species that had at least two observations per 
cell (single tree, small group, large group), and ensured that at least 80% of all cells had 
at least five observations. These restrictions satisfy assumptions of sample-size that can 
influence the analysis (Frankfort-Nachmias and Leon-Guerrero 2011). Species meeting 
these restrictions in the 1879 reconstruction are: Abies concolor, Pinus ponderosa, 
Populus tremuloides, Pseudotsuga menziesii, and Quercus gambelii. Only Salix 
scouleriana and Populus tremuloides were excluded in the analysis of contemporary 
(2014) group membership. We acknowledge that removing species from the analysis can 
have influences on subsequent results.  
If chi-square analysis revealed statistically significant differences between 
observed and expected values (α=0.05), we also performed post-hoc analysis by 
comparing standardized Pearson Residuals to the critical threshold of the distribution 

 
81 
 
(also with α=0.05), thereby determining if the deviation was significantly different than 
the expected value for a given cell (Agresti 2002). We performed this post-hoc analysis 
using the “polytomous” package (Arppe 2013) in R. 
 
Our null hypothesis for all tests was “no relationship”, or “no difference from 
complete spatial randomness.” We hypothesized (Ha1) that Abies concolor would have a 
greater propensity to grow in mixed species groups and in larger groups because of its 
shade tolerance and intolerance of fire. We also hypothesized (Ha2) that Pinus ponderosa 
would grow in small groups and as isolated single trees, showing a greater propensity to 
grow in a spatially segregated manner, in openings and away from individuals of other 
species. Finally, due to vegetative reproduction strategies (Burns and Honkala 1990b), we 
hypothesized (Ha3) that hardwood species would be more likely to be members of groups 
and would show significant autocorrelation by species. 
 
Case Studies vs. Replicates 
 
Because of the variability in Southwestern dry mixed-conifer forests, and between 
our sites, we present many of the analyses for the sites independently and use standard 
deviation to describe the spread between sites rather than standard error. In this sense, our 
four sites are four independent case-studies within dry mixed-conifer ecosystems of the 
Southwest. For certain spatial analyses, for example in describing species-specific spatial 
patterns, the sites were pooled to combine all individuals of a given species. In these 
cases, the questions being asked relate to the overall pattern of a given species and sites 
are treated as replicated samples from a larger population. 

 
82 
 
 
Results 
Objective 1 – Density and Structure 
 
Overall tree density (for trees > 5cm dbh) increased markedly on each of our sites 
between 1879 and 2014 (Figure 3.2-West Leonard site only, Table 3.3-all sites). 
Estimated historical densities were between 80-159 live trees ha-1 (mean=129.5, standard 
deviation or sd=35.1) and 4.9-13.0 m2 of basal area ha-1 (mean=10.1, sd=3.5). 
Contemporary densities were between 427 and 1069 live trees ha-1 (mean=744.3, 
sd=295.3) and 36.9-44.6 m2 of basal area ha-1 (mean=41.9, sd=3.4). Canopy cover also 
changed drastically between 1879 and 2014. We estimate that historical canopy cover 
was between 8.7 and 17.5 percent (mean=14.8, sd=4.2). In 2014, canopy cover was 
consistently high across all sites, with a range of 51.0-56.7 percent (mean=54.7, sd=2.5). 
East Barbershop (159 trees ha-1, 11 m2 of basal area ha-1, 17.5 percent canopy cover), 
East Bear (149 trees ha-1, 13 m2 of basal area ha-1, 17.3 percent canopy cover), and Hi 
Fuller (130 trees ha-1, 11.4 m2 of basal area ha-1, 15.8 percent canopy cover) had higher 
historical densities, and West Leonard had the lowest historical density (80 trees ha-1, 4.9 
m2 of basal area ha-1, 8.7 percent canopy cover). 
 
Quadratic mean diameter did not change dramatically over this time period. In 
1879, mean QMD (for all sites) was 31.1 cm (sd=2.7). In 2014, mean QMD was 28.2 cm 
(sd=6.6). Contemporary diameter distributions follow the a “reverse j” pattern with 
progressively fewer trees in larger size classes. Historically, the diameter distributions 
showed an irregular uneven-aged structure. The majority of live standing trees 

 
83 
 
established in the decades following 1879 (e.g. Hi Fuller Site, Fig. 3.3e). Sampling rates 
to make these conclusions are relatively high. Of 1204 increment cores sampled, 862 
were within 10 years of intersecting pith. We successfully dated 16.9% of all live trees 
and 63.2% of all large live trees (conifers greater than 40cm and hardwoods greater than 
20cm) on the sites. 
 
Objective 1 – Species Composition 
 
Fire-intolerant and shade-tolerant species have increased in relative abundance 
when compared to historical levels (Figure 3.3). On the Hi Fuller, East Bear, and West 
Leonard sites, Pinus ponderosa was the most dominant species historically (EIV values: 
105.5, 133.8, 108.2, respectively). Hi Fuller and East Bear also had relatively high levels 
of Quercus gambelii (EIV 38.4, 24.4), and only minor components of Abies concolor and 
Pseudotsuga menziesii. East Barbershop, a more mesic site, was dominated by a mixture 
of Quercus gambelii (EIV 65.2), Abies concolor (EIV 44.4), and Pinus ponderosa (EIV 
38.9) in the 1879 reconstruction, with minor components of Populus tremuloides, 
Pseudotsuga menziesii, and Acer grandidentatum. Contemporarily, Abies concolor and 
Pseudotsuga menziesii are the dominant species on Hi Fuller, East Barbershop, and West 
Leonard. Pinus ponderosa is still the most prevalent species on the East Bear site. 
 
Shortly after 1879, the assumed year of fire-exclusion, early-seral and shade-
intolerant species (Pinus ponderosa especially) successfully regenerated, occupying 
growing space (e.g. Hi Fuller Site, Figure 3.2e). Between 1900 and 1920, all sites showed 
a shift in recruitment to mid-tolerant Pseudotsuga menziesii and shade-tolerant Abies 

 
84 
 
concolor. Following timber harvests in the 1960's and 1980's, there was again a peak in 
shade-intolerant recruitment (e.g. Hi Fuller Site, Figure 3.2e). 
 
 
Objective 1 - Average Patterns at the Site Extent 
 
Based on Clark and Evans R analyses, only one of our sites, East Barbershop, 
demonstrated statistically significant aggregation historically (R=0.7732, p<0.0001). 
Patterns on the Hi Fuller (R=0.9655, p=0.315), East Bear (R=0.9541, p=0.219), and West 
Leonard (R=1.1, p=0.767) sites were not significantly different from CSR. Contemporary 
distributions of live trees showed statistically significant aggregation on East Barbershop 
(R=0.7934, p<0.0001), and West Leonard (R=0.91, p<0.001) sites, but were not different 
from random on Hi Fuller (R=1.00 p=0.566) or East Bear (R=1.05, p=0.939) sites.  
 
Ripley's K analyses (Fig. 3.5) revealed multiple scales of aggregation historically 
and contemporarily, suggesting that trees grew in groups of varying sizes. Hi Fuller, East 
Bear, and East Barbershop showed statistically significant aggregation in the 1879 
reconstruction, with mean patch sizes of 0.115, 0.052, and 0.002 hectares (respectively). 
West Leonard did not exhibit significant deviation from the confidence envelopes of 
CSR, but showed a trend towards aggregation at about 10m. All sites had patterns that 
exhibited aggregation in 2014, primarily with very small mean patch sizes. Hi Fuller, 
East Bear, East Barbershop and West Leonard all have contemporary mean patch sizes 
less than 0.05 ha (see Figure 3.4). 
 
Global Moran's I analyses revealed that groups on the sites likely had a mix of 

 
85 
 
tree sizes historically (no significant spatial autocorrelation by size; p-values: Hi 
Fuller=0.451, East Bear=0.294, East Barbershop=0.494, West Leonard=0.966). 
Contemporarily, three of four sites exhibit statistically significant autocorrelation by size 
(α=0.05; p-values=East Bear=0.002, East Barbershop=0.001, West Leonard=0.004). Hi 
Fuller was not autocorrelated by size. Local Moran's I analysis provided no substantial 
insight into the scale at which these relationships occur (Figure 3.5, Appendix-Figures 4-
6). Only the East Barbershop site demonstrated statistically significant autocorrelation 
(α=0.05) at multiple lag distances (see Figure 3.5b). This site had even-sized patches (in 
2014) that were 4-26m in radius. 
 
Objective 1 - Range and Variability in Fine-Scale Structural Elements 
 
We found considerable variability in the tree group sizes between methods used 
(6m fixed distances, and crown delineation) and between sites (see Table 3.4). The use of 
a fixed 6m distance tended to predict that a greater number of trees were members of 
groups than the method based on crown overlap. Based on the 6m fixed distance, the 
largest tree group (historically) was 18 trees (on East Barbershop). Based on crown 
overlap, the largest group on any of the sites (historically) was 9 trees (on East Bear).  
Historically, mean group sizes ranged from 1.4-3.3 trees (Table 3.4). In 2014, the 
majority of trees were in large groups across all sites, and mean group sizes ranged from 
5.5-311 trees (Table 3.5). The maximum group size in 2014 was 367 (for the crown 
overlap method) to 621 (for the 6m fixed distance method; Table 3.5). More productive 
sites and those with an important component of hardwoods had larger mean group sizes 

 
86 
 
(e.g. East Barbershop). Our least productive site (West Leonard) was dominated by 
individual trees and small groups. 
 
 
 
Objective 2 - Average Patterns at the Site Extent by Species/Functional Group 
 
Species groups demonstrated differing spatial patterns at multiple scales, as is 
reflected in the results of Ripley’s K analysis (Figure 3.6). Abies concolor, the most 
shade tolerant/fire-intolerant conifer on our sites, exhibited increasing aggregation to 3 
meters historically and was random beyond this distance (Figure 3.6a). This species did 
not exhibit statistically significant aggregation in 1879 based on the goodness of fit test 
for the model of CSR (p=0.32). Abies concolor patterns were aggregated in 2014 
(p<0.01), with the peak in aggregation at 10m (Figure 3.6e). Mid-tolerant species 
(Pseudotsuga menziesii and Pinus strobiformis) had a slightly different pattern (Figures 
3.6b and 3.6f). Historically, individuals of these species (like Abies concolor) showed a 
trend toward aggregation at short distances but were random at most scales (p=0.62). 
Contemporarily, aggregation for these species was significant (p=0.04) and occurred at 
finer scales (than Abies concolor) suggesting small groups of two-three adjacent trees. 
Pinus ponderosa showed significant aggregation historically (p-value=0.01; Figure 3.6c). 
Peaks in aggregation for this species occurred at scales of 6-10 meters. Pinus ponderosa 
species had a random distribution in 2014 (p=0.48; Figure 3.6g). Hardwood species in the 
analysis showed little evidence of aggregation in 1879 (p=0.26; Figure 3.6d), but high 
levels of aggregation across all scales in 2014 (p<0.01; Figure 3.6h). Historical hardwood 

 
87 
 
patterns were driven (primarily) by Quercus gambelii and Populus tremuloides; 
contemporary patterns were driven by a mixture of species including: Quercus gambelii, 
Acer glabrum, and Robinia neomexicana. 
Join count analysis revealed that species groups also differed in respect to their 
level of spatial autocorrelation (tendency to grow in close proximity to individuals of the 
same species). Abies concolor individuals did not exhibit significant autocorrelation by 
species either historically (p=0.80) or contemporarily (p=0.82). Mid-tolerant species were 
intermixed with other species, and did not demonstrate substantial repulsion or attraction 
(p=0.55) historically. Though not significantly so, mid-tolerant individuals tended to 
grow in close proximity to one another and away from individuals of other species in 
2014 (p=0.14). However, Pinus strobiformis and Pseudotsuga menziesii differed in their 
historical patterns of interspecific interaction. Pinus strobiformis showed statistically 
significant spatial autocorrelation by species in 1879 (p=0.02), while Pseudotsuga 
menziesii was not spatially autocorrelated (p=0.74). Pinus ponderosa demonstrated no 
spatial autocorrelation historically (p=0.47), but exhibited increased (albeit insignificant) 
spatial autocorrelation in 2014 (p=0.20). Historically, hardwoods showed insignificant 
spatial autocorrelation (p=0.24), and were more autocorrelated in 2014 (p=0.12). 
 
Objective 2 - Patterns of Recruitment 1879-1910 
 
As shown in Figure 3.7, tree recruitment between 1879 and 1910 was either 
attracted to, or randomly distributed around, existing overstory trees (from the 1879 
reconstruction). Recruitment on Hi Fuller and East Barbershop, the two sites that have 

 
88 
 
the highest proportion of shade-tolerant species, was attracted to the established overstory 
at most scales, though this trend was not statistically significant on the East Barbershop 
site (Hi Fuller: p=0.03, East Barbershop: p=0.12). East Bear and West Leonard showed 
no strong relationships between the 1879 overstory and the first cohort after fire 
exclusion. 
 
Objective 2 - Patterns of Recruitment 1983-2014 
 
There were 423 cut stumps on our sites, or 6.2% of all trees and remnants 
sampled. Pinus ponderosa (193 stumps), Pseudotsuga menziesii (120 stumps) and Abies 
concolor (96 stumps) were the most intensively harvested. There were also 12 Quercus 
gambelii and 2 Pinus strobiformis stumps on the sites. Average size of stumps (at 40cm 
above ground level) was highest for Pinus ponderosa (40.27 cm), Quercus gambelii 
(36.98 cm), and Abies concolor (33.47 cm), and was lower for Pseudotsuga menziesii 
(29.76 cm) and Pinus strobiformis (24.5 cm). Harvests were evenly distributed across 
sites, 76 stumps on East Barbershop, 141 stumps on West Leonard, 90 stumps on Hi 
Fuller, and 116 stumps on East Bear. Harvests appeared to be targeting ridges and flatter 
areas rather than steep slopes. O’Reilly et al. (2015) quantified growth releases for 
unharvested trees on our sites and found releases (that are likely attributed to timber 
harvests) in 1969 and 1988 and an earlier release in 1910. The 1910 release is likely due 
to a factor besides harvesting (B. Greco, personal communication, November 15, 2014). 
Harvests of large Pinus ponderosa may have also contributed to shifts in species 
composition on our sites between 1879 and 2014. 

 
89 
 
 
The relationship between stumps and successful regeneration following timber 
harvests shows a similar trend (Figure 3.8) to that displayed by recruitment between 1879 
and 1910. Recruitment between 1983 and 2014 showed an attraction to the established 
overstory, especially at distances less than 10m (Figure 3.8, a-c), and regeneration 
occurred away from cut stumps (Figure 3.8, d-f). Figure 3.10 describes this relationship 
by species group. Pinus ponderosa, Pseudotsuga menziesii, and Quercus gambelii, all 
either shade-intolerant or mid-tolerant species, were neither attracted to, nor repulsed by, 
stumps. Though Pinus strobiformis recruitment does show some statistically insignificant 
fine-scale attraction to stumps, this relationship is random at most scales. Abies concolor 
and Acer grandidentatum, two very shade tolerant species, tended to regenerate in areas 
that were not harvested. Perhaps most surprisingly, Robinia neomexicana, a known gap-
invader, did not appear to regenerate near stumps. 
 
Objective 2- Range and Variability in Fine-Scale Structural Elements, by Species 
 
Species was an important factor in influencing the proportion of trees in different 
group sizes; proportions of trees as individuals, small groups, and large groups deviated 
significantly from expected values in the 1879 dataset (X2=44.45, p<0.0001; Table 3.5). 
Individuals of the other species were excluded because of sample-size limitations. Post-
hoc analysis revealed that Pinus ponderosa was significantly more likely to be found as 
isolated single trees than other species (standardized Pearson residual=2.42, p<0.05), and 
in large groups less frequently than other species (standardized Pearson residual=-3.12, 
p<0.05).  Quercus gambelii were significantly less likely to be found as isolated 

 
90 
 
individuals than other species (standardized Pearson residual=-3.16, p<0.05). No other 
species analyzed showed statistically significant deviations from expected values, but 
Abies concolor, Populus tremuloides, and Quercus gambelii trended towards membership 
in large groups historically (Table 3.5). Pseudotsuga menziesii showed no clear trends in 
group membership. In 2014, greater than 89% of all trees were present in large groups, 
and there did not appear to be any evidence of a relationship between species and group 
membership (X2=2.5129, p=0.64; Table 3.6). 
 
Discussion 
 
Forest structural changes have occurred in many dry mixed-conifer forests of the 
Southwest since Euro-American settlement, leading to functional changes in these 
ecosystems (Fulé et al. 2002, Mast and Wolf 2004, Heinlein et al. 2005, Fulé et al. 2009, 
Huffman et al. 2015). These relationships can be partially exhibited through the spatial 
interactions between individual trees. With this project we had two primary objectives: 1) 
describe the spatial and temporal dynamics of dry mixed-conifer forests on the Mogollon 
Rim, AZ, USA, and 2) provide new information concerning the spatial relationships of 
trees both within and between species. Objective 1 is focused on overall trends and 
patterns, while objective 2 is focused on niche differentiation between species groups and 
its relationship with spatial pattern. 
 
Objective 1 - Describe the spatial and temporal dynamics of dry mixed-conifer forests on 
the Mogollon Rim, AZ, USA

Our sites, as a whole, were not significantly different from previous studies of the 
NRV for dry mixed-conifer forests in the Southwest (Figure 3.10). The 95 percent 
confidence intervals for these previous studies of the NRV stretch between 7 and 23 m2 
of basal area ha-1, and 25-200 live trees ha-1. West Leonard, our least productive site, is 
the only site that deviates outside of these confidence intervals with 4.9 m2 of basal area 
ha-1 (with 80 live trees ha-1, the site does not deviate from the interval for live trees ha-1). 
The West Leonard site has the lowest historical density of any reconstructed dry mixed-
conifer site in the Southwest.  
Management based on the NRV should reduce forest densities in many of these 
fire-prone ecosystems in the Southwest and focus on retaining species that were dominant 
historically such as Pinus ponderosa and Quercus gambelii. Less fire-tolerant species 
were present as well, though these species (notably Abies concolor) were less prevalent 
than they are today. Mean and maximum tree group size both increased between 1879 
and 2014, aligning with the findings of other studies of mixed-conifer forests in the West 
(e.g. Churchill et al. 2013, Lydersen et al. 2013).  
 
Based on Ripley's K analysis, three of four sites were significantly aggregated in 
1879, suggesting that silvicultural treatments focusing on the retention of tree groups may 
best mimic the NRV in productive dry mixed-conifer forests on the Mogollon Rim, AZ. 
Tree spatial patterns might exhibit aggregation for any number of reasons. Past work has 
suggested that patch formation can occur in open areas of bare mineral soil after local 
disturbance (Stephens and Fry 2005, Sánchez Meador et al. 2009, Larson and Churchill 
2012). However, competition between seedlings and understory communities (Puhlick et 

 
92 
 
al. 2012), and local environmental and soil characteristics (Abella and Denton 2009) also 
be important factors in creating an aggregated/patchy structure. Random patterns, also 
common in frequent-fire forests (Schneider 2012), can occur on productive sites with no 
substantial barriers to tree regeneration, though these findings (in ponderosa pine forests) 
differ from our results in the mixed-conifer forest type. The research area of Schneider 
(2012) appears to have a similar soil type and climate to those of our sites; the primary 
difference is the overstory species composition. The added overstory species present in 
mixed-conifer ecosystems likely alter the relationship between individuals, resulting in 
different spatial patterns and increases in ecosystem complexity (relative to ponderosa 
pine and pine-oak forests).  
 
Forest canopy continuity increased and total open space decreased on our sites 
between 1879 and 2014. Though we did not directly quantify opening structure, discrete 
openings probably had an important role in the function of frequent-fire forests (Larson 
and Churchill 2012, Reynolds et al. 2013, Dickinson 2014). Our results showed that 
canopy gaps may have inhibited initial tree recruitment following fire exclusion and 
following timber harvests. These results are consistent with findings in other mixed-
conifer forests in the West (North et al. 2004), but contrast strongly with some ponderosa 
pine forests in the Southwest (Sánchez Meador et al. 2009). Differences in findings may 
reflect variations in livestock grazing intensities that would have altered the competition 
between seedlings and the understory (Larson and Churchill 2012; Puhlick et al. 2012). 
The study area of Sánchez Meador et al. (2009) was closer to urban centers than our sites 
on the Mogollon Rim, and experienced continued cattle grazing into the early 1900’s. 

 
93 
 
Understory community composition may have also differed between ponderosa pine and 
mixed-conifer ecosystems historically because of differing overstory composition (Korb 
et al. 2007), slightly different disturbance regimes (Swetnam and Baisan 1996, Brown et 
al. 2001), and changes in available moisture in the understory. Patterns of tree 
establishment vary between species (Bigelow et al. 2011). Shade-tolerant individuals, 
when present, could more easily establish in the understory of established groups. This is 
less likely in ponderosa pine forests (Sánchez Meador et al. 2009; Puhlick et al. 2012), 
where trees tend to establish in small even-aged patches, in canopy gaps, and on bare 
mineral soil (Cooper 1961, Mast and Veblen 1999, Sánchez Meador et al. 2009). 
 
Temporal trends in species dynamics on our sites reflect colonization by early 
seral species (such as Robinia neomexicana and Pinus ponderosa) when stand densities 
are low and growing space is plentiful. As densities increased, the successful regeneration 
of shade-tolerant and mid-tolerant species (e.g. Abies concolor, and Pseudotsuga 
menziesii) increased. These species are now the most dominant components of many dry 
mixed-conifer forests on the Mogollon Rim (this study, Huffman et al. 2015). Heinlein et 
al. (2005) and Fulé et al. (2009) suggest that Pinus ponderosa and Populus tremuloides 
have declined in relative dominance on their sites on the San Francisco Peaks and in 
southwestern Colorado (respectively). This is true of Pinus ponderosa in forests on our 
sites, but our results also suggested that Populus tremuloides may have only been a minor 
component of dry mixed-conifer forests on the Mogollon Rim historically. The frequent 
fire intervals and relatively warm temperatures on the Mogollon Rim (Huffman et al. 
2015) may have made establishment of Populus tremuloides less successful than on other 

 
94 
 
mixed-conifer sites in the Southwest. Our results contrast with studies on the San 
Francisco Peaks, AZ (Heinlein et al. 2005), Kaibab Plateau, AZ (Binkley et al. 2006, 
Vankat 2011), and the San Juan Mountains, CO (Fulé et al. 2009). Many of these studies 
used similar methodologies (to our study) and found a greater number of Populus 
tremuloides than were present on our sites. 
 
Objective 2 - Provide new information concerning the spatial relationships of trees both 
within and between species 
 
We had three hypotheses relating to species groups and their spatial pattern. Ha1: 
Abies concolor would have a greater propensity to grow in larger groups intermixed with 
other species, because of its shade tolerance and fire intolerance. Ha2: Pinus ponderosa 
would grow in small groups and as isolated single trees, showing a greater propensity to 
grow in a spatially segregated manner away from individuals of other species. Ha3: 
hardwood species would be more likely to be members of groups and would show 
significant autocorrelation by species. 
 
Spatial patterns of Abies concolor were not significantly different from CSR. 
Individuals of this species tended to grow intermixed with other species and were more 
likely to occur in larger groups; however, these results were not statistically significant so 
we could not accept Ha1. Lydersen et al. (2013) also identified a weakly positive 
association between Abies concolor and large group membership in the Sierra Nevada. 
Mast and Wolf (2004) demonstrated positive spatial associations between Abies concolor 
trees and Pinus ponderosa trees (in larger size-classes), suggesting that Abies concolor 

 
95 
 
recruitment might have been facilitated by established groups of Pinus ponderosa. 
Successful tree regeneration for this species showed a weakly negative relationship with 
stumps and a positive relationship with established overstory trees. Cool, mesic, closed 
canopy microclimates are beneficial to tree recruitment for Abies concolor (Burns and 
Honkala 1990a).  
 
Pinus ponderosa was significantly aggregated at scales < 30m historically, but did 
not exhibit significant spatial autocorrelation, suggesting that the species was often 
intermixing with individuals of other species. Therefore we could not accept Ha2, that this 
species grew in a spatially segregated manner. Pinus ponderosa requires large amounts of 
light for successful regeneration (Bigelow et al. 2011), and it is possible that seedling- 
and sapling-sized Pinus ponderosa would demonstrate greater spatial autocorrelation. 
This species also did not appear successfully regenerate in openings following fire 
exclusion or timber harvests. However, Pinus ponderosa were significantly more likely 
to grow as isolated individual trees and significantly less likely to grow in large groups 
(than other species).  
 
Surprisingly, deciduous hardwood species did not show significant aggregation at 
any scales historically. This may be due to some inaccuracy in historical reconstruction of 
hardwood species (because of relatively quick decomposition rates), as recognized by 
Matonis et al. (2013). In 1879, Quercus gambelii were significantly less likely to be 
found as individual trees than other species analyzed, and they trended towards 
membership in small groups and large groups (though these findings were not statistically 
significant). Because of sprouting capability and limitations to more mesic microsites 

 
96 
 
(e.g. Acer grandidentatum), it makes sense that many hardwoods on our sites would 
demonstrate aggregation and spatial autocorrelation, and results from our sites 
(contemporarily) support these hypotheses. The effect of frequent fire on many of these 
hardwood species is unknown, and additional research is needed in to hardwood ecology 
in forests of the Southwest. 
 
Forest spatial patterns are the complex result of interactions between established 
overstory trees, the understory environment (Puhlick et al. 2012), disturbance history 
(Stephens and Fry 2005, Sánchez Meador et al. 2009), and autecological traits of 
individual species (Lydersen et al. 2013). Many species appear to have an inherent spatial 
pattern, but these patterns are also impacted by variations in soil, climate, and other 
factors across their distribution (Abella and Denton 2009). The interactions between 
species groups (Mast and Wolf 2004) and interspecific variations in response to 
disturbance events (Sánchez Meador and Moore 2010, Reynolds et al. 2013) are also 
important determinants of spatial pattern.  
 
Heterogeneity of Pattern and Process in Dry Mixed-Conifer Forests 
 
Overstory groups and open areas create very different microenvironmental 
conditions (Meyer et al. 2001) and may create variations in processes such as fire 
behavior (Fry and Stephens 2010). In the Front Range of Colorado, proximity to 
grasslands is thought to be an important driver of historical fire frequency, because of the 
abundance and continuity of fine fuels in these areas (Gartner et al. 2012). This influence 
on fire behavior may also be an important contributor to fine-scale structural 

 
97 
 
heterogeneity in dry mixed-conifer forests of the Southwest. Frequent surface fires 
probably limited successful tree regeneration because it takes several years for seedlings 
and saplings to be able to tolerate surface fire (Bailey and Covington 2002). If grassy 
openings were more prone to frequent burning, then closed canopy groups might have 
provided safe sites for successful regeneration of species that could tolerate the lower 
light availability in this microenvironment. From the perspective of a seedling or sapling, 
frequent fire forests were areas of high relative stress, and facilitation was probably an 
important factor in determining the locations of tree recruitment (see Bertness and 
Callaway 1994). Fry and Stephens (2010) identified a negative association between Pinus 
jeffreyi canopies and fine fuels in the understory, even in areas that had not experienced 
surface fire events for at least two decades. These fuel dynamics might lead to the 
inhibition of surface fire immediately beneath these tree canopies. However, fire intensity 
(and related tree mortality) is often highest with low moisture levels in the duff layer 
(Varner et al. 2007) and fuel moistures are typically lowest between the stem and the 
dripline of established overstory trees (Hille and Stephens 2005). In the absence of fire, 
regeneration on our sites was positively associated with the established overstory, and 
negatively associated with harvested openings, but determining if this relationship holds 
true under an active fire regime requires additional study.  
Mortality due to pathogens, insects, and parasitic plants could provide an 
explanation for the negative relationship between tree recruitment and openings. 
Armillaria solidipies (a common root disease) is known to affect as many as 30 percent 
of live trees in some mixed-conifer forests of the Southwest (Dils et al. 2015). Sanitation 

 
98 
 
treatments could remove some of the infected individuals, but the pathogen is still present 
in the harvested opening. The continued presence of root disease may then limit 
successful tree establishment in these openings. Similarly, western spruce budworm 
(Choristoneura occidentalis) and dwarf mistletoes (Arceuthobium spp.) spread top-down, 
and can cause rapid mortality of small trees (Brookes et al. 1987, Castello et al. 1995, 
Conklin and Fairweather 2010). Dwarf mistletoes also spread more quickly in relatively 
open-canopied areas (Castello et al. 1995, Conklin and Fairweather 2010), such as from 
tree groups to adjacent canopy gaps. Browse by ungulates can also have important effects 
on seedlings and saplings (Fairweather et al. 2008), and may have limited tree 
recruitment in some areas. 
 
Fine-scale heterogeneity provided a positive feedback loop in many western 
forests that led to further heterogeneity in disturbance and recruitment (Stephens and Fry 
2005, Sánchez Meador et al. 2009, Fry and Stephens 2010, Larson and Churchill 2012). 
It is possible, then, that restoration of these structural conditions and a natural disturbance 
regime may prevent the need for multiple timber harvests to maintain resistance and 
resilience to future disturbance. Given the high costs of mechanical thinning, low value 
of wood products removed (Huang et al. 2013), and the detrimental impacts of harvesting 
(Ampoorter et al. 2012), it makes sense to minimize re-entry whenever possible. 
However, the incorporation of an active fire regime (e.g. Lydersen and North 2012) is 
something that may not be feasible under current federal policy (Stephens and Ruth 
2005), or in all locations in the Southwest because of proximity to established 
development. Fulé and Laughlin (2007) suggested that prescribed or managed fire may 

 
99 
 
accomplish the goals of forest restoration, though under certain circumstances this 
management strategy could cause unacceptable mortality of large, older trees (Fulé et al. 
2004). The results of managed or prescribed fire on creating or maintaining fine-scale 
spatial structure of forests is a poorly understood concept. This is an important area for 
future work because mechanical thinning may be infeasible in many situations. 
Stand-scale and fine-scale spatial patterns are important to incorporate into 
silvicultural treatments (Reynolds et al. 2013). Stand-scale patterns, or the average 
pattern at the extent of the management area, can be included as an overarching goal in 
silvicultural prescriptions; the fine-scale range and distribution of group sizes can then be 
used to develop marking guides, and as evaluation criteria for the success of these 
treatments. It also appears that individual species have unique roles in these patterns in 
mixed-species forests, an additional consideration for forest managers. Shade-tolerant 
conifers are more likely to be found in large groups than other species, and shade-
intolerant conifers are less likely to be found in groups. Sprouting hardwoods also tend to 
grow in groups. We found no evidence to suggest that groups of trees had similar 
diameters, or consisted of individual species. Therefore, targeting a range of group sizes 
(1-18 trees or more), often with multiple species and with a range of tree diameters may 
most closely align with the natural ecology of these dry mixed-conifer ecosystems on the 
Mogollon Rim. 
 
Study Limitations and Future Work 
 
Our study has several limitations. We did not reconstruct every tree (specifically 

 
100 
 
logs, snags, and stumps) using dendrochronological methods; snags, stumps, stump holes, 
and downed logs (from 2014) made up over half of the trees that were estimated to have 
been alive on our sites in 1879. Estimation of decomposition rates and models of tree size 
also provide compounding errors that may cause our results to deviate from actual 
historical conditions. Dendrochronological sampling of some snags, logs, or stumps may 
allow for model verification and validation in future studies (see Mast et al. 1999). 
Hardwoods may decompose more quickly than conifers (Matonis et al. 2013), and certain 
conifers may decompose more quickly than others (Abies concolor; North et al. 2007). 
Other studies have recognized these issues, and acknowledged that variations in 
decomposition rates may lead to bias in reconstruction (Fulé et al. 1997, Huffman et al. 
2001, North et al. 2007, Matonis et al. 2013). Lastly, species identification for historical 
structures can be difficult in the field, especially without the presence of bark. These 
difficulties could lead to possible misidentification of some individuals. 
Mortality of trees in the late 1800’s and early 1900’s might result in the loss of 
some historical remnants. Huffman et al. (2001) reported that approximately 6 percent of 
historical trees could not be located with dendrochronological reconstruction of 
ponderosa pine forests in the Southwest, and this could be due to decomposition, fire, or 
other factors that result in the loss of historical remnants. The loss of these historical 
remnants could be a larger concern in mixed-conifer forests, though little research has 
been done on this topic. In mixed-conifer forests on the north rim of the Grand Canyon, 
Vankat (2011) found that forest densities increased between the late 1800’s and 1935, but 
decreased between 1935 and 2014, primarily because of declines in densities of Populus 

 
101 
 
tremuloides. These declines could be attributed to increasing ungulate browse, drought, 
and the exclusion of fire, and may have happened in other parts of the Southwest as well 
(Binkley et al. 2006, Fairweather et al. 2008). Given the relatively rapid decomposition of 
Populus tremuloides after ground contact (Hogg and Michaelian 2014), historical 
densities of this species are probably higher than predicted in many historical 
reconstructions of mixed-conifer forests (because of loss of remnants). These factors 
should be equivalent across most studies however, and our results showed lower densities 
of Populus tremuloides than were reported in other areas (Heinlein et al. 2005, Fulé et al. 
2009). Loss of remnants due to management actions could also be a concern (Fulé et al. 
1997), but harvesting began relatively late in this portion of Coconino National Forest (B. 
Greco, personal communication, November 15, 2014) and was probably not earlier than 
the late 1960’s on any of our sites (O’Reilly et al. 2015). Many stumps present on our 
sites showed very little evidence of decay.  
Early mortality (late 1800’s, early 1900’s) due to insects, pathogens, and parasitic 
plants could also lead to fewer historical remnants present in contemporary forests. Many 
of these factors, notably western spruce budworm (Choristoneura occidentalis) and 
dwarf mistletoes (Arceuthobium spp.) can cause rapid mortality in smaller trees (Brookes 
et al. 1987, Castello et al. 1995, Conklin and Fairweather 2010) that might decompose 
more quickly (than larger trees). Multiple outbreaks of Choristoneura occidentalis have 
occurred in the Southwest between the late 1800’s and current day (Swetnam and Lynch 
1993). This insect preferentially targets Pseudotsuga menziesii and Abies concolor 
(Swetnam and Lynch 1993), and mortality could have led to underestimates of historical 

 
102 
 
densities of these species in reconstructions (specifically in smaller size classes). 
Douglas-fir beetle (Dendroctonus pseudotsugae) may have caused recent mortality of 
some trees on the West Leonard site. This beetle is causing widespread mortality of 
Pseudotsuga menziesii in mixed-conifer forests in Arizona (Dils et al. 2015) and 
preferentially targets large trees (Hadley and Veblen 1993). Past tree mortality due to 
Dendroctonus pseudotsugae could also lead to some inaccuracy in reconstructions, 
though there was little evidence of large snags or coarse woody debris from Douglas-fir 
individuals, and little is known about past outbreaks of this insect species in this area. 
 
Our results did not deviate substantially from the results reported in previous 
studies (Figure 3.10) and other work suggests that the methods used in this study are 
well-founded, at least for coniferous species and Quercus gambelii (Huffman et al. 2001, 
Moore et al. 2004). A greater knowledge of the effectiveness of these methods in mixed-
species forests may prove useful, especially because dendrochronological reconstructions 
have become prevalent in mixed-species forests in other regions in the western United 
States (Larson and Churchill 2012).  
 
One-hectare areas may be too small to understand some aspects of structure and 
spatial pattern in these forests historically (e.g. larger groups and gaps), and the analysis 
of only four sites on sedimentary soils limits our ability to make broad conclusions across 
forests in the Southwest. Larger plot sizes, and the use of remote sensing techniques to 
quantify reference conditions in areas with active fire regimes may provide useful 
avenues for future work. 
 
Further research is needed in different geographic areas within the Southwest, 

 
103 
 
specifically southern Utah, the Kaibab Plateau and Madrean Sky Islands in Arizona, and 
forests in northern and western New Mexico. Studies at different elevations and across 
multiple soil types will help to develop a greater understanding of the factors driving the 
spatial patterns of dry mixed-conifer forests in the Southwest. Studies along climatic 
gradients or using climate analog sites (similar to Churchill et al. 2013) may be especially 
useful given the magnitude of expected climatic changes in the Southwest (Garfin et al. 
2013). 
 
Conclusions 
 
Dry mixed-conifer forests in the Southwest have undergone considerable changes 
since Euro-American settlement in the late 1800's (Fulé et al. 2002, Mast and Wolf 2004, 
Heinlein et al. 2005, Fulé et al. 2009). Densities have increased and species composition 
has shifted, primarily as a result of the exclusion of low-moderate severity fires across 
much of the landscape. Some researchers suggest that many forests in the western United 
States (with a dominant component of Pinus ponderosa) have a history of mixed or high-
severity fire, and that management for open forest conditions and frequent, low-severity 
fire may not fit within the natural range of variability (Williams and Baker 2012, Odion 
et al. 2014, Sheriff et al. 2014). These conclusions are certainly valid in some forests in 
the West, but restoration treatments are particularly appropriate in southwestern forests 
(Schoennagel et al. 2004), where historical structural conditions were primarily the result 
of frequent disturbances of low-severity (Covington and Moore 1994, Allen et al. 2002), 
even in the dry mixed-conifer forest type (Swetnam and Baisan 1996, Heinlein et al. 

 
104 
 
2005, O’Connor et al. 2014, Huffman et al. 2015).  
 
A knowledge of the natural range of variability, and an improved knowledge of 
historical processes in these ecosystems provide very important input into the 
development of a management framework that targets ecosystem resilience (Reynolds et 
al. 2013, DeRose and Long 2014). Beyond targets of tree density and species 
composition, a greater knowledge of forest spatial structure, the role of individual species 
within it, and positive or negative associations between species groups all provide 
important information that can be utilized by managers in future treatments. The natural 
range of variability is an important consideration for management in frequent-fire forests 
in the West (Fulé 2008, Reynolds et al. 2013), but contemporary issues such as climate 
change (Millar et al. 2007, Garfin et al. 2013), predicted increases in fire size and severity 
(Westerling et al. 2006), shifts in species dominance due to drought (McIntyre et al. 
2015), and the introduction of invasive species (Keeley 2006, Geils et al. 2010), provide 
additional considerations for forest managers.

Table 3.3: Summaries 
of tree density and size 
metrics for study sites 
on the Mogollon Rim, 
AZ, USA following 
dendrochronological 
reconstruction of 1879 
and in 2014. All metrics 
are provided for trees > 
5cm diameter at breast 
height (DBH, 1.37m). 
Canopy cover is given 
as the percent of the 
total site covered by the 
vertical projection of 
tree crown. Reineke’s 
stand density index 
(SDI; Reineke 1933) is 
a commonly-used 
measure of stand 
density that gives the 
number of 25.4 cm 
(DBH) trees ha-1 that 
would be present on a 
site of equivalent 
density. SDI is given in 
metric values. 
Maximum SDI values 
(metric) for Pinus 
ponderosa-
,Pseudotsuga menziesii-
, and Populus 
trumuloides-dominated 
stands are 
approximately 1100, 
1450, and 1600 
respectively (Shaw and

Implications to Management 
 
 
Increases in forest density, changes in tree size- and age-structure, and shifts in 
species composition have occurred in many southwestern forests following Euro-
American settlement in the late 1800’s (Covington and Moore 1994, Mast et al. 1999, 
Fulé et al. 2002). The effects of these structural changes, in combination with current and 
future climatic change (Westerling et al. 2006, Garfin et al. 2013), bring up difficult 
questions that must be addressed by forest managers in the Southwestern region in 
upcoming years. Increases in fire size and severity (Westerling et al. 2006) are only one 
symptom of other problems facing forests; drought-related mortality (Allen et al. 2010), 
and other alterations to ecosystem function are also major concerns (Reynolds et al. 
2013).  
Active management and a laissez-faire style of no interference offer two distinctly 
different approaches in response to these problems. Some researchers question the 
importance of active management, stating instead that contemporary forest structure and 
patterns of disturbance are not outside of the natural range of variability (Williams and 
Baker 2012, Odion et al. 2014). While these conclusions are valid in some areas in the 
western United States, restoration treatments and active forest management are 
particularly appropriate in many southwestern forests (Schoennagel et al. 2004), where 
historical forest conditions were influenced by frequent, low-severity fire (Covington and 
Moore 1994, Allen et al. 2002), even in the dry mixed-conifer forest type (Swetnam and 

 
139 
 
Baisan 1996, Heinlein et al. 2005, Huffman et al. 2015). Many of these forests had much 
lower densities than are present today (Reynolds et al. 2013, Chapter 3-Figure 3.10). 
Active management in dry mixed-conifer forests in the Southwest is both prudent and 
valuable. 
 
Management partially based on the natural range of variability (NRV) of frequent-
fire forests is likely to increase ecosystem resistance and resilience in the face of climate 
change (Fulé 2008). These terms reflect the ability of ecosystems to experience 
disturbance with only minimal change to structure (resistance), or maintain similar 
functional attributes following disturbance (resilience; DeRose and Long 2014). Site-
specific restoration treatments of these forests may not be feasible (or even advisable) 
under the projections of future environmental conditions, but a knowledge of the NRV 
can provide important input into the development of a management framework that 
targets long-term resilience (Millar et al. 2007, Reynolds et al. 2013, DeRose and Long 
2014). Metrics quantifying tree density, species composition, spatial pattern and the role 
of individual species within it, and positive or negative associations between species 
groups, all provide important information that can be utilized by managers in future 
treatments. 
 
Current Management Strategies 
 
Dry mixed-conifer forests are present on tribal lands, privately owned properties, 
Department of Interior lands, and USDA Forest Service lands in the Southwest (USGS 
2004). Management differs based on ownership, between land management agencies, and 

 
140 
 
even within a given parcel. For this reason, summaries of current management strategies 
in this forest type are general and may not apply in all places. Currently, many dry 
mixed-conifer forests on US Forest Service lands in the Southwest are managed with 
uneven-aged techniques (small group selection, individual tree selection, free thins) when 
not already identified as restricted-use habitat for the Northern Goshawk (Accipter 
gentilis), Mexican Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis), or other species of special 
consideration (J. Youtz, personal communication, Nov. 20, 2014); occasional deviations 
into even-aged management techniques (shelterwood, clear cut, seed tree) are made when 
insect mortality, pathogens, or other tree diseases reach epidemic levels (Reynolds et al. 
2013). Uneven-aged techniques in these forests typically have a planned 30-year re-entry 
period, and silviculturists attempt to maintain densities between 14 and 23 m2 of basal 
area ha-1 (60-100 ft2 of basal area ac-1). Based on an estimate of tree lifespans (of about 
210 years) in the forest type, silviculturists plan on approximately 6-7 age classes (J. 
Youtz, personal communication, Nov. 20, 2014). Typically, group selection methods (or 
“modified individual-tree selection with group retention”) are utilized, with the goal of 
encouraging the recruitment of shade-intolerant and fire-tolerant species (especially 
Pinus ponderosa and Populus tremuloides, but also Pinus strobiformis, Pinus flexilis and 
Pseudotsuga menziesii). Marking crews are often told to preferentially leave individuals 
of the more shade-intolerant and fire-tolerant coniferous species, especially in the larger 
size classes. Greater proportions of Abies concolor (all size classes) and Pseudotsuga 
menziesii (small size classes) are often removed (J. Youtz, personal communication, Nov. 
20, 2014). 

 
141 
 
 
Forest managers often attempt to encourage the regrowth of Populus tremuloides 
through fencing, “jackstrawing”, and other techniques meant to reduce the impacts of 
ungulate browsing (Fairweather et al. 2008). For other hardwood species such as Quercus 
gambelii and Acer grandidentatum, most groups are left unharvested to provide thermal 
cover and habitat for wildlife (J. Youtz, personal communication, Nov. 20, 2014). 
Because of its tendency to invade openings, group selection treatments are often avoided 
in close proximity to established populations of Robinia neomexicana (Reynolds et al. 
2013). 
 
Multi-scaled heterogeneity has become an important goal for managers working 
US Forest Service lands in the Southwest (Reynolds et al. 2013), and this was an 
important structural characteristic of many frequent-fire frests in the West historically 
(Larson and Churchill 2012). At the fine-scale (< 4ha extent), forests had a mix of 
individual trees and groups of trees with interlocking crowns, discrete openings, and 
grassy interspaces (Larson and Churchill 2012, Reynolds et al. 2013). At the 
intermediate-scale (4-400 ha extent; hereafter referred to as “stand-scale”), trees could be 
arranged in an aggregated spatial distribution (trees tending to grow in groups), a random 
spatial distribution, or, less commonly, in a uniform spatial distribution (evenly spaced) 
(Abella and Denton 2009, Reynolds et al. 2013). At a coarse-scale (> 400 ha extent; 
hereafter referred to as the “landscape-scale”), forests probably had a variety of densities, 
seral stages, and species compositions. These differences were based on disturbance 
history, aspect, slope position, soils, and many other factors (Evans et al. 2011, Reynolds 
et al. 2013).

Management Considerations and Research Findings 
Density 
 
Current management of dry-mixed conifer forests in the Southwest aligns 
relatively well with previous studies of the natural range of variability (NRV) in these 
ecosystems. The 95 percent confidence interval of these previous studies stretches 
between 7 and 23 m2 of basal area ha-1 (about 30-100 ft2  ac-1), and 25-200 trees ha-1 (10-
80 trees ac-1), and includes the range of 14-23 m2 currently targeted by Forest Service 
silviculturists (Chapter 3-Figure 3.10). The majority of dry mixed-conifer forests in the 
Southwest are currently denser than the established NRV (Chapter 3-Figure 3.10), and 
our results in Chapter 3 do not substantially expand these estimates. With the exception 
of the West Leonard site, which has the lowest density observed in any study of reference 
conditions in southwestern dry mixed-conifer ecosystems, all of our sites were within the 
established natural range of variability (NRV) in the 1879 reconstructions. There is 
considerable variability in dry mixed-conifer forests, and incorporating this variability 
into silvicultural practice is a difficult, yet crucial, endeavor. Prescriptions should account 
for local variability in tree density and species composition based on site index values, 
understory plant associations, and the pattern and density of historical remnants when 
determining leave-tree density and regeneration treatments for a given stand (Reynolds et 
al. 2013). 
 
Managers should consider lower residual tree densities (than the current range of 
management) in some dry mixed-conifer forests in the Southwest. Several studies of 

 
143 
 
reference conditions in these ecosystems suggest that forests had lower densities than the 
current range of 14-23 m2 of basal area (Chapter 3, Heinlein et al. 2005). Areas with the 
lowest observed densities are on southwest facing slopes with relatively poor soils (see 
Heinlein et al. 2005, and “West Leonard” site in Appendix-Tables 2-3). The sites with the 
highest densities are typically on more mesic sites with a lower proportion of Pinus 
ponderosa (historically), a higher number of shade-tolerant conifers (historically), or on 
more productive soils (e.g. “Swamp Ridge” site in Fulé et al. 2002, and “East 
Barbershop” site in Chapter 3).  
 
Species Composition  
 
Our study corroborates the findings of many others (Fulé et al. 2002, Mast and 
Wolf 2004, Heinlein et al. 2005, Fulé et al. 2009) that have documented shifts in species 
composition in southwestern mixed-conifer forests since Euro-American settlement in the 
Southwest. On our sites on the Mogollon Rim, AZ, Pinus ponderosa was the most 
dominant species historically, averaging 56.5 trees ha-1, and 5.21 m2 of basal area 
(Appendix-Tables 2 and 3). In 1879, Pinus ponderosa made up about half of the trees and 
total basal area across all sites. Contemporary data show that Pinus ponderosa now 
averages 102.5 trees ha-1 and 10.16 m2 of basal area on our sites (Appendix-Tables 2 and 
3). The majority of the density increases occurred on the East Bear site, with 
comparatively smaller increases on the rest of the sites. Individuals of this species should 
be thinned where it is still a dominant or co-dominant overstory component, but at a 
lower rate than other more shade-tolerant species.  

 
144 
 
Abies concolor and Pseudotsuga menziesii were both important historically as 
well, each making up 10-20% of the total trees and basal area on our sites (20-40% total). 
Abies concolor tended to show slightly higher population numbers than Pseudotsuga 
menziesii, but this relationship varied between sites. Increases in tree density for these 
species are drastic. They should be heavily thinned (either through mechanical treatment, 
prescribed fire, or managed wildfire) in most dry mixed-conifer forests on the Mogollon 
Rim. Retention preference could be given to larger, more fire-resistant individuals. Pinus 
strobiformis was especially dominant on our most rocky and unproductive site (West 
Leonard), but was not widespread historically or contemporarily. Given the current 
consideration of white pine blister rust (a tree disease caused by the invasive pathogen 
Cronartium ribicola), maintaining a vigorous population of Pinus strobiformis across the 
landscape may help to develop genetic resistance (to this tree disease) in the future 
(Conklin et al. 2009, Geils et al. 2010).  
Populus tremuloides was also not a major component on our sites, with the 
exception of a small drainage in East Barbershop (currently dominated by Acer 
grandidentatum); however, reconstruction of historical Populus tremuloides populations 
is somewhat uncertain (Vankat 2011, Matonis et al. 2013). Populus tremuloides densities 
were lower than those reported in previous studies using similar methods (e.g Heinlein et 
al. 2005), and reestablishment may be a lower priority across this portion of the Mogollon 
Rim than on other sites in northern Arizona. Browsing by elk was readily apparent on our 
sites, and changes in wildlife policy might help to reestablish Populus tremuloides 
populations without active forest management (Fairweather et al. 2008).  

 
145 
 
 
Quercus gambelii was the second most prevalent species on our sites historically, 
averaging 30.5 trees ha-1 and 1.32 m2  of basal area ha-1. In a review of changes in 
Quercus gambelii density and size structure, Abella and Fulé (2008) suggest that 
densities have increased and average size of individuals of this species has decreased 
(relative to historical levels) in pine-oak forests in the Southwest. These changes are said 
to be the result of fire exclusion increasing the number of small stems and firewood 
harvesting removing large live (and standing dead) individuals (Abella and Fulé 2008). 
Though there was evidence of oak harvesting on our sites, quadratic mean diameter did 
not change substantially between 1879 and 2014 (23.2 cm and 23.6cm respectively), and 
we estimate that density of Quercus gambelii has more than doubled (both in live trees 
ha-1 and basal area-1) since Euro-American settlement. Increases in the recruitment of 
Quercus gambelii were apparent on the East Barbershop site after 1879, but were not 
readily apparent on the rest of the sites. Abella and Fulé (2008) argue that passive 
management of Quercus gambelii may not restore stand structural conditions to those 
consistent with the NRV. On our sites on the Mogollon Rim, there is no evidence to 
suggest a need to promote the growth of large Quercus gambelii, but removal of smaller, 
less fire-tolerant individuals is an appropriate management strategy. Similar to Pinus 
ponderosa, Quercus gambelii should be retained at higher rate than other species. Oaks 
are likely to increase in abundance under climate change in many places in the West 
(McIntyre et al. 2015), so the drought and fire tolerance of this genus is an important 
consideration for silviculturists. 
 
Our samples of Acer grandidentatum and Robinia neomexicana are too limited to 

 
146 
 
make strong inferences, but limited research suggests that these species might be able to 
tolerate the historical fire regimes on the Mogollon Rim, and probably existed in these 
areas historically (Stephens and Fulé 2005, Corbin and Page 2011). Stephens and Fulé 
(2005) report densities of about 60 Robinia neomexicana stems ha-1 on the Powell 
Plateau, a site with an active and frequent fire regime in the Grand Canyon, AZ. 
Similarly, Corbin and Page (2011) found that Acer grandidentatum re-sprouted well 
following topkill in two prescribed fires and a wildfire in northern Utah. On our study 
sites, few Robinia neomexicana individuals pre-dated Euro-American settlement, but 
these findings must be approached cautiously. Given the short-lived nature of the above-
ground portion of the plant, and (probably) rapid decomposition, we can not conclude 
that Robinia neomexicana has shown substantial increases in density between 1879 and 
2014. Fulé et al. (1997) also recognized these issues, and removed Robinia neomexicana 
from their analysis. Robinia neomexicana has value in these ecosystems, and increases 
the presence of available nitrogen and calcium in the soil (Klemmedson 1994). This 
species should, therefore, not be fully removed from forests. Greater research into 
hardwood ecology in this region is needed to determine historical prevalence of these 
species, and their relationship to frequent, low-severity fire regimes. Treatments of Acer 
grandidentatum with prescribed fire are likely to re-establish natural population levels of 
this species, and provide a useful avenue for adaptive management. Silvicultural 
treatments that do not create large canopy gaps adjacent to established Robinia 
neomexicana may prevent the expansion of this species beyond acceptable levels 
(Reynolds et al. 2013). The retention of approximately 60 stems ha-1 is an appropriate 

 
147 
 
goal for Robinia neomexicana where the species is already well-established (following 
Stephens and Fulé 2005). These treatment options are not drastic, and preserve options 
for a time when greater knowledge can be developed regarding the ecology of these 
species. 
 
Age and Size Structure 
 
 
Our results suggest that dry mixed-conifer forests on the Mogollon Rim were 
uneven-sized and probably uneven-aged. Trees did not show significant autocorrelation 
by size, so any groups of trees likely had a variety of tree sizes within them; groups of 
trees with similar diameters were probably not common historically. Diameter 
distributions suggest that shade-intolerant species were normally distributed at about 
25cm with fewer large and small trees. Shade-tolerants and hardwoods were more evenly 
spread across the distribution. Overall, trees tended to demonstrate an irregular uneven-
aged structure in our 1879 reconstructions. The largest trees on each site were Pinus 
ponderosa, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Pinus strobiformis, and Quercus gambelii, though the 
East Barbershop site also had several large Abies concolor. 
 
The different species present have a variety of regeneration strategies and 
periodicities, so evidence of clear cohorts of regeneration may not be as obvious as in 
southwestern ponderosa pine forests (Mast et al. 1999, Brown and Wu 2005). Strong 
inferences as to the number of cohorts and recommended cutting cycle/number of entries 
for uneven-aged management could be made with a thorough dendrochronological 
reconstruction of live and dead trees in this forest type. Studies similar to Mast et al. 

 
148 
 
(1999) would prove useful in the mixed-conifer forest type to determine target age 
structures for restoration treatments.  
 
Spatial Pattern 
Stand-scale and fine-scale heterogeneity may have provided a positive feedback 
loop in many western forests, facilitating future heterogeneity (Stephens and Fry 2005, 
Fry and Stephens 2010, Larson and Churchill 2012). For this reason, it is possible that 
management for structural heterogeneity and the reintroduction of a natural disturbance 
regime may prevent the need for multiple timber harvests to maintain resistance and 
resilience to future disturbance. Given the high costs of mechanical thinning, low value 
of wood products removed in the Southwest (Huang et al. 2013), and the detrimental 
impacts of harvesting (Ampoorter et al. 2012), it makes sense to minimize re-entry 
whenever possible. However, the incorporation of an active fire regime (e.g. Lydersen 
and North 2012) is something that may not be feasible under current federal policy 
(Stephens and Ruth 2005), or in all locations in the Southwest because of proximity to 
established development. 
A primary goal of our study was to develop a greater knowledge of historical tree 
spatial patterns in dry mixed-conifer forests of the Southwest. These findings can be 
explicitly incorporated into silvicultural strategies in the region. Overall spatial patterns, 
often described with first-order and second-order point pattern statistics, can help to 
inform land managers on their overarching goals for stand-scale heterogeneity in a given 
treatment area. These statistical methods, such as the Clark and Evans' R Index (Clark 

 
149 
 
and Evans 1954) or the Ripley's Univariate K analysis (Ripley 1977), quantify the 
average pattern across a given study area, and describe the pattern as aggregated, random, 
or uniform. Forests with aggregated patterns show a tendency to grow in explicit groups. 
In an aggregated pattern, individuals are closer to one another than could be expected due 
to random chance, usually based on site variability or an underlying biological process. 
Random patterns might show some grouping (primarily just due to chance), but also have 
many isolated single trees. Uniform patterns of trees are realtively uncommon in natural 
systems, but could result from minimum spacing-based thins (Larson and Churchill 2008) 
or a plantation environment. 
 
Pinus ponderosa and pine-oak forests show a gradient of pattern that appears to 
be related to site productivity. Forests with low site index values and having soils derived 
from cinder or basalt, tend to show very strong aggregation (Dyer et al. 2008, Abella and 
Denton 2009, Sánchez Meador et al. 2009, 2011). More productive sites underlain by 
limestone-derived soils are more likely to be randomly distributed, with only fine-scale 
aggregation (Schneider 2012). These changes could result from variations in rates of 
structural development (Larson et al. 2008) or, perhaps, differences in disturbance history 
or drought stress.  
Dry mixed-conifer forests show slightly different spatial patterns (than ponderosa 
pine forests) because of the added complexity of the overstory species composition. Less-
productive dry mixed-conifer forests tend to have smaller group sizes (Reynolds et al. 
2013), and are more likely to have been randomly distributed (Sánchez Meador et al. 
unpublished data), though only limited research has been done on this topic. More 

 
150 
 
productive dry mixed-conifer forests may have been more likely to have exhibited 
aggregation historically (see Chapter 3). At the fine-scale, incorporating group-retention 
strategies into silviculture becomes more important when patterns demonstrated 
statistically significant aggregation historically (Sánchez Meador 2011). This is because 
these patterns are driven by ecological processes inherent to local populations or site 
conditions. Managers can target aggregated or random tree distributions at the stand-scale 
in their goals and objectives, but a more explicit understanding of fine-scale variability in 
group structure and the distribution of open space helps to develop concrete targets that 
can be evaluated to determine treatment success (Larson and Churchill 2012, Churchill et 
al. 2013, Reynolds et al. 2013). 
 
Fine-scale variability in group structure (on our sites) differed based on the local 
site characteristics and species present. More mesic sites with substantial components of 
hardwoods showed a greater number of trees in groups with fewer individual trees (e.g. 
East Barbershop; see Chapter 3 – Table 4). Less productive sites were more-commonly 
dominated by isolated single trees and small groups (e.g. West Leonard site, Chapter 3). 
Abies concolor showed a tendency to grow in larger groups, while Pinus ponderosa 
tended to grow as isolated single trees, with fewer individuals as parts of large groups. 
Abies concolor also tended to grow intermixed with other species, while Pinus ponderosa 
was neither repulsed by nor attracted to other species. Hardwoods tended to grow in 
small or large tree groups, primarily with other hardwoods, and were less likely to grow 
as isolated individuals. Pseudotsuga menziesii showed no clear trends. This species was 
present across all group-sizes, but may intermix with other species. 

 
151 
 
 
Opening sizes probably showed substantial variation, as suggested by studies in 
other regions (Lydersen et al. 2013, Dickinson 2014, Fry et al. 2014), but quantifying 
openings was not a major goal of this study. Total open space was substantially higher 
than current levels on the Mogollon Rim; estimated mean canopy cover on our sites 
averaged 14.8% historically, and exceeded 50% on all sites contemporarily. Explicitly 
including opening sizes into treatment may be a valuable goal for managers, but openings 
can be difficult to quantify. Other studies have suggested that open areas were really the 
background matrix in the historical frequent-fire environment (Laughlin et al. 2006, 
Reynolds et al. 2013), rather than being discrete patches. 
 
Methods of Including Spatially Explicit Reference Conditions into Silviculture 
 
There are multiple strategies with which managers can target spatial heterogeneity 
at the fine-scale and stand-scale. One method is evidence-based restoration (Moore et al. 
1999). To implement this method, marking crews identify old trees, logs, snags, etc. and 
leave live trees in close proximity to these structures. This method is very site-specific, 
which is important if the primary goal of a treatment is restoration. This method is known 
to effectively re-create historical fine-scale spatial structure in ponderosa pine forests 
(Tuten et al. 2015), but no studies have tested the effectiveness of this method in dry 
mixed-conifer forests. Another common marking technique, the ICO (individuals, 
clumps, and openings) method described by Churchill et al. (2013, 2014) relies on bins of 
group sizes when developing prescriptions. After prescription development, marking 
crews attempt to retain the suggested number of groups of given sizes. This ICO method 

 
152 
 
is easily evaluated for success and is widely accepted in other regions in the West, but 
hasn’t been previously used in the Southwest. Given the variability of spatial patterns 
demonstrated by previous studies, this method would need to be tailored based on local 
site characteristics to be used an effective restoration tool. 
 
A key difference between the ICO method and the evidence-based mark is an 
underlying assumption about the location of tree groups. Evidence-based marking 
attempts to return a grouped structure in which tree groups are located in close proximity 
to their historical location. ICO guidelines do not consider the location of groups as 
explicitly. Managers must determine which marking methods best meet their objectives 
based on project goals, site conditions, and available resources. 
 
Specific Management Recommendations 
Mimicking natural patterns of stand dynamics and disturbance is of great 
importance in modern silviculture (O’Hara 2002, O’Hara and Ramage 2013). Through 
the reconstruction of historical forest structure and tree species composition, we are able 
to present specific management recommendations regarding these aspects of forests for 
use in future silvicultural treatments on the Mogollon Rim, AZ. Tree density, species 
composition, and spatial pattern are interacting factors in mixed-species stands, and must 
be considered simultaneously when planning management actions.  
First, we recommend the retention of 5-16 m2 of basal area ha-1 (25-70 ft2 ac-1), 
and 75-200 trees ha-1 (35-80 trees ac-1) in dry mixed-conifer forests on the Mogollon Rim 
(trees > 5 cm/2 in diameter at breast height). These recommendations are made with the 

 
153 
 
assumption that some mortality may occur post-treatment. Secondly, we recommend the 
use of uneven-aged management techniques to retain individuals across a range of 
diameter classes in dry mixed-conifer forests on the Mogollon Rim. Chapter 3-Figure 3.2, 
and Figures 1-3 in the Appendix can provide general guidelines for a desirable diameter 
distribution. Multiple cohorts should be present on each site, and these cohorts should be 
spatially intermixed. Retention of larger trees is an important goal on sites that show 
evidence of early logging. Reconstruction of historical size and age structure were not 
primary goals of our study, and further research is needed in these areas. 
In regards to species composition, we recommend preferential retention of healthy 
and vigorous Pinus ponderosa and Quercus gambelii on many dry mixed-conifer sites. 
Components of Pseudotsuga menziesii, Abies concolor, Populus tremuloides, and Pinus 
strobiformis were also important in these ecosystems historically. Our preference list for 
retention (high to low) is as follows: Pinus ponderosa, Quercus gambelii, Pinus 
strobiformis, Populus tremuloides, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Abies concolor. Across the 
landscape (in dry mixed-conifer forests), approximately 50 percent of basal area and live 
trees should be Pinus ponderosa, 15 percent should be Quercus gambelii, with 10-15 
percent each of Abies concolor and Pseudotsuga menziesii. We also recommend the 
retention of 10 percent or less of Pinus strobiformis, and Populus tremuloides in this 
forest type. These species likely had important roles in certain places, but do not appear 
to have been widespread historically. Harvests to Robinia neomexicana and Acer 
grandidentatum can be made when necessary, but we provide no specific 
recommendations for these species.  

 
154 
 
In dry mixed-conifer forests on the Mogollon Rim, managers should treat for an 
aggregated or grouped spatial structure at the stand-scale, with a wide range of group 
sizes (1-18 trees or more). Our findings suggest that approximately 30 percent of trees 
and basal area were isolated individuals, 45 percent of trees and basal area were in small 
groups (2-4 trees), and 25 percent of trees and basal area were in large groups (5 or more 
trees). Variation within these targets is an important consideration. Sites with more 
hardwoods and Abies concolor appear to have had larger group sizes historically. Pinus 
ponderosa should be retained more commonly as individual trees than other species, and 
hardwoods should be kept in groups more often than other species. Groups often had a 
mixture of tree diameters within them, and had multiple species as well. There is, 
however, some evidence for single-species groups, especially for Pinus ponderosa and 
Quercus gambelii. Abies concolor appears to have been a part of many mixed-species 
groups, often with Pinus ponderosa and Quercus gambelii. Established groups may 
facilitate the growth of this species. See Table 4.1 and Figure 4.1 for a more thorough 
description of recommendations regarding spatial structure, density, and species 
composition in dry mixed-conifer forests on the Mogollon Rim, AZ. 
The use of the ICO method of marking (Churchill et al. 2013, 2014) may be most 
intuitive for managers, because it is analogous to marking based on a target diameter 
distribution. This method of marking may also be most useful for incorporating our 
results into silvicultural prescriptions and marking guides in the Southwest. Incorporating 
“rapid assessments” meant to quickly characterize historical forest structure and species 
composition (see Sensibaugh et al. 2013) might help to further explain site variability and 

 
155 
 
help to better-inform these ICO methods. Our results help to quantify characteristics of 
historical forest structure, but are not meant to be representative of all dry mixed-conifer 
forests in the Southwest. Rather, our recommendations are a starting point for managers 
that can be adjusted based on local site-conditions and contemporary considerations of 
forest health (Reynolds et al. 2013). 
 
Conclusions 
 
Dry mixed-conifer forests in the Southwest have undergone considerable changes 
since Euro-American settlement. Tree densities have increased, and species composition 
has shifted, primarily as a result of the exclusion of low/moderate-severity fires across 
much of the landscape. Silvicultural treatments focusing on the reduction of forest 
densities and targeting multi-scaled heterogeneity, may improve ecosystem function and 
increase the resistance and resilience of forested ecosystems to disturbance (Reynolds et 
al. 2013). Density, species composition, and spatial pattern all varied substantially across 
the landscape, and the factors affecting this variability are beginning to become 
understood. The NRV is an important consideration for management in frequent-fire 
forests in the West, but contemporary issues such as climate change (Garfin et al. 2013), 
predicted increases in fire size and severity (Westerling et al. 2006), shifts in species 
dominance due to drought (McIntyre et al. 2015), and the introduction of invasive species 
(Keeley 2006, Geils et al. 2010), provide many important considerations for forest 
managers in the future.

Occasionally grew in groups with only P. ponderosa, but also grew in 
mixed-species groups. Less likely to be in large groups and more likely to
single trees than other species.
No specific recommendations for this species. Limited evidence suggests
that it may be occupying some sites previously occupied by P. tremuloide
Often growing in mixed-species groups, often a component of larger group
Tree groups often had a mix of tree sizes and multiple species within them
Single-species groups were also present for P. ponderosa, P. 
strobiformis , and Q. gambelii.
No specific recommendations for this species.Stephens and Fulé (2005) 
report densities of 24 tree ac-1 on the Powell 
Plateau, AZ, a site with continuous fire since the late 1800's. 
Less likely to be found as isolated as single trees and more likely to be fou
in groups than other trees. Often in single-species groups, but sometimes 
mixed with conifers, specifically A. concolor.
Found commonly as single trees, in small groups, and in large groups. Ofte
in mixed-species groups.
Tended to grow in groups more often than other species. Concerns of 
historical grazing impact and rapid decay may mean we are underpredictin
densities for this species. Probably not a major component though.
Appeared to dominate in certain habitat types (rocky slopes and harsher 
sites), but was not widespread. Contemporary patterns suggest this specie
can tolerate large groups, but this was not the case on our sites historically

Figure 3: Changes on the Hi Fuller site on the Mogollon Rim, AZ, USA between 1879 
(dendrochronological reconstruction) and 2014 (observed). Panels include historical (a) 
and contemporary (b) stemmaps  scaled by canopy area, historical (c) and contemporarily 
(d) diameter distributions for all live trees ≥ 5cm diameter at breast height (1.37m above 
ground level), and live standing age distribution (e). Note that the y-axes on panels c-e 
are broken with differing scales below and above the break. Colors for each species are 
scaled by relative shade tolerance ranging from blue (most shade tolerant) to red (least 
shade tolerant).  
 
Figure 4: Correlograms for the Hi Fuller site on the Mogollon Rim, AZ, USA based on 
(a) reconstructed (1879) diameter, and (b) contemporary (2014) diameter. Black points 
indicate statistical significance (α=0.05) at a given lag distance after Bonferroni 
correction for multiple comparisons. White points are not significantly different from the 
expected value at a given lag distance. Significance at small-scales indicates the presence 
of tree groups (where patch radius = lag distance) with relatively similar diameters.
