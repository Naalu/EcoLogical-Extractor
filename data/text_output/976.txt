Abstract
A field-based study was performed to broaden our knowledge of harvesting productivity, cost (stump-to-truck), and log value
recovery between cut-to-length (CTL) and whole-tree (WT) harvesting working side-by-side in two mixed-conifer stands in
northern Idaho. Each site included two replications of each of the harvesting options. Hourly harvesting productivity ranged from
1,163 to 5,428 ft3 per productive machine hour (PMH) and 1,350 to 6,552 ft3/PMH for the CTL and WT harvesting machines,
respectively. This result suggests that the WT harvesting system was more productive than the CTL harvesting because specific
tasks were assigned to each machine. Higher productivity of the WT harvesting system resulted in lower harvesting costs,
although the hourly machine rate for the WT harvesting system was slightly higher than for the CTL harvesting system. The CTL
harvesting system costs were $0.34/ft3 and $0.36/ft3 while the WT harvesting costs were $0.22/ft3 and $0.33/ft3 at the two sites.
Harvesting costs ($/ft3) were highly influenced by skidding or forwarding distance, log length and diameter, and machine
combinations. The WT harvesting recovered more sawlogs (large-end diameter > 8 in) and pulpwood (any snag, decayed log or
log below mill specified lengths), but less ton-wood (a log of large-end diameter < 8 in and top minimum diameter of 4 in) than
the CTL harvesting. Net revenue from the WT harvesting was higher than that from the CTL harvesting.
Timber harvesting is an essential tool for forestland
management. It is used for wood production, wildlife habitat
management, and to reduce fuels buildup and the associated
wildfire risks in the forest. Harvesting systems and methods
used for harvesting activities such as felling, processing, pri-
mary transportation to the landing area, loading, and log trans-
portation to the mill greatly affect overall harvesting cost, pro-
ductivity (volume of logs produced per hour during a harvest-
ing operation), overall profitability of harvesting operations,
and returns to a landowner (Han et al. 2004). Currently, about
55 percent of the world’s wood harvest is performed manually
with a chain saw while the remaining 45 percent is harvested
mechanically. Of the mechanically harvested portion, it has
been estimated that 65 percent is harvested using the whole-
tree (WT) harvesting system and the remaining 35 percent
using the cut-to-length (CTL) harvesting system (Ponsse
2005).
In the Pacific Northwest, CTL harvesting systems have
been increasingly used for thinning on gentle terrain because
they handle small-diameter trees very efficiently, provide a
safer, enclosed working environment, and consistently pro-
duce high-quality end products at a reasonable cost (Kellogg
et al. 1992). In CTL harvesting, all of the processing (delimb-
ing and bucking) occurs at the stump (Kellogg and Spong
2004) where trees are cut into mill specified lengths. For ex-
ample, trees are typically processed into a target length of 16.3
ft in northern Idaho when a fully mechanized CTL harvesting
system is used. The harvester fells, delimbs, and cuts trees into
logs. A forwarder then transports the logs from the stump area
to the landing area (central log collection area in the forest)
where trucks take them to the sawmill. The forwarder is also
often used to load logs onto the trucks.

A typical mechanized WT harvesting system often includes
four machines; feller-buncher, skidder, loader, and processor.
The feller-buncher fells and aggregates trees while the skidder
drags bunched loads of trees to the landing. At the landing,
these trees are processed by a processor into logs that are
loaded onto the truck using a loader.
The advantages and disadvantages of CTL and WT harvest-
ing systems have been well documented (Bettinger and Kel-
logg 1993, Meek and Plamondon 1996). The CTL harvesting
systems’s greatest disadvantages compared to WT harvesting
are the high initial cost of investment of each machine, repair
and maintenance of the machine’s complex computerized
system, and inability of the felling-processing machine to
handle stems with stump diameter larger than 22 in (LeDoux
and Huyler 2001). However, WT harvesting is at a disadvan-
tage because it requires more woods workers, supervision,
and support than CTL harvesting (Gingras 1994, LeDoux and
Huyler 2001). In addition, WT harvesting has higher potential
for soil compaction and disturbance because the skidder tends
to sweep duff and litter during whole-tree extractions, expos-
ing mineral soil (Hartsough et al. 1997).
A cost-efficient harvesting operation improves profitability
in timber production and overall competitiveness of the tim-
ber production sector (Efthymiou 2001). In some earlier stud-
ies, CTL harvesting costs were often comparable to or lower
than WT harvesting costs (Lanford and Stokes 1996). In con-
trast, two other studies found the CTL harvesting system to be
15 to 30 percent more expensive than WT harvesting (Gingras
1994, Yaoxiang et al. 2006). In these studies, harvesting cost
differences were primarily affected by machine productivity
as influenced by extraction distance and tree size. They also
found that WT harvesting was more productive than CTL har-
vesting (Gingras 1994, Yaoxiang et al. 2006). The higher pro-
ductivity of WT harvesting in these studies was due to specific
tasks assigned to each WT harvesting machine compared to
the felling-processing and forwarding functions often per-
formed by two machines in the CTL harvesting system.
CTL and WT harvesting productivity and cost are affected
by stand and harvesting variables such as tree size, removal
density, extraction distance, and operator skills (Andersson
1994, Egan 1999, Wagner et al. 2000, LeDoux and Huyler
2001, Kellogg and Spong 2004). Primary transportation costs
of trees or logs from the stump area to the landing area were
found to be the most expensive component of CTL and WT
harvesting systems in other studies (Han et al. 2004, Kellogg
and Spong 2004).
One of the goals in timber harvesting is to maximize rev-
enue while offsetting costs through high value recovery (Mur-
phy et al. 1996). Value recovery is a process whereby stems
are cut into logs according to predetermined specifications
with the goal of obtaining the highest possible value (Ian et al.
2004). Value recovery plays an integral part in determining
the profitability of harvesting operations since profits are de-
pendent on the volume produced and the unit value of the
products (Twaddle and Goulding 1989). In Quebec, Canada,
production differences were observed between CTL and WT
harvesting. The study demonstrated that CTL harvesting pro-
vided a better yield in terms of recovery of green merchant-
able wood. However, the production differences between the
two harvesting systems were due to differences in the vol-
umes of dead and sound wood, the number of windfalls, and
the number of unmerchantable trees (Favreau 1997). Contrary
to the study in Canada, another study revealed 11 percent
higher gross merchantable volume in favor of the WT harvest-
ing system but similar unmerchantable volume for the two
harvesting systems. The similar proportion of unmerchant-
able volume for the two systems suggests the possibility of a
comparable merchantable volume recovery by the two har-
vesting systems (Plamondon and Page 1997).
Much is known about harvesting productivity and how har-
vesting and stand variables affect operational efficiency of
mechanized harvesting systems (Kellogg et al. 1992), but
there are still discrepancies in results with respect to cost dif-
ferences between CTL and WT harvesting systems. Potential
revenue generated by these two harvesting systems may be
different since each method produces different log products.
This study was designed to broaden our knowledge of har-
vesting productivity, cost, and log value recovery through a
side-by-side comparison between CTL and WT harvesting
systems.
Method
Study site and system description
The study sites were located near the towns of Princeton
and Deary, Latah County, northern Idaho (Fig. 1). The two
sites were composed of Douglas-fir (Psuedotsuga menziesii),
grand fir (Abies grandis), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta),
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), western larch (Larix occi-
dentalis), white pine (Pinus strobes), and redcedar (Genus lu-
mis). The stand near Princeton was a 22-acre unit with average

ton sites, northern Idaho showing forwarder and crawler trail.

tree diameter at breast height (DBH) of 11 in, ground slope
range from 3 to 34 percent, and tree age ranging from 35 to 80
years old. The stand near Deary is a 48.1-acre stand with av-
erage tree DBH of 11 in, ground slope range from 2 to 32
percent, and tree age ranging from 70 to 130 years.
Each site was divided into four subunits and randomly al-
located to CTL and WT harvesting systems. In each subunit,
14 sample plots were laid out to collect preharvesting stand
inventory data. In each plot, tree height and DBH were mea-
sured to estimate basal area and total tree volume per acre. The
experimental design showed similarities in stand and ground
conditions between CTL and WT harvesting units at each site
(Table 1). There were no significant differences in mean
DBH between CTL and WT harvesting systems at the two
sites (p < 0.05).
Harvesting systems and operations
At the Princeton site, CTL harvesting operations used a
single-grip harvester (Valmet 500T) to fell and process trees
for 2 days before the forwarding operation began. This was
done for safety reasons and to provide sufficient logs to keep
the forwarder (Valmet 890T, with a squirt boom loader) pro-
ductive throughout the harvesting operation. The forwarding
operations were uphill at an average distance of 406 ft. A
Prentice 410DX loader was used for loading logs onto the
truck. For the WT harvesting operation, a continuous disc-
saw feller-buncher (Timbco 455EXL) was used to fell trees
for 1 day prior to skidding of trees by a crawler (CAT D-518).
Direction of the skidding operations was uphill, at an average
skidding distance of 426 ft. A grapple-processor (CAT) and a
Link-Belt 240LX log loader were used for tree processing and
log loading, respectively. The skidding and forwarding opera-
tions were uphill at a slope range from 3 to 34 percent.
At the CTL harvesting site near Deary, the same models of
harvester and forwarder were used but with different opera-
tors. Forwarding was downhill at an average forwarding dis-
tance of 919 ft. For the WT harvesting system, a bar-saw
feller-buncher (Timbco Hydro feller-buncher T435) was used
to fell trees 3 days prior to primary transportation of trees by a
crawler (CAT D-518). Direction of the skidding operation
was downhill, at an average skidding distance of 626 ft. A
stroke-boom delimber (PC200 Komatsu) was used for pro-
cessing trees and a log loader (PC220 Komatsu) was used for
loading logs onto the truck. The skidding and forwarding op-
erations were downhill at a slope range from 2 to 32 percent.
Hourly machine costs as measured in dollar per scheduled
machine hour ($/SMH) were estimated using standard ma-
chine rate calculation practices (Miyata 1980). New machine
prices were collected from dealers and contractors in northern
Idaho. Estimated economic life for all machines was 5 years
with 1,800 working hours per year. Salvage value was set at
20 percent of initial purchase cost, interest rate at 8 percent,
insurance at 1 percent, and taxes at 1.5 percent; operator wage
at $22.00 per hour plus 32 percent benefits. Hourly fuel con-
sumption was estimated based on machine engine size. Per-
centage utilization and maintenance and repair costs were es-
timated based on a study by Brinker and others (2002). The
resulting hourly costs for the equipment are shown in Table 2.
Hourly machine costs ($/SMH) of the CTL harvesting system
were slightly higher than those of the WT harvesting systems.
In some instances in the inland northwest, there are seasonal
shutdowns caused by the thawing of winter moisture, and a
CTL harvesting system can often begin operating earlier than
a WT harvesting system. A scenario where hourly cost of the
CTL harvesting system are based on more working hours per
year than a WT harvesting system is evaluated to see how
extension of the logging season affects overall logging cost.
Data collection and analysis
A detailed time study using stopwatch techniques was con-
ducted to collect harvesting productivity data and to establish
relationships between cycle times, load size, and stand vari-
ables. Harvester and feller-buncher operations were evaluated
based on 1,000 premarked trees (500 trees in each unit) to
determine tree size distribution data of the stand. Each marked
tree was numbered and correlated with DBH. Species was
also recorded. This way, accurate tree DBH and species data
could be collected while observing harvesting operations at a
safe distance. The numbering method was also combined with
ocular observations during harvesting operation to collect ad-
ditional data, as it was sometimes difficult to see numbers on
tree stems.
Before skidding operations on the WT harvesting units,
landing locations and major skid extraction routes were iden-
tified by the crawler operator. Distances of tree bunches to the
landing were measured with a tape and recorded on stumps,
logs, and residual trees. The marked distances on stumps,
logs, and residual trees represented travel distances to each
bunch when the crawler transported the bunch to the landing.
Distances to new bunches located farther from the initial
marked distances were estimated using a previously marked
distance as a reference point and adding a new distance mea-
sured from the marked distances to the new bunch location.
Prior to forwarder machine activity, the harvester created
forwarder trails by felling and processing every tree within
and around its path. Each forwarder trail was divided into
short distances of 50 to 100 ft. The short interval distances
were measured and recorded on stumps, logs, and residual
trees. These numbers were observed and distances between
those marked were estimated at some safe distance from ac-
tive forwarding operations. The tree size and number of logs
manufactured in each processor cycle were collected by

ocular estimation of DBH and count of logs produced per tree.
The number of pieces per loader cycle was also collected by
ocular count of logs during loading onto the truck.
Time study data collected from the field were examined for
normality and outliers and were used to develop predictive
equations by running an ordinary least squares regression pro-
cedure in SAS software (SAS Institute 1999). Independent
variables such as DBH, travel distance, and number of trees/
logs, were related to each cycle time.
Harvesting productivities were determined using produc-
tivity equations developed for cycle time and production in
volume of recovered sawlogs (large-end diameter > 8 in), ton-
wood (a log of large-end diameter < 8 in and top minimum
diameter of 4 in), and pulpwood (any dead dry log, decayed
log, or log below specified mill lengths). Average piece vol-
ume of sawlog, pulpwood, and ton-wood were estimated from
log weight data collected at the mills. Each truckload volume
was converted to green cubic foot (ft3) and board feet (BF) log
volume using the conversion factors of 58.5 pcf, and 4.75 BF/
ft3 (Gregg 2002) for mixed conifer species (Spelter 2002).
Results and discussion
Harvesting productivity
The results from the two sites consistently showed higher
productivity for the WT harvesting machines than for the CTL
harvesting machines (Table 3); these results are also consis-
tent with those observed in other studies (Andersson 1994,
David et al. 2005, Yaoxiang et al. 2006). Higher productivity
of WT harvesting was partly a result of having a designated
task for each machine. For example, the productivity differ-
ence between the CTL harvester and the combined WT feller-
buncher and processor was high at the Princeton site. How-
ever, it was minimal at the Deary site because of low produc-
tivity of the feller-buncher equipped with a bar-saw.
Tree size generally affects productivity of harvesting ma-
chines (Kellogg and Spong 2004). Time study data for the
feller-bunchers and harvesters were used to generate relation-
ships between tree size (DBH) and hourly production (Fig. 2).
Harvesting productivity increased with increasing tree
DBH. Productivity of the feller-bunchers increased nonlin-
early more than the harvester. This outcome is consistent with
the outcome of a previous study where the productivity of a
feller-buncher was found to be four times more than that of
harvester (Yaoxiang et al. 2006).
The continuous disc-saw feller-buncher used at the Prince-
ton site was more productive than the bar-saw feller-buncher
used at the Deary site. Delay-free cycle time for the continu-
ous disc-saw feller-buncher was short (about 40 and 62 per-
cent less than the average delay-free cycle times for the bar-
saw feller-buncher and harvester, respectively) with corre-
spondingly higher productivity due to saw type along with
machine design elements that allows for high-speed rotation
of the saw. From personal communication with feller-buncher
operators and machine dealers, the continuous disc-saw
feller-bunchers are more productive than bar-saw feller-
bunchers in handling tree sizes less than 22 in. However, bar-
saw feller-bunchers are still used for forest operations because
of their relatively low investment and maintenance costs and
their ability to fell a greater range of tree diameters.
Delay summary
Table 4 shows observed delays for the harvester, for-
warder, feller-buncher, crawler, and processor. With the CTL
harvesting machines, operational delays (e.g., brushing, tree
hang-ups, decking, waiting for the log truck, and sorting) ac-
counted for more than 53 percent and 73 percent of total har-
vester and forwarder delay times respectively at the Princeton
and Deary sites. Observed mechanical delays (engine break-
down, chain problem, and engine heating-up) for the har-
vester and forwarder were minimal. Frequent operational de-
lays and minimal mechanical delays observed for the CTL
harvesting machines in this study is similar to observations in
a previous study (Kellogg and Spong 2004). Operational de-
lays (removing slash at landing, pushing tree bunches, and
waiting) represented the largest delay category for the WT
harvesting processor and crawler at both sites. Mechanical de-
lays such as chain problems constituted a greater percentage
of processor and bar-saw feller-buncher total delay time,
while the continuous disc-saw feller-buncher had some un-
usual stops when handling large trees (DBH > 22 in). The
occasional breakdown was due to operator error in not allow-
ing the rotation speed of the continuous disc-saw to attain its
peak before felling large trees.
Generally, administrative delays (talking with harvesting
supervisor and machine operators), and personal delays (eat-
ing, drinking, etc) constituted a small proportion (< 12.6%) of
total delay time, while operational delays constituted the high-
est proportion of the total delay time. Frequency and total du-
ration of mechanical delays tended to be low, but the average
times involved in mechanical delays were higher than for
other types of delays once they occurred. Mechanical delays
observed in the CTL and WT harvesting machines could be
attributed to machine age. Except for the continuous disc-saw
feller-buncher used at the Princeton site, the ages of the CTL
and WT harvesting machines used in this harvesting operation
were beyond what is normally considered the economic life
span (5 yr) of harvesting machines (Brinker et al. 2002).
Percent utilization was estimated based on operational de-
lay times as percentage of total cycle times in both sites. Uti-
lization percentages for the harvester were 65 percent and 51
percent, for the forwarder were 97 percent and 94 percent, for
the crawler were 83 percent and 58 percent, and for the pro-
cessor were 59 percent and 55 percent at the Princeton and

Deary sites respectively. The utilization percentage for the
continuous disc-saw feller-buncher was 43 percent and for the
bar-saw feller-buncher, 52 percent. Nonproductive time due
to delays can have a significant impact on productivity
(LeDoux and Huyler 2001). During the harvesting operation,
the observed delays (ranging from 4% to 67%) affected ma-
chine productivity. Figure 3 shows 10, 25, and 35 percent
reduction in productivity for the CTL and WT harvesting ma-
chines with a decreasing utilization percentage from 100 to 65
percent.
Harvesting cost
The stump-to-truck cost for CTL
harvesting was $0.34/ft3 and $0.36/
ft3, while the WT harvesting cost
was $0.22/ft3 and $0.33/ft3 at the
Princeton and Deary sites, respec-
tively (Table 5). CTL harvesting
cost was more expensive than the
WT harvesting at the Princeton and
Deary sites. These differences were
primarily due to differences in the
forwarder and crawler machine
costs and productivity in the trans-
portation of trees or logs from the
stump area to the landing area.
Primary transportation cost of
trees or logs from the stump area to
the landing by the forwarder and
crawler accounted for the greatest
proportion (36% to 54%) of the total
harvesting cost of the CTL and WT
harvesting at both study sites.
The cost of operating a crawler is
less than the cost of operating a for-
warder because the purchase price
and all associated ownership costs of
a crawler were about 24 percent less
than those costs for a forwarder.
Hourly production rates for the
crawler were also higher than those
for the forwarder. On the average,
the crawler produced 2,060 ft3/PMH
(28% more than the forwarder pro-
ductivity) at the Princeton site and
1,350 ft3/PMH (14% more than for-
warder productivity) at the Deary site. However, the impact of
increases in skidding distance on crawler productivity was
much more significant than the impact of increases in distance
on forwarder productivity. At the Deary site, forwarding cost
increased by 21 percent because of long forwarding distances,
while the crawler harvesting cost increased by 33 percent.
This result agrees with other research findings that an increase
in average extraction distance beyond 328 ft will increase the
cost of WT harvesting more than CTL harvesting (Andersson
1994).
The higher percentage difference (33.3%) in the cost of
CTL over WT harvesting at the Princeton site can be ex-
plained by differences in machine types used in each system
and their harvesting productivities. At both the Princeton and
Deary sites, the same forwarder and harvester models were
used, resulting in a minimum variation in CTL harvesting ma-
chine productivity between the two sites. In contrast, WT har-
vesting machines used at the Princeton site were more pro-
ductive than the combination of WT machines used at the
Deary site. For example the bar-saw feller-buncher used at the
Deary site was less productive than the continuous disc-saw
feller-buncher used at the Princeton site.
The method of loading logs also influenced the operating
cost of both harvesting systems. Because of the higher pro-
ductivity of the forwarder, the cost of loading CTL harvested
logs using the forwarder machine was 20 percent less than the
cost of the WT harvesting loader at the Deary site.

Productivity equations
The productivity equations developed for all harvesting
machines contain estimators that have significant F-values (p
< 0.05), except for the feller-buncher and loader used at the
Princeton and Deary sites (Table 6). The significant F-value
for each estimator indicates that the average cycle time equa-
tion for each machine can be effectively used to estimate har-
vesting productivity. Productivity equations for the crawler
and forwarder had high values of the training r2, developed
from 70 percent of the observed data, compared to productiv-
ity equations of felling and processing machines. The training
r2 value is a measure of goodness-of-fit (i.e., how well the
estimated regression line fits observed delay-free cycle time).
For example, the forwarder equation (r2 = 0.83) at the Deary
site indicates that the independent variables (distance and
number of logs) explains 83 percent of variation in delay-free
cycle time and that the equation includes variables that are
most influential in the forwarding operation. All productivity
equations were similar to the range of r2 values of previously
developed productivity equations (Kellogg and Spong 2004,
Yaoxiang et al. 2006).
The combined equations for the forwarder and crawler also
showed a significant F-value (p < 0.05) indicating that the
direction of forwarding or skidding operation with respect to
slope can either increase or decrease delay-free cycle time of
machines. The dummy variable (DIRECT) increased the de-
lay-freecycletimeoftheforwarderby3minutes,48secondsand
the crawler by 0.11 seconds for uphill harvesting operations.
The significant F-value and r2 values are good indicators of
the effectiveness of predictive equations. However, they do
not necessarily indicate the best equation for prediction of the
dependent variable (Kozak and Kozak 2003). In view of this,

further analysis (validation) was performed on the productiv-
ity equations to ascertain their adequacy. To validate the pro-
ductivity equations, all developed productivity equations
were used to predict the reserved data (30% of observed data
not used for developing the productivity equations).
The outcomes of the prediction (i.e., predicted average
cycle times) were correlated with the observed cycle times to
produce another r2 (validated r2). In addition, a two-sample
t-test ( = 0.05) was used to test the differences between the
predicted and observed average cycle time. The differences
between the observed and predicted cycle time were signifi-
cant (p < 0.05) for all equations except for forwarder and
crawler equations developed at the Deary site, the combined
forwarder equation, and the processor equation at the Prince-
ton site. These outcomes suggest that productivity equations
developed for the forwarder, crawler, and processor are good
predictors of harvesting productivity and thus can be used to
predict harvesting productivity in stands with similar charac-
teristics, while the productivity equations developed for other
machines are likely to produce estimates of delay-free cycle
time that are less satisfactory.
Standardized comparison
between CTL and WT harvesting
A standardized comparison was performed to evaluate har-
vesting cost differences between CTL and WT harvesting un-
der equal site and stand conditions using the productivity
equations developed from time study and stand data on both
sites. The productivity equations developed for the crawler
skidder and forwarder at the Deary site were used because the
site involved downhill skidding/forwarding, which is typical
of most ground-based harvesting operations. Values of the
variables used for the standardized comparison (see Table 7)
were 11 in for DBH, 18.6 ft3 for log volume, and a range of
values between 400 ft and 1150 ft, calculated at a 50-ft
interval.
In the standardized comparison, a less productive CTL har-
vesting (Lc) was compared to less (Lw) and highly (Hw) pro-
ductive WT harvesting, and a highly productive CTL harvest-
ing (Hc) was compared to highly productive WT harvesting
(Hw). CTL harvesting was defined as less productive if a
separate loader was used in addition to the harvester and for-
warder. It was defined highly productive if the forwarder was
used for loading logs onto the truck. WT harvesting was de-
fined less productive if a bar-saw feller-buncher was used. It
was defined as highly productive if a continuous disc-saw
feller-buncher was used.
The CTL harvesting costs were significantly (p < 0.05)
higher than the cost of WT harvesting in the scenario “LcHw”
(less-productive CTL harvesting vs. highly productive WT
harvesting. For the “HcHw” scenario a lower percentage dif-
ference was observed by using the forwarder machine for
loading logs instead of a separate loader in the CTL harvesting
operations (Table 7).
The effect of feller-buncher type is illustrated in the
“LcLw” case. Below a 650-ft extraction distance, the outcome
resulted in no harvesting cost differences between the two
harvesting systems. Beyond 1,000 ft, WT harvesting becomes
more expensive than CTL harvesting. These assumptions rep-
resent conditions with the greatest observed differences be-
tween the CTL and WT harvesting costs due to variations in
extraction distance and machine combinations.
The highly productive CTL and WT harvesting scenario
(HcHw) (Fig. 4) shows the pattern of cost differences between
CTL and WT harvesting at increasing extraction distances.
Generally, the percentage by which CTL harvesting cost ex-
ceeds WT harvesting cost is reduced (< 6%) with increasing
extraction distance. The cost differences between CTL and
WT harvesting from this analysis can be described as a cost-
difference-circle; below 750 ft, the first half of the cycle be-
gins with CTL harvesting cost increasing at a much higher
rate than WT harvesting cost. The reverse is observed beyond
750 ft (second half of circle) where WT harvesting cost in-
creases at a much higher rate than CTL harvesting cost due to
increased extraction distances.
Another standardized comparison was also performed to
assess a scenario where CTL harvesting systems have more
working hours per year than WT harvesting systems. For this
analysis, 1,800 hours per year (10 hours per day, 20 days per
month, and 9 months per year) and 1,600 hours per year (10
hours per day, 20 days per month, and 8 months per year) were
used for CTL and WT harvesting, respectively. Assuming an
average extraction distance of 800 ft, WT harvesting opera-
tions utilizing a continuous disc-saw feller-buncher, and as-
suming a forwarder used for loading CTL harvested logs, the
CTL harvesting cost of $0.35/ft3 was 3 percent higher than the
WT harvesting cost ($0.34/ft3). When the continuous disc-
saw feller-buncher is replaced with a bar-saw feller-buncher
in the analysis, the CTL harvesting becomes 6 percent less
expensive than WT harvesting. Assuming a separate loader or
a less productive forwarder for loading the CTL harvesting
logs, cost of CTL harvesting would be 12.8 percent higher
than WT harvesting operations when a continuous disc-saw
feller-buncher is used and 5.1 percent higher if bar-saw feller-
buncher is used.
Harvest volume and log value recovery
The harvested sawlog volume accounts for 81 percent and
67 percent of total harvest volume of CTL harvesting and 85
percent and 71 percent of the total harvest of WT harvesting at
the Princeton and Deary sites, respectively (Table 8). At both
study sites, WT harvesting recovered more sawlog but less
ton-wood volume than CTL harvesting. At the Princeton site,
no pulpwood was harvested for the timber sale because it was
not required of the logging contractors although there is a
market for pulpwood in northern Idaho. However, at the
Deary site, the contractors were asked to harvest pulpwood

chine hour (SMH)) of CTL and WT harvesting machines at 65,

and WT harvesting recovered more pulpwood volume than
did CTL harvesting. The higher sawlog and pulpwood volume
recovered by WT harvesting may be due to differences in
manufactured log lengths. WT harvesting recovered the maxi-
mum possible log volume by manufacturing diverse log
lengths. Observed lengths of logs manufactured by CTL har-
vesting during the study were 16.3 ft and 18.3 ft, while WT
harvesting manufactured lengths of 15.5, 16.3, 18.3, 24.3, and

33.3 ft. The variations in lengths translated into higher aver-
age log volume in favor of WT harvesting. This scenario
might have resulted in differences in sawlog volume between
CTL and WT harvesting. A similar outcome was observed in
a comparison study between the two harvesting systems
where differences in merchantable and unmerchantable
volumes were suggested as reasons for the differences in
harvested volume of the two harvesting systems (Favreau
1997).
Total values received for the products are shown in Table 9.
When all product values are considered, the WT harvesting
system generated slightly higher returns from the products at
both study sites.
Conclusion
Harvesting productivity and cost of CTL and WT harvest-
ing systems are affected by stand and harvesting variables.
The percentage by which CTL harvesting costs exceeded WT
harvesting costs ranged from 8.3 to 33.3 percent, depending
on average extraction distance, individual machine productiv-
ity, and machine combinations. Primary transportation cost
(stump-to-landing) was the main reason for cost differences
between CTL and WT harvesting. Primary transportation
costs accounted for 36 to 37 percent and 42 to 49 percent of
the total WT and CTL harvesting cost, respectively, and these
costs were very sensitive to extraction distances.
Machine combinations influenced harvesting cost of CTL
and WT harvesting. The effect of replacing a less productive
bar-saw feller-buncher with a continuous disc-saw feller-
buncher was significant on harvesting costs of the WT system,
resulting in higher cost differences between the two harvest-
ing systems. In general, all the WT harvesting machines were
more productive than the CTL harvesting machines, suggest-
ing that the WT harvesting system completes harvesting work
faster than the CTL harvesting system because specific tasks
are assigned to each machine in the WT harvesting system.
Harvesting cost can be minimized in CTL harvesting by
adequate planning of the harvesting operation to reduce op-
erational delays such as frequent intermediate stops of the for-
warder, waiting time at landing to load logs onto trucks, and
sorting. In addition, mechanical delays can be reduced
through regular servicing of equipment and replacement of
machines when frequent mechanical delays are observed.
Similarly, adequate planning of the landing area before

harvesting operations will reduce imbalances induced by in-
teractions between WT harvesting machines.
Harvesting productivity can be effectively predicted using
stand and harvesting variables. Adequacy of each productiv-
ity equation was ascertained through validation procedure.
The outcome of the validation suggests that productivity
equations developed for the forwarder, crawler, and processor
are good predictors of harvesting productivity and thus can be
used to predict harvesting productivity in stands with similar
characteristics, while the productivity equations developed
for other machines may have limitations in predicting delay-
free average cycle time.
WT harvesting recovered more sawlog volume but less ton-
wood volume than CTL harvesting because of variations in
manufactured log lengths. As a result of the higher proportion
of sawlog volume in the total harvest volume, the net revenue
from WT harvesting was higher than for CTL harvesting.
Our study indicated that WT harvesting was more cost-
effective system than CTL harvesting but that differences be-
tween these systems are highly sensitive to machine produc-
tivity and stand variables. In view of this, further research is
necessary to explore the effect of other variables not consid-
ered in this study such as the effect of other machine combi-
nations (e.g., grapple skidder) and silvicultural prescriptions
(e.g., single tree selection) on cost, productivity, and log value
recovery of CTL and WT harvesting.

aThousand board feet (MBF) based on scale data collected from mills in Idaho. At the Deary site, each truck-
load volume was converted to green cubic foot (ft3) and board feet (BF) log volume using the conversion
factors (58.5 pcf and 4.75 BF/ft3 (Gregg 2002) for mixed conifer species) (Spelter 2002).
