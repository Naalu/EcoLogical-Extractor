Summary
 
1.
 
Ecological restoration often involves returning ecosystem structure to some predisturbance
reference state, but ecosystem function must also recover if restoration efforts are to be self-sustaining
over the long term. In the south-western United States, ponderosa pine forest structure was altered
by disruption of the ﬁre regime following Euro-American settlement. Forest structure is now being
restored to presettlement conditions through the application of thinning and burning treatments.
However, the effects of these treatments on below-ground ecosystem processes remain unclear.

We conducted a water and nitrogen (N) addition experiment in adjacent restored and unrestored
ponderosa pine stands and compared soil CO

 efﬂux in response to these treatments over a 13-month
period. Our goals were to (i) quantify water and N limitation to below-ground carbon (C) cycling
in contemporary high-density ponderosa pine forests; and (ii) determine if restoration alleviates
water and N limitations.

Restoration thinning and burning increased soil CO

 efﬂux, along with surface soil water
content, temperature and herbaceous ﬁne root biomass, while total ﬁne root biomass decreased as
a result of restoration.

Water and N additions increased C ﬂux from soils to a similar degree in both restored and
unrestored ponderosa pine stands, but the increase was relatively small when compared to that
stimulated by restoration.

Synthesis and applications.
 
 An understanding of how ecosystem processes respond to treatments
designed to restore ecosystem structure is critical in ensuring the long-term success of restoration
efforts. Here we show that, although water and N stimulate C ﬂux from soils in these semi-arid
forests, restoration treatments have a much greater effect on soil C balance than increased water and
N availability by themselves. This suggests that increased quality of C inputs from a recovering
understorey herbaceous community is a key component of restoring ecosystem function (e.g.
below-ground C cycling) in south-western ponderosa pine forests.

Introduction
 
Prior to Euro-American settlement (
 
c
 
. 1880), ponderosa pine
 
Pinus ponderosa
 
 var. 
 
scopularum
 
 Englem. forests of the south-
western United States were characterized by frequent (2–20
years), low-intensity surface ﬁres which maintained large,
grass-dominated openings between mature trees (Cooper
1960; Dieterich 1980). Tree density in these presettlement
stands ranged from ~30 to 140 trees ha
 
–1
 
, with herbaceous
plants making up as much as 80% of the total canopy cover
(Covington & Sackett 1992; Covington 
 
et al
 
. 1994). Following
settlement by Euro-Americans, ﬁre suppression and livestock
grazing combined with an unusually wet and warm climate
in the early 1900s led to increased pine regeneration and a
subsequent dramatic increase in tree density (White 1985;
Savage, Brown & Feddema 1996). Contemporary south-
western ponderosa pine forests average 727 trees ha
 
–1
 
 but can
reach maximum densities > 2000 trees ha

1997; O’Brian 2002). This change in forest structure has led to
increased forest ﬂoor (O horizon) depth, decreased herbaceous
plant production, increased susceptibility to insect outbreaks
and a shift in the ﬁre regime to one that is more infrequent and
stand-replacing (Covington & Moore 1994; Covington 
 
et al
 
.
1994, 1997). Anthropogenic alteration of forest structure
has also affected ecosystem function by sequestering large
amounts of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in slowly decomposing
pine litter, thereby reducing rates of below-ground C and N
cycling (Klemmedson, Meier & Campbell 1985; Kaye & Hart
1998a,b; Hart 
 
et al
 
. 2006).
Ecological restoration treatments, including thinning
and prescribed burning, are currently being implemented to
remove tree biomass, reduce the risk of stand-replacing ﬁres
and increase understorey herbaceous productivity (Kaufmann
 
et al
 
. 1994; Covington 
 
et al
 
. 1997). The reduction in leaf area
that accompanies restoration reduces water loss through
evapotranspiration, thus increasing soil water availability
(Kaye 
 
et al
 
. 1999; Simonin 
 
et al
 
. 2006). In addition, soil N
transformation rates and the combined respiration of below-
ground autotrophic and heterotrophic components (soil CO
 
2
 
efﬂux) were higher in thinned and burned ponderosa pine
stands compared to untreated stands 2 years after treatments
were applied (Kaye & Hart 1998a,b). These studies suggest
that restoration thinning and burning treatments in south-
western ponderosa pine forests increase soil water and N
availability, leading to increased below-ground biological
activity as indicated by higher soil CO
 
2
 
 efﬂux rates. Despite
this evidence, the degree to which restoration thinning and
burning alleviates water and N limitations to below-ground
biological activity remains unclear. There are few studies of
below-ground responses to thinning and burning treatments
in semi-arid south-western forests, and no experiments that
have manipulated water and N availability to test whether
these factors indeed limit soil respiration.
We conducted a water and N addition experiment in adjacent
restored and unrestored 16-ha ponderosa pine stands in
northern Arizona, United States. Our objectives were to
quantify water and N limitation to below-ground C cycling in
contemporary high-density south-western ponderosa pine
forests and the degree to which restoration treatments relieve
these water and N limitations. We hypothesized that (i)
increased water and N availability, soil surface temperatures
and a large pulse of dead ﬁne root material following restora-
tion should lead to higher soil CO
 
2
 
 efﬂux rates in the restored
stand compared to the unrestored stand; and (ii) water and N
additions would lead to increased soil CO
 
2
 
 efﬂux rates in the
unrestored stand but not in the restored stand, because
enhanced water and N availability following restoration would
ameliorate the response of soil respiration to added water and N.

DESIGN
 
This experiment was conducted within the Fort Valley Experimental
Forest 15 km north-west of Flagstaff, Arizona as part of the Grand
Canyon Forest Partnership’s Flagstaff Urban–Wildland Interface
(FUWI) project. The study area is approximately 2250 m in elevation
with a gentle topography and a cool, subhumid climate. Mean
annual precipitation is 577 mm, half of which occurs as winter snow
and the other half as late summer rain. The basalt-derived soils are
classified as a complex of fine, smectitic, frigid, Typic Argiborolls
and Mollic Eutroboralfs, according to USDA soil taxonomy (Miller
 
et al
 
. 1995).
We compared two adjacent 16 ha stands: an untreated stand with
high bole density (709 trees ha
 
–1
 
, basal area = 40·1 m
 
2
 
 ha
 
–1
 
) and intact
forest floor, and a treated stand that had been thinned in September
1999, reducing bole density from 800 to 91 trees ha
 
–1
 
 (basal area
reduced from 39·7 to 8·5 m
 
2
 
 ha
 
–1
 
). Slash from the harvesting operation
within the treated stand was grouped into piles and burned in
February of 2000. The entire treated stand was broadcast-burned in
April of 2000. Experimental thinning and burning treatments were
conducted in cooperation with the Coconino National Forest and
USDA Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station. The major
goals of these treatments were to develop operational methods for
reducing wildfire hazard in the wildland–urban interface around
Flagstaff and to re-establish ecosystem structure and function to
presumed conditions in these forests prior to Euro–American
settlement in the late 1880s (Covington 
 
et al
 
. 1997; Fulé 
 
et al
 
. 2001).
Within each of the two stands, a 60 
 
×
 
 60-m grid was established
with 20 grid points serving as permanent plot centres for long-term
understorey and overstorey vegetation monitoring. At the even-
numbered plot centres within each stand (
 
n
 
 = 10 per stand), we
inserted three place-holding rings (27·5-cm diameter polyvinylchloride)
1 cm into the ground to mark subplot locations, forming a triad
with 1-m spacing between subplots. Each subplot at each plot centre
was assigned randomly to one of three treatments: unamended (U),
water amended (W) and water plus nitrogen amended (W + N).
Water amendment was intended to alleviate water limitation by
simulating a doubling of mean annual precipitation, currently
577 mm year
 
–1
 
. Nitrogen was added in the form of ammonium
nitrate (NH
 
4
 
NO
 
3
 
) at a rate of 45 g N m
 
–2
 
 year
 
–1
 
, an amount shown
to maximize fertilization benefits in forest plantation management
(Lamontagne & Schiff 2000), and was dissolved in the same volume
of water added to the W treatment subplots (3·41 L per subplot per
measurement period). The W + N amendment was intended to
alleviate both water and N limitation at the same time.
Water and N amendments began on 10 July 2000 and continued
every 2 weeks until 6 November 2000. A total of nine additions were
made over this period, with each W ring receiving 30·69 L of H
 
2
 
O
(519 mm) and each W + N ring receiving the same volume of H
 
2
 
O
as well as 2·39 g of N (42·35 g N m
 
–2
 
). No water or N was added over
the winter measurement period (November 2000–April 2001) because
we assumed that both tree growth and microbial activity were limited
by low temperatures and not water or N availability. Water and N
amendments for the 2001 growing season began on 14 May and
continued every 2 weeks until 30 July 2001. A total of six amendments
were made over this period, with each W ring receiving 20·46 L of
H
 
2
 
O (346 mm) and each W + N ring receiving the same volume of
H
 
2
 
O plus 1·6 g of N (28·24 g N m
 
–2
 
). Over the entire 13 month
measurement period, each W ring received a total of 1384 mm of
added water and each W + N ring received the same amount of
water plus 70·59 g m
 
2
 
 of added N. Precipitation data from a nearby
weather station indicate that we added > 2·5 times the amount of
water that fell as precipitation during this period (514 mm; http://
www.rmrs.nau.edu/weather/stations/), and we added ~350 times
more N than is typical for this area from atmospheric deposition,

MEASUREMENTS
 
We measured net soil CO
 
2
 
 efflux over a 13-month period within
each treatment subplot in both the restored and unrestored stands
using the soda lime static chamber technique (Edwards 1982;
Grogan 1998; Kaye & Hart 1998b), which uses a mixture of NaOH
and CaO or Ca(OH)
 
2
 
 (granular 1·68–3·36 mm, 6–12 mesh) to absorb
CO
 
2
 
 evolved from the soil surface and trapped inside the chamber.
This method provides a simple, inexpensive means to obtain multiple,
nearly simultaneous 24-h integrated measurements (Hutchinson &
Rochette 2003). In an earlier experiment comparing unthinned and
restored ponderosa pine stands, measurements of soil respiration
using the soda lime static chamber technique were well correlated with
those from dynamic chamber infrared gas analyser (IRGA) measure-
ments (Kaye & Hart 1998b). We used chambers with a relatively
large surface area (~595 cm
 
2
 
) compared to those of the typical IRGA
dynamic chamber (~81 cm
 
2
 
), thus lowering the coefficient of variation
among samples and increasing the precision of plot-level estimates
of soil CO
 
2
 
 efflux (Davidson 
 
et al
 
. 2002; Ryan & Law 2005).
Measurements were made every 2 weeks during the growing
season (July–December 2000 and May–August 2001) and once a
month over the winter period (January–April 2001). Measurements
during the growing season of both 2000 and 2001 were made 2 days
after water and N additions to avoid any immediate pulse effects.
Water additions of a similar volume to a nearby ponderosa pine
forest revealed a nearly 10-fold increase in soil CO
 
2
 
 efflux within
30 min of water addition and a decline over the next 24 h (J.R.
Brown, Northern Arizona University, unpublished data). Soda lime
(60-g oven-dried weight) was placed in 8-cm diameter polypropylene
containers and oven-dried at 105 
 
°
 
C for 24 h. After cooling in a
desiccator, containers were weighed to within 0·001 g, transported
to the field, opened, and placed under an opaque white chamber
(27·5-cm diameter 
 
×
 
 20 cm tall). After 24 h, the containers were
removed, sealed and returned to the laboratory for drying, cooling
and weighing. Six blanks were included per stand to account for
CO
 
2
 
 gain during handling; blanks were treated the same as the
samples except that blanks were placed under chambers for only
30 s. Soil CO
 
2
 
 efflux from each individual chamber over the 24-h
measurement period was calculated as net sample weight gain minus
mean net blank weight gain multiplied by a correction factor of 1·69,
which accounts for the mass of water released when soda lime reacts
with CO
 
2
 
 (Grogan 1998). All 24-h measurements of soil CO
 
2
 
 efflux at
all subplots in both stands were begun between 10 a.m. and 12 p.m.
Annual estimates of C flux from soils were calculated using each
measurement as a midpoint between sequential measurement dates.
Half the non-measurement days between sequential measurements
were assigned to each measurement date. The soil CO
 
2
 
 efflux value
from each measurement was then multiplied by the number of non-
measurement days assigned to that measurement date, and these
values were summed to produce an annual estimate of soil CO
 
2
 
efflux (Kaye & Hart 1998b; Hart 
 
et al
 
. 2006).

MEASUREMENTS
 
At the end of the 13-month experiment, in August 2001, we used a
4·8-cm diameter core to take one mineral soil sample from the middle
of each subplot to a depth of 15 cm for root analyses. Fine roots are
not found in the forest floor of these semi-arid forests (Hart, Classen &
Wright 2005). Roots were removed by sieving (< 4 mm) and hand-
picking and separated into three categories based on visual criteria: live
ponderosa pine roots, dead ponderosa pine roots and live herbaceous
roots (all herbaceous roots appeared live). Following removal from the
soil, roots were dried at 60 
 
°
 
C and weighed to the nearest 0·001 g.
In each stand, soil temperature and soil volumetric water content
were measured within each ring at the beginning of the CO
 
2
 
 measure-
ment period to assess the influence of microenvironmental factors on
soil CO
 
2
 
 efflux, to characterize the abiotic conditions within each stand
and to determine the influence of water and N amendments on the soil
environment. Soil temperature was measured using digital probe
thermometers (VWR, West Chester, PA, USA) at a depth of 7·5 cm
below the ground surface (measured from the top of the O horizon),
and soil volumetric water content was measured using a Trase Systems
Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) unit (Soilmoisture Corp., Santa
Barbara, CA, USA). TDR probes were installed permanently inside
each ring at depth of 15 cm measured from the top of the O horizon.
Surface mineral soil samples (0–15 cm) were collected from outside
the rings in both stands (
 
n
 
 = 10 per stand) once a month throughout
the 13-month measurement period as part of a separate experiment
to assess restoration effects on soil net N transformations (Hart
 
et al
 
. 2006). Soil samples were composited across time-periods and
analysed for total C, total N and pH. Surface soil total organic C
and N concentrations were measured in each stand using a Flash EA
1112 C and N Analyser (ThermoElectron Corp., Waltham, MA,
USA). Surface soil pH was determined for each stand in a 1 : 2
suspension of air-dried mineral soil to 0·01 
 
m
 
 CaCl
 
2
 
 solution using
an Orion 720 A pH meter (Allometrics, Inc., Baton Rouge, LA, USA).
 
STATISTICAL
 
 
 
ANALYSES
 
We used two-factor, repeated measures multivariate analysis
of variance (
 
manova
 
) with restoration treatment (restored vs.
unrestored) and amendment (U, W and W + N) as main effects to
test for differences in soil CO
 
2
 
 efflux, soil volumetric water and
surface soil temperature. We used a multivariate test because the
assumption of independent observations was not met (Kuehl 2000),
i.e. pairs of repeated measures on the same subplots tended to be cor-
related [Mauchly’s W < 0·001, 
 
χ
 
2 
 
= 458·15, 
 
P
 
 (
 
χ
 
2
 
 > 458·15) < 0·001].
Where there were no treatment by amendment interactions, we used
 
post-hoc
 
 contrasts to differentiate the effects of W vs. W + N
amendments. Two-factor 
 
anova
 
 was used to test for differences in
estimated annual soil CO
 
2
 
 efflux and fine root biomass among
treatment and amendment types. Where main effects were significant
(
 
P < 
 
0·05) and interactions were not, we used Tukey’s honestly
significant difference (HSD) as a mean separation test. Statistical
analyses were performed using the 
 
sas jmp in 
 
version 5·1 software
package (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA); 
 
α
 
 = 0·05 for all tests.
Because we sacrificed true replication of restoration treatments
in favour of implementing those treatments on realistically large
scales, our study design is not replicated at the stand level. Thus, our
use of inferential statistics to assess the main effects of restoration
thinning and burning on soil CO
 
2
 
 efflux, soil moisture, soil temper-
ature and fine root biomass constitutes pseudoreplication. However,
the two stands compared here are directly adjacent to each other
with the same soil type, slope (~7%) and aspect (south-east). Both
stands had nearly identical tree density and basal area before thin-
ning and burning treatments were applied, and both have similar
soil characteristics, even after treatments were applied (Table 1).
In addition, our results are consistent with previous research using
replicated designs to investigate the effects of restoration alone
(e.g. Kaye & Hart 1998b). We suggest these factors provide strong
support for our use of this unreplicated system as a means to test the
potentially interactive effects of restoration treatments and water
and N amendments.

Results
 
Both restoration treatment (thinning and burning) and
amendment (W and W + N) had signiﬁcant effects on soil
CO
 
2
 
 efﬂux (Table 2). CO
 
2
 
 efﬂux also varied strongly over time
(Table 2). The signiﬁcant interactions between time and
restoration treatment as well as between time and amendment
indicate seasonal ﬂuctuations in the magnitude of CO
 
2
 
 efﬂux
responses to both restoration and water and N amendments
(Fig. 1a; Table 2). In both restored and unrestored stands,
watered subplots had signiﬁcantly higher CO
 
2
 
 efﬂux than
unamended subplots (
 
F = 
 
3·56, 
 
P
 
 = 0·0003; Fig. 1a), and
W + N amended subplots had higher CO
 
2
 
 efﬂux than W
subplots (
 
F = 
 
2·55, 
 
P
 
 = 0·008; Fig. 1a).
Surface soil in the restored stand was signiﬁcantly warmer
and wetter than in the unrestored stand over the 13-month
measurement period (Fig. 1b,c; Table 2). W and W + N
amended subplots were signiﬁcantly wetter than unamended
subplots in both restored and unrestored stands, although the
magnitude of this effect varied with time (Fig. 1; Table 2).
There was no difference in soil moisture between W and
W + N amended subplots (
 
F = 
 
1·01, 
 
P
 
 = 0·426), and amend-
ments with W and W + N had no effect on soil temperature
(Table 2). Signiﬁcant time

for both soil volumetric water and soil temperature indicate

Restoration thinning and burning increased annual C

annual C ﬂux signiﬁcantly from soils in both the restored and

of a signiﬁcant interaction between restoration treatment
and amendment (F = 0·113, P = 0·89) indicates that W and

W + N amendments had similar effects on annual C ﬂux
from soils in both the restored and unrestored stands. Water
addition increased annual C ﬂux from soils by 89 g m2 year–1
in the unrestored stand and 75 g m2 year–1 in the restored
stand, while W + N amendments increased annual C ﬂux from
soils by 144 g m2 year–1 in the unrestored stand, and 156 g m2
year–1 in the restored stand (Fig. 2).
Restoration thinning and burning signiﬁcantly reduced
total live ﬁne root biomass (ponderosa pine + herbaceous) by
an average of 31 g m2 (F = 6·49, P = 0·014; Fig. 3), but there
were no effects of W or W + N amendments on total live ﬁne
root biomass (F = 2·09, P = 0·134; Fig. 3), nor was there a
signiﬁcant restoration by amendment interaction (F = 1·22,
P = 0·303). There was no difference in dead ponderosa pine
ﬁne root biomass between the restored and unrestored stands
(F = 1·96, P = 0·167). Restoration shifted the proportion of
live ﬁne root biomass, from predominantly ponderosa pine
(~75% of total ﬁne root biomass) in the unrestored stand to
a majority of herbaceous ﬁne root biomass (58% of total) in
the restored stand (Fig. 3). Despite the overall reduction in
ﬁne root biomass, the restored stand had a nearly twofold
increase in herbaceous ﬁne root biomass (F = 5·27, P = 0·026)
when compared to the unrestored stand (Fig. 3).
Discussion
Soil CO2 efﬂux represents the major pathway of C loss from
terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere (Ryan & Law 2005),
accounting for ~70% of total ecosystem respiration in
temperate forests (Law, Ryan & Anthoni 1999; Janssens et al.
2001). As such, CO2 ﬂux from soils plays a critical role in
determining the C balance of forest ecosystems, and is an
important indicator of ecosystem response to both natural

Restoration reduced signiﬁcantly total live ﬁne root biomass
(P = 0·014), but amendment had no effect (P = 0·134) and there was
no signiﬁcant restoration by amendment interaction (P = 0·303).

Fig. 2. Estimated annual carbon (C) ﬂux from soils in unamended,
water amended, and water + nitrogen amended subplots of adjacent
unrestored and restored ponderosa pine stands, northern Arizona,
USA. Data are means (bars) ± 1 standard deviation (vertical lines),
n = 10. Both restoration and amendment increased signiﬁcantly
annual C ﬂux from soils (P < 0·001 for both factors), but there was no
signiﬁcant restoration by amendment interaction (P = 0·89).

and anthropogenic disturbances (Litton et al. 2003). Soil CO2
efﬂux has been shown to increase in response to thinning and
burning treatments across a broad range of forest ecosystems
(Gordon et al. 1987; Kaye & Hart 1998a; Concilio et al. 2005),
but the precise mechanisms driving this increase remain
unclear. Although soil CO2 efﬂux is the combined respiration
of autotrophic and heterotrophic below-ground components,
we suggest that increased CO2 ﬂux from soil in the restored
stand is largely a heterotrophic response, because restoration
thinning and burning treatments reduced both tree above-
ground productivity (Hart et al. 2006) and standing live ﬁne
root biomass.
Consistent with our ﬁrst hypothesis, we found that restora-
tion thinning and burning led to higher soil CO2 efﬂux rates as
well as increased surface soil water content (Fig. 1b), temper-
ature (Fig. 1c) and N availability (Hungate et al. 2007). These
results suggest that enhanced water and N availability follow-
ing restoration may be largely responsible for higher rates
of soil CO2 efﬂux. If so, we would expect a strong, positive
response of soil CO2 efﬂux to added water and N in the
unrestored stand, but little to no response in the restored
stand, because water and N limitations have already been
alleviated by thinning and burning treatments. Contrary to
this second hypothesis, water and N amendments increased
soil CO2 efﬂux to a similar degree in both stands, and their
combined effect on C ﬂux from soils was much smaller than
that stimulated by restoration thinning and burning. This
response suggests that restoration alleviated limitations of
other soil resources in addition to water and N. We postulate
that increased soil temperature and C availability may be
signiﬁcant factors driving higher C ﬂux from soils in response
to restoration thinning and burning.
Soil temperature accounts for much of the seasonal and
diel variation in soil CO2 efﬂux (Lloyd & Taylor 1994; Hibbard
et al. 2005). Soil temperature was higher by 1–4 °C in the
restored stand, probably because the dramatic reduction in
leaf area and forest ﬂoor depth led to increased insolation of
the mineral soil surface. However, soil respiration in both
stands was correlated poorly with temperature when soil
water content was below 0·18 m3 m–3 (Hart et al. 2006),
suggesting that temperature exerts a strong control over soil C
ﬂux in these semi-arid forest stands only during brief periods
of relatively high soil moisture.
Soil CO2 efﬂux is also related to substrate availability,
and is thus coupled tightly to plant metabolism (Ekblad &
Högberg 2001; Högberg et al. 2001; Bowling et al. 2002)
and the decomposition of recently produced organic matter
(Trumbore 2000; Giardina & Ryan 2002; Giardina et al. 2004).
Thus, it is somewhat surprising that restoration thinning and
burning, which reduced tree above-ground net primary
productivity by ~50% (Hart et al. 2006), resulted in increased
soil CO2 efﬂux. We suggest that a post-restoration pulse of
newly dead ponderosa pine ﬁne roots served as an important
C source driving higher soil CO2 efﬂux in the restored stand.
At the end of the 13-month measurement period there was no
difference in dead ponderosa pine ﬁne root biomass between
the restored and unrestored stands, suggesting that most of
the ﬁne roots killed during tree removal in the restored stand
had already decomposed.
In addition to an increase in quantity, our results indicate
a post-restoration increase in C substrate quality as well.
Recovery of understorey plant species in the restored stand
led to a nearly twofold increase in herbaceous ﬁne root biomass.
These herbaceous roots have higher N and lower lignin
concentrations than ponderosa pine roots (Hart, Classen &
Wright 2005; Hungate et al. 2007), and thus decompose
more rapidly. We suggest that the combination of increased
substrate quantity and increased substrate quality following
restoration may combine to elicit higher rates of below-ground
C cycling (Hart, Classen & Wright 2005).
Restoration of south-western ponderosa pine forests is an
attempt to reverse the impact human activities have had on
the structure and function of these forests over the past
125 years. However, land managers should also consider
whether restored ecosystems are sustainable in future environ-
ments altered by human activity through climate change
from rising CO2 concentrations and increased N deposition
(Choi 2007). Over a 13-month period, we added > 2·5 times
the amount of water that fell as precipitation, and > 350
times the mean yearly amount of atmospheric N deposition
(~2 kg ha–1 year–1). Although these additions increased soil
CO2 efﬂux in both restored and unrestored stands, the degree
of increase was relatively small when compared to that
stimulated by restoration treatments. This suggests that well
above average precipitation or N deposition years are unlikely
to elicit threshold shifts in forest C balance when combined
with stand thinning and burning treatments.
Our study examined the short-term inﬂuence of restoration
and increased water and N availability on C ﬂux from soils,
which may not reﬂect the long-term trajectory of restored
south-western ponderosa pine forests. Evidence from longer-
term studies of thinning and burning treatments indicates
that the rapid recovery of understorey herbaceous cover is
critical in determining the long-term C balance of restored
ponderosa pine forests. Kaye et al. (2005) found that, 2 years
after treatment, reduced C ﬂuxes in pine foliage and ﬁne roots
in restored ponderosa pine stands were balanced by higher
ﬂuxes in wood and herbaceous plants, resulting in similar
rates of ecosystem-level productivity between restored
and unrestored stands. However, in thinned ponderosa pine
stands with minimal understorey recovery 6–15 years after
treatment, soil C ﬂuxes were lower than in adjacent high-
density control stands because of reduced C inputs (Grady &
Hart 2006). Our results also suggest that the quantity and
quality of C inputs from understorey herbaceous plant
production could be an important factor affecting the
long-term C balance of restored ponderosa pine forests.
Given the potential increase in net CO2 ﬂux to the
atmosphere, the transition from ‘slow’ to more ‘rapid’
below-ground C cycling in restored ponderosa pine stands
warrants some concern in the design of restoration strategies.
High-density ponderosa pine forests of northern Arizona are
currently a net C sink (Potter & Klooster 1999) and our results
indicate that, if implemented on a landscape scale, restoration

thinning and burning may reduce the strength of this C sink in
the short term. However, without restoration, high-density
ponderosa pine forests are highly susceptible to stand-replacing
wildﬁres (Covington et al. 1997; Fulé et al. 2001), which can
rapidly release stored C to the atmosphere as CO2. Rapid,
disturbance-induced losses of CO2 are not considered
adequately in strength estimates of terrestrial C sinks (Breshears
& Allen 2002). Recent evidence from a nearby ponderosa
pine forest indicates that a single stand-replacing wildﬁre can
convert large areas of the landscape to a net source of CO2
for at least a decade (Dore et al. in press). When the risk of
wildﬁre induced C losses to the atmosphere is taken into
account, regional scale implementation of restoration thinning
and burning treatments may be the most reliable option for
preserving south-western ponderosa pine forests as a net C
sink over the coming decades.
