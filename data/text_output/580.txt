Monitoring an Arizona Ponderosa Pine
Restoration: Sampling Efficiency and Multivariate
Analysis of Understory Vegetation
Scott R. Abella,1,2 and W. Wallace Covington1
Abstract
As monitoring plans for the restoration of Pinus ponder-
osa forests in the southwestern United States evolve
toward examining multifactor ecosystem responses to
ecological restoration, designing efficient sampling pro-
cedures for understory vegetation will become increasingly
important. The objective of this study was to compare
understory composition and diversity among thin/burn and
control treatments in a P. ponderosa restoration, while
simultaneously examining the effects of sampling design
and multivariate analyses on which conclusions were
based. Using multi-response permutation procedures
(MRPP), we tested the null hypothesis of no difference
in understory species composition among treatments using
different data matrices (e.g., frequency and cover) for two
different sampling methods. Treatment differences were
subtle and were detected by an intensive 50, 1-m2 subplot
sampling method for all data matrices but were not
detected by a less intensive point-intercept sampling
method for any matrix. Sampling methods examined in
this study controlled results of multivariate analyses more
than the data matrices used to summarize data generated
by a sampling method. We partitioned data into plant life
form and native/exotic species categories for MRPP, and
this partitioning isolated plant groups most responsible for
treatment differences. We also examined the effects of
number of 1-m2 subplots sampled on mean-species-
richness/m2 estimates and found that estimates based
on 10 subplots and based on 50 subplots were highly
correlated (r 5 0.99). Species–area curves indicated that
the 50, 1-m2 subplot sampling method detected the
common species of sites but failed to detect the majority
of rare species. Additional sampling-design studies are
needed to develop single sampling designs that produce
multifactor data on plant composition, diversity, and
spatial patterns amenable to multivariate analyses as part
of monitoring plans of vegetation responses to ecological
restoration.
Key words: diversity, forest, ground flora, indicator species
analysis, multi-response permutation procedures, species
richness, species–area curves.
Introduction
Millions of hectares of contemporary Pinus ponderosa
(ponderosa pine) forests in the southwestern United States
exhibit higher tree densities, greater susceptibility to unnat-
ural stand-replacing wildfires, and less understory cover
than pre-settlement forests (Covington & Moore 1994b;
Covington et al. 1994). These undesirable changes were
facilitated by past overgrazing and disruptions of historic
fire regimes through the 1900s (Weaver 1951; Cooper
1960;
Covington
&
Moore
1994a).
Restoring
these
degraded forests entails thinning post-settlement origin
trees (age <120 years) and reinstating frequent, low-inten-
sity fires historically characteristic of P. ponderosa forests
(Covington et al. 1997; Allen et al. 2002). Numerous stud-
ies in P. ponderosa forests have examined relationships
between forage production and overstory characteristics,
thinning treatments, and prescribed fire (Moir 1966;
McConnell & Smith 1970; Harris & Covington 1983;
Oswald & Covington 1984; Tapia et al. 1990; Moore &
Deiter 1992). These studies have reported declines in
forage production with increasing overstory density and
increases in forage production following thinning or
burning.
With few exceptions, however, studies in P. ponderosa
forests have not examined overall understory composition
(species and relative abundance) and diversity changes
following treatments. Armour et al. (1984) applied univariate
statistics on a species-by-species basis to assess understory
responses to burning, while Griffis et al. (2001) compared
understory species richness among thin and burn treatments
but did not include compositional data. Vose and White
(1991) examined biomass responses of four species following
prescribed burning, and White et al. (1991) studied the
responses of four grass species to fire.
Clearly, more research is needed on understory composi-
tional responses to restoration treatments in P. ponderosa
forests, but there is little specific guidance available for
designing efficient sampling plans for monitoring understory

vegetation in ecological restoration experiments. A common
conclusion of sampling-design studies is that sampling
designs for ecological studies depend on the objectives of
the study (Gauch 1982; Kenkel et al. 1989). However, single-
vegetation sampling designs also are needed that have
flexibility for meeting multifactor study objectives, including
examining plant composition, diversity, and spatial patterns
and maximizing the number of species detected. Obtaining
these multifactor data simultaneously will become increas-
ingly important as monitoring plans for ecological res-
toration evolve toward examining multifactor ecosystem
characteristics (Covington et al. 1997).
The overall goal of this study was to examine the ecol-
ogy of understory differences among treatments in a
P. ponderosa restoration experiment, while simultaneously
assessing the sampling design and the statistical methods
on which conclusions are based. Specific objectives of this
study were to (1) compare understory species composition
among treatments in a P. ponderosa forest restoration and
to examine the relative abilities of a high- and a low-
intensity sampling method for detecting differences, (2)
determine the effects of using different data matrices
(e.g., frequency and cover) in compositional multivari-
ate analyses, and (3) assess sampling adequacy for detect-
ing
species
and
for
attaining
sample
compositional
homogeneity.
Methods
Study Area
This study was carried out in a 1,200-ha section of the
2,003-ha Fort Valley Experimental Forest (35˚160 N,
111˚430 W) within the Coconino National Forest, 15 km
north of the city of Flagstaff in northern Arizona. Annual
precipitation averages 57 cm, with 50% falling as snow
(Fule´ et al. 2001). Elevation of the study area is 2,300 m,
with rolling topography and slope gradients less than 25%.
Soils are of volcanic origin and consist of a complex of fine,
montmorillonitic, frigid Typic Argiborolls and Mollic
Eutroboralfs (Fule´ et al. 2001). General pre-settlement
vegetation consisted of widely spaced groups of Pinus
ponderosa averaging about 60 trees/ha (Mast et al. 1999).
The study area is part of a 3.4 million–ha complex of P.
ponderosa-dominated forests occupying portions of New
Mexico and north-central Arizona (Brown 1994). Pre-
settlement understory composition was dominated by
grasses, commonly Festuca arizonica (Arizona fescue),
Muhlenbergia montana (mountain muhly), Poa fendleriana
(muttongrass), and Elymus elymoides (squirreltail), and a
variety of forbs (Pearson 1942; Cooper 1960). European
settlement of the area beginning in the 1870s resulted in
the logging of large trees, overgrazing, and fire suppres-
sion, facilitating increases in P. ponderosa densities of
several hundred trees/ha or more (Cooper 1960). These
changes were manifested in rapid declines of grass cover
and understory diversity, culminating today in dense
stands susceptible to unnatural stand-replacing wildfires
(Covington & Moore 1994a).
Restoration Treatments
Thinning and burning restoration treatments began in the
study area in 1998 with the goals of reestablishing historic
forest structure and increasing native plant diversity. The
experiment included 12, 14-ha treatment (thin 1 burn) and
control areas, with three areas for each of four treatments
(Fule´ et al. 2001). All thinning treatments were burned
after thinning using strip headfires. Thinning treatments
were based on site-specific replacement ratios of pre-
settlement tree densities where different numbers of trees
of post-settlement origin were retained to replace old trees
that had previously died or had been logged (Fule´ et al.
2001). Treatments retained all live trees of pre-settlement
origin (age >120 years). In order of intensity, thinning
treatments included a 3–6 tree replacement (low intensity),
a 2–4 tree replacement (medium intensity), and a 1.5–3
tree replacement (high intensity). For example, the 1.5–3
treatment means that on average 1.5 post-settlement trees
greater than 40 cm in diameter at 1.4 m were retained on a
site for every dead old-growth tree and three post-settle-
ment trees less than 40 cm in diameter were retained if
sufficient larger trees did not occur within 20 m of a dead
old-growth
tree
location.
The
high-intensity
treat-
ment reduced density and basal area most closely to pre-
settlement levels. Pre- and post-treatment mean densities
(trees/ha) (all P. ponderosa) of the four treatments
(Fule´ et al. 2001), respectively, were as follows: 1,188 and
1,188 (control); 1,044 and 243 (low intensity); 1,492 and
170 (medium intensity); 956 and 140 (high intensity). Pre-
and post-treatment mean basal areas (m2/ha), respectively,
were as follows: 38 and 38 (control); 34 and 22 (low inten-
sity); 38 and 18 (medium intensity); 35 and 16 (high
intensity).
Plot Sampling
Twenty plots were established before treatment in 1998 on
a 60-m grid in each of the 12 treatment or control areas,
and trees were sampled on a 0.04-ha circular plot (Fule´
et al. 2001). Understory and substrate characteristics were
sampled on a 50-m transect centered at the plot center
using a point-intercept sampling method (Fule´ et al. 2001).
At points (166 total points per transect) every 30 cm
along the transect, the understory species present (if any)
and substrate (soil, rock, litter, or coarse woody debris)
were recorded. The point-intercept sampling method has
been widely used for understory sampling in ecological
restoration studies in this region and also is commonly
used for sampling rangeland vegetation (Stohlgren et al.
1998).
For the present study, two or three of the 20 plots of
each of the 12 treatment areas were randomly selected for
sampling, for eight plots for each of the four treatments.

Selected plots were required to be separated by at least
120 m from another selected plot to reduce spatial auto-
correlation (Hurlbert 1984). We used distance segregation
rather than sampling and averaging two or more close
plots because averaging would cause difficulty for some
of the statistical analyses, such as spatial statistics, that we
wished to apply to this dataset (Dale 1999). A mantel test
(Mantel 1967) of Sørensen plot distances (based on rela-
tive species frequencies) and geographic plot distances
(meters) found that community composition was not sig-
nificantly correlated with geographic distance (r 5 0.097,
p 5 0.1064, 9,999 permutations).
On each plot, a 13 50–m subplot transect, consisting of 50
contiguous 1-m2 subplots, was centered at the plot center and
orientated north–south. The percent cover of each species
rooted in each subplot was visually classified. Cover classifi-
cation was standardized by dividing subplots into quarters or
eighths and estimating cover to the nearest 1% up to 10%
cover and then at 5% intervals. Along the same transect,
understory vegetation and substrate also were sampled using
the point-intercept method. The subplot method is a more
intensive and time-consuming sampling method than the
point-intercept method, with the subplot method averaging
75minutes to complete per plot and the point-intercept method
averaging 15minutes. Plants not readily identified in the field
were collected and identified to species when possible.
Sampling occurred between 20 September 2002 and 28 October
2002. Nomenclature and classification of species as native or
exotic follows that of USDA-NRCS (2002).
Statistical Analyses
Indicator species analysis (Dufrene & Legendre 1997)
in the software PC-ORD (McCune & Mefford 1999)
was used to ascertain species that may have changed
in abundance after treatments and, thus, distinguished
treatments. This analysis integrates the proportional
abundance and constancy of a species in each treatment
into an indicator value that ranges from 0 (no indication) to
100 (perfect indication). Significance of indicator values was
assessed using a Monte-Carlo randomization test based on
1,000 permutations (McCune & Mefford 1999).
To test the null hypothesis of no difference in understory
species composition among treatments, we ran separate
multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP) analyses
using different plot 3 species data matrices (e.g., pres-
ence/absence and relative percent cover) derived from
subplot and point-intercept sampling methods. Multi-
response permutation procedures are multivariate, non-
parametric tests that evaluate the null hypothesis of no
difference, such as in species composition, between groups
(Zimmerman et al. 1985; McCune & Grace 2002). Our
purpose in these analyses was to compare relative abilities
of different sampling methods and data summary tech-
niques to detect differences among treatments. A priori,
we chose to use results from the subplot sampling method
and species importance values (average of relative frequency
and relative percent cover) and relative frequency (sums to
100 for all species on a plot) for assessing actual treatment
differences other than for methodological comparative
purposes. The subplot method was chosen because it is
the more intensive sampling design; importance values
were chosen because theoretically they are the most quan-
titative measure by integrating both relative percent cover
and frequency; and relative frequency was chosen because
it equalizes species of different growth forms and should
be the most reproducible measure because it does not
involve visual cover estimates. Using relative frequency
data
from
the
subplot
sampling
method,
we
also
partitioned the data into plant life form (e.g., forbs only)
and native/exotic species categories to determine the plant
groups most responsible for compositional treatment
differences. If an overall MRPP test among treatments
was significant, pairwise tests were used for multiple
comparisons (McCune & Mefford 1999).
We used Sørensen distances and PC-ORD default group
weightings for all MRPP analyses (McCune & Grace
2002). Multi-response permutation procedures also pro-
vide an A-statistic, the chance-corrected within-group
agreement, which provides an estimate of the effect size
that is independent of the sample size. A is maximized at 1
when all plots within groups are identical, but in commu-
nity ecology, A is commonly below 0.1 (McCune & Grace
2002). Species occurring in only one plot were removed
from the dataset before MRPP analyses; these rare species
increase the number of zeros and contribute little to ana-
lyses (Gauch 1982).
Mean richness of native and exotic species at 1-m2 and
50-m2 scales from the subplot sampling method was com-
pared among treatments in separate analyses using one-
way analysis of variance (df model 5 3, df error 5 28) and
Fisher’s least significant difference (SAS Institute 1999).
Raw data approximated homogeneity of variance (Levene
test) and normality (Shapiro–Wilk test) assumptions. To
examine whether sampling intensity influenced conclu-
sions, analysis of variance was used to compare mean
species richness per m2 among treatments with means
based on 10, 1-m2 subplots (located every 5 m) and on all
50, 1-m2 subplots per plot.
Species–Area and Compositional Curve Development
Species–area curves have long been used in many applica-
tions in vegetation ecology (Cain 1938; Connor & McCoy
1979; Palmer & White 1994). We used species–area and
compositional curves for assessing the adequacy of sub-
sampling in detecting species and in attaining composi-
tional homogeneity relative to a full sample. Minimum
sample area on species–area curves is indicated where
the curve generally levels off, and compositional homogen-
eity is indicated by a multivariate distance less than 10%
from a full sample (Dietvorst et al. 1982).
To evaluate the adequacy of the 50, 1-m2 subplot sam-
pling method for detecting species at a site, we constructed

species–area curves as a function of the number of subplots
sampled using PC-ORD (McCune & Mefford 1999). This
analysis calculates the mean number of species for differ-
ent combinations of subplot sample sizes, where sample
size is the number of subplots (McCune & Mefford 1999).
Compositional curves, using percent cover and Sørensen
distance, were simultaneously constructed following a pro-
cedure of centroid calculation for the full plot and subplot
combinations documented in McCune and Mefford (1999).
Species–area and compositional curves were calculated for
all 32 plots individually and then averaged into composite
curves. Standard errors are reported as a measure of how
the mean curve is likely to vary. We evaluated the ade-
quacy of the number of plots sampled for detecting species
and attaining compositional homogeneity in the geo-
graphic area of the experiment by constructing curves on
a plot basis. This procedure resulted in the construction of
one species–area and one compositional curve, and stan-
dard deviations are reported as a measure of the variability
of the data used for curve construction.
Results
Treatments were graminoid and forb dominated, with all
treatments except for the high-intensity restoration treat-
ment exhibiting greater cumulative frequencies of grami-
noids than forbs despite higher species richness of forbs
(Table1). Elymus elymoides, Carex geophila (White Moun-
tain
sedge),
Muhlenbergia
montana,
Cirsium
wheeleri
(Wheeler thistle), and Poa fendleriana were the most com-
mon species among treatments. Three exotic species exhib-
ited 1-m2 frequencies greater than 5%, with Verbascum
thapsus (common mullein) and Linaria dalmatica (dalmatian
toadflax) being the most frequent. Only 3 (E. elymoides,
C. wheeleri, and Pinus ponderosa seedlings) of the 90 species
recorded in this study exhibited significant (p < 0.05) indica-
tor values for a treatment in indicator species analysis. These
species were more common in restoration plots than in
control plots, although indicator values were low (<52).
Using data from the 50, 1-m2 subplot sampling method,
MRPP indicated that overall understory composition
differed significantly among treatments regardless of the

data matrix (e.g., mean cover and relative frequency) used
to summarize species abundances (Table 2). Results of
multiple comparisons, however, varied depending on the
data matrix. The a priori selected matrices of relative
frequency and importance values were the most sensitive
and approximately equally sensitive to treatment differ-
ences in multiple comparisons. No MRPP test for any
data matrix was significant using community data from
the point-intercept sampling method. Matrix partitioning
to determine the plant categories most responsible for
differences among treatments detected using the subplot
method indicated that grass species composition differed
among treatments in overall MRPP tests, whereas forb
composition did not (Table 3).
Mean richness of native and exotic species per 50 m2 did
not differ among treatments (Fig. 1). At the 1-m2 scale,
however, the high-intensity restoration treatment exhibited
significantly higher native species richness than did the other
treatments. Species-richness/m2 estimates from the subplot
sampling method based on 10, 1-m2 subplots (located every
5 m along a 50-m subplot transect) and based on all 50
subplots per plot were highly correlated (Pearson r 5 0.99).
Separate analyses of variance of species richness/m2 among
treatments using 10 subplots and using 50 subplots per plot
provided nearly identical results (Table4).
A species–area curve comparing the number of species
detected as a function of increasing numbers of 1-m2 sub-
plots sampled per plot averaged for all plots showed little

indication of leveling off (Fig. 2). When species that
occurred in only one subplot of a plot were removed,
however, on average, 93% of the total number of species
occurring on a 50-m2 plot had been detected after 25
subplots were sampled on a plot. Mean Sørensen distance
declined below 10% after about 30 subplots were sampled
on a plot, indicating that community compositional esti-
mates were relatively stable.
On a 50-m2 plot basis for all species, the species–area
curve increased sharply, indicating that the sampling
design did not adequately detect species across broader
scales in the geographic area of the experiment after 32
plots had been sampled (Fig. 3). Excluding species occur-
ring in only one plot, also similar to results for the subplots
(Fig. 2), resulted in the leveling off of the species–area
curve. Of the 90 total species recorded on plots in this
study, only 47 species occurred in more than one plot.
There was no apparent trend for higher or lower numbers
of rare species with treatment intensity, with all treatments
supporting between about 25 and 35% of species occurring
in only one plot.

Discussion
Species Composition
Exotic species Verbascum thapsus and Linaria dalmatica
were absent from control plots and increased in frequency
with increasing treatment intensity (Table 1). Verbascum
thapsus in the treatment areas probably originated from
the seed bank and germinated after soil disturbances and
open canopies were created by treatment application
(Gross & Werner 1978; Pratt et al. 1984). In pole-sized
Pinus ponderosa forests 130 km north of the study area, for
example, Springer (1999) reported that there were 917
viable seeds/m2 in the seed bank for V. thapsus, 12 times
more seeds than the next most common species. Verbas-
cum thapsus is a biennial, and although its seed may be
ubiquitous, this species typically does not persist for more
than a few years following disturbance in the presence of
competing vegetation (Gross & Werner 1978). It is un-
likely therefore that V. thapsus will remain an important
aboveground vegetation component in the restoration
communities. Linaria dalmatica, in contrast, is a long-
lived perennial, prolifically produces seed, and aggres-
sively spreads vegetatively by root expansion (Vujnovic
& Wein 1997). Although not currently frequent in the
restoration communities, the persistence and competitive
ability of L. dalmatica for soil moisture (Vujnovic & Wein
1997) suggest that this species is the exotic species of
greatest concern in the restoration treatments.
Rosa woodsii, a native species, was more frequent in the
control than in the treated areas (Table 1). However, 1-m2
frequency of this species in the control was variable, and
50-m2 frequencies were not appreciably different among
treatments. Vose and White (1987, 1991) concluded that a
prescribed burn did not significantly decrease R. woodsii
but noted a lack of other published research on the
response of this species to disturbance. Elymus elymoides
increased with treatment intensity, consistent with pre-
vious research (Young & Miller 1985; Vose & White 1991;
White et al. 1991). Detecting longer-term trends (>5 years)
in both native and exotic species dynamics in the restoration
communities requires repeated temporal monitoring and
is a research need for southwestern P. ponderosa forest
restoration.
Multi-Response Permutation Procedures
A more intensive subplot sampling method tested in this
study detected differences in community composition
among restoration treatments in overall MRPP tests for
any data matrix, whereas a less intensive point-intercept
sampling method did not detect differences among treat-
ments for any matrix. Sampling methods examined in this
study constrained community compositional results and
conclusions more than the data matrices used to summar-
ize data derived from a sampling method. A matrix of
relative species frequencies from the subplot sampling
method, however, detected more differences among treat-
ments than did matrices of mean or relative percent cover.
Relative frequency also performed similar to an impor-
tance value matrix (average of relative frequency and
relative cover), suggesting that obtaining plant cover esti-
mates during sampling was not necessary for detecting
differences in community composition among treatments
in this study.
Although the subplot method was more effective for
detecting treatment differences than the point-intercept
sampling method, the subplot method averaged 75 minutes
of sampling time per plot compared with 15 minutes for
the point-intercept method. To standardize sampling time
at 15 minutes between methods, we conducted MRPP tests
using a subset of 10 (located every 5 m) of the 50, 1-m2
subplots per plot with species data summarized by a rela-
tive frequency matrix. An overall MRPP test among
treatments also was significant (A 5 0.044, t 5 23.20,
p 5 0.0045) and comparable to results using all 50 subplots
(A 5 0.046, t 5 23.19, p 5 0.0046). This finding suggests
that if rapid assessments of species composition are
needed, then a sampling design employing a dispersed
arrangement of small subplots is more effective for
detecting treatment differences than is point-intercept
sampling.

distances for matrices derived from the point-intercept
sampling method were higher than for the subplot method.
Higher
within-group
distances
indicate
greater
com-
positional variability within a treatment, making it more
difficult to detect treatment differences. These higher
distances associated with the point-intercept method were
a sampling phenomenon where this method quantified
community composition less effectively than the subplot
method. Ranked species importance values from the
subplot
method
resulted
in
the
lowest
within-group
Sørensen distances, but this ranking results in the ques-
tionable procedure of assigning quantitative values to
species when they are absent (McCune & Grace 2002).
Ranking the distance matrix (importance value ranked
distance matrix) resulted in lower within-group distances
and a higher A-statistic, consistent with previous reports
(McCune
&
Grace
2002).
This
ranking
procedure,
however, caused decreased sensitivity to treatment dif-
ferences compared to the unranked importance value
matrix.
Species Richness and Area Curves
Differences in species richness among treatments were
scale specific, with a high-intensity restoration treatment
exhibiting
significantly
greater
mean
native
species
richness than other treatments at a 1-m2 scale but not at
a 50-m2 scale. Native species richness/m2 did not increase
significantly until the high-intensity restoration treatment,
suggestive at least in the short term of a treatment-inten-
sity threshold that needed to be passed before native rich-
ness increased. However, exotic richness also increased
with treatment intensity, due to greater frequencies of
species
such
as
Cirsium
vulgare
(bull
thistle)
and
L. dalmatica in the medium- and high-intensity restoration
treatments.
Mean-species-richness/m2 estimates based on a subset of
10, 1-m2 subplots per plot differed by only 0.05 species or
less from estimates based on all 50 subplots per plot for all
treatments. This similarity is consistent with results of
MRPP compositional analyses, where results of an overall
test were nearly identical between relative frequency
matrices from 10 and 50 subplots. Although sampling a
small area per plot such as 10 m2 may be inadequate for
many community sampling objectives like detecting rare
species, the ability of 10 dispersed subplots per plot to
effectively quantify community characteristics such as spe-
cies richness at fine scales suggests that such sampling
designs show promise for rapidly monitoring restoration
effectiveness. However, species–area curves indicated that
incorporating larger plots into the sampling design would
be necessary to increase species detection at the site scale
and in the geographic area in which the restoration experi-
ment is conducted. Maximizing species detection during
sampling is important in many restoration contexts, such as
for the early detection of exotic species before infestations
occur (Stohlgren et al. 1998).
Conclusion
An advantage of contiguous subplot sampling methods such
as the one employed in this study is that they facilitate the
application of spatial statistics for examining patterns of
species and species-richness distributions (Dale 1999).
Unless plants are mapped, sampling methods such as mod-
ified 0.1-ha Whittaker sampling plots do not generate the
type of data needed for spatial statistics applications at plot
scales (Stohlgren et al. 1995). It is unlikely, however, that the
intensive subplot method tested in this study could achieve a
community sampling goal of maximizing species detection
because it is difficult to cover large areas during sampling.
Future research could examine ways to extend contiguous
subplot methods to sample larger areas, by increasing the
size of subplots (greater than the 1 m2 used in this study), to
possibly improve species detection while facilitating spatial
pattern analyses.
Short-term (3 years) species compositional differences
among treatments in this experiment were subtle, indi-
cated by low MRPP t-statistics in multivariate analyses
(McCune & Grace 2002). Univariate indicator species
analysis (Dufrene & Legendre 1997) returned significant
indicator values for only 3% of the species recorded in this
study, suggesting that few individual species were substan-
tially more abundant in specific treatments. Indicator spe-
cies analysis was not successful in this study because
differences among treatments resulted from cumulative
differences in individual species expressed on a community
basis; therefore, multivariate methods such as MRPP could
detect treatment differences, whereas the univariate indi-
cator species analysis could not. Studies such as this one
that examine the community ecology and sampling effi-
ciency of understory vegetation with a goal of including
species composition, diversity, and pattern in a multifactor
sampling approach tractable for multivariate analyses will
be increasingly needed to design efficient monitoring
strategies for ecological restoration experiments.
