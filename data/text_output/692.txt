Intended Applications
Qualitative assessments of rangeland health
provide land managers and technical assistance
specialists with a good communication tool for
use with the public. Many of these tools have
been used successfully for this purpose over the
past 100 years. This technique, in association
with quantitative monitoring and inventory
information, can be used to provide early warn-
ings of resource problems on upland range-
lands. Rangelands are defined as “land on which
the indigenous vegetation (climax or natural
potential) is predominantly grasses, grass-like
plants, forbs, or shrubs and is managed as a
natural ecosystem. If plants are introduced,
they are managed similarly. Rangelands include
natural grasslands, savannas, shrublands, many
deserts, tundra, alpine communities, marshes,
and wet meadows”
(Society for Range
Management 1999). Included in this definition
are oak and pinyon-juniper woodlands.
The approach described in this technical reference
IS designed to:
• Be used only by knowledgeable, experienced
people.
• Provide a preliminary evaluation of soil/site
stability, hydrologic function, and integrity of
the biotic community (at the ecological site
level).
• Help land managers identify areas that are
potentially at risk of degradation.
• Provide early warnings of potential problems
and opportunities.
• Be used to communicate fundamental ecolog-
ical concepts to a wide variety of audiences in
the field.
• Improve communication among interest groups
by focusing discussion on critical ecosystem
properties and processes.
• Select monitoring sites in the development of
monitoring programs.
• Help understand and communicate rangeland
health issues.
The approach is NOT to be used to:
• Identify the cause(s) of resource problems.
• Make grazing and other management decisions.
• Monitor land or determine trend.
• Independently generate national or regional
assessments of rangeland health.
This procedure has been developed for use by
experienced, knowledgeable land managers. It
is not intended that this assessment procedure
be used by individuals who do not have experi-
ence or knowledge of the rangeland ecological
sites they are evaluating.This approach requires
a good understanding of ecological processes,
vegetation, and soils for each of the sites to
which it is applied. Furthermore, as compre-
hensive ecological site descriptions (which are
used for reference) are not available for most
sites, the user is frequently required to generate
reference information based on their knowl-
edge of the range of spatial and temporal vari-
ability apparent in a particular ecological site.
This will frequently require two or more
individuals (e.g., ecologist and soil scientist) to
work together to make the evaluation.

Introduction
The science of assessing rangelands is changing
as concepts and protocols continue to evolve.
Recently the concept of rangeland health was
advanced by a panel assembled by the National
Research Council as an alternative to range
condition. The ecological status concept is cur-
rently used by most range professionals as the
basis for inventory and assessment. Although
the term “health” has been controversial when
used in association with natural systems (Smith
1999, Wicklum and Davies 1995, Lackey 1998
and Rapport et al. 1998), the current document
follows the lead provided by the National
Academy of Science (National Research
Council 1994).
The National Research Council (1994) publi-
cation, Rangeland Health, New Methods to
Classify, Inventory, and Monitor Rangelands
defined rangeland health as:
"the degree to which the integrity of the soil
and ecological processes of rangeland
ecosystems are maintained."
In a parallel effort, the Society for Range
Management’s 
committee 
on 
Unity 
in
Concepts and Terminology recommended that
rangeland assessments should focus on the
maintenance of soil at the site (Task Group on
Unity in Concepts and Terminology 1995). A
federal interagency ad hoc committee was
established to integrate the concepts of these
two groups into the various agencies’ rangeland
inventories and assessments. This committee
refined the previous definition to read:
The degree to which the integrity of the
soil, vegetation, water, and air, as well as
the ecological processes of the rangeland
ecosystem, are balanced and sustained.
They defined integrity to mean: Maintenance
of the functional attributes characteristic of a
locale, including normal variability.
The challenge to scientists and managers is to
translate this concept involving complex eco-
logical processes and components into terms
that the public can comprehend and that
resource specialists can use to assist in identifying
rangeland sites where ecological processes are
or are not functioning properly. This document
describes a process to educate the public and
agency personnel on using observable indicators
to interpret and assess rangeland health. This
process relies on the use of a qualitative (i.e.,
non-measurement) procedure to assess the
functional status of each indicator. The use of
qualitative assessments is suggested as a fast
survey technique to rate site protection indica-
tors, including both plant and soil components
(Morgan 1986).
The use of qualitative information (e.g., obser-
vations) to determine range and soil conditions
has a long history of use in land management
inventory and monitoring. Early procedures
that made use of indicator ratings (i.e., a score-
card approach) included the Interagency Range
Survey of 1937, Deming Two-Phase, and Parker
Three-Step Method that determined, among
other things, site-soil stability and usefulness of
forage for livestock grazing (Wagner 1989).The
Bureau of Land Management (BLM) also used
soil surface factors to determine the erosional
status of public lands in the 1970s (USDI
1973). Interagency Technical Reference 1737-9,
Riparian Area Management:
Process for
Assessing Proper Functioning Condition (USDI
1993), included a qualitative checklist to assess
the proper functioning condition of riparian
areas.

This interagency technical reference incorpo-
rates concepts and materials from previous
inventory and monitoring procedures, as well as
from the National Research Council’s book on
Rangeland Health (NRC 1994) and the Society
for Range Management's Task Group on Unity
in Concepts and Terminology (1995).
Earlier versions of the current procedure were
developed concurrently. An interagency techni-
cal team led by the BLM developed Version
1a (Pellant 1996). The Natural Resources
Conservation Service (NRCS) developed
Version 1b, as published in the National Range
and Pasture Handbook (USDA 1997). Another
interagency team melded these concepts and
protocols with the results from numerous field
tests of Version 1a (Rasmussen, Pellant, and
Pyke 1999) and Version 1b into Version 2.
Version 2 received peer review and numerous
other comments to arrive at the process
described herein, which is Version 3.
Along the way, this procedure has been termed
“rapid assessment,” “qualitative assessment of
rangeland health,” and “visualization of range-
land health.” This document refers to the
procedure as Interpreting Indicators of Rangeland
Health, Version 3. This version will be revised
in the future as science and experience pro-
vides additional information on indicators of
rangeland health and their assessment.

Relationship to
Similarity Index and
Trend Studies
Similarity index (range condition) and trend
studies have long been used to assess the condi-
tions of rangeland. The similarity index is an
index of where the current plant community is
in relation to the historic climax plant commu-
nity, or to a desired plant community, that is
one of the site’s potential vegetation states.
Trend is a determination of the direction of
change in the current plant community and
associated soils in relation to the historic climax
plant community or some other desired plant
community.
This rangeland health assessment is an attempt
to look at how the ecological processes on a site
are functioning. These three assessment tools
(similarity index, trend, and rangeland health
assessment) evaluate the rangeland site from
different perspectives and are not necessarily
correlated.

Ecological processes include the water cycle
(the capture, storage, and redistribution of pre-
cipitation), energy flow (conversion of sunlight
to plant and animal matter), and nutrient cycle
(the cycle of nutrients such as nitrogen and
phosphorus through the physical and biotic
components of the environment).
Ecological processes functioning within a normal
range of variation will support specific plant
and animal communities. Direct measures of
site integrity and status of ecological processes
are difficult or expensive to measure due to the
complexity of the processes and their interrela-
tionships. Therefore, biological and physical
attributes are often used as indicators of the
functional status of ecological processes and
site integrity.
The product of this qualitative assessment is
not a single rating of rangeland health, but an
assessment of three components called attrib-
utes (Table 1).
Definitions of these three closely interrelated
attributes are:
Soil/Site Stability
The capacity of the site to limit redistribution
and loss of soil resources (including nutrients
and organic matter) by wind and water.
Attributes of
Rangeland Health
Hydrologic Function
The capacity of the site to capture, store, and
safely release water from rainfall, run-on, and
snowmelt (where relevant), to resist a reduction
in this capacity, and to recover this capacity
following degradation.
Integrity of the Biotic
Community
The capacity of the site to support characteristic
functional and structural communities in the
context of normal variability, to resist loss of
this function and structure due to disturbance,
and to recover following disturbance.
Based upon a preponderance of evidence
approach for the applicable indicators, each of
these three attributes of rangeland health are
summarized in Part 3 of the Rangeland Health
Evaluation Summary Worksheet (Appendix 1).
This assessment is preliminary and may be
modified with the interpretation of applicable
quantitative monitoring and inventory data.
Both the original rating and any modification of
it require a written explanation.
To reiterate, the process described here will not
produce just one rating of rangeland health,
but three attributes departure from the
ecological site description/ecological reference
area(s).

Soil/Site Stability

Concepts
A discussion of two concepts essential to
understanding and properly using this assess-
ment procedure follow.
Transitions, Thresholds, and
States
Transitions are shifts in plant composition that
result in relatively stable states, as reflected in
composition and structure. These shifts can
occur by natural forces or as a result of human
actions. Disturbances are natural and necessary
parts of all ecosystems. Healthy ecosystems are
both resistant to external disturbance and
resilient or able to recover if external distur-
bances occur (Pimm 1984), thereby allowing
various combinations of plant species to
fluctuate over time.
A threshold is a transition boundary that an
ecosystem crosses resulting in a new stable state
that is not easily reversed without significant
inputs of resources (NRC 1994). Once an
ecosystem crosses a threshold, it may be very
difficult to restore the original plant community
and ecological processes by changes in manage-
ment alone. Expensive restoration measures
(e.g., weed control, seeding, soil modifications
or additions) may be necessary to restore these
degraded ecosystems.
Indicators
Unfortunately, ecological processes are difficult
to observe or measure in the field due to the
complexity of most rangeland ecosystems.
Indicators are components of a system whose
characteristics (e.g., presence or absence, quan-
tity, distribution) are used as an index of an
attribute (e.g., rangeland health) that is too dif-
ficult, inconvenient, or expensive to measure.
Just as the Dow Jones Index is used to gauge
the strength of the stock market, so different
combinations of the 17 indicators (Appendix
6) are used to gauge soil/site stability, hydrolog-
ic function, and the integrity of the biotic
community of selected rangeland ecological
sites. Each of the indicators is followed by five
descriptors with a narrative that the evaluator(s)
reviews prior to agreeing on an appropriate
category for each indicator.
Indicators have historically been used in range-
land monitoring and resource inventories by
land management and technical assistance
agencies. These indicators focused on vegetation
(e.g., production, composition, density) or soil
stability as indicators of rangeland condition or
livestock carrying capacity. Such single indica-
tor assessments are inadequate to determine
rangeland health because they do not reflect
nor assess the complexity of the ecological
processes. There is no one indicator of ecosys-
tem health; instead, a suite of key indicators
should be used for an assessment (Karr 1992).

Instructions for Use
A rangeland health assessment provides infor-
mation on the functioning of the ecological site.
This assessment provides information that is
not available with other methods of evaluation.
It gives an indication of the status of the three
attributes chosen to represent the health of the
“area of interest” (i.e., the area where the eval-
uation of the rangeland health attributes takes
place). This interest may be due to concern
about current condition, lack of information
on condition, or public perceptions on the
condition of the area of interest.
The following instructions are intended to pro-
vide a step-by-step guide for the user. The steps
are identified along with the worksheet(s)
required to complete each step. The action or
concept for that step is then explained.
Step 1. Identify the
Evaluation Area, Verify Soil
and Ecological Site
Identification
Complete the Rangeland Health Evaluation
Summary Worksheet, Part 1 (Appendix 1).
Describe the area of interest (area where evalua-
tion is conducted)
Part 1 of the Rangeland Health Evaluation
Summary Worksheet is used to record informa-
tion on site location for the evaluation of an
area of interest and basic site characteristic
information (Appendix 1). Parts 2 and 3 of this
worksheet are completed during Steps 5 and 6.
Critical items that must be completed on this
form are shown in bold print.
The evaluation area (area of interest) should be
large enough to include the natural variability
associated with each ecological site being
assessed. Upon arrival at the location, the eval-
uator(s) should identify the boundaries of the
area of interest and walk 1 to 2 acres of each
ecological site (if more than one ecological site
is present in the area of interest). This enables
the evaluator(s) to become familiar with the
plant species, soil surface features, and the
variability of the area of interest.
Surrounding features which may affect ecolog-
ical processes within the area of interest should
also be noted. The topographic position of the
area of interest, adjacent roads, trails, watering
points, gullies, timber harvests, and other dis-
turbances can all affect onsite processes. The
topographic position should be carefully
described with documentation of offsite influ-
ences on the area of interest.There is significant
variability in the potential of different sites
associated with relatively minor differences in
landscape position and soils (e.g., differences in
aspect, or location at the top vs. bottom of a
slope). Landscape position and surrounding
features are documented in Part 1 of the
Rangeland 
Health 
Evaluation 
Summary
Worksheet (Appendix 1).
Photographs, slides, or digital images should be
taken and included as an attachment to this
worksheet. Two general view photographs
taken in different directions (include some sky-
line for future point of reference) should be
taken along with photographs that illustrate
important indicator values or anomalies.
Verify the soil and ecological site
Each ecological site within the area of interest
should be verified by matching the site to the
appropriate ecological site description and soils.
The best way to confirm the soil classification,

12
and thus the ecological site, is for a soil scientist
to dig one or more shallow pits to verify that
the soil classification matches the soils at the
area of interest. The evaluator(s) should review
the ecological site description for consistency
with the soils and vegetation found on the area
of interest.
All soil map units have inclusions of soils other
than those in the map unit name; location of a
site on an inclusion is not recommended. If the
area of interest falls on an inclusion, special care
must be taken in comparing the sites with the
appropriate ecological reference area(s) (ERAs)
(see Step 2) and the ecological site description.
If the soil map unit is a soil association or soil
complex (i.e., includes more than one soil
series), the soil series that occurs within the area
of interest should be identified and recorded.
The rangeland ecological site description con-
tains information in the soils sections to aid in
the verification of the site. Those soil features
that are important to the soil/plant/air/water
relationships are the items of interest. Soil
texture for each horizon, and soil depth, or
depth to horizons which may restrict water
movement or root growth (e.g., calcic or sodic)
or hold more water (e.g., argillic) and other
soil 
features 
which 
are 
important 
to
soil/plant/air/water relationships need to be
verified. Each rangeland ecological site will
have its own set of important soil features
that are identified in the site description and
will need to be considered in the correlation
process. The information needed in the
Rangeland 
Health 
Evaluation 
Summary
Worksheet, Part 1 (Appendix 1), and in the
Ecological Reference Area Worksheet for the
Soil/Site Verification Section (Appendix 2) can
be found in the soils section of the rangeland
ecological site description.
Actions to take if soil and/or ecological site
information is not available
Comparisons between the ecological reference
area (see Step 2) and one or more areas of
interest are difficult in areas where a soil survey
has not been completed and/or ecological site
descriptions have not been developed or are not
adequate. Identification of ERAs is hindered
and correlation between ERAs and area(s) of
interest is difficult. Soil information in the
ecological site description and soil survey or soil
series descriptions are good sources of informa-
tion to piece together the potential for erosion
on the site. Soil information, together with
information on the climate, including storm
types, intensities, and duration provides infor-
mation necessary to conduct the assessment.
Vegetation information may be available in
other sources such as habitat type descriptions,
long-term monitoring studies, and other inven-
tory data. If possible, obtain the assistance of a
qualified soil scientist to assist the evaluator(s)
in making the initial soil/site correlations.
The process used to conduct the evaluation
without the required soils and ecological site
information should be clearly documented by
the team on the Ecological Reference Area
Worksheet (Appendix 2).
Step 2. Visit an Ecological
Reference Area
Complete the Cover Worksheet (Appendix 3),
Species Dominance Worksheet (Appendix 4),
Functional/Structural Groups Worksheet (Appendix
5), and Ecological Reference Area Worksheet
(Appendix 2), in that order.
An ecological reference area (ERA) is a land-
scape unit in which ecological processes are
functioning within a normal range of variability
and the plant community has adequate resist-
ance to and resilience from most disturbances.
An ERA is the visual representation of the
characteristics and variability of the compo-
nents found in the ecological site description.
These areas do not need to be pristine, histori-
cally unused lands (e.g., climax plant communi-
ties or relict areas). This concept is similar to
that proposed by the Western Regional

Coordinating Committee-40 on Rangeland
Research of using well-managed rangelands and
appropriate relict areas as benchmarks for
assessments (West et al.1994). The concept of
ERAs is an integral component in the
development of ecological site descriptions.
Information obtained from the Cover, Species
Dominance, and Functional/Structural Groups
Worksheets provides useful information in
completing the Ecological Reference Area
Worksheet. The influences of wildland fire on
the ERA should also be documented on the
Ecological Reference Area Worksheet.
Completing the Cover Worksheet (Appendix 3)
The Cover Worksheet is divided into two sec-
tions: The Life Forms section, where canopy
cover is estimated for important life forms (e.g.,
grass, forb, shrub, tree, succulents, and biological
crusts) and the Ground Cover section, where
the amount (cover) of bare ground, litter,
standing dead vegetation, rock/gravel, biological
crust, and plants are estimated.
Canopy cover is the percentage of the ground
covered by plant foliage. When estimating
canopy cover, small openings (less than 2 inch-
es in diameter) within the canopy are included
as cover. Canopy cover of plants removed by
grazing is not reconstructed to pregrazing
canopy for this estimate. Estimate only the
canopy cover present at the time the evaluation
is conducted. This ensures an accurate picture
of the actual site protection from raindrop
impacts at the time that the assessment is
conducted.
The cover in the Life Forms section includes
cover estimates of the overlapping canopies of
different life forms. For example, the cover of
both a grass beneath a shrub canopy and the
canopy cover of the shrub are estimated and
recorded on the worksheet in the appropriate
categories. The subdivisions of life forms for
each life form class (e.g., annuals, native peren-
nial, exotic perennial under the Grass category)
may be deleted and other categories added to
better represent local vegetation. The cover
ranges may also be changed to better fit natural
or ecologically relevant breaks in cover for
different areas.
The Ground Cover section represents the pro-
portion of the soil that is protected from being
hit directly by a raindrop. Ground cover is the
percentage of material (e.g., litter, standing
dead vegetation, gravel/rocks, vascular plants,
and biological crust), covering the land surface.
In contrast with the Life Forms section, over-
lapping cover classes are not estimated.
Ground cover is estimated by recording cover
estimates of the first contact (i.e., highest
contact above soil surface) with live vascular
plants, standing dead vegetation, litter, biologi-
cal crust, rock/gravel, and bare ground.The sum
of these six cover categories should roughly
total 100 percent, given the use of ranges of
cover instead of discrete cover values on the
form. If cover measurements are taken, they
may be inserted into the Cover Worksheet in
lieu of a checkmark for the appropriate cover
category.
The total cover of the vegetation Life Forms
will not necessarily equal the Vascular Plants
cover value in the Ground Cover section since
the former contains cover estimates for over-
lapping canopies while the latter does not.
The litter category in the Ground Cover sec-
tion includes both persistent and non-persistent
litter. Litter includes all dead organic matter in
contact with the soil surface.
Standing dead vegetation includes all plants
that have been dead more than one growing
season that are not in direct contact with the
soil surface. Standing dead vegetation is
important in protecting the site from raindrop
contact, while litter provides the same site
protection and is an important source of organic
matter via decomposition in many areas.

14
The rock/gravel category includes all material
with a diameter greater than 0.2 inch. Any
gravel less than this diameter is recorded as bare
ground.
Biological crust includes lichens,
mosses,
cyanobacteria, and algae that grow on the soil
surface. It is sometimes difficult to differentiate
biological crust from bare soil or dead organic
matter during the dry portion of summer.
Spraying questionable areas with water and
waiting a minute will often give live lichens
or mosses a greenish tinge indicating live
tissue. Conversely, cyanobacteria crusts are
often very difficult to identify, especially when
weakly developed, without a careful examina-
tion of the internal structure of the crust.
Cyanobacteria crusts are generally not included
when estimating cover.
Training is required to estimate cover in the
classes shown on the form. A quick procedure
to train inexperienced personnel in estimating
cover or to collect quantitative data is the
Step-Point 
Method 
described 
in 
the
Interagency Technical Reference, Sampling
Vegetation Attributes (NARSC 1996).The infor-
mation on the Cover Worksheet is useful in ver-
ifying consistency with cover information in the
ecological site description.
Completing the Species Dominance Worksheet
(Appendix 4)
The Species Dominance Worksheet is used to
identify the dominant species based upon
either production or cover. State or federally
listed noxious weeds and invasive plants are
also recorded. The evaluator(s) should be
trained in the identification of all state or fed-
erally listed noxious weeds prior to conducting
any evaluations. New noxious weed locations
should be reported immediately to the appro-
priate person or office.
Part 1 is required, while Part 2 (Dominant
Species by Life Form) is recommended but not
required. Do not reconstruct canopy cover or
production when determining species domi-
nance if utilization of plants has occurred. It is
not necessary to fill each blank in the list with
a plant name if additional dominant species in
that life form are not present or are rare.
Completing the Functional/Structural Groups
Worksheet (Appendix 5)
This worksheet is used to group species into
life form/functional/structural categories to
aid in the rating of Indicator 12, Functional/
Structural Groups. It is important for the eval-
uator(s) to have a good understanding of plant
function, including but not limited to, nitrogen
fixers, deep versus shallow rooted plants, warm
versus cool season plants, and native versus
invasive plants. Examples of functional/struc-
tural groups and more information on the
determination of these groups may be found in
the narrative for Indicator 12 (Functional/
Structural Groups) in Step 5.
Completing the Ecological Reference Area
Worksheet (Appendix 2)
Once the rangeland ecological site description
and potential ERAs are identified, the evalua-
tor(s) should visit the potential ERAs and
determine (using the Ecological Reference Area
Worksheet) if the ERAs are functioning at least
as well as described in the ecological site
description with respect to soil and site stability,
hydrologic function, and biotic integrity. A
number of different plant communities have
the potential to meet these criteria. Species
composition does not have to match the eco-
logical site description; however, the functional
and structural groups must closely match the
potential depicted in the ecological site
description.
Before assessing the health of an area of inter-
est, some understanding of the structure, func-
tion, and dynamics of the local landscape is
required. The evaluator needs to develop a
benchmark. This is a combination of the eco-
logical site description and an ERA, to which

V E R S I O N  3

I N T E R P R E T I N G  I N D I C A T O R S  O F  R A N G E L A N D  H E A L T H
15
the area of interest will be compared.
Evaluators must identify the soils (see Steps 1
and 2 for instructions on the soil/site verifica-
tion process) and climate, while considering the
geomorphology and the geographic location of
the area of interest. Ecological site descriptions
and soil surveys provide much of this needed
information, but many past ecological site
descriptions only describe a single plant com-
munity, the historic climax. It is also important
to remember that healthy rangelands are vari-
able and that a number of stable states repre-
senting a suite of species and compositions
(stable vegetation communities e.g.,Westoby et
al. 1989) may exist for each ecological site.
Care must be taken in using the ecological site
description or ERA as the benchmark when
disturbances have occurred. For example, if a
fire occurred 5 years ago in the area of interest,
the ERA should reflect the effects of a recent
burn. To obtain this understanding, the evalua-
tor(s) reviews appropriate rangeland ecological
site (range site) descriptions and selects and uses
appropriate ERAs for training and evaluation.
Sources to assist in the selection of potential
ERAs include:
• Ecological site descriptions
• Soil surveys
• Topographic maps
• Vegetation inventories
• Research Natural Areas, Wilderness Study
Areas, or other protected (large exclosures)/
special management areas
• Historical records and photographs
• Well-managed rangelands (grazing use is
appropriate to maintain ecological processes
and the plant community in a proper func-
tioning state); grazing use pattern maps are
helpful in identifying these areas.
Evaluators need to examine ERAs in the same
year and season as the area of interest since
weather during that year may affect the rating
of indicators. However, ERAs may be located in
different watersheds within the geographic
region. At each ERA, the evaluator(s) should
take photographs and record baseline informa-
tion on indicator status by completing the
Ecological Reference Area Worksheet and
conducting quantitative cover studies.
There are instances when ERAs are not avail-
able for selected ecological sites due to past dis-
turbance. In these cases, rangeland ecological
site descriptions should be used along with the
best available field sites to reconstruct the ERA
on the Ecological Reference Area Worksheet.
Historical journals, photographs, similar ecolog-
ical sites, and scientific literature along with
knowledge of the area (including the interdisci-
plinary team and users of the land) are other
useful tools in the reconstruction process.
Document the reconstruction process and
rationale on the Ecological Reference Area
Worksheet or on an attachment to it.
Step 3. Review/Modify
Descriptors of Indicators at
the Ecological Reference
Area
Complete the Rangeland Health Indicator
Evaluation Matrix Worksheet (Appendix 6).
Ideally, each ecological site would have a
unique set of descriptors (i.e., narrative under
the five categories) for each indicator. In lieu of
this, a set of standard or generic descriptors
(called default descriptors) have been devel-
oped for each indicator and are listed in the
Rangeland Health Indicator Evaluation Matrix
(Appendix 6). These descriptors are used in the
evaluation of areas of interest if they “fit” the
observations on the indicators found on the
ecological reference area. If the default descrip-
tor does not fit an indicator, the evaluator(s)
should modify the descriptor in the “revised
descriptor” space found below the “default
descriptor.”

This Rangeland Health Indicator Evaluation
Matrix, with the revised descriptors, should
be used on subsequent evaluations on that
same ecological site. Therefore, it is impor-
tant to fill out the site documentation infor-
mation at the top of this Matrix if any of the
descriptors are revised. These modifications
in the descriptors will aid in the ongoing
development of ecological site specific
indicators and descriptors. Copies of the
Rangeland Health Indicator Evaluation
Matrix with the modified descriptors should
be forwarded to the person responsible for
maintaining ecological site descriptions in
the state (usually the NRCS State
Rangeland Management Specialist).
Indicators of soil/site stability are more likely to
require these changes due to the inherently
higher erosion potential on certain ecological
sites. An example follows (Table 2) of possible
changes in the descriptor narrative for the
bare ground indicator for a badlands site
(Appendix 6). Similar changes could be made
for other indicators.

Worksheets (Repeat Step 2,
Numbers 1-3)
Complete the Cover Worksheet (Appendix 3),
Species Dominance Worksheet (Appendix 4), and
Functional/Structural Groups Worksheet–the
“Actual” column (Appendix 5).
Refer to Step 2, Numbers 1-3, for instructions
on completing the Cover, Species Dominance,
and Functional/Structural Groups Worksheets.
These three worksheets provide background
information that is used in Step 5 to rate the
individual indicators.
Step 5. Rate the 17 Indicators
on the Area of Interest
Complete the Rangeland Health Evaluation
Summary Worksheet, Part 2 (Appendix 1), using
the Rangeland Health Indicator Evaluation
Matrix (Appendix 6).
The evaluator(s) selects the category descriptor
(i.e., narrative) that most closely describes the
site for each indicator on the Rangeland Health
Indicator Evaluation Matrix (Appendix 6) and
records it on the Rangeland Health Evaluation
Summary Worksheet, Part 2. The rating for
each indicator in the area of interest is based on
that indicator’s degree of departure from the
ecological site description and/or ecological
reference area(s) (ERAs). Comparisons of
cover (Cover Worksheet), species dominance
(Species Dominance Worksheet), and functional/
structural plant groups (Functional/ Structural
Groups Worksheet) on the area of interest
relative to their proper functioning condition
on the ERA and/or as described in the eco-
logical site description are valuable sources of
information when evaluating indicators.
For each area of interest that is assessed, the
appropriate 
Ecological 
Reference 
Area
Worksheet (if an ERA is used or if the site
potential is reconstructed from an ecological
site description) should be reviewed and used
in conducting field evaluations on areas of
interest.
Narrative descriptors in the Rangeland Health
Indicator Evaluation Matrix are intended to aid
in the determination of the degree of departure.
The narrative descriptors for each indicator
form a relative scale from “Extreme” to “None
to Slight.” Not all indicator descriptors will
match what is observed requiring a “best fit”
approach in making the ratings. The rating for
each indicator should be supported by com-
ments in the space provided under each indica-
tor rating. In some instances there may be no
evidence of the indicator on the area of interest.
However, it is still rated “None to Slight.”
The “revised descriptors for an indicator is used
to rate indicators if the “default descriptor” on
the Rangeland Health Indicator Evaluation
Matrix did not adequately represent the range
and status of an indicator found in the ecologi-
cal site description and/or at the ERA. Revised
descriptors for indicators are developed and
recorded in Step 3.
When making an assessment, the history of dis-
turbances (e.g., drought, fire) should be consid-
ered. For example, if a fire occurred 5 years ago
in the area being assessed, reduced shrub (e.g.,
sagebrush) cover is not an indication of lack of
biotic integrity if the natural successional
process for shrub reestablishment is occurring.
Comments on wildfire return intervals (expected
and current) may also be documented in the
comments section on this worksheet.
Descriptions of each indicator are provided
in the following sections. Photographs of the
indicators are located in Appendix 7.

1. Rills
Rills are small erosional rivulets that are gener-
ally linear and do not necessarily follow the
microtopography as flow patterns do. They are
formed through complex interactions between
raindrops, overland flow, and the characteristics
of the soil surface (Bryan 1987). The potential
for rills increases as the degree of disturbance
(loss of cover) and slope increases. Some soils
have a greater potential for rill formation than
others (Bryan 1987, Quansah 1985).Therefore,
it is important to establish the degree of
natural versus accelerated rill formation by
interpretations made from the soil survey,
rangeland ecological site description, and the
ecological reference area. Generally, concentrat-
ed flow erosional processes are accelerated
when the distance between rills decreases and
the depth and width of rills increase (Morgan
1986, Bryan 1987).

2. Water Flow Patterns
Flow patterns are the path that water takes
(i.e., accumulates) as it moves across the soil
surface during overland flow. Overland flow will
occur during rainstorms or snowmelt when a
surface crust impedes water infiltration, or the
infiltration capacity is exceeded. These patterns
are generally evidenced by litter, soil or gravel
redistribution, or pedestalling of vegetation or
stones that break the flow of water (Morgan
1986). Interrill erosion caused by overland flow
has been identified as the dominant sediment
transport mechanism on rangelands (Tiscareño-
Lopez et al., 1993). Water flow patterns are
controlled in length and coverage by the num-
ber and kinds of obstructions to water flow
provided by basal intercepts of living or dead
plants, biological crust, persistent litter, or
rocks. They are rarely continuous, and appear
and disappear as the slope and microtopography
of the slope changes.
Generally, as slope increases and ground cover
decreases, flow patterns increase (Morgan
1986). Soils with inherently low infiltration
capacity may have a large number of natural
flow patterns.

3. Pedestals and/or Terracettes
Pedestals and terracettes are important indicators
of the movement of soil by water and/or by wind
(Anderson 1974, Morgan 1986, Satterlund and
Adams 1992, Hudson 1993). Pedestals are
rocks or plants that appear elevated as a result
of soil loss by wind or water erosion. Pedestals
can also be caused by non-erosional processes
such as frost heaving or through soil or litter
deposition on and around plants (Hudson
1993), thus it is important to distinguish and
not include this type of pedestalling as an
indication of erosional processes.
Terracettes are benches of soil deposition
behind obstacles caused by water movement
(not wind). As the degree of soil movement by
water increases, terracettes become higher and
more numerous and the area of soil deposition
becomes larger. Terracettes caused by livestock
or wildlife movements on hillsides are not
considered erosional terracettes, thus they are
not assessed in this process. However, these ter-
racettes can increase erosion by concentrating
water flow and/or reducing infiltration. These
effects are recorded with the appropriate indi-
cators (e.g., water flow patterns, compaction
layer, and soil surface loss and degradation).

4. Bare Ground
Bare ground is exposed mineral or organic soil
that is susceptible to raindrop splash erosion,
the initial form of most water-related erosion
(Morgan 1986). It is the opposite of ground
cover, which is the percentage of ground sur-
face covered by vegetation, litter, standing dead
vegetation, gravel/rock, and visible biological
crust (e.g., lichen, mosses, algae), meaning
everything except bare ground (Weltz et al.
1998).
The amount and distribution of bare ground is
one of the most important contributors to site
stability relative to the site potential; therefore,
it is a direct indication of site susceptibility to
accelerated wind or water erosion (Smith and
Wischmeier 1962, Morgan 1986, Benkobi et al.
1993, Blackburn et al. 1994, Pierson et al. 1994,
Gutierrez and Hernandez 1996, Cerda 1999).
In general, a site with bare soil present in a few
large patches will be less stable than a site
with the same ground cover percentage in
which the bare soil is distributed in many small
patches, especially if these patches are
unconnected (Gould 1982, Spaeth et al. 1994,
Puigdefabregas and Sanchez 1996).
The determination of adequacy of ground
cover at the area of interest is made in a com-
parison with the ground cover information in
the rangeland ecological site description (if it
contains ground cover information) and/or at
the ecological reference area(s) (ERAs). The
Cover Worksheet (Appendix 3) is a good
source of information to compare bare ground
amounts between the site potential via the
ERA and the site being assessed.
The amount of bare ground can vary seasonally
depending on impacts on vegetation canopy
cover (e.g., herbivore utilization), and litter
amount (e.g., trampling loss), and annually rel-
ative to weather (e.g., drought, above average
precipitation) (Gutierrez and Hernandez 1996,
Anderson 1974). Current and past climate must
be considered in determining the adequacy of
current cover in protecting the site against the
potential for accelerated erosion.

5. Gullies
A gully is a channel that has been cut into the
soil by moving water. Gullies generally follow
the natural drainages and are caused by acceler-
ated water flow and the resulting downcutting
of soil. Gullies are a natural feature of some
landscapes, while on others management
actions (e.g., excessive grazing, recreation vehi-
cles, or road drainages) may cause gullies to
form or expand (Morgan 1986). Water flow is
concentrated but intermittent, with gully depth
1/2 meter or more in depth. Gullies can be
caused by resource problems offsite (document
this on the Rangeland Health Evaluation
Worksheet), but still affect the site function on
the area of interest.
Gullies may be assessed by observing the num-
bers of gullies in an area and/or assessing the
severity of erosion on individual gullies.
General signs of active erosion, (e.g., incised
sides along a gully) are indicative of a current
erosional problem, while a healing gully is char-
acterized by rounded banks, vegetation growing
in the bottom and on the sides (Anderson 1974),
and a reduction in gully depth (Martin and
Morton 1993). Active headcuts may be a sign of
accelerated erosion in a gully even if the rest of the
gully is showing signs of healing (Morgan 1986).

6. Wind-Scoured, Blowouts, and/or
Deposition Areas
Accelerated wind erosion on an otherwise
stable soil increases as the surface crust (i.e.,
either physical, chemical, or biological crust) is
worn by disturbance or abrasion. Physical crusts
are extremely important on many rangelands
with low canopy cover in protecting the soil
surface from wind erosion. The exposed soil
beneath these surface crusts are often weakly
consolidated and vulnerable to movement via
wind (Chepil and Woodruff 1963). As wind
velocity increases, soil particles begin bouncing
against each other in the saltation process. This
abrasion leads to suspension of fine particles
into the wind stream where they may be trans-
ported off the site (Chepil 1945, Gillette,
Blifford and Fenster 1972, Gillette, Blifford and
Fryrear 1974, Gillette and Walker 1977, Hagen
1984).
Areas of wind erosion within a vegetation
community are represented by wind-scoured or
blowout areas where the finer particles of the
topsoil have blown away, sometimes leaving
residual gravel, rock, or exposed roots on the
soil surface (Anderson 1974). They are generally
found in interspace areas, with a close correla-
tion between soil cover/bare patch size, soil
texture, and degree of accelerated erosion
(Morgan 1986).
Deposition of suspended soil particles is often
associated with vegetation that provides rough-
ness to slow the wind velocity and allow soil
particles to settle from the wind stream. The
taller the vegetation, the greater the deposition
rate (Pye 1987); thus, shrubs and trees in range-
land ecosystems are likely sinks for deposition
(e.g., mesquite dunes, Gibbens et al. 1983,
Hennessy 1983). The soil removed from
wind-scoured depressions is redistributed to
accumulation areas (e.g., eolian deposits) which
increase in size and area of coverage as the
degree of wind erosion increases (Anderson
1974).
Like water erosion, wind deposited soil parti-
cles can originate from offsite, but affect the
function of the site by modifying soil surface
texture (Hennessey et al. 1986, Morin and Van
Winkel 1996). The changes in texture will
influence the site’s hydrologic function. Even
when soil particles originate from offsite, they
can have detrimental effects on plants at the
deposition site.

7. Litter Movement
The degree and amount of litter (i.e., dead
plant material that is in contact with the soil
surface) movement (e.g., redistribution) is an
indicator of the degree of wind and/or water
erosion. The redistribution of litter within a
small area on a site is indicative of less erosion,
whereas the movement of litter offsite due to
wind or water is indicative of more severe ero-
sion. In a study in the Edwards Plateau in Texas,
litter accumulation was shown to be the
variable most closely correlated with interrill
erosion. The same study showed that litter of
bunchgrasses represented significant obstruc-
tions to runoff, thereby causing sediment trans-
port capacity to be reduced and a portion of the
sediment to be deposited (Thurow et al. 1988a).
The inherent capacity for litter movement on a
soil is a function of its slope and geomorphic
stability. For example, alluvial fans and flood-
plains are active surfaces over which water and
sediments are moved in response to major
storm events. The amount of litter movement
varies from large to small depending on the
amount of bare space typical of the plant
community and the intensity of the storm.
The size of litter moved by wind or water is also
an indicator of degree of litter redistribution. In
general, the greater distance that litter is moved
from its point of origin and the larger the size
and/or amount of litter moved, the more the
site is being influenced by erosional processes.

8. Soil Surface Resistance to
Erosion
This indicator assesses the resistance of the
surface of the soil to erosion. Resistance
depends on soil stability, microtopography, and
on the spatial variability in soil stability relative
to vegetation and microtopographic features.
The stability of the soil surface is key to this
indicator (Morgan 1986). Soil surfaces may be
stabilized by soil organic matter which has been
fully incorporated into aggregates at the soil
surface, adhesion of decomposing organic
matter to the soil surface, and biological crusts.
The presence of one or more of these factors is
a good indicator of soil surface resistance to
erosion (Blackburn et al. 1992; Pierson et al.
1994).
Where soil surface resistance is high, soil ero-
sion may be minimal even under rainfall
intensities of over 5 inches/hour, generating
high runoff rates on plots from which all
cover has been removed (Goff et al. 1993).
Conversely, the presence of highly erodible
materials at the soil surface can dramatically
increase soil erosion by water even when there
is high vegetative cover (Morgan et al. 1997)
and by wind when vegetative cover is removed
(Fryrear et al. 1994, Belnap and Gillette 1998).
In areas with low vegetative cover, the stability
of soil in the plant interspaces is more impor-
tant than stability under plants. Similarly,
where pedestals have formed along flow paths,
the soil at the edge of the pedestal will be
subjected to more intense forces during over-
land flow than soil which is topographically
above the flow path.
Another good indicator is the resistance of soil
surface fragments to breakdown when placed in
water. For a simple test, use the tip of a knife to
remove several small (maximum 1/4 inch diam-
eter x 1/8 inch deep) fragments from the soil
surface, from beneath plants, from interspaces,
and from any other areas which might differ in
soil stability. Place each in a separate bottlecap
filled with water. Fragments with low stability
will appear to lose their structure or “melt”
within 30 seconds. Fragments with extremely
low stability will “melt” immediately upon con-
tact with the water and the water will become
cloudy as the soil particles disperse. Fragments
with moderate stability will appear to retain
their integrity until the water in the bottlecap
is agitated or gently swirled. Highly stable
aggregates will retain their shape, even when
agitated indefinitely. For multiple samples, or
where more precision is desired, a simple soil
stability kit can be used to generate a rating
from one (unstable) to six (stable) (Herrick et
al. In Press) (Appendix 8). This indicator is
most highly correlated with water erosion
(Blackburn et al. 1994; Pierson et al. 1994).
Susceptibility to wind erosion also declines
with an increases in soil organic matter (Fryrear
et al. 1994).
Biological crusts consist of microorganisms
(e.g., lichens, algae, cyanobacteria, microfungi)
and non-vascular plants (e.g., mosses, lichens)
that grow on or just below the soil surface. Soil 
physical and chemical characteristics, along
with seasonal precipitation patterns, largely
determine the dominant organisms comprising
the crust.
Biological crusts are primarily important as
cover and in stabilizing soil surfaces (Bond and
Harris 1964; Belnap and Gardner 1993). In
some areas, depending on soil characteristics,
they may increase or reduce the infiltration of
water through the soil surface or enhance the
retention of soil water (i.e., acting as living
mulch). In general, the relative importance of
biological crusts increases as annual precipita-
tion and potential vascular plant cover decreas-
es. If information on biological crusts is lacking
in the ecological site descriptions, refer to the
ecological reference area (ERA) for baseline
information prior to conducting the evaluation.

Physical crusts are thin surface layers induced
by the impact of raindrops on bare soil causing
the soil surface to seal and absorb less water.
Physical crusts are more common on silty,
clayey, and loamy soils and relatively thin, if at
all present, in sandy soils. Physical and chemical
crusts tend to have very low organic matter
content, or contain only relatively inert organic
matter that is associated with relatively little
biological activity. As this physical crust
becomes more extensive, infiltration rates are
reduced and overland water flow increases.
Also, water can pond in flat crusted areas and is
more likely to evaporate than infiltrate into the
soil.
Physical soil crusts are identified by lifting the
soil surface with a pen or other sharp object
and looking for cohesive layers at the soil
surface which are not perforated by pores or
fissures and in which there is no apparent bind-
ing by visible strands of organic material, such
as cyanobacteria.
Physical crusts may exert a positive influence
on reducing wind erosion (see discussion in
Indicator 6, Wind-Scoured, Blowouts, and/or
Deposition Areas). However, their function in
stabilizing the soil surface against water erosion
is generally negative. Physical crusts also
include vesicular crusts which contain numer-
ous small air pockets or spaces similar to a
sponge; however, these soils are still resistant to
infiltration.
Chemical crusts rarely form in rangelands
except on soils formed from particular parent
materials (e.g., salt desert shrub communities–
see the soil survey that covers the area of
interest and/or the ERA) and in abandoned,
irrigated agricultural fields. Where they do
occur, they can reduce infiltration and increase
overland water flow similar to physical crusts.
They are usually identified by a white color on
the soil surface.
This indicator is not applicable to areas in
which there is no soil present at the surface
due to the presence of an extensive erosion
pavement (nearly 100 percent surface cover by
stones) or there is continuous open water (e.g.
marshes in the Southeast).

9. Soil Surface Loss or Degradation
The loss or degradation of part or all of the soil
surface layer or horizon is an indicator of a loss
in site potential (Dormaar and Willms 1998,
Davenport et al. 1998). In most sites, the soil at
and near the surface has the highest organic
matter and nutrient content.This generally controls
the maximum rate of water infiltration into the
soil and is essential for successful seedling
establishment (Wood et al. 1997). As erosion
increases, the potential for loss of soil surface
organic matter increases, resulting in further
degradation of soil structure. Historic soil ero-
sion may result in a complete loss of this layer
(Satterlund and Adams 1992, O’Hara et al. 1993).
In areas with limited slope, where wind erosion
does not occur, the soil may remain in place, but
all characteristics that distinguish the surface
from the subsurface layers are lost. Except in
soils with a clearly defined horizon immediately
below the surface (e.g., argillic), it is often
difficult to distinguish between the loss and
degradation of the soil surface. For the purposes
of this indicator, this distinction is unnecessary–
the objective is to determine to what extent the
functional characteristics of the surface layer
have been degraded. Note also that visible soil
erosion is covered in discussions of Indicator 3,
Pedestals and Terracettes, and subsurface
degradation in Indicator 11, Compaction Layer.
The two primary indicators used to make this
evaluation are the organic matter content
(Dormaar and Willms 1998) and structure
(Karlen and Stott 1994) of the surface layer
or horizon. Soil organic matter content is
frequently reflected in a darker color of the
soil, although high amounts of oxidized iron
(common in humid climates) can obscure the
organic matter. In arid soils where organic mat-
ter contents are low, this accumulation can be
quite faint. The use of a mister to wet the soil
profile can help make these layers more visible.
Soil structural degradation is reflected in the loss
of clearly defined structural units or aggregates at
one or more scales from <1/8 inch to 3-4 inches.
In soils with good structure, pores of various
sizes are visible within the aggregates.
Structural degradation is reflected in a more
massive, homogeneous surface horizon and is
associated with a reduction in infiltration rates
(Warren et al. 1986). Comparisons to intact soil
profiles at reference sites can also be used,
although in cases of severe degradation the
removal of part or all of the A horizon, or of
one or more textural components (e.g.,
Hennessey et al. 1986) may make identification
of appropriate reference areas difficult.

10. Plant Community Composition
and Distribution Relative to
Infiltration and Runoff
Vegetation growth form is an important deter-
minant of infiltration rate and interrill erosion
(Thurow et al. 1986, 1988a). The distribution
of the amount and type of vegetation has been
found to be an important factor controlling spa-
tial and temporal variations in infiltration and
interrill erosion rates on rangelands in Nevada
(Blackburn 1975, Blackburn and Wood 1990),
Idaho (Johnson and Gordon 1988, Blackburn et
al. 1990), and Texas (Wood and Blackburn
1984, Thurow at al. 1986, 1988a).
Changes in plant community composition and
the distribution of species can influence (posi-
tively or negatively) the ability of a site to
capture and store precipitation. Plant rooting
patterns, litter production and associated
decomposition processes, basal area and spatial
distribution can all affect infiltration and/or
runoff. In the Edwards Plateau in Texas, shifts in
plant composition between bunchgrass and
short grasses over time have the greatest
potential to influence infiltration and soil erosion
(Thurow et al. 1986, 1988a, b). An example of
a composition change that reduces infiltration
and increases water runoff is the conversion of
desert grasslands to shrub-dominated commu-
nities (Schlesinger et al. 1990). However,
infiltration and runoff are also affected when
sagebrush steppe rangeland is converted to a
monoculture of annual grasses. These annual
grasses provide excellent watershed protection
although snow entrapment and soil water
storage may be reduced by this vegetation type
conversion. Care must be exercised in inter-
preting this indicator in different ecosystems as
the same species may have different effects.

11. Compaction Layer
A compaction layer is a near surface layer of
dense soil caused by the repeated impact on or
disturbance of the soil surface. Compaction
becomes a problem when it begins to limit
plant growth (Wallace 1987), water infiltration
(Willat and Pullar 1983, Thurow et al. 1988a)
or nutrient cycling processes (Hassink et al.
1993). Farm machinery, herbivore trampling
(Willat and Pullar 1983, Warren et al. 1986,
Chanysk and Naeth 1995), recreational and
military vehicles (Webb and Wilshire 1983,
Thurow et al. 1988a), foot traffic (Cole 1985),
or any other activity that repeatedly causes an
impact on the soil surface can cause a com-
paction layer. Moist soil is more easily com-
pacted than dry or saturated soil (Hillel 1998).
Recovery processes (e.g., earthworm activity
and frost heaving) are generally sufficient to
limit compaction by livestock in many upland
systems (Thurow et al. 1988a).
A compaction layer is a structural change, not a
textural change, as described in a soil survey or
observed at an ecological reference area.
Compacted layers in rangelands are usually less
than 6 inches below the soil surface. They are
detected by digging a small hole (generally less
than 1-foot deep) with the determination of a
compaction layer (i.e., a soil structure change)
done by a person with soils experience. These
layers may be detected in some soils with the
use of a penetrometer (Larson and Pierce 1993)
or by simply probing the soil with a sharp rod
or shovel and “feeling” for the compaction layer
(Barnes et al. 1971). However, any potential
compaction layer should be confirmed using
multiple indicators, including direct observation
of physical features. Those physical features
include such things as platy or blocky, dense
soil structure over less dense soil layers and
horizontal root growth, and increased density
(measured by weighing a known volume of
oven-dry soil) (Blake and Hartge 1986).
Increased resistance to a probe can be simply
due to lower soil moisture or higher clay
content.

12. Functional/Structural Groups
This indicator addresses the various roles that
different species fulfill in energy flow and nutri-
ent cycles. Functional/structural groups are a
suite of species that because of similar shoot
(height and volume) or root (fibrous vs. tap)
structure, photosynthetic pathways, nitrogen
fixing ability, or life cycle are grouped together
on an ecological site basis (Chapin 1993,
Dawson and Chapin 1993, Solbrig et al. 1996).
Functional composition and functional diversity
are the principal factors explaining plant pro-
ductivity, plant percent nitrogen, plant total
nitrogen, and light penetration (Tilman et al.
1997). The study by Tilman et al. (1997)
showed that functional composition has a large
impact on ecosystem processes. This and related
studies have demonstrated that factors that
change ecosystem composition, such as inva-
sion by novel organisms, nitrogen deposition,
disturbance frequency, fragmentation, predator
decimation, species removal, and alternative
management practices can have a strong effect
on ecosystem processes.
The evaluator(s) must specify these groupings
on the Functional/Structural Groups Worksheet
(Appendix 5) after reviewing the ecological site
description and/or ecological reference area(s)
(ERAs). Each functional/structural group is
classified as:
• Dominant (roughly 41 -100% composition)
• Subdominant (roughly 11 - 40% composition)
• Minor component (roughly 3-10% composition)
• Trace component (<3% composition)
This is based upon the relative weight or
relative cover that each structural/functional
group collectively contributes to the total.
Composition by weight is the recommended
protocol to use for grouping species. If the eval-
uator(s) doesn’t have experience in estimating
composition by weight, then composition by
cover may be substituted. The potential for
functional/structural groups is derived by
placing species into the appropriate groups from
information found in the ecological site/
description, and/or at the ERA. This worksheet
can be modified by changing or adding func-
tional group categories at the top of the
form for different ecological sites (see Tables 3
and 4). Functional groups that are now present,
but were not original components of the site
(e.g., weeds, introduced plants), need to be
identified on the worksheet.
The number of species in each functional group
is also considered when selecting the appropri-
ate rating category on the Rangeland Health
Evaluation Summary Worksheet. If the number
of species in many of the functional/structural
plant groups have been greatly reduced, this
may be an indication of loss of biotic integrity.
Both the presence of functional groups and the

13. Plant Mortality/Decadence
The proportion of dead or decadent (e.g., mori-
bund, dying) to young or mature plants in the
community relative to that expected for the
site, under normal disturbance regimes, is an
indicator of the population dynamics of the
stand. If recruitment is not occurring and exist-
ing plants are either dying or dead, the integrity
of the stand would be expected to decline and
other undesirable plants (e.g., weeds or inva-
sives) may increase (Pyke 1995). A healthy
range has a mixture of many age classes of
plants relative to site potential and climatic
conditions (Stoddard, Smith, and Box 1975)
Only plants native to the site (or seeded plants
if in a seeding) are assessed for plant mortality.
Plant mortality may vary considerably on the
landscape depending on disturbance events
(e.g., fire, drought, insect infestation, disease).
The cover of standing dead vegetation from
the Cover Worksheet may be compared to
values found in the ecological site description
or on the ecological reference area to assist
in assessing the expected to actual plant
mortality.

14. Litter Amount
Litter is any dead plant material that is in con-
tact with the soil surface. That portion of the
litter component that is in contact with the soil
surface (as opposed to standing dead vegetation
which is not) provides a major source of the soil
organic material and the raw materials for
onsite nutrient cycling (Whitford 1988, 1996).
Litter also helps moderate the soil microclimate
and provides food for microorganisms (Hester
et al. 1997). The amount of litter present is also
a factor in enhancing the ability of the site to
resist erosion. Litter helps to dissipate the
energy of raindrops and overland flow, thereby
reducing the potential detachment and trans-
port of soil (Hester et al. 1997). Litter biomass
represents a significant obstruction to runoff
(Thurow et al. 1988a).
The amount of litter present is compared to the
amount that would be expected for the same
type of growing conditions under the historic
climax plant community or to that observed on
the ecological reference area. Litter is directly
related to weather and to the degree of utiliza-
tion of biomass each year. Therefore, climatic
influences (e.g., drought, wet years) must be
carefully considered in determining the rating
for the litter amount.
Some plant communities have increased litter
quantities relative to the site potential and
current weather conditions. In this case, litter
amount above what is expected results in
downgrading the rating for the site. Note in
the Comments Section for this indicator in
the Rangeland Health Evaluation Summary
Worksheet if the litter is undergoing decom-
position (darker color) or oxidation (whitish
color which may also be an indication of fungal
growth).

15. Annual Production
Aboveground biomass (i.e., annual production)
is an indicator of the energy captured by plants
and its availability for secondary consumers in
an ecosystem given current weather conditions.
Production potential will change with commu-
nities or ecological sites (Whittaker 1975),
biological diversity (Tilman and Downing
1994), and with latitude (Cooper 1975).
Annual production of the area of interest is
compared to the site potential from the range-
land ecological site description and/or the
ecological reference area(s).
Comparisons to the ecological site description
are based on peak above ground standing crop,
no matter when the site is assessed. If utiliza-
tion of vegetation has occurred, or plants are in
early stages of growth, the evaluator(s) should
estimate the production of the annual biomass
removed or expected and include this amount
when making the total site biomass estimate.
Do not include standing dead vegetation
(i.e., produced in previous years) as annual
production.
All species (e.g., native, seeded, and weeds) are
included in the determination of total above-
ground biomass if they were alive in the year
that the evaluation takes place. This indicator is
simply a measure of the total amount of vege-
tation available to harvest the sun’s energy at a
given point in time, therefore type of vegetation
(e.g., native or introduced) is not the issue. For
example, Rickard and Vaughan (1988) found
that conversion of a sagebrush steppe plant
community to an exotic annual grassland great-
ly affected vegetation structure and function
but not above-ground biomass production.
As with the other indicators, it is important to
consider all other local and landscape level
explanations for differences in production (e.g.,
runoff/run-on due to landscape position,
weather, regional location, or different soils
within an ecological site) before attributing
production differences to differences in other
site characteristics.

16. Invasive Plants
This indicator deals with plants that are inva-
sive to the area of interest. These plants may or
may not be noxious and may or may not be
exotic. Generally they are invaders or increasers
to the site that can, and often do, continue to
increase regardless of the management of the
site and may eventually dominate the site.
Invasives can include noxious plants (i.e., plants
that are listed by a state because of their
unfavorable economic or ecological impacts),
non-native, and native plants. Native invasive
plants (e.g., pinyon pine or juniper) must be
assessed by comparing current status with their
potential status described in the rangeland
ecological site description and/or observed in
the ecological reference area(s). Historical
accounts and photographs also provide infor-
mation on the historical distribution of invasive
native plants.
Invasive plants may impact an ecosystem’s type
and abundance of species, their interrelation-
ships, and the processes by which energy and
nutrients move through the ecosystem. These
impacts can influence both biological organisms
and physical properties of the site (Olson
1999). These impacts may range from slight to
catastrophic depending on the species involved
and their degree of dominance. Invasive species
may adversely affect a site by increased water
usage (e.g., salt cedar (tamarisk) in riparian
areas) or rapid nutrient depletion (e.g., high
nitrogen use by cheatgrass).
Some invasive plants (e.g., knapweeds) are
capable of invading undisturbed climax bunch-
grass communities (Lacey et al. 1990) further
emphasizing their use as an indicator of new
ecosystem stress. Even highly diverse, species-
rich plant communities are susceptible to exotic
species invasion (Stohlgren et al. 1999).

17. Reproductive Capability of
Perennial Plants
Adequate seed production is essential to main-
tain populations of plants when sexual repro-
duction is the primary mechanism of individual
plant replacement at a site; however, annual
seed production of perennial plants is highly
variable (Harper 1977). Since reproductive
growth occurs in a modular fashion similar to
the remainder of the plant (White 1979),
inflorescence production (e.g.,
seedstalks)
becomes a basic measure of reproductive
potential for sexually reproducing plants and
clonal production (e.g., tillers) for vegetatively
reproducing plants.
Comparing number of seedstalks and/or num-
ber of seeds per seedstalk of native or seeded
plants (not weeds or invasives) in the evaluation
area with that produced on the associated
ecological reference area (ERA) can be used to
assess seed production. Mueggler (1975) rec-
ommended comparison of seedstalk numbers
or culm length on grazed and ungrazed blue-
bunch wheatgrass plants as a measure of plant
recruitment potential. Seed production is
related to plant vigor since healthy plants are
better able to produce adequate quantities of
viable seed than are plants that are stressed or
decadent (Hanson and Stoddart 1940).
For plants that reproduce vegetatively, the
number and distribution of tillers or rhizomes
is assessed relative to the production of these
reproductive structures on perennial plants in
the ERA. Only native or seeded plants are eval-
uated with this indicator; invasive plants are not
included in the evaluation.
Recruitment is not assessed as a part of this
indicator since plant recruitment from seed is
an episodic event in many rangeland ecological
sites. Therefore,
evidence of recruitment
(seedlings or vegetative spread) of perennial,
native, or seeded plants is recorded in the com-
ment section of Indicator 17 on the Rangeland
Health Evaluation Summary Worksheet, but is
not considered in rating the reproductive
capabilities of perennial plants.

18. Optional Indicators
The 17 indicators described previously repre-
sent the baseline indicators that must be
assessed on all sites. Other indicators and
descriptors may be developed to meet local
needs. The only restriction on the development
of optional indicators and their use is that they
must be ecologically, not management related.
For example, an indicator of “Suitability for
Livestock Use” is not an appropriate indicator
to determine the health of a land unit. It may
be important in the allotment or ranch evalua-
tion, but it is not a part of the determination of
the status of soil/site stability, hydrologic
function, or integrity of the biotic community.
An example of an optional indicator and
descriptors for biological crust is provided in
Table 5.
The indicators included in the worksheets are
not intended to be all inclusive for all range-
lands. It is not expected that many of the
indicators would be eliminated given the
extensive field testing results; however, addi-
tional indicators may be added to the work-
sheets to improve the sensitivity of worksheets
in detecting changes in soil/site stability,
hydrologic function, and integrity of the biotic
community.

Step 6. Determine the
Functional Status of the
Three Rangeland Health
Attributes
Complete the Rangeland Health Evaluation
Summary Worksheet (Appendix 1).
The critical link between observations of indi-
cators and determining the degree of departure
from the ecological site description and/or
ecological reference area (ERA) for each health
attribute of an area of interest is the inter-
pretation process. The interpretation of the
indicators and the selection of the degree of
departure of the rangeland health attributes of:
soil/site stability, hydrologic function, and
integrity of the biotic community are made in
Part 3 of the Rangeland Health Evaluation
Summary Worksheet. This summary rating is
made by reviewing the indicator ratings and
comments on all of the worksheets to arrive at
a single degree of departure from the ecological
site description and/or ERA rating of each
attribute.
A “preponderance of evidence” approach is
used to determine which of the five departure
categories are selected as best fits by the evalu-
ator(s) for each attribute. This decision is based
in part on where the majority of the indicators
for each attribute fall under the five categories
at the top of the worksheet. For example, if
four of the soil/site stability indicators are in
the “extreme” and six are in the “moderate to
extreme” departure from the ecological site
description/ERA categories, the soil/site stabili-
ty attribute departure would be rated as “mod-
erate to extreme assuming that the evaluator(s)
interpretation of other information and local
ecological knowledge supported this rating.
More information (inventory and/or monitoring)
will generally be required if the preponderance
of evidence indicates that an attribute falls in
the “moderate departure” category. This infor-
mation should be reviewed if available or if not
available, it should be collected. The moderate
rating is somewhat analogous to an “at risk”
rating (NRC 1994). Therefore, these areas (i.e.,
moderate departure) are often good areas to
implement monitoring studies on since they
should be the most responsive to management
activities. However, additional monitoring may
be useful regardless of the departure rating,
dependent upon future changes in uses or
management of an area.
This procedure relies upon the collective expe-
rience and knowledge of the evaluator(s) to
classify each indicator and then to interpret the
collective rating for the indicators into one
summary rating of departure for each attribute.
The rating of each indicator and the interpreta-
tion into a collective rating for each attribute is
not apprentice level work. This procedure has
been developed for use by experienced, knowl-
edgeable evaluator(s). It is not intended that
this assessment procedure be used by new
and/or inexperienced or temporary type
employees without training and assistance by
more experienced and knowledgeable employees.

Application to Larger
Areas
Although the procedure described in this
document is based upon a site-specific area of
interest evaluation, it can be applied at a pas-
ture, allotment, or ranch level with the proper
study design.Tools to help with this application
to larger areas include topographic maps, water
locations, grazing use pattern maps, inventory
or monitoring information,
soil surveys,
Geographical Information System (GIS) tech-
nology, and local knowledge. Individual site
evaluations are made on selected rangeland
ecological sites, exercising caution that different
sites with different potentials are not assessed
using the same rangeland ecological site
description and/or ecological reference area.
Areas in the same rangeland ecological site with
the same ratings for the three rangeland health
attributes may be mapped and consolidated
within a pasture or management unit (e.g.,
ranch or allotment).
Additional studies or information may be
required to confirm these ratings or to catego-
rize the rangeland health attributes into
healthy, at risk, or unhealthy recommended by
the National Research Council (NRC 1994).
The protocol described in this document is not
intended to be used as a “stand-alone” tool to
determine the final “health” or functional status
of the three attributes of rangeland health.
Areas of interest with “moderate” to “extreme”
ratings may stimulate other actions (e.g., review
or initiation of inventory, monitoring, or different
assessments; communication with various groups
interested in the management of the area) to
then determine the cause of the problems or if
trend is satisfactory under existing management.
Changes in management are not appropriate
based solely on the evaluation of range health
per the procedures in this document.

Summary
Qualitative assessments of rangeland health
provide land managers and technical assistance
specialists with a good communication tool for
use with the public. This technique, in associa-
tion with quantitative monitoring and inventory
information, can be used to provide early
warnings of resource problems. This procedure
does not establish the cause of rangeland health
problems; it simply identifies where a problem
exists. This procedure is not intended nor
designed to replace quantitative monitoring,
serve as a trend study, or provide data that can
alone be aggregated for a national report on
rangeland health.
However, more research is needed to quantify
indicator attributes and identify thresholds for
rangeland health. Once this information is
available, the assessment of rangeland health
will become more quantitative and less reliant
on qualitative assessment of the indicators. As a
result of continued research and application of
this procedure, this document will continue to
be revised. Where possible, ecological site-
specific indicators and descriptors will be
developed. The interpretation of the indicators
will continue to evolve as our understanding of
ecological dynamics (e.g., as described in state
and transition diagrams) continues to grow. As
the concept of rangeland health continues to
evolve and mature, the application of this
concept and protocol will also evolve.

Glossary
Abundance: The total number of individuals of
a species in an area, population, or community
(SRM 1999).
Accelerated erosion: Erosion in excess of natu-
ral rates, usually as a result of anthropogenic
activities (SSSA 1997).
Age classes: The distribution of different ages
of the same species or group of species on a site.
Annual plant: A plant that completes its life
cycle and dies in one year or less (SRM 1999).
Annual production (syn. primary production):
The conversion of solar energy to chemical
energy through the process of photosynthesis. It
is represented by the total quantity of organic
material produced within a given period of
time (SRM 1999).
Area of interest: The area where the evaluation
of rangeland health attributes takes place.
Assessment: The process of estimating or judg-
ing the value or functional status of ecological
processes (e.g., rangeland health).
At risk: Rangelands that have a reversible loss
in productive capability and increased vulnera-
bility to irreversible degradation based upon an
evaluation of current conditions of the soil and
ecological processes (NRC 1994). At risk desig-
nation may point out the need for additional
information to better quantify the functional
status of an attribute.
Attribute: One of the three components,
soil/site stability, hydrologic function, and
integrity of the biotic community that collec-
tively define rangeland health.
Badland: A land type consisting of steep or very
steep barren land, usually broken by an intri-
cate maze of narrow ravines, sharp crests, and
pinnacles resulting from serious erosion of soft
geologic materials (SRM 1999).
Bare ground (bare soil): All land surface not
covered by vegetation, rock or litter (SRM
1999). As used in this document, visible
biological crusts and standing dead vegetation
are included in cover estimates as a type of
vegetation and therefore are not bare ground.
Basal area (plants): The cross-sectional area of
the stem or stems of a plant or of all plants in a
stand. Herbaceous and small woody plants are
measured at or near ground level; larger woody
plants are measured at breast or other designated
height. Syn. basal area. (SRM 1999).
Benchmark: A standard for an ecological site
that is used to compare functional status of
areas on the same ecological site.
Biological crust: Microorganisms (e.g., lichens,
algae, cyanobacteria, microfungi) and non-
vascular plants (e.g., mosses, lichens) that grow
on or just below the soil surface.
Biomass (plants): The total amount of living
plants above and below ground in an area at a
given time (SRM 1999).
Biotic integrity: Synonymous with “integrity of
the biotic community” (see definition).
Blowout: An excavation in areas of loose soil,
usually sand, produced by wind; a break-
through or rupture of a soil surface attributable
to hydraulic pressure, usually associated with
sand boils (SRM 1999).

Bunchgrass: A grass having the characteristic
growth habit of forming a bunch; lacking
stolons or rhizomes (SRM 1999).
Canopy cover: The percentage of the ground
covered by a vertical projection of the outer-
most perimeter of the natural spread of foliage
of plants. Small openings within the canopy are
included. It may exceed 100 percent. Syn.
crown cover. (SRM 1999).
Chemical soil crust: A soil-surface layer, rang-
ing in thickness from a few millimeters to a few
centimeters, that is formed when chemical
compounds become concentrated on the soil
surface. They can reduce infiltration and
increase overland water flow similar to physical
crusts. They are usually identified by a white
color on the soil surface.
Climate: The average or prevailing weather
conditions of a place over a period of years
(SRM 1999).
Climax plant community (e.g., climax): The
final or stable biotic community in a succes-
sional series; it is self-perpetuating and in
equilibrium with the physical habitat (SRM
1999).
Compaction layer: A near surface layer of
dense soil caused by the repeated impact on or
disturbance of the soil surface. When soil is
compacted, soil grains are rearranged to
decrease the void space and bring them into
closer contact with one another, thereby
increasing the bulk density (SSSA 1997).
Composition: The proportions of various plant
species in relation to the total on a given area;
it may be expressed in terms of cover, density,
weight, etc. Syn. species composition. (SRM
1999).
Cool-season plant: A plant which generally makes
the major portion of its growth during the late
fall, winter, and early spring. Cool season grasses
generally exhibit the C-3 photosynthetic
pathway. cf. warm-season plants (SRM 1999).
Cover: The plant or plant parts, living or dead,
on the surface of the ground. Vegetative cover
or herbage cover is composed of living plants
(including biological crusts), and the litter
cover of dead parts of plants (SRM 1999).
Decomposition: The biochemical breakdown
of organic matter into its original compounds
and nutrients.
Deposition area: An area offsite from where the
original soil erosion occurred that now has the
soil deposits from the original soil erosion area.
Descriptor: The narrative that describes the
indicator characteristics under each of the five
rating categories (Extreme,
Moderate to
Extreme, Moderate, Slight to Moderate, and
None to Slight) in the Rangeland Health
Indicator Evaluation Matrix. The “default
descriptor” is printed in the Matrix, while the
“revised descriptor” is completed by the evalua-
tors if the default descriptor does not fit the
characteristics of a particular indicator for a
particular ecological site.
Desired plant community: Of the several plant
communities that may occupy a site, the one
that has been identified through a management
plan to best meet the plan’s objectives for the
site. It must protect the site as a minimum
(SRM 1999).
Dominant species: Plant species or species
groups, which by means of their number, cov-
erage, or size, have considerable influence or
control upon the conditions of existence of
associated species (SRM 1999).
Ecological processes:
Ecological processes
include the water cycle (the capture, storage,
and redistribution of precipitation), energy flow
(conversion of sunlight to plant and animal
matter), and nutrient cycle (the cycle of nutrients
such as nitrogen and phosphorus through the
physical and biotic components of the environ-
ment). Ecological processes functioning within
a normal range of variation will support
specific plant and animal communities.

Ecological reference area: A landscape unit in
which ecological processes are functioning
within a normal range of variability and the
plant community has adequate resistance to
and resiliency from most disturbances. These
areas do not need to be pristine, historically
unused lands (e.g., climax plant communities or
relict areas).
Ecological site: A kind of land with specific
physical characteristics which differs from
other kinds of land in its ability to produce
distinctive kinds and amounts of vegetation and
in its response to management. Apparently syn-
onymous with ecological type used by USDA
Forest Service. Syn. rangeland ecological site.
(SRM 1999).
Ecological site description: Description of the
soils, uses, and potential of a kind of land with
specific physical characteristics to produce
distinctive kinds and amounts of vegetation.
Ecosystem: Organisms together with their
abiotic environment, forming an interacting
system, inhabiting an identifiable space (SRM
1999).
Energy flow: Conversion of sunlight to plant
and animal matter; one of the ecological
processes.
Erodibility: The degree or intensity of a soils
state or condition of, or susceptibility to, being
erodible (SSSA 1997).
Erosion: Detachment and movement of soil or
rock fragments by water, wind, ice, gravity; the
land surface worn away by running water, wind,
ice, or other geological agents, including such
processes as gravitational creep (SRM 1999).
Evaluation area: See definition of “area of
interest.”
Evaluator(s): The person or persons conducting
the evaluation of rangeland health on an area of
interest.
Exclosure: An area fenced to exclude animals
(SRM 1999).
Exotic plant: A plant that is not born, growing,
or produced naturally (native) in an area,
region, or country. Syn. non-indigenous plant.
(SRM 1999).
Flow pattern: The path that water takes (i.e.,
accumulates) as it moves across the soil surface
during overland flow.
Forb: Any broad-leafed, herbaceous plant other
than those in the Poaceae, Cyperaceae, and
Juncaceae families (SRM 1999).
Functional/structural groups: A suite or group
of species that because of similar shoot or root
structure, photosynthetic pathways, nitrogen
fixing ability, life cycle, etc. are grouped togeth-
er on an ecological site basis.
Functioning: Refers to the rangeland health
attributes where the majority (see definition of
“preponderance of evidence”) of the associated
indicators are functioning properly relative to
the ecological site description and/or ecological
reference area given the normal range of
variability associated with the site and climate.
Geomorphology: The science that studies the
evolution of the earth’s surface. The science of
landforms (SSSA 1997).
Grass: Members of the plant family Poaceae
(SRM 1999).
Ground cover: The percentage of material (e.g.,
litter, standing dead vegetation, gravel/rocks,
vegetation, and biological crust), excluding bare
soil, covering the land surface.
Gully: A furrow, channel, or miniature valley,
usually with steep sides through which water
commonly flows during and immediately after
rains or snow melt (SRM 1999). Small channels
eroded by concentrated water flow.

Headcut: Abrupt elevation drops in the channel
of a gully that accelerate erosion as it undercuts
the gully floor and migrates upstream.
Half-shrub: A perennial plant with a woody
base whose annually produced stems die each
year (SRM 1999).
Healthy rangelands: See definition of “range-
land health.”
Hydrologic function: The capacity of the site to
capture, store, and safely release water from
rainfall, run-on, and snowmelt (where rele-
vant), to resist a reduction in this capacity, and
to recover this capacity following degradation
(one of the three attributes of rangeland
health).
Increaser: For a given plant community, those
species that increase in amount as a result of a
specific abiotic/biotic influence or management
practice (SRM 1999).
Indicator: Components of a system whose
characteristics (e.g., presence or absence, quan-
tity, distribution) are used as an index of an
attribute (e.g., rangeland health) that are too
difficult, inconvenient, or expensive to measure.
Infiltration: The entry of water into the soil
(SSSA 1997).
Integrity of the Biotic Community: Capacity of
a site to support characteristic functional and
structural communities in the context of nor-
mal variability, to resist loss of this function and
structure due to a disturbance, and to recover
following such disturbance.
Interrill erosion: The removal of a fairly uni-
form layer of soil on a multitude of relatively
small areas by splash due to raindrop impact
and by sheet flow (SSSA 1997).
Invader: Plant species that were absent in
undisturbed portions of the original vegetation
of a specific range site and that will invade or
increase following disturbance or continued
heavy grazing (SRM 1999).
Invasive plant: Plants that are not part of
(exotic) or a minor component of (native) the
original plant community or communities that
increase above what’s expected given the
normal range of variability of a site.
Inventory (rangeland inventory): The system-
atic acquisition and analysis of resource infor-
mation needed for planning and management
of rangeland (SRM 1999).
Life form: Characteristic form or appearance of
a species at maturity (e.g., tree, shrub, herb)
(SRM 1999).
Litter: The uppermost layer of organic debris
on the soil surface, essentially the freshly fallen
or slightly decomposed vegetal material (SRM
1999). In this document, it includes persistent
and non-persistent organic matter that is in
contact with the soil surface.
Monitoring: The orderly collection, analysis,
and interpretation of resource data to evaluate
progress toward meeting management objec-
tives. The process must be conducted over time
in order to determine whether or not manage-
ment objectives are being met (SRM 1999).
Native invasive: A native plant that has
migrated to a site where it was not a part of the
original plant community, or a native plant that
because of management or other changes is
now increasing beyond its original composition
on the site.
Nitrogen fixation (fixers): The biological
reduction of molecular nitrogen to chemical
forms that can be used by organisms in the
synthesis of organic molecules.

munities and their environment that can be
expected given natural variability in climate
and disturbance regimes.
Noxious weed: Plant species declared noxious
by laws concerned with plants that are weedy
in cultivated crops and on the range.
Nutrient cycle: The cycle of nutrients such as
nitrogen and phosphorus through the physical
and biotic components of the environment; one
of the ecological processes.
Organic matter: Living plant tissue, and
decomposed or partially decomposed material
from living organisms.
Oxidation: The loss of one or more electrons by
an ion or molecule (SSSA 1997). Oxidation is
a chemical process of decomposition whereby
nutrients are released into the atmosphere
instead of into the soil. Oxidation commonly
increases as aridity increases.
Pedestal (erosional): Plants or rocks that
appear elevated as a result of soil loss by wind
or water erosion (does not include plant or rock
elevation as a result of non-erosional processes
such as frost heaving).
Perennial plant: A plant that has a life span of
3 or more years (USDA 1997).
Physical crust: Thin surface layers induced by
impact of raindrops on bare soil causing the soil
surface to seal and absorb less water.
Plant decadence: Plants that are old or deterio-
rating. In a plant community, decadence refers
to an overabundance of dead or dying plants
relative to what is expected for a site given the
natural range of variability in disease, climate,
and management influences.
Plant mortality: The death of a plant or in a
plant community the death of a number of
plants in the community.
Preponderance of evidence: The rating of an
attribute of rangeland health by observing
where the majority of indicators fall in respect
to the five categories that are used to rate each
indicator (SRM 1999).
Qualitative: Observational type data that is
recorded but not measured.
Quantitative: Collection of data by measuring
vegetation or soil characteristics.
Range condition: The present status of vegeta-
tion of a range site in relation to the climax
(natural potential) plant community for that
site. It is an expression of the relative degree to
which the kinds, proportions, and amounts of
plants in a plant community resemble that of
the climax plant community for the site (SRM
1999).
Rangeland: Land on which the indigenous veg-
etation (climax or natural potential) is predom-
inantly grasses, grass-like plants, forbs, or shrubs
and is managed as a natural ecosystem. If plants
are introduced, they are managed similarly.
Rangelands include natural grasslands, savannas,
shrublands,
many deserts,
tundra,
alpine
communities, marshes, and wet meadows (SRM
1999). The authors also include oak and
pinyon-juniper woodlands in this definition.
Rangeland health: The degree to which the
integrity of the soil, vegetation, water, and air, as
well as the ecological processes of the rangeland
ecosystem, are balanced and sustained. Integrity
is defined as maintenance of the structure and
functional attributes characteristic of a locale,
including normal variability (SRM 1999).
Recruitment: The successful entry of new
individuals into the breeding population.
Relict (area): A remnant or fragment of the
climax plant community that remains from
a former period when it was more widely
distributed. Syn. pristine. (SRM 1999).

Rhizomatous plant: A plant that reproduces by
rhizomes. Rhizomes are a horizontal under-
ground stem, usually sending out roots and
aboveground shoots from the nodes (SRM
1999).
Rill: A small, intermittent water course with
steep sides, usually only several centimeters
deep (SSSA 1997). Rills generally are linear
erosion features.
Runoff: The portion of precipitation or irriga-
tion on an area which does not infiltrate, but
instead is discharged by the area (SSSA 1997).
Saltation: A particular type of momentum-
dependent transport involving the rolling,
bouncing, or jumping action of soil particles 0.1
to 0.5 mm in diameter by wind, usually at a
height of <15 cm above the soil surface, for
relatively short distances; the rolling, bouncing
or jumping action of mineral grains, gravel,
stones, or soil aggregates affected by the energy
of following water; the bouncing or jumping
movement of material downslope in response
to gravity (SSSA 1997).
Shrub: A plant that has persistent, woody stems
and a relatively low-growth habit, and that gen-
erally produces several basal shoots instead of a
single bole. It differs from a tree by its low
stature (generally less than 5 meters, or 16 feet)
and non-arborescent form (SRM 1999).
Similarity index (rangeland): The present state
of vegetation and soil protection on an ecologi-
cal site in relation to the historic climax plant
community. Syn. range condition. (SRM 1999).
Soil aggregates: A group of primary soil parti-
cles that cohere to each other more strongly
than to other surrounding particles (SSSA
1997).
Soil association: A kind of map unit used in soil
surveys comprised of delineations, each of
which shows the size, shape, and location of a
landscape unit composed of two or more kinds
of component soils or component soils and mis-
cellaneous areas, plus allowable inclusions in
either case.The individual bodies of component
soils and miscellaneous areas are large enough
to be delineated at the scale of 1:24,000.
Several to numerous bodies of each kind of
component soil or miscellaneous area are apt to
occur in each delineation, and they occur in a
fairly repetitive and describable pattern (SSSA
1997).
Soil classification: The systematic arrangement
of soil units into groups or categories on the
basis of their characteristics. Broad groupings
are made on the basis of general characteristics
and subdiviions on the basis of more detailed
differences in specific properties (SSSA 1997).
Soil complex: A kind of map unit used in soil
surveys comprised of delineations, each of
which shows the size, shape, and location of a
landscape unit composed of two or more kinds
of component soils or component soils and a
miscellaneous area, plus allowable inclusions in
either case.The individual bodies of component
soils and miscellaneous areas are too small to be
delineated at the scale of 1:24,000. Several to
numerous bodies of each kind of component
soil or miscellaneous area are apt to occur in
each delineation (SSSA 1997).
Soil inclusions: One or more polypedons or
parts of polypedons within a delineation of a
map unit, not identified by the map unit name
(i.e., is not one of the named component soils
or named miscellaneous area components).
Such soils or areas are either too small to be
delineated separately without creating exces-
sive map or legend detail, occur too erratically
to be considered a component, or are not
identified by practical mapping methods
(SSSA 1997).

redistribution and loss of soil resources (includ-
ing nutrients and organic matter) by wind and
water (one of the three attributes of rangeland
health).
Soil structure: The combination or arrange-
ment of primary soil particles into secondary
units or peds. The secondary units are charac-
terized on the basis of size, shape, and grade
(degree of distinctiveness) (SSSA 1997).
Soil survey: The systematic examination,
description, classification, and mapping of soils
in an area. Soil surveys are classified according
to the kind and intensity of field examination
(SSSA 1997).
Species composition: The proportions of vari-
ous plant species in relation to the total on a
given area. It may be expressed in terms of
cover, density, weight, etc. (SRM 1999).
Stable state: A condition of an ecological site’s
characteristics; as characteristics change, there
is a transition to a new state (USDA 1997).
Standing dead vegetation: The total amount of
dead plant material, in aboveground parts, per
unit of space at a given time (USDA 1997).
This component includes all standing dead
vegetation produced in previous (not the
current) growing seasons not in contact with
the soil surface.
Structure (soils): The combination or arrange-
ment of primary soil particles into secondary
units or peds. The secondary units are charac-
terized on the basis of size, shape, and grade
(degree of distinctness) (SSSA 1997).
Structure (vegetation): The height and area
occupied by different plants or life forms in a
community.
Succulent: Generally a type of cactus.
Terracette: “Benches” of soil deposition behind
obstacles caused by water not wind erosion.
Threshold: A transition boundary that an
ecosystem crosses resulting in a new stable state
that is not easily reversed without significant
inputs of resources.
Tiller: A plant shoot that arises from the root or
base of a plant.
Transition: A shift in plant composition that
results in relatively stable states, as reflected in
composition and structure. These shifts can
occur by natural forces or as a result of human
actions.
Tree: A woody perennial, usually single-
stemmed plant that has a definite crown shape
and reaches a mature height of at least 4
meters. The distinction between woody plants
known as trees and those called shrubs is grad-
ual. Some plants, such as oaks (Quercus spp.),
may grow as either trees or shrubs (SRM 1999).
Trend: The direction of change in ecological
status or resource value rating observed over
time (SRM 1999).
Unhealthy rangelands: Rangelands on which
degradation has resulted in the loss of ecologi-
cal processes which function properly and the
capacity to provide values and commodities to
a degree that external inputs are required to
restore the health of the land (NRC 1994).
Vascular plants: Higher plants with vessels that
conduct sap throughout the plant.
Vesicular crust: A type of physical crust which
contains numerous small air pockets or spaces
similar to a sponge causing a reduction in
infiltration.
Viable seed: Wildland plant seed that is capable
of germination given appropriate environmental
conditions.

Warm season plant: A plant which makes most
or all its growth during the spring, summer, and
fall and is usually dormant in winter; a plant
that exhibits the C-4 photosynthetic pathway
(SRM 1999).
Water cycle (e.g., hydrologic cycle): The cap-
ture, storage, and redistribution of precipitation.
Weather: The current state of the atmosphere
with regards to wind, temperature, cloudiness,
moisture, pressure, etc.
Well-managed rangelands: Rangelands that
have properly functioning ecological processes,
biotic integrity, and soil stability associated with
human uses of the land.
Wind-scoured area: Areas, generally in inter-
spaces, where the finer soil particles have blown
away sometimes leaving residual gravel, rock, or
exposed roots on the soil surface.

Interspaces are showing loss of stability.
Signs of past losses, minimal signs of current losses.
Less sagebrush than expected for site which would slightly reduce snow accumulation and therefore soil water recharge.
Compaction layer common in shrub interspaces.
Cheatgrass is the dominant understory species with expected native herbaceous species considerably reduced.
Native perennial herbaceous plants are dead or decadent with little reproduction occurring due to cheatgrass competition.
Above what is expected due to cheatgrass dominance in the understory.
Cheatgrass production is poor due to dry spring.
Cheatgrass is a dominant with rush skeletonweed and halogeton locally common.
Perennial plants (except sagebrush) have very few seedheads. Rhizomatous grasses (western wheatgrass) have moderate rhizome.

TR-1734-6 - Interpreting Indicators of Rangeland Health - Version 3

This technical reference describes a new qualitative assessment protocol to be used for interpreting indicators of range-
land health. Use of the reference will allow for more consistent interpretations of rangeland health indicators, thus
making assessment results more comparable. The procedure has been developed for use by experienced, knowledgeable
land managers as it requires a good understanding of ecological processes, vegetation, and soils for each of the sites to
which it is applied. If used by knowledgeable and experienced people, they will be able to make rapid and preliminary
evaluations of soil and site stability, hydrologic function, and biotic integrity on rangelands. Land managers should not
use this technique for monitoring.
The procedure requires that evaluators rate 17 indicators to assess three attributes (soil/site stability, hydrologic function,
and biotic integrity) for a given location. The six steps to complete the procedure are as follows: 1) determine the soil
series and ecological site for the evaluation area, 2) visit ecological reference areas, verify soil series, characterize canopy
cover, ground cover, dominance and soil surface characteristics, and rate the status of the indicators, 3) accept or modify
rating criteria for each indicator, 4) return to the evaluation area and characterize the site using estimates of canopy
cover, ground cover, and dominance, 5) rate each indicator relative to its degree of departure from the ecological site
description or the reference area, and 6) rate the site for the three attributes based on the preponderance of evidence
from the relevant indicators.
