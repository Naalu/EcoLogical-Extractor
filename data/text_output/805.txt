THE SUITABILITY OF VARIOUS MARKETS FOR USING SMALL 
DIAMETER PONDEROSA PINE TO SUSTAIN FOREST HEALTH AND 
FIRE-RISK REDUCTION PROGRAMS IN NORTHERN ARIZONA

INTRODUCTION 
 
The restoration of forests to healthy conditions while reducing fire risks requires a combined 
approach of thinning overstocked small diameter trees and the reintroduction of surface fires.  
The critical component of thinning, however, is expensive and generates large volumes of woody 
fiber that cannot be left in the forests because of fire, insect, and disease reasons.  Projects within 
the ponderosa pine dominated urban-wildland interface of Coconino County in northern Arizona 
show that thinning involves the cutting and processing of (Larson and Mirth, 1999, Larson, et al, 
2001):  
 
• Nearly 100% of the 4”dbh and smaller trees; resulting in the cutting of over 800 trees per 
acre on those units that have never been thinned to as few as 60 trees per acre on previously 
thinned units.  
• 90% to 100% of the trees in the 5” to less 9” dbh class; resulting in the cutting and removal 
of 55 to 200 trees per acre.  
• 50% to 80% of the trees in the 9” to less than 16” dbh class; resulting in the cutting and 
removal of 50 to over 100 trees per acre.  
 
Estimates suggest that the recoverable merchantable wood fiber range from 5.5 ccf/acre (Larson 
and Mirth, 1998) to 17.7 ccf/acre (Larson and Mirth 1999) depending upon stand conditions and 
prescription.  If thinned, the greater Flagstaff, AZ fire risk zone of approximately 94,000 acres 
(GCFP, unknown-a) could yield between 24,816 to 99,828 truckloads1 of logs.  
 
This by-product (small diameter trees) of forest health and fire risk reduction programs could be 
used to defray the costs of treatment if suitable markets existed for this fiber.   
The current state of the wood-based industry in northern Arizona, however, is one that is nearly 
extinct.  In 1986, there were three sawmills operating in Coconino County and over twelve 
logging companies with a combined employment of over 530 (County Business Patterns, 1988).  
By 1996, the sawmills had disappeared and only two logging companies remained. Wood sector 
employment dropped to 50 (County Business Patterns, 1996).  
 
 
1 This assumes that only 60% of the risk zone is treated and a truck load of logs is about 10 ccf. The remaining 40% 
is not thinned because of a variety of issues like wildlife corridors or endangered species habitat.

The implications of this limited industrial base to the future of regional forest health and fire-risk 
reduction programs are economically daunting as exemplified by the recent activities of the 
Grand Canyon Forests Partnership (GCFP).  The GCFP is an alliance of fifteen environmental, 
business, and governmental organizations in Flagstaff, Arizona.  The GCFP is dedicated to 
restoring forest health, to managing forest fuels to reduce the threat of catastrophic fire in the 
urban wildland interface, and to assessing the ecological, economic, and social dimensions of 
forest restoration efforts (GCFP, unknown-b).   
 
Their first project, a research and demonstration project that was divided into three contracts, 
was started in the Fall of 1999.  The project dragged on much longer than anticipated, because of 
the difficulty in finding suitable markets for the merchantable logs, as well as an overabundance 
of non-merchantable trees.  It was necessary to renegotiate the pre-commercial phase of one 
contract that represented three units of few available merchantable trees and 500 to 800 trees per 
acre of less than 5” dbh trees. In addition, the GCFP found it necessary to work as a middleman 
to facilitate the moving of logs, at cost, to a new post and pole operation. Based upon contract 
information alone, it is estimated that GCFP lost about $5,000 on this 332-acre project.  This 
estimate does not include any administrative costs the GCFP or Forest Service incurred. In 
addition to the economic losses, the GCFP received negative publicity from sources such as the 
Southwest Forest Alliance (SWFA, unkown) who perceived the project as merely a pretext for 
commercial logging.   
 
Their second project, located adjacent to the first within the Fort Valley 10K area, consisted of 
three approximate 100-acre units with three different forest-health based prescriptions (Larson, et 
al, 2001).  The entire project was awarded to one logger on May 8, 2001 to hand-fell.  The 
contract reflected the logger’s previous experience with this type of project and the continued 
lack of suitable fiber markets. It will cost the GCFP $45,000 (or approximately $200 per treated 
acre) to complete.  
 
Without suitable markets, the ability of the GCFP or other entities like the Forest Service to 
continue funding thinning projects at the rate of $200/acre plus administrative costs will be 
quickly limited.  
 
The work of Lynch, et al (2000) in the ponderosa pine dominated forests of the San Jaun 
National Forest in Colorado, however, suggest that forest restoration projects can achieve 
ecological objectives and pay for themselves if:  
 
• suitable markets exits,  
• the treatments are carefully planned, and  
• the costs of harvesting and transportation are controlled.  
 
What then are suitable markets for small diameter ponderosa pine thinned from the forests of 
northern Arizona?  This question is particularly relevant to a region that is starting anew in trying 
to develop a wood conversion capacity that can contribute to the program of sustaining forest 
health and fire-risk reduction programs through the manufacture and sale of wood-based 
products.

Answers to this question are provided here via the use of a structured analysis process known as 
the decision matrix.  
DECISION MATRIX METHODOLOGY 
 
The decision matrix methodology is a rational multi-attribute decision-making technique similar 
to the Kepner-Tregoe method (Kepner and Tregoe, 1965), but expressed in matrix form (Ulrich 
and Eppinger, 2000).  It is particularly useful during the early stages of problem solving where 
details are impossible to fully predict, but it is still necessary to converge and select a solution 
(Pugh, 1995).  
 
This methodology involves the evaluation of alternative solutions, in this case wood fiber uses 
and products.  Each use is numerically evaluated by comparing its performance in a number of 
categories to a benchmark product. Upon completion of the numerical evaluation, a total score is 
tallied for each use.  This score provides an objective rating of how suitable the fiber use may be 
in sustaining forest health and fire risk reduction programs in northern Arizona.  
 
The successful use of this decision method hinges upon the initial work of setting up the matrix.  
This initial work includes:  
 
1. Generate a comprehensive list (or space) of all possible wood uses. 
2. Reduce the space of possible solutions to a smaller, more realistic set of alternatives for 
analysis.  
3. Establish the criteria by which the uses will be evaluated against.  
4. Assign criteria weighting factors to reflect the relative importance of each criterion.  
5. Select a benchmark use.  
 
The Space of Possible Wood Uses 
 
In classic decision-making, the identification of the space of all possible solutions can be time 
consuming and would consist of searching the literature, interviewing lead users, consulting with 
experts, examining related products, and searching patents. Luckily, for our problem this work 
has already been completed.  Dramm (1999) has compiled the space of existing technologies for 
using small diameter wood, which is repeated here as Figure 1.  This figure organizes product 
opportunities as a function of processing and log quality.   Primary breakdown mills are found at 
the top, secondary manufacturing at the bottom.  Products that require high value logs are located 
to the left, whereas products that can make use of lower value logs are at the right side of the 
figure.  Value in this case is interpreted as logs that are larger in size and contain fewer defects.  
Reduce the Space of Possible Solutions 
 
Figure 1 represents over thirty-two potential products and product combinations. A detail 
evaluation of all of these possibilities would be daunting with results that would be hard to 
synthesize due to size.  The second step then in setting up the decision matrix is to reduce the 
space to smaller number of viable product alternatives suitable to the conditions of northern 

Arizona and the small diameter ponderosa pine resource.  Two guiding principles were used to 
screen the various uses; yielding a smaller number of truly viable alternatives.  
 
 
Figure 1.  Potential Products for Small-Diameter Utilization (Dramm, 1999) 
The two guiding principles were:  
 
1. The projected size of a northern Arizona based forest health and fire-risk reduction program 
is large2. Given this, it was felt that only those industries that could convert, on a sustained 
basis, large volumes of wood from small diameter trees should be considered.  Small-
volume, independent users were not considered, because they would not be able to sustain, 
on the basis of input volume, a restoration program of any significant level.   
2.   Those uses that represented primary manufacturing approaches were considered over 
secondary products. Secondary products are manufactured from one or more primary 
products. Examples include wood boxes, kitchen cabinets, wood I-joists composed of 
structural panels, or laminated veneer lumber.  Secondary products are not feasible if the 
primary materials are not readily available. In addition, the location of secondary products 
manufacturing is a key factor in determining market success. Proximity to market is more

2 Earlier work (Larson and Mirth, 1998) suggested that there are over 600,000 acres in the Coconino National Forest 
alone that may need some treatment with the potential of generating 2.5 million ccf of fiber from 5” to 12” dbh tree 
class.

important than proximity to raw material (Polzin, 1994).  Market research shows limited 
opportunities for “value-added” wood products in rural areas (Irland Group, 1991) like that 
of northern Arizona. 
 
Upon application of these two guiding principles, seven products, listed in Table 1, were deemed 
suitable for further analysis.

Northern Arizona 
 
Evaluation Criteria 
Critical to the success of the decision matrix process is the choice of evaluation criteria.  This 
criteria reflects the requirements and constraints that possible solutions must meet. Evaluation 
criteria at this stage of decision making are at a relatively high level of abstraction, but are 
distinct enough to differentiate between fiber uses.  The criteria chosen for this analysis are 
provided below.   
 
Criterion 1.  Initial Costs and Flexibility  
 
The required initial capital investment in a manufacturing infrastructure provides an indication of 
the risk of establishing such a facility in northern Arizona. Of particular concern is the 
uncertainty of a sustainable supply of wood fiber from potential thinning projects.  Project 
initiation and future planning in the region are at low levels as exemplified by the Coconino 
National Forest’s 2000 and 2001 project planning. Its been estimated that the planned projects, if 
implemented, could yield an average of 44,719 ccf/year of pulp and saw logs (Mater, 2001). But, 
this is only a fraction of the fiber required to supply, on a yearly basis, a modern manufacturing 
facility like an OSB plant. Because of this, those manufacturers with that can start at a smaller 
scale, reflected by lower initial capital investment, and can grow and add infrastructure as supply 
improves will get higher ratings in this criterion. 
 
Criterion 2.  Discharge 
 
This is a qualitative evaluation of the manufacturing process relative to the type and amount of 
waste products generated and the accompanying discharge procedures.   Those technologies that 
either produce little waste or are able to mitigate the impacts of the discharge are rated higher.

Criterion 3. Water Usage 
 
Water conservation is an important component sustaining the populations and industries of the 
arid Southwest.  Those industries with less water requirements will have an easier time becoming 
established and sustaining their operations.  They shall be rated higher for this criterion.  
 
Criterion 4. Wood Material Properties 
 
This criterion assesses the compatibility of material characteristics to the technical demands of 
the various uses. This assessment, however, only addresses wood coming from the currently 
merchantable size classes of trees 5” dbh and larger. Those manufacturing processes that can 
effectively make use of large quantities of small diameter material shall be rated higher.  
 
Small-diameter, slow-growing ponderosa pine trees that exist in crowded stands is a resource 
that presents manufacturing and use obstacles. This wood, is called black jack pine because of its 
black bark, is different in many ways from the mature ponderosa pine resource, characterized by 
its yellow to orange bark.  It is so different that Fahey and Sachet (1993) suggest treating it as a 
resource separate from mature yellow ponderosa pine. The one characteristic of black jack pine 
that is so troublesome is the occurrence of juvenile wood.  
  
Juvenile wood is wood formed by cambial regions influenced by the activity in the apical 
meristem (the crown of the tree) (Rendle, 1960).  It is generally located within the inner portions 
of the stem cross-section.  It is not readily identifiable through casual means and there is no sharp 
demarcation between juvenile and mature wood.    Juvenile wood cells are shorter than those of 
mature wood.  In addition, the microfibril angle in the S-2 part of the secondary cell wall is 
characteristically greater in juvenile wood (Haygreen and Bowyer, 1996).  These characteristics 
of juvenile wood translate into a variety of product related problems, regardless of species.  
These problems include:    
 
• Warping of lumber and veneer products. Juvenile wood tends to shrink as much as three 
times more than mature wood (McAlister and Clark, 1992) in the longitudinal direction.  A 
product that contains both mature and juvenile wood can experience, during uncontrolled 
drying, differential shrinkage along the grain that results in warping.   
• A reduction in lumber grade yields.  Juvenile wood is often lower in density and strength 
than that of mature wood (Bendtsen, 1978, Senft et al, 1985, Senft et al, 1986, and McAlister 
and Clark, 1991) that is reflected in grade downfall.  
• Low kraft pulp yields.  Juvenile wood contains higher lignin and hemicellulose content and 
lower cellulose content (Haygreen and Bowyer, 1996) that can lead to reduced kraft pulp 
yields. 
• In-service moisture problems.  Composite board products manufactured from wood with a 
large percentage of juvenile exhibit greater thickness swelling and linear expansion (Pugel, et 
al, 1989 and 1990).  
 
Unfortunately, very little is known about the extent and nature of juvenile wood in the black jack 
ponderosa pine resource of northern Arizona. Voorhies and Groman (1982) examined the 
relationship between longitudinal shrinkage and rings from the pith from ponderosa pine logs in 

 
 
 
 
7 
 
 
 
the 6 to 11 inch scaling diameter classes taken from northern Arizona.  This study suggested that 
at about 20 rings from the pith, the percent longitudinal shrinkage settles down to and remains at 
about .2%;  a shrinkage value normally expected for mature ponderosa pine.  In an earlier study, 
however, Voorhies and Jameson (1969) concluded that the age of maturation for ponderosa pine 
based upon both fiber length and fibril angle is about 50 years.   Some additional data recently 
collected (Mirth and Larson, 2000) gives an indication of the extent of juvenile-type wood. One 
hundred and twenty ponderosa pine logs ranging in size from 3.5” to 8.22” dib were taken from 
the forests around Flagstaff, AZ and were examined. The first 20-year portion of the log cross 
section was found to make up, on the average, 58% of the small end cross-section.  
 
Criteria 5, 6, 7, and 8. Size Suitability 
 
These criteria assess the suitability of the woody material, grouped according to four size classes, 
relative to product and manufacturing needs.  This assessment accounts for log or chip properties 
and qualities like vs. manufacturing limitations. The four size classes corresponding to each 
criterion are:  
 
• Slash, B&N:  Slash is branches and tree tops.  B&N refers to bark and needles separate from 
woody component of slash.  
• 3” ≤ tree dbh < 5”:  This category of wood is often called biomass.  It is measured in tons of 
green logs or bone dry units in a clean chip form.  
• 5" ≤ tree dbh < 9”:  Logs from these trees are often referred to as pulpwood and quantified in 
units of 100 cubic feet (ccf), chords, or green tons.  These logs are cut to a top measuring 4” 
or 5” inside bark diameter (dib).    
• 9” ≤ tree dbh < 12”:  Merchantable logs coming from these trees are often referred to as saw 
logs and are quantified in units of ccf or 1000 board feet (Mbf). Logs from the smaller trees 
in this class are often bucked to a 5” dib top and the larger trees to a 6” dib top. The 12” 
limitation represents the regional definition of small diameter in response to market 
conditions. The local operators are able to readily find markets for logs taken from trees 
larger than 12” dbh.   
 
Those manufacturing processes that can readily use material within the various size classes are 
rated higher.  
 
When working with trees and logs, it useful to know the size of the merchantable log that can be 
obtained from a tree.  The following table, Table 2, provides an estimate of log potential for 
small diameter ponderosa pine trees based upon standing tree dbh.  These estimates are based 
upon a 20% bark thickness at the butt, a 12 inch stump, and a stem taper inside bark of .15 inches 
per foot of stem.  Each tree will differ some from these log estimates.   
 
Criterion 9. Revenue Potential  
 
This criterion is evaluates the product’s revenue potential using the most currently available data.

Criterion 10. Jobs 
 
Northern Arizona’s rural economy is a weak one that is highly dependent upon the few sectors of 
tourism, government (forest service, state and county), and education (NAU). It looks to 
diversify its economic base through industries that can provide long-term, good paying jobs. 
Those industries that can directly provide these types of jobs are rated higher in this criterion. No 
attempt was made to evaluate the influence a particular option might have on secondary job 
growth. 
 
Criterion 11.  Market Outlook  
 
This criterion evaluates the product’s potential in the market by examining demand and supply 
projections over both the short and long term. Higher ratings mean that the product has good 
market potential that suggests a reasonable return on the initial investment.    
 
Weighting of Criteria 
 
Weighting factors are assigned to the criteria to reflect the relative importance of the various 
criteria.  These weighting factors, based upon 100 percentage points, are shown in column three 
of Table 3 and reflect the authors’ interpretation of the importance of each criteria to the context 
of northern Arizona.  Additional weight is given to: criterion 1 initial facility costs, criterion 4 
wood fiber material properties, criterion 7 suitability of wood from 5” to less than 9” dbh trees, 
criterion 9 revenue potential, and criterion 11 market outlook.    
 
Benchmark Use: Orientated Strand Board 
Another important aspect to setting-up the decision matrix is the selection of an appropriate 
benchmark product from which all other uses are compared.  In this study the authors chose 
orientated strand board, OSB, as the benchmark because:   
 
1. It is a well-understood technology.  
2. The production process and economics are well documented.  
3. It is a product that is well suited to effectively utilize ponderosa pine wood fiber.

Oriented strandboard is a structural panel product manufactured from three to five layers wood 
strands compressed and bonded with phenol formaldehyde resins.  The strands of each layer are 
oriented to lie in one direction, and each layer is laid perpendicular to the adjacent layer to 
produce a cross-laminated product. OSB is primarily used for roof, floor, and wall structural 
sheathing applications in light-frame construction.  
 
Criterion 1. Initial Costs and Growth Flexibility 
 
To take advantage of economies of scale, OSB plants have become large manufacturing facilities 
growing in size from output capacities of 100 to 160 x 106 ft2/year (3/8” basis) to more than 400 
x 106 ft2.  Spelter, et al (1996) estimated that the initial capital costs for a OSB facility with a 300 
x 106 ft2 production capacity was $70,000,000.  This estimate included land, engineering, site 
preparation, buildings, equipment, installation, and start-up capital. 
 
Criterion 2.  Discharge from an OSB Manufacturing Plant 
 
The production of OSB is a relatively benign process.  Emissions, such as volatile organic 
compounds and chemical emissions from the respective drying and pressing operations are easily 
controlled with air scrubbing equipment.  However, some wastewater from the emissions stack is 
produced.  
 
Criterion 3 - Water Usage During Manufacturing   
 
Water usage is small with daily draws in the neighborhood of 500 gal/day for the control of stack 
emissions and to cool the cutter disks (Bullock, 1996).  Those plants that precondition logs prior 
to debarking and flaking require a one-time large water use to fill the hot ponds; occasional water 
is added to these ponds due to losses through log absorption, evaporation, and leaking.  It is 
believed that any new facility located in or near northern Arizona would need soaking ponds.   
 
Criteria 4 - Input Fiber Material Requirements for the Manufacture of OSB 
 
Since current economic strategies encourage the building of large-scale facilities, a larger 
capacity plant with a yearly production of 300 x 106 ft2 of 3/8” thick board is assumed here.  It 
has been reported that the manufacture of 1 ft3 of board requires between 1.8 to 2.0 ft3 of wood 
in the form of pulpwood size logs (Spelter, 1996).  Assuming 4” and 5” logs, a facility of this 
size would require about 17 x 106 ft3 of input wood fiber per year.   If each thinned acre generates 
approximately 700 ft3 of fiber in the 6” to 12” dbh grouping then the thinning of approximately 
24,000 acres/year will supply enough fiber to sustain a large OSB facility.   
 
The most important characteristic of a species that affects its suitability for OSB manufacture is 
its specific gravity (Haygreen and Bowyer, 1996).  As a general rule, lower density species are 
preferred for two reasons.  One, the lower the wood density, the higher the board strength at any 
given board density.  Two, low density wood reduces  through-the-mat density variability.  The 
traditional species of choice for OSB is aspen with a specific gravity (based on oven dry weight 
and green volume) of .35 (FPL, 1999).  Ponderosa pine, however, may be fall into the suitable 
range of species for OSB production with its specific gravity of .38.  Recently, the GCFP 

 
 
 
 
10 
 
 
 
conducted an undocumented trial run of small diameter ponderosa pine logs for OSB at the 
Louisiana-Pacific (L-P) Corporation’s Montrose, Colorado manufacturing plant that normally 
utilizes 100% hardwood species.  The results of this test were favorable; prompting visits to 
Flagstaff by L-P personal to scout out log supplies and transportation options. Nothing more 
beyond these initial inquiries have developed, however, due to expensive transportation costs - 
Montrose is over 400 miles away by truck from Flagstaff - and declining OSB prices.  
  
Criteria 5, 6, 7 and 8 – Size Class Suitability for OSB   
 
In order to control strand quality, which impacts panel strength and dimensional stability, the 
entire process of turning round logs into strands is handled on-site. Thus, the incoming raw 
material is in the form of green round logs.  The suitability of each size class to OSB is as 
follows: 
 
• Slash, Bark and Needles: Not used in the manufacture of OSB.  
• 3” ≤ dbh < 5”: Logs from this size class of trees are too small for effective handling and 
processing. 
•  5" ≤ dbh < 9”: Logs from this class of tree sizes are commonly used in the production of 
OSB strands.  
• 9” ≤ dbh < 12”:  Although logs from this class of tree can be used in the production of OSB 
flakes, they could be put to a higher value use such as appearance grade boards if the 
capacity existed. 
 
Criterion 9.  Revenue Potential for OSB 
A 1996 analysis of published OSB information (Spelter, 1996, Spelter, et al, 1996) reveals the 
following plant cost information.  Cost to manufacture, including capital depreciation and input 
fiber costs, was projected to be $4.55/ft3 of finished OSB produced at a 300 x 106 ft2 facility. Of 
this, wood fiber costs accounted for 32%; equivalent to $1.04/ft3 on an incoming wood basis, 
with an average fiber to product recovery of 71%.  The projected net revenue varies as a function 
of the volatile OSB panel market as discussed in more detail below in criterion 11.  Using a 
range of prices for 3/8” board from $ 160 to $220 per thousand square feet, revenue could range 
from $.57 to $2.49 per cubic foot of finished product.   
 
Criterion 10. Job Creation Directly Due to an OSB Facility 
 
Spelter, et al (1996) estimate that the 300 x 106 ft2 3/8” board plant would generate 
approximately 130 manufacturing-related jobs.  
 
Criterion 11. Market Outlook 
 
Demand 
 
Like most wood products, structural panel demand is tightly linked to the construction market, 
and in particular, residential construction.  It has been estimated that housing starts in the U.S. 
will average 2.0 million per year over the next fifty years, a gain of 200,000 starts over the 

 
 
 
 
11 
 
 
 
previous forty-year average. In addition, the size of these new units will continue to increase.  
Single family units will grow from a current average size of 2160 ft2 to 2600 ft2 by 2050 
(Haynes, 2001). 
 
Of this market, OSB will continue to gain ground at the expense of softwood plywood.  The use 
of OSB per square foot of floor area in new housing will rise until about 2010.  OSB 
consumption growth after 2010 will be derived primarily from residential upkeep and 
improvement and other applications found in shipping and manufacturing.  The consumption of 
OSB/waferboard in 1996 on a 3/8” basis was 13.6 billion ft2 vs. the 18 billion ft2 of softwood 
plywood.  It is projected that OSB/waferboard consumption will increase to 24.6 billion ft2 by 
2010, whereas softwood plywood is expected to decline to 11.4 billion ft2 (Haynes, 2001).  
 
In 1996, the U.S. OSB production equaled 9.3 billion ft2.  Imported board, primarily from 
Canada, met the remaining demand of 4.3 billion ft2.  U.S. OSB production capacity is projected 
to grow to 14.3 billion ft2 by 2010, while board imports grows to 10.3 billion ft2 (Haynes, 2001).  
 
Price 
 
The short-term market price for OSB depends strongly on production capacity. In the mid-1990s, 
twenty new plants producing about 8 billion ft2 of board came on line.  In response, panel prices 
plunged to selling levels below production costs.  The price of a benchmark indicator, 7/16 inch 
OSB produced in the North Central region, was in the $120s per thousand square feet for the first 
half of 1997 (Random Lengths, 1999).   
 
By 1999, the market recovered, as exemplified by the near record price of $260 per  for the 7/16 
inch OSB panel in the North Central region. With prices up, however, plans for five new mills 
were announced and production capacity is predicted to leap by 5 billion ft2 by the end of 2002, 
an increase of about 25% (Random Lengths, 2000).  Without new markets and uses for OSB, this 
increase in capacity will predictably lead in the next five years to price reductions, mill closures, 
delayed expansions, mergers and downsizing, or shifting to specialty products (Schuler and 
Adair, 2001). 
 
Over the long term, the 2000 RPA timber assessment (Haynes, 2001) predicts only limited 
movement in long-term prices for OSB/waferboard.  In terms of a deflated price index based 
upon the 1982 7/16-inch base, the OSB price historical and future projections are shown in 
Figure 2. This figure suggests that the wide fluctuations of price experienced during the 1990s 
and predicted to occur into the early 2000’s as a function of production capacity may settle out.  
Prices will increase at a moderate pace.   
 
One other factor to consider when evaluating market outlook and revenue opportunity is the 
proximity of any competing industries. The closest OSB facilities are operated by Louisiana 
Pacific; one is in Montrose, Colorado and the other in Chilco, Idaho.  Competition for fiber by 
another OSB plant is currently not an issue.

Table 3. Incomplete Fiber Use Decision Matrix  
 
Once the alternative uses have been identified, the evaluation criteria chosen, and the benchmark 
selected, the matrix is assembled. It is provided in Table 3; serving as a tool and record for 
evaluating each use against the benchmark within each of the ten criteria.  A relative scoring 
system of numbers ranging from 1 through 5 are placed in each cell depending upon how the 
alternative rates in comparison to the benchmark.  The relative scores mean:

5 =  performs much better than the benchmark 
4 =  performs better than the benchmark 
3 =  performs the same as the benchmark 
2 =  performs worse than the benchmark 
1 =  performs much worse than the benchmark.  
 
In those instances when there is not enough information available to permit a comparative 
evaluation, a score of “3” is assigned.  
PRODUCT DETAILS 
The following discussion provides the background information needed to competently judge and 
score each alternative within the various criteria. The results of the authors’ scoring are provided 
in Table 10 located in the following section titled Decision Matrix Results and Discussion 
USE B - PLYWOOD (PLYW’D) 
 
Plywood is the forerunner to OSB in the structural panel market.  It is made up of a number of 
veneers, where a veneer is a thin sheet of wood obtained by rotating and cutting peeler logs.  The 
veneer is spread with thermosetting synthetic glue and cross-laminated (adjacent layers have the 
wood grain at right angles) into a plywood panel.   Plywood is used for structural and 
architectural purposes.  Major applications for structural plywood are in residential and 
commercial construction and in industrial markets such as pallets, crates, and concrete forms. 
Most structural plywood is made from softwoods. Architectural plywood serves appearance-type 
decorative needs in applications such as wall paneling and furniture manufacture and is often are 
manufactured from hardwoods.  
 
The softwood plywood industry originally developed on the West Coast and was concentrated 
there for several decades because of the availability of large high-quality peeler logs, mostly of 
Douglas Fir.  The industry shifted to the South with advances in resin technology and 
manufacturing equipment making it possible to manufacture plywood from southern pine logs 
averaging 10 to 12 in. in diameter. The closest manufactures of plywood to northern Arizona are 
the two Boise Cascade facilities located in Elgin and Emmett, Idaho.  
 
A large number of species can be used to produce plywood.  The various species are assigned, 
according to strength and stiffness, to one of five different groups.  Group 1 species have the 
highest strength characteristics, and Group 5 the lowest properties.  Plywood made up of species 
from groups 1 to 4 can be used for structural applications.  Ponderosa pine is a group 3 species 
(APA, 1997).   
   
Since the late 1970’s, plywood has been loosing key markets to OSB because OSB is less 
expensive. As of early June 2001, 3/8” CD exterior southern plywood from western mills in 
Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas was selling net, f.o.b. mill for $263 per thousand sq. ft.  
Comparable southern OSB was priced at $200 (Random Lengths, 2001).  Similar differentials 
are present for other grades and mill locations. 
 

 
 
 
 
14 
 
 
 
Plywood production in 2000 fell to 19.68 billion ft2, while OSB output rose to 20.65 billion ft2.  
In the RPA 2000 projections, softwood plywood consumption is projected to decline slowly to 
10 billion ft2 by 2015 (Haynes, 2001).  This reduction is being attributed to three things: the 
substitution of OSB for plywood in residential construction, a constrained supply of suitable raw 
material, and mills choosing to produce veneer for the growing laminated veneer lumber (LVL) 
industry instead of plywood (Schuler and Adair, 2001).  
 
Small log utilization efficiencies in plywood are low.  Full sheet veneer recovery can be as low 
as 27% for a block diameter of 5” to a high of 60% for 10” and better diameter blocks (Willits, et 
al 1996).  Lower recovery rates coupled with the need for higher quality incoming logs results in 
poor product revenue projections as discussed below.      
 
Spelter (1996) notes that wood accounts for the largest share of manufacturing costs for southern 
pine plywood.  In 1995, this cost accounted for 52% of the estimated total cost-to-product of 
$6.93/ft3.  Even though plywood sells at a premium, it is not enough to counteract the incoming 
wood costs and provide attractive net revenues.  In this analysis, net revenues were as low as 
$.63/ft3 based upon a relatively high selling price of $236 per thousand sq. ft. of 3/8 inch thick 
panel.  
 
On the average, the typical southern pine plywood mill is approximately 24% smaller than the 
average OSB facility, reflecting in a lower number of jobs.  However, input fiber requirements 
are approximately the same as that of OSB due to the lower recovery rates associated with 
veneer peeling.  
USE C – PARTICLEBOARD & MEDIUM DENSITY FIBERBOARD  
 
Particleboard (part’bd) and medium density fiberboard (MDF) are nonstructural panels that are 
different in some important ways, but are also similar in others.  As a result, there are few 
publicly available manufacturing and economic analyses that separate the two products into 
distinct categories.  
 
The size and geometry of the wood particle, the amount of resin used, and the density to which 
the panel is pressed generally differentiates particleboard types. Lately, these manufacturers have 
been using a smaller than typical wood particle produced through mechanical means to 
manufacture a panel product that competes with MDF in furniture core markets.  In contrast, 
MDF uses wood that has been reduced to individual fibers and fiber bundles of low bulk density 
via a thermomechanical pulping process.  Once the mat of fiber, resin, and wax has been formed, 
the remainder of the MDF manufacturing process is similar to that of particleboard.   
 
Particleboard and MDF manufacturing was once based upon cheap mill residue consisting of 
planer shavings, slabs and chips, and the dust from sawing and sanding. This residue was 
available for essentially the cost of hauling. This situation is no longer true due to the numerous 
sawmill closures of the late 1980s and early 1990s and the now common use of residues for on-
site energy production. As a result, sawmill residue is a highly desirable commodity and the 
particleboard/MDF industry faces stiff competition for this raw material.  
 

 
 
 
 
15 
 
 
 
The cost of the wood raw material makes up one-fourth to one third of the total costs associated 
to the production of particleboard. It is so costly that any anticipated expansion in particleboard 
capacity is based upon cheaper agri-fiber instead of wood (Spelter, 1999).   
 
The specific gravity of the species is the most important raw material characteristic for the 
production of particleboard.  Like OSB, lower density woods are preferred and ponderosa pine is 
acceptable.  
 
Plant capacity tends to be, on the average, 20 to 30% smaller than the average 300 x 106 ft2 3/8 
inch OSB plant.  Lower plant capacities reflect fewer jobs.  And lower capacities coupled with 
high fiber utilization efficiencies equate to less input fiber requirements.   
 
Working from Spelter (1996), which relies on the use of cheap mill residue as the input wood 
source, the total cost-to-product, including capital depreciation and overhead, is $3.96/ft3 in 1995 
dollars for particleboard.  Wood costs make up 22% of this total.  This wood cost component 
converts to an approximate incoming cost of $.70/ft3, using an 80% recovery rate. It is important 
to note that the incoming wood residue is often clean and partially dried.  Additional costs for 
storage and handling, debarking, drying, chipping must be added to this analysis, if round wood 
is the raw material.  
 
Manufacturing cost information for MDF is not readily accessible.  One 1994 study (Rosenfield, 
1994) suggests that MDF manufacturing costs could range from $3.59/ft3 for 38 pounds per 
cubic feet (pcf) board to $5.01/ft3 for 53 pcf board.   
 
Particleboard is priced competitively; selling at a slightly lower price than OSB.  3/8” and 5/8” 
industrial particleboard manufactured in western Oregon is priced, net f.o.b. mill, at $180 and 
$220 per thousand square feet, respectively (Random Lengths, 2001).  Net revenue projection 
based upon Spelter’s work with mill residue as the raw material source and the current 3/8” panel 
price is approximately 1.80/ft3.  
 
In contrast, MDF is generally priced at a premium to particleboard. 5/8” MDF produced at plants 
west of the Mississippi has a current price of $335 per thousand square feet; $100 more than 
comparable particleboard.

Table 4.   Particleboard/MDF 1997 North American Market Share  
(Spelter, 1999) 

Particleboard, along with MDF, is used as cores stock in a variety of secondary, residential 
construction products as shown in Table 4. Interestingly, this table also shows the grow of MDF 
in the molding and millwork markets replacing traditional products like ponderosa pine boards.   
 
The RPA 2000 predicts moderate increases of nonstructural panel consumption (including 
particleboard and MDF, hardwood plywood, insulating board, and hardboard) to 25.8 billion ft2 
(3/8” basis) in 2010 from 21.0 billion ft2 in 1996.  Of this 1996 total, particleboard and MDF 
accounted for 60% of total consumption. Future outlook in the four major nonstructural panel 
markets vary considerably with insulating panels and hardwood plywood declining, but 
particleboard and MDF showing continued growth that parallels output in furniture, cabinetry, 
and underlayment in new single-family residences (Hayne, 2001). There appears, however, to be 
some predicted over capacity in production as indicated by price projections.  The nonstructural 
panel deflated price index strongly influenced by particleboard and MDF is projected to remain 
steady over the long term as seen in Figure 3.

USE D – DIMENSION LUMBER AND BOARDS

Historically, mature ponderosa pine was a commercially important southwestern timber resource 
that supported a lumber industry built upon the recovery of high-value factory and shop 
products, paneling, and dimensional lumber (Maeglin, 1987). These products were known for 
their dimensional stability and for yielding substantial volumes of clear cuttings for use as 
molding and stock for door and window frames and drawer parts (WWWPA, 1995).  Mature 
ponderosa pine was the species of choice for millwork.  

 
 
 
 
17 
 
 
 
 
Older sawmilling technologies, however, were very inefficient, converting only 30 to 60% of the 
log to solid product.  Larger logs provided better recoveries and better revenue opportunities.  
The processing of only small logs in an older, large-log sawmill provides negative returns 
(Wagner, et al, 1998). Recent advances in optimization and sawing techniques, however, are 
proving that a modern, high-speed mill can provide a reasonable return on investment via smaller 
logs. Comparisons made via a sawmill simulator between conventional stud sawmills and 
modern high-speed, small-log sawmills (Wagner, et.al, 2000) demonstrate this clearly.  Their 
results showed that the lumber produced at a conventional western stud sawmill from small 
diameter timber less than 11-in. dbh provides negative returns. In contrast, lumber from trees as 
small as 7-in. dbh produced at a modern small-log mill provides positive returns where variable 
costs as well as the costs to harvest and deliver logs are covered.   
 
It is believed that black jack ponderosa pine produces lumber and boards of lower grade that are 
susceptible to further degrade in uncontrolled environments where moisture fluctuates.  There 
are only a few existing studies, however, that documents these issues.  These studies include the 
assessment of lumber potential from small diameter ponderosa pine harvested from the GCFP’s 
research and demonstration project in the Fort Valley project area near Flagstaff, AZ (Lowell 
and Green, in press).  Lumber was sawn from 150 trees ranging in size from 6 to 16 inches dbh.  
Half of the trees were sawn into 2-inch dimension lumber (with some 1-inch jacket boards) and 
the other half into 1-inch appearance-grade boards.  After kiln drying, the lumber was surfaced 
and graded.  An analysis of the lumber’s market value was also completed.  A summary of their 
results are listed below:    
 
• Tree and log characteristics: Average tree age was 90 years old, ranging from 50 years to 120 
years.  Log scaled defects were very small, at less than 1.5% of the total cubic log volume.   
• Lumber recovery on a volume basis: The mean cubic recovery from logs sawn for dimension 
and appearance lumber was, respectively, 42.7% and 40.4%.  
• Lumber value: Based upon WWPA November 1999 summary prices, the mean value of the 
appearance grade lumber was $268 per hundred cubic feet gross log scale basis, while 
dimension lumber was only $215.  Lumber grade recovery for both visually-graded 
appearance and dimension lumber is provided in Table 5.

It is generally believed that mechanical grading can enhance the value of lumber because it can 
more finely sort lumber into its appropriate strength grades than visual grading can.  As a second 
phase of this lumber study, the 2 by 4 dimension lumber was sent to the University of Idaho to 
determine the potential benefits of mechanical grading by machine stress rating (MSR) 
techniques (Gorman, 2001). A total of 707 pieces ranging in length from 6 to 16 feet (6,224 
board feet) were evaluated.  The total sample had a mean density of .408.  The results of the 
grading and testing are provided in Tables 6, 7, and 8.

Table 7.  Yield and Mechanical Properties from 2 by 4 Ponderosa Pine Lumber from Northern 
Arizona Graded by Light Framing Rules (Cisternas, 2000) 
 
The large volume of economy grade lumber, having little merchantable value, was primarily the 
result of warp.  Upon comparing Tables 6 and 7 to Table 5, it is apparent that the warp and 
resulting grade downfall occurred sometime after the lumber left the sawmill grading station, and 
not during the actual kiln drying process. Presumably, this finished lumber dried even further 
while in-route to Idaho or in-storage.  Unfortunately, this warping behavior is not unexpected as 
is suggested by a few older studies (Arganbright et al 1978, Blake and Voorhies, 1980, Mackay 
and Rumball, 1972, Markstrom et al 1984) and anecdotal reports on small diameter ponderosa 
pine.  
 
The visual grade recovery per the light framing rules is less than that needed by a mill to ensure 
adequate revenues. Confidential conversations with sawmill consultants and mill personal from 
various Inland West mills suggest that the percentage of recovered Standard and Better needs to 
be 53 to 55%.  Table 7 is showing only 43% recovered to the Standard and Better grades.

Table 8. MSR grades for 2 by 4 lumber produced from small diameter ponderosa pine from 
Northern Arizona (Cisternas, 2000) 
 
The market opportunity for MSR lumber is in the engineered wood products arena of metal 
gusset plated trusses, wood I-joists, and glued laminated beams.  These products are engineered 
to serve in high stress situations and often require MSR grades of 1650Fb-1.5E and higher.  Only 
a small amount of the ponderosa pine of this study would fall into this grade class.  The yield of 
MSR lumber, if representative of the larger forest, would not readily justify the added investment 
in MSR equipment and processing steps (Gorman and Green, 2001) under current market 
structure.  
 
The study, however, suggests that a sawmill specializing in appearance grade may have 
opportunities for success especially if the lumber was furthered processed into cut-stock 
material.  Earlier work on lumber from small diameter trees from the Pacific Northwest (Lowell 
et al 2000) indicates that 6-inch wide boards are higher in value as cut-stock than lumber, and the 
No 3. Common boards realized the largest uplift when evaluated for cut-stock.  About 60% of 
the No. 3 Common boards in Table 5 were 6-inches or greater in width; a significant quantity 
warranting further analysis as cut-stock.   
 
A large stud mill producing in excess of 100 million board feet of solid sawn product per year 
would require upwards of 16 x 106 ft3 of fiber, which would be obtained from the thinning of 
more than 23,000 acres.  These large mills employ about 135 to 190 people. A smaller 30 person 
facility producing 20 million board feet of product would require upwards of 3.2 x 106 ft3 of fiber 
obtained from thinning 4600 acres per year.   
 
Spelter, et al (1996) approximated the operating costs, which included capital depreciation but 
not input wood costs, for a 100 x106 board feet facility at $1.44/ft3 of finished product or about 
$.80/ft3 gross log.  This is in contrast to a Western species stud lumber sales price of $3.36/ft3 of 
lumber which occurred during the Fall of 1995 (Spelter, et al, 1996) or the appearance grade 
lumber value of $2.68/ft3 gross log provided above.   
 

 
 
 
 
20 
 
 
 
The net revenue for a typical facility that can readily sell its wood residue, however, is not 
simply the lumber sales price minus wood costs and operating costs, but should include revenue 
from the sale of pulp chips, shavings, and sawdust.  These revenues are estimated at $2.00/ft3 for 
pulp chips and $.50/ft3 to $.70/ft3 for particleboard residue.  The revenue expectation based on 
the 1995-1996 values, without regard for incoming wood costs, could possibly be in the 
neighborhood of $1.94/ft3.  
 
Prior to the late 1980’s, a number of medium to large sawmills operated in northern Arizona.  
Except for the Fort Apache Timber Company (FATCO) in Whiteriver, the remaining mills 
(Precision Pine mill in Heber, Reidhead & Sons Logging in Fredonia, and Reidhead Brothers 
Lumber mill in Nutrioso) are 6 to 13-man operations each using around 5 million board feet of 
logs when operating.  FACTO owns 68% of the Arizona conversion capacity with their primary 
source of fiber being ponderosa pine from the White Mountain Apache reservation.  It is 
estimated that they can convert between 68 million to 91 million board feet of logs into lumber 
(Temple, et al, 1999).  
 
The long-term market outlook for lumber consumption is tied directly construction.  About 65% 
of the lumber produced in 1996 was used for construction. Residential upkeep and improvements 
are becoming a dominating factor in softwood lumber usage. The U.S. consumption of softwood 
lumber is projected to grow from 49.1 billion board feet in 1996 to 55.4 billion board feet to 
2010 with imports expected to supply about 41% of this demand (Haynes, 2001).  
USE E – MECHANICAL MARKET PULP  
 
More than three-quarters of the world’s wood pulp never leaves the mill in which it is produced; 
instead it is used in another part of the facility to make paper and paperboard.  In some cases, 
however, a paper mill may not produce a certain type of pulp, or it may be a non-integrated 
facility without a pulping capacity of its own.  As a result, the paper mill will fill its requirements 
from other mills, or it will purchase pulp, known as market pulp, from outside market pulp 
suppliers.  To reduce the complexity of a market analysis, this study focuses on market pulp vs. 
the wide variety of paper and paperboard products obtained from pulp.  In addition, the primary 
difference among the various paper and paperboard manufacturing processes is the pulping 
process where pulp makes up a large part of the costs of finish production.  
 
Most paper-grade pulps are produced by chemical processes, but some are made by mechanical 
methods.  These mechanical-based pulps include stone groundwood, thermomechanical pulp 
(TMP), chemi-thermomechanical pulp (CTMP), and bleached chemi-thermomechanical pulp 
(BCTMP).  Mechanically produced pulp has been chosen for analysis instead of chemical (either 
sulfate – also known as kraft – or sulfite) pulps, because of the economic and scale advantages.  
Mechanical pulp has lower production costs, lower labor costs, and much lower capital costs per 
ton of product than kraft processes.  It also is free of the rotten cabbage smell so characteristic of 
kraft mills.  In addition, kraft-pulping technology has larger economies of scale requiring large-
scale facilities, whereas mechanical pulping provides more flexibility in facility size.  On the 
downside, mechanical processes have high electrical energy demands with revenue and profit 
potential highly dependent on energy costs.  
 

 
 
 
 
21 
 
 
 
Of the 58,261,000 metric tons of wood pulp produced in the U.S. in 1996, 9.25%  was 
groundwood or thermo-mechanical pulp (Miller Freeman, 1997).  There are no CTMP/BCTMP 
mills currently operating in the U.S. and only one mill is being planned – the $300 million Aspen 
Bay Pulp & Fibre located in Menominee, Michigan with start up sometime in 2002 (Paperloop, 
2000).  Seventy-four percent of the worldwide capacity of BCTMP is located in Canada due to 
their low energy costs and proximity to suitable wood species like aspen and birch (Cannel and 
Cockram, 2000).  
 
Mechanical pulping reduces pulpwood to individual fibers through mechanical energy where the 
wood is physically torn apart.  As a result, little material is lost; approximately 90% to 95% of 
the incoming wood is turned into pulp.  These high yield pulps, however, contain high lignin 
contents, resulting in paper that yellows with age, is low in strength, and has relatively poor 
surface quality.  Mechanical pulps are ideal for newsprint and low-quality mechanical printing 
grade paper such as that found in phone directories.  
 
Of the mechanical pulps, BCTMP is particularly attractive, as it is competitive with bleached 
krafts.  BCTMP hardwood has sold at an average 90% to 95% of southern hardwood bleached 
kraft (Miller Freeman, 1997).  It has been accepted in the printing/writing sector in the Far East 
for a number and years and is gaining acceptance in Europe.   
 
Chemi-thermomechanical and bleached chemi-thermomechanical pulp are not purely mechanical 
pulps, but involve the addition of chemicals (sodium sulfite and chelating agents) to the chips 
prior to refining.  Hydrogen peroxide is generally used to bleach the CTMP pulp to brightness 
levels of 85+ ISO.   CTMP and BCTMP have a number of advantages over TMP pulp.  The 
chemical pretreatment of the chips permits a less destructive separation of fibers from the wood, 
resulting in a higher content of longer fibers.  The fiber is more flexible, providing higher sheet 
density and higher burst and tensile strength.  Major markets for CTMP and BCTMP not only 
include newsprint, mechanical printing paper, but also absorbent products like tissue and baby 
diapers.  It is also moving into printing/writing sector that other mechanical pulps cannot access.     
 
Producers closely guard BCTMP production and consumption statistics making predictions 
about market outlook difficult. Most of the market for BCTMP in the U.S. and Canada is for 
tissue and towel grades of paper.  But in 1997, the U.S. adopted a more flexible specification that 
no longer limits high-yield pulps in free sheet grades to 10%.  This easing plus predicted 
increases in demand for printing/writing grade paper is expected to increase BCTMP 
consumption. In addition, pulp prices are expected to increase at a moderate pace into 2001 in 
response to worldwide increases in demands without little capacity build-up (McLaren, et al 
2000).  And as pulp prices increase, the price differential between chemical and BCTMP grades 
tend to narrow, further increasing investment attractiveness in BCTMP (Cannel and Cockram, 
2000).   
 
The pulp market suffers from widely cyclic behavior with sharp inventory swings and rising or 
falling prices.  Capital investment in the market pulp industry usually comes in surges during 
periods of rising prices and profits.  New mill construction takes two or three or more years.  
Once the wave of new capacity comes on line, the market may weaken, resulting in oversupply 
and declining prices. As profitability declines, companies rein in capital spending, slowing down 

 
 
 
 
22 
 
 
 
capacity expansion, and setting the stage for the next period of market tightness (Miller Freemen, 
1997).    
 
The suitability of a wood species for mechanical pulping is a function of fiber length, fiber 
flexibility, and density.  Dense species are generally not used in mechanical pulping processes 
because of the associated fiber-shattering problem.  Lodgepole pine and ponderosa pine are 
among the low fiber, low density softwood pulpwood species that are preferred for pulping and 
papermaking.   The range of species suitable for BCTMP, however, has not been fully explored, 
but it is believed that ponderosa pine may be physically suitable with the integration of a system 
to handle problems caused by the large amount of resin in pine-type woods.  It has been 
suggested, however, by Willits et al (1996) that stems smaller than 5” in diameter will affect pulp 
quality due to an increase in fines.  
 
Spelter et al (1996) estimate the manufacturing costs for a smaller-than-typical BCTMP facility 
of 165 tons of dry pulp/day to be $393/dry ton of pulp.  Input fiber requirements with a 10% 
moisture content are estimated at 13.25 x 103 ft3/day, which is equivalent to 22.52 x 103 ft3/day at 
80% moisture content. This type of fiber consumption equates to 7.9 x 106 ft3/year , equal to the 
thinning of approximately 11,300 acres/year.  With almost a one-to-one input to output 
efficiency, the cost to manufacture, without regard for incoming wood costs, can be restated in 
terms of output fiber as approximately $4.89/ft3.  This number, however, is very sensitive to 
power costs, as energy expense is the largest component of the total operating budget.  With an 
assumed sales price of $798/dry ton, revenue expectations are in the neighborhood of $405/dry 
ton, equivalent to $8.21/ft3.  Net revenue expectations are subsequently high, especially if 
incoming wood costs can be controlled.     
 
Spetler et al (1996) indicate that the 165 ton/day facility will generate approximately 4500 
gallons of waste water per air dry ton of pulp; this waste water has a fairly high organic content.  
In comparison to a kraft facility, the generation of air-borne particulates and organics is small, 
but must still be removed from the air prior to emission to the surrounding environment.  
 
At one time, the opportunity for developing new pulp and paper capacity in northern Arizona 
was marginal due to the existence of Abitibi’s (formerly Stone Container) linerboard and 
newsprint facility in Snowflake, AZ.  Prior to its conversion in about December of 1998 to a 
100% recycled product, this mill consumed about 580,000 tons of green chips and pulpwood as 
well as 360,000 tons of recycled paper (Bennett, 1996).   
 
There is currently a new greenfield thermomechanical pulp and paper mill being planned for 
Belen, New Mexico.  This $750 million facility, called New Era Forest Products, LLC, will 
primarily utilize ponderosa pine chips to produce approximately 200,000 tons per year of finish 
product like lightly coated groundwood paper.   
USE F – ETHANOL 
 
The production of ethanol from woody material is considered at this time an emerging use for the 
small diameter wood. Ethanol is currently produced mostly from corn, (Biofuels, 1998; 

 
 
 
 
23 
 
 
 
Kryzanowski, 1998a), but new technologies developed by the National Renewable Energy 
Laboratory (NREL) are improving the prospects for wood conversion (USDOE, 1993).   
 
The Department of Energy believes that ethanol use may reduce oil imports, slow the depletion 
of oil resources, and may in fact help the environment (USDOE, 1993).  For example, ethanol is 
blended with gasoline in many cities in the Western United States to increase the octane of the 
fuel while reducing carbon monoxide levels (Kane and LeBlanc, 1989).  A second environmental 
benefit is that there is no net release of CO2 produced by the combustion of the ethanol (USDOE, 
1993).  In the coming years, automakers plan to produce vehicles that will use ethanol as an 
alternative fuel (Reitman and Christian, 1997). 
 
Currently, ethanol demand is driven by the federal and state Clean Air Act requirements 
mandating the use of oxygenates in winter gasoline. Ethanol consumption California, Arizona, 
Nevada, Oregon, and Washington increased from 154 million to 214 million gallons per year 
from 1992 to 1995 (QL, 1997).  Ethanol production on the West Coast in 1997 was only 14 
million gallons per year; 6 million produced in California and 8 million being produced in 
Washington.  Demand was being met by ethanol produced in the Midwest.   
 
The process for producing ethanol consists of breaking up the wood fiber and treating it to 
promote a maximum amount of fermentation of the xylan and cellulose components of the wood.  
During this process, the lignin in the wood is separated out and is available for use as a burning 
fuel or for processing into other products.  A number of items are needed to carry out the 
production process (USDOE, 1993).  The ethanol facility must be co-located at a power plant 
which would supply the necessary steam and power.  The power plant boiler can burn the 
gaseous and solid fuels given off by ethanol production (methane and lignin).  A disc refiner is 
needed to process chips into small pieces to start the refinement process.  Steam at 50 pounds per 
square inch gauge (psig) and 150 psig, and compressed air, is needed to aid in the fermentation 
of the chips.  Cooling water is needed to maintain process efficiencies.  
 
The new technology to produce ethanol from wood has been tested on a laboratory scale, but has 
not yet been assembled in a working plant.  
 
To better understand the economics of a wood-to-ethanol manufacturing facility located in 
northern Arizona, Mark Yancey of NREL (1999) completed two analyses of our situation.  He 
examined the costs and the internal rate of return (IRR) for a 7 million gallon per year facility 
located at the Cholla Power Plant near St. Johns with a yearly raw material supply of 141,000 
bone-dry-short tons (BDT) costing, respectively $20/BDT and $40/BDT.  His results, which 
were based upon many assumptions that could be fined tuned if warranted, suggested that the 
respective IRRs were 7.5% and -.8%; neither of which prove to be good investments. A 
summary of the raw material inputs and Yancey’s model are provided in Table 9.   
 
It was estimated that over 11,500 acres per year would need to be thinned to supply the feedstock 
volume of 141,000 BDT/year. In this projection, all harvested trees 5” to less than 11” dbh and 
the tops and branches of the 11” and larger trees went as feedstock.  
 

 
 
 
 
24 
 
 
 
The fiber costs of $40/BDT and $20/BDT as shown in Table 9 reflect two different scenarios: 
with and without additional subsidies.  Based upon the earlier reported work, harvesting and 
hauling costs to a facility 90-miles away, would cost about $48.50/ccf or $40/BDT.

Table 9.  Raw Material Inputs and Plant Model for Ethanol Production 
 
Although a 7,000,000 gallon per year wood-to-ethanol manufacturing facility could utilize a 
great deal of small diameter wood and provide potential economic benefits to the local 
community, the cost of the input fiber precludes further analysis.  The work reported on here 
suggests that the cost to harvest and transport the raw woody materials must be reduced to at 
least $24.30/ccf to make the manufacturing economics more attractive to potential investors 
without any state or federal subsidies.  
USE G – ROUNDWOOD USE CLUSTER 
 
So far this analysis has considered only commodity-type products where profits are derived from 
economies of scale and speculation on margins between raw material purchases and finished 
product sales. These products require a steady and large supply of raw wood of specific 
characteristics, a highly automated and mechanized manufacturing process, and the marketing 
know-how to make profits via sales margins.   
 
The roundwood use cluster, however, represents a different strategy that manufactures products 
for niche, small-scale markets that can be quite volatile.  Production requires smaller volumes of 
raw material, and can be completed using less advanced manufacturing technologies.  Success in 
the niche markets requires high quality, unique products accompanied by fanatical attention to 
market development and customer service. Although these type of products violate the early 
criteria of only considering large volume users in response to the potential size of forest health 
and fire-risk reduction programs, their economic potential and social suitability are attractive 
enough to justify analysis.      
 
Roundwood products present many economic advantages that make them an attractive product 
alternative.  The cost to manufacture is low, but market value can be quite high.  Small diameter 
logs in conventional pile, post and pole applications are valued at around $200 per green ton.  In 
contrast, this resource is worth roughly $160 per green ton when processed into lumber or $30 
per green ton as chips (Wolfe, 2000).  Poles and other high-value roundwood applications have a 
greater net value per volume because they require less processing, create less manufacturing-

 
 
 
 
25 
 
 
 
related wastes, and have greater load-carrying capacity than lumber sawn from the same logs 
(Wolfe and Mosely, 2000).  
 
Roundwood products may also be more compatible with the social concerns of the local 
communities. In the late 1980s and early 1990’s, the wood processing industry of northern 
Arizona was dominated by one entity - Stone Container with a large newsprint facility and a 
sawmill.  Although there were other users in the region, Stone’s need for large quantities of 
wood coupled with the cash flow advantage of a well-capitalized large corporation, placed Stone 
in enviable position.  They nearly controlled the market for saw logs and pulpwood coming from 
the federal forests in northern Arizona.  This dominance had the secondary effect of unduly 
influencing forest management decisions. This situation is no longer, but its lessons are clear.  
Many do not want a repeat situation of a single, large wood fiber user controlling forest 
management via its control of the wood fiber market. An example of this community perspective 
can be gained by perusing the Grand Canyon Forests Partnership’s literature.  Although the 
GCFP has never formally publicized this concern about a large-scale wood products 
manufacturer, it is one of their goals to sustain forest restoration efforts through the creation of 
local, small-scale wood products industries (GCFP, 2001).  By implication, their focus on small 
industry is in counter-response to the monopoly of the past.  
 
To develop a better understanding of the opportunities and issues related to a roundwood cluster, 
an analysis of one potential cluster was completed and summarized here. This analyzed cluster is 
theoretical, but based upon real developments that are currently being undertaken by the 
Indigenous Community Enterprises (ICE), a non-profit initiative intent on developing and 
coordinating economic development projects with the Navajo Nation.  Their first project is the 
Navajo Hogan/Roundwood Manufacturing Project that will manufacture affordable and modern 
hogan housing units from roundwood, along with other associated wood products (ICE, 
undated).  At the time of this writing in the Summer of 2001, ICE is finishing the construction of 
their first hogan prototype and is beginning to develop their pilot manufacturing facility located 
in Cameron, AZ.  ICE believes that the market for these hogan-building systems is very strong 
both on and off the Reservation.  Their studies suggest that the Navajo Nation alone has a need 
for over 25,000 new homes of which a modern hogan is most desirable as it fulfills many cultural 
and ceremonial needs.    
 
The theoretical cluster analyzed here is modeled partly after the ICE hogan manufacturing 
project by relying heavily on their hogan designs, sales projections, and current decisions about 
facility and equipment needs.  The major difference between this analysis and the real project is 
that the theoretical model assumes a different mix of other products than what might really 
develop.  The theoretical cluster focuses on a product mix that includes both developing and 
existing markets to optimize the use of the full range of logs coming from typical forest 
restoration and fuels reduction programs. In effect, this theoretical use cluster serves as a sort 
yard and eliminates the need to sort at the landing. This mix of uses includes:  
 
• 
For logs cut from trees less than 8” dbh, on-site processing of firewood.  
• 
For logs cut from trees 8” to 12” dbh, on-site manufacture of modern hogan building systems 
with the processed logs forming the load-bearing frame and wall enclosures.  

• 
For logs from trees 13” dbh and larger, on-site processing of hand-peeled vigas or utility 
poles.  
 
Small, modern hogans are the keystone product of this mix that controls the amount of raw 
material purchased and the operational characteristics of the cluster. The hogan product offering 
will be some variation of the designs being created by a team of architectural students and 
professors from School of Architecture at Arizona State University.  Figure 4 is an early hogan 
concept showing the basic 25’ diameter eight-sided hogan module along with a 10 ft x 10 ft 
module. These designs utilize four-inch and 6-inch diameter finished ponderosa pine logs as the 
building material for the structural frame and exterior walls.  
 
 
 
Figure 4. ICE Hogan Prototype  
 
The analysis examined costs and net returns for a production sequence starting with 2 hogans per 
month through to a final production goal of 20 hogans per month. The cluster is assumed to be 
located at about 80 miles from Flagstaff in Cameron, AZ within a 14,440 square foot enclosed 
facility with outside concrete pad.  
 
The basic 25’ hogan frame with 529 square feet of useable space requires 820 cubic feet of input 
wood fiber from trees 8” to 12” dbh. This input wood fiber was estimated to cost a total 
$72.80/ccf, which includes harvesting and trucking. Even though product recovery may increase 
over time with experience, the ratio of finish product volume to input wood volume was assumed 
constant at 50%. The manufacturing and sales personal included a mill manager, a combined 
sales and design manager, mill workers, site crews to assemble the finished hogans at readied 
building sites, a skilled maintenance worker, and a clerical person.  Their costs included a base 
salary plus health and insurance benefits.  Capital improvements to the building and site were 
included at $62,000 at start-up and an addition $100,000 at full production. Facility site rental 
was estimated at $5000 per month.  Production equipment included pole debarker/processor, 
profile saw, strobe saw, container kiln, lift truck, front end loader, conveyors, and a variety of 
miscellaneous tools and equipment for a total initial investment of $402,000.  This equipment 
was depreciated over a 5 year service life on a straight-line basis and included a salvage value 
equaling 20% of the original costs.  In addition, opportunity costs were assigned to the monthly 
fixed equipment costs; reflecting the loss of investment interest that the money spent to purchase 
the equipment could have yielded if invested instead.  
 
 
 
 
 
26 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
27 
 
 
 
The target sales price of $30,000 was assumed for the basic octagonal structure that included a 
finished exterior structure with window and doors and a very basic insulated interior with painted 
drywall walls and baseboards, electrical fixtures and wiring, and basic plumbing for a kitchen 
sink.  Costs associated with site preparation, foundation and floor slab, or utility hook-up are not 
included.  This analysis only consider the basic hogan and did not account for the costs and 
returns associated with the additional rectangular module that could be provided to serve partly 
as a bathroom.  
 
The firewood capacity was matched to the incoming wood needs for hogan production, utilizing 
that material coming from trees less than 8” dbh. Although a more local market for firewood 
might develop, this analysis assumed that small packaged bundles of split firewood could be sold 
to retailers in the Flagstaff and Phoenix areas for $3.36 per 1.5’ x 1.5’ x 2’ bundle.  The assumed 
manufacturing equipment set-up included a gas-powered log splitter, chain saw, and other 
miscellaneous tools for a total initial investment of approximately $10,000.  This process was 
assumed be located outside the building on an adjacent concrete pad area.  Except for a small 
amount of clerical time for billing and sales development, this cost center only accounted for 
direct operational costs and no overhead functions. As noted earlier, the hogan product line 
carried the facility and personal overhead costs.   
 
Like firewood, the production capacity for hand-peeled vigas and poles was a function of the 
incoming wood supply as dictated by the hogan production capacity. The number of available 
larger logs for this high-value product was projected from inventory data collected from unit 2 of 
the GCFP’s Research and Demonstration project. It is believed that this unit is fairly typical of 
the type of future stands that will be treated for ecological or fuels reduction purposes in northern 
Arizona. The treatment was a 2-4 presettlement prescription with a 22” dbh cutting limit 
designed by the Ecological Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona University. It was assumed 
that one person could process (buck to length and hand peel) 4 logs per day with minimal 
equipment costs.  Like firewood, only a small amount of clerical/sales overhead was assigned to 
this cost center.  Target sales price for these high-value logs was assumed at $5 per cubic foot of 
finished product that has a small end diameter greater than or equal to 8” and a length greater 
than or equal to 20’.   
 
This analysis assumes that reasonably located markets with the ability to pay the target sales 
price are readily available for all three product lines.  
 
Table 10 summarizes the results of the theoretical cluster model on a monthly cost and net return 
basis. Additional details are provided in the appendix to this report. The tabulated summary costs 
include costs for raw logs at the manufacturing site in Cameron, fixed and operational 
manufacturing costs, other material costs, transport to market, site installation, sales expense, 
employee wages and benefits, and office and facility overhead.  The projected employee totals of 
Table 10 are for personal directly employed by the cluster.  It does not include those involve in 
trucking, which is assumed as a separate contract costing $60/hour.   
 
The results presented in Table 10 are very encouraging provided the previously noted key 
assumptions hold true. At a production capacity of 6 hogans per month, 357 bundles of firewood, 
and 155 large poles, the cluster moves from a deficit position into a break-even situation. The 

 
 
 
 
28 
 
 
 
production goal of 20 hogans per month, perhaps achievable within the third or fourth year of 
operation, provides an attractive net return that can be used to further grow and sustain the 
facility. As noted earlier, these types of products are small volume wood users.   This analysis 
projects, at full capacity, a utilization rate of about 4200 ccf per year of wood fiber obtained from 
the restoration of about 260 acres of ponderosa forests.

The development of the hogan product line, however, will face tremendous technical challenges; 
challenges that were not accounted in the cluster model via their potential demands on resources.  
These envision challenges include:    
 
1. Roundwood structural system designs: The hogan frame design itself is still under 
development and will likely continue to be refined for many years in an effort to better serve 
a hopefully expanding customer base and to reduce costs by optimizing material use and 
reducing manufacturing complexities.  This research and development work will rely heavily 
on the innovations and hard work of a staff of design, sales, and manufacturing personal. 
Except for the established log home market that use large diameter logs and the recent efforts 
of the USDA’s Forest Products Laboratory to develop informational kiosks for the 2002 
Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, there are no roundwood structural designs to draw from.  
Similarly, very few engineers and architects are skilled in wood design and even fewer are 
comfortable with round sections.  
2. Building code acceptance: As a load-bearing building system, hogans will face the additional 
sales-related hurdle of acceptance by local and regional building authorities.  This acceptance 
may be accomplished by the validation of structural integrity through a systemic analysis 

 
 
 
 
29 
 
 
 
completed by a licensed structural engineer that will require an on-going quality assurance 
program and the capability to produce professional construction drawings.  
3. Log properties and design standards: A key component to validating structural integrity will 
be an assessment of processed log strength properties and long-term service behavior. 
Currently, very little is known about the strength and stiffness properties of small diameter 
round wood coming from the slow-growing ponderosa pine stands of northern Arizona. The 
existing national design standards for round timbers focus on large round wood members 
acting in bending with design values derived from small-scale, clear-wood, dry specimens of 
old-growth wood. These procedures do not readily apply to structural round wood cut from 
small diameter, young trees that will be used in axial tension or compression applications.  
4. Connections:  The evolution of wood structures during the past 150 years has concentrated 
on sawn lumber (Wolfe, 2000) at the expense of round wood developments. The technology 
of connecting two round wood pieces together has been ignored. Round wood connections, 
however, are a critical component to the successful development of any round wood 
structural system including the hogan system.  
5. Processing: Although some small-diameter round wood can be used in the raw form,  high-
valued engineering applications like the hogan system, will require precision manufacturing 
and drying.  Up until recently, round wood processing technologies have not produced 
products with high uniformity in dimension.  Increased attention must be given new 
manufacturing techniques and to monitoring and controlling product behavior during and 
after processing to ensure a high-quality product that can, indeed, demand a higher value in 
the market.  
DECISION MATRIX RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
According to the information revealed in the previous product-by-product discussion, the authors 
were able to comparatively judge product performance.  The criteria scoring results are provided 
in Table 11.  After the assignment of criteria scores, total un-weighted and weighted product 
scores were determined and subsequent ranks set.   
 
This decision methodology, as reported in Table 11, suggests that mechanical pulp is the most 
suitable product choice for meeting the conditions unique to northern Arizona. Regardless of 
summation scheme, it achieved a ranking of 1.  This result points to the product’s potential for 
efficiently utilizing small diameter wood material of low value to produce a highly valued 
product with a strong market outlook, while providing a substantial number of jobs to the local 
economy. It is a high-tech solution that with high energy demands.  Its environmental 
shortcomings can be mitigated.   
 
The roundwood cluster edged out particleboard and MDF products because of its high ratings in 
the criterion of initial costs/flexibility, discharge, water usage, and 9” ≤ dbh < 12” that 
compensated for its low potential in revenue, jobs, and market outlook.   The roundwood 
products examined find its buyers in niche, small-scale market segments that become quickly 
oversupplied, but are demanding markets in terms of quality, uniqueness, and attention to 
customer service. On the other hand, these types of cluster uses are appealing because they 
present less capital and social risk.  The roundwood cluster analyzed here could be established 
for less than $750,000, while today’s large-scale commodity type products are produced in 
facilities costing between 50 to 100 million dollars. In addition, individual small scale wood

users have almost no ability to influence the market price for raw logs; an attribute that is 
perceived as desirable by the local community.

Table 11. Completed Decision Matrix Comparing the Suitability of Uses 
 
Particleboard and medium density fiberboard products and OSB were judged nearly equal in 
their suitability.  The demand and revenue outlook for both non-structural and structural panels is 
dependent upon the construction industry, which is projected to shift over the next 20 to 50 years 
more towards renovation and remodeling away from new construction.    
 
Lumber and boards was deemed a marginal product opportunity by this analysis. This ranking 
reflects the processing and grade recovery problems presented by the inherent growth and 
strength characteristics of black jack ponderosa pine.  It is of low strength and consequently does 
not benefit from value-adding techniques such as machine stress rating for structural 
applications. Its cross-section is largely juvenile wood that if not handled and dried properly, will 
result in substantial grade degradation. On the other hand, high-speed modern sawmills with 
scanning and optimizing technologies have been proven successful with small-diameter logs of a 
variety of species. If the drying and degrade issues can be controlled, the blackjack resource may 
have some opportunity as cut stock in the appearance grade board market.  
 
Ethanol’s low ranking reflects its poor revenue potential and market outlook, as well as its need 
to be located at an existing power plant and its tremendous demand for water. In addition, the 
technology to convert wood fiber into ethanol is still under development and has yet to be proven 
out in any large-scale way.  Although it is the one use that could convert slash, bark, needles to a 
useable product, it is judged a product unsuitable to the conditions of northern Arizona.  
 

 
 
 
 
31 
 
 
 
Similarly, plywood is deemed unsuitable.  It was ranked last by both summation techniques; 
pointing the product’s need for high quality, large diameter logs and species with higher strength 
characteristics than that provided by small diameter logs of young ponderosa pine.  It also 
reflects the shifting market where cheaper OSB is the preferred alternative over plywood in 
structural panel applications.   
CONCLUSIONS 
 
This study used a decision-making technique, called the decision matrix, to analyze wood fiber 
uses and to answer the question:   
 
What market or combination of wood fiber uses can effectively and suitably meet the 
conditions unique to northern Arizona? 
 
By evaluating the relative performance of a six logical products to a benchmark product within 
eleven categories ranging from revenue potential to raw material compatibility to infrastructure 
flexibility, we found that large-scale commodity type products dominated.  Mechanical pulp and 
its related paper and board products were judged as the most suitable product opportunities.  Two 
of three panel products, OSB and the non-structural grouping of particleboard and MDF, 
followed closely behind. They are judge suitable because of their ability to convert large 
quantities of small diameter ponderosa pine with objectionable growth characteristics into high 
value product, while providing better paying employment opportunities.  These types of 
commodity markets, however, are vulnerable to complex demand and supply problems.  They 
typically overbuild their production capacity during times of high product demand that 
eventually results in oversupply and price compression.  This cyclic behavior reflects back into 
the community through production slowdowns, short or long term layoffs, and demands for 
cheaper raw materials.  
 
Small-scale roundwood uses were also judged suitable.  Even though this study evaluated only 
one mix of products (firewood, hogans, hand-peeled vigas and poles), we believe that the 
conclusions drawn about this mix are relevant to other small-scale product uses. It represents the 
type of specialty niche market that is small in scale, requires less up-front capital investment, but 
demands high quality and attention to customer service. Roundwood use clusters can convert 
only small quantities of wood fiber into value-added products.  As a result, their ability to sustain 
large-scale forest health and fuels reduction programs within the region’s national forest will be 
limited.  
 
Because of the current lack of suitable wood fiber markets, the ability of the region’s national 
forest systems to fund thinning projects depends heavily on federal appropriations provided for 
fire reduction goals. These appropriations will eventually dry up.  The need to thin, however, 
will grow stronger, while the ability to do is diminished unless alternative funding mechanisms 
are found.  Wood product industries provide that alternative funding through the purchase of 
thinning by-products.  In effect, the manufacture of suitable wood-based products is the 
necessary component for sustaining forest health and fuels reduction programs. Their 
establishment, however, relies heavily on the availability of a steady supply of fiber of sufficient 
quantity.
