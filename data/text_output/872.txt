Meeting multiple resource objectives, such as increasing resilience to climate change, while simultaneously
increasing watershed health, conserving biodiversity, protecting old-growth, reducing the risk of catastrophic
wildﬁre, and promoting ecosystem health, is paramount to landscape restoration. Central to public land
management efforts in the West is the widespread adoption of size-prohibited cutting of “large” trees, a
limitation referred to as a “diameter cap.” In this study, we used the most commonly proposed prescription for
the Four Forest Restoration Initiative in northern Arizona to explore the implications of diameter caps for multiple
resource responses through the use of model simulations. We found that implementing progressively smaller caps
in southwestern ponderosa pine may result in relatively similar live tree densities, canopy cover, and large snag
densities but higher basal areas, mean tree size, torching indices, and scenic beauty with lower water yield and
herbaceous production. When diameter cap scenarios are compared, tradeoffs exist, and no single metric is suited
for overall scenario evaluation.

M
eeting multiple objectives, al-
though challenging, is typical for
current natural resource manage-
ment of public lands (Dale et al. 2000), and
of
particular
importance
as
changing
climatic conditions, extreme disturbance
events, and land-use patterns continue to
create a unique set of social demands for eco-
system services (Kirilenko and Sedjo 2007,
Bonan 2008). In the American Southwest,
historical grazing, logging, and ﬁre suppres-
sion actions, in conjunction with past cli-
mate events, have resulted in an even-aged
dominated forest structure with few old (or
large) trees, high accumulation of coarse
woody material, reduced herbaceous pro-
duction and diversity, and continued degra-
dation of wildlife habitat (Carey et al. 1992,
1999, Covington and Moore 1994, Moore
et al. 2004, Kalies et al. 2012, Reynolds et al.
2013). These conditions (e.g., Figure 1A),
which differ from the desired or reference
conditions (e.g., Figure 1B) based on those
that existed before Euro-American settle-
ment (Covington and Moore 1994, Moore
et al. 2004, Abella et al. 2007), are particu-
larly problematic because they have now
become increasingly susceptible to unchar-
acteristic disturbances such as severe, large-
scale wildﬁre events (Covington and Moore
1994, Swetnam et al. 1999, Graham et al.
2004, Fitzgerald 2005, Allen 2007) and in-
sect epidemics (Kolb et al. 1998, Negro´n et
al. 2009).
Wide acceptance that these highly de-
graded forest conditions create a unique
challenge for managers and are in need of
restoration led to the establishment of the
Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI)
(US Department of Agriculture [USDA]
Forest Service 2013). The 4FRI is the na-
tion’s largest collaborative effort (The Na-
ture Conservancy 2011) to restore forest
ecosystems on more than 2 million acres and
is located on portions of four national forests

in Northern Arizona, including the Co-
conino, Kaibab, Apache-Sitgreaves, and
Tonto. The 4FRI’s primary goal is to accel-
erate restoration so that forests are more re-
silient to climate change while simultane-
ously
increasing
watershed
health
and
function, improving wildlife habitat, con-
serving biodiversity, protecting old-growth,
reducing the risk of uncharacteristic wild-
land ﬁre, and promoting the reintroduction
of natural ﬁre (USDA Forest Service 2013).
However, as documented by Coughlan’s
(2003) ethnographic study, differing social
and ecological values, combined with view-
point arguments over the details of silvicul-
tural prescriptions often slow and/or prevent
restoration from being implemented (Abella
et al. 2006).
The ecological and social importance of
large diameter trees (often assumed to be old
as well) (see Kaufmann et al. 2007) has been
a central feature of debates and discussions
about how to implement forest restoration
efforts throughout the western United
States. In the American Southwest, such dis-
cussions, which typically include the under-
lying threat of litigation, have resulted in the
widespread adoption of treatment “diameter
caps” (Larson and Mirth 2001, Allen et al.
2002, Coughlan 2003, Abella et al. 2006,
Triepke et al. 2011). In this forest restora-
tion context, diameter caps occur when
treatment implementation prohibits cutting
live trees above a certain dbh (4.5 ft above
the ground) (see Sidebar 1). Abella et al.
(2006) provide a succinct overview of the
differing viewpoints on the application of
diameter caps and the recent discussion by
DellaSala et al. (2013) in response to Frank-
lin and Johnson (2012) in the Journal of For-
estry provides an excellent context in this on-
going debate. Evidence that this debate has
no end in sight is the development of the
Old Growth Protection and Large Tree Re-
tention Strategy by members of the 4FRI
stakeholder group (4FRI 2011), which pro-
motes blanket old-growth protection, re-
gardless of tree size, and broad retention of
“large” young trees. Other examples of di-
ameter caps in the Southwest include the
5-in. cap imposed by environmental advo-
cates on experimental restoration treatment
units in the Grand Canyon (Fule´ et al.
2006), the 16-in. cap required for a restora-
tion project in the White Mountains
(Abrams and Burns 2007), the 12-in. cap
used to deﬁne forest biomass appropriate for
generating renewable energy (Arizona Cor-
poration Commission 2006), and the 16-in.
cap agreed on in restoration projects pro-
posed by the Grand Canyon Forest Partner-
ship (Coughlan 2003).
Whereas Abella et al. (2006) used a di-
ameter cap of 16 in. to simulate the effect of
the cap on restoration treatments, Kalies and
Rosenstock
(2013)
used
proxy
stands
treated historically (not with a restoration
prescription) to examine the effect of large
trees on breeding birds, and Triepke et al.
(2011) simulated a 16-in. diameter cap
across the entire Southwest to explore the
effects of diameter caps on desired condi-
tions. However, there remains a general lack
of knowledge on the effects of diameter caps
on stand structure and other forest re-
sources. The large-scale restoration-style
treatments to be implemented under the
4FRI represent an opportunity to use cur-
rent stand data and an actual prescription to
understand more about the implications of
diameter caps on a variety of forest re-
sources. Long-term monitoring proposed
Management and Policy Implications
Meeting multiple resource objectives is paramount to large, landscape-scale forest restoration projects. This
is particularly evident as the Four Forest Restoration Initiative, the nation’s largest Collaborative Forest
Landscape Restoration project, makes plans to accelerate restoration of northern Arizona’s ponderosa pine
forests. Central to public land management efforts in the western United States has been the debate
around potential loss of large trees, resulting in widespread adoption of size-prohibited cutting (“diameter
caps”). In this study, we explored the implications of diameter caps on multiple resources through model
simulations under a wide range of possible diameter caps (12–30 in.). Using the Forest Vegetation
Simulator, we found that application of small diameter caps commonly resulted in increased biomass
availability yet did not achieve reductions in crown ﬁre hazard or increases in understory production. In
addition, application of smaller caps shortens treatment longevity, placing a larger importance on
maintenance, and adversely affects ﬁre managers’ ability to utilize prescribed ﬁre or offset treatment costs
with product revenues. When diameter cap scenarios are compared, tradeoffs exist, and the inability of
a single metric to evaluate “success” is further decreased by social and political values, which further limits
public land managers’ ability to integrate management alternatives.

posttreatment (B), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest conditions in the southwestern

changes in structure, composition, and function are the primary goals of landscape-scale
collaborative efforts to restore forest ecosystems, such as the 4FRI in northern Arizona.

under the 4FRI will provide future empirical
data to support or refute modeling results.
Whereas in this study we make no effort
to resolve the social/political debate associ-
ated with diameter caps, we do seek to
quantitatively explore the implications of di-
ameter caps by examining multiple forest re-
source responses through the use of model
simulations under a wide range of possible
diameter caps (12–30 in.) in the context of
the most common prescription proposed
within a portion of the 4FRI treatment area
(USDA Forest Service 2013). Our goal was
to examine the response of forest overstory
structural characteristics, herbaceous pro-
duction, ﬁre behavior, scenic beauty, and
water yield to different prescription scenar-
ios as inﬂuenced by a diameter cap.
Methods
Site Location, Stand Selection, and
Current Conditions
Our population of interest is the pon-
derosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)-dominated
forests of the Coconino National Forest
(CNF), a 1.8-million acre landscape located
within the larger, 2.4-million acre 4FRI
landscape in northern Arizona (Figure 2).
Given that supporters for diameter caps of-
ten cite the deﬁciency in large trees as a ra-
tionale for imposing diameter cap restric-
tions, we decided to focus on stands within
the CNF where the possibility of large tree
(16 in. dbh) removal was possible. This
was done by ﬁltering the available stands
(22,537 stands [843,608 acres]) to include
only those that met the following criteria:
• Vegetation Structural Stage 4 (Reyn-
olds et al. 1992): Ensuring conditions where
the majority of the trees present ranged from
12.0 to 17.9 in.
• Tree Canopy Density Category B
(McCusker 2013): Ensuring conditions
where the majority of the stands had a mod-
erate canopy cover.
• A single canopy layer: Avoiding con-
ditions where the stand is composed of mul-
tiple strata, thus avoiding simulation where
remnant, old trees might be cut.
Stands meeting these conditions were
found to range in elevation from 6,300 to
just under 8,000 ft and were all located pri-
marily in ponderosa pine-dominated forests.
In addition to ponderosa pine, these forests
often include a mixture of Gambel oak
(Quercus gambelii) and alligator juniper (Ju-
niperus deppeana) at lower elevations and dry
mixed-conifer at higher elevations. These
dry mixed-conifer forests are similar to pon-
derosa pine forests in general stand struc-
ture, but also feature Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudot-
suga menziesii var. glauca), white ﬁr (Abies
concolor), southwestern white pine (Pinus
strobiformis), and occasionally blue spruce
(Picea pungens). Understories tend to be
dominated by grasses and sedges such as blue
grama (Bouteloua gracilis), White Mountain
sedge (Carex geophila), squirreltail (Elymus
elymoides), Arizona fescue (Festuca ari-
zonica), and mountain muhly (Muhlenber-
gia montana) (Miller et al. 1995).
In these systems, half of the annual pre-
cipitation occurs in winter as snow and
much of the rest occurs in July through Sep-
tember as monsoonal storms. The average
annual precipitation around Flagstaff, Ari-
zona, is 22 in., with 58% of the precipitation
falling during the winter and spring (Octo-
ber through April) and 28% falling during
the summer, particularly in July and August
(Western Regional Climate Center 2013).
Soils, derived from tertiary basalt ﬂows and
cinders, are commonly classiﬁed as a com-
plex of ﬁne, smectitic Typic Argiborolls and
Eutroboralfs, Lithic Eutroboralfs, and Mol-
lic Eutroboralfs, primarily of a clay loam or
loam texture (Buol 1966, Miller et al. 1995).
Speciﬁcally, the site index (Minor 1964) for
stands that met the above criteria ranged be-
tween 75 and 100 ft (at a base age of 100
years) and averaged 83 ft ( 7.25 ft), tree
density ranged between 30 and 354 and av-
eraged 144 trees acre1, and mean tree size
(quadratic mean diameter [size of tree of av-
erage basal area, inches QMD]) ranged be-
tween 6.4 and 17.5 in. (Table 1). An exam-
ple of stand conditions similar to those used
to initialize simulations and somewhat typi-
cal of untreated conditions within the CNF
is provided in Figure 1A.
Simulation Model
We used the Central Rockies variant of
the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS-CR)
(Dixon 2002), a forest growth-and-yield
simulation model, to examine the stands
that met our selection criteria. The FVS-CR
is commonly used for evaluating alternative
treatment effects on forest stand dynamics
throughout the United States. It is a deter-
ministic individual-tree, distance-indepen-
dent growth-and-yield simulation model
with linkable modules called extensions.
These extensions allow for the simulation of
various ﬁre effects, fuel loading, snag dy-
namics, development of understory vegeta-
tion, and for the computation of additional
stand-level attributes. The FVS-CR can sim-
ulate a wide variety of forest types, stand
structures, and pure or mixed-species stands
Sidebar 1. What Is a “Diameter Cap” and Why Do We Care?
In the western United States and particularly on public forestlands undergoing
fuels reduction or restoration treatments, diameter caps represent a tree diameter
threshold (typically >16 in. dbh [4.5 ft. above ground level] in Southwestern
ponderosa pine stands) above which trees are not designated for harvest. In the
eastern United States and in most parts of the world, the inverse is true: diameter
limits deﬁne a minimum tree size to be harvested (Helms 1998). Diameter limit
harvesting is commodity driven, with the exact diameter limits reﬂecting local and
regional markets for wood products. For example, in the eastern United States, 12
in. is a common dbh threshold for small hardwood sawtimber. In the western
United States, use of a ﬁxed diameter to guide tree retention is driven primarily by
social values and is thus the subject of debate. Although there is some ecological
basis for retaining large trees in forests (e.g., Luyssaert et al. 2008, Knapp and
Soule´ 2011), proponents of ﬁxed diameter caps also value large trees for aesthetics
and the belief that they have a unique role in the ecosystem and thus advocate for
the retention of all large trees during forest treatments (Abella et al. 2006). Oppo-
nents of diameter caps often argue for the removal of some large, young trees,
especially in cases where the resulting structure (after thinning with diameter cap)
remains susceptible to crown ﬁre or the spread of dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium
spp.). Another approach that has been proposed is to use tree age rather than size
in establishing caps, because old trees may perform some ecosystem functions that
young, large trees do not (Franklin and Johnson 2012, Reynolds et al. 2013).
Acquiring accurate tree age data, however, is much more time intensive than
measuring tree diameter.

(Keyser and Dixon 2008). Based on our ex-
perience with the model, we believed that
using the FVS-CR would help us under-
stand the impact of diameter caps on current
and future forest stands as well as the trajec-
tory of multiple forest resources from 2010
to 2100. The tree growth-and-yield model
in the FVS-CR is based on the generalized
growth and yield model (GENGYM) (Ed-
minster et al. 1991), which was built using
continuous forest inventory data from Ari-
zona and New Mexico. The FVS-CR was
used in a deterministic manner to quantify
common forest structural metrics such as
tree density, basal area, total tree volume,
QMD, canopy cover, snag density (a common
indicator of wildlife habitat), and relative (per-
centage of maximum) density index.
Model Runs, Parameterization, and
Response Attributes
We ran the FVS-CR to simulate treat-
ments proposed for the 4FRI area under six
diameter cap scenarios (12, 16, 20, and 24
Figure 2. Study area map illustrating the general location of stands sampled within the CNF (shaded purple) and 4FRI (blue line) boundaries
in northern Arizona.

in., as well as a “no treatment” scenario and
a 30-in. cap scenario representing an ap-
proximate “no cap” scenario). For the vast
majority of these acres on the Coconino and
Kaibab National Forests within the 4FRI
project boundary (Figure 2), the Forest Ser-
vice has proposed uneven-aged (individual
tree and group selection) treatments to es-
tablish interspaces between individual trees
and tree groups, thin tree groups, and create
regeneration openings. In addition, speciﬁc
objectives include the following: target aver-
age basal area of 50 to 70 ft2 per acre; retain
and sustain old forest structure; and pro-
mote spatial heterogeneity and discontinu-
ity of canopy fuels (USDA Forest Service
2013).
In an effort to replicate model simula-
tions commonly used locally by practitio-
ners, FVS-CR parameter ﬁles were obtained
from the 4FRI personnel and modiﬁed to
explore multiple resource responses to vary-
ing degrees of diameter caps. Parameters
used to simulate these treatments by the
4FRI personnel and thus used in this study
are summarized in Table 2.
Speciﬁcally, model runs began in 2010,
included one thinning treatment (simulated
in 2011) and two prescribed ﬁre treatments
(simulated in 2013 and 2019) and were 90
years in length. The simulated thinning re-
moved trees from below and proportionally
from each diameter class with a target total
stand density index of 100 (THINSDI key-
words). The prescribed ﬁres in 2013 and
2019 were simulated as low-intensity ﬁre
(SIMFIRE keyword, mortality decreasing as
tree size increases; see Table 2). The maxi-
mum stand density index (SDI) for pon-
derosa pine was set at 450 (Long and Shaw
2005). Sprouting was turned off, and pon-
derosa pine regeneration was simulated after
disturbances using the Sorensen et al. (2011)
equation, in which predicted regeneration
density is a function of the difference be-
tween pre- and postdisturbance (thin or pre-
scribed ﬁre) tree density.
We predicted mean tree size using
QMD and stand-level density and stocking
using basal area (ft2 acre1), total volume
(ft3 acre1), and relative density index
(RDI). To calculate RDI, we ﬁrst calculated
SDI and compared it with the maximum
SDI of 450 for ponderosa pine. We also
evaluated mean canopy cover (%) and snag
density (trees acre1). We evaluated crown
ﬁre potential and behavior using the crown-
ing index (windspeed necessary to sustain a
crown ﬁre once a ﬁre has reached the main
canopy) and the torching index (windspeed
required for passive crown ﬁre or tree torch-
ing) (Scott and Reinhardt 2001) because as-
sumptions regarding crown base height and
fuel loading would probably have heavily in-
ﬂuenced interpretation of other ﬁre behavior
variables (e.g., ﬂame length). The crowning
and torching indices were calculated using
the Fire and Fuels Extension (FFE) to the
FVS-CR (Reinhardt and Crookston 2003,
Rebain 2010).
We also modeled herbage production,
near-view scenic beauty, and water yield.
For herbage production, we used the model
developed by Bojorquez Tapia et al. (1990),
which predicts herbaceous production (lb
acre1) as a function of ponderosa pine basal
area. Near-view scenic beauty was estimated
using equations developed by Schroeder and
Daniel (1981) to obtain an index of scenic
beauty calculated as a function of the num-
ber of large (16 in. dbh) and midsized
(5–16 in. dbh) trees, quantity of logging
slash, amount of herbage, and number of
shrubs. We estimated water yield with the
newly available FVS-WRENSS Water Yield
postprocessor for FVS-CR (for similar appli-
cations, see Huff et al. 1999 and Troendle et
al. 2010), which only allows for model runs
of 40 years (thus evaluated out to 2050).
Finally, using a single representative stand
(identiﬁcation no. 000094000304), we com-
pared treatments visually using diameter dis-
tributions through time and the Stand Visu-
alization System (McGaughey 1997). The
Stand Visualization System does not have
the capacity to produce an average simula-
tion across multiple stands; thus we chose to
simulate just one representative stand.
Results
In the no-treatment scenarios, our pro-
jections showed increases in mean tree size,
stand-level basal area and volume, canopy
cover, snag density, and RDI (Figure 3; Ta-

ble 3). Both ﬁre behavior variables (average
crowning and torching indices) increased
through time. Mean tree density decreased,
as did water yield and herbaceous produc-
tion (Table 3). Scenic beauty was variable,
ﬁrst increasing and then decreasing by 2100
(Figure 3; Table 3); a similar pattern was
seen in RDI, although the changes were less
abrupt. Increases in RDI indicate high inter-
tree competition, leading to mortality by
2050. Such mortality ultimately reduced
scenic beauty.
In the treatment scenarios, some trends
appeared regardless of the size of the diame-
ter cap. For instance, tree density decreased
(Figure 3A), whereas QMD increased (Fig-
ure 3C). Basal area, canopy cover, snag den-
sity, and RDI all decreased in the short-term
followed by longer-term increases (Figure
3B, F, I, and H). Conversely, scenic beauty,
water yield, and herbaceous production
showed short-term increases followed by
longer-term decreases (Figure 3J, K, and L).
Water yield projections were similar to those
observed before treatment by 2060 (Figure
3K). Total volume decreased or was ﬂat ini-
tially, followed by long-term increases (Fig-
ure 3G). Torching index either increased
steadily through time or remained ﬂat in the
short term but increased over longer time
periods (Figure 3D).
Generally speaking, smaller caps re-
sulted in conditions more closely resembling
those observed in untreated conditions,
whereas larger caps resulted in conditions
with the highest deviation from the un-
treated conditions (Figures 4 and 5). On the
other hand, some variables, such as crown-
ing index and scenic beauty, exhibited sen-
sitivity to treatment (i.e., exhibited greater
differences between diameter caps scenar-
ios), as well as large projected changes over
time (Table 3E, K and L; Figure 3E, K, and
L). Midrange diameter caps (16, 20, and 24
in.) produced no differences for some vari-
ables, such as basal area (Figure 3B), canopy
cover (Figure 3F), and diameter distribution
(Figure 4). Figures 4 and 5 show the diam-
eter distribution and a visual comparison of
all diameter cap scenarios through time for
the same representative stand.

Discussion
Implications of Diameter Caps on
Simulated Multiple Resource
Responses
Our simulations suggest that the imple-
mentation of a 12-in. diameter cap com-
pared with that of a 30-in. diameter cap (the
two extreme treatment scenarios) could re-
sult in lower tree densities and higher basal
area, QMD, canopy cover, total volume,
and RDI. Lower tree densities probably re-
sult because the model assumes that an equal
number of trees are removed from each size
class; thus, more small trees (i.e., ladder fu-
els) are removed in a 12-in. diameter cap
scenario. This is most obvious when simu-
lated diameter distributions immediately af-
ter treatment (Figure 4B) are compared with
those observed at the end of simulation (Fig-
ure 4D). Notably, when the 12-in. diameter
cap is compared with any larger diameter
cap, model simulations suggest that manag-
ers have more ﬂexibility (i.e., for diameter
caps 12 in., trees under the diameter cap
can be retained while still meeting manage-
ment objectives). Although conditions at
the end of the simulation period (2100) dif-
fer little for diameter caps of 20 in., those
with smaller diameter caps (12 and 16 in.)
ultimately may result in more even-aged dis-
tributions. Small differences in tree cover
(canopy cover and basal area) were observed
despite long simulation periods. Although
no treatment and treatments with diameter
caps of 20 in. resulted in simulations that
reached the same local maximum, the 12-
and 16-in. diameter caps behaved differently
(asymptote sooner; e.g., Figure 3B and F).
This modeling result is probably con-
founded by the simulated retention of many
more large trees and the nonspatial methods
FVS uses to calculate canopy cover (for a
detailed description, see Crookston and
Stage 1999).
Crowning index was higher in the 30-
in. scenario than in the 12-in. scenario, sug-
gesting that if a ﬁre were to start it would
probably not have the wind speed necessary
to carry it through the canopy in the 30-in.
scenario; thus these is a potential reduction
in the hazard of a stand-replacing ﬁre. Sim-
ilarly, scenic beauty was higher in the 12-in
scenario because of the removal of ladder fu-
els, which detract from visual appeal, but
water yield and herbaceous production were
higher in the 30-in. scenario because of the
reduced canopy cover. These simulated
changes in the 12-in. scenario suggest a con-
tinued shift toward a more closed canopy
forest structure and the likely creation of
wildlife habitat preferred by the tassel-eared
squirrel (Sciurus aberti), bark beetles (Den-
droctonus and Ips spp.), and Grace’s warbler
(Setophaga graciae) (Zausen et al. 2005,
Dodd et al. 2006, Dickson et al. 2009). The
literature on diameter caps is scarce but in-
dicates similar effects of smaller diameter
caps in terms of wildlife habitat and ﬁre haz-
ard (Larson and Mirth 2001, Coughlan
2003, Abella et al. 2006, Triepke et al. 2011,
Kalies and Rosenstock 2013). In a similar
simulation exercise, Triepke et al. (2011)
concluded that the indirect effects of a diam-
eter cap in ponderosa pine and dry mixed-
conifer systems typically result in increased
ﬁre hazard and a change in habitat diversity
associated with shifts toward shade-tolerant,
ﬁre-intolerant tree species and increased tree
densities. Kalies and Rosenstock (2013) at-
tempted to look at the effects of diameter
caps by examining avian community re-
sponses to different sizes of trees; they found
that most species were negatively associated
with 16–18 in. dbh trees and positively as-
sociated with large trees (18 in. dbh) and
lower canopy cover.
Implications of Diameter Caps on
Simulated Management Alternatives
Determining the “best” treatment de-
pends on the speciﬁc objectives at the site.
For example, simulation results suggest that
the 12-in. diameter cap might be a prefer-
able compromise between wood ﬁber
production and fuels reduction objectives
(i.e., maximizing cubic foot volume accre-
tion while reducing ladder and canopy fuels
in the short term), because it results in the
highest basal area and volume of all the
treatment scenarios and a higher QMD than
no treatment. However, from a wildﬁre haz-
ard reduction or potential perspective, the
simulated 30-in. diameter cap may prove to
be a better option, because of the observed
increase in simulated crowning index. In the
case of the 4FRI, the stated objectives of the
treatments include maintaining a stand basal
area of 50–70 ft2 acre1, retaining old forest
structure, and promoting spatial heteroge-

neity and discontinuity of canopy fuels (de-
picted in Figure 1B). From this perspective,
simulation of the 30-in. diameter cap would
probably be the preferred scenario, because
it resulted in the lowest basal area (and the
only treatment to achieve the basal area tar-
get), the lowest percent canopy cover and
the highest herbaceous production, imply-
ing that potential similarities to old pon-
derosa pine forest structure (Covington and
Moore 1994) may exist, and the highest sim-
ulated crowning index, indicating a poten-
tial discontinuity of the canopy. In addition
to beginning to move the stand from even-
aged to uneven-aged conditions (albeit it
will not truly be uneven-aged without mul-
tiple entries simulated), this scenario had the
added beneﬁt of producing the highest sim-
ulated water yield.
From a wildlife perspective, observed
reductions in canopy cover and increased
herbaceous productivity would have a posi-
tive effect on many bird and small mammal
species in Arizona ponderosa pine forests
(Dickson et al. 2009, Kalies et al. 2012, Ka-
lies and Rosenstock 2013). Conversely, this
scenario also had the lowest snag density;
snags are thought to be generally beneﬁcial
to wildlife (Rabe et al. 1998, Pope et al.
2009) and speciﬁcally beneﬁcial to cavity-
nesters at diameters 8 in. and preferably
18 in. (Scott and Oldemeyer 1983). On
the other hand, many of the effects predicted
by the various diameter cap scenarios dimin-
ish with time; for example, by 2100 there is
no difference between simulated diameter
cap scenarios in terms of tree density, can-
opy cover, snag density, crowning index,
scenic beauty, and herbaceous production.
This observation underscores the impor-
tance of maintenance or repeated treatment
simulation and/or the simulated reintroduc-
tion of ﬁre in these systems to achieve lasting
effects. This lasting effect is a management
consideration
that
the
4FRI
mentions
(repeated prescribed ﬁre at 2029, 2039, and
2049) but did not report in their analyses
(USDA Forest Service 2013).
Considerations and Limitations of a
Simulation Modeling Approach
Although the results from this model-
ing study provide valuable insights into
long-term changes in multiple resources
with and without diameter caps, it is impor-
tant to note that these simulations do not
incorporate the effects of spatial heterogene-
ity or spatially explicit silvicultural treat-
ments, alternative treatments to those pro-
posed by the 4FRI, or outcomes due to
climate change.
The FVS is a deterministic model that
can be programmed to simulate treatments

potential inﬂuence of ﬁve diameter cap scenarios (12, 16, 20, 24, and 30 in.) on forest structure and resource responses over a 90-year
simulation period.

to assist in evaluating alternative treatment
effects on forest stand dynamics. However,
users need to be aware of model behavior
regarding stocking density, tree senescence,
and understory recruitment because during
long projections, FVS tends to concentrate
substantial growth on few survivor trees.
Furthermore, FVS does not model spatially
explicit actions or silvicultural treatments,
and the results should be interpreted with
caution, noting that the projections lack the
ability to adequately model the most ac-
cepted treatment types (i.e., group selection
harvest) observed in the Southwest. Van-
dendriesche (2010) provides an excellent di-
alogue on the nuances of parameterizing
FVS and outlines additional considerations.
Second, we do not make any attempt to
model treatment alternatives aside from
those exploring the effects of diameter caps.
For this reason, alternative and model pa-
rameters were largely held constant. Results
should be interpreted as so, paying special
consideration to the inﬂuences of diameter
caps under different management scenarios,
adjustment in model parameters and as-
sumptions, the inﬂuence of inventory con-
ditions on simulation results, and potential
changes resulting from regional variant dif-
ferences. As is common with all modeling
approaches, outcomes different from those
reported in this simulation study may result,
and caution should be used when interpret-
ing results.
Last, it is likely that the changes re-
ported here after treatments with diameter
caps would display important differences
under different climate scenarios. These
could include increases in tree mortality due
to competition, drought, insects, pathogens,
or the interactions of these factors with in-
creases in wildﬁre size and severity (Garﬁn et
al. 2013, Yue et al. 2013). However, it is also
likely that predicted changes in climate will
result in lower projected basal areas and tree
densities, less stand volume and herbage
production, lower crowning indices, and
possibly higher snag densities than those re-
ported in this study (Allen et al. 2010,
Ganey and Vojta 2012).
Conclusions
The results presented in this study dem-
onstrate that diameter caps can affect treat-
ments when evaluated using multiple re-
source responses. Furthermore, these effects
are temporal in nature and a long-term per-
spective (50 years) is required to clearly
evaluate the effects of diameter caps. Stand-
level characteristics such as crowning index

and scenic beauty appear to be more sensi-
tive (i.e., exhibited greater differences be-
tween diameter cap scenarios) to treatment
effects compared with the limited response
of metrics such as tree densities, basal area,
and canopy cover (and associated dependent
resource functions like herbaceous produc-
tion) to treatments with diameter caps.
When the diameter cap scenarios are com-
pared, tradeoffs exist between different man-
agement priorities such as timber harvesting,
ﬁre prevention and suppression, wildlife
habitat improvement, water yield, and aes-
thetic values. From an economic standpoint,
diameter caps are likely to be more expensive
to implement and yield less biomass, partic-
ularly for smaller diameter caps (Larson and
Mirth 2001). However, our models indicate
that larger diameter caps would be prefera-
ble if the management priorities include re-
ducing basal area, retaining old forest struc-
ture, and promoting spatial heterogeneity,
as in the case of the 4FRI.
Disruptions of natural disturbance re-
gimes combined with major changes in
land-use patterns have led to southwestern
forest ecosystems that bear little resemblance
to their known condition before Euro-
American settlement. However, the density
of large trees across the landscape is highly
variable and likely to determine the exact
outcome of diameter cap implementation
(Abella et al. 2006). Likewise, conditions
immediately after treatment may not be in-
dicative of long-term effects on forest re-
sources, necessitating long-term monitoring
and ﬁeld research (Abella et al. 2006). Thus,
desired conditions, wildlife habitat, and multi-
ple use management objectives based solely on
current stand structure after treatments with
diameter caps may not be compatible with the
conservation goals such as increasing species
diversity and reducing wildﬁre potential. Fur-
thermore, rarely can a single resource or metric
incorporate the full suite of treatment alterna-
tives and tradeoffs. The inability of a single
metric to evaluate “success” is further de-
creased by the application of social and po-
litical values such as diameter caps, which
limit options for managers.
