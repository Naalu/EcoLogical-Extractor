Summary
1. Climatic constraints on plant distributions are well known, but predicting community composi-
tion through knowledge of trait-based environmental ﬁltering remains an important empirical chal-
lenge. Here, we evaluate the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model of trait-based community
assembly using forest communities occurring along a 12 C gradient of mean annual temperature
(MAT).We use independent cross-validation to evaluate model predictions from sites where trait
constraints are predicted from environmental conditions. We also test whether orthogonal axes of
trait variation can be used as predictors to improve model parsimony and explore MaxEnt forecasts
of species distributions in a warmer climate.
2. Environmental factors explained between 31% and 74% of the community-weighted mean trait
values, indicating moderate-to-strong selection of traits along the environmental gradients. A
model with 10 traits explained 54% of the variation in observed relative abundances, which
approached the upper limit of 57% given the available environmental information. Three orthogo-
nal axes accounted for 81% of the trait variation among species, and environmental factors
explained between 47% and 67% of the variation in these axes. However, the axes only explained
18% of the variation in relative abundances, suggesting that minor axes of functional variation may
be important or that models with many traits may achieve good predictive capacity through over-
ﬁtting.
3. Trait–environment relationships formed the basis for predicting vegetation change in a future
scenario where MAT was increased by 2.5 C. The results suggested that up to 78% of Pinus pon-
derosa forest in Arizona may transition to dominance by Juniperus monosperma, but this forecast
likely overestimates the rates of species migration.
4. Synthesis. MaxEnt is a mathematical translation of trait-based environmental ﬁltering of the spe-
cies pool and performs moderately well in predicting forest community structure using empirical
trait–environment relationships. MaxEnt required many traits to achieve good ﬁts, and three
orthogonal axes of trait variation performed poorly as predictors of community structure. To be
useful predictors, traits must vary strongly among species and community-weighted mean traits
must vary predictably along environmental gradients.

Introduction
Climate exerts strong control over the distribution of vegeta-
tion, and climate change will likely alter these distributions
(Lenoir et al. 2008). Species ranges are geographically con-
strained in large part because phenotypic properties (i.e. func-
tional traits) of plants limit the range of environments in which
they can sequester resources for growth and survival (Violle
et al. 2007). For example, trees with high wood density have a
greater resistance to drought-induced cavitation (Hacke et al.
2001) and will therefore have a higher ﬁtness (or performance)
in hot, dry environments than trees with low wood density.
Many species distribution models primarily use bioclimatic

envelopes (Pearson & Dawson 2003) and other environmental
factors (Guisan & Zimmermann 2000) as direct predictors of
species occurrences (Fig. 1) and do not attempt to explain dis-
tributions based on a physiological mechanism, such as the
wood density–climate relationship (Hacke et al. 2001).
A trait-based approach may simultaneously provide predic-
tive and explanatory ability because it speciﬁes how perfor-
mance ﬁlters alter trait distributions (Fig. 1; Keddy 1992;
Webb et al. 2010). This approach assumes that individuals
with traits that confer high performance in a given environ-
ment will be able to sequester a greater proportion of limited
resources for growth and reproduction. From these ﬁrst princi-
ples, a predictive model of community assembly can be built
by developing equations where species relative abundances (pi)
are the unknowns for which we will have to solve. Shipley, Vile
& Garnier (2006) proposed that the vector of pi’s can be esti-
mated by developing a system of linear constraint equations of
the general form PS
i¼1 tipi ¼ T. This equation states that the
linear combination of species traits (ti) and unknown species
relative abundances (pi) is equal to the constraint T, where T is
the trait value of an average unit of biomass (or individual,
depending on how relative abundance is quantiﬁed) in a com-
munity. It is biased towards trait values conferring better per-
formance
in
a
given
environment
because
individuals
possessing such traits are more abundant. T can vary predict-
ably along environmental gradients (e.g. Cingolani et al. 2007)
because traits have been selected along environmental gradi-
ents over evolutionary history (Ackerly et al. 2000). Webb
et al. (2010) referred to this step in trait-based modelling as the
‘performance ﬁlter’, because local environments eliminate
traits with inadequate local ﬁtness (Fig. 1).
Most previous evaluations of the maximum entropy (Max-
Ent) model have used ‘observed constraints’ by calculating
T from observed relative abundances (Shipley, Vile & Garnier
2006; Sonnier, Shipley & Navas 2010). These studies showed
that the model can make good predictions, but a more general
and desirable application of the model is to predict vegetation
structure in communities where mean trait values are predicted
from environmental conditions (Shipley, Vile & Garnier 2006).
In this study, we use ‘predicted constraints’, such that
T ¼ fðenvironmentÞ, thus providing a strong empirical test of
the model. This also eliminates any apparent circularity in the
model (Marks & Muller-Landau 2007; Roxburgh & Mokany
2007; Haegeman & Loreau 2008). This approach is also more
general than classic species distribution modelling (Guisan &
Zimmermann 2000) because it considers simultaneously the
probability of occurrence of every species in the regional pool,
not just the distribution of species that actually occur at a site
(Shipley 2010b).
The MaxEnt model states that the relative abundance of
every species in a given environment is a function of their trait
values [i.e. log(pi) = f (traits)]. However, many traits are
highly correlated with each other (Wright et al. 2004), and col-
linear predictors in any model have undesirable properties
(Webb et al. 2010). Variation among leaf traits is largely
orthogonal to variation in stem traits (Baraloto et al. 2010),
suggesting that a few parsimonious and independent axes of
functional trait variation may be useful predictors of commu-
nity structure. Here, we provide the ﬁrst test of whether
orthogonal trait axes are useful predictors of community com-
position.
We tested the MaxEnt model of trait-based community
assembly (Shipley, Vile & Garnier 2006) along a broad climatic
gradient in upland forest communities of the south-western
USA. We asked (i) how do traits and orthogonal trait axes
vary along climatic gradients? and (ii) How well does MaxEnt
utilize these empirical trait–environment relationships to
predict forest community structure? We also explored the use
of MaxEnt for forecasting shifts in species distributions in a
warmer climate.
Materials and methods
STUDY SYSTEM
We measured tree species abundances on 1046 plots at 19 sites in Ari-
zona and New Mexico, USA. These sites spanned upland vegetation
between 1900 and 3600 m altitude, corresponding to a 12 C range in
mean annual temperature (MAT). These sites spanned the range of
high-elevation upland south-western USA forest types including
conifer woodlands, montane conifer forests and subalpine forests
(Brown 2004). We encountered 15 tree species in these upland com-
munities (Table 1). We calculated relative abundances of each of the
15 species as the proportional basal area (at breast height, 1.37 m) of
each of the species divided by the total basal area of the plot. See
Appendix S1 in Supporting Information for more details about the
forest vegetation samples.
FUNCTIONAL TRAITS AND TRAIT AXES
We measured functional traits thought to inﬂuence plant perfor-
mance along climatic gradients on all 15 species following standard-
ized protocols (see Appendix S1 for full details).We measured stem
traits, such as wood density and twig dry matter content (TDMC),
because of their known relationships with water transport and effects
on plant survival along moisture gradients (Hacke et al. 2001; Corn-
well & Ackerly 2010). Maximum plant height is also related to
climatic gradients because shorter trees are often associated with
more
stressful
environments
(King
1990).We
measured
bark
thickness because it is known to inﬂuence tree survival following
Fig. 1. A trait-based approach to predicting species abundances
explicitly incorporates a physiology-based link between the local
environment and species abundances. The classic approach to species
distribution modelling lacks a physiological linkage.

low-intensity surface ﬁres (Vines 1968) and because ﬁre regimes vary
predictably along the climatic gradient in this study (Agee 1993).We
measured leaf traits that inﬂuence resource acquisition, such as spe-
ciﬁc leaf area (SLA) and leaf nutrient concentrations, because they
have been shown to vary along global climate gradients (Wright et al.
2004). We measured speciﬁc root length (SRL) because it may inﬂu-
ence below-ground resource acquisition (Cornelissen et al. 2003).
Finally, we obtained information on ﬂowering dates of species
because the timing of ﬂowering is constrained by growing season
length (Rathcke & Lacey 1985). We also measured seed mass and leaf
dry matter content of each species, but these traits were excluded from
the analysis because they were only weakly related to climate.
The trait values used in the analysis are species-speciﬁc means that
are assumed to be constant over plots. This is a reasonable assump-
tion because interspeciﬁc trait variation is generally stronger than
intraspeciﬁc variation (see Appendix S1). For example, species iden-
tity explains 94% of the variation in leaf nitrogen concentration and
50% of the variation in bark thickness.
We used principal components analysis (PCA) to extract orthogo-
nal axes of trait variation for use in the MaxEnt model. After comput-
ing the initial eigenvectors, we rotated the axes to maximize trait
loadings on each axis via ‘varimax’ rotation to increase interpretabil-
ity of the axes (see Appendix S1). A constant was added to the rotated
axis scores so that scores were non-negative, as this is a requirement
of the Improved Iterative Scaling algorithm (Della Pietra, Della
Pietra & Lafferty 1997).
CLIMATE AND SOILS
Given the complex topography of the study region, we included vari-
ables that relate to macroclimate, mesoclimate and soil resource
availability as predictors of trait distributions. To quantify macrocli-
mate, we used the 1-km resolution WorldClim climate grids (Hijmans
et al. 2005) to obtain estimates of current MAT. Given this rather
coarse resolution for a mountainous landscape, use of these modelled
estimates of MAT introduces a source of uncertainty into the model.
We did not include mean annual precipitation (MAP) as a predictor
because it was strongly negatively correlated with temperature
(r = )0.78), and because changes in precipitation under climate
change are far less certain (IPCC 2007).To quantify the inﬂuence of
topography on mesoclimate, we used equations for estimating solar
radiation from topographical slope, aspect and latitude (McCune &
Keon 2002). To capture the inﬂuence of soil type on soil moisture and
nutrient availability, we used a binary variable to differentiate plots
on coarse-textured sedimentary-derived soils from ﬁne-textured igne-
ous-derived soils. The highest elevation site (i.e. San Francisco Peaks)
consists of only igneous-derived soil because it is a stratovolcano.
PERFORMANCE FILTER
We used independent cross-validation to provide a strong test of the
MaxEnt model. We split the data set in half by stratifying by forest
type and randomly dividing within each stratum. Strata were used to
ensure that enough plots from less-common forest types (e.g. subal-
pine forests) were included in the model building process. We used
512 plots (the ‘training data set’) to develop relationships between
environmental predictors and traits, and used 534 plots (the ‘valida-
tion data set’) to evaluate model predictions. This approach addresses
previous criticisms of the model, because model constraints are
derived independently through knowledge of environmental condi-
tions and are therefore not dependent on observed vegetation struc-
ture (Roxburgh & Mokany 2007).
We calculated community-weighted mean traits as T ¼ PS
i¼1 tipi,
where ti is the mean trait value and pi are the observed relative abun-
dances for species i from 1, …, S. We used generalized additive mod-
els [GAMs; using the ‘gam’ function in the ‘mgcv’ library in r (Wood

2006; R Development Core Team 2010)] on the training data set to
develop predictive models of community-weighted mean traits as
nonlinear functions of MAT, solar radiation and soil type. We ranked
models for each trait from high-to-low predictive capacity assessed by
the model R2
adj and used this order for entering traits into the MaxEnt
model.
EVALUATING THE MAXENT MODEL
Using the GAMs developed from the training data set, we predicted
the community-weighted mean trait values ( T) in the validation data
set. These predicted community-weighted mean traits were then used
as constraints in the MaxEnt model. If the species pool has been iden-
tiﬁed and if the traits of every species are known, then one can solve
for the unknown species abundances. In practice, there are typically
far fewer constraint equations than unknown species abundances,
which results in a system with many possible solutions. Shipley, Vile
& Garnier (2006) proposed to select the solution with MaxEnt, i.e.
the distribution that maximizes the entropy function,  PS
i¼1 pi ln pi.
Entropy maximization is justiﬁed because the MaxEnt solution (i) is
the distribution of pi that can be realized in nature the most ways;
therefore, it is the most probable distribution and (ii) is the only distri-
bution of pi that is determined entirely from the speciﬁed constraints,
without implying additional constraints (Jaynes 2003).
We ﬁrst obtained the MaxEnt predictions using the one trait that
was best predicted by the GAMs. We subsequently tested other mod-
els where the two most predictable traits were used, then the four
most predictable traits, etc., up until all 10 traits were used as con-
straints in the model. We evaluated the impact of this order on model
performance by running another analysis in reverse order, i.e. the
least predictable trait was entered ﬁrst. We obtained the MaxEnt pre-
dictions using the ‘maxent’ function in the ‘FD’ library of r (Laliberte´
& Legendre 2010; Laliberte´ & Shipley 2010) with a tolerance level of
1 · 10)8. Uniform prior distributions were used in all instances.
Model predictions were compared with observed relative abundances
using two measures of ﬁt: R2 (using untransformed relative abun-
dances) and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSEsqrt) using square-
root transformed relative abundances (Roxburgh & Mokany 2010).
We evaluated the statistical signiﬁcance of model predictions by com-
paring measures of ﬁt obtained from predicted constraints against a
null distribution of 999 measures of ﬁt obtained by permuting
observed relative abundances (see Appendix S2 for r code). We eval-
uated the statistical signiﬁcance of model predictions obtained from
‘observed constraints’ with a permutation procedure (Shipley 2010a)
that is implemented in the ‘maxent.test’ function in the ‘FD’ library
of r (Laliberte´ & Shipley 2010).
We also used observed and predicted coenoclines to evaluate model
performance. We compared nonlinear regression models (i.e. GAMs)
of species response curves ﬁt to observed relative abundances with
those ﬁt to MaxEnt-predicted relative abundances. This approach
permitted us to compare how the mean predictions of relative abun-
dances compare with mean observed relative abundances along the
temperature gradient.
To estimate the maximum amount of variation in the species rela-
tive abundances that was explainable by climate directly, we ﬁt a sep-
arate GAM relating the observed relative abundance for each of the
15 species as a function of MAT, solar radiation and soil type using
training data, and obtained regression predictions on the validation
data set. Because these form-free statistical ﬁts imposed minimal
assumptions on the relationships between relative abundances and
climate, and because each model was ﬁt separately for each species,
the R2 between regression model-ﬁtted and observed relative abun-
dances represents an approximate upper bound on the predictive abil-
ity of any model whose empirical information is derived from
environmental variables alone.
CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIO
Mean annual temperature in the south-western USA is predicted to
rise over the next century. Given that MaxEnt has been proposed
as a pragmatic tool for providing predictions of relative abundances
of real species in different environmental contexts (Shipley 2010b),
we explore the use of this trait-based model in forecasting shifts in
species distributions in a warmer climate using empirical trait–
climate relationships. Given the variety of global circulation models
and emission scenarios, we focused on the median-predicted tem-
perature change across 21 global models for the A1B scenario,
which is an increase of 2.5 C by the year 2060 (IPCC 2007). Solar
radiation and soil type were unchanged from current conditions in
this scenario. We predicted a new set of community-weighted mean
trait values ( T) at each plot with the new set of predictors, and
these new constraints were used to obtain the MaxEnt predictions
of species relative abundances in the year 2060. For comparison,
we also used the classic species distribution modelling approach to
forecast future species distributions by regressing individual species
abundances directly on the three predictor variables and used these
models to project species responses to an increase of 2.5 C. We
acknowledge that this approach does not incorporate an exhaustive
set of factors that are known to affect species distributions. For
example, changes in precipitation will certainly affect species distri-
butions, but future changes in precipitation are far less certain than
changes in temperature. We discuss our results in the light of the
limitations of this approach.
Results
TRAIT–CLIMATE RELATIONSHIPS
Environmental conditions explained between 31% and 74%
of the variance of the ten community-weighted mean func-
tional traits (Table 1). MAT was a signiﬁcant factor for all
traits, solar radiation was a signiﬁcant factor for all traits
except bark thickness, and geological substrate was a signiﬁ-
cant factor for all traits except leaf [P] (Table S1). MAT
explained most of the trait variation and often exhibited the
strongest bivariate relationship with the traits. Signiﬁcant non-
linear relationships were prevalent between traits and MAT
(Fig. 2). Bark thickness increased with increasing MAT. Flow-
ering date was earlier with increasing MAT. Wood density and
TDMC tended to increase with MAT, although they both
increased slightly at the coldest MAT. Maximum height
peaked at intermediate MAT. SLA, leaf [P] and leaf [N] were
lowest at the extremes of MAT and peaked at c. 4 C MAT.
The ﬁrst three PCA axes accounted for 81% of the species–
trait correlation matrix (Fig. 3). The ﬁrst axis represented vari-
ation in leaf and root traits (SLA, leaf [P], leaf [N] and SRL).
The second axis represented variation in stem traits (TDMC,
bark thickness and wood density). The third axis represented
variation in ﬂowering date and maximum height. Environmen-
tal conditions explained 47%, 60% and 67% of the variation
in the community-weighted mean PCA axis 1, 2 and 3 scores,

respectively. Axes varied nonlinearly with MAT, but, in
general, the ﬁrst and third axes were negatively related to
MAT, and the second axis was positively related to MAT
(Fig. 2).
MAXENT PREDICTIONS
The MaxEnt predictions of relative abundances in the valida-
tion data set were signiﬁcant with only one trait, and predictive
ability increased asymptotically with the number of traits used
in the model (Fig. 4a). The model with one trait explained 8%
of the variance in the relative abundances of all 15 species
(R2 = 0.08, P = 0.001; RMSEsqrt = 0.271, P = 0.001). The
model with 10
traits explained 54% of the variance
(R2 = 0.54, P = 0.001; RMSEsqrt = 0.192, P = 0.001). The
RMSEsqrt ﬁt statistics were never lower than 0.1, but they were
always signiﬁcantly smaller than those obtained through per-
mutation. The order of trait entry into the model inﬂuenced
model performance because explained variance was reduced in
models where the least predictable traits (i.e. leaf traits) were
entered before the most predictable traits (Fig. 4).
The MaxEnt model we tested proposes that climate con-
strains trait distributions, which in turn inﬂuence community
composition (Fig. 1). How much variance in observed relative
abundances can be explained by climate directly? We found
that 57% of the variation of observed relative abundances in
the validation data set could be explained by the climate vari-
ables using 15 separate species-speciﬁc regression models.
Thus, the limit of explained variance as the number of traits
approaches S ) 1 cannot be >57% in this case (this limit is

illustrated by the horizontal dotted line in Fig. 4). The
predictive ability of the MaxEnt model with 10 predicted con-
straints approached that which was possibly given the climate
variables (Fig. 4a), i.e. the MaxEnt model was 95% efﬁcient
(54⁄57 = 0.95) in explaining observed relative abundances
because of trait-based environmental ﬁltering. Models that
used the observed community-weighted mean traits as con-
straints obtained near perfect predictive ability (R2 = 0.94)
using the ﬁrst four traits (Fig. 4a), suggesting that if these traits
could be perfectly predicted from environmental conditions,
then very accurate predictions of species relative abundances
could be achieved with only a restricted number of traits.
MaxEnt models that used PCA trait axes in lieu of individ-
ual traits did not perform well (Fig. 4b). When all three pre-
dicted community-weighted mean PCA axes were used as
constraints, the predictions of species abundances were signiﬁ-
cant, yet only explained 18% of the variance (R2 = 0.18,
P = 0.001; RMSEsqrt = 0.257, P = 0.001). Models that
used three observed community-weighted mean PCA axis
scores accounted for 71% of the variation in observed relative
abundances.
Fitted response curves (i.e. coenocline) of all 15 species along
the elevation gradient were nearly identical between observed
and
MaxEnt-predicted
relative
abundances
(Fig. 5a,b).
Response curves ﬁt through relative abundances predicted
from a classic regression model approach were also very simi-
lar to response curves ﬁt through observed relative abundances
(data not shown). Given that only 54% of the variance of rela-
tive abundances could be explained using the 10 predicted con-
straints, it is somewhat surprising that the MaxEnt model
gives reasonably good predictions of how the mean relative
abundance of individual species changes along the climatic
gradient (Fig. 5b).
CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIO
We obtained the MaxEnt predictions of species relative abun-
dances using the projected increase in MAT of 2.5 C by the
year 2060. Because factors other than MAT were included in

the models used to predict the community-weighted mean
traits, the change in predicted mean trait values and consequent
changes inspecies response curves was not a simple shift ofeach
curve along the elevation gradient: each species responded indi-
vidualistically to increased temperatures (Fig. 5c,d). According
to the model, the forest surrounding Flagstaff, Arizona, is fore-
cast to shift from a Pinus ponderosa-dominated forest to one
thatisdominatedbyJuniperusmonospermaandJ. osteosperma.
The elevation optimum of P. ponderosa is forecast to shift
upward 500 m and attain dominance in the current sites
that support mixed-conifer and subalpine forest. The subal-
pine species (Pinus aristata, Picea engelmannii and Abies la-
siocarpa) were forecast to decline considerably in relative
abundance at the highest elevations. The MaxEnt forecast is
similar, though not identical, to those obtained from a classic
regression approach to forecasting future species distribu-
tions where climate variables were direct predictors of species
abundances (Fig. 5c). Differences between the two forecast-
ing approaches are apparent in the coenoclines (Fig. 5c,d),
but the MaxEnt forecast was signiﬁcantly correlated with the
regression approach (r = 0.56, P = 0.001).
Discussion
Ecologists have long suspected that functional traits play an
important role in community assembly (Schimper 1903),
but the lack of an analytical framework for predicting spe-
cies relative abundances from their traits has hindered pro-

gress in identifying trait-based assembly rules (Keddy 1992).
Shipley, Vile & Garnier (2006) translation of trait-based
environmental ﬁltering into a mathematical model has given
ecologists a new tool for testing the importance of traits in
the assembly process. Given the many factors that control
the assembly process (i.e. population demography, species
interactions, etc.), it seems a tall order for a model based
only on mean trait values to be able to accurately predict
the relative abundances of every species in the species pool.
Our analysis suggests that trait-based environmental ﬁlter-
ing of the regional species pool explains half of the varia-
tion in tree community composition across uplands in the
south-western USA. This is likely a minimum estimate of
the
relative
importance
of
trait-based
species
sorting,
because we may have excluded important traits, we may
have excluded important environmental variables, and we
did not explicitly account for measurement error in either
traits or environmental variables.
Not all traits were equally useful for predicting species
abundances. If the constraints in the MaxEnt model are pre-
dicted from environmental gradients, the traits that are
strongly selected along the gradients will likely be the most
useful for predicting species abundances. Figure 4 illustrates
that if the ﬁrst four traits in the model could be perfectly
predicted from climate (i.e. the predicted values of T  the
observed values of T), then the model would achieve near
perfect predictions of species abundances. However, this was
not the case. Leaf traits accounted for a signiﬁcant amount
of functional variation among the tree species in this study,
but they were not well predicted from climatic conditions
(Table 1, Fig. 2). The performance of the model declined
when leaf traits were entered into the model ﬁrst because
they did not vary predictably along the climatic gradient
(Fig. 4). Shipley et al. (2011) also found that leaf traits, such
as SLA and leaf [N], were poorly predicted from environ-
mental conditions, even though SLA and leaf [N] exhibited
considerable variation among the species in that study
(Laughlin et al. 2010).
This raises a critical issue with respect to trait-based mod-
els of community assembly: traits can only be good predic-
tors of abundance if they vary among species, but traits that
vary strongly among species are not necessarily the best pre-
dictors of relative abundance. Shipley (2010b) described how
the Lagrangian multipliers (k) found in the objective function
of the model provide information about the relative strength
and sign of the selection of a trait along a gradient. Theoreti-
cally, Lagrangian multipliers with large absolute values are
the most important (if traits are scaled to unit variance) for
determining relative abundances in the context of the Max-
Ent model. However, this is only true when model predic-
tions closely match observations, which is often not the case
when ‘predicted constraints’ are used in the model. From a
prediction-oriented perspective, we conclude that when ‘pre-
dicted constraints’ are used in the MaxEnt model, the best
traits for predicting species abundances must both (i) vary
strongly among species and (ii) vary predictably along envi-
ronmental gradients.
Stem traits met both of these conditions. Bark thickness, for
example, varied strongly among species, and it was the most
predictable community-weighted mean trait (Table 1, Fig. 2).
Bark thickness is indirectly related to climate through the
mediating effects of ﬁre regimes. Climate inﬂuences ﬁre
regimes by controlling fuel loadings, fuel moisture and weather
conditions (Westerling et al. 2006). Fires are most frequent in
the pine–oak and lower mixed-conifer forest types (Agee
1993). Species with thick outer bark (e.g. P. ponderosa and
Pseudotsuga menziesii) have greater protection from heat-
induced cambial death (Vines 1968) and will have a higher
probability of growing, reproducing and surviving in a regime
of frequent ﬁres than species with thin outer bark. In contrast,
thin bark is prevalent among species that occur in cold subal-
pine forests (e.g. A. lasiocarpa) that burn very infrequently.
Wood density is another stem trait that was predictable
along the climatic gradient. Following expectations (Hacke
et al. 2001), mean wood density was highest in the hot and dry
pinyon–juniper woodlands and lowest in the more mesic upper
mixed-conifer forests. However, mean wood density increased
towards tree line because the dominant species, P. aristata,
produce very dense wood. Dense wood is likely an advanta-
geous trait at tree line where physiological drought is caused
by desiccating winds and cold temperatures. The identiﬁcation
of traits that reﬂect climatic conditions is a crucial step towards
understanding how vegetation will respond to climate change.
Although no single trait has been identiﬁed to capture a species
temperature optimum, traits such as wood density and ﬂower-
ing date do reﬂect a species’ ability to tolerate certain climatic
conditions.
Flowering date was another predictable trait in this study.
Tree species in warm climates ﬂower early in the season,
whereas species in cold climates must wait until much later in
the season to ﬂower owing to constraints on growing season
length (Table 1, Fig. 2). Phenological events, such as ﬂowering
and leaf out, are changing in response to warming (Iba´ n˜ ez
et al. 2010), suggesting that the plasticity of ﬂowering time
may render a model based on species-speciﬁc means of ques-
tionable value. However, there is a tremendous range in ﬂow-
ering
dates
among
tree
species
in
this
study
(range = 114 days). Shifts in ﬂowering date are most often
unidirectional (i.e. earlier), suggesting that ﬂowering dates of
species relative to each other may remain intact if they change
in response to warming. Nevertheless, the assumption of a con-
stant mean trait for each species in any model seems overly
simplistic, and the sensitivity of this assumption needs further
testing with a data set that includes adequate information on
intraspeciﬁc variation in trait distributions.
Orthogonal spectra of coordinated traits were not good pre-
dictors of species abundances. This was surprising given that
81% of the variation in the trait data was captured by the ﬁrst
three principal components. Apparently, enough variation in
the trait values among species was lost in the data reduction to
render the MaxEnt solutions poor ﬁts to observed abundances
compared with predictions obtained using individual traits.
Other studies have clearly shown that wood and leaf traits are
important to community assembly (Cornwell and Ackerly
1496
D. C. Laughlin et al.
 2011 The Authors. Journal of Ecology  2011 British Ecological Society, Journal of Ecology, 99, 1489–1499

2010), but in this study the wood and leaf trait axes did not
provide enough information by themselves to make good pre-
dictions of community structure. This suggests that the Max-
Ent model requires many traits to achieve excellent ﬁts, which
can easily lead to statistical over-ﬁtting. Over-ﬁtting can be
partially avoided through the judicious selection of traits and
through statistical signiﬁcance testing (Shipley 2010a; see
approach in Appendix S2). This also implies that climatic con-
straints on functional traits are not the only factors that deter-
mine species distributions, especially in the light of the fact that
environment could only explain a maximum of 57% of the var-
iance in relative abundances.
Trait–environment relationships formed the basis for pre-
dicting shifts in species distributions in a warmer world. In the-
ory, changes in climate at a given site will shift the average trait
in a community towards values that confer high performance
in that new climate. For example, if warming causes an
increase in drought-induced cavitation, thereby giving an
advantage to species with higher wood density (Hacke et al.
2001), then the average wood density of the community should
increase at that site. The MaxEnt model allows us to estimate
how such a fundamental physiological mechanism will lead to
changes in community composition. The MaxEnt model fore-
casted an upward shift of c. 500 m in tree species elevation
optimums (Lenoir et al. 2008) that would dramatically alter
the character of northern Arizona landscapes. These shifts are
within the range of vegetation change that has been observed
in the palaeoecological record in the south-western USA (Cole
1990), suggesting that these are possible given adequate dis-
persal and recruitment. Tree species range shifts could already
be underway given that tree mortality rates have recently
increased across the western USA, possibly because of climate
stressors (van Mantgem et al. 2009).
According to the model results, the transition between
J. monosperma woodland and P. ponderosa forest will shift
upward from 2000 m to 2350 m (Fig. 5a,d). P. ponderosa
forest currently occupies 1 857 200 ha in Arizona, of which
1 440 700 ha occurs below 2350 m. This implies that up to
78% of P. ponderosa forest in Arizona may transition to domi-
nance by J. monosperma by 2060. These results are useful for
informing management strategies to passively assist the migra-
tion of species into climatically suitable environments. For
example, managers could promote J. monosperma individuals
that currently exist in P. ponderosa stands, thereby providing a
seed source to passively facilitate the upward migration. Given
that P. ponderosa is forecast to dominate higher elevation sites
that are predicted to burn more frequently in a warmer climate
(Westerling et al. 2006), P. ponderosa should be favoured in
any silvicultural treatment in mixed-conifer forests to assist this
upward migration. These results suggest that the MaxEnt
model has practical uses in applied ecology, but this forecast
suggests an extremely rapid shift in species distributions.
The approach used here likely overestimates the rate of vege-
tation change that will occur by the year 2060 because it did
not incorporate other important climatic factors and demo-
graphical processes known to inﬂuence species migration. For
example, the increasing CO2 concentration may offset poten-
tially negative consequences of increasing temperatures by
increasing water use efﬁciency (Long et al. 2004). Changes in
precipitation will also control range shifts, but we did not
incorporate precipitation into the model because future
changes in precipitation are far less predictable than changes in
temperature (IPCC 2007) and because the WorldClim model-
predicted normals of precipitation are strongly correlated with
temperature.
The MaxEnt approach used here did not account for dis-
persal limitation, trait plasticity or evolutionary adaptation
(Dullinger, Dirnbo¨ ck & Grabherr 2004; Morin, Viner & Chu-
ine 2008). Forecasts of rapid migration rates are common to
niche-based approaches (e.g. Iverson & Prasad 1998), and
strict niche-based forecasts likely need tempering because dis-
persal limitation will limit migration rates (Morin, Viner &
Chuine 2008; Cole 2010; Moser et al. 2011). MaxEnt can
potentially account for dispersal limitation by using more
informative prior distributions that reﬂect local abundance
patterns (Sonnier, Shipley & Navas 2010). We restricted our
analyses to models with uniform (i.e. uninformative) prior dis-
tributions. Trait plasticity and adaptation could be incorpo-
rated into MaxEnt by altering trait values of species, but it is
uncertain how species’ traits will adapt to such rapid climate
change.
Another limitation of the MaxEnt model is that it lacks an
explicit mechanism relating plant traits to performance in dif-
ferent environments (Webb et al. 2010). We assessed the per-
formance ﬁlter using nonlinear regression models to develop
equations for predicting community-weighted mean trait val-
ues from climatic conditions. We acknowledge that this
approach is largely phenomenological; that is, we relied on
empirical ﬁts to observed data to learn inductively how com-
munity-weighted mean traits vary along climatic gradients,
rather than building a model from ﬁrst principles. Such models
built from ﬁrst principles have not yet been fully developed,
but recent theoretical advances suggest a promising way for-
ward (Falster et al. 2010). Until this theory is more fully devel-
oped, empirical models built from real data as a ﬁrst
approximation to the assessment of the performance ﬁlter
must be used.
Why should ecologists bother with a trait-based approach
when classical species distribution modelling approaches are
easier to apply and often yield better predictions? First, trait-
based approaches allow ecologists to statistically evaluate the
importance of interspeciﬁc trait variation in community assem-
bly and therefore attempt to explain observed distributional
patterns based on physiology-based trait–environment con-
straints. Classic modelling approaches lack a physiology-based
link between species and environment. Secondly, the MaxEnt
approach attempts to predict the relative abundance of every
species in the species pool simultaneously (including those that
never actually successfully establish), in contrast to the classic
approach, which models either a single species at a time or
just the species that are known to occur in a local site. Lastly, a
predictive model based on trait–climate relationships is better
suited for making predictions outside the range of where the
model was developed (Webb et al. 2010). Given that climate
Climatic constraints on forest assembly

can predict biome types across the planet (Whittaker 1975),
trait–climate relationships developed in one region may be sim-
ilar to trait–climate relationships in other regions. Using a per-
formance ﬁlter that is developed in one region to predict the
relative abundances of a different set of species in another
region is the natural next step for evaluating this trait-based
model of community assembly.
