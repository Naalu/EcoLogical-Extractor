A 
lthough fire is a key ecological 
process that regulates the 
structure oflong-needled pine 
forests throughout western North 
America, only in some pine forests of 
northern Mexico do frequent, low-in­
tensity fire regimes continue today. Fre­
quent fire was excluded from virtually 
all long-needled pine ecosystems in the 
United States as a result ofgrazing, log­
ging, and fire suppression associated 
with European-American settlement 
(Covington et al. 1994; Swetnam and 
Baisan, in press). The subsequent de­
velopment of dense forests with a 
buildup of hazardous fuels presents 
challenges for current management of 
these ecosystems. 
To evaluate the extent of change and 
assess management alternatives, base­
line or reference data on presettlement 
ecosystem processes and structures is 
needed, but almost no examples of 
long-needled pine forests subject to fre­
quent fire remain in the United States 
(Kaufmann et al. 1994). Forests in 
northern Mexico still provide contem­
porary examples of the effects of fre-

quent fire regimes on forest structure. 
However, .with few exceptions (e.g., 
Dieterich 1983; Fule and Covington 
1994), little is known about the role of 
fire or the relationship between fire and 
ecosystem structure in these forests 
(Gonzdlez-Cabdn and Sandberg 1989). 
Before the effects of fire exclusion 
were widely recognized by foresters and 
scientistsin the United States,Aldo Le0­
pold (1937) and Joe Marshall (1962) 
compared pine-oak forests in southern 
Arizona with those of northern Sonora 
and Chihuahua. suggesting that heavier 
grazing and fire exclusion in the US for­
ests had led to the dense thickets of 
"dwarfed" trees, increased erosion, and 
high fuel loading. Such problems are 
common in southwestern US forests, 
but not seen in northern Mexico. In 
Marshall's words (1962, p. 76): 
If we grant that this contrast is too 
abrupt and too coincident with the 
. international boundary to be due 0:­
elusively to climate, then we must 
look for man-made causes of the dif­
ference in vegetation. The outstand­
ing cause seems to be fire. ... There

Methods 
We de signed sampling to measure 
fire disturbance history and forest 
structural characteristics sim ultane­
ously on systematic grids of 30 sam­
pling points installed at each study site 
(table 2). Fire-scarred cro ss-sections 
from living and dead trees with the ap· 
parently most complete or oldest fire 
scar records were sampled in the search 
area centered on each grid point. Forest 
overstory and regeneration, herbaceous 
vegetation, and forest floor fuels were 
measured on nested plots centered on 
the sampling grid points following the 
procedures summarized in table2. Fire 
scar samples were surfaced and cross­
dated to the year and season of occur­
rence (Sto kes and Smil ey 19G8; Swet­
nam and Baisan, in press). Increment 
cores were mounted, surfaced, and 
dated to determine age structu re. 
Results and Discussion 
Changingfire regimes. Past fire fre­
quencies were similar at all four sites 
before the mid-20th centu ry, with 
mean fire intervals (M FI) ranging from 
3.8 to 5.0 years in a com parison of all 
years in whi ch sam ples were scarred, 
and 6. 5 to 9.0 years in whi ch 25% or 
more sam pies were scarred (jig. 2). 
Fires scarring 25% or more sam ples oc­
cur red less frequently and are thought 
to have been larger in area or more in­
tense th an fires represented by only 
one or a few scars. This distinction is 
helpful in estimating the ecological ef­
fecrs of fire in ecosystems characterized 
by low-intensity fire regimes, in whi ch 
intensity and size of past fires are diffi ­
cult to reconstruct. At the higher ele-

range as those of the lower elevation

burned in the summer. similar [0 pat­
terns in the southwestern United 
States (Swetn am and Baisan, in press). 
A possible connection between climate 
and fire occurrence was su ggested by 
the fact that 5 of the 10 regional fire 
years (in which three or all four sites 
burned) corresponded to positive 
Southern Oscillation Index (Sal) ex­
tremes, while none of the regional fire 
years matched warm and wer negative 
SOl extremes. Positive SOl extremes 
tend [0 produce cold and dry weather 
conditions (Stahle and Cleaveland 
1993) and have been correlated with 
ma jor regional fire years in the south­
western United States (Swetnam and 
Betancourt 1990). 
Fire regimes changed in the mid­
20th century on three of the four study 
sites (fig. 2). Fire exclusion began at 
two sites, AV and C B. after 194 5 and 
1951 respectively: since then these 
areas have not had a widespread fire. 
Site SP entered a fire-exclusion period 
after 1951 , which lasted for 29 years 
until the return of widespread fire in 
1984 and 199 3. Fires have continued 
up [0 the present only at site AL. Al­
though a relativel y long fire-free period 
occurred between 1951 [0 1965, wide­
spread fires on this site in 1980, 1986, 
and 1991 maintained the long-term 
panern of frequent fires. 
Specific reasons for fire regime 
changes at these sites are not known, al­
though they may be related ro popula­
tion changes; expansion ofejidos; intro­
duction oflivestock, and development of 
roads, mines, or agriculture. Organized

Forest Structure 
Because the four 
study sites provided 
distinct examples of 
continued 
frequent 
fire (site AL), fire ex­
clusion for 29 years 
followed by reburning 
(site SP ), and ex­
tende d fire exclusion 
(sites C B and AV), we 
expected ro find dif­
fecrs of fire. Since this study compared  
different sites, we do not statistically  
infer a cause-and-effect relationship  
between fire regimes and forest struc­ 
tures. Nonetheless, the structural char­ 
acteristics measured did vary in a man­ 
ner matching the known effects of fire.  
Despite differences in time, social con­ 
text, and climate, the changes in forest  
structure following fire exclusion on 
these Mexican sites were also consis­ 
tent with the effects of fire exclusion 
observed in the western United States 
(Covington et al. 1994). 
Differences in forest density corre­
sponded to the thinning effects of fire: 
sites SP and AL, with recent fires. had 
mean densities 20 to 50% less than the 
fire-excluded sites CB and AV (table 
3). Fire-excluded site AV was domi­
nated by numerous small trees (qua­
dratic mean diameter [QD] 4.1 in.), 
while the recently burned sites SP and 
AL (Q D 11.4 in. and 10.7 in. respec­
tivel y) were characterized by fewer, 
larger trees. Site CB falls in between 
(Q D 7.0 in.). 
Regeneration densities (all trees 
below breast height) at the four sites 
ranged from approximately 2,400 [0 
4, 800 trees/acre, suggesting that the 
inherent capability for reproduction 
was not necessarily higher at the fire­
excluded sites with dense oversrories. 
Rather, the difference between high re­
generation density and low oversrory 
density at the recently burned sites SP 
and AL appears to be the thinning ef­
fect of fire on smaller trees. Qualitative 
differences in regeneration were ob­
served between sites , with the recently 
burned sites dominated by small 
seedlings and sprouts appearing after 
the last burn, while the fire -excluded 
sites were characterized by older 
sapling thickets. 
Density of recent snags (those with 
branches and bark still intact) was sig­
nificantly higher at site SP, where the 
rerum offires in 1984 and 1993 after a 
29- yea r fire-free period killed man y 
trees (table 3). However, older snags 
were more dense at the fire-excluded 
sites (C B and AV) than at th e recently 
burned sites, possibly because sn ags 
could remain sta ndi ng longer in the

absence of fire. 
Total forest floor woody fuel loads 
were 2 co 5 times higher at fire-ex­
cluded sites than at recently burned 
sites (jig. 3), The greatest difference 
was in large, rotten woody fuels, which 
are quicker co ignite than sound woody 
fuels and tend co be completely con­
sumed by glowing combustion. Liner 
depth was similar at all sites (mean 
0.84 in.), bur the depth of duff (fer­
mentation and humus layers) was sig­
nificantly lower at the recentl y burned 
sites (mean 0.39 in.) than at the fire­
excluded sites (mean 0.96 in.). These 
differences match the expected effects 
of fire in consuming these fuels. The 
comparable levels of forest liner sug­
gest that burned and unburned sites 
both have continuous fine fuels that 
can support fire; even recenrly burned 
sites (site SP burned one year before 
sampling; site AL burned two years be­
fore sampling) appear co have quickly 
recovered fine fuel loadings. Herba­
ceous cover was relatively low at all 
four sites, ranging from 10 ro 20%, 
but tended ro be higher at the recently 
burned sites, as expe cted, given their 
lower overstory densities. 
Management Implications 
Hazards of wildfire, such as defor­
estation, erosion, and timber loss, are 
widely appreciated in Mexico, but the 
effects of fire exclusion have received 
relatively lirrle attention. Although 
beneficial aspects of fire as a silvicul­
rural rool and as a narural ecological 
disturbance facror have been recog­
nized within the scientific community, 
public perceptions remain influenced 
by anti-fire publicity (Rodriguez Trejo 
and Sierra Pineda 1992). Large, high­
intensity fires are still rare in Mexico, 
perhaps as a consequence of low fuel 
levels due ro frequent burning, rela­
tively short periods of fire exclusion, 
and a mosaic of forest patches burned 
at different times (see Minnich 1983 
for an analogous situation in chaparral 
vegetation). A recent government re­
port on national wildfire status de­
scribed Mexican forest fires as affecting 
the herbaceous vegetation and the for­
est floor bur only rarely the tree crowns 
(SARH 1994). 
As fire exclusion periods lengthen, 
however, wildfire behavior is likely ro 
intensify. The high oversrory density 
and heavy fuel loading observed at the 
fire-excluded sites in this srudy are 
likely ro support high-intensity fire 
with extensive tree mortality. Taking 
site SP as an example of the rerurn of 
fire ro a fire-excluded ecosystem, if the 
den sities ofrecendy killed trees and liv­
ing trees are summed as a rough ap­
proximation of forest density after 29 
years of fire exclusion (total 369 
trees/ac), the return of fire may have 
killed up ro 40% of the trees at the site. 
Despite this tree mortality, site SP re­
mains a pine-oak forest. The outcome 
of the next wildfire at sites AV and CB 
may be different, as these fire-excluded 
sites have oversrory densities 150 ro 
300% higher, as well as very high 
woody fuel loading, so high-intensity 
fire could lead ro heavy mortality or 
deforestation. The hazard is aug­
mented through fuel strucrures such as 
rotten wood, deeper forest floors, and 
fuel ladders composed of smaller and 
mid-sized trees that carry fire into the 
overscory crowns. 
Fire has a paradoxical nature in 
long-needled pine forests as both an es­
sential ecological process and a poten­
tial destroyer of the forest. The contra­
dicrory narure of these perspectives on 
fire is evident in the Sierra Madre Oc­
cidenral. As human populations rise 
and as the infrastructure needed for 
timber exploitation is developed, land­
owners and foresters become increas­
ingly aware of the value of timber, a 
view that opposes their hisrorical pref­
erence for agricultural use. In the pre­
sent study area, managers have recently 
initiated campaigns co prevent, detect, 
and suppress forest fires, and ejido 
members are proud of their contribu­
tions co fire prevention and suppres­
sion crews, However, the regime of fre­
quent, low-intensity fire that prevailed 
until recently in these forests is a key 
ecological process contributing ro the 
present health and low destructive po­
tential of fuels in many of these forests 
today (Leopold 1937; Marshall 1962; 
Fule and Covingron 1994). 
Another example of a problematic 
fire paradigm is expressed in a recent 
study, which concluded that the north­
ern Mexican states are becoming de­
forested because the area reforested 
(i.e., planted) is a tiny fraction of the 
area burned each year (Fischer et al. 
1995). The authors explicitly assumed 
that every fire causes 100% mortality 
ro the burned stand. an assumption 
that clearly does not hold for areas 
such as our study sites. While the au­
thors appear ro be motivated by a de­
sire to preserve these uniq ue ecosys­
tems, we suggest that the unintended 
consequence of a "fire-exclusion ap­
proach" ro preservation is likely ro be 
the replacement of frequent low-inten­
sity fires with infrequent, high-inten­
sity, stand-killing fires. 
If changes in Mexican forests are in­
deed following the patterns of those in 
southwestern US forests on a broad 
scale, then Mexican land managers and 
conservationists could be well served

Stares and Ca nada (e.g., Everett er al. 
1994) and actively seeking to prevent 
their development in Mexico. Pre­
scribed fire is a tool that should be ex­
plored to maintain productive, healthy, 
diverse forests. Similarly, for US man­
agers trying to restore degraded ecosys­
rems (Kaufmann er al. 1994), forests of 
northern Mexico can present a bench­
mark and a testing ground for ideas 
abo ut ecological restoration.

in fire regime s and ecosystem structure
