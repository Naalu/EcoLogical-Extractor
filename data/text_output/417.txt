1  Introduction
Wildland fire has been a key selective force through evolutionary time, influencing 
the development of characteristic adaptations of forest trees ranging from the 
serotinous cones of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) to the vigorous sprouting of 
Canary Island pine (Pinus canariensis) (Keeley and Zedler 1998). In the semi-arid 
southwestern United States, forest fires play complex ecological and social roles. 
Ecologically, the southwestern U.S. encompass forests adapted to severe, stand-
replacing fires, those adapted to frequent surface fires, and forests with a mixture 
of fire intensities. Overlaid on this natural mosaic, however, modern industrial 
society has consistently sought to suppress fire (Pyne 1982). An unintended con-
sequence of fire exclusion, however, is the accumulation of fuel horizontally across 
contiguous tree canopies and vertically through the crowns of small understory 
trees. Coupled with warming climate, more droughts, less snow, and longer fire 
seasons, there is little doubt that severe fires will increase (Westerling et al. 2006). 
For forest ecosystems not adapted to severe burning and already stressed by non-
native species, human impacts, and climate change, the likelihood of substantial 
irreversible degradation appears high (Savage and Mast 2005; Strom and Fulé 
2007). Early proponents of taking an ecological approach to fire, such as Leopold 
(1924) and Weaver (1951), were lonely voices in their time. Today, however, the 
attention of scientists and forest managers is focused on the restoring of the natu-
rally fire-resilient characteristics of native ecosystems (Falk 2006). In order to 
have a chance to accomplish this goal, it is vital that we have the best possible

understanding of historical forest characteristics: fire regimes, forest structure, 
species composition, and dynamics.
Tree-ring analysis is a powerful technique for developing reliable knowledge 
about forest history and change. The theme of this chapter is the use of tree rings 
for the following goals: (1) determine historical fire regimes across the elevational 
gradient of forest ecosystems; (2) measure changes in forest structure, composition, 
fuels, and simulated fire behavior; and (3) apply these data for testing management 
alternatives for ecological restoration and conservation.
2  Study Region
Grand Canyon National Park, in northern Arizona, USA, is a world heritage site 
preserving the deep canyon of the Colorado River and the surrounding ecosystems, 
including high-elevation coniferous forests on canyon rims. The Park is famous for 
its stunning rock formations but the high forests should be recognized for their 
own merits: Grand Canyon preserves the largest never-harvested forest in Arizona, 
covering an elevational gradient from woodlands to subalpine forests. In the 
canyon, the Colorado River runs below high escarpments which reach approxi-
mately 2,800 m in elevation on the Kaibab Plateau (North Rim) and 2,300 m on the 
Coconino Plateau (South Rim). Soils are derived from limestone substrates (Warren 
et al. 1982). Weather data are from the Western Regional Climate Center (www.
wrcc.dri.edu), Bright Angel station, elevation 2,560 m, North Rim and cover the 
period 1925–2008. Average temperature was –2.7°C in January and 16.8°C in July; 
annual precipitation averaged 645 mm. Forest types include ponderosa pine (Pinus 
ponderosa), often with a substantial component of Gambel oak (Quercus gambellii), 
at elevations around 2,200 m. At higher elevations and on northern aspects, mixed 
conifer forests (ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and white 
fir (Abies concolor), and aspen (Populus tremuloides) dominate. At the highest 
elevations, up to 2,700 m, forests of aspen, spruce (Picea engelmannii and Picea 
pungens), and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) are interspersed with meadows.
3  Tree-Ring Reconstruction of Historical Fire Regimes
Field sampling began in 1997, when we established study sites that eventually 
covered 6,565 ha stretching from the canyon rims to the highest elevations on both 
the North and South Rims. Sites were selected to represent the elevational gradient 
from ponderosa pine to mixed conifer, spruce-fir and aspen forests (Fig. 1).
Fire-scarred trees were sampled to inventory fire dates based on tree-ring analysis 
(Swetnam and Baisan 1996). The study sites were systematically surveyed along 
parallel transects to search 100% of the area, except at the large high-elevation site 
(4,400 ha) where fire-scarred trees were encountered predominantly on ridge tops

and SW-S-SE aspects. Trees with the longest and most complete fire records were 
preferentially targeted for sampling. Samples were mapped when collected and 
were well-distributed throughout the study areas (Fig. 1).

In the high-elevation forest where stand-replacing fires were expected to be most 
common, we attempted to identify even-aged, homogenous stands that originated 
after fire. However, the landscape was highly diverse and we were not able to 
distinguish even-aged stands through remotely sensed data or field reconnaissance. 
At the finer scale of the permanent plots, however, we detected differences associ-
ated with effects of fires of differing severity. Fire-initiated and non-fire-initiated 
plots were characterized by age and species composition data, similar to Murray 
et al. (1998). The term “fire-initiated” is used here to separate groups of trees that 
originated following a stand-replacing fire. All age cohorts within each plot were 
taken into consideration but the greatest weight was given to the oldest trees. 
When the oldest tree or trees were the fire-resistant species Pinus ponderosa or 
Pseudotsuga menziesii, the plot was classified as non-fire-initiated. When the oldest 
trees were the fire-susceptible species Populus tremuloides, Abies lasiocarpa, or 
Picea spp., the plot was classified as fire-initiated. Abies concolor was considered 
intermediate in fire resistance; they were classified as non-fire-initiated when accom-
panied by uneven-aged Pinus or Pseudotsuga, and as fire-initiated when accompanied 
by approximately equal-aged Populus.
Fire-scarred samples were mounted on wood backing and surfaced with sandpaper 
until cells were clearly visible under magnification. Tree rings were visually cross-
dated (Stokes and Smiley 1968) and dating of measured rings was checked with 
the Cofecha software (Holmes 1983). The season of fire was estimated based on the 
relative position of fire injury within the annual ring (Baisan and Swetnam 1990).
Fire scar data were analyzed with FHX2 software (Grissino-Mayer 2001) begin-
ning with the first fire year having an adequate sample depth, 10% or more of the total 
sample size of recording trees (Grissino-Mayer et al. 1995). “Recording” trees are 
those with fire scars or other wounds (e.g., lightning scars) that make them suscepti-
ble to repeated scarring by fire. Comparing data between study sites that differ in area 
could be biased because more scars recording small fires are likely to be included in 
larger study sites (Swetnam and Baisan 1996). Proportional filtering of the data set 
provides a useful basis of comparison by removing small fires that scarred only one 
or a few trees (Van Horne and Fulé 2006). Our filters were, first, all fire years, even 
those represented by a single scar. Then only those fire years were included in which 
respectively 10% or more, and 25% or more, of the recording samples were scarred.
The relationship between climatic fluctuations and fire occurrence was evalu-
ated with superposed epoch analysis (SEA) (Grissino-Mayer 2001). The SEA 
superimposes all fire years and mathematically summarizes the climate data for fire 
years, as well as a window of several preceding and succeeding years. Bootstrapped 
distributions of climate data in 1,000 random windows were used to create confi-
dence intervals. We developed a local tree-ring chronology to serve as a proxy for 
climate. The chronology was significantly correlated with reconstructed Palmer 
Drought Stress Index (r = 0.67) for grid point 31 in northern Arizona, A.D. 1694–1978 
(Cook et al. 1996).
Results of the fire-scar analysis showed that frequent surface fires occurred through-
out the ponderosa pine and mixed conifer forests of Grand Canyon, changing to lethal 
fires predominantly in the cooler, north-facing aspects at higher elevations (Table 1).

The surface fire regimes all had composite mean fire intervals <10 years, calculated 
with the filtering criterion of fire years in which 25% or more of the sample trees 
were scarred. The only exception was a slightly longer interval (11.6 years) in 
the lowest-elevation site, a ponderosa/woodland ecotone, and increasing intervals 
(11.9–31.0 years) in the portions of high-elevation sites where surface fires 
occurred. Tree groups on nearly 60% of the high-elevation landscape plots were 
initiated by severe fire and were dominated by spruce or aspen; the oldest appeared 
to have originated after severe fires in 1782 or 1785. In 1880, the onset of general 
fire exclusion, all fire-initiated groups were less than 100 years old and nearly 25% 
of the groups were less than 20 years old. In contrast, non-fire-initiated groups at 
high elevation were significantly older, dominated by Pinus ponderosa, Pseudotsuga 
menziesii, or Abies concolor, and occurred preferentially on S and W slopes. The 
interspersion of fire-initiated patches of different ages and strong topographic asso-
ciation with fire type, creating a mixed-severity mosaic over the landscape, sug-
gested that severe fires on the North Rim were smaller than those previously 
reported in spruce-fir forests of the Southwest or Rocky Mountains (Aplet et al. 
1988; Grissino-Mayer et al. 1995). Patchy lethal fires also characterized the lower 
forest ecotone, where pinyon-juniper woodlands are dissected by drainages that 
support ponderosa pine (Huffman et al. 2008).
Fire occurrence was synchronized by climate across the large landscapes of 
Grand Canyon: five major regional fire years (1735, 1748, 1773, 1785, and 1879) 
burned over all or most of the North Rim study sites, an area of at least 300 km2. 
Fire years were significantly dry (Fulé et al. 2003a, b), as measured by Palmer 
Drought Severity Index, and the years prior to fire were significantly wet in five of 
six study sites, patterns similar to those observed across the Southwest (Swetnam 
and Betancourt 1998). Fires ceased at most sites around the time of European 
settlement; the last year of widespread fire on the North Rim was 1879 and on the 
South Rim was 1887, although Wolf and Mast (1998) reported additional fires into 
the early twentieth century. In contrast to the general exclusion of fire after 
European settlement at Grand Canyon and across the southwestern U.S., three of 
the studied landscapes – Powell Plateau, Rainbow Plateau, and Fire Point – had two 
or three large, spreading surface fires since 1880, as well as several smaller fires. 
These remote, never-harvested forests are useful analogues for near-natural condi-
tions prior to recent fire regime disruption.
Fire regimes reconstructed from fire scars should in theory be calibrated against 
modern records, providing a gauge of the accuracy, precision, and spatial fidelity of 
reconstructed fire histories (Baker and Ehle 2001). Calibration would be a test of 
the uniformity principle of dendrochronology, the concept that the factors governing 
tree-ring width today operated in the same way in the past. Unfortunately, it is 
difficult to carry out modern calibration because records were not kept when fires 
were common (pre-twentieth century) and most regions of the southwestern U.S. 
have not burned, or burned only rarely, during the recent period when records exist. 
At Grand Canyon, however, we found the unusual circumstance that a number of 
fires had occurred in the studied landscapes in the twentieth century, both wildfires 
and managed fires, and fire records had been maintained since 1924.

371

Fire scars were accurate in identifying historical fires: all of the 13 recorded fires 
larger than 8 ha since 1924 were identified from fire scars (Fulé et al. 2003a, b). 
The proportion of scarred trees was generally related to recorded fire size, a useful 
test of the hypothesis that higher levels of scarring can serve as a “filter” for sepa-
rating larger and smaller fires (Swetnam and Baisan 1996). The high accuracy of 
fire-scar data in reconstructing the modern Grand Canyon fire history, coupled with 
similar recent findings from Saguaro National Park in Arizona (Farris et al. 2003) 
and studies on fire-scar sampling methodology in Arizona (Van Horne and Fulé 
2006) and New Mexico (Falk 2004) show that surface fire regimes reconstructed 
from fire scars in southwestern ponderosa pine forests, using standard sampling 
methods (Swetnam and Baisan 1996) are highly reliable.
4  Tree-Ring Analysis for Forest and Fuel Structure
Over the same landscapes as in the fire history studies described above, we measured 
forest and fuel characteristics on grids of systematically spaced permanent plots. 
Sampling plots were 0.1 ha (20 × 50 m). Dendrochronological sampling was used 
to measure age structure and forest change. We tagged trees and measured species, 
condition, diameter at breast height (DBH, 1.37 m), height, and crown base height. 
We distinguished between trees established prior to circa 1880, when European-
American settlers introduced livestock and interrupted fire disturbance regimes 
(Cooper 1960), and those that established later (White 1985). All living trees meeting 
the pre-settlement criteria were considered potentially pre-1880 trees and were 
cored. A random 10% sample of all other trees was also cored. Coring height was 
40 cm above ground level to meet two objectives: first, to measure tree age, and 
second, to measure growth between the fire regime disruption date and the present 
(needed for the forest reconstruction).
Canopy cover was recorded with a vertical densitometer along the 50-m side-
lines of each plot, every 0.3 or 3 m. Forest floor and woody debris were measured 
along four 15.2 m planar intersect transects (Brown 1974). Litter and duff (fermen-
tation plus humus layers) depths were measured every 1.52 m along each transect, 
and woody debris was recorded by time-lag classes of 1 h (0–0.6 cm diameter), 10 h 
(0.6–2.5 cm), 100 h (2.5–7.6 cm), and 1,000 h (>7.6 cm).
Tree increment cores were surfaced and visually crossdated. Rings were counted 
on cores that could not be crossdated, mostly younger trees. Additional years to the 
center were estimated with concentric circles matched to the curvature and density 
of the inner rings for cores that missed the pith. Forest structure in 1880 was recon-
structed using dendroecological methods (Fulé et al. 1997) as follows: tree size at 
the time of fire exclusion was reconstructed by subtracting twice the radial growth 
measured on increment cores since 1879. We developed local species-specific 
relationships between tree diameter and basal area increment (r2 = .45 to .90) and 
applied these relationships to estimate past size for trees without increment cores 
(dead or rotten centers). For dead trees, the date of death was estimated based on 

372

tree condition class using diameter-dependent snag decomposition rates (Thomas 
et al. 1979). Local tests have shown the death-date model to be reasonably accurate 
(Waskiewicz et al. 2007).
We modeled changes in forest structure, canopy fuels, and potential fire behavior 
as outlined in the schematic in Fig. 2. Forest change was simulated on a per-plot 
basis at 10-year intervals using the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS, Van Dyck 
2000), Central Rockies variant. This model is a highly precise statistical model for 
forest simulation (Edminster et al. 1991). Simulations were initialized with recon-
structed 1880 conditions. Actual regeneration data by species and decade were 
added to each plot and increased by 40%, an empirically determined value, to 
account for density-dependent mortality. Canopy biomass was estimated with 
diameter-based allometric equations for foliage and fine twigs, the canopy fuels 
that are available for burning in crown fires. Canopy volume was estimated on a 
per-plot basis by the maximum tree height (top of the canopy) minus crown base 
height (bottom of the canopy). Canopy bulk density was calculated as canopy biomass 
divided by canopy volume.
Fire behavior was modeled with the Nexus Fire Behavior and Hazard Assessment 
System (Scott and Reinhardt 2001). Nexus combines a deterministic model of 
surface fire behavior with models of crown fire transition and crown fire spread.

Foliar moisture content was set at 100% (Agee et al. 2002). Hot and dry weather 
inputs were used to simulate fire behavior under extreme conditions. Fire weather 
extremes representing the 90th and 97th percentiles of low fuel moisture and high 
temperature were calculated for 1970–2001 at the Bright Angel weather station 
using the FireFamily Plus program (Bradshaw and Brittain 1999). Values were 
calculated for June, historically the month with the most severe fire weather 
(Table 2), because severe fires spread out of control under such conditions. Fire 
behavior fuel models (Anderson 1982) used were 9 (sites below 2,500 m elevation) 
and 10 (sites above 2,500 m elevation). We focused the analysis on crown fire 
behavior as measured by the crowning index (CI), defined as the windspeed at 
which active canopy burning could be sustained (Scott and Reinhardt 2001).
Results of tree-ring assessment of forest change indicated that forest structure 
since the time of European settlement and fire exclusion, circa 1880, changed 
substantially in fire-excluded study sites but much less in those that continued to 
burn. Basal area of ponderosa pine forests increased an average of 238% from 
9.1–20.5 m2 ha–1 at the onset of European settlement and fire regime disruption, 
circa 1880, to 22.9–31.4 m2 ha–1 in contemporary forests (Table 2). Changes in tree 
density were even more dramatic: 140–160 trees ha–1 to 389–955 trees ha-1, an 
average of 448%. While these increases are large, Grand Canyon forest densities 
actually increased less than most southwestern ponderosa forests. Densities 
reported in a number of forest reconstruction studies and early historical forest 
inventories averaged 79 pines ha–1 (see list in Covington and Moore 1992), 
whereas the current average ponderosa pine density across the state of Arizona is 
approximately 619 pines ha–1 (O’Brien 2002). At Grand Canyon, the sites where 
fire regimes were not completely disrupted had the smallest post-settlement 
increases in pine density reported to date in the Southwest, averaging 64 pines ha–1 
or 42% (Table 2). Densities of other trees jumped, especially Quercus and Robinia, 
but pines continued to dominate, making up an average of 90% of basal area. We 
suggested that the continued presence of surface fire, even at much longer than 
natural intervals, was the most likely reason for maintaining relatively open forests 
at the remote points and plateaus (Fulé et al. 2002). The specific reasons for 
density change are typically difficult to untangle because livestock grazing, fire 
suppression, and past logging affected most southwestern forests in overlapping 
ways (Belsky and Blumenthal 1997), but the Grandview site and never-harvested 
forests of the G. A. Pearson Natural Area in Arizona (Covington et al. 1997) and 
Monument Canyon Natural Area in New Mexico (Falk 2004) provide examples 
where logging was absent but pine density increases on the order of 1,000% were 
observed after fire exclusion.
Forest density increases were greatest in mixed conifer and spruce/fir/aspen 
forests at the highest elevations of the Park. The highest basal area of any contem-
porary forest was reached in mixed conifer at Swamp Ridge, 41.3 m2 ha–1, and the 
large Little Park site averaged 31.9 m2 ha–1 (Table 2). The Swamp Ridge site had 
had the highest basal area in 1880 as well (28.5 m2 ha–1), but ponderosa pine 
dropped from 75% of basal area in 1880 to only 48% today as the species composi-
tion shifted to Abies and Pseudotsuga. The high-elevation Little Park site was very

open in 1880 (12.2 m2 ha–1), likely as a result of severe fires in 1851 and 1879, but 
had become dense by 2000 with Abies, Picea, and Populus.
Assessing the accuracy of tree-ring forest reconstructions was facilitated by a 
thorough inventory of the Kaibab Plateau (North Rim) carried out by Lang and 
Stewart (1910). They reported an average in ponderosa pine forest of 128 pines 
>15.2 cm DBH ha–1. For comparison, the Powell Plateau, Fire Point, and Rainbow 
Plateau sites averaged 141, 136, and 125 pines >15.2 cm DBH ha–1 in the 1880 
reconstruction and 141.2, 148.5, and 147.8 pines >15.2 cm DBH ha–1 in the 
contemporary forest, nearly no change in pine density over approximately 120 years 
(Fulé et al. 2002). In higher elevation forests, the Lang and Stewart (1910) averages 
for several conifer species were also very close to reconstructed densities. Across the 
4,400-ha Little Park study site, reconstructed 1880 average densities for Abies, 
Pseudotsuga, and Picea (trees >15.2 cm DBH) were within 2 tree ha–1 of the aver-
ages reported by Lang and Stewart (1910). Only ponderosa pine was more variable, 
about 25% or 11 trees ha–1 lower in density (Fulé et al. 2003a). On the South Rim 
at Grandview, reconstructed pine densities fell within ranges surveyed by Woolsey 
(1911) (Fulé et al. 2002). In addition to quantitative data, the early forest surveyors 
also noted that “forest fires have been the cause of incalculable losses […]. Vast 
denuded areas, charred stubs and fallen trunks and the general prevalence of 
blackened poles [illustrate] their frequency and severity long before this country 
was explored by white men […]. Evidence indicates light ground fires over practi-
cally the whole forest, some of the finest stands of yellow pine show only slight 
charring of the bark and very little damage to poles and undergrowth” but at higher 
elevations “old fires extended over large areas at higher altitudes, amounting to 
several square miles on either side of Big Park [now called DeMotte Park, N of our 
Little Park study site]” (Lang and Stewart 1910:18–19). These descriptions are 
consistent with our tree-ring-based fire regime and forest reconstructions across the 
elevational gradient.
Modeling results indicated that fuels and fire hazard increased over time as the 
forest density increased and species composition changed on the North Rim. 
Canopy biomass, which serves as the fuel for severe fires, increased at all sites. The 
average increase was only 122% at the low-elevation ponderosa pine sites, consis-
tent with the minimal post-settlement alteration observed in these areas, but 279% 
at the high-elevation Little Park site (Fulé et al. 2004). The high fuel load and spatial 
contiguity of the Little Park site were consistent with the findings of White and 
Vankat (1993) in the adjacent Thompson Canyon watershed. The intermediate-
elevation Swamp Ridge site, a mixed conifer forest, had the highest canopy biomass 
in 1880 but the smallest increase by 2040 (39%). Canopy bulk density increased in 
proportion with biomass. Species composition of canopy fuels remained consistent 
at low elevation (Pinus ponderosa) but shifted strongly to mesic species at higher 
elevations. Potential crown fire behavior forecast in terms of crowning index (CI), 
the minimum wind speed required for active canopy burning, decreased (i.e., the 
hazard of severe wildfire increased) by 23–80% over the modeled period. Canopy 
fuel and CI values were extrapolated across the entire North Rim landscape. At a 
threshold wind speed of 45 km/h, only 6% of the landscape was susceptible to active

crown fire in 1880 but 33% was susceptible by 2000 (Fulé et al. 2004). Empirical 
evidence of forest susceptibility to severe fire was shown by the Outlet Fire in 2000, 
which burned over 5,260 ha, about 35% complete overstory mortality (Bertolette 
and Spotskey 2001).
5  Applications to Management
Tree-ring analyses of fire regimes and forest structure carried out in these interlinked 
research studies have supported a wide array of ecological interpretations and manage-
ment decisions. We applied tree-ring methods to reconstruct the fire disturbance 
regime and forest structure over the past 100–400 years. We assessed the accuracy 
of the findings using intersecting lines of evidence from historical and modern 
records. And we used vegetation and fire behavior simulation models to characterize 
changes in fuels and fire hazards over a 160-year period. In this section, I describe 
two examples of the application of this information for restoration and conservation 
of Grand Canyon’s forest ecosystems: (1) setting ecological reference conditions 
and (2) supporting fire management decisions.
Ecological reference conditions: Several studies have taken advantage of the 
ecological value of the remote points and plateaus of the North Rim, rare never-
harvested forests with surface fire regimes continuing to the present. Leopold 
(1941) referred to reference conditions (also, range of natural variability, range of 
historical variability; see Swetnam et al. 1999, Landres et al. 1999) as the “base 
datum” of ecology. Even when there is considerable uncertainty about the variability 
among alternative ecological states or the linearity and predictability of succes-
sional trajectories, reference data on ecosystem structure and process are highly 
valuable (Cortina et  al. 2006). Modern reference sites are especially useful for 
assessing transitory, dynamic aspects of the ecosystem, such as herbaceous plants, 
wildlife, or soil nutrients, which generally do not leave enduring evidence.
Herbaceous plant communities provide over 90% of the vascular plant diversity 
in southwestern ponderosa pine forests, as well as critical habitat for invertebrates 
and vertebrates, forage for domestic livestock, and fuel to sustain the surface 
regime (Korb and Springer 2003). Past overgrazing, drought, introduction of non-
native species, fire exclusion, and increased forest density have degraded herbaceous 
plant communities. The remote North Rim sites have been protected from livestock 
since the late 1930s. Gildar et al. (2004) contrasted plant communities across two 
years between two reference sites (Powell Plateau and Rainbow Plateau) and 
Galahad Plateau, where fire exclusion had occurred since 1880. The unburned site 
had significantly higher coarse woody debris and duff depth, but species richness 
was influenced more by inter-annual precipitation than by fire history. Moving to 
the landscape scale, however, Laughlin et al. (2005) modeled overstory-understory 
relationships over the full elevational gradient on the North Rim. In this context, the 
North Rim reference sites stood out because species richness was associated with 
lower pine basal area and inversely related to time since fire. Laughlin and Grace 

377
Wildfire Ecology and Management at Grand Canyon, USA
(2006) used structural equation modeling to investigate potential mechanisms for 
the fire-richness relationship. Model results suggested that important processes 
included a post-fire stimulation of germination, a decline in understory abundance 
with time since fire, and an increase over time in pine abundance (which indirectly 
leads to reduced richness) in the absence of fire. The hypothesis that surface fire 
played a role in maintaining diverse plant communities was tested in a case study 
at Fire Point, which burned in 1999. After the fire, the plant community shifted 
toward higher compositional similarity with the reference plots at Powell and 
Rainbow Plateaus (Laughlin et al. 2004).
Fire management: In 2003, Grand Canyon National Park managed four naturally 
ignited wildfires for resource benefits, ultimately burning nearly 8,000 ha (Fulé and 
Laughlin 2007). The fires burned over and between our existing plot network 
(Fig. 1), permitting an empirical assessment of the utility of fire use in restoring 
historical ecosystem patterns. After the fires burned out, we remeasured 82 perma-
nent plots burned by the fires plus 43 plots on unburned companion sites in the first 
2 years following fire. Across the elevational gradient, the fires burned in a manner 
consistent with the evidence of the pre-settlement fire regime: predominantly surface 
fire behavior in ponderosa pine forest (Fig. 3), with fire intensity increasing up 
through the mixed conifer and spruce-fir. The maximum basal area killed on any 
plot was 13.7 m2 ha–1, the equivalent of 58% of the pre-fire plot basal area. At 
mid-elevation on Swamp Ridge, over 40% of the plots had >10 m2 ha–1; maximum

mortality was 32.4 m2 ha–1, equal to 83% of pre-fire basal area. At the highest elevation 
plots in Little Park, 56% of plots exceeded 10 m2 ha–1 mortality and 11% had 
complete overstory mortality. Tree mortality occurred primarily in smaller trees and 
mesic species (Abies, Picea), which had undergone the greatest increase since fire 
exclusion. Non-metric multiscale ordination showed that the fires reversed the shift 
away from reference conditions. Understory plant communities appeared resilient 
even to intense burning, although the non-native cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) 
increased (Laughlin and Fulé 2008). Even after a long fire-free period (1880–2003), 
fire effects were mostly consistent with restoration of historical conditions. Fires 
simultaneously reduced living, dead and ladder fuels. These effects make the forests 
more resistant under warmer climate conditions that are expected to increase fire 
size and severity in the twenty-first century (McKenzie et al. 2004).
The future of Grand Canyon forests is uncertain, given current forecasts of 
severe drying in the Southwest (Seager et al. 2007). However, these ecosystems 
have unusual advantages compared to others in the region because they conserve 
the genetic and structural diversity of old trees and native species. The extensive 
burning carried out by managers since the 1980s has extracted a cost in terms of 
escaped fires and unwanted public attention, but it has also provided an increasing 
safety cushion for further burning. Managers in the Kaibab National Forest to the 
north and south of Grand Canyon also collaborate to burn and thin to create defen-
sible boundaries. Fires at Grand Canyon provided the opportunity to test the modern 
calibration of the fire-scarred tree-ring record; it is now encouraging to watch the 
number of scars increase closer toward historical levels as more of the landscape 
is being burned more often. Fire and climate shaped these ecosystems through 
evolutionary and ecological time. Perhaps fire use can help preserve a significant 
part of the forest even as climate changes more rapidly.
