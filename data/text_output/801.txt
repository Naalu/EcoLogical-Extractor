This volume is divided into three sections: (1) Ecological, Biological, and Physical Science; (2) Social and Cultural;
and (3) Economics and Utilization. Effective ecological restoration requires a combination of science and
management. The authors of the first section exemplified this integration in the course of addressing a broad range
of topics, from detailed microsite and small-scale changes in fungal, plant, and animal communities, up through
landscape, regional, and subcontinental scales. Although the themes were diverse, papers were linked by
underscoring the relationship between restorative management actions and ecological effects. Social sciences play
a key role in ecosystem restoration because collaboration, development of common goals, and political and
economic feasibility are essential for success. The authors of the second section focused on public attitudes,
partnerships, and the relationship between social and ecological factors. In the third section, the economics and
utilization of products from forest restoration were compared in several Western locations. Both the markets for these
products and the range of utilization opportunities—from small-diameter logs to energy creation—will surely evolve
rapidly as society moves to address the fire hazards and other problems caused by stressed and weakened
ecosystems. The turn of the century is an appropriate point to capture dramatic changes in perspective: consider
how attitudes toward Western forests have evolved between 1900 and 2000. The papers in this volume chronicle
adaptive research that continues to deepen our understanding of restoration in ecosystems and social systems.

Preface ______________________________________
Contemporary ponderosa pine forests and associated grasslands in the South-
west have changed dramatically since Euro-American settlement in the 1870s.
Intensive grazing, selective harvesting of large trees and fire suppression have led
to changes in forest structure and composition that are unprecedented in the
evolutionary history of these frequent fire ecosystems. The consequences of the
changes include: increased risk of stand-replacing crownfire, decreased biological
diversity, increased vulnerability to disease and insect outbreaks, and increasing
ecosystem health problems that will compromise the long-term viability of ponderosa
pine forests.
Local, State, Federal, and Tribal land management agencies have begun to
address the problems of degraded ponderosa pine forests throughout the Inter-
mountain West. Stakeholders from communities at risk of catastrophic fire and
private landowners have also stepped forward to work collaboratively with land
management agencies to design forest restoration treatments that will not only
protect lives and property but also protect and restore the values and benefits
provided by a healthy forest.
However, crafting scientifically valid and socially acceptable treatments is not
simple. It requires commitment and constructive dialogue among people with
diverse backgrounds and interests. They must be willing to listen to each other and
become informed about ecology, economics, and management challenges, as well
as the philosophical and social sides of forest restoration. Most important, it requires
those people to build a common vision for forest restoration that can be translated
into specific actions and applied by land managers. Given the scope of forest
degradation and the need to act quickly it is essential that the information and lessons
learned actively shared, applied, and adapted to implement the best treatments
possible.
The Steps Toward Stewardship: Ponderosa Pine Ecosystems Restoration
and Conservation conference, held in Flagstaff, AZ on April 25-27, 2000, was
designed to share lessons and emerging research and information critical to
successful ecologically based forest restoration. A diverse group of organizations
representing a broad spectrum of expertise and interests sponsored this first national
conference. The audience included researchers, academics, land managers, citi-
zens, policy makers and other interested stakeholders from across the nation.
Presenters were encouraged to identify critical indicators and benchmarks of
success or failure in ponderosa pine ecosystem restoration and conservation, and
the methods for evaluating these indicators. In addition, panels were designed to
clarify points of agreement and disagreement across interests and disciplines so that
future conservation/restoration research and experiments can advance understand-
ing of these issues. Finally, participants were encouraged to identify missing
elements—such as research, monitoring, or other factors—that are critical to
develop effective conservation and restoration practices for ponderosa pine forest
ecosystems.

Abstract—Dendroecological forest reconstruction techniques are
used to estimate presettlement structure of northern Arizona pon-
derosa pine forests. To test the accuracy of these techniques, we
remeasured 10 of the oldest forest plots in Arizona, a subset of 51
historical plots established throughout the region from 1909 to
1913, and compared reconstruction outputs to historical data col-
lected. Results of this analysis revealed several distinct sources of
error: (1) After about 90 years, 94 percent of the recorded trees were
relocated and remeasured, but approximately three trees/ha were
missing in the field due to obliteration by fire or decay; (2) sizes of
trees living in 1909 were overestimated by an average of 11.9
percent; (3) snag and log decomposition models tended to un-
derestimate time since tree death by an undetermined amount; and
(4) historical sizes of cut trees were difficult to estimate due to
uncertainties concerning harvest dates. The aggregate effect of
these errors was to overestimate the number of trees occurring in
1909–1913. Sensitivity analysis applied to decomposition equations
showed variations in reconstructed sizes of snags and logs by ± 7
percent and stand density estimates by 7 percent. Results suggest
that these reconstruction techniques are robust but tend to overes-
timate tree size and forest density.
Introduction ____________________
Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Douglas ex P. Lawson &
Lawson) forest ecosystems in northern Arizona have under-
gone dramatic physiognomic changes over the past 120
years (Covington and Moore 1994a; Covington and others
1997; Fulé and others 1997). Logging, fire suppression, and
overgrazing in the latter part of the 19th century created
conditions suitable for a population explosion of pine regen-
eration. Open parklike stands, maintained by frequent sur-
face fires prior to Euro-American settlement (about 1876) of
the region, have been replaced by closed canopied forests
with resulting deleterious effects on biological diversity and

ecological function (Covington and Moore 1994a). Associ-
ated biomass accumulation and the development of fuel
ladders represent extreme fire hazards and expose these
forests to an increased potential for stand-replacing crown
fires. Restoration of ecological processes and structure holds
promise for reestablishing indigenous levels of biological
diversity and ecological function in northern Arizona ponde-
rosa pine forests (Covington and Moore 1994b; Covington
and others 1997).
Treatments designed to restore ponderosa pine ecosys-
tems are based on an understanding of presettlement struc-
tural and compositional characteristics that are collectively
known as reference conditions. Forest reconstruction is one
tool used to estimate reference conditions. Techniques for
reconstruction include dendrochronological measurement
of fire scars and increment cores from stumps, logs, and
living trees, direct measurement of remnant woody evi-
dence, and backwards radial growth modeling (Fulé and
others 1997). Forest structural information generated by
reconstruction includes past diameter distribution and stand
density estimates. The precision of these analyses is highly
dependent on field identification of presettlement evidence,
dendrochronological proficiency, and relationships utilized
in “reverse” growth and decay modeling. Our objective in
this study was to use data from historically measured forest
plots to test the precision of our forest reconstruction tech-
niques. Specifically, we wanted to (1) test our ability to
identify historically measured trees in the field, (2) compare
reconstruction model outputs such as stand density and tree
sizes to historical data, and (3) identify key sources of error
associated with the reconstruction process.
Background ____________________
Between 1909 and 1913, a series of 51 permanent plots
were established within the ponderosa vegetation type
throughout Arizona and New Mexico (Woolsey 1911, 1912).
The purpose of these plots was to increase understanding of
western yellow pine (now ponderosa) growth, regeneration,
and management. These are the oldest known ponderosa
pine sample plots in the Southwest. Plots of around 1 to 6 ha
(2 to 14 acres) were established on areas where up to two-
thirds of the standing overstory volume had recently been
harvested. The permanently marked plots were subdivided
into 20 m (66 ft) grids wherein all trees greater than 10.16
cm (4 inches) in diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) (1.4 m)
were mapped. Measurements for these trees included d.b.h.,

height, vigor, and age class. The USDA Forest Service
remeasured these plots every 5 years until the studies were
abandoned around 1934–1939. In the mid-1990s, we began
to uncover the historical data and maps associated with the
“Woolsey” plots. In 1996, we initiated a project to relocate
and remeasure as many of the historic plots as possible. By
2000, we had remeasured and applied reconstruction analy-
sis to 15 plots. This paper describes the results of analysis of
10 plots located near Flagstaff, Arizona.
Methods _______________________
Study Area
The 10 historical plots used in this study are within a 24-
km radius of Flagstaff (35∞8'N latitude, 111∞40'W longi-
tude), Arizona, on the Coconino National Forest (fig. 1).
Elevation at the sites ranged from around 2,100 to 2,200 m.
Average annual precipitation in the area is 50.3 cm with
about half falling in winter as snow and the other as rain
associated with a mid-summer monsoon pattern. Mean
annual temperature is 7.5 ∞C. The soil of the area is a stony
clay loam of basalt derivation.
Ponderosa pine is the dominant overstory species of the
area often occurring in pure stands or mixed with Gambel
oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt.). Important understory species
include grasses, Festuca arizonica Vasey, Muhlenbergia
montana (Nutt.) Hitchc., Blepharoneuron tricholepis (Torr.)
Nash, and Sitanion hystrix (Nutt.) J.G. Smith, and forbs,
Achillea millefolium var. occidentalis D.C., Pseudocymop-
terus montanus (Gray) Coult. & Rose, Erigeron divergens
Torr & Gray, and Potentilla crinita Gray. Shrubs are not
common but include scattered populations of Ceanothus
fendleri Gray and Rosa woodsii Lindl.
Remeasurement of Historical Plots
The 10 plots, originally established in 1909 (eight plots)
and 1913 (two plots) were remeasured in 1997–1999. We
used copies of the stem maps drawn in 1915 to relocate plot
corners and grid intersections. Although the historical plots
ranged in size, we standardized our methods to remeasure
subplots of 1.02 ha (2.5 acres), systematically originating
from the northwest corners of the original plots. After
consulting historical maps to determine plot orientation, we
used a transit, staff compass, and tape to reestablish the
original grid system as truly as possible. Subplots con-
sisted of 25 grid cells of approximately 404 m2 each. After
subplots were established, 1915 maps were not referenced
again until after remeasurement had been completed. Due
to the size of the subplots, results presented here are inter-
preted in terms of trees per hectare.
Grid cells within subplots were thoroughly searched and
all structures equal to or greater than 1.4 m in height, either
presently or at some past time, were numbered and tagged.
Tree structures included live trees, snags, logs, stumps, and
stump holes. Diameter at breast height (d.b.h.; measured at
1.4 m above the ground) and/or diameter at stump height
(d.s.h.; measured at 40 cm), total tree height, condition class
(1–9), and age class (presettlement, “preplot”, or postsettle-
ment; see below) were recorded for all tree structures. For
stump holes, d.s.h. was estimated. Tree condition classes
followed a classification system commonly used in ponde-
rosa pine forests (Maser and others 1979; Thomas and others
1979). The nine classes were as follows: (1) live, (2) fading,
(3) recently dead, (4) loose bark snag, (5) clean snag, (6) snag
broken above breast height, (7) snag broken below breast
height, (8) dead and down, and (9) cut stump.
In the field, age classifications were based on tree size and
bark characteristics and then verified when possible in the
laboratory. Tree ages were grouped in the field into three
categories: presettlement, preplot, and postplot. Structures
greater than 37.5 cm d.b.h., clearly yellow-barked, or dead,
large, and highly decayed, were presumed to be greater than
100 years old (White 1985) and classified as presettlement in
age. We classified trees as “preplot-aged” (in other words,
established prior to historical plot measurement) if they did
not meet presettlement classification criteria (for example,
did not have yellow bark) but were larger than a predeter-
mined size. Preplot size was determined for individual
subplots by measuring diameter and field aging a sample
(10) of nearby trees. Ponderosa pine with bark appearing
transitional in age between yellow barked and black barked
trees were located just outside the subplot boundaries and
cored at 40 cm. Ring counts were made and the results were
compared with the plot establishment date. The average
diameter of trees within 10 years of the plot establishment
date was used as the preplot size cutoff. Live trees of this size
or larger without yellow bark were classified as preplot-
aged. In some cases, preplot size was not different than
presettlement (37.5 cm at d.b.h.) and classification was
made based on bark characteristics. Trees with black bark
and smaller than the minimum presettlement and preplot
diameters were classified as postplot.
Diameter at stump height and crown radius (average of
two measurements) was measured for all presettlement and
preplot ponderosa pine trees. For species other than ponde-
rosa pine, d.s.h. was measured on all trees. Increment cores
were collected at 40 cm for all trees greater than 37.5 cm
d.b.h. and for oak and juniper species greater than 17 cm.
Additionally, increment cores were collected and d.s.h. and

crown radius was measured for a 20 percent random sub-
sample of live postplot (all species) trees. Increment cores
were stored in paper straws until denrochronological analy-
sis could be done in the laboratory. Dendrochronological
analysis involved cross-dating cores (Stokes and Smiley
1996) against known annual ring patterns (Graybill 1987)
and measuring radial increments from the year prior to core
collection (1997–1999) to the year of plot establishment
(1909–1913). Radial increments to fire exclusion date (1876;
Fulé and others 1997) were also measured. Our age classifi-
cation scheme was designed to assure that detailed data,
including increment cores, were collected for all trees that
were historically measured or presettlement in age. It also
allowed comparisons to be made regarding changes in age
structure on these plots since establishment.
Analyses
Field Identification of Historical Trees—Historical
trees were identified in the field by noting tree locations
displayed on 1915 maps and examining structures mea-
sured on subplots. Historical trees not measured on subplots
(in other words, missed during remeasurement) were noted
and the error rate was calculated as follows: Error = (number
missed/number on historical map) * 100. A weighted aver-
age for error incorporating all 10 plots was calculated as
follows: Error = (total number missed over all subplots/total
number of historical trees over all subplots) * 100.
Reconstruction Modeling—Field measurements and
increment core data were entered into a computerized stand
reconstruction model (Covington and others, unpublished).
The model applies a series of mathematical functions to field
data in order to estimate tree diameters (d.b.h.) and death
dates for a particular point in time that is defined by the
user. Growth functions employed were gleaned from empiri-
cal growth (Myers 1963) and decay studies (Rogers and
others 1984) of Southwestern ponderosa pine as well as
other species. Sizes of live trees for which increment cores
were collected were reconstructed by subtracting twice the
radial increment from field recorded tree diameters. Sizes of
trees for which no cores were collected or for which core data
were unusable were estimated by applying “reverse” growth
functions. Dead trees were moved backward through decay
classes (Maser and others 1979; Thomas and others 1979)
until an estimated death date was reached, before which the
reverse growth function was applied. Separate equations
were used for blackjack and yellow pine age classes. For cut
trees (stumps) measured in the field, trees were grown in
reverse prior to a cut date that we defined in the model.
For our analyses, we compared stand density and tree
diameter output from the reconstruction model with data
available from the historical ledgers. Because data in his-
torical ledgers was restricted to trees greater than or equal
to 10.16 cm d.b.h., we limited our analysis of stand density
to trees of this size. To test reconstruction sensitivity, we
varied cut date and decay rate parameters in the model.
Cut dates of 1910 (1914 for the two plots established in
1913), 1945, and 1980 were tested for field-measured stumps,
and dead/down trees were moved backward through decay
classes at rates corresponding to the 25th, 50th, and 75th
percentiles found in other studies (Roger and others 1984).
Thus, five model iterations were done for each subplot
reconstructed to historical establishment dates. Size errors
were calculated as follows: Error = (Reconstructed d.b.h. -
Historical d.b.h./ Historical d.b.h.) * 100.
Results ________________________
Field Identification of Historical Trees
Nearly all the trees mapped and recorded in 1909 and
1913 were found on the 10 subplots (table 1). The number of
trees missed ranged from 0 to 9 and the overall error rate was
5.7 percent. Historical trees were found in all condition
classes from highly decomposed remnant structures to live
trees still bearing 90-year-old tags. Frequently, missed trees
were highly decomposed and little evidence was observable.
A high rate of identification was possible although dense
stand conditions existed at the time of subplot remeasure-
ment (1997–1999); there was an average of 1,379 total
structures across the 10 subplots. No clear relationship was
observed between the number of trees missed and the
number that were historically measured. However, the
greatest number of trees were missed on the subplot with the
greatest total number of structures at remeasurement.
Reconstruction Model
Historical Tree Diameter—Diameter reconstruction of
historical trees that were still alive at remeasurement over-
estimated d.b.h. by an average of 11.9 percent (table 2). We
found a slight trend of increased error for smaller trees
(fig. 2). There were no subplots on which tree diameter was
underestimated. Unexpectedly large errors (greater than 60
percent) resulted for diameter reconstruction of unusually
fast- or slow-growing trees for which increment data were
unavailable (rotten tree centers, incomplete cores, and so
forth).

Ponderosa Pine Forest Reconstruction: Comparisons With Historical Data
Error for diameter reconstruction of historical trees that
were dead and down at remeasurement averaged –0.6 per-
cent (table 3). Sensitivity analysis showed that dead and
down were most accurately reconstructed when moved
through decay classes at the 50th percentile rate. Varying
decay rate to the 25th percentile slowed movement through
decay classes, resulting in earlier estimated death dates and
a greater overestimate of historical diameters. Conversely,
decay rate set to the 75th percentile sped movement through
decay classes, resulting in later estimated death dates and
an underestimate of historical diameters. Thus, varying
decomposition rates altered size estimates by approximately
7 percent. Due to limited sample sizes for most plots, the
overall average was heavily influenced by subplot S2A.

cal trees alive at remeasurement. Error compares

Diameter reconstruction of historical trees that had been
cut since original plot establishment (1909–1913) was most
accurate when the cut date in the model was set to 1980
(table 4). This was true for every subplot except S4A for
which diameter estimates were most accurate when the cut
date was set to 1945. Averaged over all subplots, diameter
reconstruction of cut trees overestimated d.b.h. at plot estab-
lishment by 11.4 percent.

establishment to be mapped, (3) trees that had died or been
cut prior to plot establishment, and (4) large trees for which
no increment core data existed. Tree density estimates were
also affected by variations in decay functions used in the
model. Varying the rate at which dead and downed material
moved through decay class by 25 percent altered estimated
tree densities by approximately 7 percent.
To more clearly evaluate reconstructed tree densities
(1945 cut date and 50th decay percentile) we subtracted
large cut trees that were not historically recorded, as well as
trees for which increment core center dates were less than
plot establishment dates. We presumed these to represent
trees cut prior to plot establishment and trees too small to be
historically measured, respectively. Subtraction resulted
in tree density overestimates of 10–51 trees per subplot
(table 5). Trees reconstructed in excess of historical densi-
ties were mainly dead and down trees for which death dates
were inaccurately estimated.
Conclusions____________________
Evaluation of reconstruction techniques revealed several
key sources of error. These included field identification of
historical trees, size reconstruction of live trees, and deter-
mination of tree death dates. Forest structures on the
subplots were readily identified in the field after ± 90 years.
Missed trees resulted in an underestimate of stand density
by 5.7 percent or about three trees per hectare. Factors not
addressed in this analysis but that may affect success rate of
identification include disturbance such as fire, time, and
experience level of personnel. Very little disturbance, out-
side of individual tree selection harvest, occurred on the
subplots in this study. Intense fire had not occurred on any
of the subplots since establishment and precommercial thin-
ning had occurred only in S3A and S3B. No clear pattern

aNumber adjusted by removing cut trees that were not originally tagged.
These trees were likely cut prior to plot establishment or large regeneration
thinned such as on S3A and S3B.
bNumber adjusted by removing trees not in original ledger data but having
increment core center dates of less than or equal to plot establishment date
(1909–1913). These trees were likely large regeneration that were less than
10.16 cm d.b.h. in 1909–1913.
related to initial or present density of forest structures
emerged to affect identification success. Identification of
presettlement-aged structural evidence is important for imple-
menting ecological restoration prescriptions in northern
Arizona ponderosa pine forests (Covington and others 1997).
The reconstruction model tested in this analysis tended
to overestimate tree diameters for live trees (11.9 percent),
slightly underestimate (–0.6 percent) dead and downed
trees, and overestimate trees that had been cut (11.4 per-
cent). For live trees, slightly greater inaccuracies were
produced for smaller size classes. Possible explanations for
live-tree errors include model equations used to predict bark
thickness and d.b.h. from d.s.h. (Myers 1963; Hann 1976),
unusable increment cores, particularly for trees that were
especially fast- or slow-growing, and eccentricity of tree bases.
Although prediction of tree death date is difficult due to
factors affecting snag longevity and condition, the d.b.h. esti-
mates provided by the reconstruction model were relatively
accurate. Accuracy here was likely affected by the interac-
tion of death date estimates and reverse growth functions.
In our analysis, global cut dates were set in the model,
although in reality, trees on the subplots were not all cut in
the same year. This undoubtedly affected d.b.h. reconstruc-
tion errors. Cut dates for harvested “cohorts” could be
individually coded in the model using additional informa-
tion not examined in this study such as harvest records and
stump decay classes.
Overestimation of d.b.h. coupled with death date and cut
date uncertainties lead to overestimates of past tree density.
However, our reconstruction techniques allowed reductions
of these estimates based on increment core data and sizes of
cut trees. Refinement of decay functions may allow better
accuracy in stand density reconstruction.
The reconstruction techniques evaluated in this study
appear to be robust and useful for estimating past forest
structural characteristics. Although the model was used
generally, adjustments could be made for specific sites using
relationships developed from site-specific field data. The
reconstruction techniques allow a better understanding of
reference conditions in ponderosa pine forests of the South-
west. Further analysis will be done to reconstruct presettle-
ment structural conditions on these plots.

Abstract—An unlogged and ungrazed ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir
landscape in the Colorado Front Range provides critical information
for restoring forests in the South Platte watershed. A frame-based
model was used to describe the relationship among the four
primary patch conditions in the 35-km2 Cheesman Lake landscape:
(1) openings, (2) ponderosa pine forest, (3) ponderosa pine/Douglas-
fir forest, and (4) persistent old growth. Each condition is possible
over time at any nonriparian site, with fire and tree recruitment the
primary processes causing changes from one condition to another.
The Forest Vegetation Simulator model was used to estimate forest
conditions at Cheesman Lake in 1900, prior to fire suppression
effects. These results and 1896 Cheesman Lake photographs indi-
cate that more than 90 percent of the historical landscape had a
crown closure of 30 percent or less, compared with less than 50
percent of current nearby forests affected by logging, grazing, tree
planting, and fire suppression. The historical fire regime was mixed
severity, and passive crown fire was probably more common than
active crown fire. Currently, surrounding forests have almost no
openings, little old growth, high tree density, and increased Dou-
glas-fir. Fire behavior has switched to a crown fire regime with
sometimes catastrophic results. Historical Cheesman Lake forest
landscape conditions are being used to guide restoration of sur-
rounding forests.
Introduction ____________________
Restoration of ponderosa pine forests to ecologically sus-
tainable conditions requires knowledge of historical condi-
tions and processes that shaped natural landscapes. Until
recently, studies from the Southwestern United States pro-
vided the majority of scientific literature describing ponde-
rosa pine stand and landscape structure and the natural
processes affecting these forests (Cooper 1960; Covington
and Moore 1994; Fulé and others 1997; Mast and others

1999; Moore and others 1999; Pearson 1933; Swetnam and
Baisan 1996; Swetnam and others 1999; White 1985; Woolsey
1911). Pine forests in the Southwest historically were char-
acterized by a low-intensity surface fire regime, with fires
typically occurring over large areas every 2 to 10 years or
more. Stands were described as open and parklike, with
productive grassy understories and few small trees. Several
reports suggest that the fire frequency in other regions was
lower but maintained similar open stands in less productive
northern systems (Arno and others 1995; Goldblum and
Veblen 1992). Reconstructions of historical stand struc-
tures in both the Southwest and other regions have been
attempted, but little information on structure of histori-
cal ponderosa pine forests at a landscape scale has been
available.
Research is being conducted on a 35-km2 forest area at
Cheesman Lake in the Colorado Front Range. Land around
Cheesman Lake, a reservoir owned by Denver Water, has
never been logged and has been protected from grazing since
1905, when the dam for the reservoir was completed. This
research provides a description of a ponderosa pine land-
scape that evolved with a mixed severity fire regime (Brown
and others 1999; Kaufmann and others 2000a,b). Mixed
severity fires differ from the frequent low intensity surface
fire regime of the Southwest in that individual fire events
generally are less frequent and have a patchy crown fire
component along with surface fire. They differ from crown
fire regimes because the crown fire component is smaller
and much more patchy. The Cheesman Lake climate ap-
pears to be less influenced by the El Niño pattern and is drier
than the climate in the Southwestern United States. Fire
history data at Cheesman Lake span eight centuries, with
the earliest fire scar sampled dating to 1197 (Brown and
others 1999). Maps of fire scar locations shown by Brown
and others and additional unpublished data of other fire
scar locations indicate that large fires (5–10 km2 or larger)
occurred in 1496, 1534, 1587, 1631, 1696, 1723, 1775, 1820,
1851, and 1880. The only significant fire since 1880 was in
1963, when a fire in the southeast portion of the Cheesman
Lake landscape was suppressed after reaching a size of
around 25 ha. A moderate number of more localized fires
occurred between the larger fires. In addition, extensive
studies of tree age and size indicated that tree recruitment
occurred in pulses, each about 10 years long (Kaufmann and
others 2000b). The recruitment pulses tended to coincide

with the larger fires; most of the major fires occurred during
these pulses, but not necessarily in a cause and effect
sequence.
Kaufmann and others (2000a) suggested that relatively
infrequent fire and gaps between tree recruitment pulses
reflect unfavorable interim climatic conditions for both pro-
duction of herbaceous vegetation (needed for fuel) and tree
seed germination and establishment. In many of their
plots, the age of the oldest tree at specific locations in the
Cheesman Lake landscape indicated that all trees post-
dated certain fires identified in the study area by the fire
history analysis (Brown and others 1999). Similar results
were observed in western Montana (Arno and others 1995).
These data strongly suggest that the crown fire component
of past fires killed all trees in certain areas and created
openings. The current oldest trees reflect the dates trees
were recruited into each opening. An expansion of this
analysis is given in another paper in these proceedings
(Huckaby and others).
Fire and tree recruitment patterns are key processes
affecting landscape structure and change over time in the
Cheesman Lake landscape. In this paper we describe the
four primary types of forest patches that make up the upland
landscape. These four components are interchangeable in
that they potentially can occur at any upland site over time.
The components are useful for describing not only the
historical landscape, but also forests that were altered
following European settlement. While riparian areas are
critical components occupying 1–2 percent of the landscape,
they are separate from the upland sites and are not included
in our analysis of the upland areas.
We use a frame-based model to discuss the factors that
cause transitions of the upland conditions from one state to
another (Starfield and others 1993). In addition, we use a
forest growth model to “degrow” the Cheesman Lake land-
scape to assess its condition prior to the effects of fire
suppression during the 20th century. These “degrown” con-
ditions are compared with historical photographs of the
Cheesman Lake landscape. Finally, we discuss implications
of presettlement fire behavior and landscape structure on
current restoration activities in the South Platte watershed.
Primary Upland Components______
Ponderosa pine forests in the historical Cheesman Lake
landscape and elsewhere in the Colorado Front Range are
relatively simple in that only two species, ponderosa pine
and Douglas-fir, comprise the vast majority of trees (Jack
1900; Kaufmann and others 2000b; Peet 1981; Veblen and
Lorenz 1986). While fire suppression during the last cen-
tury is believed to have increased forest density at Cheesman
Lake (discussed later), diversity in age and diameter class
distributions, tree density, proportions of the two species,
and patch size make the landscape structure very complex,
driven by both topography and natural disturbance his-
tory. In an adjacent logged landscape, other species (Colo-
rado blue spruce, aspen, narrow-leaf cottonwood, and Rocky
Mountain juniper) are more significant, especially in low-
land areas (Kaufmann 2000b). We mapped and classified
the entire 35-km2 landscape using an overstory classifica-
tion template created from extensive plot data (data
summarized in Kaufmann and others 2000b) in conjunc-
tion with 1:6000 color infrared photographs. Over 3,000
polygons in the historical landscape were classified by
percent crown closure in six distinct diameter distribution
classes. While polygon characteristics are still being ana-
lyzed in GIS, the mapping and classification effort provides
a basis for understanding landscape dynamics discussed
here.
Examination of plot and polygon data and extensive field
observations indicate that four basic stand conditions are
found in the Cheesman Lake landscape (fig. 1). These are
roughly based on stand development stages and succes-
sional trajectories. The conditions are (1) openings veg-
etated primarily with grasses and shrubs, (2) patches that
are pure or nearly pure ponderosa pine, (3) patches having
both ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir, and (4) patches having
very old trees, which we term “persistent old growth.”
Openings presently existing in the Cheesman Lake land-
scape have coarse woody debris dated to 1851, a year in
which a large fire occurred (Brown and others 1999). Only
one opening of 49 was found having no coarse woody debris
(Tobler 2000), indicating that nearly all openings are a
transient patch condition in the landscape. The pine and
pine/Douglas-fir patches have a specific characteristic dis-
tinguishing them from persistent old growth: a cap or upper
limit on the age of the oldest trees in the patch. This suggests
that they developed following a stand-replacing natural
disturbance, most likely fire (Kaufmann and others 2000b).
The oldest trees may be quite old (more than 400 years), but
even the oldest trees in these patches postdate known fires.
In contrast, the persistent old-growth patches appear to be
regulated primarily by microscale disturbances that kill
only one or a few trees at a time, such as heartrot, insect
attack, windthrow, or very small fires. Trees in these patches
have a wide age distribution (some may be more than 500
years old), with varying states of health, and a large amount
of coarse woody debris is common.

Model Description
The relationships among the forest patch conditions shown
in figure 1 and the key processes affecting the transitions
between them are shown in a frame-based model, where
each frame represents a potential condition that can exist on
a site (fig. 2). Extensive field data on fire history and tree
recruitment indicate that the following processes affect
transitions among states. First, tree recruitment converts
openings created by fire to forest (fig. 2, arrows with small
trees). Ponderosa pine patches develop when recruitment is
limited to this single species. Age data for a large number of
field plots suggest that historically, pure ponderosa pine
stands developed on most east, south, and west slopes. In
contrast, mixtures of ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir trees
often were recruited on north aspects. Tree age data indicate
that in the 1900s (during which fire suppression occurred),
patches became much more dense, and many pure ponde-
rosa pine patches were converted to mixed patches through
ingrowth of Douglas-fir.

Cheesman Lake—A Historical Ponderosa Pine Landscape Guiding Restoration…
Persistent old-growth patches in our model require very
old trees, which we define to be the condition in which trees
die predominately from natural causes other than stand-
replacing fires. Recruitment occurs where small openings
provide enough resources for new trees to be incorporated
into the stand. While the oldest trees generally are ponde-
rosa pine, older Douglas-fir trees are found in many persis-
tent old-growth patches (Huckaby and others, this proceed-
ings). We have observed a few pine trees more than 600 years
old, some over 500, and many exceeding 400 years. Trees
recruited after the fire in 1496 could be 500 years old, and we
are not confident in suggesting that these trees reflect
recruitment after a stand-replacing fire in 1496 because
many trees die for reasons other than fire before reaching an
age of 500 years. We are more confident suggesting that
trees postdating the 1531 fire reflect a stand-replacing
event (Huckaby and others, this proceedings). A caveat in
suggesting that polygon reforestation postdates specific
fires, however, is that there always is the possibility that
older trees predating the indicated fire may have died of
other causes. Nonetheless, extensive data over a large por-
tion of the landscape suggest that age caps related to stand-
replacing fires are common, and these age caps are useful for
understanding landscape dynamics (Arno and others 1995;
Kaufmann and others 2000a,b; Huckaby and others, this
proceedings).
Fire is almost certainly the primary process creating
openings of 1 ha or more in the landscape (fig. 2, arrows
with flames). There is little likelihood that other natural
disturbance factors such as insects, disease, or wind could
have resulted in complete mortality in this system (Kaufmann
and others 2000b). Stand-replacing fires were probably
more common in ponderosa pine and pine/Douglas-fir forest
patches and less common in persistent old growth. Charac-
teristics of stand-replacing fires in the historical Cheesman
Lake landscape are discussed later. All fires undoubtedly
had a surface fire component, and under certain conditions
surface fires may have reduced ingrowth of younger Douglas-
fir, thereby converting mixtures of pine and Douglas-fir back
to pure or nearly pure ponderosa pine.
Model Parameters
Tree age, density, species composition, and fire history
data provide insight into probabilities of changes among
components in the frame model shown in figure 2. Table 1
provides criteria we have adopted to distinguish among the
four patch conditions. We believe these criteria are suitable
for most of the ponderosa pine forest area of the South Platte
basin. Openings are defined as areas that have 10 percent or
less crown closure. We distinguish between pure ponderosa
pine and ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir patches based upon
basal area or density of trees. Patches having more than 10
percent of the basal area or more than 20 percent of the trees

occurred with a mean interval of about 43 years in the
35-km2 landscape. This estimate is shorter than the 59
years estimated by Brown and others (1999) because it
includes three fires (1775, 1820, and 1880) not included in
the earlier analysis. These fires were included here based
upon additional evidence of fire scars not available earlier.
When the fire scar sampling area was divided into 11
smaller areas of 0.5-2 km2 each based upon sampling
clusters and topography, the mean fire interval for all
areas was 50 years, with a range of 29 to 83 years. Studies
are under way to assess fire intervals in other portions of
the South Platte watershed.
Tree age data for a 4-km2 portion of the Cheesman Lake
landscape were obtained by dating cores collected 30–40 cm
above the ground, and correcting the pith age for the esti-
mated time required after germination to reach the coring
height (Kaufmann and others 2000b). These data indicated
that most tree recruitment occurred in pulses lasting about
a decade each (see fig. 6 in Kaufmann and others 2000b). For
a 421-year period between the 1560s and 1980s, half of the
surviving trees in 25 0.1-ha plots in the Cheesman Lake
landscape were recruited in these pulses, which accounted
for only one-fourth of the time. The mean interval between
recruitment pulses was about 45 years, which agrees closely
with the MFI for the area (table 2).
Current and Historical Landscape
Crown Closure__________________
A frame model is useful for assessing how important
processes and conditions affect patch dynamics over time
and space at a landscape scale. We are addressing the
application of a frame model at a landscape scale by exam-
ining landscape structure at several points in time. At the
initial stages of this application, we are focusing on diameter
class distribution and crown closure, which we can estimate
using 1:6000 color infrared photographs. The infrared pho-
tographs cannot be used to map and classify patches based
upon species composition, but they provide a basis for
mapping by diameter class distribution and crown closure.
The map of percent crown closure in figure 3 (left) was
developed from photographs taken in 1996. This map indi-
cates that current crown closure varies widely, with many
areas having very open forest (10–30 percent crown closure)
and others dense forest (more than 45 percent).
A tree growth model, Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS,
USDA Forest Service 1999), was used with polygon data on
tree diameter class distribution and density to “degrow”
patches back to 1900, the time just before fire suppression
efforts may have begun on the landscape. FVS cannot be run
backward in time; however, through a trial and error process
Figure 3—Crown closure percent for the Cheesman Lake landscape. The 1996 map was developed from 1:6000 color
infrared photographs and a patch classification template based on plot data. The 1900 map was developed using the
Forest Vegetation Simulator to estimate conditions that, projected forward, yielded conditions observed in 1996.

average stand conditions can be identified for earlier periods
that, when grown forward, are comparable to current stand
conditions. Stand conditions for 1900 were accepted when
FVS projections to 1996 agreed well with current (1996)
estimates of stand size class distributions and densities.
While a number of simple assumptions about tree recruit-
ment rates and mortality will be reexamined, an initial
version of the landscape condition in 1900 derived from
these calculations is shown in figure 3 (right). Differences
between 1996 and 1900 are dramatic, yet the very low forest
densities estimated for 1900 agree very well with age struc-
ture data for plots with 20th century trees removed and with
the open forest structure shown in historical photographs.
Historical photographs taken in 1896 near the site being
selected at the time for the Cheesman Lake dam (Denver
Water archives, Denver, Colorado) augment our understand-
ing of forest structure at several locations in the Cheesman
Lake landscape prior to the effects of 20th century fire
suppression. While some grazing undoubtedly had occurred
late in the 19th century (primarily along the river), effects on
forest structure in the photographed areas are believed to be
negligible. Nor was logging a factor, based upon archived
records of logging history in the area (South Platte District
Office of the Pike/San Isabel National Forest). However, fire
suppression limited burning to a single wildfire smaller
than 100 ha in 1963. The photograph in figure 4 includes an
area in the foreground known to have burned in the 1880
fire, probably resulting in the dead trees on the ground.
Across the valley (which is presently part of the reservoir),
the far left background shows openings that we believe were
created by a fire in 1851. The area in the center across the
valley presently has many old trees, indicating it was largely
free of stand-replacing fire for at least several centuries,
even though fires occurred there in 1631, 1696, 1820, and
1880 (Brown and others 1999). Figure 4 and other historical
photographs of unlogged areas show a generally very low
historical forest density, a limited number of small trees,
and an understory dominated by grasses and shrubs.
Since fire suppression, however, stands have become
denser both in the Cheesman Lake landscape and in all
nearby areas where logging and grazing occurred. Ingrowth
of Douglas-fir is common on all aspects and has converted
many ponderosa pine stands into mixtures of the two spe-
cies. Paired photographs in the Cheesman Lake landscape
from 1903 and 1999 (fig. 5) illustrate the change in forest
density and loss of openings (right background) along the
South Platte River just below the Cheesman Lake dam. A
notable exception to the increased forest density in the
Cheesman Lake landscape is the area burned in 1963. This
area, which had previously burned in 1851, was thinned
dramatically by the 1963 fire, leaving a forest structure
similar to that found in figure 4.
Polygon crown closure data were compared in GIS for the
1996 Cheesman Lake and adjacent Turkey Creek land-
scapes, and for the Cheesman Lake landscape degrown to
1900. The Turkey Creek polygon data were for a 4-km2 study
area just outside the historical landscape. This landscape
was logged in the 1890s and typifies other forests in the
South Platte watershed, though other areas logged earlier
may be denser. The landscape area for low, medium, and
high crown closure is shown in figure 6. These data suggest
that in 1996 only 55 percent of the Cheesman Lake land-
scape and 47 percent of the Turkey Creek landscape had
crown closures of 30 percent or less. However, we estimate
that in 1900 over 90 percent of the Cheesman Lake land-
scape had crown closures no greater than 30 percent. The
amount of the landscape having a crown closure of 30
percent or less is significant, because at these tree densities
fires usually do not spread from crown to crown. Though
preliminary, these estimates and historical photographs
support the widely held view that earlier ponderosa pine
forests in the Colorado Front Range were much less dense
than presently found.

The proportion of the overall landscape we estimated to be
occupied by each of the four patch conditions in figures 1 and
2 is shown in figure 7. The upper portion (Historical to
Settlement) depicts proportions that we believe occurred the
last several centuries before the effects of settlement. The
illustration refers only to upland areas and does not include
riparian areas (1–2 percent of the landscape) or meadows
existing along the South Platte River before the reservoir
was completed. The proportions are based on examinations
of tree ages for ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir trees over a
range of topographic conditions and over a large portion of
the landscape (Kaufmann and others 2000b; Huckaby and
others, this proceedings). As noted earlier, data indicate that

Figure 7—Estimated proportions for the four components of the ponderosa pine/
Douglas-fir forest landscape in the South Platte watershed. The period from
Historical to Settlement reflects information from Cheesman Lake in the absence
of logging, grazing, or fire suppression effects. The period from Settlement to
Current reflects changes in forest conditions found in much of the logged and
grazed South Platte watershed. The period from Current to Restored reflects
landscape changes that might occur under a restoration scenario.
before settlement most trees on east, south, and west slopes
were ponderosa pine, whereas Douglas-fir and ponderosa
pine occurred in roughly equal proportions on north slopes.
We estimate that about 15 percent of the landscape had
persistent old-growth patches (fig. 7). Pure ponderosa pine
patches (see table 1 for characteristics) probably accounted
for 35–50 percent of the landscape, primarily on east, south,
and west slopes. Ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir patches on
north slopes and portions of upper ridges may have ac-
counted for 20–30 percent of the landscape, and at least 25
percent of the landscape was open, with no more than 10
percent tree crown closure. Undoubtedly these proportions
varied over time, especially when fires created openings,
reduced tree densities, or killed young Douglas-fir trees
invading patches. Furthermore, tree densities (represented
by shading in fig. 7) and the amount of Douglas-fir are likely
to have increased within each category as time since fire
increased.
The middle portion of figure 7 indicates general shifts we
estimate occurred in the forest components of areas outside
the historical landscape. These estimates are based on mea-
surements in the adjacent logged Turkey Creek landscape
and on observations of forest structure throughout the South
Platte watershed. The shifts in patch proportions reflect the
effects of logging, grazing, fire suppression, and transplant-
ing, all of which are likely to increase forest density. Logging
decreased the amount of persistent old growth. Grazing
probably reduced understory competition and allowed the
establishment of new seedlings, and the lack of fire allowed
the seedlings to survive. The result was a sharp increase in
forest density, expansion of the area having a significant
Douglas-fir component, and the loss of most openings that
temporarily increased during logging. The Current to Re-
stored portion of figure 7 is discussed below.
Implications About Fire
Behavior _______________________
The current condition of ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir for-
ests in the Colorado Front Range favors a crown fire regime,
with a high risk of catastrophic stand-replacing fires. The
Buffalo Creek fire in 1996, about 10 miles north of Cheesman
Lake, burned 4,800 ha (11,900 acres), of which 3,000 ha
(7,500 acres) was a crown fire that traveled 11 miles in 41⁄2
hours. Forest conditions here are similar to those through-
out much of the West, with high tree densities favoring
crown fires (Covington and Moore 1994).

Cheesman Lake—A Historical Ponderosa Pine Landscape Guiding Restoration…
Kaufmann, Fornwalt, Huckaby, and Stoker
Strong evidence suggests that the historical fire behavior
at Cheesman Lake followed a mixed severity fire regime,
which is characterized by a combination of surface fire and
patchy crown fire occurring within the fire perimeter. Data
suggest that many forest patches have an age cap, indicating
regeneration following a stand-replacing disturbance (fire),
while other patches nearby retained much older trees
(Huckaby and others, this proceedings; Kaufmann and oth-
ers 2000b). We originally hypothesized that the mixed sever-
ity fire pattern creating the openings resulted from long
intervals between fires, during which stand density and fuel
ladder conditions increased. These conditions would have
led to forest patches burning by active crown fire (fire
spreading both on the surface and tree-to-tree). We now
suspect that low stand densities (crown closure under 35
percent) were the general condition in the historical land-
scape, and we hypothesize that the mixed severity fire
regime included passive crown fire (ignition from a surface
fire and not from adjacent crowns) as a major component,
because trees were generally too far apart to spread fire in
the crowns.
More open forests would likely have had a grassy under-
story, perhaps with a strong but patchy shrub component
including primarily mountain mahogany and currant. Lo-
cal fire behavior specialists suggest that the transition
between grassy understory vegetation and a litter surface
fuel condition occurs between 30 and 40 percent crown
closure (Henry Goehle and Doug Steven, personal commu-
nication). While coarse-textured granitic soils and low
precipitation result in low overstory and understory pro-
ductivity in the study area, particularly when the climate is
in dry cycles, more open stand conditions would favor better
(though patchy) understory production. Furthermore, fires
are most common during the decade-long pulses of tree
recruitment, when climatic conditions probably favor both
tree recruitment and understory production favorable for
surface fire (Kaufmann and others 2000b). If shrubs, low
limbs, or coarse woody debris accumulate beneath indi-
vidual tree crowns, large numbers of trees may be killed by
passive crown fire. In addition, we suspect that small patches
of young trees may have occurred in some areas, and these
patches may have been burned by localized active crown
fires. Thus passive crown fire and very localized active
crown fires in young trees were probably major causes of
openings and low density forest in the South Platte ponde-
rosa pine/Douglas-fir system.
Implications for Landscape
Restoration ____________________
Research at Cheesman Lake on characteristics of his-
torical ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir landscapes provides a
sound basis for landscape restoration in surrounding areas
(Culver and others, this proceedings). Clearly the current
forest density and amount of Douglas-fir in these areas are
too high. The 11,900 acre Buffalo Creek fire in 1996 near the
Cheesman Lake landscape illustrated the huge risks of
wildfire and postfire erosion in these dense forests.
An ecologically sustainable landscape would have a forest
structure similar to that found historically, presuming that
climatic conditions have not changed substantially. The
lower portion of figure 7 suggests how changes in the four
primary components of the South Platte basin might be
returned to the landscape structure conditions found his-
torically. The amount of persistent old growth, reduced
sharply by logging of old trees, requires considerable time for
restoration. However, many trees over 200 years exist in
logged areas examined in the Turkey Creek landscape adja-
cent to Cheesman Lake and in logged forests northeast of
Deckers in potential restoration areas, placing the age
structure well on the trajectory for reestablishing the persis-
tent old-growth condition (Kaufmann 2000b). Restoration
activities should protect all old trees.
Openings existed historically but were lost since settle-
ment. They can be recreated by removing trees, perhaps
through a combination of mechanical treatment and pre-
scribed burning. The ponderosa pine component can be
restored by selective removal of Douglas-fir, and thinning
would reduce densities to levels found historically. Similar
treatments would reduce the spatial extent of the ponderosa
pine/Douglas-fir component.
A landscape assessment for the South Platte watershed
identified several large subwatersheds at high risk of wild-
fire and postfire erosion (Culver and others, this proceedings).
These areas are close to the Cheesman Lake landscape, and
they have similar topography, soils, and climate. Restoring
historical conditions is likely to address the two major
issues of the Upper South Platte Watershed Protection and
Restoration Project (Culver and others, this proceedings):
(1) restoration of the landscape to an ecologically sustain-
able condition, and (2) mitigation of the risk of large-scale
crown fires and postfire erosion. The changes in landscape
components in the lower portion of figure 7 address both of
these issues.
It is unrealistic to expect the entire South Platte water-
shed to be restored to historical conditions in a short amount
of time. Furthermore, in some places the historical condition
may not be the desirable outcome. However, with priorities
established by the landscape assessment for the South
Platte watershed, restoration of portions of the overall
watershed can be staged to create fuel breaks that reduce the
risk of large-scale crown fires such as that in Buffalo Creek
in 1996.

Abstract—Lack of Euro-American disturbance, except fire sup-
pression, has preserved the patterns of forest structure that re-
sulted from the presettlement disturbance regime in a ponderosa
pine/Douglas-fir landscape at Cheesman Lake in the Colorado
Front Range. A mixed-severity fire regime and variable timing of
tree recruitment created a heterogeneous forest age structure with
considerable old growth. Surrounding forests subjected to human
alteration since the late 1800s are younger, denser, and more
continuous. We present preliminary data from a study of fire history
and age structure. We mapped forest patches based on tree size and
density using color-infrared aerial photos, then randomly sampled
10 percent of these patches across the 35 km2 landscape for the ages
of the five apparent oldest trees. Trees older than 200 years were
found in 70 percent of sampled stands. Trees older than 400 years
were found in 30 percent of sampled stands, suggesting that old
growth was common and widespread in historical landscapes in the
Front Range. We compared the stand ages with locations of known
fire dates derived from fire scars. Concentrations of trees that
postdate known fires indicate a past stand-replacing fire. Such
postfire cohorts are discernible as far back as 1531 A.D. Of 21
fires recorded by scars between 1531 and 1880, 16 appear to have
had a stand-replacing component, and seven known fires predate
71 percent of the postfire cohorts. Time between stand-replacing
disturbance and tree establishment varied considerably between
sites, but generally ranged from 20 to 50 years. Some openings
began to regenerate within 10 years after fire, while others remain
unforested 150 years later.

(Regan 1997; Baker 1992; Kaufmann and others 1992;
Moir 1992; Veblen and Lorenz 1991). Old-growth ponderosa
pine forests with large, open-grown trees generally older
than 200 years were more heavily impacted by logging and
grazing during and immediately after the settlement period
than younger stands (Covington and Moore 1994; Cooper
1960). Managers attempting forest restoration in ponderosa
pine landscapes of the West face several questions: what
constitutes old-growth forest in their ecosystems? How
much old growth existed historically, and how was it distrib-
uted? What were the disturbance regimes that regulated
landscape structure? How much old growth remains on the
present landscape, and how can we recreate a more histori-
cal and sustainable forest structure? In many locations,
these questions are largely unanswerable. No old growth
remains that developed under historical disturbance re-
gimes. Where old growth does exist, it is often small, isolated
stands that were preserved by their inaccessibility or lack of
productivity, and does not necessarily reflect the historical
distribution of old-growth forest on the landscape.
Reconstructing historical disturbance regimes is essen-
tial for understanding the processes that regulated forest
structure and the distribution of old growth across the
landscape (Veblen and others 2000; Mast and others 1999;
Fulé and others 1997; Brown and Sieg 1996; Swetnam and
Baisan 1996; Brown 1995; Veblen and Lorenz 1986). The
spatial and temporal scale of historical disturbances deter-
mined the distribution, extent, character, and persistence of
old-growth stands. Using the age structure of present for-
ests, particularly in relatively undisturbed stands, is one
way to reconstruct historical forests (Mast and others 1999;
Arno and others 1995; Duncan and Stewart 1991). However,
because remaining old stands are often small and isolated,
it is difficult to extrapolate to a larger scale.
We have been fortunate to study a relatively undisturbed
ponderosa pine landscape of 35 km2 in the Colorado Front
Range. The land surrounding Cheesman Lake, on the South
Platte River, experienced only minimal, localized logging
and grazing before 1900, unlike most montane forests in the
Front Range. While fire suppression since 1900 has allowed
for some ingrowth of trees and increased prevalence of
young Douglas-fir, the lack of other anthropogenic distur-
bance has preserved the distribution of presettlement trees
that resulted from the historical disturbance regime. The
cool, dry climate has preserved remnant wood, allowing us

to reconstruct the fire history back to 1197 A.D. (Brown and
others 1999). The historical mixed-severity fire regime and
variable timing of tree establishment in the ponderosa pine/
Douglas-fir forest created an older and more heterogeneous
age structure than that found in surrounding areas that
have experienced more human alteration since the mid-19th
century (Kaufmann and others 2000a). The size of the
protected area has allowed us to study a historical landscape
on a scale similar to that at which we believe historical
disturbance regimes actually operated, and gives us some
sense of the scale of patterning in the landscape. We present
preliminary data from a landscape-scale study comparing
forest age structure and fire history.
Background and Methods ________
The Cheesman Lake Landscape
The Cheesman Lake landscape is 3,040 ha of land area,
excluding the lake, located in the montane forest zone, about
60 km southwest of Denver. Elevations range from 2,100 m
at the water level of the reservoir to 2,400 m on the west side
of the lake. The vegetation at Cheesman Lake is dry ponde-
rosa pine/Douglas-fir forest (Pinus ponderosa/Pseudotsuga
menziesii) (Peet 1991). Understories are typically grassy or
shrubby or both; denser forests have very sparse understo-
ries. Most of the botanical diversity in this landscape is
concentrated in the relatively small riparian areas around
streams, many of which are intermittent. These forests were
historically open, with the Douglas-fir concentrated on north-
erly slopes (Kaufmann and others 2000b). Aspen (Populus
tremuloides), blue spruce (Picea pungens), Rocky Mountain
juniper (Juniperus scopulorum), and narrow-leaf cotton-
wood (Populus angustifolia) are typically found in riparian
areas, but are more common outside the study area. Soils
are gravelly coarse sandy loams derived from weathered
Pikes Peak granite (USDA Forest Service 1992). They are
very well drained and erosive. Average annual precipitation
is around 40 cm (USDA Forest Service 1992), and there is no
persistent winter snowpack. Summer precipitation comes
mainly in the form of erratic thunderstorms that produce
much lightning.
The native inhabitants since at least 1700 were nomadic
Utes (Cassells 1983), whose activity was probably confined
to the river corridor and other reliable sources of water
before 1880 (A. Kane, Pike NF Archaeologist, personal
communication; De Lay 1989). Bison may have grazed in the
area before 1880 (De Lay 1989). Euro-American settlement
began in the Front Range after 1859, but did not become
heavy until the 1870s–1890s. Logging and ranching began
downstream from the Cheesman property during that pe-
riod, and reached forests adjacent to Cheesman in the late
1890s. The Cheesman Lake property is presently owned and
managed by Denver Water. The dam on the South Platte
River that created the reservoir was completed in 1905
(Denver Water archives). At the same time, a six-strand
barbed wire fence was erected around the entire property to
exclude grazing. The forest on the property was not cut
except for logging below the present water line. Grazing has
been excluded since 1905, and was probably light before that
time. There was little mining in the area, though placer
claims did exist along the river where the reservoir now lies
(Denver Water archives). Fire has been suppressed on the
Cheesman Lake property since the time of dam construc-
tion. The only fire that burned significant acreage within the
landscape since 1880 occurred in 1963, burning about 25 ha
on the south end of the property before it was extinguished
(Bill Newberry, Denver Water, personal communication).
Sampling Scheme
We mapped the Cheesman Lake landscape from 1:6000
color-infrared aerial photographs, drawing polygons around
visually ecologically distinct areas. We classified polygons
based on tree density and size distribution as either forested
or nonforested (rocks, water, grass, riparian shrubs, less
than 10 percent tree canopy cover), and estimated forest
canopy cover by 10 percent classes. We were unable to
differentiate between ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir on the
color-infrared photographs. We scanned the polygon maps
into digital form and georectified them by overlaying them
onto the digital orthoquarterquad using ArcInfo.
We randomly selected 10 percent of the mapped forested
polygons from our GIS database for sampling. Sampled
polygons varied in size, from less than 0.1 ha to 33 ha; the
average size of sampled forested polygons was 3.3 ± 2.0 ha.
The total area of the sampled polygons, 680 ha, represents
22 percent of the total land area. Within each polygon, we
selected the five living trees that appeared to be the oldest,
or to represent the oldest cohort, and cored them at approxi-
mately 35 cm above the ground. Where trees were rotten, or
there appeared to be more than one older cohort, we took
more than five cores and included those ages in our analysis.
In some stands, all of the trees appeared to be old; in other
stands, a few old trees were present among younger trees.
Where there were no old trees at all, we selected the domi-
nants. The correlation between size and age on our sites is
very poor. Some of the largest trees on favorable sites are
only around 150 years old, while some of the oldest trees on
dry slopes range from 25 to 35 cm d.b.h.
Ponderosa pine trees begin to take on distinctive charac-
teristics at around 200 years of age (Kaufmann 1996). We
used these characteristics to identify the old trees in stands
(fig. 1). Old ponderosa pines have smoother, lighter colored
bark, smaller live crown ratio, and more flattened crowns
than young trees. Dead tops are common, as are fire scars,
lightning scars, and other injuries. Old Douglas-fir trees
also have distinctive characteristics, including thick, deeply
fissured bark and relatively small live crown ratios; crowns
tend to be sparser, rounder, and less conical than those of
young trees. As with pines, dead tops and injuries become
more common over time.
Tree-Ring Dating
We used standard dendrochronological cross-dating tech-
niques to age our sampled trees (Swetnam and others 1985;
Stokes and Smiley 1968). Cores were surfaced with progres-
sively finer grits of sandpaper to 400 grit and cross-dated
under a stereomicroscope, using the chronology developed

for dating the Cheesman Lake fire history (Brown and
others 1999). It extends from 1107 A.D. to 2000 A.D.
We cored trees as close as possible to the pith. We deter-
mined the approximate germination date of sampled trees
by estimating rings to the pith using the concentric circle
method (Applequist 1958), and we estimated the number of
years required for a tree to grow to coring height of 35 cm
based on aging destructively sampled small trees on good
and poor sites (Kaufmann and others 2000a; Mast and
others 1998). Growth times to 35 cm ranged from 5 years for
ponderosa pines on good sites to 18 years for Douglas-fir on
poor sites.
Our fire history was constructed from fire-scarred living
trees and remnant material sampled at sites subjectively
located across the Cheesman lake landscape, and is reported
in Brown and others (1999). Fire scars were sampled by
cutting a cross-section or partial cross-section through the
fire-scarred face of a tree, snag, or log with a chainsaw.
Sections were surfaced and cross-dated using the chronology
developed for Cheesman Lake.
Old Growth and Fire History ______
Historical Fire Regime
We believe that individual historical fire events at
Cheesman Lake burned with variable intensity. Under less
extreme conditions, surface fires consumed grassy fuels and
scarred but did not kill mature trees. Buried fire scars on
some samples are evidence of fires light enough to scar but
not kill trees 2–5 cm in diameter. Where fuels were heavy or
in high winds, fires could be intense enough to kill all of the
trees in an area. Stands on south- and west-facing slopes
may have been so sparsely forested that fires killed trees
only under extreme conditions. Modeling with FARSITE
indicates that considerable wind is required to advance a fire
in this environment even after decades of fire suppression,
and is particularly necessary for crown fire (unpublished
data; see Kaufmann and others, this proceedings). Fuel
buildups from a series of wet years followed by dry weather
probably also contributed to large, intense fires (Veblen and
others 2000).
Seasonality of scars from the more widespread fires en-
compasses the entire growing season (mid-June to early
September) and the dormant season, which could be either
fall or spring, both usually dry periods (Brown and others
1999). Historically, fires that started early in the season may
have burned across the landscape throughout the summer
until snowfall put them out. Lightning is very common from
April through September and per year ignites 10 to 12 fires,
which are presently suppressed (Bill Newberry, Denver
Water, personal communication). The Native American in-
fluence on historical ignitions is unknown.
The mean fire interval (MFI) at Cheesman Lake depends
on the scale at which it is observed. The length of fire-free
interval is inversely proportional to the size of area over
which the intervals are assessed; larger areas have shorter
intervals. Any given location on the Cheesman landscape
might historically have gone as much as 128 years between
fires. For the full period of analysis (1285 to 1963 A.D.) over
the entire landscape, the MFI was 9.2 years ±7 years (Brown
and others 1999). However, this includes fires of all intensi-
ties and many localized fires. When the fire scar sample area
was divided into smaller areas of 0.5 to 2 km2, the MFI for
all individual areas between 1496 A.D. to 1880 A.D. was
50.0 years, ±17.2 years (Kaufmann and others, this proceed-
ings). When we consider only the larger scale fires that
burned more than 5 km2, based on the distribution of fire
scars, the MFI between 1496 and 1880 was 42.7 years, ±12.7
years, with a range of 27 to 65 years between fires (Kaufmann
and others, this proceedings). Large-scale fires tended to
alternate across the landscape; for example, the northern
area that burned in 1696 did not burn in 1723. However,
many areas that had burned in 1723 also burned in 1851, but
not in 1820. Only the fire in 1631 scarred trees at every
sampling location.
Figure 2 shows generalized minimum extents of the wide-
spread fires based on locations where fire scars from that
year were collected (Brown and others 1999). Many other
fire years were recorded as far back as 1197 A.D., but
sample depth declines dramatically before 1500 A.D. Note
that fire scar sampling did not extend beyond the area
mapped for the 1631 fire and was generally confined to
Figure 1—This ponderosa pine germinated around
1447 A.D. It exhibits classic old-growth characteristics.

the Cheesman property, except for an area southeast of
the Cheesman boundary, so actual fire areas were probably
larger than those shown. The Cheesman Lake landscape
seems to encompass the total area of some historical fires
and not of others. The South Platte River does not seem to
have been a significant firebreak, as fires predating the
reservoir were recorded on both sides of the river. Historical
photos and predam survey maps (courtesy of Denver Water
archives) show that the valley where Cheesman Lake cur-
rently lies was fairly flat and grassy, so fire probably spread
rapidly across it. Suppression of spreading fires outside of
the property may have had as much effect on the decline in
fire frequency in the 20th century as suppression within the
property.
Age Distribution and Old Growth
Old growth is a complex ecological concept, based not only
on the ages of the oldest trees, but also on stand structural
and functional characteristics (Kaufmann and others 1992;
Moir 1992). Old-growth stands contribute to biodiversity by
providing habitat for wildlife and late successional plant
species. Ponderosa pine stands begin to take on old-growth
characteristics around 200 years of age. Old stands tend to
have more snags and coarse woody debris, large trees for the
site conditions, old trees, and a variety of trees of younger
ages. Such stands evolved under presettlement disturbance
regimes. Even in relatively undisturbed places such as
Cheesman Lake, fire suppression has changed the struc-
ture of old stands by allowing ingrowth of young trees,
especially Douglas-fir. Where logging has occurred, the
distribution and prevalence of old-growth stands in
presettlement times is difficult to determine (Mast and
others 1999; Regan 1997).
Our data indicate that old stands were common and widely
distributed in unlogged montane forests around Cheesman
Lake. Figure 3 shows the locations of our sampled polygons
classified into age categories based on the age of the oldest
tree collected. At Cheesman Lake, where the historical age
structure persists, 70 percent of the sampled polygons had
trees 200 years old or older; 30 percent of sampled polygons
had trees more than 400 years of age. In 30 percent of
polygons, all trees sampled were less than 200 years old,
indicating more recent stand-replacing disturbance in a
Figure 2—Generalized extents of large fires with stand-replacing components, based on the locations of trees sampled
for the fire history. Compare these with polygons postdating these fires in figure 5. Because fire scar sampling was
confined to the Cheesman property, the actual areas of the fires may be larger than shown. (Maps are developed from
Brown and others 1999.)

third of the sampled landscape. These younger stands were
concentrated in the southeast part of the property where
the 1851 fire burned. The oldest stands were concentrated
in the northwest quadrant of the property, though stands
with old trees were fairly evenly distributed over the
landscape.
Though old trees were widespread among our samples,
very old trees were relatively uncommon, reflecting the fact
that many stands have a few old trees surrounded by trees
of younger cohorts. Only 10 percent of the sampled trees
were more than 400 years old; 40 percent of trees were 200–
400 years old. Trees less than 200 years old constituted 50
percent of the trees sampled as the oldest in the stands.
Douglas-fir has always been a component of the landscape,
though it is probably more abundant and widespread now
than in the past. Of 1,279 cores sampled and dated from the
Cheesman Lake landscape, 86 percent (1,108) were ponde-
rosa pine and 13 percent (171) were Douglas-fir. The esti-
mated germination year of the oldest living ponderosa pine
collected was 1395 A.D. The estimated germination year of
the oldest Douglas-fir collected was 1459 A.D. The oldest
trees in most polygons were ponderosa pines, but 25 poly-
gons out of 224 had a Douglas-fir as the oldest tree.
The oldest trees in most stands appear to have an upper
age limit postdating a documented fire in the area. These
stands with an age cap are the most common stand structure
in the landscape (Kaufmann and others, this proceedings).
However, some stands seemed to have no identifiable
initiating event. The ages of sampled trees in these stands
were continuous over a long time, with no concentrations of
ages (for example, truly uneven-aged). Some were more than
600 years old. We call these stands persistent old growth
(Kaufmann and others, this proceedings; fig. 4). Such
stands apparently have not experienced a stand-replacing
event in the lifetimes of the trees. Their structure seems to
be regulated by microsite events such as heartrot, windthrow,
individual tree insect infestation, or mistletoe. Fire scars are
usually present in these stands, indicating periodic surface
fire, but age distributions do not suggest a stand-initiating
event that coincides with any recorded fire in the area. Such
stands constituted 16 percent of sampled polygons. Persis-
tent old growth occurs in all parts of the landscape, but is
concentrated in the northwestern quadrant. Some stands
classified as persistent old growth may in fact postdate early
fires for which no scar record exists. Further analysis is
required to determine what factors allow the persistence of
such stands.
Figure 3—Distribution of old growth among sampled
stands, based on the age of the oldest tree cored in the
polygon. Thirty percent of sampled stands had all trees
younger than 200 years; 40 percent had the oldest trees
between 200 and 400 years old, and 30 percent had the
oldest trees older than 400 years.
Figure 4—Persistent old growth. These stands have very
old trees with no evidence of a stand-initiating event. They
are characterized by a continuum of tree ages, including
trees more than 400 years of age, old trees dying from
microscale disturbances such as mistletoe infestation,
windthrow, or lightning strike, and coarse woody debris on
the ground. Fire scars are sometimes present, indicating
that surface fires have burned in the stands without killing
all of the trees.

Age Structure and Fire Regime
Determining the ages of the oldest trees in a stand and
comparing them to known fire dates in the area gives us
some idea of where stand-replacing fire burned in individual
fire years. Age structure has been used to approximate the
dates of stand-replacing fires elsewhere (Mast and others
1999; Arno and others 1995; Goldblum and Veblen 1992;
Duncan and Stewart 1991). Concentrations of trees that
postdate known fires suggest the forest in that location
burned in a stand-replacing fire. In an attempt to de-
termine the locations of stand-replacing components of
known fires, we compared the estimated germination dates
of the oldest trees sampled in the polygons with the dates of
fire scar records in the vicinity. Of 21 fires recorded over the
entire landscape from 1531 to 1880, 16 appeared to have a
crown fire component detectable in the age structure of
sampled trees. Seventy-one percent of sampled polygons
clearly postdated one of seven major fire events over the last
470 years (1531, 1534, 1587, 1631, 1723, 1851, 1880), sug-
gesting that those events had a significant stand-replacing
component (fig. 5).
This approach has limitations that become more restric-
tive to interpretation the further back in time we go. We can
only assess the residual polygons, in other words, those that
have survived subsequent fires. For example, a polygon in
which the forest appears to postdate the 1851 fire might also
have burned as a stand-replacing fire in 1631, but evidence
of the stand that initiated after 1631 has been destroyed by
more recent stand-replacing fire. Therefore, figure 5 is a
conservative estimate of the number of polygons that post-
date known historical fires. Only polygons burned in 1851
and 1880 have not been burned over by subsequent fires.
Similarly, evidence of surface fire in the form of scarred trees
may have been obliterated by subsequent disturbances, so
the mapped extents of the fires based on scars is also
conservative. It is also certain that the mosaic of forest
stands of different age and size structure (which we mapped
as polygons) has shifted over time as the result of distur-
bances. The polygon map of 1630 probably would have
looked very different from the one of today.
Locations of sampled polygons that appear to postdate
known stand-initiating fires are shown in figure 6. The
earliest scar-recorded fire that clearly predated some sampled
stands was in 1531 A.D. (figs. 2 and 6). This fire burned in
both the far northern and southern parts of the Cheesman
Lake landscape. Evidence of this fire in the central portion
of the landscape may have been obliterated by subsequent
fires. Nine sampled polygons located within the fire bound-
ary (as defined by the locations of fire-scarred samples)
postdated this fire, yet initiated before the next known fire
in the area. A fire in 1534 A.D. burned the central and south-
central two-thirds of the Cheesman Lake landscape. The
oldest trees in 22 polygons postdated this fire (fig. 5). A fire
in 1587 burned the southeastern part of the Cheesman Lake
landscape. Ten polygons clearly postdated this fire.
The fire in 1631 was recorded by scars at all of the
sampling locations throughout the landscape, and 36 poly-
gons appear to postdate this fire, mostly in the central and
northern part of the landscape (figs. 5 and 6). Scars from a
fire in 1696 were widespread over the northern and central
Figure 5—The number of sampled polygons where the
oldest tree postdated a known fire in the area, by fire
year. Seventy-one percent of sampled polygons clearly
postdated one of seven major fires over the last 470
years (1531, 1534, 1587, 1631, 1723, 1851, 1880),
indicating that those events had a significant stand-
replacing component. A total of 21 fires were recorded
by fire scars during that period, of which 16 seem to have
had some crown fire component. Fifteen percent of the
polygons sampled were classified as persistent old
growth, with no clear stand-initiating event evident in the
ages of the oldest trees.
Figure 6—We mapped the distribution of apparent
stand-replacing fire events in the sampled polygons.
This map shows the recorded fire that probably pre-
dated the oldest trees in each sampled polygon. Stands
that did not appear to have a clear initiating event are
labeled persistent old growth.

part of the landscape, but relatively few stands (except for
some on the northwest side of the river) postdate this fire.
The fire in 1631 may have left large areas unsusceptible to
stand-replacing fire 1696. A fire in 1723 burned the south-
ern half of the landscape, on both sides of the river. Much
of the evidence of stand initiation after this fire may have
been obliterated by the fire in 1851, which burned much of
the same area. A fire in 1775 scarred widely distributed trees
on the east side of the river, but apparently had only a small
stand-replacing component. Similarly, a fire on the north
half of the landscape in 1820 scarred widespread trees but
initiated few stands. These may have been less intense
surface fires in the very open landscape left in the wake of
fires in 1631 and 1723. This was also a fairly cool and wet
period (P. Brown, personal communication).
Fire-created openings persisted for variable lengths of
time, depending on when conditions favored tree establish-
ment in subsequent years (Kaufmann and others 2000a),
and whether the location experienced another disturbance
before the trees were large enough to survive it. Tobler
(2000) sampled vegetation in openings at Cheesman Lake
and found coarse woody debris in all but one of them,
indicating that they had been forested in the past. Death
dates on the down logs indicate that the openings were
created by a fire in 1851, and remained unforested 149 years
later. Fire scars found nearby suggest that the northern
part of the area may have burned again in 1880, slowing
tree regeneration.
When we compared the ages of the oldest trees sampled
in the polygons with the dates of nearby fire scars, we saw
highly variable intervals between fire and tree establish-
ment. Time to regeneration in sampled polygons ranged
between 0 and 95 years, but generally occurred within 15 to
30 years, with an overall average of 18 years (table 1). Tree
ages collected in other plots in the southeast part of the
property were also compared to fire scar dates in the vicinity.
Some of them appear to have regenerated immediately,
while others seem to have remained unforested for as many
as 107 years (Kaufmann and others 2000b). We believe this
phenomenon is due to climate and episodic periods of regen-
eration (Kaufmann and others 2000a). If a fire occurred at
the beginning of a period favorable for tree establishment,
even south-facing slopes could regenerate quickly, but if the
fire occurred at the end of such a period, regeneration would
be limited until the next favorable period.
The mean regeneration period after the seven major fires
with stand-replacing components was 22 years. Regenera-
tion was slower in the northwest quadrant of the landscape,
where the oldest stands were concentrated. Time to regen-
eration there averaged 30 years after a fire, with a range of
0 to 93 years, while the southeast quadrant averaged only
12 years to tree regeneration, with a range of 0 to 57 years.
Interpretation of these data is complicated by how long ago
some of the recruitment occurred. Establishment time for
both species was highly variable, but where Douglas-fir was
among the oldest trees, it established more quickly on
average, within 15 years, while ponderosa pine averaged 21
years to establish following fire. However, Douglas-fir was
more often found on north- and east-facing slopes where
establishment conditions were probably better.
The fire in 1851 burned the southern two-thirds of the
landscape. Openings created by this fire still persist on
south- and west-facing slopes (fig. 7). Vegetation in these
openings is mainly bunchgrass, or bunchgrass and shrubs,
primarily mountain mahogany (Cerocarpus montanus) and
wax currant (Ribes cereum). Trees began to invade these
openings between 1880 and 1920. The northern part of

these openings may have burned again in 1880, as scars
from this fire spatially overlap the ones from 1851. Areas
adjacent to the present openings also appear to have burned
in stand-replacing fires in 1851, but have now regenerated
to young forest on north- and east-facing slopes. Shrubs
common in the openings persist in the understories.
Fire, Old Growth, and Restoration Efforts
Our data suggest that old trees and old stands were
historically common in the montane zone of the Colorado
Front Range. The presettlement fire regime was spatially
and temporally a mixture of surface fire and stand-replacing
fire, which maintained open stands interspersed with areas
that remained treeless for decades at a time. Logging,
grazing, and fire suppression have altered this condition in
much of the Front Range, creating a forest that is younger,
denser, and more continuous than the presettlement norm
and converting fire behavior from a mixed severity fire
regime to a crown fire regime. Recent rapid growth of the
human population has created an extensive urban-wildland
interface in the Front Range that is at risk from wildfire, and
water sources are also in danger from postfire erosion
(Culver and others, this proceedings).
Restoring the landscape to an ecologically sustainable
condition by recreating a more historical forest structure
may mitigate the risk of intense, large-scale wildfires and
subsequent erosion (Kaufmann and others 2000b). Restora-
tion efforts should consider the role and distribution of old
growth on the landscape, and its relationship to disturbance
regime. It is important to conserve the old trees that still
exist on the landscape and to select trees for retention that
will grow into an old-growth condition in a reasonable
amount of time (Mast and others 1999; Fulé and others
1997; Kaufmann and others 1994). It is also important to
restore a disturbance regime that allows the old trees to
persist, for example, periodic surface fire that removes
ingrowth without killing the old trees. Mechanical thinning
may be required to allow for prescribed fires of appropriate
intensities, especially in areas with considerable young
ingrowth. However, restoring an ecologically sustainable
landscape with a historical structure requires creation and
maintenance of unforested openings, so treatments includ-
ing both thinning and prescribed fires must be locally in-
tense enough to replace some stands at longer intervals.
Front Range forests are not as productive, in terms of trees
or understory, as those in the Southwest, and their historical
fire regime was less frequent and more variable in intensity,
so the Southwestern model cannot be correctly applied here
(Veblen and others 2000; Brown and Sieg 1996; Swetnam
and Baisan 1996; Goldblum and Veblen 1992). Because fire
and tree regeneration historically occurred at long, often
coincident intervals, the timing of restoration efforts may be
important for successful maintenance of openings.

Abstract—Potential fire behavior was compared under dry, windy
weather conditions in 12 ponderosa pine stands treated with alter-
native thinning prescriptions in the wildland/urban interface of
Flagstaff, Arizona. Prior to thinning, stands averaged 474 trees/
acre, 158 ft2/acre basal area, crown bulk density 0.0045 lb/ft3, and
crown base height 19.2 ft. Three thinning treatments differing in
residual tree density were applied to each of three stands (total of
nine treated, three control). Treatments were based on historic
forest structure prior to Euro-American settlement and disruption
of the frequent fire regime (circa 1876). Thinning reduced stand
densities 77–88 percent, basal areas 35–66 percent, crown bulk
densities 24–48 percent, and raised crown base height an average of
11 ft. Before thinning, simulated fire behavior under the 97th
percentile of June fire weather conditions was predicted to be
intense but controllable (5.4 ft flame lengths). However, active or
passive crownfires were simulated using crown base heights in the
lowest quintile (20 percent) or winds gusting to 30 mph, represent-
ing the fuel ladders and wind gusts that are important for initiating
crown burning. Under the identical conditions after thinning, all
three treatments resisted crown burning. The degree of resistance
was related to thinning intensity. It is crucial to remove thinning
slash fuels through prescribed burning or other means. If not
removed, slash fuels can cause crownfire behavior in the thinned
stands under severe wildfire conditions. Finally, the crownfire
resistance achieved through thinning will deteriorate over time
unless maintenance burning and/or thinning is continued.
Introduction ____________________
Flagstaff, Arizona, is located at the northwestern end of
the largest contiguous ponderosa pine forest in the world.
Increased fire intensity and severity are major concerns
around Flagstaff and generally in southwestern ponderosa
pine forests (Swetnam and Betancourt 1998), due to the
regional increase in surface and canopy fuels following a

century or more of fire exclusion and other human-caused
disruptions of ecological processes (Cooper 1960; Covington
and others 1994). In 1996, the two largest wildfires in the
history of the Coconino National Forest burned a few miles
north of Flagstaff. Seeking to prevent such fires from
burning into developed areas, a collaborative group called
the Grand Canyon Forests Partnership was formed to
restore ecosystem health, reduce catastrophic fires, and
improve economic benefits and management on public
lands (GCFP 1998).
Tree thinning, prescribed burning, and/or other fuel re-
duction methods can reduce the hazard of intense fires (for
example, Van Wagtendonk 1996; Graham and others 1999;
Agee and others 2000). Using these techniques to restore a
regime of frequent, low-intensity fires and tree structures
approximating the relatively open presettlement forest
stands should, in theory, simultaneously address the
Partnership’s goals. These treatments have potential for
improving ecosystem health (Kolb and others 1994), reduc-
ing fire hazard (Covington and others 1997), and offering
some economic benefits through forest product removal
(Larson and Mirth 1998). Actually achieving this array of
outcomes in complex ecosystems and social systems is diffi-
cult, requiring choices among competing interests. For ex-
ample, Scott (1998a) compared the economic, aesthetic,
ecological, and fire behavior tradeoffs of a set of alternative
fuel treatments in a western Montana ponderosa pine forest.
Kalabokidis and Omi (1998) carried out a similar analysis in
a Colorado lodgepole pine forest.
The Grand Canyon Forests Partnership’s initial wildland/
urban interface experimental treatments were started in
1998 in cooperation with the Coconino National Forest and
Rocky Mountain Research Station. The experiments had
multiple objectives, but our focus in this paper is only on the
treatment effects on potential fire behavior. The greatest
concern in the wildland/urban interface is crownfire, both
“passive” crownfire (tree torching) and “active” crownfire
(fire spreading through the canopy). Crownfires spread
rapidly (Rothermel 1991), resist control by hand crews and
often mechanical or aerial equipment (Pyne and others
1996), and threaten structures with intense heat and fire-
brand showers (Cohen 2000).
Several complementary actions can improve the ability of
communities to resist fire hazards to lives and property,
including enhanced firefighting resources, improved access
routes and rural address systems, heightened public aware-
ness, reduction of structure flammability (Cohen 2000), and
reduction of forest susceptibility to crownfire. The forest
treatments discussed here address this latter factor. Local

initiatives are under way to enhance other fire-resistance
factors in the Flagstaff wildland/urban interface.
Until recently, fire behavior modeling tools such as BE-
HAVE (Andrews 1986) simulated only surface fire behavior.
New tools such as FARSITE (Finney 1998) and Nexus (Scott
1999) have greatly increased the ease with which many
aspects of crownfire behavior can be modeled and compared.
It is important not to attach too much specificity to crownfire
behavior predictions: the fundamental reason that crownfire
modeling has advanced slowly is that crownfires are rare
and occur in extraordinarily complex weather and fuel
environments (Rothermel 1991). With caveats, however,
simulations provide useful insights into the relative differ-
ences between treatments and the relative sensitivity of
crownfire behavior to different variables.
From previous simulations with FARSITE and Nexus, as
well as from literature results (Van Wagtendonk 1996;
Scott 1998a,b), we recognized that simulations often re-
sulted in outputs that appeared contrary to actual wildfire
experience. In particular, simulated fires using our fuel
and weather conditions proved nearly impossible to crown
using realistic data, even though real fires had crowned
under similar or even less severe conditions. One possible
solution was to manipulate model output with adjustment
factors. However, this method is unsatisfactory for model-
ers and their audiences, who would prefer to use well-
supported numbers.
We tried a different approach. Both with weather and fuel
data, we reasoned that “average” conditions were a misrep-
resentation of the real forest situation. For instance, to cross
the threshold into tree torching, surface flame lengths must
preheat the branches and leaves close to the bottom of the
crown. Achieving this transition in simulations has been
difficult because the average crown base height is often a
relatively high value (15–30 ft). The fuel ladders, surface
fuel jackpots, and wind gusts that facilitate the transition to
the crown in real fires are not accounted for when uniform
averages are used.
Taking the variability of the data into account could help
simulate more realistic fire behavior, but which fraction of
the variability is important? A single low crown is probably
insufficient to initiate a crownfire, but crownfires can start
and be sustained in strong winds even with much less than
50 percent of the stand in a crownfire-susceptible condition.
We chose to rank the data by quintiles—20 percent groups—
and compare fire behavior and treatment effects on both the
stand averages and the susceptible quintiles, suggesting
that the fire behavior in the vulnerable quintiles may be
important in triggering intense fires.
Methods _______________________
Treatments
The Grand Canyon Forests Partnership chose to compare
three treatments differing in residual tree density. All treat-
ments were based on the presettlement pattern of tree
structure as inferred from: (1) living trees of presettlement
origin, characterized by larger size and yellowed bark (White
1985; Covington and Moore 1994), and (2) remnant material
from snags, logs, and stumps of presettlement origin, which
were well-conserved in the dry environment in the absence
of fire (Dieterich 1980; Fulé and others 1997; Covington and
others 1997; Mast and others 1999). All living presettlement
trees were retained. In addition, wherever evidence of rem-
nant presettlement material was encountered, several of the
largest postsettlement trees within 30 ft were retained as
replacements. If suitable trees were not found within 30 ft,
the search radius was extended to 60 ft. The three thinning
treatments each had a different replacement tree density:
• 1.5-3 replacements: replace each remnant with 1.5 trees
(in other words, 3 replacements per every 2 remnants)
if the replacements were 16 inches d.b.h. or larger,
otherwise replace each remnant with 3 trees. Because
relatively few greater than 16 inches postsettlement
trees were encountered in any of the sites, all the
thinning treatments tended to retain the higher num-
ber of replacement. The 1.5-3 treatment, called “full
restoration,” reduced tree density most closely to pre-
settlement levels.
• 2-4 replacements: replace remnants with 2 trees greater
than 16 inches d.b.h., otherwise 4 trees.
• 3-6 replacements: replace remnants with 3 trees greater
than 16 inches d.b.h., otherwise 6 trees.
• Control treatment: no thinning, no burning.
Study Sites
The treatments were tested on three experimental blocks
in or adjacent to the Fort Valley Experimental Forest,
approximately 15 km NW of Flagstaff, Arizona (fig. 1). Each
block contained a 35-acre replicate of each of the three
thinning levels and a control. The study area is at 7,400 ft
elevation with gentle topography and a cool, subhumid
climate (Avery and others 1976). Mean annual precipitation
is 57 cm, with approximately half occurring as snow. The
remainder occurs as summer monsoonal rains following the
spring/early summer drought. Soils are of volcanic origin, a
fine montmorillonitic complex of frigid Typic Argiboroll and
Mollic Eutroboralf (Mast and others 1999). Experimental

blocks were laid out in cooperation with Forest Service staff,
subject to constraints of other experimental studies and
wildlife habitat. As a result, the treatment units in experi-
mental blocks 1 and 2 could not be contiguous. All treat-
ments were randomly assigned.
The timing and method of treatment differed in the experi-
mental blocks due to economic constraints, primarily the
very low value of the material removed, and to the
Partnership’s intention to make the site available to differ-
ent operators. Thinning of the blocks began in November
1998 and was completed in September 1999. Blocks 1 and 2
were thinned with a mechanical feller and limbed at the tree,
resulting in broadcast slash fuels. Block 3 was thinned in a
whole-tree harvesting operation, resulting in slash piles.
Piles in block 3 were burned in February 2000. All blocks
were scheduled for broadcast burning in the spring or fall
2000.
Measurements
Twenty experimental block (EB) plots were established on
a 60-m grid in each of the 12 units. Plot centers were
permanently marked with iron stakes at ground level and
slope and aspect were recorded. Overstory trees over breast
height (bh, 4.5 ft) were measured on a 0.1 acre (37 ft radius)
circular fixed-area plot. Species, condition (1-living, 2-de-
clining, 3-recent snag, 4-loose bark snag, 5-clean snag, 6-
snag broken above bh, 7-snag broken below bh, 8-downed, 9-
cut stump), and d.b.h., were recorded for all live and dead
trees over breast height, as well as for stumps and downed
trees that surpassed breast height while alive. Tree heights
and average crown base height per plot were measured.
Trees below breast height and shrubs were tallied by condi-
tion class and by three height classes (0–15.7, 15.8–31.5, and
31.6–54 inches) on a nested 0.025 acre (18.5 ft radius)
subplot. Shrubs over breast height were also measured.
Herbaceous plants and canopy cover (vertical projection)
were measured along a 164-ft line transect oriented up- and
down-slope. Point intercept measurements were recorded
every 11.8 inches along each transect. Dead woody biomass
and forest floor material were measured on a 50 ft planar
transect in a random direction from each plot center. Fuels
were measured by diameter/moisture timelag classes (1H
timelag = 0–0.25 inch diameter, 10H = 0.25–1 inch, 100 H =
1–3 inches, 1000H = over 3 inches, sound (S) and rotten (R)
categories). Woody debris biomass was calculated using
procedures in Brown (1974) and Sackett (1980). Forest floor
depth measurements were converted to loading (Mg/ha)
using equations from Ffolliott and others (1976). Plots were
originally measured from August through November 1998.
After thinning, preburn fuels were measured on the same
transects in October 1999.
Modeling
Fire behavior was modeled with the Nexus Fire Behavior
and Hazard Assessment System (Scott and Reinhardt 1999).
As described by Scott (1998a, 1999), Nexus integrates mod-
els of surface fire behavior (Rothermel 1972) with crown fire
transition (Van Wagner 1977) and crown fire spread
(Rothermel 1991). Nexus is similar to the landscape fire
behavior modeling program FARSITE (Finney 1998) in that
both link the same set of surface and crownfire models.
However, Nexus is better suited for comparing fire hazards
under alternative conditions because environmental and
fuel factors are kept constant for each simulation, rather
than changing continuously with time and location, as in
FARSITE.
Custom fire behavior fuel models were developed and
tested with the NEWMDL and TSTMDL modules of BE-
HAVE (Andrews 1986). Pretreatment fuel models were
modified from the standard fire behavior fuel model 9,
“hardwood litter” (Anderson 1982). Postthinning fuel mod-
els were modified from standard model 11, “light slash.”
Future fuels, after thinning and burning, are likely to have
reduced woody fuel loads and increased herbaceous fuels. A
hypothetical future fuel model was developed by modifying
standard model 2, “timber (grass and understory).” The
predicted future herbaceous fuel load was 200 lbs/acre,
based on a basal area/herbaceous production relationship
developed in northern Arizona (Brown and others 1974).
Crown fuels were estimated with locally developed allom-
etric equations for ponderosa pine shown in table 1. Crown
volume was estimated using averages of maximum tree
height (top of the canopy) and crown base height (bottom of
the canopy). Crown bulk density was calculated as crown
biomass divided by crown volume. This procedure is straight-
forward and appears to adequately represent the canopy
fuels actually available in a ponderosa pine crown fire.
Alternative methods of crown fuel estimation can lead to
substantially different numerical values, so density values
in different studies may not be directly comparable. The
situation is further complicated by the relatively high sensi-
tivity of crownfire behavior modeling to canopy bulk density.
Fire weather extremes representing the 90th and 97th
percentiles of low fuel moisture, high winds, and high tem-
perature were calculated from 30 years of data on the
Coconino National Forest using the FireFamily Plus pro-
gram (Bradshaw and Brittain 1999). Weather values were
calculated for the entire fire season (April 23 to October 16)
as well as for June, historically the month with the most
severe fire weather (table 2). Fire behavior information from
the two largest wildfires on the Coconino, the 1996 Horse-
shoe (May) and Hochderffer (June) fires, was used to esti-
mate wind gusts during periods of extreme fire behavior

(McCoy 1996). Wind gusts to 40 mph and sustained winds of
30 mph were observed on these fires. The 30-year fire
weather record also shows that winds of 30 mph or more
were recorded in the 1,300 hours observation on approxi-
mately 1 percent of June days.
Results ________________________
Prior to treatment, forest structural conditions were simi-
lar across the study sites (table 3). Basal area ranged from
148.5 to 167.7 ft2/acre, while tree density was more variable
(386.7 to 603.9 trees/acre). Average stand heights were
within 7 ft of each other across the sites (67.2 to 73.9 ft) and
average crown base heights were within approximately 4 ft
(17.4 to 21.5 ft). Crown bulk density values averaged 0.064
to 0.083 kg/m3, similar to values reported by Scott (1998a) in
a Montana ponderosa forest. Thinning reduced tree density
and biomass most strongly in the full restoration (1.5-3)
treatment and least in the 3-6 treatment, as expected.
Postthinning densities ranged from 56.8 to 98.3 trees/acre,
an average reduction of over 396 trees/acre (77 percent to 88
percent of trees removed). Because the largest trees were
retained, however, basal area and crown biomass decreased
by much smaller proportions. Postthinning basal area ranged
from 44 percent to 65 percent of pretreatment values. Thin-
ning reduced crown bulk density to 52 percent to 76 percent
of pretreatment values. Crown base height was raised an
average of 11 ft and the lowest quintile (20 percent) of crown
base height was raised an average of 10.6 ft from 8.5 ft before
thinning to 19.1 ft after thinning. Pretreatment surface
fuels averaged 25.4 tons/acre, but the quintile (20 percent) of
plots with the heaviest loading of less than 1000H fuels
averaged 38.2 tons/acre (table 4). Postthinning fuels were
surprisingly similar between the broadcast slash blocks
(11 tons/acre of less than 1000H fuels) and the whole-tree
harvested block (7.2 tons/acre of less than 1000H fuels).
However, the primary difference was an extra 3.9 tons/acre
of 1H fuels in the broadcast blocks, the fuel component most
strongly influencing fire behavior. The broadcast blocks did
have 80 percent more heavy fuel (more than 1000H and duff)
loading, 18 versus 10 tons/acre. Burnout of these heavy fuels
would be expected to lead to increased canopy and soil
heating in the broadcast blocks after the passage of the
flaming front.
Fires modeled in pretreatment conditions using the aver-
age stand values for crown bulk density and crown base
height remained surface fires (table 5) even under the severe
Table 3—Forest stand structure and crown fuels at the Fort Valley study sites. See text for description of
treatments. Prior to thinning, the lowest quintile of crown base heights averaged 8.5 feet. After
thinning, the lowest quintile of crown base heights in the treated units averaged 19.1 feet.

Potential Fire Behavior Is Reduced Following Forest Restoration Treatments

fire weather conditions represented by the June 97th percen-
tile (table 2). Fire behavior outputs were virtually identical
across treatments prior to treatment, with only slight differ-
ences in the torching index (an estimate of the windspeed
required to initiate tree torching or “passive” crown fire
behavior) and the crowning index (an estimate of the
windspeed required to support “active” fire spreading through
the crown). The minor fluctuations in these two indices
reflected the small differences in crown base height (impor-
tant for the transition from surface fire to torching) and
canopy bulk density (important for sustaining active
crownfire). The torching index showed that a wind of at least
45 mph would have been needed to cause passive crownfire.
If fire were already in the crown or entered from outside the
stand, a windspeed of 28–34 mph would have sufficed to
sustain active canopy burning. However, both indices were
above the modeled 25 mph windspeed.
The simulated flame lengths, 5.4 ft, would have precluded
direct attack by firefighters but mechanized equipment or
indirect attack would have a high likelihood of successful
suppression (Pyne and others 1996). The fact that modeled
fires were amenable to suppression even under severe wild-
fire conditions is an accurate reflection of reality: the over-
whelming majority of wildfires on the Coconino are con-
tained below 10 acres (99.6 percent, fire records 1970–1999).
With 30 mph winds and/or the lowest quintile of crown
base height, however, crownfire was simulated in the pre-
treatment sites. Keeping the crown base height at the
average values but increasing wind to 30 mph led to condi-
tional crownfire behavior (crownfire won’t start, but could be
sustained if it entered from outside the stand) in the stand
with the highest crown bulk density. Lowering the crown
base height to 8.5 ft, the average of the lowest pretreatment
quintile, caused active or passive crownfire in all the sites
at both the 25 and 30 mph windspeeds (table 5). Because
30 mph or higher wind gusts occur, and because at least
one-fifth of the modeled forest is vulnerable to crownfire,
these results may bridge the apparent contradiction be-
tween observed crownfire behavior and the unrealistically
high windspeeds required for simulated crownfires using
average stand characteristics.
Thinning treatments substantially reduced fire behavior
under the same environmental circumstances. As shown in
table 5, with the identical 30 mph wind and the lowest
quintile of posttreatment crown base height, the simulated
fire did not achieve any category of crown burning. All three
treatments had the same torching index (49 mph) but the
crowning index differed with canopy bulk density. The
modeled 3-6 treatment could support conditional crownfire
at windspeeds as low as 40 mph, while the modeled 1.5-3
treatment required 58 mph, 45 percent higher.
Although the comparison in table 4 shows a clear change
in fire behavior due to the restoration treatments, the
postthinning fuels are different than the pretreatment fuels.
As the treatments progress, the slash fuels created by
thinning are scheduled to be removed by prescribed burning.
Mechanical means could also be used. But as long as these
fuels remain in the stand, they present a threat of intense
fire behavior. Active or passive fires crowned in all the
simulated stands, including the treated sites, using either the
broadcast or the whole-tree harvest slash fuel models in
table 4. With standard fuel model 11, however, the control had
active crownfire but the treated stands had only surface fires.
Fire behavior in future fuels, after removal of the slash,
will probably be influenced by a higher herbaceous compo-
nent. Under the hypothetical model presented in table 4,
with 30 mph winds and the lowest quintile of crown base
height, conditional crown fire was predicted for the control
stands and surface fire for all the treated stands.
Discussion _____________________
Model results should always be applied cautiously. Cur-
rent models that link surface and crownfire behavior are
highly sensitive to crown base height, windspeed (or wind
reduction factor), fuel moisture, and surface fuel model
variables (1H fuel loading, herbaceous fuels, surface-area-
to-volume ratio, fuel bed depth). We held slope constant at 7
percent (the average slope of the experimental blocks) but
similar fuels on steeper slopes would exhibit higher fire
intensity. There are a number of uncertainties in the models
integrated in Nexus, reflecting the complexity of fire behav-
ior (Scott 1998b). The actual numerical values used for
model inputs produced realistic predictions but in some
instances the differences between crown and surface fire
behavior were separated by only a few miles/hr of windspeed
(table 5). If wind gusts of higher speeds or higher surface fuel
loadings were encountered, portions of the stands would be
more likely to exhibit crownfire behavior. The behavior of
real fires in these stands would be affected by roads, mead-
ows, surrounding forest fuels, landscape topography, and
suppression activities.
The purpose of the modeling analysis was not to accu-
rately estimate the behavior of a real fire but rather to
compare the treatment alternatives. All three thinning
treatments tested by the Grand Canyon Forests Partner-
ship substantially reduced the potential for passive and
active crownfire. All the treatments increased crown base
height to nearly 30 ft, making passive crownfire initiation
difficult. However, the different thinning levels in the three
treatments created differences in crown bulk density that
were reflected in the potential for active crownfire. Prior to
treatment, the crowning indices of all the stands were
separated by only 6 mph (top section of table 5). After
treatment (bottom of table 5), the crowning index ranged
from 28 mph (control stands), 40 mph (3-6 treatment), 47
mph (2-4 treatment), to 55 mph (1.5-3 treatment). In relative
terms, taking the control crowning index as unity, the 3-6
treatment required 43 percent more windspeed, the 2-4
treatment required 68 percent more windspeed, and the 1.5-
3 treatment required nearly double (96 percent) more
windspeed, for active crownfire.
The restoration treatment is not complete when the thin-
ning is finished. Slash fuels increase the fire hazard as long
as they remain on the ground, so prompt treatment with
prescribed fire or mechanical means is important. Over
time, vegetation in the treated units will change as both
herbaceous plants and trees respond to the thinning. The
potential intensity of grass-fueled fires should not be under-
estimated. Stand basal area even in the full restoration
stands remained high enough to limit predicted herbaceous
production to approximately 200 lbs/acre. If herbaceous

production in the treated stands reached the 1,000 lbs/acre
in the standard fire behavior fuel model 2, passive crownfire
was predicted in the lowest crown base quintile for all
treatments under severe weather conditions. However, grass
fuels would be unlikely to have reached full productivity or
to be fully cured in June. Even with a high fireline intensity,
grass fires are of short duration with few heavy fuels and are
more amenable to control than timber fires.
Strictly from a fire control perspective, therefore, a bal-
ance of relatively more trees and relatively less grass, such
as the 2-4 or 3-6 treatments, might be useful in areas close
to homes. On the other hand, future fire behavior will also be
influenced by the growth of residual trees and new regenera-
tion. Treatments with relatively high residual density might
more rapidly grow back into a hazardous condition. Mainte-
nance burning and/or further thinning can be used to regu-
late growth and keep the stands relatively crownfire-resis-
tant. The failure to carry out these management activities
would eventually eliminate the original treatment effects on
fire behavior.
Potential fire behavior is an important consideration in
the design of wildland/urban interface forest treatments,
but it is not the only consideration. Fire hazard tradeoffs
should be recognized and evaluated against many other
forest values. In the present analysis, we have incorporated
some of the variability in fuels and weather. A more com-
plete analysis, however, could include spatial variability
within stands and across landscapes, temporal variability
(diurnal to seasonal change), successional change (years to
centuries), and predicted changes in land use. In addition to
modeling intensity and behavior of the flaming front, the
effects of fuel burnout and smoke production should be
considered. Many of the tools and components of such a
comprehensive analysis are being rapidly improved.

Abstract—Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) trees established
before Euro-American settlement are becoming rare on the land-
scape. Prescribed fire is the prime tool used to restore ponderosa
pine ecosystems, but can cause high mortality in presettlement
ponderosa pines. This study uses retrospective techniques to esti-
mate mortality from prescribed burns within Grand Canyon Na-
tional Park (GCNP). Live and recently dead presettlement ponde-
rosa pines were sampled in four prescribed burns and three adjacent
unburned areas. Presettlement ponderosa pine mortality (not in-
cluding areas of crownfire) was higher than that of control sites in
all four burns, although control areas showed elevated mortality
rates compared to presettlement times. The highest mortality (23
percent) was found on a prescribed natural fire converted to a
wildfire, the second highest (17 percent) on a site with extremely
heavy mistletoe, the lowest (10 percent) on a spring burn. Bole
scorch height and bole char severity were higher on dead trees than
live trees, and may be useful in predicting postfire mortality. GCNP
management objectives for overstory mortality are probably being
met, but these guidelines do not account for the possibility of
mortality delayed more than 5 years.
Introduction ____________________
Prescribed fire has become the primary tool in attempting
to reverse the degradation of fire-adapted ecosystems due to
past fire exclusion and other management activities. How-
ever, some researchers have raised doubts about reintroduc-
ing fire without otherwise treating the area (Bonnicksen and
Stone 1985; Covington and others 1997; Fiedler and others
1996; Sackett and Haase 1998). Of special concern are high
mortality rates in presettlement-aged, “old-growth” trees
(hereafter presettlement trees). These trees harbor centu-
ries of genetic diversity, provide important wildlife habitat
(Thomas 1979), and are an important aesthetic feature
(Brown and Daniel 1984). Past logging has dramatically
reduced the presettlement ponderosa pine population over
the landscape, and surviving trees are more susceptible to
pathogens, drought, and injury because of increased stress
due to competition from high densities of postsettlement
trees (Covington and others 1994; Feeney and others 1998;
Effect of Prescribed Burning on Mortality of
Presettlement Ponderosa Pines in Grand
Canyon National Park
G. Alan Kaufmann
W. Wallace Covington
Sackett and others 1996; Mast and others 1999). Because
they would take longer to replace than any other living
feature of the ecosystem (200–400 years), preserving a
healthy population of these trees should be an important
long-term management objective (Moore and others 1999;
Mast and others 1999).
Some studies focusing on prescribed fire effects on pre-
settlement pines have found substantial mortality (20–40
percent), some of which can be delayed for a decade or more
(Sackett and Haase 1998; Swezy and Agee 1991; Thomas
and Agee 1986). A major cause of this type of mortality is
thought to be the extended smoldering of the thick duff layer
that has accumulated around large trees in the absence of
fire. Some researchers and managers now recommend rak-
ing this duff away from the bases of the presettlement trees
before burning (Covington and others 1997; Sackett and
Haase 1998; Taylor 1996). Many fire managers regard such
intensive preburn mechanical treatment as impractical to
apply over large areas (A. Farnsworth, Prescribed Fire
Specialist, Coconino National Forest, K. Kerr, Prescribed
Fire Manager, Grand Canyon National Park, personal com-
munications). They argue that basal damage can be con-
trolled by adjusting the burn prescription and that the few
documented cases of unacceptably high mortality were due
to extenuating factors.
Grand Canyon National Park (GCNP) encompasses one of
the largest areas of unlogged ponderosa pine forests remain-
ing in the Southwest. Fire managers have been conducting
prescribed burns in GCNP since 1971 (GCNP, unpublished
data). Over the past few years, fire managers have greatly
increased the area treated with prescribed fire (K. Kerr,
Prescribed Fire Manager, GCNP, personal communication).
More surveys of postburn mortality are needed to deter-
mine if high levels of mortality in presettlement trees are
widespread or limited to special circumstances. Because full
mortality may take a decade or more to be expressed,
conventional fire effects monitoring studies may not provide
information in time to be relevant. This study uses retro-
spective techniques to estimate long-term mortality of pre-
settlement trees on prescribed burn sites within GCNP, and
to relate high mortality to site, burn, and/or tree character-
istics. The merits and limitations of this type of study and
management implications of results are discussed.

elevation. Terrain is dominated by karst topography, mostly
level or rolling but deeply dissected by drainages. Most of the
soils in this area belong to the Soldier series (Bennett 1974).

*Area burned before conversion to wildfire.
Average annual precipitation is 57.9 cm on the North Rim
and 36.8 cm on the South Rim (GCNP, unpublished data).
Precipitation is bimodal, divided between winter snow and
late summer rain, with a distinct dry period in May and
June.
Although ponderosa pine is the dominant overstory spe-
cies at all three sites, the associated species differ. At Swamp
Ridge, white fir (Abies concolor), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga
menziesii), and aspen (Populus tremuloides) are present,
and Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) dominates north
facing slopes. White fir and aspen also are present on the
south end of the Walhalla Plateau, but are confined to mesic
sites—remaining areas are mostly pure ponderosa pine. In
the Grandview area, ponderosa pine-Gambel oak (Quercus
gambelii) forests grade into piñon pine (Pinus edulis)-Utah
juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) woodlands. Big sagebrush
(Artemesia tridentata) and cliffrose (Cowania neomexicana)
are common in openings.
The earliest evidence of human presence in this area is
3,000 to 4,000 years old, with further evidence indicating
more or less continuous habitation through the present
(Altschul and Fairley 1989). The historic fire regime was
disrupted by heavy livestock grazing associated with Euro-
American settlement (Altschul and Fairley 1989). Fire re-
gime disruption dates are 1879 for the western North Rim
and 1887 at Grandview (Fulé and others, in review). Fire
regime disruption was found to be less abrupt on the Walhalla
Plateau, with mean fire intervals not lengthening signifi-
cantly until the early 1900s (Wolf and Mast 1998). Active fire
suppression began with the designations of the Grand Can-
yon Forest Reserve in 1893 and Grand Canyon National
Park 1919. Livestock were fenced out of GCNP by about 1938
(Fulé and others, in review; Verkamp 1940). Most of GCNP
has never been logged.

Effect of Prescribed Burning on Mortality of Presettlement Ponderosa Pines in Grand Canyon National Park
Field Methods
Burns greater than 40 ha in size and 3–7 years old were
selected for this study. A minimum time since fire of 3 years
was necessary because trees injured by fire often take
several years to die (Sackett and Haase 1996; Wagener
1961). The maximum time of 7 years increased the probabil-
ity that outer ring dates could be obtained from increment
cores for most of the trees that died since the fire. Unburned
areas nearby were sampled as controls to determine back-
ground mortality rates (in other words, mortality from old age).
Within a selected site, sampling was limited to areas
dominated by ponderosa pine and showing no evidence of
logging or widespread crown damage from fire. The sites on
the Walhalla Plateau were sampled in 1998 and all other
sites were sampled in 1999. Minor changes in methods
between field seasons are noted. Sites were sampled with
belt transects arranged to capture as much spatial variation
as possible. Transects were 40 m wide. At least 12 ha in each
burn and each control area were surveyed.
Presettlement ponderosa pines judged to have been alive
at the time of the burn were tallied in three categories: green
trees, snags that torched or were severely scorched in the
burn, and recent snags that did not torch. Presettlement
trees were identified in the field using characteristics devel-
oped by Keen (1943) and modified for use in the Southwest
(Covington and Moore 1994; White 1985). Characteristics
included bark characteristics (large plates, light color) and
crown architecture (large, drooping branches, columnar
crown). At each site, several borderline presettlement trees
(in other words, trees whose age was questionable) were
cored and ring-counted in the field to calibrate these charac-
teristics. Additional borderline trees found on the transects
were cored and cross-dated in the lab to evaluate the accu-
racy of this technique.
Tallied trees were randomly sampled at varying rates (2–
20 percent of green trees and 50 or 100 percent of recent
snags), depending on relative densities of green trees and
snags, to optimize transect length and number of trees sampled.
Nominal sampling percentages were held constant for each
transect, but actual percentages varied due to the random
number generator. The total number of green trees and the
total number of recent snags in each transect were recorded.
For each sampled green tree, samples of cambium from
four quadrants (uphill, downhill, and both sides at 40 cm
above the forest floor) were extracted to determine cambium
condition (Ryan 1983). Cambium sampling was initiated in
response to ambiguous data from the 1998 season, and
therefore was not conducted at Walhalla Plateau sites.
Increment cores were taken at 40 cm above the forest floor
and through bark plates instead of through furrows (Ryan
1983). Unless the first core taken from a recent snag was
completely sound, a second core was taken. The following
measurements were made for each cored tree:
• Diameter of the tree or snag at height of core to the
nearest cm.
• Condition class according to a tree, snag and log classi-
fication system based on that of Thomas and others
(1979) and used widely in ponderosa pine forests of the
Southwest (Cunningham and others 1980; Fulé and
others 1997). Green trees were further classified accord-
ing to relative health and vigor (Thompson 1940). This
system has five vigor classes, which are determined by
live crown ratios (LCRs) as follows: AA (“wolf” trees),
LCR 70 percent or more; A (full vigor), LCR 55–70
percent; B (good to fair vigor), LCR 35–55 percent; C (fair
to poor vigor), LCR 20–25 percent; and D (very poor
vigor), LCR less than 20 percent. Recent snags (except
those on the Walhalla Plateau sites) were further clas-
sified as to needle and fine branch retention as follows:
A (retains most needles); B (retains some needles); C (no
needles but retains most fine branches); and D (no
needles but retains some fine branches). Snags lacking
fine branches or having loose bark were assumed to
have died before the fire and were not tallied or sampled.
• Obvious damage and tree abnormalities were recorded
(for example, dwarf-mistletoe, insect attack, lightning
strike, fire scar, fork top, and so forth).
The following measurements were made only on burn sites:
• Bole scorch height (from ground level to the highest point
of scorched bark) was measured to the nearest 0.25 m.
• Basal char severity was quantified using the follow-
ing categories (after Ryan 1983): 0 = no visible char-
ring of bark; 1 = some blackening around base; 2 =
bark plate surface uniformly blackened; 3 = some
depth of char; 4 = deep char.
Dendrochronology
Cores were mounted, sanded, and crossdated (Stokes and
Smiley 1968) using chronologies established for nearby
areas (Fulé and others, in review). A systematic subsample
of 40 percent of the cores was selected for analysis (all cores
from the Walhalla sites were analyzed). Inner ring dates
(IRD, just outside the pith) and outer ring dates (ORD, just
inside the cambium) and were determined. IRD is an esti-
mate of the year of tree establishment. ORD is an estimate
of the year of growth cessation (in other words, imminent
death). If crossdating was adequate for more than 100
rings but then became undatable, rings were counted to
establish the IRD. For cores in which pith was not included
(more than 90 percent of the cores), the IRD was estimated
using a pith locator consisting of concentric rings printed on
a transparency. IRDs were grouped by 25 year age classes
(Mast and others 1999). Undatable cores were classified
according to the reason they could not be dated.
Mortality Estimates
Two types of mortality estimates were made: a “field”
estimate and a “lab” estimate. The field estimate was made
using the tallies of live and recently dead trees on the
transects and the visually determined snag decay classes.
All trees with green needles were assumed alive, and all
snags retaining at least some needles and with tight bark
were assumed to have died within the past 5 years
(Cunningham and others 1981). Trees that torched in the
fire are included in this estimate.
Because this method estimates mortality over approxi-
mately the past 5 years, it may slightly underestimate
mortality for the 7-year-old NW I/II burn and slightly over-
estimate mortality for the other (4-year-old) burns. Because
condition classes of dead trees and numbers of torched trees

Kaufmann and Covington
were not recorded in the first field season, field estimates
using all tallied dead trees (but not including torched trees)
are substituted for the Walhalla sites. These numbers over-
estimate mortality by including many snags that died before
the prescribed burn.
“Lab” estimates were based on dendrochronological data.
Green trees were assumed alive if the ORD was equal to or
1 year less than the date of sampling. They were assumed
dead or dying after the burn if the core showed no growth for
2 years or more before the date of sampling, but were still
growing in the year of the burn. It is well established that
ponderosa pines showing no basal area growth for 2 years or
more have little chance of survival (Rogers and others 1981;
Mast and Veblen 1994). Recent snags were assumed to
have died after the fire if their ORD was in or after the year
of the burn. Snags with earlier ORDs were assumed dead or
dying at the time of the burn.
The field estimates are expressed as the percentage of
the trees that were alive at the time of the burn but had died
by the date of sampling. The lab estimates include some
near-future mortality. Neither type of estimate can be
directly compared among sites because of the variation in
time lags between the burn dates and the sampling dates
(3 to 7 years—table 1).
Other Data Analyses
Mean tree diameters were compared between live and
dead trees for each site with Bonferroni-corrected approxi-
mate two-tailed t-tests for independent samples with unequal
variances (corrected p = 0.0071; Ott 1993). Mean bole scorch
heights were compared similarly for each burn (corrected
p = 0.0125).
Bole char severity distributions for live and dead trees on
each burn site (excepting Matthes, which was discarded
from this analysis due to inconsistent data collection
methods) were analyzed using a Bonferroni-corrected Chi-
squared contingency test (corrected p = 0.0167, df = 4; Ott
1993). Vigor class distributions for live and dead trees were
also compared with this test, but results were grouped for all
sites (p = 0.05, df = 3). Due to the small number of “AA” trees,
this category was combined with “A.”
Results and Discussion __________
Sampling
Several issues about the way trees were sampled may
influence the conclusions from the data. First, because
different proportions of trees were sampled in different
transects, some sampled trees represent a greater propor-
tion of the tree population than others do. Second, the
crossdating of cores from borderline presettlement trees
revealed that most unsampled borderline trees in the
Grandview area were in fact of presettlement age. No pre-
settlement trees sampled in 1999 were found to be of
postsettlement age. Additionally, few trees tallied in the
transects were under 41 cm diameter at 1.37 m, the cutoff for
what GCNP fire managers consider overstory trees (K. Kerr,
Prescribed Fire Manager, GCNP, personal communication).
Presettlement trees smaller than this were almost all highly
suppressed members of old-growth clumps. Taken together,
these factors suggest that the tree population examined in
this study is comparable to the population specified in the
GCNP overstory mortality objective. However, the youngest
class of presettlement trees (120–150 years old) might be
relatively underrepresented, and the highly suppressed
presettlement trees relatively overrepresented.
The total number of cores for which an ORD could be
determined varied from 31 to 67 per site. The number of
cores from green trees varied from 22 to 64. The number of
cores from dead trees whose ORD was in or after the year of
the fire ranged from 11 to 21 for burned sites and only three
to five for unburned control sites. The Grandview sites have
smaller numbers of useable cores than the North Rim sites.
For many cores, especially those from dead trees, the ORD
could not be determined due to breakage, rot, extreme
suppression, or other reasons. These cores are hereafter
referred to as “unusable.” The proportion of unusable cores
from recent snags ranged from 17 percent to 72 percent, and
tended to be higher in control areas. Because of the relatively
small numbers of dead trees found on these sites, older
classes of snags were more likely to be sampled. The number
of broken and rotten cores increased along the xeric-mesic
gradient between sites (most broken cores were also due to
rot). The average proportion of unreadable dead cores is
comparable to that reported by Mast and Veblen (1994). The
sometimes high proportion of unusable cores may bias lab
estimates due to the undersampling of rot-infected trees.
Estimates of Presettlement Tree Mortality
One GCNP fire management objective is to keep overstory
mortality, as measured 5 years postburn, below 20 percent
over the entire vegetation type in the Park (K. Kerr, Pre-
scribed Fire Manager, GCNP, personal communication).
Because the main purpose of this study was to document
mortality due to factors other than crown damage, mortality
due to widespread crown damage was not documented,
although estimates do include trees that torched individu-
ally. Therefore, landscape level mortality is higher than
numbers reported here.
Field estimates show mortality of presettlement trees in
all burned areas is many times greater than in respective
controls (table 2). This result supports the idea that noncrown
damage from prescribed fires can lead to increased mortality
of presettlement trees. The Swamp Ridge area control site
estimate may be artificially low due to faster rates of snag
decay at this more mesic site. The other control area esti-
mates show mortality rates somewhat lower (0.5–0.75 per-
cent/year) than other studies measuring contemporary back-
ground mortality in mature ponderosa pine (1–2 percent/
year—Avery and others 1976; Hamilton and Edwards 1976;
Mast and others 1999). However, these rates are still much
higher than estimates of mortality rates in presettlement
times (Mast and others 1999).
The field estimate shows 27 percent mortality on the
Hance burn, more than twice that of any other site. This site
has very high levels of dwarf-mistletoe infection (70 percent
of the trees on transects were infected, compared to 40
percent on the Grandview control area and 20 percent on the
Grapevine burn). Infected trees are more likely to torch due
to low witches’ brooms and have reduced vigor (Harrington

Kaufmann and Covington

increasing fire intensity and a lack of resources. The second-
highest mortality was found on the dwarf-mistletoe-infested
Hance burn. The Grapevine burn, which had the lowest lab
mortality estimate (comparable to the rates in control areas)
was a spring burn. This suggests that burning in the spring,
when forest floor moisture is high, might reduce basal
damage. However, spring burning may have other undesir-
able consequences. For the burns in the Grandview and
Swamp Ridge Areas, these lab estimates translate to the
death of approximately five presettlement pines/ha. The
Matthes burn, occurring in the study area with the highest
density of mature pines, had a much higher per-unit-area
rate. According to the lab estimate for that burn, approxi-
mately 20 presettlement pines/ha died.
If these mortality estimates are accurate, and mortality
due to crown damage is not widespread, GCNP manage-
ment objectives (less than 20 percent overstory mortality 5
years postburn) are probably being met. However, the
GCNP management objective does not address the possi-
bility of significant mortality after 5 years. Sackett and
Haase (1998), studying presettlement ponderosa pine mor-
tality at the Chimney Spring site in northern Arizona,
found that mortality may take more than a decade to be
fully expressed. Five years after the initial burns at Chim-
ney Spring, “old-growth” mortality averaged approximately
28 percent in the burned areas. Eighteen years after the
burns, the overall old-growth mortality had almost doubled
to 50 percent, and old-growth trees were still dying at
higher rates than those in the unburned control area were.
However, the severe drought in 1996 (the year after most
of the sites in this study were burned) probably was a
contributing factor in the deaths of many trees. Trees were
killed that otherwise may have lingered for years in a
weakened state. It is therefore likely that these mortality
estimates account for a high proportion of the fire-induced
mortality on the burn sites.
Tree, Site, and Burn Characteristics
No statistically significant differences were found in com-
parisons of diameter or age between live and dead trees on
burn sites. Vigor was lower for trees in burned areas than for
trees in control areas, but this was not statistically signifi-
cant, either.
Although not statistically significant, mean bole scorch
height (excluding values above 10 m) was higher for dead
trees than for live trees for all burns. Basal char severity was
higher on recently dead trees on all three burns analyzed.
These results support the hypothesis that basal and/or root
damage is a contributing factor to postburn mortality. Mea-
sures of fire intensity at the bases of trees must be consid-
ered in addition to crown scorch when predicting postfire
mortality of large trees (Ryan 1983; Regelbrugge and Conard
1993). The failure to identify more significant differences in
tree and burn characteristics may be due to the relatively
small sample sizes of recent dead trees from some sites.
Conclusions____________________
Estimates show that mortality levels of presettlement
ponderosa pines in Grand Canyon National Park are higher
Table 2—Presettlement ponderosa pine mortality estimates. These
numbers represent the proportion of trees alive at the
time of the prescribed burn that died between the burn
date and time of sampling. The field mortality estimate
counts all snags retaining needles as dead since the
burns. The estimates in parentheses include snags with
no needles but most fine branches due to the older age
of the NW I/II burn. Because of different data collection
methods, the field estimates for Walhalla sites (in italics)
include all recent snags retaining needles and/or fine
branches. For the lab estimates, a tree is considered
dead/dying if its core shows that it has not put on a growth
ring for 2 years or more. This estimate can be thought of
as including some near-future mortality. All South Rim
sites were sampled 4 years postburn. NW sites were
sampled 7 years postburn, and WP sites 3 years
postburn.

and Hawksworth 1991) making them more susceptible to
other damage. The field estimate for this site may be inflated
because of the tendency for witches’ brooms to stay alive
many years after most of the tree canopy has died (Mathiasen
1996). This could cause many trees that were effectively
dead before the prescribed burn to retain needles until the
date of sampling.
The Grapevine and Matthes burns show intermediate
mortality rates around 10 percent, while the field estimate
for the Northwest I/II burn is extremely low (2 percent), even
lower than some estimates of background mortality. If snags
of condition class C are included, the estimate is 12 percent.
True mortality on this site is probably somewhere between
these numbers.
The lab estimates, which count trees with cores showing
zero growth for 2 years or more as dead or dying, include
some near-future mortality. They show background mortal-
ity rates roughly comparable to those in other studies (about
1–2 percent/year—Avery and others 1976; Hamilton and
Edwards 1976; Mast and others 1999). These numbers
translate to the death of approximately 2–7 presettlement
pines/ha/decade, depending on the presettlement tree densi-
ties at the different sites. The Grandview control site shows
a higher mortality rate than the two North Rim control sites,
possibly because of higher stress levels of on the former,
more xeric site.
The lab estimates show the highest mortality (23 percent)
for the Matthes burn, which was a prescribed natural fire
that was converted to wildfire status and suppressed due to

in areas treated with prescribed fire compared to unburned
areas, even when discounting mortality due to crown dam-
age. Higher mortality is associated with high infection levels
of dwarf-mistletoe on one site, and prescribed natural fire
that was converted to wildfire on another site. The lowest
postburn mortality rate (little higher than control area
mortality) occurred on a spring burn, possibly because higher
forest floor and soil moisture levels reduced basal damage.
Because of the small sample size (four burns), it is not
possible to generalize these associations between height-
ened mortality and other factors. More postburn mortality
surveys are needed.
Postburn mortality as measured on these four prescribed
burns is probably within management objectives of the
GCNP fire program. Because of the 1996 drought, future
mortality on these burns is predicted to be relatively low.
However, the reduced vigor of trees in the burns in this
study, as well as results from other studies, suggest that
mortality rates can remain abnormally high long after 5
years postburn in some cases. Methods of predicting future
mortality (for example, from annual growth increment data)
should be used to supplement studies such as this one.
Mortality estimates based on dendrochronological data in
unburned control areas agreed closely with background
mortality estimates from other studies. These may be much
higher than historical rates, probably because of increased
competitive stresses due to higher tree densities in contem-
porary forests. The 1996 drought might also have elevated
the mortality rates in the control areas. The unburned area
surveyed on the xeric South Rim shows especially high
mortality (more than 2 percent/year). These figures high-
light the need to reinvigorate presettlement trees as well as
merely protecting them.
This study could not identify tree characteristics associ-
ated with increased risk of postfire mortality. Studies mea-
suring tree characteristics both before and after burns are
probably better suited than retrospective surveys to gather
this type of information. Measures of basal fire intensity
were higher on dead trees than live trees in all burns. This
agrees with results from other studies and argues that these
measures can be important in predicting postburn mortality
of mature trees.

Abstract—Vegetation and fuel loading plots were monitored and
sampled in wilderness areas treated with prescribed fire. Changes
in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest structure tree species
and fuel loading are presented. Plots were randomly stratified and
established in burn units in 1995. Preliminary analysis of nine plots
2 years after burning show litter was reduced 54.3 percent, duff was
reduced 34.7 percent, ponderosa pine tree density in the 10.2 cm to
30.5 cm d.b.h. (diameter at breast height) size class was reduced 18
percent, and ponderosa pine tree density greater than 61.2 cm d.b.h.
increased in Zion National Park.
Introduction ____________________
Historically, lightning and human caused fires influenced
vegetation structure. Vegetation is constantly growing and
changing and fire provides a natural means of checks and
balances for many landscapes. Fires reduced fuel accumula-
tions and maintained open, grassy forest stands. However,
human settlement and land use practices resulted in fewer
fires and those that did ignite were quickly suppressed,
whether in wilderness or not. As a result, forest structure
has changed with increased fuel loads and thicker tree and
shrub densities.
Fire is a natural process and a critical component in
nutrient cycling and vegetation structure maintenance of
many ecosystems. “Entire ecosystems can be drastically
altered or maintained by periodic burning” (Kozlowski and
Ahlgren 1973). Fire is a tool that can be used in restoring
many forested and nonforested areas.
West and Madany (1981) cited Alter (1942) with a de-
scription from Priddy Meek’s journal. This description is of
the land just to the northeast of what is presently Zion
National Park. In June of 1852, Priddy described the area
as “…Rich soil, plenty of grass and timber… so that a team
and wagon might be driven any place…. We traveled three
days amongst this timber, which is of the best quality and
clear of underbrush.” What caused this open vegetation
structure? Many studies have shown that ponderosa pine
vegetation systems have evolved with fire and require it for
growth and recruitment. West and Madany (1981) re-
searched the fire history of Zion National Park and stated
that, “From the fire scar record we can safely state that any
location within a ponderosa pine forest burned at least
once, and more likely twice, every decade in the time before
white settlement.” This conclusion fits comparable de-
scriptions from early settlers of the West and demonstrates
that many fire cycles have been missed in this fire regime.
Using prescribed fire in wilderness areas may help restore
this scene of open forests, as well as promote nutrient
cycling and vegetation structure maintenance at Zion and
across the West. “The inescapable conclusion of fire effects
in ponderosa pine is that the land manager responsible for
these communities should be doing a lot of burning”
(Saveland and Bunting 1987).
Objectives _____________________
Specific objectives for an initial prescribed fire treatment
of ponderosa pine were: Reduce needle/litter and duff
layers by 40–60 percent, and attain a 30–60 percent de-
crease in ponderosa pine of size class 10.2–30.5 cm diam-
eter at breast height (d.b.h.). The objective for ponderosa
pine greater than 61.2 cm d.b.h. was to maintain the
density of trees. However, fires and effects can be unpre-
dictable so mortality was required to be limited to 20
percent for fire prescription parameters.
Study Area _____________________
Zion National Park is located in southwestern Utah. The
park covers 59,490 ha and ranges in elevation from 1,127 to
2,659 m. Temperatures vary with elevation, with lows
below 0 ∞F in the upper elevations during winter, and
exceed 100 ∞F at lower elevations during summer. Afternoon
thunderstorms are common in July and August. Peak pre-
cipitation occurs December through March with an average
of 15 inches annually at park headquarters. Ponderosa pine
occurs from approximately 1,980 to 2,400 m in Zion National
Park. The random plots were located in the Stave Spring,
Echo Canyon, East Boundary, and Goose Creek prescribed
burn units.

Effects of Low Intensity Prescribed Fires on Ponderosa Pine Forests in Wilderness Areas of Zion National Park, Utah
Handbook Protocols (USDI NPS 1992). Nine plots were
stratified randomly within the prescribed burn units. The
plots, established before a controlled burn, consist of a 20 x
50 m area. All overstory trees (>15.1 cm d.b.h.) were re-
corded in the 20 x 50 m area. Pole sized trees (2.51 cm–15.0
cm d.b.h.) were sampled in a 10 x 25 m section and seedling
sized trees (<2.50 cm d.b.h.) were sampled in a 3 x 10 m
section. Brush and herbaceous plants are also sampled in
the plot but not analyzed for this poster. Forest fuel load
conditions were measured on four transects. Fuel load data
are calculated for litter, duff, 1, 10, 100, and 1,000-hour fuels
(Brown 1974). Plots were sampled immediate postburn, 1,
and 2 years after the burn to monitor the effects. Plots will
be sampled at 5, 10, and 20 years after the burn or until the
area has fire introduced again and the sampling starts over
for a second burn event sampling all components described
above. Plots in this study were burned between 1996 and
1997 during the months of September through November.
Immediate postburn sampling was done within 1 month of
the burn and sampled burn severity, overstory tree postfire
assessment, and fuel loading transects. Burn severity was
assessed on a scale of one to five, and done in conjunction
with the fuel loading transects. At each sample point, sever-
ity was evaluated in a 4 square decimeter area. For ex-
ample, if litter and duff were consumed leaving white ash
and all plant parts were consumed, the area would be rated
one (1). If the area was not burned, it would be rated five (5)
for unburned. The data were then averaged to give a percent
for organic substrate and vegetation categories and to esti-
mate burn severity for the area.
Overstory tree postfire assessment characterizes the
amount of heat received by the trees, via sampling char
height, scorch height, and percent crown scorch. Char height
was measured from the ground to the maximum height on
the bole of the tree. Scorch height was measured from the
ground to highest point where foliar death was evident.
Percent scorch was an estimate of the entire crown of the
tree that was scorched.
Prescribed Burn Conditions
The ponderosa pine fuels were classified as a timber fuel
model 09 (Anderson 1982). Fuel models were used to predict
fire behavior and to assess the potential to control a fire and
protect resources. Plots were burned between 1,100 and
1,600 hours. Weather conditions during prescribed fires
included: ambient air temperatures of 55 ∞F to 70 ∞F,
relative humidity of 13–33 percent, mid-flame wind speeds
of 0–18 km per hour, and 0–70 percent shade. Fire behavior
observations included: flame lengths of 0.2 to 0.6 m, flame
zone depths of 0.4–0.8 m, rates of spread for backing fires of
5 to 17 m per hour (m/hr), flanking fires of 5 to 15 m/hr, and
head fires of 11 to 18 m/hr.
Results ________________________
Average burn severity was 3.7 for organic substrate giving
a “lightly burned” rating and 4.0 for vegetation for a “scorched”
rating (fig. 1). Overstory tree postfire assessment averages
for char and scorch heights were 1.4 m and 2 m, respectively.
The average canopy scorch was 10.7 percent for 254 trees.
Litter was reduced 55.3 percent from 1.03 kg/m2 to 0.46 kg/
m2 at the immediate postburn sample. Duff was reduced
34.7 percent from 4.52 kg/m2 to 2.97 kg/m2 immediate
postburn (fig. 2). Total fuel loading was reduced 34.5 percent
from 6.89 kg/m2 to 4.50 kg/m2 immediate postburn (fig. 3).
Ponderosa pine overstory in the 10.2–30.5 cm d.b.h. size
classes was reduced 18 percent from 138.9 trees per ha to
114.4 trees per ha and trees greater than 61.2 cm increased
from 1.1 to 7.8 trees per ha within 2 years after the burn
(fig. 4).
Discussion _____________________
This early analysis indicates that prescribed fire may be
used to reduce fuels and small trees without mortality of
large trees (figs. 5–10). These initial prescribed fires were
designed to treat the areas multiple times with low to
moderate fire intensities and to reduce the potential of fire
starts, natural or human-caused, that occur under both
extremely dry conditions and heavy fuel accumulations from
years of fire suppression. Thinning was considered but due
to the area being wilderness, prescribed fire was chosen.
After some of the areas have been treated with prescribed
fires, it is hoped that fire will be restored to occur naturally.
Ecosystems are complex, dynamic, and difficult to sample
and analyze. With many of these environmental factors and
others (soil composition, precipitation, topography, vegeta-
tion composition and structure, live vegetation fuel mois-
ture, fire behavior, air temperature, and relative humidity),
sample error needs to be discussed. It can be seen from the
data that standard error varied. What may be represented
here may not be what actually occurred. Due to many
variables in observing and recording data, it is difficult to
accurately sample without some error.
Minimum plot calculations were done using an 80 percent
confidence level with an R-value of 25. Eight plots were
needed for total fuel loading and seven plots were needed for
overstory tree density to meet the 80 percent confidence
level. A paired t-test was done on litter fuel loading, duff fuel
loading, total fuel loading, overstory (10.2 to 30.5 cm), and
overstory (61.2 cm) tree densities. The t-test showed the
following values, respectively: 5.246, 2.779, 3.948, 2.204,
and –1.250, showing in general a significant change from
pre- to postburn conditions.
Objectives and target conditions are continually being
developed and redefined from knowledge of the past and
present. There are many factors that need to be considered
when dealing with fire and vegetation succession. “Fire
history has a decided influence on the particular succes-
sional status of vegetation and in what direction and at
what rate it is changing” (West and Loope 1977). Thus, it is
not surprising that prescribed fire has become a useful tool
to meet a variety of management objectives (Biswell and
others 1973).
Summary ______________________
Needle/litter fuel load layer was reduced 54 percent. This
meets the objective to reduce it by 40 to 60 percent. Duff fuel
loading was reduced 35 percent. This is close to meeting the
objective. Pole sized trees were reduced 18 percent, which is

decrease in this size class. These results provide some
evidence that prescribed burning can be an important step
in restoring some vegetation structure described in the past
(figs. 5–10). Continued burning and monitoring may help
restore the natural range of variability in these vegetation
communities to a self-sustaining state. “One of the primary
and unique missions of the National Park Service is to
perpetuate natural ecosystems in a state approximating the
pristine” (Stone 1965; Houston 1971).

Abstract—Prescribed fire was used to reduce fuel loading and
tree densities. Permanent vegetation and fuel loading plots were
randomly established within prescribed burn units. The plots
were established in 1995 and were sampled, immediately postburn
(within 1 month of the fire), 1 year after the burn, and 2 years after
the burn. The prescribed burns were implemented in August of
1995. Preliminary analysis of 11 plots shows fuel loading was
reduced from 31.9 tons/acre to 11.4 tons/acre immediate postburn.
White fir (Abies concolor) overstory was reduced 35 percent, poles
52 percent, and seedlings 71 percent by the second year following
the burn.
Introduction ____________________
Many factors influence vegetation succession and how a
fire burns across the landscape, but both are mainly
affected by land use or management practices. A few other
factors include: soil composition, precipitation, topogra-
phy, vegetation composition and structure, live vegeta-
tion fuel moisture, fire behavior, air temperature, and
relative humidity. All of these factors combine to produce
varied effects on successional vegetation mosaics. “A com-
parison of today’s landscape at Bryce Canyon National
Park with the landscape shown in historic photographs
indicates that a major change has occurred in the Park’s
vegetative mosaic” (Roberts and others 1993). “Journals
from early settlers in Garfield County [Bryce Canyon
area] describe open forests, where visibility was several
hundred yards. These early ranchers and farmers tell of
being able to take a wagon and team of horses through the
forests on top of the Paunsaugunt Plateau” (Bryant 1995).
What caused the change in the vegetation and landscape
as described above? Land use practices and an active role
in suppressing fires are the main factors that helped
influence the change. Prescribed fire may be used in
restoring the natural vegetative mosaic.

Objectives _____________________
The main objectives of the project were to use prescribed
fire to reduce hazardous fuel conditions and to burn the area
with a low fire intensity. Specific objectives were to reduce
total fuel load 20–50 percent immediate postburn, reduce
white fir (Abies concolor) poles 10–20 percent, and white fir
seedlings 20–40 percent within 2 years of the burn. Using
prescribed fire may reduce fuels and vegetation densities to
diminish the risk of a catastrophic wildfire. “[A park man-
agement goal]…is to restore the park ecosystem to a condi-
tion typical of pre-European settlement and prior to the
establishment of fire exclusion policies” (Bryant 1994).
Study Area _____________________
Bryce Canyon National Park, in south/central Utah on the
Paunsaugunt Plateau, covers 35,852 acres and ranges in
elevation from 6,000 ft to 9,000 ft. Mixed conifer forests
range above 8,200 ft. The prescribed burns occurred in the
County Line and Yovimpa burn units in the south end of the
park. General weather patterns include temperature ranges
from –30 ∞F to 90 ∞F. Precipitation peaks are in January/
February and July/August.
Methods _______________________
In 1995, 11 mixed conifer (Abies concolor/Pinus ponde-
rosa) vegetation-monitoring plots were established accord-
ing to the Western Region Fire Monitoring Handbook Proto-
cols (USDI NPS 1992). All plots were randomly located
within the prescribed burn units. The plots, established
before a controlled burn, consist of a 20-m by 50-m area. All
overstory trees (>15.1 cm diameter at breast height, d.b.h.)
are recorded in the 20 m x 50 m area. Pole trees (2.51 to
15.0 cm d.b.h.) are recorded in a 10 m x 25 m area. Seedling
trees (<2.5 cm d.b.h.) are recorded in a 5 m x 10 m area. Forest
fuel is calculated on four, 50 ft transects. Calculations
measure litter, duff, 1, 10, 100, and 1,000-hour fuels following
the methodology of Brown (1974). The plots were sampled
immediate postburn, 1, and 2 years after the prescribed burns.
Burn severity is determined within 1 month of the burn.
It is assessed on a scale of 1 to 5 (fig. 1) and conducted in
conjunction with the Brown’s fuel loading transects. At each
sample point (1, 5, 10 ft, and so forth), severity is evaluated
in a 4 square-decimeter area. For example if litter and duff
is consumed leaving white ash and all plant parts are
consumed the area would be rated one (1). If the area was not
burned, it would be rated five (5) for unburned. This informa-
tion is then calculated to give an average burn severity.

Results ________________________
Burn severity ratings showed that 19.9 percent of the
sample received a one (1) heavily burned rating, 18.9 percent
received a two to four rating, and 61.2 percent receiving an
unburned rating (fig. 1) creating a patchy burn with varied
intensities across the landscape. The average burn severity
ratings were 3.9 for organic substrate and 3.8 for vegetation
for a “lightly burned” rating. Burn severity for the 11 plots
was lower than expected given the mortality seen in the
overstory, pole, and seedling trees especially with a signifi-
cant amount receiving an unburned rating (N = 11 for this
sample).
Figure 2 shows the mean total fuel load and standard error
of the sample. The preburn fuel loading was 31.9 tons/acre.
Fuel loading was reduced 64 percent to 11.4 tons/acre imme-

pre fuel loading level to 16.5 tons/acre 2 years after the burn.
Figures 3 through 5 show the mean overstory, pole, and
seedling tree densities with standard errors. White fir over-
story trees had a density of 81.7 trees/acre preburn and
ponderosa pine had a density of 22.8 trees/acre. Two years
after the burn, overstory white fir was reduced 35 percent to
53 trees/acre and overstory ponderosa pine was reduced 16
percent to 19.1 trees/acre. White fir poles decreased 52
percent from 169.2 trees/acre to 80.9 trees/acre 2 years after
the burn and ponderosa poles decreased 50 percent from 5.9
trees/acre to 2.9 trees/acre. Seedling white fir decreased 71
percent from 1,604.1 trees/acre to 463 trees/acre 2 years
after the burn, while ponderosa pine seedlings decreased 40
percent from 36.8 trees/acre to 22.1 trees per acre. It is
interesting to note that there were no quaking aspen (Popu-
lous tremuloides) seedlings preburn, but 2 years after the
burn aspen was regenerating (fig. 5). At the 2-year reading,

Discussion
Results demonstrate that this fire produced small to
medium changes to the total fuel load, overstory trees, pole
trees, and seedling trees. These low intensity fires (“lightly
burned”) can result in some mortality to overstory, pole, and

seedling-sized trees. Monitoring shows changes in preburn
and postburn forest fuel conditions (fuel loading) and over-
story, pole, and seedling trees densities. “In mixed conifer
forests where white fir dominates the understory due to
years of fire suppression, prescribed low-intensity surface
fires will kill large numbers of white fir” (FEIS 1996). “ This
reduces the hazard of white fir providing a fuel ladder to
ignite the crown of overstory trees and also restores tree
species composition closer to that of pristine conditions”
(FEIS 1996).
Remnant populations of quaking aspen were scattered
throughout the mixed conifer forests and it was hoped that
through using prescribed fire, the aspen would be stimu-
lated and regenerate in openings created by the fire. The
results demonstrate that this may be occurring but, it is too
early to report any significance of aspen regeneration.
In 1995 Jenkins examined the mixed conifer forest near
the south end of the park and concluded that the mean fire
return interval was 7.5 prior to the 1900s. “Studies con-
cluded that the accumulation of woody vegetation and down
and dead woody fuels have increased significantly in the
present century” in Bryce Canyon National Park (Jenkins
1995).
Ecosystems are complex and dynamic. It is difficult to
accurately sample them without error. Figure 3 demon-
strates this point. Overstory white fir trees were reduced
from 81.7 trees/acre preburn to 64.0 trees/acre postburn.
However, at the 1 year reading there were 69.5 trees/acre.
This is due to the difficulty in accurately determining if the
tree is dead or alive immediate postburn due to scorching of
the tree canopy. Observers introduce error regardless of
their knowledge, experience, and expertise on the job. Due to
many variables in observing and recording data, it is diffi-
cult to accurately sample without some error.
Minimum plot calculations were done using an 80 percent
confidence level with an R value of 25. Eleven plots were
necessary for total fuel load to meet the 80 percent confi-
dence level. Overstory trees required six plots, poles 35 plots,
and seedlings needed 44 plots to meet 80 percent confidence.
It is important to remember that the sample size must be
large enough to infer that the result has occurred across the
entire landscape, when evaluating the data.
Conclusion_____________________
The results indicate that (“lightly burned”) low intensity
prescribed burns will create small to medium changes creat-
ing openings in the forest. These results meet the project and
program objectives at Bryce Canyon. Total fuel loading was
reduced a little over half. Overstory, pole, and seedling
densities were reduced with moderate changes. With all of
the factors that influence vegetation succession and fire
severity in the environment, a mosaic of patterns and inten-
sities from fire can be expected. Fire behavior and intensity
can vary from burn to burn, and will vary across the land-
scape producing different effects. These changes move the
forest vegetation structure toward a less crowded forest
where future prescribed or natural fires will function in

of what prescribed fire can do in this vegetation type.

ous fuel loads and reestablishing pre-settlement fire re-
gimes” (Jenkins 1995).

Fire Process Research Natural Areas:
Managing Research and Restoration of
Dynamic Ecosystem Processes
Timothy Ingalsbee
Abstract—Since 1992 a collaborative group of fire scientists, forest
conservationists, and Federal resource specialists have been devel-
oping proposals for a Research Natural Area (RNA) in the Warner
Creek Fire area on the Willamette National Forest in Oregon.
Inspired by these proposals, the Oregon Natural Heritage Plan
created the new category of “Fire Process RNAs” in order to protect
landscape-scale areas for dynamic ecosystem disturbance and suc-
cession processes resulting from wildland fires. Fire Process RNAs
have many values for basic wildland fire research, ecosystem
restoration, biodiversity conservation, and public education. They
are especially suited to frequent-fire ecosystems, such as the ponde-
rosa pine ecosystems of the Southwest and could serve as important
control areas for measuring the effects of managed restoration
activities and broad-scale environmental change due to global
warming. This paper will: (1) present some of the history and theory
of the evolving Warner Fire Process RNA proposals; (2) discuss some
of the social issues, scientific controversies, and management chal-
lenges involved with designing and managing Fire Process RNAs;
and (3) present the Warner proposal and its public support as a
model to advocate for a network of Fire Process RNAs throughout
fire-prone ecosystems of the West.
Introduction ____________________
In October 1991, arsonists ignited the Warner Creek Fire
inside a protected Habitat Conservation Area (HCA) man-
aged for the northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina).
The wildfire burned across 8,900 acres of public wildlands,
including the entire 6,800 acre Cornpatch Inventoried
Roadless Area. The Warner Creek Fire became the second
largest, costliest wildfire in the history of the Willamette
National Forest. Fearing that the fire-killed snags and logs
posed a risk of potential future catastrophic wildfire, the
Forest Service proposed extensive salvage logging in order
to reduce fuel loads and construct fuel breaks. This sparked
a firestorm of controversy among conservationists who feared
copycat arson-for-salvage incidents would occur in other
protected habitat reserves.
Over the next 4 years, the Warner Salvage Sale became
one of the most controversial, contested timber sales in the
country. The Clinton Administration finally withdrew the
timber sale in 1996, and no salvage logging ever occurred
inside the wildfire area. Currently, the Warner Burn repre-
sents one of the rarest landscapes in the Cascadia bioregion:
a roadless, mid-elevation, largely unmanaged burned forest
containing both young natural stands and high-mortality
old-growth stands.
During the conflict over the Warner Salvage Sale, a
collaboration among fire scientists, forest conservationists,
and Forest Service resource specialists proposed that the
Warner Burn be managed as a Research Natural Area
(RNA) in order to research and restore natural fire distur-
bance and succession processes. This idea was first articu-
lated in “Alternative EF: Ecology of Fire” published in the
Warner Fire Recovery Project’s Final Environmental Im-
pact Statement. The Warner Creek Fire and Alternative EF
inspired a formal revision of the Oregon Natural Heritage
Plan that eventually created the new “Fire Process” RNAs.
These were intended to protect large areas of public land for
research, education, and restoration of dynamic ecosystem
disturbance and recovery processes associated with wild-
land fire.
The vision of the Warner Fire Process RNA has been
expanded in a more recent proposal that utilizes Conserva-
tion Biology principles to link the Warner Burn with five
adjacent Inventoried Roadless Areas and two designated
Wilderness Areas. This would form a landscape-scale fire
ecology research complex suited to the fire regime of the
westside Cascades. Anticipating future progressive devel-
opments in fire management philosophy and policy, propo-
nents seek to develop a model fire management plan for the
RNA that would facilitate research and restoration-oriented
prescribed burning, wildland fire monitoring, innovative
minimum-impact suppression techniques, and showcase
fire ecology education in various interpretive trails and
displays. However, as the Warner RNA Proposal evolves, it
encounters increasingly complex social, scientific, and man-
agement issues that challenge not only our desires to “learn
from the burn,” but also our abilities to live with wildland
fire.
This paper discusses the development of the citizen-
initiated Warner Fire Process RNA Proposal out of the
Warner Creek Fire and the Warner Fire Recovery Project. I
hope that this paper will inspire efforts to develop additional
Fire Process RNA proposals in other regions, especially the
ponderosa pine ecosystems of the Southwest. I also hope that
this paper will reinforce the growing understanding among
the fire community that basic fire ecology field research and
education are strategic needs that can provide essential

management guides and critical public support for forest
ecosystem restoration programs.
Warner Creek Fire _______________
Ignited by arsonists during extreme drought conditions,
the Warner Creek Fire entered the tree canopy almost from
the point of ignition, and surged rapidly upslope. During a
blow-up event, nearly 3,000 acres of prime spotted owl
habitat were severely burned in a single afternoon. Stands
of old-growth Douglas-fir, western hemlock, and western
red cedar were completely scorched from ground to crown,
affecting 42 percent of the burned acres. Another 25 percent
of the area had some intermediate or mixed mortality
ranging from 30–70 percent of the overstory trees. Approxi-
mately 33 percent of the area experienced a low-intensity
underburn, removing most of the grasses, forbs, shrubs, and
saplings, but causing little or no mortality of the overstory
trees (Brown and others 1998: 4). This includes 512 acres
that were completely unburned within the interior of the
Warner burn, inside the designated old-growth grove lo-
cated at the bottom of the Kelsey Creek basin. As the wildfire
backed down the steep ridges, the fire was naturally extin-
guished when it entered the moist primeval forest in the
valley bottom. Forest Service scientists later determined
that fire has not burned in Kelsey Creek Basin for the last
850 years.
Although the Warner Creek Fire was ignited and propa-
gated by unnatural ignition sources—criminal arsonists—
the resulting mosaic of fire effects was representative of the
natural fire regime of the westside Oregon Cascades. The
fire was especially effective in restoring the ridgetop com-
plex of dry meadows. These meadows were previously main-
tained by frequent lightning and Indian burning along the
historic trail corridor atop Bunchgrass Ridge. Until the
Warner Creek Fire, though, the meadows were declining
due to fire exclusion. The elimination of Indian burning and
aggressive suppression policies had both caused the mead-
ows to shrink in size and species diversity. The wildfire
killed many of the dense patches of young firs that were
encroaching upon the meadows, and increased the vitality of
the native bunchgrasses. For these and other reasons, the
news media’s depiction of the Warner Creek Fire as “cata-
strophic” contradicted the ecological effects of the fire.
Warner Fire Recovery Project _____
Two weeks after the Warner Creek Fire was declared out,
the Forest Service initiated the Warner Fire Recovery Project.
The stated purpose and need for the project was to “recover
spotted owl habitat” and “increase knowledge about owl
habitat recovery.” The secondary underlying need—to in-
crease knowledge—later proved vital in legitimizing an
RNA alternative. The Forest Service’s Inter-Disciplinary
Team (IDT) working on the recovery plan originally as-
sumed that the Interagency Scientific Committee’s stan-
dards and guidelines for HCAs would prohibit salvage of any
downed or standing trees (Thomas and others 1990: 325).
Therefore, the IDT determined that the Project provided “an
opportunity to set aside all or a portion of the fire area for
studies of how both natural and managed landscapes re-
spond to large scale fires (USDA-FS 1992: S-5).”
The category of Research Opportunities thus became a
significant issue for analysis in the EIS. The idea of setting
aside the Warner Burn for the study of natural fire recovery
processes was quickly adopted by the public, including
members of a special citizen advisory group organized by the
Willamette National Forest to give regular input on the
Recovery Project. A majority of the Warner Public Participa-
tion Group formally requested that a new alternative be
created that would designate the burn as a Research Natu-
ral Area (RNA), and develop a new fire management plan
that allowed prescribed natural fires (PNFs). Unfortunately,
the Willamette National Forest declared that both RNAs
and fire planning were issues “outside the scope of the
project,” and excluded these from the Draft EIS.
Not satisfied with that decision, the citizen advisory group
networked with fire scientists and forest ecologists from
across the Pacific Northwest to develop their own proposal
for an RNA-based fire recovery plan, and submitted this
during the public comment period. The proposal was called
“Alternative EF: Ecology of Fire.” Later, when the
Willamette’s Draft Preferred Alternative was withdrawn by
the Forest Service’s Owl Oversight Committee because it
was deemed inconsistent with the agency’s owl conservation
strategy, Alternative Ecology of Fire was authorized to be
fully developed, analyzed, and published in the Final EIS.
This set in motion a truly collaborative effort of agency
specialists, conservationists, academics and independent
researchers to further develop the concept of a Fire Process
RNA for the Warner Burn.
Alternative EF: Ecology of Fire ____
The goal of the authors of Alternative EF (Alt. EF) was to
propose a recovery strategy that centered around research
and restoration of wildland fire processes. Alt. EF proposed
allowing natural succession processes to recover owl habi-
tat, and a fire management strategy using PNFs to help
protect owl habitat from future severe wildfires. The entire
burn was divided into four zones for PNF prescriptions that
ranged from low to moderate intensity in the zone contain-
ing spotted owl nest sites, and higher intensity in the
ridgetop meadow zone. Along with PNFs, an active program
of fire effects monitoring and research was proposed in
order to study both natural fire disturbance and recovery
processes.
Alt. EF prioritized PNFs, but also allowed some manage-
ment-ignited prescribed fires, especially in the ridgetop
meadow zone. Such fires could occur only after intensive fire
history research was completed that included anthropologi-
cal research on the frequency, locations, and methods of
historic Native American burning along Bunchgrass Ridge.
In a move that preceded the Federal Wildland Fire Manage-
ment Policy and its concept of “Appropriate Management
Response,” Alt. EF allowed limited and modified suppres-
sion activities to occur in order to keep natural fires within
their prescription. In the event that some fires exceeded
their prescribed fire intensity, Alt. EF mandated that only
minimal-impact suppression tactics (MIST) could be used
within the burn. The concern was that aggressive suppres-
sion actions would not only damage the environment, but
might destroy ongoing research projects and monitoring
plots.

Fire Process Research Natural Areas: Managing Research and Restoration of Dynamic Ecosystem Processes
Rationale for Prescribed Underburning in
Spotted Owl Stands
The project’s decisionmaker and IDT believed that both
prescribed and wildland fires would adversely affect owl
nesting and roosting habitat. However, unbeknownst to the
authors of Alt. EF at that time, the fire and fuels manage-
ment team working on the California Spotted Owl conserva-
tion plan (a.k.a. the “CASPO” Report) urged that prescribed
underburning be used to prevent stand-replacing wildfires
in spotted owl Protected Activity Centers (Verner and others
1992: 254). Proponents of Alt. EF argued that, logically,
spotted owls evolved with natural succession processes and
recurring fire disturbances, and observed that most existing
owl stands exhibit some evidence of past fires. Proponents
added that fires are a prime agent creating forest structure
such as multi-storied canopies and large snags and logs that
were vital components of superior spotted owl habitat.
Furthermore, RNA proponents rejected the agency’s strat-
egy of protecting owl habitat reserves with fire exclusion—
a policy that had already essentially been “vetoed” by the
arsonists who ignited the Warner Creek Fire. Conservation-
ists took comfort in the fact that the resident population of
spotted owls continued to inhabit and successfully repro-
duce in the burn. Indeed, the continued existence of the owls
inside the burn challenged the assumption that intensive
management, especially salvage logging, was necessary to
recover the burned area.
Alt. EF was endorsed by prestigious academic members of
the research community, including some of the scientists
who helped design the Northwest Forest Plan. The student
governments of Oregon’s two largest universities passed
official resolutions in support of Alt. EF and later sent these
to Forest Service Chief, Jack Ward Thomas. Then, the
Forest Service’s Regional RNA Coordinator and ecologists
from the Pacific Northwest Research Station drafted their
own RNA proposal for the Warner Burn. Finally, the Oregon
Natural Heritage Advisory Board used the Warner Creek
Fire and Alt. EF as inspiration to establish a new “Fire
Process” cell for their network of RNAs. This created a
qualitatively new kind of RNA aimed to protect areas for
their dynamic ecosystem processes rather than static spe-
cies composition or geologic features. Consequently, al-
though the Willamette National Forest’s final recovery plan
was to construct fuelbreaks with salvage clearcuts, the
decisionmaker also set aside a 4,200 acre portion of the burn
as a “Natural Succession Area” (NSA) to be later considered
for designation as an RNA.
Warner Fire Recovery Plan Voided
Implementation of the Willamette National Forest’s final
recovery plan was repeatedly delayed first by a dozen admin-
istrative appeals and then by a lawsuit that resulted in a
permanent injunction against the salvage sale. All of these
delays occurred during a time of rapid change in forest and
fire management policies initiated by the Northwest Forest
Plan and the Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy and
Program Review. In the midst of a nationwide protest
campaign whose slogan was “Stop the Warner Salvage Sale;
Save the RNA!” President Clinton ordered the timber sale to
be withdrawn in August 1996. No salvage logging ever
occurred inside the Warner burn, and the Willamette Na-
tional Forest essentially selected the No Action Alternative
by default.
Warner Fire Process RNA
Proposal _______________________
The group of “citizen-scientists” who had drafted Alt. EF
developed a new, more expansive RNA proposal, and sub-
mitted it to the Regional RNA coordinator in September
1997. Called the “Warner Proposal” for the sake of brevity,
it was no longer confined to the 9,000 acre wildfire perim-
eter. New boundaries were drawn along suitable topographic
features and landforms that would aid minimal-impact fire
confinement strategies and minimize the need for aggres-
sive suppression.
Using Conservation Biology principles, the Warner Pro-
posal linked the burn with a cluster of four other Inventoried
Roadless Areas (RAs). These RAs, in turn, were adjacent to
two contiguous Wilderness Areas along the Cascade Crest
that had recently developed PNF plans. The original pro-
posal was a 48,000 acre RNA, but this has recently been
reduced to approximately 31,000 acres in accordance with
the results of a 1999 symposium on Fire Process RNAs. The
31,000 acre Warner RNA connected with 336,000 acres of
designated Wilderness would form a landbase where it is
hoped that large-scale wildland fire processes could be
managed for research and restoration purposes.
The core of the Warner Proposal includes the entire 9,000
acre Warner Burn. This is one of the rarest landscapes in the
westside Oregon Cascades: a roadless, mid-elevation, rela-
tively unmanaged, recently burned forest containing both
young natural stands and high-mortality old-growth stands.
A wide range of disturbance intensities, plant associations,
and stand conditions currently exist. Early and late seral
stages following large-scale fire disturbances are not ad-
equately represented within existing RNAs. Thus, the Warner
Burn has the potential to capture early seral stages of plant
communities protected in other RNAs. The Warner Burn
presents opportunities to study not only single elements or
communities encompassed within it, but also the complex
array of fire intensities and communities, their arrange-
ment, connections, and interrelationships through time.
The relatively large area and diversity of topography, veg-
etation, microclimates, habitats, and fire effects make the
Warner Burn and its surrounding unburned area well suited
for a broad range of research and educational uses.
Agency Responses to the Citizens’
Warner RNA Proposal
The Willamette National Forest responded to the Warner
Proposal by resurrecting the decisionmaker’s 4,200 acre
NSA proposal minus the fuelbreaks and salvage clearcuts.
However, during the public scoping period the agency re-
ceived over 1,000 comment letters and every single letter
rejected the NSA proposal. The chief criticism was that the
NSA was too small and its boundaries too arbitrary to allow
wildland fire use. Instead, the letters demanded that the

Ingalsbee
citizen-scientists’ Warner RNA Proposal be included in the
EIS process.
The results of the scoping period prompted the Willamette
National Forest and the Pacific Northwest Research Station
to host a roundtable workshop of fire scientists in April 1999.
The assembled scientists from Oregon, Washington, and
British Columbia discussed design and management crite-
ria for Fire Process RNAs. The scientists agreed that land-
scape-scale RNAs were needed in order to best capture
natural fire processes at the spatial and temporal scales they
function in the westside Oregon Cascades. The scientists
determined that for a mid-sized Fire Process RNA, approxi-
mately 30,000 acres containing portions of at least two
watersheds would be needed to maximize research opportu-
nities. The end result of the symposium was that the scien-
tists validated the general principles articulated in both Alt.
EF and the new Warner Proposal.
Ongoing Activities to Learn From
the Burn _______________________
Despite the lack of formal RNA status, the Warner Burn
has attracted fire ecology research and educational activi-
ties throughout the last decade. For example, 45 monitoring
plots have been established by Forest Service ecologists in
order to document the early structure, composition, and
regeneration of the burn. If future Forest Service budgets
allow, these plots will be resurveyed as part of a long-term
monitoring plan. Scientists from the University of Oregon
and Oregon State University have also conducted some
studies on soils, vegetation, and wildlife in the burn.
The Cascadia Fire Ecology Education Project (CFEEP), a
nonprofit conservation organization, and the Northwest
Youth Corps (NYC), an alternative high school for at-risk
youth interested in pursuing forestry careers, have em-
barked on a partnership to establish long-term fire effects
monitoring plots. CFEEP and NYC have initiated a unique
snag longevity study to monitor the rate of fall and decay of
fire-killed snags and logs over the next several decades. The
methodology for the snag study was developed with the help
of Forest Service ecologists and sustainable forestry consult-
ant, Chris Maser. (Known as one of the early “gurus of old-
growth” while he was a Bureau of Land Management ecolo-
gist stationed at the Pacific Northwest Research Station,
Maser was the lead author of the 1988 publication, “From
the Forest to the Sea: A Story of Fallen Trees” (Gen. Tech.
Report PNW-GTR-229)). The nonprofit groups are now ap-
plying the National Park Service fire effects monitoring
protocol to their current and future research plots in the
burn.
Additionally, students from all across the country have
attended special fire ecology field seminars and research
outings in the Warner burn as part of curriculum for the
Wildland Studies Program and the Cascade Science School.
The Warner burn is conveniently located next to a major
highway just one hour’s drive from the city of Eugene,
Oregon. Educators from local universities and school dis-
tricts are becoming some of the more vocal advocates of the
Warner Proposal because it has great potential as an out-
door education site and living laboratory for academic re-
search projects. This fulfills one of the oft-neglected purposes
of RNAs to foster education, as well as conduct research and
conserve biodiversity (USDA-FS 1997: 2). Accordingly, it is
hoped that formal protective status as an RNA would enable
future generations of scientists and students continual op-
portunities to “learn from the burn.”
Controversies and Challenges of
Managing Fire Process RNAs _____
RNA proponents are urging the Willamette National
Forest to proceed with the EIS process and include a citizen-
scientist RNA Alternative in the document. This effort
conforms with the recent Committee of Scientists’ Report
that encouraged more up-front collaboration with scientists
in Forest Service planning and projects (Committee of Scien-
tists 1999: xxv). The Federal Wildland Fire Management
Policy and Program Review also lauded the role of commu-
nication and collaboration, and has called for a renewed
emphasis on public participation and partnerships in all
aspects of wildland fire management (USDA/USDI  1995:
iii). If and when the Willamette National Forest moves
forward on the proposal, the fire research community will
want to review and submit substantive comments on the
EIS. The document will likely raise several critically impor-
tant, controversial issues that are pertinent to other fire/
fuels management programs and projects. With active par-
ticipation of the fire research community, RNA proponents
hope that the Willamette National Forest will produce a
model fire management plan focused on research and resto-
ration of wildland fire processes. This should develop a
template to help propose and establish additional fire pro-
cess RNAs in other regions of the National Forest System,
especially in the Southwest.
Socioeconomic Issues
An RNA designation would preclude intensive manage-
ment and commodity resource extraction activities. Accord-
ingly, persuading the citizenry that some large acreage of
commercially-valuable timber lands should be set aside for
the so-called “wrath of wildfire” will present a public rela-
tions challenge, to say the least. The specific Warner RNA
proposal largely mitigates this issue by incorporating lands
such as LSRs and RAs that make future commercial timber
extraction problematic. Timber sales will be even more
unlikely if President Clinton’s Roadless Area Protection
Initiative results in protection of RAs from further logging as
well as road-building. Yet, the only commercial logging that
would have been affected within the 31,000 acre Warner
RNA Proposal was the Helldun timber sale, located just
outside the burn perimeter. This timber sale was withdrawn
in spring 2000, due to widespread public opposition to its
potential adverse effects on the RNA proposal.
Research and Restoration Jobs-in-the-Woods—Too
often land managers consider RNAs to be strict land “set-
asides” or “lock-ups” that only benefit researchers; how-
ever, there are a number of potential socioeconomic benefits
that could accrue from a large-scale RNA (Tyrrell, n.d.: 6).
Just in terms of research jobs there could be substantial
opportunities for workers needed to establish research plots,

Fire Process Research Natural Areas: Managing Research and Restoration of Dynamic Ecosystem Processes
conduct field surveys, collect baseline data, initiate research
projects, construct trails, and monitor wildland and pre-
scribed fires. Restoration could include jobs for road oblit-
eration, in-stream rehabilitation, invasive weed eradica-
tion, and hazardous fuels reduction with manual and
prescribed fire treatments. Of course, these research and
restoration jobs would have to be funded by alternative
sources such as Federal appropriations, grants, endow-
ments, and so forth rather than traditional commodity-
producing projects. But given a suitable funding source, the
number and kinds of research/restoration jobs and other
socioeconomic benefits that could accrue from a fire process
RNA over the next century or more is limited only by one’s
imagination.
Additionally, some have raised the idea of possibly allow-
ing limited commercial extraction in special buffer zones
that would straddle the RNA’s boundaries. Thus, for ex-
ample, a fuels management program to reduce hazardous
fuels and construct defensible boundaries might allow ex-
traction of some of the understory trees and dead surface
fuels to supply a commercial firewood operation. Other
commercial enterprises, such as mushroom harvesting, might
also be permitted in these buffer zones along the RNA
boundaries. Providing jobs, resources, and other socioeco-
nomic benefits in these buffer zones might make the RNA
proposal more attractive to certain sectors of the public and
political representatives; however, these would have to be
subordinated to the overriding goal of protecting the RNA
from adverse edge effects that could potentially be caused by
commercial activities.
Scientific Controversies
There are genuine unresolved questions and controver-
sies over the relationship of northern spotted owls, “west-
side” old-growth forests, and wildland fires. These unknowns
became the very impetus and driving rationale for the RNA
alternative in the Warner Fire Recovery Project. It is prob-
ably a safe assumption that a fire process RNA will entail
some degree of extra risk of potential loss of some compo-
nents of owl habitat. However, it is hypothesized that given
sufficient time, natural regeneration and succession pro-
cesses can and will recover burned sites from the effects of
fire disturbances. Given the long fire return intervals, and
the long period required to develop superior spotted owl
nesting habitat, the testing of this hypothesis might not
come for several decades, even centuries. This is an argu-
ment in favor of RNA status that would provide long-term
protection against intrusive or intensive management that
would alter the natural processes and potentially invalidate
the data.
Role of Early Seral/Successional Stages in Old-
Growth Development—In the dominant mode of man-
aged “recovery” and “reforestation,” Forest Service manag-
ers typically prefer to skip early successional stages following
fire or logging disturbances and plant nursery-bred conifers.
However, it remains a mystery whether or not fire distur-
bances and early successional stages are necessary elements
of long-term old-growth development. For example, recur-
ring fires could stimulate pulsed regeneration and self-
pruning mechanisms of trees that help develop all-aged,
multistoried canopy structures that are preferred by north-
ern spotted owls. Likewise, it is recognized that fires are a
prime disturbance agent creating large-diameter snags and
logs that are vital habitat structures to owls and their prey.
An RNA could help reveal how natural fire disturbance and
recovery processes function over the long-term, and serve as
a control area to compare with managed areas undergoing
quasi-experimental silvicultural treatments.
Presence of Past Management Impacts in an RNA—
Another controversial issue concerns the presence of past
management impacts inside a new RNA. Inside the Warner
burn alone, there are 77 miles of logging roads and 28
plantations whose dense stands of young artificial regenera-
tion were destroyed by the wildfire. These plantations caused
fire severity to increase as ember-filled convection columns
preheated and ignited the canopies of adjacent old-growth
stands. Logging roads and plantations are not suitable for an
“elemental” RNA designation, but for a “process” RNA the
story is different. It should be assumed that fire behavior
and effects will differ in managed versus unmanaged stands;
however, it is hypothesized that fire disturbance processes
would continue to function naturally on a landscape scale.
In regions such as the Pacific Northwest, it is difficult to
find large expanses of intact wildlands that had escaped the
Forest Service’s road-building and logging program of the
1970s and 1980s. This program had specifically targeted
RAs for development. Realizing this fact, the Oregon Natu-
ral Heritage Advisory Board came up with the criteria that
up to 10 percent of the area of a fire process RNA could
contain previously managed sites and still be deemed “natu-
ral” enough for RNA designation. The important factor is
that the remaining 90 percent of an RNA should be natural,
with predominantly native species composition, and lacking
evidence of significant management-caused alteration.
Given the extent of forest fragmentation and ecosystem
alteration from past intensive management activities, the
most likely location containing the quantity and quality of
natural areas suitable for fire process RNAs would be found
in Roadless Areas. As occurred with the Warner proposal,
Fire Process RNAs of the future will likely be proposed
“opportunistically” following a wildland fire in an RA. This
provides a baseline fire event to study, and prompts signifi-
cant public interest that could support (or possibly oppose)
RNA designation. However, in the frequent fire regimes of
the Southwest, some visionaries might take the initiative to
propose some RAs for RNA status in anticipation of a future
fire event. This prefire proactive planning would provide a
much-needed antidote to the current system of “emergency”
wildfire suppression followed by “emergency” salvage logging.
Management Conflicts
Other issues that have been raised during the develop-
ment of the Warner RNA proposal revolve around managing
the RNA for research, education, and conservation of biologi-
cal diversity, but also mixing these with “multiple uses” such
as recreation. RNA proponents have argued for essentially
a “passive” restoration strategy focused on PNFs to restore
the fire regime. But a more “active” restoration strategy
utilizing management-ignited prescribed fires could also be
used as means of restoring and maintaining biodiversity.

Questions arise as to whether these prescribed fires could be
considered suitable research activities, as well as mainte-
nance tools, in the RNA.
Prescribed Fire as a Research Subject and Restora-
tion Tool—Fire history research to date suggests that the
frequency of natural ignitions may not be sufficient to
restore the natural fire regime of the Warner area given
nearly a century of fire exclusion and the elimination of
historic Native American burning. Although there are strong
advocates for wildland and prescribed fire use in RNAs
specifically to maintain ecological processes, most forest
managers have opted for a “hands off” approach to fire
management (Johnson 1983: 39). Unfortunately, out of 79
established RNAs that are comprised of fire-dependent
plant communities, only five of these RNAs undergo pre-
scribed burning; the rest are declining in species, structural,
and seral diversity due to fire exclusion (Greene and Evenden
1995: 32). Fortunately, one of these RNAs receiving periodic
prescribed burning is located approximately 60 miles from
the Warner burn in an eastside Cascade ecosystem on the
Deschutes National Forest. In the Metolius RNA, scheduled
prescribed burns are conducted as part of a long-term moni-
toring program serving both restoration and research objec-
tives (Riegel and Youngblood 1999). The Metolius RNA
prescribed burning program offers a working model for
Willamette managers to apply to a fire process RNA in the
Warner burn.
Potential Recreation Impacts on Research Projects—
During the development of Alt. EF, a conflict arose within
the research community over the belief by some scientists
that recreational activities were inappropriate uses for the
RNA. Some scientists opposed the construction of a fire
ecology interpretive trail out of fear that off-trail hikers
would unwittingly trample upon research plots, or vandals
would deliberately destroy research sites and equipment.
The Warner Proposal, however, includes sufficient acreage
that the potential risk of a catastrophic loss of research plots
should be minimized. And protection of research sites should
be a prominent theme for interpretive and educational
programs. National Parks must frequently grapple with the
dilemma of providing for “recreational playgrounds and
natural area preservation”; hence, National Park Service
employees may want to lend some expert advice to the Forest
Service on how to manage for these seemingly contradictory
uses of the Warner RNA.
Systemic Lack of Funding of RNA Program—A per-
plexing issue concerns the current general lack of funding
for the RNA program in the Pacific Northwest Region
(Greene 1999: 3). The Willamette Supervisor cited “a climate
of dramatically reduced budgets for RNAs” as one of the
reasons for refusing to proceed with an EIS for the Warner
proposal. Indeed, more demands are being placed on Forest
Service researchers with less staffing and budgets available.
However, the example of the privately-funded CFEEP-NYC
research program demonstrates that the Federal govern-
ment could tap into local community labor resources to get
some of the “grunt work” of baseline data collection and field
research projects started. Managers are thus being urged
not to restrict themselves to their agency’s internal re-
sources of budgets, staff, and expertise, but to look to
forming collaborative partnerships with the research and
conservation communities to supplement limited Federal
resources.
Lack of an Approved Fire Management Plan Con-
tinues Commitment to Fire Exclusion—Perhaps the
most frustrating issue that affects the viability of the Warner
proposal is the fact that the Willamette National Forest
lacks an approved Fire Management Plan. The Willamette
National Forest’s current Land and Resource Management
Plan as amended by the Northwest Forest Plan does not
provide for wildland fire use, and commits to total, aggres-
sive suppression in Late-Successional Reserves (LSRs).
Approximately 15,000 acres or 48 percent of the citizens’
proposal is currently managed as a LSR, and Willamette
National Forest managers have raised the specter of “unfet-
tered wildfires” in the RNA potentially destroying the habi-
tat values of the LSR.
The concept of wildland fire use burning under planned
prescription is key to agency and public acceptance. If and
when a natural or management-ignited fire exceeds its pre-
planned prescription window, then it would be converted to
a wildfire and suppressed. RNA proponents are clear about
their wider policy objectives in establishing the Warner Fire
Process RNA: it is intended to serve as a kind of testing
ground for changing fire management policies and practices
in the Pacific Northwest. It is hoped that the Warner RNA
will provide a safe space far away from private property or
human communities where not only can people learn from
the burn, but can learn to live with fire as a vital ecosystem
process.
Conclusion_____________________
At the time of this writing (September 2000) the current
status and future fate of the Warner Fire Process RNA
proposal is uncertain. On the one hand, Forest Service
officials claim that their budget does not have enough money
to fund an EIS for the RNA. On the other hand, the Warner
Proposal continues to generate growing interest and en-
dorsements from scientists, researchers, educators, and
resource specialists in the Forest Service and other land
management agencies.
With support from the Oregon Governor’s office, Con-
gressman Peter DeFazio has submitted a funding request
for the EIS in the 2001 Appropriations Bill in order to
provide the Willamette National Forest with the money
needed to do the analysis and establish the RNA. Congress
is gaining more interest in fire research and fuels manage-
ment, as evidenced by its continuing funding of the Joint
Fire Sciences Program, the Hazardous Fuels Reduction
Program, and proposed massive budget increases for Fed-
eral fire management programs in the 2001 Interior Appro-
priations bill. There is also a growing effort by researchers
and conservationists familiar with the Warner Proposal to
develop citizen-initiated Fire Process RNA proposals in
other locations around the West. Proponents argue that the
Warner Proposal and Fire Process RNAs are ideas whose
time has come, and look forward to inspiring the public, fire
professionals, and political representatives on the critical
need for fire ecology research and education to guide ecosys-
tem restoration programs in fire-dependent/fire-adapted
ecosystems.

Six-Year Changes in Mortality and Crown
Condition of Old-Growth Ponderosa Pines
in Ecological Restoration Treatments at the
G. A. Pearson Natural Area

Abstract—Ecological restoration treatments using thinning and
prescribed burning have been proposed to reverse the decline of old-
growth ponderosa pines in the Southwest. However, long-term data
on the effectiveness of such treatments are lacking. In 1993–1994,
two ecological restoration treatments and a control were estab-
lished at the G. A. Pearson Natural Area (GPNA) near Flagstaff, AZ.
The thinned treatment removed many postsettlement-aged trees
to create tree density and stand structure similar to pre-Euro-
American forests. The thinned + burned treatment included pre-
scribed burning of the forest floor in combination with this thinning.
The control was a dense stand of pre- and postsettlement trees with
no thinning or burning. Crown dieback of presettlement trees
decreased by about 3 percent in both thinned treatments over
6 years since initiation of treatments, whereas dieback increased by
about 4 percent in the control. Crown dieback was not related to tree
age. Change in height of presettlement trees between 1994 and 2000
did not differ among treatments. Of 146 presettlement trees moni-
tored for survival between 1994 and 2000, four died between 1997
and 2000, and all were in thinned treatments. Two of the four trees
that died toppled or the stem broke in a severe windstorm in 1997.
The other two dead trees died between 1997 and 2000 following the
severe regionwide drought of 1996. These two dead trees had large
amounts of canopy dieback prior to treatment initiation, suggesting
that thinning did not contribute to their mortality. Our results
indicate that heavy thinning of postsettlement trees improved the
crown condition of presettlement trees at the GPNA over 6 years
since treatment, but also may have increased windthrow and wind
breakage.
Introduction ____________________
Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in northern
Arizona have changed dramatically in stand structure over
the past century due to human alteration of the natural fire
regime, overgrazing, and logging (Arnold 1950; Cooper 1960;
White 1985; Covington and Moore 1994; Fulé and others
1997). In most areas of northern Arizona, fires have been
suppressed for at least 87 years (Madany and West 1983;
Savage and Swetnam 1990). Pre-Euro-American settlement
forests were characterized by clusters of old pines separated
by lush grassy areas. These open canopy conditions were
maintained by low-intensity surface fires that occurred
every 2–12 years (Weaver 1951; Cooper 1960; Dieterich
1980; Dieterich and Swetnam 1984; Swetnam and Baisan
1996). The present forests are currently dominated by dense
thickets of sapling- and pole-sized trees and have heavy
accumulations of litter and woody fuels, and poor under-
story grass, forb, and shrub growth (Cooper 1960; Harrington
and Sackett 1992; Covington and Moore 1994; Dahms and
Geils 1997).
There is currently much interest in improving the condi-
tion of Southwestern ponderosa pine forests by thinning to
reduce competition among trees and by prescribed burning
to reduce fuel loads. However, few studies have examined
the effects of such thinning and burning treatments on
presettlement ponderosa pines. Studies of historical tree
growth rates of presettlement ponderosa pines in northern
Arizona have suggested that the remaining presettle-
ment trees are declining because of competition from
postsettlement trees (Sutherland 1983; Biondi 1996). Two
studies have reported negative effects of prescribed burning
on the growth, water relations, and survival of presettle-
ment trees (Sutherland and others 1991; Swezy and Agee
1991). In both studies, the burns were conducted in stands
containing heavy fuel loads due to fire suppression, causing
heat damage to the presettlement trees.
We initiated a study in 1993 designed to evaluate tech-
niques for improving the condition of ponderosa pine forests
in the Gus Pearson Natural Area (GPNA) in northern
Arizona (Covington and others 1997). The GPNA is a unique,
relict stand of presettlement ponderosa pines that has been
protected from harvesting and heavy grazing. The treat-
ments included thinning of postsettlement trees to create a
more open stand condition, and a combination of thinning
and prescribed burning. The influence of these treatments
on the growth, water, carbon, and nutrient relations of
presettlement trees have been reported by Stone and others
(1999) for the first year following treatment, and by Feeney

Six-Year Changes in Mortality and Crown Condition of Old-Growth Ponderosa Pines…
and others (1998) for the second and third years following
treatment. These authors concluded that thinning increased
uptake of water and nitrogen of presettlement trees, and
these changes contributed to greater rates of photosynthesis
and stem radial growth. Differences in growth and physi-
ological characteristics between the thinned treatment and
the thinned + burned treatment were small, except for tree
resin flow, which was higher in the thinned + burned treat-
ment than in the thinned treatment (Feeney and others
1998).
In this paper, we compare mortality and crown condition
of presettlement trees 6 years after initiation of the restora-
tion treatments at the GPNA. Measurements of these char-
acteristics made in 1994 are compared to measurements
made in 2000 to show temporal changes in each treatment
area. Our general hypothesis is that the positive effects of
the thinning and thinning + burning treatments on preset-
tlement tree condition that were documented for the first
3 years after the initiation of treatments (Feeney and others
1998; Stone and others 1999) would continue through
year 6. Specifically, we expected lower tree mortality and a
greater improvement in crown condition in thinned and
thinned + burned treatments compared with the unthinned
and unburned control.
Methods _______________________
Study site
The study was conducted at the GPNA, within the Coconino
National Forest approximately 10 km northwest of Flag-
staff, Arizona. The study site occupies 3 ha of the 30-ha
GPNA at an elevation of 2,195–2,255 m. Aspect is generally
southwest, with gentle topography (slopes 0–5 percent).
Soils, derived from basalt and volcanic cinders, are classified
as a Brolliar stony clay loam, fine, smectitic, Typic Argiboroll.
Mean annual precipitation in Flagstaff is 56.7 cm, with
approximately one-half of the precipitation falling as snow
from November to May and one-half falling as rain primarily
during the late-summer monsoon season (July and August).
Mean annual air temperature in Flagstaff is 7.5 ∞C. The
climate is subhumid, with early summer droughts common.
The average frost-free growing season is 94 days (Schubert
1974).
The vegetation community at the GPNA is a previously
unharvested ponderosa pine stand that is uneven-aged with
even-aged groups of pole-sized trees and uneven-aged groups
of presettlement trees (Schubert 1974; White 1985). Pole-
sized trees (10–37.4 cm d.b.h.) are the predominant size
class. The predominant Euro-American influences at the
GPNA have been livestock grazing, which occurred between
1876 and 1910, and fire suppression. The last natural fire
was in 1876; prior to that time, the fire return interval
averaged approximately 2 years (Dieterich 1980).
Experimental Design and Treatments
The GPNA study site was subdivided into three largely
contiguous areas, each occupying approximately 1 ha
(Covington and others 1997). Each area was subjected to one
of three treatments: control, thinned, and thinned + burned.
Each treatment area was further subdivided into five ap-
proximately 0.20-ha plots that served as experimental units.
We grouped these plots into five blocks (one plot per treat-
ment) that were used to implement all measurements.
Because our experimental design does not include true
spatial replication across the landscape, we used precau-
tions to strengthen our inferences regarding treatment
effects. Specifically, an earlier analysis (Stone 1997) showed
similar pretreatment levels of soil total nitrogen (P = 0.19),
phosphorus (P = 0.25), organic matter (P = 0.19), predawn
leaf water potential (P = 0.82 for May to June, P = 0.25 for
July to August), basal area growth rate (P = 0.96), stem
diameter (P = 0.32), and tree-to-tree competition index (P =
0.66) of presettlement trees among the areas to be treated.
Thus, resource availability, tree growth, and tree physiologi-
cal condition were similar among areas prior to treatment.
Second, our interpretation of statistical results applies only
to the specific locations in the GPNA where the treatments
were applied.
The thinning was conducted to simulate the presettle-
ment (circa 1876) stand structure, which was determined
using dendrochronological techniques (Mast and others 1999).
The average pretreatment basal area was 34.5 m2 ha-1
(average of 3,100 trees ha-1), which was retained in the
control area. In November of 1993, two-thirds of the site was
thinned to an average basal area of 13.0 m2 ha-1 (average of
151 trees ha-1), with all presettlement trees and all trees
greater than 40 cm d.b.h. retained. Following the thinning
treatment, the unthinned control area had an average d.b.h.
of 16.6 cm in 1993, while both thinned areas had an average
d.b.h. of 40.9 cm (Covington and others 1997). Thinning did
not substantially change light availability to the preset-
tlement trees used in the study because the crowns of the
thinned postsettlement trees were lower than the crowns of
the presettlement trees.
Half of the thinned area was also subjected to a low-
intensity prescribed burn in 1994 (October) and 1998 (Octo-
ber). Prior to the first burn in 1994, the Oi (slightly decom-
posed organic matter), Oe (moderately decomposed organic
matter), and Oa (highly decomposed organic matter) layers
of the forest floor and woody debris were removed by hand
raking to simulate presettlement forest floor conditions,
which would have had little forest floor litter and debris
because of frequent fire. The Oi layer (2–4 years of litterfall)
was replaced prior to burning with dried native grass foliage
from a nearby prairie (672 kg ha-1 dry biomass) to simulate
presettlement forest floor conditions in which grasses were
dominant. Fire characteristics for the 1994 burn were previ-
ously reported by Covington and others (1997); flame length
averaged about 15 cm with maximum lengths of 60 cm. For
the second burn in 1998, flame length averaged 11 cm with
maximum lengths of 180–240 cm that occurred in fallen
limbs and needles of windthrown trees.
Crown Dieback and Mortality
We measured crown dieback of 71 presettlement trees in
July 1994 and March 2000. Of these trees, 27 were in control
plots, 22 were in thinned plots, and 22 were in thinned +
burned plots. These trees were selected for measurement in
1994 because all had good crown condition with little dieback

prior to initiation of the treatments and were located at least
10 m from treatment boundaries, which reduced potential
influences from other treatments. Crown dieback of each
tree was visually assessed by at least three trained observ-
ers using a system with 12 percentage classes (table 1)
developed for forest health monitoring (Millers and others
1991; Kolb and McCormick 1993). The same leader (T. E.
Kolb) trained assessment crews in both 1994 and 2000, and
he checked the crown condition assessment of all trees in
both years for accuracy. Crown dieback was defined as the
percentage of total crown volume that contained dead
branches with bark or with branch tips less than 2.5 cm
diameter (Millers and others 1991). We also measured the
height of all trees with a clinometer at the time of crown
dieback assessment in both years. Tree mortality status
(live or dead) was noted in 1994, 1996, and 2000 on a total of
146 presettlement trees that consisted of the same 71 trees
measured for crown dieback and an additional 75 trees.
Data Analysis
We compared differences in crown dieback and height
growth among the control, thinned, and thinned + burned
areas of the GPNA using a fixed-effects analysis of variance
(ANOVA) on plot means. Mean comparisons among treat-
ments were performed with Fisher’s protected LSD, and a
threshold P value of 0.10 was used in all tests because of the
inherent large variability of a population of old trees. All
statistical analyses were conducted using the SAS JMP
statistical package (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, U.S.A.).
Only trees that were living in both 1994 and 2000 were
included in the analysis of crown dieback.
Results ________________________
Crown Dieback
Crown dieback of presettlement trees differed signifi-
cantly (P = 0.073) among treatment areas in 1994 when
treatments were initiated. Dieback was significantly greater
in the thinned treatment (mean = 19.0 percent) compared
with the thinned + burned treatment (mean = 12.4 percent)
(fig. 1). Dieback did not differ significantly between the
control (mean = 14.0 percent) and either thinned treatment
in 1994 (fig. 1).
Crown dieback also differed significantly (P = 0.037)
among treatments in 2000, 6 years after the initiation of
treatments. In contrast to the results in 1994, dieback was
greatest in the control (mean = 18.0 percent), intermediate
in the thinned treatment (mean = 14.3 percent), and lowest
in the thinned + burned treatment (mean = 10.4 percent)
(fig. 2). The difference in dieback between 1994 and 2000 was

caused by a difference among treatments in temporal change
in crown condition. In the control, crown dieback increased
between 1994 and 2000 by an average of 3.5 percent, whereas
crown dieback decreased during this period in the thinned
(–3.9 percent) and thinned + burned (–2.5 percent) treat-
ments (fig. 3). This difference in temporal change in dieback
between the control and thinned treatments was significant
(P = 0.037).
There was no relationship between tree age and 2000
crown dieback (R = 0.153, P = 0.284) or 1994–2000 change in
dieback (R = 0.103, P = 0.473) for data pooled over all
treatments (figs. 4 and 5). Correlations between these vari-
ables were also not significant for data analyzed by treat-
ment group, except for 2000 crown dieback in the thinned +
burned treatment which was positively associated with tree
age (R = 0.466, P = 0.059) (fig. 4).
Change in Tree Height
Tree height growth, expressed as a percentage change
between 1994 and 2000, was highest in the thinned + burned
treatment (15.8 percent), intermediate in the thinned treat-
ment (14.7 percent), and lowest in the control (12.8 percent),
but these differences were not significant (P = 0.411) (fig. 6).
Tree Mortality
There was no mortality of the 146 trees between 1994 and
1996. However, four trees died between 1997 and 2000. Of
these dead trees, all were located in thinned or thinned +
burned plots. In thinned plots, 1 of 30 trees died. In thinned +
burned plots, 3 of 49 trees died. In control plots, 0 of 67 trees

died. Two of the trees that died in the thinned + burned
treatment broke or toppled in a severe windstorm following
a heavy, wet snow in 1997.
Discussion _____________________
Our results on changes in crown dieback of presettlement
trees over 6 years since initiation of the restoration treat-
ments are consistent with differences in tree radial growth
rate and rates of resource uptake reported by Feeney and
others (1998) and Stone and others (1999) for the first
3 years after treatment initiation. In these studies, thinning
increased uptake of nitrogen and water, stimulated radial
growth, and ameliorated effects of the 1996 drought on tree
growth. Further, most growth and physiological character-
istics were similar in the thinned and thinned + burned
treatments in the first 3 years after the initiation of treat-
ments (Feeney and others 1998). The increase in crown
dieback that occurred between 1994 and 2000 in the control,
coupled with the decrease in dieback in the thinned treat-
ments, suggest that improved resource uptake in the thinned
treatments has influenced carbon allocation to canopy growth
and maintenance processes. We note, however, that these
changes have been small in magnitude, which is not surpris-
ing considering the slow growth rate of old ponderosa pines.
Moreover, the increase in canopy dieback in the control
between 1994 and 2000 indicates a continued slow decline in
the condition of presettlement trees when competition from
postsettlement trees is severe.
Interestingly, both canopy dieback in 2000 and changes in
canopy dieback between 1994 and 2000 were not related to
tree age for ages between 100 and 450 years. This result
suggests that mortality of presettlement-aged ponderosa
pines at the GPNA is more strongly influenced by tree
Figure 6—Average percent change in tree height be-
tween 1994 and 2000 of presettlement ponderosa pines

cantly in Fisher’s Protected LSD tests (P < 0.01).
genotype or local variation in environment and disturbance
rather than tree age alone. We lack a clear understanding of
these factors, but we speculate that lightning strikes, other
disturbances, genetic variation in response to stress, and
perhaps local variation in rooting depth may be important
factors that contribute to canopy dieback at the GPNA.
Our results on tree mortality should be viewed with
caution because of the small number of trees assessed (146
over all treatments) and the small number of trees that died
(four over all treatments). With this caveat, we believe that
the occurrence of tree death by windthrow or wind breakage
exclusively in the thinned treatments is not a coincidence.
Our results suggest that windthrow and wind breakage are
more common for presettlement trees growing in open stands
that result from heavy thinning of postsettlement trees.
Given that severe winter weather with high winds is
common in ponderosa pines forests in northern Arizona,
tree death because of wind breakage and windthrow may
have been a common occurrence in open, savannalike
forests dominated by old-growth trees prior to Euro-Ameri-
can settlement.
Wind damage was not an obvious causal factor in the
death of two of the four presettlement trees that died in the
thinned treatments between 1997 and 2000. One explana-
tion is that thinning contributed to their death. However, we
note that both of these trees had large amounts of dieback
when the treatments were initiated. The tree that died in the
thinned + burned plot was classified as “alive but declining”
with a different crown classification system (Fulé and others
1997) in 1992, prior to initiation of the treatments. The tree
that died in the thinned plot had 40 percent dieback in the
1994 assessment of crown condition. Instead, we speculate
that these trees were already declining because of unknown
factors at the time of treatment initiation, and were subse-
quently severely stressed by the regional 1996 drought in
the Southwest. Further, bark beetle pitch tubes were evi-
dent in 2000 on both trees, suggesting a secondary role of
herbivory in mortality. This interpretation is consistent
with Manion’s (1991) model of tree decline where tree death
is often the result of predisposing and contributing factors
that occurred many years before mortality and acted to
reduce tree carbohydrate levels. Following this sequence of
events, tree defense against biotic agents and capacity to
recover from severe abiotic stress are diminished, and thus
mortality is imminent.
Conclusions____________________
In summary, our results indicate that heavy thinning of
postsettlement trees improved the crown condition of pre-
settlement trees at the GPNA over 6 years since treatment,
but also may have increased windthrow and wind breakage.
The effect of heavy thinning of postsettlement trees on wind
damage to presettlement trees should be addressed in other
ecological restoration experiments in ponderosa pine forests.

Seeding Versus Natural Regeneration: A
Comparison of Vegetation Change Following
Thinning and Burning in Ponderosa Pine

Abstract—The decision whether to seed with native species follow-
ing restoration treatments should be based on existing vegetation,
species present in or absent from the soil seed bank, past manage-
ment history, microclimate conditions and soils. We installed three
permanent monitoring plots in two areas (total 18.6 ha) at Mt.
Trumbull, AZ. Trees were thinned and the sites burned in 1996 and
1997. A 5 ha area was seeded with native shrub, grass and forb
species; the remaining 13.6 ha were unseeded. Pretreatment spe-
cies richness ranged from none to five species per plot. We recorded
13 graminoid and eight shrub species in the seeded area, and four
graminoid and four shrub species in the unseeded area. The greatest
increase in species richness in both seeded and unseeded plots
occurred approximately 1.8 years posttreatment. Perennial native
species dominated plant cover by 2.8 years, although annual native
forbs dominate the soil seed bank. Perennial grasses are nearly
absent from the seed bank. The seeded area had the highest
diversity, but it also had twice as many nonnative species (14 versus
7 in the unseeded plots). By August 1999, maximum species rich-
ness reached 51 species on the seeded plot. Of these species, 80
percent were native. Although seeding increases diversity, it may
also have the long-term tradeoff of introducing new genotypes and
species, both native and nonnative.
Introduction ____________________
Human-induced changes that have impacted herbaceous
forbs, grass and shrub species over approximately the last
150 years in Southwestern ponderosa pine forests have been
attributed primarily to domestic livestock overgrazing, ac-
tive fire suppression, increased ponderosa pine density, and
climate changes (Arnold 1950; Weaver 1951; Cooper 1960;
Covington and Moore 1994; Touchan and others 1995;
Covington and others 1997). Attempts to restore the herba-
ceous and shrub species in Southwestern ponderosa pine
forests are hampered by both ecological and social consider-
ations. The scale of ecological restoration projects in the
Southwest may be on the order of thousands of hectares. In
addition to tree thinning and prescribed burning, restora-
tion of these areas sometimes requires seeding large amounts
of native seed. Seeding with native species poses many
challenges: seed may be prohibitively expensive, unavail-
able in the quantities necessary, or collected from an area
that is geographically or climatologically dissimilar to the
area undergoing restoration. Even if these seeds are avail-
able and applied to a site, seed or seedling mortality may
occur from competition (by both native and nonnative spe-
cies), disease, herbivory, lack of mycorrhizal inoculants,
inclement weather, or unfulfilled germination requirements
or cues. Written historic records and photographs may be
unavailable, further hampering efforts to define past plant
communities and conditions. Other considerations are a
lack of communication between and within government
agencies and other organizations, past management prac-
tices (such as logging and road building), and a lack of
understanding or interest by the general public. Some of
these factors may be corrected or improved in order to
establish vegetation on restored sites. Others cannot be
overcome due to limited resources or permanent landscape
changes and must be considered in order to achieve manage-
ment goals for restoration.
Recent historic herbaceous and shrub species composition
and abundance are largely unknown for Southwestern pon-
derosa pine forests, and thus restoration targets must be
determined without the benefit of this information. Knowl-
edge of historic herbaceous plant communities is limited due
to a reduced capacity for preservation of nonwoody vegeta-
tion in the soil, and limited historical records. A variety of
methods, techniques, and tools have been used to determine
historical species composition and abundance. These meth-
ods and tools include historical records and photographs,
packrat middens, palynology, relict sites (Kaufmann and
others 1994), diaries, surveys, military expeditions (Dick-
Peddie 1993) and opal phytoliths (Fisher and others 1995;
Kerns 1999).
The main objective of this study was to compare a seeded
and an unseeded area to collect material for further data
exploration and generation of hypotheses. This information
can then be used to make seeding decisions in areas of
ponderosa pine forest undergoing ecological restoration.

Seeding Versus Natural Regeneration: A Comparison of Vegetation Change Following Thinning and Burning…
Study Area _____________________
The study area lies within the Grand Canyon–Parashant
National Monument, in northwestern Arizona, between the
Mt. Logan and Mt. Trumbull Wilderness areas and approxi-
mately 95 km southwest of Fredonia, AZ. The study area is
of primarily the ponderosa pine forest type with inter-
mingled patches of New Mexico locust (Robinia neomexicana),
Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii), and big sagebrush (Artemi-
sia tridentata). Precipitation occurs annually in a bimodal
distribution pattern and annual precipitation varies be-
tween 38–64 cm (USDI BLM 1990). Fire scars collected from
individual ponderosa pine trees indicate that fires occurred
every 4 to 6 years prior to Euro-American settlement (Fulé
1997 and unpublished data).
The Southwestern Ecological Restoration Project is a
cooperative study among the Bureau of Land Management,
Northern Arizona University, and the Arizona Game and
Fish Department. The area is managed by the BLM and
encompasses approximately 18,500 ha. Specifically, the data
for this study were collected in two units, one 5.3 ha in size,
which was seeded with a mixture of native grasses, forbs,
and shrubs. The other unit (13.4 ha) was not artificially
seeded and relied on natural regeneration by propagules
already onsite or dispersed onto the site by wind, water,
animals, or some other mechanism. The objective of the
seeding was to increase species richness and diversity and to
decrease soil erosion following ecological restoration treat-
ments of tree thinning and prescribed burning.
Methods and Materials ___________
Modified National Park Service fire monitoring protocols
(NPS 1992) were used for the plot installation and long-term
vegetation monitoring across the entire 18,500 ha project
area. The point line-intercept method was used for vegeta-
tion monitoring. We installed two 50 m transects per plot,
and inventoried these lines every 30 cm for a total of 332
points per plot. Species that were not intercepted by the
transects were recorded within a 5 m belt on either side of the
transects (hereafter referred to as “belt transects”). Three of
these monitoring plots fell within the immediate study area:
one in the seeded unit and two in the unseeded unit.
Although many more plots were established across the
landscape over several years, only data from these three
plots will be discussed in this paper due to the longer period
over which these plots have been monitored and their use as
“demonstration” plots.
We conducted pretreatment inventories in the fall of 1995
in the unit to be seeded and in the spring of 1996 in the
unseeded unit. The area was thinned of postsettlement trees
in the summer of 1996 and burned in the fall of 1996. The 5.3
ha unit was broadcast seeded in December of 1996 and
reseeded the following year using a chain pulled behind an
all terrain vehicle (ATV) to cover seed with soil. Both units
were fenced to exclude cattle, but deer were able to access the
area. The plots were reinventoried in August 1997, 1998 and
1999. Species that were seeded are listed in table 1. The cost
of seeding was estimated to be approximately $214 per acre
(1996 dollars), with additional money spent on reseeding in
1998 ($26 per acre). Seed was certified “weed free,” but
germination testing was not conducted by the authors.
Nomenclature in this paper was adopted from the USDA
Plants Database (2000), Utah Flora (Welsh and others1993),
and Intermountain Flora (Cronquist and others 1972, 1977,
1984, 1989, 1994 and 1997).
Results ________________________
Percent Ground Cover
Percentages of substrates and plant cover are shown in
figure 1. Prior to ecological restoration treatments, 86 per-
cent of the ground cover in the seeded unit consisted of litter
(primarily pine needles), and plant cover was less than 1
percent. In the unseeded unit, litter averaged 47 percent
prior to treatment and fell to 23 percent the year following
ecological restoration treatments. By 1999 (the third year
following treatments), litter had increased to 44 percent in
this unit, while in the seeded unit, litter increased to 24
percent. Plant cover in the unseeded unit rose from 6 percent
(pretreatment) to a high of 50 percent in 1998 due primarily
to the occurrence of early successional annuals and short-
lived perennials, such as lambsquarters (Chenopodium spp.),
spreading groundsmoke (Gayophytum diffusum) and silver
lupine (Lupinus argenteus). Plant cover leveled off in 1999 to
25 percent in this unit. However, in the seeded unit, plant
cover continued to increase in 1999 to 44 percent. Soil cover
dramatically increased in the seeded unit following treat-
ments: 5 percent pretreatment and 58 percent in 1997. It has
continued to decrease in both units as other types of cover
begin to predominate.
Species Composition
The only two plant families represented in the seeded unit
in 1997, the first year following restoration treatments, were
the Chenopodiaceae (goosefoot family) and the Poaceae
(grass family) (table 2). In 1998, 11 families were repre-
sented. The Chenopodiaceae family was most common (23
percent of the ground cover). There were 15 families in 1999.
The most common families were the Scrophulariaceae,
Asteraceae, and Chenopodiaceae.
The most numerous species in the seeded unit in 1997
were Chenopodium leptophyllum (narrowleaf goosefoot),
Agropyron sp. (wheatgrass), Bouteloua gracilis (blue grama),
and Elymus elymoides (squirreltail). By 1999, perennial

grasses and forbs were beginning to dominate this site. The
five most numerous species were Agropyron (Pascopyrum)
smithii (western wheatgrass), Bromus carinatus (mountain
brome), Conyza canadensis (Canadian horseweed),
Thinopyrum intermedium (intermediate wheatgrass) and
Chenopodium album (lambsquarters).
In the unseeded unit, pretreatment family representation
was limited to Poaceae, Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and
Scrophulariaceae (table 2). In 1997, there were eight fami-
lies represented in this unit. The most common families
were the Fabaceae, Asteraceae, Polygonaceae, Poaceae, and
Scrophulariaceae. The number of families was highest in
1998 (11). The number of families decreased in 1999 to eight
as some of the early-successional species began to disappear
from the aboveground vegetation. Families included Poaceae,
Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Onagraceae, Scrophulariaceae,
Polygonaceae, Fagaceae and Chenopodiaceae.
The most numerous species in the unseeded unit in 1997
were Artemisia tridentata (big sagebrush), Lupinus argenteus
(silver lupine), Polygonum douglasii (Johnston’s knotweed),
and Elymus elymoides (squirreltail). The most common
species in 1999 were the same four with the addition of
Senecio multilobatus (lobeleaf groundsel) and Bromus
tectorum (cheatgrass).
In the seeded unit, the percent cover of annuals peaked in
1998, 2 years following restoration treatments, at approxi-
mately 29 percent of the ground cover. Perennials continued
to increase and composed 31 percent of the ground cover in
1999. In the unseeded unit, both annuals and perennials
peaked in 1998. Annuals composed 20 percent and perenni-
als approximately 40 percent of the ground cover. By 1999,
annuals had decreased to 7 percent and perennials to
20 percent of the ground cover. Biennials remained at less
than 5 percent of the ground cover in all years and in both
treatments.
Nonnative Species
The number of nonnative species was higher in the seeded
unit. Eight species were intercepted by the transects: Agropy-
ron cristatum (crested wheatgrass), Bromus inermis (smooth
brome), Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass), Lappula occidentalis
var. occidentalis (stickseed), Marrubium vulgare (hore-
hound), Salsola tragus (Russian thistle), Thinopyrum
intermedium (intermediate wheatgrass) and Verbascum
thapsus (common mullein). In addition, Bromus commutatus
(hairy chess), Bromus japonicus (Japanese brome), Convol-
vulus arvensis (field bindweed), Lactuca serriola (prickly

lettuce), Poa pratensis (Kentucky bluegrass) and Tragopogon
dubius (salsify) were encountered within the 20 m wide belt
transect. Percentages of native and nonnative species are
given in table 3. There was an increasing trend of nonnatives
in the seeded unit, from less than 1 percent of the vegetative
cover in 1997 to approximately 24 percent of the vegetative
cover in 1999. In the unseeded unit, nonnatives showed an
increasing trend as well, from 5 percent in 1996 to 13 percent
in 1999. Cheatgrass and field bindweed, both inventoried in
this study, are listed in Arizona as noxious weeds
Only three nonnative species were captured by the
transects in the unseeded unit: B. tectorum (cheatgrass), L.
serriola (prickly lettuce) and V. thapsus (common mullein).
Four additional species were inventoried in the belt transects:
Polygonum aviculare (prostrate knotweed), Polygonum con-
volvulus (black bindweed), P. pratensis (Kentucky blue-
grass), and T. dubius (salsify).
Reasons for the larger number of nonnatives in the seeded
unit could be due to: (1) their presence in the soil seed bank;
(2) as contaminants in the seed mix; (3) increased foot traffic
in this unit because of its use as a demonstration site,
however, the unseeded unit is also used for that purpose; or
(4) through colonization from offsite by dispersal mecha-
nisms. The seeded unit is in close proximity to a meadow.
Grasses
Ten species of grasses were inventoried in the seeded unit.
These species were Achnatherum hymenoides (Indian rice-
grass), A. cristatum, Agropyron (Pascopyrum) smithii (west-
ern wheatgrass), Bouteloua gracilis (blue grama), Bromus
carinatus (mountain brome), B. inermis, B. tectorum, Elymus
elymoides (squirreltail), Koeleria cristatum (junegrass), and
T. intermedium. In addition, the belt transect contained
B. commutatus, B. japonicus, and P. pratensis. Schizachyrium
scoparium (little bluestem) was seeded, but was not re-
corded in the monitoring plots prior to 2000.
Only four species of grasses were present in the plots in the
unseeded unit and thus most likely regenerated from the soil
seed bank or were carried in from the area surrounding the
site. These species were Bouteloua gracilis, Bromus tectorum,
Elymus elymoides, and Poa fendleriana. Poa pratensis was
also captured by the belt transect.

Seeding Versus Natural Regeneration: A Comparison of Vegetation Change Following Thinning and Burning…
Springer, Waltz, Fulé, Moore, and Covington
Shrubs
Eight species of shrubs were present in the seeded unit.
These species were Amelanchier utahensis (Utah service-
berry), Arctostaphylos pungens (pointleaf manzanita), Garrya
flavescens (ashy silktassel), Purshia tridentata (antelope
bitterbrush), Rhus trilobata (skunkbush sumac), Ribes
cereum (wax currant), and Symphoricarpos oreophilus
(whortleleaf snowberry). Bitterbrush, sumac, currant, and
snowberry were seeded, so it is difficult to ascertain whether
the species monitored on the plots came from natural regen-
eration or from seeding. However, seeding with shrub spe-
cies appeared to be effective with the exception of Mahonia
repens (Oregon-grape). No specimens of this taxa were found
in the seeded unit. Sambucus cerulea (blue elderberry) was
not captured by the monitoring plots, although it was ob-
served nearby.
In the unseeded unit, four species were inventoried on the
plots: A. pungens, Artemisia tridentata, A. utahensis, and
R. cereum. Species that were observed in the unit, but not
captured by the monitoring plots, included G. flavescens,
A. pungens and Ceanothus fendleri (buckbrush). These spe-
cies presumably sprouted after fire. With the exception of big
sagebrush (A. tridentata), shrubs were not detected in the
soil seed bank (or propagule bank) from samples taken at
Mt. Trumbull (Springer 1999). However, some species ap-
parently are still present in the form of underground rhi-
zomes or buds and will regenerate following fire. Nearly all
shrub species in these units were heavily browsed, most
likely by deer or rabbits, since elk are not present at Mt.
Trumbull and cattle were excluded from the study area
(personal observations).
Legumes
No species of legumes (Fabaceae or pea family) were
manually seeded in either unit and no species of legumes
were captured by the line transects in the seeded unit. The
only occurrence of legumes in this unit was one record of
Lotus utahensis (Utah birdsfoot trefoil) from the belt transects
in 1998.
In the unseeded unit, Lupinus argenteus (silver lupine)
was recorded on the line transects prior to treatment. Silver
lupine was recorded in all years in both plots in this unit. Its
frequency was highest in 1998, the year following thinning
and burning (an average of 16 percent of the ground cover).
Other legumes recorded in the unseeded unit were Lotus
spp. (Lotus plebius, Lotus wrightii, Lotus sp.) in 1997, 1998,
and 1999 and Lupinus kingii (King’s lupine) in 1998 on a belt
transect.
Simpson’s Index and Species Richness
Pretreatment species richness was very low (less than five
species) on the line transects on all plots (fig. 2). In 1998, it
peaked in the unseeded unit (17 species), but continued to
increase in the seeded unit in 1999 (28 species). The total
number of species in the seeded unit, including species
captured on the belt transects, was 51. The average number
of species per plot in the unseeded unit was 36. The Simpson’s
diversity index showed a similar trend to species richness in
the seeded unit (fig. 3), increasing from 0 in the pretreat-
ment inventory to 14 in 1999. In the unseeded unit, it peaked
at 10 in one plot in 1998, but continued to increase slightly
in the other plot through 1999 (fig. 3).
Discussion _____________________
Seeding is a complex issue, and the positive and negative
aspects must be weighed before making any type of manage-
ment decision relating to ecological restoration in South-
western ponderosa pine forests. Seeding has many advan-
tages including decreased soil erosion (Beyers and others
1998) and increased vegetative ground cover (Williamson
1984; Tyser and others 1998). It also produces an increase in
the amount of available seed stock for colonizing nearby
areas (Jacobson and others 1994) and, if successful, it will
increase species richness and diversity (Grant and others
1997). However, seeding also has disadvantages, such as
high cost and lack of locally-adapted genetic material for
most areas (Dunne 1999; Roundy 1999). Also, increased
species diversity can be a major disadvantage if this increase
is due to nonnative species. This study, though exploratory,
seems to indicate that although seeding increased the spe-
cies richness and diversity, these increases were due in part
to increases in nonnative species that were possibly brought
onsite by the seed mixture. The percentage of nonnatives in
the seeded unit continued to increase in 1999 and will be
monitored to determine if this trend continues.
There is presently a dearth of native perennial grasses,
legumes, and shrubs in the ponderosa pine forests of the Mt.
Trumbull area, based on this study, on previous soil seed
bank studies (Springer 1999), and on data from other areas
of ponderosa pine forest in northern Arizona. Rasmussen
(1941), in one of the few historical publications from the
Arizona Strip containing information on species frequency,
mentions that by the time of his publication, certain legumes
had entirely disappeared from the Kaibab Plateau (about
45 km to the east) due in part to severe overgrazing by wild

deer populations and/or domestic livestock in the late 1800s
and early 1900s. Native shrub species also were decimated
from much of the Plateau, presumably by fluctuations in the
deer population. The Mt. Trumbull area has populations of
deer but no elk, and it has a history of grazing by domestic
cattle (Altschul and Fairley 1989). Seeding can return extir-
pated species to a site, although information is necessary to
ascertain if these species were historically present. If species
have been decimated from a site, then the genetic material
from species adapted to that site is likely no longer available.
Nonnative species, particularly cheatgrass and common
mullein, increased following restoration treatments in the
study area at Mt. Trumbull. Common mullein is considered
to be an early-successional species and is expected eventu-
ally to be replaced by native species in the treated areas, but
cheatgrass has been known to change the species composi-
tion and fire cycle of areas where it has become dominant
(Sheley and Petroff 1999). If the goal of management efforts
is to decrease the amount of cheatgrass in the restored areas,
then these areas should be heavily seeded with early succes-
sional native grass species able to compete with the cheat-
grass, such as squirreltail (Jones 1998). Early successional
species made up a large percentage of species in the soil seed
bank in the study area (Springer 1999). Their decline after
the first few years was expected because many of these
species are annuals or biennials, rely on disturbance to
maintain their populations, and use the soil seed bank to
store genotypes for future environmental variability
(Springer 1999). However, the low frequency of perennial
species in the unseeded unit is of some concern if this pattern
is indicative of the entire study area.
Species richness and diversity began to drop off in the
unseeded unit in the third year following restoration
treatments, and few new species were recorded. This trend
could be attributable to weather or to a slowdown in the rate
of successional response after treatment. Both units should
continue to be monitored to observe trends. As additional
units across the entire project area are treated with overstory
tree thinning and prescribed burning, more data will be
available to assist with management decisions.
This study points to the need to conduct seeding trials to
determine which seeds are germinating, and how long it
takes for these species to become established. Seeding trials
can also be used to pinpoint the origin of nonnative species
appearing onsite, whether through dispersal mechanisms or
in seed mixtures. There is also a need to conduct studies to
determine the effects of prescribed burning on leguminous
species in Southwestern ponderosa pine forests, as well as
the inputs of nitrogen by these species, for their role in
nitrogen cycling is just beginning to be quantified (Hendricks
and others 1999).
When considering whether and with what species a site
should be seeded, each area needs to be treated individually
and blanket treatments should not be applied to huge areas
of the landscape. Factors to take into account are existing
vegetation, species in the soil seed bank, past management
history, microclimate conditions and soils. Soil seed bank
samples taken prior to ecological restoration treatments can
give an idea of the species that will colonize a site following
these treatments (Springer 1999). As the demand for native
seed increases across the West, we hope that supply will
grow to meet demand and eventually costs will decline;
however, there is a tradeoff of cost versus maintaining seed
mixtures that are weed-free. Further effort should be made
to collect seeds in areas undergoing restoration to maintain
the genetic material adapted to that area.

Effect of Restoration Thinning on
Mycorrhizal Fungal Propagules in a
Northern Arizona Ponderosa Pine Forest:
Preliminary Results

Abstract—The inoculum potential for arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM)
and ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi were investigated in thinned and
uncut control stands in a northern Arizona ponderosa pine forest. A
corn bioassay was used to determine the relative amount of infective
propagules of AM fungi, and a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)
bioassay was used to determine the relative amount of infective
propagules of EM fungi. Three stands of each treatment were
sampled by collecting soil cores along 10 randomly chosen transects
within each stand. The relative amount of infective propagules of
AM fungi was significantly higher in samples collected from the
thinned stands than controls. Conversely, there was a slight de-
crease in the relative amount of infective propagules of EM fungi in
samples collected from thinned stands in comparison to the con-
trols; however, this difference was not significant. These prelimi-
nary results indicate that population densities of AM fungi can
rapidly increase following restoration thinning in northern Arizona
ponderosa pine forests. This may have important implications for
restoring the herbaceous understory of these forests because most
understory plants depend upon AM associations for normal growth.
Introduction ____________________
Low intensity fires carried by grassy understories were
prevalent every 2–20 years in southwestern ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa) ecosystems prior to Euro-American settle-
ment and played a major role in determining the structure,
composition, and stability of these ecosystems (Cooper 1960).
Current alterations to the structure and function of south-
western ponderosa pine forests are the result of heavy
grazing, intensive logging of old-growth trees, and fire sup-
pression by Euro-American settlement around the turn of
the 20th century (Covington and others 1997). This has
resulted in a large number of small trees with closed cano-
pies and little herbaceous understory production. The cur-
rent reduction in herbaceous understory diversity and pro-
duction in ponderosa pine forests has contributed to the
alteration of the natural fire regime, loss of habitat for
numerous animal species, and overall reduction of species
diversity. As a result, a major objective of restoring South-
western ponderosa pine forests is to increase herbaceous
understory diversity and production by reestablishing com-
munity structure and function within a range of natural
variability.
Mycorrhizae are a major component of soil ecosystems,
playing an important role in plant nutrition, nutrient cy-
cling, food webs, and the development of soil structure
(Johnson and others 1999). A mycorrhiza is generally a
“mutualistic relation between plant and fungus localized in
a root or root-like structure in which energy moves primarily
from plant to fungus and inorganic resources move from
fungus to plant” (Allen 1991). Forest tree species, particu-
larly those within Pinaceae, Fagaceae, Betulaceae, and
Dipterocarpaceae form ectomycorrhizal (EM) relationships
with basidiomycetes and ascomycetes (Harley and Smith
1983). Over 80 percent of all plants form arbuscular mycor-
rhizal (AM) relationships with Glomalean fungi, a single
order of Zygomycetes. A few exceptional plant families
(Cyperaceae, Juncaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Chenopodiaceae,
and Brassicaceae) typically do not form any mycorrhizal
relationship (nonmycotrophic) (Pendleton and Smith 1983).
Numerous researchers have suggested a relationship be-
tween the recovery time of disturbed ecosystems and the
abundance of infective propagules of fungi (Allen and Allen
1980; Bentwenga and Hetrick 1991; Noyd and others 1995;
Reeves and others 1979). Therefore, quantifying the effect of
restoration thinning on densities of mycorrhizal fungal
propagules may provide insight to the recovery rate of
herbaceous understory communities to restoration treat-
ments in ponderosa pine forests.
This is the first known study looking at AM fungal
propagule densities in Southwestern ponderosa pine for-
ests. We hypothesized that AM fungal propagule densities
would increase and EM fungal propagule densities would
decrease in response to restoration thinning in ponderosa
pine forests, and that these changes would be correlated to
host plant abundance. The specific objectives of this study
were to: (1) quantify the effect of restoration thinning on AM
and EM fungal propagule densities; and (2) assess the

relationships between mycorrhizal fungal propagule densi-
ties and soil and plant community properties.
Methods _______________________
Experimental Design
Three blocks of four restoration treatments were estab-
lished during the summer of 1998 within approximately
1,700 acres of the Fort Valley Experimental Forest and
adjacent areas near Flagstaff, AZ (fig. 1). Treatment units
within each block were randomly assigned one of four treat-
ments: (1) no thinning or burning (control); (2) thinning to a
low level of replacement trees and burning; (3) thinning to an
intermediate level of replacement trees and burning; (4)
thinning to a high level of replacement trees and burning.
Specific details of thinning treatment guidelines are out-
lined in Covington and others 1998. Soils for this study were
collected before any of the treatment units had been burned,
and therefore these results only reflect the effect of restora-
tion thinning on mycorrhizal fungal propagules. Continua-
tion of this study will investigate the effects of full restora-
tion treatments (thinning and prescribed burning) after all
treatment units have been burned.
Field Sampling
Soil samples for “bait-plant bioassays” and soil and veg-
etation analyses were taken in mid-May, 6 months after
thinning, along 10 randomly placed transects within each of
the three blocks in the controls (1-1, 2-1, 3-1) and low level
of replacement trees thinning treatment units (1-2, 2-2, 3-2)
(fig. 1). Soil samples were taken to a depth of 15 cm using a
hand trowel. Samples were taken to this depth because AM
fungal propagule densities are generally highest in the
surface 15 cm (Johnson and others 1991). Two samples from
each transect were immediately placed into 4 cm diameter x
20 cm diameter deep Conetainers (Stuewe and Sons, Inc.,
Corvallis, OR) for “bait-plant bioassays.” The other sample
for soil analysis was placed in a ziploc bag and stored in a
freezer until analysis. A 0.5 x 2 m (1 m2) plot was located
adjacent to each soil sample, and the percent cover of each
herbaceous and woody species present along with substrates
(litter, soil, and rock) were estimated using cardboard cut-
outs as visual guides. The soil seed bank, soil disturbance,
bulk density, fuel loads, fire behavior, herbaceous biomass
production and abundance, overstory tree structure, and
understory tree regeneration were also assessed along these
50 m transects.

Lab Analysis
A corn (Zea mays) bioassay was used to determine the
relative amount of infective propagules of AM fungi, and a
ponderosa pine bioassay was used to determine the relative
amount of infective propagules of EM fungi. Corn is a
strongly mycotrophic plant and grows rapidly and uni-
formly, and its advantages outweigh the disadvantage of not
using native host plants (Johnson and others 1999). “Bait-
plant bioassays” are designed to detect all types of viable
mycorrhizal fungal propagules including spores, fragments
of mycorrhizal roots and extraradical hyphae and therefore
may more accurately quantify total mycorrhizal fungi than
direct counts of sporocarps, spores, or colonized root lengths
(Brundrett and others 1994; Johnson and others 1999).
Plants were placed in a greenhouse and watered every 3
days until corn plants were harvested at 6 weeks and pine
plants were harvested at 12 weeks. Roots were carefully
washed free from the soil and were measured for length and
weighed. Following mycorrhizal analysis, roots were dried
in an oven at 70 ∞C for 24 hours and then were weighed again.
Shoot lengths and dry weights were also measured. Corn
roots were prepared for fungal propagule density measure-
ments by taking a random subsample of roots of a known
mass, clearing roots in 5 percent KOH, and then staining
roots with trypan blue (Johnson and others 1999). The
gridline intersect method using a dissecting microscope was
used to measure the proportion of root length containing AM
fungal structures: arbuscules, vesicles, coils, internal myc-
orrhizal hyphae and external mycorrhizal hyphae (Givanetti
and Mosse 1980). Pine roots were measured for fungal
propagule density through direct examination using a dis-
secting microscope to quantify the proportion of root tips
colonized with EM fungi (Gehring and Whitham 1991). Root
tips were also classified as dead or living.
Soil Analysis
Soil samples from each transect were analyzed for pH,
total N, total P and organic C at the Bilby Research Soil
Analysis Laboratory, Flagstaff, AZ. Soil pH was determined
in a 1:1 slurry by pH meter. The general method used for N
and P was a Kjeldahl digestion of the soil material followed
with the analysis of N and P by automated colorimetry using
a Technicon auto-analyzer (Parkinson and others 1975).
Organic matter was determined by loss on ignition. Samples
were heated in crucibles in a muffle furnace at 450 ∞C and net
weight loss was estimated as organic matter.
Statistical Analysis
Analysis of variance for a randomized complete block
design was conducted using SAS JMPIN version 3.2.1 (SAS
Institute 1997) to determine the effect of thinning on mycor-
rhizal propagule densities. Root infection data were log (x + 1)
transformed prior to analysis, and bait plant length and
weight, herbaceous plant abundance, and soil properties
were ln transformed. Simple correlation analyses were con-
ducted to assess the relationship between infectivity, soil
and plant community properties, and bait plant character-
istics (length and weight) using SAS JMPIN. Significance of

correlations and analysis of variances were accepted at
alpha £ 0.05.
Results ________________________
Mycorrhizal fungi colonized all “bait-plant” roots grown in
soil from the thinned and control units. Bioassay results
indicated that infective propagule densities of AM fungi
were significantly higher in the samples collected from the
thinned units than controls (F = 5.4437, P < 0.005) (fig. 2).
Also, corn grown in thinned soils had relatively more vesicles
and less hyphae than corn grown in control soils (fig. 3).
Conversely, there was a slight decrease in the relative
amount of infective propagules of EM fungi in samples
collected from thinned stands in comparison to the controls
(F = 2.1601 P > 0.05); however, this difference was not
significant (fig. 2). Sparsely branched bifurcated tips were
the dominant EM morphotype with tuberoid mycorrhiza
also dominant.
AM fungal infectivity was not correlated with corn shoot
weight, corn root weight or percent herbaceous cover (r =
–0.037, r = 0.031, and r = 0.035 respectively, N = 60, P ≥ 0.05).
EM fungal infectivity was not correlated with pine shoot
weight (r = 0.11) but was positively correlated with pine root
weight (r =  0.28, N = 60, P ≥ 0.05). The only soil property that
was correlated with AM fungal infectivity was pH (r = 0.27,

N = 60, P ≥ 0.05). There were no significant differences
between soil properties in the thinned and control stands
(table 1). However, pH levels were higher in the thinned
units than the controls, which is congruent with the findings
that thinned units had greater propagule densities of AM
fungi than the controls.
Both the thinned and control units were dominated by
graminoids followed by nonlegume forbs, legumes, and woody
shrubs. Unidentified sedges, Carex sp., dominated the her-
baceous cover for both units followed by C3 grasses including
Elymus elymoides (squirreltail), Poa fendleriana (mutton-
grass) and Festuca arizonica (Arizona fescue). Muhlenbergia
montana (mountain muhley) was the only dominant C4
grass in both units; however, its presence was less than the
dominant C3 grasses. The dominant forbs in both the thinned
and control units were Cirsium wheeleri (thistle) and Sol-
idago sp. (goldenrod). There were slightly higher species
richness, Simpson’s diversity, and herbaceous cover in the
thinned units in comparison with the control units; however,
these differences were not significant (table 2).
Discussion _____________________
Restoration thinning increased the cover of herbaceous,
AM hosts and decreased the cover of ponderosa pine, EM
hosts. These aboveground changes were accompanied by the
expected belowground changes: propagule densities of AM
fungi increased by 23 percent while those of EM fungi
decreased by 6 percent. These preliminary results indicate
that mycorrhizal fungal population densities respond rap-
idly to restoration thinning in northern Arizona ponderosa
pine forests. Two main processes control population densi-
ties of mycorrhizal fungi following disturbance: immigration
of new propagules from nearby areas and survival and
spread of residual propagules (Warner and others 1987).
Rapid colonization of AM fungi has been illustrated in other
studies. For example, Johnson and McGraw (1988) found
that unreclaimed taconite tailings devoid of AM fungi were
colonized within weeks of reclamation. It was hypothesized
that spores were transferred to the reclaimed tailings by
biotic (animals) and abiotic (wind and water) vectors (Johnson
and McGraw 1988). In the present study it is likely that AM
fungi spread from preexisting mycorrhizal hyphae in living
and dead roots.
Soil disturbance has been reported to generally reduce AM
propagule densities due to the destruction of the hyphal
network during the break-up of the soil macrostructure
(Reeves and others 1979; Fairchild and Miller 1988). Conse-
quently, one may predict that propagule densities should
decrease following thinning due to soil disturbance from
mechanized logging equipment. This effect was not observed
in our study, which may indicate that soil disturbance was
not severe enough to have destroyed AM fungal propagules,
or that the sites were rapidly colonized by AM fungal spores
and residual hyphae. Another study, conducted by Rives and
others (1980), showed that there was no reduction in popu-
lation densities of AM fungi following soil disturbance. It has
been suggested that environments with a high proportion of
grasses are more tolerant of disturbance because their
fiberous root systems generate high densities of infective
propagules (Jasper and others 1991). A successional study of
AM propagule densities across a grassland to forest
chronosequence showed AM inoculum potential increased
with increasing grass cover and decreased in later succes-
sional sites with EM trees (Johnson and others 1991).
Similarly, a study by Benjamin and others (1989) illustrated
that dominant herbaceous plants had lower AM colonization
as tree density increased, possibly because these plants had
insufficient photosynthetic capability to support AM infec-
tion. Finally, some research indicates that while the fungal
propagule densities do not decrease following disturbance,

AM species composition may change (Johnson and Pfleger
1991). Specifically, AM species from the Glomaceae family
depend more on hyphae for reproduction than spores. In
contrast, AM species from the Gycosperaceae family depend
more on spores for reproduction than hyphae (Biermann
And Linderman 1983).
Implications for Restoration ______
Pre Euro-American ponderosa pine understory communi-
ties were dominated by warm-season (C4) grasses, which are
often obligately mycotrophic (Cooper 1960; Wilson and
Hartnett 1998). However, current ponderosa pine forests
are dominated by species that form no mycorrhizal associa-
tions (Carex sp.) or C3 grasses that are often facultatively
mycotrophic. This pattern is contrary to other studies that
suggest succession proceeds from dominance of
nonmycotrophic and facultative mycotrophic species to obli-
gate mycotrophic species in later successional stages (Janos
1980; Allen and Allen 1984). This reversed pattern has been
established because the natural fires that historically would
minimize competition between ponderosa pine and herba-
ceous plants have been suppressed, and now shade-tolerant
C3 grasses are better adapted to these environments. There-
fore, without the reduction of EM tree competition and
reintroduction of fire, the understory of Southwestern pon-
derosa pine forests will likely continue to be dominated by
nonmycotrophic Carex and facultatively AM species. Noyd
and others (1995) demonstrated that obligate C4 grasses,
Andropogon gerardii (big bluestem) and Schizachyrium
scoparium (little bluestem), were unable to grow or survive
as seedlings in soil where AM fungi were eliminated; how-
ever, Elymus canadensis (C3 grass) establishment was un-
affected by AM fungi availability. Similarly, Hetrick and
others (1994) found that C4 grasses were competitively
superior to C3 grasses when grown in the presence of AM
fungi; but C3 grasses were competitively superior in soils
without AM fungi. As a result, one can predict that increased
populations of AM fungi in the thinned restoration units
may promote increased C4 grass cover. Finally, recent
mycorrhizal fungi research in a variety of environments has
shown that mycorrhizal interactions may be important
determinants of plant diversity, ecosystem variability, and
productivity (Hartnett and Wilson 1999; van der Heijden
and others 1998a,b). Microcosm experiments simulating
European and American grasslands have shown that in-
creasing AM fungal diversity can increase diversity and
overall community structure (Klironomos and others 2000;
van der Heijden and others 1998b).
Conclusions____________________
Restoration thinning impacts propagule densities of EM
and AM fungi. Reducing pine cover and increasing herba-
ceous cover shifts the system toward a more AM dominated
community. Increasing propagule densities of AM fungi may
favor the establishment of a C4 grassland community. As a
result, knowledge of AM fungal propagule densities and AM
fungal species composition will be crucial to understanding
the successional response of herbaceous understory commu-
nities to Southwestern ponderosa pine forest restoration
thinning and prescribed burning treatments.

Abstract—One of the most prevalent land-use practices in the
American Southwest, and one of the most contentious issues among
land-use policymakers, is the grazing of domestic livestock. In an
effort to contribute scientific understanding to this debate, we have
designed experiments comparing the effects of alternative grazing
regimes on plant communities. In a semiarid grassland of northern
Arizona, we have implemented a replicated study of four treat-
ments: (1) low-intensity, long-duration grazing rotations; (2) high-
intensity, short-duration rotations (Holistic Resource Management-
style grazing); (3) very high intensity, short duration grazing (to
simulate herd impact); and (4) livestock exclosure. Beginning in
1997, we conducted annual surveys of the plant communities with
Modified-Whittaker plots. Preliminary results suggest that
interannual variability affecting all study plots is high, and that
these alternative management strategies do not have dramatic
short-term effects on the plant community. Comparisons of native
and exotic species richness, as well as ground cover of grasses and
forbs, showed no consistent pattern due to treatment over a 3-year
period. Our results suggest that the effects of alternative livestock
management styles in the semiarid grasslands studied are modest,
at least in the short-term, and that future plant monitoring pro-
grams would greatly benefit from a multiscale sampling design.
Introduction ____________________
Semiarid grasslands are diverse and productive ecosys-
tems that have been subjected to anthropogenic forces for
over a century. Among the many perturbations affecting
these systems, the grazing of domestic livestock has been
recognized as the most pervasive (Fleischner 1994). Al-
though the effects of grazing have been studied for over a
century, little consensus has been reached with regard to
grazing’s impact on grassland composition and productiv-
ity, due in part to the difficulty of separating the effects of

livestock from tremendous interannual variation in climatic
patterns. While some studies have found grazing to be the
primary determinant of plant community composition (for
example, Conley and others 1992; Fuhlendorf and Smeins
1997), others have found climatic patterns to outweigh
grazing effects (for example, Gibbens and Beck 1988; Herbel
and others 1972). Moreover, the interactions of climatic
variation and grazing disturbances may exacerbate the
changes in grassland plant communities (Fuhlendorf and
Smeins 1997).
Within this sphere of unpredictable climatic events, hu-
mans endeavor towards sustainable land-use practices, but
in many cases we fail due to our ignorance of the complex
array of forces, both natural and anthropogenic, operating in
all ecosystems. Certainly the last century of fire prevention
programs in the forests of the American Southwest are a
testament to our efforts to eliminate or control disturbance,
but as a consequence, we have placed many forest ecosys-
tems in tenuous states where they are prone to catastrophic
fire (Covington and others 1994). Scientists and public alike
recognize a need to restore disturbance cycles to many
natural systems. However, efforts to restore grasslands
have been slow at best, and degradation by land-use activi-
ties are so acute that they have become a global conservation
priority (Samson and Knopf 1996). Noss and others (1995)
concluded that grasslands were among the most endangered
ecosystems in the United States, and of those ecotypes that
were most severely degraded, grasslands suffered areal
losses that were threefold greater than any other ecosystem.
Likely explanations of this decline include their widespread
use for agriculture and development, and the commonly
assigned low aesthetic value that has translated into a low
priority for conservation (Samson and Knopf 1996).
The Southwest has nearly one million acres of arid and
semiarid grasslands, but unfortunately our understanding
of their ecology is fairly superficial, especially of the effect of
large mammal herbivory such as domestic livestock. By
some accounts the number of cattle on rangelands of the
Western United States doubled, from 25.5 to 54.4 million
head between 1940 and 1990 (Belsky and others 1999),
affecting approximately 70 percent of the land surface in the
Western States (Fleischner 1994), and 86 percent of the land
in Arizona (Mayes and Archer 1982).
Surprisingly little is known about the effects of varying
intensities of livestock grazing on the biological diversity of
semiarid grasslands. Although many studies have exam-
ined the effects of livestock on the soils, vegetation, and birds

of riparian areas (Berendse 1999; Saab and others 1995;
Trimble and Mendel 1995), this information cannot be ap-
plied to grassland systems because upland grasslands differ
substantially, both in structure and function, from riparian
ecosystems. In addition, Hastings and Turner (1965) have
presented compelling photographic evidence that the last
century has seen a transformation over large areas of the
Southwest, of grasslands to woody shrublands. While eco-
logical impacts from current livestock grazing practices are
widespread and ongoing, it is important to recognize that
the greatest damage from overgrazing appears to have
taken place in the 1890s (Wildeman and Brock 2000).
Because livestock grazing can be conducted at varying
intensities, it is likely that some management techniques
alter biological diversity more than others. The standard
method for measuring such effects has been to establish
exclosures and conduct pairwise comparisons of species
richness and ground cover (Hughes 1996). Because of the
tremendous variability in responses as seen in the litera-
ture, it is exceedingly difficult for land managers to confi-
dently proceed with grazing management plans. In addition
to the confounding effects of variable climatic patterns
mentioned previously, numerous criticisms have been di-
rected at previous grazing studies, including the small size
of exclosures (Fleischner 1994), a lack of standard methods
for measuring grazing intensity (Fleischner 1994), changes
in the behavior of small herbivores and granivores
(McNaughton 1983), and poor experimental design (Stohlgren
and others 1998). Stohlgren and others (1998) address many
of the sampling design concerns and draw specific attention
to inadequate assessment of spatial heterogeneity of land-
scapes. In grassland ecosystems, choosing the appropriate
spatial scale at which to measure a given response variable
is not trivial, yet the majority of plant diversity studies have
arbitrarily chosen sample plots of 1 m2 or less (Stohlgren and
others 1998). Collins and Glenn (1997) have demonstrated
that measures of local species richness generated from a 1 m2
plot often correlate poorly with landscape-scale species rich-
ness. Similarly, Stohlgren and others (1998) compared com-
mon rangeland vegetation sampling techniques and found
the traditional, fine-scale measurements to greatly under-
estimate rare or patchily distributed species.
To address many of the problems associated with previous
study designs, we initiated an experiment with both spatial
and temporal replication. This paper addresses three key
issues in the study of livestock grazing impacts:
• Does increasing intensity of livestock grazing have a
consistent effect on the ground cover and species rich-
ness of both native and exotic grasses and forbs?
• Do grazing treatments cause a predictable shift in
species composition of the overall plant community?
• Can our sampling techniques and models of plant spe-
cies richness be scaled accurately to reflect conditions of
larger landscapes?
Methods _______________________
Site Description
Located at 2,160 m elevation and approximately 32 km
southeast of Flagstaff in north-central Arizona, the Reed
Lake field site occupies Upper Great Basin grassland (Brown
1994) at the edge of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest.
The dominant perennial grasses are Agropyron smithii and
Elymus elymoides. A vertisol soil occurs across the entirety
of the 25-ha study site. Annual precipitation averages be-
tween 300 and 460 mm and is approximately evenly divided
between winter and the July–September monsoons (Brown
1994).
Experimental Design
Meaningful application of science to grazing issues will
require comparisons of the effects of actual management
practices (“treatments”) as well as experimental treatments
designed to elucidate the relationships between grazing and
important ecosystem variables. Our experimental design,
replicated in time and space, consists of four treatments in
three blocks on the landscape (Sisk and others 1999). The
four treatments are (abbreviations shown in parenthe-
ses): (1) conventional low-intensity, long-duration graz-
ing rotations (CON); (2) high-intensity, short-duration
rotations informed by the principles of Holistic Resource
Management (HRM, see Savory 1988); (3) very high-inten-
sity, short-duration grazing to simulate herd impact (VHI);
and (4) livestock exclosure (EXC).
Stocking rates and rotations for the first two treatments
are determined by ranchers on adjoining pastures, while the
latter two treatments are implemented on experimental
plots by researchers and ranchers. Instead of manipulat-
ing small plots in a way thought to mimic range manage-
ment, we are working on active ranches, where we have
carefully selected matched sites in which spatially and
temporally extensive treatment effects can be complemented
with 1-ha EXC and VHI treatments. Of the four treatments,
only the VHI treatment is not a simulation of a current
grazing policy; it serves as a critical upper-end treatment
representing a ranching practice that could be implemented
only with open-range herding. Its primary purpose is to help
identify mechanistic relationships and inform interpreta-
tion of results from all treatments.
Plant Surveys
To measure plant community patterns, we established a
Modified-Whittaker plot in each treatment plot (fig. 1;
Stohlgren and others 1995). The Modified-Whittaker plot
samples the heterogeneity of plant communities with a
higher level of accuracy then either true random sampling
or the original Whittaker plot design (Stohlgren and others
1995). This sampling design involves a 1,000 m2 plot with
nested subplots consisting of one 100 m2, two 10 m2, and ten
1 m2 subplots (fig. 1). Our version of the Modified-Whittaker
plot differs slightly from the design proposed by Stohlgren
and others (1995) in that we have placed four of the 1 m2
subplots within the central 100 m2 plot. Each Modified-
Whittaker plot has been measured annually since 1997,
with surveys conducted between mid-July and early Sep-
tember. The 1 m2 plots were surveyed with a 50-point
frequency frame (Mueller-Dombois and Ellenberg 1974)
that provided a more objective measurement of ground
cover by species and a more comprehensive species list

than could be obtained with visual estimates. Only species
lists were assembled for the 10 m2, 100 m2, and 1,000 m2
plots. Plant identifications were referenced with the Deaver
Herbarium located at Northern Arizona University in
Flagstaff, AZ, and voucher specimens were retained in the
Sisk Laboratory. Of the approximately 80 plant species
found at the Reed Lake site, 15 could not be identified due
to poor specimens but were considered unique species and
therefore included in overall estimates of species diversity.
Grass Versus Forb—Three years of detailed plant com-
munity data have generated a wealth of information, and
here we present only a subset. We calculated trends in
ground cover estimates for the two primary functional groups,
grasses and forbs, using data collected from the 1 m2 plots
over all 3 years. Data were transformed with an arcsine
(square root) function prior to analysis (Sokal and Rohlf
1995), but are presented as percentages. A repeated-mea-
sures ANOVA was conducted for each functional group
(Sokal and Rohlf 1995).
Native Versus Exotic—To address the issue of whether
livestock grazing management techniques affect the estab-
lishment of exotic species, we calculated the number of
native and exotic species in each treatment for each of the 3
years. In addition, we calculated the total ground cover of
native and exotic species by treatment and year. A repeated-
measures ANOVA was conducted for species richness and
ground cover.
Community-Level Analysis—To determine whether
treatment was having a predictable effect on overall plant
diversity, we used 3 years of 1-m2 subplot data to calculate
three indices, as described in Magurran (1988). First, we
calculated values for the Shannon-Wiener index of diversity
based on the proportional abundance of species, with higher
values suggesting more species and greater evenness. Sec-
ond, we estimated evenness by comparing the observed
diversity to the maximum potential diversity. Values fall
between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating a more
evenly distributed community. Third, we calculated the
Simpson’s index, which is weighted towards the more domi-
nant species and is fairly insensitive to differences in rare
species. All calculations were made based on Magurran
(1988).
As suggested by Stohlgren and others (1998), we esti-
mated the similarity of plant communities between treat-
ments using Jaccard’s Coefficient (signified as J, Krebs
1989). Jaccard’s Coefficient (or index) is a standard similar-
ity index that indicates the amount of overlap between the
communities of any pair of sites. Within each replicate, we
compared the CON treatment to each of the other three
treatments and calculated the corresponding Jaccard’s Co-
efficient. We chose to use the CON treatment as the “control”
because it represents the most common grazing manage-
ment style for Southwestern rangelands, both historically
and currently (Kruse and Jemison 2000), while other treat-
ments are more recent deviations from this management.
The J value was then calculated for each 1,000 m2 plot
comparison and averaged across all three replicates. A J
value of 1.0 would represent complete overlap of species
between two sites.
Another useful product from the nested design of the
Modified-Whittaker plots is the ability to generate species-
area curves. Species-area curves have the very practical
application of extrapolating total species richness to areas
much larger then the plots in which the plant surveys were
conducted. One standard variant of the species-area curve is
defined as:
y = m(log Area) + b
where y is the number of species, m is the slope of the line,
and b is a constant. However, Stohlgren and others (1997)
have demonstrated that a corrected species-area curve pro-
vides a far more accurate extrapolation of plant species to
large areas:
y = (m/J) (log Area) + b
where J is the mean Jaccard’s Coefficient. We calculated the
species-area curve for each treatment based on 1999 data
from the 1 m2, 10 m2, and 100 m2 plots. We then calculated
the J value based on the species lists of each 1,000 m2 plot

within a treatment and used the average J value to correct
the original species area curves. The estimated species
richness for an area of 3,000 m2 was calculated using both
the standard (uncorrected) species-area curve and the cor-
rected species-area curve and compared to the observed
species richness of the three 1,000 m2 plots summed together.
The final analysis of the plant community data was
conducted with a relatively new ordination technique of
demonstrated utility, nonmetric multidimensional scaling
(NMDS, Minchin 1987). Based upon NMDS, Minchin (1987)
developed a simulation procedure that makes it possible to
model patterns of variation in community composition along
ecological gradients. We used species abundance data from
the 1 m2 plots of all 3 years to compare communities of
each plot to one another.
Results ________________________
Grass Versus Forb Cover
If cattle graze grasses more commonly than forbs (Stuth
1991), then a moderate intensity of grazing may limit grasses
from becoming the dominant ground cover. In this scenario,
forbs may have higher germination success in areas where
some grazing occurs because grasses aren’t able to hoard
resources such as light and nutrients (Collins and others
1998). We analyzed ground cover data from our 1-m2 plots
for total grass and forb cover across all treatments and years.
Since the initiation of the study in 1997, grass cover appears
to have increased roughly 10 percent. However, this change
was not statistically significant (fig. 2; df = 3, F = 0.540, p =
0.668). In contrast, forb cover appears to be decreasing by
approximately 20 percent, but again this trend is not statis-
tically significant (fig. 2; df = 3, F = 0.697, p = 0.579).
Although neither trend demonstrated clear statistical sig-
nificance, both suggest changes that occurred due to yearly
patterns rather than treatment effects.
Native Versus Exotic Richness and Cover
Exotic plants are generally considered to be successful
colonizers of disturbed habitats, and high intensities of
livestock grazing have been suggested to increase
invasibility (Hobbs and Huenneke 1992). To explore this
hypothesis, we first computed the total native and exotic
species richness from our 1 m2 plots for each treatment by
Figure 2—Percent ground cover by year and treat-
ment for grasses and forbs as calculated from 1 m2
subplot data. Treatment shows no significant effect
for either grasses or forbs, but climatic patterns
appear to be benefiting grasses to the detriment of
forbs. Standard error bars are not shown because
they overlap for all treatments within any given year
indicating no statistically significant differences

year. No statistically significant differences were found
within years (table 1; 1997: df = 3, F = 1.933, p = 0.165; 1998:
df = 3, F = 1.274, p = 0.317; 1999: df = 3, F = 0.917, p = 0.455).
Similarly, ground cover by natives and exotics from our
1 m2 plots did not show significant differences among
treatments within years (table 1; 1997: df = 3, F = 1.525,
p = 0.213; 1998: df = 3, F = 2.434, p = 0.103; 1999: df = 3,
F = 0.254, p = 0.952).

Diversity Indices
Assessing diversity can be done with many different
analytical approaches, but perhaps the most common meth-
ods involve the calculation of diversity indices. Although
ubiquitous in the ecological literature, diversity indices can
be difficult to interpret because they are often codependant
on species richness and species evenness. We have calcu-
lated the means and standard errors for each treatment, by
year, for the Shannon-Wiener index, Evenness, and Simpson’s
Diversity. As displayed in table 2, treatments are fairly
similar, regardless of index or year. These data are provided
as descriptive information and no statistical tests were
conducted.
Furthermore, to determine if alternative management
styles, namely EXC, HRM, and VHI treatments, exhibited
predictable patterns of unique species we calculated the
Jaccard’s Coefficient by comparing each alternative treat-
ment plot with its partnered CON treatment plot. There was
moderate similarity between plant communities in treat-
ments, with an average of 60 percent overlap of species and
less than 6 percent standard deviation (fig. 3).
Community-Level Comparisons
In addition to difficulties in analysis and interpretation, it
is difficult to graphically display information from diversity
indices. Instead, we display community data through ordi-
nation techniques, and we statistically tested the patterns
with nonmetric multidimensional scaling. While no treat-
ment effects were found to be significant, a strongly signifi-
cant pattern was discovered for plant communities when
analyzed by year. The data suggest that the plant communi-
ties differ significantly among years regardless of treatment
type (fig. 4).
Species-Area Curves
It is commonplace in the ecological literature to ex-
trapolate results from small-scale studies to larger land-
scapes. While most sampling methods fail to provide a

framework for extrapolating data, the nested design of
the Modified-Whittaker plot is ideally suited to these
efforts. Extrapolations employing the species-area equa-
tion, corrected with Jaccard’s Coefficient, were more accu-
rate than extrapolations with the uncorrected species-
area curve. More specifically, the uncorrected species-area
curve tended to underestimate the plant community by
roughly 20 species, whereas the corrected species-area
curve underestimated by as few as three and no more than
13 (table 3).

of specific patterns and processes. Milchunas and Lauenroth
(1993) summarized 152 studies in grasslands and found
sharply contrasting results with respect to the responses of
species composition to large-herbivore grazing. The authors
suggested that these conflicting findings may be due to one
or more of the following explanations: (1) differing method-
ologies, including the intensity of grazing and the scale at
which the response variable was measured; (2) the produc-
tivity of the grassland, which includes its soil resources and
moisture; and (3) the evolutionary history of each grassland
type (Milchunas and Lauenroth 1993). This paper most
directly addresses the first, that is, the appropriate method-
ology for measuring grassland community responses to
grazing treatments.

significant. However groupings of plant communities by

Grass Versus Forb Cover
Shifts in the proportional ground cover of plant functional
groups as a function of grazing intensity have been well
documented in highly productive sites. Long-term research
conducted in the tallgrass prairies of Kansas demonstrated
that perennial grasses created a near monoculture by
outcompeting forbs when disturbance events were elimi-
nated (Collins and others 1998). In comparatively less pro-
ductive ecosystems, such as semiarid grasslands, the inter-
actions of grasses and forbs are poorly understood. In one
study of a semiarid grassland, Brady and others (1989)
found ground cover increased for both grasses and forbs
following the removal of cattle. In contrast, Rambo and
Faeth (1999) found grass cover increased by 20 percent in
two of three sites when grazing was eliminated for at least
8 years. Our own work suggests no immediate differences in
grass or forb cover due to alternative grazing treatments.
However, across all treatments grass cover is increasing
while forb cover is decreasing. Although it may be too soon
to draw conclusions about the fairly recent treatments, EXC
and VHI, we have a higher level of confidence in comparing
CON and HRM treatments, which have been in place for a
minimum of 12 years. With 3 years of ground cover data, the
alternative HRM management style does not exhibit a
markedly different level of grass or forb cover.
Native Versus Exotic Richness and Cover
Although livestock grazing has often been implicated as a
dispersal agent for exotic species (Hobbs and Huenneke
1992; Mack 1981), several studies show no link between
grazing and exotic species richness. A multi-State sampling
effort in the Northern Rocky Mountains found no consistent
differences in native or exotic species richness due to live-
stock grazing (Stohlgren and others 1999). Similarly, in a
semiarid grassland, Rambo and Faeth (1999) found no
differences in exotic species richness in either long-term or
short-term grazing exclosures. Preliminary findings from
our work agree with these latter studies, showing no statis-
tical difference in either species richness or ground cover of
native or exotic species due to treatment. Our results do
show a consistent increase in the overall number of species

Plant Community Responses to Livestock Grazing: an Assessment of Alternative Management Practices in a Semiarid Grassland
to include further cuts to monitoring budgets, even while
pressure grows to make ecologically sound decisions in the
face of increasing litigation. Our preliminary results allow
us to make two management suggestions, with the caveat
that our preliminary results are specific to the Reed Lake
study site, and should influence broader interpretations
only where they concur with other published works.
First, future monitoring efforts should heed the warning
that small sampling plots may provide significantly less
accurate information then multiscale, nested sampling plot
designs. At our study site, the use of Modified-Whittaker
plots and replicated treatments allowed us to improve our
species richness prediction accuracy by 45 percent. Efforts
are under way to apply this sampling design to other re-
sponse variables, including the diversity of macro- and
micro-arthropods, and the size and fluxes of nutrient pools.
Second, alternative livestock approaches, including
exclosures and very high intensity treatments, did not have
immediate or dramatic effects on the plant community of
this semiarid grassland. In fact, the HRM treatment that
has been in place for a dozen years shows no statistically
significant differences from the plant community of the
adjacent conventionally grazed grasslands. Therefore, if the
goal of a grassland management program is to move plant
communities in a particular direction with alternative graz-
ing practices, planners and practitioners must recognize the
necessity for a long-term commitment to treatments and to
an efficient, well targeted monitoring program.

from 1997 to 1999, which is likely to be a function of time
since a severe drought year in 1996. Although not statisti-
cally significant, it is interesting to note that the HRM
treatment had the lowest cover of exotic species in 2 of 3
years of sampling.
Plant Community Responses
By employing a variety of analytical tools we have demon-
strated that the plant communities in each treatment do not
differ significantly. This may be due to minimal ecological
impacts or it may be that the duration of this study is not yet
sufficient to detect ongoing, gradual change. Community
changes are difficult to document because they involve the
combination of species richness and the abundance of each
individual species. To address this issue we compared tradi-
tional diversity indices and employed more powerful ordina-
tion techniques. The standard diversity indices, Shannon-
Wiener, Evenness, and Simpson’s, suggest no consistent
differences among treatments. Furthermore, the species
overlap between the conventional treatment and each of
the other three treatments is nearly 60 percent for each
comparison.
The ordination of community data with NMDS also dem-
onstrated no significant differences due to treatment; how-
ever, there were strongly significant differences between
each year. This finding suggests that year-to-year variation
has had a stronger effect on the plant community than the
treatments themselves. Even though the EXC and VHI
treatments represent strikingly different livestock treat-
ments, and the CON and HRM treatments represent longer-
term, but less extreme treatments, the plant communities
have not shown a strong response to grazing intensity over
a 3-year period. Based on findings from other studies (for
example, Sala and others 1992), we suggest that the plant
community of this water-limited ecosystem is often more
sensitive to the high variability in precipitation and soil
moisture than to the livestock management treatments
compared in this study.
Improved Power with Nested Sampling
Stohlgren and others (1995, 1998) have demonstrated a
number of benefits from conducting multiscale nested sam-
pling in plant communities. Our results support their con-
clusions. For our semiarid grassland study site, standard
species-area curves consistently underestimated species rich-
ness by about 40 percent, and correcting the species-area
curve with Jaccard’s Coefficient improved estimates to
within 15 percent of the known species richness. If the goal
of a particular monitoring program is to estimate the total
number of species in a given area of grassland, then nested
sampling designs such as the Modified-Whittaker plot
should provide increased prediction accuracy.
Management Implications
Land managers appear to be increasingly placed in the
catch-22 situation of doing more with less. Especially in the
stewardship of public lands, the short-term future appears

Abstract—The Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) can be useful
indicators of ecosystem change as a result of a disturbance event. We
monitored changes in butterfly abundance in two restoration treat-
ment units paired with adjacent untreated forest at the Mt. Trumbull
Resource Conservation Area in northern Arizona. Restoration treat-
ments included thinning trees to density levels comparable to
densities at the time of Euro-American settlement, and reintroduc-
ing a low to medium intensity fire to the system. One unit was
treated in 1996, the second in 1998. Butterfly communities, nectar
availability, and herbaceous species richness were compared be-
tween treated and adjacent control forests, and between 3-year
posttreatment and 1-year posttreatment forests. Butterfly species
richness and abundance were two and three times greater, respec-
tively, in restoration treatment units than in adjacent control
forests. Nectar plant species richness ranged from two to 10 times
greater in restoration treatment units than in adjacent control
forests. Comparison of the 3-year posttreatment unit with the 1-year
posttreatment unit showed little difference in butterfly species
richness and abundance, although no statistical comparisons can be
made due to sample size. These restoration treatments offer a
unique opportunity to study responses to and recovery from distur-
bance and restoration at a landscape level.
Introduction ____________________
Current studies and methods of ecosystem restoration are
often focused on structural components, such as overstory or
understory plant composition, and not on functional pro-
cesses, such as nitrogen cycling, plant pollination, and/or
trophic level interactions (but see Kaye 1997; Covington and
others 1997). As a result, ecosystem restoration often over-
looks invertebrates as important components necessary for
ecosystem function and process. This emphasis on ecosys-
tem structure is primarily a result of limited available
information. Historical records were often inventories of
merchantable resources and did not describe how species
interacted with each other, or what processes were impor-
tant to ecosystem functioning (for example, Dutton 1882).
Butterfly Response and Successional
Change Following Ecosystem Restoration
Amy E. M. Waltz
W. Wallace Covington
Knowledge of ecosystem function and process can be ob-
tained from studying current-day undisturbed ecosystems
(Leopold 1949), although few if any “undisturbed” ecosys-
tems exist. In addition, historical function and process can
be inferred by studying function and process in experimen-
tally restored ecosystems (Leopold 1949).
In ponderosa pine forests in the Southwest, forest struc-
ture can be reconstructed from presettlement remnants and
historical records (Covington and Moore 1994; Fulé and
others 1997). This information is limited to overstory spe-
cies, with some information on herbaceous components also
available from early land surveys (Dutton 1882) and phytolith
studies (Rovner 1971; Bozarth 1993; Fisher and others 1995;
Fredlund and Tieszen 1997). These data show that South-
west forests prior to Euro-American settlement had lower
tree densities than current forests (50–150 trees per hectare
(tph) in 1870 versus 500–3,000 tph in 1994, Covington and
Moore 1994) with grassy openings. Experimental restora-
tion of these forests has been initiated using thinning to
reduce current tree densities and reintroducing fire.
Restoration in ponderosa pine is hypothesized to impact
all components of the ecosystem, including arthropods. The
change from a closed-canopy forest with little or no herba-
ceous understory community to an open forest with a domi-
nant herbaceous community results in plant diversity and
plant production increases (Covington and others 1997;
Springer and others, this proceedings). This in turn can
result in increases in the abundance and diversity of herbi-
vore arthropods (Erhardt and Thomas 1991). In addition,
restored forests show increases in soil moisture and soil
temperature when compared to control forests (Covington
and others 1997); both factors directly influence the success
rate of arthropod pupation (Erhardt and Thomas 1991;
Scoble 1992).
The Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) can be excellent
indicators of herbaceous community diversity and composi-
tion (Gilbert 1984; Erhardt 1985; Kremen 1994; Sparrow
and others 1994). Both butterflies and moths can be host-
specific as larvae, but become nectar generalists as adults,
encompassing a broad range of ecological niches. Changes in
butterfly diversity can indicate changes in the abundance
and diversity of a wide variety of invertebrates (Scoble
1992). Presence of a butterfly or moth species indicates
presence of the larval host plant, as well as sufficient adult
food resources. Day-flying butterflies in particular have a
well-known taxonomy, and often can be easily identified in
the field (Scoble 1992).
In the ponderosa pine ecosystem, the diurnal Lepidopteran
(butterflies) can be used to monitor important changes in
ecosystem function as a result of disturbance, rehabilitation,
or restoration events. Restoration of ponderosa pine forests

Butterfly Response and Successional Change Following Ecosystem Restoration
Waltz and Covington
involves thinning to create openings, thereby initiating an
herbaceous successional pattern (Springer and others, this
proceedings). While butterflies have shown decreases in
abundance after clear-cut logging events (Hill and others
1995), openings in forests or changes created by roadways
and paths often show higher butterfly abundances than
nearby forests (Pollard and others 1975). It has also been
shown that the butterfly community structure changes in
response to successional changes from grasslands to forests
in Europe (Erhardt and Thomas 1991). These studies sug-
gest the potential for both an immediate and a long-term
response to ponderosa pine restoration. For example, but-
terfly diversity and abundances could initially decrease in
response to logging and ecosystem disturbance, then in-
crease in abundance and diversity with the increasing
herbaceous community.
The study presented here was initiated to establish the
response of butterflies to ecological restoration treatments
and potential mechanisms of that response. If changes in
butterfly communities are noted, future studies will exam-
ine the role of butterflies as bioindicators of invertebrate
pollinator groups.
Research Questions
To address the usefulness of butterflies as indicators of
restoration treatments, this paper specifically addresses the
questions:
1. Does the butterfly community differ between ponde-
rosa pine restoration treatment units and untreated forest?
2. What are potential mechanisms of these differences:
(a) Are nectar resources distributed differently? (b) Are host
plants distributed differently? (c) Does butterfly habitat
preference explain butterfly distribution?
3. Finally, do butterflies show a successional response to
restoration treatments?
Methods _______________________
Study Site
The study site used for this research is a ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa) and Gambel oak (Querqus gambelii)
forest located between Mt. Logan and Mt. Trumbull, about
35 km north of the Grand Canyon on the Arizona Strip. This
land is currently managed by the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment, and falls within the newly designated Grand Canyon-
Parashant National Monument. Mt. Logan, Mt. Trumbull
and the surrounding highlands form a sky island of ponde-
rosa pine, with desert grassland to the north and the Grand
Canyon to the south. The nearest ponderosa pine forest is
about 100 km east, on the Kaibab Plateau. The elevation of
the sky island ranges from 1,675 m to 2,620 m. The area
receives an average of 40–45 cm of rainfall annually, and
contains some of the biota of the Great Basin (Utah Flora
1986), in addition to the flora of northern Arizona (Kearney
and Peebles 1951). The forest is predominately ponderosa
pine, although Gambel oak composes 15 percent of the
overstory. Other tree species in the area include aspen
(Populus tremuloides), pinyon (Pinus edulis), juniper
(Juniperus osteospermus), and New Mexican locust (Robinia
neomexicanus). Although New Mexican locust is classified
as a shrub, it grows to tree stature at this site, and is sampled
as a tree. The understory component is dominated by sage-
brush (Artemesia tridentata), and shows evidence of inva-
sion by nonnative species, such as cheatgrass (Bromus
tectorum) and wheatgrasses (Agropyron spp.). Although 150
herbaceous species have been documented at Mt. Trumbull
since the late 1990s (J.D. Springer, personal communica-
tion), the forest floor cover prior to restoration treatments
was 70 percent litter and duff, with only 15 percent of the
cover represented by understory species.
Approximately 1,450 ha of the 5,000-ha forest is targeted
for restoration treatment (Covington and others l995), and
as of 1999, approximately 200 ha had been thinned and
burned. This restoration project is jointly sponsored by the
BLM, the Arizona Game and Fish Department, and North-
ern Arizona University Ecological Restoration Institute.
The ponderosa pine ecosystem restoration project takes an
adaptive management approach, so that results from initial
treatments can be incorporated into later treatments. The
actual treatments in place are therefore continuing to evolve.
At this site, analysis of fire scars provided a fire exclusion
date (in other words, the date of the last widespread fire) of
1870. All treatment sites incorporate thinning trees to
densities resembling those at the time of fire exclusion.
Trees established at the time of fire exclusion are retained,
as well as younger “replacement” trees for presettlement era
trees that have died since fire exclusion. Fire is used prelimi-
nary to help reduce slash, and then will be returned to the
landscape every 4–7 years, depending on weather condi-
tions. For complete details of the treatment, please see the
1996 Annual Report to BLM. Treatment of all 1,450 ha is to
be completed by 2002.
Butterfly Sampling
Butterfly monitoring data presented in this paper were
taken from two units treated in 1996 (Lava Unit) and in 1998
(Trick Tank Unit). Butterfly monitoring transects (Pollard
1977) were established in the two treatment units, and were
paired with monitoring transects in untreated forests (con-
trol) adjacent to each unit. Transects were placed 50 m from
unit boundaries to minimize edge effects and were at least
50 m apart. Although length of transects varied with total
treatment unit size to maintain buffer from edges, lengths of
the paired treatment-control transects were the same.
Transects in the Lava unit totaled 450 m in each the
treatment and the control; transects in the Trick Tank unit
totaled 600 m in each the treatment and the control for a
total of 2,100 m per survey.
Transects were monitored every week, between May and
September of 1999. Diurnal butterflies are very sensitive to
cool and windy conditions, often limiting their flights on
cloudy, cool days, thereby reducing chance of observation.
Therefore, sampling was done between 1,000 and 1,600
hours, on days warmer than 17 ∞C, with winds less than
10 mph, and mostly sunny skies (Pollard 1977). A total of
5 minutes per 100 m was spent looking for butterflies.
Butterfly species encountered on each transect were recorded,
along with location along transect, and lateral distance from

transect (perpendicular to transect). In addition for each
observation, we recorded behavior (in other words, nectaring,
basking, flying), and if collected. If the butterfly could not be
identified in flight, attempts were made to capture and
collect the insect. The timed portion of the survey corre-
sponded only to the observations and did not include time
spent in pursuit of a butterfly.
Nectar Resources and Host Plant
Distribution and Habitat Preferences
To quantify nectar resources and host plant distribution,
vegetation along the butterfly monitoring transects were
monitored in 1-m2 plots every 20 m along the established
transect. A total of 30 plots were sampled in both the Trick
Tank treatment and the nearby control, and 23 plots were
sampled in both the Lava treatment and its adjacent control.
Plots were monitored three times during the summer: May,
June and August. At each plot, flowering and nonflowering
plants were tallied by species. In addition, total number of
flowers per 1-m2 plots was tallied. These data were summa-
rized by unit and treatment to determine differences in
flowering plant species richness and host plant abundance.
Habitat preferences for each butterfly were determined
from the literature, predominately Scott (1984). All butter-
fly observations from both units and the entire season were
then grouped into habitat preference classes. Total tallies
are presented here. No statistical analysis was done because
data were lumped, resulting in no replication.
Successional Response to Restoration
To address whether butterflies show a successional
response to restoration, we compared the butterfly commu-
nities from Lava and Trick Tank units, using the same
monitoring data from above. The Lava unit was treated in

and composition were compared.
Results ________________________
Thirty-three butterfly species were collected at the Mt.
Trumbull site in 1999 (table 1). The most common of these
included the silver-spotted skipper (Epargyreus clarus,
EPCL), the Gambel oak dusky-wing (Erynnis telemachus,
ERTE), the silvery blue (Glaucopsyche lygdamus, GLLY),
the orange sulfur (Colias eurytheme, COEU), and the check-
ered white (Pieris protodice, PIPR). The butterflies used a
range of hostplants, including legumes, mustards, various
shrubs, shrub-trees (New Mexican locust) and trees (oak).
Butterfly Community Response

Tank treatment and control units. Common species were
observed in both control and restoration treatment units but
were seen more often in restoration treatments. Rare species
(such as Heliopetes ericetorum) were observed in restoration
treatments, when seen.
Butterfly abundance was also significantly greater in
restoration treatment areas as in adjacent control forests
(Repeated Measures ANOVA, F = 7.98, p = 0.106). Four to
eight times as many butterflies were observed in treatment
units as in adjacent controls on any given survey date. As
shown in table 2, silver-spotted skipper (Epargyreus clarus)
was the most common species observed, and was observed
five times as frequently in the treatment unit as in the
control units. Pieris species (whites) where highly abundant
in the area, but were observed only once in the control units.
Only one butterfly showed higher abundances in the control
units than in the treatment units. The Arizona sister
(Limenitis bredowii) was rare in 1999 but was observed 10
times in control units and only four times in treatment units.
This pattern for the Arizona sister is consistent with 1998
data (Waltz and Covington 1999).
Nectar Resource Richness
and Abundance
We examined potential mechanisms for increased butter-
fly species richness and abundance in treated forests. From
the 1-m2 plots surveyed along butterfly transects, we com-
pared the species richness, species abundance, and flower
abundance of the plants that were flowering at the time of
survey. Number of flowering species (species richness) was
significantly greater in treatment vegetation plots than in

control vegetation plots (fig. 2, Kruskal-Wallis test (effects =
survey and trt), treatment Z = 5.45, p < 0.05). In addition,
flowering plant abundance (or number of plants) was also
significantly greater (fig. 3, Kruskal-Wallis, treatment Z =
5.50, p < 0.05). Not surprisingly, abundance of flowers per
1-m2 plot was also significantly greater in treated units, with
up to 200 times as many flowers in 1-m2 plots (Kruskal-
Wallis, Z = 5.77, p < 0.05). These results showed that both a
higher diversity of plants and a higher total number of
plants were flowering in restoration treatment units.

represent proportion of observed butterflies only, lumped

Alternative methods are planned to adequately assess host
plant distributions in treatment and control units.
Data on habitat preference and host plant preference are
reported only as observed trends, and will be used to gener-
ate hypotheses to be tested in future field seasons. The
highest proportion of the butterflies observed in control
units were species preferring wooded habitat (fig. 4a). The
highest proportion of the butterflies observed in treatment
units were species preferring woods/open habitat (fig. 4b).
Host plant preferences also displayed interesting trends.
Butterfly species that hosted on tree species made up the
highest proportion of the butterflies observed in the control
areas. Alternatively, butterfly species hosting on legumes
and forbs made up the highest proportion of the butterflies
observed in the treatment areas. Basically, the butterfly
species observed in control areas were species that preferred
wooded habitat, and most often were species that hosted on
tree species. Butterflies observed in treated areas were
species that preferred more open habitat, and most often
were species that hosted on legumes or forbs. Because of lack
of sample size, the variables habitat preference and host
plant type were not statistically tested. These results repre-
sent proportional trends only.
Butterfly Community Successional
Response to Restoration
Figure 5 displays the butterfly species richness data
across surveys between the Lava unit (3-years posttreat-
ment) and the Trick Tank unit (1-year posttreatment).
Because we observed only one unit for each successional
stage, these data are presented as trends. Although some
trend exists toward higher numbers of species in the 3-year
posttreatment unit, we cannot assess those differences with
only one sampling unit per successional stage. Plant commu-
nities shift from an annual forb community in 1-year post-
treatment units to more perennial forbs and grasses in the
3-year posttreatment unit (Springer, personal communica-
tion). We did see increases in diversity of flowering species

in the 3-year posttreatment unit compared with the 1-year
posttreatment unit. Future studies will be designed to in-
crease sample size and address the successional response of
butterflies to ecological restoration.
Discussion _____________________
We have shown that the butterfly community had higher
species richness and abundance in restoration treatments
when compared with adjacent control forests. We also sug-
gest that species with low abundance are more often found
in treated units than in control units. Ponderosa pine resto-
ration treatments alter habitat by opening up tree canopies
and increasing herbaceous production. The fast responses of
butterflies to these changes (within one season after treat-
ment) suggest that arthropods may be one of the first
responders to ecological changes. Erhardt and Thomas (1991)
also documented butterfly responses to plant successional
changes, showing butterfly community changes even before
plant community changes could be detected. While some
studies show that butterflies decrease after logging events
(Hill and others 1995), the logging monitored in those cases
was clear-cutting, with little regard for understory estab-
lishment. Our results agree with several studies that show
gaps created in forest canopies increase butterfly abun-
dances, whether through increased host plant diversity, or
changes in microhabitats (abiotic variables) (Pollard 1977;
Pollard and others 1975; Holl 1996).
The mechanistic hypotheses we examined to explain but-
terfly distributions suggest nectar resource availability may
contribute greatly to adult butterfly distribution patterns.
Our preliminary results showed large differences in avail-
able nectar resources in Lava and Trick Tank treatment
units, when compared with adjacent control forests. In-
creased nectar resources can be associated with disturbed
areas; many early successional plants are flowering forbs
(Springer 1998). Studies have shown that nectar resources
are important to adult oviposition selections. Host plants
are utilized only when sufficient adult resources (nectar) are
also available (Grossmueller and Lederhouse 1987; Murphy
1983). Successful butterfly habitat must therefore include
sufficient larval and adult food resources.
Our restoration treatments have much higher plant diver-
sity than control forests (Springer and others, this proceed-
ings), implicating a higher diversity of butterfly host plants
in these areas. Our results showed no differences in the host
plant distributions of five common butterflies between treat-
ment and control forests. However, the sampling method
used here was not designed for tree species, which act as host
plants for two of the most common butterflies. In addition,
the variability of plant abundance measured in these units
was also very high, suggesting plant distributions should be
measured on a greater than 1-m2 scale. Both reasons suggest
our current sampling method is not adequate to address
questions of host plant distributions.
Habitat preference may also contribute to butterfly com-
munity composition shifts. A habitat change from closed-
canopy, low plant diversity forests to open canopy grasslands
may also see a corresponding shift in butterfly community
composition. Our preliminary observations suggest that
butterflies found in treated forests were more likely to be
species preferring open habitat, requiring legume and forb
host plants. Conversely, butterflies observed in control for-
ests were more likely to be species preferring wooded habi-
tat, and hosting on tree species. Although we could not test
these patterns statistically, other papers have shown the
importance of habitat selection in community composition
(Ehrlich and Raven 1964; Ehrlich 1993; Erhardt and Thomas
1991).
Studies of the successional response of butterflies to resto-
ration may give insight to how fine of a scale butterflies can
respond to. The successional change in plant communities
following thinning and burning can be dramatic. In the
Lava unit, plant species richness increased from less than
5 species in 1995 to 7, 16,  and 20 species in posttreatment
years 1, 2, and 3 respectively. However, it may take longer
for these plant species to establish viable, reproducing
populations. Steffan-Dewenter and Tscharntke (1997) ob-
served successional responses of butterfly communities in
set-aside fields in Germany. Although species richness of the
butterfly communities did not change through 4 years of
agricultural field succession, the butterfly community com-
position did show differences. If butterfly communities can
show responses at these yearly scales, they may be very
useful indicators of successional stage following a distur-
bance or a restoration treatment.
Problems/Confounding Factors
These results are from a small sample size (two units with
paired controls) and should be treated as preliminary, but at
the same time suggest more rigorous studies are validated.
Currently, a paired block design is set up to monitor butter-
fly response to restoration treatments and mechanisms of
these responses. This increased sample size should help
reduce this problem in future studies.
To successfully examine butterfly population responses to
restoration treatments, reproductive success and host plant
usage should also be documented. Our current design moni-
tors only adult butterfly populations. However, studies have
shown positive correlations between adult butterfly densi-
ties and larval densities, suggesting monitoring of adult
butterflies may provide a close indication of larval densities
(Steffan-Dewenter and Tscharntke 1997). Of the 20 species
recorded in the Lava and Trick Tank units and associated
controls, 12 were classified as locally distributed, not rang-
ing far from their host plants as adults (Scott 1984).
Implications
The response of butterfly communities suggests other
arthropod herbivores may respond to restoration treat-
ments in similar ways. Arthropods constitute the largest
biomass of any taxon and occupy a large range of functional
niches (Kremen and others 1993). Bees and other nectar or
pollen feeding arthropods may show increases in diversity
and abundance as a response to increased nectar resources,
and therefore may parallel the responses of the butterfly
community. The importance of pollinators to ecosystem
function has recently become the focus of many questions,
due to the decreasing abundance of native bees (Buchmann
and Nabhan 1996; Kevan 1999). Although butterflies are not

as efficient at pollination as the Hymenoptera (bees and
wasps) or Diptera (flies) (Scoble 1992), they are easier to
monitor and identify. In addition, arthropods decompose
organic material, release nutrients back into the ecosystem,
and provide the largest food source in almost every ecosys-
tem (Wilson 1987).
Using these restoration experiments, the efficacy of but-
terflies as biodiversity indicators of these other arthropods
can easily be tested, by increased sampling of other taxo-
nomic groups, correlations, and finally testing in other areas
undergoing restoration treatments.
The research presented here provides insight into how the
butterfly community responds to habitat change, and some
of the mechanisms behind that response. Not only do butter-
fly communities contribute to ecosystem functioning through
herbivory, providing food source and pollination events,
they also have the potential to be bioindicators of biodiver-
sity in other arthropod guilds.

Habitat Associations of the Sagebrush
Lizard (Sceloporus graciosus): Potential
Responses of an Ectotherm to Ponderosa
Pine Forest Restoration Treatments
Shawn C. Knox

Abstract—Little is known about the response of ectotherms to
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) restoration treatments. The
ambient body temperature of an ectotherm affects its physiology,
development, and behavior. Microhabitat availability and heteroge-
neity are critical factors in determining which thermoregulation
choices are available to a terrestrial ectotherm (Stevenson 1985).
Forest restoration treatments (for example, thinning and burning)
will alter herpetofauna microhabitats by decreasing tree canopy
cover and allowing more sunlight penetration to the forest floor.
This change could, depending on the species, have positive or
negative effects on the populations of the area. We sampled micro-
habitat use by Sceloporus graciosus (sagebrush lizards) in northern
Arizona at Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument using
standard “pitfall-array” sampling methodology. Univariate analy-
ses were used to relate lizard abundance to ponderosa pine tree
density, percent soil cover, percent rock cover, litter depth, and
insect density. In a multivariate analysis, ponderosa pine density
(negatively correlated) and bare soil cover (positively correlated)
were the best predictors of lizard abundance. Restoration treat-
ments will increase small-scale heterogeneity within S. graciosus
territories by increasing accessibility into and out of sunlight. Based
on the thermoregulatory demands of this species, these changes
should benefit S. graciosus. However, other possible indirect effects
of restoration treatments such as increases in predation on lizards
(due to greater visibility), as well as changes in food availability,
could negatively impact lizard populations. Future research should
focus on pre- and postrestoration treatment monitoring
of herpetofauna, and on the direct effects of fire on herpetofauna
populations within restoration sites.
Introduction ____________________
Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest restoration is an
experimental management practice currently being applied
in the Southwest. This practice varies depending on the
management objectives, but generally consists of some com-
bination of forest thinning and prescribed burning. Covington
and others (1997) has shown increases in: (1) forest floor
sunlight penetration, and (2) herbaceous productivity
(grasses, forbs, and shrubs) among restoration-treated pon-
derosa pine stands. These changes are expected to benefit
the fauna of the area, although the direct effects of forest
thinning and prescribed fire are poorly represented in scien-
tific literature.
Data from Germaine (1999), in an ongoing restoration
study at Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument,
suggest that lizards of the Sceloporus genus (Sceloporus
graciosus and Sceloporus undulatus) are more abundant in
areas with lower ponderosa pine density. This suggests that
restoration treatments could result in higher densities of
these Sceloporus lizards. However, studies of herpetofauna
responses to ponderosa pine restoration before and after
treatment do not currently exist.
The direct effects of fire on herpetofauna populations are
also poorly understood. Cunningham and others (2000)
pitfall-trapped lizards in burned and unburned chaparral
and Madrean evergreen forests the year following a high-
intensity wildfire, and captured primarily immature liz-
ards. Subsequent trapping over the following two seasons
resulted in higher species richness, diversity, and capture
rates, indicating rapid settlement of the burned area by
adjacent residents. Lizard genera represented in this study
included Sceloporus undulatus and numerous Cnemidoph-
orus species.
A few studies have shown that certain lizard species of
fire-dependent ecosystems, such as long-leaf pine (Mushinsky
1985), chaparral (Lillywhite 1977a,b), and sandpine scrub
(Greenberg 1993), increase in diversity or density following
fire. Both Mushinsky (1985) and Greenberg (1993) found
that some lizards of the genus Eumeces remained more
abundant in control areas (unburned and unharvested for at
least 20 years in both cases). It is apparent that different
species have different thermoregulatory demands and
should be addressed on a species-specific basis.
In this study we identified current forest condition
microhabitat characteristics of the sagebrush lizard (Sce-
loporus graciosus) in a Southwestern ponderosa pine forest.

Microhabitat preferences for this species were determined,
based on habitat variation within the study area. Potential
responses of S. graciosus to restoration treatments were
determined by extrapolating habitat relationships from cur-
rent condition forests to conditions expected in treated forest
areas. In the future, these data will be further applied to a
long-term study measuring the posttreatment effects of
restoration on the age structure, composition, and abun-
dance of this lizard population.
Methods _______________________
The study site was in northern Arizona at Grand Canyon-
Parashant National Monument. The elevation ranges from
approximately 2,080 m to 2,290 m, and the area is comprised
primarily of ponderosa pine forest, with abundant sage-
brush meadows. During May and June of 1999, prerestoration
treatment microhabitat data were collected from 56 pitfall
arrays. Arrays consisted of four 5-gallon buckets buried in a
“peace-sign” configuration (Jones 1986). Each array in-
cluded three wire mesh drift fences radiating out 7 m from
the center bucket, connected to the other three buckets (fig. 1).
Arrays were opened and checked every third day, for a total
of 168 trap days. At each array, percent soil cover, percent
rock cover, litter depth, and insect density were sampled
within a 1 m circular radius surrounding each bucket. Insect
density was sampled along four 1 m transects per bucket.
The data were collected at timed intervals of 10 seconds per
transect, scanning the entire transect length. All insects
within the top 2.54 cm of litter were tallied during sampling.
Germaine (1999) gathered percent coniferous canopy clo-
sure and ponderosa pine density at each array. Coniferous
canopy closure was measured at four transects as 40 “hits”
or “misses”, out to a 25 m radius, originating from the center
of each array. Ponderosa pine stem density was measured in
a 6 m belt running N-S and E-W across each array.
Values for each microhabitat variable collected were aver-
aged for each array. We used stepwise linear regression
analyses, with entry and exit levels of alpha = 0.15, to
identify those habitat variables that, in combination, were
associated with lizard abundance (Sokal and Rohlf 1981;
SAS Institute Inc. 1985). Spearman correlations were used
to determine univariate relationships between lizard abun-
dance and microhabitat variables that were selected in
multivariate models (SAS Institute Inc. 1985). Those micro-
habitat variables that were not normally distributed, or
with unequal variance, were transformed by taking the
square root of each variable (Sabin and Stafford 1990).
We calculated the Mallow’s Cp statistic to select the best
fitting model. This statistic is a measure of total squared
error for each model and should be approximately equal to
the number of parameters (including the intercept) in the
model to choose a parsimonious model (Younger 1979:
493–495).
Results ________________________
Three species of lizards were captured during the trapping
period. Captures consisted of Sceloporus graciosus (n = 81),
Eumeces skiltonianus (n = 4), and Sceloporus undulatus
(n = 1). S. graciosus abundance ranged from 0 to 9 (± 2.06)
captures per array. Ponderosa pine density ranged from 0 to
1,968 (± 466.84) trees per hectare. Bare soil cover ranged
from 0 to 91.25 (± 18.84) percent per array. Results from the
stepwise linear regression analyses are presented for
Sceloporus graciosus (table 1). The best model for explaining
the variation in S. graciosus abundance contained the vari-
ables of ponderosa pine density (trees/ha) and percent bare
soil cover:
S. graciosus abundance = 1.78 – 0.06
(ponderosa pine density) + 0.24 (percent bare soil cover)
C(p) = 2.16
This model explained 34 percent of the variance. Ponderosa
pine density was negatively correlated with S. graciosus
abundance (fig. 2). S. graciosus abundance peaked in areas
that contained 50–200 ponderosa pine trees/ha. Bare soil
cover was positively correlated with lizard abundance (fig. 3).

Discussion _____________________
This study indicates the need for small-scale heterogene-
ity within Sceloporus graciosus territories. Contiguous, ho-
mogeneous, fire-suppressed ponderosa pine forests inhibit
adequate sunlight penetration to the forest floor. This can
reduce sunlight accessibility for ectothermic animals with
small home ranges, such as most lizards and snakes, which
rely upon solar heat for metabolic processes and mobility.
Previous research has established that current South-
western ponderosa pine forests contain much higher densi-
ties of ponderosa pine than were present in these same
forests before Euro-American settlement (Cooper 1960;
Covington and Moore 1994b). This suggests that sunlight
penetration to the forest floor has also decreased during this
period due to large increases in ponderosa pine densities.
Covington and others (1997) have shown that forest restora-
tion treatments, through reduction in forest tree density and
prescribed fire, do in fact open up the canopy and create a
more open, parklike landscape. Restoration, carried out
through these means, will enhance the thermoregulation
options available to S. graciosus by lowering litter accumu-
lations (which will provide easier access to burrows), and
ultimately increasing accessibility into and out of sunlight.
Ponderosa pine forest restoration treatments, implemented
on an adaptive management basis, have potential to increase
the habitat suitability of some terrestrial ectotherms by
increasing small-scale heterogeneity. Thinning dense stands
of ponderosa pine will not only allow more sunlight penetra-
tion, but will also create a more patchy distribution of
sunlight at the ground layer level. Results of this study
suggest that optimal S. graciosus habitat for thermoregula-
tion would entail leaving between 50–400 trees/ha after
forest thinning treatments.
It is important to recognize the many other factors that
could change as a result of restoration treatments, which
may inadvertently affect S. graciosus. Lawrence (1966)
found increases in predatory birds and mammals after a
chaparral fire in the Sierra Nevada foothills. Increases in
predation and competition, as well as changes in food avail-
ability, may also play significant roles in the postrestoration
habitat of terrestrial ectotherms.
We were able to explain one-third of the variance in
sagebrush lizard abundance. Possible explanations for the
lack of a model that explains a considerable amount of the
variance can be attributed to several factors: (1) It is possible
that the collective contribution of several microhabitat vari-
ables determines the success of the animal. (2) There is a
high degree of difficulty associated with accurately sam-
pling small-scale heterogeneity within the small territories
of Sceloporus lizards. (3) The sample size could have been too
small. (4) The length of the sampling period could have been
too short. (5) Thorough seasonal population representation
of an animal that spends two-thirds of its life below ground
is questionable.
Suggestions for future research include the need for de-
tailed behavioral studies that capture common behavior
patterns of these lizards. Other recommendations include
the need to obtain larger sample sizes, as well as long-term
(>5 years) studies. Studies on the direct effects of fire on
lizard fitness are essential to correctly understand which
scale and intensity of prescribed fires to use in restoration
treatments.
Although no studies exist that measure lizard responses
directly to forest restoration before and after treatment, we
hope that this study will encourage additional research. In
those ecosystems where restoration treatments increase
sunlight availability to the forest floor, terrestrial ecto-
therms can be significant indicators of thermal change. Data
from this and related studies need to be incorporated into
future restoration treatment prescriptions to ensure that
habitat needs are met for all native wildlife species during
forest restoration activities.

Abstract—Conflicts over changing demands on our increasingly
scarce stands of late successional ponderosa pine could be abated by
increasing the proportion of stands with late successional attributes
in the forest land base. However, we don’t know whether these
attributes can be developed through the management of younger
stands. Nor do we know whether late successional stands can be
managed to perpetuate these values through time. To answer these
questions, two long-term large-scale studies were begun to study
ecosystem responses to a series of silvicultural treatments that
include timber harvest and prescribed fire. In one study, treat-
ments are designed to test several pathways toward late succes-
sional forest attributes in a young, even-aged stand. In the other
study a treatment is aimed at sustaining an existing late succes-
sional stand and contrasting the response of that ecosystem with
that of a young, even-aged stand. Although not yet completely
installed, the stand structure in one treatment resembles two late
successional stands with periodic fire.
Conflicts over changing demands on our increasingly
scarce stands with late seral structures often leave forest
managers faced with difficult decisions. One obvious way to
abate these conflicts would be to increase the number of
stands in the forest land base with late seral attributes, such
as large trees, snags, large down woody debris, multiple
canopy layers, associated shrub, herb, and grass compo-
nents and canopy gaps. However, it is not known which
active management strategy could speed development of
these attributes in younger stands, nor is it known whether
we can manage late seral structures to perpetuate their
values through time. In addition to concerns about esthetics,
biodiversity, and sustainable productivity, stands with late
seral attributes often contain the most valuable timber and
critical wildlife habitat.
To address these questions, we began two long-term
large-scale studies in the interior ponderosa pine (Pinus

ponderosa) forests of northeastern California. The primary
objective of the study on the Goosenest Adaptive Manage-
ment Area (GAMA) is to accelerate late successional at-
tributes in a young-growth stand (Ritchie and Harcksen
1999). One of the objectives of the study located on the Blacks
Mountain Experimental Forest (BMEF) is to sustain late
successional attributes in stands threatened by the ab-
sence of fire (Oliver and Powers 1998). The inception of
effective fire control about 1930 at both BMEF and GAMA
has resulted in dense stands with a higher proportion of
white fir. Before 1930, the median fire return interval at
BMEF was about 7 years (personal communication with
C. N. Skinner, September 19, 2000). Although data are not
yet available for GAMA, we expect the interval to be similar.
Neither site has experienced wildfire since 1930. Many
stands have suffered severe mortality from competition
exacerbated by drought. At BMEF, intense competition has
accelerated the demise of the large old trees. Similar shifts
in species composition and stand structure resulting from
fire suppression have been reported in the San Bernardino
Mountains of southern California (Minnich and others 1995).
At GAMA, the resulting buildup of fuels has caused fire
hazard to become so extreme that long-term protection of
the forests seems virtually impossible.
Both sites are ideally suited for a large-scale, ecological
research project. Both sites provide enough land for
operational-scale studies on areas dedicated to research.
Plots can be large enough to monitor treatment effects on
small mammals and passerine birds. But the large size of
each unit, a minimum of 100 acres, made spatial control on
the ground necessary to integrate data collected at different
scales across disciplines. It was accomplished by a perma-
nently monumented grid on 328-ft (100-m) centers through-
out each unit to which all measurements and other activities
are referenced.
We struggled as a team with treatment descriptions and
how to translate our idea of what an interior ponderosa pine
forest looked like when fire was part of the ecosystem.
Although we knew of the aggregated stand structure exist-
ing in late seral ponderosa pine stands from silvicultural
studies at BMEF (Hallin 1959) and from studies in northern
Arizona (Cooper 1961; White 1985), we did not attempt to
reconstruct them as did Harrod and others (1999) in cen-
tral Washington. At BMEF, the method was too time con-
suming for the large area to be treated. At GAMA, no clues
to the original structure existed in the young-growth stand.

and others 1995) that provided data on stands about 20

years after initiation of effective fire control (fig. 1) were
most relevant for diameter distributions, as were data from
the Beaver Creek Pinery (fig. 2). This stand of ponderosa
pine and California black oak (Quercus kellogii) on the west-
side of the Sierra Nevada never has had effective fire
protection. Although the Beaver Creek Pinery is in an
environment very different from BMEF, we believed that
the stand structure resulting from three wildfires in the
1990s was instructive.
Goosenest Adaptive Management
Area Research Project ___________
The Goosenest Adaptive Management Area, within the
Klamath National Forest, lies on the north side of the
Medicine Lake Highlands—an area of recent volcanics run-
ning east from Mt. Shasta. The entire Adaptive Manage-
ment Area is clothed in 60- to 80-year-old forest, composed
primarily of ponderosa pine and white fir in dense stands
containing about 230 trees and 170 ft2 of basal area per acre.
The U.S. Forest Service acquired the area in the 1950s from
the Long Bell Lumber Company, the successor to the Weed
Lumber Company of Weed, California. Long Bell logged
these stands in the 1920s and 1930s via railroad. Very few
merchantable trees were left standing. After logging, pine
and fir regenerated abundantly. Also at about that time the
area was brought under effective wildfire control.
Project Description
The overall research objective is to test silvicultural prac-
tices that may accelerate development of late successional
forest characteristics in young growth stands, utilizing par-
tial cutting and prescribed fire. Active management has the
potential to reduce the hazard of wildfire and to accelerate
development of late successional attributes, but a precise
pathway for this development is unknown. Therefore, treat-
ments were designed to place the forest on various stand
development trajectories toward what are commonly con-
ceived as late successional attributes (table 1). The path-
ways to late successional attributes are:
• No treatment—In reality this treatment is minimal
management because fire prevention and fire suppres-
sion activities will continue as before. This provides an
inactive management strategy for comparison with the
other three pathways.
• Accelerate late successional large trees without
fire—A major late successional attribute, large trees,
should be created most rapidly by this treatment. Trees
left following treatment are spaced 18 to 25 ft apart and
are the largest, regardless of species. Fuel reduction is
by mechanical methods not by prescribed fire, because
of the danger of killing the white fir.
• Accelerate late successional pine without fire—
We recognized that late successional stands in the area
had a much greater proportion of ponderosa pine than
exists today and that tree spacing was clumpy. To
achieve these attributes we left all dominant and co-
dominant ponderosa pines regardless of spacing, saving
only white firs larger than 30 inches in diameter at
breast height (d.b.h.) and those where no pines were
present. We further increased the proportion of pine in
this initial entry by removing clumps of decadent white
fir and regenerating with pine. Our goal is to have
ponderosa pine comprise 80 percent of the stems. Pre-
scribed fire is withheld to investigate whether mechani-
cal methods will be an effective surrogate.
• Accelerate late successional pine with fire—The
same treatment as the previous one plus the restoration
of the function of frequent low intensity fires by periodi-
cally igniting controlled fires.

Blacks Mountain Ecological
Research Project ________________
 Blacks Mountain Experimental Forest is located within
the Lassen National Forest in northeastern California.
Typical of vast areas of the interior ponderosa pine forest
type, BMEF has two major age classes—a scattered over-
story of 300- to 500-year-old pines and a dense understory
of pines and white fir that originated about when intensive
livestock grazing ended and when effective wild fire sup-
pression began. An intermediate age class of 200-year-old
trees is largely absent. Portions of BMEF had been har-
vested by a Methods-of-Cutting study between 1938 and
1947 (Dolph and others 1995), but much surrounding forest
remained unlogged. At present an average acre contains
331 trees with a basal area of 144 ft2.
Project Description
A major objective of the Blacks Mountain project is to
determine if existing late seral attributes can be sustained
and possibly enhanced by active management. Two forest
structures, which we termed High Structural Diversity and
Low Structural Diversity, were created with and without
cattle grazing and prescribed fire on 12 units of 250 acres
each. High Structural Diversity is characterized by the
presence of many large, old trees, abundant snags, multiple
canopy layers with dense clumps of smaller trees, and many
small gaps in the canopy. Low Structural Diversity, created
to provide an extreme contrast, is characterized by a single
canopy layer of well-spaced pole- and small sawtimber-sized
trees and few, large gaps in the canopy. Our objective was
not to test the classic silvicultural systems of even-aged and
uneven-aged management. Rather, the High Structural
Diversity treatment was designed to improve the health and
longevity of the large, old trees and create a multilayered
forest, but not necessarily three or more age classes of trees.
The Low Structural Diversity treatment was designed to
provide the extreme contrast needed to determine if forest
structure influenced biodiversity and sustainable produc-
tivity (table 2).
The entire forest is included in grazing allotments. Thus,
six of the 12 units are fenced to exclude livestock. In each
unit prescribed fire is introduced to one half and excluded
from the other. We anticipate that a series of three burns,
closely spaced, will be needed to bring fuels to a maintenance
level. Each treatment (structural diversity x grazing) is
replicated three times in a randomized block design with fire
applied in split plots. Blocking is by proportion of white fir
because the proportion varies among units. Fir becomes
more common with increasing elevation and is a surrogate
for subtle site differences. Although the design does not
include untreated controls per se, four Research Natural
Areas well distributed within the BMEF will be studied,
also, to provide quantitative and qualitative information on
undisturbed systems.
Stand Structure Changes
at BMEF _______________________
Because both projects required the removal of large vol-
umes of wood over an extensive area—2,600 acres at GAMA
and 3,000 acres at BMEF—timber harvest was spread over
3 years with prescribed fire applied the fall following timber
harvest. All treatments have not been installed in either
project but we do have some posttreatment results from one
replication at BMEF.
The diameter distribution of the units in Block I at BMEF
before treatment demonstrate the exaggerated reverse “J”
shape—typical of interior pine stands developing without
fire (fig. 3). Seedlings and saplings make up 61 percent of
the stems. When the pole size classes are added, 96 percent
of all trees in the stands have originated since fire exclusion.
Although not shown in figure 3, much of the seedling,
sapling and pole-size components are white fir. The pre-
treatment inventory at GAMA shows a similar but less
exaggerated reverse “J” shape (fig. 4). At GAMA, a cooler
and moister site, white fir is more abundant.

In 1999, we measured the trees in BMEF Block I that had
all treatments (tree harvest and prescribed fire) installed.
The diameter distribution was altered dramatically by both
the low structural diversity treatment and prescribed fire.
Most of the seedlings, saplings, and small poles are gone,
leaving a shape best described as a normal distribution
skewed toward the larger diameters (fig. 5). Stand density as
measured by basal area was reduced from 122 ft2 per acre to
40 ft2 per acre. In sharp contrast, the high structural diver-
sity treatment without fire maintains the reverse “J” shape
diameter distribution because more of the smaller size
classes remain (fig. 6). Basal area reduction was much less
in the high structural diversity treatment—from 122 ft2 per
acre to 90 ft2 per acre. When prescribed fire was added to the
high structural diversity treatment, a skewed normal distri-
bution was formed because fire mortality was restricted to
the smaller trees. Basal area per acre was little affected. A
similar distribution was reported from reconstruction of
historic stands in central Washington (Harrod and others
1999).
We are pleased to discover that the diameter distribution
in this first block of the high structural diversity treatment
with fire at BMEF has begun to resemble the shape of the
diameter distribution of the stand in the Beaver Creek
Pinery (fig. 2). It also is beginning to resemble the distribu-
tion in 1939 of the unharvested plot in the Methods-of-
Cutting study (fig. 1). The major difference is that the modal
values for the distributions at Beaver Creek Pinery and the
1939 unharvested plot are higher—16 and 29 inches d.b.h.,
respectively. The modal value for the diameter distribution
of the high structural diversity with fire treatment is only 6
inches d.b.h.—a legacy of the dense understory originating
after fire exclusion and the demise of many of the large old
trees. With the program of planned periodic reentry of
prescribed fire, this modal value should rise.
Conclusions____________________
At BMEF, because some large old trees are still present,
we seem to be recreating a stand structure that resembles
interior ponderosa pine stands of a century ago in which fire
was an integral component of the ecosystem. Only one block
of the replicated experiment has been treated so far, there-
fore, firm conclusions must remain tentative. At GAMA no
large old trees are present. The present stand originated in
the absence of fire after the late seral stand was logged off.
Here we are testing pathways to achieving late seral at-
tributes. Some pathways may be more effective in achieving
late seral attributes and some may achieve them more
rapidly than others. Early results from BMEF suggest that
prescribed fire is a critical component. Maybe mechanical
treatments can achieve similar effects as prescribed fire. We
anxiously await results from the fire/fire surrogate study
described elsewhere in this conference proceedings.

Abstract—Compared to presettlement times, many ponderosa
pine forests of the United States are now more dense and have
greater quantities of fuels. Widespread treatments are needed in
these forests to restore ecological integrity and to reduce the risk of
uncharacteristically severe fires. Among possible restorative treat-
ments, however, the appropriate balance among cuttings, mechani-
cal fuel treatments, and prescribed fire is often unclear. Resource
managers need better information on the effects of alternative
practices such as fire and mechanical/manual “fire surrogates.” A
group of scientists and land managers has designed an integrated
national network of long-term research sites to address this need,
with support from the U.S. Joint Fire Science Program. Seven of the
11 sites in the network are in ponderosa pine-dominated Western
coniferous forests with low-severity natural fire regimes. The study
will assess a wide range of ecological and economic consequences of
four alternative restoration treatments: (1) cuttings and mechani-
cal fuel treatments alone; (2) prescribed fire alone; (3) a combination
of cuttings, mechanical fuel treatments, and prescribed fire; and (4)
untreated controls. The study is long term, with treatments re-
peated over time. Each site will have at least three replications of
the four treatments, applied to treatment units of at least 14 ha in
size (including buffer). Where feasible, the replicated units will be
supplemented by unreplicated large areas treated similarly to
study larger scale ecological and operational issues. A comprehen-
sive set of core variables will be measured at each site, including
aspects of fire behavior and fuels, vegetation, wildlife, entomology,
pathology, soils, and economics. The core design will allow inter-
disciplinary analysis at both the site and multisite scales. Investi-
gators at each site will also have the freedom to add treatments and/
or response variables to the core design as dictated by local inter-
ests, available resources, and expertise.

and fewer large trees, and have greater quantities of forest
fuels than did their presettlement counterparts (Bonnicksen
and Stone 1982; Chang 1996; Parker 1984; Parsons and
DeBenedetti 1979). Causes of these changes include fire
suppression, past livestock grazing and timber harvests,
and changes in climate (Arno and others 1997; Parsons and
DeBenedetti 1979; Skinner and Chang 1996). These changes
have caused a deterioration in forest ecosystem integrity,
and an increased probability of large, high-severity wildfires
(Dahms and Geils 1997; Patton-Mallory 1997; Stephens
1998; Weatherspoon and Skinner 1996). Reports from the
Blue Mountains of Oregon and Washington (Everett 1993),
the Columbia River Basin (Quigley and Cole 1997), and the
Sierra Nevada Ecosystem Project (SNEP 1996; Weatherspoon
and Skinner 1996) have highlighted these problems and
have explained the need for large-scale and strategically
located thinning (especially of small trees), fuel treatment,
and use of prescribed fire. A recent speech by Interior
Secretary Babbitt (2000) pointed out that similar problems
and the need for similar solutions are now being acknowl-
edged by national policymakers.
The need for widespread use of restorative management
practices is clear (for example, Hardy and Arno 1996). Less
clear, however, is the appropriate balance among cuttings,
mechanical fuel treatments, and prescribed fire (SNEP
1996; Stephens 1998; van Wagtendonk 1996; Weatherspoon
1996). Economic and technical feasibility of various treat-
ments, as well as social and political acceptability, are impor-
tant considerations in managers’ decisions about tools to use.
To achieve goals for ecosystem integrity and sustainability,
however, we also need better information about the ecologi-
cal consequences and tradeoffs of alternative restoration
practices. The frequent, low- to moderate-severity fires that
characterized presettlement disturbance regimes in many
of our ponderosa pine forests influenced not only forest
structure, composition, and fuels, but also a wide range of
other ecosystem components and processes (Agee 1993;
Chang 1996). What components or processes are changed or
lost, and with what effects, if “fire surrogates” such as
cuttings and mechanical fuel treatments are used instead of
fire, or in combination with fire? While there is considerable
information on the costs and ecological effects of both pre-
scribed fire and thinning treatments in Western forest
ecosystems (for example, see Walsted and others 1990), no
studies have directly compared these two methods in the
same place and at the same time.
Long-term, interdisciplinary research is needed to
quantify and compare the consequences and tradeoffs of
alternative fire and fire surrogate treatments. Ecological and
economic aspects must be included as integral components.

The research should be experimental, rather than retro-
spective or correlative, to permit stronger inferences about
cause-and-effect relationships. Through this research it
will be possible to determine which ecosystem functions of
fire can be emulated by other means, which may be irre-
placeable, and how much restoration will cost society. Such
an effort must be collaborative, involving land managers,
researchers, and interested public.
A team of scientists and land managers has designed an
integrated national network of long-term research sites to
address this need, with support from the USDI/USDA Joint
Fire Science Program (http://www.nifc.gov/joint_fire_sci/
index.html). The steering committee (see Acknowledgments)
and other participants in this national Fire-Fire Surrogate
(FFS) study represent a number of Federal and state agen-
cies, universities, and private entities, as well as a wide
range of disciplines and geographic regions. The 5-year study,
now funded by the Joint Fire Science Program, applies a
common experimental design over 13 sites nationally, with
each site representing a forest that is at risk of uncharacter-
istically severe wildfire (Weatherspoon 2000). This paper
focuses on the work as applied to eight of the sites in the
Western United States, all dominated by ponderosa pine
(fig. 1).

Alternative Ponderosa Pine Restoration Treatments in the Western United States
Objectives _____________________
The goal of the study, as it applies to the Western sites, is
to quantify the ecological and economic consequences of fire
and fire surrogate treatments in ponderosa pine-dominated
forests of the Western United States. The primary audience
for the study is land managers, the people who make the
decisions about which tools are most appropriate to use
under different circumstances. Objectives include:
1. Effects: Quantify the effects of fire and fire surrogate
treatments on a number of critical response variables in-
cluding (a) fuel and fire behavior, (b) vegetation, (c) soils
and forest floor, (d) wildlife, (e) entomology, (f) pathology,
and (g) treatment costs and utilization/economics.
2. Design: Provide a research design that (a) establishes
and maintains the study as an integrated national network
of long-term interdisciplinary research sites using a com-
mon “core” design, (b) allows each site to be independent for
purposes of statistical analysis and modeling, as well as
being a component of the national network, and (c) provides
flexibility for investigators of each research site to aug-
ment—without compromising—the core design to address
locally important issues and to exploit expertise and other
resources available to local sites.
3. Models: Develop and validate models of ecosystem
structure and function, and refine recommendations for
ecosystem management.
4. Relationships: Within the first 5 years of the study,
establish cooperative relationships, identify and establish
network research sites, collect baseline data, implement
initial treatments, document treatment costs, report re-
sults, and designate FFS research sites as demonstration
areas.
5. Database: Develop and maintain an integrated and
spatially referenced database to be used to archive data for
all network sites, and to allow interdisciplinary and meta-
analyses.
6. Monitoring: Identify and field test a suite of response
variables that are sensitive to the fire and fire surrogate
treatments and are technically feasible for use in manage-
ment contexts.
Research Approach _____________
Experimental Design
The FFS project can best be described as an operational
experiment, in which rigorous control is applied to a design
meaningful to managers. Thus while the experiment has
sufficient replication and control for each site to stand alone
statistically, the treatments, variables, and scales have been
chosen with the manager in mind. The treatments closely
match the options available for managers, the variables
chosen for study reflect those of greatest concern to manag-
ers, and the scale of the experimental units matches for the
most part the sizes of management units typically designed
by managers. In addition, the manner in which variables are
measured at each site facilitates an integrated analysis of
response for the range of variables, thereby providing the
kind of information managers need to assess tradeoffs among
the treatment options.
Treatments—Study treatments represent various com-
binations of the most common restoration activities used in
forested ecosystems: cutting trees or other vegetation,
using prescribed fire, and mechanically treating residues
or scarifying the soil. Four study treatments include those
that address widely shared concerns about forest health
and wildfire hazard, those that deal with environmental
concerns, and those most practical from an operational
standpoint:
1. Untreated control
2. Prescribed fire only, with periodic reburns
3. Initial and periodic cutting, each time followed by me-
chanical fuel treatment and/or physical removal of residue
4. Initial and periodic cutting, each time followed by
prescribed fire; fire alone also could be used one or more
times between cutting intervals
These four treatments also span the range of resto-
ration activities advocated by proponents of “structure
restoration” (treatment 3), “process restoration” (treat-
ment 2), or both (treatment 4) (Stephenson 1999).
Cuttings in treatments 3 and 4 will be repeated at inter-
vals appropriate to the forest type and site conditions—for
example, every 20 years. Periodic prescribed burns in treat-
ments 2 and 4 will be based on available information about
presettlement fire intervals for each research site. Irregu-
lar rather than fixed burn intervals are preferable where
supported by fire history evidence, as it seems likely that
important elements of ecosystem diversity were promoted
historically by natural variability in fire intervals (Agee
1993; Skinner and Chang 1996).
We recognize that treatment specifications can encom-
pass considerable variability in both cutting/mechanical
and fire treatments that may differentially affect ecological
responses of interest. While more precise specifications
would reduce treatment variability among sites, such preci-
sion is neither feasible or desirable across so diverse an
array of sites. The real world of forest ecosystems and
resource management would not be well served by such a
prescriptive approach. Flexibility in treatment specification
does, however, increase the need for: (1) local replication to
allow each research site to stand on its own statistically;
(2) a specified desired future condition (DFC) for each site to
help guide the application of treatments; and (3) careful
documentation of treatments actually applied at each re-
search site. We have defined a network-wide minimum
standard short-term DFC for the study, based on stand
resistance to wildfire:
Each noncontrol treatment shall be designed to achieve
stand and fuel conditions such that, if impacted by a head fire
under 80th percentile weather conditions, at least 80 percent
of the basal area of overstory (dominant and codominant)
trees will survive. The definition of 80th percentile weather
conditions will be based on an analysis of fire season condi-
tions, calculated for mid-afternoon, over a period of 10 to 20
years at the closest fire weather station. The prescription to
implement the treatment will be developed based on fire
behavior modeling (for example, FARSITE; Finney 1998) and
predicted fire effects. Effects will be predicted using tech-
niques such as FOFEM (First Order Fire Effects Model;
Reinhardt and others 1997) and/or other modeling efforts
that may include expert opinion.

Alternative Ponderosa Pine Restoration Treatments in the Western United States

This standard presumes the retention of a viable residual
stand following treatment (clearcutting would not be an
acceptable treatment option). The DFC will be well defined
and implemented using a specific prescription to ensure
consistency among treatment units. Each site DFC will
consider management goals appropriate to that site, to
stand conditions, and to the expectations of resource manag-
ers and other stakeholders. While early treatments may
focus on thinning from below, or the equivalent using a
series of burns, long-term restoration of historic stand
structure will require provisions for recruitment of tree
regeneration and development of a sustainable age-class
distribution. Although fire hazard reduction will be a
continuing emphasis for treatments, in the long run it is
expected that stand structure will be increasingly able to
accommodate wildfires that occur under the 80th percentile
weather conditions.
Assuming the same starting point of stand and fuel condi-
tions, moving toward a given DFC using the fire-only treat-
ment will clearly be much less precise than using cutting
treatments. For example, some desired changes in stand
structure—for example thinning relatively large trees with
fire without doing damage to the overall stand—may not be
feasible. However, use of innovative prescriptions, firing
techniques, and other methods such as stage burning may,
over successive burns, permit considerable progress toward
most DFCs using prescribed fire alone.
Replication and Plot Size—So that each site can be
analyzed independently, each treatment will be replicated
at least three times per site, using either a completely
randomized or randomized block design. The core set of four
treatments will thus be represented in 12 treatment units at
each of the eight ponderosa pine research sites.
Each of the 12 core treatment units at a research site will
consist of a 10-ha measurement unit, within which core
variables will be measured, surrounded by a 4-ha treated
buffer. The 10-ha unit size is a compromise between advan-
tages of smaller units (for example, reduced costs, reduced
within-unit variability) and those of larger units (for ex-
ample, the need to represent natural variability at an opera-
tional scale, and the need to accommodate some larger scale
ecological responses). The buffer, treated in the same way as
the measurement unit it surrounds, will have a width at
least equal to the height of a best-site potential tree. A 30-m
treated buffer, for example, would bring the total size of the
treatment unit to about 14 ha. Site participants will need to
determine appropriate separation of treatment units and
the nature of treatment in the matrix between units.
We recognize that many aspects of wider ranging wildlife
species, bark beetles, and some economic questions can be
studied at the 10-ha scale only indirectly—for example, via
habitat attributes and modeling methods. Where feasible at
a given research site, two additional approaches may help to
address larger scale issues: (1) Larger replicated treatment
units (for example, larger buffers) can be used, provided that
the core 10-ha units are embedded within them and are used
for measurement of core response variables. Additional,
larger scale variables could then be measured on the larger
treatment units. (2) The core 10-ha replicated units can be
augmented with much larger (200 to 400 ha or more),
generally unreplicated areas nearby treated to the same
specifications. These large treatment areas could provide
useful information concerning operational-scale economics
and practicability, as well as larger scale ecological re-
sponses, especially if linked to the smaller replicated units
via appropriate models.
Response Variables—Ecosystem management requires
an understanding of three interacting components: societal
expectations and desires, management costs and revenues,
and how management activities affect the ecology of whole
systems. The social component will be linked to the study
through other efforts funded by the Joint Fire Science
Program and others. The FFS study is focused on economics
and ecology and, because the study is directed toward
management, is designed to provide information on how the
whole system responds to treatment, such that managers
can assess tradeoffs. Because core response variables will be
measured at all network sites in a consistent way, we will be
able to provide a package of information on how forest
ecosystems of this kind respond to management. This is
critical in a world where a number of issues are debated
simultaneously for every parcel of land. For example, while
fuel reduction may lower fire hazard and risk, removing
down woody material will also reduce foraging habitat for
birds and macroinvertebrate species. Measuring both the
extent of fuel reduction and its effect on biodiversity may
help identify thresholds that would be useful for fine tuning
management to achieve more holistic objectives. In addition,
measuring the costs and revenues of fuel reduction provides
the kind of information that allows the manager to assess
tradeoffs on the application of alternative management
tools. Finally, applying this design to eight different sites
will provide more robust information to guide management
decisions on restoration of ponderosa pine forests.
Several members of our FFS steering committee (see
Acknowledgments) have been serving as disciplinary group
leaders with responsibility for developing major sets of
response variables (table 1). Each group leader has worked
with a team of people with appropriate expertise to identify
a core set of response variables and measurement protocols
to use at all research sites. Their activities also have in-
cluded cross-group coordination to ensure consistency, com-
patibility, and nonduplication of data collection efforts. As

project implementation proceeds, they will work to ensure
that data collection protocols are followed consistently at all
the sites. This may include training, oversight of field crews,
or other measures as appropriate.
Within-unit sampling of all variables will be keyed to a
50-m square grid of permanent sample points to be estab-
lished and maintained within each measurement unit. Any
number of grid points in a measurement unit may be used for
a given variable depending on the nature and appropriate
intensity of sampling for that variable. Referencing of all
data to the grid, coupled with digital orthophotography, will
facilitate spatial, interdisciplinary analysis.
Research Site Locations
Criteria for Site Selection—A network of research sites
using a common experimental design has the potential for
synergistic output exceeding what could be accomplished by
a series of separate, uncoordinated studies. In selecting
research sites we have developed and used the set of criteria
given in table 2.
Proposed Initial Sites—The proposed initial network
comprises 13 sites, each representing a forest with a histori-
cally short-interval, low- to moderate-severity fire regime.
Eight sites are in Western coniferous forests, ranging from
the Pacific Northwest to the Southwest (fig. 1). These sites
all share ponderosa pine as an important tree component,
but sites vary in composition of other conifers and differ

Abstract—The Upper South Platte Basin is a critical watershed in
Colorado. Nearly 80 percent of the water used by the 1.5 million
Denver metropolitan residents comes from or is transmitted through
this river drainage. The Colorado Unified Watershed Assessment
identified the Upper South Platte River as a Category 1 watershed
in need of restoration. Most of the river basin is located within the
Pike National Forest southwest of the city of Denver. The South
Platte River is also a major recreation area in Colorado and is highly
regarded for its trout fishery.
The Upper South Platte Watershed Protection and Restoration
Project was proposed in 1998 by Denver Water, the Colorado State
Forest Service, Colorado State University, the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency, and the USDA Forest Service to respond to concerns
about catastrophic disturbances in this watershed. The project is
addressing these concerns by focusing on landscape vegetation pat-
terns, soil erosion, and water quality within the Upper South Platte
River Basin.
Introduction ____________________
The Upper South Platte Watershed Project was initiated
in August 1998 to restore and protect the watershed. The
project involves an interagency partnership between the
USDA Forest Service, Colorado State Forest Service, Den-
ver Water Board, and Environmental Protection Agency.
These partners are concerned with continued soil and water
problems from the Buffalo Creek Fire of 1996 and the
potential for future fires to cause problems in other parts of
the watershed. The partners intend to use watershed resto-
ration as a guideline for management and project planning.
The Upper South Platte Protection and Restoration Project
will reduce the potential for adverse effects to water quality,
human life, and property by achieving the following goals:
• Reduce sediment, crown fires, and risks to property
• Create sustainable forest conditions in the Upper South
Platte River Basin
The partners intend to improve water quality by reducing
road and trail sediment, stabilizing stream channels, and
reducing noxious weeds. Using prescribed fires, natural
fires, mechanical vegetation treatments, and creating sus-
tainable forest conditions will also reduce the risk of high
intensity crown fires. Urban interface hazards will be re-
duced through educational programs and vegetation treat-
ment on private lands. Sustainable forest conditions will be
created by thinning stands, establishing openings, and main-
taining snags and down logs. Research from the Cheesman
historic forest landscape will guide the forest restoration
activities.
The project will begin in three sixth-level watersheds.
Restoration actions on public lands will focus in the Waterton/
Deckers and Horse Creek watersheds. The USDA Forest
Service, the Colorado Forest Service, and Denver Water will
coordinate with other Federal and State agencies, local
governments, and interested parties to plan, implement,
and monitor restoration projects in the Upper South Platte
River Basin. The partners involved in the Upper South
Platte Project will implement new methods of doing busi-
ness to protect watersheds that cross ownership or jurisdic-
tional boundaries.
Land, Water, and Ecosystems _____
Characterization
The Upper South Platte Basin is a critical watershed in
Colorado that encompasses about 1,000 square miles. Nearly
80 percent of the water used by the 2.5 million Denver
metropolitan residents comes from or is transmitted through
this river drainage. The Colorado Unified Watershed As-
sessment, as required in the Federal Clean Water Action
Plan, identified the Upper South Platte as a Category 1
watershed in need of restoration. Most of the basin is within
the Pike National Forest southwest of Denver, CO. The
South Platte River is also a major recreation area in Colo-
rado and is a highly regarded trout fishery.

Upper South Platte Watershed Protection and Restoration Project
Culver, Dean, Patten, and Thinnes
The Pike National Forest portion of the protected area
comprises about 500,000 acres. Private land in holdings
comprise about 100,000 acres; the State of Colorado owns
about 2,000 acres within the project area and manages
15,725 acres of Denver Water lands. The Bureau of Land
Management and the city of Aurora also manage lands
within the project area.
The Upper South Platte Project can be divided into three
major vegetation zones based on elevation. The montane
zone ranges from 6,500 to 10,000 feet in elevation and is
made up primarily of ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, and, in
the upper portions, lodgepole pine. About 450,000 acres are
in the montane zone. The subalpine zone ranges from 10,000
to 12,000 feet in elevation and comprises primarily lodgepole
pine, aspen, Engelmann spruce, and subalpine fir on about
150,000 acres. The alpine zone includes the areas above tree
line and primarily comprises alpine meadows, shrub land,
rock and pockets of bristlecone pine on about 50,000 acres.
The montane forests were intensively harvested in the late
1800s and early 1900s to supply mining needs, railroad ties,
and building materials. However, a 12-square-mile area of
montane forest was not logged and provides valuable infor-
mation for restoration guidelines.
Timber management today primarily involves the harvest
of dead wood for firewood. Most stands are mature, with 80
percent of the forested area in densely stocked, late seral
conditions. The principal wildlife species within the project
area are mule deer, elk, Merriam’s turkey, Abert’s squirrel
and Wilson’s warbler. The principal fish species are rainbow
trout, brown trout, cutthroat trout, brook trout, white sucker,
long nose sucker, and long nose dace. Wildlife viewing,
photography, hunting, and fishing are an important part of
many recreation activities.
Recreation in the Upper South Platte Project area in-
cludes sight-seeing, picnicking, camping, hiking, mountain
biking, motorcycle and ATV riding, cross-country skiing,
boating, fishing, and hunting. There are two designated
Wildernesses within the watershed, Lost Creek and Mount
Evans. Developed recreation facilities along the river corri-
dors include 20 campgrounds. In addition to the camp-
grounds on the South Platte River, there are several devel-
oped picnic areas and numerous trailheads and parking
sites. Use of the South Platte River and the adjacent uplands
has increased annually over the past decade. Recreation use
was estimated at 1,650,000 visitor days in 1995. This in-
crease is largely attributable to the rapid population growth
in the Denver metropolitan area and surrounding counties.
The population has been increasing about 2.5 percent annu-
ally or 40,000 people per year. In-migrating residents tend
to be active and affluent, giving rise to an increase in demand
for dispersed recreation activities.
Landscape Assessment
A recent Colorado Front Range Assessment identified
large areas along the Colorado Front Range where current
forest conditions and urban interface are not conducive with
the natural disturbance processes. The current forested
landscape does not reflect the historic disturbance regime
and is not sustainable. Fire suppression in the 20th century
has allowed smaller, thin-barked trees to reproduce. The
Upper South Platte forests of today are denser than historic
conditions, containing more small trees compared to the
forests prior to 1900. These small trees serve as fire ladders,
allowing ground fires to climb into the tree canopy and
become crown fires. Wildfire severity and frequency have
increased in recent years. These forest conditions, when
combined with greater human encroachment into the forest-
lands, have dramatically increased the risk for loss of life
and property from wildfires.
The Buffalo Creek Fire burned about 12,000 acres in 1996,
destroying several homes and removing essential forest
cover on highly erosive soils. Heavy rainfall and floods
following the fire resulted in two fatalities and substantial
erosion and sedimentation. Downstream reservoirs that
supply water for the Denver metropolitan area were ad-
versely affected. Denver Water spent nearly $1 million on
water quality cleanup and dredging operations in their
reservoirs. They estimate they will spend an additional $25
million on future cleanup, dredging, and water treatment
modifications as a result of the Buffalo Creek Fire.
A landscape assessment was completed for the 645,000-
acre Upper South Platte Watershed in September 1999. Key
issues were identified and management recommendations
were made to address catastrophic disturbances. The
landscape assessment identified the dominant ecological
processes and developed recommendations to restore and
maintain the health of the Upper South Platte watershed.
Landscape Pattern of Vegetation—The structure, com-
position, and landscape pattern of vegetation have been
altered from conditions found prior to the arrival of Euro-
American people by the cumulative effect of human activi-
ties. Lowering the density of timber stands and creating
more openings in ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir forests
should reduce the risk of large-scale catastrophic fires, such
as the Buffalo Creek Fire. Maintaining healthy forest stand
conditions should also reduce the severity of other distur-
bances, including insect epidemics. Reducing existing fuel
buildups by the use of prescribed fire and other treatments
will reduce the threat of high-intensity wildfires and
the associated risks of flooding, erosion, and downstream
sedimentation.
Soil Development and Movement—Soil development
and movement in the Upper South Platte Basin may be
changed significantly by human influences on disturbance
processes. Soil erosion hazard is correlated to road and trail
density, vegetation, and drainage patterns, an especially
severe problem in the highly erosive soils of the project area.
Paved and unpaved roads and trails with inadequate main-
tenance, inadequate drainage, or improper engineering can
lead to considerable erosion and increased sedimentation.
Realigning or improving drainage and maintenance of exist-
ing roads and trails will reduce soil erosion and sedimenta-
tion, and improve road and trail safety. Closing and restor-
ing unnecessary roads and trails will also reduce soil erosion
and sedimentation.
Water Quality, Quantity, and Aquatic Habitats—
Recent catastrophic fire and flood events have resulted in
the movement of large amounts of sediment into the streams,
harming water quality, aquatic habitat, and valuable mu-
nicipal water systems. Water treatment plants had to be

shut down, and the tap water had a bad odor and taste.
Restoring the landscape vegetation to more sustainable
conditions will reduce the potential for catastrophic events.
Abandoned mine reclamation and drainage control will also
have a positive impact on aquatic habitat.
Customers and the Public
Benefit ________________________
The Upper South Platte River Basin is southwest of
Denver, CO. The area includes portions of Park, Jefferson,
Douglas, Teller, and Clear Creek Counties. Residential land
use in the Upper South Platte Basin is primarily rural;
recreation, mining, and agriculture form the economic base.
The watershed is sparsely populated, with several small
towns located near historic mining and recreation areas.
Many of the small communities have a mixture of perma-
nent and seasonal residents. The communities of Bailey
(population 9,100) and Woodland Park (population 9,000)
are the largest urban areas within the watershed. Other
small communities include Shawnee, Pine, Trumbull,
Oxyoke, Nighthawk, and Deckers. Many homes are located
in unincorporated areas adjacent to the South Platte River
and its tributaries.
Stakeholders
The stakeholders include local and county governments,
fire departments, landowners, and the business and envi-
ronmental communities. The Upper South Platte Water-
shed Protection Association is a stakeholder group that
shares similar interests with the Upper South Platte Water-
shed Protection and Restoration Project. The project will
seek to develop a partnership with the association.
The Upper South Platte Project will benefit watershed
stakeholders in several ways. Reducing wildfire severity
will also reduce the risk of large, disastrous fires and the
resulting home and property damage in the urban interface.
Many of the residents’ livelihoods are dependent on the
surrounding natural resources. Sustainable forest condi-
tions would support continued recreation and employment
opportunities in the natural resource-related jobs.
Customers
Customers include horseback riders, hikers, mountain
bikers, motorcycle, ATV and four-wheel drive enthusiasts,
campers, anglers, hunters, and guides, Denver Water con-
sumers, and downstream irrigators. The Upper South Platte
Basin supplies about 80 percent of the water needs of Denver
and the surrounding communities (50 percent from the
South Platte and 30 percent from the North Fork). The
current demand on the Denver Water system averages
265,000 acre-feet per year. The supply is about 345,000 acre-
feet per year. Water resource development interests have
identified the Upper South Platte Basin as the most efficient
supply with the least costly storage sites for the Denver
metropolitan area’s future water.
The Denver metropolitan area residents also benefit from
the Upper South Platte Project in several ways. Reducing
sediment transport will minimize impacts on water quality.
Denver Water will save money on maintaining reservoir
capacity and water treatment. Water bills will remain low
for Denver Water customers, and they will continue to have
quality drinking water. The Denver metropolitan area resi-
dents comprise the majority of the recreation users in the
Upper South Platte River Basin. Sustainable forest condi-
tions will permit continued high quality forest recreation
opportunities.
The Public
As a result of the Upper South Platte Restoration Project,
the forest will be less prone to catastrophic wildfire. This will
save suppression costs on large wildfires and create more
sustainable landscape conditions for soil, water, fish, wild-
life, and recreation.
Controversies __________________
Fire Risks
A report prepared by the Federal General Accounting
Office in 1999 describes the seriousness and problems that
now exist from the threat of catastrophic wildfires to forest
resources and communities in the following statement:
Uncontrollable wild fires should be seen as a failure of land
management and public policy, not as an unpredictable act of
nature. The size, intensity, destructiveness and cost of wild-
fires are no accident. It is an outcome of our attitudes and
priorities. The fire situation will become worse rather than
better unless there are changes in land management priority
at all levels.
The early logging from 1870 to 1900, grazing of domestic
livestock, and fire suppression effects on the Upper South
Platte Watershed have resulted in conditions that differ
markedly from pre-Euro-American settlement conditions,
especially in the ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir forests. These
forests have changed from a mosaic of patches with different
aged trees and tree densities to a more uniform, dense forest.
The fire regimes have changed over time from mixed sever-
ity fires to crown fires.
In the last 150 years, no extensive fires have occurred in
the drainage. A low-intensity fire that occurred in the 1850s
was extensive. A similar fire should have reoccurred in 60
years. These “natural” fires and tree recruitment periods
following the fires resulted in considerable spatial and
temporal heterogeneity. There are four components to this
type of forest. The first component is forested patches with
a distinct age cap. The second component includes patches of
old-growth ponderosa pine with no evidence of past stand-
replacing fires. In these patches, ponderosa pine and, often,
Douglas-fir trees range widely in ages and states of health
and decline. The third component is nonforested openings
created by fire. The fourth component is the riparian system.
These components proportions have changed significantly
in the Upper South Platte Watershed, which increases the
likelihood of a catastrophic fire.

Air Quality
Wildland fire is a major source of air pollutants that have
the potential to create high concentrations of fine particu-
lates. The Environmental Protection Agency 24-hour stan-
dard for these particulates with a diameter of less than 10
microns is 150 micrograms per cubic meter. Concentrations
of 5,000 micrograms per cubic meter have been measured on
some wildland fires.
The emissions vary significantly between flaming and
smoldering combustion. Six to 10 times more particulates
are produced by smoldering combustion compared to flam-
ing combustion. Most small fuels are consumed by flaming
combustion and have a relatively small emission factor.
About 40 percent of the larger fuels, those materials 6 inches
in diameter and larger, burn by smoldering combustion,
which results in large emissions. By removing larger mate-
rials before the ignition, the potential for large amounts of
smoke and larger fuels to smolder for long periods of time is
reduced. This smoldering often occurs after ideal meteoro-
logical conditions have passed and an inversion has set in.
We are working to develop markets for small diameter mate-
rials so they can be removed by methods other than prescribed
fire.
Prescribed fires are scheduled during periods when me-
teorological conditions will prevent violating air quality
standards. Of course, it is not possible to schedule a wild fire.
Prescribed fire can be an excellent technique to prevent
extreme emission from being generated from a wild fire.
Agencies in Colorado are working hard to improve monitor-
ing and predicting the impacts of fire emissions to the
ambient air quality and visibility.
Water Quality
The Upper South Platte watershed is a valuable drainage
system to Denver and surrounding communities. Of particu-
lar concern is the quality and quantity of water produced by
this watershed. Shortly after the Buffalo Creek Fire, a
strong thunderstorm occurred over the burned area. Flood-
ing from this storm moved large amounts of sediment,
destroyed homes and bridges, and decreased soil stability.
Following the fire there were efforts to rehabilitate the
burned area. Although some of the rehabilitation was suc-
cessful, another flood caused two human fatalities and
moved tremendous quantities of sediment. Much of the
sediment settled in the Strontia Springs Reservoir, which
supplies municipal water. Aquatic habitat was also dam-
aged as a result of the fire and floods.
This project is now making a concentrated effort to protect
and restore the landscape to a more sustainable condition to
reduce the potential for future catastrophic events that
would dramatically affect water quality and aquatic habitat.
The intent of these efforts is to move watershed conditions
and functions towards more sustainable conditions.
Erosion
Human activities have affected soil development and
movement during the past 100 years, primarily by influenc-
ing disturbance processes. Alterations to natural disturbance
processes may increase catastrophic events, such as a fire.
Soil development and movement depend on several factors:
climate, parent material, time, vegetation, and disturbance.
Granite is the parent material of most of this watershed.
Granite weathers to gruss, which is a coarse gravel to fine
sand crystalline regolith. Gruss and the soils that develop on
it are highly erodible when exposed to direct impacts of rain,
overland flow, or removal of vegetation by fire. Conse-
quently, soil development and soil movement may be much
different spatially and temporally during the past 100 years
than the 1,000 years before Euro-American influence. An
imbalance of soil development processes that may have
potential long-term detrimental effects to the health and
vigor of the watershed has likely occurred.
Land uses, such as suburban and rural development, are
activities that can increase the surface erosion and soil loss.
For a period, these activities may expose detrimentally
compacted, displaced or fragmented surface organic and
mineral layers to erosion. The net effect of these conditions
may leave the surface soil layers in an unstable or unpro-
tected state that can erode and deposit in streams and
reservoirs.
Road construction, home construction and recreation use
are on the rise in the Upper South Platte watershed, fueled
by population growth in Denver. The Buffalo Creek Fire
burned homes and forest cover on about 12,000 acres of
highly erosive soils. Fortunately, this fire did not burn in a
heavily populated area. While the homes were quickly re-
built, ecological recovery has been slow. Hillsides are still
barren of woody vegetation, and soil erosion continues. The
soils are being transported to a storage reservoir for Denver
Water. Denver Water estimates it will take $25 million to
dredge this reservoir.

ment of stakeholders, customers, and the public. The project
is also developing additional stakeholder partners. The
partners are concerned with water quality issues and fire
risks within the Upper South Platte River Basin.
The partners agree to use watershed restoration as a
guide for management and project planning within the
Upper South Platte River Basin. The partners agree to the
following collaboration principles: no one is the center of a
network; keep commitments; communicate in a candid and
tactful manner; honor each others’ interests and contribu-
tions; and keep shared work products visible.
Rocky Mountain Region and Pike National
Forest
The USDA Forest Service manages about 500,000 acres of
the Pike National Forest within the Upper South Platte
Basin. National forest management occurs within a frame-
work set by Federal laws and regulations. The agency’s
ultimate responsibility is to manage National Forest lands
for multiple benefits on a sustainable basis. The USDA
Forest Service operates within the annual budgets appropri-
ated by Congress. Individual projects are planned with
public input using the National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA) process. The Federal budget, acquisition, and plan-
ning processes result in the USDA Forest Service moving
slower than the other partners.
The Rocky Mountain Region and the Pike National Forest
entered into the partnership to facilitate meeting landscape
objectives. Although the agency manages nearly 80 percent
of the lands within the Upper South Platte River Basin, it
cannot hope to achieve the landscape objectives without
partners. The partners will provide resources to improve
conditions adjacent to the largest streams and in the urban
interface where private lands predominate. The partner-
ships provide a means to increase efficiencies in planning
and implementing projects on a landscape basis. The part-
ners provide a collaboration to leverage funds to achieve
shared objectives.
The management branch of the USDA Forest Service has
a three-person team assigned full time to the Upper South
Platte Project. The team is involved in all aspects of the
project, including public involvement, partner recruitment,
restoration projects, and coordination with other Forest
Service projects and programs. The team has identified
numerous specific restoration projects to improve terrestrial
and aquatic conditions. The planning for these projects
began in 2000. The majority of the projects described in the
Business Plan will occur on the Pike National Forest.
Rocky Mountain Research Station
The research branch of the USDA Forest Service focuses
on academic issues in forest management. Peer-reviewed
research provides tools and context for National Forest
management. The research branch is relatively indepen-
dent of the land management branch to minimize any
scientific bias. The Rocky Mountain Research Station en-
tered the partnership to assure the relevance of research to
land management by formalizing the feedback loop to the
knowledge base. Monitoring by the research community
assures research conclusions can be tested on a landscape
basis, and management practices can be adapted accordingly.
The Upper South Platte Project is based on science. It is
not a pilot or test. It will rely heavily on research being
conducted at Cheesman Lake, an intact historical landscape
that can serve as a model for restoration activities in the
lower montane zone for the Colorado Front Range.
A great deal is known about the natural disturbance
history of this historical landscape and about the structure
of the landscape components. Management actions will be
based on this knowledge without compromising options.
Research during the first years of the project will improve
knowledge about the overall landscape and the structure
and processes regulating it. New information can be incorpo-
rated into project planning and implementation. However,
technical limitations may prevent new research information
being implemented in a timely way.
The Forest Service research branch will conduct the re-
search for the restoration activities, at an annual cost to the
project of $175,000. We are using the Forest Vegetation
Simulator and Stand Visualization System with existing
data. A GIS layer of forest structure at the landscape scale
has been developed for the historical Cheesman Lake land-
scape. Fire behavior is being evaluated for several landscape
scenarios using the FARSITE model. Additional research
for fiscal year 2000 included: (1) developing an integrated
landscape Historical Range of Variability for the historical
landscape; (2) testing this Historic Range of Variability
elsewhere in South Platte Basin; and (3) preparing three-
dimensional visualizations of various landscape scenarios.
After the first year, subsequent research will focus on
tightening the description of the historical landscape and
natural variation in the processes affecting landscape pat-
terns, with the overall goal of extending results to the larger
montane zone of the Front Range. This will include refining
restoration scenarios for the project landscape and evaluat-
ing crown fire potential and water balance, comparing the
project area and historical landscape. Subsequent research
also will assess pretreatment and posttreatment under
story plant diversity in the project area, including noxious
weeds.
Colorado State Forest Service
The mission of the Colorado State Forest Service is to
achieve stewardship of Colorado’s environment through
forestry outreach and service. The mission includes protect-
ing natural resources from damaging elements and increas-
ing public understanding of forestry’s role and value in a
healthy environment. The State owns about 2,000 acres
within the Upper South Platte River Basin. The Colorado
State Forest Service has a contract to manage Denver Water
lands in addition to the State lands. The State will work
closely with private landowners to reduce the fire risk in the
urban/forest interface. The partnership provides the State

Culver, Dean, Patten, and Thinnes
with demonstration areas for other landowners on Colorado’s
Front Range. The partnership also provides a mechanism to
leverage funds and improve communication with the public.
Denver Water
Denver Water owns 15,725 acres within the Upper South
Platte River Basin. The forest management is under con-
tract to the Colorado State Forest Service. They manage
dams and reservoirs within the basin, which provide
80 percent of the water used by Denver metropolitan resi-
dents. Strontia Springs Reservoir was adversely affected by
sediment following the Buffalo Creek Fire. Denver Water
wants to reduce the risk of future events like the Buffalo
Creek Fire by proactively managing its lands and the public
lands within the basin. Denver Water can communicate the
partners’ objectives to nearly one million residential water
customers.
USDI Geological Survey
The U.S. Geological Survey maintains stream gauges and
monitors water quality across the United States. The U.S.
Geological Survey collected water quality and soil erosion
data in the Upper South Platte River Basin following the
Buffalo Creek Fire. The U.S. Geological Survey has GIS data
available for the landscape. Their monitoring experience
has resulted in well-established monitoring protocols for soil
and water parameters. They will help develop and imple-
ment the monitoring plan.
USDA Natural Resource Conservation
Service
The Natural Resource Conservation Service provides soil
and conservation technical assistance to private landown-
ers. They provide an additional avenue of public outreach
and have a close working relationship with the local Soil
Conservation Districts (local officials appointed by county
commissioners). The Natural Resource Conservation Ser-
vice may be a source of potential cost-share funding for
private landowners. They have soil inventories for the area
and can provide water quality testing.
Trout Unlimited
The Trout Unlimited Cutthroat Chapter is concerned
about road- and trail-related sediment that is adversely
affecting fish habitat in the South Platte River. They are
interested in identifying potential restoration projects to
reduce sediment and can provide volunteers to help com-
plete the work. Trout Unlimited has expressed an interest in
reconstructing the Gill Trail.
Elk Creek Fire Protection District
The Elk Creek Fire Protection District provides fire pro-
tection in the urban/forest interface. The district is inter-
ested in creating defensible space to fight forest fires before
homes become engulfed in flames. The district will work
with the Colorado State Forest Service to raise public aware-
ness and educate homeowners on how to create defensible
space.
Landscape Restoration __________
Mechanical Vegetation Treatment
The Landscape Assessment identified the Cheesman,
Trout Creek, and Waterton/Deckers and Horse Creek water-
sheds as high priority for forest vegetation and wildlife
habitat restoration. The ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir forests
are at high risk of catastrophic fire because of dense, even-
aged, closed-crown forest conditions. These forests have
very little down wood to permit low intensity ground fires.
Under extreme fire conditions (hot, dry, and windy), fire will
carry as a high intensity crown fire. Mechanical treatment
is needed to reduce the canopy density and create openings.
The objective is to reduce canopy density to 30 percent or less
on up to 80 percent of the ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir land-
scape. Openings of 1–40 acres will be created on up to 25
percent of this landscape. The mechanical vegetation treat-
ments will include commercial timber sales, stewardship/
service contracts, noncommercial thinning, and chipping
or shredding to masticate the trees on site. Prescribed fire
will be used in conjunction with mechanical vegetation
treatments.
About 2,000 acres will have mechanical vegetation treat-
ment on an annual basis. The operational costs vary consid-
erably based on the method used. Monitoring plan that
includes vegetation plots and landscape mosaics will mea-
sure accomplishments.
Generally, lands with existing road access and slopes less
than 35 percent may use commercial timber sales to meet
the vegetation objectives. The timber value in the basin is
relatively low; therefore, some flat areas with roads may
require stewardship/service contracts to meet the vegeta-
tion objectives. Noncommercial hand felling, shredding, or
chipping will be used in steep or limited access areas.
Most of the mechanical vegetation treatments will occur
on National Forest lands managed by the USDA Forest
Service. The Colorado Forest Service will manage State and
Denver Water lands and provide assistance to private land-
owners. Costs for mechanical vegetation treatment vary
from commercial value for some timber sales to several
hundred dollars per acre for hand falling. An average cost of
$137.50 per acre is planned for mechanical treatment. The
actual cost could be considerably different if the treatment
mix differs significantly from the assumed 50–75 percent in
commercial removal.
Reforestation
A portion of the Buffalo Creek Fire area requires refores-
tation to provide vegetation diversity. The USDA Forest
Service will plant about 1,000 acres with ponderosa pine
widely spaced. Standard reforestation survival and growth
protocol will be used to measure accomplishments. The seed
inventory is currently insufficient to provide an adequate

116
USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-22. 2001
Culver, Dean, Patten, and Thinnes
Upper South Platte Watershed Protection and Restoration Project
number of seedlings. Seeds will be sowed in 2000 to plant 100
acres of container seedlings in 2001. Cones will be collected
in 2000–2002 to replenish the seed inventory. Additional
seed will be sowed in 2001–2003 to plant 300 acres per year
the following years. Reforestation costs are expected to be
$500 per acre.
Noxious Weeds
Leafy spurge, diffuse knapweed, yellow and Dalmatian
toadflax, and Canada and musk thistles are noxious weeds
along 25 miles of the South Platte River. These noxious
weeds are less palatable to wildlife, are less effective in
stabilizing soil, and often out compete native vegetation.
The goal is to reduce the infested acres. About 200 acres will
be treated annually using chemical, biological, mechanical,
and manual methods. Accomplishments will be measured by
surveying the river corridor annually to determine if the
infestation zone is shrinking, remaining constant, or growing.
The USDA Forest Service, Colorado Division of Wildlife,
Colorado Department of Agriculture, and county weed boards
are working with private landowners and volunteer groups
to manage the noxious weed problem. County weed manage-
ment departments will assist in developing integrated weed
management plans for all land ownerships. The National
Fish and Wildlife Foundation and the USDA Forest Service
have provided grants for noxious weed treatments in previ-
ous years. A contribution of $20,000 annually will be used to
leverage an additional $40,000 in grants from partners.
A noxious weed prevention strategy will require treating
an additional 200 acres annually prior to mechanical and
prescribed fire treatments. The additional 200 acres will
require $40,000, for a total of $60,000 funds annually.
Roads
Many roads are poorly located and poorly maintained.
Roads are the major source of anthropogenic erosion and
sedimentation. The Pike National Forest plans to inventory
its roads and update the information during the next 3 years.
The project will accelerate the inventory within the basin
and supplement the collected information to include site-
specific erosion and sedimentation concerns. The updated
information will be used to assess and prioritize roads for
maintenance, closure, and obliteration. The cost in fiscal
year 2000 cost will be $55,000.
Road maintenance in the basin costs about $100,000
annually. Currently, several roads not normally maintained
are in obvious need of maintenance or need more effective
closure devices installed. In fiscal year 2000, $45,000 will be
used to place effective water bars or closure devices on 100
miles of priority roads known to be contributing high amounts
of sediment. The road assessment is anticipated to identify
$120,000 of road maintenance, $73,000 of road reconstruc-
tion improvements from funds, and $57,000 of road oblitera-
tion annually in fiscal years 2002–2005. Accomplishments
will be measured by visual inspection to assure best manage-
ment practices are implemented and effective. The monitor-
ing plan identifies the protocols to evaluate if roads are
affecting water quality.
Trails
The goal of the following trails projects is to create a safe,
sustainable trail system in the South Platte watershed to
meet the needs of hikers and other trail users while minimiz-
ing environmental impacts.
Cheesman Canyon is one of Colorado’s treasures. The Gill
Trail travels through the Cheesman Canyon and accesses a
nationally known fishery along the Platte River. The trail is
used by many hikers interested in seeing one of Colorado’s
major canyons absent roads, railroads, and residential de-
velopment. Views of the historic Cheesman Dam and rugged
canyon scenery also attract trail users. The Gill Trail was
constructed about 40 years ago, stopping short of Cheesman
Reservoir. No major trail improvements have occurred since
then. An estimated 25,000 visitors per year use the trail and
their effects are clearly evident. Crumbling side-slope trails
have caused numerous braided routes and excessive erosion.
Many social trails have been created to try to access the
South Platte River, and some sections of this route are
unsafe. The excessive and braided trails also cut through
habitat used by the Federally listed Pawnee montane skip-
per, killing the plants on which they depend.
The USDA Forest Service, the National Park Service,
consultants, and partners have prepared preliminary trail
plans that address the issues described above. Key partners
in this project include the Cutthroat Chapter of Trout
Unlimited, Denver Water, and the USDA Forest Service.
The final trail plan will be refined and evaluated under the
National Environmental Policy Act planning process by the
end of fiscal year 2000. Trail and restoration work will
include safe rerouting and repair of existing trail, building a
new safe sustainable trail from the original alignment to
Cheesman Reservoir, expanding parking areas, eliminating
braided trails, rehabilitating damaged side slopes, and re-
storing native vegetation that can be used by the skipper. All
work will be completed by fiscal year 2004. Expected project
benefits include improved safety, hiking experience, and
visual quality along the trail, restored skipper habitat, and
reduced sediment input from eroding trails. Local economic
benefits may result from expenditures for goods and services
by anglers and hikers attracted to the improved South Platte
River access.
The estimated total cost for this project is $400,000 over
the next 5 years. The trail design, construction, and mainte-
nance portion is estimated at about $355,000, restoration
about $30,000, and monitoring at $15,000. Besides the
USDA Forest Service’s contribution, Trout Unlimited and
Denver Water will contribute about $126,000 (32 percent of
the project total cost). Trout Unlimited and the USDA Forest
Service have also applied for grants totaling $145,000 (36
percent of the project total) from the Colorado State Trails
Program and Fishing is Fun. This project will make exten-
sive use of volunteers from Trout Unlimited and Volunteers
for Colorado Outdoors to perform trail work.
Prescribed Fire
Fire has been suppressed in the Waterton-Deckers and
Horse Creek watersheds for more than 100 years. Therefore,
the natural fuels have been building up over time and have

117

Culver, Dean, Patten, and Thinnes
the potential for large catastrophic stand- replacing fires.
These stands are generally dense, even-aged, with closed
crown conditions. Extreme fire conditions (low humidity,
low fuel moistures, high temperatures and wind) allow fire
ignitions to result in high-intensity crown fire. The objective
of this project is to treat 2,000 acres annually with pre-
scribed fire to reduce natural and activity fuels and, where
possible, create openings in the ponderosa pine-Douglas-fir
stands. The areas to be treated will be companion areas to
those being treated by mechanical methods.
The operational costs should not vary from costs experi-
enced over the past 5 years in the prescribed fire program.
Accomplishments will be measured based on the monitoring
plan. Prescribed fire can be used to treat lands with little or
no access and slopes greater than 35 percent. The slopes
greater than 35 percent are on the upper limit for mechani-
cal treatment. There may be a need to return to the stands
treated by prescribed fire to supplement the prescription by
hand felling trees not killed by fire to enlarge openings.
Mechanical treatments will generally be followed by pre-
scribed fire on lands managed by the Colorado State Forest
Service and the USDA Forest Service.
Monitoring
Monitoring will serve as the quality control aspect of this
restoration project. Data collection and observations of ac-
tivities will provide a basis for evaluation of the overall
restoration project. Data collection and analysis will follow
established scientific procedures. Data collected will be
analyzed and evaluated. Monitoring will be designed to
determine if activities are being carried out in compliance
with the project plan and existing Forest Plan. Objectives,
long-term relationships, and the ability of the project to
adapt to the research findings from the Cheesman research
project will be evaluated. Also, the effectiveness of manage-
ment activities in moving the vegetation and water quality
toward desired conditions and in reducing the threat of
catastrophic wild fires and their associated effects on soil,
water and the human environment will be evaluated.
Monitoring will be completed annually and it will be based
on the Upper South Platte Watershed Protection and Resto-
ration Project Monitoring Strategy developed by a subcom-
mittee of the Steering Committee. The monitoring will
determine whether project activities are meeting the goals of
reducing fuel hazards and associated catastrophic fire risk
while maintaining soil productivity, minimizing erosion,
and improving water quality. The monitoring strategy is
designed to be dynamic and will be changed as new informa-
tion becomes available. Monitoring stations will be estab-
lished in the upper portion of the watershed, as well as in the
lower portion of the watershed. Activity-level monitoring
will be determined during project planning. Where possible,
the Denver Water lab will be used for water analysis. The
USDA Forest Service will provide data storage, and infor-
mation will be shared with all partners on a regular basis.
The USDA Forest Service will take the lead in funding the
monitoring activities and will work with partners to secure
additional funding. The USDA Forest Service will work with
partners to assign personnel to conduct the monitoring
activities. A monitoring report will be done annually and
presented to the partners and Steering Committee. The
Middle East Regional Cooperation Program will contribute
some data to the monitoring process. This project may also
contribute some funds toward the overall project but this
remains to be seen.

Problem Solving or Social Change?
The Applegate and Grand Canyon
Forest Partnerships
Cassandra Moseley
Brett KenCairn
Abstract—Natural resource conflicts have resulted in attempts at
better collaboration between public and private sectors. The result-
ing partnerships approach collaboration either by problem solving
through better information and management, or by requiring sub-
stantial social change. The Applegate Partnership in Oregon and
the Grand Canyon Forest Partnership in Arizona illustrate each
approach. These approaches show the formative influences that
shape the evolution and activities of a partnership, and show the
need for multistakeholder participation.
Introduction ____________________
Over the past decade, numerous communities, agencies,
and interest groups in the American West have turned to
collaboration to manage natural resource conflict and de-
velop and implement plans for managing, preserving, and
restoring the landscape. These collaborations take many
different forms because they emerge in response to local
political, economic, and ecological circumstances. Yet all
must respond to a common challenges: complex problems,
diverse and often conflicting interests, fluid and often shift-
ing relationships of power and authority, and the need to
develop local capacity and resources.
These collaborative initiatives, often referred to as “part-
nerships,” have attracted increasing attention as communi-
ties, agencies, and interest groups create, join, or actively
resist these multistakeholder initiatives. A growing body of
literature has attempted to comprehend and characterize
these groups (Brick and others 2000; Cestero 1999; Conley
2000; Kenny 1999, 2000; Moore and Koontz 2000; Moseley
1999; Sturtevant and Lange 1995; Weber and Herzog 2000).
Our assertion is that many of the efforts to explain partner-
ships and collaboratives overlook a fundamental distinction
among groups that explains variations in group character,
configuration, focus, and success.
We argue that a partnership chooses between at least two
fundamentally different ways of seeing and defining its
problem. One approach views the challenge as a quasi-
technical problem requiring better information, technical
expertise, organizational efficiency, and public education.
The other views the situation as requiring substantial social
change—the reorganization and redistribution of the
decisionmaking authority, responsibility, and resources,
and the allocation of costs and benefits associated with land
management/stewardship.
We draw on two partnership initiatives—the Applegate
Partnership of southwestern Oregon, and the Grand Canyon
Forest Partnership of northern Arizona—to illustrate this
distinction. Using these two groups, we further suggest that
a group’s choice between these two orientations depends on
the characteristics of the founding group—those who initiate
the partnership, define the problem to be addressed, and
recruit the rest of the participants. We assert that the dispo-
sition of this founder group will largely determine a group’s
choice of strategies. Therefore, it is essential to understand
what factors determine who assumes the founding role,
shaping both the partnership, its perception of the problem,
and the strategies it will create to address that problem.
Method ________________________
In this paper, we compare the Applegate Partnership in
southwestern Oregon and the Grand Canyon Forest Part-
nership in northern Arizona. The Applegate Partnership
came together in 1992 to address forest conflict and create
ecosystem-based management in the Applegate Watershed.
Founders created the Grand Canyon Forest Partnership in
1996 to reach agreement about how to reduce fire hazard and
restore the forests surrounding the City of Flagstaff. The
Grand Canyon Forest Partnership and the Applegate Part-
nership offer fertile grounds for comparison, in part, because
they share similar ecological challenges and yet developed
markedly different forms to address them. Both the Applegate
Valley and northern Arizona are naturally fire-dominated
ecosystems with the federal land management agencies
controlling a large percentage of the land. In both regions,
extensive timber extraction, grazing, and fire suppression
had led to dense stands of small trees. Many participants in
both groups were worried that these forest conditions would
lead to large-scale, disruptive change especially wildfire,
species loss, and habitat degradation.
The material for this paper is drawn from the authors’
participant observation in these two groups. Brett KenCairn
was a founding Applegate Board member and was active
with the Partnership from 1992 to 1997. KenCairn was
involved in the Grand Canyon Forest Partnership in 1998
and 1999. Cassandra Moseley was a board member of the
Applegate Partnership and also conducted extensive inter-
views and participant observation in the Applegate Valley
between 1995 and 1998.

Problem Solving or Social Change? The Applegate and Grand Canyon Forest Partnerships
Formative Influence of
Local Context __________________
Kingdon (1984) argues that political change occurs when
a “window of opportunity” opens that creates the political
space for a new policy or idea to be introduced into politics
(see also Moseley 1999). These windows open for a variety of
reasons, ranging from regular events such as elections to
extraordinary political crises. In both of our case studies,
political crises created the opportunity to realign institu-
tional arrangements. In the Applegate, the injunction that
halted timber harvest in the territory of the northern spot-
ted owl created the window of opportunity. The anger and
administrative chaos that the injunction created allowed a
community leader to pull together people to talk about new
forms of land management.
In northern Arizona, disputes over federal forest man-
agement coupled with dramatic wildfires that threatened
Flagstaff created a sense of crisis. This crisis pushed
natural resource agencies, elected officials, and other com-
munity leaders to search for common ground that would
allow federal managers to implement new forms of forest
management.
Despite similarities of political crises, the partnerships
that emerged were markedly different. In Flagstaff, the
institutional dynamics of participant agencies dominated
the Partnership. In the Applegate, a hybrid community/
institution-based group emerged that eventually evolved
into a community-based group.
Participant Worldview and Perceptions of
“the Problem”
The Grand Canyon Forest Partnership (GCFP) was founded
as a collaboration of government agencies and nongovern-
mental organizations to reduce fire hazard and improve forest
health on the 100,000 acres of public lands surrounding
Flagstaff. GCFP founders believed that legal and political
conflict and disagreement over federal forest management
were preventing the formulation and support for a new
approach to active forest management. Participant groups
were selected based on their technical expertise or their role
as opinion leaders in the region. Partnership founders be-
lieved that they could get the public to trust their efforts if they
recruited a diverse collection of leading organizations to
support the work of forest restoration specialists. The group
focused on convening experts to develop a solution and creat-
ing public support for the proposed solution.
When faced with a similar if more extreme political crisis,
Applegate leaders founded a very different partnership. The
Applegate Partnership founders wanted to develop a com-
prehensive management strategy at a watershed (500,000
acre) scale. New management strategies would be “ecologi-
cally sound, economically viable, and socially acceptable.”
(Unattributed quotes come from anonymous interviews of
Applegate Partnership participants.)  At the outset, Apple-
gate leaders choose to address the ecological problems they
faced at a larger scale—ecologically and socially—than the
effort in Flagstaff. But more importantly, Applegate leaders
viewed the central causes of the problem they faced—and
how they could be best addressed—in a much different way.
The Applegate founders believed that the model in which
government agencies developed plans and then put them out
for public review was not working. This process left out too
many people until it was too late in the process, which
created a narrow problem definition, and offered too few
sources of ideas for solving complex problems. Applegate
leaders saw problems as being so complex that no one person
or set of people with particular perspectives or interests
could hope to solve them.
Why were these groups so different and what have been
the effects? We argue that the difference in group form and
problem definition was caused by the different political
context, especially institutional arrangements. These differ-
ent visions affected partnership organization, accomplish-
ments, and how the groups responded to outside challenges.
Political Context and Locus of Authority
Although Kingdon (1984) points us toward political crisis
as an opportunity for change, he offers us little guidance for
understanding which ideas and changes will flow through
the window and who will push them. Historical institution-
alists encourage us to look at institutional form and “thick-
ness” to understand what shapes change (sensu Skowronek
1997). Skocpol (1979), Orren and Skowronek (1998 to 1999),
and Skowronek (1982) argue that past institutional develop-
ment will shape the form of change in the present and future.
Following their lead, we argue that, although there is no
guarantee that partnership groups will choose social change
over pragmatism, this is more likely to occur when private
citizens are able to play a major role in the group’s founding
and problem definition than when leadership is primarily
representatives of pre-existing institutions, especially gov-
ernment agencies.
The Grand Canyon Forest Partnership came together in
an institutionally thick environment. Flagstaff and its sur-
rounding forests were at the center of the jurisdictional
interests of numerous elected officials, local, and state gov-
ernment agencies. Flagstaff is the county seat of Coconino
County and hosts most of the county government and ser-
vices. It is also the location of the Coconino National Forest
Supervisor’s Office and two of the four Ranger District
offices. Flagstaff maintains a full-time wildfire specialist
and coordinates multiagency wildfire responses. Flagstaff is
also an administrative center for a variety of other organiza-
tions that were to become important members of the Grand
Canyon Forest Partnership including Arizona Game and
Fish, the Arizona State Land Department, the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, and the Nature Conservancy. In addition,
several regional environmental groups and chapters of na-
tional groups are headquartered in Flagstaff including the
Grand Canyon Trust, the Sierra Club, and the Southwest
Forest Alliance (a consortium of more than 90 environmen-
tal advocacy groups).
The consequence of this institutional thickness was the
dominance of institutions in the formation of this collabora-
tive. The thickness privileged institutional representatives
over private citizens. This difference between citizens and
institutional representatives matters because of the ways
that these representatives are tied to their institutional
mandates and cultures. Our argument is not that citizen
innovation was impossible but rather that it is difficult and

unlikely in these circumstances without extraordinary en-
ergy on the part of citizens.
In Flagstaff, leadership from government agencies did not
divorce itself from their organizational perspective. Conse-
quently, rather than seeking social change, the leadership
sought to solve technical problems. What happened in Flag-
staff reflects more generally what we might expect in an
environment thick with bureaucratic institutions. People
working in particular organizations bring with them the
mandates of these agencies and are seeking to solve the
problems they face.
This tendency is heightened because many natural re-
source agencies were formed with Progressive Era ideology
in which problems were seen as primarily technical and
experts were the best qualified to solve those problems (Hays
1959, 1991; Hirt 1994; Kaufman 1960; Moseley 1999; Tho-
mas 1999; Luker 1984; Ross 1991). Technically trained
experts could manage resources efficiently for the greater
common good (Pinchot 1990). Through the application of
scientific principles, nature could be simplified and ordered
to bring it under human control (Scott 1998). By implication,
citizens were either too self-interested or too ignorant to
participate. Even when people in natural resource agencies
take a broader view, formal and informal institutional pro-
cesses have already been shaped using a Progressive Era
model. Thus when faced with a crisis, or a failure of the old
order, these agencies seek change but still find themselves
tied to older institutional processes (Moseley 1999; Orren
and Skowronek 1998–1999; Skocpol 1979; Skowronek 1982).
Exceptional leadership, complete breakdown of normal in-
stitutional politics, or intensive outside pressure, we argue,
would be required to shift these politics.
The jurisdictional conditions and social development could
not have been more different in the Applegate Valley. There
are no incorporated communities in the Valley and, thus, no
city government. A county line divides the Valley in half, and
thus no county-level elected officials see the Valley as their
territory. No state or local agencies locate their offices in the
Valley. The major exceptions to this are the federal land
management agencies. The Forest Service has a Ranger
Station in the Valley and major portions of two BLM re-
source areas are located in the Applegate Valley. With the
exception of the Applegate Ranger District, all government
offices are 30 to 45 minutes away.
In addition to the relatively weak organizational bases of
local and state government, few staffed nongovernmental
organizations focused on the Applegate. Headwaters, the
longest standing regional environmental organization in
southern Oregon, was active in the Applegate but was
housed in Ashland, a town outside the Applegate. Similarly,
the Sierra Club and other national organizations had active
members living in the Applegate but local chapters were
located in towns outside the Valley and were servicing an
area several times the size of the Applegate.
Instead of thick formal bureaucratic and political institu-
tions, the Applegate Valley had a long history of small-scale
social and political organizations (Moseley 1999; Preister
1993; Sturtevant and Lange 1995). Particularly important
for natural resources were a number of small-scale, volun-
teer environmental groups that had monitored federal tim-
ber sales during the 1970s and 1980s. They opposed federal
actions by mobilizing networks of residents to attend public
hearings, write letters, and submit appeals. These small,
volunteer groups developed a cadre of community residents
who understood the basics of forest management and Forest
Service and BLM administration.
These community residents, moreover, were not stereo-
typical rural community residents but rather people who
had moved to rural areas in the 1970s and 1980s to escape
traditional suburban life. (For a description of “back-to-the-
landers” see Jacob [1997].)  Social change had long been a
part of their personal ideology. Several of the core group of
Applegate Partnership founders had long been acting upon
their personal social change agendas by protesting federal
timber sales. Through these protests they came to see the
limits of old political processes and developed ideas for
alternative approaches to citizen involvement.
Instead of numerous government agencies and sophisti-
cated nongovernmental organizations facing the limits of
old management strategies first, it was community resi-
dents and the federal land management agencies. Instead of
placing leadership from formal organizations at the center of
change, the jurisdictional paucity in the Applegate put
community residents at the center. With the Forest Service
and the BLM in crisis, it was community residents who
stepped forward to create change.
Core Group Formation and Participant
Recruitment
In these different institutional climates, the initial lead-
ers drew upon different networks to identify and recruit
initial participants. In the institutionally rich environment
of northern Arizona, organizers used formal networks of
existing institutions and agencies to identify representa-
tives. In the Applegate, organizers frequently turned to the
informal network of community residents to recruit indi-
viduals known.
In the Applegate, Jack Shipley, the organizer of the
initiative, was a private citizen. Shipley had a long history
as an environmental activist. He was part of a network of
citizen activists and knew many government officials and
other professional and technical specialists. Shipley and his
early allies broadened these networks driven by the belief
that only with broad participation could a collaboration find
solutions. Long before Jack Shipley decided to hold a found-
ing meeting, he undertook several months of shuttle diplo-
macy between various interest groups, neighborhood groups,
and people in the Applegate and larger Rogue Basin. Shipley’s
strategy was an organizing campaign—similar to tradi-
tional union organizing—not an information campaign. He
put forward provisional ideas and sought suggestions.
He was not offering a solution but an opportunity for people
to participate in figuring out a solution. Driven by an idea of
social change that pushed experts out of the center of
decisionmaking and created broad participation, Shipley
believed that he had to recruit people from a wide variety of
perspectives. This choice was motivated not simply by politi-
cal considerations, but by the core belief that only with this
wide variety of perspectives participating could innovative
solutions be found.
The founding leaders understood, however implicitly,
that their central problem was to move people out of their

124

Moseley and KenCairn
Problem Solving or Social Change? The Applegate and Grand Canyon Forest Partnerships
traditional boxes as “industry,” “enviros,” or agency.” If
people could open up to other perspectives then, leaders
hoped, the group could find solutions that no one could
develop independently.
In contrast to the Applegate, where a private citizen
working largely independent of any organizational affilia-
tion created the partnership, a frustrated Forest Service
official stymied by public opposition to traditional manage-
ment approaches founded the Grand Canyon Forest Part-
nership. In the early 1990s, Fred Trevey, then Supervisor of
the Coconino National Forest, watched litigation and public
opinion prevent the Forest Service from implementing fa-
miliar forest management. Recognizing that implementing
forest management required a new base of public support,
Trevey began convening informal meetings with a small
circle of local environmental leaders, academics, and city
and county government personnel. The group decided to
form an institutional partnership to develop a consensus for
restoration-based forest management.
This initial group identified organizations that would be
viewed as stakeholders in public forest land management. In
assessing who should participate, the core group considered
institutions that needed to be represented to ensure the
support for any strategy that the partnership developed.
Stakeholders were brought to the table if they had technical
expertise or veto power in other arenas. Founders asked
these groups to designate representatives to sit on a board.
In contrast to the Applegate Partnership’s emphasis on
recruiting participants that could be representative of the
core views and issues of their constituencies, the Grand
Canyon Forest Partnership sought participants to repre-
sent their organizations in drafting and endorsing specific
proposals.
Common Challenges, Contrasting
Responses _____________________
The founding process of each of these two groups and
institutional character of their settings shaped how the
partnerships formed. With differing local contexts, founding
dynamics, and perceptions of the central problem (and
associated response), these two partnerships developed
markedly different organizational forms and habits. To
contrast these differences, we identify three major chal-
lenges common to both partnerships and contrast their
responses to these challenges.
Balancing Participation and
Decisionmaking Authority
The relationships of the people who actively participate
and nonactivists who have some interest in the work of a
partnership are important because everyone cannot be at
the table at once. Active participants are only a small
fraction of the people who have a stake in the work of a
partnership. Yet, active participants make management
decisions for the larger society. To succeed a partnership
needs social “permission” to do their work. How did the
participants represent the larger society and what effect did
it have on the form and possibilities of these groups? There
are, really, three ways that people “represent” in these sorts
of groups. Although they are readily distinguished theoreti-
cally, in fact, people practically shift from one mode to the
other.
One way that people come to the table is as representa-
tives of particular groups. For example, in the Grand Can-
yon Forest Partnership, the 17 initial partner organizations
each selected a formal representative that had the authority
to represent his or her institution in any negotiation or
agreement. In this form, the representative tends to be tied
to the institutional concerns of his or her agency. These
concerns could include fulfilling legal mandates, avoiding
political conflict, taking leadership in reform efforts, and
defending turf. The personality, skills, and ideology of the
representative and the freedom that his or her home agency
gives them mediate the extent of the institutionalist mode of
participation of particular participants.
The second form is representation of the interests of a
constituency. In this case, someone comes to the partnership
with constituent interests firmly in mind. For example, a
timber industry lobbyist might come to the table to protect
and promote the industry’s economic interests. Similarly, an
environmentalist may come to the table committed to de-
fending the values and interests of other environmentalists.
We can imagine, in these instances, that these representa-
tives will tend to act self-interestedly on behalf of their
constituents. They may tend to be strategic in their position
taking. In addition, they might be inclined to take extreme
positions and then bargain on behalf of their constituents.
Again, these tendencies will be moderated by the personal-
ity of the representative. Divisions or lack of clear opinions
or positions within the representative’s constituency may
also create flexibility and opportunity for independent
behavior.
A third form of representation is that of perspective. In
this instance, participants are viewed as bringing to the
table their knowledge, experience as someone who has
particular life experiences and values that lend insights to
the conundrums that the group faces. For example, a logger
might bring values about the importance of continuing to
harvest and knowledge and skills about the opportunities
and limits of particular harvest plans, and the views of her
peer group. An agency scientist might bring values of species
protection and information about ecosystem dynamics in the
region under discussion, and an understanding of his agency's
organizational limitations.
The Grand Canyon Forest Partnership viewed represen-
tation primarily in the first two ways. The Applegate sought
to create the third form of representation but the first two
forms were important at particular times as well.
At its outset, the founders of the Grand Canyon Forest
Partnership believed that the solution to public skepticism
over public forest management was to establish a partner-
ship of respected organizations and institutions that con-
stituted a diverse set of positions and views on forest
management. If this group of powerful institutions could
then reach consensus, public support would follow.
With their focus on influential organizations, institu-
tional representation dominated the Grand Canyon Forest
Partnership. By and large, participants represented the
agencies and organizations from which they came. Founders
assumed that the people at the table represented the key

125
Problem Solving or Social Change? The Applegate and Grand Canyon Forest Partnerships
Moseley and KenCairn
views of major constituencies and all the important perspec-
tives on forest management.
In contrast to the Grand Canyon group’s emphasis on
institutional representation, the Applegate Partnership
encouraged its participants to represent perspectives rather
than institutional positions. In this way, the group believed
the key to innovation was bringing people and ideas together
in new ways. Participants talked about “leaving positions at
the door and bringing only values and interests.” This
approach was also reflected in the group’s culture of negotia-
tion. Rather than supporting a process in which representa-
tives started negotiating from extreme positions and then
negotiated towards the middle, the group tried to focus on
problem solving and collectively identifying alternatives.
However, despite this explicit focus on perspective over
positions, all three forms of representation existed in the
Applegate, and individuals would shift from one form of
representation to another as circumstances and mood
dictated.
Group Structure and Participant Authority
The second challenge facing both collaboratives was how
to structure the roles of participants. The Grand Canyon
group quickly sought to formalize and institutionalize the
partnership structure but the Applegate Partnership re-
sisted formalization.
In the institutionally rich environment of northern Ari-
zona, the member organizations of the Grand Canyon Forest
Partnership, the majority of whom are public or quasi-public
institutions, sought to establish a clear organizational struc-
ture and legal body capable of managing the coordination
process. The Grand Canyon group created a new not-for-
profit organization to assume the responsibility for the
forest management projects. It hired a staff person who met
weekly with a management team composed of representa-
tives of five of the 15 partners to handle the day-to-day
decisionmaking.
The full partnership met monthly to review partnership
priorities and progress in the implementation. The group
gave informal responsibility for meeting facilitating to the
representative of one of the most active partnership groups.
The meetings were open to the public and a number of
interest group representatives and other agency personnel
frequently attended. However, formal decisionmaking au-
thority rested only with the designated partner groups. The
group’s bylaws stipulated the necessity of consensus among
a majority of participating partners. Voice votes were typi-
cally used to make decisions on priorities.
In contrast, the Applegate Partnership actively resisted
formalizing an implementing body separate from the col-
laborative for its first 4 years. It sought to avoid the emer-
gence of separate organizational structures. In its first
years, governmental and nongovernmental participants ac-
complished the majority of the Applegate Partnership’s
work. These groups were responsible for identifying the
resources necessary to provide support for the partnership’s
projects and functions.
Eventually the Applegate Partnership did establish a not-
for-profit entity and a watershed council that acted as
subsidiaries to the larger partnership. These entities be-
came an important part of the Applegate Valley’s capacity to
implement a wide range of planning and restoration projects.
However, the long period of distributive leadership had
created a culture of decentralized decisionmaking and
responsibility.
Also reflecting this caution against consolidating leader-
ship, the facilitation of the Applegate’s meetings constantly
rotated. This informal culture of rotating leadership
has helped the group avoid the perception that any par-
ticular person has a disproportionate influence on group
decisionmaking.
We can see, then, an institution-focused participation and
representation led the Grand Canyon Forest Partnership to
create an early organization and bureaucratic structure for
itself. By contract, the informal, nonorganizational Applegate
Partnership and its notion of perspective-based representa-
tion led to distributed leadership and project implementation.
Communicating with Nonparticipants
The final challenge that both groups faced was developing
systems to communicate with people beyond core partner-
ship activists. Because not everyone can logistically or prac-
tically come to the table, one central task of partnerships is
to communicate with nonparticipants. The Grand Canyon
Forest Partnership followed two distinct strategies for com-
munication. One was with the agencies and close constitu-
ents of participants and the second was with the general
public. By contrast, the Applegate Partnership used similar
communication strategies with close allies and with more
distant ones. As distance from the partnership increased the
intensity of communication diminished.
The communication among Grand Canyon participants
was direct and involved iterative policy development. But
even within the Grand Canyon Partnership, participation in
communication depended on the level of organizational
involvement in the partnership’s activities. A management
team represented five of the most active partnership organi-
zations. This group met weekly to develop the specific
implementation plans. Most of the decisionmaking took
place within this core group of active partner organizations.
The larger group of partners was involved primarily through
the monthly partnership meetings, special meetings, and
electronic correspondence.
When the Grand Canyon group sought to communicate
with people beyond constituent agencies and organizations,
its focus shifted from deliberation and iterative proposal
development to information and education. The group used
a series of public meetings during its initial phases to solicit
public comment on proposed actions. When some of the
public opposed the Grand Canyon’s proposal to limit certain
types of recreation use, the partnership dropped those pro-
posals. Subsequently, the partnership relied almost entirely
on press releases, media coverage, and the formal govern-
ment review processes to announce to the public what they
planned to do and why.
In the Applegate, the distinction between “public” and
“constituent” was less pronounced because participants were
rarely formally representing people but rather were repre-
senting perspectives. Clearly, people working for organiza-
tions and for interest-based constituencies had responsibili-
ties to communicate proposals back to their organizations to
get feedback. But partnership participants knew this

126
USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-22. 2001
Moseley and KenCairn
Problem Solving or Social Change? The Applegate and Grand Canyon Forest Partnerships
institutional sign-off would not be sufficient to garner broad
community support. Because people sitting at the table were
often not formal representatives they had no explicit permis-
sion to enter into agreements on anyone’s behalf. Conse-
quently, participants needed an interactive relationship
with a large number of stakeholders beyond the partnership
itself.
At meetings, decisions were often preliminary agree-
ments that participants would take to their social networks
to test out. Subsequently, at or between meetings, on the
phone or in person, participants would bring back reactions
of the various people in participants’ networks and modify
decisions. Of central importance to the Applegate group
were informal social networks. Rarely did the Applegate
Partnership use the media to get their message out. Instead,
participants each turned to their social networks, be these
connections with environmentalists, timber workers, people
in the Regional Office of the Forest Service, or community
residents that one saw at other community meetings or
social events. Some connections were professional, others
were social. Some ties were based on strong ties of friend-
ship, others were associational ties from repeated meetings
on natural resource or community business (Granovetter
1973).
Rarely was the primary task of the Applegate Partnership
educational. Because the Applegate group did not represent
people formally, much of their communication was about
gaining permission from the larger community and relevant
organizations to move forward with their ideas. As partner-
ship participants talked to people, they were looking for
feedback, suggested modifications, support, and permission
to move forward. With their social change agenda, commu-
nication was really an “organizing” task, not an information
strategy to explain a decision.
Responses to Challenge
and Conflict ____________________
The socially-based approach of the Applegate Partnership
and the institutional, problem-solving approach of the Grand
Canyon group affected each group’s notions of appropriate
representation, internal structural development, and com-
munication. One can most clearly see effects of these differ-
ences in their responses to external opposition and conflict.
Often partnership groups spend months or years developing
a delicate balance of views, positions, and actions. Once
under pressure, these agreements can become unstable and
stretch the collaboration to its limits.
Going Public, Building Expectations
For both the partnerships, the founding periods were
spent largely out of public view. This period involved dozens
of meetings in which participants tried to find common
ground among diverse interests and agendas. In both groups,
this period ended by “going public” with events in which the
partnerships described the newly found common ground
and celebrated the great potential for common action.
Having raised public expectations, these groups had to
demonstrate the efficacy of their claims. Because both groups
were working largely on public land issues, this necessitated
a federal lands planning process. Because they were federal
land projects, the public had to review the plans. In both
cases, the initial projects were on Forest Service lands. In
each case, local agency officials, both District and Forest
level, worked closely with the partners to develop a project
and then the environmental assessment. Also common to
both cases, developing the proposed action was lengthy, and
diverse interests, particularly environmental and industry,
conflicted frequently. At various points in both partner-
ships, negotiations nearly broke off and threatened the
continued existence of the partnerships. In the Grand Can-
yon Forest Partnership, some of these negotiations in-
volved groups that were not formally partners but were
capable of obstructing the process if not satisfied. Ulti-
mately, in both efforts, participants made compromises to
craft an action all of the major interests would support,
usually by reducing the scope and intensity of proposed
actions.
Once these concessions were made, most members of each
partnership believed that they had appeased the important
stakeholders. Both groups recognized that there were out-
lier groups that had not been satisfied but dismissed their
power to obstruct the process because of the agreement
among participants and apparent public support.
In both cases, environmental groups that had not actively
participated in project formation, and opposed the concept of
collaborative management more generally, sought to stop
these first projects through the administrative appeals pro-
cess. In both cases, an environmental organization pursued
administrative appeals using the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA) that led the Regional Offices to require
that the respective National Forests (Rogue River National
Forest in southern Oregon, Coconino National Forest of
northern Arizona) modify the environmental assessments
to meet the demands of appellants. In the case of the Grand
Canyon project, some environmentalists remained unsatis-
fied and pursued legal settlement in the courts.
Contrasting Responses
These successful appeals tremendously impacted the
morale and internal cohesion of both partnerships. The
tenuous and often strained accommodations these unlikely
partners had created now began to fray. Internal dissension
over strategy began to grow. It is at this point that the real
differences between these two partnerships begin to become
more apparent.
The Applegate Partnership—As the older of the two
partnership groups, more time and history are available to
consider the effects of external opposition on the Applegate’s
orientation. The Applegate’s focus on social change and
informal structure allowed the group to shift substantive
focus temporarily and continue to work on institutional
change and citizen involvement. When the Forest Service
project stalled, the group shifted its attention to the develop-
ment of similar management changes with the Bureau of
Land Management and private landowners.
For the Applegate, the initial challenges created by the
appeal of its premier project were only the beginning of its
tribulations. The success of the appeal of the Applegate

Problem Solving or Social Change? The Applegate and Grand Canyon Forest Partnerships
Moseley and KenCairn
Partnership’s first project, called Partnership One, sub-
stantially shifted the balance of opinion within the envi-
ronmental community. (It should be noted, however, that
Partnership One was not simply challenged from the envi-
ronmental side. The timber industry also opposed the sale by
not bidding for the timber once the Forest Service gained
approval to proceed.) The lead environmental organization
in the Partnership, Headwaters, eventually bowed to pres-
sure from the rest of the environmental community and
withdrew from the Partnership.
Although the Headwater’s withdrawal was a public blow
for the partnership and emotionally anguishing for many
participants, ironically, it did not substantially change the
makeup of the partnership. Two of the three the individuals
representing Headwaters continued to participate in the
partnership. These were people who were both representa-
tives of Headwaters and residents of the local Applegate
community. When Headwaters withdrew its formal organi-
zational support, these people continued to participate, now
as community residents active in local watershed groups.
As it tried to recover from what many assumed would be
a fatal blow—Headwaters’s departure—the partnership took
yet another major hit. Paradoxically, this time the source of
the damage was the timber industry. In an effort to invali-
date President Clinton’s Northwest Forest Plan, represen-
tatives of regional and national timber organizations sued
the federal government, arguing that the Plan’s creation
violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). Passed
in the early 1970s, Congress designed FACA to reduce the
influence of special interests on federal agency policy mak-
ing, especially defense contractors on Pentagon planning
and decisionmaking. FACA outlined a series of provisions
that federal agencies must follow if it participates in any
joint decisionmaking processes with nonagency groups.
Afraid that it might jeopardize the huge investments it
had made in the development of the Northwest Forest Plan,
the Clinton Administration ordered all public agencies to
withdraw from partnerships or other collaborative efforts
that might violate FACA. Agency officials who had been
formal partners in the Applegate process could no longer be
Applegate Partnership board members. Despite their
pledges to continue to participate as nondecisionmaking
members, the basic foundation on which that the partner-
ship had been built was now shattered. In the span of just
6 months, the Applegate Partnership lost two of its organi-
zational constituents.
Facing these difficult events, the Applegate Partnership
went through an important internal reevaluation and meta-
morphosis. Throughout its early period, the Applegate had
attempted to balance two sometimes-opposing roles. The
Applegate group viewed itself as an effort to make peace
between two opposing forces and the federal agencies caught
in the crossfire. Much of its early notoriety and influence was
derived from the perception that it was a model for resolving
otherwise intractable conflict in federal land management.
At the same time, the partnership was, from its outset, a
solidly community-based, community-driven initiative. It
was as likely to have a potluck as a conference. Its weekly
meetings were designed to be accessible to community people.
Meeting participation was open to all and locals frequently
outnumbered their agency and interest group counterparts
who were paid to attend.
With its first major project stalled indefinitely and two of
is major power brokers formally withdrawn from the leader-
ship of the group, the Applegate reconsidered its focus and
constituency. It broadened its focus to include a wider range
of community issues. Aware that community support was
now essential, the Applegate initiated a major community
outreach and assessment process to identify the range of
community concerns and ideas. From this and other forms of
informal outreach, partnership activists launched a broad
set of local initiatives. For example, one subset of partici-
pants was interested in private land restoration that would
improve wild salmon fisheries.
At the same time, the partnership began working more
actively with the BLM to evaluate restoration projects on its
land. Over time, with considerable perseverance, the part-
nership developed ways to work with the federal agencies
that did not involve formal joint decisionmaking. Within
6 months, the struggles over its first Forest Service project
and the consequences of FACA were largely forgotten as a
broader set of activities began to occupy the partnership’s
attention.
Three years after its founding, the consequences of this
shift from interest-based partnership to community-based
partnership could be clearly seen in the projects and accom-
plishments for which the partnership was either directly or
indirectly responsible. Beyond shifting of BLM manage-
ment in one resource area and private land restoration
projects, the Applegate Partnership began to publish a
bimonthly newspaper distributed to all 10,000 residences in
the watershed. It spun off a small-scale economic develop-
ment group looking at land-oriented small enterprise oppor-
tunities. Later, the partnership brokered a deal with one
county to have the community develop a management plan
and land use regulations related to gravel extraction. Part-
nership participants helped bring a county park under
community management after the county shut it down
because of a lack of funding. Repeatedly the Applegate
Partnership took on the task of mediating conflict and
brokering agreements between community residents and
government agencies, be they federal, state, or county. At
every turn, partnership activists argued for different pro-
cesses that included community residents earlier in plan-
ning processes, bringing together conflicting parties to find
common ground.
As we see, then, when faced with blockages such as the
administrative appeal of the Partnership One project and
then FACA, Applegate Partnership participants did not give
up. Rather, they fell back on their larger goals of social
change and ecosystem management in the watershed. These
broad goals allowed the group to conceive a wide variety of
particular projects to achieve their ends. This broadening
was possible because, from the beginning, a substantial
proportion of its active participants saw themselves as
community residents first and organizational representa-
tives second.
The Grand Canyon Forest Partnership—When faced
with opposition the Applegate Partnership broadened its
variety of strategies and shifted its attention from stalled to
viable projects. In contrast, the Grand Canyon group’s nar-
row problem definition limited its room for maneuver when
confronted by effective opposition.

Problem Solving or Social Change? The Applegate and Grand Canyon Forest Partnerships
Founded in the summer of 1996, when fires burned over
40,000 acres of northern Arizona forests, the Grand Canyon
Forest Partnership’s proposals to develop restoration and
wildfire reduction programs had enjoyed wide public sup-
port. After 2 years of working out its proposal internally, the
partnership held a series of public meetings to communicate
its proposal to the public. The partnership outlined thin-
ning, prescribed fire, and also a series of recreation manage-
ment proposals, including the closure of some popular trails
and remote roads.
To the surprise of many organizers, the public seemed to
broadly support extensive forest thinning and prescribed
fire. People could not yet visualize the posttreatment ap-
pearance of the restored areas, but were supportive of
reducing the potential for wildfires that could threaten
human life and property. This bolstered the partnership’s
perception that the community was behind its efforts to
develop a restoration/wildfire hazard reduction strategy.
In contrast, the meeting that focused on recreation use
generated substantial concern and some controversy. Ru-
mors began circulating that the Grand Canyon group was
attempting to exclude one or another recreation user group.
A nascent opposition to the partnership’s efforts began to
organize, creating unlikely alliances between mountain bike
users, ATV enthusiasts, equestrian advocates, and others. It
quickly became apparent that recreation issues could be-
come a flash point for opposition to the overall restoration
initiative.
In response, the group decided to narrow its focus and
exclude the controversial elements of the recreation plan
from the proposed action. The group discussed the possibil-
ity of developing a restoration task group to convene a
collaborative process with recreation interests. After a se-
ries of tentative steps in this direction, the effort was
dropped and Grand Canyon participants focused on develop-
ing and implementing the thinning and fire treatments.
Confident that it now had a broad public mandate to
proceed, the Grand Canyon Forest Partnership and the
Forest Service drafted the environmental assessment and
prepared for formal public review. However, throughout the
preparation of the final proposal, the partnership experi-
enced agonizing disagreements with prominent local and
regional environmentalists over a variety of provisions. For
example, the Forest Service began a series of test plots using
a range of treatments. The graphic reality of the actual
treatment impacts nearly destroyed the fragile agreements
that had been crafted with these environmental groups. Yet
despite these setbacks, partnership leaders continued to
make concessions and deferrals that maintained the truce
and allowed the project to proceed. Having conceded to most
of the demands made by these groups, the partnership and
the Forest Service were confident its proposed action would
withstand any outside challenges.
It was no surprise when an environmental group from
outside the area filed an appeal. But the partnership was
shocked when the Regional Office of the Forest Service
upheld the appeal. A group that most had dismissed as an
irrelevant outsider was now a champion trumpeting its vic-
tory around the country. A partnership regarded as a national
model for transcending the gridlock of federal forest man-
agement found itself buried in political mud.
The defeat created a period of internal disorder within the
partnership. The timelines that had been established for
implementing treatments were now irrelevant. Efforts to
develop markets for the restoration byproducts, a step es-
sential to making the restoration treatments economically
viable, were destroyed as entrepreneurs canceled plans to
invest in new tools and technology. Other financial re-
sources the partnership was pursuing also evaporated as
word spread that the partnership was stalled.
These setbacks further aggravated nascent tensions within
the partnership over strategy and priorities. One faction
advocated for the partnership taking a leading role in re-
gional and national dialogues on the underlying issues of the
opponents of cross-interest collaborations. Others favored
abandoning the conciliatory approach in favor of aggressive
counterattack using legal challenges and high profile efforts
to question the credibility of opposing groups.
In response to these challenges, the partnership chose
again to narrow its focus. The primary focus of project
development shifted to fire hazard reduction projects in
proximity to human developments. At the same time, efforts
to secure final approval for the partnership’s first stalled
project began to focus on preparations for a direct legal battle
with project opponents. As the local agency officials made
the mandated changes to the document that the Forest
Service’s Regional Office had ordered, leading groups in the
partnership began formulating a legal strategy for interven-
ing in the event of a lawsuit.
Conclusion_____________________
Faced with complex and difficult natural resource man-
agement challenges, institutions and communities are in-
creasingly looking to multistakeholder collaborations as an
approach to developing widely supported solutions. These
collaborations face many similar challenges: how to inte-
grate diverse interests and issues, how to share
decisionmaking authority, and how to organize resources
and expertise necessary to develop solutions.
The prevailing perception within these groups about the
nature of the problem they face and how it can be most
effectively addressed largely shaped the choices these groups
made in addressing these common challenges. With two ex-
amples, we suggested that the perception of the problem can
shape the strategy and conduct of the resulting collaborations.
Given the central importance of this initial perception of
the problem, we have gone further to try and explain why
two partnership facing relatively similar circumstances
developed different perceptions of the problem and strate-
gies for addressing it. We have asserted that the institu-
tional context in which a partnership takes place determines
much of this initial orientation. In settings rich with pre-
existing institutions—Federal agencies, local governments,
and nongovernmental organizations—it appears that col-
laborations are more likely to have a technocratic problem
solving orientation. Circumstances without this density of
institutions leave more of the influence over the character of
the collaboration in the hands of the private citizens who
create the impetus for formation.
Given the prior history and experience in social change
work—environmental, labor, and peace activism—among

Problem Solving or Social Change? The Applegate and Grand Canyon Forest Partnerships
Moseley and KenCairn
many of its founding organizers, it is perhaps predictable
that the Applegate initiative viewed its challenge as less a
technical problem and more of a social issue. As a conse-
quence, the strategies it selected and the ways it adapted to
changes and challenges are markedly different than those of
the Grand Canyon Forest Partnership.
Our intention in this paper is not to make explicit or
implicit judgments of the value or effectiveness of one
strategy over another. Few collaborative efforts have existed
long enough to reasonably evaluate their performance
history. In drawing distinctions between these two part-
nerships our intention has been to underscore the forma-
tive influences that shape the evolution and activities of a
partnership. In so doing we hope to contribute to the set
distinctions that will enable both practitioners and re-
searchers to more clearly understand the similarities and
differences between initiatives.

Ecological Wilderness Restoration:
Attitudes Toward Restoring the
Mount Logan Wilderness
Marcy A. DeMillion
Martha E. Lee
Abstract—By law, wilderness areas are intended to be unmarred
landscapes where evidence of modern civilization is generally ab-
sent. This presents a problem, since ecological wilderness condi-
tions have been impaired by human activities. For example, some
forest wilderness ecosystems have been altered by livestock graz-
ing, logging, fire exclusion, and through other environmental ma-
nipulations. Additionally, there are socio-political factors that must
be considered prior to discussing wilderness restoration methods.
This paper focuses on the need for ecological wilderness restoration
and presents options for managers to consider while discussing
wilderness restoration. To determine the most preferred wilderness
restoration method among communities located near the Bureau of
Land Management Arizona Strip Field Office, a social survey was
conducted that focused on attitudes of community residents living
in proximity to the Mount Logan Wilderness, which is in northern
Arizona within the Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument.
The study focused on this wilderness because an ecological restora-
tion project was occurring outside the wilderness boundary. The
survey was designed to determine the local acceptance of a mechani-
cal, nonmechanical, or prescribed fire wilderness restoration method.
Mechanical methods are often the most controversial, but survey
respondents held the most positive attitude toward this method.
Introduction ____________________
According to the Wilderness Act of 1964 (P.L. 88-577),
management of wilderness includes “retaining its primeval
character…which is protected and managed so as to pre-
serve its natural conditions…with the imprint of man’s work
substantially unnoticeable.” This statement implies that
wildernesses have been protected and preserved, and that
they are in a natural state. According to Cole (2000), manag-
ing wildernesses for natural conditions, which includes the
absence of recent human influences, may be a desired
management outcome. It is debatable if wildernesses are in
a natural state, and we assert that many wildernesses have
not retained their natural conditions, as human evidence in
regards to past and present land manipulations are appar-
ent in many wilderness ecosystems. Additionally, prior to
the passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964, many wilder-
nesses did not have special management provisions, there-
fore, they were not treated differently than nonwildernesses.
Wildernesses may not be as pristine as policymakers be-
lieved 35 years ago when the Wilderness Act was passed
(Brunson 1995; Cole 1996; Murry 1996). Therefore, manag-
ers are now faced with the dilemma of determining if
wilderness restoration is necessary to return areas to more
natural conditions, and determining ways to restore wilder-
ness conditions through the least damaging and most appro-
priate wilderness restoration methods.
Proposed methods usually include mechanically reducing
fuels, the use of prescribed fire, or a combination of these
methods to restore the natural fire regime (Covington and
Moore 1994a; Landres and others 2000). For wildernesses,
these types of restoration methods may not be a popular
option and would have to consider NEPA (National Environ-
mental Policy Act of 1970) in assessing environmental im-
pacts. Also, it may not be possible to develop ecologically,
economically, and politically acceptable restoration man-
agement regimes, especially for wilderness and other natu-
ral areas (Covington and Moore 1994a). To determine the
acceptability for restoration of the Mount Logan Wilderness,
Northern Arizona University, with input from the Bureau of
Land Management (BLM), designed a survey to determine
which types of wilderness restoration methods may be con-
sidered a wilderness management option. The survey of
local communities did not ask respondents if they would like
to see a combination of methods. Instead, it focused on which
restoration methods the local communities preferred. A
local sample was selected because managers wanted to
determine attitudes of residents within proximity to the
wilderness and the amount of support they held toward
wilderness restoration methods. Managers will have to
decide, from an ecological standpoint, how wilderness resto-
ration methods can be combined to meet restoration goals,
while considering socio-political factors.

Ecological Wilderness Restoration: Attitudes Toward Restoring the Mount Logan Wilderness
DeMillion and Lee
Wilderness Changes _____________
Western wildernesses have changed drastically since the
time of Euro-American settlement in the 1800s. To deter-
mine the ecological changes in the Mount Logan Wilderness,
a forest reconstruction was completed prior to conducting a
social survey. In reconstructing the wilderness, a pre Euro-
American reference date of 1870 was determined and se-
lected as the reference condition. This reference condition
(date) was selected because it represented a measurable and
replicable point in time, and a time previous to a large
human population influx that created noticeable human
impacts. For example, in southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus
ponderosa), Euro-American settlers introduced livestock
grazing, logging, and fire exclusion, which contributed to
changes in the forest structure (Covington and others 1994,
1997; Covington and Moore 1994b; Fielder and others 1996;
Swetnam and Baisan 1996). The disruption of the natural
fire regime created the most pervasive source of degradation
in ponderosa pine ecosystems (DeMillion and Covington
2000), increased the susceptibility of insect and disease
outbreaks (Kolb and others 1994), and has allowed tree
densities to increase. The result is dense forests, rather than
the open and parklike forests that were described by early
Euro-American settlers (Cooper 1960; Covington and others
1994; Covington and Moore 1994a; Fulé and others 1997).
In the Mount Logan Wilderness, the forest reconstruction
determined that the tree density in 1870 was 36 trees per
acre, versus today’s forest density of 571 trees per acre
(DeMillion 1999). Research has shown that an increase in
forest densities and fuels often leads to high intensity crown
fires (Arno and others 1995; Covington and Moore 1994a,b;
Covington and others 1994; Swetnam and Baisan 1996).
Research results from the Mount Logan Wilderness study
determined that wilderness forest conditions have been
dramatically altered, which is similar to results found out-
side this wilderness area (NAU 1996). If wilderness manag-
ers intend to restore this wilderness to conditions that
existed prior to Euro-American settlement, they must con-
sider restoration methods in tandem with socio-political
factors to decide when and how to restore the wilderness.
Ecological Wilderness
Restoration ____________________
The Wilderness Act of 1964 defines wilderness as “an area
of undeveloped Federal land.” Unfortunately, undeveloped
areas do not always equate to unchanged or unmanipulated
landscapes. The majority of western wildernesses have been
manipulated by Euro-American settlers and other external
influences. The question that wilderness managers need to
answer is, should restoration methods be used to replicate
conditions previous to modern human impacts? If wilder-
ness restorative actions are taken, the sense of wildness
and the belief that an area is free of human manipulation is
compromised (Landres and others 2000). If actions are
not taken, high intensity fires will start in wildernesses and
spread beyond their boundaries to rural and urban
communities.
Two examples of fires in 2000 that began in wildernesses
are the Cerro Grande (Bandelier National Park) fire that
interfaced with Los Alamos, New Mexico, and the Clear
Creek (Salmon-Challis National Forest) fire that began in
the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return and spread to
Panther Creek along the Salmon River in Idaho. Both fires
started in wilderness and spread from wildland areas to
urban or rural communities destroying structures and in
some instances livelihoods. Fuel loadings within and outside
of the wilderness boundaries in both locations were similar
and the fires did not stop at the administrative boundaries.
Due to the heightened awareness of fire and other factors,
some land managers are beginning to explore the socio-
political concerns that the public holds toward restoring
wildernesses. Managers of the BLM Arizona Strip Field
Office wanted to conduct a survey to determine the range of
alternatives and the types of wilderness restoration meth-
ods that might be acceptable to local community residents.
Mount Logan Ecological Wilderness
Restoration Methods
Community residents within proximity to the Mount
Logan Wilderness were surveyed to determine their attitude
toward mechanical, nonmechanical, and prescribed fire wil-
derness restoration methods. Within the survey, a mechani-
cal method was defined as any activity where machines are
used to cut and/or transport personnel or material. An
example of this would be the use of chainsaws to reduce
small diameter trees, decrease ladder fuels around old
growth trees and snags, and create fuel breaks. Mechanical
methods could also include the use of motorized equipment
and vehicles with wheels or tracks. A nonmechanical method
was defined as any activity that involved a living power
source, for example, the use of a handsaw, hand rake, or
horses. A prescribed fire method was defined as intention-
ally igniting and controlling fires. This definition is different
from the national definition that described prescribed fire as
“any fire ignited by management actions under certain,
predetermined conditions to meet specific objectives related
to hazardous fuels or habitat improvement. A written, ap-
proved prescribed fire plan must exist, and NEPA require-
ments must be met prior to ignition.” This definition was not
used because the terminology may have been confusing, it
may have been too lengthy, and it does not refer to prescribed
fire as a restoration method.
Attitudes Toward Wilderness Restoration
Methods
The Arizona Strip Field Office, BLM and Northern Ari-
zona University surveyed communities within proximity to
the Mount Logan Wilderness about their attitude toward
wilderness restoration methods. The wilderness is within
the Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument in Ari-
zona and was selected because an ecological restoration
project was under way in areas outside the wilderness
boundary. The closest communities to the wilderness in-
clude St. George, Kanab, and Hurricane in Utah, and

Fredonia and Colorado City in Arizona. Residents within
these communities were selected to respond to a survey
about the use of mechanical, nonmechanical, and prescribed
fire wilderness restoration methods. Managers wanted to
determine the attitudes that local community residents held
toward these specific wilderness restoration methods.
To conduct the survey, a mail-back questionnaire was
designed, pre-tested, and sent to a random sample of 1,000
residents. Questionnaires were sent to 500 residents of
St. George, Utah (urban sample), with another 500 sent to
residents in two rural communities in Utah (Kanab and
Hurricane) and two rural communities in Arizona (Fredonia
and Colorado City). The overall survey response rate was 55
percent. There were no significant differences in attitudes
toward ecological restoration treatments between respon-
dents in the urban and rural samples.
Attitudes Toward a Mechanical Treatment—The
most favorable response was for the mechanical method,
with 74 percent of the respondents holding a positive atti-
tude (table 1). We suggest that positive attitudes toward a
mechanical method are likely to be higher among local
communities than among residents from a regional or na-
tional sample. Research on attitudes has shown that the
more familiar people are with an attitude object (subject),
the more supportive they are toward that object (Bruvold
1973; Chaiken and Stangor 1987; Fazio 1982). In other
words, residents of the communities we surveyed may be
more familiar with the use of mechanical methods, and
therefore may have a more positive attitude toward them.
Options for Wilderness Ecological
Restoration ____________________
Every wilderness restoration method is controversial.
Mechanical treatments have potential wilderness impacts,
nonmechanical treatments (the use of hand raking around
all old-growth trees) may not be a viable option on a landscape
scale, and the use of prescribed fire creates the potential for
stand-replacing fires, especially in proposed or designated
wildernesses, where fuels are rarely reduced prior to burn-
ing. Often prescribed fires become high intensity and uncon-
trollable wildfires, due to years of fuel accumulations. One
example of this is the Yellowstone National Park prescribed
natural fire ignitions of 1988, which burned under a fire
prescription without a prior reduction in fuels and became
uncontrollable. Firefighters frantically reduced fuels with
mechanical methods by cutting trees in a matter of days
instead of over a number of years (Wakimoto 1990). This
illustrates the need in some wildernesses to reduce fuels
prior to reintroducing fire, or prior to allowing naturally
ignited fires to burn under certain fire prescriptions.
Some managers may be limited to only the use of pre-
scribed fire as a wilderness restoration method, because of
socio-political concerns with the use mechanical methods.
Some people believe that the use of mechanical restoration
methods is an unacceptable way to enhance the naturalness
of these areas (Parsons and Landres 1998), but others
believe that manual removal of fuels should precede the use
of prescribed fire (Noss 1991).
Regardless of the restoration methods selected to reduce
forest fuels, managers are aware that wildfires will continue
to occur across legislative and administrative boundaries.
The wilderness ignitions that led to the high intensity
Cerros Grande and Clear Creek fires of 2000 are forcing
managers to evaluate the range of wilderness restoration
alternatives, especially where rural and urban communities
interface with wildernesses.
Conclusions____________________
Unhealthy forest conditions result from altered wilder-
ness conditions that are inhibiting natural processes. Years
of grazing, logging, and fire exclusion have altered forest
wilderness ecosystems. These altered landscapes are condu-
cive to unnaturally intense and often stand-replacing fires.
Managers need to decide if wildernesses should be left
unmanipulated or be restored to more natural conditions
(Cole 1996).
Restoration outside wildernesses usually entails the use
of mechanical methods to reduce fuels, along with the use of
prescribed fire to restore the natural fire regime. Using
mechanical methods prior to the use of prescribed fire may
not seem to be a popular option among the general public,
but the social research presented above concluded that
mechanical methods were the most acceptable and preferred
wilderness restoration method. These results were taken
into consideration by the Arizona Strip Field Office, BLM,
but management decisions are not based upon the results of
Table 1—Attitudes toward the use of three restoration methods in the
Mount Logan Wilderness.

Attitudes Toward a Nonmechanical and a Prescribed
Fire Treatment—Slightly over 50 percent of the respon-
dents held positive attitudes toward using a nonmechanical
and a prescribed fire wilderness restoration method to
restore the Mount Logan Wilderness. Respondents with
positive attitudes toward these methods agreed that restor-
ing the wilderness in a natural way is good. In comparing our
results with other studies that focused on prescribed fire, we
found similarities. Results from a regional sample of Mon-
tana and Wyoming residents showed that 55 percent of the
residents supported prescribed fire, compared to 48 percent
of a national sample (Manfredo and others 1990). Between
our results and other studies, there appears to be support for
using prescribed fire as a management tool to restore the
Mount Logan Wilderness, as well as other wilderness areas.

this one study. The study did create the impetus for the BLM
to begin a dialog about wilderness restoration among diverse
regional public groups. Managers are encouraged to discuss
wilderness restoration methods if they want to restore
wilderness conditions to a more natural state and decrease
the potential for wilderness fires to interface with rural and
urban communities. Wilderness managers considering socio-
political parameters are struggling to determine when wil-
derness restoration is appropriate and the range of restora-
tion methods that can be employed.

Incorporating Ecological and Nonecological
Concerns in the Restoration of a Rare, High-
Elevation Bebb Willow Riparian Community

Abstract—Activities were initiated by The Nature Conservancy,
the USDA Forest Service, and the Northern Arizona University
School of Forestry and Department of Geology in 1996 to restore
hydrologic and ecological function to a high-elevation Bebb willow
(Salix bebbiana) and mixed grass riparian community in Hart
Prairie, near Flagstaff, AZ. Initial restoration removed small water
diversions above the willow community to restore hydrologic flow to
the downslope community. Because of the small scale of this effort,
the viewshed, recreation, and wildlife in the area were not affected.
Subsequent monitoring indicated that although restoration in-
creased water availability and improved Bebb willow water status,
soil moisture conditions were still below those needed for willow
seed germination and seedling growth. Therefore, the long-term
sustainability of the Bebb willow community is still at risk. Current
restoration plans are to manipulate the upslope watershed to
provide additional water needed for willow regeneration. This
restoration will include removing stock tanks, thinning trees en-
croaching into the meadow above the willows, and burning to
restore the upslope area to its historic nonforested, prairie condi-
tion. These plans could significantly impact aesthetics, wildlife, and
recreation in the area. In addition, Indian Tribes who consider the
San Francisco Peaks to be sacred and the general public may have
concerns with these restoration activities. This paper discusses our
efforts to address these issues while still providing sufficient ecosys-
tem restoration for long-term sustainability of the Bebb willow-
mixed grass community.
Introduction ____________________
In Arizona, upland riparian communities located at eleva-
tions above 2,500 m consist of small plant stringers occupy-
ing channels of first- and second-order streams (Debano and
Schmidt 1990). They are largely supported by shallow ground
water, and are typically in meadows at the base of water-
sheds dominated by mixed conifers and ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa Laws.). The upland riparian community at
Hart Prairie near Flagstaff, Arizona, has a Bebb willow
(Salix bebbiana Sarg.) and trembling aspen (Populus
tremuloides Michx.) overstory with a grass understory. This
type of upland riparian community is rare in Arizona and
supports high levels of wildlife and plant community diver-
sity. Both aspen and Bebb willow are listed by the USDA
Forest Service (USFS) as species of concern due to their
biodiversity, aesthetic, and wildlife habitat values. Upland
riparian communities such as Hart Prairie make important
contributions to the biodiversity necessary for resilient and
healthy ecosystems at the regional/landscape level (Noss
1990). Unfortunately, many of these communities, including
Hart Prairie, do not have adequate regeneration to sustain
themselves and are thus considered unhealthy (Briggs and
others 1994).
Abundant shallow ground water supplied through perched
aquifers is the critical factor for maintaining healthy upland
riparian communities such as at Hart Prairie. These perched
aquifers occur discontinuously across the Colorado Plateau.
They have limited storage and require annual recharge
through runoff and infiltration from heavy snowpacks and
consistent precipitation. In high elevation areas in the
Western United States, approximately 70 to 90 percent of
annual streamflow originates from these types of events
(Troendle 1983). Drought, surface water diversions such as
stock tanks and dams, and water loss through increased tree
transpiration modify hydrologic function by changing the
quantity and timing of the water recharge to these perched
aquifers and the subsequent water delivery to riparian
ecosystems at the base of watersheds. These factors are
likely causing a decline in the health of the Bebb willow
riparian community at Hart Prairie (Avery 1991; Church
2000; Gavin 1998).
Initial Restoration Efforts _________
Restoration of hydrologic and ecological function to the
Hart Prairie Bebb willow riparian community began in
1996–1997 through a cooperative project involving The
Nature Conservancy (TNC), USFS and the Northern Ari-
zona University (NAU) School of Forestry and Department
of Geology. This restoration project was funded by the
Arizona Water Protection Fund (grants 95-006WPF and 96-
0019WPF) and NAU School of Forestry. The restoration
involved digging out two small earthen dams that were
diverting water out of its original channel away from the

DeWald and Springer
downslope Bebb willow riparian area. The original channel
was reconstructed by removing debris that had accumulated
in it, and rock weirs were constructed in the channel to slow
high-flow water velocities. Drainages that had been divert-
ing water from the original channel were blocked using
sediment and rocks removed from the original channel. In
addition to the channel work, restoration activities included
constructing wire fences around some of the Bebb willow
populations to protect them from overgrazing by deer and
elk. The fencing and channel restoration activities were all
completed using hand tools.
An extensive monitoring network was established to mea-
sure hydrologic and Bebb willow responses to the restora-
tion. This monitoring network included a drilling series of
shallow wells, setting up soil moisture monitoring points,
and inserting a metal “H”-flume at the base of the watershed
to measure surface and subsurface water movement within
and out of the base of the watershed. A permanent weather
station was set up in a nonforested area of the meadow near
the top of the Bebb willow riparian community to collect a
variety of weather data, and an electric fence surrounding
the weather tower was constructed to protect the electronics
from deer and elk. Finally, Bebb willow water status and
regeneration were also measured. Details of these restora-
tion and monitoring activities are described in Gavin (1998)
and Church (2000).
Because restoration of the channel primarily involved
redistribution of soil and rocks already present, and it did
not change the visual appearance of the area, water sources
for wildlife were not decreased and there were no impacts to
hikers, bicyclists, and skiers in the area. However, there
have been concerns expressed by the public regarding the
monitoring equipment. The “H”-flume measuring streamflow
at the base of the watershed has been tampered with, and
the 7-foot tall, silver-colored weather tower with its electric
fence is an eyesore. In response to the public’s concerns, the
exterior of the weather tower and the fence posts around it
were painted to blend better into the environment to im-
prove aesthetics of this monitoring station. In addition,
alternative fencing is being considered.
Results of the monitoring activities indicated that the
initial restoration only partially restored hydrologic func-
tion (Church 2000; Gavin 1998). Moisture conditions in the
riparian system have improved, but they were still below
those needed in the late spring for successful Bebb willow
seed germination and early seedling growth. Church (2000)
reported that the Bebb willow trees were producing abun-
dant viable seed (85 percent germination under laboratory
conditions), but soils were too dry during seed dissemination
to support Bebb willow regeneration. Therefore, although
the restoration activities improved conditions for the adult
trees, they did not provide for the long-term sustainability of
this riparian community.
Past riparian restoration efforts including those at Hart
Prairie illustrate the importance of evaluating the condition
of a degraded riparian area from a watershed perspective.
Because of the close connection between upslope and down-
stream processes, riparian restoration efforts must avoid
the approach that was taken at Hart Prairie where recovery
strategies were based solely on an evaluation of the immedi-
ate degraded riparian site (Briggs 1996). Addressing iso-
lated components of a watershed such as was done at Hart
Prairie is ecologically incomplete; to be complete, restora-
tion must address conditions in the upslope watershed.
In the case of the Hart Prairie area, a thick cover of grass
and high density of ponderosa pine and white pine (Pinus
strobiformis Engelm.) now dominate the meadow above the
Bebb willow riparian community. These conditions are in
contrast to historic photographs of Hart Prairie showing a
meadow with light grass cover and only a few scattered
trees. The increased grass cover and encroachment of woody
tree species from the upper watershed into the meadow are
the result of fire suppression and grazing. This encroach-
ment of pines is consistent with increases in the number of
trees per acre on National Forest lands in Arizona and New
Mexico over the past 30 years (Covington and Moore 1994).
In high-elevation meadows such as Hart Prairie, the en-
croaching pine forest competes with the downslope riparian
communities for ground water stored in the perched aqui-
fers. Restoration of the upslope area back to historic condi-
tions would involve removing the pine trees where they have
encroached into the previously wet meadow, and prescribed
burning to reduce grass cover. Experiments in the Beaver
Creek watershed in Arizona show that streamflow can be
increased for 6–10 years following removal of trees in upslope
communities (Baker 1986; Brown and others 1974).
Ecological Concerns_____________
Complete restoration of the prairie meadow would remove
up to 90 percent of the ponderosa and white pines in the area
directly upslope from the Bebb willow community (fig. 1),
and prescribed burning would reduce grass density and
prevent future tree encroachment. In addition, a complete
restoration would remove stock tanks in the watershed
above the Bebb willow community. In 1998, NAU received
funding from the Arizona Water Protection Fund (grant 98-
050WPF) for a collaborative effort by NAU, TNC, and the
USFS to restore the watershed at Hart Prairie.
The first step in the restoration effort was to map and
measure all of the trees encroaching into the meadow. The
total amount of water lost to the downslope riparian commu-
nity from the encroaching trees will be estimated by NAU by
combining the tree size data with sapflow data collected
during the summer of 2000. This information will be used to
compare the amount of water released downslope following
different thinning treatments, which will help determine
the actual number and which trees to remove. Water lost due
to herbaceous vegetation transpiration is being measured by
NAU to determine the amount of water that would be
released downslope following prescribed burning. This in-
formation will also help determine the ecologically best
time(s) of the year to burn. For example, if the grasses are
using a lot of water during Bebb willow seed dissemination,
then a prescribed burn prior to willow seed dissemination
would be the best ecological time to burn.
There are five stock tanks currently being evaluated by
NAU to determine their effects on the downslope Bebb
willow community. This information will be used to direct
activities such as deconstruction of tanks, reduction in tank
size, and bank and channel reshaping. Tank removal and
mitigation will be based on field measurements, historical
photographs and maps, and other supporting information.

Incorporating Ecological and Nonecological Concerns in the Restoration of a Rare, High-Elevation Bebb Willow Riparian Community
The tree and tank removal, and prescribed burning will
increase water available to the riparian community, but in
contrast to the initial restoration efforts, these watershed
activities could also generate considerable public concern
due to their potentially significant aesthetic, wildlife, and
recreation impacts.
Nonecological Concerns _________
NAU, TNC, and the USFS conducted planning meetings
during 1999–2000 where impacts to the viewshed and recre-
ation from a full watershed restoration were discussed, and
modifications to the full restoration were developed to ad-
dress these concerns. In addition, public comments were
collected in response to the USFS Proposed Action describ-
ing the restoration, and concerns were collected from the
neighbors of TNC. The concerns raised during the planning
meetings and by the public are described below, and modi-
fications to the full restoration as a result of these concerns
are described in the next section.
The Hart Prairie area is popular with hikers, bikers, and
cross-country skiers, and the restoration treatment area is
within the Snowbowl ski area and proposed Arizona Trail
viewsheds. The removal of the large numbers and sizes of
trees involved in the full restoration is expected to have
negative aesthetic impacts. In addition to the aesthetics,
there are hazards to recreationists associated with downed
woody debris and snags that would be created by the tree
removal. Smoke from the proposed prescribed burning can
create health and aesthetic problems, and 2–3 foot firebreak
lines and road construction may also have negative aesthetic
effects. In addition, fears were expressed that the prescribed
burn would get out of control and destroy private property.
The San Francisco Peaks are considered a sacred place for
many of the Native American Tribes in the Southwest, so a
consultation process was set up with 13 Tribes to ensure that
potential cultural impacts of the proposed restoration were
considered. Tribes were also invited to Hart Prairie for a tour
and further discussion of the proposed watershed restora-
tion. During this consultation process, it was revealed that
the removal of the larger trees and the total number of trees
involved in the restoration have raised concerns. In addi-
tion, concerns were expressed regarding the time of year
when restoration activities would occur; the timing of such
activities should be compatible with Native American reli-
gious beliefs.
Many concerns were raised that the amount of open water
available for the diverse species of wildlife at Hart Prairie
will be reduced with the removal of stock tanks. In addition,
there was a great deal of opposition to the removal of
Snowbowl tank because this tank is used for education and
is a favorite spot for recreationists.
Incorporating Ecological and
Nonecological Concerns _________
In order to address concerns of the large numbers and
sizes of trees to be removed, the prairie meadow encroached
by the pines was divided into subwatersheds that were
prioritized in terms of their potential contribution to water
loss downslope. A subwatershed directly upslope from the
riparian community was identified as the first priority to be
thinned. This area represents less than one-third of the total
prairie meadow encroached by the pines, resulting in resto-
ration that will remove significantly fewer trees and will
therefore result in fewer aesthetic and safety impacts. Some

of the larger trees will be girdled to create snags rather than
removed to provide wildlife habitat. In addition, computer-
generated, visual simulations are being developed by NAU
from the mapping data to compare the current viewshed to
viewsheds following different thinning treatments. Loca-
tions, numbers, and sizes of trees that would be removed will
be included in the visualization of the different thinning
treatments. These simulations can be used to help design
the tree removal to minimize negative aesthetics and to
inform the public about what is being removed and what the
viewshed will look like. Finally, “fuzzy” boundaries will be
created between the restored area and the areas of the
meadow not being restored to further minimize visual im-
pacts. Some of the tanks will be reduced in size rather than
removed in order to maintain the wildlife benefits they
currently provide, and a “wildlife drinker” will be installed
in the area to provide access to water lost due to the stock
tank removal. Despite the fact that Snowbowl tank prevents
water from entering the channel directly above the Bebb
willow community, it will most likely not be modified due to
public sentiment not wanting this tank to be removed.
Finally, the timing of restoration activities will be compat-
ible with Native American religious beliefs, and attempts
will be made to burn when recreational and aesthetic im-
pacts would be minimized.
As a result of addressing nonecological concerns associ-
ated with the full ecological restoration, the proposed activi-
ties will not fully restore the prairie meadow. However,
incorporation of nonecological concerns will still permit
restoration of one-third of the meadow and this should
provide significant additional water to the downslope Bebb
willow riparian community. Prerestoration data are still
being collected, and the Tribal consultation and public
comment processes are ongoing. Once these processes and
the restoration activities are completed, the postrestoration
monitoring will tell us whether further restoration is needed
to provide additional water flow to the Bebb willow riparian
community.

Financial Results of Ponderosa Pine Forest
Restoration in Southwestern Colorado
Dennis L. Lynch
Abstract—From 1996 to 1998, the Ponderosa Pine Partnership
conducted an experimental forest restoration project on 493 acres of
small diameter ponderosa pine in the San Juan National Forest,
Montezuma County, Colorado. The ecological basis and the finan-
cial analysis for this project are discussed. Specific financial results
of the project including products sold, revenues collected, harvest-
ing costs incurred, and profits or losses realized are reported.
Restoration costs are also compared with fire suppression costs
experienced both in Colorado and nationwide. Using data collected
since the conclusion of the project, the future potential for financing
forest restoration in southwestern Colorado is explored.
Introduction ____________________
This paper presents specific financial results from a forest
restoration project conducted by the Ponderosa Pine Part-
nership in southwestern Colorado. This Partnership was
created by a group of organizations to explore potential
benefits of forest restoration and includes Montezuma
County, San Juan National Forest, Ft Lewis College, Colo-
rado Timber Industry Association (CTIA), Colorado State
Forest Service, College of Natural Resources, and Coopera-
tive Extension at Colorado State University (CSU). The
Partnership was formed because the County and the San
Juan National Forest were concerned about several prob-
lems present in the 183,000 acre ponderosa pine forest
northeast of Cortez, CO. These problems included:
• Potential for insect and disease outbreaks
• Risk of catastrophic forest fires
• Decline of small forest product businesses
• Recognition that ponderosa pine forests in this area are
not within their range of natural variability and are
probably not sustainable in their current condition
(Romme 1999).
Dr. William Romme, professor in the Department of Biol-
ogy at Ft Lewis College, Durango, CO, had principal respon-
sibility for ecological data collection, development of an
ecological prescription for this experimental forest restora-
tion project, and subsequent monitoring. In his previous
research in southwestern Colorado (Montezuma, La Plata,
and Archuleta Counties) Romme (1999) reached generally
similar conclusions as research from Arizona and New
Mexico (Cooper 1960; Covington and others 1997; Dahms
and Geils 1997; Fulé and others 1997). He found that in this
forest area there were seven times more trees per acre today
than in 1900. Specifically, there are 280 to 390 trees per acre
today versus 40 to 50 trees per acre in 1900. Stands were
characterized in 1900 by clumps of trees. These clumps were
typically one-tenth to one-quarter acre in size, while today
the clumped pattern of stands has largely been lost. Stump
diameters of trees living in 1900 averaged 27 inches and ages
were likely to reach 300 years. Today 95 percent of the trees
are 16 inches in diameter at breast height or smaller and 110
years or less in age. Additionally, less than 20 percent of
today’s stands have pine regeneration. Mortality is also
disproportionate, occurring in the very young and oldest
trees.
He also discovered that fire frequencies have changed. For
example, in the forest area, of which this study is a part, he
found that during the period 1685–1872, the interval be-
tween fires ranged from 5 to 20 years, with a median of 12
years. In another part of the area he found that between
1729 to 1879 the range in fire frequency was 2 to 31 years
with a median of 10 years. Since 1879, there has not been a
fire that created a fire scar in most of the area.
On the basis of his research, Dr. Romme suggested that
the current forest could be modified and restored to condi-
tions similar to pre-1870 structure and processes. He de-
signed an ecological prescription that retained large trees,
developed the clumped nature of tree groups within the
forest, developed glades and parks between tree clumps,
reduced shrub understory while increasing the grass-forb
component, and reintroduced low intensity fire as a process.
A dominant concern of this study was to ensure that the
ecological prescription controlled implementation. It was
also obvious that forest restoration could not proceed unless
costs were paid. As previously stated, no government money
was available to implement this study. Further it was highly
unlikely that tax dollars would be appropriated to pay for
forest restoration in any situation except, perhaps, those
most severely threatening to life and property. Even then,
the material to be removed would have to be disposed of in
some way. Leaving thinning slash in the forest would only
increase fuel loading and the probability of intense fires.
Sackett (2000) commented that prescribed burning alone
has been unable to remove the volume of existing material
in the Chimney Springs, AZ, area forest to a healthy state,
let alone presettlement conditions. Recent catastrophic fires
in the Southwest also attest to the danger associated with
the use of prescribed fire alone. Therefore, this financial

study was conducted to determine harvesting costs and
potential revenues available from products removed in this
experimental attempt at forest restoration.
It is also important to recognize that forest restoration
projects are very different from typical timber sales. In forest
restoration, the material removed is the least desirable from
a product standpoint and may contain a predominance of
small diameter trees that cost more to remove than they are
worth. A large body of timber harvesting research, from the
United States and internationally, clearly documents that
manual or mechanical removal of small diameter trees is
expensive. Thus the basic premise of forest restoration,
which requires removing small trees and leaving the largest,
presents a difficult financial problem. This problem is fur-
ther complicated in Montezuma County because there are
only a few local industries available to process small diam-
eter material. Therefore, long haul distances are necessary
to take small material to processing points. Forest Service
procedures that required treating forest restoration activi-
ties as timber sales and an appraisal process that did not
accurately estimate values of the material removed made
the problem even more complex.
Carla Garrison Harper, representing Montezuma County,
served as project coordinator for the Ponderosa Pine Part-
nership. The Partnership completed forest restoration on six
representative sites in the Mancos-Dolores District of the
San Juan National Forest. However, because financial data
were incomplete and inconclusive on one unit, this report
discusses financial results for five of the areas completed.
These five study units totaled 492.6 acres. An overview of the
ecological prescription, restoration work, costs, and subse-
quent monitoring is included in a paper by Lynch and others
(2000). It does not, however, provide the cost detail pre-
sented here nor a comparison with wildfire costs.
Three key points should be emphasized:
• Dr. Romme’s ecological prescription was formed on the
basis of his previous research. The project objective was
to restore the forest toward the ecological balance he
envisioned.
• The Partnership did not have any Federally appropri-
ated money to use to subsidize the removal of small
diameter trees.
• After the largest trees had been retained in clumps, as
specified by the ecological prescription, the excess ma-
terial was removed and sold. The financial results
presented here are for that undesirable and excess
material. The project was not designed to make money,
but to determine if forest restoration work based on
good ecology could pay its way.
Description of Project
Implementation _________________
The five units selected for this study are representative of
forest conditions in this area and are quite similar in regard
to soil, slope, terrain, and access to haul roads. To implement
forest restoration it was necessary, under existing Forest
Service procedures, to transfer Dr. Romme’s ecological guide-
lines to a timber sale format. Phil Kemp, forester with the
Mancos-Dolores District, had primary responsibility for
applying Dr. Romme’s research and guidelines to develop
and implement ecological restoration prescriptions. The
retention of larger trees, and the clumped nature and spac-
ing of tree groups were key considerations. Phil developed
on-the-ground silvicutural prescriptions, and trained and
supervised crews to mark the trees to be retained in the
forest. He coordinated with Dr. Romme to develop a marking
guide that would achieve the desired forest condition. Trees
to be retained on the site were marked with blue paint.
Following marking of each unit in this study, a cruise was
conducted to determine the amount and character of the
material to be removed. The Forest Service, using this
information, prepared administrative timber sale contracts.
Montezuma County purchased each timber sale and ar-
ranged to pay for the wood removed and associated costs
such as road rock replacement and slash disposal. Initially,
costs to conduct the ecological and economic studies were
also to be charged to the timber sale. However, research
funds from other sources were secured to pay for the studies.
Timber volumes and subsequent payments were initially
based on cruise data that ultimately proved to be inaccurate.
Cruise estimates tended to overestimate the amount of
sawtimber available for removal and underestimate the
volume of POL material to be removed. Such faulty esti-
mates are of critical concern to both the Forest Service and
small businesses. Cruise estimates of timber are not only
costly to perform, but in forest restoration sales have the
potential to be very erroneous because there is such great
variation in the material to be removed. Therefore, weight
samples were taken from logs and truckloads of logs were
scaled after weighing to determine weight-volume relation-
ships. Subsequent payments were based on weight, which
proved to be more accurate and fair to both seller and
purchaser.
CTIA coordinated with local industry and the San Juan
National Forest to determine which industry firms were to
be involved in the project. Ragland and Sons Logging of
Dolores, CO, purchased the five timber sale units from
Montezuma County and had primary responsibility for
harvesting and marketing material removed from the forest.
The material removed was used to produce a variety of wood
products, some of which were experimental attempts to use
small diameter trees. Every effort was made to market logs
to processors in or near Montezuma County, but some small
diameter material simply could not be processed locally. The
bulk of this small material was taken as waferwood logs to
the oriented strand board plant in Olathe, CO. At the plant,
logs are debarked and processed through a waferizer, also
known as a flaker, to create wafers or strands for oriented
strand board production. Sawlogs from the sale were pro-
cessed at the Ragland’s Stonertop sawmill near Dolores into
timbers and lumber. Material brought to the mill was
appraised to all other possible mill sites and the value of the
logs estimated on that basis.
Ragland and Sons Logging utilized both manual (chain-
saws) and mechanical (JD 743 Harvester) equipment for
felling, limbing, and bucking (FLB) in this project. Slash was
lopped and scattered in place for prescribed burning. Skid-
ding was done with rubber-tired grapple skidders (CAT 518
and JD 540). Logs were loaded with a knuckle boom loader
on conventional log trucks for transportation by product

type to various mills. All trucks were weighed on scales to
determine the amount of material removed.
We followed a program of adaptive management. As each
unit was completed we reviewed the results to ensure that
appropriate changes were made in the next unit to improve
ecological accomplishment (Lynch and others 2000). Follow-
ing logging, broadcast burning of slash by the Forest Service
was used to reintroduce fire to the forest. Prescribed burning
of these areas in later years will be done at intervals that are
historically characteristic of these forests. This should re-
sult in low intensity fires in the future. Ecological monitor-
ing of these areas is continuing.
Financial Studies and Results _____
Study Methodology
In this financial study, we recorded every tree cut by
diameter class. Distributions of trees removed by unit and
diameter class are shown in figure 1. Every log skidded and
every log loaded onto a truck were also counted. All trucks
were weighed to determine the tons hauled by product type.
The relationship of products other than logs (POL) to sawlog
material by unit is shown in figure 2. Samples were taken
from logs and sample truckloads were scaled by a Forest
Service scaler to determine weight to volume relationships.
Complete records of time and costs for all aspects of the
operation were collected using established logging cost col-
lection techniques. These included all costs associated with
labor, equipment, oil, gas, diesel, supplies, field and office
administration, and transportation involved in felling,
limbing, bucking, skidding, loading, slash treatment (except
prescribed burning), roads, and hauling logs. These costs are
specific to the company participating in this study, so item-
ized cost information is not presented in order to respect the
privacy of the firm. Revenues for each product were recorded
and profit or loss calculated. The efficiency of the logger was
compared to USDA Forest Service  regional average harvest-
ing costs and harvesting cost studies in New Mexico, Ari-
zona, Oregon, and Canada. Correlation analysis was used to
compare the characteristics of units 1, 5B, 5E, and Joyce
with unit profit. Initial analysis indicated that factors asso-
ciated with the cold temperatures and deep snow in Unit 4
inflated costs and would bias results. Only correlations
above 0.8 (+ or –) were considered strong enough to merit
consideration.
Unit Results
Unit 1—Also known as the Smoothing Iron unit, Unit 1 is
located on Haycamp Mesa and is 125 acres. A total of 6,754
trees were removed from the unit during August 25 to
October 3, 1995. Figure 1 shows tree distribution by diam-
eter class. In this unit, 1 cubic foot of ponderosa pine log at
the landing weighed 71.78 lb with a standard deviation of
5.11 lb
The removal of trees resulted in the delivery of 1,232.76
tons of sawlogs to Stonertop sawmill in Dolores, 2,322.75
tons of waferwood logs to the Louisiana-Pacific oriented
strand board mill in Olathe, and 145 tons of pine excelsior
logs to Western Excelsior in Mancos. This was a relationship
of 33.3 percent sawlogs to 66.7 percent products other than
logs (POL) by weight. It amounted to a removal of 29.6 tons
per acre. Any tree 8 inches d.b.h. or larger that would make
a sawlog was taken to the sawmill. Other trees were taken
for waferwood logs or pine excelsior logs. Table 1 lists unit
revenue, and cost to the logger as well as profit or loss data
per ton.
There was a total profit (total revenue minus actual costs)
for the unit of $440.48. Note that this is total profit before
taxes. No previous allowances for profit and risk or income
taxes were made during cost collection or analysis.
The effort to develop pine excelsior was experimental. It
was first believed that pine might be added as a supplement
to aspen excelsior for certain applications and was, there-
fore, worth trying as a potential local outlet for small, poor
quality logs. However, pine contains terpenes, a compound

that has a characteristic pine odor and, when it occurs in
sufficient concentrations, can be used to produce turpentine.
Terpenes can also attract certain insects, such as termites,
and in sufficient concentrations can interfere with the vi-
ability of seeds. Further, pine excelsior proved to be brittle
and difficult to ship. These characteristics reduced the
marketability of pine excelsior and, at this time, pine excel-
sior does not appear to be a viable product.
The effort to use ponderosa pine for waferwood was also
experimental to a degree. Usually, wood materials of lighter
density, such as aspen, are sought for waferwood used in the
production of oriented stand board (OSB). However, Louisi-
ana-Pacific at Olathe, CO, was willing to mix ponderosa pine
from this area with other species as a test. This provided an
excellent outlet for poor quality, small diameter material
that would have been impossible to market elsewhere. The
long haul distance of 160 miles to the plant contributed to
losses for this product.
Unit 5B—This unit is also known as one of the Found
Park units, and is located off Forest Road 521 on Ormiston
Point. It is 108 acres. A total of 9,177 trees were removed
from the unit during June 26 to November 11, 1996. Figure 1
shows the distribution of trees cut by diameter class. Ponde-
rosa pine sawlogs at the landing weighed 72.81 lb per cubic
foot with a standard deviation of 2.0 lb. The POL logs
weighed 76.56 lb per cubic foot at the landing with a stan-
dard deviation of 4.03 lb. The removal resulted in the
delivery of 1,397.44 tons of sawlogs to the Stonertop mill,
1,899.86 tons of waferwood logs to the Louisiana-Pacific
mill, 353.07 tons of wood for posts and poles to Cannon
Forest Products in Cortez, and 177.54 tons of pulpwood sold
at the landing and ultimately delivered to Stone Container
in Snowflake, AZ. This was a relationship of 36.5 percent
sawlogs to 63.5 percent POL by weight and a removal of 35.4
tons per acre. Table 1 summarizes the per ton financial
results by product for this unit. The total profit for the unit
was $6,875.60.
Shipment of pulpwood to Snowflake, AZ, was another
experimental attempt to evaluate potential markets. In this
case, a trucker from Cortez was hauling house logs from an
area near Snowflake to a location in Colorado. He needed a
back haul to Snowflake and this provided an opportunity to
explore this market. However, he estimated his costs re-
sulted in a loss to him of approximately $8.00 per ton for the
haul. Thus, this pulpwood market proved to be uneconomi-
cal to the trucker, although the revenue at the landing to the
logger was near the break-even point.
Post and pole logs were sorted at the landing and trucked
separately to Cannon Forest Products. It takes a reasonably
straight, defect free, and uniform tree to yield a satisfactory
post or pole. Forest restoration material, however, often
contains large volumes of deformed, poor quality, small
diameter material that does not fit post and pole specifica-
tions. Sorting out higher quality material can introduce
additional costs. Also, the quantity of post and pole logs
ultimately overwhelmed the small local mill capacity to buy
and process the material.
Unit 5E—The second of the Found Park units is bisected
by Forest Road 521 on Ormiston Point. It is 65 acres and
almost equally distributed on either side of the road. A total
of 5,307 trees were removed from this unit during May 29 to
June 27, 1997. Figure 1 shows the distribution of trees cut by
diameter class. In this unit, ponderosa pine logs at the
landing weighed 71.68 lb per cubic foot with a standard
deviation of 6.04 lb. This removal resulted in a delivery of
274.85 tons of sawlogs to Stonertop mill, 881.07 tons of

waferwood logs to Louisiana-Pacific, 269.64 tons of wood for
posts and poles to Cannon Forest Products, and 101.9 tons
of pulpwood to Stone Container in Snowflake, AZ. This is a
relationship of 18 percent sawlogs to 82 percent POL by
weight and was a removal of 23.5 tons per acre. Table 1
presents the per ton financial data for this unit.
The loss for the unit was $6,473.71. This loss does not
include any allowances for profit, risk, or income taxes.
Factors contributing to the loss were a high stumpage rate
for sawlogs coupled with the small amount of sawtimber
removed from the unit. The high stumpage price resulted
from cruise data that indicated there were more sawlogs in
the unit than actually existed. Thus, the logger paid for
material that did not, in fact, exist. This was a key reason for
using a weight basis for subsequent sales of this low value
material.
While pulpwood again appears to be profitable in this unit,
the trucker had delayed in calculating his costs only to
discover losses similar to those discussed in the narrative for
Unit 5B. It is likely that the large amount of small material
of poor quality created additional sorting and handling for
post and pole logs, thus increasing costs.
This unit illustrates the financial losses that occur when
there is a small percentage of sawlogs to POL material. It
simply costs more to harvest small diameter material and
when sawlogs are not present, overall costs increase. In
addition, the stumpage cost for sawlogs was too high and
that added to losses.
Unit 4—Also known as the West Trail unit, this unit is
located off Forest Road 524. We refer to it as the “snow unit”
because it was logged from November 11, 1996, to January
31, 1997, when the area was besieged with very cold weather
and deep snows.
The unit is 95 acres. A total of 6,824 trees were removed
from the unit. Figure1 shows the distribution of trees cut by
diameter class. Ponderosa pine logs in this unit weighed
72.43 lb per cubic foot with a standard deviation of 4.6 lb. The
removal resulted in the delivery of 1,152.51 tons of sawlogs
to Stonertop Mill and 2,008.57 tons of waferwood to Louisi-
ana-Pacific. This is a relationship of 36.5 percent sawlogs to
63.5 percent POL by weight. This was a removal of 33.27 tons
per acre. Table 1 presents per ton financial results for this
unit.
This resulted in a loss of $14,028.08. Factors contributing
to this loss were increased costs from logging in deep snow
and somewhat higher sawlog stumpage prices. The POL
stumpage price was also near that of unit 1 and higher than
units 5B and 5E. It is important to note that all of the other
characteristics of this unit indicate it would have been a
profitable unit, like unit 5B, if it had not been logged in deep
snow. While it is often desirable to encourage winter logging
of areas, this sale illustrates the importance of scheduling
forest restoration sales during periods when costs will not be
increased by weather conditions. It also underlines the need
to provide flexibility for contract extensions when such
conditions arise.
Joyce Unit—This unit is located in the Boggy Draw area,
which is a favorable site for tree growth. It is 99.6 acres. A
total of 3,101 trees were removed from this unit. Figure 1
shows the distribution of trees cut by diameter class. In this
unit, ponderosa pine sawlogs weighed an average of 78.82 lb
per cubic foot (the mean of two scaled loads). A total of
2,021.24 tons of sawlogs were delivered to the Stonertop mill
and 142.46 tons of waferwood logs to Louisiana-Pacific. This
is a relationship of 93.4 percent sawlogs to 6.6 percent POL
by weight. A total of 21.72 tons per acre were removed from
the unit. Table 1 presents the per ton financial data for this
unit.
The total profit for this unit was $16,719.38. This unit is,
from an economic standpoint, at the upper end of profitabil-
ity for a forest restoration sale. It is at the opposite end of the
spectrum from Unit 5E where the material removed was
predominately POL. The quantity of larger trees on the site
when the ecological prescription was applied resulted in the
removal of more sawlog material than in the other units. The
Joyce unit restoration would resemble a traditional timber
sale if it had removed the largest trees from the site.
However, the largest trees were left on the site in adequate
densities and trees in excess of the prescription were
removed.
Harvesting costs declined overall as a result of the re-
moval of a larger proportion of sawlogs in this unit. The
higher POL costs, which had been typical up to this point,
were offset by the lower harvesting costs of sawlogs. In
addition, the loggers had learned from our reports that POL
was resulting in serious losses. In this unit they did every-
thing possible to salvage material for sawlog use.
This unit illustrates that opportunities can arise to bal-
ance costly units (like 5E that have high proportions of POL),
against units like this one to achieve break-even or profit-
able forest restoration projects. This may require combining
scattered units at a variety of locations into one sale or
adopting landscape scale restoration in order to modify
costs.
Summary of Key Results _________
This forest restoration project incorporated five sale units
covering a total of 492.6 acres and the removal of 31,163
trees (63.3 trees per acre) for use as sawlogs (6,075.8 tons),
waferwood (7,254.71 tons), and other products such as posts
and poles, pulpwood, and pine excelsior (1,047.15 tons). The
loggers’ costs in this study, for each step in the harvesting
process except hauling, were less than USFS Regional aver-
ages and very comparable to cost studies from other areas.
Forest Service and independent observers rated the restora-
tion logging conducted by Ragland and Sons as excellent
work.

1 percent) on gross revenues of $434,645.54. This approxi-
mates a break-even situation that is better than suffering a
loss, but is hardly a model for a sustainable business ven-
ture. Usually, it is appropriate to expect profit and risk
allowances of 10 to 15 percent for logging in this region.
Sale characteristics with the strongest correlation to unit
profit were percent of sawtimber removed by unit (0.93356),
number of trees per acre 12 inches d.b.h. or larger (0.92516),
and cubic foot volume per tree (0.81464). Percent of POL was
negatively correlated with unit profit (–0.93536).
 Harvesting costs were also compared to unit profit. Indi-
vidual harvesting cost elements that were most negatively
correlated included felling, limbing, and bucking (–0.99989),
loading of POL (–0.91372), and hauling of POL (–0.83338).
Total POL costs were also negatively correlated (–0.88099).
The market conditions that existed at the time of this
study were ponderosa pine sawlogs selling at $240 per 1,000
board feet, waferwood logs selling for $31 to $32 per ton, and
post and pole logs selling for $24 per ton. Under those
conditions, the analyses conducted in this study suggest that
future restoration projects in this area of Colorado can be
near the financial break-even point when material removed
meets the following criteria:
1. Sawtimber should be at or above 40 percent of the total
weight removed and POL should be at or below 60
percent of the total weight of material removed. Note
the relationship of sawlogs to POL in figure 2 and then
relate that to profit and loss in table 2. Utilizing trees
in the 8 inch to 11.9 inch diameter class for the highest
value product possible is critical to profitability. Pay-
ments for material removed should be based on weight
scaling and not cruise data, given the variability of this
material.
2. Six or more sawtimber trees 12 inches d.b.h. or larger
should be available for removal per acre with an aver-
age cubic foot volume of 12 cubic feet per sawtimber
tree removed. Given that forest areas are being reduced
from 200 to 350 stems per acre down to half that
number or less, this should not be viewed as a difficult
problem in landscape scale projects. However, when
units do not meet these criteria, they should be com-
bined with other units to create break-even projects.
3. POL harvesting costs must be carefully managed. Note
the summary cost distribution for waferwood logs in
figure 3. Attention to cost control and record keeping is
important when dealing with low value, small diam-
eter material.
4. Felling, limbing, and bucking (FLB) costs must be kept
as low as possible. Note the proportion of FLB costs to
all POL costs in figure 3. In an analysis of the FLB cost
per cubic foot of wood removed, mechanical felling was
more expensive in all diameter classes in this study
than manual felling. This is due both to the type of
harvester used in this study and the scattered nature
of the trees being cut. Also it is clear that forest restor-
ation logging in adverse weather conditions should be
avoided.
5. Loading and hauling costs for POL must be reduced.
Note that the proportion of costs attributable to loading
and hauling in figure 3 were 50 percent of all costs. It
also suggests the need to strengthen and/or develop
local manufacturing businesses that could use small
diameter material and decrease hauling distances.
6. Stumpage prices for POL should be zero or less in some
cases. Note in table 1 that the loss per ton for POL is
often nearly equal to the stumpage paid for it. Also, as
a general rule, the revenue from the lowest quality
material, such as waferwood logs, must not be below
$31 per ton to break even.
Potential to Improve Profitability ___
Information developed from this study and other market
studies by the author was used to persuade the USFS to
revise its appraisal process for forest restoration projects
in Region 2. Stumpage prices for ponderosa pine POL in
Region 2 restoration projects may now be appraised at zero
or even a negative value, because the basis for the project is
ecological improvement of forest stands and POL material
typically costs more to harvest than it is worth. In other
words, this is recognition that POL is a liability, not a
valuable product. This change would, for example, reduce
the loss in Unit 5E from $6,473.71 to $1,204.28 and increase
the profit in Unit 5B from $6,875.60 to $9,476.36. Thus,
future restoration units with low value POL might actually
be financially feasible if new appraisal policies are used.
In addition, tremendous demand for OSB in housing and
commercial construction improved the market for waferwood
logs immediately following this study. During the study,
waferwood log prices paid at the mill were either $31 or $32
per ton. March 2000 waferwood log prices being paid ranged
between $35 and $37 per ton. An average price of $36 per ton
would have improved the profitability of this project to 7.3
percent. Similarly, a down turn in the OSB market or the
ponderosa pine lumber market could adversely affect resto-
ration projects. Thus, market fluctuations are important to
consider when restoration projects are being planned.
We gained some insight into ways to reduce harvesting
costs. Figure 3 shows the summarized cost distribution for
one product, waferwood logs. Note that hauling and loading
costs comprise a significant cost center as does felling,
Figure 3—Cost distribution for
waferwood harvesting.

limbing, and bucking. Hauling costs could be reduced using
more efficient trailers that better accommodate small diam-
eter material. Research should be directed at the potential
use of “hay rack” trailers or short log trucks with pup trailers
commonly used for hauling pulpwood. Felling and bucking
costs could probably be improved with mechanized equip-
ment designed for harvesting small material. However, this
requires further experimentation. If FLB could be mecha-
nized efficiently there might also be some improvement in
skidding costs. Logging should be planned to avoid adverse
weather that increases costs.
We also have learned to avoid some products, such as
pulpwood, that did not return sufficient revenue to cover
costs or excelsior logs that are not technically feasible.
Studies to improve utilization of wood wastes at the mills
and the development of new products are also important to
future profitability and sustainability of restoration projects.
Comparison of Forest Restoration
Costs to Forest Fire Costs ________
In the previous analysis, the principal focus was on the
identification of factors that could produce break-even or
profitable forest restoration projects. This focus resulted
from concerns that appropriated tax money would not be
available for service contracts to accomplish restoration
work.
However, there are important nonmarket benefits from
forest restoration that might merit investment of public
funds. One of these benefits is the reduction of catastrophic
forest fire hazard. To analyze the economic benefit of fire
hazard reduction, the costs or profit per acre from the five
units were calculated and are presented in table 2. These
costs were subsequently compared with local, State, and
national fire suppression costs per acre.
The nearest large-scale fire to the study area was the 1996
Disappointment Fire that occurred in the pinyon-juniper
forest type north of Dolores, CO. San Juan National Forest
records show that this fire burned 3,840 acres and cost
$992,000 to suppress. This is a per acre suppression cost of
$258.33. That cost is almost double the worst-case restora-
tion cost that occurred in Unit 4 (which had extraordinary
snow costs and high stumpage costs). It is almost three times
more expensive than Unit 5E, which had extensive amounts
of POL and the highest stumpage costs in our study. Recall
that the other restored units recorded profits. Also, all five
restored units still have forests with large trees, pleasing
esthetics, desirable wildlife habitat components, and eco-
logically functioning processes. The Disappointment Fire
area, on the other hand, lost tree cover, esthetics, and
wildlife habitat, while also requiring additional rehabili-
tation costs to reduce erosion and reestablish forest veg-
etation. Unfortunately the amount of those additional
rehabilitation costs were not recorded.
From 1991 to 1996, U.S. Forest Service wildfires in Colo-
rado cost an average of $482.78 per acre to suppress (USFS
1996). Property damage and rehabilitation costs for these
burned areas were not recorded. During the period 1977 to
1992, national large fire costs averaged $570.98 per acre
(USFS 1995). Again, property damage costs and rehabilita-
tion costs for these fires were not recorded.
Suppression, property damage, rehabilitation costs, and
subsequent flooding costs were studied for the 1996 Buffalo
Creek fire that occurred in ponderosa pine near Denver. All
costs after fire and flooding amounted to $679.47 per acre
and are expected to climb to $2,000 per acre because of
continuing flooding and water quality problems (Dennis
2000).
It can be argued that it may not be fair to compare fire
suppression costs with forest restoration costs because no
one can predict when and where a catastrophic fire will
occur. However, because research in ponderosa pine forests
suggests that fuel conditions for catastrophic fire are wide-
spread and that fire can be expected to occur at some time,
the comparison is not far fetched.
An estimate of expected fire suppression costs in restored
forests versus suppression costs under current forest condi-
tions was also developed as an example. Dr. Romme studied
fire frequencies in the Five Pine Canyon area west of Units
5B and 5E. He found that fire frequencies during the past 30
years in the Five Pine Canyon area were similar to fire
frequencies that occurred prior to Euro-American settle-
ment. The Doe Canyon Fire occurred recently in this vicin-
ity, just north and west of Units 5B and 5E, and serves as an
interesting cost comparison. It covered 600 acres and fire
observers noted that the fire was of low intensity and burned
like a prescribed fire. Some of the area had been previously
thinned, there are some open areas mixed with ponderosa
pine forest areas, the terrain is fairly level, and it is likely
that fire frequencies there have been similar to those iden-
tified by Dr. Romme in the adjacent Five Pine Canyon area.
Fire suppression, in this case, consisted mostly of burning
out from the roads. San Juan National Forest records show
that the cost to suppress this fire totaled $7,500 or $12.50 per
acre. Some small ponderosa pines were destroyed, but over-
all the forest remained intact. This better resembles the
lower intensity type of fire expected in restored forests and
may well suggest that the costs of future fire suppression in
such areas will be much lower.
Commentary ___________________
Given the results of this project, I think two questions are
pertinent to the future implementation of forest restoration
projects in the Southwest. These are:
• Who is going to do the work and why should they do it?
• Why should appropriated tax money be used to finance
forest restoration if well designed projects could pay for
themselves?
It is clear that an ecological prescription must control
project implementation to achieve the goals of forest restora-
tion. Forest restoration projects are not traditional timber
sales. Restoration of the forest to its inherent characteris-
tics and processes is, after all, the basic purpose for these
projects.
It is also just as clear that forest restoration is a risky,
financially expensive proposition. In Colorado all of the
forest industry businesses, except two, meet the qualifica-
tions for small businesses. Nearly all are family owned and
operated, similar to the Ragland and Sons Logging Com-
pany studied in this report. It is presumptuous, therefore,
to expect small businesses that characterize the forest

industry of Colorado and the Southwest to make a silk purse
out of a sow’s ear, or low quality, small diameter material
into a valuable product. Break-even projects or government
subsidized programs may accomplish ecological objectives
in the short term, but they will never result in the invest-
ments necessary to improve efficiencies, develop new prod-
ucts, and provide sustainable forest stewardship. Therefore,
it is important to approach these projects with long-term
financial sustainability in mind, providing loggers with
incentives to function as forest stewards, providing a variety
of restoration services such as watershed rehabilitation and
wildlife improvement projects. By paying attention to fac-
tors that influence profitability, such as the use of new
appraisal guidelines that recognize the low quality of this
material and alertness to market fluctuations, agencies can
improve the playing field for small businesses. A consistent
supply of wood from well-designed projects with long-term
contracts could encourage investments to improve efficien-
cies associated with harvesting and product manufacturing.
To further aid in this, government could provide incentives
in the form of tax advantages, low cost loans to create and
strengthen small businesses, and applied research to im-
prove harvesting efficiency and product development. For
example, forest product studies currently under way through
the Four Corners Initiative (Reader 1998) are intended to
support profitability by increasing local utilization of mate-
rial removed, improving manufacturing efficiencies, and
creating new value-added products.
The lessons learned from our experimental forest restora-
tion project are encouraging enough to recommend further
projects, I hope, at the landscape level. I also recognize that
other forest areas are so beset with worthless material that
subsidies will have to support restoration.
Finally, restoration projects cost much less than forest fire
suppression. Building a forest restoration infrastructure
makes more financial sense than spending tax money fight-
ing catastrophic forest fires.

Cost / Effectiveness Analysis of Ponderosa
Pine Ecosystem Restoration in Flagstaff
Arizona’s Wildland-Urban Interface

Abstract—Ponderosa pine ecosystem restoration in Fort Valley
(located east of Flagstaff, Arizona) has been proposed as a method
of restoring ecosystem health and lowering the risk of catastrophic
wildfire in Flagstaff’s wildland-urban interface. Three methods of
harvest are being used to carry out restoration treatments: hand
harvesting, cut-to-length harvesting, and whole-tree mechanized
harvesting. This paper presents a theoretical application of a cost /
effectiveness analysis to aid in recommendation of an optimum
method of harvest for restoration treatments. Harvest methods can
be compared on the basis of ratios of harvest cost / effectiveness.
Effectiveness in this approach is defined as a harvest method’s
ability to carry out restoration treatment with the least negative
impact on residual stand damage, soil impacts, and fuel loading.
Introduction ____________________
Cost / effectiveness analysis is an economic tool that can
help decisionmakers with limited financial resources select
among alternatives to meet a predetermined objective. In
the Fort Valley restoration project, the objective is an eco-
logical restoration / fuel reduction treatment intended to
reduce the number of small-diameter ponderosa pine (Pinus
ponderosa) trees in Flagstaff, Arizona’s wildland / urban
interface. These small diameter trees inhibit growth of
larger diameter trees and can act as fuel ladders in cata-
strophic stand replacing fires. Three treatment alternatives
have been used to reduce current tree densities: hand-
harvesting, cut-to-length harvesting, and whole-tree-mecha-
nized harvesting. Each of these harvesting alternatives uses
different mixes of equipment to obtain the given objective of
restoration. Each mix of equipment has different costs for
treating the stand and different environmental impacts on
the stand after treatment. This paper reviews economic tools
to aid in environmentally related decisions, and argues that
cost / effectiveness analysis is superior to benefit cost ratio
and impact analysis as an environmental decisionmaking
approach for harvest method selection in the restoration
projects. The paper introduces the Fort Valley restoration
treatments as a case study, and covers the theoretical
application of cost / effectiveness analysis for harvest method
selection in the Fort Valley restoration treatments.
Efficiency Analysis ______________
Cost effectiveness analysis is one of many techniques that
have been used to analyze the efficiency of environmental
improvement or, conversely, to analyze the efficiency in
avoiding the damage done by environmental degradation.
The three techniques we review in this paper (benefit / cost
ratios, impact analysis, and cost / effectiveness analysis) are
all types of a benefit / cost analysis. Benefit / cost analyses
are used to help policy and decisionmakers assess the desir-
ability of specific government projects for environmental
improvement, and to assess the desirability of new regula-
tions to protect certain aspects of the environment from
further degradation (Tietenberg 1996). The traditional eco-
nomic efficiency analysis techniques are difficult to apply to
environmental resources because of the lack of economic
valuation for these goods and services (Tietenberg 1996).
While demand curves for normal goods such as pizza or
automobiles can be estimated from readily available market
data, there are no such market data for environmental
resources, because they do not pass through normal market
transactions.
 Benefit / Cost Ratio Analysis
Benefit / cost ratios represent an approach to quantifying
the social profitability of a project. In isolated situations
where the end product of a project has a quantifiable market
value, a benefit / cost ratio analysis can help decisionmaking
by ranking alternate activities designed to complete the
project (Weaver and others 1982). Alternative activities are
ranked by relative efficiency, and the analysis is a formal-
ized attempt to obtain the maximum efficiency from a given
level of funding. The benefit / cost method evaluates each
alternative on a comparison of an earning rate index based
on dollar benefits and per project costs. When used to select
a set of alternatives under a budget constraint (in other
words, capital budgeting problem), benefit / cost ratios
ensure that the alternatives maximize benefits from a given
level of funding. Benefit / cost ratios can also guide decisions
between mutually exclusive alternatives. In this case, the
benefit / cost ratios are compared and the alternative with
the highest ratio is selected. To provide valid comparison of

150
USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-22. 2001
Pinjuv, Daugherty, and Fox
Cost / Effectiveness Analysis of Ponderosa Pine Ecosystem Restoration in Flagstaff Arizona’s Wildland-Urban Interface
alternatives, benefit / cost ratio analysis requires that all
benefits and costs of a project are quantified in monetary
terms and included in the ratio.
Therefore, the major difficulty in using benefit / cost ratio
analysis for comparing environmental projects is that not all
benefits and costs are easily quantified in monetary terms.
Even if market prices exist for inputs and outputs, these
market prices do not always reflect the full social value of
goods produced, or costs of resources used (Clifton and Fyffe
1977). Even greater difficulties arise when the resources in
question do not have market values or are not handled
by normal markets. For example, what is the dollar value
of forest soil compaction caused by various harvesting
alternatives?
The direct financial costs of carrying out a project are
generally the most straightforward part of the analysis to
quantify. These costs can be measured in terms of equip-
ment, fuel, salaries, and so forth Indirect costs and intan-
gible benefits estimation often pose many difficult problems.
Indirect costs and intangible benefits are inputs and outputs
not covered by normal markets, such as soil compaction,
habitat loss, forest health, and aesthetics. In environmental
projects, the majority of cost and benefits often are indirect
or intangible. Aside from the sheer number of inputs and
outputs that require nonmarket valuation, attempts to value
each benefit can encounter problems concerning differing
individual values of natural resources (Stevens and Sherwood
1982). Additional difficulties arise when the analysis is
applied in the context of benefits and costs associated with
avoided damages, for example, pollution control (Tietenberg
1996).
Many of the benefits associated with restoration treat-
ments are avoided damages. For example, some of the
benefits derived from forest restoration in Fort Valley are
the avoided cost of fire suppression and avoided damages
from wildfire. In theory, the benefits gained from various
levels of restoration could be quantified in terms of damages
avoided. Some of the avoided damage could be quantified
since market goods such as fire suppression or property
values are affected. This type of approach could be used in
Fort Valley, but the valuation of such goods is a project
within itself, and no such valuation has been completed. The
Fort Valley treatments also affect many nonmarket benefits
such as wildlife habitat and recreational opportunity that
are not easily valued for use in benefit / cost ratios.
Impact Analysis
Impact analysis is an approach to quantifying the social,
economic, and environmental consequences of various ac-
tions. Impact analysis is often used as a preliminary tool in
developing environmental assessments. Unlike benefit /
cost and cost effectiveness analysis, impact analysis makes
no attempt to convert impacts into a one-dimensional mea-
sure to ensure comparability (Tietenberg 1996). Impact
analysis also does not attempt to find an optimum of an
economically efficient set of alternatives for accomplishing
objectives. Rather it attempts to describe all impacts, quan-
titatively and qualitatively, as a way of evaluating proposed
actions.
In the context of the Fort Valley restoration project, USDA
Forest Service personnel completed an environmental impact
analysis to evaluate the impacts of different treatments (in
other words, silvicultural restoration prescriptions) on the
landscape and surrounding community (USDA 1998). The
focus of the analysis was to compare effects of different
thinning intensities (in other words, different residual den-
sities of trees per hectare) proposed in the restoration treat-
ments. The analysis did not attempt to quantify all costs and
benefits in terms of monetary units, and made no compari-
son of different harvesting procedures and equipment mixes
to be used to carry out the treatments. While the impact
analysis provides necessary information to determine if the
overall project was worth undertaking, it did not provide
information that would facilitate the selection of the optimal
harvesting alternative.
Cost / Effectiveness Analysis
Cost / effectiveness analysis is a technique designed to
assist a decisionmaker in identifying a preferred choice
among possible alternatives. The analysis involves a com-
parison of alternative courses of action in terms of costs and
effectiveness in attaining some specified objective (Quade
1967). Cost estimation is identical to direct cost estimation
used in a benefit / cost ratio analysis. Direct costs are
measured in terms of equipment costs, fuel costs, and sala-
ries. Cost / effectiveness analysis avoids some of the diffi-
culty in quantifying economic benefits of various alterna-
tives by replacing dollar measurements of benefits and
indirect costs with the concept of “effectiveness,” where
effectiveness is a comparative measure of an alternative’s
ability to meet project objectives.
In its simplest form, a cost effectiveness analysis is equiva-
lent to a minimized cost approach. If all alternatives are
equally effective in accomplishing project objectives the cost
effectiveness ratio becomes (cost / 1). In this case the lowest
cost alternative is optimal. Alternatively, in the case that
different alternatives (for example, different harvesting
techniques) have different impacts on the site, then effec-
tiveness measures are selected to calculate these impacts.
A cost effectiveness analysis requires the analyst and
decisionmaker to choose (1) a specific set of objectives, (2) a
complete listing of the alternative solutions to be considered,
and (3) acceptable measures of effectiveness in meeting the
objectives. The first two decisions are common to all project
analysis techniques. The third decision, selection of effec-
tiveness measures, is unique to cost effectiveness analysis
and makes this analysis subjective because of analyst as-
sumptions. The analyst and decisionmakers must select
attributes, which quantify the ability of an alternative to
meet project objectives. In environmental decisions, these
attributes are most often measures of damages avoided. To
be useful the expected value (or effectiveness score) of
attributes must vary across alternatives.
The virtue of the cost / effectiveness analysis lies in a more
systematic and transparent use of judgment than any of its
alternatives (Quade 1967). While effectiveness analysis
may appear subjective in terms of analyst judgment of
effectiveness measures, the analysis is presented so the

Pinjuv, Daugherty, and Fox
decisionmakers can follow the analytic assumptions. Decision-
makers can choose which assumptions they agree with and
arrive at their own conclusions. Other efficiency analysis
techniques often mask assumptions in the assignment of
dollar values to nonmarket benefits.
The selection of effectiveness measures also poses limita-
tions that must be considered when using cost / effectiveness
results. Results of an analysis (in other words, alternative
rankings in terms of cost and environmental damage) must
be interpreted by qualified and informed decisionmakers.
Decisionmakers must understand the assumptions made by
the analyst to arrive at the results, such as selecting at-
tributes of effectiveness and assigning importance weights
to attributes. The measurement of effectiveness is limited by
selected attributes, and these attributes are often con-
strained by the cost of measurement and other factors that
the analyst may not be able to take into account (Livingston
and Gunn 1974). Thus, the results of effectiveness analysis
are not intended to provide understanding and prediction,
as are the results of science. Rather, the results are intended
to serve primarily as recommendations or suggestions for
selecting among courses of action (Quade 1967).
A cost / effectiveness analysis is most appropriate when
used to choose a preferred alternative among possible alter-
natives that have the same project objectives. This analysis
can rank possible alternatives that have a nonmarket na-
ture to their benefits and costs, a situation that fits many
restoration activities. The following description of the Fort
Valley restoration project sets a base for a theoretical appli-
cation of a cost / effectiveness analysis, which can be used as
an aid in recommendation of an optimum harvest method.
Application of Cost / Effectiveness
Analysis to Fort Valley Restoration
Treatments _____________________
The Fort Valley restoration project is a series of ecological
restoration / fuel reduction treatments, guided by pre-Euro-
American settlement conditions (prior to 1870). The restora-
tion treatments cover approximately 1,376 ha (3,400 acres),
and incorporate various mixes of equipment to complete
harvests. The goals and objectives of this ecological restora-
tion and fuel reduction project as stated in the Fort Valley
Environmental Assessment (USDA 1998) are to create a
mosaic of open, parklike forests that approximate conditions
present before Euro-American settlement. The project will
also reduce the hazard of catastrophic crown fires.
Three harvesting methods were used to meet the objec-
tives of the Fort Valley restoration project: (1) hand
harvesting, (2) cut-to-length harvesting, and (3) whole-
tree-mechanized harvesting. The hand harvesting treat-
ment method consisted of a classical sawyer operation. Trees
of 12.7 cm (5 inches) diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) and
greater were cut, limbed, and bucked into 4.9 m (16 ft) log
lengths by hand. Processed logs were transported to waiting
trucks at the log landing using a tractor with a log grapple.
The merchantable activity was simultaneously accompa-
nied by the cutting, scattering, and lopping of the very small,
nonmerchantable trees.
The cut-to-length mechanized harvesting method con-
sisted of a single grip harvester, a forwarder, and hand
sawyers to cut and lop all nonmerchantable trees. A tractor
with a log grapple forwarded all logs cut and processed by
the harvester. The logs coming from trees 12.7 cm (5 inches)
and greater in diameter were forwarded to waiting trucks at
the log landing.
The whole-tree-mechanized harvesting method consisted
of one feller-buncher, whole-tree skidders, a delimber, and a
loader to process merchantable trees 12.7 cm (5 inches) and
greater. Whole trees were cut and piled using a tree-to-tree
feller-buncher. Whole trees were skidded to the landing
using a rubber tired grapple skidder. Trees were processed
into logs at the landing using a delimber and loaded onto
waiting trucks. Hand cutting, scattering, and lopping of the
less than 12.7 cm (5 inches) diameter trees followed the
merchantable activity (Larson and Mirth 1999).
The effectiveness of these harvesting alternatives de-
pends on the degree to which the stated goals have been
obtained. All three of these harvesting techniques per-
formed the same ecological restoration treatments, leaving
the same residual stand density, species composition, and
age class distribution. The different alternatives also achieved
similar reductions in risk of catastrophic crown fire, which
was primarily dependent on the treatment prescription
rather than the harvesting method. The benefit side of the
project objectives does not vary significantly between the
harvesting alternatives, and therefore are not useful in
selecting the optimum-harvesting alternative. In addition,
many of the benefits from restoration currently do not have
quantified market value, or established nonmarket value.
The absence of economic quantification of returns from
restoration precludes the use of benefit / cost analysis (Weaver
and others 1982).
These three harvesting alternatives are expected to have
had different impacts on the residual forest condition. The
key differences between the alternatives are how the trees
were felled and processed, piled, and transported to the log
landing. These differences will have caused variation in
residual stand damage, amount and distribution of logging
slash, and degree of soil impacts. While these impacts
(indirect costs) are also not easily quantified in terms of
dollar values, they are amenable to effectiveness analysis.
Because the alternatives are similar in primary goal
accomplishment, the primary benefits are nonmarket in
nature, and the alternatives differ in direct and indirect
costs, and cost / effectiveness analysis is the most appropri-
ate technique for selecting the optimum alternative. The
direct cost of each method can be quantified in terms of
dollars. In the absence of differences in indirect costs, the
cost effectiveness ratio would reduce to cost, and the mini-
mum cost alternative would be preferred. If indirect costs of
residual stand damage, fuel loading, and soil impacts were
easily quantifiable in dollar value, then any of the efficiency
measures (for example, benefit cost ratios) could be used.
Cost / effectiveness analysis avoids the problem of the
nonmarket nature of these indirect costs by using them as
effectiveness measures. Cost / effectiveness analysis can
evaluate the alternatives in terms of their direct cost and
relative effectiveness in avoiding these adverse impacts.
The primary criteria for attributes to quantify these impacts

are data availability, and the attribute’s correlation to the
impact costs.
The following is a short description of each of three
proposed effectiveness attributes for residual stand damage,
soil compaction, and fuel loading and a possible method for
measuring each. Residual stand damage may be quantifi-
able as percent of residual trees undamaged, with damage
defined as visible wounds, broken tops, and broken branches.
Stand damage is important because bole damage (for ex-
ample, cat faces caused by equipment) is a primary point of
entry for diseases such as decay fungi to enter the tree
(Storer and others 1997). Broken tops and branches can also
leave the tree in a state of low vigor, increasing the possibil-
ity of insect and disease mortality. This attribute can easily
be measured by inventory plot procedures using a fixed
radius plot or strip cruises.
Soil impacts measure damage to soil structure. This at-
tribute was selected because compacted and disturbed soils
from machines and humans can impede surface water entry
into the lower layers of the soil (Seixas and McDonald 1997).
Disturbed soil can also provide a growing habitat for inva-
sive exotic weeds that can out-compete native vegetation,
reducing habitat for native wildlife and insect populations.
Compaction can be measured with an infiltrometer, and be
converted to percent change in compaction. Disturbance can
be visually estimated as a percentage of disturbed soil, using
a plot or strip inventory procedure.
Fuel loading measures the downed woody material left on
the forest floor after treatment. In a study on biomass and
nutrient removal, Giles (1979) found that removing whole
trees, as opposed to stems only, could increase biomass
removal by 28 percent in coniferous forests. Increased re-
moval of biomass and nutrients may cause a decline in soil
nutrients and forest productivity. Branches cut from trees in
the limbing process contain many of the tree’s resource of
nutrients. Removing this material from the harvest site and
accumulating large amounts at landings can cause effective
nutrient mining of the site, can be a breeding center for decay
fungi and insects that can spread into the residual stand,
and can be a fire hazard. Fuel loading can be measured along
transects, giving a measure of average diameter of fuels
deposited throughout the site (Brown 1974).
The attribute scores should be measured so that cost /
effectiveness ratios for each treatment are the highest when
they have the highest cost, and hence least effective. This
convention requires that each attribute be measured so
those alternatives that cause greater impacts have lower
effectiveness scores. Attribute scores may be weighted to
reflect relative importance by multiplying the percentage
amount of each attribute by an importance weight (Macmillan
and others 1998).
The overall effectiveness of a harvest alternative can be
quantified by summing attribute scores (percent measure-
ments of each of the above attributes) for each treatment.
Along with these effectiveness measurements, each harvest-
ing method must be quantified in terms of the financial cost
required to implement each harvesting treatment. Direct
costs for the Fort Valley restoration project were estimated
by the use of a cost analysis completed by Larson and Mirth
(1999). This analysis estimated direct logging costs using
the method of implementation costs, modeling equipment
sets, and operational procedures for hand, whole-tree, and
mechanized harvesting methods. Table 1 presents the direct
cost of the harvesting alternatives. The whole tree harvest-
ing method was the least cost approach in all forest condi-
tions calculated. Cut-to-length was the second lowest cost in
all conditions, and it equaled the whole-tree cost in the
yellow pine stand condition. The hand-harvesting method
had the highest cost in all conditions. Unless the effective-
ness of the methods varies, a rational decisionmaker would
select the whole-tree method as the optimal alternative.
The cost / effectiveness ratio of each harvesting alterna-
tive can be computed by dividing the alternative’s direct cost
by its restoration effectiveness score. Table 2 presents a
hypothetical example calculation of cost effectiveness ratios
for the black jack stand condition, using only residual stand
damage as the attribute of effectiveness. In the example, we
assume that the percent of stand damaged is higher for the
lower cost methods (30, 20, and 5 percent for whole-tree, cut-
to-length, and hand harvesting, respectively). If these
values match actual stand damage, then the optimal deci-
sion would switch to hand harvesting because it has the
lowest cost / effectiveness ratio. In the example, stand
damage values reverse the optimal ranking from the least
cost approach.
The sensitivity of a decision to effectiveness score depends
on the ratio of direct cost of the alternatives. Alternatives
with similar direct costs (ratio near one) are more sensitive
to effectiveness measures. Table 3 demonstrates this sensi-
tivity of cost / effectiveness ratios to direct cost differences.
In the black jack stand condition, whole-tree direct costs are
73 percent of hand harvesting cost. For the decision of
optimum harvest method to switch from whole-tree to hand
harvesting, whole-tree effectiveness would have to be less
than 73 percent of the effectiveness of hand harvesting. In
the yellow pine condition direct cost differences are similar,
and whole tree effectiveness must be at least 90 percent of
hand harvesting effectiveness in order to remain the optimal
choice.

Cost / Effectiveness Analysis of Ponderosa Pine Ecosystem Restoration in Flagstaff Arizona’s Wildland-Urban Interface
Pinjuv, Daugherty, and Fox
Conclusions____________________
This paper demonstrates cost effectiveness analysis as a
useful tool for optimum harvest recommendation for ecologi-
cal restoration treatments such as those in Fort Valley.
Harvest methods may be compared on the basis of ratios of
harvest cost / effectiveness. Effectiveness measures can be
defined as a harvest method’s ability to carry out restoration
treatment with the least negative impacts in terms of re-
sidual stand damage, soil impacts, and fuel loading. Cost /
effectiveness analysis avoids the valuation difficulties with
the nonmarket nature of indirect costs by using them as
effectiveness measures. Thus, it avoids problems associated
with benefits estimation encountered with traditional ben-
efit / cost approaches.
Important issues must be addressed in the use of a cost /
effectiveness analysis, such as the proper selection of effec-
tiveness measures and the weights given to these measures.
Weights given to effectiveness measures must appropriately
reflect not only their importance with respect to other
measures, but also their ability to effect optimum harvest
choices.
Possibilities for future use of this approach may incorpo-
rate a more objective presentation of results. Analyst as-
sumptions in effectiveness weighting could be partially
eliminated from this analysis by presenting cost / effective-
ness ratios in a table showing effectiveness weights calcu-
lated a variety of ways. For example, if the weighting of each
effectiveness attribute is removed (all attributes are as-
sumed to be equally important) the cost / effectiveness ratio
for each harvesting treatment may change. Attributes could
be weighted or not weighted in order of importance, effec-
tiveness could be calculated in each instance, and ratios
could also be reported in a table. The table format would give
more interpretive decisionmaking power to the reader and
make the entire analysis less subjective. Aside from objec-
tive presentation techniques, further investigation into the
Table 3—Sensitivity of cost / effectiveness ratios to direct cost
differences, or percent effectiveness required to change
decision from minimum cost approach. Percent effectiveness
is the level of effectiveness that the lower cost alternative
must achieve relative to higher cost alternative in order to
remain the optimal decision.

Abstract—The Grand Canyon Forest Partnership (GCFP), lo-
cated in Flagstaff, AZ, has implemented a 16-inch diameter breast
height cutting cap in the Fort Valley Restoration (Phase One)
Project to secure the support of environmental organizations for
urban interface forest restoration and fuels reduction projects.
This paper provides insights into the economic impacts of this
limitation by applying a simulated cap to realistic inventory,
logging, and revenue models developed from an earlier represen-
tative project—the GCFP’s 332-acre Fort Valley Research and
Demonstration (R&D) project. The simulation was possible on
only four of the nine R&D units, as these were the only units that
had trees greater than or equal to 16-inch d.b.h. available for
cutting. The simulated cutting cap resulted in implementation
cost increases of 5 to 19.4 percent, harvested fiber decreases of 10
to 39 percent on a volume basis, and reductions in operator net
returns ranging from 22.3 to 176 percent. The primary market for
harvested material, at the time of this analysis, was low-value
firewood and pallet stock that was supplemented by occasional
sales to high-value users of large diameter logs. The 16-inch cap
limited the operators’ ability to broker logs to these large diameter
users (for example, small volume viga manufacturers located in
the Phoenix, AZ, metropolitan area) who would pay upward of
$200 per ccf. Projections showed, however, that under more favor-
able market conditions, such as that of a regional pulp mill or
oriented strand board plant, the operators (and consequently the
GCFP) could better sustain, economically, the 16-inch cutting cap.
Introduction ____________________
The Grand Canyon Forests Partnership (GCFP), in
Flagstaff, AZ, is a collaborative effort between the Coconino
National Forest, Grand Canyon Forests Foundation, North-
ern Arizona University, and a number of other governmen-
tal and nongovernmental organizations. The GCFP seeks to
reduce the risk of catastrophic fire and restore forest eco-
system health through practices that are ecologically

sound, economically viable, and socially acceptable. Its
implementation strategy includes thinning of forest stands,
introducing low-intensity fire, restoring meadows, and
thoughtful minimization of trails and roads.
The GCFP finished its first treatment project, known as
the Fort Valley Research and Demonstration (R&D) Project,
during 1999. This 332-acre project is an adaptive manage-
ment experiment for researching presettlement reference
conditions, contemporary pretreatment conditions, and the
impact of four thinning alternatives on three forest stand
types. Thinning was limited to trees less than 22 inches in
diameter measured at breast height (d.b.h.). This project
serves as a demonstration site, providing on-the-ground
evidence and information so that the public can effectively
contribute, in a learned manner, to the process of treating
the urban-wildland forest interface in the greater Flagstaff
region.
The GCFP has been planning and working toward its next
treatment activity, the 1,700-acre Fort Valley Restoration
(Phase One) Project. This project is an interesting one in that
the GCFP implemented a cutting cap to limit thinning to
only those trees smaller than 16 inches d.b.h. By implement-
ing this cap, the GCFP responded to the concerns and forest
management desires of regional environmental organiza-
tions (SWFA 1996, 1998; Suckling 2000) and demonstrated
that GCFP’s intent is on forest fuels reduction and restora-
tion, and not commercial logging.
GCFP’s ability to treat forest stands over the 100,000-acre
urban wildland interface, however, is highly dependent
upon economics. Implementation is expensive, and this
project must eventually become financially sustainable;
independent, to some degree, of Federal dollars. The GCFP
realizes that the same material that is thinned from the
forests as part of the restorative stand treatment can be
recycled as a marketable resource. Wood fiber, in a favorable
market environment, has the potential to fund and sus-
tain forest treatment programs. A cutting limitation like
the 16-inch cap, however, can have negative financial
repercussions.
This paper provides insights into these economic impacts
by simulating the effects of a cap on stand conditions,
thinning models, and fiber markets that are representative
of the conditions of the greater Flagstaff urban-wildland.
The process and results of this simulation included:
• Collecting and characterizing representative stand pa-
rameters, which are summarized below in the section
titled “Fort Valley Research and Demonstration Project.”

• Amassing realistic thinning information and building
representative mathematical models; tasks that are
summarized in the section titled “The Cost to Treat.”
• Quantifying fiber markets representative of real re-
gional conditions and incorporating this information
into the models. The results of these activities are
presented in the section titled “Revenue Expectations.”
Fort Valley Research and
Demonstration Project ___________
The R&D project is north of Flagstaff near Highway 180
and Snow Bowl Road at an elevation of 7,400 to 7,600 ft
above sea level. This project consists of three areas that are
representative of different stand configurations—a yellow
pine area with more than five yellow pine trees per acre, a
mixed yellow pine and blackjack area with less than two
yellow pine trees per acre, and a blackjack area. (Yellow
pines are ponderosa pine trees characterized by yellow bark
and are larger in size and older than 150 years. Blackjacks
are younger and smaller ponderosa pine trees with black
bark.) The two yellow pine areas lie within the Fort Valley
Experimental Forest, while the blackjack area lies in the
Coconino National Forest along the eastern boundary of the
experimental forest. Figure 1 is a map of this project.
Each treatment area is subdivided into four units that
range from 32 to 41 acres. The four units are differentiated
by the type of the proposed treatment, designated as: 1.5-3,
2-4, 3-6, and control. Although these prescriptions provide
for different levels of thinning, they are anchored to the
presettlement condition as their template. Common to each
treatment is that all living presettlement trees, standing
snags, and trees greater than 22 inches d.b.h. are retained
(Flagstaff Urban/Wildland Interface Treatment Guide-
lines, 1998). In addition, all treatments called for the re-
moval of all trees 4 inches d.b.h. and smaller. The reader can
find additional information about these types of treatments
and their effects in the articles by W. Covington and others
(1997, 1998).
The Treatments
The 1.5-3 treatment is known as a full restoration pre-
scription. For every direct evidence of a dead presettlement
tree (stumps, snags, downed trees, and stump holes), 1.5
replacement trees are left whenever large (>16 inches d.b.h.)
and vigorous replacement trees are available within a 30 ft
radius of the evidence. If the only available good quality
replacement trees are smaller than 16 inches, then three
trees are marked for retention. When the available trees
within the 30 ft search radius are not acceptable due to
Figure 1—Map of the Fort Valley Research and Demonstration Project.

quality or mistletoe infection, the search radius is extended
to 60 ft.
The 2-4 treatment is known as an intermediate level of
thinning where more trees per presettlement evidence are
retained. In practice, two large or four small dominant and/
or vigorous trees are left for every evidence.
The 3-6 treatment is a minimal thinning plan that results
in an even greater density of replacement trees where three
large or six small trees are left per evidence.
The control units are untreated and will be used for
comparative purposes.
Existing Stand Character
An inventory of the marked Fort Valley Research and
Demonstration Units was started on September 14, 1998,
and completed on November 11, 1998. This work formed the
starting point for the analysis of the 16-inch cutting cap
economic impacts by providing a reliable projection on the
total amount of wood thinned in 1-inch size classes. Only a
summary of the inventory is provided here. Details and
comprehensive analysis can be found in the report by Larson
and Mirth (1999).
The tree stand condition prior to thinning is given in
table 1. The sampling technique to determine this condi-
tion consisted of counting trees and measuring tree diam-
eters over 33–1/100 acre samples per unit. This provided an
80 percent probability that the estimate of the average
total number of trees per acre per unit will fall within the
limits shown on the table.
The blackjack units, located outside the Fort Valley Ex-
perimental Forest, had been previously harvested for large
trees and had been thinned from below (Fulé and others
1999). Consequently, the inventory reflects a small percent-
age (ranging from 8.3 percent to 23 percent of the total stem
count) of existing trees in the 4-inch and under classes.
(The trees within each d.b.h class have a possible breast
height diameter that range from 0 to 0.9 inches. In example,
a 5-inch d.b.h. class could include 5-inch trees as well as
5.9 inches and any tree in between.) The majority of
existing stems are found in the 5 to 15-inch classes; ranging
from 70 to 92 percent of the total unit tree counts. The
number of existing 16-inch and larger trees is small; ac-
counting for only 3.7 percent of the overall tree population of
all three units.
The blackjack/yellow pine units are denser than the black-
jack units due to large numbers of less than 5-inch trees,
reflecting a lack of precommercial thinning in the Experi-
mental Forest. The less than 5-inch trees represent 59 to 75
percent of the total number of standing trees. These black-
jack/yellow pine units have a smaller percentage (16.6 to
31.2 percent) of 5-inch to 15-inch trees, even though the
absolute numbers are similar to that found in the blackjack
units. The blackjack/yellow pine units contain greater num-
bers of larger (16 inches and greater) trees, averaging 28.0
trees per acre (tpa).
In terms of the numbers of very small and very large trees,
the yellow pine units were similar in character to the
blackjack/yellow pine units. The population of existing trees
that was less than 5 inches accounted for 49 percent of the
trees in unit 10 to 73 percent in unit 12. The number of 16
inches and greater trees averaged 23.1 tpa.
Treatment Effects
Tables 2, 3, and 4 summarize the effects of thinning as
part of the GCFP restoration plan. The projected cutting
rate is given on a total number of trees per acre basis and on
a fiber volume basis of 100 cubic foot per acre (ccf/a).
Currently, the less than 5-inch trees cannot be economically

used as a marketable resource and, although they are part
of the tpa cut projections, they are not represented in the
merchantable fiber volumes. This very small material was
cut, scattered on the ground throughout the units, and
lopped to less than 2 ft in height.
The potential fiber harvested from these units is calcu-
lated on a diameter class basis that permits analysis of the
16-inch cutting limitation. As shown in tables 2 through 4,
had the cutting limitation been imposed on this R&D project,
it would have impacted the fiber returns from only four
(units 2, 4, 6, and 7) of the nine cutting units. On a 100 cubic
foot per acre (ccf/a) basis, the available 16 to 21.9-inch trees
represented—respectively over units 2, 4, 6, and 7—26.8,
10.0, 19.0, and 39.4 percent of the total merchantable fiber
potential.
The Cost to Treat ________________
Thinning Models
Two thinning strategies that closely replicated the pro-
cesses and equipment setups of two of the actual three
operators that performed the thinning of the Fort Valley
R&D project were modeled for this 16-inch cap analysis.
These models included:
1. Whole tree mechanized harvesting (WT):
(a) This scenario uses a mechanized system consisting
of a tracked feller-buncher, whole-tree skidders, a
delimber, and loader to process the merchantable
5-inch and greater trees.
(b) The submerchantable trees less than 5 inches d.b.h.
were hand felled, scattered, and lopped. (In this
context, lopping refers to the cutting of downed
trees and limbs that project higher than 2 ft above
the ground level.) We presumed that this precom-
mercial activity was subcontracted out to a local
sawyer operator.
2. Hand felling of all trees (HD):
(a) This scenario considers the hand cutting, limbing,
and bucking of the 5-inch and greater trees that are
then forwarded to the landing using an articulated
rubber-tired skidder with a log grapple.
(b) The merchantable activity is simultaneously accom-
panied by the cutting, scattering, and lopping of the
very small, nonmerchantable trees. This model as-
sumes that a subcontractor completes all cutting
and related processing, regardless of tree size.
The HD operation modeled here is fundamentally differ-
ent than the WT one. For comparative purposes, the HD
operation was modeled as a direct cost only operation;
neglecting overhead, profit, ancillary logging-related ex-
penses, equipment depreciation, and so forth. This is in
contrast with the WT model that incorporated all ideal
business expenses including 10 percent for profit and 11
percent for administrative overhead. Model details are
found in the paper by Larson and others (2000), or the
unpublished report by Larson and Mirth (1999).
Like the actual contracted R&D work, the different opera-
tional models were applied to the different stand types.

Stand data from units 2 and 4 (the blackjack units) were
used as input to the WT model. Units 6 and 7 data (the
blackjack/yellow pine units) were coupled to the HD model.
Because our focus is to gain insight into the 16-inch cutting
cap effects, the work presented here is limited to only those
four units (1, 4, 6, and 7) with available trees in the 16 to <
22-inch d.b.h. classes.
Results ________________________
Through the application of stand data to the appropriate
thinning models, operational cost projections are made and
summarized in tables 5 and 6. Two scenarios are presented,
allowing ready analysis of the impacts of the 16-inch cutting
cap relative to implementation costs. Scenario 1 considers
the cost implications of cutting all unmarked trees in the
merchantable d.b.h. size classes from 5 inches to less than
22 inches. The contrasting scenario 2 considers that only
trees less than 16 inches are cut.

Larson and Mirth
Projected Economic Impacts of a 16-Inch Tree Cutting Cap for Ponderosa Pine Forests Within the Greater Flagstaff Urban-Wildlands
The tabulated cost summaries are presented in three
ways:
• $/unit—the total cost to truck all merchantable fiber to
processing mills. Different mill distances were used for
the different operators, because each operator histori-
cally served different fiber users. A haul distance of 118
miles was used for the WT operator. This mileage
represents a weighted travel average, moving wood to a
once active pulp mill and to a saw log buyer. (Neither of
these purchasers exists today. The sawmill closed in
December of 1998. The paper mill converted to a 100
percent recycled product, eliminating the need for pulp-
wood.) Similarly, the HD weighted average haul dis-
tance varied between 60 to 100 miles, depending upon
the distribution of log sizes. The main purchaser of the
HD fiber was a firewood and pallet stock manufacturer
located 60 miles away, but occasionally, the HD opera-
tor would haul larger logs to a viga producer 140 miles
away.
• $/acre—an expression of the total costs including truck-
ing on a per acre basis.
• $/ccf—an expression of the total costs including truck-
ing on a per 100 cubic foot of extracted merchantable
fiber.
An examination of $/unit or $/acre data from tables 5 and
6 erroneously suggests that the imposition of a 16-inch cap
reduces cutting costs. A better context, however, for assess-
ing the cap impact is the cost per extracted fiber basis. It is
a number that can be directly compared to its revenue
potential that thereby offsets implementation costs. For
example, in unit 2, 26.8 percent of the projected extracted
fiber (on a ccf basis) comes from trees 16 inches and larger.
Upon imposition of the cutting cap, implementation costs
are shown to increase by $15.49/ccf (or 19.4 percent). Simi-
larly, unit 4 realizes an implementation cost gain of 5.0
percent associated with a 10 percent loss of potential har-
vested fiber. Unit 6 sees a 7.3 percent increase in cost due to
a 19 percent reduction in available fiber. Unit 7 realizes a 10
percent cost increase due to a 39 percent fiber reduction.
These results are consistent with the known relationship
that “logging costs per cubic foot are higher for smaller
removal volumes per acre” (Hartsough and others 1998).
The net revenue loss, however, will be larger than that
suggested by implementation cost increases as the larger
than 16-inch trees command a better selling price than the
smaller diameter trees. This revenue impact due to the 16-
inch cap is discussed further in “Revenue Expectations.”
Revenue Expectations ___________
GCFP’s ability to treat the urban-wildland forests is
highly dependent upon the local operators’ ability to profit-
ably market the harvested trees. A true picture of the
implementation economics and the impact of the 16-inch cap
is not complete without a revenue analysis that is grounded
in either historical or current market conditions.
Prior to December 1998, the WT operator sold his small
diameter logs as pulpwood (smaller diameter logs that are
suitable for use in making pulp—the main component in
paper production) and the larger logs as saw logs for cutting
into boards and lumber. As of winter 1999 when this
revenue analysis was completed, the WT operator did not
have a regular buyer of harvested wood fiber. Except for a
few truckloads of larger diameter logs sold as viga (high-
quality poles peeled from large diameter logs that are used
in Southwestern roof and ceiling architectural systems)
stock or saw logs, most of the logs from units 1, 2, and 4 were
eventually sold in late spring 1999 at a discount to Northern
Arizona Wood Products for firewood, posts, or poles.
The HD operator historically sold wood to a broad range of
markets. During winter 1999, however, the harvested logs
were sold into the firewood, pallet stock, and viga markets.
For this revenue analysis on the impact of the 16-inch
cutting cap, two market conditions were projected—a favor-
able one of pulpwood and saw logs, and a subsistence one of
firewood and pallet stock that is bolstered by a low volume
regional viga market. This analysis, however, neglects the
cost of operator down time that does occur due to oversupply
in these limited volume markets. A summary of the total net
return projections that includes revenue from the sale of
fiber, stumpage fees, thinning, and precommercial costs is
provided in tables 7, 8, 9, and 10 for the WT and HD
operators. These tables provide both a generalized sense of
the impact and also a detail analysis on a per unit basis. The
general impact trends are summarized here:
• There is a decrease in stumpage fees paid out by the
operator as there is less wood fiber harvested.
• Harvesting costs change, decreasing if presented on a
per area basis, but increasing if on a per merchantable
volume basis.
• The revenue opportunity does not change as a function
of cutting restrictions within the small diameter prod-
uct categories, but decreases significantly in the larger
diameter products. As a consequence, the net returns to
the operator(s) are likewise severely impacted.
• The large diameter products subsidize the lower value
small diameter products. This bolstering is particularly
important to the operators selling fiber within a subsis-
tence market where the main opportunity for small
diameter logs is a very low value product.
Table 7 summarizes the financial impacts of the 16-inch
cap for the WT operator under a market condition that is
considered favorable (albeit currently nonexistent for opera-
tors in the Flagstaff area) as the small diameter wood is sold
at a relatively high price as pulpwood. The projected impact
of a cutting cap to the operator is net return reductions of
96.8 percent over unit 2 and 22.3 percent over unit 4. Recall
that the WT thinning model included profit, overhead, and
other reasonable business expenses. Because of this, and
because net returns were always positive, the modeled WT
operator could tolerate the 16-inch cap in a market that pays
a reasonable price for small diameter wood.
This is not the case, however, for the WT operator in a
marginal market of firewood, pallet stock, and vigas as
shown in table 8. The projected impact of a cutting cap is
quantified in terms of net return reductions of 176.2 per-
cent over unit 2 and 58.8 percent over unit 4. Table 8
suggests that the modeled WT operator could not afford the
16-inch cap in a low-value small-diameter market with a
negative net return that completely cancels any profit
opportunities.

Tables 9 and 10 show a similar impact trend for the direct
cost HD model as that seen for the full cost WT model. In a
favorable market, the cutting cap reduces projected returns
by 86.1 percent over unit 6 and 57.2 percent over unit 7. In
the subsistence market, the reductions are, respectively,
162.5 percent and 83.8 percent over units 6 and 7. These
reductions, however, are particularly severe in the subsis-
tence market for this direct cost model excludes overhead,
profit, depreciation, insurance, opportunity loss, mobiliza-
tion, and roadwork. The cutting cap moves the operator from
an adequate financial situation to a losing one where he
cannot finance the indirect operational costs.

The quality of the fiber market is an important variable on
the overall impact of a cutting cap. A favorable regional
market that can pay a reasonable price for small diameter
logs—distinguished by higher value products such as pulp
for paper products, oriented strand board, or medium or high
density fiber board—is one that might support a cutting cap.
A subsistence market—distinguished by low value products
such as firewood, pallets, or arts and crafts—cannot with
current thinning technologies and administrative proce-
dures support the cap. A comparison of “with cap mill
revenues” between tables 7 and 8 and between tables 8 and
9 readily demonstrates this market quality factor. The
subsistence market yields gross revenues that are 73.4 to
83.2 percent of what the favorable market is projected to
provide. This is roughly comparable to the difference in
small diameter fiber price between the low-value use versus
the higher value use.
Conclusions____________________
The results presented in this paper were developed by
simulating a cutting cap over various models built from a
representative forest restoration project, the Fort Valley
R&D Project, that involved the thinning of trees that were
less than 22 inches d.b.h. This simulation work suggests the
following:
• The cost to conduct a forest thinning program to reduce
the risk of catastrophic fire and restore forest ecosystem
health is substantial.
• Establishing a cap that prohibits the cutting of 16
inches d.b.h. and greater has a negative effect on the
economics of a forest thinning project.
• The number of 16- to 21.9-inch trees available for
cutting in the original Fort Valley R&D Project repre-
sents only a small percentage of the standing large
trees. However, these trees represent a disproportion-
ately large percent of the total volume to be cut with
profound effects on project economics.
• The economic effect of the 16-inch cap is related to the
health of the regional wood fiber market. A healthy
market with several users that pay fair prices can
support a forest restoration program even with a cap. A
weak, limited market for wood fiber probably cannot
support the operators, if a cap is imposed.
• This study suggests that a healthy market is one that
can pay, on a weighted average, between $70/ccf to $95/
ccf within a 100 mile haul radius.

Abstract—Thousands of acres of densely stocked ponderosa pine
forests surround Flagstaff, AZ. These stands are at high risk of fire,
insect, and disease outbreak. Stand density management activity
can be expensive, but product recovery from the thinned material
could help defray removal costs. This project evaluated the yield and
economic return of lumber recovered from small-diameter, sup-
pressed ponderosa pine. A sample of 150 trees ranging from 6 to 16
inches in diameter at breast height was selected. Half of the sample
was sawn into dimension lumber and the other half into appearance
grade lumber. This study yielded about 25 percent No. 2 and Better
Common for appearance lumber with the majority of lumber (66
percent) graded No. 3 Common. About 50 percent of the dimension
lumber was No. 2 and Better, with very little of the highest grade,
Select Structural, produced. Volume recovery was slightly higher
for dimension lumber, yet the lumber from the logs sawn for
appearance grade was worth significantly more than that from the
logs sawn for dimension lumber.
Introduction ____________________
In 1998 it was estimated that 40 million acres of National
Forest were at high risk of fire, disease, and insect outbreak
because of increased stand density (Dombeck 1998). This
acreage does not include forest land under other ownership.
Some researchers believe that past forest management
practices, such as fire suppression and livestock grazing,
have altered forest conditions in ways that may increase
these hazards (Sackett and others 1996). This is of special
concern at the urban-wildland interface because of the risk
of property damage and threats to public safety. A represen-
tative case study in northern Arizona (Mast and others
1999) found a rise in forest density from 60 trees/ha in 1876
to 3,000 trees/ha in 1992. This case study prescribed a forest
restoration plan to return the forests to presettlement con-
ditions. The plan involves thinning the dense understory of

stands to allocate more resources to overstory trees and
thereby restore stand vigor and health. Costs for this type of
management activity are high, and information regarding
revenue from use of the extracted resource is minimal.
Historically, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. Ex
Laws.) was a commercially important species in the South-
western United States. Past research (Ernst and Pong 1985;
Fahey and others 1986; Fahey and Sachet 1993) to evaluate
product recovery from this resource generally is not specific
to suppressed stands and is limited to a few grading options
not suitable for evaluating use in engineered structural
products such as metal plate wood trusses, I-joists, and
glulam beams. Erickson and others (2000) recently com-
pleted a grade yield study on small-diameter trees sampled
from northern and central Idaho that provides some infor-
mation on structural framing and machine stress rated
(MSR) lumber yields for ponderosa pine sawn into 2 by 4s.
The ponderosa pine trees sampled for this study were remov-
als from densely stocked stands that were about 45 years old
and thinned from below. The trees removed were smaller, 9-
inches diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) or less, that were
not dominant or codominant in the forest canopy. The
lumber produced from these trees had poor yields in the
higher visual grades and would not be suitable for produc-
tion of MSR lumber. It should be noted, however, that grade
yields from these thinnings might not be typical of small-
diameter ponderosa pine that were dominant or codominant
trees in a stand. Previous studies also have documented that
drying degrade is a major cause of grade reduction with
younger trees (Arganbright and others 1978; Blake and
Voorhies 1980; Mackay and Rumball 1972; Markstrom and
others 1984). Even though these past studies have shown
that lumber cut from young-growth, small-diameter, ponde-
rosa pine trees is prone to warp during drying, the extent of
the problem in lumber from suppressed stands is not en-
tirely clear.
To begin evaluating products from this resource, some
basic information on lumber recovery, grade yield, and
mechanical properties is needed. The Ecologically Sustain-
able Production of Forest Resources (ESP) team at the
Pacific Northwest Research Station has been conducting
product recovery studies for over 40 years. Since the early
1990s, the focus of the team’s work in this area has been to
quantify the types of wood products that might result from
treatments designed to alter structural conditions and de-
velopment trajectories in densely stocked, small diameter
stands. The objective of these studies was to determine the
value of these wood products and to incorporate this infor-
mation into planning tools used to design treatments for
these management activities (Fight 1997). Although many
people tend to think of small trees as being young growth,

162

Lumber Recovery From Small-Diameter Ponderosa Pine From Flagstaff, Arizona
it became evident that many trees from densely stocked
stands were older (usually at least 60 years old), slow
growing, and had small branches or knot indicators. Small
diameter is defined differently depending on land manage-
ment objectives. The d.b.h. range of trees (Douglas-fir, Pseudo-
tsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco; western larch, Larix occi-
dentalis Nutt.; and lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta Dougl. Ex.
Loud.) from a previous study in northern Idaho was 6 to 14
inches. Results from this work (Lowell and others 2000;
Willits and others 1997) showed that the quality (volume
and grade yield) of this resource was similar to that found in
larger diameter trees. Economic gains could be realized by
using the lumber as a raw material for a variety of end uses,
including engineered and value-added products.
This study was part of a larger project designed to evalu-
ate product potential of the ponderosa pine resource and to
determine if certain kiln drying techniques reduce drying
defect. The objective of the portion of the study reported
here was to determine the yield of structural and
nonstructural lumber grades from small-diameter (in this
case 6 to 16 inches d.b.h.), suppressed ponderosa pine and
to compare the volume and value recovery of dimension
versus appearance grade lumber from this resource.
Procedures ____________________
Tree Selection
Trees were selected from the Fort Valley demonstration
project, Flagstaff, AZ. The demonstration project was set up
in three experimental blocks with four treatment plots each.
The experimental blocks represented different initial stand
conditions; black jack (young-growth) pine, yellow pine (old
growth) and a mixture of the two age groups. The treatments
within the blocks were different thinning prescriptions de-
signed to return stands to presettlement conditions. This
involved thinning from below where the larger, older trees
are retained. Trees to be left had been marked but no
treatments had been applied prior to sample selection for
this study. Sample trees came from three of the four treat-
ment plots in the mixed age block.
A sample of trees ranging from 6 to16 inches d.b.h. was
selected by using a matrix consisting of six 2-inch diameter
classes. Trees selected were those that would have been
removed under the silvicultural prescription. The sample
was randomly divided into two subsamples, one to be sawn
for dimension lumber and the other for appearance grade
lumber.
Logging
A crew from the ESP team was present during tree falling
to record measurements from both the standing tree and
bucked logs. Woods-length logs had a preferred length of
36 and 40 feet. Measurements included d.b.h., total height,
age at stump height, length and diameter of all woods-length
logs, length of breaks, and unutilized tops. Woods-length
logs were tagged with a number that identified the tree and
position in the tree from which it came. Logs were hauled to
the cooperating mill for both long-log and short-log scaling.
Log Measurements
After all woods-length logs were delivered to the mill, they
were rolled out and scaled as presented. Logs were scaled by
a Forest Service check scaler according to rules in the
National Forest log scaling handbook (U.S. Department of
Agriculture 1985) and by the Forest Service cubic scaling
rules (U.S. Department of Agriculture 1991). Scaling deduc-
tions were itemized to show cause, location, and amount of
each defect. Logs also were graded by using an appropriate
log grading rule. The official scales for the study were cubic
and Scribner. After scaling, woods-length logs were bucked
into sawmill lengths (short logs) and scaled again, recording
bucked lengths and diameters (to the nearest 0.1 inch). An
ESP team member participated in scaling to ensure that all
necessary data were collected.
Log Processing
As the study logs were brought into the mill they were
assigned a consecutive sawing number that was matched to
the original tree number and log within that tree. One-half
the sample was sawn into 2-inch dimension lumber (nomi-
nal sizes 2 by 4 and 2 by 6) with some 1-inch jacket boards
sawn from the outer portion of the logs. The other half of the
sample was sawn for 1-inch boards. Green lumber measure-
ments were taken to enable calculation of the rough-green
cubic volume of lumber, sawdust, and chips. Scientists from
the Forest Products Laboratory (FPL) also measured warp
on the green lumber.
Board Data
After kiln drying, the lumber was surfaced to standard
dressed dry dimensions. Each board grade, length, and
width was tallied after the grading station. A Western Wood
Products Association inspector graded the dimension lum-
ber under the structural light framing grades; Select Struc-
tural, No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, and Economy (Western Wood
Products Association 1998) and the type of grade-limiting
defect was recorded. The appearance boards were graded
under the board grades; #1 Common, #2 Common, #3 Com-
mon, #4 Common and factory lumber grades; Moulding, #3
Clear, 1 Shop, and 2 Shop (Western Wood Products Associa-
tion 1998).
The 2 by 4 lumber was shipped to the University of Idaho
for inclusion in an ongoing cooperative study between the
FPL and the University of Idaho on mechanically grading
lumber from small-diameter trees of Inland West species
(Green and others1997). An associate inspector of the West-
ern Wood Products Association graded this subsample of
lumber using the light framing (Construction, Standard,
Utility), structural light framing (Select Structural, No.1,
No.2, No.3), lamstock, and machine stress rated systems.
Final grade assignment for the lamstock and MSR grades
required determination of physical and mechanical proper-
ties. Results from this portion of the study will be reported
separately.
The FPL determined the warp characteristics of lumber
kiln dried in a conventional way and then determined the
effect of presteaming and top loading, separately and in

separately.
Analysis _______________________
Regression analysis was used to determine volume and
value recovery of ponderosa pine by log small-end diameter.
The best fitting model was selected on the basis of coefficient
of determination (R2) and standard deviation about the
regression (syx). Models were developed by using a transfor-
mation of log small-end diameter as the independent vari-
able. The dependent variable for volume was either percent-
age of cubic recovery or cubic volume of lumber per gross
cubic log volume expressed as a percentage. Dollars per 100
cubic feet of log scale ($/CCF) was the variable used for
lumber value because it is a preferred measure of tree value.
It is calculated by dividing the total value of lumber pro-
duced by the cubic scale (gross or net) of the log multiplied by
100. The results are dependent on the pricing structure in
place at the time. Dollars per 100 cubic feet can be highly
correlated with log diameter because log quality tends to
increase with log size.
Analysis of covariance was used to determine if significant
differences existed in volume and value recovery between
logs sawn for appearance and dimension lumber.
Results and Discussion __________
Tree and log data for each sample are given in table 1.
The average age of the trees was 90 years old (range of 50
years to 120 years). Both samples of trees had very little
scaled defect, less than 1.5 percent of the total cubic log
volume.
Volume Recovery
The percentage of cubic volume recovered as lumber was
similar for logs sawn for dimension and appearance grade
products (fig. 1). Table 2 contains the analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA) statistics and table 3 presents the models and
statistics for the volume recovery curves. The logs sawn for
dimension lumber had a slightly higher volume recovery.
This can be partially explained by the fact that fewer pieces
of lumber were produced from each log. Fewer saw cuts
were made so there was less loss to saw kerf, fewer boards
means less overall loss to shrinkage during kiln drying, and
there would be correspondingly less loss in planer shav-
ings. About 10 percent of the volume of lumber produced
from the dimension logs were 1-inch boards sawn from the
outside portion of the log (table 4). The mean cubic recovery

from logs sawn for dimension products was 42.7 percent
while logs sawn for appearance lumber recovered 40.4
percent.
Value Recovery
As illustrated in figure 2 (tables 3 and 5 show the models
and ANCOVA, respectively), value of lumber differed sig-
nificantly between the two product types, with appearance
lumber worth more than the dimension lumber in the log
diameter range sampled. The mean value of the appearance
grade lumber was $268 per 100 cubic feet (gross log scale),
while the dimension lumber was only $215 per 100 cubic
feet. Prices used were from the Western Wood Products
Association (1999) report summary through November 1999.
No manufacturing costs are included in these values; so the
real difference between the products thus would be less
because manufacturing and handling costs for appearance
lumber are greater owing to the larger number of pieces
being produced.
Value recovery depends on both the volume and the
lumber grade recovered from a log. Lumber grade recovery
is important, with higher grades of lumber commanding
higher prices. This study yielded about 25 percent No. 2 and
Better Common for appearance lumber with the majority of
lumber (66 percent) graded No. 3 Common (table 6). About
50 percent of the dimension lumber was No. 2 and Better
(table 4), with very little of that in the highest grade.

Lumber grades are dependent on a variety of board char-
acteristics. Appearance grades (Factory lumber and Boards)
are based on characteristics such as stain, pitch pockets,
unsound wood, slope of grain, knot size, and wane. Struc-
tural lumber is graded on characteristics that affect its
strength. Knot type and placement becomes a factor under
grading systems for structural lumber. The amount of
juvenile wood can also affect the mechanical properties of
lumber graded for structural applications. Dimension lum-
ber that can be graded for structural applications (either
visually or mechanically) commands a higher price. The
research conducted by Erikson and others (2000) indicated

Lumber Recovery From Small-Diameter Ponderosa Pine From Flagstaff, Arizona
Lowell and Green
that the lumber manufactured from their ponderosa pine
sample yielded a very small proportion of lumber suitable for
structural applications. The lumber sawn for this study
indicated that just by producing a different primary product
(appearance lumber), a gain in value was realized.
Previous work (Lowell and others 2000) shows that there
are opportunities to increase the value of appearance lumber
through further processing into cut-stock material. The
study found boards graded No. 3 Common had the largest
increase in value when comparing value as a single piece of
lumber versus value as cut-stock material. Board width also
influenced yield and value of clear cuttings with 6-inch wide
boards being higher in value as cut-stock than lumber. The
resource from Flagstaff, AZ, used in this study had a high
yield of appearance lumber graded #3 Common and about 60
percent of the boards were 6 inches or greater in width.
While the Flagstaff study did not involve evaluation of cut-
stock production, there may be an opportunity to recover
more value from this material with further processing into
secondary products.
Conclusion_____________________
Old-growth ponderosa pine traditionally has been used in
appearance applications. The results of this study indicated
that lumber from small-diameter ponderosa pine growing in
densely stocked stands in the Flagstaff, AZ, area has char-
acteristics that make it more valuable as appearance grade
lumber than dimension lumber. Results from this study
indicated that the wood characteristics of small-diameter
ponderosa pine growing in densely stocked stands have
sufficient value to warrant its processing for primary prod-
ucts and also may have the potential for secondary process-
ing as a resource for the moulding and millwork industries.
This information can be used with new technology and
emerging processes to direct this resource to an appropriate
end use, where as much value as possible may be captured
from the resource to offset restoration costs.

versions of the traditional Navajo hogan as a development project for Indig-
enous Community Enterprises.
Abstract—A report and critical commentary is presented on the
use of small diameter roundwood in building construction in the
United States and England. Examples are discussed of roundwood
joinery being evaluated at the USDA Forest Service’s Forest Prod-
ucts Laboratory, and joinery developed by the British engineering
consulting firm Buro Happold, working over 15 years in the devel-
opment of roundwood use in Europe. Three buildings constructed at
Hooke Park in Dorset, England, using small diameter roundwood
thinnings as the structural members are profiled, demonstrating
the range of applications from small domestic scale to a very large
enclosed workshop space. These precedents will inform the con-
struction of traditional Navajo hogan shaped buildings in northern
Arizona in the development of local roundwood industries.
Introduction ____________________
Roundwood is the original forest product for building
construction from the most ancient of human times to today.
Whether heavy logs or thin scantlings, the natural form of
timbers and saplings has been the traditional geometry of
construction. But since the industrialization of forestry and
lumbering, especially in the milling of lumber, a prismatic
mentality has dominated thinking and practice. Flat sur-
faces are easiest to join to flat surfaces. But with milled
material there is both material and structural loss in trim-
ming a round log into a rectangular cross section.
This exploration paper is part of a comprehensive pro-
gram to develop a use for the forest thinnings of the northern
Arizona ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest. The project
involves the design of a modernized traditional Navajo
home, a single room octagonal “hogan,” using precut and
fitted roundwood parts. Perhaps small industries could be
developed locally that would also meet a strong housing need
not currently addressed.
Obviously a house is more than a roof. Roundwood and
thin logs are undoubtedly best suited to structural frames,
trusses, and skeletons. But these need continuous panels or

infill if used for shelter. When used as solid walling, or as
panel materials, roundwood seems less appropriate. Thus
the challenge is to find the most obvious economic uses of
these small timbers in small buildings.
Forest Products Laboratory,
Madison, Wisconsin _____________
Within the U.S.A., the Forest Products Laboratory at
Madison, WI, run by the Department of Agriculture Forest
Service, is a national center for research in timber applica-
tions to building construction. Experimental, testing, and
computational activities are conducted both at the labora-
tory and by contracted researchers. A personal visit there
February 3–5, 2000, allowed intensive discussion with Ron
Wolfe, the investigator, about the current technical status of
roundwood applications, as well as a review of recent experi-
ments in joinery and fastening. Because wood is strong in
tension, but weak in shear, considerable attention has been
focused on methods to allow the joint to transfer the poten-
tial full strength of the member.
The most thorough recent experiment has been with a
“dowel-nut connection” at the end of a piece of roundwood
that was conducted by Ron Wolfe. A cylindrical 44.5-mm
(1.75-inch) diameter dowel is fitted across the member or
strut. A distance of some 7 diameters from the end is
recommended. This dowel is tapped and becomes the nut for
a threaded rod that extends from the center of the round-
wood to connect to a hub, or other transfer point or joint. A
tight steel strap or sleeve around the roundwood holds the
fibers together to control splitting. Although the experi-
ments were made on 127 mm (5 inch) diameter Douglas-fir
(Pseudotsuga menziesii) peeler cores, by adjusting struc-
tural data the technique could be applied to other wood
types, other diameters, and to debarked but untrimmed
roundwood, according to the researcher.
A building project of special interest is the design and
construction of a full sized circular pavilion of roundwood
7.5 m (25 feet) in diameter, a dimension similar to a hogan,
a traditional Navajo dwelling. A 12.5 mm (1⁄2-inch) steel
cable around the perimeter makes a tension ring for the
truss ends. The roundwood pieces 150 to 200 mm (6 to 8
inches) in diameter are joined by “timber rivets,” a steel nail
with a wedged head used with a flitch plate. While appar-
ently over designed, the pavilion is both a confidence builder
and the subject of full sized monitoring. In addition, at the
Forest Products Laboratory a number of other building
products are at various stages of development and commer-
cialization that have special interest to those interested in
innovative forest products. Trade names such as “fast wall,”
“tectum,” “bison pressed board,” and “compreg” are among
the many of these upcoming materials.

Hooke Park, Dorset, England ______
The Parnham Trust, Beaminster, Dorset, UK, was founded
in 1977 as a nonprofit educational charity by John Makepeace,
perhaps the best known furniture designer and maker in
Britain. It has been primarily concerned with the teaching
and development of the design, production, and business
skills needed for the establishment of new enterprises using
timber as a primary material. Both forestry and furniture-
making skills are taught in apprentice-like settings. Thus
Hooke Park was founded as a demonstration forestry tract
and test site of 132 ha (330 acres) of Dorset woodland, which
contains at its center, a workshop/training facility in the use
of roundwood, as well as student residences—a miniature
college in the woods.
The educational facilities at Hooke Park consist of a series
of custom designed experimental buildings that explore uses
of roundwood, a sustainable crop, together with test forests
that provide the outdoor classroom. Roundwood has been
recognized as a viable construction material worldwide and
throughout history. However, it is the use of immature
thinnings of little commercial value that is innovative at
Hooke, and of most interest elsewhere.
Leading British architects have been involved in the
design of each building at Hooke Park. However, the com-
mon technical consultant for all structures has been Buro
Happold, Bath, with Ted Happold personally involved with
carefully engineered high-tech ideas of joinery. Since his
death, the home office staff from Bath have continued
technical support of structural and services engineering for
this program. All buildings demonstrate ideas of what can be
achieved with round poles, particularly the first two where
details use epoxy plugs, wrappings, and adhesives.
The Prototype House
Richard Burton, of Arends Burton, Koralik, (ABK) Archi-
tects, of London designed this single story domestic building
(figs. 1 and 2) in 1983, which was completed in 1986. The
internationally known partnership of ABK founded in 1961
has been the source of major architectural designs for four
decades. The house is used as a seminar room and for

administrative offices. It has a size of 11.2 by 8.5-m (37.3 by
28.7 feet) and the material used was Norway spruce (Picea
abies). A series of A-frames support a doubly curved roof
structure using 5.5 m (18.3 feet) long, 60 to 90 mm (2.4 by
3.6 inch) diameter hanging rafter poles with an initial sag
of 20 mm (0.8 inch). Thus the roof load is carried in tension
and taken out of the poles by epoxy threaded 12 mm steel
rods, connected to tension eyes.
The decision to use the thinnings structurally in tension led
to the resin joint. To use roundwood only 50 mm (2 inches) in
diameter, a very efficient joint was required (fig. 3). This is
achieved by drilling a conical hole in the end of the timber and
Figure 3—Prototype house, Hooke Park, UK: round-
wood design joint.

Explorations of Roundwood Technology in Buildings
filling it with epoxy resin. The conical hole exposes all the
fibers, which are oriented longitudinally, and maximizes the
efficiency of the joint. A threaded steel rod is bedded in the
resin to enable a connection to be made. In the case of this
house, roof timbers hang from the ridge cable. An additional
benefit is to avoid metal-to-wood contact, a common area of
building material failure. Similarly, the same joint is used in
the compression joints as the resin plug helps to bind the
center fibers of the roundwood and prevent them splitting
apart under pressure.
With the initial sag set at 200 mm (8 inches), the design
sag for maximum load is 300 mm (12 inches), which gives a
tension force of 7.2 kN. This tension is transferred into the
building structure at the ridgeline through a tension joint
attached to a wire cable hung between the heads of four A-
frames. The tension at the eaves is transferred into a cable
spanning between inclined side posts, resisted in turn by a
roundwood header beam joining the tops of these posts as a
“burnished compression spar.” The symmetry of the cross
section avoids structural eccentricity.
The outside walls lean outward to help resolve structural,
thermal, and rainwater problems, and to provide solar
control. An overhanging eave was considered but rejected on
the grounds that it is undesirable to have rafters projecting
outside the insulated skin and be subjected to different
temperature and moisture conditions. This solution also
avoided having to cut the vapor barrier around rafters and
also avoided wind penetration.
The Wood Workshop Building
The training Wood Workshop (figs. 4 and 5) was also
designed by Richard Burton of ABK, and was completed in
1990. It is a 15 m (50 foot) span vault roof using wet
Norwegian spruce (Picea abies) two bent poles 10.5 m (35
feet) long tapering from 180 mm to 70 mm (less than 8 inches
to less than 3 inches) in diameter. A crown section of two
poles was used to connect the bent poles through lapping
bolted joints. At the base, the poles were fixed to concrete
walls using grouted-in-place bolts and plates.
The final building has three shells spanning 15 m (50 feet)
wide, forming a total structure 42.5 m (142 feet) long and
7 m (23 feet) high. The shells are formed using thinnings of

nominal diameter 155 mm (6 inches) at the base to 65 mm
(21⁄2 inches), approximately 9 m (30 feet) long, joined at the
crown by a laminate crown arch member. Access for visitors
is by a bridge that enters the building at mezzanine level
between the workshop and teaching areas. Two of the shells
form the workshop area. The third contains the library,
seminar rooms, teaching area, and offices, all arranged both
at ground floor and mezzanine levels.
The most labor-intensive part of the work involved fitting
the plywood edging strips for the membrane and fitting the
windows and doors to the complex shapes of the frame on the
end walls. This work required several skilled carpenters and
took several weeks.
Westminster Lodge
The Westminster Lodge (fig. 6) by architect Edward
Cullinan was opened in April 1996. It provides student
accommodation with four pairs of private rooms around a
central common space. The floor is raised above sloping
Figure 6—Westminster Lodge, Hooke Park, UK: construction section.
ground and the load-bearing walls are made from clad
roundwood. The main feature of the Lodge is the two-way
spanning Vierendeel truss roof (fig. 7), which required eight
3 m (10 foot) long poles to be spliced together to form the top
chord. The poles were approximately 100 mm (4 inches) in
diameter and were used in four layers to span the 8.4 m (28
feet) in two principal directions. Blocking pieces provided
shear connections between the top and bottom layers adding
stiffness in the central part of the span.
Named after the Duke of Westminster, who provided
substantial funding, the most interesting roundwood ele-
ment again is the roof. The two-way spanning roof has a
large number of alternative load paths to allow for problems
with isolated timbers. Using this strategy the variable
properties of the roundwood can be exploited without the
need to downgrade the stresses to the level that the statis-
tical variation in strength might imply.
The solution was to develop a joint, which could easily be
made in the forest, with simple, readily available tools. This
joint was a combination of a scarf joint and finger joint. The
Figure 7—Westminster Lodge, Hooke Park, UK: structural assembly.

Explorations of Roundwood Technology in Buildings
normal scarf joint is weak and unreliable; the normal finger
joint is difficult to make in the forest. By cutting a plywood
tongue or key into the roundwood scarf joint diagonally, a
simply made, strong, and reliable field joint was achieved by
increasing the surfaces of the epoxy glued end joint as shown
in figure 8.
By using this joint any length of 100-mm (4 inch) diameter
could be produced. Long lengths were used top and bottom
with two intermediate layers to span across the 8.4-m (28 ft)
roof space. Blocking pieces were used to generate a shear
connection between the top and bottom layers, creating the
two-way spanning Vierendeel trusses. The continuity of one
layer over the side span gives added stiffness to the central
span. It also enables a single layer of timbers to span one way
across the 3 m (10 ft) between the walls of the side rooms.
Instead of steel bolts, 25 mm (1 inch) oak dowels connect the
top and bottom chords through a spruce shear block 400 mm
(16 inch) long and 80 mm (3 inch) thick that serves as a
spacer.
A secondary connector of some interest is the wrapped
straps of stainless steel, a standard product, here used to
hold two roundwood perlins together as they pass at right
angles.
Construction Summary of All Three
Buildings
On all three buildings, the roofing materials allow for the
variability in form and surface natural to roundwood. On the
first two buildings, a flexible membrane surface on a soft
insulated blanket was used that fits to the profile shape of
the roundwood as well as the double curved surfaces. On the
Lodge, boarding was used to support the heavier “green” roof
surface of living grass turf, which has already been replaced
once. Since the sod is not very thick, it apparently cannot
survive even in the damp English climate.
Floors were more difficult to detail. They needed to be
covered with level boarding or surfacing and this cannot be
achieved with tapered elements. A possible future develop-
ment would be to use in situ concrete on roundwood with
shear connectors. Thus the roundwood would act as perma-
nent formwork and as tension reinforcement, with concrete
providing the compression element and the finished floor
surface.

Evaluations ____________________
The UK visit to the University of Surrey (of an interna-
tional European technical team) concentrated on a tour of
Hooke Park in Dorset, where John Makepeace of the Parnham
Trust had set up a school for woodland industry. All the
buildings and structures for the school, situated deep in
woodland, featured round-pole technology. The buildings are
an interesting combination of forestry thinnings with very
high-tech ideas carefully engineered by Buro Happold in
Bath. They demonstrated ideas of what can be achieved with
round-poles particularly when reliance can be placed on
epoxy gluing. However, they were seen by the project team to
be one-off developmental structures, with only limited rel-
evance to the low-cost higher volume uses required for the
round-pole project… (Ranta-Maunus).
This reviewer has similar observations. Although struc-
turally successful, all buildings demonstrated intensive
investments of human ingenuity and labor, as well as expen-
sive fasteners in complex high technology joining systems.
The similarity of the Happold epoxy resin plug to the Ameri-
can “dowel-nut connection” demonstrates two parallel
technical solutions to the same engineering problem. Unfor-
tunately neither seems appropriate to the design of the
hogan roof structure. None of the buildings demonstrated
use of roundwood for cladding or panel systems. Thus they
all have limited lessons for the design of small span, small
scale climatically adapted Navajo hogans for northern
Arizona. But they are experiments that do not have to be
replicated in northern Arizona. Of all those roundwood
building ideas that have been built, it is the wrapped straps,
and the multi-layer trussed roof at Westminster Lodge that
appear to be the most transferable.

Use of Wood as an Alternative Fuel to Coal
and Natural Gas at the Holnam Cement
Plant, North of LaPorte, Colorado
Kurt H. Mackes
Abstract—The Holnam Company currently operates a cement
plant north of Laporte, CO. The plant is attempting to use wood as
an alternate fuel to coal and natural gas. The principal objective of
this project is to investigate the extended use of wood as an alternate
fuel at the plant. Tests conducted at Holnam indicate that wood is
suitable for use at the plant and Holnam could use up to 350 tons of
clean wood wastes and residues per day. A substantial network of
wood suppliers, drawing wood from landfills, wood processors, and
forests, will be necessary to meet overall plant requirements.
Successfully converting Holnam to wood would provide economic
benefits to both Holnam and the community. Larimer County would
benefit because the majority of clean wood will be diverted from the
waste stream into its landfill. Using forest residues at Holnam could
help reduce the risk of wildfire, increase public safety, and improve
forest health. We view converting this plant to wood as only a
beginning. If Holnam successfully converts to wood as the primary
fuel source, then other plants in the region could similarly use wood
wastes and residues as fuel.
Introduction ____________________
The Holnam Company operates a cement plant north of
Laporte, CO. Founded in 1926, the plant currently produces
460,000 tons of cement annually. The plant utilizes approxi-
mately 75,000 tons of coal and 3,600 million cubic feet of
natural gas annually in the cement making process. Early in
spring 1999 Holnam began considering the possibility of
converting the primary source of fuel used at the plant from
coal to wood. The principal objective of this project is to
investigate the extended use of wood as an alternate fuel
source to coal and natural gas at this plant. Several private
organizations and government agencies are supporting
Holnam in their efforts to achieve this objective, including
the city of Fort Collins, Larimer County, the Colorado State
Forest Service, the USDA Forest Service (State and Pri-
vate), and Colorado State University. Included in this pub-
lication is project background, a brief description of the
cement making process, a discussion of conversion technol-
ogy, and the process to commercialization. The anticipated
benefits and challenges of using wood at the Holnam plant
are also discussed.
Project Background _____________
From April until autumn 1999, representatives of Holnam
met with Dr. Dennis Lynch (Professor Emeritus, Colorado
State University) and Larimer County personnel to discuss
the potential of using waste wood from the Larimer County
landfill as an alternative fuel at Holnam. In August, John
Zerbe (USDA Forest Products Laboratory) visited Holnam
to observe the operation and wrote a report regarding the
potential for utilizing wood at the plant (Zerbe 1999). A
meeting to discuss alternatives for diverting clean wood
from the Larimer County landfill occurred in September
between representatives of Holnam and the city of Fort
Collins Natural Resource Department. In November and
December  Holnam met with Janelle Henderson (Director of
the Larimer County Natural Resources Department) and
other Larimer County officials to discuss development of a
strategy for diversion of landfill material.
The Coloradoan, a local newspaper, published an article
on December 14 on the intent of Holnam to utilize clean wood
wastes as an alternative fuel source. On December 16, a
public meeting was held in the Larimer County courthouse.
Although reviews were mixed, there was generally a positive
response from the community toward utilizing clean wood
waste at Holman. Also on that day, Channel 9 Television
(NBC) of Denver, CO, toured the Holnam plant and filmed
a story that aired on that day’s 5:00 p.m. newscast. A follow-
up article was published by The Coloradoan on December
17. Subsequent articles appeared in The North Forty news-
paper and the Loveland, CO, Reporter Herald. Generally,
these articles were favorable.
During the public hearing held on December 16, attendees
determined by consensus that four principal issues needed
to be addressed. These were:
1. Potential fuel sources
2. Transportation
3. Process modifications
4. Air pollution concerns
Four committees were established to investigate these is-
sues. These committees met throughout the winter and
spring 2000. Some of the findings are discussed in subse-
quent sections.
In addition to committee meetings, two public meetings in
March and April were held in Laporte, sponsored by the
Laporte Business Alliance. The local community had many

Use of Wood as an Alternative Fuel to Coal and Natural Gas at the Holnam Cement Plant, North of LaPorte, Colorado
concerns, many of which had been expressed in the previous
December meeting and which were being addressed by the
committees established at that meeting.
One particular new concern pertained to the Title V
permit that Holnam was in the process of applying for. This
permit is required by the State prior to using wood or other
alternative fuels on a production scale at the plant. The
initial permit application (which has since been revised)
submitted by Holnam listed a broad range of nonhazardous
materials that could potentially be used as fuel at the plant.
Even though only clean wood had been used in testing to date
and there had been minimal opposition to Holnam utilizing
clean wood at the plant, there were concerns that Holnam
would burn other materials such as plastics and rubber tires
if permitted to do so. Therefore, the community was con-
cerned over what materials Holnam would be permitted to
utilize. There were articles in local newspapers reflecting
these concerns. In particular, there was considerable resis-
tance to using rubber tires at the plant. There was also
concern regarding wood from the landfill. While the majority
of this wood is clean, there is a percentage of this wood that
is contaminated with a variety of substances including
finishes, treatments, and adhesives. The impacts of these
contaminants on air emissions are uncertain and need to be
investigated. Nonetheless, Holnam was focusing on obtain-
ing a Title V permit to use clean wood.
The Cement Making Process ______
The Holnam plant north of Laporte uses a unique process
to manufacture cement. Limestone is crushed to reduce its
size and then blended with materials such as shale, sand-
stone, iron ore, mill scale, fly ash, clay, or sand into a dry
powder. The mix is then normally processed in a calciner
that burns the organic material in it and drives off CO2. It is
then fed into the elevated end of the 14.5 feet wide by 190 feet
long rotary kiln at the plant. Materials in the kiln pass
through controlled zones that heat them to 2,450 ∞F. Flame
temperatures in the kiln exceed 3,000 ∞F. The intense heat
chemically alters the materials forming walnut-sized pellets
called cement clinker.
The cement clinker is then cooled. Heat from the clinker is
extracted by air flow. This heat is used to supplement the
heat from fuels used in the kiln. The clinker is mixed with a
proportioned amount of gypsum in a finishing mill where
steel balls pound the clinker into a fine powder (cement). The
cement is packaged in bags for shipping or shipped bulk to
retail outlets and construction sites.
Conversion Technology __________
In 1999 and 2000, research and testing were conducted to
determine the best approach for converting the Holnam
plant to wood as the primary fuel source. A series of test
burns were conducted and some equipment purchased to
facilitate testing. Important findings from this work, along
with a brief discussion of wood as a fuel are presented.
Wood has a heating value that ranges between 8,000 and
12,500 Btu per ovendry pound, with most species falling
between 8,000 and 10,000 Btu per ovendry pound (Inc 1979).
Bark ranges between 7,500 and 10,500 Btu per ovendry
pound. This compares to a range of 6,900 to 14,300 Btu per
pound for coal. Based on the type of bituminous coal typically
used at Holnam, which has a higher heating value of 11,000
Btu per pound, approximately 1.3 tons of dry wood yields the
same amount of heat as 1 ton of coal.
Although heat production is affected by numerous factors
(Ince 1979), one factor that dramatically affects recoverable
heat generated by combusting wood is moisture. Because
wood is hygroscopic it readily picks up and loses moisture.
The higher the moisture content, the lower the amount of
recoverable heat available from combustion. Therefore, to
maximize recoverable heat it is beneficial to dry wood prior
to combustion.
In May 1999, the first test burns were conducted at the
plant with good results. A subsequent test incorporating
wood into kiln feed to test material flow was conducted in
August. Also in August, Holnam arranged for the lease/
purchase of two screw augers to feed saw dust and fine wood
chips into the calciner. In October, the first calciner test burn
using dry sawdust fed into the system with the screws was
conducted. The calciner responded positively and no air
quality problems were detected. A second burn was con-
ducted in November using one load of wet sawdust and one
load of dry sawdust. The calciner did not respond well to wet
sawdust; however, the dry sawdust burned well and the coal
feed was shut off during this phase of the test, proving that
wood can replace coal in the system.
Later in November, a test burn was conducted feeding
wood chips into kiln feed to test material flow. During
December, 21 tons of green pine chips were supplied by the
Colorado State Forest Service for testing. Wood chips were
fed into the roller mill with the standard raw rock feed.
Although the test was short, results were positive. Later in
December, a test was conducted to find out if screw augers
would handle wood chips. The chips did not feed well through
the screw augers and heavier equipment is required.
Testing continued into January, February, and March
2000, culminating with an extended test using 98 tons of
green pine chips processed from beetle-killed pine trees
provided by the Colorado State Forest Service. Chips were
put into the system with both the raw rock feed and the coal
feed. Approximately 28 tons of chips were introduced with
the raw rock and the remaining 70 tons were introduced
with coal. Wood introduced into the coal feed was mixed with
coke at a 1:1 ratio by volume, and then with coal at a feed rate
of 15 percent wood/coke and 85 percent coal. Generally,
these tests were very successful and the wood worked well
with existing systems at the plant.
Significant process modifications may still be necessary to
utilize wood at all firing systems of the Holnam plant. There
is a need to further study how wood can be fed to firing
systems and what modifications are necessary to use it. The
main barrier has been developing a feed system for wood
chips that works well with existing firing systems at the
plant. The screw auger system installed for test burns using
sawdust did not work well with 1.5 inch wood chips. Mixing
rock and wood together to produce “crusher” feed has been
successfully tested as one alternative for introducing wood
into the process. However, the plant needs the capability to
selectively get sawdust and small wood chips to any of the
three existing fuel pumps. Feeding wood into the existing
coal bin is possible if mixed at up to 10 percent with coal. This

Mackes
provides some wood feed to all firing points simultaneously;
however, this will not be sufficient for complete replacement.
Further testing is scheduled in the future to evaluate
systems developed to handle and feed wood. Air emissions
from the plant (including stack testing) will be monitored
during testing. With the successful completion of this test-
ing, a portion of the plant should be ready to utilize wood on
a commercial scale. As noted previously, Holnam is cur-
rently in the process of applying for a Title V permit that is
required by the State prior to burning wood on a production
scale. Conducting this testing is a necessary step toward
obtaining this permit. Work required to develop the wood
handling systems necessary to completely convert the plant
was scheduled to be completed by summer 2000.
Process to Commercialization _____
Wood as the primary fuel source at Holnam requires that
two key issues be addressed. These are completing modifica-
tion of existing plant processes to accommodate wood (ad-
dressed previously) and procuring an adequate supply of low
cost wood in a form suitable for use at the plant. To date test
burns have shown that wood can be used to fuel plant
processes. Although preliminary studies indicate that a suf-
ficient supply of wood exists, there is a need to establish a
delivery system for getting wood to the plant, including collec-
tion (sorting), size reduction, drying, and transportation.
Based on testing conducted at the Holnam plant, clean
wood material in the form of sawdust or chips up to 1.5 inches
in length work well with existing systems. To maximize
recoverable heat from combustion, it is important that the
wood be dry, preferably having a moisture content of less
than 10 percent. Based on economic constraints, wood will
also have to be low cost. Four potential sources of low cost
wood have been identified by Ward and others (1999):
• Municipal waste
• Construction waste and demolition debris
• Primary and secondary wood manufacturers
• Forest residues
Some information has been generated on potential sources
of wood. A preliminary wood biomass report by Lynch (1999)
noted that 187,237 tons of waste was delivered to the
Larimer County landfill in 1996. An estimated 29,563 tons
of commercial wood waste (primarily construction debris)
and 2,410 tons of wood from residential waste were included
in this total. In 1997, the Larimer County landfill received
166,683 tons of waste. The reduction was due to the estab-
lishment of a new Waste Management landfill near Ault and
the majority of their waste streams went to that landfill. In
1997, an estimated 26,318 tons of wood were in commercial
waste delivered to the Larimer County landfill, which
amounts to approximately 72 tons per day. Additional wood
could come from the Waste Management landfill. Waste
Management estimated that they currently receive approxi-
mately 1 ton of construction wood waste per day.
Because wood is often intermingled with other construc-
tion debris, the clean wood suitable for fuel at Holnam would
have to be sorted. Lynch (1999) reported that all parties
contacted suggested that some type of wood collection sys-
tem should be possible. Once collected the wood must be
reduced to a suitable size through chipping or other more
suitable methods. Whatever the method of sorting and size
reduction, the consensus is that the tonnage of sorted clean
wood suitable for fuel would be something less than the total
amount delivered to the landfills. Based on fuel require-
ments provided by Holnam, up to 350 tons of wood per day
will be required to convert the plant entirely to wood;
therefore other sources of wood will be required.
Another potential source of fuelwood for Holnam is primary
and secondary wood manufacturers along the Front Range of
Colorado. Primary manufacturers along the Front Range
include several small sawmills, while secondary manufac-
turers include millwork, cabinet, and furniture companies.
Residues from secondary manufacturers have a relatively
high percentage of hardwood with good Btu value. In addi-
tion, this wood tends to be relatively dry and as a result,
burns well. Several local manufacturers have provided wood
for testing. In one test where oak and maple residues where
used, Holnam was able to cut off the coal feed to the calciner
for several hours. While none of the primary and secondary
wood manufacturers individually generate a substantial
amount of wood residues, collectively they do. Therefore,
further investigation is needed to determine the amount of
low cost wood that could be procured from these manufactur-
ers. Other possibilities, including used pallets, should also
be investigated.
The forests of Larimer County could also be a significant
source of supply for Holnam. Lynch (1999) commented that
the private, State, and Federal forest lands in the county
have more trees existing now than at any time in recorded
history. Lynch reported that NEOS Corporation estimated
over 1.4 million tons of wood could potentially be removed
from Larimer County in forest restoration projects. These
materials would have to be removed, chipped, dried, and
transported to Holnam, resulting in a cost. Based on prelimi-
nary estimates, in the absence of government subsidies,
supplying wood from the forest to Holnam within economic
guidelines for fuel costs established by the company will be
a challenge. However, because of the enormous resource and
potential public benefits, there is a need to investigate how
this might be accomplished.
Larimer County and the Colorado State Forest Service
have also initiated a project to assist private land owners
with disposal of residues from their properties. Ten mobile
collection sites are going to be established strategically in
the county and these sites could present a wood supply
opportunity for this project.
Benefits and Challenges _________
The economics of utilizing wood at Holnam are tied closely
to collection, size reduction, transport, and drying costs. The
company is anticipating making a significant capital invest-
ment (in excess of $1 million) to build a system capable of
handling wood. In accordance with corporate guidelines, the
payback period must not exceed 3 years. This limits the
amount that Holnam can pay for wood wastes and residues.
Given size reduction and transport costs, which depending
on haul distance could easily exceed economical limits, it is
generally thought that the wood will have to be procured at
little or no additional cost. Fortunately, there are sources of

174

Use of Wood as an Alternative Fuel to Coal and Natural Gas at the Holnam Cement Plant, North of LaPorte, Colorado
wood, particularly waste wood destined for landfills, that
can be diverted at an acceptable cost. In addition, Holnam
will attempt to take full advantage of tax credits associated
with using biobased fuels. These tax credits could poten-
tially improve the economics of converting the plant to wood
fuel.
Because the availability of wood could be seasonal or
periodically in short supply, coal and natural gas systems
currently in place at the plant can be used as backup.
The plant currently stockpiles 6,000 tons of coal, which is a
1 month supply. Approximately 7,500 tons of wood, a supply
for a comparable period, would also be stockpiled, if available.
Environmentally, there should be a reduction in air emis-
sions from the plant if wood is burned in place of coal. Zerbe
(1999) reported that combustion of wood should be relatively
free of sulfur, heavy metal, and particulate emissions when
compared to coal. The absence of sulfur could be a major
benefit because Holnam currently scrubs sulfur from coal
with calcium oxide (CaO). Although CaO is abundant, reduc-
ing the level of scrubbing could potentially increase cement
yield and reduce the amount of calcium sulfate that must be
disposed of. Although clean wood is relatively free of heavy
metals, there is potential for introducing contaminated
wood into the process; for example, lead paint found in
demolition debris from older buildings. It will be important
to follow EPA regulations to separate clean wood for recy-
cling from contaminated wood. Particulate emissions from
complete wood combustion are anticipated to be relatively
low because the ash content of wood is small, typically
around 1 percent. This compares to greater than 5 percent
for the coal currently used by Holnam. In either case, ash
becomes an integral part of the plant product.
Additionally, there are direct benefits to Larimer County
and local city governments. Using this wood as fuel provides
an alternative to disposing of wood in the landfill. At the
Larimer County landfill, removing wood from the stream of
trash into the landfill will save space, extending the life of
the landfill. Based on the estimated value of space at the
landfill determined by the county, removal of wood wastes
could save over $1 million annually. Another potential
benefit to the landfill is a reduction in methane gas emitted
from wood decomposition. If done soon enough, this could
eliminate the need for a $2 million methane recovery system.
Using forest thinnings and residues would also provide
benefits to the community. Forests found in the region are
typically composed of dense overcrowded homogeneous
stands of small diameter trees with little or no commercial
value. Thinning out these stands and promoting the concept
of defensible space around homes and other structures
would increase public safety by reducing fire risks. Reducing
stand densities would also improve forest health. Proper
management of both private and public forest lands is often
hindered by the lack of places to take forest residues. They
are typically burned, which contributes to poor air quality,
or are sent to a landfill. The establishment of 10 mobile
collection sites throughout Larimer County should help.
Once capital costs are recovered, the plant should see a
significant reduction in the cost of doing business, because
energy represents a significant portion of that cost. Therefore,
the plant should become more competitive and profitable to
operate. Improving the profitability of the Holnam plant has
many potential benefits to the local community. Even though
plant processes are continually upgraded and modernized,
this plant is relatively old, so there are always concerns of
the plant closing because of an inability to compete with
cement manufactured at newer state-of-the-art facilities.
Plant engineers estimate that there are sufficient raw mate-
rials available at this location to operate for at least 50 years.
Successfully completing this project should help keep the
relatively high paying jobs at the plant in the area and
stabilize the local economy for many years.
There will probably be a need to form a company to supply
wood to the Holnam plant. This company would likely
operate as a small private business employing four to five
people. It would collect, sort, and process wood into a size
suitable for use at Holnam. The company would probably
operate from a base located rurally in the area around
Laporte, using two or more trucks to transport wood.
Concerns expressed at public meetings were related pri-
marily to the impact of wood combustion on air emissions
from the plant and the impact of increased truck traffic on
the local road system and community. As discussed previ-
ously, it is thought there should actually be an improvement
in air quality over that experienced with burning coal.
Testing and monitoring of stack emissions by an indepen-
dent consulting firm will be necessary to verify that the plant
is in compliance with air quality standards. A study needs to
be conducted to minimize the impact of transporting wood on
local roads and community. The study must consider the
location of wood suppliers in relationship to the plant,
establishing truck routes and travel times that minimize
impact. This evaluation will be ongoing as the number of
suppliers and the flow of wood into Holnam increases.
There was also some concern expressed about introducing
wood in certain phases of the cement making process. Zerbe
(1999) stated that there was the potential for fire (and a
remote possibility of explosion) in the roller mill operation at
the plant if wood was introduced at this location. This was
because of the dust cloud created by the milling operation
and the high temperature of the gas stream flowing into the
mill. In extreme conditions the gas stream entering the mill
can exceed the flash point of wood, and if concentrated wood
dust came in contact with the gas at this point, a fire (or
explosion) could result. However, mixing the rock feed with
the wood and then introducing it into the roller mill appears
to minimize this risk because limestone is relatively inert
and comprises 92 percent of the material mass. This coupled
with additional safety precautions (primarily reducing the
temperature of the gas stream into the mill, which has been
done) should allow for the safe introduction of wood into the
process at this point.
Conclusions____________________
If Holnam successfully converts to wood as the primary
fuel source, other cement plants throughout the region could
similarly investigate using wood wastes and residues as
fuel. Because of the preliminary research at Holnam, several
other facilities have already expressed an interest. There
are also Holnam plants in Canon City, CO, Montana, Utah,
and Oklahoma that could potentially use biomass as fuel if
the LaPorte plant successfully converts.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) prohibits discrimination in all its
programs and activities on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, religion,
age, disability, political beliefs, sexual orientation, or marital or family status. (Not
all prohibited bases apply to all programs.) Persons with disabilities who require
alternative means for communication of program information (Braille, large print,
audiotape, etc.) should contact USDA’s TARGET Center at (202) 720-2600 (voice
and TDD).
To file a complaint of discrimination, write USDA, Director, Office of Civil Rights,
Room 326-W, Whitten Building, 1400 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington,
DC 20250-9410 or call (202) 720-5964 (voice or TDD). USDA is an equal
opportunity provider and employer.
The Rocky Mountain Research Station develops scientific information
and technology to improve management, protection, and use of the
forests and rangelands. Research is designed to meet the needs of
National Forest managers, Federal and State agencies, public and
private organizations, academic institutions, industry, and individuals.
Studies accelerate solutions to problems involving ecosystems,
range, forests, water, recreation, fire, resource inventory, land reclama-
tion, community sustainability, forest engineering technology, multiple
use economics, wildlife and fish habitat, and forest insects and dis-
eases. Studies are conducted cooperatively, and applications may be
found worldwide.
