Abstract. 
In grassland ecosystems, symbiotic associations between plants and mycor- 
rhizal fungi are widespread and have important influences on the life histories, demography, 
and species interactions of plants, and on belowground ecosystem processes. To assess the 
consequences of the symbiosis at the plant community level, we conducted a 5-yr field 
experiment in tallgrass prairie to investigate the influence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 
on plant species composition, relative abundances, and diversity. Replicate plots in which 
mycorrhizal fungi were suppressed with benomyl application every two weeks during each 
growing season, were compared to nontreated mycorrhizal control plots on six watershed 
units at the Konza Prairie in northeastern Kansas. Benomyl successfully reduced mycor- 
rhizal colonization to <25% of mycorrhizal control plots. Mycorrhizal colonization of roots 
in control plots was inversely related to annual precipitation. Suppression of mycorrhizae 
resulted in decreases in abundances of the dominant, obligately mycotrophic C, tall grasses, 
compensatory increases in abundances of many subordinate facultatively mycotrophic C, 
grasses and forbs, but no change in total aboveground biomass, as estimated from canopy 
density. Suppression of mycorrhizal symbiosis resulted in a large increase in plant species 
diversity. Two possible mechanisms for mycorrhizal mediation of plant species composition 
and diversity are: (1) alterations in resource distribution among neighbors via hyphal con- 
nections, and (2) differential host species responses to mycorrhizal fungal colonization in 
communities in which the competitive dominants are more strongly or more weakly my- 
cotrophic than their neighbors. The results of this study demonstrate that mycorrhizal 
symbiosis can have large effects on plant community structure, and that differential host 
species response to fungal colonization is a key factor explaining the dominance of warm- 
season C, grasses in tallgrass prairie and limiting plant species evenness and diversity. The 
results also underscore the importance of above- and belowground linkages in tallgrass 
prairie and indicate that alterations in belowground fungi and rhizosphere processes can 
have large effects on aboveground floristic composition and diversity in grasslands.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are ubiquitous 
tic and suggests that they may vary along a symbiotic

continuum from strong mutualism to antagonism

(Johnson et al. 1997). Furthermore, most work on the

alistic. The fungus gains a carbon source and the host 
glasshouse or laboratory, or in monospecific stands, 
plant gains several potential benefits from infection, 
and field data relating plant performance to mycorrhizal 
including enhanced uptake and transport of poorly mo- 
symbiosis are inconsistent (Fitter 1985). Hence the role 
bile soil nutrients, improved water relations, and re- 
of mycorrhizas in natural plant populations and mul- 
duced pathogenic infections (Cox et al. 1975, Abbot

and Robson 1984, Allen and Allen 1986, Newman and

mycorrhizal fungi may result in no benefit or detri-

(Bethlenfalvay et al. 1982, Fitter 1986, Francis and 
1989, Allen 1991, Hartnett et. al. 1993), although the

patterns and mechanisms remain the subject of much 
debate.

prairie plant communities. Several recent studies have 
demonstrated that AM fungi are ubiquitous and eco- 
logically important in tallgrass prairie, and that co-
occurring plant species vary considerably in their ger- 
mination, growth, and flowering responses to mycor- 
rhizal infection along a continuum from highly re-
sponsive, obligately mycotrophic species to facultatively 
mycotrophic, nonresponsive species (Hetrick et al. 
1988, 1992, Hartnett et al. 1994, Wilson and Hartnett 
1997, Wilson and Hartnett 1998). Mycorrhizas can sig- 
nificantly alter the competitive relationships among 
tallgrass prairie plant species, and there are significant 
interactions between mycorrhizal symbiosis and both 
fire and ungulate grazing, two important natural dis- 
turbances regulating tallgrass prairie community struc- 
ture (Wallace 1987, Hetrick et al. 1990a, Bentivenga 
and Hetrick 1991). 
Based on these interactions and strong differential 
plant species responses to AM fungi, we hypothesized 
that changes in the activity/abundance of AM fungi 
would result in significant shifts in plant species com- 
position, relative abundances, and diversity in tallgrass 
prairie. More specifically, since the competitive dom- 
inants in tallgrass prairie are also the most strongly 
mycotrophic species, we predicted that active AM as- 
sociations would decrease rather than increase floristic 
diversity in this system. Further, as a result of complex 
mycorrhizal effects on the biotic interactions of their 
host plants, patterns indicative of "apparent competi- 
tion" (sensu Connell [1992]) and "apparent mutual- 
ism" may be common in tallgrass prairie. For example, 
it is likely that, in the field, the positive effects of AM 
fungi on the growth of some mycotrophic species may 
be offset by negative effects resulting from increased 
competitive effects of their more strongly mycotrophic 
neighbors. Thus, we hypothesized that growth and de- 
mographic responses of certain species to AM fungi in 
the field will differ in direction and magnitude from 
their responses to mycorrhizal colonization under 
glasshouse conditions. To test these hypotheses, 
changes in plant community structure were measured 
in a long-term field experiment in which AM fungi were 
suppressed in replicate tallgrass prairie plots over a 5-yr 
period. Because previous work in tallgrass prairie in- 
dicates that significant interactions occur among burn- 
ing regimes, belowground biota and processes, and 
plant responses, the influence of mycorrhizae on plant 
community structure was also compared between fre- 
quently and infrequently burned sites. 
The experiment was conducted at the Konza Prairie 
Research Natural Area (KPRNA), a 3487-ha tallgrass 
prairie preserve located in the Flint Hills region of 
northeastern Kansas (39'05' N, 96"35' W). The site is 
owned by The Nature Conservancy and is managed for 
ecological research by Kansas State University, Divi- 
sion of Biology (http://climate.konza.ksu.edu). The

Flint Hills region encompasses >1.6 X 10"a 
extend-
ing throughout much of eastern Kansas from near the 
Kansas-Nebraska border south into northeastern Okla- 
homa, and contains the largest remaining area of un- 
plowed tallgrass prairie in North America. 
The vegetation is native tallgrass prairie, dominated 
by the perennial, warm-season matrix grasses big bluc- 
stem (Aridropogori gerardii Vit.), little bluestem (An- 
dropogon scoparius Michx.), Indian grass (Sorghas- 
trum rizttans [L.] Nash), and switchgrass (Pariicum vir- 
gatum L.) (Kuchler 1967, Freeman and Hulbert 1985). 
A highly diverse mixture of other less abundant species 
includes warm-season and cool-season grasses, com- 
posites, legumes, and other forbs. A few woody species 
such as leadplant (Amorpha canescens Pursh), buck- 
brush (Symphoricarpos orbicltlatlts Moench.), New 
Jersey tea (Ceanothus herbaceous Raf.), and smooth 
sumac (Rhus glabra L.) are locally common. The vas- 
cular flora of KPRNA includes >500 species repre- 
senting >90 families (Freeman and Hulbert 1985). Av- 
erage monthly temperature ranges from a January low 
of -2.7"C to a July high of 26.6"C. Average annual 
total precipitation is 835 mm with 75% falling during 
the growing season (Bark 1987). During the study pe- 
riod (1991-1995) annual precipitation varied over two- 
fold, with a mean of 857 mm (Fig. 1). The residual 
soils are Chase silt loams and silty clay loams derived 
from Permian limestones, shales, and cherty lime-
stones. Soil analyses of these study plots were typical 
of KPRNA soils. which are generally low in nutrients 
(3.5-6.0 kg/g available P [Bray test I], pH of 6.0, 2.3- 
5.0% organic matter, 265-285 kg/g potassium, and 
2.0-6.0 pg/g NO,-N). Spores of 13 species of mycor- 
rhizal fungi were identified in soil samples taken from 
the study sites. In terms of spore densities, Gloinus 
aggregatum, G. constrictum, and G. macrocarpum are 
the dominant species (Eom 1998). 
Replicate long-term burning and grazing treatments 
on KPRNA are applied at the watershed level. KPRNA

is divided into 60 watershed units (average size = 0.55 
km2), each subjected to a specific combination of pre- 
scribed burning regime (burned at 1, 2, 4, 10, and 20- 
yr intervals, and burned in February, April, July, or 
November) and grazing treatment (grazed by bison [Bi-
sori bisori], cattle [Bos taurus], and ungrazed). Six un- 
grazed sites were used for this study, including an up- 
land (shallow Florence cherty silt loam) prairie site in 
each of two annually burned watersheds (1B and ID), 
an upland site in each of two infrequently burned wa- 
tersheds (10B and 20D) and two lowland (Tully silt 
clay loam) sites, one annually burned and one infre- 
quently burned (HQB). Prescribed fires in each of these 
watersheds occur in the spring (late April) of their as- 
signed years. 
At each site 20 replicate permanent 2 X 2 m plots 
were established in early 1991 along a randomly lo- 
cated transect, with a 2-m space between each plot. Ten 
of the plots were randomly assigned as long-term my- 
corrhizal suppression plots. In each of these plots, AM 
fungi were suppressed by the application of the fun- 
gicide benomyl as a soil drench (7.5 L per plot) at the 
rate of 1.25 g/m2 (active ingredient). The mycorrhizal 
suppression plots were treated every two weeks 
throughout each growing season (April through Oc- 
tober) beginning in 1991. The control plots each re- 
ceived no fungicide, but an equivalent volume of water 
(7.5 L) was applied every two weeks. To evaluate the 
effectiveness of the fungicide, three soil cores (2.5 cm 
diameter X 14 cm deep) were removed from both fun- 
gicide-treated and control plots each October through- 
out the study. Roots were extracted from the soil, 
washed free of soil, stained in trypan blue (Phillips and 
Hayman 1970), and examined microscopically to as- 
sess percentage root colonization by mycorrhizal fungi 
using a Petri dish scored in 1-cm squares (Daniels et 
al. 1981). 
Although its potential effects on other soil microflora 
components are poorly known, benomyl application 
has the fewest drawbacks of all potential methods of 
AM fungal suppression and has been used successfully 
in a wide array of greenhouse and field studies (e.g., 
Fitter 1986, Fitter and Nichols 1988, Hetrick et al. 
1989, 1994, Carey et al. 1992, Hartnett et al. 1993, 
1994). Benomyl is effective in reducing AM fungal 
colonization (Fitter and Nichols 1988, Sukarno et al. 
1993, Wilson and Hartnett 1997) and has no direct 
effects on a wide range of plants in the absence of 
fungi (Paul et al. 1989). The following lines of evidence 
also indicate that the primary effect of benomyl is sup- 
pression of mutualistic mycorrhizal associations. (1) 
Previous experiments have shown that effects of be- 
nomyl on host plant growth can be reversed by in- 
creasing phosphorus availability (e.g., Hetrick et al. 
1986). (2) Prairie plants grown in native soil treated 
with benomyl show identical growth responses to those 
grown in pasteurized soil amended with a sieved (30- 
p,m) suspension of nonsterile soil to add back other 
soil microflora components (Hetrick et al. 1986). (3) 
Application of benomyl results in significant decreases 
in the growth of obligately mycotrophic prairie plants, 
rather than increases that would be predicted if the 
greatest effect of the fungicide were on pathogenic fun- 
gi or other antagonistic species. Furthermore, relative 
to forests and other more mesic habitats, there is no 
evidence that pathogenic fungi play a significant role 
in the life histories and population biology of prairie 
plants, compared to the large role of mycorrhizal fungi. 
Benomyl may suppress pathogenic fungi as well as AM 
fungi, in which case any measured growth enhancement 
of plants not treated with fungicide over treated plants 
will underestimate rather than overestimate mycorrhi- 
zal benefit (Carey et al. 1992). It is unknown, however, 
to what extent benomyl may also influence other mu- 
tualistic endophytic fungi such as mycophyllas or sap- 
rophytes, or their interactions with AM fungi. Assess- 
ment of soil microbial biomass of our KPRNA long- 
term plots showed no significant change in total fungal 
or bacterial biomass, fungal : bacterial ratios, or micro- 
bial carbon and nitrogen after 8 yr of benomyl treat- 
ment, although potentially mineralizable carbon and 
nitrogen and soil respiration were higher in benomyl- 
treated plots (Smith 1998). Responses by the nematode 
community also suggest the effects of benomyl were 
selective (Smith 1998). 
The vegetation within all plots was sampled in May 
and September of 1991, 1993, and 1995. Sampling 
twice each season was necessary because the plant spe- 
cies vary in their growth and flowering phenology, and 
a single sampling would introduce significant bias in 
abundance estimates against those species not growing 
actively during the sampling period. In each plot, the 
cover and frequency of each plant species was esti-
mated using a modified point-frame method (Cook and 
Stubbendieck 1986). A frame containing 10 1 m long 
vertical pins arranged in parallel at 10 cm apart was 
placed systematically at four locations (each 25 cm 
apart) within the central 1 m' of the plot (four frames 
= 40 pins per plot). Every contact of the aboveground 
structures of each plant species with each pin was re- 
corded. From the pin-contact data, the relative cover 
was calculated for each plant species (total number of 
pin-contacts made by individuals of species .u + total 
number of pin-contacts of all species) for each of the 
two sample dates each year, and for each species the 
maximum value attained between the two sample dates 
was retained for analysis. The frequency (percentage 
of the 10-pin frames in which species x was encoun- 
tered) also was estimated for each plant species. The 
total number of pin contacts of all species was used as 
an index of total canopy density in each plot. Previous 
use of this pin-contact method on these tallgrass prairie 
sites showed that the total number of pin contacts of 
all species is also strongly correlated with total above- 
ground plant biomass (Hickman 1996). Plant species

diversity (Shannon's H'), and evenness were calculated 
using both types of abundance data (frequency and cov- 
er). Effects of benomyl and fire frequency on each re- 
sponse variable (species abundances, richness, diver- 
sity, evenness, canopy density) were analyzed for each 
sampling date via two-way ANOVA, using the SAS 
statistical package (SAS Institute 1989). An analysis 
using transects as replications revealed no significant 
fire frequency X mycorrhizal interaction. Thus, data 
from the annually burned watersheds were combined 
and subsequent ANOVA of mycorrhizal effects (be- 
nomyl treatment vs. mycorrhizal control) was con-
ducted using plots as replicates. 
RESULTS 
The benomyl treatments every two weeks were suc- 
cessful in greatly reducing mycorrhizal colonization of 
roots. There were no significant initial differences in 
root colonization between treatment and control plots 
in 1991 (the time when benomyl applications were ini- 
tiated), but benomyl successfully reduced percent my- 
corrhizal root colonization to < 5 8  cach season from 
1992 through 1995 (Fig. 2). Because root samples were 
consistently collected under canopies dominated by the 
matrix grasses Andropogon gerardii and Sorghastrum 
nutans, these data reflect a decrease in the mycorrhizal 
colonization of the same plant species rather than a 
decrease in the proportion of mycorrhizal plants. On 
average, root colonization levels in benomyl-treated 
plots were maintained at 3.9%, -25% of untreated con- 
trol plots. There was sign~ficant interannual variation 
in root colonization levels In the control plots. My- 
corrhizal root colonization was significantly negatively 
correlated to annual precipitation ( P  = 0.01) during 
this 5-yr period (Fig. 3). 
Significant shifts in the relative abundances of tall- 
grass prairie plant species occurred over the 5-yr period 
in the fungicide-treated plots. Benomyl applications re- 
sulted in a significant decrease in the percent cover of 
the dominant warm-season grasses Andropogon ger- 
arrlii, Sorghastrum nutans, and A. scoparius (Fig. 4a). 
The only exception to this pattern among the warm- 
season tallgrasses was switchgrass (Panicum 12irga- 
turn), which showed no significant difference between 
control and fungicide-treated plots in any year. Con- 
versely, several subdominant warm-season and cool- 
season grasses increased significantly in percent cover 
over the same period with AM fungal suppression. Of 
this group, thc cool-season C ,  graminoids Scribner's 
panicum 
(Dichanthelium oligosanthes), 
Kentucky 
bluegrass (Poa pratensis), and sedges (Carex spp.) 
showed the largest responses, increasing in cover to 
>150% that of control (no fungicide) plots by 1993 
(Fig. 4a). Two subdominant warm-season C, grasses, 
side oats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula) and prairie 
dropseed (Sporobolus spp.) increased significantly with 
mycorrhizal suppression to -50% greater than controls 
by 1993 (Fig. 4a). Other subdominant grasses varied 
in cover among years and showed no significant dif- 
ferences between mycorrhizal-suppression and control 
plots. 
The fungicide treatments also resulted in significant 
increases in the relative abundances of several tallgrass 
prairie forbs. Heath aster (Aster ericoides), aromatic 
aster (A. oblongifolius), Pitcher's sage (Salvia azurea), 
false boneset (Kuhnia eupatroides), and prairie gold- 
enrod (Solidago missouriensis) all increased signifi- 
cantly in relative abundances with fungal suppression 
(Fig. 4b). S. missouriensis showed the greatest re-
sponse, increasing in abundance to >400% that of con- 
trol plots by 1995. The low abundances and large tem-

poral variation in cover among other forbs resulted in 
the inability to detect significant effects of the mycor-
rhizal-suppression treatment. However, there was a 
consistent trend among these rarer forb species in that, 
for all species in both 1993 and 1995, their mean cover 
was greater in fungicide-treated plots relative to con-
trols. 
The net result of these different species responses 
was a significant increase in components of plant spe-
cies diversity with suppression of AM fungi over the 
5-yr period. Plant species richness showed no initial 
differences between fungicide-treated and control plots 
in 1991, but was significantly greater in fungicide-treat-
ed compared to control plots in both spring and fall of 
1993 and 1995 (Fig. 5a). In both 1993 and 1995, mean 
plant species richness was 6.0 species/m2 in control 
plots and 7.1 species/m2 in the benomyl-treated plots, 
an 18% increase in alpha species richness due to my-
corrhizal suppression. The evenness of species relative 
abundances showed similar patterns, with no initial dif-
ferences in 1991 and significantly greater evenness in 
mycorrhizal-suppressed plots compared to controls 
(Fig. 5b). Plant species diversity (Shannon's H') was 
significantly increased by suppression of AM fungi 
(Fig. 5c). There was no initial difference in species 
diversity (mean H') between fungicide-treated and con-
trol plots in 1991. Thereafter, however, plant species 
diversity in the mycorrhizal plots remained relatively 
constant, whereas diversity in the fungicide-treated 
plots was significantly increased (Fig. 5c). For both the 
spring and fall vegetation sampling, the enhancement 
in plant species diversity with fungicide treatment was 
greater in 1995 than in 1993. In 1993 the mean diversity 
of benomyl-treated plots was 14% greater than my-
corrhizal control plots. In 1995 the effect of benomyl 
treatment was enhanced even further and diversity of 
benomyl-treated plots was 42% higher than controls. 
Despite these marked shifts in plant community com-
position and species diversity in response to AM fungal 
suppression, the fungicide treatment resulted in no 
change in total aboveground canopy density or bio-
mass, as estimated by the total number of plant contacts 
with the 40 vertical pins within each plot (Fig. 5d). 
Total canopy density varied considerably between

Suppression of mycorrhizal fungi over several grow- 
ing seasons in tallgrass prairie resulted in marked 
changes in species composition of the aboveground 
plant community. The dominant warm-season matrix 
grasses all declined in abundance with mycorrhizal 
suppression, whereas most of the subordinate C, grass-
es and forbs increased concomitantly. Those species 
that decreased in benomyl-treated plots (Andropogori 
gerardii, Sorghastrum riutans, and A. scoparius) are all 
obligately mycotrophic C, grasses with a mycorrhizal 
dependency/responsiveness of >99% (Hetrick et al. 
1990b). Mycorrhizal dependency is calculated as the 
difference in mean biomass between mycorrhizal and 
nonmycorrhizal plants as a proportion of the mean bio- 
mass of mycorrhizal plants (Hetrick et al. 1990b). In 
contrast, the subordinate grass and forb species that 
increased in the fungicide-treated plots are mostly fac- 
ultatively mycotrophic species with lower mycorrhizal 
dependencies and growth responses. For example, the 
mycorrhizal dependencies of three forb species that 
showed significant increases in fungicide-treated plots, 
Aster ericoides, Salvia azurea, and Kuhnia eupatroides, 
are 63, 87, and 22%, respectively. Dichanthelium oli- 
gosanthes, a cool-season grass that showed a large in- 
crease in abundance in benomyl-treated plots, has a 
mycorrhizal dependency of 50%. 
Despite these large changes in species abundances, 
there was no effect of the benomyl treatment on total 
aboveground canopy density or biomass, as estimated 
by the total number of pin-contacts per plot. This lack 
of effect, and the above patterns, suggest that the pri- 
mary effects of suppression of fungi on the above- 
ground plant community were a strong suppression of 
the competitively dominant matrix grasses, and a con- 
comitant increase in the subordinate species. This com- 
pensatory response of subordinate competitors resulted 
in no change in total aboveground canopy density. 
These results are consistent with our earlier greenhouse 
studies of tallgrass prairie microcosms (Wilson and 
Hartnett 1997), and indicate that subordinate faculta- 
tive mycotrophs competing with highly mycorrhiza- 
dependent species experience competitive release when 
mycorrhizae are suppressed. 
The significantly greater plant species diversity in 
the benomyl-treated plots supports our hypothesis that 
active AM associations decrease floristic diversity in 
tallgrass prairie. To our knowledge, this is the first mul- 
tiyear field study to demonstrate a significant role of 
soil fungi on plant species composition and diversity 
in a natural grassland. In a greenhouse experiment, 
Grime et al. (1987) showed that mycorrhizal associa-

tions increased plant species diversity in C,-dominated 
turfgrass microcosms, and Gange et al. (1993) showed 
that fungicide application decreased plant species rich- 
ness in an early successional plant community, both 
the opposite response of our tallgrass prairie field ex- 
periment. 
Several workers have hypothesized different mech- 
anisms whereby mycorrhizal associations may increase 
plant species diversity. Allen (1991) suggested that my- 
corrhizal fungi may increase plant species diversity due 
to spatial heterogeneity of fungal infectivity in field 
soils, allowing nonmycotrophic and mycotrophic spe- 
cies to coexist in patches of low and high inoculum, 
respectively. Other workers, (e.g., Grime et al. 1987, 
Perry et al. 1989, Read 1997, Simard et al. 1997a, b) 
have suggested that interplant transfer of resources via 
hyphal links may result in more even distribution of 
resources within the plant community, reducing the 
ability of certain species to monopolize resources, thus 
creating more equitable competitive effects and pro- 
moting coexistence and greater host plant species di- 
versity. This facilitation hypothesis assumes that all or 
most plants in the community are interconnected to a 
similar extent and benefit equally, or that subordinate 
species gain greater advantage from access to resources 
available within the hyphal network. Earlier '?P label-
ing studies in tallgrass prairie showed that neighboring 
plant species differed significantly in the amount of 
phosphorus transferred between them, and that less my- 
corrhizal-dependent subordinate grasses and forbs re- 
ceived more phosphorus from the dominant obligately 
mycotrophic grass species than did othcr neighboring 
dominant grasses (Fischer-Walter et al. 1996). In ec- 
tomycorrhizal forest communities, Simard et al. 
(1997b) showed a net transfer of carbon from birch to 
fir but no such transfer between these spccies and cedar. 
Until experiments can demonstrate that mycorrhizal 
fungi result in more equitable distribution of resources 
among interspecific host plant neighbors, or greater net 
resource transfer to subordinate competitors, this hy- 
pothesized mechanism remains open to question. 
We suggest that a second and perhaps more parsi- 
monious explanation for mycorrhizal effects on plant 
species diversity, is simply that differential host plant 
specics responses to colonization by mycorrhizal fungi 
result in changes in species diversity if the dominant 
competitors are significantly more strongly or more 
weakly mycotrophic than their neighbors. In the mi- 
crocosm experiment conducted by Grime et al. (1987), 
the dominant C, grass competitors werc more weakly 
mycotrophic than their neighbors. Thus, active my- 
corrhizal associations conferred greater benefit to the 
subordinate competitors and increased coexistence and 
species diversity. By contrast, in our tallgrass prairie 
field experiment, the dominant C, grass competitors 
were more strongly mycotrophic than thcir interspecific 
neighbors. Thus, AM fungal colonization further en- 
hanced their dominance, resulting in a reduction in spe- 
cies diversity. The compensatory increase in abun-
dances of the facultative mycotrophs in response to 
benomyl treatment further supports this hypothesis. 
Connell and Lowman (1989) argued that mycorrhizae 
may similarly enhance competitive dominance and re- 
duce species diversity in some tropical forest cosn-
munities. 
Given the largc variation in response to mycorrhizal 
colonization among tallgrass prairie plant species, and 
the effects of different abiotic and biotic factors such 
as grazing, fire, and water availability on mycorrhi~al 
activity (e.g., Hetrick et al. 1990u, Bentivenga and Hct- 
rick 1991), it is likely that plant community responses 
to these factors may be at least partially due to changes 
in mycorrhizal activity. For example, the inverse re- 
lationship between annual precipitation and mycorrhi- 
zal colonization demonstrated in this study suggests 
that interannual variability in plant species composition 
and relative abundances associated with annual pre- 
cipitation (Knapp et al. 1998) may be partly due to host 
species responses to changes in mycorrhizal activity. 
Previous studics have shown that mycorrhizal sym- 
biosis has significant effects on a number of life history 
and demographic traits in tallgrass prairie plants (Hart- 
nett et al. 1994, Wilson and Hartnett 1997). The present 
field study showa that these effects have large conse- 
quences at the community level, and that mycorrhi~al 
symbiosis and differential host species responses to 
fungal colonization are key factors explaining the dom- 
inance of C, percnnial grasses in tallgrass prairie and 
limiting plant spccies evenness and diversity. Regard- 
less of whether the long-term benomyl treatments in 
this study had effccts on other types of fungi, the results 
underscore the importance of above- and belowground 
linkages in tallgrass prairie and clearly indicate that 
alterations in belowground fungi and rhizosphere pro- 
cesses have large effects on aboveground floristic com- 
position and diversity in these grasslands.
