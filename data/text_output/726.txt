Abstract.
Semiarid ecosystems such as grasslands are characterized by high temporal
variability in abiotic factors, which has led to suggestions that management actions may
be more effective in some years than others. Here we examine this hypothesis in the context
of grassland restoration, which faces two major obstacles: the contingency of native grass
establishment on unpredictable precipitation, and competition from introduced species. We
established replicated restoration experiments over three years at two sites in the northern
Great Plains in order to examine the extent to which the success of several restoration
strategies varied between sites and among years. We worked in 50-yr-old stands of crested
wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum), an introduced perennial grass that has been planted on
.10 3 106 ha in western North America.
Establishment of native grasses was highly contingent on local conditions, varying four-
fold among years and threefold between sites. Survivorship also varied greatly and increased
signiﬁcantly with summer precipitation. No consistent differences were found between drilling
and broadcasting in their effects on establishment, but survivorship was nearly threefold
higher in broadcast plots. Plots without seed added, or with native hay added, had almost no
seedlings of native grasses. In contrast, broadcasting the residue remaining after cleaning
seeds from native hay produced the highest seedling densities of any treatment.
Competition from A. cristatum was signiﬁcantly and consistently reduced through annual
application of a generalist herbicide (glyphosate), which increased native grass establish-
ment and survivorship and the richness and total cover of native species. Herbicide de-
creased standing crop and increased soil moisture and available nitrogen. A. cristatum was
controlled without suppressing native vegetation, both by spraying in early spring, which
selectively killed the cool-season A. cristatum, and by application with a wick, which
selectively killed the taller A. cristatum. A. cristatum persisted over four years, however,
in spite of annual herbicide application. A. cristatum cover in control plots increased sig-
niﬁcantly with summer precipitation.
In summary, broadcasting and drilling differed little in their effects on establishment, but
broadcasting increased survivorship and will allow the emergence of plant-induced hetero-
geneity. Competition from introduced species can be reduced but not eliminated by continuing
herbicide application. Lastly, the positive relationships between precipitation and both A.
cristatum and native seedling survivorship suggest that management should focus on con-
trolling A. cristatum during dry years and on introducing native species during wet years.

rainfall (Knapp and Smith 2001). Because precipitation
inﬂuences species composition (Weaver 1950), pro-
ductivity (Sala et al. 1988), and establishment (Lauen-
roth et al. 1994), grassland management may need to
be timed to exploit windows of opportunity: some man-
agement actions may be most successful in dry years
and others in wet years (Westoby et al. 1989). We ex-
amined this hypothesis in the context of grassland res-
toration in the northern Great Plains where .10 3 106
ha have been planted with introduced perennial grasses
(Pyke 1990, Lesica and DeLuca 1996). Prairie resto-
ration can conserve biodiversity, improve soil nutrient
status, and enhance belowground storage of CO2 (Wil-
son 2002).

Among the greatest challenges to prairie restoration
are the variability of precipitation and the presence of
introduced perennial grasses. These obstacles have
been addressed using a variety of seeding methods,
such as drilling or broadcasting, and management ap-
proaches, such as herbicide application. A recent re-
view, however, found little agreement among experi-
mental studies about the usefulness of contrasting strat-
egies, largely due to differences among study sites in
weather, vegetation, and soil moisture (Wilson 2002).
Our overall goal was to use experiments repeated in
space and time to determine which aspects of resto-
ration are contingent on among-site or among-year var-
iability. This allowed us to examine whether any res-
toration practices give consistent results despite the
great climatic variability of the Great Plains. Resto-
ration problems of particular current interest include
seeding methods, the control of non-native species, and
the use of mulch.
The relative effectiveness of seeding methods, pri-
marily drilling and broadcasting, may be contingent on
weather and soil conditions. Drilling has been favored
for restoration because ‘‘. . . broadcasting of seed is
generally a waste of time on semiarid rangeland. . . ’’
(Hyder et al. 1975). Drilled seeds are more buffered
from drying than are those broadcast on the soil sur-
face. In our region germination was signiﬁcantly higher
for grass seeds buried 1 cm deep than for those scat-
tered on the soil surface (Ambrose and Wilson 2003)
suggesting that drilling should be more effective. Dril-
ling produced much higher establishment than broad-
casting at one site in Saskatchewan, but the opposite
result occurred at another site 200 km away where
broadcasting was more effective (Bakker et al. 1997),
suggesting that the relative efﬁciency of the methods
depends on local conditions. Broadcasting has been
successful for native restorations in Kansas (Kindscher
and Tieszen 1998) and Wisconsin (Howe 1999), and
naturally dispersed native seeds can colonize dry west-
ern prairies (Cofﬁn and Lauenroth 1994). Reviews ﬁnd
few consistent differences between drilling and broad-
casting (Duebbert et al. 1981, Wilson 2002), suggesting
that differences in their success are contingent on local
weather and soils. Broadcasting is more likely than
drilling to produce natural plant-induced patterns of
spatial heterogeneity (Allen 1988, Cofﬁn et al. 1996,
Kleb and Wilson 1997). Thus one of our goals was to
determine whether drilling or broadcasting was con-
sistently more successful in establishing native grasses.
Both drilling and broadcasting use particular seed
mixes, which may differ from the seed rain in natural
prairie. This could be overcome by scattering locally
collected native hay on restorations (Bakker et al.
1997). Native hay might also contain other important
ecosystem components such as insects and microbes.
We therefore examined the effectiveness of scattered
native hay as a seed source.
One of the species most commonly used for resto-
ration is the C3 tussock grass Agropyron cristatum, na-
tive to Russia but planted on 6–10 3 106 ha of the
Great Plains (Lesica and DeLuca 1996) and on ;7.5
3 106 ha of the US intermontane west during 1985–
1987 (Pyke 1990). Compared with similarly aged ﬁelds
dominated by native prairie species, A. cristatum stands
are characterized by low plant diversity and soils that
are low in moisture, carbon, and nitrogen (Christian
and Wilson 1999). Introduced grasses have also altered
diversity and ecosystem function in Hawaii (D’Antonio
and Vitousek 1992) and the intermontane west (Mack
and Pyke 1984). Returning A. cristatum stands to native
vegetation could increase diversity and belowground
carbon storage, and extend the grazing season by pro-
viding a mix of cool- and warm-season grasses.
Introduced grasses such as A. cristatum preempt na-
tive grass establishment and have been cited as the
greatest obstacle to restoration (Duebbert et al. 1981,
Jordan 1988, Roundy and Call 1988, Wilson and Gerry
1995). Tilling, burning, grazing, and herbicide appli-
cation all reduce the cover of alien perennials, but re-
growth from meristems and seed banks is prompt (Grilz
and Romo 1995, Masters et al. 1996, Wilson 2002).
For example, early spring herbicide application in our
study area decreased A. cristatum cover by only 50%
by the end of the growing season (Bakker et al. 1997)
and four years of herbicide application had no signif-
icant effect on the size of the seed bank of A. cristatum
(Ambrose and Wilson 2003). Thus another of our goals
was to determine whether the application of herbicide
to A. cristatum in restorations provided consistent con-
trol.
Mulch has the potential to increase soil moisture
(Ringe and Graves 1987) and reduce nutrient levels by
immobilizing nutrients. Decreased nutrient availability
can favor native species over introduced species in
competition (Wedin and Tilman 1993), but mulch did
not promote native plant establishment in Saskatche-
wan (Wilson and Gerry 1995) or Colorado (Morghan
and Seastedt 1999). Because reports of the effects of
mulch are contradictory, we included mulch as a factor
in our design.
Our ﬁrst goal was to compare the drilling and broad-
casting of seed, and the scattering of native hay, on the
establishment and survival of native grasses in ﬁelds
dominated by an introduced species. A second goal was
to examine the impact of controlling non-native species
and applying mulch on restoration success. Our third
goal was to examine the contingency of restoration
strategies in a semiarid environment by repeating the
experiments at two sites in each of three years.

two sites were not replicated examples of valley and
tableland habitats but they allowed us to explore the
extent to which restoration success depended on lo-
cation, in the same way that repeating the experiment
over three years allowed assessment of contingency
over time. The valley site (508399 N, 1078599 W) is on
the ﬂoodplain of the South Saskatchewan River, in Sas-
katchewan Landing Provincial Park, ;70 km north of
Swift Current, Saskatchewan (Canada). The site was
cultivated before being sown with Agropyron cristatum
in 1948. The tableland site (498229 N, 1078539 W) is
above the Frenchman River in Grasslands National
Park, ;130 km south of Swift Current, and was cul-
tivated until Agropyron cristatum was sown in 1951.
Both sites have brown Chernozemic clay loam soils
(Anonymous 1992). The natural vegetation of the re-
gion is mixed-grass prairie dominated by blue grama
(Bouteloua gracilis), needle-and-thread grass (Stipa
comata), and spikemoss (Selaginella densa [Christian
and Wilson 1999]). Previous work at these sites has
described ﬁrst-year seeding success (Bakker et al.
1997), ecosystem-level impacts of A. cristatum (Chris-
tian and Wilson 1999), and seed banks (Ambrose and
Wilson 2003).
Long-term weather data from the nearest meteoro-
logical stations (valley: Pennant, 40 km southwest; ta-
bleland: Val Marie, 15 km northwest; Environment
Canada, unpublished data) showed that precipitation
was similar between sites (valley: 356 mm; tableland:
313 mm) with almost half of annual precipitation fall-
ing during May–July. Mean monthly temperatures at
both sites range from 2138C in January to 198C in
July. During the study (1994–1997) data were not
available from Pennant so we used data from Stewart
Valley, 35 km southeast of the valley site. Data during
1984–1993 for Stewart Valley and Pennant were close-
ly correlated (precipitation: r2 5 0.85; temperature: r2
5 0.97).
During our study, the mean May–July temperature
for the valley site was signiﬁcantly (P , 0.05, t test)
different from the 30-yr mean (15.48C) only in 1996
(14.68C). Total precipitation during May–July was sig-
niﬁcantly different from the 30-yr mean (162 mm) each
year (185, 202, 221, 139 mm in 1994–1997, respec-
tively). For the tableland, temperature was signiﬁcantly
higher than the 30-yr mean (15.08C) in 1994 (15.88C),
and 1997 (16.08C). Total precipitation was signiﬁcantly
different from the 30-yr mean (149 mm) in 1995, 1996,
and 1997 (212, 128, and 78 mm, respectively).
Experimental design
We established 120 plots (each 3 3 10 m, separated
by 1 m corridors) in the valley and 240 plots on the
tableland. One-third of the plots were randomly as-
signed to each of three seeding years (1994, 1995,
1996) to examine the effect of seeding year on resto-
ration success. Plots were sampled for dependent var-
iables during the year they were seeded and annually
thereafter until 1997.
At each site the experiment had a complete factorial
design with seeding method (none, broadcast, drilled,
native hay) and herbicide (applied or not) as main fac-
tors, for a total of eight treatment combinations in each
of three years. In the valley, each treatment combina-
tion was randomly assigned to each of 5 replicate plots
each year. On the tableland, each treatment combina-
tion was randomly assigned to each of 10 replicate plots
in 1995 and 1996. In 1994 on the tableland, there were
5 replicates of each treatment, and another 5 replicates
of each treatment combination were assigned to an ad-
ditional treatment (mulch).
Seeding times (late May), rates, and mixes (Table 1)
were identical for broadcast and drilled plots. The seed
mix was dominated by Bouteloua gracilis because it is
the dominant native grass in the area (Christian and
Wilson 1999), seed was available, and it would poten-
tially provide ranchers with a warm-season grass com-
plementary to the cool-season Agropyron cristatum.
Other species varied in abundance according to the
availability of seed (Table 1). Forbs were not added
because seed was unavailable and because they are a
small component of the natural vegetation (Christian
and Wilson 1999).
We drilled seed 1 cm deep in rows 30 cm apart. Plots
broadcast with seed were lightly tilled immediately be-
fore broadcasting. We tilled evenly across each plot
using a walk-behind (1994) or tractor-mounted tiller
(1995–1996). Tilling was shallow (5 cm), just enough
to allow broadcasted seed to contact soil instead of

litter. Seed was broadcast by hand evenly across each
plot.
We collected native hay from undisturbed prairie
within a few kilometers of each site using a rear-bag-
ging lawn mower and applied it at 200 g/m2, an amount
similar to average standing crop. Hay gathered in Au-
gust 1994 was immediately scattered on plots desig-
nated to be seeded in 1995, and hay gathered in August
1995 was immediately scattered on plots designated to
be seeded in 1996. This allowed seed stratiﬁcation in
situ and allowed snow melt to bring the hay into contact
with the soil, ensuring that seeds in the hay would be
in place for germination in the appropriate year. Native
hay was unavailable in 1994, the ﬁrst year of the ex-
periment, so we scattered seed cleanings at 180 g/m2
in July 1994. Cleanings comprised material remaining
after native hay was commercially processed to remove
awns from seeds of Stipa comata in order to produce
seed that would pass through a seed drill. Cleanings
were expected to be rich in seeds because the hay was
collected from an area with high seed production and
because awn removal is difﬁcult and inefﬁcient. Seeds
in the cleanings could not germinate until fall 1994 at
the earliest, and therefore establishment and survivor-
ship in this treatment could not be compared with the
broadcast and drilled treatments.
Plots receiving herbicide were treated each year
starting in the year they were seeded. In 1994 we
sprayed herbicide (glyphosate, N [(phosphonomethyl)-
glycine]) in early May (1.1 kg active ingredient/ha).
At this time the C3 A. cristatum had begun to grow but
C4 native plants were still dormant, allowing the her-
bicide to selectively kill A. cristatum. Initial results
indicated that this method decreased A. cristatum cover
by only ;50% (Bakker et al. 1997), so in subsequent
years we applied herbicide later in the growing season
using a tractor-mounted wick applicator. The wick trav-
eled ;10 cm above the ground and applied herbicide
(1:2 mix of glyphosate and water) to the relatively tall
A. cristatum but not to the shorter native species. Her-
bicide was sprayed in May 1994 and applied by wick
in May, June, and September 1995, May and June 1996,
and May 1997. The number of applications varied
among years according to the perceived amount of re-
growth following the previous application.
Mulch was an additional factor on the tableland,
where it was applied as a complete additional main
effect in the 1994 seeding year, and as a split-plot factor
in the 1996 seeding year. In May 1994 we spread 200
g/m2 of shredded ﬂax and wheat straw (1:16 mix). In
May 1995 we spread an additional 400 g/m2 of shred-
ded wheat straw over 2 3 2 m subplots within the plots
mulched in 1994. Following the second mulch appli-
cation all subsequent measurements of dependent var-
iables were taken from within the subplots. In May
1996 we applied 1 kg/m2 of sawdust to 3 3 5 m subplots
in plots broadcast with seed and treated with herbicide
starting in 1996. Sawdust was spread prior to tilling
and broadcasting. We increased the quantity and C:N
ratio (higher for sawdust than hay) of mulch over time
because initial results showed little effect.
In each of the three years in which seeds were sown
we counted seedlings in late June to determine estab-
lishment and in August of the same year to determine
survivorship (percentage change in density between
June and August). Seedlings were counted within tran-
sects (3 m long) running across plots. Transect numbers
and widths varied with seedling density, between three
20 cm wide transects in cases where seedlings were
sparse, and ﬁve 5 cm wide transects where seedlings
were abundant. Long-term dynamics of seedlings in
tableland plots seeded in 1994 were followed by sam-
pling in June and August each year until 1997.
We measured species composition annually in Au-
gust in three quadrats (0.5 3 1 m) along the diagonal
of each plot. We determined the proportion of each
quadrat occupied by each species using Daubenmire’s
(1959) scale, with the use of an additional class (0–
1%). The total cover of lichens was also noted. We
calculated species richness and the total cover of native
species (including lichens) for each quadrat, and means
were determined for each plot.
We measured standing crop annually in August in
three quadrats (0.1 3 1 m) arrayed along the diagonal
of each plot. Samples from each plot were pooled and
frozen until drying and weighing. Root mass was sam-
pled annually in two soil cores (2 cm diameter, 10 cm
deep) per quadrat. Root samples from each plot were
pooled and frozen until washing, drying, and weighing.
We sampled soil moisture and available N (sum of
ammonium and nitrate) annually in May and August.
In each plot ﬁve soil cores (2 cm diameter, 10 cm depth,
one from each corner and one from the center) were
taken and pooled. Gravimetric soil moisture was cal-
culated by weighing a subsample, drying it to constant
mass, and reweighing it. Soil moisture was calculated
as a percentage of wet mass. We extracted available N
using a 0.02 mol/L KCl solution. The KCl solution was
then decanted and frozen until analysis with an ion-
selective electrode (Orion, Boston, Massachusetts).
Proportional data were square-root or arcsine square-
root transformed prior to analysis and other data were
log-transformed to reduce heteroscedasticity and im-
prove normality. For each site in each year we per-
formed a two-way ANOVA with seeding method and
herbicide as main effects. Site was not included as a
factor in ANOVA because the habitats were not rep-
licated. For analysis of establishment and survivorship
we included only two seeding methods (broadcast and
drilling) in ANOVAs because plots that were unseeded
controls or received native hay produced almost no
seedlings, and plots receiving cleanings were sown lat-
er.
Plots on the tableland seeded in 1994 had a third
treatment, straw mulch, included as a main effect. Saw-
dust mulch was applied in 1996 to subplots in plots

that were broadcast-seeded and treated with herbicide;
we tested the effect of sawdust by comparing mulched
and unmulched subplots in the same plots using one-
way ANOVA. Statistical analyses were conducted us-
ing JMP (version 3.0.2; SAS Institute, Cary, North Car-
olina, USA) and NCSS (version 6.0.22; Kaysville,
Utah, USA) software.
Results for establishment are from June of the seed-
ing year, and results for survivorship are from August
of the seeding year. Results for other variables (species
covers and richness, standing crop, soil moisture, avail-
able nitrogen) are reported from the end of the second
growing season after seeding as this was the longest
time span common to all three seeding years.
Relationships between selected response variables
(establishment, survivorship, A. cristatum cover, spe-
cies richness) and weather (precipitation and temper-
ature during the growing season) were examined using
simple and multiple regression.
RESULTS
Establishment and survivorship: overview
Seedlings of every sown species were found but we
considered all species together because almost all seed-
lings were Bouteloua gracilis (e.g., 99% in 1994). In
general, seedlings of native species were found only
in plots supplied with seeds: the maximum density of
native seedlings in plots not supplied with seeds was
,1 seedling/m2.
Establishment (seedling density 1 mo after sowing)
varied greatly between sites and among years. Estab-
lishment varied nearly threefold between sites (valley:
85 seedlings/m2, tableland: 239 seedlings/m2, averaged
across years and treatments) and fourfold among years
(1994: 228 seedlings/m2, 1996: 56 seedlings/m2, av-
eraged across sites and treatments). Further, the rank
order of years in terms of suitability for germination
differed between sites (Fig. 1: valley 1995 . 1996 .
1994; tableland 1994 . 1995 . 1996). Thus estab-
lishment was highly contingent upon location and year.
Survivorship (from June to August of the ﬁrst year)
varied greatly among years. Average survivorship var-
ied threefold between years in the valley (1994: 34.1%,
1995: 103.7%, 1996: 64.0%) and eightfold between
years on the tableland (1994: 10.3%, 1995: 79.0%,
1996: 22.7%). Values .100% reﬂect a net gain in seed-
lings between June and August. Survivorship at both
sites was highest in 1995 and lowest in 1994.
Mulch had no effect on establishment or survivor-
ship in any site or year (Table 2).

Notes: All statistics are from ANOVAs within each combination of site (valley, tableland)
and seeding year (1994, 1995, 1996). Signiﬁcant F values are underlined. Herbicide (applied
or not) and seeding method (broadcast or drilled) were main factors in all sites and years.
Mulch (applied or not) was a main factor in tableland plots seeded in 1994. Mulch effects in
tableland plots that received herbicide and were broadcast seeded in 1996 were examined with
one-way ANOVA. Two other seeding methods (none and native hay) had low seedling densities
and were omitted from the analysis. Seedling densities were log-transformed, and survivorship
percentages were square-root transformed prior to analysis of survivorship.

drilling in 1996 (Fig. 1, Table 2).
In addition to differences between broadcast and dril-

tablishment than drilling in the valley but signiﬁcantly
higher establishment on the tableland (Fig. 1).
Survivorship was signiﬁcantly higher in broadcast
than drilled plots in two of three years in the valley
and in all years on the tableland (Fig. 1, Table 2).
Averaged across sites, years, and other treatments,
mean survivorship was 86.6% in broadcast plots and
29.8% in drilled plots.
Establishment and survivorship: herbicide
In contrast to the results comparing broadcasting and
drilling, which were contingent on years and sites, her-
bicide generally had consistently positive effects on
establishment (Fig. 2), although the increase was sig-
niﬁcant in the valley only in plots seeded in 1994 and
on the tableland in plots seeded in 1995 and 1996 (Table
2).
Herbicide signiﬁcantly increased survivorship in one
year in the valley (1994) and two years on the tableland
(1994 and 1995; Fig. 2, Table 2). Similar but nonsig-
niﬁcant results were obtained from both sites in plots
seeded in 1996. In contrast, continuing establishment
in July and August resulted in signiﬁcantly higher sur-
vivorship (;150%) in plots without herbicide in one
case (valley plots seeded in 1995, Fig. 2). Averaged
across sites, years, and other treatments, mean survi-
vorship was 61.5% in plots receiving herbicide and
51.0% in control plots.
Signiﬁcant statistical interactions between herbicide
and seeding method occurred in two cases (Table 2):
establishment on the tableland in 1996 (because her-
bicide had little effect in broadcast plots but increased
establishment ﬁvefold in drilled plots; data not shown),
and survivorship in the valley in 1995 (because re-
cruitment over the summer in plots without herbicide
was much higher in drilled than broadcast plots). In
spite of these exceptions, the effects of seeding method
and herbicide were generally direct and without inter-
actions.
Establishment and survivorship: weather

ed with herbicide increased signiﬁcantly with June pre-
cipitation and decreased signiﬁcantly with June tem-

drilled and treated with herbicide did not vary signif-
icantly with any aspect of weather examined.
Survivorship in plots that were broadcast and treated
with herbicide increased signiﬁcantly with July pre-
cipitation (Fig. 3; survivorship 5 1.64(July precipita-
tion) 1 21.05; r2 5 0.69). Prediction was improved by
including the negative effect of June precipitation in a
multiple regression (survivorship 5 21.14(June pre-
cipitation) 1 1.82(July precipitation) 1 113.16; r2 5
0.87). Survivorship in plots that were drilled and treat-
ed with herbicide increased signiﬁcantly with total pre-
cipitation in June and July (r2 5 0.79).
Seed cleanings and hay
Seed cleanings were very successful. In the valley,
native seedling density after 4 yr was signiﬁcantly
higher in plots receiving seed cleanings (14 seedlings/
m2) than in those broadcast (,1 seedling/m2) or drilled
(1 seedling/m2, F2,12 5 21.40, P , 0.001, data for plots
established in 1994 and treated with herbicide). On the
tableland, native seedling density after 4 yr was sig-
niﬁcantly higher in plots that received cleanings (41
seedlings/m2) or were broadcast with seed (31 seed-
lings/m2) than those which were drilled (11 seedlings/
m2; F2,27 5 9.05, P , 0.001). Because of the species
composition of the added seeds, the dominants of plots
supplied with cleanings (Koeleria cristata, Stipa co-
mata) were different from that in broadcast or drilled
plots (Bouteloua gracilis).
In contrast to the success of cleanings, scattering
native hay produced almost no seedlings at either site
in any year (range: 0–2 seedlings/m2 in sprayed plots).
Species composition and richness
Agropyron cristatum accounted for 79% of vascular
plant cover in control plots in the valley and 95% on
the tableland, averaged across all years.
The cover of A. cristatum was signiﬁcantly reduced
by two seasons of herbicide application in the valley
for plots sown in 1994 and 1995, and on the tableland
in all years (Fig. 4, Table 3). The effect of seeding on
A. cristatum cover was nonsigniﬁcant in two cases,
signiﬁcantly positive in two others, and signiﬁcantly
negative in two others (Fig. 5, Table 3).
The cover of A. cristatum in control plots increased
signiﬁcantly with early summer precipitation (sum of
precipitation during May–July, Fig. 3b; cover 5
0.172(precipitation) 1 12.14; r2 5 0.74) and decreased
with increasing June temperature (Fig. 3c; cover 5
29.131(temperature) 1 188.643; r2 5 0.30). Prediction
was improved by including both precipitation and tem-
perature in a multiple regression (cover 5 0.158(pre-
cipitation) 26.449(temperature) 1 119.046; r2 5 0.91).
In the valley, the total cover of native plants and
species richness were both increased by two seasons
of herbicide application but signiﬁcantly so only in two
years (Fig. 4, Table 3). On the tableland, native plant
cover and species richness were signiﬁcantly increased
by herbicide in all years (Fig. 4, Table 3). Species rich-
ness in control plots increased signiﬁcantly with June
temperature (Fig. 3d; richness 5 0.811(temperature) 2
10.782; r2 5 0.90).
The cover of native species in the valley was un-
affected by seeding, but on the tableland native species
cover was signiﬁcantly decreased in broadcast plots in

trast, was signiﬁcantly increased by seeding in most
cases (Fig. 5, Table 3).
Neither straw or sawdust mulch had any effect on
the cover of Agropyron cristatum (Table 3). Straw
mulch applied on the tableland in 1994 (Table 3) sig-
niﬁcantly reduced the cover of native species (control:
28.3%; mulched: 12.0%) and species richness (control:
5.07 species; mulched: 4.43 species).
Biomass, soil moisture and available N
Standing crop was signiﬁcantly reduced by two sea-
sons of herbicide application in every case (Fig. 6,
Table 4). Standing crop did not vary with any aspect
of weather examined. Root mass was unaffected by
herbicide (data not shown). Neither standing crop (Ta-
ble 4) nor root mass were signiﬁcantly affected by
mulch.

Notes: All statistics are from ANOVAs within each combination of site (valley, tableland) and seeding year (1994, 1995,
1996). Signiﬁcant F values are underlined. Herbicide (applied or not) and seeding method (unseeded, broadcast, drilled)
were main factors in all sites and years. Mulch (applied or not) was a main factor in tableland plots seeded in 1994. Mulch
effects in tableland plots that received herbicide and were broadcast seeded in 1996 were examined with one-way ANOVA.
Cover data were arcsine square-root transformed, and species richness data were log-transformed prior to analysis.
† All sums of squares (SS) have been multiplied by 10 for presentation.
Soil moisture was increased by two seasons of her-
bicide application in the valley but signiﬁcantly so
only for plots sown in 1995 (Fig. 6, Table 4). Her-
bicide signiﬁcantly increased soil moisture on table-
land plots sown in 1994 but had no effect in other
years (Fig. 6, Table 4). Straw mulch applied in 1994
produced a small but signiﬁcant increase in soil mois-
ture after two growing seasons (control: 9.6%; mulch:
10.9%; Table 4).
Soil available nitrogen was signiﬁcantly increased
by two seasons of herbicide application in valley plots
sown in 1994 and in tableland plots sown in 1994 and

Long-term trends in seedling density
and Agropyron cristatum
We examined four years of data in the case where
they were available (tableland plots planted in 1994).
Seedling density stopped decreasing in the last two
years of the experiment in both broadcast and drilled
plots (Fig. 7) suggesting that density had stabilized. A.
cristatum cover was reduced by herbicide application
in each year, but its cover in herbicide-treated plots
varied among years and showed no sign of decreasing
over time (Fig. 7).
DISCUSSION
Our results show that some aspects of semiarid grass-
land restoration, such as establishment and the relative
beneﬁts of broadcasting and drilling, are contingent on

weather and location, whereas others, such as reducing
competition from A. cristatum, are consistent regard-
less of environmental variation.
Our design allowed us to examine six combinations
of years and sites (three years 3 two sites, Fig. 1).
Establishment was by far the response that varied most
among years and sites and appeared to be most con-
tingent on local conditions. This suggests that the fac-
tors that inﬂuence establishment vary over relatively
small temporal and spatial scales. Precipitation in this
region typically falls from small thunderstorms (Am-
brose and Wilson 2003). Small-scale variation in pre-
cipitation and soil water-holding capacity (Epstein et
al. 1997) may be most important in determining estab-
lishment (Lauenroth et al. 1994), and they are beyond
the control of restoration managers. Among-year var-
iation in establishment might be addressed by spread-
ing seeding over a number of years or by attempting
restorations in years when autumn rain or deep snow
are likely to provide water. The seasonality of precip-
itation also needs consideration. Multiple regression
showed that June rainfall increased establishment but
decreased survivorship. This probably resulted because

Notes: All statistics are from ANOVAs within each combination of site (valley, tableland) and seeding year (1994, 1995,
1996). Signiﬁcant F values are underlined. Herbicide (applied or not) and seeding method (unseeded, broadcast, drilled)
were main factors in all sites and years. Mulch (applied or not) was a main factor in tableland plots seeded in 1994. Mulch
effects in tableland plots that received herbicide and were broadcast seeded in 1996 were examined with one-way ANOVA.
The native hay seeding method was omitted from the analyses. Standing crop and available nitrogen data were log-transformed,
and soil moisture data were arcsine square-root transformed prior to analysis.

itation increased competition-induced mortality over
the course of the summer, or because the cover of Ag-
ropyron cristatum increased signiﬁcantly with June
precipitation (Fig. 3a), which also might have increased
competition. In any case, seeding may be most effective
if its timing is chosen based on weather-related op-
portunities (Westoby et al. 1989).
The relative efﬁcacy of broadcasting and drilling was
contingent on year and site. In three cases there were

casting on establishment (Fig. 1). Broadcasting pro-
duced higher establishment on the tableland in 1994
and drilling produced higher establishment in two cas-
es, the valley in 1994 and on the tableland in 1996.
This unpredictable variability in establishment reﬂects
a survey of the prairie restoration literature: drilling
was more effective in some cases, and broadcasting in
others, with no differences in others (Wilson 2002).
In contrast, survivorship in broadcast plots was
greater than in drilled plots in every case (Fig. 1) as
well as over the long term (Fig. 7). This was presum-
ably because of relatively intense competition among
seedlings in drilled rows and because of reduced com-
petition from Selaginella densa, the second most com-
mon species in Agropyron cristatum ﬁelds (Christian
and Wilson 1999), in plots tilled before broadcasting.
Because drilling results in lines that persist for decades
(Bleak et al. 1965, Looman and Heinrichs 1973), it
produces patterns of heterogeneity different from those
in native prairie (Hook et al. 1991, Kleb and Wilson
1997) and should be avoided if the goal is to produce
communities with both the appearance and function of
native prairie (Allen 1988).
Drilling and broadcasting had no effect on the total
cover of native species in the valley, but broadcasting
in the tableland decreased native cover in two years
(Fig. 5). This probably occurred because cryptogams
such as Selaginella densa contributed ,1% of native
cover in the relatively mesic valley, but 60–70% on
the xeric tableland, and cryptogams are sensitive to
even small amounts of tilling (Wilson and Tilman
2002). Broadcast plots were lightly tilled to ensure that
seed contacted soil. Given the ubiquity of cryptogams
in once-tilled A. cristatum stands (Christian and Wilson
1999), they are expected to recover over the long term.
Seed addition generally increased species richness, es-
pecially in broadcast plots (Fig. 5). This was probably
attributable to the addition of the sown species (Table
1) as well as to opportunistic invasion of bare soil by
native composites such as Antennaria neglecta and Ra-
tibida columnifera.
Seed addition was essential for establishing native
grasses: almost no native grasses were found in un-
seeded plots. Another study in our 1994 tableland plots
found a single seedling of the native grass Bouteloua
gracilis in 1997, even though water was added to sim-
ulate the wettest of the previous 30 yr (Ambrose and
Wilson 2003). Very low rates of dispersal of native
seed from surrounding native prairie is typical of semi-
arid grasslands (Cofﬁn et al. 1996, Wilson 2002).
Native hay produced almost no seedlings, suggesting
that selective seed collection by combining or picking
in years and locations with high seed production is
required to obtain sufﬁcient quantities of seed. Our
most successful establishment resulted from scattering
seed cleanings, which produced seedling densities that
exceeded those of our relatively high seeding rates.
Cleanings were produced when awns of Stipa comata
were removed from native hay in order to allow seeds
to pass through a seed drill. This native hay was pre-
sumably collected from an area with high seed pro-
duction. In contrast, spreading native hay collected at
the study site each year regardless of seed production
produced almost no establishment. Seed production in
our region varies greatly among years (Clark 1997). C3
species such as Koeleria cristata and Stipa comata
dominated plots on which cleanings were scattered in
contrast to the lack of C3 species in plots drilled or
broadcast, suggesting that C3 species can establish if
sown in sufﬁciently high density. Our results suggest
that cleanings are a valuable resource for hand-broad-
casting on restorations.
We used relatively high seeding rates for broad-
casting and drilling (;4000 seeds/m2) in order to ex-
plore the effects of other restoration practices on es-
tablishment and survivorship. This exceeds recom-
mended rates (e.g., 30 seeds/m2 [Duebbert et al. 1981])
and high experimental rates (e.g., 1450 seeds/m2 [Betz
1986]), but is close to the range for seed density in

CONTINGENCY IN GRASSLAND RESTORATION
native prairie (1000–3000 seeds/m2 [Iverson and Wali
1982, Grilz et al. 1994]). Excessively high seeding rates
may waste seed but might also contribute to the control
of unwanted introduced species (Wilson 2002). Opti-
mum seeding rates have not been determined for native
species as they have been for introduced species (Pyke
and Archer 1991).
Our seed mix was dominated by Bouteloua gracilis
and it is likely that different mixes would produce dif-
ferent results. We used B. gracilis because it is a C4
grass that increases in abundance with hot, dry con-
ditions (Weaver 1950) and was likely to be relatively
successful in dry years. Mixes dominated by other na-
tive grasses, mostly C3 in this region, might not be as
successful. In spite of their inclusion in the seed mix
(Table 1), almost no C3 grasses emerged. We did not
include forbs because of their rarity in our vegetation
(Christian and Wilson 1999) but a complete restoration
should include them.
Mulch had no signiﬁcant effects on establishment or
survivorship, or the cover of A. cristatum (Tables 2 and
3). Straw mulch applied to tableland plots in 1994 sig-
niﬁcantly reduced both species richness and the total
cover of native species (Table 3). This probably re-
sulted from straw covering the major cryptogam, Se-
laginella densa: the total cover of native vascular plants
was unaffected by mulch (control: 8.4%; mulched:
10.5%). Soil resources, however, were slightly higher
in mulched plots. Increased N availability in mulched
plots (Table 4) ran counter to expectations (Wilson and
Gerry 1995, Morghan and Seastedt 1999) and might
be attributable to mulch increasing soil moisture. These
small improvements need to be weighed against the
cost of applying mulch and the risk of introducing weed
seeds. The small but signiﬁcant positive effects of
mulch on soil moisture and available N may have re-
sulted from reduced evaporation and increased min-
eralization. Mulch effects have also been found to be
small in other northern grasslands (Wilson and Gerry
1995, Peltzer et al. 1998).
In contrast to the contingent and unpredictable ef-
fects of seeding method on establishment, applying
herbicide to A. cristatum stands consistently increased
native grass establishment, survivorship (Fig. 2), the
cover of native species, and species richness (Fig. 4).
Herbicide signiﬁcantly reduced standing crop in every
case (Fig. 6), which should reduce resource demand
and competition. Every herbicide-related signiﬁcant
difference in soil resource availability (water and ni-
trogen) in our study was an increase in plots treated
with herbicide (Fig. 6). Competition in grasslands is
primarily for soil resources (Wilson 1998) and in ad-
dition to its effects on establishment and survivorship
(Fig. 2), A. cristatum also decreases the growth of na-
tive grass seedlings (Bakker and Wilson 2001).
Differences in stature between the tall A. cristatum
and shorter native species allowed the application of
herbicide with a wick in 1995 and 1996 to suppress A.
cristatum and promote the cover of native species (Fig.
4). Similarly, differences in seasonal growth of the C3
A. cristatum and the mostly C4 native species allowed
the application of herbicide with a sprayer in 1994 to
have the same effect. In general, careful wicking and
spraying selectively suppresses A. cristatum and pro-
mote natives.
The only apparently negative effect of herbicide on
native species was on survivorship in the valley in 1995
(Fig. 2). In fact, however, survivorship was high
(;75%) in plots with herbicide, but establishment con-
tinued in July and August in plots without herbicide,
resulting in high (;150%) ‘‘survivorship.’’ There is no
obvious reason why neighbors promoted establishment
in one year in one location, but this result serves to
underscore the variability of native species responses.
Herbicide did not eliminate A. cristatum. After two
growing seasons of repeated application, there was still
considerable cover of A. cristatum in every case (Fig.
4). Four years of data from plots established in 1994
showed that the cover of A. cristatum in plots receiving
herbicide had stabilized at 5–10% despite annual her-
bicide application (Fig. 7). Examination of these plots
in 1997 showed that the seed bank of A. cristatum was
unaffected by herbicide application, with an average
of ;1000 seeds/m2 (Ambrose and Wilson 2003). This
may be caused by decreased intraspeciﬁc competition
resulting in higher seed production in sprayed plots (S.
D. Wilson and M. Pa¨rtel, unpublished data), as well as
rapid regrowth from the few meristems that escape her-
bicide application. Intensive strategies may be required
to eliminate A. cristatum, such as cultivation prior to
restoration (Howe and Brown 1999, Kindscher and
Tieszen 1998).
Soil disturbance caused by seed drilling and tilling
prior to broadcasting had inconsistent effects on A. cris-
tatum (Fig. 5), possibly because response of the grass
is closely linked to weather, which varied among years
(Fig. 3). The relationship between A. cristatum cover
and weather suggests that management should focus
on controlling A. cristatum in dry years, since cover
in untreated control plots increased signiﬁcantly with
spring precipitation and decreased signiﬁcantly with
increasing June temperature. Similarly, the above-
ground net production of A. cristatum nearby increased
signiﬁcantly with May precipitation (Curtin et al.
2000). The extirpation of 17-yr-old stands of A. cris-
tatum in Utah was attributed to drought (Bleak et al.
1965). A combination of treatments, including com-
petition from native grasses, herbicide, and other fac-
tors such as intense grazing, all applied in hot dry years,
might move populations of A. cristatum in restorations
closer to extirpation. In contrast to its negative effects
on A. cristatum, increasing June temperature increased
the richness of plots receiving no herbicide (Fig. 3).
This result suggests that restoration programs can take
advantage of among-year weather variation to decrease
A. cristatum and increase natives simultaneously (Wes-

JONATHAN D. BAKKER ET AL.
Ecological Applications
Vol. 13, No. 1
toby et al. 1989). Given the great variation in grassland
precipitation (Knapp and Smith 2001), few years are
close to average, and most can be characterized as wet
or dry. Wet years are ideal for establishing native grass-
es and dry years are more suitable for A. cristatum
control.
In summary, unpredictable rainfall and large differ-
ences among years and sites suggest that restorations
in semiarid grasslands may require opportunistic ex-
ploitation of wet years for seedling establishment and
dry years for the control of non-native species. Broad-
casting is recommended over drilling because there
were no consistent differences between these methods
in their effects on establishment, because broadcasting
promoted survivorship, and because broadcasting al-
lows the formation of plant-induced heterogeneity. Al-
though A. cristatum was not extirpated, consistent her-
bicide application over the long term cut its cover in
half and doubled species richness. Other management,
such as grazing, may have similar effects.
