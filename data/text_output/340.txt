The Ecological Restoration Institute
The Ecological Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona University is
a pioneer in researching, implementing, and monitoring ecological
restoration of southwestern ponderosa pine forests. These forests
have been significantly altered over the last century, with decreased
ecological and recreational values, near-elimination of natural
low-intensity fire regimes, and greatly increased risk of large-scale
fires. The ERI is working with public agencies and other partners to
restore these forests to a more ecologically healthy condition and
trajectory—in the process helping to significantly reduce the threat
of catastrophic wildfire and its effects on human, animal, and plant
communities.
The Program in Restoration Policy at the ERI strives to connect the
ecological aspects of restoration with wider social and policy issues.
The Program conducts a variety of social science research and
outreach activities guided by the explicit assumption that ecological
restoration and ecological sustainability are intricately linked to
human community, society, and democratic processes. Please contact

Introduction______________________________________________________________
In September 2003, representatives of local collaborative forestry groups from
across the western United States joined national policy experts to explore a situ-
ation affecting many, if not most, collaborative forestry groups in the West:
Collaborative forestry groups are not achieving their land management goals
at the rate and scale they had anticipated, with the result that both agency
and non-agency collaborators are experiencing frustration and burnout.
In fact, some of the pioneering collaborative forestry groups are in danger of
disbanding. The goal of the Barriers to Collaborative Forestry workshop was to
examine national policies and other factors that may be hampering project im-
plementation and to suggest changes to help collaborative forestry groups move
forward.
Overall, workshop participants agreed that frustration and burnout in collabora-
tive forestry is a result of several important and interrelated factors. First, the an-
ticipation of unrealistic outcomes for collaborative efforts has created
expectations that have not been fulfilled. Second, inconsistent commitment,
participation, and support of collaboratives within the federal land management
agencies have made it difficult for collaborative efforts to succeed. Finally, col-
laborative group participants may lack the capacity or experience to deliver
outcomes.
Workshop process________________________________________________________
The workshop participants were a diverse group of practitioners, all with five or
more years experience in a collaborative forestry group or in national forest
policy development. The group worked as a whole to identify key barriers to
collaborative forestry and worked individually or in small groups to develop rec-
ommendations for consideration by Congress, land management agencies, and
others involved in collaborative forestry. There was no effort to prioritize or
work toward consensus on the recommendations in this document. In many
cases there was broad support for recommendations, but in other instances
there were differing or even conflicting suggestions. Hence, participation in the
workshop does not constitute an endorsement of, or agreement with, the identi-
fied recommendations. The full range of suggestions is provided to promote
and stimulate further discussion; future action will require that recommenda-
tions be refined and prioritized. More dialogue is also needed to explore areas of
disagreement and develop consistent solutions.

Key barriers to collaborative forestry____________________________________
Prior to the workshop, participants were interviewed and a list of barriers was
compiled based on participants’ own experiences with collaboration. At the be-
ginning of the workshop, the group examined these barriers as well as those
previously identified in policy analysis documents and at other workshops on
collaborative forestry issues1. Working from this common knowledge base, the
group identified the following as the most problematic issues for collaborative
groups working on forest restoration:
1. Inconsistent and unrealistic expectations of collaboration, and lack of
criteria for measuring the effectiveness of collaboration, lead to unfair
criticism of collaborative efforts, accusations of failure, and both participant
and agency burnout.
2. Government agencies’ policies, procedures, and cultures limit their ability
to engage in collaborative efforts.
3. NEPA analyses, ESA consultations, appeals, and lawsuits can delay projects
for years and stop some altogether.
4. Funding for forest restoration projects is inadequate and unreliable.
5. Newer, more flexible contracting authorities are not well understood nor
consistently used.
6. Collaborative forestry groups commonly lack funding for day-to-day
program administration, capacity building, project planning and
administration, staff time, education, and monitoring.
7. Intensive local economic development is needed to build industrial
capacity for forest restoration.
8. There is a lack of commitment to and a lack of resources for monitoring.
Since the workshop was designed to focus on policy barriers, it was a surprise
that the two issues the group felt most strongly about were neither legal nor reg-
ulatory issues, but 1) lack of agreement on appropriate expectations of collabora-
tive forestry, and 2) Forest Service culture as a significant obstacle to
collaboration. These were the issues participants most wanted to discuss, and
also the areas of greatest disagreement. All of the problems and recommenda-
tions for action are important national policy issues and warrant further
discussion.

Inconsistent and unrealistic expectations of collaboration, and lack of
criteria for measuring the effectiveness of collaboration, lead to
unfair criticism of collaborative efforts, accusations of failure, and
both participant and agency burnout.
Expectations of collaboration vary widely. Some people, including many agency
personnel, believe that collaboration is a process of collecting information,
building support for proposed actions, and public education—but not necessar-
ily using partner expertise to assist in making decisions. Others, most com-
monly non-agency partners, perceive collaboration as a shared decisionmaking
process among diverse interests. In the words of one participant, “Agencies say
‘collaboration’ but mean ‘consultation.’ Meanwhile, [collaborative group partici-
pants] expect to assist in identifying the alternatives, not just advise.”
Some agency personnel enter into collaborative partnerships expecting that col-
laboration will increase management efficiency and reduce appeals and litiga-
tion. Yet many collaborative group participants do not share this goal; instead,
they advocate for collaboration as a source of innovation and joint
problem-solving whereby people with different perspectives, experiences, and
information formulate new resource management alternatives.
There are conflicting expectations regarding the appropriate scope of collabora-
tion as well. Some strongly believe that collaboration should be project-specific,
and that collaborative groups should disband once their project has been imple-
mented. Others see collaboration as a new way of doing business that should
permeate every aspect of land management.
Finally, there are differing expectations of the roles of agency and non-agency
partners, and of collaborative groups themselves. The “agency treats
collaboratives as single interest groups, when they actually represent multiple
interests who are working together,” said one participant. Some collaborative
forestry leaders believe agency personnel should “sit at the table” as one of many
interests; others think agencies should be required to implement projects agreed
to by a collaborative group. Collaborative group participants may erroneously
assume that agency partners will relinquish significant decisionmaking author-
ity, which can lead to additional conflict and a breakdown of the process.
These differing expectations and a lack of agreed-upon outcomes and perfor-
mance measures lead to variable assessments of effectiveness, and create ten-
sions between agencies and collaborative groups.

Recommendations for both Congress and agencies______________________
1.1 Experiment with new approaches to collaborative forest restoration.
• Experiment with specific policies that affect collaborative efforts by
having agencies test new approaches for a specified time period and
monitoring their effectiveness. Monitoring should include measurement
of both desired and unintended consequences.
• Seek opportunities to implement collaboration at a landscape scale,
coupled with experimentation, adaptive management, and policy
monitoring.
• Experiment with mechanisms that allow for mutually beneficial,
binding agreements among collaborative partners, to improve
accountability from all participating partners—including partner agencies.
• Develop rules or agreements to improve partners’ participation in
the collaborative process, implementation of agreed-upon projects, and
accomplishment of desired outcomes.
• Provide legal authority for experimental mechanisms so that they can
be fully implemented and tested. Such authority should not exclude
participation of any interested stakeholder in the decisionmaking process.

Recommendations for land management agencies______________________
1.2 Increase support for collaborative forest restoration efforts.
• Formally recognize collaborative groups and partners.
• Maximize the likelihood of success by adequately funding agency
participants and collaborative processes for the duration of the
collaborative effort or project, to help promote favorable policy and
support future collaborative initiatives.
• Designate specific agency line officers and Washington Office staff to
work with collaborative groups and provide formal training in the
techniques of collaboration.
• Demonstrate good faith by seeking to implement projects as they were
agreed to among community and agency partners.
• Implement projects in a timely fashion to motivate partners to continue
working together.
Recommendations for all involved in collaborative forestry_____________
1.3 Clarify and document expectations and desired outcomes of collaborative
forestry efforts, both in general terms and within each individual collaborative
group process or initiative.
• At the outset of a project, formally identify common misconceptions and
potentially unrealistic expectations about collaboration. Address the
question, “what can the agency expect to get from this collaboration, and
what can other partners expect to get in return?”
• Facilitate communication between collaborative groups and partner
agencies to help them articulate expectations of each other and of the
collaborative process. Make expectations explicit, formalize them, and be
sure all partners understand the expectations of the entire group at the
outset of the process.
• Help community partners understand agency parameters, such as
legal constraints on the commitments an agency can make and the
competing demands they must consider.
• Help agencies understand community perspectives on constraints that
may not be legal, but rather part of agency culture or administrative
practice.
• Periodically revisit and review partner expectations of each other and of
the collaborative process.

Exploring barriers to collaborative forestry

1.4 Document and learn from successes and failures, and use the lessons
learned to develop best management practices for collaborative forest
restoration.
• Identify mechanisms and techniques for improving collaboration in
an adaptive management framework.
• Identify and enforce mechanisms to improve accountability from all
participating partners, including partner agencies. For instance, develop
rules or agreements to improve partners’ participation in the collaborative
process, implementation of agreed-upon projects, and accomplishment of
desired outcomes.
• Create and circulate a general checklist of performance measures or best
management practices for collaboration, identified from both practice and
research.
• Collect baseline monitoring data to accurately evaluate collaborative
accomplishments.
• Host annual “lessons learned” workshops among collaborative forestry
groups to celebrate and learn from innovative and successful collaborative
efforts. Publish a list of annual accomplishments for each collaborative
for wide distribution.

Government agencies policies, procedures, and cultures limit their
ability to engage in collaborative efforts.
Acceptance of collaboration varies among different land and resource manage-
ment agencies as well as among departments and individuals within the same
agency. Some policies and procedures are widely perceived to limit employees’
ability to engage in collaboration. Many agency employees see collaboration as
an inappropriate or inefficient use of their time, and in some cases agency staff-
ers are suspected of using existing procedures as an excuse to justify non-partici-
pation in collaborative partnerships. On the other hand, many agency
employees effectively collaborate despite agency cultures and policies.
Collaborative groups perceive barriers when agencies limit the discretion of
local field staffers or discourage innovation. Under these circumstances, collab-
oration is a “hard sell” to agency personnel who forsee a considerable increase in
workload for limited benefits or suspect they may lose control over the process.
The Bureau of Land Management is frequently identified as an agency that en-
courages both innovation and collaboration and that has effectively delegated
decisionmaking authority to the local level, while the Forest Service is found
less responsive to collaborative groups. Forest Service personnel are often said to
be reluctant to try out new ideas, perhaps because they do not understand the
extent of their discretion under new laws and policies or lack the resources to
acquire appropriate training and experience. Yet even within the Forest Service
specific forest supervisors, line officers, and contracting officers have been iden-
tified as exemplary collaborative partners. In both land management agencies,
personnel changes and transfers affect continuity within local collaborative
efforts, which reduces institutional memory.
Recommendations for Congress__________________________________________
2.1 Provide agencies resources that allow them to hire additional staff to partic-
ipate in collaboratives (e.g., contracting officers, line officers, NEPA experts).
Recommendations for land management agencies______________________
2.2 Give agency personnel meaningful incentives to collaborate, and support
agency personnel in their collaborative endeavors.
• Institute a national award program to recognize innovative collaborators.

Exploring barriers to collaborative forestry

• Include measures of collaboration in agency employee performance
evaluations to provide incentives for personnel to engage in collaborative
efforts. Base measures, in part, on local collaborative groups’ evaluations
of agency personnel.
• Reward project implementation and completion, not just completion of
the planning process.
• Include collaboration in the program of work for all field personnel.
2.3 Provide professional training in the techniques of collaboration to Forest
Service personnel and collaborative partners.
• Provide training in collaborative techniques to all forest- and
district-level personnel and specific regional and Washington Office
personnel involved in collaboration.
• Incorporate agency training on collaboration into the existing mandatory
training sessions that are held in each region.
• Facilitate cross-training among land management agencies so that they
can share lessons learned on working with community partners.
• Train community partners in techniques for collaborating with agencies.
2.4 Restructure Forest Service priorities and functions to improve efficiency
and increase local decisionmaking authority relative to current public participa-
tion and decisionmaking processes.
• Empower district rangers to make project decisions in a transparent and
open process, with clear information channels.
• Provide line officers incentives to remain in one location (such as the
ability to be promoted/upgraded without changing location), to reduce
the effects of employee turnover on collaborative efforts.
• Identify ways to decentralize Forest Service decisionmaking.
• Provide regional and national interest groups greater opportunity to
participate in the process, such as cooperating agency status.
• Explore the implementation of new organizational models for the Forest
Service. Begin by examining how the Bureau of Land Management
collaborates with community partners.
• Experiment with restructuring agency functions after the Incident
Command System, which is perceived as an efficient and effective
interagency response system.

National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) analyses, Endangered
Species Act (ESA) consultations, appeals, and lawsuits can delay
projects for years and stop some altogether.
Inadequate environmental assessments and environmental impact studies are
vulnerable to appeals. To reduce the likelihood of appeals, line officers often
focus their efforts on extensive data gathering, which is time-consuming and is
rarely the top priority of national forest system staff. At the same time, agencies
are suffering declining staff and budgets, with
the result that many land management units
lack staff with necessary expertise in NEPA
analysis. From the perspective of some collabo-
rative groups, more data gathering is unlikely
to reduce the likelihood of appeals.
There is a belief that appeals are, in part, a
result of a lack of collaboration throughout the
decisionmaking process, particularly in the de-
velopment of alternatives. Because of a percep-
tion that agency planners do not adequately
consider their concerns, stakeholders may feel
that the only way they can influence or other-
wise be a part of agency decisionmaking is by
appeals or litigation. However, when appeals
are used by groups—especially groups from
outside the area—who do not participate in
earlier public involvement processes (e.g.,
scoping, comment periods), the appellants are
considered to be abusing the appeals process.
Recommendations for Congress__________________________________________
3.1 Encourage agencies to expand the role of collaborative groups in NEPA
analyses by directing them to involve collaborative partners in the analysis of al-
ternatives prior to selection of a preferred alternative.
3.2 Designate a federal court, modeled after state water courts, to handle all
NEPA-related cases. Require judges and staff members to have expertise in en-
vironmental law and experience and/or academic training related to natural
resources.

Exploring barriers to collaborative forestry
11
Recommendations for land management agencies______________________
3.3 Provide (fund) adequately trained staff and resources to carry out quality
NEPA work.
3.4 Establish NEPA analyses as a high staff priority within land management
agencies.
• Create “hot-shot” NEPA review teams or fund paralegals and attorneys
with NEPA expertise to work with Interdisciplinary (ID) teams on high-
profile, complex projects.
• Establish dedicated NEPA teams for each forest or district that have as a
top priority completion of NEPA analyses.
• Dedicate individuals to work solely on NEPA analyses who cannot be
called on for fire detail or other projects. Fire assignments significantly
impede NEPA planning, which further strains collaborative partnerships
and delays project implementation.
• Require agency managers to pursue continuing education on conducting
effective NEPA analyses.

Funding for forest restoration projects is inadequate and unreliable.
A disconnect exists between agency funding for restoration projects and their
stated importance. As currently administered, forest restoration will not pay for
itself. National Fire Plan funding has been beneficial, but specific funding does
not exist for forest restoration projects, nor are resources designated for project
planning and implementation. Project implementation can also be slowed or
canceled by budget cuts and freezes, or by competing agency priorities—partic-
ularly fire suppression.
In addition, the Forest Service lacks a clear definition of measured outputs that
correlate with forest restoration. Ecosystem management and restoration are
discussed extensively, but priorities reflect target outputs, such as volume of
products, miles of road maintained, or recreation visitor-days. Using acres
treated as a measure of forest restoration is an improvement, but additional
measures are needed to reflect improvements in watersheds, wildlife, and other
important contributions to forest health. Such measures are needed to ensure
that funding designated for restoration is actually being used on restoration.
Recommendations for Congress__________________________________________
4.1 Establish a budget line-item or special fund for forest restoration efforts.
• Appropriate funding for restoration at a rate comparable to that
appropriated for fire suppression.
• Establish a trust fund from dedicated forest restoration payments paid
from stewardship contracts and timber contracts.
4.2 Adequately fund fire suppression efforts so that other high-priority forest
restoration activities are not foregone.
Recommendations for all involved in collaborative forestry_____________
4.3 Develop a widely accepted definition of forest restoration among collabora-
tive forestry groups, land management agencies, professional societies, and uni-
versity scientists that is understood by members of Congress and can be used to
secure congressional funding.

Exploring barriers to collaborative forestry
13
• Specify and describe the relationship between forest restoration and its
related activities.  Related activities may include habitat improvement
(aquatic, terrestrial, atmospheric), watershed restoration, fuels reduction,
post-fire rehabilitation, collaboration, community capacity-building
through economic development, training, education, outreach, and
public involvement.
• To build a coalition of interest groups that support forest restoration,
define restoration in a way that will appeal to political constituents in
urban centers who are concerned with water quality, forest recreation,
wildlife habitat, and other environmental priorities.

Newer, more flexible contracting authorities are not well understood
nor consistently used.
The use, interpretation, and implementation of new stewardship contracting au-
thorities vary widely from region to region and among national forest districts.
Community partners are frustrated by the lack of agreement among contracting
officers, between districts, and among local, regional, and national offices about
the appropriate use and legality of new authorities. Many contracting officers are
uncomfortable with the new authorities and are reluctant to exercise their dis-
cretion because they fear that they will be held legally responsible for unex-
pected outcomes.
In some cases, contracting officers may be unwittingly limiting capacity for res-
toration activities. For example, local collaborative groups need small-scale pro-
jects to gain experience, establish rapport among partners, and demonstrate
initial success, but contracting staff may be reluctant to implement small-scale
projects because they are more expensive to administer. Similarly, contracting
officers are often unwilling to use the multi-year contracting authority without
dedicated funding available for out-years, while contractors and financial insti-
tutions are reluctant to make large investments in new equipment or personnel
when contracts cannot be secured for five or more years.

Exploring barriers to collaborative forestry

Recommendations for both Congress and agencies______________________
5.1 Identify mechanisms to encourage contracting staff and line officers to use
their assigned discretion in using contracting authorities.
• Protect agency staff from financial and legal liability when using
contracting authorities in good faith and within assigned agency
discretion.
• Establish clear and consistent interpretation of legal discretion for
contracting officers.
Recommendations for land management agencies______________________
5.2 Provide formal guidance and training to improve understanding and con-
sistent use of contracting authorities.
• Continue to provide specialized agency training to contracting officers on
both forest restoration and the use of related contracting authorities.
• Extend training on new contracting authorities to all agency staff.
• Extend training on new contracting authorities to community partners.
• Sponsor joint regional training sessions for agency contracting officers
and community partners, to establish consistent interpretation, use, and
implementation of contracting authorities used in forest restoration.
5.3 Provide accountability within new contracting authorities by establishing
agency protocols for contracting oversight, spot checks, and monitoring. Estab-
lish a tracking system to report problems and to communicate changes.

Collaborative forestry groups commonly lack funding for day-to-day
program administration, capacity building, project planning and
administration, staff time, education, and monitoring.
It is difficult to identify consistent sources of funding for day-to-day collabora-
tive functions. Most funding is project-specific and tied to vegetation manage-
ment targets. Additional means are needed to strengthen funding for
collaboratives from both the public and private sectors.
Contract and grant dollars are also not being distributed in a timely manner.
This inhibits the ability of contractors to stay in business, which affects forest
restoration efforts and leads to a loss of trust between agencies and community
partners. The Forest Service payment system, in particular, is lengthy and is
plagued by delay. Requests for reimbursement begin at the district level, then
must pass through the forest and/or regional office before they are received in
the National Finance Center for final processing. Most grants are paid on a
cost-reimbursable basis, which forces non-profit organizations to borrow
money to cover interim costs.
Recommendations for Congress__________________________________________
6.1 Expand the New Mexico Collaborative Forest Resto-
ration Program (CFRP), which provides $5 million per
year to community forestry efforts in New Mexico, to
other states interested in forest restoration.
• Institute state-by-state implementation of the CFRP,
with strong state involvement directed by the State and
Private Forestry section of the Forest Service.
• Make funds available for the full suite of restoration
activities, including fuels reduction, planning,
monitoring, collaboration, and economic development.
• Allocate funds for multiple years to ensure adequate
implementation.
6.2 Identify mechanisms for consistent funding of col-
laborative efforts.

Exploring barriers to collaborative forestry
17
• Experiment with requiring contractors to contribute a percentage of
profits received from forest restoration activities to collaborative efforts.
Provide economic safeguards for contractors. Link contributions to
harvest levels, or provide them at a constant level similar to how schools
collect payments in lieu of taxes.
• Create a trust fund with contributions from companies and agencies
performing forest restoration activities.
Recommendations for land management agencies______________________
6.3 Reform federal regulations requiring matching funds for grants.
• Explore options for expanding the range of collaborative group activities
that can be used as in-kind matches for federal grants.
• Use “challenge grants” from private foundations as a match for federal
programs.
• Establish a sliding scale for federal grant match requirements, based on
income indicators or type of service provided.
6.4 Expedite contractor payment for forest restoration work.
• Request that agency chief financial officers develop methods to
streamline the payment process and ensure timely contractor payment.
• Require agency payment immediately when it is received in the National
Finance Center (NFC), rather than 30-days payable from the point that it
ultimately reaches the NFC.
Recommendations for all involved in collaborative forestry_____________
6.5 Elicit funding from private foundations.
• Define restoration more broadly, to include issues that are important to
private foundations.
• Encourage agencies to work with foundations to coordinate funding or
develop collaborative funding programs.
• Work with community foundations to fund specific elements of forest
restoration projects.

Intensive local economic development is needed to build industrial
capacity for forest restoration.
The wood products industry in the western United States lacks the ability to
carry out large-scale restoration projects. The infrastructure to process small-di-
ameter and underutilized trees generally does not exist, or is economically infea-
sible given low product values. In many regions, the lack of a consistent timber
supply from public lands hinders contractors’ ability to invest in the necessary
equipment. There is a concern that collaborative processes do not adequately
address issues of supply or infrastructure development because they focus on
restoration projects too small in scale to make a difference to landscape prob-
lems. Some also criticize the wood products industry for being slow to adapt to
the available forest resources while continuing to seek material conducive to tra-
ditional products manufactured from larger-diameter trees.
Without significant increases in infrastructure, collaborative restoration efforts
will continue to be limited to economically marginal, small-scale projects, po-
tentially leading to additional loss of capacity and a decline in collaborative
efforts. For restoration efforts to be effective, not only will economically viable
products be required from small-diameter trees, but investment will also be
needed to build, retain, and retool the wood products industry.
Economic development is needed for small-, medium-, and large-scale enter-
prises. Small enterprises are important for their ability to capitalize on
value-added opportunities for niche markets and provide direct community
links. Medium-scale enterprises are needed to develop approaches to
larger-scale treatments and processing activities that provide a consistent source
of jobs while maintaining clear attachments to rural communities. Larger-scale
enterprises are needed for large-scale treatments across the landscape.
Finally, the requirements and timing of some contracts make projects economi-
cally untenable. There is a general lack of understanding of both how national
and international markets influence the development of value-added products
and how the timing and specifications of contracts influences investor
profitability.
Recommendations for Congress__________________________________________
7.1 Implement mechanisms to increase investment in and support for small
business development.

Exploring barriers to collaborative forestry
19
• Establish new Small Business Administration micro-business set-asides.
• Pursue small-scale, community-biomass-energy development as part of
emerging national renewable energy policy.
• Seek to include community-based-enterprise language in future
congressional bills.
• Create blue-ribbon committees for business development for
small-diameter wood utilization.
• Initiate a pilot program that provides competitive grants to local wood
product businesses in areas with high priority for fire hazard reduction
and forest restoration. Convene a panel of business, manufacturing, and
community-development specialists to work with selected enterprises.
7.2 Increase congressional oversight of trade practices to protect local industry
from global markets.
Recommendations for land management agencies______________________
7.3 Increase regional discretion within the agencies so that regional line officers
can offer consistent forest access and supply.
• Explore ways to provide increased assurance of forest access and supply to
facilitate financial investment, contractor capacity-building, and
economic development.
• Establish regional protocols for coordinating the timing of timber harvest
among federal and state agencies, tribes, and private landowners.
• Create amortization schedules that provide contractor safeguards for
supply commitments.
7.4 Expand the use of designation-by-description contracting, whereby con-
tracting officers describe desired end conditions and allow operators to select
appropriate equipment and techniques—with agency and community oversight.
7.5 Ask agency research stations to assess federal rural development programs
for small-diameter wood utilization and market development.
• Assess progress and accomplishments of associated rural-development
programs and establish regional investment priorities.
• Evaluate community-based, small-diameter wood utilization and
marketing enterprises and continue to facilitate technology transfer
among community groups.

There is a lack of commitment to and a lack of resources for
monitoring.
Project monitoring is necessary for a variety of reasons. Included among them
are building trust among partners, establishing accountability, increasing under-
standing of the effects of restoration actions, measuring change, supporting
adaptive management processes, and setting a course for future management
actions. There is no single approach to monitoring that can be used in every sit-
uation. Regardless of the type, monitoring can be used to make information
available to a variety of stakeholders. Types of monitoring may include:
• compliance monitoring—measures the degree to which we did
what we said we would do;
• effectiveness monitoring—assesses the degree to which actions
resulted in intended results;
• trend monitoring—discerns patterns from our actions; and
• research monitoring—isolates how certain actions influence
particular aspects of a system.
For a number of reasons, agencies and collaborative groups alike tend to make
monitoring their last priority. There is uncertainty over what to monitor and
how to measure impacts. Monitoring often requires intensive investments of
time and money in return for unknown results. Few projects or programs have
consistent funding for data collection and analysis, and most lack the staff exper-
tise or availability required to be effective. Project leaders, in particular, may fear
that the results of monitoring will affect their management strategies, expose
mistakes, or demand accountability for past actions. Finally, the amount of time
required for monitoring often does not match funding or project timelines,
which further undermines adaptive management goals.
Recommendations for both Congress and agencies______________________
8.1 Provide adequate funding to support monitoring activities.
• Establish a trust fund for project monitoring, with contributions based on
harvest receipts or provided at a constant level similar to how schools
collect payments in lieu of taxes.
• Create a budget line item for forest restoration monitoring.

Recommendations for land management agencies______________________
8.2 Make monitoring mandatory on all agency restoration projects, and provide
adequate funding to support monitoring activities.
• Require the development of a monitoring plan prior to allowing project
implementation.
• Provide agency funding for ongoing monitoring in each project.
• Seek funding from contractors and the wood products industry for
monitoring.
Recommendations for all involved in collaborative forestry_____________
8.3 Develop standardized monitoring protocols through a coordinated effort
among research institutions, agencies, industry, and non-governmental
organizations.
• Establish monitoring protocols for involving local community partners in
data collection and analyses, as directed by regional scientists and experts.
• Require a minimum standard of monitoring for all agency restoration
projects, but allow agency discretion in determining the monitoring
approach to be used (e.g., multiparty, unilateral).
• Design monitoring protocols in concert with regional interests and
expertise.
• Provide full access to monitoring information via a centralized data
system.
8.4 Provide incentives to conduct monitoring.
• Seek adequate agency funding to support research stations in reviewing,
analyzing, and publishing monitoring information.
• Identify incentives that increase communication and sharing of
monitoring information.
• Recognize and reward state-of-the-art monitoring programs and
techniques used by collaborative groups, research institutions, agencies,
industry, professional societies, and non-governmental organizations.
