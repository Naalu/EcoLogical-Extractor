ABSTRACT
Frequent, low-intensity fire is a key disturbance agent in the long-needled pine forests of western
North America, but little is known about the fire ecology of the Mexican forests which have been least
affected by fire exclusion. We compared fire disturbance history and forest structure at four unharvested
or lightly-harvested study sites differing in recent fire history. Frequent, low-intensity fires, recurring
between 4 to 5 years for all fires and 6 to 9 years for widespread fires, characterized all the sites
until the initiation of fire exclusion in the mid-twentieth century at three of the four sites. Although most
fires in the study area are ascribed to human ignitions, evidence of both lightning and human-caused
burning was observed on the study sites. A possible connection between fire occurrence and climate
was indicated by a correspondence between regional fire years and positive extremes of the Southern
Oscillation index, which is associated with cold/dry weather conditions. Forest ecosystem structures
differed in ways consistent with the thinning and fuel consuming effects of fire. Two sites with extended
fire exclusion were characterized by relatively dense stands of smaller and younger trees, high dead
woody biomass loading, and deeper forest floors. In contrast, a site which had burned following a 29-
year fire exclusion period, and the final site where frequent fires had continued up to the present, were
both relatively open forests dominated by larger trees. The recently burned sites had lower dead woody
biomass loading, especially of rotten woody fuels, and more shallow duff layers. The high regeneration
density but low overstory density at the recently burned sites is also consistent with the thinning effect
of low-intensity fire. Long-term management and conservation strategies for these forests should
recognize the historic role of fire disturbance as well as the potential for changes in fire intensity and
ecological effects following extended fire exclusion.
RESUMEN
El fuego frecuente de baja intensidad es un agente clave de disturbio en los bosques de pinos
de hojas largas del occidente de Norteamérica; sin embargo, se conoce poco de la ecología del fuego
en los bosques mexicanos que han sido menos afectados por la exclusión del fuego. Comparamos
la secuencia de disturbio causado por fuego y la estructura forestal de cuatro sitios, poco o no
explotados, que varían en su reciente historial de fuegos. Los frecuentes incendios de baja intensidad,

cada 6 a 9 años para el caso de los incendios extensos, caracterizaron todos los sitios hasta el inicio
de la exclusión de fuego a mediados del siglo XX en tres de las cuatro parcelas de estudio. Aunque
se considera que la mayoría de los incendios en el área son de origen humano, en los sitios de
referencia se observaron evidencias de igniciones causadas tanto por las descargas eléctricas, como
por el hombre. Una posible conexión entre la incidencia de los incendios y el clima quedó señalada
por la correlación encontrada entre los años con incendios regionales y los extremos positivos del
índice de oscilación meridional, asociados con condiciones de clima frío y seco. Las estructuras del
ecosistema forestal diferían de acuerdo con los efectos del aclareo de árboles y del consumo de
material combustible. Dos sitios con una larga exclusión de incendios se caracterizaron por masas
relativamente densas de árboles más pequeños y jóvenes, altas cantidades de material combustible,
y capas de humus más profundas. En contraste, tanto en la parcela que se quemó después de un
período de exclusión de fuego de 29 años, como también en el último sitio donde los incendios
frecuentes han continuado hasta el presente, se registraron bosques relativamente abiertos dominados
por árboles más grandes y maduros. Las áreas de muestreo recientemente quemadas tenían menos
material combustible, especialmente de madera podrida, y capas de humus menos profundas. La gran
cantidad de renuevos en combinación con la baja densidad del estrato superior de los sitios
recientemente quemados es también consistente con el efecto de aclareo de los incendios de poca
intensidad. Las estrategias para la conservación y el manejo a largo plazo de estos bosques deben
reconocer el papel histórico del disturbio causado por el fuego, así como el potencial de cambios en
la intensidad de los incendios y los efectos ecológicos de una larga exclusión de fuego.
INTRODUCTION
Disturbance regimes of frequent, low-intensity fires are a keystone ecological process
(sensu Holling, 1992) regulating the density, species composition, dead woody biomass,
and forest floor structure of western long-needled pine ecosystems in North America
(Weaver, 1943, 1951; Cooper, 1960; Covington et al., 1994; Arno et al., 1995; Swetnam
and Baisan, 1996). These long-needled pines (Pinus ponderosa, P. durangensis, P.
engelmannii, P. arizonica, P. jeffreyi, P. washoensis, and others) form a closely-related
ecological group in the section Ponderosae with thick bark, insulated buds, and high
capability to recover from crown scorch, all of which are considered adaptations to frequent
fire (Conkle and Critchfield, 1988; McCune, 1988; Barton, 1993). The temperate coniferous
forests of northern Mexico are the most biologically diverse of these long-needled pine
ecosystems (Bye, 1995; Felger and Wilson, 1995) and the least affected by the disruption
of frequent fire regimes (Leopold, 1937; Marshall, 1962; Fulé and Covington, 1994; Baisan
and Swetnam, 1995). However, with a few exceptions (e.g., Minnich, 1993; Baisan and
Swetnam, 1995; Minnich et al., 1995; Villanueva-Díaz and McPherson, 1995), little is known
about the role of fire or the relationship between fire and ecosystem structure in the forests
of northern Mexico.
Fire ecology studies in the coniferous forests of the southwestern United States have
shown that frequent fire played a key ecological role in these ecosystems by maintaining
open, park-like forests of fire-adapted species, controlling tree populations, limiting
accumulation of dead woody biomass and deep forest floors, cycling nutrients stored in dead
organic material, and encouraging herbaceous production (Weaver, 1951; Cooper, 1960;
Biswell, 1972; Covington and Moore, 1994; Covington et al., 1994; Swetnam and Baisan,
1996). Regimes of frequent, low-intensity fire were disrupted throughout the southwestern
United States between 1880 and, 1900, however, by heavy grazing of domestic animals,

45
logging, and fire suppression associated with Euro-American settlement of the region (e.g.,
see Cooper, 1960; Swetnam and Baisan, 1996; Covington et al., 1994). In the absence of
frequent fires, striking changes occurred: tree species less adapted to frequent fire (e.g.,
Abies, Pseudotsuga) have invaded mesic sites at the expense of other plants, and tree
biomass, both live and dead, has steadily accumulated, contributing to increasing
susceptibility to insect and disease epidemics and supporting a shift from frequent, low-
intensity surface fires to increasingly larger crown fires (Cooper, 1960; Swetnam, 1990;
Covington and Moore, 1994; Kolb et al., 1994; Swetnam and Baisan, 1996).
In contrast, the Mexican experience with fire has been quite different from that of
the United States. Deliberate agricultural burning has long been practiced by both native
and Hispanic peoples in Mexico. Despite a history of official opposition to wildfire dating
back to pre-Columbian times, effective fire suppression --the combination of laws, anti-fire
attitudes among the public and land managers, and adequate financial and infrastructure
resources needed to systematically exclude fire-- has not been achieved in much of the
country (Lumholtz, 1902; Leopold, 1937; González-Cabán and Sandberg, 1989; Rodríguez
and Sierra, 1992; Chou et al., 1993). Striking differences between the dense, fire-excluded
forests of the southwestern United States and the open, frequently burned forests of northern
Mexico were noted as early as, 1937 by Leopold and later by Marshall (1957, 1962). They
and others (González-Cabán and Sandberg, 1989; González et al., 1993; Bye, 1995; De
Bano and Ffolliott, 1995) have called repeatedly for increasing fire ecology research in
Mexico. Most recently, Minnich et al. (1995) found that coniferous forests of Sierra San Pedro
Mártir (Baja California Norte), where unmanaged fire regimes continued, remained relatively
open and dominated by pines. To our knowledge, however, the present study is the first
to examine the relationship between fire regimes and ecosystem structures in the central
Sierra Madre Occidental.1
STUDY QUESTIONS
The goal of the present study was to compare ecosystem structures at relatively
undisturbed coniferous forest sites in northern Mexico which differed in recent fire history,
ranging from extended fire exclusion to continuing frequent fires. We selected study sites
and sampling procedures to address the following questions: What are the past and present
patterns of fire occurrence on sites representing (a) extended fire exclusion, (b) fire exclusion
followed by fire return, and (c) continued frequent fire? Are fires primarily of natural or human
origin? Is there a relationship between climatic factors and fire occurrence? Have forest
density, basal area, regeneration density, and dead biomass all increased with fire exclusion,
consistent with the changes observed in long-needled pine forests of the western U.S.
following fire exclusion? Finally, what are the implications of changing fire regimes for
conservation and management of these forests?
1 Some data from two of the study sites presented here was compared by Fulé and Covington (1994)
and an abbreviated summary discussing all four sites was published by Fulé and Covington (1996).
The present study is comprehensive, containing detailed quantitative data and comparisons not
previously published.

STUDY AREA
The Sierra Madre Occidental, part of the North American cordillera linking the Rocky
Mountains with the central Mexican highlands, is an important migratory pathway and a
center of endemism (Perry, 1991; Toledo and Ordóñez, 1993). The exceptional biological
diversity of the Sierra Madre is comparable to that of tropical rainforests (Bye, 1995; Felger
and Wilson, 1995). While much of the northern Sierra Madre in Durango and Chihuahua has
remained relatively undeveloped even 400 years after Spanish colonization due to the
rugged and remote landscape, rapid increases in population, infrastructure development,
and commercial timber exploitation, are causing substantial shifts and raising international
concerns about conservation of the existing social and ecological conditions (Weaver, 1993;
Bojórquez-Tapia et al., 1995). The study area, a region approximately 2,000 km2 in size
of pine-oak forests of the Sierra Madre Occidental in northwestern Durango (Fig. 1), was
selected because the relatively recent advent of large-scale timber harvesting (circa 1970)
made it possible to find examples of unharvested forest tracts for sampling. Cooperation and
assistance from local landowner and forest management organizations facilitated the
study.
Four study sites representing apparently different recent fire regimes were chosen
within the study area for fire history and forest structure sampling (Fig. 1). Selection criteria
included no (or minimal) harvesting; evidence of past fires (such as fire scars and charred
wood); and apparent differences in recent fire history ranging from extended fire exclusion
to continuing frequent fire up to the present (evidenced by relative amount of fuels, forest
density, and relative weathering of charred wood). The first two sites, sites AV (Arroyo Verde,
lat. 25o05’ N, lon. 106o13’ W), with extended fire exclusion, and AL (Arroyo Laureles, lat.
24o57’ N, lon. 106o13’ W), with continuing frequent fire, were sampled in July and August,
1993. A preliminary comparison of these two sites showed that the initiation of fire exclusion
at AV was associated with increased forest density and fuel accumulation (Fulé and
Covington, 1994). The third site, SP (Salsipuedes, lat. 25o15’ N, lon. 106o30’ W), representing
fire exclusion followed by fire return, was sampled in April, 1994. All three sites were
unharvested pine-oak forests. The fourth site, CB (Cebadillas, lat. 24o53’ N, lon. 106o00’ W),
also with extended fire exclusion, was a mixed pine-oak-Abies-Pseudotsuga forest,
representing the mixed conifer type which is relatively rare in the Sierra Madre Occidental.
Some of the larger pines had been selectively harvested at CB approximately 15 years prior
to sampling in April, 1994. Table 1 summarizes study site characteristics.

Site AV: Scene from the northwest corner of the
Arroyo Verde (AV) study site in July, 1993. The
foreground shows a small clearing for cultivation,
made by cutting and burning a group of trees.
Similar activities appear to be the cause of some
of the recent fires at several study sites, although
lightning ignitions may have been a more
important fire source over long periods of time.
In the background is a very dense stand of small-
diameter trees, primarily Pinus lumholtzii.
Site CB: Large Psuedotsuga menziesii and Abies
durangensis trees dominate the Cebadillas (CB)
site, photographed in April, 1994. Tree density
appears to have increased following the exclusion
of fire after 1951. Selective cutting of larger pines
has enhanced the dominance of the Douglas-fir
and fir in the overstory, while permitting the
accumulation of dead woody biomass on the
forest floor. The combination of heavy fuel loads
together with continuous vertical fuels in the form
of interlinked tree crowns suggests that much of
this site will support a high-intensity canopy fire
under dry, windy conditions.

Site AL: Periodic fires continued up to the sampling date at the Arroyo Laureles (AL) site, shown in July,
1993. Although this scene shows a relatively dense pine stand, the forest floor is relatively free of undergrowth
and the lower tree boles have been pruned by repeated burning. Little dead woody biomass appears on
the forest floor. Recent fires here had intense behavior at localized points, torching individual trees and even
crowning through an area of several ha in the northwest corner of the site. However, the low average forest
density and fuel loading maintained by the frequent fire regime indicate that this site was relatively resistant
to large-scale crownfires. The AL site was selectively harvested in 1994, after our sampling.
Site SP: The effects of widespread recent fires, following 29 years of fire exclusion, are shown in this scene
of the Salsipuedes (SP) site in April, 1994. Fuel accumulation over the fire-free period led to relatively intense
fires in 1984 and 1993, damaging or killing many of the mature trees such as the pine in the center. Alders
and oaks sprouted vigorously after the 1984 fire, but many were topkilled in 1993, as shown by the dead,
small-diameter stems in the foreground. The sprouting species are resilient to these relatively intense recent
fires, however, while the conifers which reproduce from seed appear to be declining.

All four study sites were communally owned, sites AV and AL by the Ejido Salto de
Camellones, site SP by the Ejido Topia, and site CB by the Ejido Hacienditas. Adjacent
lands included both ejidos and private holdings. Most surrounding land with accessible
commercially-valuable timber had been selectively harvested at least once. Evidence of
natural resource utilization observed on the study sites, in addition to the pine harvest at
site CB, included grazing, scattered tree cutting for firewood, poles, shingles, and access
to beehives. At the three pine-oak sites, one to several clearings for illicit cultivation were
found. The clearings were small, ranging from 200 m2 to 500 m2, created by felling a patch
of trees, igniting the dried vegetation, and cultivating the plot for one or more seasons.
Clearings were deliberately located in steep, remote, forested areas; no firebreaks existed
to prevent the burns from passing into the surrounding forest.
The regional climate pattern is dry spring conditions followed by a summer rainy
season. Annual precipitation at Ojito de Camellones (elevation 2400 m) is 2200 mm (9 year
average), with 80% occurring between June and October. Other weather stations at lower
elevations average less annual precipitation: 1540 mm (11 year average) at San Miguel
del Cantil (2250 m elevation), 1150 mm (5 year average) at Topia (1800 m elevation), and
740 mm (11 year average) at San Diego de Tensaenz (1550 m elevation). Records of
temperature are less available than those of precipitation, but 1992 maximum and minimum
temperatures at La Cienega, 12 km west of Ojito de Camellones at 2500 m elevation, were
18o and -8oC in January, and 28o and 7oC in August. Soils originated from igneous rocks,
primarily rhyolitic with scattered basaltic and granitic outcrops (Guízar et al., 1992). The
topography is characterized by high-elevation mesas dissected by steep canyons.
METHODS
Field Sampling
Sampling was carried out on systematic grids designed to simultaneously measure
fire history and forest structural characteristics. The grid spacing was 150 m X 150 m at
sites AV and AL (total site size 70 ha each) and 100 m X 100 m at the smaller sites SP
and CB (30 ha each). Fig. 2 shows the sampling layouts at each study site.
Thirty sampling points were established at each study site and used as the center
points of nested sampling plots varying in size. Fire scars were sampled at the largest scale,
represented by the 150 or 100 m interplot distance. Following a search of 75 or 50 m radius
centered on each sampling point, the tree catfaces apparently containing the oldest scars
and/or the best record of multiple fires were selected for sampling (Arno and Sneck, 1977;
Swetnam and Baisan, 1996). Because of the ongoing fire regimes or recent onset of fire
exclusion at the study sites, most fire scar samples were taken as partial cross sections
cut from living trees, although samples from snags, logs, and stumps were also collected.
The geographic location of each fire scar sample was referenced (distance and bearing)
to the sample point center. Fig. 2 maps fire scar sample locations relative to the plot sampling
grid and lists sample identification numbers.
Overstory vegetation was sampled on circular plots 200 m2 in size (radius = 7.98 m)
centered on each sampling grid point. In the context of this study, all woody plants over

1.3 m in height were considered "overstory" vegetation, as contrasted with the woody
seedlings described below. Species, condition, height, live crown ratio, presence of lightning
scars, and diameter at breast height (dbh, 1.3 m above ground level) were recorded for
all live and dead trees over 1.3 m in height, as well as for stumps and dead and downed
trees which surpassed breast height while alive. Condition classes were assigned based
on a tree, snag and log classification system originally developed in ponderosa pine/mixed
conifer forests of the Blue Mountains of Oregon (Maser et al., 1979; Thomas et al., 1979)
and widely applied in ponderosa pine forests (Rogers et al., 1984; Covington and Moore,
1994a; Lundquist, 1995). Condition classes were (1) live; (2) declining; (3) recent snag; (4)
loose bark snag; (5) clean snag; (6) snag broken above dbh; (7) snag broken below dbh;
(8) downed dead tree; and (9) cut stump. Increment cores were taken at 45 cm above ground
level from all living conifers over 6 cm dbh.
Woody regeneration, defined as tree seedlings below 1.3 in height, was sampled on
nested circular plots 40 m2 in size (radius = 3.57 m). The number of woody stems on each
plot was tallied by species. Percent cover by herbaceous species was also estimated visually
on each 40 m2 plot.
Dead woody biomass and forest floor depth were sampled along a 15-m planar transect
laid out in a randomly-selected direction from the center of each sample plot (Brown, 1974).
Intercepts of the transects with woody fuels in the diameter classes 0-0.6 cm, 0.6-2.5 cm,
and 2.5-7.6 cm were tallied along the first 5 m; diameters of sound and rotten fuels larger
than 7.6 cm were measured along the entire transect. Depth of litter and duff was recorded
every 5 m.
Analysis
Dendrochronology-fire scar samples
In the laboratory, fire scar samples were surfaced, mounted on plywood backing, and
sanded with increasingly finer belts up to 400 grit abrasive. A total of 105 fire scar samples
was crossdated (Stokes and Smiley, 1968) with master tree-ring chronologies previously
developed in the region (Harlan, 1973) and others developed in the present study. Most
samples were less than 200 years old and could be crossdated visually using characteristic
patterns of narrow marker years, especially in the twentieth century: 1860, 62, 87, 1902,
04, 09, 25, 34, 43, 51, 56, 63, 71, 74. Several samples from dead trees were initially dated
as floating tree-ring width series with the COFECHA program (Grissino-Mayer and Holmes,
1993), then dating was confirmed visually on each sample. After dating, ring widths of all
samples were measured and dating was checked with COFECHA as well as by independent
visual crossdating of a 20% to 30% subset of samples by another dendrochronologist. To
measure the season of occurrence of fires (Baisan and Swetnam, 1990), the relative position
of each fire scar within the ring was recorded using the following categories: EE (early
earlywood), ME (middle earlywood), LE (late earlywood), L (latewood), and D (dormant
season, scar occurring between the cessation of latewood growth and the beginning of the
next year’s earlywood growth). The assumption that dormant season scars are generally
spring fires in the southwestern United States (Baisan and Swetnam, 1990) appeared valid
for the similar climate patterns and spring fire season of the central Sierra Madre Occidental,

Fulé & Covington: Fire Regimes and Forest Structure in the Sierra Madre Occidental
53
although the possibility of dormant scars forming in the fall following latewood growth cannot
be excluded. From the four study sites, a total of 637 fire scars were dated to the year and
season (if determinable) of origin.
Forest structure analysis
Overstory age structure was determined from ring counts of surfaced and mounted
increment core samples, using known patterns of narrow marker years to correct ring counts
by visual crossdating whenever possible. The ring counting provides a rapid age estimate
highly accurate within 10-year age classes, adequate for the purposes of this study in which
approximately 1,000 cores were collected for age determination. For cores which missed
the pith, a pith locator consisting of a transparent overlay of concentric circles was used.
An appropriate circle set was selected based on the curvature of the rings nearest the center
and the average growth rate of rings near the center. "Tree age" in the following sections
refers to total age at the 45 cm coring height.
Dead woody biomass was calculated from the planar transect intercept tallies using
the method of Sánchez and Zerecero (1983), which is analogous to the method of Brown
(1974) and is commonly applied in Mexican temperate forests. Basal area (m2/ha) and
density (number/ha) were calculated for living overstory trees, recent snags, older snags,
dead and downed trees, and stumps, and density of regeneration was also calculated.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis of the fire history data was facilitated by the capabilities of the
FHX2 fire analysis software developed by Grissino-Mayer (1995). Fire return intervals were
analyzed statistically beginning in the first year in which an adequate sample depth of
recording trees occurred at each site (Grissino-Mayer et al., 1994). The minimum sample
depth was taken to be the first fire year with three recording trees (10% or more of the
total sample size at each site). Fire return intervals were analyzed statistically in different
sub-categories. First, all fire years, even those represented by a single scar, were
considered. Then only those fire years were included in which respectively 10% or more,
and 25% or more, of the recording samples were scarred. These categories help define
"widespread" fires which may have been larger in area or more intense (Grissino-Mayer,
1995). The statistical analysis of fire return intervals includes several measures of central
tendency: the mean fire interval (average number of years between fires), the median, and
the Weibull median probability interval (WMPI). The latter statistic is a central measure in
the Weibull distribution, which is useful to model asymmetric fire interval distributions and
to express fire return intervals in probabilistic terms (Johnson, 1992; Grissino-Mayer et al.,
1994; Swetnam and Baisan, 1996). Finally, the maximum hazard fire interval (100% Hazard)
is the time in years at which the 100% probability level is reached in the Weibull distribution.
Theoretically, the hazard interval represents the maximum fire-free period possible in the
modeled distribution, and may be compared with the actual maximum fire return intervals
(see Grissino-Mayer (1995) for discussion of the properties of the Weibull distribution).
Statistical analysis of forest structure was carried out with the SYSTAT software
(Wilkinson, 1988). Alpha level for all analyses was .05. Multivariate analysis of variance

54
(Tabachnick and Fidell, 1983, p. 222-291) was used to determine differences between sites
on intercorrelated measured variables, such as the suite of dead woody biomass variables.
If a significant difference was found between sites (Wilk’s lambda statistic), then Tukey’s
honest significant difference (HSD) test (Zar, 1984, p. 186; Day and Quinn, 1989) was used
for multiple comparisons among means at the four study sites.
RESULTS
Fire Disturbance History
The fire history results confirmed that all four study sites burned frequently in the
past but periods of extended fire exclusion in the twentieth century occurred at three of the
sites, while the fourth continued to burn frequently up to the present. The fire disturbance
histories at the four study sites are summarized in the master fire charts shown in Fig. 3a-d
and compared graphically in Fig. 4. The horizontal lines in each chart represent individual
fire scar samples. The sample identification numbers at the right are the same as those
shown in the fire scar sample map (Fig. 2). The horizontal lines are dashed when the sample
is not considered a recording tree, usually before the first scar forms an open wound
susceptible to repeated scarring from subsequent fires, or during periods in which fire scars
have been burnt away completely (Grissino-Mayer, 1995; Swetnam and Baisan, 1996).
Continuous lines indicate recording periods. Short vertical bars show the years in which
each sample was scarred. Beneath the individual samples, a composite line lists all the
fire years at the site. The time span of the fire histories is relatively short (maximum 196 years)
compared to fire histories from the southwestern United States (Grissino-Mayer, 1995;
Swetnam and Baisan, 1996); this is due to a combination of the relatively short lifespan
of trees at the study sites (see age distribution below) as well as to the fact that recurring
fires up to the mid-twentieth century or to the present have consumed relict wood which
often is used to extend U.S. fire histories into the past (Baisan and Swetnam, 1990).
Dates of fire regime disruption, following the last widespread fires at sites AV, CB,
and SP were identified in the fire histories (Fig. 3a-d). Prior to fire regime disruption, all
four sites had mean fire return intervals of less than 5 years (Table 2) when all fire years
are included, and mean fire return intervals of 9 or fewer years for widespread fires (scarring
25% or more of the recording trees). The three measures of central tendency in Table 2
agreed closely when the number of fire return intervals was high (e.g., the all-scar and
10%-scarred distributions), but showed less agreement when the number of intervals was
low (e.g., the 25%-scarred distribution). Similarly, the 100% hazard value of Weibull
distribution agreed less closely with the observed maximum fire-free interval when the
number of intervals was low (e.g., the 25%-scarred distribution).
The areal extent and intensity of past fires affect the scale and nature of fire effects
on ecosystem structures, but spatial fire patterns are difficult to estimate in ecosystems
characterized by frequent, low-intensity fire where forest stand boundaries do not correspond
with fire edges (Swetnam and Dieterich, 1985; Swetnam and Baisan, 1996). A direct
relationship between the percent of fire scarring and the size or intensity of a given fire cannot
be drawn because fires are frequently not recorded even on trees with open fire scars

(Dieterich and Swetnam, 1984), but the extent of scarring is roughly related to the areal
extent of fire spread and/or intensity of burning. Furthermore, because sampling
systematically covered each study area, the grid-based fire scar sampling design (Fig. 2)
helps support spatial interpretations of fire spread since sampling covers the entire area
(see Arno et al. (1993) for a similar approach).
Spatially homogeneous fire regimes prevailed at all four sites, consistent with the
lack of topographic or vegetative barriers to fire spread on the sites and the fact that fires
could have persisted for extended periods in the absence of fire suppression activities.
Spatial homogeneity of the fire regimes was examined by dividing each area along its
shortest axis into two roughly equal sections. Fire return intervals and percentage of scarring
between the two sections of each study site for the all-scar, 10%-scar, and 25%-scar
distributions were tested for significantly different means (t-test), variances (F-test), and
distributions (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). Alpha level for all tests was .05. No consistent
pattern of significant differences between sections within study sites was found, although
a few individual test statistics were marginally significant at site AL (see discussion below).
In addition, the synchroneity of fire years in the two sections of each site was tested (chi-
square test, 2 X 2 contingency table compared observed and expected values of fire
occurrence at either or both sites). The null hypothesis of statistically independent fire
chronologies between sections was rejected for all three test distributions at all sites.
Although no spatial differences were observed at this scale of comparison, some smaller-
scale spatial patterns of fire were detected at sites AV and AL (see below).
Seasonal patterns of fire occurrence (Table 3) show that 60-77% of fires burned
in the spring and the remainder in the summer. At no site did late earlywood scars exceed
10% of the total and no latewood fires were observed. This seasonal distribution is similar
to patterns observed in Arizona (Baisan and Swetnam, 1990) and New Mexico (Allen et al.,
1995; Grissino-Mayer, 1995).
Site AV (Arroyo Verde): 47 years fire exclusion
The fire history at site AV was characterized by a disruption of the fire regime after
1945 (Fig. 3a). Although the first recorded fire occurred in 1764, the analysis period begins
with 1801, the first fire year for which three recording trees exist in the data set. A pattern
of frequent fires is seen from 1801 to 1945 (MFI for all scars = 3.79 years, Table 2), although
an unusually long fire-free interval of 12 years occurred between 1929 and 1941. Since the
1941 fire was only recorded on a single sample, the effective fire-free period comprised
the 16 years between 1929 and 1945. However, the 1945 fire burned across the entire site,
scarring 63% of the recording trees. The site has not experienced a widespread burn scarring
25% or more of recording trees in the 47 years from 1945 to the sampling date, although
fires scarring over 10% of the recording trees did burn in 1962 and 1986. A comparison
of the sample identification numbers in the master fire chart (Fig. 3a) with the fire sample
map (Fig. 2) shows that the scarred trees in 1962 and 1986 were confined to the northwest
quadrant of the study site, an area where evidence of 2-3 clearings was encountered during
sampling.2
2 A previous comparison of fire regimes at the Arroyo Verde and Arroyo Laureles sites (Fulé and
Covington, 1994) was based on fewer fire scar samples so fire interval results were slightly different.

Patterns of fire exclusion are commonly "messy": Swetnam and Baisan (1996)
compared 63 fire histories from the southwestern United States which frequently evidenced
a period of reduced fire frequency and sporadic post-disruption burns even after the regional
trend of fire exclusion had become firmly established. The identification of a fire regime
disruption at site AV is not unequivocal, as would be the case if no fire scars at all were
found after 1945. The year 1929 could also be reasonably selected as a disruption date,
because of the long fire-free interval which followed. However, the conclusion that the 1945
fire had important ecological impacts on the ecosystem, while the 1962 and 1986 fires did
not impact most of the site, is supported by the forest structure data, particularly the age
and size distributions described below.
Site CB (Cebadillas): mixed conifer site, 42 years fire exclusion
Site CB, the high-elevation site with Abies and Pseudotsuga, had clear evidence of
recent fire regime disruption, with a fire-free period of 42 years to the present following the
last widespread fire in 1951 (Fig. 3b). The only evidence of post-1951 fire is a single fire
scar in 1974. As with site AV, there is also evidence of some earlier fire-regime disruption
due to the gap of 22 years between the 1924 and 1946 fires, broken only by the 1934 fire

which scarred 13% of the recording trees. Over the analysis period 1797-1951 (Table 2),
the MFI for all fires (4.97 years) was about 60% less than the MFI for fires scarring 25%
or more of the recording trees (8.56 years). These values are only slightly higher than the
comparable pre-disruption fire return intervals at the pine-oak sites (Table 2), showing that
the mixed-conifer site CB, on a high, relatively mesic, north-facing slope, burned at nearly
the same frequency as the lower-elevation, relatively xeric sites on southwestern and
western aspects. This result contrasts with the longer fire return intervals, averaging 52
years, for mixed conifer forests of the Sierra San Pedro Mártir in Baja California Norte
(Minnich, 1993); however, this study was based on identification of fire perimeters from a
time series (1942-1991) of aerial photographs, a method that may be less likely to identify
frequent, low-intensity fires. In the southwestern United States, fire history studies based
on fire scars in mixed conifer forests have shown pre-disruption (presettlement) MFI values
for widespread fires (scarring 20% or more of recording trees) of 22 years (Dieterich, 1983),
11 years (Grissino-Mayer et al., 1995), and 9.9 years (Baisan and Swetnam, 1990). Grissino-
Mayer et al. (1995) concluded that the fire regime at a mixed-conifer site in southern Arizona
was very similar to that of lower-elevation ponderosa pine forests.
Site SP (Salsipuedes): fire exclusion and return
A pattern of recurring fire at site SP (1812-1955 MFI = 4.09 years, Table 2) was
interrupted by a 29-year period with no widespread fires after 1955 (Fig. 3c). Single recording
trees were scarred in 1963, 1980, and 1982, but widespread fire returned to site SP in 1984,
scarring 95% of the recording trees. Nine years later, in 1993, another widespread fire burned
the site. Evidence of several clearings, including one with a fence surrounding the planted
area, was observed at site SP during sampling in 1994. Since site SP is the least accessible
of the four study sites, it may have been favored in recent years for illicit cultivation, possibly
causing the 1984 and 1993 fires.
Site AL (Arroyo Laureles): frequent fire up to the present
Site AL is the only site which has burned up to the present without a clear period of
fire exclusion (Fig. 3d), providing one of the few examples of a continued frequent forest fire
regime in North America (for comparison, see Dieterich, 1983; Swetnam and Baisan, 1996).
Even at site AL, relatively long gaps of 14 years and 11 years appear between 1951-1965,
and 1969-1980, respectively. But these gaps do not exceed the pre-disruption maximum
fire-free intervals at the other three sites, suggesting that these periods remain within the
range of natural variability of undisrupted fire regimes. However, although the 1980 and 1986
fires were widespread (Fig. 3d), they did not scar trees in approximately the northwestern
third of the site. Several of the individual test statistics for spatial differences in fire regime
at site AL showed marginal statistical significance (e.g., p ≈ .03-.04), the only site where
some statistical evidence of spatial heterogeneity was observed. If this portion of the study
site did not burn between 1965 and 1991, the accumulation of fuel over 26 years may explain
the high-intensity 1991 fire behavior evidenced by tree mortality adjacent to the northern
site boundary (Fulé and Covington, 1994). Site AL was commercially logged in 1994.

Site comparison
Fire histories at the four study sites are compared graphically in Fig. 4, with twentieth-
century fire exclusion increasing in impact from the all-scar comparison (top), which shows
a minimal level of recurring fire at most sites up to the present, through the 25%-scarred
comparison (bottom), which shows the complete exclusion of widespread fire from sites AV
and CB as well as the 29-year exclusion period at site SP. The period 1955-1980 was
particularly free of widespread fire, except for the 1965 fire at site AL (Fig. 4). The regional
fire interval analysis including all sites (Table 4) for the period 1797-1993 shows that the MFI
for fire scarring at least one tree on at least one site was 2.11 years, rising to 15.40 years
for fires scarring at least three of the four sites. The ten years in which three or all four of
the sites burned are listed as major regional fire years, from 1835 to 1951, in Table 5.

Species composition
A variety of tree species was encountered on the sampling plots (Table 6). For
purposes of analysis, trees were grouped as (1) pines (family Pinaceae, including Abies
and Pseudotsuga), (2) oaks (family Fagaceae), and (3) others. Pines, oaks, and Arbutus
(madrone) were found at all four study areas; other species occurred sporadically.

Live tree structure
Live overstory trees differed significantly in density between sites in a pattern
consistent with the thinning effects of fire: sites AV and CB, with extended fire exclusion,
had the highest mean densities, up to 2733 trees/ha, while sites SP and AL, with recent
fires, had much lower mean densities (Table 7). However, basal area was not correlated

Acta Botánica Mexicana (1997), 41:43-79
66
with density: the most dense site, AL, had the lowest basal area, while there was no
statistically significant difference between basal areas at the other three sites (Table 7). Site
AV was therefore dominated by numerous small trees (quadratic mean diameter 10.4 cm)
while sites SP and AL are characterized by fewer, larger trees (quadratic mean diameters
29.0 cm and 27.1 cm respectively). Site CB falls in between (quadratic mean diameter
17.7 cm). The diameter distributions of live trees at the four sites (Fig. 5a-d) confirm these
relationships, with the fire-excluded sites AV and CB having distinct reverse-J shaped
distribution curves. Diameters at sites SP and AL, though still positively-skewed, appeared
more normally distributed. All three analysis groups (pines, oaks, and other) generally shared
the same relative patterns of diameter distribution at each site (Fig. 5a-d).

Rates of lightning scarring of live overstory trees were below 3% at all sites, even
considering only trees larger than 20 cm dbh. No lightning-scarred trees were encountered
at site CB.
Age structure of conifers over 6 cm dbh at the four sites (Fig. 6a-d) shows the
relatively young age of the trees. The oldest individual (a Pinus durangensis) dated to the
mid-1600’s and the great majority of trees were less than 100 years old. Some effects of
fire and fire exclusion are reflected in the age distributions, but the patterns are mixed. For
example, the overwhelming majority of conifers at site AV (Fig. 5a) established after the

last widespread fire in 1945, but most conifers at site CB (Fig. 5b) were already well-
established before fire exclusion began following the 1951 fire. The gap in the age distribution
at site AL (Fig. 5d) in the mid-twentieth century may be an effect of the widespread 1965
fire killing trees in the younger age classes, but no analogous gap appears in the age
distribution at site SP (Fig. 5c) after the 1984 fire. The age distributions appear more
heterogeneous at the burned sites because the proportions of younger to older trees are
much higher at the unburned sites. All four sites were actually similar in terms of the densities
of trees older than 50 years, approximately corresponding to the period of fire exclusion,
ranging from 63 trees/ha at CB to 97 trees/ha at AL (densities of conifers from which
increment cores could be sampled). By 1993, however, the tree densities increased
substantially at the unburned sites, altering the forest age structure toward greater

Acta Botánica Mexicana (1997), 41:43-79
68
dominance by younger trees. The ratio of trees under 50 years to trees over 50 years was
2.7 at AV and 1.9 at CB. The ratio of young:old trees at the burned sites, in contrast, was
0.2 at AL and 0.6 at SP.
High regeneration density at all sites (several thousand/ha), compared with the low
overstory density at the burned sites SP and AL (Table 7), is consistent with the thinning
effect of recent fires which appear to have reduced the density of trees surviving to the
overstory. At the fire-excluded sites AV and CB, dense young trees have been able to grow
into the overstory without thinning from fire. Although all tree seedlings below 1.3 m were
tallied together in this study, qualitative differences were observed between the sites.
Regeneration at the fire-excluded sites AV and CB consisted mainly of dense seedlings and
sprouts between 0.5 and 1.3 m, while regeneration at sites SP (last fire 1993) and AL (last
fire 1991) typically consisted of very small, young seedlings and sprouts. Numerous pine
seedlings at site AL were still shedding seed coats at the time of sampling in August, 1993.

Dead tree structure
Dead tree structure (snags, dead and downed trees, and stumps) is summarized in
Table 8. Density of recent snags, those with branches and bark still intact, was significantly
highest at site SP, where it was evident in the field that the return of fires in 1984 and 1993
after a 29-year fire-free period killed numerous trees. In some parts of site SP, mature oaks
or alders appeared to have been killed in 1984. The subsequent thickets of sprouts around
the snags were then killed or thinned by the 1993 fire. Older snags were more dense at
the fire-excluded sites, reflecting the combustion of older dead material by recent fires at
sites SP and AL. Stump density was generally low since three of the four sites had never
been harvested on a large scale. Pines at the fourth site, CB, had been selectively harvested
at a mean density of 13.3 trees/ha (Table 8). Although the majority of dead trees at all sites
was in smaller diameter classes (Fig. 7a-d), the densities of the smallest snags were sharply
higher at the recently burned sites SP and AL, consistent with the thinning effect of fire.

Dead woody biomass and herbaceous cover
Dead woody biomass ranged from a low of 7.1 metric tons/ha at site SP to a high
of 53.2 metric tons/ha at site CB (Table 9). The fire-excluded sites had higher dead woody
biomass loads than the recently burned sites, although only the very high loading at site
CB was statistically significantly different. The biggest difference was in rotten woody
biomass, where the fire-excluded sites had loadings several times those of the recently
burned sites. Litter depth was similar at all sites, but duff depth was significantly lower at
the recently burned sites. These characteristics, particularly the rotten woody loading and
duff depth, match the expected effects of fire in consuming these fuels. The comparable
levels of forest litter suggest that burned and unburned sites both have continuous fine fuels
which can support fire, and that even recently burned sites (site SP burned 1 year before
sampling, site AL 2 years before sampling) can quickly recover fine fuel loadings similar
to those of unburned sites. The heavy fuel loadings at the unburned sites, particularly of

Fulé & Covington: Fire Regimes and Forest Structure in the Sierra Madre Occidental
71
flammable rotten fuels, indicate that the fire-excluded sites have accumulated fuel beyond
the range normally found in burned forests, fuels which can support high-intensity fire.
Herbaceous cover was relatively low at all four sites, ranging from 10 to 20%, but tended
to be higher at the recently burned sites, as expected, given their lower overstory densities.

DISCUSSION
Patterns of Fire Occurrence
The high frequency of fire in the Sierra Madre Occidental indicates that sources of
ignition, weather patterns favorable to fire spread, and adequate contiguous fuels exist
across the region. Evidence of both lightning and human-caused ignition (clearings) was
observed directly on the study sites, except for site CB. The rates of these sources of direct
ignition were apparently relatively low compared to the high frequency of fire (less than 3%
lightning scarring of trees; one to several clearings per site), but the general absence of
natural or artificial firebreaks around the study sites would permit fires to enter from outside
the sites and cross large areas without impediment. The perennial streams forming the
downslope boundaries of sites AV and AL were narrow enough (5-10 m) for fires to spot
across readily under windy conditions. Roads came close to sites AV, CB, and AL, but they
are of recent construction (post-1970) and are also relatively narrow (≈ 3-4 m) and often
covered with fine fuels consisting of leaves and needles from the surrounding forest.

Acta Botánica Mexicana (1997), 41:43-79

 Foresters and landowners in the study area believe that most fires are human-
caused, resulting from burning of pastures and agricultural fields, clearings, campfires, and
smoking. This is a widely-held view in Mexico. Both official statistics (González-Cabán and
Sandberg, 1989; Anonymous, 1994) as well as some botanical and ecological studies of
Mexican forests (e.g., Loock, 1950; Perry, 1991; Fisher et al., 1995) reflect this attitude,
grounded in documented cases of deforestation caused by repeated agricultural burning,
primarily in the heavily-populated central Mexican states (Martínez, 1948; Perry, 1991). Prior
to Spanish colonization, indigenous inhabitants of the study area, including Acaxee, Xixime,
and Tepehuán peoples (Pennington, 1969; Gerhard, 1982), also used fire. Ethnographic
studies of the historic Tepehuán (who no longer inhabit the study area) and Rarámuri
(Tarahumara) people, who live in similar forest and canyon ecosystems within 100 km of
the study area, describe fire use for clearing agricultural fields, hunting, and warfare
(Lumholtz, 1902; Pennington, 1963, 1969). Lightning is broadly considered a minor source
of ignition both at the national level (Anonymous, 1994) and in the study area (J.G. Paredes
Pérez, Forester, personal communication, 1993) because it is generally accompanied by
heavy rain and high humidity.
However, lightning is the predominant ignition source in long-needled pine
ecosystems of the southwestern U.S. (Swetnam and Betancourt 1990, Swetnam and Baisan
1996) and the role of natural ignitions is probably very significant in maintaining frequent
fire regimes in the central Sierra Madre Occidental as well. Lightning ignitions in the study
area can smolder until favorable burning conditions return (P.Z. Fulé, personal observation,
1994). Furthermore, the human population of the study area has changed substantially since
Spanish colonization, with the indigenous population in the region of the study area falling
from an estimated 10,000 in 1,500 A.D. to 500 by 1,700 A.D. (Gerhard, 1982). Although
the Spanish city of Santiago Papasquiaro was founded in 1593 A.D. and mining exploration
in the Sierra Madre began shortly afterward, Hispanic settlement across much of the central
Sierra Madre Occidental was limited until the expansion of ejidos after the Second World
War. Considering the relatively stable pattern of pre-disruption fires found at the four study
sites in this study from approximately 1800 through the 1920’s to 1950’s, despite low and
fluctuating human populations, it seems likely that lightning has been an important ignition
source. When longer fire chronologies are developed from the Sierra Madre, more detailed
comparisons of changes in fire frequency and human presence can be carried out.
While recent human activities are probably related to the patterns of fire exclusion
at the four study sites, specific reasons for the differing patterns of fire exclusion are not
known. Fire exclusion at sites AV and CB, and the 29-year fire exclusion period at site SP,
may be due to changes in grazing, roads, or agricultural practices and may be associated
with the establishment of ejidos. At least some of the recent fires at sites AV, AL, and SP,
however, appear to be due to the deliberate burning of clearings.
Climatic factors appear to influence fire regimes in the study area in a manner similar
to climate-fire relations in the southwestern United States. Seven of the ten major fire years
in Table 5 correspond to years in which positive winter Southern Oscillation index (SOI)
extremes were reconstructed from dendrochronological data in the Sierra Madre Occidental
by Stahle and Cleaveland (1993). The positive SOI extremes are associated with cold/dry
weather conditions, unfavorable for tree growth but possibly conducive to fire. None of the
major fire years corresponded to years with negative (warm/wet) SOI extremes (Stahle and
Cleaveland, 1993). The major fire years do not match the six major regional fire years

Fulé & Covington: Fire Regimes and Forest Structure in the Sierra Madre Occidental
73
identified by Swetnam and Baisan (1996) in the southwestern United States during the
overlapping period of their analysis, 1835-1879, possibly reflecting different patterns of
climate and ignition as well as the small sample size (4 sites) of the present study. But the
results are generally in agreement with the findings of Swetnam and Betancourt (1990),
who showed that area burned in the southwestern United States was greatest in years with
high positive SOI values and least in low SOI (El Niño) years. The spring-summer fire season
(Table 3) is also similar to southwestern patterns (Swetnam and Baisan, 1996). As additional
fire history data are collected in northern Mexico, a more detailed analysis of the climate-
fire relationship should be developed to increase understanding of past and present
ecological conditions and to improve prediction of short-term and long-term changes in fire
frequency and intensity.
Fire and Forest Structure
Forest ecosystem structures appeared to be closely linked to fire patterns at the four
study sites. The descriptive comparison among different sites forming a chronosequence
of fire exclusion in this study cannot statistically separate fire effects from the variety of other
factors influencing forest structure and dynamics. In particular, the mesic site characteristics
of site CB (high elevation, north aspect) are distinctly different from those of the drier pine-
oak sites, influencing at least the species composition, and probably also affecting tree
density and dead woody biomass. However, several broad trends related to recent fire
regimes are clear across all sites. First is the trend from relatively open forests of large
trees at the recently burned sites AL and SP to the relatively dense forests of small trees
at the fire-excluded sites AV and CB. Other differences, discussed above, include
regeneration (older understory trees at unburned sites, seedlings at burned sites), age and
diameter distributions (dense young trees at unburned sites), dead tree structure (more dead
trees, especially small-diameter trees, at burned sites), dead woody biomass loadings
(higher fuel loading at burned sites), and herbaceous cover (higher at burned sites). These
trends are consistent with the effects of frequent fire in thinning small, young trees and
maintaining low levels of woody fuels and duff.
Differences between the recently burned and unburned study sites follow patterns
similar to the changes observed in ponderosa pine forest structure of the southwestern U.S.
following fire exclusion. Ponderosa pine density at a number of sites in Arizona and New
Mexico ranged from 7 to 116 trees/ha prior to Euro-American settlement (summary of
reconstructive studies and early forest inventories cited in Covington and Moore [1994b]).
Due to the exclusion of fire and reduced herbaceous competition, modern tree densities
are much higher. The average ponderosa pine density in Arizona in 1985 was 776 trees/
ha (Garrett et al., 1990), but an unmanaged ponderosa "natural area" increased far more,
from 61 trees/ha in 1876 to 3,098 trees/ha in 1992 (Covington et al., 1997). The probable
changes in forest density due to fire exclusion inferred from the present study have a smaller
range, with the two recently burned sites (AL and SP) averaging 602 trees/ha and the two
fire-excluded sites (AV and CB) averaging 2,137 trees/ha, about 3.5 times higher. But the
direction of change in density and other associated structural attributes, such as increased
fuel loading, parallel those of the dense U.S. ecosystems which now support high-intensity,
stand-replacing wildfires over thousands of hectares (Covington et al., 1994).

Acta Botánica Mexicana (1997), 41:43-79
74
Fire exclusion impacts have received relatively little attention in Mexico. Although
beneficial aspects of fire as a silvicultural tool and as a natural ecological disturbance factor
have been recognized within the scientific community (Sánchez and Dieterich, 1983;
Rodríguez and Sierra, 1992; Alanís-Morales, 1996), public perceptions have been influenced
by anti-fire publicity (Rodríguez and Sierra, 1992). The present situation in northern Mexico
may be analogous to that of the western U.S. about 50 years ago. Several observers had
already noted deleterious effects of fire exclusion (e.g., Leopold 1924, Weaver 1943), but
these reports were often met with skepticism by foresters. For example, when Harold Weaver
(1951) called for increased application of prescribed fire, the Journal of Forestry found the
topic sufficiently controversial to solicit a rebuttal. In recent decades, however, the attention
of land managers and the public in the U.S. has been focused on the hazards of fire exclusion
as a result of increasingly large, destructive, and costly wildfires in fire-excluded ecosystems
(Swetnam, 1990; Covington et al., 1994).
By contrast, in Mexico large high-intensity fires are still rare, perhaps as a
consequence of low fuels from frequent burning, relatively short periods of fire exclusion,
and a mosaic of forest patches burned at different times, analogous to the chaparral patterns
in Baja California Norte (Minnich, 1983). A recent government report on national wildfire
status (Anonymous, 1994) described Mexican forest fires as affecting the herbaceous
vegetation but only rarely the tree crowns.3 Because of the relatively fewer firefighting
resources available in Mexico, compared with the high historic investment in fire suppression
in the U.S., fire exclusion periods extending to 100 or more years may not become common
in the Sierra Madre Occidental. But wildfires are likely to become larger and more severe
as fire exclusion periods lengthen and fuels accumulate. The high overstory densities and
heavy fuel loading observed at the fire-excluded sites in this study are likely to support high-
intensity fire with extensive tree mortality. Taking site SP as an example of the return of
fire to a fire-excluded ecosystem, if the densities of recently-killed trees and living trees are
summed as a rough approximation of forest density after 29 years of fire exclusion (total
914 trees/ha), the 1984 and 1993 fires killed up to 40% of the trees at the site. Despite
this tree mortality, the ecosystem at site SP remains a pine-oak forest. The outcome of the
next wildfire at sites AV and CB may be different, as these fire-excluded sites have overstory
densities 150% to 300% that of site SP, as well as very high woody fuel loading, so high-
intensity fire could lead to heavy mortality or deforestation. The hazard is augmented through
fuel structures such as flammable rotten wood, deep forest floors which burn slowly with
extended periods of lethal temperatures, and fuel ladders composed of smaller and mid-
sized trees that carry fire into the overstory crowns.
Further fire ecology research and increased application of innovative fire management
practices such as prescribed burning will be invaluable in helping to reconcile the paradoxical
nature of fire, seen both as an essential ecological process and as the destroyer of the
forest. The contradictory nature of these perspectives on fire is evident in the Sierra Madre
Occidental. As populations rise and as the infrastructure needed for timber exploitation is
developed, landowners and foresters have become increasingly aware of timber values and
have initiated extensive campaigns to prevent, detect, and suppress forest fires. Ejido
members at the studied areas are proud of their contributions to fire prevention and
suppression crews (P.Z. Fulé, personal observation, 1994). However, the regime of frequent,

y rara vez la copa de los árboles."

75
low-intensity fire which has prevailed till recently in these forests is a key ecological process
contributing to the present health and low destructive potential of fuels in many of these
forests today (Leopold, 1937, Marshall, 1962, Fulé and Covington, 1994, Baisan and
Swetnam, 1995). Another example of a problematic fire paradigm is expressed in a recent
study which concluded that these northern states are becoming deforested because the area
reforested (i.e., planted) is a tiny fraction of the area burned (Fisher et al., 1995); this
deforestation argument is based on the unsubstantiated assumption of complete tree
mortality from fire. While the authors appear to be motivated by a wish to preserve these
unique ecosystems, the present study and numerous others suggest that the unintended
consequence of a fire exclusion approach to preservation is likely to be the replacement
of frequent low-intensity fires with infrequent, high-intensity, stand-killing fires. We
recommend further research in the ecology of fire and the potential for application of
prescribed fire as a tool for management and conservation of these unique and diverse
ecosystems.
