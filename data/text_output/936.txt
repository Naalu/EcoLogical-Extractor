Using Best Available Science:

The use of best available science information
(referred to as BASI) is advised or mandated in
many public land, resource management, and
environmental laws, policies, and regulations, yet
there is no single deﬁnition of “best available
science” across land management agency
directives. A new Journal of Forestry article
describes the different sources of science
information and how to use context to best
determine BASI requirements.
