and dead trees were signiﬁcant (α = 0.05) across all time 
periods tested. Our best logistical model of aspen mortality 
indicates that younger aspen trees with lower recent growth 
rates and higher frequencies of abrupt growth declines had 
an increased risk of mortality. Our ﬁndings highlight the 
need for species-speciﬁc mortality functions in forest suc-
cession models. Size-dependent mortality functions suit-
able for late successional species may not be appropriate 
for species with different life history strategies. For some 
early successional species, like aspen, slow growth at vari-
ous stages of the tree’s life is associated with increased 
mortality risk.

Introduction
A growing body of evidence shows that forest dieback 
and tree mortality rates have increased in recent decades, 
both globally and in the western United States (Allen et al. 
2010; Anderegg et al. 2012). This increase in tree mortality 
has been linked to drought conditions, which are expected 
to become more frequent and severe with climate change 
(Breshears et al. 2008; Gitlin et al. 2006; van Mantgem 
et al. 2009). Rapid and widespread tree mortality, driven by 
changing climate conditions, has the potential to alter forest 
structure and composition with implications for ecosystem 
services and ecological functions (Anderegg et al. 2012; van 
Mantgem et al. 2009). High mortality rates could result in 
rapid contraction of some species’ distributions (Rehfeldt 
et al. 2006, 2009). Understanding the processes of tree mor-
tality is critical to predicting and managing forest change 
under future climate conditions (van Mantgem et al. 2009).
Abstract Widespread dieback of aspen forests, some-
times called sudden aspen decline, has been observed 
throughout much of western North America, with the 
highest mortality rates in the southwestern United States. 
Recent aspen mortality has been linked to drought stress 
and elevated temperatures characteristic of conditions 
expected under climate change, but the role of individual 
aspen tree growth patterns in contributing to recent tree 
mortality is less well known. We used tree-ring data to 
investigate the relationship between an individual aspen 
tree’s lifetime growth patterns and mortality. Surviving 
aspen trees had consistently higher average growth rates for 
at least 100 years than dead trees. Contrary to observations 
from late successional species, slow initial growth rates 
were not associated with a longer lifespan in aspen. Aspen 
trees that died had slower lifetime growth and slower 
growth at various stages of their lives than those that sur-
vived. Differences in average diameter growth between live

Although the processes leading to individual tree mor-
tality play an important role in predicting future forest 
dieback, mechanisms of tree death remain poorly under-
stood (Bigler and Bugman 2004b; Keane et al. 2001). Tree 
growth at different times during a tree’s lifespan has been 
linked to mortality (Bigler and Bugman 2004b; Bigler and 
Veblen 2009; Das et al. 2007; Pedersen 1998). However, 
many models of forest dynamics, including gap models, 
treat mortality as a function of slow growth, age or size 
without consideration of how variable growth at differ-
ent stages of a tree’s life may contribute to the probabil-
ity of mortality (Keane et al. 2001; Manusch et al. 2012). 
Decreased growth in the 5–50 years preceding tree death 
has been correlated with increased risk of mortality across 
many different tree species, including several conifer spe-
cies, oaks, and aspen (e.g., Bigler and Bugman 2003; Das 
et al. 2007; Kane 2012; Ogle et al. 2000; Pedersen 1998). 
Fast growth in the ﬁrst 50 years of a tree’s life has been 
associated with a shorter lifespan (Bigler and Veblen 2009; 
Black and Colbert 2008). Consistently slow lifetime growth 
rates are associated with increased longevity, especially in 
long-lived shade-tolerant species (Loehle 1988).
Between species, a trade-off between growth rates and 
longevity has been well-documented (Bigler and Bugman 
2004a; Bigler and Veblen 2009; Black and Colbert 2008; 
Loehle 1988). Late successional species invest more in 
defensive compounds and structural support (i.e., higher 
wood density) and reach sexual maturity at a later age, but 
grow more slowly than fast-growing pioneer species (Loe-
hle 1988). A similar trend has been observed within spe-
cies, where slower-growing individuals are often the old-
est trees and trees that initially grow fast frequently die at 
younger ages (Bigler and Veblen 2009; Black and Colbert 
2008). Much of the work linking intraspeciﬁc tree growth 
patterns to the probability of mortality has focused on late 
successional, shade-tolerant conifers (e.g., Bigler and Bug-
man 2004a; Bigler and Veblen 2009; Das et al. 2007). But, 
some studies have also shown support for an inverse rela-
tionship between growth rate and longevity in shade-intol-
erant, pioneer species, such as ponderosa pine (Pinus pon-
derosa) and bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata) (e.g., 
Black and Colbert 2008; Johnson and Abrams 2009).
Aspen (Populus tremuloides) provide a good opportunity 
to investigate the broad applicability of the relationships 
between tree growth rates and mortality because they offer 
another example of a shade-intolerant, pioneer species. 
Additionally, aspen serve as a good example of the need to 
better understand tree mortality because aspen forests are 
currently experiencing extensive forest dieback (Worrall 
et al. 2013). Rapid and severe canopy dieback and mortal-
ity in aspen forests, termed sudden aspen decline (SAD), 
has been observed across much of North America, includ-
ing southwestern Canada, the Great Lakes, throughout 
much of the Rocky Mountains, and in the southwestern US 
(Fairweather et al. 2008; Frey et al. 2004; Huang and Ande-
regg 2012; Worrall et al. 2008, 2010; Zegler et al. 2012).
Aspen overstory tree mortality is particularly high in 
northern Arizona, which is near the southwestern limit of 
the species’ contiguous range in North America. In the San 
Francisco Peaks in northern Arizona, aspen stands sus-
tained cumulative mortality levels of 55 % from 2000 to 
2007 (Fairweather et al. 2008). Based on stand conditions 
sampled between 2009 and 2010 on the Kaibab National 
Forest, Zegler et al. (2012) reported the highest overstory 
aspen mortality for the western US (50 % by tree density; 
44 % by basal area). Aspen sustained the highest overstory 
(45 %) mortality rates of four tree species studied in mixed 
conifer forests that were sampled in 2008 in this region 
(Kane 2012). Sixty-two percent of the measured aspen 
mortality in these stands occurred between 1996 and 2008 
(Kane 2012). Following a period of severe drought, aspen 
sustained relative overstory mortality rates (dead trees as a 
proportion of live trees) of 85 % between 2002 and 2007 in 
northern Arizona (Ganey and Votja 2011). As other authors 
have suggested, these high mortality rates may represent 
early indications of aspen’s response to climate warming 
near the southern edge of its distribution (Ganey and Votja 
2011; Gitlin et al. 2006).
Factors related to site and stand conditions, as well as 
the prevalence of insect attacks and tree diseases have been 
linked to SAD. Spatial settings with higher moisture stress, 
such as lower elevations, ﬂatter slope angles, and southern 
and western facing slopes are associated with SAD (Huang 
and Anderegg 2012; Worrall et al. 2008, 2010). Forest type 
and conifer basal area interact with drought and late-spring 
frosts to contribute toward aspen mortality (Fairweather 
et al. 2008; Zegler et al. 2012). For example, aspen over-
story mortality in northern Arizona was higher in lower ele-
vation ponderosa pine-Gambel oak (Pinus ponderosa and 
Quercus gambelii) dominated forests (57 % of aspen basal 
area) than in nearby mixed conifer forests (38 % by basal 
area; Zegler et al. 2012). In the same study, the most impor-
tant factors explaining aspen overstory mortality were con-
tributing factors, especially wood-boring insects and canker 
diseases (Zegler et al. 2012).
Although the links between site and stand factors, cli-
mate, insects, diseases and recent aspen mortality have been 
investigated, the contribution of individual aspen growth 
patterns to recent tree mortality has received relatively little 
attention. In the two studies to examine the impact of previ-
ous growth on aspen mortality, multiple years of reduced 
growth and abrupt growth decreases were associated with 
mortality (Hanna and Kulakowski 2012; Kane 2012). How-
ever, both of these studies focused on a single forest type, 
either pure aspen stands (Hanna and Kulakowski 2012) 
or mixed-conifer forests (Kane 2012). To our knowledge,

this is the ﬁrst study to examine the links between aspen 
mortality and growth across a range of forest types over the 
elevational gradient of aspen’s distribution and at multiple 
different stages of a tree’s lifespan.
In this study, we use tree-ring data to examine the rela-
tionship between growth patterns at different stages of an 
aspen tree’s life and individual tree mortality. We com-
pare growth patterns between trees that died and those that 
survived across the tree’s entire lifespan, at the beginning 
of life, and in the years preceding death. Speciﬁcally, our 
objectives were to determine whether trees that died and 
those that survived exhibited different growth patterns (1) 
across their entire lifespan, (2) within the initial 50 years of 
growth, and (3) in the 5–100 years prior to death. Finally, 
we built models of tree mortality using growth pattern vari-
ables at these different periods within a tree’s life to explore 
the utility of tree growth variables in predicting aspen tree 
mortality.
Materials and methods
Study area
The study area was the 248,234 hectare Williams Ranger 
District of the Kaibab National Forest, in northern Arizona 
in the United States. Aspen occupies <1 % of the study 
area and occurs primarily as small and patchy stands, with 
larger stands (approximately 30–40 ha) at higher eleva-
tions (>2,400 m) on Bill Williams Mountain, Kendrick 
Peak, and Sitgreaves Mountain (Zegler et al. 2012). At 
the lowest elevations, aspen stands are often surrounded 
or mixed with ponderosa pine and Gambel oak. At middle 
elevations and north-facing slopes, aspen co-occur with 
Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca), south-
western white pine (Pinus strobiformis), and ponderosa 
pine. In addition to Douglas-ﬁr and southwestern white 
pine, the highest elevation aspen stands are also mixed 
with white ﬁr (Abies concolor) and corkbark ﬁr (Abies 
lasiocarpa var. arizonica).
Elevations within the study area range from 1,435 to 
3,175 m, and aspen stands are found between 1,900 and 
3,125 m. Precipitation in the study area is bimodal with 
peaks during the summer monsoon (July–September) and 
winter (January–March). Climate summaries from the 
Williams, Arizona weather station 1897–2012 show that 
total precipitation averages 549 mm annually, 199 mm 
during the monsoon and 161 mm during the winter 
(WRCC 2012). June is the driest month, with an average 
of 12 mm precipitation. The coldest month is typically 
January and the warmest month is July, with average mini-
mum and maximum temperatures of −6.9 °C and 28.7 °C, 
respectively.
Sampling design
Zegler et al. (2012) previously sampled 48 aspen stands 
within our study area. We randomly selected a subset of 
their stands, stratiﬁed by three forest types, described 
below. We chose to sample by forest type because differ-
ences in species composition reﬂect differences in slope, 
soils, stand history, or other factors not accounted for by 
elevation alone. Within each forest type, we randomly 
selected a subset of their sites that had never been exclosed 
and had at least ﬁve live overstory aspen and nine dead 
overstory aspen from which to take increment cores. We 
classiﬁed sites as ponderosa pine forest (Pinus ponderosa, 
abbreviated as PIPO using the ﬁrst two letters of the spe-
cies and genus name) if aspen were present with ponder-
osa pine as the only conifer species present. If ponderosa 
pine and Douglas-ﬁr were present in the absence of white 
ﬁr or subalpine ﬁr, sites were classiﬁed as ponderosa pine 
and Douglas-ﬁr forest (Pinus ponderosa/Pseudotsuga 
menziessii, abbreviated as PIPO/PSME). When white ﬁr 
or subalpine ﬁr was present with Douglas-ﬁr, sites were 
classiﬁed as Douglas-ﬁr and white ﬁr forest (Pseudotsuga 
menziesii/Abies concolor, abbreviated as PSME/ABCO). 
PIPO forests were at the lowest elevations, followed by 
PIPO/PSME and PSME/ABCO forests, but there were 
overlaps in elevation ranges (Table 1). We randomly 
selected 5 sites each within PIPO/PSME and PSME/ABCO 
forests, but only 4 sites within the PIPO forest had enough 
living overstory aspen to meet our criteria, giving us a total 
of 14 sites. We accepted fewer samples from live trees to 
include sites from the PIPO forest, where mortality was so 
high that only four of the sites with sufﬁcient dead trees 
had ﬁve or more living overstory aspen.

Plot design and overstory sampling methods are 
described in detail in Zegler et al. (2012). Brieﬂy, Zegler 
et al. (2012) sampled overstory trees on four 8-m radius 
(~0.02 ha) plots at each site. Overstory trees were deﬁned 
as those trees ≥10 cm in diameter at 1.37 m above the 
ground (diameter at breast height, DBH). Trees were per-
manently marked with metal tags and tree species, DBH, 
and condition class were recorded. We reclassiﬁed the con-
dition classes measured by Zegler et al. (2012) into two 
classes: live and dead. Trees that we classiﬁed as dead fell 
into the following categories, as classiﬁed by Zegler et al. 
(2012): (1) loose-bark snag, (2) clean-bark snag, (3) snag 
broken above breast height (BH), (4) snag broken below 
BH, and (5) dead and down.
Tree-ring analysis
Increment cores were collected from all live aspen trees 
≥20 cm DBH and a 10 % random sample of smaller aspen 
(>5 cm DBH), to sample a minimum of ﬁve live aspen 
cores per site. The majority of live tree cores were collected 
during initial site visits by Zegler et al. (2012), in 2009 and 
2010, although we collected a few supplemental cores in 
2012 to bring the sample size up to our minimum of ﬁve 
live aspen cores per site. We revisited the sites in 2012 and 
collected increment cores from any standing dead aspen 
or aspen logs that were not too rotten to sample (approxi-
mately 10.5 % of snags/logs attempted), for a minimum of 
9 and up to a maximum of 15 dead aspen cores per site. 
We used data collected by Zegler et al. (2012) to ensure 
that all sampled dead aspen had been dead when the site 
was initially sampled, in 2009 or 2010. Whenever possi-
ble, we took cores at 40 cm above the ground, but occa-
sionally sampled at BH when cores taken from the lower 
sampling height were too rotten; we recorded the height at 
which cores were sampled. If a selected tree was too rotten, 
we sampled the closest aspen tree of similar size (DBH). 
We attempted to reach pith whenever possible. Because our 
goal was to investigate relationships between growth and 
mortality, it was most important to us to have intact outer 
rings, so we accepted cores that did not reach the pith due 
to rot, but had at least 50 years of growth preceding the 
outer ring. When cores were on a slope, we collected cores 
perpendicular to the slope of the plot to avoid compression 
wood.
Increment cores were prepared and crossdated using 
standard dendrochronology techniques (Stokes and Smi-
ley 1968), as described below. All cores were mounted 
and sanded with progressively ﬁner grit sandpaper, ﬁnish-
ing with ANSI 400-grit (20.6–23.6 µm) and then hand-
polished using 40, 30, and ﬁnally 15 µm sanding ﬁlm until 
rings were clearly visible under a microscope. All cores 
from live trees were visually crossdated, ring widths were 
measured for a maximum of ten samples for live aspen 
from each site, and we veriﬁed our crossdating using the 
COFECHA software program (Holmes 1983). Once we 
had developed a reliable chronology for live aspen trees 
from each site, we visually crossdated the dead aspen trees. 
We also measured ring widths for a maximum of ten dead 
aspen samples at each site and assessed our crossdating 
against the live samples using COFECHA.
For those trees that either had pith or came within an 
estimated 20 rings of the pith, we estimated age as the num-
ber of rings from pith to the outermost ring. We estimated 
the number of missing rings using a pith locator based on 
the curvature of the inner rings (Applequist 1958). Because 
aspen can elongate to at least 1 m in height in their ﬁrst 
growing season (Romme et al. 1995), we did not adjust age 
for coring height. All ages presented in this study are age at 
coring height.
We converted ring width measurements to inside-bark 
basal area increments (BAI) to remove any age-related 
growth trends, using the dpIR package in R (Bunn 2008). 
As has been frequently shown in studies of tree mortality, 
BAI is considered a better measure of overall tree growth 
than ring width because it reliably reduces the trend of 
declining growth as trees age (Bigler and Bugman 2003, 
2004a, b; Biondi and Qeadan 2008). Since conversion 
from ring-widths to BAI assumes that ring widths decline 
with age, we examined plots of both raw ring widths and 
BAI against tree ages for those trees with at least 50 years 
growth and whose age we could estimate within 20 rings 
of pith (Table 2). We found that, within a given age class, 
mean ring width did decline with age and that converting 
to BAI reduced this age related growth trend; therefore, 
we concluded that converting ring widths to BAI repre-
sented the most appropriate measure of overall tree growth 
(Appendix S1 in Online Resources).
Comparing lifetime and initial growth
Our ﬁrst goal was to determine whether lifetime growth 
patterns differed between trees that ultimately died (hence-
forth, dead trees) and those that survived (live trees). Sec-
ondly, we were interested in testing whether dead trees had 
higher initial growth rates than live trees. To characterize 
average lifetime growth of each tree, we calculated mean 
BAI from the pith to the last annual ring. For comparisons 
of early growth rates, we summarized average BAI during 
the ﬁrst 50 years of each tree’s life. We decided to use the 
ﬁrst 50 years to represent early growth because previous 
authors have linked fast growth during this early stage of 
a tree’s life to reduced longevity (Bigler and Veblen 2009; 
Black and Colbert 2008). To meet assumptions of normal-
ity in statistical tests and to reduce the weight of very high 
BAI values, we transformed our average BAI measurement 

Oecologia 
1 3
over each time period (bai_Lifetime, bai_ﬁrst50) using the 
natural logarithm (lnbai_Lifetime, lnbai_ﬁrst50) (Bigler 
and Bugman 2003). Since an accurate measure of the ini-
tial 50 years of growth requires that all of the ﬁrst years of 
growth are present, we restricted this analysis to those trees 
that actually had pith (not estimated) and at least 50 years 
of growth (Table 1). Two sites from the lowest elevation 
forest type (PIPO) had no live trees with 50 years of growth 
and had to be excluded from all statistical analyses.
We tested for differences in average lifetime growth and 
average initial growth of live and dead aspen trees using 
multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) (SAS Proc 
GLM; SAS Institute 2011). Dependent variables were each 
tree’s average lifetime growth (lnbai_Lifetime) and aver-
age growth over the ﬁrst 50 years of life (lnbai_ﬁrst50). We 
considered the effects of status (live or dead), forest type 
(PIPO, PSME/PIPO, and PSME/ABCO), and the interac-
tion between status and forest type.
We used a MANOVA model in order to test multiple 
dependent variables while controlling for multicollinear-
ity and the overall alpha level. Normality and homosceda-
sity assumptions were tested graphically prior to ﬁtting the 
ﬁnal MANOVA models, which were reduced to only sig-
niﬁcant factors (α = 0.05) in the ﬁnal model. When over-
all MANOVA models were signiﬁcant, we tested for sig-
niﬁcant differences for each growth interval using separate 
ANOVAs.
Testing growth differences at the end of life
To compare how growth differed between live and dead 
trees later in life, we calculated average BAI over seven 
time-periods of 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 100 years prior 
to death (dead trees). Following the example of Bigler and 
Bugman (2003), we used the last annual growth ring as the 
last year in live trees. We also analyzed the data using the 
mean year of death (2002) as the last ring for live trees, 
but since the results show the same trends we do not report 
them here.
In addition to average growth, we also calculated the 
frequency of abrupt declines, which has been an important 
predictor of tree mortality in previous studies of growth 
characteristics preceding tree death (Das et al. 2007; Ped-
ersen 1998). The frequency of abrupt declines was calcu-
lated by summing the number of times that BAI declined 
by more than 50 % from 1 year to the next over each time 
period (Das et al. 2007; Pedersen 1998). We converted 
the number of abrupt declines over a given time period to 
the proportion of years in each time period with an abrupt 
growth decline (abrupt_last5, abrupt_last10….abrupt_
last50), to meet assumptions of normality.
Again, we used multivariate analysis of variance 
(MANOVA) to test for differences between growth charac-
teristics of live and dead aspen trees and among forest types 
(SAS Proc GLM; SAS Institute 2011). Dependent variables 
were the vectors of growth characteristics for each time 
period preceding death or sampling date (e.g., lnbai_last5, 
lnbai_last10, 
lnbai_last20, 
lnbai_last30, 
lnbai_last40, 
lnbai_last50) and factors were status (live or dead), forest 
type (PIPO, PSME/PIPO, and PSME/ABCO) and the inter-
action between status and forest type. Separate MANOVA 
models were ﬁt for the two different growth characteristics 
(average BAI and abrupt declines).
For this analysis, we did not require trees to have pith, 
since we were interested in growth rates at the end of life. 
However, we used only cores with at least 50 years of 
growth in our analyses. Since we did not need pith, we had 
a larger sample size than in our analysis of lifetime and ini-
tial growth (Table 2) and we averaged the growth character-
istics for each individual tree by status and site. Thus, site 
represented the unit of analysis for this MANOVA (n = 24; 
n = 12 site averages for live trees; n = 12 site averages for 
dead trees). As before, we used separate ANOVAs to test 
for signiﬁcant differences in each time period when overall 
MANOVA models were signiﬁcant.
Using a smaller subset of cores, we also tested differ-
ences in growth characteristics between live and dead trees 
with at least 100 years of growth prior to death. However,

since the sample size for trees with at least 100 years of 
growth was small compared to those with 50 years of 
growth, we analyzed the 100-year growth differences sepa-
rately from the other time-periods of growth (see below). 
None of the trees from sites in the PIPO forests had at least 
100-years of growth, so PIPO forests were not included in 
the analysis of 100-year growth differences. Nine sites had 
some live and dead trees with at least 100 years of growth.
We tested longer-term (100-year) differences in growth 
characteristics (average BAI and abrupt declines) between 
live and dead trees, by forest type, using ANOVA tech-
niques (R Statistical Package; R Development Core Team 
2012). Because fewer trees overall (n = 123 trees; 67 live, 
56 dead) and fewer trees per site had at least 100 years of 
growth to test, we used individual trees, rather than sites, as 
the unit of analysis for the ANOVAs and ran the tests sepa-
rately from the MANOVAs described above. If the ANOVA 
test for differences in each growth characteristic was signif-
icant, we tested pairwise differences between forest types 
using t tests.
Modeling aspen mortality
We applied logistic regression techniques to model the 
probability of aspen survival, where a probability of one 
indicated the tree was alive. Independent predictor vari-
ables included each of the growth characteristic variables 
for each time period, live conifer BA (as a proxy for com-
petition with conifer), forest type (PIPO, PIPO/PSME, and 
PSME/ABCO), tree age and tree DBH at the time of death 
or at the sampling date for live trees. We randomly split the 
data into model development (n = 99; 53 live, 46 dead) and 
validation (n = 87; 46 live, 41 dead) datasets.
Because we included tree age and DBH in our models, 
we tested overall differences in these variables between live 
and dead trees, by forest type, using ANOVA techniques (R 
Statistical Package; R Development Core Team 2012). We 
followed signiﬁcant ANOVAs with pairwise t tests for dif-
ferences among live and dead trees by forest type.
We used Akaike’s Information Criterion, adjusted for 
small sample size (AICc), to select both the best univari-
ate growth characteristic models and the most parsimoni-
ous combined model (Burnham and Anderson 1998). Our 
model selection followed methods described by Das et al. 
(2007). We selected the best two variables for each growth 
characteristic category (e.g., lnbai_last5, lnbai_last10…., 
lnbai_Lifetime), as well as any variables within two AIC 
units (∆AICc) of the best variable or those with Akaike 
weights (wi) of 0.10 or greater. We considered growth char-
acteristics for time periods up to 50 years prior to death 
or sampling and also included average growth (BAI) over 
each tree’s entire lifetime (lnbai_Lifetime). However, we 
did not use growth characteristics for the 100-year time 
period, because restricting the analysis to only trees with 
at least 100 years of growth would have reduced our sam-
ple size by nearly half. Next, we developed models with all 
the selected variables and any of the additional independ-
ent predictor variables (conifer BA, forest type, tree age, 
tree DBH). Candidate models were restricted such that 
no model could have more than one growth characteristic 
category (e.g., no more than one abrupt decline variable). 
We used the R package glmulti (Calcagno and de Mazan-
court 2010) to perform automated model selection using 
AICc and package AICcmodavg (Mazerolle 2012) to gener-
ate tables of AICc, ∆AICc and wi. Multicollinearity in the 
independent variables was assessed by calculating variance 
inﬂation factors (VIFs) and models were excluded if VIFs 
exceeded 10 (Neter et al. 1996). We report the area under 
the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for each 
model as a ﬁt criterion for model comparison (calculated 
using ROCR package in R; Sing et al. 2012). The ROC sta-
tistic is a measure of the ability of the model to accurately 
discriminate between classes with values below 0.5 sug-
gesting no discrimination, 0.7–0.8 suggesting acceptable 
discrimination, and 0.8–0.9 suggesting excellent discrimi-
nation (Hosmer and Lemeshow 2000).
To validate our best model, we applied it to the valida-
tion dataset and classiﬁed trees as dead when the predicted 
probability fell beneath a speciﬁc threshold, which was 
selected as follows. We determined an “optimal” threshold 
by plotting the speciﬁcity (proportion of correctly classiﬁed 
live trees in the model development dataset) and the sen-
sitivity (proportion of correctly classiﬁed dead trees in the 
model development dataset) curves and selecting the point 
at which they intersect as the threshold (Hosmer and Leme-
show 2000). Finally, the percent of correctly classiﬁed live 
and dead trees in the validation dataset and the kappa coef-
ﬁcient (κ), a measure of how well the classiﬁcation per-
forms as compared to random assignment, were calculated 
for the best model (R package caret; Kuhn 2013).
Results
Aspen overstory mortality was higher in the two lower ele-
vations forest types, PIPO and PIPO/PSME forests than in 
the higher, more mesic PSME/ABCO forests (see Appen-
dix S2 in Online Resources). Although live conifer basal 
area did not differ among forest types, live aspen basal area 
was highest in the PSME/ABCO forests (Appendix S2).
The majority of the dead trees we sampled died in recent 
decades. Our earliest recorded death date was 1963 and the 
most recent death date was in 2008. Across all of our sites, 
the mean death date was 2001, but the modal year of death 
was 2004. Ninety percent of the sampled snags died since 
1991 (between 1991 and 2008), while 63 % died since the 

Oecologia

severely dry year of 2002. A major pulse of aspen mortality 
began around 2000 and continued through 2008.
We sampled a total of 267 live and 166 dead aspen trees, 
of which we were able to crossdate 261 (98 %) and 165 
(99 %), respectively (Table 2). Live and dead aspen trees 
exhibited large and persistent differences in BAI (Fig. 1). 
Differences were apparent over approximately 130 years 
(since 1879). A large increase in mean BAI is apparent in 
both live and dead trees starting in 1905 (Fig. 1). Although 
beyond the scope of this study, this rise may be due to the 
persistent drought conditions of the preceding decade. The 
Palmer Drought Severity Index—an index of moisture 
availability where negative values represent drier than aver-
age conditions—was negative in every year from 1895 to 
1904 and switched to positive in 1905 (Cook et al. 2004).
Lifetime and initial growth differences
Live trees had higher average growth rates across their 
lifetime and in the ﬁrst 50 years of growth than dead trees 
(Fig. 2a, c; MANOVA Wilk’s λ(2,72) = 0.67, P < 0.0001). 
The univariate ANOVAs showed that live trees had higher 
average growth rates than dead trees for both lifetime 
growth (Fstatus = 18.46, P < 0.0001) and initial growth  
(Fstatus = 4.45, P = 0.04).
The effect of forest type was also signiﬁcant, with the 
highest average growth rates in PIPO/PSME forests (Fig. 2; 
MANOVA Wilk’s λ(4,144) = 0.72, P < 0.0001). PIPO/PSME 
forests also had higher growth rates than the other two 
forest types in univariate tests for both lifetime growth  
(Fforest type = 8.56, P = 0.0003) and initial growth  
(Fforest type = 3.88, P = 0.02).
Differences between live and dead trees varied by for-
est type, with a signiﬁcant multivariate effect of the inter-
action between status and forest type (Fig. 2; MANOVA 
Wilk’s λ(4,144) = 0.85, P < 0.02). However, these differ-
ences were signiﬁcant in univariate tests for lifetime aver-
age growth rate (Fstatus × forest type = 0.73, P = 0.05), but not 
for initial growth (Fstatus × forest type = 0.95, P = 0.39). The 
univariate tests revealed that live trees had higher lifetime 
growth rates than dead trees in both PIPO/PSME (Fig. 2b; 
P < 0.004) and PSME/ABCO (Fig. 2b; P < 0.0001) for-
ests when comparison were made within forest types. But, 
within PIPO forests live and dead trees’ lifetime growth 
rates were the same (Fig. 2b; P = 1.0).
Growth differences at the end of life
Later in life, average BAI showed larger and more consist-
ent differences between live and dead aspen trees across 
time periods than the proportion of abrupt declines (Fig. 3). 
Live trees in PIPO forests had much higher average BAI 
in recent years (most recent 5–10 years) than either of the 
other two forest types, but converged toward average BAI 
in PIPO/PSME forests over longer time periods.
Live trees had higher average BAI across all time peri-
ods than dead trees. Forest type and the interaction between 
status (live/dead) and forest type were nonsigniﬁcant, so

they were removed from the MANOVA model. However, 
differences between live and dead trees’ average BAI for 
each time period were signiﬁcant (MANOVA; Table 3). 
Univariate analyses for each time period indicated that live 
trees’ average BAI was higher than that of dead trees across 
all time periods (Table 3).
There was no difference in the proportion of abrupt 
declines across tree status (MANOVA Wilk’s λ(6,13) = 0.45, 
P = 0.07), forest type (Wilk’s λ(12,26) = 0.48, P = 0.49), or 
their interaction (Wilk’s λ(12,26) = 0.31, P = 0.12). Because 
none of the factors in the overall MANOVA for abrupt 
declines were signiﬁcant, no further multivariate or univari-
ate analyses for each time period were examined.
Dead trees exhibited slower average growth than live 
tree over long time frames. Dead trees had lower aver-
age BAI (by 201.2 mm2 year−1) than live trees over the 
100 years preceding death (ANOVA F(2, 120) = 24.9, 
P < 0.0001). The effect of forest type was signiﬁcant 
(P = 0.0001). However, with α = 0.025 to control the Type 
I error rate of conducting two t tests, differences between 
live and dead trees were not signiﬁcant in PIPO/PSME 
forests (P = 0.05) and signiﬁcant in PSME/ABCO forests 
(P < 0.0001). In PSME/ABCO forests, the average BAI of 
dead trees was 182.0 mm2 year−1 lower than that of live 
trees over the previous 100 years. Differences between live 
and dead trees in the proportion of abrupt declines dur-
ing the preceding 100 years were not signiﬁcant (ANOVA 
F(2, 120) = 0.54, P = 0.58).
Predicting aspen mortality
Trees that died were generally younger and smaller than 
those that survived. The average age of dead trees was lower 
(by 19.5 years) than live trees (df = 3, 175; F = 93.65; 
P < 0.0001) and the average DBH of live trees was larger 
(by 8.9 cm) than that of dead trees (df = 3,175; F = 37.2; 
P < 0.0001). For both age and DBH, the effect of forest 
type in the overall ANOVAs was signiﬁcant (P < 0.0001 for 
age; P = 0.0002 for DBH), as was the effect of status (live/
dead; P < 0.0001 for age and DBH). Differences between 
live and dead trees’ ages were driven by the PSME/ABCO 
forest type, and differences in tree DBH were signiﬁcant 
for the PIPO/PSME and PSME/ABCO forest types (see 
Appendix S3 in Online Resource 1).
The best univariate model of aspen mortality for the 
average BAI category was average BAI over the past 
40 years (lnbai40). Lifetime BAI and BAI over the most 
recent 10 years had ∆AICc > 2 and wi < 0.10 and were

not used to construct multiple variable models. All of the 
remaining average BAI variables were considered in our 
multiple variable models. For abrupt declines, the best 
model was the 5 year time period (abrupt5), followed by 
the 30 year (abrupt30), 50 year (abrupt50) and 40 year 
(abrupt40) time periods, which all had wi > 0.10 and were 
included for consideration in our multiple variable models.
Growth patterns in the most recent 5 years were strong 
predictors of aspen mortality. Five models fell within 
two AICc units of the best model (Table 4). All ﬁve of 
these models included average BAI over the most recent 
5 years. In addition, the variables abrupt decline over the 
most recent 5 years, tree age, and tree DBH were each 
included in three out of the ﬁve best models. Forest type 
was included in two of the best models. The area under the 
ROC curve ranged from 0.88 to 0.90 for the best ﬁve mod-
els, suggesting excellent discrimination among live and 
dead trees. Multicollinearity was not apparent in any of the 
best models (VIF < 3.0).
The selected model included average BAI and abrupt 
declines over the most recent 5 years, as well as age 
(Table 5). When applied to the validation dataset, this 
model had an overall accuracy of 77 % and κ = 0.54. The 
model correctly classiﬁed 85 % (35/41) of dead trees and 
70 % (32/46) of live trees at a threshold level of 0.59.
Discussion
The relationship between tree growth and mortality is 
used widely to predict risk of tree mortality. A large num-
ber of studies have reported a decline in growth rates in 
the years preceding the death of an individual tree (Bigler 
and Bugman 2004b; Das et al. 2007; Ogle et al. 2000; Ped-
ersen 1998). Another commonly reported relationship is 
the trade-off between high growth rates at the beginning 
of a tree’s life and reduced longevity (Bigler and Bugman 
2004a; Bigler and Veblen 2009; Black and Colbert 2008). 
We present here an analysis of the relationship between 
an individual aspen tree’s lifetime growth patterns and 
mortality.

extending across entire tree life spans and sometimes as 
far back as 100 years prior to death. Across all stages of 
a tree’s life, live aspen trees had higher growth rates than 
trees that ultimately died. For the years leading up to tree 
death, our results support previous work in other tree spe-
cies linking reduced growth in the years prior to death to 
an increased probability of mortality (Bigler and Bugman 
2004b; Das et al. 2007; Ogle et al. 2000; Pedersen 1998). 
However, our ﬁndings that live trees had higher lifetime 
and initial average growth rates than dead trees contradict 
previous work suggesting a trade-off between growth rates 
and longevity (e.g., Bigler and Bugman 2004a; Black and 
Colbert 2008; Johnson and Abrams 2009).
For shade-tolerant conifers, rapid average growth dur-
ing the ﬁrst 50 years of the tree’s life reduced tree longev-
ity, possibly as a result of trade-offs between growth and 
defense (Bigler and Veblen 2009). Our results suggest the 
opposite trend for aspen, with slow growth over long time 
frames leading to increased mortality. Even when compar-
ing the ﬁrst 50 years of growth, trees that died had slower 
growth rates than those which survived. For fast-growing, 
shade-intolerant species like aspen, investment in rapid 
growth may provide a stronger advantage than investment 
in defense (Bigler and Bugman 2003).
A major limitation of many forest succession models is 
the lack of species-speciﬁc, empirically derived relation-
ships between growth and tree mortality (Bigler and Bug-
man 2004b; Keane et al. 2001). Although models that use 
size-dependent mortality functions may be able to produce 
the negative relationship between tree growth rate and 
longevity observed for many tree species (Manusch et al. 
2012), our results indicate the need for implementation of 
different mortality functions for trees with different life his-
tory strategies. For some pioneer species, like aspen, slow 
growth at various stages in the tree’s lifecycle is linked to a 
higher probability of mortality.
Although aspen tree mortality differed by forest type 
(Appendix S2), variation in growth rates was related more 
strongly to whether trees had died or survived than to dif-
ferences among forest types. Only lifetime average growth

rates differed by forest type, early growth rates and growth 
rates in all the time periods prior to death were similar 
across forest types. These results are consistent with pre-
vious work in other tree species suggesting that reduced 
growth in the years preceding death is a reliable predictor 
of mortality (e.g., Bigler and Bugman 2004b; Das et al. 
2007; Ogle et al. 2000; Pedersen 1998), but our results 
showed a much longer growth difference than has been 
reported previously. Longer-term differences in growth 
between live and dead trees, extending 20–25 years prior 
to death, have been documented in Norway spruce (Picea 
abies), white ﬁr, and oak-hickory forests (Bigler and Bug-
man 2004a; Das et al. 2007; Pedersen 1998). Similar to our 
study, Kane (2012) found growth differences between live 
and dead aspen up to 50 years prior to death. Our record 
of tree measurements extended further back in time than 
any previous study of aspen growth and mortality and 
documented persistent differences in average growth for 
50–100 years prior to the present, as well as over the entire 
lifespan of the trees.
Predicting tree mortality
Short-term growth characteristics are also associated with 
aspen mortality. Aspen mortality was correlated with lower 
average growth and higher variability in growth (frequency 
of abrupt declines) in the most recent 5 years, as well as 
with younger age. Our results indicate that trees with lower 
recent (past 5 years) growth were more likely to die. Simi-
lar to our ﬁndings, the most recent 5 years of growth was an 
important predictor of aspen mortality in models for three 
of ten sites in Colorado (Hanna and Kulakowski 2012) and 
was an important predictor in three of the four best models 
of aspen mortality in northern Arizona mixed-conifer for-
ests (Kane 2012). Our model’s success rate at classifying 
live and dead aspen trees (77 % overall accuracy) is simi-
lar to those of Hanna and Kulakowski (2012; 72 % overall 
accuracy) and Kane (2012; live trees: 75–77 %; dead trees: 
76–84 %).
Trees that had died experienced more abrupt growth 
declines than surviving trees, as indicated by the inclusion 
of the frequency of abrupt declines in the past 5 years as 
an important predictor in our best model of aspen mortal-
ity. Multiple drought events in a short period of time, such 
as the 2000 and 2002 drought events, may stress trees that 
are already growing slowly to the point that they cannot 
recover, causing death. Abrupt growth declines have been 
found to improve predictions of tree mortality models in 
previous work (Das et al. 2007; Pedersen 1998). In mixed-
conifer aspen forests, the frequency of abrupt declines over 
the most recent 20 years was an important predictor of 
aspen mortality (Kane 2012).
Dead trees were younger than live trees, a result consist-
ent with ﬁndings from Colorado (Hanna and Kulakowski 
2012). However, differences in age between live and dead 
trees in our study area were associated primarily with 
PSME/ABCO forests and not the other two forest types. 
Although age was not a signiﬁcant predictor of aspen mor-
tality in overall aspen models in Colorado, it was an impor-
tant predictor at four out of the ten sites studied (Hanna 
and Kulakowski 2012). Age differences between live and 
dead trees could be a sampling artifact resulting from decay 
that prevented us from adequately sampling the age range 
of dead trees. Dead trees were more likely to be rotten in 
the center, so our data could be biased toward trees that 
were smaller and younger when they died. Although we 
were able to crossdate some very old trees (oldest live tree: 
231 years, oldest dead tree: 199 years), we may not have a 
complete sample of the age range of trees that died.
We found that dead trees were smaller than live trees 
for the two higher elevation forest types (PIPO/PSME and 
PSME/ABCO). Aspen DBH was an important predictor of 
aspen mortality in three out of ten sites in Colorado, but not 
in overall aspen mortality models (Hanna and Kulakowski 
2012). Although our results show some parallels with those 
of Hanna and Kulakowski (2012), it is worth noting that 
other studies of aspen mortality have not found a relation-
ship between aspen mortality and either tree size or age 
(Worrall et al. 2008). The larger size of live trees could be a 
result of their higher growth rates, on average, or that they 
had more years of continued growth than the trees which 
had died (Hanna and Kulakowski 2012).
Since we found no signiﬁcant differences in conifer 
basal area between forest types (see Appendix S2), there 
may not have been enough variability in conifer basal 
area for it to be an important predictor of aspen mortality 
in our sites. Across sites, conifer basal area ranged from 1 
to 34 m2 ha−1, with an average basal area of 10 m2 ha−1 
(standard deviation = 10 m2 ha−1). But, average conifer 
basal area by forest type ranged from 13 to 25 m2 ha−1, 
with an average basal area of 18 m2 ha−1 (standard 
deviation = 10 m2 ha−1).
Conclusions and management implications
Growth patterns of individual trees are strong predictors of 
whether an individual tree will survive. Forest managers 
who wish to predict aspen mortality for a stand would need 
at least some rough estimate of growth rates, such as an 
estimate of BAI over the past 5–10 years calculated from 
an increment core in the ﬁeld, to apply our models. Manag-
ers could ﬁnd other important variables such as tree size, 
age, or forest type in forest inventory data. However, aver-
age BAI or the frequency of abrupt declines were included

in all of our best models, emphasizing the importance of 
measuring these variables to accurately predict aspen 
mortality.
Two different trajectories of aspen decline may be 
occurring within our study area. Long-term aspen decline, 
driven largely by successional processes, competition, and 
ﬁre exclusion (Romme et al. 1995) could account for most 
of the aspen mortality in the higher elevation PSME/ABCO 
forests. In these forests, trees that died exhibited slower 
long-term growth and were smaller and younger than trees 
that survived, suggesting that mortality could be driven by 
intraspeciﬁc competition and shading. The high rates of 
overstory mortality in the lower elevation forest types and 
strong associations between recent (5-year) growth charac-
teristics and death suggest that SAD may be most impor-
tant here. Zegler et al. (2012) also suggested that overstory 
aspen mortality was consistent with both long-term gradual 
decline and SAD.
Since our study area lies near the southern edge of 
aspen’s distribution in North America, recent aspen tree 
mortality and reductions in aspen growth, especially in the 
lower elevation forest types, may be indicative of aspen’s 
response to future climate change. Most instances of recent 
aspen dieback in North America occurred in areas projected 
to be outside of aspen’s distribution under future climate 
scenarios (Rehfeldt et al. 2009; Worrall et al. 2013). As cli-
mate change progresses and moisture availability decreases 
in the Southwest, climatically suitable aspen habitat is pro-
jected to decrease at the southern edge of its distribution 
(Worrall et al. 2013).
Climate change may slow average growth rates in the 
future. Trees with higher average growth rates were better 
able to recover from pronounced periods of growth reduc-
tion. So, the identiﬁcation of trees with higher average 
growth rates and management strategies aimed at maintain-
ing these individuals may offer a means of mitigating the 
potential effects of future climate change on aspen forests 
in the Southwest. Testing different management strategies 
will be important to maintaining aspen forests in the face 
of future drying trends. One possibility might be to experi-
mentally reduce tree density in different combinations 
of the conifers and some of the smallest, slowest-grow-
ing aspen trees in aspen stands in an attempt to promote 
increased growth of the remaining trees.
