Abstract.
The ﬁre disturbance regime and forest structure prior to Euro-American
settlement (AD 1883) of a southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) landscape were
quantiﬁed in order to establish reference conditions as a baseline for ecosystem management.
The mean presettlement ﬁre interval between 1637 and 1883 was 3.7 yr for all ﬁres and
6.5 yr for widespread ﬁres, but ﬁre has been excluded from the study area since 1883.
Forest density increased under ﬁre exclusion from an average of 148 trees/ha in 1883 (65
pines, 80 oaks, three other species), an open forest dominated by relatively large ponderosa
pines, to 1265 trees/ha in 1994/1995 (720 pines, 471 oaks, 74 others), a dense forest
characterized by relatively small and young trees. Species composition has shifted toward
greater dominance by Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) and conifers less adapted to frequent
ﬁres: white ﬁr (Abies concolor) and Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii). The reference
presettlement conditions can be applied to management of this ecosystem in two ways.
First, reference conditions are a benchmark against which to evaluate contemporary con-
ditions and future alternatives. The comparison shows that the contemporary forest is well
above the range of presettlement variability in forest density, and both live and dead fuel
structures have developed that can support high-intensity wildﬁre. Second, reference con-
ditions can serve as a goal for ecological restoration treatments.
Key words:
Arizona; ecological restoration; ecosystem management; ﬁre regime; Pinus ponderosa;
ponderosa pine; presettlement forest reference conditions.
INTRODUCTION
We present an integrated method for determining ref-
erence conditions of key ecosystem functional and
structural components in a southwestern ponderosa
pine forest prior to Euro-American settlement; then we
apply the reference data in an ecosystem management
context. Reference conditions are the range of historic
(or natural) variability in ecological structures and pro-
cesses, reﬂecting recent evolutionary history and the
dynamic interplay of biotic and abiotic conditions and
disturbance patterns (Morgan et al. 1994, Swanson et
al. 1994). These conditions form the basis for com-
parison with contemporary ecosystem processes and
structures and are a frame of reference for designing
ecological restoration treatments and conservation
plans (Covington and Moore 1992, 1994a, Grumbine
1992, Kaufmann et al. 1994, Morgan et al. 1994, Swan-
son et al. 1994). Almost no ecosystems remain undis-
turbed by industrial human society, and early historical
documentation of past conditions is commonly quite
limited, so quantifying reference conditions is a key
initial challenge for ecosystem management (Swanson
et al. 1994, Kaufmann et al. 1994, Christensen et al.
1996).
Fires recurred every 2–20 yr in southwestern pon-
derosa forests prior to Euro-American settlement
around 1870 to 1890 (comparison of 63 ﬁre chronol-

ogies in Swetnam and Baisan 1996). Fire has been a
keystone ecological process (sensu Holling 1992) reg-
ulating the density, species composition, and amount
and structure of dead biomass, maintaining open for-
ests, and promoting nutrient cycling in presettlement
ponderosa pine ecosystems (Cooper 1960, Covington
and Sackett 1990, Covington and Moore 1994a, b).
Although we recognize that Native Americans ‘‘set-
tled’’ North America long before Euro-Americans, for
the sake of brevity the term presettlement will be used
here to refer to conditions prior to Euro-American set-
tlement and the term postsettlement to refer to condi-
tions after Euro-Americans began the intensive alter-
ation of the landscape that resulted in ﬁre exclusion.
The century-long exclusion of frequent, low-inten-
sity ﬁres has led to striking and rapid changes in eco-
systems that evolved under frequent disturbance: trees
less adapted to frequent ﬁre (e.g., Abies, Pseudotsuga)
have invaded at the expense of other plants, and pine
(Pinus) tree biomass, both live and dead, has steadily
accumulated, contributing to progressively declining
herbaceous productivity, increasing susceptibility to in-
sect and disease epidemics, and supporting a shift from
frequent, low-intensity surface ﬁres to increasingly
larger crown ﬁres (Cooper 1960, Swetnam 1990, Cov-
ington and Moore 1994a, b, Kolb et al. 1994, Swetnam
and Baisan 1994). Similar deleterious changes seen in
related long-needled pine ecosystems throughout west-
ern North America (Covington et al. 1994) form much
of the impetus behind increasingly urgent calls for bi-

ological conservation, ecological restoration, and eco-
system management (Leopold 1937, Grumbine 1992,
Covington et al. 1994, Kaufmann et al. 1994, Arno et
al. 1995a).
Keystone ecosystem variables for presettlement pon-
derosa pine reference conditions include the autotro-
phic organisms (trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants)
and the predominant contagious disturbance process,
ﬁre. These variables regulate their own environment
through positive feedback interactions (sensu Perry
1995) and in turn constrain other components of the
ecosystem (sensu Holling 1992); therefore they form
the basis for management intervention.
The questions addressed by this study are: what were
the temporal and spatial patterns of presettlement ﬁre
in a Southwestern ponderosa pine forest? What was the
presettlement forest structure and how has it changed
following ﬁre exclusion and other human-caused per-
turbations? Finally, how can this information be ap-
plied to support sustainable management of South-
western ponderosa pine ecosystems?
STUDY AREA
The study area is ø700 ha of ponderosa pine (Pinus
ponderosa Dougl. ex. Laws.)–Gambel oak (Quercus
gambelii Nutt.) forest at Camp Navajo, an Arizona
Army National Guard facility 16 km west of Flagstaff,
Arizona (Fig. 1), latitude 358159 N, longitude 1118529
W. Average annual precipitation at the Flagstaff weath-
er station, elevation 2134 m, is 502.9 mm, with a dis-
tinct dry period in May and June (average 31 mm),
followed by the summer monsoon in July and August
(average 134.8 mm) (Sellers and Hill 1974). The study
area has a gently rolling topography with a single large
hill, Volunteer Mountain; elevations range from 2175
to 2453 m. Most soils are of volcanic origin but soils
derived from underlying limestone and sandstone for-
mations occur at lower elevations (Soil Conservation
Service 1970). Ponderosa pine and Gambel oak are the
dominant trees, with scattered alligator juniper (Junip-
erus deppeana Steud.). On mesic, north-facing slopes,
Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.)) and white
ﬁr (Abies concolor (Gord. & Glen.) Lindl.) are also
encountered. New Mexican locust (Robinia neomexi-
cana Gray) thickets occur in the southern part of the
study area.
Evidence of human occupancy dates from the archaic
period (ø5500 BC–AD 100) (Grenda 1993). Large-
scale timber extraction became proﬁtable when the
transcontinental railroad arrived in 1882 and logging
for ties and pilings began around 1885 (Timber Atlas,
on ﬁle at Kaibab National Forest Supervisor’s Ofﬁce,

Williams, Arizona). Livestock grazing began in the
same period. The area was transferred from mixed Na-
tional Forest and private ownership to military use in
1942 and has formed part of the undeveloped buffer
zone around the military facilities to the present.
METHODS
Quantitative procedures were selected to reconstruct
past ﬁre regimes and forest structures. Comparative
studies of ﬁre scar analysis methods concur that the
most reliable ﬁre histories in forests with low-intensity
ﬁre regimes are based on crossdated ﬁre-scarred sam-
ples from trees, stumps, and logs (Madany et al. 1982,
Baisan and Swetnam 1990). In ponderosa pine forests
where direct evidence (stumps, logs, old-growth trees)
of past forest structure still exists due to the very slow
wood decomposition rate in the absence of ﬁre, direct
measurement of presettlement-era remnant wood to-
gether with contemporary forest structure is possible
(Habeck 1990, Covington and Moore 1994a, b, Arno
et al. 1995b). We applied dendroecological reconstruc-
tion (Fritts and Swetnam 1989) in a hierarchical sam-
pling framework scaled to different forest structural
components (e.g., presettlement pine clumps, regen-
eration, coarse woody fuels) to determine reference
conditions and compare them to contemporary condi-
tions across a relatively large forest landscape.
Field sampling
A 300 3 300 m systematic sampling grid was es-
tablished in the study area and sample points were as-
sessed for suitability according to the following cri-
teria: (A) suitable soil type for ponderosa pine forest
based on Soil Conservation Service (1970) soil survey;
(B) at least 10% forest cover in presettlement times,
with ponderosa pine a dominant species, based on the
presence of presettlement-era trees, snags, stumps, or
logs; and (C) at least 20 m from a road to minimize
disturbance to living trees and dead woody material.
A total of 62 plots covering 558 ha was sampled in
1994 and 1995.
Sample plots were laid out as a series of nested plots
of different sizes. At the largest scale, ﬁre scar samples
were collected and their locations mapped (Fig. 1)
throughout each 9-ha area centered on the sampling
grid points, effectively searching the entire study area.
Cross section samples of ﬁre-scarred tree catfaces (a
lesion on the tree bole caused by repeated ﬁre scarring)
were collected from trees, stumps, or logs apparently
recording the oldest scars and/or the best preserved
record of multiple ﬁres (Baisan and Swetnam 1990).
Overstory vegetation was sampled on circular plots
400 m2 in area (11.28 m radius) centered on each sam-
ple point. Species, condition, diameter at stump height
(dsh, 40 cm above ground level), and a preliminary
ﬁeld classiﬁcation of presettlement or postsettlement
origin, were recorded for all live and dead trees .1.37
m (breast height) in height, as well as for stumps and
downed trees that surpassed breast height while alive.
Tree condition classes were assigned based on a tree,
snag, and log classiﬁcation system (Maser et al. 1979,
Thomas et al. 1979) widely applied in ponderosa pine
forests (Covington and Moore 1994a, b, Lundquist
1995). The nine condition classes (1, living; 2, declin-
ing; 3, recent snag; 4, loose bark snag; 5, clean snag;
6, snag broken above 1.37 m; 7, snag broken below
1.37 m; 8, downed; 9, cut stump) were used to deter-
mine dead tree structure and to estimate the death date
of presettlement-era snags and logs, as described be-
low. Potentially presettlement ponderosa pine trees
were identiﬁed based on size (dsh . 40 cm) or yellowed
bark (White 1985). Trees of all other species were con-
sidered as potentially presettlement if dsh . 40 cm, or
dsh . 20 cm for oaks and junipers (Barger and Ffolliott
1972). All potentially presettlement trees, as well as a
random 20% subsample of other trees, were cored with
an increment borer at 40 cm above ground level to
determine age and past size, as described below. Di-
ameter at breast height (dbh) was recorded for all cored
trees.
Seedlings or sprouts of tree species were tallied on
nested 100-m2 (5.64 m radius) plots. Stems , 1.37 m
in height were tallied on the nested 100-m2 plot by
species and condition in three height classes: (1) # 40
cm; (2) 40.1–80 cm; and (3) 80.1–137 cm. Herbaceous
and shrubby species were measured on two 1-m2 sub-
plots per plot. The frequency (presence/absence) of
dominant plants and percent herbaceous cover were
recorded. Forest ﬂoor fuels and litter and duff depths
were measured along 15-m planar intersect transects
(Brown 1974) established in random directions from
each plot center. Woody fuel biomass was calculated
using procedures in Brown (1974) and Sackett (1980).
Dendrochronology–ﬁre disturbance history
In the laboratory, ﬁre scar samples were surfaced
and crossdated (Stokes and Smiley 1968) with master
tree-ring chronologies from the region (D. A. Graybill,
unpublished tree-ring chronologies AZ521 and AZ547,
National
Geophysical
Data
Center,
World
Data
Center-A for Paleoclimatology, Boulder, Colorado).
Ring widths of all samples were measured and dating
of each sample was checked with the COFECHA pro-
gram (Grissino-Mayer and Holmes 1993). A 20% sub-
set of samples was also checked through independent
visual crossdating by another dendrochronologist. To
identify the season of occurrence of ﬁres (Baisan and
Swetnam 1990), the relative position of each ﬁre scar
within the ring was recorded using the following cat-
egories: EE (early earlywood), ME (middle early-
wood), LE (late earlywood), L (latewood), and D (dor-
mant season, scar occurring between the cessation of
latewood growth and the beginning of the next year’s
earlywood growth). Dormant scars are considered to
represent spring ﬁres in the Southwest (Baisan and
Swetnam 1990).

Fire history was reconstructed from analysis of 473
ﬁre scars from 51 ponderosa pine samples and 1 white
ﬁr sample. The majority of the samples were cut from
dead trees, but samples from several live trees brought
the ﬁre history up to 1995.
Age structure
Tree increment cores were surfaced and crossdated
(Stokes and Smiley 1968) with local tree-ring chro-
nologies (D. A. Graybill; see Dendrochronology–Live
disturbance history). Rings were counted on cores that
could not be crossdated. The accuracy of ring counting
was tested with a set of counted and crossdated pre-
settlement cores, ﬁnding a mean error of 0.9 6 2.1 yr
(mean 6 1 SD). We concluded that grouping tree ages
into 10-yr classes was reasonable. Additional years to
the center were estimated with a pith locator (concen-
tric circles matched to the curvature and density of the
inner rings) for cores that missed the pith. Tree center
dates are at the 40-cm sampling height; as few as 3 yr
(Sackett 1984) or as many as 8–10 yr (Cormier 1990)
may be required for ponderosa pine seedlings to reach
40 cm in the Flagstaff area.
Reconstruction of presettlement forest structure
The year 1883, in which the ﬁnal ﬁre of the preset-
tlement frequent-ﬁre regime occurred, was chosen as
the date for reconstruction of presettlement forest struc-
ture. Reconstruction of forest structure at an earlier date
would present greater difﬁculties because the frequent
ﬁres during this era probably consumed much rotten
woody material.
The ﬁeld determination of presettlement or postset-
tlement tree status was conﬁrmed or rejected using the
age data. Several large trees turned out to be of pos-
tsettlement origin and the data were adjusted accord-
ingly. However, no trees ﬁeld-classiﬁed as ‘‘postsettle-
ment’’ turned out to be of presettlement age. For each
cored presettlement tree, the 1883–1994 radial growth
increment was measured on the core and the 1883 di-
ameter calculated. Species-speciﬁc equations devel-
oped by Myers (1963) and Hann (1976) in the South-
west were used to estimate bark thickness and to predict
dbh based on the inside-bark diameter of stumps. Site-
speciﬁc regressions were developed from the data set
to predict dbh from dsh for all species.
The year of death of presettlement snags and logs
was estimated based on tree diameter and condition
class. Dead trees were not crossdated in this study, but
a companion study in which all dead material was
crossdated at the Gus Pearson Natural Area, ø15 km
northeast of Camp Navajo, found that all dead wood
classiﬁed in the ﬁeld as ‘‘presettlement’’ based on size
and decay was of presettlement origin (J. N. Mast and
others, unpublished data). However, direct determi-
nation of death date was precluded by sapwood rot on
almost all of those samples. Harvest dates for stumps
were determined from timber harvest and forest in-
ventory records of the Tusayan Forest Reserve (on ﬁle
in the Supervisor’s Ofﬁce, Kaibab National Forest, Ar-
izona). The records were spatially detailed and corre-
sponded well with ﬁeld observations of the high stumps
(up to 1 m) in the initially logged areas (1885) and
lower stumps in areas harvested later (1925 and 1933).
Rates of snagfall and movement from class to class
were summarized by Rogers et al. (1984) who com-
bined data from Cunningham et al. (1980) and Avery
et al. (1976) to calibrate for northern Arizona the tree
decomposition model developed by Thomas et al.
(1979). Because of high variability among substrates
and environmental conditions, as well as the extremely
long time span required for research, the dynamics of
tree decomposition are poorly understood (Harmon et
al. 1985) and mathematical models based on observed
decomposition classes are likely to be highly imprecise.
To assess the effect of such variability on the preset-
tlement forest reconstruction, a sensitivity analysis was
carried out by using three different decomposition rate
percentiles, 25, 50, and 75%, to examine the effect of
slower or faster decomposition on the estimates of
death date and 1883 structure. For example, a 65-cm
dbh snag in condition class 5 would be assigned a death
date of 1950, assuming the 50th percentile of the dis-
tribution of decomposing trees. At the 25th and 75th
percentiles, the assigned death dates would be 1906
and 1976, respectively. Presettlement forest structure
based on each of the three percentiles was calculated
to determine the relative effect of model imprecision.
To determine the 1883 diameter of dead trees, growth
estimates for the period from 1883 to death date were
subtracted from the measured diameter, adjusted for the
loss of bark where appropriate. In the case of ponderosa
pine, where an increment core data set adequate for
modeling was obtained in the study, a site-speciﬁc pre-
dictive regression relationship between diameter and
basal area increment was developed for presettlement
trees (r2 5 0.70). As is often the case, pine diameter
proved to be an inadequate predictor of radial incre-
ment (r2 5 0.07). For other species, published diameter-
dependent growth regression equations were applied to
determine 1883 diameter (Rogers et al. 1984).
A potential source of error in this reconstruction ap-
proach is missing presettlement-era woody material,
which would lead to an underestimate of presettlement
forest density. Fire consumption of wood was con-
trolled as much as possible by selecting 1883, the year
of the last widespread ﬁre on the site, as the recon-
struction year. Complete decomposition of heartwood
or other resinous woody material in the absence of ﬁre
is likely to take longer than 112 yr (1883 to 1995) due
to the very slow decomposition rate of ponderosa pine
(Jenny et al. 1949, Hart et al. 1992), as evidenced by
the many sampled and crossdated ﬁre-scarred stumps,
harvested ø1885, collected in this study. Juniper and
Douglas-ﬁr wood is also highly resistant to decay.
Gambel oak and white ﬁr may decompose more quick-

ly, often beginning with heart rot in the living trees
(Barger and Ffolliott 1972, Burns and Honkala 1990),
but old oak and ﬁr stumps and logs were also found
on sample plots. Some wood removal may have oc-
curred in slash disposal, but this rarely affects the
stumps and root crowns needed for presettlement re-
construction.
Because small-diameter pines rot quickly (Harmon
et al. 1985, Arno et al. 1995b), it could be argued that
small trees or even doghair thickets that were alive in
the settlement year but died soon thereafter would be
missed. However, there is no evidence in historical ac-
counts, photographs, or early inventories for the ex-
istence of numerous small trees in presettlement north-
ern Arizona—quite the contrary (Cooper 1960). Nor
does it seem likely that such thickets could have be-
come established under frequent ﬁre regimes (White
1985). Finally, there is no reason to believe that such
trees would have died in high numbers following ﬁre
exclusion, especially in light of the remarkable persis-
tence of small trees in stressed postsettlement doghair
thickets (Schubert 1974, Avery et al. 1976, Ronco et
al. 1985, White 1985). In sum, while the possible un-
derestimation of some small presettlement trees that
left no trace cannot be dismissed, such trees are un-
likely to have formed a substantial component of pre-
settlement forest structure.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis of the ﬁre history data was carried
out with the FHX2 ﬁre history analysis software de-
veloped by Grissino-Mayer (1995). The areal extent
and intensity of presettlement ﬁres are difﬁcult or im-
possible to reconstruct in ecosystems characterized by
frequent, low-intensity ﬁre where forest stand bound-
aries do not correspond with ﬁre edges (Swetnam and
Dieterich 1985). However, relative ﬁre extent and/or
ﬁre intensity within the sampled area can be inferred
to some degree from the percentage of samples scarred
and their spatial distribution. Therefore, ﬁre return in-
tervals were analyzed statistically in different subcat-
egories. First, all ﬁre years, even those represented by
a single scar, were considered. Then only those ﬁre
years were included in which 10% or more, and 25%
or more, respectively, of the recording samples were
scarred.
Statistical comparison of the 1883 and contemporary
forest structure was carried out with the SYSTAT soft-
ware (Wilkinson 1988). Alpha level for all analyses
was 0.05. Multivariate analysis of variance (Tabach-
nick and Fidell 1983:222–291) was used to determine
differences in mean density, basal area, and quadratic
mean diameter on the entire set of tree species. If a
signiﬁcant difference was found between the presettle-
ment and contemporary forests (Wilks’ lambda statis-
tic), then Bonferroni-adjusted univariate F statistics
were compared by species.
RESULTS
Fire disturbance history
Fire was frequent in the period 1637–1883, with a
mean ﬁre return interval (MFI) of 3.7 yr, but only a
single ﬁre scar, in 1951, was recorded after 1883 (Fig.
2). The year 1637 was selected as the initial year for
ﬁre history analysis because it was the earliest ﬁre year
deemed to have an adequate sample depth (5 recorder
trees, ø10% of the total sample size) to conﬁdently
evaluate ﬁre occurrence (Grissino-Mayer et al. 1994).
The statistical analysis of ﬁre return intervals in Ta-
ble 1 includes the mean ﬁre interval (average number
of years between ﬁres), the median, and the Weibull
median probability interval (WMPI), used to model
asymmetrical ﬁre interval distributions and to express
ﬁre return intervals in probabilistic terms (Johnson
1992, Grissino-Mayer 1995). All three measures of
central tendency over the 1637–1883 period were in
close agreement and distributions were asymmetrical,
positively skewed with a clumped distribution of short
ﬁre return intervals and fewer long intervals.
Spatial patterns of ﬁre were inferred from the sim-
ilarity of MFI values from both the all-scar and 10%-
scar distributions, 3.7 and 4.6 yr, respectively, and iden-
tical median value of 4 yr for both (Table 1). The mea-
sures of central tendency in the 25%-scar distribution,
possibly representing more widespread ﬁres, are only
ø1.5 times greater than the all-scar and 10%-scar dis-
tributions (Table 1) and no signiﬁcant difference in ﬁre
return intervals or percentage of scarring for the ﬁre
interval distributions between the north and south
halves of the study area over the period 1684–1883.
Fire years were not statistically independent in the
north and south and, in all but the 25%-scar distribu-
tion, the number of synchronous dates was signiﬁcantly
greater than the number of asynchronous dates. Over-
all, these results support the inference of a spatially
homogeneous ﬁre regime, consistent with the lack of
topographic or vegetative barriers to ﬁre spread on the
site and the fact that ﬁres could have persisted for ex-
tended periods in the absence of ﬁre suppression ac-
tivities.
The presettlement ﬁre regime was also temporally
homogeneous. No statistically signiﬁcant differences
were found in ﬁre interval means, variances, or distri-
butions in the periods 1637–1759 and 1760–1883, al-
though the ﬁre history overlapped with the major re-
gional climatic trend, the Little Ice Age, a period of
warming beginning from a cold extreme in 1600 until
1850 (D’Arrigo and Jacoby 1991). The lack of signif-
icant long-term ﬁre regime change appears to corre-
spond with the short-term nature of climatic ﬂuctua-
tions within this period (Meko et al. 1995). On a shorter
time scale, however, ﬁre occurrence appeared to be
linked to annual climatic factors, with ﬁres occurring
in the study area during some of the largest presettle-
ment regional ﬁre years in the Southwest, based on a

the period 1700–1900 (Swetnam and Baisan 1996).
Fires burned at Camp Navajo in 8 of the 20 major
regional ﬁre years; in the top two regional years, 1748
and 1851, ﬁres scarred 63 and 44%, respectively, of
the recording sample trees. Climatic inﬂuences over
broad geographic regions are considered responsible
for this synchrony (Swetnam and Baisan 1996).
Seasonal data on ﬁre occurrence (Table 2) showed
that ø40% of presettlement ﬁres occurred in the spring
(approximately late April to June [Baisan and Swetnam
1990]) and 60% in the summer (July to early Septem-
ber), without evidence of burning during latewood for-
mation. This seasonal pattern is consistent with re-
gional ﬁre weather and lightning ignition patterns
(Swetnam and Baisan 1996). Fire season could not be
determined on ø40% of the scars (Table 2), often due
to narrow rings, possibly biasing the seasonal deter-
mination toward years in which better conditions for
tree growth led to wider rings.
Changes in forest structure
Pine and oak density increased signiﬁcantly and pine
quadratic mean diameter decreased signiﬁcantly from
1883 to 1994 (Table 3). The average density of pon-
derosa pine was 65.3 trees/ha with quadratic mean di-

ameter of 41.6 cm in 1883, as compared with 720.2
trees/ha and quadratic mean diameter of 22.8 cm in
1994; pine basal area increased from 11.7 to 18.2 m2/
ha. Thus the pine population has changed from fewer,
larger trees to numerous, smaller trees (Fig. 3). Density
and basal area of oaks both increased (Table 3). Other
species had such low and variable occurrence that no
statistically signiﬁcant changes were observed, al-
though all trended toward increasing density. Living
presettlement-era trees comprise only 7% of contem-
porary tree density but make up 33.9% of contemporary
basal area despite their sparse distribution.
New Mexican locusts found on the study area were
small and young, so no estimation of presettlement
locust density could be made and locust was excluded
from the totals in Table 3. However, New Mexican
locust does sprout readily following removal of over-
story pines (Gottfried 1980) and dense locust thickets
were observed surrounding old pine stumps, suggesting
that locust density has increased since 1883.
The sensitivity analysis on modeling of tree decom-
position showed that estimates of 1883 tree density
were robust. Only under the slowest modeled decom-
position conditions, the 25th percentile, were a few
trees assigned death dates prior to 1883 (3 out of 54
dead presettlement trees, 5.6%) and no death dates prior
to 1883 were calculated using the 50th and 75th per-
centiles, leaving the estimated 1883 forest density un-
changed. Estimates of tree size in 1883 were also rel-
atively robust. The 25th percentile model estimated the
1883 basal area at 13.7 m2/ha, a 7% increase above the
50th percentile model, while the 75% percentile model
estimated the 1883 basal area at 12.4 m2/ha, a 4% de-
crease. The narrow range of differences in estimated
1883 structure, compared with the wide differences in
decomposition rate percentiles and associated tree
death dates, indicates that the 1883 reconstruction is
relatively insensitive to decomposition model impre-
cision.

that the contemporary forest is dominated by relatively
smaller, younger trees. Large pulses of tree establish-
ment (Fig. 4) occurred in the late 19th century for oaks
(1885–1914) and in the early 20th century for pines.
Given 3–10 yr to reach the 40-cm sampling height,
many of the pines in the largest center-date class (1935–
1944) may have originated in the 1920s. Contemporary
woody seedling density (Table 4) is highly variable but
averages several thousand stems per hectare, mostly
oak and locust.
Grasses were the dominant herbaceous understory
plants in the contemporary forest, followed by com-
posites, legumes, and sedges (Table 5). All identiﬁed
species were native to northern Arizona. Percentage
cover by herbaceous species averaged 19%.
Changes in tree and grass structure over the mid-
twentieth century are illustrated in Fig. 5. The 1942
photograph, the earliest available scene from Camp
Navajo, a few kilometers southeast of the study area,
shows a very open forest structure with many stumps
after railroad logging in the 1920s. Herbaceous plants
were dense but numerous patches of pine seedlings are
evident, corresponding with the large increase in pine
establishment during this period (Fig. 4). By 1995 the
same site was dominated by small-diameter pines with
an apparent decrease in herbaceous density (Fig. 5,
bottom).
Contemporary dead woody biomass was highly vari-
able on the study site (Table 6) but forest ﬂoor depth
was more consistent. In terms of potential ﬁre behavior,

these fuel data imply that continuous fuels to carry the

while heavy fuels that may support intense ﬁre behavior
occur in scattered patches.
DISCUSSION
Context of changes in ﬁre disturbance regime and
forest structure
The beginning of effective ﬁre exclusion in the study
area after 1883 is coincident with the construction of
the transcontinental railroad across northern Arizona
from 1882 through 1884 and the initiation of heavy
commercial logging in the region (Cline 1994). The
date is also consistent with the cessation of frequent
ﬁres throughout most of the Southwest by 1900, with
a substantial decline in ﬁre occurrence beginning in the
1870s and 1880s (Swetnam 1990, Swetnam and Baisan
1996). Heavy livestock grazing was associated with ﬁre
exclusion at Chimney Spring, ø15 km east of the study
area (Dieterich 1980). The date of initiation of livestock
grazing at Camp Navajo is not known, but nearby Rog-
ers Lake was impounded to water livestock in 1878
(Grenda 1993).
Comparing presettlement forest structure to that of
nearby areas, presettlement pine and oak densities on
the study area were greater than the 43 pines/ha and 4
oaks/ha found by Covington and Moore (1994a) at
Bar-M Canyon, but pine density was close to the 61
pines/ha at the Gus Pearson Natural Area (Covington
et al., in press). Presettlement pine density at the study
area also falls within the range of 7 to 116 pines/ha
reported in several early National Forest inventories
and other studies in the region (see Covington and
Moore [1994b] for comparison). In particular, Woolsey
(1911) reported a mean of 26 pines .15.2 cm dbh per
hectare on ‘‘average’’ stands in timber-sale areas on
the Tusayan National Forest (which then included the
study area) and a mean density of 85 pines .10.2 cm
dbh per hectare on ‘‘maximum’’ stands in the adjacent
Coconino National Forest. The 1883 Camp Navajo re-
construction is within this range with 61 pines/ha
.15.2 cm dbh and 63 pines/ha .10.2 cm dbh. There
is no evidence in the reconstructed forest structure data
that dense stands existed in the study area: the maxi-
mum presettlement tree density was 500 trees/ha,
,40% of the mean contemporary tree density of 1265
trees/ha (Table 3).
Relatively high densities of small-diameter oaks
were observed in the 1883 forest, comprising 94% of
all trees under 10 cm dbh. Because Gambel oak is a
proliﬁc sprouter but highly susceptible to ﬁre, es-

with numerous scattered stumps and logs from railroad logging in the 1920s. In the background, especially at right center,
dense patches of small seedlings can be seen. The full crowns of the residual trees suggest that the stand was probably not
very dense even prior to logging. (Navajo Army Depot Collection, Cline Library, Northern Arizona University). Bottom: 15

the area. Grassy openings remain, but herbaceous density appears to be substantially less than in 1942.

PONDEROSA PINE REFERENCE CONDITIONS
pecially small-diameter trees (Harrington 1985), it is
likely that many or most of these small trees would
have been thinned had ﬁres continued after 1883. The
density of oaks .5 cm dbh, 48 oaks/ha, or the density
over 10 cm dbh, 33 oaks/ha, may be more represen-
tative of the long-term average oak density under a
continuing frequent ﬁre regime.
The increase in density of all tree species at the study
area by 1994 is consistent with the structural changes
in ponderosa pine ecosystems since Euro-American
settlement in Arizona (Cooper 1960, White 1985, Cov-
ington and Moore 1994a, b) and in related long-needled
pine ecosystems throughout western North America
(Covington et al. 1994, Arno et al. 1995b). The con-
temporary density of ponderosa pine is very close to
the 1985 Arizona average of 776 trees/ha (Garrett et
al. 1990), but less than the 1900 ponderosa pines/ha
reported by Covington and Moore (1994a) at Bar-M
Canyon, and well below the 3098 pines/ha at the Gus
Pearson Natural Area where logging, thinning, and ﬁre-
wood cutting have been excluded (Covington et al., in
press). Contemporary oak density (Table 3) is over
three times greater than the 156 oaks/ha at Bar-M Can-
yon (Covington and Moore 1994a) and higher than oak
densities averaging 138–182 oaks/ha in a central Ari-
zona ponderosa forest (Barger and Ffolliott 1972). Ju-
niper density at the study area is lower than the 27
junipers/ha at Bar-M Canyon (Covington and Moore
1994a) and lower than the average of 88 junipers/ha
in central Arizona (Barger and Ffolliott 1972).
In the northern part of the study area, adjacent to the
railroad, the impact of early logging may have been a
factor in limiting pine establishment. On the 15 north-
ern plots, presettlement pine stump density averaged
33 stumps/ha, while living presettlement trees averaged
3 trees/ha. The heavy pine removal at the end of the
19th century may have eliminated seed sources and
precluded the regeneration ﬂushes that followed good
regional seed years such as 1919 (Schubert 1974).
However, the period of favorable moisture conditions
in the Southwest extended from 1905 to 1928 (D’Arrigo
and Jacoby 1991). Later logging in the southern part
of the study area (ø1933), could have damaged seed-
lings, contributing to the relatively late pine regener-
ation pulse (Fig. 4). These effects of pine logging may
explain the relatively slow increase in ponderosa pine
basal area from 1883 to 1994 despite the manyfold
increase in tree density as well as the relatively high
proportion of oak in the contemporary forest.
Ecosystem management
1. Comparison to contemporary conditions.—The
reference presettlement conditions can be applied to
management of this ecosystem as (1) a benchmark
against which to evaluate contemporary conditions and
future alternatives (Kaufmann et al. 1994, Swanson et
al. 1994), and (2) a goal for ecological restoration treat-
ments (Covington et al., in press). Taking the 1883
forest structure as the reference condition, the contem-
porary structure has tree densities far higher than the
mean and increased variability in both absolute and
relative terms (Table 3). The mean 1994 density of
720.2 pines/ha is well outside even the 99th percentile
of the 1883 pine distribution (1883 mean 1 3 standard
deviations 5 231 pines/ha) and pine densities on the
sample plots in 1883 ranged from 0 to 250 pines/ha,
as opposed to the broader range of 0 to 6250
pines/ha in 1994.
Mesic conifer density has increased. Although some
presettlement-era mixed conifer forest existed on the
north-facing slopes of Volunteer Mountain, no preset-
tlement Douglas-ﬁr and only two presettlement white
ﬁrs were encountered on the sampling plots. By 1994
these species made up 5% of the total tree density and
dominated the north-facing slopes, with white ﬁr reach-
ing a maximum density of 2225 ﬁrs/ha.
Contemporary forest ﬂoor fuel loading is probably
higher than in presettlement times. With ﬁres occurring
every 3–6 yr in presettlement times, small-diameter
woody fuels would have been consumed quickly. Larg-
er diameter rotten woody fuels would have been con-
sumed as well (Covington and Sackett 1984). In con-
trast to presettlement conditions, currently there is am-
ple fuel to support high-intensity ﬁre behavior, includ-
ing torching through live fuel ladders and crown ﬁre,
in hot, dry, windy weather. However, herbaceous fuel
loading is probably greatly reduced in the contempo-
rary forest.
Presettlement regeneration patterns may be inferred
to some extent from the age structure of living pre-
settlement trees (Fig. 4). White (1985) argued that pre-
settlement pine regeneration would most likely have
required ‘‘safe sites,’’ such as in the ash bed left by a
completely consumed log, until seedlings grew above
the lethal scorch height of a fast-moving surface ﬁre.
Ponderosa pine regeneration is also linked to sporadic
periods of favorable climatic conditions, even if fa-
vorable establishment sites exist (Savage and Swetnam
1990). Under such limitations, the relatively normal
distribution of presettlement pine diameters may be
explained by the few establishment opportunities for
seedlings, but the high survivorship among young
trees, which grew above the lethal effect of the ﬂames
and beneﬁted from uncrowded growing conditions
(Fig. 3).
Postsettlement woody regeneration patterns (Table
4) are likely to differ from presettlement patterns on
the study area, because herbaceous competition has
been reduced or eliminated, ﬁre has not played a role
in thinning, harvesting has preferentially removed
pines, and the relatively dense canopy may favor shade-
tolerant species.
2. Ecological restoration.—Although restoration to
conditions resembling those of presettlement times is
not necessarily a feasible or desirable management goal
on all forest lands (Kaufmann et al. 1995), managers

906
PETER Z. FULE´ ET AL.

of the Camp Navajo study area have agreed that an
ecosystem management approach based on restoration
of ecosystem function and structure similar to that char-
acteristic of recent evolutionary history (Covington et
al. 1994) is consistent with the training uses and buffer
zone function of this site. Detailed description of eco-
logical restoration in southwestern ponderosa pine for-
ests requires an extended treatment (Covington et al.,
in press; W. W. Covington, unpublished manuscript)
but key points are summarized here.
The challenge for management is to conserve exist-
ing presettlement-era resources, design treatments that
restore ecosystem structure, and permit the reintroduc-
tion of frequent, low-intensity ﬁres. These are not sim-
ple tasks. Even conservation of living presettlement
trees presents problems: growth rates of old ponderosa
pine trees at the Gus Pearson Natural Area have slowed
sharply, despite the exclusion of logging and grazing
and without evidence of changing climate (Sutherland
1983, Kolb et al. 1994, Biondi et al. 1994, in press).
These authors suggested that a primary cause of mor-
tality of old trees is increased stress from competition
with dense thickets of younger trees following ﬁre ex-
clusion. Reintroduction of ﬁre without fuel treatment
can also kill old-growth trees. Experimental prescribed
ﬁres beginning in 1976 at Chimney Spring, ø15 km
northeast of Camp Navajo, led to mortality of .35%
of the living presettlement pines, attributed to the lethal
temperatures produced at the root collars of old trees
by slow smoldering consumption of accumulated fuels
(Harrington and Sackett 1990).
The underlying premise of restoration ecology is that
ecosystems function best under the conditions to which
they adapted over evolutionary time (Swanson et al
1994). In the case of southwestern ponderosa pine, the
open, park-like forests, productive herbaceous under-
story, and frequent ﬁre regime are key characteristics
of this long-term evolutionary environment. Applying
the reference condition data as a guide, we suggest that
restoration treatments (Covington et al., in press)
should include (1) establishment of permanent moni-
toring plots for evaluation and modiﬁcation of treat-
ments in an ‘‘adaptive ecosystem management’’ frame-
work (Walters and Holling 1990); (2) restoration of
overstory structure by conserving living presettlement
trees and replacing dead presettlement trees; (3) pro-
tection of old trees from excessive cambial heating by
reducing fuels around the boles; (4) reintroduction of
ﬁre disturbance through prescribed burning; and (5)
restoration of the herbaceous and shrub understory
through seeding or planting of native species where
natural regeneration is inadequate.
We expect the balance of ﬁre and vegetation in the
restored ecosystem to ultimately return to the self-reg-
ulating patterns and rhythms of the presettlement forest
because the keystone natural mechanisms controlling
structure and function will be able to operate. However,
while extensive information exists on the small-scale
(plot-level) response of woody and herbaceous plants
to thinning and burning, the effectiveness of an inte-
grated large-scale (landscape-level) restoration treat-
ment in ponderosa pine forests has only begun to be
examined (Covington and Moore 1994a, Arno et al.
1995a, Covington et al., in press). Continued moni-
toring of these treatments is essential and on-going
management intervention and adaptive new approaches
will be necessary over time as we evaluate and learn
from our ﬁrst attempts at restoration and ecosystem
management of landscapes.
