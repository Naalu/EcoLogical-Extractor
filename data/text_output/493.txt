For many forest plant species, basic data on
the ecology of seed populations are incomplete.
However, these data may have many important
applications. For example, information about
seed production and inputs to soil seed banks
can assist land stewards as they formulate
plans for vegetation management activities such
as site rehabilitation, ecological restoration, or
weed control. Data on seed parasitism and
predation can help scientists to model food
web interactions or long-term plant popula-
tion growth. Finally, horticulturists need infor-
mation regarding germination of desirable
species and factors that affect seed viability.
Ceanothus fendleri Gray (Fendler ceano-
thus) is a small shrub common in ponderosa
pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of the south-
western United States and Rocky Mountains
(Epple 1995). Like its congeners, C. fendleri is
a nitrogen-fixer (Story 1974, Conard et al. 1985)
and provides important functional and struc-
tural qualities in understory communities. It is
particularly valuable as wildlife browse, although
intensive herbivory by native ungulates such
as mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and Rocky
Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus) can reduce
stem length, leaf area, and flower production
(Huffman and Moore 2003). Clusters of white
flowers appear in early spring and provide an
important resource for invertebrates. Con-
straints on flower production resulting from
intensive herbivory indirectly affect abundance
and richness of invertebrate assemblages (Huff-
man unpublished data). In the absence of her-
bivory, flower production can be prolific, and
this lends an ornamental quality desirable for
urban landscaping.
C. fendleri fruits are 3-celled capsules that
ripen August–September (Kearney and Peebles
1964). Seeds are dark brown and about 2 mm
in diameter. Limited data suggest that Fendler
ceanothus seeds have some level of innate
dormancy (Story 1974, Krishnan 1989). Obser-
vations of seedling emergence after prescribed
fire suggest that dormant seeds remain viable
in soil seed pools until scarified by heat or
other disturbance (Vose and White 1987, Huff-
man and Moore 2004). A large proportion of
an annual seed crop may be consumed by pre-
dispersal, chalcidoid parasites (Huffman 2002).
No detailed information presently exists con-
cerning postdispersal seed fate or rates of seed
predation.
In this research I studied annual rates of C.
fendleri flower, fruit, and seed production;
ovule loss; and seed germination. My specific
objectives were to determine the following: (1)

PRODUCTION, LOSSES, AND GERMINATION OF CEANOTHUS FENDLERI
SEEDS IN AN ARIZONA PONDEROSA PINE FOREST
David W. Huffman1
ABSTRACT.—I quantified seed production and ovule losses for Ceanothus fendleri Gray (Fendler ceanothus) plants
protected from large ungulate herbivores in a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa [Laws]) forest of northern Arizona. I also
tested seed germination responses to cold stratification and heat treatments in the laboratory. Fruit production on
fecund stems ranged from 7.4 to 38.2 fruits per stem, which equated to 22.2–118.2 potential seeds based on 3 ovules per
fruit. Stems that produced fruit were significantly large relative to their expected sizes. Predispersal ovule losses ranged
from 70.7% to 91.4% across the 2 years studied. A chalcidoid seed parasite (Eurytoma squamosa Bugbee) consumed
11%–28% of the total number of seeds produced. Postdispersal seed predation varied from 0% to 24% and was signifi-
cantly affected by forest floor substrate in 1 study year. Cumulative ovule losses were estimated to be 71%–92%. Cold
stratification did not significantly affect seed germination, and exposure to 90ºC resulted in the highest germination per-
centage. Both dormant and nondormant seeds suggested a bet-hedging life history strategy. This study provides basic
ecological information important for management of ponderosa pine forest and nursery production of C. fendleri.
Key words: Fendler ceanothus, seed ecology, ovule losses, seed predation, heat scarification, bet hedging.

METHODS
Study Site
I studied C. fendleri seed production at the
Fort Valley Experimental Forest about 10 km
northwest of Flagstaff, Arizona. The area re-
ceives around 52 cm of precipitation annually
with distinct dry periods in May and June.
Precipitation falls in late summer as rain from
monsoonal thunderstorms and in winter as
snow. The study area was located from 2225 m
to 2380 m above mean sea level. Aspect was
generally southern, and topography was gentle
with average slopes of approximately 5%–10%.
Soils were moderately deep clay loam, classi-
fied as Typic Argiborolls and Mollic Eutro-
boralfs, and developed on tertiary basalt (Miller
et al. 1995).
Seed population studies were conducted
within 3 nearly pure ponderosa pine manage-
ment units (~15 ha each) undergoing ecologi-
cal restoration treatments. Restoration treat-
ments included overstory thinning and pre-
scribed fire. Thinning was completed in 1998–
1999. Overstory stand densities in the forest
units were 140–242 trees ⋅ha–1 and basal area
was approximately 15.6–22.3 m2 ⋅ha–1 (Fulé et
al. 2001). Prescribed burning was done in 2000
and 2001. Common understory species included
grasses such as Arizona fescue (Festuca arizon-
ica Vasey), mountain muhly (Muhlenbergia mon-
tana [Nutt.] A.S. Hitchc.), bottlebrush squir-
reltail (Elymus elymoides [Raf.] Swezey), and
pine dropseed (Blepharoneuron tricholepis
[Torr.] Nash); forbs such as lupine (Lupinus
spp.), fleabane (Erigeron spp.), buckwheat (Eri-
ogonum spp.), yarrow (Achillea millifolium L.),
and pussytoes (Antennaria spp.); and shrubs
such as C. fendleri and woods rose (Rosa
woodsii Lindl.). Large mammalian herbivores
present on the site included mule deer (Odo-
coileus hemionus) and Rocky Mountain elk
(Cervus elaphus). Domestic livestock were ex-
cluded from the study site.
Flower, Fruit, and 
Seed Production 
In early spring 1999, I located 60 C. fendleri
shrubs (180 total) in each of the 3 forest units
described above. Shrubs comprised 1 to many
stems in a patch and patches were generally
<2 m in diameter. I randomly assigned 30
shrubs in each forest unit (90 shrubs total) to
be protected from large herbivores. Shrubs
were surrounded by wire mesh exclosures, 2 
2 m in area and 1.4 m in height. Flower, fruit,
and seed production of C. fendleri stems were
examined in 2000 and 2001 on 1-m2 plots
centered on these protected plants. Due to
impacts of prescribed fire, implemented in
association with forest restoration activities, I
did not sample all plots in both years; sample
sizes were 73 and 58 plots in 2000 and 2001,
respectively.
Plots were examined for flowering stems in
June of each year. Length, diameter, and age
class were recorded for flowering stems found
on these plots each year (Huffman and Moore
2003). In July I identified all stems with fruits.
In 2000 all stems bearing fruit were sampled,
but in 2001 fruit production was prolific and
fruiting stems were randomly sampled at a rate
of 50%. For each sampled stem, number of fruits
and dehisced receptacles were counted. To
estimate seed production, fruits were sur-
rounded with nylon mesh (mesh size < 2 mm)
“traps” that caught seeds as they were dispersed.
In 2000 all stems bearing fruit were fitted with
seed traps. In 2001 stems randomly selected
for measurement were fitted with seed traps.
In late August of both sample years, seed
trap contents (seeds, debris, and fruit remain-
ing on stems) were collected and taken to the
laboratory for analysis. Seeds collected from
traps were separated from plant debris and
counted. Seeds were classified as developed
or undeveloped. Developed seeds were approx-
imately 2 mm in diameter with smooth, full
seed coats and were glossy brown in appear-
ance. In contrast, undeveloped seeds were
typically smaller than 2 mm, flattened, and
had wrinkled, yellowish seed coats.
Seed Parasitism 
Developed seeds collected in traps were
examined under a dissecting scope (10–20
power) for parasite emergence holes or other
signs of damage. All developed seeds were
dissected to determine embryo condition and
presence of parasite larvae or pupae. A small
sample (n = 10) of undeveloped seeds were
also dissected. To identify seed parasites, I 
monitored (1999–2001) seeds collected from

C. fendleri shrubs growing on microsites adja-
cent to the restoration units. Adult parasites
emerging from seeds were captured and pre-
served in 70% isopropyl alcohol. Specimens
were sent to Dr. Robert Zuparko at the Cali-
fornia Academy of Science (CAS), San Fran-
cisco, California, and to the USDA Systematic
Entomology Laboratory (SEL; specimens iden-
tified by E. Eric Grissell, Research Entomolo-
gist), Bethesda, Maryland, for identification.
Data for predispersal seed parasitism in 2000
were presented in Huffman (2002).
Seed Predation
To obtain rates of postdispersal seed preda-
tion, I quantified removal of C. fendleri seeds
(collected 1999) from experimental seed depots
at the Fort Valley site in September 2000 and
2001. Seed predation transects, 250 m in length,
were systematically established in the 3 forest
units. Transects were located near C. fendleri
plots and systematically oriented in directions
that assured they remained within the forest
restoration units (i.e., transects did not extend
into adjacent forest areas). At 50-m intervals (5
points) along transects, seed depots were
established and C. fendleri seeds were placed
on substrate-filled petri dishes. To investigate
how seed predation varied with substrate, 2
dishes at each seed depot were filled with
charred forest floor substrate and the other 2
with unburned ponderosa pine needles. Charred
forest floor substrate was collected on-site
from forest units that had been burned with
prescribed fire. Ten C. fendleri seeds were
placed on the substrate surface of each dish.
In 2001 an additional dish of each substrate
was added to randomly selected points along
each transect, and sunflower (Helianthus sp.)
seeds were placed on these. Sunflower seeds
were added to indicate seed predator activity
and relative preference for C. fendleri seeds;
sunflower seeds were presumed to be pre-
ferred by many generalist seed predators (C.
Chambers, School of Forestry, Northern Arizona
University, personal communication).
Seed depots were left in place for 8–10
days. At collection, petri dishes were covered
and transported to the laboratory for analysis.
Seeds remaining in dishes were sieved from
substrate and counted to determine the num-
ber removed at depots.
Seed Germination
To provide a general characterization of C.
fendleri seed germination traits, seeds were
collected from 4 sites near Flagstaff, Arizona:
(1) Bear Jaw Canyon (BJ), (2) Dutton Hill (DH),
(3) Fort Valley (FV), and (4) Obsidian Tank (OT).
The sites were separated by at least 21 km and
ranged in elevation from 2219 m to 2306 m.
Two of the sites (DH and OT) had experienced
wildfires between 1975 and 1985, and no over-
story trees were present. One site (BJ) had an
open overstory of ponderosa pine as a result of
thinning and prescribed fire in the mid-1980s.
Seeds collected at the Fort Valley site were
found in areas of open overstory conditions
near a main road and hiking trail outside the
experimental forest units used in seed produc-
tion studies. Ceanothus fendleri capsules were
collected from each of the 4 sites in late August
2001 just prior to natural dehiscence and seed
dispersal. Capsules from at least 5 shrub patches
per site were collected and stored in paper
bags until processed. In the laboratory, seeds
were separated from capsules by gently grind-
ing with a mortar and pestle. Ten seeds were
separated from each of the 4 collections and
randomly assigned to 1 treatment of a 6 (tem-
perature)2 (cold stratification) factorial design.
Additionally, because parasite infestation is
difficult to determine from seed appearance
(Huffman 2002), 5 samples of 9–17 seeds each
were separated from each of the 4 seed collec-
tion sites and dissected as previously described.
Rates of parasitism and filled seed were re-
corded. Temperatures tested were the follow-
ing: no heat, 50ºC, 70ºC, 90ºC, 110ºC, and
130ºC. Seeds were heated for 10 minutes in
an electric drying oven following the proce-
dures described above. Each treatment was
replicated 3 times per site. Treatment replica-
tion was defined as separate application of
heat. Seeds were then either cold-stratified or
left unstratified. Unstratified seeds were placed
on moistened filter paper in petri dishes and
germinated in a controlled incubation cham-
ber (Percival Scientific, Inc., model 1500). Day
length and temperature in the chamber were
set at 14 hours and 30ºC, respectively. Full-
spectrum, fluorescent lighting was provided
during day periods. Night length and temper-
ature were 10 hours and 20ºC, respectively.
Seeds were examined approximately every 2
days until germination was completed (about
2006]

24 days). Germination was defined as success-
ful if radicals extended beyond the seed coat
by at least 2 mm. Stratified seeds were placed
between moistened filter papers in petri dishes
and allowed to imbibe water at room tempera-
ture (about 20ºC) for 24 hours. Petri dishes
were then sealed in black plastic and placed in
a cooler at approximately 4ºC for 60 days. After
this period, unstratified seeds were germi-
nated as described above.
Germinability of undeveloped seeds was
tested by separating 100 seeds from each of
the Dutton Hill and Fort Valley collections.
Lots of 50 seeds each were randomly assigned
to either heat treatment (90ºC) or control (no
heat). Germination tests followed the proce-
dures described above.
Data Analysis
Percentage of stems that produced flowers
was calculated for individual plots, and means
were reported for all sampled plots pooled
among the 3 overstory units. Chi-square tests
were used to analyze distributions of fruiting
stem sizes versus sizes of all stems in the pop-
ulation (i.e., stems on all sampled plots; Devore
and Peck 1986). Normality of stem size distri-
butions was assessed using normal probability
plots. Stem length and diameter data were
separated into 13 classes for analysis. A proba-
bility level of 0.05 was used to determine signi-
ficant deviation from chi-square critical values.
Linear regression was used to examine re-
lationships between fruit and seed production
in 2001 and between stem length and diame-
ter. Data were natural-log transformed when
residual plots showed increasing variance with
increasing values of the independent variable.
Relationships were considered significant when
P < 0.05.
Mann-Whitney nonparametric tests were
used to test differences in number of seeds
removed from charred forest floor and unburned
pine litter substrates in the postdispersal seed
predation experiments. A probability level of
0.05 was used for tests of statistical signifi-
cance.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to
test for main effects (P < 0.05) of cold stratifi-
cation (2 levels) and temperature (6 levels) fac-
tors on seed germination. Collection site was
used as a blocking factor in the ANOVA model.
Seed germination values were square-root,
arcsine transformed to improve normality and
homogeneity of variances. When main effects
were found, Bonferroni post hoc tests were
used to compare mean differences between
factor levels (Kuehl 1994). Means were not ad-
justed for parasitism or unfilled seeds, although
rates of soundness obtained from dissections
were considered in interpretation of results.
RESULTS
Flower, Fruit, and 
Seed Production
Ceanothus fendleri flower and fruit produc-
tion generally increased over the 2 years of
sampling. Mean percentage of stems that pro-
duced flowers was 19% (sx– = 3.4) and 30% (sx–
= 5.0) in 2000 and 2001, respectively. For
fecund stems, mean number of fruit produced
per stem was 7.4 (sx– = 3.2) in 2000 and 39.4
(sx– = 7.4) in 2001. Chi-square goodness-of-fit
tests indicated that observed fruiting stems
were large relative to their expected sizes (Fig.
1). No stems <20 cm in length were observed
bearing fruit, although these sizes represented
11% of the total stems on plots. Similarly, 
no stems <2.5 mm in basal diameter fruited,
yet they represented 23% of the population.
Although fruiting stems were relatively large,
number of fruits produced per stem was not
linearly related to stem length (P>0.05). A very
weak positive relationship (r2 = 0.06, P = 0.02)
existed between fruit production and stem
diameter.
Patterns of seed production followed those
for fruiting. In 2000, seed-bearing stems pro-
duced 14.4 (sx– = 7.8) total seeds per stem on
average. This represented a 35% ovule loss
from the potential number of seeds when based
on 3 ovules per fruit (Kearney and Peebles
1964; Table 1). Of the total seeds produced in
2000, the majority were undeveloped (Table
2). Dissections of undeveloped seeds showed
either no embryo present (i.e., unfilled seed)
or small flattened embryos. The other source
of substantial ovule loss in 2000 was parasi-
tism by a chalcidoid wasp (Eurytomidae: Eury-
toma squamosa Bugbee; Table 2). Parasitized
seeds from which wasps had emerged were
hollow. On average 1.9 (sx– = 1.6) sound seeds
were produced per stem in 2000, an amount
that represented a predispersal ovule loss of
91.4% based on seed production potential
(Table 1).
368
WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST
[Volume 66

In 2001 an average of 90.9 (sx– = 26.8) total
seeds per stem were produced. Similar to pat-
terns in 2000, this number represented a 23%
ovule loss from the potential seed number
based on fruit production (Table 1). As in 2000,
parasitism and failure to develop were major
sources of ovule loss in 2001 (Table 2). Num-
ber of sound seeds produced in 2001 averaged
34.6 per stem (sx– = 11.6), an amount that rep-
resented a predispersal loss of 70.7% based on
seed production potential (Table 1).
Similar to fruit production, linear regres-
sion analysis showed no linear (P > 0.05) rela-
tionship between total numbers of seeds pro-
duced and stem length. A weak (r2 = 0.09, P
= 0.005) positive relationship was found be-
tween number of seeds produced per stem and
stem diameter.
Post-dispersal Seed 
Predation
In 2000 few C. fendleri seeds were removed
from seed depots in the 3 experimental
restoration units. I found no significant (P >
0.05) difference in counts of seeds removed
from charred forest floor or unburned litter
substrate (Table 3). Seed removal averaged
1.0% (sx– = 1.0) across all samples.
In 2001 significantly (P < 0.05) more seeds
were removed from dishes containing charred

forest floor substrate than those with unburned
litter (Table 3). On charred forest floor sub-
strate, nearly one-fourth of C. fendleri seeds
were removed whereas removal on unburned
litter was less than 3%. Discarded C. fendleri
seed coats at depots suggested that seed pred-
ators, probably rodents, immediately consumed
seeds as they found them. Although low sam-
ple size made sunflower seed removal patterns
difficult to assess, trends appeared to be simi-
lar to those observed for C. fendleri. No sun-
flower seeds remained in any dish containing
charred forest floor substrate whereas about
one-third of the seeds escaped predation in
dishes containing unburned litter (Table 3).
Seed Germination
Cold stratification did not affect C. fendleri
germination, but pregermination heat treat-
ment was a significant factor in the ANOVA
model. No interaction was found between
stratification and heat treatment.
Seeds exposed to 70ºC and 90ºC for 10
minutes had significantly greater germination
than seeds receiving the no-heat treatment and
those exposed to 50ºC, 110ºC, or 130ºC (Fig.
2). Not all seeds displayed innate dormancy,
and 13% of seeds in the no-heat treatment
germinated. No seeds exposed to 130ºC ger-
minated. Further, seeds classified as “undevel-
oped” in production studies did not germinate
regardless of whether or not they were sub-
jected to heat treatment.
Dissection of random seed samples showed
dramatically different conditions between the
4 collection sites (Table 4). For example, para-
sitized and otherwise unfilled seeds comprised
57%–84% of the total number of seeds from BJ
and OT sites. In contrast, over 75% of the seeds
from DH and FV sites were sound. Estimates
of germination percentage adjusted for sound
seed were 17%, 3%, 41%, 50% 27%, and 0%
for no heat, 50ºC, 70ºC, 90ºC, 110ºC, and
130ºC, respectively.
DISCUSSION
Factors Affecting 
Seed Production
Production of C. fendleri fruits and seeds
increased by more than 1 order of magnitude
from 2000 to 2001. These seed production pat-
terns may have resulted from increases in
stem size and leaf area developing over time
since overstory thinning in 1998–1999. In
addition, variation in seed production is also
driven by genetic and climatic factors. Vari-
ability in fruit production has been linked to
precipitation for other species of Ceanothus in
chaparral ecosystems (Keeley 1977, Keeley
1987, Zammit and Zedler 1992). In my study,
the year 2000 was droughty during the grow-
ing season (63% of long-term average Janu-
ary–September [Western Regional Climate
Center 2003]) whereas precipitation in 2001
was closer (91%) to the long-term average for
the site. Thus, variation in seed production
was likely a response to combined factors of

I found that fruit and seed production was
positively, but weakly related to C. fendleri
stem size. Similarly, Zammit and Zedler (1992)
found that shrub size was the primary deter-
minant of seed production for desert ceano-
thus (C. greggii Gray). Greater numbers of
large stems in C. fendleri populations will likely
increase the potential for population growth
following ecological restoration treatments.
Ovule and Seed Losses
Differences between potential (i.e., fruiting)
and actual seed production (i.e., both undevel-
oped and developed seeds) suggested that about
1 C. fendleri ovule per fruit failed to develop
(33% failure). Ovules are commonly lost as a
result of herbivory and predispersal predation
(Furniss et al. 1978). Otherwise, ovule losses
are thought to be linked to deficient pollina-
tion, resource limitation, or both (Stephenson
1981). During field measurements, I observed
fruit damage that appeared to be consistent
with predation by invertebrates, but I was not
able to directly measure these ovule losses.
Predispersal parasitism was variably important
in further reducing the number of viable seeds.
Rates of filled seed and parasitism for seeds
trapped in 2000 were presented in Huffman
(2002). The chalcidoid wasp, Eurytoma squa-
mosa, was the only predispersal seed parasite
found. Parasitic wasps of the Eurytoma genus
are known to feed on seeds of several Ceano-
thus species and members of the Rhamnaceae
family (Bugbee 1967, Bugbee 1971, Furniss
and Krebill 1972, Furniss et al. 1978, Huffman
2002, Michael Gates, Systematic Entomology
Laboratory, personal communication).
Incomplete seed ripening was another con-
sistently important source of predispersal seed
loss in both study years. Dissection and germi-
nation tests confirmed that seeds classified as
undeveloped were not viable. Rates of annual

seed abortion for other Ceanothus species range
from 33% to 86% and may vary with resource
availability, carbohydrate reserves, or plant
age (Keeley 1977, Furniss et al. 1978, Zammit
and Zedler 1992).
Postdispersal seed predation was a variably
(2%–24% of dispersed seeds) important source
of seed loss. Although I did not attempt to
determine identities of seed predators, dis-
carded seed coats left at depots suggested that
rodents were responsible for some predation
that resulted in seed mortality. Rodents such
as Tamias cinericolis, T. dorsalis, Peromyscus
maniculatus, and Neotoma spp. are common in
these forests and have been implicated in high
rates of ponderosa pine seed predation (80%)
on similar sites (Compton 2004). Further, my
results suggest that seeds dispersed onto fine
substrate such as charred forest floor may be
easier for seed predators to locate than those
on coarse substrate such as pine litter. Similar
effects have been reported for Ceanothus in
chaparral ecosystems where vertebrate seed
predators had difficulty locating seeds buried
beneath plant litter (Mills and Kummerow
1989). My results suggest that C. fendleri seeds
may be an important resource in food webs of
ponderosa pine forests in northern Arizona. It
follows that intense herbivory (e.g., by Rocky
Mountain elk) that leads to substantial reduc-
tions in flower and seed production may affect
energy flow and species distribution in these
ecosystems.
Seed Germination
Seed germination results suggested that C.
fendleri utilizes a dormant-seed regeneration
strategy. Many Ceanothus species require heat
to allow opening of seed coats, although a few
show adverse response to heating (Hadley 1961,
Quick and Quick 1961, Gratkowski 1974, Reed
1974, Keeley 1977, Conard et al. 1985). In other
ecosystems Ceanothus seeds are thought to
remain viable in soil for decades (Gratkowski
1974, Keeley 1977). Longevity of C. fendleri
seeds under field conditions is not known,
although its seeds can remain viable in dry
storage for >40 years (Huffman unpublished
data). Seed dormancy may confer a reproduc-
tive advantage when fire both stimulates ger-
mination and increases the abundance of safe
sites for seedling establishment (Keeley 1977,
Huffman and Moore 2004). In this study I
found that germination of seeds that received
no heat treatment was 13%. Further reproduc-
tive advantage may be gained from this bet-
hedging strategy wherein seed cohorts com-
prise both dormant and nondormant seeds.
Such a strategy may allow persistence of C.
fendleri populations in understory environ-
ments that are temporally variable in terms of
disturbance and safe site availability.
Implications
Results of this study suggest that manage-
ment activities encouraging development and
maintenance of large stems are likely to in-
crease seed production of C. fendleri. Such
activities include overstory thinning, pre-
scribed fire, and protection from large herbi-
vores (Huffman 2003, Huffman and Moore
2003, Huffman and Moore 2004). However,
climatic variability is likely to affect annual
production, and prediction of population trends
should include several years of monitoring. In
some years a substantial percentage of devel-
oped seeds may be lost to predispersal para-
sites or postdispersal seed predators, and this
may lead to short-term limitations on regener-
ation (Andersen 1989). Seed dissection and X-
ray analysis could help determine proportion
of infested seed.
Seed dormancy may allow accumulation of
C. fendleri seeds in soil seed banks, which in
turn may facilitate population recovery after
disturbance. Similarly, prescribed fires of low
severity may increase C. fendleri abundance.
Ecologists and land managers interested in C.
fendleri seed banks can apply heat treatments
to samples in order to stimulate viable seeds.
Heat scarification of field-collected seeds will
likely increase germination success.
