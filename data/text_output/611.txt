Abstract
The objective of this paper is to present recommendations for fuels treatments in ponderosa 
pine forests in the Southwest, Colorado Front Range, and Black Hills of South Dakota. We 
have synthesized existing knowledge from the peer-reviewed literature and administrative 
studies and acquired local knowledge through a series of discussions with fuels treatment 
practitioners. We describe specific treatments, the circumstances under which they can be 
applied, and treatment effects. We provide recommendations related to where, how, and how 
often fuels treatments may be prescribed to achieve desired outcomes. Desired outcomes 
address social, political, economic, and ecological factors. 
Key words: southwest, Black Hills, ponderosa pine, wildfire, forest thinning, prescribed fire

Executive Summary
This comprehensive status of knowledge summary of fuels treatment practices in ponderosa 
pine forests of the Black Hills, Front Range and Southwest is the final report of Joint Fire Science 
Program Project 05-S-03. The authors gratefully acknowledge the support and encouragement 
of the Joint Fire Science Program Board of Directors and staff in completing this publication.
Historically, fire has been important in shaping the vegetation composition, succession, and 
structure of forests throughout the western United States. Low elevation ponderosa pine 
forests have been particularly vulnerable to altered fire regimes and much of the wildland-
urban interface in the west is found among or adjacent to this forest type. In the past, relatively 
frequent low-severity surface or mixed-severity fires burned throughout ponderosa pine forests. 
Fire acted as a natural restorative agent by reducing litter, removing unhealthy trees, snags, 
and woody debris, thinning small trees, and creating diversity in landscapes at a spectrum of 
scales.
Over the past century and a half, changes in forest structure, understory and overstory 
conditions, fuel biomass conditions, and fire frequency have created a situation where large, 
infrequent, and intense fires are now the norm. Fire research has shown that physical setting, 
fuels, and weather combine to determine fire behavior. Recent research has addressed the role 
of stand and fuel structure to reduce wildfire behavior, severity, and extent. Although the need 
to restore historical disturbance processes is now recognized, management practices to assist 
hazardous fuels treatment project design and implementation have not yet been developed for 
fuels treatments in ponderosa pine forests.
The objective of this paper is to present management recommendations for fuels treatment 
based on a synthesis of existing knowledge acquired from the literature and the expertise of 
practitioners. We bring the expertise of fire scientists and managers in the Southwest, Colorado 
Front Range, and Black Hills of South Dakota together in a collaborative effort to produce a 
reference that provides science-based decision support for ongoing fuel reduction activities in 
ponderosa pine forests of these regions. We document specific conditions and practices where 
management intervention is appropriate to reduce fuels hazards while attempting to restore the 
forest community to a more natural condition. To achieve these goals, we have synthesized 
existing knowledge from the peer-reviewed literature and administrative studies, and acquired 
local knowledge through a series of interviews and discussions with local fuels treatment 
practitioners. We describe specific treatments, the circumstances under which they can be 
applied, and the expected reductions in fuels hazard. We provide recommendations related to 
where, how, and how often fuels treatments may be prescribed to achieve desired outcomes. 
Desired outcomes address social, political, economic, and ecological factors. Finally, deficits in 
the existing knowledge are identified.

istorically, fire was a keystone ecological process 
that shaped the composition and structure of plant 
communities across the extensive range of ponderosa 
pine forests (refer to Appendix B for scientific names of 
species listed in text). Relatively frequent, low-intensity 
surface fires acted as a natural thinning agent by reduc-
ing litter, burning small trees, and reducing ladder fuels. 
These fires were largely limited to the understory, killed 
few mature pines, and created an uneven-aged struc-
ture composed of small, relatively even-aged groups. In 
some parts of the range of ponderosa pine, small-scale 
stand-replacing fires were also historically significant 
components of the disturbance regime.
Fire suppression, grazing, and intensive forest man-
agement over the past 100+ years have altered forest 
structure to eliminate much of this diversity, creating 
uniformly stocked landscapes of even-aged stands, 
many of which are densely stocked or contain dense 
understories of regeneration. As a result, contemporary 
wildfires have increased in severity across the range of 
ponderosa pine. The dispersal of private land holdings 
throughout publicly managed lands further complicates 
fuel treatment efforts. Fire exclusion has had other 
negative effects, including increased susceptibility of 
ponderosa pine forests to outbreaks of mountain pine 
beetle (MPB). Large-scale MPB outbreaks may further 
dramatically increase fuel loadings and the severity of 
fire effects.
Creation of forest structures resistant to crown fire 
initiation and bark beetle attack and spread is an in-
creasingly important objective of forest management in 
ponderosa pine communities. Forest managers must in-
tegrate social, political, and economic values, in addition 
to ecological considerations, when evaluating fuels and 
restoration treatments. In many cases, ecological res-
toration and wildfire hazard reduction can be achieved 
simultaneously, but in other cases, these goals may be 
conflicting. In this document, we highlight areas where 
these goals may not be fully compatible and discuss how 
goals associated with restoration and fuel reduction can 
still be incorporated in management practices. Although 
prescribed fire and mechanical fuels treatments have 
been used in varying degrees across the extensive range 
of ponderosa pine forests, comprehensive management 
practices have not yet been described for fuels treat-
ments. Nor have these treatments been evaluated in 
terms of landscape-scale hazard and risk reduction.
The intent of this publication is to develop manage-
ment practice recommendations for fuels treatment 
activities in Southwest, Colorado Front Range, and 
Black Hills ponderosa pine. While the range of ponde-
rosa pine forests is much larger (fig. 1) we focus our 
discussion on this region as it reflects the broad scope 
of historical fire regimes and forest structure seen in 
ponderosa pine forests. Recommendations are based on 
collaboration of research and managerial experience. It 
has been a joint effort between RMRS staff and collabo-
rators at Colorado State University, University of Idaho, 
and University of Florida using shared data, expertise, 
and resources obtained from interviews with fire spe-
cialists in the Southwest, Front Range, and Black Hills. 
This multi-faceted approach involved all collaborators 
and used both published data and information from cur-
rent management activities and other sources to identify 
appropriate management practices that can both reduce 
immediate fuels hazards and restore attributes of histori-
cal forest conditions in ponderosa pine forests.
Spatial Scales
The large and catastrophic wildfires found in many 
ponderosa pine forests today pose significant direct 
threats to humans and structures, as well as many natural 
resources considered valuable to humans, including water 
resources, wildlife habitat, recreation areas, and so forth. 
Restoration and fuel reduction treatments in ponderosa 
pine systems should focus on reducing the likelihood 
of catastrophic wildfires impacting values at risk while 
improving or maintaining the ecological integrity of the 
system. To effectively achieve this, restoration and fuel 
reduction treatments should be conceptualized at multi-
ple scales, from local stands to landscapes. On the stand 
level, treatment prescriptions should be designed to re-
duce fuel loading to a level that will reduce the potential 
for spread of crown fire. To ensure long-term ecosys-
tem sustainability, this is best achieved in the context of 
the historical stand structure and processes. Forests are

managed for many resources that are more appropriately 
addressed at spatial scales larger than individual stands. 
Forested landscapes, for example, are usually composed 
of a mosaic of forest stands, which vary in fuel manage-
ment and restoration needs.
Even though many areas across ponderosa pine land-
scapes may have deviated from historical conditions 
and thus be in need of restoration or fuel management, 
there are likely to be significant economic and logisti-
cal constraints to treating all areas. In addition, other 
management objectives, such as protection of sensitive 
wildlife habitat or structures in urban settings, may ne-
cessitate prioritization of restoration and fuel treatments 
across landscapes. Management needs vary across the 
landscape, thus what is done is just as important as where 
to do it. Therefore, spatial planning is critical for effec-
tiveness in restoration, hazardous fuel reduction, and 
meeting other resource management objectives across 
ponderosa pine landscapes. In this comprehensive man-
agement practices guide, we include effective strategies 
for planning and implementing restoration and fuel re-
duction treatments at both landscape and stand scales. 
While the information in this guide is specific to the 
ponderosa pine type in the southwestern United States, 
Front Range of Colorado, and Black Hills of South 
Dakota, many aspects would be applicable in ponderosa 
pine forests found in other regions.
Integrated Approach
A wealth of information on various aspects of resto-
ration and fuel reduction treatments in ponderosa pine 
forests is available in peer-reviewed literature, gov-
ernment reports, and other publications. However, this 
information has yet to be summarized in a comprehen-
sive guide to restoration and fuel reduction treatments in 
ponderosa pine forests. In addition, many effective strat-
egies for restoration and fuels reduction commonly used 
by managers remain undocumented and known only to 
the local practitioners who use them. We attempted to 
capture and document this information through a series 
of discussions with fire and fuel managers from various 
land management agencies throughout Arizona, New 
Mexico, Colorado, and South Dakota. To obtain a broad 
range of perspectives, we also spoke with a variety 
people from different organizations including research-
ers, state and private foresters, and conservationists. 
Appendix C provides a list of people we interviewed. 
We used information gained from the literature, discus-
sions with practitioners and interested parties, as well as 
our own expertise to develop recommendations for man-
agement practices for restoration and fuels treatments in 
ponderosa pine forests of the Southwest, Front Range, 
and Black Hills.
Background
Ponderosa pine forests in many western states cur-
rently have the potential to burn with much higher fire 
intensity than they would have 100 years ago (Brown 
and Cook 2006; Covington and others 1994; Kaufmann 
and others 2003). This is largely because of manage-
ment and land use practices throughout the 19th and 20th 
centuries, particularly those that lead to alteration of nat-
ural fire regimes. While past management practices have 
played a dominant role in altering natural fire regimes, 
changing climate throughout the 19th and 20th centuries 
has also been significant (Westerling and others 2006). 
Knowledge of the historical fire regime and resultant 
forest structure is thus important as it represents the 
conditions under which plant and animal populations in 
these forest communities have evolved and provides a 
standard for restoration (Swetnam and others 1999). A 
complete return to pre-Euro-American settlement con-
ditions may not always be desirable or even possible 
given today’s societal needs and attitudes toward forests 
and the possibility of a changing climate. However, pre-
settlement forest structure does provide a benchmark for 
which current, unsustainable forest conditions can be 
compared. In cases where historical fire regimes were 
dominated by frequent, low intensity fires, altering cur-
rent forest structure such that it more closely resembles 
historical forest structure should lead to forests that are 
ultimately less susceptible to large-scale crown fires 
and safer for the reintroduction of prescribed fire. The 
historical fire regimes, past land use and management ac-
tivities, and current forest structure and its implications 
for current fire regimes and other ecological attributes 
are all presented in Section II—Fire and Fuels Issues.
While reduced risk of severe wildfire spread is gener-
ally the primary objective of fuel reduction treatments, 
many other resource management objectives can be met 
concurrently. In many ponderosa pine forests, restoration 
as a general rule is conducive to hazardous fuel reduc-
tion. When restoration is not a specific objective, other 
natural resource objectives, such as wildlife habitat or 
watershed health improvement or protection, can also 
be met in fuel reduction treatments without significantly 
compromising the objective of reducing wildfire hazard. 
Specific objectives that can be considered in restoration 
and fuel treatments are presented in Section III—Fuel 
Treatment Objectives. Several tools can be used to 
meet these objectives, including prescribed fire and me-
chanical, chemical, and biological treatments. However, 

4

certain techniques will be more appropriate than oth-
ers depending on the specific treatment objectives. 
Techniques and tools used to successfully achieve fuel 
treatment, restoration, and other resource objectives are 
presented in Section IV—Fuel Treatment Techniques.
Fuel treatments alone are not always effective in 
meeting resource management objectives. Many factors 
need to be considered in the planning stages to ensure 
effectiveness. Part of the challenge of implementing 
effective fuel treatments is overcoming other resource 
limitations or logistical constraints, such as limited time 
and funding. While restoration and fuel treatments are 
often meant to improve the health of forested systems, 
they can also have adverse effects on other resources 
or values, such as sensitive species habitat. The effec-
tiveness of various treatments in meeting objectives, 
resources needed to complete effective treatments, and 
limitations on use of various treatments are presented in 
Section V—Fuel Treatment Requirements.
It is also possible that additional work may be needed 
to offset the effects of some fuel treatment activities. 
Examples may include control of invasive species or 
excess tree regeneration, or modifying activities for sen-
sitive plants or wildlife habitat. Techniques for mitigating 
various undesirable consequences of fuel treatment ac-
tivities are discussed in Section VI—Fuel Treatment 
Impacts, Mitigation, and Monitoring.
Throughout our discussions with managers, we en-
countered many different approaches to achieving the 
same resource management objectives. Despite these 
differences, we noticed that successful treatments 
seemed to be accomplished when managers adhered 
to some common principles. We attempt to summarize 
those commonalities here as “management principles” 
that should be considered in any management program. 
In the final section of the document, we present several 
over-arching themes that we believe should be para-
mount in any fuel reduction or restoration treatment in 
ponderosa pine forests.

umans and natural processes, such as climatic 
cycles and geologic substrates, have shaped pon-
derosa pine landscapes for long periods of time. In some 
cases, human impacts have been subtle and localized; 
while in other cases they have been profound and ex-
tensive. The latter impacts, in particular, have altered 
current vegetation structure, which in turn influences 
how disturbances such as fire are currently manifested 
in the landscape. It is imperative for managers to have an 
appreciation for how natural processes and humans have 
shaped forest structure and disturbance processes in the 
past. Understanding the historical influences of humans 
and natural processes on the landscape is vital for plan-
ning and implementing land management practices 
under a wide range of conditions. We provide that con-
text in this section by discussing how different groups of 
people (Native Americans and Euro-Americans) shaped 
landscapes in the past. We then discuss how forest struc-
ture and fire regimes have varied with natural changes 
in climate and topography. Finally, we discuss how past 
management practices and natural factors have shaped 
current forest conditions and disturbance regimes in the 
Southwest, Front Range, and Black Hills.
Past Land Use and Management 
Activities
Southwest
Humans began settling the southwestern United 
States at least 12,000 years ago, but their populations 
probably did not reach large numbers until 2000 to 1000 
B.C. when cultivated plants spread throughout the region 
and societies shifted from nomadic to agrarian (Allen 
2002). It is estimated that 100,000 Native Americans 
occupied the upper Rio Grande Valley of New Mexico 
at the height of their population. Similar numbers of 
people settled in other population centers throughout the 
Southwest (Parker 2002).
These Native Americans likely had substantial im-
pacts on forest structure around their large settlements. 
For example, as many as 200,000 trees of ponderosa 
pine, Engelmann spruce, and subalpine fir harvested 
up to 75 km from the population center were used for 
construction of pueblos at Chaco Canyon, a large settle-
ment in northern New Mexico (Betancourt and others 
1986). However, the imprint Native Americans had on 
forest structure in other areas was likely somewhat lim-
ited. Native Americans did venture into ponderosa pine 
forests throughout the region for hunting and gathering. 
Historical accounts suggest they intentionally set fires 
to these forests for purposes of herding game, clearing 
travel routes, improving forage production, or warfare 
(Allen 2002). While these actions certainly increased the 
frequency with which fires burned in some areas (Baisan 
and Swetnam 1997; Kaye and Swetnam 1999), it is not 
likely that these human ignitions significantly altered 
the natural fire regime over landscape or regional scales 
given the high frequency of lightning-caused fires in the 
Southwest (Allen 2002).
Euro-American and Hispanic settlers left a much 
more significant imprint on the landscape than Native 
Americans when they began settling in the region in 
large numbers in the late 1800s. Upon their arrival in 
the Southwest, they introduced domesticated sheep and 
cattle to the ponderosa pine forests to take advantage 
of the abundant forage in the open forest understory. 
While limited grazing began earlier in the 19th cen-
tury in certain areas (Savage and Swetnam 1990), the 
number of livestock on the range exploded throughout 
the region around 1880 (Denevan 1967; Dutton 1953). 
There were an estimated 4 million sheep in the state of 
New Mexico by 1880 (Denevan 1967) and 200,000 in 
the San Francisco Peaks area of Northern Arizona in 
1887 (Friederici 2003). With the rangeland largely open 
and unregulated, overgrazing became rampant (Cooper 
1960; Denevan 1967; Kaufmann and others 1998). The 
ubiquitous overgrazing, coupled with a severe drought in 
the 1890s lasting several years, caused substantial reduc-
tions in grass cover and changes in species composition 
in the understory of ponderosa pine forests throughout 
the region (Arnold 1950; Cooper 1960; Dutton 1953; 
Weaver 1951). By the 1910s, more active grazing man-
agement began with the creation of the Forest Service 
(Allen 1989; Kaufmann and others 1998). While sheep 
grazing has declined over the years, cattle grazing has 
continued in the 1990s on public and private lands in 
the Southwest with 0.5 million head in Arizona and  
Section II:

1.2 million head in New Mexico grazing annually 
(Dahms and Geils 1997).
Other significant land use and management ac-
tivities common in the Southwest throughout the 20th 
century include commercial logging and fire suppres-
sion. Commercial logging began in the region around 
the same time that large-scale livestock grazing was 
initiated (Allen 1989; Friederici 2003; Kaufmann and 
others 1998). The level of timber extraction increased 
steadily throughout the 20th century and peaked in 1990 
with roughly 433 million board feet extracted from 
public and private forests in Arizona and New Mexico 
in 1 year (Covington 2003). Due to lack of large trees, 
changing economic conditions, and increasing envi-
ronmental concerns, commercial timber harvest levels 
have declined in much of the region since 1990, but 
such programs have remained active in certain areas 
(Friederici 2003). Organized fire suppression also began 
in the Southwest with the creation of the Forest Service 
in the 1910s (Pyne 2004). The road network created 
to aid timber harvest throughout the 20th century has 
also greatly improved firefighting efficiency (Dahms 
and Geils 1997) while concurrently increasing acces-
sibility and the potential for human caused ignitions. 
With the exception of some extensive and long-term 
wildland fire use programs (for example, Gila National 
Forest, Grand Canyon National Park, Saguaro National 
Park), most wildland fires in the Southwest continue to 
be suppressed (Covington 2003).
Colorado Front Range
Nomadic Native Americans traveled through the 
Rocky Mountains of Colorado beginning 10,000 to 
15,000 years ago (Buchholtz 1983). However, it was 
not until 650 to 1000 A.D. that the Ute, Arapaho, and 
Cheyenne began settling in the Front Range more per-
manently, returning to the mountains from the plains 
each summer to take advantage of the abundant game 
(Buchholtz 1983; Peet 1981). While Native American 
populations throughout the Rocky Mountains reached up 
to 30,000 (Baker 2002), populations were much smaller 
in Colorado, probably peaking around 2,500 to 10,000 
in the 1700s (Baker 2002; Buchholtz 1983). Early Euro-
American settlers of Colorado recounted widespread 
intentional burning by Native Americans (Veblen 2000). 
However, the reliability of these accounts has been ques-
tioned (Baker 2002). While Native Americans certainly 
used fire for herding game in this region (Buchholtz 
1983; Peet 1981), given their low population density, 
they were not likely to have had a significant impact on 
the historical fire regime in the ponderosa pine forests of 
the Front Range (Baker 2002).
Euro-American settlers were first lured to Colorado 
by the discovery of gold in the late 1850s (Buchholtz 
1983; Rueth and others 2002). Thousands of prospec-
tors from all over the country descended upon Colorado 
and towns such as Boulder, Golden, and Denver boomed 
overnight. Extensive cattle grazing and logging soon 
followed on the Front Range to support the rapidly 
growing population and industry (Veblen and Lorenz 
1986; Veblen 2000). Historical photographs reveal that 
disturbance in the Front Range forests during this period 
was severe and extensive (Veblen and Lorenz 1991). 
Forests in the montane zone (including ponderosa pine 
and mixed conifer forests) were extensively logged and 
miners routinely set fires to these forests to facilitate 
prospecting (Veblen and Lorenz 1986, 1991). Although 
a rather large number of old trees still exist, few old-
growth forests remain in the montane zone of the Front 
Range today (Kaufmann and others 2000).
With the creation of the Forest Service and the Park 
Service in the early 1900s, sustainable management of 
natural resources became a priority. Effects of rampant 
logging, human caused fires, and over-grazing started to 
lessen with tighter management of these activities and 
the beginning of the era of fire suppression (Brown and 
others 2000; Veblen and Lorenz 1991). Since the 1960s, 
both logging and cattle grazing have decreased dramati-
cally throughout the region (Veblen and Lorenz 1991). 
Although prescribed fire programs began in the 1970s, 
implementation has been limited in extent (Pyne 1997). 
Suppression of wildfires has occurred throughout the 20th 
century and most wildfires continue to be suppressed in 
the region. Because of its proximity to the largest cities 
in Colorado, the forested montane zone has been one of 
the most heavily used areas in the state for recreation 
(Myers 1974).
Black Hills
Native Americans inhabited the Dakotas in large 
numbers as early as 1500, although there is no evidence 
of these cultures living in the Black Hills during that 
time (Froiland 1990). Many groups lived near the Black 
Hills in the 1600s and 1700s including the Cheyenne, 
Kiowa, and Arapaho (Froiland 1990). However, they 
were likely to have only occasionally ventured into the 
forests of the Black Hills to harvest minimal amounts of 
forest products (Froiland 1990; Gartner and Thompson 
1973). In addition, these groups most likely preferred 
the open habitat and abundant game in the nearby plains 
(Gartner and Thompson 1973) and thus were not likely 
to have had an impact on the historical fire regime of the 
Black Hills. These groups left the region in the 1780s 
when they were forced westward by the Sioux (Froiland 

USDA Forest Service RMRS-GTR-198.  2007	
7
1990). The Sioux likely used the interior of the Black 
Hills to a greater extent, as early explorers found evi-
dence of Native American presence in the Black Hills 
in the 1870s (Progulske 1974). There is some evidence 
that suggests the Sioux disrupted the natural fire regime 
in the foothills of the Black Hills by intentionally setting 
fires to herd game (Fisher and others 1987).
Word of the discovery of gold in the Black Hills in 
1874 quickly spread to Euro-Americans in the east and 
they soon migrated to the region in large numbers forc-
ing Native Americans to move out of the Black Hills 
(Froiland 1990). In addition to mining resources, the 
region also offered abundant timber, game, and forage 
for livestock, and these resources were soon extracted to 
support the growing population. With no land manage-
ment agency in place, these resources quickly became at 
risk of depletion. Many large game animals including bi-
son, pronghorn, and elk were eliminated from the Black 
Hills around this time. By the early 20th century, much 
of the Black Hills had been logged (Raventon 1994) 
and as a result, very few old growth forests remain to-
day (Boldt and Van Deusen 1974). To curb the rampant 
use of resources by early settlers and manage resource 
extraction, in 1897 the Black Hills forest reserve was 
created. With the creation of this reserve, the first of its 
kind in the United States, suppression of wildfires began 
in the Black Hills (Raventon 1994).
Today, the Black Hills National Forest is the most 
intensively managed national forest in the country, has 
the highest allowable timber sale quantity of any forest 
in the Rocky Mountain region, and supports extensive 
livestock grazing. However, the method and degree of 
resource extraction has changed dramatically since the 
days of the early explorers. Although unmanaged log-
ging, grazing, and hunting were common practice in the 
late 1800s and early 1900s (Froiland 1990; Raventon 
1994), timber harvests and livestock numbers are close-
ly managed today (USDA Forest Service 1994). Some 
of the game species eliminated in the early 1900s have 
been reintroduced in the Black Hills (Raventon 1994). 
Habitat management for these populations is currently 
a priority (USDA Forest Service 1994). The practice 
of suppression continues, but acknowledgment of the 
ecological importance of fire and its potential benefit 
to different resources has led to increasing use of pre-
scribed fire.
Fire Regimes
Many characteristics can be used to describe a fire re-
gime. The characteristics we consider in this document 
are fire frequency, magnitude, extent, and seasonality. 
Frequency can be thought of as the number years be-
tween fire events in a given area. Magnitude is often 
described as fire intensity or the rate of release of energy 
along a flaming front. However, since fire intensity can 
be difficult to measure, magnitude can also be assessed 
through fire severity, which can be thought of as the 
magnitude of the effects of fire on dominant organisms. 
For example, in high-severity fire regimes, the effect of 
the fire may be the killing of dominant trees over large 
areas in a stand-replacing event. In a low-severity fire 
regime, the effect of a fire may be relatively benign to 
most organisms not resulting is substantial mortality. In 
a mixed-severity fire regime, the effects of a fire may 
be a diverse array of severe and benign effects. The dis-
tinction between mixed- and high-severity fire regimes 
is often partly a function of the extent or scale of high-
severity patches (Agee 1998).
The historical fire regime (prior to Euro-American 
settlement) and resultant forest structure of ponderosa 
pine forests is a useful reference as it reflects the states 
and processes under which many of the plant and ani-
mal populations found in these forests have evolved 
(Swetnam and others 1999). Thus, restoring the histori-
cal structure and processes of ecosystems to the extent 
possible provides the best alternative for sustainable 
ecosystem management.
Depending upon the region, ponderosa pine forests 
historically burned with frequent low- to more infre-
quent mixed-severity fire regimes, depending upon the 
region. Restoring historical fire regimes in many cases 
should therefore reduce the risk of high-severity wild-
fires. However, in areas where historical fire regimes 
may have been composed of infrequent, small-scale and 
patchy crown fires, restoration may not be fully con-
ducive to reducing wildfire hazard. In such cases, fuel 
treatments that focus on creating conditions that promote 
low-intensity surface fires may reduce wildfire hazard, 
but may not have an ecological justification.
In forested systems, dendroecology is the most wide-
ly used tool for reconstructing historical fire regimes. 
Dendroecology applies dendrochronology, or the dat-
ing of tree rings, to ecological questions (Fritts and 
Swetnam 1989). Ponderosa pine trees are particularly 
adapted to the use of dendroecology to reconstruct fire 
histories. Ponderosa pine has thick bark that allows it 
to survive low-intensity surface fire and trees are able 
to grow new rings over injuries caused by fire, creat-
ing fire scars. By examining fire scars in the annual 
growth rings on individual trees and comparing them 
with established tree ring chronologies, the years, and 
in some cases, the season in which a fire burned, can 
be determined.

Fire scars represent an incomplete record of fire his-
tory since some fires do not scar every tree. However, 
by examining fire scars on multiple trees within a stand 
or in several stands, mean fire return intervals (MFI), or 
the mean number of years between recorded fires, can be 
calculated at multiple scales. Fire historians often calcu-
late different estimates of MFI based on the number of 
trees in a stand that record fire, for example, at least 25 
percent of trees or just a few trees in a stand (Swetnam 
and Baisan 1996). The former is likely to represent more 
extensive fires that may have had a greater ecological ef-
fect on the landscape than the latter, which may indicate 
more localized fires.
Dendrochronology can also be used to reconstruct the 
historical stand structure of forests (Brown and Cook 
2006; Moore and others 2004). The occurrence of high-
severity fires can be determined by examining the age 
of trees that likely initiated in unison following such an 
event (Johnson and Gutsell 1994).
There are other sources of information commonly 
used to determine historical fire regimes. For example, 
historical accounts and photographs of early settlers can 
be used to characterize historical forest structure when 
lack of tree ring evidence makes dendroecological stud-
ies difficult. Such accounts can also be used to augment 
findings from tree ring studies. In addition, evidence of 
past wildfires can be recorded as deposits of ash and 
charcoal in lake beds. These deposits can also be extract-
ed to determine extent and timing of past fire events.
Fire history studies in ponderosa pine forests have iden-
tified disturbance patterns that are synchronous across 
broad spatial scales (Swetnam and Baisan 1996). These 
disturbances are likely driven by regional climatic pat-
terns that influence fuel accumulation and fuel moisture. 
Deviations from regional scale patterns have also been 
seen on local scales (Madanay and West 1983; Touchan 
and others 1996). For example, a higher or lower histori-
cal fire frequency can be a function of Native American 
burning, isolation of ridge tops, or other factors (Kaye 
and Swetnam 1999; Madanay and West 1983). Fire re-
gimes also tend to vary with topographical features such 
as elevation, aspect, and steepness of slope. This varia-
tion in fire regimes likely created landscapes that were 
naturally heterogeneous in structure and disturbance pro-
cesses. This heterogeneity is important for maintaining 
biodiversity (Reice 1994). Thus, in fuel and restoration 
treatments, it is imperative to have an appreciation for 
the range of variability in fire regimes and historical 
forest structure in both time and space within a given re-
gion and to incorporate this variability in treatments at 
the stand and landscape scale. Doing so should ensure 
broader goals, such as restoration and maintenance of 
wildlife habitat, are met. Tables of documented mean fire 
intervals found in the Southwest, Front Range, and Black 
Hills and resultant forest stand structure show the varia-
tion in these metrics across landscapes with changes in 
elevation, aspect, and latitude (tables 1, 2, 3, and 4).
Southwest
Prior to major Euro-American and Hispanic settle-
ment of the region in the late 19th century, the fire regime 
of ponderosa pine forests in the Southwest was charac-
terized by frequent occurrence of low-intensity surface 
fires (Cooper 1960; Covington and Moore 1994a; Weaver 
1951). Such fires would have burned mainly through the 
understory, consuming grasses, forbs, shrubs, litter, and 
tree seedlings and causing little damage to larger trees. 
Crown fires were not a component of the historical fire 
regime (Cooper 1960). Across the region, less conser-
vative estimates of historical MFI ranged from 2 to 12 
years (fires recorded by at least a few trees in a stand), 
while more conservative estimates ranged from 5 to 23 
years (fires recorded by at least 25 percent of trees in a 
stand) (table 1). While MFI estimates varied across the 
region, fire regimes in all locales were characterized by 
frequent low intensity fire with an absence of crown fire. 
The majority of fires occurred in late spring and early 
summer, prior to the summer monsoon storms that oc-
cur July and August (Brown and others 2001b; Fule and 
others 2003b).
While most fire history studies have reported MFIs 
that fall within the regional average, certain deviations 
from the mean exist on a local scale. Numerous lo-
cal factors can influence the fire regime in a particular 
area. Although rare, longer fire free intervals have been 
found in areas that were geographically isolated (for ex-
ample, mesa tops) where fire spread would be limited 
from distant fire starts (Madany and West 1983; Touchan 
and others 1996). Fire occurrence also tends to be less 
frequent at higher elevations and on more northerly as-
pects where fuel moisture tends to be higher (Baisan and 
Swetnam 1990; Brown and others 2001b; Swetnam and 
Baisan 1996). The condition of the forests on ridge tops, 
where lightning is most likely to strike and ignite fires, 
can also be an important factor determining the histori-
cal fire frequency. For example, fire may be more likely 
to ignite and spread on forested ridge tops compared to 
rocky ridge tops (Baisan and Swetnam 1990). In cer-
tain areas, intentional burning by Native Americans may 
have significantly increased the historical fire frequency 
on a local scale (Baisan and Swetnam 1997; Kaye and 
Swetnam 1999).
At regional and landscape scales, long- and short-
term climatic fluctuations influenced the frequency and

extent of fires. Historically, large fire years, defined as 
years in which fires occurred throughout much of the 
landscape, occurred in conjunction with severe droughts 
(Grissino-Mayer and Swetnam 2000). In particular, 
large fire years occurred in drought years preceded 
by one or two wet years—a pattern consistently seen 
with El Nino/Southern Oscillation cycles. This pattern 
has been observed in several studies throughout the 
Southwest (Brown and others 2001b; Fule and others 
2003a; Grissino-Mayer and Swetnam 2000; Swetnam 
and Baisan 1996; Swetnam and Betancourt 1998). The 
wet years allowed for high grass production, which 
provided an abundant source of fine fuel conducive to 
ignition and surface fire spread during subsequent dry 
(La Nina) years. Many fire history studies also report an 
unusually long fire-free interval in the 1820s and 1830s, 
most likely due to wetter than average conditions seen 
during this period (Brown and others 2001b; Swetnam 
and Dieterich 1985).
The historical fire regimes described above, in part, 
maintained a very characteristic forest structure in  
ponderosa pine forests of the southwestern United States. 
On a landscape scale, forests were likely a mixture of 
open woodlands, meadows, and more dense forested 
stands (Savage 1991). Studies of historical forest struc-
ture in northern Arizona suggest that these forests were 
fairly open with clumps of even- or uneven-aged forests 
interspersed with large tree-free openings where grasses 
were dominant (Cooper 1960; White 1985). Clumps of 
trees were typically no more than half an acre in size 
(Cooper 1960). Grasses in the openings provided an ideal 
fuel for carrying low intensity surface fires, particularly 
when dry. Higher fuel loadings of larger fuels occurred 
near and in clumps of trees. This would have resulted in 
an occasional high intensity fire on a local scale near tree 
clumps, thus creating microsites favorable for pine re-
generation (Arnold 1950; Cooper 1960). This dynamic 
led to a persistence of the clumping tree pattern as tree 
seedlings would have had difficulty establishing in the 
grassy openings (Cooper 1960; White 1985). Density 
of ponderosa pine trees varied throughout the region 
(see table 2). It is important to note that these numbers

represent estimates of tree density at a specific period of 
time and may not reflect the range of tree density seen 
prior to Euro-American settlement over longer time 
scales and climate variability.
With the combined effect of overgrazing and drought 
in the late 19th century, grass cover decreased consider-
ably in ponderosa pine forests throughout the Southwest 
(Arnold 1950; Denevan 1967). An abrupt decline in fire 
frequency began around 1880 concurrent with the reduc-
tion of this fine fuel that would readily carry surface fire 
(Baisan and Swetnam 1990; Brown and others 2001b; 
Covington and Moore 1994a; Dieterich 1980; Swetnam 
and Baisan 1996). Fire frequency was also reduced with 
the practice of fire suppression that began with the cre-
ation of the Forest Service in the early 20th century (Pyne 
2004).
With the absence of fire and an explosive pine regen-
eration event in 1919 and 1920, tree density increased 
throughout southwestern ponderosa pine forests (Fule 
and others 1997; Moore and others 2004; Schubert 
1974). As a result, the current forest structure deviates 
considerably from the historical structure. For example, 
in northern Arizona, estimates of number of trees per acre 
have increased from about 20 to 60 in the early 1900s 
to 270 to 850 currently (Covington and Moore 1994b; 
Fule and others 1997). When averaged across the region, 
the average number of trees per acre has increased from 
roughly 30 in the 1910s to 220 in the 1990s (Moore and 
others 2004). However, tree density also varies by sub-
strate. For example, higher historical and contemporary 
tree densities occur in areas with limestone substrates 
(Covington and Moore 1994a).
Tree species composition has also changed in many 
places, from a dominance of shade-intolerant ponde-
rosa pine trees to more shade-tolerant species such as 
white fir and Douglas-fir (Covington and Moore 1994b; 
Fule and others 1997). Tree size class distribution has 
changed from a structure with few large to medium 
diameter trees to many small diameter trees (Fule and 
others 1997; Moore and others 2004). There are also 
more standing dead trees and higher surface fuel load-
ing in the current forests compared to historical levels,

although there are no data available on the size of snags 
present in historical forests (Moore and others 2004). On 
a landscape scale, many forests are much more structur-
ally homogenous (Savage 1991).
The current forest structure has led to an altered fire 
regime such that forests are now more likely to burn 
with infrequent, intense stand-replacing fires. This has 
been shown with increasing occurrence of large and se-
vere fires in the Southwest since the middle of the 20th 
century (Swetnam 1990), including the Rodeo-Chediski 
fire that burned over 400,000 acres in central Arizona 
in 2002.
According to coarse scale assessments, many of the 
ponderosa pine forests in the Southwest are considered to 
be outside of their historical range of variability in terms 
of fire disturbance and forest structure (Aplet and Wilmer 
2003). Currently, an estimated 61 percent of ponderosa 
pine/dry Douglas-fir forests in New Mexico have high 
potential for crown fire spread (Fiedler and others 2002). 
These areas should benefit from fuel treatments for pur-
poses of restoration or fire hazard reduction. Given the 
vast areas in need of treatments and the constraints on 
available resources, priorities areas considered for fuel 
reduction treatments should be prioritized.
Colorado Front Range
Prior to the start of Euro-American settlement in the 
mid-19th century, the fire regime of ponderosa pine for-
ests of the Front Range exhibited both similarities and 
differences to those of the Southwest. Here, fires have 
been characterized as mixed-severity, with both surface 
and small-scale, stand-replacing crown fires occurring 
at intervals anywhere between 5 and 118 years (Brown 
and others 1999; Brown and others 2000; Brown and 
Shepperd 2001; Donnegan and others 2001; Goldblum 
and Veblen 1992; Hadley 1994; Veblen and others 2000). 
The mean fire interval for surface fires (MFI) historically 
varied throughout the Front Range depending on lati-
tude, elevation, and aspect (table 3). Across the region, 
less conservative estimates of MFI varied from 8 to 64 
years (fires recorded by a few trees in a stand), while 
more conservative estimates ranged from 14 to 59 years 
(fires recorded by at least 25 percent of trees in a stand) 
(table 3). We note, however, that use of MFI alone does 
not consider the spatial extent of recorded fires, which 
is especially important in the Front Range where fires 
that were ecologically important at the landscape scale 
occurred less frequently and at a spectrum of severities 
(Kaufmann and others 2006)
In general, the historical frequency of surface fires 
decreased with elevation with more frequent surface 
fires in the low elevation grassland/forest ecotone and 
less frequent fires in higher elevation forests (table 3) 
(Brown and Shepperd 2001; Sherriff and Veblen, in 
press). The historical MFI, in general, also increased with 
latitude from southern Colorado to southern Wyoming 
(table 3). Low intensity surface fires were also likely 
more frequent on south-, east-, and west-facing slopes 
where conditions were more xeric and stands less dense 
(Goldblum and Veblen 1992; Veblen 2003). Historically, 
fires occurred throughout the growing season, but oc-
curred slightly earlier in the southern portion of the 
range (Baker 2003; Brown and others 1999; Brown and 
Shepperd 2001; Veblen and Kitzberger 2002).
Currently, ponderosa pine forests in the Front Range 
include few openings and stands with conspicuous age 
and size limits (Brown and others 1999; Brown and oth-
ers 2000; Ehle and Baker 2003; Huckaby and others 
2001; Kaufmann and others 2000; Sherriff and Veblen 
2007). Spatial patterns and age structure characteristics 
associated with past stand-replacing disturbance events 
appear to be an important part of the historical fire re-
gime in ponderosa pine forests in some parts of the Front 
Range (Kaufmann and others 2006).
The nature of mixed-severity fire regimes and the ex-
tensive logging and burning in the Front Range during the 
19th century make assessment of the historical crown fire 
component of this fire regime extremely difficult. Thus, 
the historical extent and frequency of stand-replacing 
fires in the Front Range is not well understood. Only one 
study to date has examined historical fire regimes across 
the full elevational range of ponderosa pine in the Front 
Range. This study found that low-severity surface fires 
were common on only 20 percent of the landscape stud-
ies (in areas below 2100 m in elevation) (Sherriff and 
Veblen 2007). However, this study represents a unique 
and small portion of the Front Range.
Kaufmann and others (2006) examined the avail-
able historical fire data for the Front Range in an effort 
to bring some understanding to the apparent conflicts 
among the various studies reported in the literature. They 
conclude that historical fires in the Front Range were 
complex and burned in response to variations in weather 
conditions, fuels, and topography. Historical fire regime 
of low-severity fires that maintained savannas and open 
woodlands in ponderosa pine forests applies only to por-
tions of the lowest elevations of the Front Range. At 
middle and higher elevations, mixed-severity fires were 
the most important in maintaining the structure and spa-
tial distribution of ponderosa pine in the Front Range 
landscape. They further note that steep topographic and 
elevation gradients strongly affected the fire regime. It 
is likely that stand-replacing fires were more common 
in mesic sites at higher elevations and on north-facing

aspects where tree density is typically high and shade-
tolerant species such as Douglas-fir are more common 
(Romme and others 2000; Veblen and others 2000).
Historically, fire frequency, severity, and extent in the 
Front Range varied with long- and short-term climatic 
fluctuations. As in the Southwest, large fire years (years 
where fires occurred across much of the landscape) 
tended to occur when the growing season was drier than 
average and was preceded by 1 to 3 wetter than aver-
age years, a common pattern when El Nino-Southern 
Oscillation (ENSO) years (wet) are followed by La Nina 
years (dry) (Donnegan and others 2001; Veblen 2000; 
Veblen and others 2000). Live fine fuels (grasses) likely 
accumulated during wet years and subsequently cured 
during dry years, providing an abundant dry fuel source 
conducive to ignition and fire spread. However, this 
pattern was less pronounced in the northern portion of 
the Front Range where sensitivity to ENSO patterns is 
weaker (Veblen 2000). Long-term climatic changes may 
also have been responsible for decadal shifts in the his-
torical fire regime. Increased fire activity was observed 
during decades with pronounced ENSO activity, and 
decreased fire activity was observed for decades when 
ENSO activity was weak (Donnegan and others 2001;

forest structure varied widely throughout the range with 
estimates of historical tree density ranging from 16 to 
1380 trees per acre (Baker and others 2007). The mixed-
severity fire regime likely resulted in a complex forest 
structure composed of openings with no trees, persistent 
clumps of old-growth trees, forest patches with nearly 
pure ponderosa pine, and patches with ponderosa pine 
and Douglas-fir (Kaufmann and others 2001). This com-
plexity is the result of the wide range of environmental 
conditions where ponderosa pine occurs in the Front 
Range. Mixed-conifer forests containing ponderosa pine, 
lodgepole pine, limber pine, Douglas-fir, aspen, spruce, 
and fir can be found in various combinations in the Front 
Range (Kaufmann and others 2006). Historically, these 
mixed conifer forests were found in more mesic areas 
at higher elevations on north-facing aspects, and likely 
had higher tree density than the drier pure ponderosa 
pine forests found at lower elevations (Baker and others 
2007; Kaufmann and others 2000). In the drier forests, 
both high and low intensity fires would have resulted in 
tree mortality and would have created openings with no 
trees and stands with low tree density (Kaufmann and 
others 2001; Kaufmann and others 2003). Old-growth 
forests likely persisted in areas where intervals between 
stand-replacing events were long. In the central portion 
of the Front Range, delayed tree recruitment following 
stand-replacing disturbance events would have allowed 
for openings and low density stands (< 30 percent cano-
py cover) to persist across the landscape (Huckaby and 
others 2003; Kaufmann and others 2003). It is estimated 
that these openings may have accounted for up to 25 
percent of the landscape in lower elevation montane for-
ests in the central Front Range, (Kaufmann and others 
2001). However, in the northern Front Range at higher 
elevations, others have argued that dense ponderosa 
pine forests may have historically made up a significant 
portion of the upper montane forests (Baker and others 
2007; Ehle and Baker 2003; Sherriff and Veblen 2007).
Large-scale human disturbance in the mid-19th cen-
tury (logging, grazing, burning), along with favorable 
climatic conditions, prompted synchronized tree regen-
eration events in the Front Range (Ehle and Baker 2003; 
Kaufmann and others 2003; Veblen and others 2000). 
This resulted in a rather even-aged and even-sized distri-
bution of ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir trees in forests 
throughout the Front Range. Because fire suppression 
in the 20th century limited mortality of trees following 
these recruitment pulses, current forests have much 
higher tree density than historical forests (Kaufmann 
and others 2000; Veblen and others 2000). Tree species 
composition has changed from dominance of shade-
intolerant ponderosa pine trees to more shade-tolerate 
species such as Douglas-fir (Kaufmann and others 2000). 
Forest structure has changed from a mosaic of dense for-
ests, openings, and old growth to a homogenous forest 
structure of dense trees of similar age and size class-
es and higher tree canopy cover (Huckaby and others 
2003; Kaufmann and others 2000; Veblen and Lorenz 
1991). Thus, current forest structure, particularly in low 
elevation forests, contains much higher tree density 
than historical levels in drier forests (Kaufmann and 
others 2000). Yet, forest structure of more mesic upper 
montane ponderosa pine – Douglas-fir forests at higher 
elevations and on north-facing slopes may not have been 
as severely altered, particularly in the northern Front 
Range (Baker and others 2007). In fact, some have ar-
gued that fire suppression has resulted in decreased tree 
regeneration throughout the 20th century through the de-
velopment of thick forest canopies that limit successful 
seedling establishment in the understory in some areas 
of the Front Range (Ehle and Baker 2003; Sherriff and 
Veblen, in press).
In places where forest structure has been severely al-
tered, the increased forest density has led to an altered 
fire regime where wildfires today are more likely to burn 
with more severe fire effects. While stand-replacing fires 
certainly were a part of the historical fire regime, the 
stand-replacing portion of any given fire is likely much 
higher under current forest conditions (Kaufmann and 
others 2000; Schoennagel and others 2004). This has 
been evidenced by several high-severity wildfires that 
have occurred in the Front Range in recent years, in-
cluding the 130,000+ acre Hayman Fire, which was 
unprecedented in terms of size of high-severity patch-
es in this landscape, at least over the past 5 centuries 
(Kaufmann and others 2003) (fig. 2). While fire regimes 
may not have been significantly altered in higher el-
evation montane forests in the northern Front Range 
(Sherriff and Veblen 2007), the extent to which fire re-
gimes have changed high elevation montane forests in 
other portions of the Front Range remains largely un-
known (Kaufmann and others 2006).
According to a recent report by the Front Range Fuel 
Treatment Partnership Rountable (2006), close to 1 mil-
lion acres of fire-prone forests fall in the wildland urban 
interface in the Front Range of Colorado and are thus a 
high priority for treatment. Of these, about 400,000 acres 
are in the lower montane ponderosa pine zone roughly 
split between public and private ownership. Thus, fuel 
treatment strategies that cross jurisdictional boundaries 
are needed in this region to truly protect communities 
from the threat of wildfire. For purposes of restoration, 
the lower elevation forests (below 2100 m) are more 
likely to have significantly higher tree density today than 

14	
USDA Forest Service RMRS-GTR-198.  2007
they would have had historically (Kaufmann and others 
2006). Thus, restoration efforts should be prioritized in 
these areas. By some estimates, this makes up only 20 
percent of the ponderosa pine forests in the Front Range 
(Sherriff and Veblen 2007). However, these estimates 
come from the northern Front Range in Boulder County, 
which has relatively little lower montane ponderosa pine, 
and it is unclear if similar proportions can be applied to 
other forests in the Front Range (Kaufmann and others 
2006). In any case, lower elevation ponderosa pine for-
ests are more likely to occur near developed urban areas 
in the Front Range, further underscoring the need for 
fuels treatment intervention in the urban interface.
Black Hills
While similarities exist in historical fire regimes of 
ponderosa pine forests of the Black Hills, Front Range 
and Southwest, certain characteristics distinguish the 
Black Hills ponderosa pine type forests from those of 
the Front Range and Southwest. The Continental cli-
mate in the Black Hills is much more conducive to the 
establishment and growth of ponderosa pine, owing 
to persistent seed crops and abundant summer rain-
fall (Shepperd and Battaglia 2002). The result is forest 
structures and fire regimes that were historically differ-
ent from those in the Front Range and Southwest. While 
only a few studies have been conducted on the historical 
fire regime of the Black Hills, current evidence suggests 
that prior to Euro-American settlement, the fire regime 
of the Black Hills would have been of mixed-severi-
ty, with both surface and crown fires being important 
components of the ecosystem (Brown and Sieg 1996; 
Brown 2003; Shinneman and Baker 1997). However, 
most fire history studies in this region have focused on 
questions regarding the historical frequency of surface 
fires. With mean annual precipitation increasing from 
south to north in the Black Hills, historical surface fire 
frequency was higher in the southern portion com-
pared to the northern and central portions (Brown 2003; 
Shinneman and Baker 1997). Less conservative esti-
mates of the mean fire interval (MFI) ranged from 10 to 
15 years in the southern Black Hills, to 30 to 33 years in

the central and northern Black Hills (table 4). In Devils 
Tower National Monument, MFI varied through time 
with a higher MFI occurring from 1600 to 1770 (MFI = 
27 years) compared to 1779 to 1900 (MFI = 14 years) 
(Fisher and others 1987). The author attributed this to 
the presence of the Sioux who may have intentionally 
set fires to herd game. Historical MFI also increased 
with elevation (table 4) along with precipitation and 
colder temperatures (Shepperd and Battaglia 2002).
Many studies report evidence of a crown fire com-
ponent in this system. Evidence for this comes from 
historical accounts and photos from early Euro-American 
explorers. Journals from early explorers reveal that large 
treeless areas with charred snags were commonly en-
countered (Graves 1899). Historical photographs reveal 
this as well (Grafe and Horsted 2002; Progulske 1974). 
Pine regeneration can be prolific in the Black Hills, es-
pecially after stand-replacing disturbance (Bonnet and 
others 2005; Brown and others 2000; Lentile 2004; 
Lundquist and Negron 2000). Early explorers to the 
Black Hills commonly found dense, even-aged stands 
of ponderosa pine seedlings or saplings (Grafe and 
Horsted 2002; Kime 1996; Progulske 1974) or two-aged 
stands with dense understories of younger trees (Graves 
1899). While such stands can be a result of a variety 
of disturbance agents (wind, disease, insects), other

evidence (charred snags) suggests that wildfire was the 
cause (Grafe and Horsted 2002; Kime 1996). However, 
one study shows that pulses of pine recruitment may be 
driven more by climate than disturbance (Brown 2003). 
Unlike ponderosa pine forests in other parts of the United 
States, long fire-free periods were historically common 
in the Black Hills (Brown and Sieg 1996), which may 
have led to fuel build-up and high tree density - condi-
tions conducive to crown fire spread. Because much of 
the Black Hills was repeatedly logged during the 20th 
century (Boldt and Van Deusen 1974; Raventon 1994, 
Shepperd and Battaglia 2002), it is difficult to determine 
the historical extent and frequency of crown fires in this 
system.
Much of the precipitation in the Black Hills falls as 
rain from April to September (Brown 2003; Shepperd 
and Battaglia 2002). Thus, historically, most wildfires 
burned in the late summer and early fall when fuels 
would have been sufficiently dry to promote fire spread 
(Brown and Sieg 1996, 1999). In the higher elevations in 
the northern and central portions of the Black Hills, fires 
occurred more rarely and may have spread mostly in 
years that were drier than average. Fires did not typical-
ly occur in years that were wetter than average. Unlike 
ponderosa pine forests in other regions, there appears to 
be no effect of El Nino/La Nina cycles on the historical 
fire regime (Brown 2003).
The occurrence of surface fires and stand-replacing 
fires, coupled with other disturbance agents, led to a 
complex mosaic of forest structure composed of dense 
forests, moderately stocked forests, and treeless open-
ings. In 1899, Henry S. Graves conducted an extensive 
inventory of timber resources in the Black Hills for the 
U.S. Geological Survey. While this assessment occurred 
after substantial logging had occurred in certain areas, it 
still provides an invaluable insight into the historical for-
est structure of the Black Hills. Graves identified three 
classes of timber: 1) less than 2,000 board feet per acre, 
2) 2,000 to 5,000 board feet per acre, and 3) 5,000 to 
10,000 board feet per acre. The first class was the most 
common in the Black Hills and the third class was the 
least common. Evidence of disturbance was not seen in 
the third class and the dense forest structure was likely a 
result of long fire-free periods (Graves 1899). Density of 
trees in classes one and two was probably limited by fre-
quent disturbance from fire and insects. In the absence 
of disturbance, stands in class three would have become 
very dense and more susceptible to crown fire spread. 
In more frequently disturbed forests, stands were likely 
multi-aged and tree density varied from 7 to almost 300 
trees per acre (Brown and Cook 2006; McAdams 1995). 
In forests with longer intervals between disturbances, 
sapling density may have been as high as 8,000 trees per 
acre (Baker and others 2007). As these dense, even-aged 
forests matured, density decreased to 150 to 200 trees 
per acre (Baker and others 2007).
The historical fire regime of the Black Hills has been 
disrupted as a result of human influence. While Native 
Americans were likely to have had little effect on the 
historical fire regime, there is some evidence that their 
burning practices increased the fire frequency in certain 
portions of this region (Fisher and others 1987). The big-
gest disruption in the fire regime was a sharp decrease in 
the fire frequency as a result of fire exclusion, logging, 
and grazing by Euro-Americans beginning around 1900. 
Given the naturally long fire-free periods in some parts 
of the Black Hills, the historical fire regime may not have 
changed on some local scales. However, across the Black 
Hills landscape, fires have become less frequent during 
the 20th century. In addition, the current fire-free periods 
are longer than the longest fire-free periods found in fire 
history studies (Brown and Sieg 1996, 1999).
The altered fire regime, along with other human dis-
turbances, has led to dramatic changes in forest structure 
in the Black Hills since the end of the 19th century. On 
a regional scale, ponderosa pine density is much higher 
today compared to conditions when Euro-American’s 
first settled in the region (Grafe and Horsted 2002; 
McAdams 1995; Progulske 1974). In areas where tree 
density would have been naturally high (north-facing 
slopes and higher elevation forests), forest structure may 
not have been significantly altered since fire exclusion. 
While dense second-growth forests would historically 
have been common, old-growth forests, openings, and 
frequently disturbed forests of low density were also sig-
nificant components of the landscape (Parrish and others 
1996). As a result of extensive logging, old-growth for-
ests are almost completely removed from the Black 
Hills landscape (Boldt and Van Deusen 1974). Early 
explorers accounted large tree-free areas presumably re-
sulting from crown fires (Grafe and Horsted 2002; Kime 
1996; Progulske 1974). Fewer of these areas exist today 
as a result of fire exclusion (Grafe and Horsted 2002; 
Progulske 1974). Areas that were formerly frequent-
ly disturbed stands with historically low tree density 
are now very dense stands (Grafe and Horsted 2002; 
McAdams 1995; Progulske 1974; USDA Forest Service 
1994). There is also evidence to suggest that current av-
erage tree size is lower than historical levels (Brown and 
Cook 2006). While historically much of the Black Hills 
would have been composed of a mosaic of stands with 
even- or multi-aged structure, today, the Black Hills are 
predominantly managed with an even-aged shelterwood 
silvicultural system (Shepperd and Battaglia 2002).

The increases in fuel loads and tree density and the 
homogenous nature of current Black Hills forest land-
scapes have changed the fire regime so ponderosa pine 
forests are now more likely to burn with infrequent and 
large stand-replacing fires. This is evidenced by several 
large wildfires that occurred in the Black Hills in the 
19th and 20th centuries (Raventon 1994, Shepperd and 
Battaglia 2002). In the 1890s two large fires burned about 
74,000 acres in the northern Black Hills. In the 1930s, 
the Rochford and McVey fires burned about 40,000 acres 
on the Limestone Plateau. Since 2000, seven fires have 
burned about 140,000 acres, including large areas of 
both privately- and publicly-managed forests and grass-
lands. This includes the largest fire to occur in recorded 
history in the Black Hills, the Jasper fire, which burned 
81,000 acres in 2000 (Lentile 2004).
To reduce wildfire hazard, managers in the Black Hills 
estimate that 15,000 to 20,000 acres per year should be 
burned in the Black Hills using prescribed fire (USDA 
Forest Service 1994). Currently, fewer acres are actually 
burned in a given year (USDA Forest Service 2004a). Up 
to 44,000 acres that are commercially thinned are in need 
of additional fuel treatment every year and up to 13,000 
acres per year of natural fuels are in need of mechanical 
fuel treatment in the Black Hills. About 5,000 parcels 
of private land are intermingled within the Black Hills 
National Forest, making up 19 percent of the area within 
the forest boundary (USDA Forest Service 1994) (fig. 3). 
The potential for wildfires and escaped prescribed fires 
occurring within this extensive wildland-urban interface 
poses significant challenges for managers.
For purposes of restoration, not all areas of the Black 
Hills would be in need of treatment. Since ponderosa 
pine forests in the Black Hills historically contained a 
mosaic of structures and stocking conditions, from rela-
tively open stands to dense forested patches (Brown and 
Cook 2006), care should be taken to re-create this het-
erogeneity in forest structure across the landscape.
Impacts of Altered Fire Regimes
While there are differences in historical forest struc-
ture and fire regimes in ponderosa pine forests in the 
Southwest, Front Range, and Black Hills, all of these 
regions have experienced drastic changes in forest 
structure and subsequent changes in fire regimes in the 
past century. Forests that historically were relatively 
open once burned with frequent low- or mixed-severity 
fire regimes. Presently, these forests have much higher 
tree density and fuel loading and are more likely to 
burn with infrequent, severe crown fires (Brown and 
others 1999; Covington 2003; Covington and Moore 
1994a; Huckaby and others 2003; Kaufmann and oth-
ers 2000; Veblen and others 2000). However, historical 
forest structure and the resulting fire regime may not 
have changed significantly in certain areas in the Front 
Range and Black Hills where tree density has always 
been naturally high (north-facing slopes, higher eleva-
tions) (Baker and others 2007). At landscape scales, 
however, the fire regime has likely been altered as 
forests have become more dense and homogenous 
in nature (Huckaby and others 2003; Kaufmann and  
others 2000; Schoennagel and others 2004; Veblen 
and others 2000). Records indicate that fires across 
the Southwest have become larger and more severe 
since the mid-20th century (Swetnam 1990). Crown 
fires in the Front Range seem to be less localized and 
more extensive than in the past (Huckaby and others 
2003). Similarly, large wildfires that have occurred in 
the Black Hills in recent years are likely a function of 
the more homogenous nature of forest structure today 
(Brown and Cook 2006).
These large and severe wildfires have very signifi-
cant consequences for a variety of resources managed in 
these forests, including hydrology and soils, community 
and fire-fighter safety, insect and disease outbreaks, and 
bidoversity. Even with the absence of fire, the altered 
forest structure can also have negative consequences for 
valued resources. The dense and homogenous nature of 
ponderosa pine landscapes in these regions today can 
also have negative impacts on hydrology, insect and dis-
ease outbreaks, biodiversity, and forage production.
Hydrology and Soils
Large and severe wildfires result in more negative 
impacts on hydrology and soils compared to fires of low-
severity. Severe wildfires result in sudden and complete 
reductions in vegetative cover, which leads to increased 
water runoff and soil erosion (DeBano and others 1998). 
Such changes in hydrology can be severe enough to 
significantly reduce site fertility and water quality and 
degrade stream communities (DeBano 1991; Keane and 
others 2002; Landsberg and Tiedemann 2000). Full re-
covery of soil microbial communities reduced by severe 
wildfire can take up to 2 years or longer, and this can 
have detrimental impacts on availability of soil carbon 
and nitrogen (Choromanska and DeLuca 2001).
Another effect of dense and homogenous forest struc-
ture is increased evapotranspiration and interception 
resultant from increased tree density. This can signifi-
cantly reduce the water yield from watersheds when 
averaged across the landscape, limiting supply for hu-
mans and riparian communities (Keane and others 2002; 
Stednick 1996).

Non-native Plants
Non-native, invasive plants are often well-adapted to 
disturbance, and establish rapidly in recently disturbed 
areas. High intensity disturbance events in particular 
promote establishment of invasive plants. Thus, severe 
wildfires in ponderosa pine forests create ample oppor-
tunities for establishment of non-native invasive plants 
(Crawford and others 2001; Hobbs and Huenneke 1992; 
Hunter and others 2006; Keeley and others 2003) (fig. 
4). Since native plants are often not well-adapted to such 
high intensity disturbance, recovery of these species 
may be slow. With the absence of potentially compet-
ing native plants, non-native invasive plants may more 
readily become permanently established. If invasive 
plants become well-established, they may prevent re-
establishment of native species and ultimately reducing 
biodiversity.
Community and Fire-fighter Safety
The severe wildfires commonly seen in ponderosa 
pine landscapes often burn as crown fires with high 
flame lengths. These conditions preclude direct fire sup-
pression. Such fires need to be fought using equipment 
such as planes and dozers, making them considerably 
more costly to suppress than low-intensity surface fires 
(Snider and others 2003). These fires are also inherently 
more dangerous and pose greater threats to firefighters 
and communities than low intensity fires.
Insect and Disease Outbreaks
Insects and pathogens are natural components of for-
est ecosystems where they play many roles—some are 
able to damage or kill trees. The distribution, abundance, 
and community composition of these pests commonly

lishment of invasive species. In the Black Hills, it is common for Cirsium arvense to establish in burn pile scars. Photo credit:

depend on the structure of the stands within the forest 
landscape and the condition of the trees within these 
stands. Under endemic conditions, they affect single or 
small groups of individuals, helping to sustain succes-
sion, nutrient cycling, energy flows, biodiversity, and 
other ecosystem processes. At other times, however, 
these pests erupt into outbreaks that kill thousands of 
trees over vast areas, lasting several years, and im-
pacting aesthetic values, water production, recreation, 
timber production, wildlife habitat, and other valuable 
resources.
Severe wildfires can impact the potential for insect 
and disease outbreaks. High intensity fires are more 
likely to damage overstory trees, which makes them 
more susceptible to bark beetle attack (Wallin and oth-
ers 2003). Fire seldom eliminates root disease pathogens 
from a site, but it can reduce woody substrates that sup-
port pathogen growth and/or shift stand composition 
toward more disease tolerant seral species. Fire can also 
create scars on the boles of surviving trees, impact tree 
health, stimulate germination of heat resistant spores 
(for example, Rhizina root disease), or otherwise change 
conditions to increase diseases.
The current forest structure resultant from the al-
tered fire regime can have detrimental consequences 
for other ecological processes (fig. 5). Several studies 
have attempted to describe conditions preferred by vari-
ous insect pests and thus conducive to insect outbreaks 
(Furniss 1965; Negron and Popp 2004; Reynolds and 
Holsten 1996; Rudinsky 1966). One product of this 
research has been infestation hazard models. These 
models commonly show that infestations are associated 
with such factors as basal area, stand density, age, stem 
diameter, the sequential or concurrent presence of other 
disturbance agents (for example, root diseases; Lessard 
and others 1985), dwarf mistletoe (McCambridge and 
others 1982), and other variables. What triggers such 
outbreaks has been a source of speculation by genera-
tions of entomologists and pathologists. However, it is 
fairly clear that exclusion of fire in forest ecosystems 
is one such trigger. In locations where fire has been 
excluded and stands become overstocked or stand com-
position shifts toward shade-tolerant species, or both, 
root diseases often increase (Hansen and Goheen 2000; 
Otrosina and Ferrell 1995). Additionally, homogenous 
forest structure may cause insect outbreaks to be more 
synchronous across the landscape (Kaufmann and others 
2000; Lundquist and Negron 2000; Schmid and Mata 
1996; Swetnam and Lynch 1993).
Biodiversity and Forage Production
Increased canopy cover and duff accumulations lim-
it opportunities for establishment and growth of plant 
species in the forest understory, which in turn, has nega-
tive impacts on both forage production and biodiversity 
(Alexander 1987; Keane and others 2002; Laughlin and 
others 2004, 2005; Severson and Uresk 1988; Uresk 
and Severson 1988). By some estimates, the increase in 
forest canopy cover throughout the 20th century has led 
to as much as a 92 percent reduction in forage produc-
tion in some pine stands in Arizona. Forests with high 
tree density may also reduce habitat quality for wild-
life species adapted to forest openings and stands with 
large trees and snags (Dahms and Geils 1997). Some as-
pects of the altered forest structure may also negatively 
impact threatened and endangered species such as the 
Mexican spotted owl, northern goshawk, and Pawnee 
montane skipper (Colorado State Forest Service 2004; 
Reynolds and others 1996; Sheppard and Farnsworth 
1997). Furthermore, many species of wildlife and plants 
are adapted to a variety of forest structural stages, from 
forest openings to forests with dense canopy cover 
(Anderson 1994). Thus, landscapes that contain a di-
verse mosaic of structural stages tend to support more 
species of birds and mammals than landscapes that are 
more homogenous (Finch and others 1997; Keane and 
others 2002).

T
he goal of any fuel treatment project is to alter fu-
els to reduce the potential for catastrophic wildfire 
spread. Depending on the objective, this can be achieved 
by practices that reduce fuel loading, continuity, and 
depth. While wildfire hazard reduction is a valid goal, 
agencies are also charged with meeting many other re-
source management objectives, such as wildlife habitat 
improvement and maintenance of species diversity. 
Restoring landscapes to conditions present prior to ma-
jor disruptions by Euro-Americans may best meet these 
goals. For example, conditions under which the large 
variety of plants and animals found in ponderosa pine 
forests have evolved and adapted. In some cases, goals of 
forest restoration can be conducive with reducing wild-
fire hazard, especially for areas that historically burned 
with frequent low-severity fire regimes. However, where 
mixed-severity fire regimes were the norm, restoration 
may result in moderately dense forests with the potential 
to burn with high intensity on a small scale. The needs 
of reduced fire hazard may have to be balanced against 
the needs for restoration in such cases. However, other 
resource management objectives may still be met by al-
tering fuel treatment prescriptions. Treatments that are 
multifaceted and consider many resource management 
objectives, along with fuel reduction, are likely more 
sustainable in the long term.
Reduced Wildfire Hazard
Wildfire hazard can be thought of as the potential fire 
behavior and effects based on existing fuel condition. 
Reduced wildfire hazard is the primary goal of forest 
fuel reduction treatments. In order to effectively achieve 
this goal, fuel treatments need to address needs at both 
local and landscape scales with attention to requirements 
for long-term sustained management. On the stand level, 
prescriptions need to be designed to reduce the poten-
tial for initiation of active crown fires. On the landscape 
scale, fuel treatments need to be strategically placed to 
protect values at risk from catastrophic fire. Long-term 
planning must take into account sustained management 
so that treatments maintain their effectiveness over time. 
In all cases, the goal is to reduce wildfire hazard, not 
to eliminate fire altogether. The degree of reduction that 
can be achieved requires consideration of a variety of 
factors and ecosystem values.
On the stand level, reduced fire hazard is accom-
plished through reductions in surface, ladder, and canopy 
fuels. Surface fuels include litter, duff, and woody debris 
that lie on the soil surface, as well as standing grasses, 
forbs, shrubs, and small trees. High fuel loading contrib-
utes to the potential for high intensity surface fire that 
can, in turn, have adverse effects on soil and vegetation 
through elimination of protective organic matter, and 
heat damage to soil organisms, roots and stems. Ladder 
fuels include large woody debris, large shrubs, small 
trees, and lower branches on large trees, all of which 
act to carry fire from the surface up into the canopy of 
trees, otherwise known as passive crown fire (Agee and 
Skinner 2005; Brown and others 2004). Canopy fuels 
include branches, leaves, and other materials that are 
in the forest canopy. Canopy bulk density, or the mass 
of material in a given volume of canopy space, contrib-
utes directly to the potential for fire to spread from tree 
canopy to tree canopy, otherwise known as active crown 
fire spread (Agee and Skinner 2005). To reduce wildfire 
hazard at the stand level, fuels need to be manipulated 
to reduce the potential for initiation of both active and 
undesired passive crown fire behavior. The appropriate 
level of hazard reduction will vary with any given treat-
ment. Many have used the general rule of altering fuels 
such that surface fire is promoted under 90 percent fire 
weather conditions. A number of treatments are available 
that can be used to reduce loading of surface, ladder, and 
canopy fuels (see Section IV—Treatment Techniques) 
and thus, affect fire behavior.
Even though most fuel treatments occur on a stand 
level, it is important to consider each treatment in a land-
scape context, especially since many current wildfires 
dwarf the size of individual fuel treatment projects and 
cross jurisdictional boundaries (Sisk and others 2004). 
Placement of fuel treatments on every square inch of 
ponderosa pine landscapes will never be feasible nor 
would it be desirable given other resource management 
needs. Strategies for fuel treatment placement should be 
designed to maximize benefit gained from treatments in 
terms of meeting goals of reduced wildfire hazard. Not 
Section III:
Fuel Treatment Objectives

every acre requires treatment to effectively reduce the 
potential for severe wildfire spread. Researchers have 
modeled fire growth under different fuel treatment sce-
narios to determine how fuel treatments can be optimally 
placed to reduce fire spread. Results show that separate 
treatments that overlap slightly in the heading fire direc-
tion can reduce overall rate of fire spread (Finney 2001). 
Placement of linear fuel breaks in strategic locations (for 
example, ridgetops) has also been proposed to break up 
fuel continuity and aid in fire suppression tactics (Agee 
and others 2000).
Management of landscapes does not end with the 
initial implementation of strategically-placed fuel treat-
ments across the landscape. Long-term planning is 
needed to ensure that the effectiveness of treatments is 
maintained. For example, prescribed fires are shown to 
reduce the severity of wildfires for up to 4 years in Arizona 
and New Mexico (Ffolliott and Guertin 1988; Finney 
and others 2005; Omi and others 2005) and 6 years in 
Colorado (Omi and others 2005). Once initial fuel treat-
ments have sufficiently reduced fuel loads to promote 
low intensity fire, maintenance of low fuel loads should 
then be accomplished with repeated fuel treatments. The 
frequency of maintenance treatments will vary by region 
and can be determined by the historical fire frequency 
or rates of fuel accumulation. For example, it is recom-
mended that maintenance treatments be conducted every 
3 to 10 years in the Southwest where fires historically 
occurred with high frequency (Allen and others 1968; 
Biswell and others 1973; Harrington and Sackett 1990; 
Sackett and others 1996). This is also consistent with 
the rates of accumulation of surface fuels in this region 
(Ffolliott and others 1977; Ffolliott and Guertin 1988). 
In the Black Hills and Front Range where fire was his-
torically less frequent, maintenance treatments occur at 
longer intervals. In the Black Hills, maintenance treat-
ments are recommended every 15 to 25 years in the 
lower elevation forests (Bachelet and others 2000). In 
the Front Range, maintenance treatments should be con-
ducted in intervals of 3 to 20 years or more depending on 
location and elevation (City of Boulder 1999; Kaufmann 
and others 2005). Tree seedling establishment and crown 
growth rates vary with locality, site conditions, and as-
sociate vegetation and may require modification of these 
maintenance treatment intervals.
Restoration
Restoring forests to their historical structure and re-
introducing important ecological processes, such as 
fire, should promote viability of species that evolved 
under the historical forest conditions (Allen and  
others 2002; Brown and others 2004; Landres and others 
1999; Swetnam and others 1999). Since pre-settlement 
ponderosa pine forests in the Southwest, Front Range, 
and Black Hills generally burned under low- to mixed-
severity fire regimes, restoring historical forest structure 
should reduce the potential for large-scale crown fires 
(Allen and others 2002; Brown and others 2000; Brown 
and others 2001a; Fiedler and Keegan 2003; Fule and 
others 2001; Kaufmann and others 2003; Wienk and 
others 2004). However, adhering to strict restoration 
objectives will not result in reduced wildfire hazard in 
all stands since some ponderosa pine forests historical-
ly burned with infrequent fires of high severity (Baker 
and others 2007). Pre-Euro-American settlement forest 
structure provides a useful reference for thinning targets 
(Landres and others 1999), but there are limitations in 
the use of historical data since site specific information is 
often not available (Landres and others 1999; Swetnam 
and others 1999). However, there is general knowledge 
of the range of variability in historical forest structure 
and disturbance processes and this can be considered 
when planning site-specific fuels treatment activities.
Restoration projects at the stand level should at-
tempt to mimic historical stand conditions in terms of 
tree density, tree age and size distribution, tree species 
composition, and spatial pattern (Allen and others 2002; 
Kaufmann and others 2003; Moore and others 1999). 
Since these conditions likely varied across the land-
scape, care should be taken to consider that variability 
and use local historical data when available. Managers 
should also consider other important historical compo-
nents of stands, such as understory species and wildlife. 
Restoration involves much more than returning histori-
cal forest structure. For example, historical processes 
also require attention. Thus, dominant disturbance pro-
cesses such as fire also need to be returned to the system 
in a manner that reflects historical disturbance regimes 
(Allen and others 2002; Moore and others 1999).
To approach historical conditions on a landscape 
level, managers should attempt to achieve the spatial 
heterogeneity in forest structures that were evident in the 
past. Although ponderosa pine forests in these regions, 
on the whole, have higher fuel loadings today, these for-
ests did not historically exhibit homogenous structure on 
the landscape scale. In the Southwest, landscapes were 
likely composed of a mosaic of meadows, savannah-
like forests with low tree density interspersed with more 
dense forests with higher canopy cover (Savage 1991). 
In the Front Range, forests were composed of a mix-
ture of persistent old growth, openings, and dense stands 
(Kaufmann and others 2001). The Black Hills histori-
cally exhibited similar heterogeneity in forest structure 

USDA Forest Service RMRS-GTR-198.  2007

(Parrish and others 1996). The variety of species of 
plants and wildlife found in these ponderosa pine forests 
were probably adapted to a wide range of forest struc-
tures (Finch and others 1997; Keane and others 2002). 
To maintain diverse wildlife and plant habitat, manag-
ers should strive to create habitat diversity across the 
landscape within the bounds of the historical range of 
variability in forest structure. This can be achieved by 
designing different treatment prescriptions (including 
no treatment) that result in structural and spatial patterns 
across the landscape that are consistent with historical 
conditions.
Commercial Revenue
Although commercial timber production can be 
obtained from silviculture treatments designed for resto-
ration or hazardous fuel reduction, it is not the primary 
goal of these treatments. Maximizing commercial rev-
enue is often contrary to wildfire hazard reduction and 
other resource management objectives (Allen and others 
2002; Arno and Fiedler 2005; Brown and others 2004; 
Covington and others 1997; Graham and others 1999). 
This does not mean that cutting large fire-resistant trees 
should never be done. In some cases, larger, commer-
cially viable trees need to be removed in order to create 
openings or to reduce canopy bulk density to levels 
that would significantly reduce the probability of active 
crown fire spread (Arno and Fiedler 2005; Hollenstein 
and others 2001; Lynch and others 2000; Scott 1998). 
The revenue gained from commercially viable trees in 
these cases can then be used to offset the cost of remov-
ing non-commercial trees and slash. Any silviculture 
treatment that reduces crown bulk density and surface 
or ladder fuels will have some effect on mitigating fire 
behavior. However, overstory removal and individual 
tree selection cuts that do not remove excess small- and 
intermediate-sized trees have previously been reported 
as ineffective in reducing the potential for extreme fire 
behavior (Graham and others 1999; Martinson and Omi 
2003; Scott 1998; Stephens and Mogahaddas 2005a).
There is some potential to use conventionally non-
merchantable material (small trees, tree tops, branches, 
and shrubs) for bioenergy or other wood products such 
as particle board or paper (Graham and others 1998; 
Harrison 1975; Hollenstein and others 2001; Le Van-
Green and Livingston 2003). With careful planning, 
development of a sustainable long-term biomass harvest 
cycle may be compatible with decreasing wildfire haz-
ard while maintaining ecological integrity (Hollenstein 
and others 2001). However, selling biomass for energy 
is often not economically feasible when other sources of 
energy are inexpensive, processing plants are scarce, and 
access to biomass is restricted (Stokes 1992). Biomass 
heaters have been successfully used on a small scale in 
buildings at the Community College of Santa Fe, NM, 
and in Boulder County, CO. Chipped material can also 
be sold for garden mulch, but again the economical fea-
sibility of this depends on available markets (USDA 
Forest Service 2003c).
Other Objectives
A host of other resource management objectives can 
be met with fuel management treatments. For example, 
fuel treatments can be used to increase forage or shrub 
production and nutritional quality important for a vari-
ety of wildlife species and domesticated animals (Harris 
and Covington 1983; Sieg and Severson 1996; Sieg and 
Wright 1996). Prescribed fire has been used to improve 
grass quality and quantity in the Southwest and Front 
Range (Biswell and others 1973), and to encourage 
shrub resprouting of mountain mahogany in the Front 
Range and bur oak in the Black Hills (Harper and oth-
ers 1985; Sieg and Severson 1996). Fuel treatments can 
also be used to control outbreaks of insects and diseas-
es. Heavier thinning targets have been justified in areas 
severely infested by dwarf mistletoe (Heidmann 1968; 
Myers 1974) and mountain pine beetle (McCambridge 
and Stevens 1982). Fuel treatments have been used to 
increase water yield from watersheds. Heavy cutting of 
trees in patches or strips have been justified for this pur-
pose (Ffolliott and Malchus 2001; Orr 1975).
Summary
In concluding this section, we remind readers that 
forest ecosystems are not static, but dynamic systems 
that are constantly changing. Realistically, forests are 
populations of living organisms where new seedlings are 
constantly establishing, old trees are dying, and all trees 
are increasing in biomass through time. Management ac-
tivities that alter the numbers, sizes, and species of trees 
on a site will have consequences in terms of resource 
allocation and the population dynamics of all organisms 
using the site. For example, a standard fuels treatment 
is a thinning from below to remove ladder fuels and 
reduce crown bulk density. This closely approximates 
the seed cut of a two-step shelterwood harvest where 
the objective is to open the forest canopy and provide 
a seed source to establish a new even-aged forest. We 
must therefore expect abundant natural regeneration to 
establish following the initial entry and be prepared to 

26

periodically re-treat the stand to keep the seedlings from 
growing into ladder fuels. We must also consider the 
remaining overstory trees. Although they are likely to 
live many decades, they will eventually die and require 
replacement to maintain the desired forest structure. In 
the long term, we must therefore balance the need for re-
ducing wildfire risk with the need to maintain a healthy 
viable population of trees along with other resource con-
siderations.

E
ven though most fuel treatments occur on a stand 
level, it is important to consider each treatment in a 
landscape context, especially since wildfires commonly 
dwarf in size individual fuel treatment projects (Sisk and 
others 2004). Historically, the primary scale of forest 
structural variation may have been broad and driven by 
landscape-level fire effects. Structural variation in con-
temporary forests exists at the stand level due to harvests 
and other management activities including fire exclusion 
(Hudak and others 2006). Historical ponderosa pine for-
ests were seldom homogeneous in structure (Savage 
1991). Thus, managers should strive to achieve greater 
landscape heterogeneity within the bounds of the histori-
cal range of variability in forest structure. Yet, landscape 
scale fuel management and restoration treatments have 
been slow to develop (Miller and others 2000). A highly 
heterogeneous landscape is associated with many desir-
able resource conditions, but achieving and sustaining 
this condition requires an understanding of the spatial 
dynamics of the factors that structure the environment. 
These include adequate tools to make good decisions 
about managing these factors, and a management phi-
losophy that incorporates the long term and large scale 
(Lundquist 2005). Recently, much effort has been spent 
on developing landscape scale spatially explicit fuel 
distributions (for example, Reich and others 2004) and 
fire spread models, socioeconomic perceptual models 
of people affected by disturbances (for example, Flint 
2006), and long-term impacts on functions and structure 
of landscapes (Keane and others 2006).
Diseases, insects, and other biotic and abiotic factors 
influence fire regimes, singly or in combination, sequen-
tially or concurrently. Different biotic disturbances, for 
instance, commonly cause characteristic patterns of 
mortality and stand structure across the forest landscape 
that, in turn, change ignition potential, rate and direction 
of spread, and intensity of wildfires. The relative impor-
tance of different disturbance agents would probably 
vary among stands and/or landscapes. Wildfires, in turn, 
change a forest landscape in ways that often influence 
the occurrence, distribution, and epidemiology of forest 
diseases, insect pests, and other small-scale disturbanc-
es. This reciprocal relationship is well recognized, but 
is not well-studied primarily because quantitative tools 
to characterize such interactions are lacking. Ecological 
surprises arise when these events interact with other 
perturbations or agents. Understanding the role of com-
pound disturbances is imperative, yet little research 
exists on this topic (Paine and others 1998).
Models Used to Derive Landscape Strategies
Several tools are available to help managers de-
rive strategies for achieving maximum benefit for fuel 
treatments. One such approach is the Forest Ecological 
Restoration Analysis (ForestERA) project implement-
ed by researchers at Northern Arizona University (Sisk 
and others 2004). In a pilot project conducted in north-
ern Arizona, the researchers have amassed GIS spatial 
data layers that include vegetation composition, cano-
py cover, basal area, stem density, elevation, historical 
fires, ignition points, invasive plant locations, hydrol-
ogy, and soil characteristics. These layers are used to 
develop models that predict risks (for example, fire 
risk, watershed effects, invasive plants) and values (for 
example, wildlife habitat, wilderness, recreation, and 
infrastructure) on the forested landscape. A framework 
is then developed where landscape scale objectives 
and criteria for meeting objectives are defined, and 
then through an iterative modeling process, fuel treat-
ment locations are optimized across the landscape to 
maximize protection of values at risk while achieving 
management objectives.
The Wildfire Alternatives (WALTER) project is 
an approach developed at the University of Arizona 
and currently has assessments available for the Santa 
Catalina Mountains, Chiricahua Mountains, Huachuca 
Mountains in Arizona, and the Jemez Mountains in 
northern New Mexico (University of Arizona 2002). 
This model assesses fire risk across these landscapes 
based on climate, fire history, vegetation, fuels, and soci-
etal values. WALTER allows managers to assess fire risk 
in these landscapes under different climatic scenarios, 
making it useful for developing strategies for optimizing 
placement of fuel treatments across a landscape.

Treatment Strategies

While the above approaches are currently only avail-
able for specific landscapes in the Southwest, another 
approach currently in progress in southern New Mexico 
uses spatial data layers developed from the LANDFIRE 
project. While the data developed in LANDFIRE is less 
detailed than in the previous two examples, it will even-
tually be available for all of North America, making this 
process easily adapted to landscapes in other regions. 
The LANDFIRE project uses biophysical settings and 
simulation modeling to describe historical successional 
vegetation classes and estimates the proportion of the 
landscape that historically existed in each succession 
class. Simulation modeling, satellite imagery, and other 
tools are then used to determine existing vegetation and 
departure from historical conditions. With this process, 
GIS spatial data layers are developed that can be directly 
imported into FARSITE and FlamMap, allowing one to 
evaluate potential fire behavior and spread patterns. The 
data are easily accessible on the LANDFIRE website 
(www.landfire.gov).
Managers and researchers on the Gila National Forest 
have used LANDFIRE data and spatial data locating 
values at risk, including wildland urban interface and 
threatened and endangered species habitat, to develop 
strategies for placing fuel treatments across the land-
scape. Fuel treatment placement is prioritized adjacent 
to values at risk (for example, wildland urban interface, 
Mexican spotted owl habitat) to minimize the threat 
of damage from severe wildfire in areas where fuel 
hazard is greatest. Factors such as prevailing wind, dom-
inant slope, and fuel condition, along with models like 
FlamMap and FARSITE, are considered to determine 
the likelihood of severe fire occurrence and spread in 
any given area. An imperative component of this process 
is the inclusion of land managers that have worked in 
the area for a long time and are able to evaluate the ac-
curacy of the LANDFIRE data and output from models 
like FlamMap and FARSITE based on their experience 
in, and knowledge of, fire behavior in the region.
Lundquist (in press) developed a method of measuring 
the relative importance of individual agents as drivers 
of wildfire using structural equation modeling when 
compound disturbances occur together in the landscape. 
The method was able to separate out the individual im-
pacts of various agents acting concurrently. The method 
developed by Lundquist would certainly be able to iden-
tify the most important factors affecting the ecosystem, 
which might be the type of information needed to priori-
tize fire and fuel treatments (fig. 6).
Prescribed Fire Techniques
Differing levels of fire intensity may be desirable in 
a prescribed fire depending on the amount and type of 
fuel targeted for reduction and different secondary re-
source objectives that may be considered (DeBano and 
others 1998). Fire intensity can be controlled partly by 
environmental conditions in the prescription window. For 
example, higher fire intensity can be expected when fuel 
moisture is low, temperature is high, and winds are strong 
(Pyne and others 1996). Fire intensity can also be con-
trolled through ignition techniques and firing patterns.

equation modeling can be used to 
measure the relative importance 
of individual agents (for example, 
insects and diseases) as drivers of 
wildfire. The effects of fuel generat-
ing disturbances are modeled and 
the predicted results can be used in 
a fire spread model.

Low Intensity Prescribed Fire
Low intensity prescribed fire can be used to reduce the 
potential for severe fire spread by reducing fuel loads, 
particularly for surface fuels, including litter, duff, and 
woody debris (Bastain 2001; Biswell and others 1973; 
Cooper 1961; Covington and Sackett 1984; Davis and 
others 1968; Harrington 1981; Sackett 1980) (fig. 7). 
They can also be used to consume small tree seedlings to 
slow development of ladder fuels (Arno and Harrington 
1997; Arno and Fiedler 2005; Harrington 1981) (fig. 8) 
or to scorch the lower limbs of trees and saplings to in-
crease crown base height and reduce the potential for 
torching of trees (Agee and Skinner 2005; Gaines and 
others 1958). Reduction in these fuels should reduce the 
potential for severe wildfire spread (fig. 9).
Low intensity prescribed fire may also be used to 
reduce unusually large accumulations of surface fu-
els, such as slash loadings after a thinning operation. 
However, excessively high fuel loading can promote sur-
face fires of high intensity and undesirable fire effects, 
particularly on soil resources. Although many managers 
feel uncomfortable using prescribed fire in these situa-
tions, some have used broadcast burns to reduce slash 
loading within a year of the thinning operation. This can 
be safely done when larger diameter fuels and duff are 
sufficiently wet to prevent high intensity fire, but red 
needles attached to branches will facilitate the rate of 
fire spread. These fires generally consume only 1- and 
10-hour fuels, limiting fire intensity and damage to trees 
(Biswell and others 1973; Orozco and Carrillo 1992-
93). Consumption of remaining slash and duff can be 
achieved with subsequent burns. Managers have been 
successful in experimentally burning red slash in the 
summer 2 to 4 days following rain events (Orozco and 
Carrillo 1992-93). Alternatively, the excess material can 
be put into piles that can then be burned. This generally 
carries less risk than broadcast burning, as piles can be 
burned in the winter when fire risk is lower.
Restoration objectives can be met by using low in-
tensity prescribed fire. In most ponderosa pine forests, 
low intensity surface fire made up some component of 
the historical disturbance regime. Thus, returning low 
intensity fire to the landscape is a vital component of 
restoration. Fire can be effective in creating diversity 
in habitat structure on the stand scale (Severson and 
Rinne 1990) (fig. 10). Returning fire would be important 
for other ecological processes such as nutrient cycling 
and understory production (Covington and Sackett 
1992; Harris and Covington 1983). The burning cycle 
conducted by managers should be consistent with the 
historical range of variability in fire frequency of a site 
(Arno and Fiedler 2005). Since surface fuels accumulate 
at relatively rapid rates in southwestern ponderosa pine 
forests (Ffolliott and others 1977; Ffolliott and Guertin 
1988), researchers have recommended burning every 3 
to 10 years, consistent with the historical range of vari-
ability in fire frequency (Allen and others 1968; Biswell 
and others 1973; Harrington and Sackett 1990; Sackett 
and others 1996). However, rates of surface fuel accu-
mulation vary by region. In the Black Hills and Front 
Range, where natural fire was historically less frequent, 
prescribed fire can be repeated with longer intervals be-
tween fires. Here, conducting low intensity prescribed 
fire every 15 to 25 years in lower elevation forests is 
recommended (Bachelet and others 2000). In the Front

Range, low intensity prescribed fires are recommended 
at intervals of 3 to 20 years or more, consistent with the 
historical fire return interval at various locations and 
elevations (City of Boulder 1999; Kaufmann and oth-
ers 2005). Historical fire regime can vary widely within 
a given region (see tables 1, 3, and 4). This variabili-
ty should be considered in fuel treatments in order to 
achieve heterogeneity at the stand and landscape level.
High Intensity Prescribed Fire
High intensity prescribed fire that often exhibits some 
torching can be used to reduce the potential for high-
severity wildfire spread by reducing ladder and some 
canopy fuels (Biswell and others 1973; Fule and oth-
ers 2002a; Fule and others 2004; Harrington and Sackett 
1990; Lindenmuth 1960; Morris and Mowat 1958; 
Woodridge and Weaver 1965) (fig. 11). Prescribed fire 
treatments with some torching may be appropriate when 
the use of mechanical equipment to thin trees is not feasi-
ble because of limited access or other restrictions (Aplet 
and Wilmer 2003; DellaSalla and Frost 2001; Fule and 
others 2002a). Opportunities for use of high intensity 
prescribed fire may be limited because of the risk of fire 
escape and the proximity of ponderosa pine forests to 
population centers in the Southwest, Front Range, and 
Black Hills. However, use of small-scale (< 5 acres in 
size) high intensity fire has been achieved successfully 
in limited areas including ponderosa pine forests in the 
Arapaho-Roosevelt, San Juan, Prescott, Santa Fe, and 
Black Hills National Forests, and Bandelier National 
Monument. The torching pattern can create forest open-
ings, stands with lower tree density, and increased 
structural diversity.
High intensity prescribed fire can also be used to meet 
restoration objectives. Relatively small-scale crown 
fires were a component of the historical fire regimes in 
certain ponderosa pine forests in the Front Range and 
Black Hills (Baker and others 2007; Huckaby and others 
2001; Kaufmann and others 2000; Sherriff and Veblen 
2007). From a restoration perspective, it may be desir-
able to duplicate some of this fire behavior and resultant 
fire effects where possible. High-severity crown fires 
were likely more common in higher elevation forests 
and on north-facing aspects where conditions were more 
mesic (Sherriff and Veblen 2007). The size of patches 
in these forests that experienced high fire severity is 
not well understood, but were likely variable in size 
(Kauffmann and others 2003). Since such events likely 
occurred with long return intervals and the historical 
extent of such events is not well understood, using this 
technique extensively under the guise of restoration is 
not recommended. Instead, high intensity prescribed fire 
may be used to a limited extent where feasible to cre-
ate landscape heterogeneity that would have been more 
characteristic of historical forests (fig. 12).

scribed fire, which exhib-

Prescribed fires that exhibit some torching can be 
used to meet other resource management objectives 
as well. Such fires may be more effective in reducing 
dwarf mistletoe infection on trees in the Southwest 
and Front Range (Alexander and Hawksworth 1976; 
Conklin and Armstrong 2001). High intensity surface 
fires may be effective in stimulating sprouting of shrubs 
that are important browse for wildlife (Bock and Bock 
1984; Harrington 1985; Sieg and Wright 1996; Young 
and Baily 1975). Higher intensity surface fire may also 
be needed to control dense thickets of Gambel oak in 
the Southwest that can act as a ladder fuel (Harrington 
1985) (fig. 13).
Controlling Fire Intensity
Prescription window—Fire intensity can be controlled 
by burning under specific conditions of fuels, weather, 
and topography, all of which affect fire behavior and 
make up the prescription window. If lower fire inten-
sity is desired, burns can be conducted when relative 
humidity and fuel moisture contents are high and wind 
speeds are low. Burning on a steep slope will result 
in faster rate of spread and fire intensity compared to 
burning on a gentle slope. A fire will burn with higher 
intensity when more heavy fuel is available to burn. Fuel 
loading or arrangement can be altered through various 
Figure 12. Higher intensity prescribed 
fire can be used to create a more 
heterogeneous landscape. Photo

southwestern Colorado, can grow

mechanical means (discussed elsewhere in this publica-
tion) to achieve desired fuel conditions and subsequent 
prescribed fire behavior. Less intensive actions can also 
be taken to alter fuel loading or structure. For example, 
managers on the Colorado State Forest often hand-re-
move heavy fuels from selected portions of a burn unit 
prior to ignition to prevent high fire intensity around 
sensitive areas (for example, old trees, fire lines, and so 
forth). This practice is common when managers conduct 
low intensity fires in open ponderosa pine forests with 
grassy understories.
Firing patterns and ignition techniques—Fire inten-
sity can also be controlled on the ground through use 
of alternate firing patterns. Although many patterns are 
available, the most commonly used patterns are backing 
fires and strip head fires. Backing fires are set along a fuel 
break and allowed to spread against the wind or down a 
moderate slope (Brown and Davis 1973; Chandler and 
others 1983; Kilgore and Curtis 1987; Pyne and others 
1996) (fig. 14). They generally result in a slow moving 
fire of minimal intensity with more complete combus-
tion of fuels. This technique requires a steady wind and 
is often not suitable for very steep slopes. Backing fires 
are not often used exclusively in a project, as it takes a 
considerable amount of time to burn a large unit using 
this method. They are more commonly used to create 
black lines or to burn portions of units where extreme 
fire behavior poses a threat.
In contrast to backing fires, strip head fires are set so 
that the flaming front spreads in the direction of the wind 
or slope (Brown and Davis 1973; Chandler and others 
1983) (fig. 15). Typically, a broad fuelbreak is burned at 
Figure 14. Backing

the top of the unit before a head fire is 
set, or a natural firebreak is used as an 
anchor point. Head fires tend to be very 
intense and burn with a rapid rate of 
spread. For more control, head fires can 
be set in portions (strips). For example, 
a head fire can be lit somewhere below 
the fire break at the top of the unit and 
allowed to burn to the fire break. This 
process can then be repeated until the 
entire unit is burned. Fire intensity can 
be controlled by the spacing interval be-
tween strips, but will also vary with fuel 
loading and fuel moisture. Wide strips 
may reduce fire intensity in light fuels, 
but can increase intensity in heavier fu-
els. For example, wide spacings have 
been used in the Black Hills to complete 
a stand replacement prescribed burn in 
areas with heavier fuels (Henry Goehle, 
personal communication). Intervals between strips can 
range from 10 to 200 feet depending on desired fire be-
havior and fuel loading. Different firing patterns, such as 
jackpot and spot firing, can also be used to create higher 
fire intensity to thin stands (fig. 16).
Fire intensity can also be controlled by use of differ-
ent ignition techniques. Certain ignition tools allow for 
more fire to be placed on the ground in a short amount 
of time, thereby increasing fire intensity (Brown 1984). 
Aerial ignition devices (for example, helitorch, ping-
pong balls) are likely to result in higher fire intensity 
than hand ignition devices (for example, drip torch, fus-
es) (fig. 17). Different ignition devices are discussed in 
the Tools Used in Burning section below.
Wildland Fire Use
In certain areas, managers use fires that are naturally 
ignited by lightning to achieve resource benefit. This 
practice is termed wildland fire use for resource benefit, 
or wildland fire use (WFU). Such fires typically burn for 
multiple days or weeks and exhibit varied fire behavior 
and resultant fire effects. WFU is often practiced in re-
mote areas where risk of wildfire impacting humans is 
low and cost to suppress is high (fig. 18).
Tools Used in Burning
Burning and fuel break tools—Most prescribed fire 
treatments can be accomplished with hand crews using 
drip torches. For larger areas, aerial ignition devices may 
be used. These include delayed aerial ignition devices 
(DAID), or ping-pong ball system, and the helitorch, 
Figure 16. Example of spot firing. Depending on the type of fuel 
targeted and the number of ignitions, this firing technique 
can be used to create higher intensity. Photo credit: Paul 
Summerfelt.

of firing patterns. Photo credit: Mark Roper.

or flying drip torch system. Aerial systems reduce the 
amount of time it takes to light an area and thus may 
be most efficiently used on large treatment units. For 
example, managers on the San Juan National Forest 
have found it cost effective to use aerial ignition devices 
when units are greater than 500 acres. Aerial ignition de-
vices have also been used on smaller units in Wind Cave 
National Park in areas where topography creates unsafe 
conditions for hand crews. The ping-pong ball system is 
particularly useful when a mosaic burn pattern is desir-
able. In northern Arizona, the gentle terrain allows for 
frequent use of ATVs with mounted drip torches, which 
also can decrease the amount of time required to burn an 
area. ATVs have also been used in the Front Range on 
the Pike-San Isabel NF.
For building fuel breaks, hoses, foam, hand crews, or 
dozers can be used. Dozers are generally needed only 
to create fuel breaks if fuel treatments are conducted in 
heavily stocked stands and if there are values at risk near 
the treatment area. In northern Arizona, smaller fuel 
breaks are constructed with an ATV by dragging a truck 
wheel rim filled with concrete. This technique is more 
productive than hand crews, yet does not cause as much 
disturbance as dozers (soil compaction and tree dam-
age). ATVs are more easily used on gentle terrain with 
light surface fuels where soils are not excessively rocky. 
Dozers are more suited to construct fuel breaks in situa-
tions where fire intensities will be greater and terrain and 
soils are conducive to their use, as in the Black Hills.
Models used in planning—Different models can be 
used for planning prescribed fires at stand and landscape 
scales. On the stand level, the fire behavior predic-
tion systems BehavePlus and NEXUS can be used to 
evaluate the effects of a range of fuel, weather, and to-
pography variables on surface and crown fire behavior 
characteristics such as flame lengths, rate of spread, and 
fire intensity (Burgan and Rothermel 1984; Scott 1999). 
BehavePlus, in particular, is commonly used to derive 
a range of weather variables that will achieve desired 
fire behavior for a particular prescribed fire. NEXUS is 
commonly used to ensure treatments have effectively 
reduced the potential for active and passive crown fire 
initiation and spread. The effects of projected fire be-
havior characteristics on important fire effects such as 
tree mortality, fuel consumption, smoke production, and 
soil heating can be evaluated using the First Order Fire 
Effects Model (FOFEM) (Reinhardt and others 1997).
On a landscape scale, models like FlamMap and 
FARSITE can be used for a variety of planning purpos-
es. FlamMap assesses wildlife risk across a landscape by 
creating maps of potential fire behavior characteristics 
(rate of spread, flame length) based on fuel structure, 
Figure 18. A wildland fire use (WFU) event (Taylor fire) on the Gila National Forest. WFU events often exhibit 
variable fire behavior and result in a wide array of fire effects. Photo credit: Michael Andreu.

weather, and topography. FARSITE predicts spread pat-
terns of fires over landscapes based on fuels, weather, 
and topography (Finney 1998). FARSITE is often used 
in management of large or complex fires to inform, for 
example, where resources may be best placed. Both 
models can also be used to assess the potential effec-
tiveness of fuel treatments in reducing the potential for 
severe fire spread across a landscape (Stratton 2004). 
In the past, a limitation on the use of these models has 
been the availability of spatial GIS data layers needed to 
run the models. However, the LANDFIRE project is in 
the process of making such data available for the entire 
country. It is imperative to consult managers with a great 
deal of experience in, and knowledge of, a particular re-
gion to help verify model results. Models are useful, but 
they are often imprecise as is the data that goes into them 
and thus, they should never substitute for practitioner 
knowledge and experience.
Thinning Techniques
Silviculture Background
In the context of fuel treatment, thinning refers to the 
reduction of above-ground biomass by the removal of 
trees from a forest. Thinning affects fire behavior by 
changing both the amount and distribution of fuel avail-
able to burn. It is used primarily to lower the risk of 
crown fire by reducing crown bulk density. Although 
tree boles aren’t often consumed in crown fires, increas-
ing the spacing between trees and removing smaller 
trees whose crowns serve as ladder fuels can dramatical-
ly alter potential crown fire behavior in a conifer forest. 
Thinning also affects how trees grow and can profound-
ly affect how forests develop in the future, including 
how fuels will be distributed in those future forests. Use 
of traditional silvicultural methods is practical for fuels 
reduction because prescriptions can be communicated 
effectively across disciplines and agencies (Arno and 
Fiedler 2005). Therefore, we feel a short discussion of 
thinning from a silviculture standpoint will be beneficial 
in understanding its effects from a fuel treatment stand-
point.
Thinning is an intermediate silviculture treatment 
intended to improve growing conditions in forests man-
aged under even-aged systems where mature trees will 
eventually be removed and replaced by a new forest. 
There are six general methods of thinning originally de-
veloped for management of commercial timber, but they 
can also be used for restoration and to promote reduced 
crown fire potential. These methods include crown thin-
ning or thinning from above, low thinning or thinning 
from below, selection thinning, free thinning, geomet-
ric thinning, and variable density thinning (Graham and 
others 1999; Peterson and others 2005; Smith and oth-
ers 1997). In crown thinning, trees in the upper crown 
classes are targeted for removal to release trees in the 
same size class from competition and increase their 
growth rates. In low thinning, trees in the lower crown 
classes are mostly targeted for removal, although some 
co-dominant trees can be targeted depending on the 
intensity of the treatment. Free thinning is a highly vari-
able treatment in which individual trees are targeted for 
removal for the purposes of releasing desirable trees 
from competition. In selection thinning, the most eco-
nomically viable trees are removed to stimulate growth 
of suppressed and intermediate trees in the understory. In 
geometric thinning, tree removal is based on spacing or 
geometric pattern. Variable density thinning utilizes low 
thinning in combination with at least one of the other 
methods. In all cases, thinning under even-aged man-
agement is intended to promote the health and vigor of 
the forest until it matures, is harvested, and is replaced 
with a new forest.
In contrast to even-aged management, forests under 
uneven-aged management are maintained through time 
within a range of desired spatial and structural condi-
tions where trees of all sizes and ages are represented in 
the overall forest structure. Periodic removals similar to 
thinning are used to maintain the desired conditions in 
uneven-aged forests, but differ in that trees of all sizes 
are typically removed.
Fuel reduction or restoration treatments may be ap-
plied in forests under both even- and uneven-aged 
management systems. Uneven-aged management is 
more appropriate when the intention is to maintain a 
diverse forest structure containing trees of various age 
classes continuously through time on a site to mimic 
historic conditions as occurred at various scales in pon-
derosa pine stands in the Black Hills, Front Range, and 
Southwest. On the other hand, even-aged systems, such 
as shelterwood and seed tree methods, are relatively 
easy to implement and have been used widely in the 
Black Hills, Front Range, and Southwest on lands suit-
able for timber production (Schubert 1974; Shepperd 
and Battaglia 2002). In both cases, when trees reach ma-
turity they are removed in one or more entries after a 
new crop of seedlings has been established.
Periodic removals under uneven-aged management 
take the place of both thinning and harvest cuts under 
even-aged management. Although some old, large trees 
are removed in each entry, at no point in time are all 
mature trees harvested from the stand. Control of grow-
ing stock under uneven-aged management methods is 

USDA Forest Service RMRS-GTR-198.  2007	
37
a bit more complicated than with even-aged manage-
ment. Stocking is controlled by diameter/age classes 
using either the BDQ method (Alexander and Edminster 
1977) or Stand Density Index (SDI) (Long 1995; 
Shepperd 2007). In both methods, one needs to deter-
mine the range of diameters and the residual stocking 
desired for a given stand. The techniques differ in their 
method for determining the distribution of trees in dif-
ferent size classes, but both enable an infinite variety of 
stand configurations from very open to heavily-stocked. 
Uneven-aged removals can accomplish many of the fuels 
treatments done with even-aged thinning, although fuels 
managers need to appreciate the differences between the 
two management systems. Application of uneven-aged 
silviculture on the ground is not much harder than even-
aged treatments, as diameter-class removals can often be 
collapsed into broad structure or size classes. Although 
both even- and uneven-aged management are appropri-
ate for ponderosa pine forests, from a fuels standpoint, 
both systems will require periodic treatments to main-
tain desired fuels conditions. The main difference will 
be what the stand will look like in the long term and 
what mix of resource use and management emphasis is 
placed on a particular piece of ground.
Reducing Wildfire Hazard
Certain thinning methods can be used to reduce the 
potential for active crown fire spread through reductions 
in canopy fuel loading, in particular canopy bulk density. 
However, while all thinning treatments technically result 
in reductions in canopy fuels, they will not all be effec-
tive in reducing the potential for torching and crown fire 
spread (Graham and others 1999; Peterson and others 
2005). Thinning treatments that use low, free, or vari-
able density thinning methods are most likely to result in 
reduced potential for crown fire spread (Graham and oth-
ers 1999; Peterson and others 2005; Scott 1998; Smith 
and others 1997; Stephens and Moghaddas 2005a), as 
are uneven-aged treatments that emphasize removal 
of small trees (Skog and others 2006). These methods 
can effectively increase canopy base height, decrease 
canopy bulk density, and decrease canopy continuity, 
factors that are needed to reduce the potential for torch-
ing, crown fire initiation, and crown fire spread (Agee 
and Skinner 2005; Skog and others 2006). Any removal 
of trees that results in reductions in canopy bulk density 
and continuity can be effective in reducing the potential 
for active crown fire spread. However, if these reduc-
tions only occur in the upper levels of the canopy, high 
crown fire spread rates may still be a factor in lower por-
tions of the canopy. Tree removals often are not effective 
in increasing canopy base height unless smaller trees 
and lower limbs are removed as well. Thus, the poten-
tial for torching is generally not reduced after treatments 
that utilize crown, selection, or geometric thinning tech-
niques where only large trees are removed. Subsequent 
treatment or removal of slash created by thinning opera-
tions is critical to maximize the benefits of the thinning. 
Slash left on ground will significantly increase fire be-
havior, even after 20 years and especially during drought 
conditions (Henry Goehle, personal communication).
Intensive treatments in which a great deal of material 
is removed in a short time period may be problematic as 
they can have detrimental impacts on native microbial 
and vegetation composition and diversity. For example, 
as disturbance intensity increases in fuel treatments, the 
potential for invasive species establishment tends to in-
crease (Martinson and others, in press). However, if too 
little is removed, the treatment may be ineffective in re-
ducing wildfire hazard. In order to be effective, multiple 
entries may be needed, increasing costs and prolonging 
environmental impacts.
There may be instances where reducing the threat 
of wildfire trumps other objectives. For example, in 
the wildland urban interface, protection of communi-
ties from wildfires is generally the primary objective. 
In such cases, the level of tree removal may justifiably 
be more intensive. Definitions of wildland urban inter-
face vary, but it generally extends to at least 200 feet 
from structures and in some cases up to 1.5 miles from 
communities (Gatewood and Summerfelt 2005). In the 
wildland urban interface, particularly in areas within 200 
feet of structures, thinning treatments may be designed 
to reduce the potential for crown fire spread and create 
“defensible space” that provide firefighters safe condi-
tions for battling oncoming wildfires (Gatewood and 
Summerfelt 2005; Nowicki 2001). Some have recom-
mended that treatments in the defensible zone include 
removal of ladder fuels and thinning so that tree canopy 
spacing is a minimum of 10 feet (Dennis 1999; Nowicki 
2001). This should sufficiently reduce the potential for 
spread of crown fire in the wildland urban interface. 
Other treatment techniques may accomplish the same 
objectives, but many have not been sufficiently tested.
Restoration
Certain thinning techniques can be used to achieve 
objectives of restoring historical forest structure. 
Prescriptions designed to restore historical forest struc-
ture vary across the range of ponderosa pine, as historical 
disturbance processes and forest structures were very 
different in different regions (see Section II—Fire and 
Fuels Issues). Even within a region, landscapes were 
likely heterogeneous in forest structure and disturbance

processes in both time and space. Such heterogeneity 
should be met in current landscapes by creating variable 
prescriptions that fit within the natural variability in his-
torical forest structure.
Southwest—Evidence of historical forest structure 
in a stand, such as pre-settlement trees, downed logs, 
stumps, and snags, should be used to restore histori-
cal structure in southwestern ponderosa pine forests. 
All pre-settlement trees should be retained in a thin-
ning operation. Retaining post-settlement trees around 
pre-Euro-American settlement trees is recommended to 
restore the historical spatial pattern of trees (clumps of 
trees and openings), (Covington and others 1997; Fule 
and others 2002a; Moore and others 1999). The number 
of post-settlement trees retained can vary depending on 
historical tree density (table 2). It has also been recom-
mended that post-settlement trees should be retained as 
replacement trees around large downed logs, stumps, or 
snags, which provide evidence as to where pre-settle-
ment trees existed in the stand (Covington and others 
1997; Fule and others 2002a; Moore and others 1999) 
(fig. 19).
In many cases, restoration options may be limited 
because of lack of old-growth trees and site specific his-
torical data. In such cases, information about historical 
tree density, species composition, and other attributes 
from similar forests can be used as a guide. It is impor-
tant to understand that historical forest structure likely 
varied throughout the Southwest at local and landscape 
scales, and local conditions should be considered when 
designing restoration treatments. For example, histori-
cal tree density in the northern Arizona ranged from 25 
to 100 trees per acre and basal area varied from 34 to 
125 ft2 per acre (Fule and others 1997; Fule and oth-
ers 2002a; Moore and others 2004). Trees were into 
0.05 to 0.7 acre clumps of 2 to 40 trees (Covington and 
others 1997; White 1985). As a result, there has been a 
wide range in target basal areas (40 to 70 ft2/acre) and 
tree density (35 to 110 trees/acre) in restoration treat-
ments throughout the Southwest (Edminster and Olsen 
1996; Fiedler and Keegan 2003; Fight and others 2004; 
Schumann 2004). To mimic historical forest structure as 
best possible, most treatment prescriptions involve re-
taining the largest trees and leaving trees in a clumped 
distribution. In areas where tree density would likely 
have been higher historically, such as on north aspects 
or in canyon bottoms, basal area targets may be higher 
(fig. 20).
Most ponderosa pine forests in the Southwest his-
torically exhibited uneven-aged forest structure at some 
scale. Treatments should be designed to mimic this 
structure as best possible. Uneven-aged management

methods have been developed to create historical for-
est structures (Edminster and Olsen 1996) and to meet 
specific fuels treatment objectives (Shepperd and others 
2005; Skog and others 2006) (see Techniques section).
On a landscape scale, ponderosa pine forests in the 
Southwest were historically composed of a mosaic 
of openings and forested stands with variable density 
(Savage 1991). For the purposes of restoration, managers 
should strive to recreate this landscape heterogeneity by 
designing and utilizing a variety of treatment prescriptions 
(including no treatment) across the landscape. Different 
management objectives (for example, wildlife habitat pro-
tection, and wildland urban interface) may facilitate use 
of different treatment strategies in different areas on the 
landscape and this may encourage landscape heterogene-
ity in forest structure. When available, localized data on 
historical forest structure should guide treatment prescrip-
tions. If historical data is not available, managers can vary 
treatment prescriptions based on topographic features. 
For example, forests may have been denser historically 
on sites at higher elevations, on north-facing aspects, or 
on sites with productive soils.
Colorado Front Range—Based on historical forest 
structure and composition of low elevation montane for-
ests in the central Front Range, Kaufmann and others 
(2003) recommends treatments that will create open-
ings of various sizes so that they account for 15 to 25 
percent of the landscape, reduce tree density so canopy 
cover is 10 to 30 percent across the landscape, remove 
Douglas-fir trees except on north aspects, and retain old-
growth trees. Managers in the Front Range often take 
these recommendations into account for fuel reduction 
projects (USDA Forest Service 2004b, 2004c). Patch 
cuts are used to create openings up to 5 acres in size. 
Between patch cuts, stands are thinned from below to 
reduce tree density by 20 to 30 percent. Managers fo-
cus on achieving stand structure with a variety of age 
classes and spatial patterns, as forests were historically 
uneven-aged in structure (fig. 21). Both the BDQ and 
SDI methods can be used to develop targets for numbers

tains, NM. Residual tree density was higher in drainages

of trees desired in various age or size classes (Brown 
and others 2001a; Shepperd 2007; Shepperd and others 
2005). To promote development of old growth condi-
tions, large and old-growth trees should be retained 
(Brown and others 2001a; Kaufmann and others 2003; 
USDA Forest Service 2004b, 2004c). Managers can use 
the guide developed by Huckaby and others (2003) to 
identify old ponderosa pine trees.
In some portions of the northern Front Range, re-
searchers have found that higher elevation forests 
(above 2100  m) historically had much longer fire re-
turn intervals and thus, were likely controlled more by 
an infrequent high-severity fire regime (Ehle and Baker 
2003; Sherriff and Veblen, in press). In these forests, 
dense even-aged cohorts of trees likely followed high 
intensity disturbance events. In such forests, researchers 
have recommended a more gentle approach to resto-
ration. Such thinning will likely have some effect on 
crown fire risk factors, but will likely be inadequate to 
meet all fire risk reduction needs in areas where this type 
of ponderosa pine forest occurs in an urban interface. It 
is also unclear if this approach is appropriate for higher 
elevation montane forests in other portions of the Front 
Range (Kaufmann and others 2006) since the data from 
the above studies is limited.
Ponderosa pine forests in most of the Front Range 
were historically composed of a mosaic of persistent old 
growth, openings, and forests of pure ponderosa pine and 
mixtures of ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir with vari-
able density (Huckaby and others 2001; Kaufmann and 
others 2000; Sherriff and Veblen, in press). For restora-
tion purposes, managers should attempt to recreate this 
landscape heterogeneity in forest structure by designing 
a variety of treatment prescriptions appropriate for dif-
ferent conditions. For example, forests in the grassland/
forest ecotone and lower montane forests, ranging from 
1700 m elevation in the southern Front Range to 2100 
m in the northern Front Range (Kaufmann and others 
2006), likely had much lower tree density historically. 
Thus, heavier treatment prescriptions may be appropri-
ate (Huckaby and others 2001; Kaufmann and others 
2000; Mast and others 1998; Sherriff and Veblen 2007). 
In higher elevation montane forests and on north-facing 
aspects, tree density was likely higher historically (Ehle 
and Baker 2003; Huckaby and others 2001; Kaufmann 
and others 2000; Sherriff and Veblen 2007) and less 
intensive treatments would be more appropriate. The 
trade-off is that historically these latter forests were more 
likely subject to crown fires and would continue to be at 
higher risk to crown fire if higher densities are main-
tained. The key to dealing with this risk at the landscape 
scale is to make sure denser forests are isolated within 
the landscape by stands at lower risk to crown fire so that 
the risk of a landscape-wide crown fire is reduced.
Black Hills—The historical forest structure of the 
Black Hills included dense stands that may have been 
conducive to crown fire (Graves 1899; Parrish and oth-
ers 1996; Progulske 1974). Given that crown fires were 
a component of the historical fire regime (Brown and 
Sieg 1996; Shinneman and Baker 1997), complete forest 
restoration may not be realistic for the Black Hills as it 
would conflict with current management objectives and 
land use. However, attempting to restore some aspects 
of historical forest structure and processes in Black Hills 
forests is likely to benefit native species that evolved 
with historical forest conditions and will positively af-
fect current fire risk.
The current condition of the Black Hills has devi-
ated from historical conditions in a variety of ways. 
Landscapes within the Black Hills are more homogenous 
in forest structure today than historically (Parrish and 
others 1996; Progulske 1974). Thus, thinning treatments 
can be designed to make the landscape more heteroge-
neous with stands of varying age structures interspersed 
throughout the landscape. In the drier portions of the 
Black Hills and in meadows, tree density is higher today 
than it was historically (McAdams 1995; Parrish and 
others 1996; Progulske 1974). In these cases, restoring 
historical forest structure would be consistent with re-
ducing the potential for crown fires (fig. 22). Average 
tree size across the Black Hills is lower today than it was 
historically (Brown and Cook 2006; McAdams 1995). 
Recruitment of larger trees would not only reduce the 
potential for catastrophic wildfire, as large trees are 
more resistant to fire-induced mortality and have higher 
crown base heights, but it would also benefit many wild-
life species that prefer large diameter trees and snags. 
This is particularly important for the northern goshawk, 
brown creeper, northern flying squirrel, and many wood-
pecker species (Shepperd and Battaglia 2002; USDA 
Forest Service 2003b).
Other Thinning Objectives
Reducing forest density also meets other resource 
management objectives. For example, the Flagstaff 
Fire Department treats mistletoe infested stands by 
completely removing small pockets of infestation (less 
than ¼ acre) or by isolating larger patches with a bar-
rier of 50 feet to reduce further spread (Farnsworth 
and Summerfelt 2001). Pockets that are infested with 
Ips beetles or mountain pine beetles are often targeted 
for heavier thinning treatments (USDA Forest Service 
2003a). Both of these treatments will reduce the poten-
tial for crown fire spread as well.

As we mentioned earlier, regeneration of tree and 
shrub species in the forest understory may be a concern 
for land managers when the canopy is opened up. This 
can be particularly important for shrub species such as 
Gambel oak and Rocky Mountain juniper. These spe-
cies act as ladder fuels, increasing fire hazard in open 
ponderosa pine stands. To prevent this, some managers 
maintain higher basal area targets in a thinning opera-
tion. For example, foresters in the Colorado State Forest 
often used higher residual stocking levels (Basal area = 
80 ft2/acre) when there are many shrubs in the understory 
and lower stocking levels (Basal area = 40 ft2/acre when 
there is mostly grass in the understory. The trade-off be-
tween maintaining open forests at lower risk to crown 
fire and avoiding buildups of surface and ladder fuels 
may be more frequent prescribed burning or mechanical 
treatments to keep regeneration and shrubs in check.
Harvest Methods
Trees can be cut, processed, and removed from the 
forest using a variety of methods, including whole-tree 
harvesting, cut-to-length systems, or cable yarding (Fight 
and others 1999; Hartsough and others 1998; Windell 
and Bradshaw 2000). Processing harvested trees involves 
removing the limbs and tops of trees and cutting them 
into merchantable lengths and can occur in the woods, or 
at a landing. With each method, a variety of equipment 
can be used to cut and remove the trees (Holtzscher and 
Lanford 1997). In whole-tree harvesting, trees are felled 
and immediately removed to a landing area where they 
are processed. In cut-to-length systems, trees are felled 
and processed at the stump before being transported to a 
landing. In cable yarding, trees are felled and removed via 
a skyline cable system and can be processed at the stump 
or at the landing. Cable yarding is generally reserved 
for steep slopes, where use of other types of mechanical 
equipment is restricted (Fiedler and others 1999). Smaller 
trees can be hand or machine felled, or processed using 
masticators, which grind trees to the stump and disperse 
the resulting small material on the site.
Tools Used for Thinning
Chainsaws—Hand felling of trees of many different 
sizes can be accomplished effectively using chainsaws 
(Arno and Fiedler 2005; Larson and Hallman 1980; Scott 
1998; Stephens and Moghaddas 2005b). Using chainsaws 
is advantageous as it requires very little capital invest-
ment in equipment and they can be used in areas that are 
not accessible to mechanical equipment (for example, 
steep slopes and remote areas). However, hand felling 
is inherently dangerous as crews are directly exposed to 
multiple hazards during the logging. Furthermore, hand 
felling is labor intensive and generally not as productive 
as mechanical equipment. Thus, mechanical equipment 
is more economical, especially on large treatment units 
(Wang and others 1998). For large treatments accessible 
by road and in operable topography, mechanical equip-
ment may be most appropriate.
Feller-bunchers and tree shears—Trees can be har-
vested mechanically using feller-bunchers or tree 
shears. Feller-bunchers use hydraulic grapple arms to 
hold the tree while it is cut (fig. 23). On some machines, 
a gathering device makes it possible to cut and collect 
several trees before they are dropped in a bunch. The 
cutting devices (for example, feller buncher and tree 
shear) can be attached to an articulating arm or boom, 
or directly to a tractor or other vehicle. A boom allows 
the machine to reach into stands to collect trees and 
minimizes travel over the site (fig. 24). Some mastica-
tion equipment can also be used to remove small trees. 
Commonly used mastication equipment is described 
in the following Other Mechanical and Combination 
Techniques section.

Forest. Photo credit: Molly Hunter.

Prime movers—Vehicles serving as prime movers 
for harvesting heads (for example feller-bunchers and 
tree shears) generally include excavators, all surface 
vehicles, or four-wheel drive tractors, and they provide 
both the maneuverability and power supply for the cut-
ting heads. Smaller machines, appropriate for small 
diameter material, are generally more maneuverable and 
apply less ground pressure than large machines. Rubber-
tired machines disturb soil less than skid-steer tracked 
machines but have a smaller footprint and thus, may 
compact the soil to a greater extent. Use of larger ma-
chines is generally only appropriate and economical if 
large diameter material is being removed. It is important 
to contact the manufacturer to ensure a head is matched 
with an appropriate machine that will provide sufficient 
power. Windell and Bradshaw (2000) and Jones and 
Stokes (2004) provide a summary of commonly used 
feller-bunchers and tree shears and their specifications.
Tree harvesters—Trees can also be felled using tree 
harvesters (Larson and Hallman 1980). Use of these 
machines is advantageous because they can also de-
limb, sort, and buck logs in the woods. A disadvantage 
of harvesters is that they often have limited maneuver-
ability and thus can cause considerable residual stem 
damage. Also, they are generally not effective in de-
limbing trees with large branches (Hartsough and others 
1998) and often are not as productive as other methods 
(Holtzscher and Lanford 1997; Wang and others 1998). 
Tree harvesters leave branches and un-merchantable 
portions of trees scattered in the woods, which can sig-
nificantly increase surface fuel loadings. Windell and 
Bradshaw (2000) and Jones and Stokes (2004) provide 
a summary of commonly used tree harvesters and their 
specifications.
Tree processors—Tree processing involves removal 
of limbs and tree tops and cutting logs to merchantable

lengths. This can be accomplished at the stump or at the 
landing. Tree processing can be accomplished effec-
tively using hand crews with chain saws. Alternatively, 
tree processing can be achieved using a mechanized pro-
cessor. Here again, using chainsaws is advantageous as 
it requires little capital investment, although their use 
poses a safety risk for hand crews and they are often not 
as productive as mechanical processors (Holtzscher and 
Lanford 1997). Mechanized equipment may be more 
appropriate for treating large areas. Landing-based pro-
cessors, such as boom delimbers, process whole trees 
that have been skidded to a central landing, separating 
merchantable material from tops, branches, and unmer-
chantable sections of logs and piling the debris in large 
piles at the landing for later disposal by burning or fur-
ther processing. This equipment has the advantage of 
concentrating all slash into one location and will not in-
crease surface fuel loadings in the woods. Disadvantages 
of this system include concentrated machine activity 
around landings, with associate soil compaction and 
modification of the soil environment under burned piles 
(Massman and others 2003, 2006).
Skidders and forwarders—Once trees are felled, they 
need to be removed to a landing. This can be achieved 
through skidding, forwarding, or cable yarding (fig. 
25). In skidding, logs or whole trees are dragged on the 
ground singly or in bunches by a skidder or crawler trac-
tor. Traditional skidding uses wire rope or chain chokers 
to attach logs to the skidder, but modern grapple skidders 
are equipped with large hydraulic tongs that can pick up 
bunches of trees in one operation without the operator 
leaving the cab, making them much more productive. 
Skid trails should be strategically placed to minimize soil 
disturbance over the site. If disturbance is a concern, logs 
can be removed with a forwarder. Forwarders pick up 
material and carry it to a landing. Forwarders can gener-
ally carry much more material than skidders, thus fewer 
passes across the site are needed. However, forwarders 
are designed to remove processed logs and are normally 
used in situations where unmerchantable material and 
slash is left scattered on-site. In cable yarding, trees are 
removed via a skyline cable system. Because this treat-
ment is expensive, it is generally reserved for removing 
commercial material from steep slopes or where use of 
mechanical equipment is restricted (Fiedler and others 
1999). At the landing, trees are loaded onto trucks or 
trailers using log loaders.
Computer models—The fire and fuels extension of the 
forest vegetation simulator (FVS-FFE) can be used to 
assess the impacts of various stand treatment options on 
potential fire behavior and fire effects (Reinhardt and 
Crookston 2003). This model can also be used to assess 
how different fuels, including trees, snags, and coarse 
woody debris, will change over time. FSVeg can also 
be used to assess how many trees need to be removed 
from a site. Both of these models require reliable stand 
exam data. When this is not available, the nearest neigh-
bor analysis in INFORMS can be used to assess stand 
condition. FMAPlus can then be used to assess potential 
fire behavior of a treated stand. Models like FlamMap 
and FARSITE can be used to assess how fuel treatments 
will impact fire spread on a landscape scale. Models 
commonly used in fuel treatment projects are listed in 
Appendix A.

Other Mechanical and Combination 
(Fire + Mechanical) Techniques
Piling and Burning
As discussed earlier, a common method of removing 
or reducing surface fuel loading is moving it into piles 
that are then individually burned (fig. 26). This mostly 
occurs with logging slash that is generated from thin-
ning operations (Brown and Davis 1973; Fuller 1991). 
Relative to a broadcast burn, the potential for an escaped 
fire is low and the prescription window is wide, as piles 
can be kept dry by covering them with plastic and burn-
ing them when environmental conditions are likely to 
prevent fire spread (fall or winter). The piles should be 
strategically placed such that fire induced damage to trees 
is minimized (Allen and others 1968). Depending on the 
amount of fuel, the average size of fuel, size of the treat-
ment unit, and accessibility of the site, fuels can be piled 
by hand or with a machine. Use of mechanical equipment 
is generally more appropriate for large units with large 
diameter material. Hand crews are also more appropriate 
when accessibility limits use of mechanical equipment, 
either because of lack of roads or steep slopes (Jones and 
Stokes 2004; USDA Forest Service 1973; Windell and 
Bradshaw 2000).
The Flagstaff Fire Department has developed very 
specific guidelines for constructing slash piles to be 
burned in the wildland urban interface (Flagstaff Fire 
Department 2005). According to their best management 
practices guide, piles should be between 5 and 8 feet 
in height and diameter. Smaller branches and tree tops 
should be on the bottom, followed by larger branches in 
the middle of the pile and small diameter material on the 
top. Piles should be in the shape of a cone. In the wild-
land urban interface, hand piles can be burned any time 
of year, but larger machine piles are typically burned 
when there is some snow on the ground.
Given the heat fluxes that can occur when piles are 
burned (Massman and others 2003), care should be tak-
en to locate piles far enough away from residual trees to 
avoid damage to foliage and roots.
Removal
Surface and ladder fuels in the form of slash can also 
be mechanically removed from a site. Merchantable 
trees can be removed from a site before removing tree 
tops and limbs via whole tree-skidding or cable yard-
ing (Scott 1996; Windell and Bradshaw 2000). Tree tops 
and limbs can then be removed from harvested trees at 
a landing rather than on site. This material can then be 
piled and burned at the landing as described earlier, or 
chipped or bundled as biomass for other uses (fig. 27). 
This may be appropriate when burning on site is not 
feasible. If markets are available, this material can also 
be used for bioenergy or composted and used for gar-
den mulch (Graham and others 1998; Hollenstein and 
Figure 26. Excess surface fuels can be piled and 
burned when broadcast burning presents too 
much risk. Photo credit: Wayne Shepperd.

ing county offices. Photo credit: Molly Hunter.

others 2001; Jones and Stokes 2004; LeVan-Green and 
Livingston 2003; Stokes 1992). If material is to be sold 
commercially, it is generally more cost efficient to col-
lect material at a landing (Stokes 1992).
Chipping, Mowing, and Mastication
In mowing or mastication treatments, mechanical 
equipment is used to cut surface and ladder fuels into 
small chunks or chips that are then left on site (Jones and 
Stokes 2004; USDA Forest Service 2003c; Windell and 
Bradshaw 2000). Depending on the type of equipment 
used, slash or standing small trees and shrubs can be 
targeted in mastication/mowing treatments. Generally, 
mechanical equipment is effective for material averag-
ing 10 inches in diameter; however, some equipment 
can be used on material up to 18 inches in diameter 
(Jones and Stokes 2004). The residual material can vary 
in size depending on the equipment used. Slower mov-
ing equipment with rapidly rotating blades will result in 
smaller material (Busse and others 2005). Mastication 
and mowing can be used to prepare sites for broadcast 
burns, as the treatments result in reduced ladder fu-
els (Bradley and others 2003; Busse and others 2005; 
Stephens and Moghaddas 2005b). Crushing understory 
biomass involves driving over material with heavy ma-
chinery to compact understory fuels (Jones and Stokes 
2004; Windell and Bradshaw 2000). This is generally 
useful for treatment of cured slash or very brittle brush 
species, but is not effective in treating tree seedlings and 
saplings. Crushing generally results in reduced fuel bed 
depth and increased compactness.
Tools Used in Mechanical and Combination 
Treatments
Prime movers and cutting heads—Mechanical equip-
ment used for mastication/mowing or piling of material 
involves a prime mover vehicle and a head or cutting/
moving attachment (Jones and Stokes 2004; Ryans and 
Cromier 1994). Prime movers generally include excava-
tors, all surface vehicles, or four-wheel drive tractors. 
The prime mover is the power source and the carrier for 
the mastication head. A head can be attached directly to 
the prime mover or can be attached via an articulating 
arm or boom. Cutting heads can be classified according 
to the orientation of the main power shaft, vertical or 
horizontal, and the type of cutter, fixed or free swinging/
pivotal, containing knife blades, flails, hardened cutter 
teeth, and so forth mounted on rotating drums or disks. 
Some brush-cutting equipment is built for specific car-
riers while other equipment is sold as attachments for 
multi-purpose carriers. It is important to check with 
the manufacturer to ensure a given head will be ap-
propriate for a prime mover. There are advantages and 
disadvantages of using vertical versus horizontal cutting 
heads and fixed versus free-swinging cutters for chang-
ing the fuel structure of small trees, brush, and slash. 
These trade offs should be carefully evaluated before a 
decision is made on which type of equipment is to be 
used. Windell and Bradsaw (2000) and Jones and Stokes 
(2004) provide a summary of common equipment used 
in fuel reduction treatments.
Prime movers can have rubber tires, rubber track, 
steel tracks, or can be stationary. It is important that the 
machine have enough power capability to move effec-
tively at slow speeds while supplying adequate hydraulic 
or mechanical power to the cutting head (McKenzie 
1991; Ryans and Cromier 1994). Tracked machines are 
advantageous because they apply less ground pressure 
than wheeled machines and they can operate on steeper 
slopes (McKenzie 1991; Windell and Bradshaw 2000). 
However, excessive soil compaction does not seem to be 
a problem on many of the soil types in the Front Range 
and Southwest. Tracked machines are also generally 
more maneuverable than wheeled machines, but wheeled 
machines are generally less expensive and more produc-
tive (Windell and Bradsahw 2000).
Vertical shaft cutting heads are generally lighter, and 
thus require less energy than horizontal shaft cutting 
heads (Ryans and Cromier 1994; Windell and Bradshaw 
2000). Use of vertical shaft cutting heads requires a 
large safety zone because debris tends to be ejected in 
all directions. Thus, vertical shaft cutting heads may 
not be appropriate for use near structures (McKenzie 
1991; Windell and Bradshaw 2000). Vertical shaft cut-
ting heads can be attached to an articulating arm on an 
excavator that allows the machine to process material 
standing higher off the ground than horizontal-shaft ma-
chines. Standing trees can be ground to stumps with little 
damage to desirable trees and vegetation. The articulat-
ing arm also minimizes travel across the site (Windell 
and Bradshaw 2000). Mulching can be improved on ver-
tical shaft cutters by reducing the size of rock guards on 
the shaft or increasing the rotating speed (fig. 28).
Horizontal shaft cutting heads provide more mulch-
ing action than vertical shaft cutting heads but are also 
more sensitive to wear and if bladed, will require more 
frequent sharpening than heads with hardened teeth. 
Horizontal shaft cutting heads are generally attached 
to a tracked machine or articulated tractor. These can 
be used to walk over brush, small trees, and slash. In 
general, front-mounted machine attachments provide 
better operator visibility than rear-mounted attachments 
(McKenzie 1991; Ryans and Cromier 1994) (fig. 29).

USDA Forest Service RMRS-GTR-198.  2007
Fixed cutters are typically circular saws and discs with 
fixed teeth (Ryans and Cromier 1994). Free swinging 
cutters consist of pivoted knives mounted on a central 
disc or bar. Fixed cutters generally have less mulch-
ing capability, but improved mulching often comes at a 
cost of higher energy requirements and possibly lower 
productivity (McKenzie 1991). Fixed cutters often re-
quire frequent sharpening as the blades easily dull with 
frequent contact with rocks and soil. Damage to knives 
is less likely with free swinging cutters. Fixed cutters 
do not throw material as far as free swinging cutters 
(McKenzie 1991).
Pruning and piling equipment—Pruning, piling of 
slash, and lop and scattering of slash can also be accom-
plished effectively with hand crews (Jones and Stokes 
2004; USDA Forest Service 1973). Hand pruning saws 
and loppers can be used to prune the lower branches of 
trees. Managers have recommended that no more than 50 
percent of the live crown should be removed. Chainsaws 
can be used to cut material (USDA Forest Service 1973; 
Jones and Stokes 2004). Biomass can then be placed into 
piles or scattered across the site by hand. If material is 
to be burned, it is important to place piles and scattered 
material away from residual trees to avoid fuel buildup 
under crowns or near the base of tree boles. When a high 
quantity of large diameter material is on site, piling by 
hand can be difficult. In such cases, piling can be better 
accomplished with a tractor, loader, or dozer with rake 
or grapple attachments. Grapples attached to excavators 
can also be used if tree spacing limits movement of larg-
er equipment. Considerable amounts of dirt can be piled 
with the debris with certain types of equipment, mak-
ing the piles more difficult to burn (Cammack 1978). 
Less dirt tends to accumu-
late in piles when material is 
picked up with rakes rather 
than dragged across the 
ground.
Woody biomass and slash 
can also be fed into chippers. 
Material can be processed at 
a landing where the chips 
can be loaded into trucks 
or trailers. This is appropri-
ate if chips are to be sold as 
garden mulch or for a bioen-
ergy product. Alternatively, 
chips can be processed on 
site and distributed over the 
area. Whole tree chippers or 
hand fed chippers, made by 
a variety of manufacturers,

are generally used at landings, although some special-
ized equipment can be used in the woods.
Livestock Grazing and Chemical 
Treatment Techniques
Livestock grazing and chemical treatments in associ-
ation with fuels reduction treatments in ponderosa pine 
forests have been used to a very limited extent in the 
Southwest, Front Range, and Black Hills. Thus, an exten-
sive list of treatment options is not available. However, 
there has been some experimentation with these treat-
ments to control excessive sprouting of Gambel oak, 
which can develop into a ladder fuel if left unchecked, 
particularly in the southern Rocky Mountains.
Livestock Grazing
Livestock grazing can be an important manage-
ment tool for manipulating the amount and extent of 
understory woody (shrubs and small trees) and her-
baceous vegetation (Archer and Smeins 1991). Low 
to moderate levels of grazing can reduce tree and 
shrub establishment on a site by promoting growth 
in grasses, which increases their ability to preempt 
resources from trees and shrubs while increasing 
biomass and continuity of fine fuels and hence, fire 
frequency (Borman 2005; Madany and West 1983; 
Rummell 1951). In contrast, higher levels of grazing 
reduce the amount of fine fuels, which decreases fire 
frequency and intensity (Bachelet and others 2000), 
but can lead to increased establishment of trees and 
shrubs (Archer and Smeins 1991).
Two studies have documented successful use of 
goats to control dominance of Gambel oak in dense 
shrub thickets in the Southwest (Davis and others 1975; 
Riggs and Urness 1989). Goats are generally better to 
use than cattle or sheep because they will preferential-
ly browse on Gambel oak. Use of 1,300 to 1,800 goat 
days per hectare (526 to 729 per acre) in the summer 
for two seasons was successful in defoliating oak (Riggs 
and Urness 1989). Since Gambel oak has low carbohy-
drate reserves in June and August, this may be the best 
time to graze goats (Davis and others 1975). Generally, 
more than one grazing season is needed to successfully 
control oak sprouts (Davis and others 1975; Riggs and 
Urness 1989). Alternatively, goats can be used follow-
ing another treatment such as mechanical removal, 
herbicides, or prescribed fire (Davis and others 1975). 
This is particularly useful when much of the oak foliage 
is tall and not within reach of goats. More studies on 
use of goats to control Gambel oak are needed to better 
evaluate the effectiveness of this treatment in reducing 
wildfire risk. Obviously, the technique is not appropriate 
for use on large areas, but may have applicability in situ-
ations where other options are not available.
Herbicides
Several herbicides have been tested on Gambel oak to 
control dominance in dense shrub thickets in southwest-
ern Colorado, including Silvex (2,4,5-T and 2,4,5-TP), 
Picloram, and glyphosate and glyphosate:triclopyr-
picloram combinations (Lauver and others 1989). Foliar 
application of Tordon has also been effective (Marquiss 
1973). Foliar applications are effective while soil treat-
ments are generally not effective (Van Epps 1974). 
However, treatment results tend to be highly variable 
year to year (Harper and others 1985). Applications in 
July may be effective as this is when plants begin stor-
age of carbohydrates and herbicides may be transported 
more easily through the plants (Kufeld 1983). More 
studies on use of herbicides to control Gambel oak are 
needed to better evaluate the effectiveness of this treat-
ment in reducing wildfire risk. One of us (Shepperd) is 
aware of another test of the herbicide Arsenal© that ef-
fectively killed Gambel Oak in the San Juan NF in the 
1980s.
Control of invasive weeds is a more common use 
of herbicides associated with fuels treatments in Black 
Hills, Front Range, and Southwest ponderosa pine 
forests. Managers typically spot-spray herbicide on 
individual plants or populations of invasive plants asso-
ciated with areas disturbed by skid trails, landings, and 
pile burn sites. Application is usually accomplished by 
backpack, ATV, or truck mounted spraying equipment 
and is sometimes done cooperatively by trained person-
nel from other agencies or resources in collaboration 
with the fuels treatment program.

T
he success in meeting fuel treatment objectives as 
well as broader resource management objectives in 
each fuel treatment depends on how well a project treat-
ment prescription is planned and implemented. While 
reduced wildfire risk is generally the primary objective, 
well planned projects tend to consider this objective 
in a broad framework that includes a suite of resource 
management objectives in a landscape context. Well im-
plemented projects are successful in meeting objectives 
despite several limitations that are commonly encoun-
tered. In this section, we present information that should 
be considered in the planning and implementation of any 
fuel treatment project to ensure treatment and resource 
management objectives are met. This includes discus-
sion of factors that influence treatment effectiveness in 
reducing severe wildfire risk and the resources needed 
to complete these treatments. We also discuss common 
limitations to effectively achieving resource and fuel 
treatment objectives and present examples of how man-
agers have successfully overcome these limitations.
Planning
Before implementation of any fuel treatment can be-
gin, most agencies require a thorough analysis of the 
potential effects of various treatments. Laws such as 
the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered 
Species Act, and Clean Air Act often dictate these analy-
ses. While the requirements for planning projects vary 
by agency, at least on federal lands, managers generally 
need to consult various resource management special-
ists (for example, wildlife biologists, archeologists, and 
hydrologists) and solicit public comments for each pro-
posed treatment. Thorough surveys of valued resources 
in proposed treatment areas may be needed to fully un-
derstand the potential impacts of treatments on these 
resources. These actions can help determine what type of 
treatment would be most appropriate for any given situ-
ation and how it should be scheduled and implemented. 
It can also help identify critical factors to monitor post-
treatment. In many cases, it can take a year or more to 
complete this process.
Prescribed Fire
Effectiveness
As described earlier, prescribed fire is generally 
used to reduce loading of surface, ladder, and canopy 
fuels with the ultimate goal of reducing the potential 
for spread of catastrophic wildfire. Prescribed fires are 
generally effective in reducing loading of surface fuels, 
and have been shown to reduce the size, severity, and 
resultant ecological effects of wildfires (Choromasnska 
and DeLua 2001; Kallander 1969; Pollet and Omi 2002; 
Omi and others 2005; Wagle and Eakle 1979). However, 
not all prescribed fires are equally effective in reducing 
wildfire hazard. This may be because prescribed fire does 
not always result in sufficient fuel reduction. The size of 
a prescribed fire may also be a factor. While small pre-
scribed fires (less than 100 acres) are generally easier to 
implement and carry less risk of escape, large prescribed 
fires (greater than 800 acres) are more likely to be effec-
tive in reducing the potential for severe wildfire spread 
(Finney and others 2005; Martinson and others 2003). 
Use of prescribed fires also requires sustained manage-
ment as effectiveness decreases with time since fire 
(Finney and others 2005). Prescribed fires were found to 
be effective in reducing subsequent wildfire severity for 
up to 4 years in Arizona and New Mexico (Ffolliott and 
Guertin 1988; Finney and others 2005; Omi and others 
2005) and 6 years in Colorado (Omi and others 2005). 
Prescribed fires are less likely to be effective in suffi-
ciently reducing fuel loads if they are conducted when 
fuels are too wet (Fernandes and Betelho 2003).
Prescribed fires have also been used effectively to re-
duce tree density. Because prescribed fire is relatively 
ineffective in reducing canopy bulk density (Agee and 
Skinner 2005; Fule and others 2002a; Sackett and others 
1996), multiple high to moderate intensity fires may be 
needed to sufficiently reduce tree density before low in-
tensity fires can be used exclusively to maintain desired 
conditions (USDA Forest Service 2003c). Similarly, 
multiple prescribed fires or fires of high intensity may be 
needed to reduce fuel loads to levels that would signifi-
cantly impact wildfire behavior (Fule and others 2002a; 
Section V:
Fuel Treatment Requirements

50	
USDA Forest Service RMRS-GTR-198.  2007
Fule and others 2004; Harrington and Sackett 1990; 
Windell and Bradshaw 2000).
If reduction of shrub fuels is the objective, prescribed 
burns should be conducted with greater frequency to 
keep up with shrub sprouting (Harrington and Sackett 
1990). For Gambel oak, control burns should be con-
ducted every other year in the summer (Harrington 
1985). Stimulation of new shrub sprouts may be desir-
able for wildlife forage. To stimulate shrub sprouting, 
prescribed burns generally need to be conducted in the 
dormant season when carbohydrate reserves that are 
stored in the roots should facilitate sprouting (Bock and 
Bock 1984; Harrington 1985; Sieg and Wright 1996; 
Young and Baily 1975).
Resources Needed
The personnel required to implement a prescribed 
fire is highly variable and dependent on the complexity 
of the prescribed fire, level of experience of available 
personnel, and perception of risk, among other things. 
For example, more people may be needed for prescribed 
fires that are closer to communities, in areas where fuel 
loading is particularly high, or in situations where more 
precise control of the burning process is needed to miti-
gate other resource needs. Internal agency policies are 
also a factor. The personnel needed to complete pre-
scribed fires seems to be increasing, as some agencies 
now require contingency resources to be on site of the 
prescribed fire. Thus, enough resources need to be on 
hand to hold a fire should it go out of prescription. This 
will almost always include at least one engine, but the 
number often depends on the maximum area that will 
be allowed to burn. These requirements will increase the 
cost of conducting a prescribed fire, but will decrease 
the probability of fire having detrimental impacts to val-
ues at risk.
Cost of prescribed burning can be highly variable. 
Factors such as size of burn, type of equipment used, 
accessibility, and type firing pattern use all influence the 
cost of a prescribed fire. On the Gila National Forest, 
prescribed fire can cost anywhere from $25 to $200 per 
acre (Lolley and others 2006). Costs have been has high 
as $500 per acre on the Santa Fe National Forest and 
average $300 per acre on the Black Hills National Forest 
(table 5). A complete analysis of costs for various treat-
ments in the Front Range was also recently compiled 
and is a valuable reference (Front Range Fuel Treatment 
Partnership Rountable 2006).
For many reasons, wildland fire use events tend to be 
much less expensive on a per acre basis than manage-
ment ignited prescribed fires (Lolley and others 2006). 
Since wildland fire use fires tend to burn over multiple 
days or weeks, more acres are generally burned in a 
given event relative to a management ignited prescribed 
fire. As the number of acres burned increases in an event,

the cost per acre generally decreases as the same level of 
resources are used in each case (Wood 1988). Wildland 
fire use fires also do not generally require construction 
of fuel breaks, which can be costly.
Wildland fire use events require an upfront planning 
process in the fire management plan, but not a sepa-
rate and lengthy environmental analysis for each event 
(USDA and USDI 2005). This would be impossible 
given that one cannot predict when and where wildland 
fire use opportunities will present themselves. This more 
streamlined planning process, relative to management 
ignited prescribed fires, also reduces the overall cost of 
wildland fire use events.
Thinning
Effectiveness
Thinning treatments have been tested in wildfire sce-
narios in ponderosa pine forests throughout the west 
and have been shown to be effective in mitigating fire 
severity (Cram and others 2006; Martinson and Omi 
2003; Martinson and others 2003; Pollet and Omi 2002). 
However, different thinning treatments are not equally 
effective in reducing the potential for wildfire spread 
and intensity. For example, in treatments where only a 
few small trees are removed, the potential for crown fire 
spread may not be significantly reduced (Fule and others 
2006). Treatments that focus on removal of smaller trees 
will generally be more effective than treatments that focus 
on overstory removal (Arno and Fiedler 2005; Graham 
and others 1999; Martinson and Omi 2003; Scott 1998), 
although specific effects are strongly dependent upon 
the number and distribution of tree sizes present before 
treatment (Shepperd and others 2005). However, some 
large trees may need to be removed to effectively reduce 
the potential for crown fire spread (Scott 1998; Arno and 
Fiedler 2005). Many studies (for example, Callaway and 
Davis 1993; Cram and others 2006; Odion and others 
2004) have found that patterns of fire effects (severity) 
and post-fire vegetation recovery may be predisposed by 
topographical position and pre-fire vegetation structure. 
Stand density index, the number of large trees, and slope 
were the variables most closely associated with low and 
moderate burn severity under the severe weather con-
ditions during a large, contemporary wildfire in Black 
Hills ponderosa pine forests (Lentile and others 2006). 
Although many stands were thinned, sapling and small 
tree density remained high and stands with low numbers 
of large trees on gentle slopes were most likely to burn at 
low or moderate burn severity. High density stands with 
either many large or small trees, in other words, with 
high canopy bulk density or fuel ladders, were more 
likely to burn severely (Lentile and others 2006).
Thinning operations can often dramatically increase 
surface fuel loading in the form of tree tops and limbs 
or slash and are generally not effective in reducing the 
potential for severe fire spread if the resultant slash is 
not subsequently treated (Graham and others 1999; 
Martinson and others 2003; Peterson and others 2005). 
If residual slash burns under hot and dry conditions, it 
can result in very extreme fire behavior (Martinson and 
others 2003). It is therefore necessary to remove or alter 
the structure of these surface fuels using prescribed fire 
or mechanical treatments in conjunction with thinning.
Resources Needed
The resources needed to complete a thinning operation 
depend on the treatment area size, the size and amount 
of treated material, and the accessibility and topogra-
phy of the site. For example, on smaller treatment areas, 
hand crews using chainsaws or small, maneuverable 
equipment of low horsepower are generally sufficient. 
On larger treatment areas, larger mechanical equipment 
may be needed as they have higher production rates. 
The size of the material being removed can also dictate 
what type of equipment is needed (see previous Tools 
section). Mechanical equipment may be needed when 
there is a great deal of material that needs to be removed, 
again because of higher production rates. Use of me-
chanical equipment becomes problematic in areas that 
are inaccessible or have complex terrain. In such cases, 
hand crews may be needed. Alternatively, mechanical 
equipment specially made for complex terrain may be 
used (see previous Tools section).
Costs for thinning operations can be highly vari-
able. Thinning operations in ponderosa pine forests on 
the Gila National Forest cost between $200 and $500 
per acre (Lolley and others 2006). Treatments have cost 
up to $1,000 per acre on the Santa Fe National Forest 
and up to $1,200 per acre for projects managed by the 
Colorado State Forest. Treatments in the Black Hills 
National Forest on average cost around $350 per acre 
(table 5).
Other Mechanical and Combination 
Treatments
Effectiveness
One of the more common ways to dispose of excess 
surface fuel is to move the material into piles constructed 
by hand or machine. These piles are then burned under 

52	
USDA Forest Service RMRS-GTR-198.  2007
relatively benign conditions. If trees are to be used com-
mercially, the unusable portions of the tree (for example, 
tops, limbs) can be cut after the tree has been removed 
from the site, a process called whole tree removal. Both 
methods are effective in reducing the loading of slash.
In other methods, larger surface and ladder fuels are 
processed with chippers or masticators. The resultant 
material is then spread out over the site. This process is 
relatively new and the effectiveness of these methods in 
reducing fire risk has not been adequately tested. Such 
treatments have been shown to reduce the height of lad-
der fuels and thus the potential for initiation of torching 
and crowning fire behavior (Jerman and others 2004). 
However, others have found that chipped and masticated 
fuels in particular can burn completely with relatively 
high intensity during prescribed fires and this has been 
shown to have adverse effects on soil properties and tree 
mortality (Bradley and others 2003; Busse and others 
2005; Stephens and Moghaddas 2005b). Concentrations 
of chips on the ground have also been found to dra-
matically alter the soil environment, even if they are not 
burned (Massman and others 2006) (fig. 30).
Fuels that are scattered or crushed have not been shown 
to burn with the same effect, perhaps because these fu-
els generally do not burn completely during a prescribed 
fire (Jerman and others 2004). Prescott National Forest 
personnel have found that burning masticated fuels with 
very high fuel moisture contents and high relative humid-
ity (35 percent) results in rather complete consumption 
of surface fuels without detrimental impacts on soils. 
These treatments were conducted in chaparral fuels, 
and thus it is unclear if similar fuel consumption would 
be achieved in less volatile fuels. However, Shepperd 
(2004) reported that burning heavy surface fuels on sat-
urated soils had no apparent detrimental effect on aspen 
roots at a low elevation mixed conifer site in southern 
Colorado that contained ponderosa pine. More research 
is needed to fully understand the impacts of mastication 
treatments on the potential for severe wildfire spread 
and other resources or ecological processes.
Resources Needed
Surface fuels can be treated using a variety of tools, 
from fire to mechanical treatments. Both hand crews and 
mechanical equipment can be used to cut ladder fuels 
such as large shrubs and small trees. Both can also be 
used to place material into piles that can later be burned. 
The necessity of using hand crews versus mechanical 
equipment will depend on the size of the treatment area 
and the type and amount of material being removed. 
In addition, there is a wide range of useful equipment 
that varies in power capacity and other features (see 
previous Tools section). More powerful mechanical 
equipment may be needed when a lot of material over 
a large area needs to be treated. Specialized equipment 
may be needed on steeper terrain. The type of equip-
ment used will also depend on the desired condition of 
fuels after treatment. For example, a chipper would be 
preferred if smaller material, a neater appearance, and 
low-intensity burning conditions were wanted while a 
hydro-axe would suffice if larger material could be left 
on-site. Costs of combined treatments may vary widely 
as well. Mastication treatments can range from $100 to 
$1,000 per acre and pile burning can range from $100 to 
$750 per acre (USDA Forest Service 2003c) (table 5). 
Chipping is generally more expensive than mastication 
or pile burning. Programs such as My Fuel Treatment 
Planner (MyFTP) can be used to assess and compare the 
costs of various treatments (Fight and Barbour 2005).
Livestock Grazing and Chemical 
Treatments
Effectiveness
The use of livestock grazing and chemical treatments 
for fuels reduction has been limited in ponderosa pine 
systems, thus it is difficult to fully evaluate the effective-
ness of these treatments along with the resource needs and 
limitations. There seems to be some potential to reduce 
fuel loading in dense thickets of Gambel oak. Gambel 
oak grows in the understory of ponderosa pine forests 
in Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado. This species is 
very important as browse and habitat for a variety of 
wildlife species (Reynolds and others 1996). However, 
Figure 30. Compact layers of wood chips may have adverse ef-
fects on the soil environment. Wood chip layers (2 to 3 inch-
es in depth) did not appear to inhibit seedling establishment 
of ponderosa pine in Boulder County. Photo credit: Molly 
Hunter.

after decades of fire exclusion, stands of Gambel oak can 
become impenetrable to wildlife, produce poor browse 
quality, prevent regeneration of ponderosa pine trees, and 
develop into potentially threatening ladder fuels (Harper 
and others 1985). Thus, in some regions, managers have 
attempted to control the density and height of Gambel 
oak stands using herds of goats and herbicides to control 
dense thickets of Gambel oak, but such treatments have 
been limited and have not been sufficiently evaluated to 
determine their effectiveness in reducing the potential 
for severe fire spread and their effects on other resources 
or processes.
Limitations and Examples of 
Overcoming Them
Access and Topography
Mechanical equipment is more restricted by access 
and terrain than are hand crews. Use of mechanical 
equipment is generally not feasible on slopes greater than 
35 percent (Fight and others 1999). Some machines can 
be used on steeper slopes, but such machines generally 
require greater capital investment that can only be recu-
perated if sustained commercial products are obtained 
from treatments (Fight and others 1999; Fight and oth-
ers 2003). Mechanical treatments are also restricted by 
access and cannot be used on isolated sites surrounded 
by other ownerships unless owners agree to let equip-
ment cross their land. Costs of treatments increase as 
distance to roads increases, yet constructing new roads 
to facilitate mechanical fuel treatments may have detri-
mental effects on other ecological resources (DellaSalla 
and Frost 2001; Hartsough and others 1998; Trombulak 
and Frissell 2000) and will require extensive study in 
some jurisdictions.
Use of prescribed fire is less restricted by access and 
topography and thus may be more feasible than use of 
mechanical treatments in certain situations. However, it 
can be more difficult to construct fuel breaks in inac-
cessible terrain, and steep and rugged topography can 
make conditions unsafe for firefighters. Despite the 
need, implementation of fuel treatments is not an option 
in certain areas because of access and topography.
Allowing wildfires to burn and reduce fuel loads may 
be a viable option in such cases. These limitations ne-
cessitate development of strategies to determine where 
to implement fuel treatments across a landscape while 
maximizing the benefits gained from such treatments. An 
example of this process is taking place in management 
units such as the Prescott and Coconino National Forests 
in northern Arizona. Intensive mechanical treatments, 
often in combination with prescribed fire, are being 
focused around values at risk, including power lines, 
municipal water sources, and communities. Access and 
topography are generally not restrictive factors around 
such infrastructure in these areas. Once these values are 
sufficiently protected from the risk of severe wildfire, 
there should be greater opportunities to use natural or 
management ignited fire to treat fuels in more remote 
areas. While use of fire alone without mechanical treat-
ments carries some risk of extreme fire behavior, such 
events should be less threatening to communities or 
other values at risk if a buffer of intensively treated for-
est surrounds them. This practice has also been endorsed 
by others (Aplet and Wilmer 2003; DellaSalla and Frost 
2001).
Resource Limitations
Most management agencies have limited resources 
available for fuel treatment activities and this often re-
stricts the number of acres that can be treated and can 
dictate the type of treatment used. Ideally, managers 
would have enough resources to treat all the acres that 
are in need of fuel reduction and to use the tools that are 
most appropriate for meeting all resource management 
objectives. In reality, managers need to derive strategies 
for maximizing benefits for natural resources given the 
capital they have because available funding will always 
be an issue.
One strategy for maximizing benefit of resources is to 
leverage funds for fuels treatments with funds allocated 
for other resources, such as wildlife habitat or timber 
management, thereby increasing the number of acres 
that are treated. For example, fuel managers on the Black 
Hills National Forest and in Custer State Park, both in 
South Dakota, coordinate efforts with their timber man-
agement staffs. This allows managers to share resources 
while meeting multiple objectives (for example, timber 
targets and fuels reduction). Managers are also able to 
partially offset the cost of treatments by producing some 
commercially viable material.
The ability to use merchantable material from 
fuel reduction treatments is often limited by avail-
ability of processing plants and consistent long-term 
markets (Hollenstein and others 2001; Le Van-Green 
and Livingston 2003; USDA Forest Service 2003c). 
The proportion of material removed that is sawlog-sized 
versus product other than logs (POL) often determines 
whether or not there is profit from restoration or fuel 
reduction treatments. In southwestern Colorado, for 
example, treatments have been profitable when a maxi-
mum of 60 percent of the material removed from a site is

not a viable option because of poor markets or absence 
of viable material, there may be unique opportunities 
to offset costs. For example, in Boulder County, CO, 
small diameter material harvested from county lands is 
processed as chips that are then used to heat some coun-
ty-owned buildings.
While prescribed fires are generally less expensive 
than mechanical treatments on a per acre basis, the cost 
of such treatments can still be substantial. There are 
many things that can be done to minimize burning costs. 
For example, the Colorado State Forest Service mini-
mizes costs by using local volunteer fire departments 
for their prescribed fires. This helps the volunteer fire 
departments by allowing their personnel to gain experi-
ence and advance in their training. Costs of prescribed 
fires can be highly variable depending on numerous fac-
tors. For example, larger prescribed fires generally cost 
less on a per acre basis (Cleaves and others 2000; Wood 
1988). Smaller fires can be more costly than large fires, 
even though the required crew sizes may be smaller, 
because the same level of holding equipment (for exam-
ple, engines, dozers) is needed as on larger fires (Wood 
1988).
Construction of fireline also affects prescribed fire 
costs. The proportion of fireline created per area burned 
is higher for smaller fires (Wood 1988) and can signifi-
cantly effect prescribed fire cost. The cost of burning 
can be reduced substantially if fireline construction is 
minimized by using natural or existing fuel breaks. This 
can include roads, trails, rivers, and snow. Managers of 
the Coconino National Forest organize prescribed fire 
units in stacked blocks so that prescribed fires conducted 
early in the season can be used as fire breaks for subse-
quent prescribed fires later in the season.
Distance traveled to a treatment site can substantially 
increase the cost of prescribed fire treatments as well. If 
units are far away, care should be taken to ensure that 
the prescribed fire can be completed in the fewest num-
ber of days possible to minimize travel time and costs. 
This can be achieved by increasing the size of crews, 
using aerial ignition, or burning for longer periods of 
time each day.
High Fuel Loading
Use of prescribed fire is often restricted in areas where 
fuel loading is unusually high. In such cases, if prescribed 
fire is initiated under relatively benign conditions (for 
example, high relative humidity, low temperature), then 
resulting fire behavior often does not achieve the desired 
effect in terms of reduction in tree density or loading of 
surface fuels. Conversely, if prescribed fires are initiated 
under drier and warmer conditions, there is a greater risk 
of extreme fire behavior. Such intense prescribed burns 
may have undesirable effects on watershed and ecologi-
cal processes and can increase threats to firefighter and 
community safety (DellaSalla and Frost 2001; Fule and 
others 2002b; USDA Forest Service 2003c).
If high fuel loadings are present in areas adjacent 
to communities, prescribed fire may be implemented 
only after significant amounts of fuel are removed or 
rearranged mechanically (Allen and others 2002). For 
example, some managers on the Coconino National 
Forest told us they feel more comfortable using pre-
scribed fire in or near the wildland urban interface when 
canopy cover is less than 50 percent and fuel bed depth 
is less than 1-foot conditions that can only be met by ap-
plying mechanical treatments prior to burning. The city 
of Flagstaff also conducts broadcast burns in and around 
the city after areas have been treated mechanically and 
heavy fuels have been burned in piles (Farnsworth and 
Summerfelt 2001) (fig. 31).
Use of prescribed natural fire may be appropriate in 
more remote areas with high fuel loading. For example, 
in the Gila National Forest, managers have been very 
successful in using naturally ignited fires to treat areas 
with excessively high fuel loads. This practice has been 
going on in this area since the 1970s. Several areas have 
burned in two or three fire events since the program be-
gan. Since the fires initiate with natural lightning strikes, 
they typically start during the summer monsoon season 
when relative humidity and fuel moisture is high, which 
may prevent very extreme fire behavior. Managers have 
noticed that while the initial fire is generally not very 
effective in reducing fuel loads (particularly tree den-
sity) areas that have seen multiple fires have significant 
reductions in fuel loads.
Prescribed fire has also been used in stands with high 
fuel loads in areas that are not as remote. Examples of 
this can be seen in the Black Hills National Forest, Santa 
Fe National Forest, and Bandelier National Monument 
(fig. 32). Using fire to reduce fuel loads often means ac-
cepting the possibility of some extreme fire behavior, 
such as tree torching and crowning, within the treated 
area. This process creates heterogeneity on the landscape 
that restores some of the historical diversity of pondero-
sa pine forests and is beneficial for wildlife habitat and 
other resource uses. Such pockets of intense prescribed 
fire can be created with individual ignitions or as part of 
a larger prescribed fire.
Prescription Windows
Prior to conducting a prescribed fire, managers need to 
define a set of objectives (for example, percent tree mor-
tality or percent black) and fire behavior characteristics 

USDA Forest Service RMRS-GTR-198.  2007	
55
(for example, flame length, rate of spread) that will allow 
fuel treatment goals to be met without severe risk of es-
cape fire or extreme fire behavior. Managers then define 
a prescription window, or a range of values for relative 
humidity, temperature, wind, and slope that will result in 
the desired fire behavior. Managers should bear in mind 
that it can be very difficult to complete prescribed fires 
if a prescription window is very narrow, or if there are 
few days during a burning season when a prescription 
window can be met. This is particularly problematic in 
areas with high fuel loading. Narrow prescription win-
dows can ultimately restrict the number of acres that can 
be treated in a given year. This is especially true if all 
planned projects have the same narrow prescription win-
dow. If such is the case, managers need to realistically 
assess the likelihood of completing planned projects and 
investigate other fuels treatment alternatives.
Managers have learned to overcome such obstacles 
by designing their prescription windows to be as wide as 
possible. The general approach of managers on the San 
Juan National Forest, for example, is to start with de-
sired fire behavior (from BehavePlus output) and work 
backward to find a wide range of weather parameters 
that will produce the desired fire behavior. Another ap-
proach is to burn as many acres as possible when you 
are in prescription. For example, managers in northern

Department has been

ing prescribed fire in the

Arizona sometimes will burn piles concurrent with a 
broadcast burn if prescription windows are very narrow, 
or extend the burn period if prescription window con-
ditions persist. Widening the prescription window can 
also be achieved by expanding the burning season into 
summer and winter and planning to expanding the hours 
in a day when burning is typically done. For example, 
managers with the Coconino National Forest often 
burn at night to be within their prescription. San Juan 
National Forest personnel have considered broadcast 
burning on south-facing slopes when they are snow-free 
in dry winters. Innovative thinking can result in strate-
gies like these to help widen the prescription window. 
It is important to note however that burning in a season 
not consistent with the historical fire regime may result 
in very different fire effects. For example, certain spe-
cies may be more susceptible to fire damage during the 
growing season (Harrington 1987).
Overcoming the limitations of narrow prescription 
windows requires planning. Treatments can be planned 
with flexibility so an entire treatment area does not need 
to be shut down when only a portion of it is out of pre-
scription. In the past, managers on the Santa Fe National 
Forest have often broken up treatments into units based 
on topography. Breaking up a treatment area in this fash-
ion decreases the likelihood that a burn will be cancelled 
because average conditions do not fit a prescription win-
dow. For example, one portion of the unit may be out 
of prescription (south aspect), yet another portion may 
be in prescription (north aspect). This approach may 
require more intensive collection of fuel moisture and 
weather data than normal, but may result in accomplish-
ments that otherwise could not be achieved.
Another very innovative approach is currently in 
the planning process on the Coronado National Forest. 
Managers there are attempting to plan for several proj-
ects across a broad scale. Having several projects ready 
to be implemented would allow some flexibility in treat-
ing areas in a given year. If, for example, if they are 
not able to conduct a planned prescribed fire because 
prescription windows are not met, they can instead use 
available resources to implement a planned thinning 
project. Having several implementation-ready projects 
on hand allows for this flexibility. In order to accomplish 
this, they have had to expand the scope of fuel treatment 
planning from the ranger district level to the forest level 
and beyond.
Public and Agency Resistance
Both the general public and agency personnel can be 
resistant to fuel treatments for a variety of reasons. In 
some cases, prescribed fires and mechanical treatments 
have had detrimental impacts on valued resources. For 
example, the 2000 Cerro Grande fire in northern New 
Mexico was a prescribed fire that went out of prescrip-
tion and resulted in the evacuation of the city of Los 
Alamos and the destruction of over 200 structures. Fires 
in the Southwest (including wildland fire use fires) have 
also necessitated the emergency removal of threatened 
fish species in effected streams. Inadvertent loss of 
property in prescribed fires has resulted in the threat of 
criminal prosecution of personnel conducting the burn. 
Even though such events are rare, their high profile and 
the attention given by the media give the public and re-
source managers within agencies the impression that the 
risk of detrimental effects of such treatments outweigh 
the benefits. Since comments from the public and other 
resource managers are solicited in any fuel treatment 
project, this resistance can create substantial barriers to 
implementating fuel treatments.
Managers are more successful in gaining acceptance 
for fuel treatments when they actively engage the pub-
lic and agency officials during the entire fuel treatment 
or restoration process, from planning to implementa-
tion. While collaborative projects often require a lot 
of up-front investment in time, these efforts generally 
pay off by reducing overall resistance to prescribed fire 
and other fuel treatments. Ultimately, engaging mul-
tiple stakeholders forces managers to consider multiple 
resource management objectives and thus operate in a 
framework that considers sustainability of the whole 
forest system.
There are many examples of planning processes 
that have involved multiple collaborators. On the Gila 
National Forest, a landscape pre-planning process was 
designed to provide recommendations to the forest ser-
vice on where to place fuel treatments. This involved 
a collaborative effort that included managers with the 
Forest Service, non-profit groups, local governments, 
environmental advocacy groups, and forest industry 
companies that use small diameter material. Another 
collaborative effort on the Coronado National Forest 
included members from agencies with adjoining land 
units, including the National Park Service, Department 
of Defense, Nature Conservancy, and Audubon Society. 
Our interviews with practitioners have shown repeatedly 
that outside resistance to proposed projects is reduced 
when multiple stakeholders have played a key role in 
planning fuel treatment activities and feel their concerns 
have been addressed.
Another important aspect of acceptance of fuel 
treatments is the level of trust that is given to those 
implementing and planning treatments. Generally, trust 
in agency officials is not given easily and often only 

USDA Forest Service RMRS-GTR-198.  2007	
57
develops over time and after relationships based on 
mutual respect have been established with the public 
and other resource managers. Once trust is established, 
it is imperative to maintain it by following through 
with intended treatments, monitoring their success or 
failings, and openly sharing the results. Once trust is 
lost, it is extremely difficult to regain again. Managers 
on the San Juan National Forest invest a great deal of 
time and energy in actions that establish and maintain 
trust with the public. They take time to ensure that the 
public and other interested parties understand exactly 
what they plan to do and why they plan to do it. For 
example, prior to implementing a restoration project, 
personnel organize field trips to the proposed treatment 
area. They also bring historical photos to show what 
the area might have looked like prior to Euro-American 
settlement and discuss the consequences of the pro-
posed change. They provide photos of treatment areas 
1, 2, and 3 years after treatment so that people have a 
sense of what the area will look like after treatment. 
This helps avoid the public perception that agency of-
ficials can not be trusted, a perception that can develop 
when there are misconceptions about what fuel treat-
ments are supposed to accomplish.
Smoke
Depending on the region, smoke from a prescribed 
fire can be subject to regulation by various state and 
federal laws. Smoke production is a serious matter be-
cause it can affect public health, visibility for road and 
air traffic, and contribute to “bad air” days in metropoli-
tan areas subject to EPA regulations. The public can also 
have low tolerance for smoke in their communities even 
when smoke production is within acceptable limits. Both 
of these factors can seriously limit the number of areas 
that can be burned in a season. In addition, managers 
often have to consider factors that affect smoke dispersal 
to ensure that sensitive municipalities are not adversely 
impacted by smoke.
As with other limiting factors, innovative thinking is 
key to dealing with smoke production. Recognizing this 
limitation, managers from different agencies in northern 
Arizona coordinate their burns to ensure that certain ar-
eas do not receive excessive smoke impacts in any given 
period of time. Conversely, if conditions are favorable 
for smoke dispersal, they will coordinate to accomplish 
as much burning as possible. To comply with air quality 
standards imposed by state and federal laws, in north-
ern Arizona, managers coordinate prescribed fire plans 
on a daily basis to ensure that certain areas do not re-
ceive excessive smoke impacts in any given period of 
time. This can be challenging, especially when adjacent 
management units tend to have the same narrow pre-
scription windows in northern Arizona. Managers have 
also been able to take advantage of local weather phe-
nomenon to maximize smoke dispersal. For example, 
the Coconino National Forest has experimented with, 
and been successful in, implementing prescribed fires 
ahead of approaching cold fronts, which disperse smoke 
away from sensitive areas during windy periods before 
the front passes. To contain the fires, they also take ad-
vantage of colder, wetter, and calmer conditions after the 
front. This type of detailed knowledge and understand-
ing of local weather processes and fire behavior patterns 
is gained only after years of working in a particular lo-
cale, and emphasizes the value of confident, experienced 
personnel in completing fuels treatment projects.
In some cases, it will be impossible to limit smoke 
impact from prescribed fire on communities. The pub-
lic can become more accepting of smoke if they fully 
understand its necessity, and if agencies take steps to 
minimize smoke impacts on communities. For example, 
the city of Flagstaff, AZ, has been successful in increas-
ing public acceptance of smoke through an extensive 
public outreach and education program that empha-
sizes the need for prescribed fire to reduce the risk of 
severe wildfire. They also take care to minimize smoke  
impacts to sensitive areas, such as schools and hospi-
tals, and coordinate activities as discussed above to 
limit the number of smoky days. They maintain a call 
list to notify those individuals in the community that 
are particularly sensitive to smoke several days before 
they conduct a prescribed fire. They have noticed that 
when people are forewarned, there is general tolerance 
of smoke for 1 day, but after 2 or 3 days, people begin 
to complain (Farnsworth and Summerfelt 2001). Thus, 
they take several additional steps in the wildland urban 
interface to minimize the number of days impacted by 
smoke. For example, they will burn no more than 150 
piles per day no more than once a week in a neighbor-
shed, an area they define as within a neighborhood or 
geographic area where smoke will accumulate and re-
main visible for at least four hours following the burn 
(Flagstaff Fire Department 2005).
Wildlife Habitat
While it is recognized that high-severity wildfire 
poses a serious threat to threatened and endangered 
species habitat, there is also some concern for the im-
pacts of fuel treatments on these species (Ganey and 
others 1999). Thus, restrictions are often imposed on 
use of some treatments in sensitive wildlife habitat. 
For example, fuels treatment activities are restricted in 
Mexican spotted owl habitat in some national forests of 

58	
USDA Forest Service RMRS-GTR-198.  2007
the Southwest. The owl is a federally threatened species 
that occurs throughout the Southwest and is a significant 
focus of management efforts in the region. These owls 
typically breed from March to August in mixed conifer 
forests and pine-oak forests. Because they are thought 
to have a low tolerance for heat, they generally prefer 
closed canopy forests with old-growth characteristics 
such as large trees, snags, and down woody material. The 
primary threats to the long-term survival of the species 
include timber harvest, particularly even-aged harvest 
methods, and catastrophic wildfire. Yet, the objectives 
of thinning to reduce wildfire hazard need to be balanced 
against the need to maintain critical owl habitat, which 
consists of rather dense forests stands. Guidelines devel-
oped in the Mexican spotted owl recovery plan (USDI 
Fish and Wildlife Service 1995) are aimed at maintain-
ing Mexican spotted owl habitat and protecting it from 
catastrophic wildfire. Since Mexican spotted owls gen-
erally do not nest in pure ponderosa pine stands, the 
restrictions on fuel treatments in owl habitat generally 
apply only to pine forests that have a Gambel oak com-
ponent, or those in steep canyons (slope >40 percent). 
The guidelines suggest restricting thinning operations in 
100 acre areas surrounding identified nest sites. In ad-
dition, thinning should be limited to trees that are less 
than 9 inches dbh and restricted to the non-breeding sea-
son (Sept. to Feb.) in protected activity centers (PACs) 
that are 600 acre areas surrounding designated nest sites. 
Pine forests with a significant Gambel oak component 
are considered “restricted habitat” where thinning should 
be limited to trees less than 24 inches dbh and removal 
of trees between 18 inches and 24 inches dbh should be 
minimal. It is also recommended that large oak trees be 
protected and that canopy cover should be at least 40 
percent. Similar restrictions on fuel treatments are rec-
ommended in northern goshawk habitat (Reynolds and 
others 1992) as well. Some fire managers have found 
that these restrictions limit opportunities to reduce wild-
fire risk at landscape scales.
Management strategies that successfully achieve 
multiple management objectives are often accomplished 
only when different resource managers work closely 
together and recognize the need to balance these objec-
tives. One example comes from the Gila National Forest 
in New Mexico. Here, during wildland fire use events, 
fire managers constantly consult with wildlife biolo-
gists to ensure that the fire not only reduces fuel loads 
but also benefits or does not adversely impact wildlife 
habitat. This exchange has allowed the development of 
strategies to allow fire to move into Mexican spotted owl 
habitat. But achieving desired results may require alter-
ing fire behavior to ensure that important owl habitat 
components (for example, large snags, logs, oaks) are 
protected. By working together, fire managers and wild-
life biologists developed fuels treatments that would be 
acceptable from both the perspective of fuels reduction 
and wildlife habitat improvement.
Wildland Urban Interface
The risk of escaped prescribed fire threatening struc-
tures is higher when burning in the wildland urban 
interface (WUI). This often makes managers uncom-
fortable conducting prescribed burns in these areas. In 
addition, many managers we interviewed suggested that 
the public is generally unhappy with the increased risk 
and exposure to smoke. However, many of these areas 
are in need of treatment in order to adequately protect 
communities from the threat of wildfire. Mechanical 
treatment is an option, but is expensive and cannot meet 
management objectives in all cases.
Management agencies around Flagstaff, AZ, have 
been very successful in conducting broadcast and pile 
burns near structures (Gatewood and Summerfelt 2005). 
Almost all treatments require some mechanical treat-
ment prior to burning. A typical treatment in ponderosa 
pine forests near Flagstaff includes a thinning operation, 
followed by pile burning, and then broadcast burning, 
all completed within a year. The mechanical treatments 
reduce canopy and ladder fuels and alter potential fire 
behavior during subsequent prescribed burning. The 
managers’ perception of risk is low because their expe-
rience igniting fire under such conditions is extensive. 
As further insurance, they use more personnel on these 
urban projects than they would to treat areas farther 
away from structures. An extensive outreach and public 
education program has been key in gaining public sup-
port for these mechanical fuel treatments and prescribed 
burns in the Flagstaff wildland urban interface. In fact, 
agencies managing neighboring public lands (for exam-
ple, the Forest Service) have likely benefited from these 
efforts as well.
Cross-agency Issues and Collaboration
Wildfires occur on landscape scales and do not obey 
jurisdictional boundaries. In order to be most effective, 
managers therefore need to derive strategies that reduce 
wildfire risk across landownership boundaries. Yet, there 
are often no incentives in place for working outside 
one’s management unit. Collaboration among adjacent 
landowners can greatly increase the effectiveness of 
fuel treatments across landscapes. Collaboration can 
allow partners to share resources (for example, equip-
ment, personnel, money). Collaboration can also lead to 

USDA Forest Service RMRS-GTR-198.  2007	
59
greater effectiveness of fuel treatments as strategies for 
mitigating fire spread patters are developed at more ap-
propriate scales (in other words, landscapes).
We encountered several examples of managers suc-
cessfully working across jurisdictional boundaries to 
more effectively reduce wildfire hazard. For example, 
the Gila National Forest allowed a wildland fire use 
event to spread onto adjacent private land with the sup-
port of the landowner to reduce surface fuels. The city 
of Flagstaff, AZ, will also conduct prescribed fires on 
private land with the landowner’s cooperation to reduce 
surface fuel loading. Because managers facilitated treat-
ments closer to structures, both of these examples did 
much more to protect structures from wildfire than if 
they had occurred exclusively on federal or city land. 
The sharing of resources essentially provided greater le-
verage for implementing fuel treatment projects.
A similar process is occurring on a much broader scale 
on the Coronado National Forest and surrounding lands 
in southern Arizona where future fuel treatments across 
the landscape are being planned. Rather than complete 
the process in isolation, the Forest has invited manag-
ers from adjacent landowners to the table. This includes 
managers from the Nature Conservancy, Department of 
Defense, Audubon Society, and National Park Service. 
Their joint environmental analysis will cover all  
jurisdictions and allow all agencies to use the informa-
tion in their own planning process. Thus, strategies for 
fuel treatment placement can be developed across juris-
dictional boundaries to more effectively reduce wildfire 
hazard on a landscape scale.
A stellar example of interagency collaboration in the 
Front Range would be the Front Range Fuels Treatment 
Partnership, comprising a collation of federal, state, and 
local agencies working with private landowners, conser-
vation organizations, and other stakeholders to reduce 
wildfire risk. The partnership has sponsored workshops, 
compiled data on forest condition and treatment tech-
niques, needs, and costs (Front Range Fuel Treatment 
Partnership Roundtable 2006), and has served as clear-
inghouse to educate stakeholders on fuels treatment is-
sues.
Coordinating fuel treatments across agency bound-
aries through efforts like these will maximize benefits 
gained in reducing wildfire risk and improve ecological 
integrity across landscapes, regardless of ownership. If 
the collaborative effort is extended to sharing resources 
during implementation, further savings will result. This 
could include extending fuel treatment contracts across 
jurisdictional boundaries, or conducting joint prescribed 
burns using personnel and equipment from cooperating 
agencies.

hile the overall outcome of fuel or restoration 
treatments may be beneficial in terms of reduc-
ing wildfire hazard and improving ecosystem health, 
unintended and undesirable effects, such as introduc-
tion of invasive species or excessive tree mortality can 
also occur. However, measures can be taken to ensure 
undesirable effects do not materialize or to mitigate un-
intended effects should they occur. In this section, we 
review several unintended outcomes of fuel and restora-
tion treatments and present some successful measures 
taken to mitigate these effects.
Monitoring of treatment effects is vital to ensure 
that restoration and fuel reduction treatments have the 
intended effect. When undesirable effects do occur, 
the monitoring data allows documentation of the ef-
fect and modification of treatment prescriptions so the 
undesirable effect does not occur in future treatments. 
Monitoring of treatment effects should be an integral 
part of any restoration or fuel reduction treatment and 
should include post-treatment recovery as well as evalu-
ation of direct treatment objectives. Despite this need, 
it is not uncommon for managers to neglect monitoring 
because of operational time and resource constraints. Yet 
in many cases, sufficient information can be gained from 
simple protocols that require relatively little investment 
in time and resources.
Undesirable Impacts of Fuel 
Treatments
Tree Mortality
Protection of large and old growth trees and those with 
other desirable characteristics is often a priority of res-
toration treatments because such trees provide important 
ecosystem amenities including wildlife habitat, opportu-
nities for large snag recruitment, greater genetic diversity, 
retention of cultural artifacts, and enhanced aesthetics. 
Under certain conditions, smoldering duff can damage 
tree roots and ultimately cause high levels of mortality of 
old growth trees (Graham and others 2004; Lindenmuth 
1960; Sackett and others 1996). Burning stands with high 
loading of surface fuels can also cause excessive tree 
scorch that can result in tree mortality (Harrington 1987; 
Jerman and others 2004; Swezy and Agee 1991; Wienk 
and others 2004; Wyant and others 1986). High levels of 
tree scorch can also leave trees more susceptible to bark 
beetle attack (Wallin and others 2003). Use of prescribed 
fire can be tenuous when there is high density of sap-
lings. Under safe burning conditions, it is often difficult 
to achieve fire behavior hot enough to kill tree seedlings 
and saplings under dense forest canopies and thus meet 
treatment objectives (Agee and Skinner 2005; Sackett 
and others 1996). However, burning under more extreme 
conditions can lead to undesirable ecological effects. If 
smaller trees ignite, they can act as ladder fuels, carry-
ing fire into the canopy of larger trees. Tree mortality is 
not limited to prescribed fire treatments alone. Undesired 
mortality and damage to residual trees can also occur dur-
ing mechanical treatments (fig. 33). Large equipment can 
knock over trees and damage roots, bark, and branches to 
the point of causing tree mortality.

Monitoring

Non-native Species
Non-native species are often adapted to disturbed 
environments with increased availability of resources 
such as light, nitrogen, and water (Hobbs and Huenneke 
1992). Since fuel treatments constitute a disturbance, 
they can also encourage establishment of invasive spe-
cies that may ultimately have negative consequences to 
native species and biodiversity (Mack and others 2000). 
Cover of non-native plants has been found to increase 
following prescribed fire and mechanical treatments 
in ponderosa pine forests (Crawford and others 2001; 
Griffis and others 2001; Hunter and others 2006; Keeley 
and others 2003; Metlen and Fiedler 2006) (fig. 4). If 
disturbance intensity is high, non-native plants do seem 
to be even more likely to establish and spread. For ex-
ample, non-native plants have been found to establish 
following high intensity wildfires (Crawford and oth-
ers 2001; Griffis and others 2001; Hunter and others 
2006; Keeley and others 2003) and following particu-
larly aggressive mechanical treatments where a great 
deal of the existing basal area is removed (Abella and 
Covington 2004; Fule and others 2005). Establishment 
of non-native species is also a function of the number of 
available propagules, or seeds, of non-native species at a 
site. Areas with a long history of disturbance have been 
reported to have more non-native species stored in the 
seedbank than in more pristine areas (Korb and others 
2005). This may explain why non-native species have 
not been found following wildfires in more remote areas 
in northern Arizona (Laughlin and others 2004, 2005). 
Fuel treatments also carry the risk of transporting seeds 
of non-native species attached to mechanical equipment 
or people to a site.
Air Quality
Smoke produced from prescribed fires is problematic 
because it can pose threats to human health and impair 
visibility and thus, is regulated under state and federal 
laws. In addition, the public’s negative reaction to smoke 
can threaten prescribed fire programs. When fuels burn 
efficiently, the smoke is composed mostly of carbon di-
oxide and water. While these are greenhouse gasses, 
they are not considered pollutants and are not regulated 
as such. Fuels burn efficiently when most of the fuel is 
combusted in the flaming stage (DeBano and others 1998; 
Mahaffey and Miller 1994). When fuels are combusted 
during a smoldering fire, they burn inefficiently, more 
smoke is produced, and other pollutants, such as particu-
lates, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen and sulfur oxides, 
are released with the smoke. These pollutants are often 
subject to regulation under federal and state laws.
Aesthetics
There are several aspects of prescribed fire and me-
chanical fuel treatments that should be considered from 
an aesthetics perspective. This is particularly important 
for treatment areas that are readily visible by the pub-
lic. Public acceptance of fuel treatment programs is vital 
for long-term support of these programs and is often a 
function of the perceived aesthetics (Winter and others 
2002). Managers with the Flagstaff Fire Department have 
noticed that the public tends not to support prescribed 
fire efforts when they result in excessive tree scorch or 
mortality, particularly of large trees. Many managers 
have found that the public does not like the way treated 
areas look immediately after prescribed fires, but find 
the aesthetics acceptable 1 or 2 years later. Managers of 
the Colorado State Forest have noticed that residual tree 
damage from mechanical equipment is also a factor that 
can impact the public’s perception of aesthetics. Freshly 
shredded trees, scattered debris, and disturbed soil also 
affect aesthetics in mechanically treated areas, especial-
ly when large volumes of material remain (fig. 34).
Wildlife Habitat
Prescribed fire and mechanical treatments can have 
negative impacts on many important components of wild-
life habitat, such as snags, downed logs, and old growth 
or large trees (Horton and Mann 1988; Randall-Parker 
and Miller 2002). Snags are particularly important for 
cavity nesting birds and bats. Downed logs provide habi-
tat for small mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and insects. 
Large trees are used by a variety of wildlife species for 
nesting, feeding, foraging, and roosting. Prescribed fires 
tend to consume snags and downed logs and can cause 
mortality of large trees through damage to fine roots. 
While some new snags can be recruited from killed trees 
and downed logs can result from fallen snags, the gain in 
new snags and downed logs generally does not offset the 
loss from prescribed burning (Randall-Parker and Miller 
2002). This is particularly true for large snags (Horton 
and Mann 1988). The impacts of multiple prescribed 
fires on snags and downed logs are not well understood. 
However, Holden and others (2006) found that even af-
ter multiple burns, snag density was within the range 
adopted by the U.S. Forest Service as necessary to main-
tain viable populations of cavity nesting birds.
While control of dense thickets of Gambel oak is 
sometimes desirable in ponderosa pine forests (see 
Livestock Grazing and Chemical Treatment section), 
large and isolated Gambel oak trees provide very im-
portant wildlife habitat in ponderosa pine forests of the 
Southwest (Harper and others 1985). Bird diversity tends 

USDA Forest Service RMRS-GTR-198.  2007	
63
to be higher in ponderosa pine forests that have some 
Gambel oak component (Rosenstock 1998), and small 
mammals tend to prefer large Gambel oaks (Chambers 
2002). There is some indication that prescribed burn-
ing may increase mortality of large and old Gambel oak 
trees (Randall-Parker and Miller 2002).
Wildlife species found throughout ponderosa pine 
forests can be adapted to a wide variety of forest condi-
tions, from openings to relatively dense forest stands. 
For example, while many ungulates prefer open stands 
or small openings for feeding, they also need more dense 
stands for protective and thermal cover (Ffolliott 1997). 
It is important to maintain a variety of stand structures 
and spatial distributions across the landscape to maintain 
sufficient habitat for the wide range of species in these 
forests. When uniform treatment prescriptions are used, 
there is danger in creating a homogenous landscape in 
which important habitat for many species is lost.
Cultural Resources
Preservation of prehistoric and historical sites and 
artifacts is important for understanding past societies 
and our cultural heritage. Such sites and resources are 
prominent in western landscapes. Prehistoric cultural 
resources include artifacts, ceremonial or residential 
sites, and rock art panels including pictographs and 
petroglyphs. Historical resources include old cab-
ins, homesteads, logging camps, battlegrounds, trails,  
mining claims, and artifacts from such sites (Hanes 
1994). Prescribed fire and mechanical fuel treatment 
activities have the potential to damage these resources 
in a variety of ways. Cultural resources can be directly 
scorched, altered, or consumed by prescribed fire and 
heavy equipment. The potential for damage depends 
on the type of artifact material, whether it is above or 
below ground, the intensity of a fire, or the type of me-
chanical treatment. For example, organic materials have 
much less capacity to retain heat than stone or ceramic 
materials. Stone is subject to damage at temperatures 
above 700° F, while ceramic is subject to damage at 
temperatures above 925° F (Hanes 1994). Pictographs 
are especially vulnerable to damage from prescribed 
fire. However, prescribed fire is not likely to reach tem-
peratures that would result in damage to artifacts that are 
buried below the surface. In general, higher fire inten-
sity will increase the potential for damage to cultural and 
historical resources. Mechanical treatment activities and 
equipment that does not disturb or compact the soil will 
have minimal effect on artifacts compared to tracked ve-
hicles, bulldozers, fire line plows, and so forth.
Accurate dating of prehistoric sites and artifacts 
can also be compromised by prescribed fire. For ex-
ample, carbon dating of charcoal remains is often done 
to determine the approximate age of prehistoric sites. 
However, this process can be compromised if the char-
coal is contaminated with ash and charcoal from more 
recent fires. Pollen preserved in prehistoric sites can be

tion is generally not consid-

used in paleoenvironmental and dietary studies. Pollen 
is generally destroyed when exposed to temperatures 
above 600° F. Similarly, dating of pottery fragments, 
obsidian, and other materials becomes highly inaccu-
rate if these materials are subject to intense heat (Hanes 
1994). Both prescribed fire and mechanical treatments 
can destroy valuable tree ring records of past climate, 
fires, insect outbreaks, and other disturbances. This oc-
curs most often when sound stumps, logs, and snags are 
burned or destroyed. For example, the 2002 Hayman 
Fire in Colorado destroyed nearly all dead wood that 
was sampled to develop fire history chronologies pre-
sented in Brown and others (1999). Evidence of early 
fires no longer exists in the severely burned portion 
of the Hayman Fire where all surface fuels were con-
sumed.
Soil Resources
When heavy equipment drives over the soil surface, it 
may compact or physically displace soil. Increased soil 
compaction can make it harder for plants to extract water 
and nutrients from the soil and thus decrease the produc-
tivity of a site (Poff 1996). This effect is dependent upon 
the number and type of vehicle passes and can last years 
to decades (Shepperd 1993). However, soil compaction 
is not a serious problem on all soil types. For example, 
soils containing high levels of organic matter, surface 
rock fragments, and sand or clay content are generally 
less susceptible to compaction (Greacean and Sands 
1980; Lull 1959; Poff 1996). Displaced soil also has 
long-term consequences for site productivity. Displaced 
soil can ultimately be deposited in lakes or streams and 
impair water quality. Since scarified seedbeds favor nat-
ural ponderosa pine seedling establishment (Shepperd 
and others 2006), excessive soil disturbance in fuels 
treatment areas can result in quicker re-establishment of 
ladder fuels.
Mastication, chipping, and mowing all result in large 
increases in woody material on the soil surface. This in-
crease in woody biomass has the potential to impact a 
variety of ecological attributes. For example, the avail-
ability of nitrogen in the system may initially decrease 
as nitrogen is tied up in decomposing organisms and 
a subsequent increase in nutrient availability once the 
material is completely decomposed (Resh and others 
2005). However, if the layer of material is excessively 
thick, decomposition may be slow and nutrients may 
be tied up for some time (Graham and others 2004). 
This material often acts as mulch, resulting in increas-
es in soil moisture and decreases in daily temperature 
fluctuations. It may also prevent establishment of tree 
seedlings and understory vegetation, particularly if 
material is left in a thick layer. There is some evidence 
to suggest that the wood material provides habitat for 
insects and pathogens that may then impact standing 
trees.
Often, masticated fuels are subsequently burned to in-
crease the rate of decomposition. There is some concern 
that burning high loadings of masticated fuels can re-
sult in high fire intensity and thus, adverse fire effects on 
soils and vegetation. Burning thick layers of masticated 
fuels often results in large heat pulses to the soil that 
can potentially kill soil organisms, seeds, and plant roots 
(Busse and others 2005). Similar effects can be seen un-
der burned slash piles (Korb and others 2004; Massaman 
and others 2003). The resultant conditions may provide 
ideal opportunities for establishment of invasive species 
(Korb and others 2004; Wolfson and others 2005). In 
addition, there is some concern that burning masticated 
material would smolder and create smoke management 
problems.
Insect and Disease Outbreaks
Several studies have been conducted on how fire af-
fects the risk and hazard of insect infestations and how 
insects influence the probability of fire ignition, spread, 
and severity (Billings and others 2004; Cunningham 
and others 2005; Mathew 2003; Moretti and Barbalat 
2004). Some of these studies have examined the im-
pacts of fuels treatments, especially prescribed fires 
(Boyle and others 2004; Sullivan and others 2003). 
These studies have shown that fire can injure or kill 
insects directly, cause them to leave burning areas, 
or attract them (Evans 1971). Different insect species 
respond differently to fire. Huff and Smith (2000) list 
six responses of animal communities to fire: invade, 
exploit, resist, endure, avoid, and vacillate. These cat-
egories are applicable to insects as well. Some insects 
are vulnerable only at certain stages of their life cycle. 
For example, bark beetles can be protected from fire 
and many other threats while feeding under bark. Some 
insects live for periods of their life, or even their en-
tire life, underground where their survival during a fire 
depends on the fire severity. Many insects can flee an 
approaching fire. Others are attracted to the heat, smoke, 
or carbon dioxide emitted by a fire. Understanding 
these behavioral responses offers a core for develop-
ing fire management options aimed at reducing fire risk 
and hazard by managing insect populations or manag-
ing the probability of insect infestation.

Mitigation of Undesirable Fuel 
Treatment Impacts
Tree Mortality
Some researchers have recommended mechanically 
removing duff around the base of old growth trees before 
prescribed fire is initiated (Covington and others 1997). 
While such treatments have been successful in reduc-
ing tree mortality, many managers find this practice very 
labor intensive and too expensive given the resources 
they have to complete projects. Thus, this practice may 
not be feasible in all situations. Others have been able 
to achieve appropriate mortality levels without duff re-
moval by conducting prescribed fires under conditions 
that promote low fire intensity (for example, high rela-
tively humidity and low air temperature) (Bastain 2001; 
Davis and others 1968; Kaufmann and Covington 2001; 
Swezy and Agee 1991). However, such fires may not 
be effective in reducing surface fuel loadings to levels 
sufficient for reducing wildfire hazard. Thus, multiple 
prescribed fires may be needed. Season of burning can 
also be taken into account, as trees are often more sus-
ceptible to the stress of fire during the growing season 
(spring and summer) (Harrington 1987).
Even when density of saplings is high, there seems to 
be some potential for use of high intensity fire exhibiting 
some torching to reduce tree density. This may also pose 
a threat to mortality of larger and desirable trees, espe-
cially if torching of smaller trees occurs and increases 
the potential for fire to spread into the canopies of larger 
trees. Reintroduction of fire may be possible only after 
some of the smaller trees have been mechanically re-
moved (Covington and others 1997; Fule and others 
2001; Graham and others 2004; Wallin and others 2004). 
Alternatively, it may be used under conditions that pro-
mote a fire that mainly affects smaller trees through 
cambial damage or some scorching of tree canopy, while 
posing little impact on larger trees. Burning under such 
moderate conditions may not be sufficient in killing 
smaller trees and reducing stand density as many trees 
can survive these burning conditions. Instead, multiple 
low intensity prescribed fires may be needed to success-
fully kill small trees and reduce tree density without 
harming overstory trees (Fule and others 2002a).
Non-native Plants
Spread of non-native plants can be handled by taking 
measures to limit seed dispersal and establishment, or by 
eliminating populations of non-natives before they es-
tablish and spread throughout the treatment area. A very 
effective pre-emptive measure is to limit the degree to 
which people and mechanical equipment disperse seeds 
in a site. For example, many management agencies 
require that equipment be washed to remove seeds be-
fore entering a treatment unit. On the Prescott National 
Forest, managers take further measures to ensure that 
seed spread by humans will be minimal by avoiding 
obvious non-native plant populations when placing 
landings and fuel breaks or holding personnel briefings.
Spread of non-native plants following fuel treatments 
can be expected if seeds are already on site. To mitigate 
these potential impacts, individual non-native plants 
should be quickly controlled before populations spread 
and reach uncontrollable levels. Managers in northern 
Arizona have successfully controlled for non-native 
species in slash pile scars by amending them with arbus-
cular mycorrhizal fungi and seeds from native species 
(Korb and others 2004). In Custer State Park, SD, large 
machine pile scars are generally sprayed with herbicide 
to control non-natives and then amended with native 
seeds. Several years after the treatment, the former burn 
scars were indistinguishable in a native grass meadow 
in the park. Only certified weed-free native seed mixes 
should be used. Further caution is needed as some mixes 
have been suspected of contamination with seeds from 
non-native plants (Hunter and others 2006; Springer and 
others 2001). Mechanical removal of invasive plants, 
mowing to prevent seed ripening, or introduction of 
biological agents that kill specific invasive plants are 
all additional measures that can control non-native plant 
populations.
Air Quality
Problems associated with smoke can be alleviated by 
burning under conditions that result in more efficient 
combustion of fuels (DeBano and others 1998; Mahaffey 
and Miller 1994). The efficiency of combustion can be 
influenced by ignition techniques, fuel structure, and 
burning conditions. For example, head fires tend to be 
fast moving while back fires move much more slowly. 
Little fuel is burned in the flaming front of a fast moving 
head fire compared to a slow moving backing fire. In 
a heading fire, more fuels tend to burn in a smoldering 
manner after the flaming front has passed. Thus, head 
fires tend to produce more smoke and pollutants than 
back fires.
Fuel structure also determines the amount of smoke 
and pollutants produced in a fire (Mahaffey and Miller 
1994). Fine fuels tend to burn efficiently while large di-
ameter fuels tend to smolder. Tightly packed fuels tend to 
smolder more than loosely packed fuels. Dry fuels tend 
to burn more completely than wet fuels. The amount of 
smoke produced from a fire can be controlled by burning 

66	
USDA Forest Service RMRS-GTR-198.  2007
when conditions favor certain fuels and not others. For 
example, if reduction of fine fuels is the primary goal, 
a fire can be set when fuel moisture of the fine fuels is 
low and fuel moisture of the large fuels is high. Smoke 
production would thus be lessened if larger fuels were 
not available to burn.
When large amounts of smoke production are inevita-
ble from a prescribed fire, care should be taken to ensure 
that smoke does not drift into sensitive areas such as sce-
nic vistas, urban areas, or road corridors (DeBano and 
others 1998; Mahaffey and Miller 1994). This can be ac-
complished by burning when wind is not blowing in the 
direction of the sensitive area. If smoke drifts into sensi-
tive areas, care should be taken to ensure that the smoke 
plume mixes with substantial amounts of air before it 
reaches the sensitive area. This can be accomplished by 
burning when the atmosphere is somewhat unstable and 
will promote rapid mixing. However, burns should not 
be conducted when the atmosphere is extremely unsta-
ble, as this can promote extreme fire behavior. Mixing 
of the smoke with air can also be encouraged by cre-
ating burning conditions that promote development of 
a convection column that allows smoke to rise rapidly 
to the upper atmosphere. For example, mass ignitions 
are more likely to create convective conditions than line 
ignitions.
The Flagstaff Fire Department has been very success-
ful in managing smoke production from prescribed fires 
in the wildland urban interface by adhering to several 
management practices (Flagstaff Fire Department 2005). 
In general, prescribed burns are avoided adjacent to sen-
sitive areas such as medical centers and nursing homes. 
If burns are conducted near schools, they are done when 
school is not in session. If possible, burns are conducted 
in the summer when day lengths are long. This reduces 
the risk of nighttime smoke inversions. Burns are also 
conducted when forecasts for ventilation are good or 
excellent. To reduce smoke emission, backing fires are 
normally used and some woody material may be re-
moved or isolated prior to burning. Managers adhere to 
maximum burn guidelines by burning no more than 150 
piles per day no more than once a week in a neighbor-
shed and no more than 50 acres per week on a broadcast 
burn in a neighborshed. In addition, managers notify 
the media and the public about planned prescribed fires 
and possible smoke impacts before burns are conducted. 
One of the reasons the program is so successful is the 
time and energy put into the extensive public outreach 
and education program.
Smoke management is an integral part of the prescribed 
fire planning process. With careful planning and experi-
ence, problems associated with smoke can be avoided 
or at least minimized. Several models are available to 
help predict the amount of smoke likely to be released 
from a fire and the direction the smoke should spread al-
though they have had varying success. A relatively new 
model increasingly being used by managers, the Smoke 
Impact Spreadsheet (SIS), has shown some success in 
accurately predicting particulate matter emissions from 
prescribed fires. This model incorporates the First Order 
Fire Effects Model (FOFEM) and CONSUME to pre-
dict downwind emissions of particulate matter from 
wildfires, broadcast burns, and pile burns (Wickman and 
Acheson 2005).
Aesthetics
In general, a fuels treatment that is good for the eco-
system can also be aesthetically pleasing, if applied 
properly. Avoiding excessive scorch or mechanical 
damage to residual trees is beneficial from a variety of 
resource standpoints. Excessive residual surface fuel 
loading is probably not acceptable from either an aes-
thetic or a fire hazard perspective. In heavily used or 
visible areas, care should be taken to maintain stand 
characteristics that contribute to the aesthetic quality 
of the forest, including retention of large trees, spatial 
and structural diversity, and minimizing surface de-
bris. Measures can also be taken in such areas to limit 
tree mortality. For example, managers in Bandelier 
National Monument have removed heavy loadings of 
duff around old growth trees in highly visible areas to 
limit mortality from prescribed fires. While this prac-
tice is generally too labor intensive to practice on all 
prescribed fires, it has been done in areas that are more 
visible. To avoid residual tree damage, foresters with 
the Colorado State Forest Service recommend being 
very specific in contracts about acceptable residual 
tree damage and holding contractors responsible for 
unacceptable levels of damage. Negative results can 
be avoided by having a detailed contract, stringent 
enforcement, and a mutual understanding with the 
contractor as to what is expected. In some cases, the 
Colorado State foresters will treat a test plot prior to 
treating the entire unit to ensure the contractor under-
stands the desired treatment effects.
The choice of fuel treatment technique can also af-
fect resulting aesthetics. For example, the Pike National 
Forest uses public firewood sales to clean up tree boles 
dropped by Forest Service crews in accessible (and 
highly visible) units along highways. This highly effec-
tive technique meets public demand for firewood, builds 
goodwill and acceptance of fuels treatments, and dra-
matically reduces heavy fuel loading. Subsequent low 
intensity prescribed burns are then used to eliminate 

USDA Forest Service RMRS-GTR-198.  2007	
67
remaining surface fuels with minimal adverse smoke ef-
fects and residual tree damage.
Wildlife Habitat
Measures can be taken to ensure prescribed burns do 
not result in excessive loss of these important wildlife 
habitat components. Burning snags can be prevented by 
removing fuels from the base of snags prior to burning 
(Anderson 1994; Randall-Parker and Miller 2002), or by 
black lining snags prior to burning the entire unit. Large 
diameter snags, which are often preferred by cavity nest-
ing birds, may be in particular need of protection as there 
is little potential for large snag recruitment given the lack 
of large diameter trees in many areas (Horton and Mann 
1988). The same can be done to large or old growth trees 
to prevent mortality. Foresters with the Colorado State 
Forest occasionally removed fuels around large pieces of 
coarse woody debris to protect them in prescribed fires. 
Burns can also be conducted when moisture contents of 
fuels are such that only small diameter fuels will burn 
and large fuels will be spared (Anderson 1994; Randall-
Parker and Miller 2002). Burning in early spring shortly 
after snowmelt can be effective in accomplishing this 
result (Shepperd 2004). If surface fuels are to be re-
moved through burning of piles, large diameter logs can 
be intentionally left out of the piles to create wildlife 
habitat. To limit mortality of large oak trees during pre-
scribed fire, managers in northern Arizona often create 
fuel breaks around large oak trees prior to burning. To 
do this in a cost effective manner, they use an innovative 
ATV fire line plow created from an old truck wheel (see 
SECTION IV, Tools Used in Burning). In addition, care 
can be taken so that oak litter is not directly ignited and 
instead, fire is allowed to creep through it. Managers on 
the Coconino National Forest have found that this prac-
tice limits mortality of large oak trees.
When treating ponderosa pine landscapes to reduce 
fire hazard, it is important to ensure such activities result 
in a mosaic of forest cover types across the landscape 
that are likely to be the most beneficial in providing 
habitat for a variety of species (Fiedler and Cully 1995; 
Shepperd and Battaglia 2002; Sieg and Severson 1996). 
Heterogeneity in stand structure should also be a man-
agement goal on the stand level. Rather than promoting 
a uniform treatment prescription, managers should strive 
to create heterogeneity by using a variety of treatment 
prescriptions and in some cases, conducting no treatment 
at all. Historical forest structure can be used as a guide in 
this process. For example, heavier thinning prescriptions 
may be justified in areas that would have had low tree 
density historically (for example, south-facing slopes, 
meadows), while less intensive thinning prescriptions 
may be more appropriate in other portions of the land-
scape (for example, north-facing slopes). Managers on 
the Santa Fe National Forest have accomplished this by 
designing treatment prescriptions so areas in the forest 
that may have historically had higher tree density, like 
drainages, would have fewer trees removed.
Cultural Resources
Damage to cultural and historical resources from 
prescribed fire can be easily avoided by knowing the 
number, type, and distribution of cultural resources in 
a management area. Extensive archeological surveys 
in proposed treatment areas can substantially increase 
the cost of fuel treatments, but must be done if artifacts 
are suspected in the area. Sensitive materials can be 
removed from a site prior to treatment. If this is not pos-
sible, sensitive areas can be excluded from prescribed 
burning or mechanical treatment efforts. Fuel breaks can 
also be constructed around sensitive areas or high fuels 
loads can be manually removed around sensitive areas. 
Similarly, tree ring collections can be made prior to 
treatment, or potential sample specimens can be avoid-
ed. On the other hand, we should not forget potential 
positive cultural resource benefits resulting from fuels 
treatments. Managers at Bandelier National Monument 
have actually justified use of prescribed fire to protect 
sensitive areas that would otherwise be subject to much 
more extreme heat from a wildfire.
Soil Resources
Soil disturbance and compaction can be easily avoid-
ed by using hand crews in lieu of machines to fell and 
process trees. This may be a valid choice in very sen-
sitive areas or on smaller treatment units. However, in 
some cases, use of mechanical equipment may be jus-
tified. While some soil compaction and disturbance is 
inevitable when heavy equipment is used for thinning 
or understory biomass alteration/removal, certain pro-
cedures or equipment can minimize the amount of soil 
compaction across a site. For example, using equipment 
that has longer reach and more maneuverability reduces 
the percentage of the area that the equipment needs to 
traverse. If boom-mounted machines are not available, 
care should be taken to ensure that machines stay in des-
ignated paths designed to minimize machine movement 
across the site. Felling trees in the direction of the skid 
trail can also minimize soil disturbance and compaction 
by minimizing skidding distance (Minard 2003).
Several agencies in northern Arizona limit damage 
to soil resources using a technique developed on the 
Mormon Lake Ranger District of the Coconico National 

68	
USDA Forest Service RMRS-GTR-198.  2007
Forest (Farsworth and Summerfelt 2001). With this 
method, trees are directionally felled into a windrow 
and are then pushed into large piles by a dozer during a 
single pass. Few ruts are made because the dozer is not 
constantly spinning and turning. Smaller, more maneu-
verable machines apply less ground pressure and lead 
to less soil compaction than larger machines. However, 
the effects of large machines are not as severe if the 
ground pressure is applied over a larger area (Poff 1996; 
Windell and Bradshaw 2000). Track-mounted machines 
tend to lead to less soil compaction than wheel-mounted 
machines as they allow the machine weight to be distrib-
uted over a larger area, but their skid-steering design can 
disturb soil to a greater extent. Soil compaction can also 
be minimized by conducting treatments when the soil 
is frozen or extremely dry, or by driving machines over 
protective layers of litter, slash, or snow (Poff 1996; 
Windell and Bradshaw 2000). Even on gentle slopes, 
road access or landings should be downhill of the treat-
ment area. Skidding or forwarding logs uphill can result 
in substantial soil erosion and treatment costs (Fight and 
others 2003).
Some of the effects of burning masticated fuels may 
be avoided by burning multiple times under relatively 
wet conditions so that fuels are removed in stages. For 
example, a first burn can be accomplished when the top 
layer of masticated fuel is dry but the bottom layers are 
wet and thus, not readily ignited. Residual fuels can then 
be burned in subsequent burns, at 2- to 3-year rotations. 
Managers on the San Juan National Forest have achieved 
some success by using this technique. Adverse effects 
of burning slash piles can be avoided by keeping piles 
relatively small or burning larger piles when the soil is 
frozen or there is some snow on the ground (Farnsworth 
and Summerfelt 2001). This results in fewer piles per 
acre that can be ignited under snowier and wetter con-
ditions than traditional hand piles. This method is also 
more productive than hand piling. However, managers 
should note that burning any pile results in very high 
soil temperatures and associated adverse soil effects 
(Massman and others 2003, 2006).
Insect and Disease Outbreaks
Few studies have examined insect-fire interactions at 
the landscape scale, although this subject has recently 
received increased attention (Howe and Baker 2003; 
Saint-Germain and others 2004; Sturtevant and others 
2004). At the landscape scale, insects create, and are af-
fected by, the spatial patterns of suitable and unsuitable 
habitat patches. Large fires seldom affect all burned areas 
equally, but the burned area usually arises from crown 
fires, severe surface fires, stand replacing fires, and  
understory fires that create a patchy spatially patterned 
environment composed of a variety of potential insect 
habitats. This spatial heterogeneity and variety of habitats 
helps to maintain insect populations, diversity of insect 
behavioral traits including wood-feeders, and genetic di-
versity among local insect populations. The configuration 
of suitable habitat, distance between suitable patches, 
and the nature of the landscape matrix between patches 
all influence the abundance, dispersal, and survivability 
of insect populations. These landscape attributes also de-
termine the potential for insect outbreaks. Understanding 
how to make use of spatial patterns to manage fire and 
insect risk and hazard are fundamental to landscape fire 
and insect management, but much still needs to be de-
veloped.
Monitoring
Agencies often implement fuel treatment activities 
without fully knowing about their effectiveness or their 
potential impact on other values at risk. Monitoring of 
treatment effects is imperative to determine treatment 
effectiveness and to ensure undesirable effects do not 
materialize. Managers who have made monitoring ef-
forts a priority have been able to operate more in an 
adaptive management framework by altering man-
agement actions when ineffectiveness or undesirable 
outcomes have been documented. Such data helps build 
public confidence and acceptance of fuels treatments, 
especially when it is shared openly among stakeholders 
and is used to help plan and implement future activities.
Several monitoring protocols have been developed 
specifically for monitoring the effects of fuels treatments. 
The most commonly used protocols within government 
agencies include the fire effects monitoring guide devel-
oped by the National Park Service (USDI National Park 
Service 2003) and FIREMON (Lutes and others 2006). 
While both protocols were developed for monitoring of 
prescribed fires, wildfires, and wildland fire use fires, 
they could be easily adapted for other fuel treatments 
(for example, thinning and grazing). These monitoring 
protocols recommend a basic level of monitoring that 
includes data on vegetation (for example, species com-
position and cover), stand structure (for example, tree 
density and size class distribution), fuels (for example, 
loading and depth), and basic fire effects (for example, 
scorch height and char height). These programs also 
provide detailed instruction for plot layout, data organi-
zation, and analysis.
This basic level of monitoring allows one to assess 
a wide variety of fuel treatment objectives. Data on 
fuels can be used to determine whether treatments are  

USDA Forest Service RMRS-GTR-198.  2007

effective in reducing fuel loading to desired levels. Data 
on fire effects can be used to assure treatments result in 
desirable levels of tree mortality. Data on vegetation can 
be used to ensure treatments result in desirable levels of 
understory production while discouraging establishment 
of non-native, invasive species. Of course, in order to 
assess change, one must collect data before treatments 
are implemented, immediately after treatments are 
implemented, and again at regular time intervals follow-
ing treatment, typically every year for up to 5 years or 
more.
Our observation in gathering information for this 
report is that with the exception of the National Park 
Service, most agencies struggle to allocate time and 
money to monitoring efforts, even while recogniz-
ing their importance. In response to this shortcoming, 
some have designed protocols that are flexible and can 
be altered depending on resources available for moni-
toring. For example, FIREMON describes three levels 
of monitoring designed for different levels of resources 
(Lutes 2006). Managers can alter monitoring protocols 
depending on resources available in several ways. If few 
resources are available for monitoring, managers may 
decide to collect data from fewer plots or not to collect 
data from a control plot. This will likely mean that it 
will be more difficult to detect treatment effects statisti-
cally, and results will have to be described in qualitative 
rather than quantitative terms. While this may not be 
ideal, it is still more desirable than collecting no data 
in conjunction with fuel treatments. FIREMON spe-
cifically discusses the number of plots that should be 
assessed given the level of resources available and the 
desired robustness of data. Managers can also collect 
data on fewer variables if resources for monitoring are 
scarce. However, some have noted that much of the cost  
associated with monitoring can be attributed to trans-
porting crews to and from monitoring sites. It is often a 
more efficient use of resources to collect as much data 
as possible while at the monitoring site (USDI National 
Park Service 2003).
The level of monitoring recommended by the National 
Park Service and other agencies may still be too de-
tailed for the needs of other smaller organizations. The 
Collaborative Forest Restoration Program (CFRP) has 
attempted to meet monitoring needs of other organiza-
tions in New Mexico. This granting program supports 
restoration projects on federal, state, municipal, and 
tribal lands in New Mexico. An integral requirement for 
funding under this program is a multiparty monitoring 
protocol. Simple protocols for a variety of variables are 
available at http://www.fs.fed.us/r3/spf/cfrp/ (accessed 
10-25-06). While developed in New Mexico, these pro-
tocols could also be adapted for other regions.
In some cases, the basic protocols discussed above 
may not be useful for meeting other monitoring objec-
tives. This may particularly be true if a management area 
is managed for a very specific resource such as Native 
American ruins or sensitive wildlife habitat. These 
monitoring protocols will not be useful for determining 
whether or not prescribed fire damages sensitive Native 
American artifacts. In such special cases, more specific 
monitoring protocols need to be developed to assure 
treatments are benefiting the desired resource, or at least 
not harming it.
Responsibility for monitoring does not end with the 
field data collection. It should include archiving and 
cataloging of results in a permanent database available 
and readable to future generations of fuel managers. 
Another advantage of using developed programs such 
as FIREMON and the National Park Service monitoring 
protocol is that data archiving and analysis applications 
have been developed with the protocols. This allows for 
a systematic framework for archiving data.

uring our conversations with managers through-
out the Southwest, Front Range, and Black Hills, 
we discovered that while many managers are driven by 
similar resource management objectives, very different 
approaches are taken to achieve these objectives. There 
is no one method for effectively meeting management 
objectives, but we have noticed that success is more 
likely to be achieved when several broad management 
principles are followed. We attempt to summarize those 
principles here as broad guidelines that can be applied 
to any management scenario and are imperative to con-
sider in any fuel treatment or restoration project. We also 
present specific examples we encountered of how man-
agers are implementing these principles.
Integrating Ecological Knowledge 
and Principles into Fuel Projects
Fuel treatments should be designed to accomplish 
more than reduced wildfire risk or hazard. When oth-
er resource management objectives are incorporated 
into projects, fuels treatments will ultimately be more 
ecologically sustainable. This is best achieved through 
restoration of forested systems to conditions that were 
seen prior to major disruptions often associated with 
Euro-American settlement. We recognize that restora-
tion will not always be compatible with reducing wildfire 
hazard. However, where reducing wildfire hazard takes 
precedent over restoration, attempts can still be made to 
restore certain features of historical stands. For example, 
in areas where habitat features such as large trees and 
snags have been lost, development of these important 
habitat components should be encouraged.
In ponderosa pine forests adapted to historical sur-
face fire regimes, ecological restoration goals include 
surface and canopy fuel reduction, protection of old 
trees, recovery of native understory vegetation, and the 
reintroduction of surface fire as a key ecological process 
(Allen and others 2002; Covington and others 1997; Fule 
and others 2006). If managers are to mimic the effects 
of natural disturbances, they must integrate the timing 
and severity of prescribed disturbances with the ecologi-
cal requirements of the desired landscape composition 
and condition (Hudak and others 2006). Understanding 
the effects of different types of disturbances and asso-
ciated alteration of key processes may help to promote 
ecosystem resiliency through improved management de-
cisions. Fuel reduction treatments influence vegetation 
succession, and the individual and cumulative effects 
of these treatments may have positive and negative im-
plications for ecosystem character and function (Noss 
and others 2006). Development of sustainable relation-
ships between humans and their environments requires 
knowledge of successional consequences and planning 
on a broad spatial scale.
Goals of restoration and reduced wildfire hazard may 
not always overlap in mixed-severity fire regimes more 
commonly found in the Front Range and Black Hills. 
While some portions of these forests burned histori-
cally with low intensity surface fire, pockets with high 
intensity crown fire on a small scale were also com-
mon (Brown and Sieg 1996; Brown and others 1999; 
Huckaby and others 2001). This likely resulted in a 
landscape mosaic composed of openings, stands with 
low tree density, and stands with relatively high tree 
density. Thus, a fully restored landscape is not likely to 
result in acceptable levels of wildfire hazard reduction 
given the patchwork of public and private land found in 
these landscapes. However, certain aspects of historical 
structure and processes can and should be incorporated 
into fuel treatments, particularly on a landscape scale. 
For example, care may be taken to maintain patches of 
densely stocked forest in areas where they would not 
pose an undue hazard to human communities.
Case Study
Many fire managers recognize that re-establishing 
appropriate fire regimes to fire-adapted ecosystems is 
imperative for allowing natural processes to shape eco-
systems. Fire is likely the best tool available to create 
the natural heterogeneity in forest structure at stand and 
landscape scales. Managers on the Gila National Forest 
have been very successful in allowing naturally ignited 
fire to shape the landscape. Since their wildland fire use 
program has been implemented (over 30 years ago), 
multiple areas have burned in two or three wildland 
Section VII:
Comprehensive Management Principles

fire use events. This has created a forest structure that 
is more characteristic of historical conditions. Managers 
here work closely with wildlife biologists and adjacent 
landowners to ensure that wildland fire use events do 
not threaten sensitive wildlife habitat or communities. 
Allowing natural fires to return to these ponderosa pine 
forests will allow the many plants and animals adapted 
to this system to thrive under current and future climatic 
conditions.
Planning Fuel Treatments Within a 
Broad Landscape Context
The degree to which fuels treatments and other veg-
etation conditions have influenced fire effects across 
landscapes is little understood, yet has tremendous im-
plications for the efficacy of fuels management designed 
to achieve multiple resource objectives, including the 
moderation of future fire effects. Planning fuel treatments 
on a landscape scale and across jurisdictions is needed 
because most wildfires dwarf the size of individual fuel 
treatment projects and don’t obey human defined bound-
aries. It will never be feasible to treat every square inch 
of fire-prone landscapes. Strategies should be developed 
to maximize benefit gained from fuel treatments, both in 
terms of reducing the threat of wildfire and improving 
ecological integrity. Fuel treatments can be strategically 
placed across landscapes so the historical heterogeneity 
in forest structure can also be recreated. Many studies 
(for example, Callaway and Davis 1993; Cram and others 
2006; Odion and others 2004) have found that patterns 
of fire effects (for example, severity) and post-fire veg-
etation recovery may be predisposed by topographical 
position and pre-fire vegetation structure. These studies 
suggest that, at the very least, forest managers should 
consider the spatial arrangement and size of harvest and 
other management units, as well as topographic charac-
teristics, when planning for fuel treatments and other fire 
mitigation measures.
Case Study
Managers with the Coronado National Forest are 
currently involved with multiple parties in a planning 
process that will strategically place fuel treatments 
across the landscape. This effort is in collaboration 
with managers from neighboring landowners, includ-
ing Department of the Defense, National Park Service, 
Nature Conservancy, Audubon Society, Bureau of Land 
Management, and Arizona State Parks. Collaborators 
are planning future fuel treatment projects to maximize 
benefit across jurisdictional boundaries. This approach 
has several other benefits: the costs per acre are kept 
low with broad-scale projects; natural and logical proj-
ect boundaries (rather than jurisdictional) can be used 
for fire management; staff and equipment are used more 
efficiently across agencies; monitoring efforts can be co-
ordinated; and a consistent message is delivered to the 
public.
Encouraging Innovative Approaches 
to Fuels Treatment
Many areas in ponderosa pine landscapes in most 
need of treatment are also the most difficult to treat be-
cause of topography or proximity to values at risk. While 
innovative approaches can be used to treat such areas, 
there often is no agency incentive for pursuing innova-
tive options. Innovative and perhaps somewhat risky 
approaches need to be attempted in order to learn what 
can effectively reduce the threat of severe wildfire in 
some landscapes. Managers should not be penalized for 
attempting innovative treatments or be held personally 
liable if such treatments fail. Encouraging innovation 
means using an adaptive management approach that al-
lows managers to try new approaches and learn from 
the experience. Restricting them to fuels treatments that 
are without risk stifles innovation. The probability of 
innovative treatments failing can be reduced by using 
experienced fire managers and resource specialists on 
the project team. Our conversations with managers re-
vealed that the most successful fuel treatment programs 
always had a cadre of experienced personnel participat-
ing in the planning and on-the-ground execution of fuel 
treatment projects. Their knowledge of local conditions 
and confidence in what could be done strongly influ-
enced the success of their programs.
Case Study
Managers on the Santa Fe National Forest advocate the 
pairing of very experienced fire managers with younger 
individuals in the field. The experienced managers often 
provide the detailed knowledge of a particular region 
and typical fire behavior in different circumstances in 
that locality. Working with younger members in the field 
ensures that this knowledge is passed to the next genera-
tion of fire managers. The working relationship is not a 
one way interaction, however. Younger managers often 
have the advantage of training in newer methods and 
models being used in the field of fire management. When 
this mix of expertise and new perspectives is combined, 
there is generally more confidence in the outcome and 
less aversion to the risks that are always associated with 

USDA Forest Service RMRS-GTR-198.  2007	
73
prescribed fire. While managers should always proceed 
with caution and be fully aware of the risks associated 
with their activities, they should focus on the importance 
of innovation in order to effectively achieve objectives.
Monitoring Treatment Effects and 
Effectiveness of Fuel Projects
Managers can not truly determine whether they are 
meeting management objectives with their treatments 
without monitoring their effectiveness. Quantitative data 
showing that treatments have been effective in meeting 
management objectives can serve to justify the need for 
more and similar treatments. Similarly, monitoring can 
document whether treatments are having adverse ef-
fects on other resource values such as wildlife habitat 
or biodiversity. Justification can be made for altering 
treatment prescriptions if monitoring data suggest that 
desired results are not being achieved. This allows man-
agers to work in an adaptive management framework. 
Monitoring should not be restricted to fire weather and 
behavior, but should document treatment effects on oth-
er resources and ecosystem values as well. Monitoring 
should not begin with the treatment action, but should 
first document pre-treatment conditions to serve a 
benchmark for anticipated outcomes. Responsibility 
for monitoring does not end with the final data collec-
tion. It should include archiving and cataloging results 
in a permanent database available and readable to future 
generations of fuel managers.
Case Study
The fire effects monitoring protocol developed by the 
National Park Service and FIREMON provide very ef-
fective monitoring protocols that can be easily adapted to 
monitor for a variety of treatment effects. The protocols 
describe in detail every step of the monitoring process, 
including developing monitoring objectives, random-
ization, plot layout, data collection, data archiving and 
analysis, and more. These protocols can also be adapted 
depending on the level of resources devoted to moni-
toring. FIREMON, in particular, provides strategies for 
adapting monitoring protocols based on the level of re-
sources available to conduct monitoring and the need for 
robust data. Both protocols also provide computer ap-
plications for archiving data that also include basic data 
analysis procedures.
The Collaborative Forest Restoration Program, a 
granting program that facilitates restoration projects on 
federal and tribal lands in New Mexico, requires moni-
toring be included in all proposed projects. To facilitate 
this process, the program members have developed pro-
tocols for monitoring a variety of ecological attributes. 
These protocols provide a common framework for mon-
itoring, ensure treatments have been effective in meeting 
objectives, and document any detrimental impacts on 
other resources. Recognizing that many managers of-
ten have limited time and resources to do monitoring, 
these protocols have been designed to be relatively easy 
to implement. The monitoring guide developed by the 
program is available at http://www.fs.fed.us/r3/spf/cfrp/ 
(accessed 06-21-07).
Collaboration with Other Resource 
Managers and Interested Parties to 
Improve Results
Fuel treatment projects that are multi-faceted will best 
meet the needs of sustaining forested ecosystems. To 
be effective in meeting multiple resource management 
objectives, managers should solicit input from resource 
specialists with expertise in varying fields and from 
other interested parties outside the management agency. 
Establishing relationships with managers and stakehold-
ers within and outside the agency, including the general 
public and non-profit organizations, can take a great 
deal of time and energy and reaching consensus can be 
difficult. However, we have noticed that managers who 
invested time in these relationships benefit immensely in 
the long run. With collaboration, fuel treatment projects 
are generally better in meeting multiple objectives and 
internal and external resistance to fuel treatments is less-
ened. Collaboration gives stakeholders ownership in the 
process and pride in the outcome.
Collaboration has a long history in fire management, 
evidenced by partnerships like the National Interagency 
Fire Center and the National Wildfire Coordinating 
Group. More recent policy directives (for example the 
National Fire Plan and Healthy Forest Restoration Act) 
have further emphasized the need for collaboration in 
fuel treatment projects, particularly on a local level. 
There are several benefits to collaborative efforts in the 
context of wildland fire. Collaboration tends to mobilize 
people to generate funds, allows for sharing of data and 
expertise, leads to a broader understanding of different 
attitudes and values toward natural resources, and al-
lows for increased efficiency and effectiveness of fuel 
treatments (Sturtevant and others 2005). Collaboration 
tends to be effective in relatively small groups of people. 
Collaboration is time consuming and can be difficult if 
there is a history of unresolved conflict, if partners are 
not willing to compromise, or if partners have no power 

74	
USDA Forest Service RMRS-GTR-198.  2007
to implement decisions. However, overcoming these ob-
stacles builds trust and ownership in the process and will 
inevitably lead to a successful outcome.
Case Study
Gila National Forest managers are developing strate-
gies for implementing fuel treatments on the Silver City 
Ranger District. Multiple stakeholders are involved in 
the process including environmental advocates, local 
government officials, commercial wood products us-
ers, and scientists. This collaborative process ensures 
that the concerns of all interested parties are addressed. 
Working together in this setting, members from dif-
ferent parties often gain a better understanding for the 
needs and concerns of other stakeholders and compro-
mises are more easily attained. In this case, we find 
that all collaborative partners understand the need to 
balance protection of communities, sensitive wildlife 
habitat, and important watersheds with other resource 
management needs and they work together to make 
sure these needs are met.
A number of excellent resources are available on es-
tablishing and maintaining collaborative relationships, 
including handbooks and guides specifically structured 
to the requirements and policies of Federal agencies. The 
following website has links to a number of publications 
and documents on collaboration and building partner-
ships. This website includes materials specific to fuels 
treatment projects and Forest Service agreements: http://
www.partnershipresourcecenter.org/resources
A particularly useful publication available at this site is 
the Partnership Guide, published jointly by the National 
Forest Foundation and USDA Forest Service National 
Partnership Office (National Forest Foundation and USDA 
Forest Service 2005). Yet another publication specific to 
building collaboration and preparing and implementing 
community wildfire protection plans is the handbook 
published by the Society of American Foresters, which 
can be found at: http://www.safnet.org/policyandpress/
cwpp.cfm.
We urge readers to use these resources to plan, build, 
and maintain collaborative relationships with stakehold-
ers that have an interest in fuels treatment activities. 
Our experiences in completing this document have con-
vinced us that including stakeholder ideas and input in 
a project and acknowledging their need for ownership 
in the decision-making process will ultimately ensure a 
successful outcome to any fuels treatment activity.
Conclusion
In our attempt to elucidate comprehensive manage-
ment practices for fuels treatments in ponderosa pine 
forests in the Black Hills, Front Range, and Southwest, 
we have combed all available published literature and 
have journeyed throughout the regions where these for-
ests grow to gather information from managers and fuels 
treatment practitioners. Our experiences have convinced 
us that while much is known, there is more to be learned. 
On the one hand, there are physical, biologic, regulatory, 
and societal limitations on what can be done to reduce 
the risk of catastrophic wildfire in these systems. On the 
other, there is innovation, collaboration, and a wealth of 
experience that can be drawn upon to find solutions to 
those limitations. What we have presented here is a static 
summary of existing knowledge. It is useful to a point – 
today. Management practices will, and should, evolve as 
we gain new knowledge in the future. Our efforts should 
therefore be viewed only as a beginning point in that 
continuum.

BehavePlus
BehavePlus uses inputs of fuel characteristics and 
weather and topography to predict surface fire and 
crown fire spread and intensity. This model has a 
variety of applications for wildland fire suppression 
and training. For prescribed fire, it is typically used 
to develop prescription windows that will result 
in desired fire behavior. This model is available to 
download at www.fire.org.
CONSUME
CONSUME is a model that predicts fuel consumption 
and emission based on fuel and weather conditions. 
This model is available to download at http://www.

The Rocky Mountain Research Station develops scientific 
information and technology to improve management, protection, 
and use of the forests and rangelands. Research is designed to 
meet the needs of the National Forest managers, Federal and State 
agencies, public and private organizations, academic institutions, 
industry, and individuals.
Studies accelerate solutions to problems involving ecosystems, 
range, forests, water, recreation, fire, resource inventory, land 
reclamation, 
community 
sustainability, 
forest 
engineering 
technology, multiple use economics, wildlife and fish habitat, and 
forest insects and diseases. Studies are conducted cooperatively, 
and applications may be found worldwide.
