1. Torrey Bot. Soc. 13I: 220-231. 2004.-Ecological species groups, consisting of assemblages of co-occurring 
plant species exhibiting similar environmental affinities, were developed for ground-flora and tree strata in late­
successional forests on a 13,000 ha southern Appalachian landscape. We distinguished I I ground-flora groups 
that included 50 species and six tree groups comprised of 19 species. Ground-flora groups ranged from a xeric 
Vaccinium group (including Vaccinium pal/idum, Euphorbia corollata, and Piptochaetium avenaceum) to a mesic 
Rhododendron group (typified by Rhododendron maximum, Mitchella repens, and Hexastylis heterophyl/a). Tree 
groups ranged from a Quercus coccinea group to a Tsuga canadensis group. Consistent with previous research, 
species groups exhibited a range of amplitudes from widely distributed Smilax and Vitis groups to a Sanguinaria 
group restricted to one ecosystem type. A given species group occupied a variety of different combinations of 
measured environmental variables, which apparently interacted to produce repeating environmental complexes 
across the landscape favorable for specific species groups. We also tested two multivariate methods for quanti­
fying associations among species groups, and found that Mantel tests using traditional distance measures were 
inappropriate because of the double-zero problem of species absences, whereas canonical correlation modeled 
species group associations consistent with species distributions among sites. This study is among the first to 
develop ecological species groups in the southern United States, and the species group approach was useful for 
explaining vegetation-environment relationships, identifying groups of ground-flora and tree species that varied 
together across the landscape, and for determining the environmental gradients most strongly associated with 
species distributions.

cated particular environmental complexes, with 
soil drainage, texture, and fertility able to be in­
ferred based on the abundance of different spe­
cies groups (Pregitzer and Barnes 1982). For ex­
ample, occurrences of an Osmunda group (Os­
munda cinnamomea L. and Oxalis montana 
Raf.) indicated a 90% probability of soil mot­
tling within the upper 40 ern (suggestive of a 
seasonally high water table), whereas occurrenc­
es of a Viola group indicated higher soil nitrogen 
and higher pH. While general habitat descrip­
tions are available for plants in such resources 
as state flora manuals (Radford et al. 1968), eco­
logical species group research provides specific 
data that are relatively rare for forest landscapes. 
Ecological species groups have not been de­
veloped in the southern Appalachians, and the 
objectives of this study were (1) to develop eco­
logical species groups as part of an ecosystem 
classification of a southern Appalachian land­
scape, and (2) to quantify associations among 
species groups by testing statistical methods new 
to ecological species group research. 
Methods. STUDY AREA. The 13,000 ha 10­
cassee Gorges, managed by the South Carolina 
Department of Natural Resources, is in north­
western South Carolina at the southern edge of 
the southern Appalachian Mountains (Fig. 1). 
Typical elevations in the study area ranged from 
350-850 m, and topography consisted of 
stream-dissected hillslopes. Common soils in­
cluded Typic Dystrochrepts and Humic and Typ­
ic Hap1udults (Byrd 1972). Presett1ement vege­
tation was dominated by Quercus-Castanea den­
tata (Marsh.) Borkh. forests, with Tsuga cana­
densis (L.) Carr. and mesic hardwood forests 
forming inclusions in riparian and topographi­
cally protected areas (Holmes 1911, Braun 
1950). In a recent ecosystem classification of the 
study area, we identified five major ecosystem 
types, distinguished by differences in geomor­
phology, soils, and late-successional vegetation 
(Abella et al. 2003). Xeric QuercuslVaccinium 
ecosystems occupied ridgetops and other dry 
sites, and were typified by Quercus coccinea 
Muenchh., Quercus velutina Lam., and Vaccin­
ium pallidum Ail. Xeric Quercus prinus/Kalmia 
ecosystems inhabited upper slope positions on 
north aspects or soils more rocky than the Quer­
cus/Vaccinium ecosystem. Submesic Quercus/ 
mixed flora ecosystems were typified by com­
binations of Quercus alba L., Carya alba (L.) 
Nutt. ex Ell., Magnolia fraseri Walt., and The­
lypteris noveboracensis (L.) Nieuwl. Although 
rare, mesic hardwoods/Sanguinaria ecosystems 
exhibited the highest ground-flora diversity and 
occupied the deepest soils (sola > 100 ern 
thick). Mesic Tsuga/Rhododendron ecosystems 
dominated riparian areas and were characterized 
by T. canadensis, Rhododendron maximum L., 
and Leucothoe fontanesiana (Steud.) Sleumer. 
FIELD PROCEDURES. To develop the ecosystem 
classification, we sampled vegetation, soils, and 
geomorphology on 48, 0.1 ha (20 X 50 m) plots 
distributed across the landscape in forests great­
er than age 70 yr following methods in Abella 
et al. (2003). A total of 28 soil and geomorphic 
variables were measured on each plot, and 
among the most important of these variables 
were landform index (McNab 1993) and the to­
pographic relative moisture index (Parker 1982). 
Landform index quantifies site protection by sur­
rounding topography, with higher indices indi­
cating greater topographic protection usually as­
sociated with moist sites. The topographic rela­
tive moisture index integrates slope aspect, slope 
gradient, slope shape, and topographic features 
and ranges from 0-100, with higher indices in­
dicating greater potential moisture availability. 
Soil variables determined for both A and B ho­
rizons included texture, organic C, pH, Munsell 
color, and horizon thickness. 
Each 0.1 ha plot was divided into ten 0.01 ha 
subplots for vegetation sampling, and we cate­
gorized the areal percent cover of each plant 
species rooted in each subplot using the cover 
classes of Peet et al. (1998): 1 = trace, 2 = 0­
1%, 3 = 1-2%, 4 ee 2-5%, 5 = 5-10%, 6 == 
10-25%, 7 == 25-50%, 8 == 50-75%, 9 == 75­

95%, 10 = > 95%. These measurements were 
made for all vascular plant species including tree 
species less than 1 em diameter at 1.4 rn: this 
stratum is termed ground-flora throughout this 
paper. Trees greater than 1 em diameter were 
inventoried by species and diameter on each 
plot, and are termed trees in this paper. Nomen­
clature follows Kartesz (1999). 
STATISTICAL ANALYSES. We developed eco­
logical species groups separately for ground-flo­
ra and tree strata in an R-mode analysis (Legen­
dre and Legendre 1998) using cluster analysis 
(Euclidean distance, Ward's linkage method) and 
non-metric multidimensional scaling (default 
settings, 50 randomized runs [McCune and Mef­
ford 1999)). Importance values for ground-flora 
([relative frequency + relative cover class]/2) 
and trees ([relative density + relative basal 
area]/2) were used in analyses. Following widely 
used procedures for developing ecological spe­
cies groups, raw plot X species and plot X en­
vironmental variable matrices were examined in 
combination with results of multivariate analy­
ses to develop species groups (Mueller-Dombois 
and Ellenberg 1974, Archambault et a1. 1989, 
Kashian et a1. 2003). Species that typically oc­
cupied the same plots and were abundant on 
similar environmental complexes were identified 
by their proximity on ordination diagrams, clus­
ter analysis groupings, and by examining spe­
cies-environment correlations in raw data matri­
ces. Fifty ground-flora species were included in 
11 ground-flora groups and 19 tree species were 
included in six tree species groups. While the 
number of species included in groups, the num­
ber of groups, and the assignment of species to 
groups in this study resulted in robust species 
groups, it should be recognized that different 
groups and numbers of groups equally logical 
could also result depending on such factors as 
the areal scale of analysis (smaller or larger than 
the 0.1 ha plot scale in this study), .measure of 
species quantity (presence/absence versus differ­
ent quantitative measures), and the environmen­
tal variables measured. 
We examined associations between species 
groups using Mantel tests (Mantel 1967) and ca­
nonical correlation (Gittins 1985, Tabachnick 
and Fidell 1996). Species group-species group 
associations have previously been described 
qualitatively (Host and Pregitzer 1991), and our 
goal in Mantel tests and canonical correlation 
was to test methods for quantifying species 
group associations. For Mantel tests, one mul­
tivariate distance matrix (48 plots X 48 plots) 
was computed for each species group using 
Serensen dissimilarity distances in PC-ORO 
(McCune and Mefford 1999). Distance matrices 
were compared between each pair of species 
groups with the standardized Mantel statistic (in­
terpretation similar to Pearson's r), and signifi­
cance of correlations was determined by per­
mutation (9999 permutations). Comparisons of 
ecological species group associations in this 
study are similar to comparisons using Mantel 
tests of plant taxonomic groups in Amazonian 
rain forests by Tuomisto et al. (1995), and to 
comparisons of plant life-form groups in Me­
Cune and Grace (2002). Canonical correlation 
quantifies the correlation between two sets of 
variables, with the sets of variables in this study 
consisting of the constituent species of two spe­
cies groups. Linear combinations (canonical var­
iates) of the variables of each set are calculated, 
and the association between the pairs of canon­
ical variates is the canonical correlation which 
ranges from -1 to +1 (Khattree and Naik 2000). 
We computed a matrix (69 X 69) of Spearman 
rank correlations between each pair of individual 
species and ran canonical correlation from this 
matrix for a partial nonparametric canonical cor­
relation. Only the first canonical variate was typ­
ically needed for interpretation, and for signifi­
cant associations we inspected species correla­
tions with each variate to determine positive or 
negative association among species groups. 
Relationships among species groups and en­
vironmental variables were investigated using 
point-biserial correlation, a method that corre­
lates a binary variable with a continuous vari­
able. Kent and Coker (1992) note that point-bis­
erial correlation has been rarely used in vege­
tation studies, but the method is useful when 
there are many zeros in a data set resulting from 
species absences typical of vegetation data. In 
this study, the binary variable was an abovelbe­
low the median importance value division for 
each species group, and the continuous variable 
was an environmental variable. Importance val­
ues of constituent species of a species group 
were averaged for each plot for these analyses. 
Results and Discussion. GROUND-FLORA SPE­
CIES GROUPS. We distinguished 11 ground-flora 
species groups, with each group consisting of 
species exhibiting similar distributions among 
ecosystems (Table 1). Groups ranged from a xe­
ric Vaccinium group exemplified by V. pallidum 
and Piptochaetium avenaceum (L.) Parodi, to a

mesic Rhododendron group typified by R. max­
imum and Mitchella repens L. The Arundinaria 
group consisted of species such as A. gigantea 
(Walt.) Muhl. and Chimaphila maculata (L.) 
Pursh that were widespread but most common 
in xeric ecosystems. Dominating the xeric Quer­
cus prinusiKalmia ecosystem, species like Kal­
mia latifolia L. and Gaylussacia ursina (M.A. 
Curtis) Torr. & Gray ex Gray of the Kalmia 
group also were common in the xeric Quercus/ 
Vaccinium and submesic Quercus/mixed flora 
ecosystems. Acer rubrum L. and species of the 
Smilax group were common in ali ecosystems, 
but this group was less common in the mesic 
Tsuga/Rhododendron ecosystem. The Vitis 
group, typified by V. rotundifolia Michx. and 
Goodyera pubescens (Willd.) R. Br. ex Ait. f., 
exhibited little environmental preference. 
Thelypteris noveboracensis, Halesia carolina 
L., and other species of the Thelypteris group 
were sparse in xeric ecosystems and most dom­
inant in the submesic Quercus/mixed flora and 
mesic hardwoods/Sanguinaria ecosystems. The 
Polystichum group, characterized by such spe­
cies as Polystichum acrostichoides (Michx.) 
Schott and Euonymus americana L., was widely 
distributed but dominant only in submesic-mesic 
ecosystems. Sanguinaria canadensis L., Caulo­
phyllum thalictroides (L.) Michx., and Panax 
quinquefolius L. comprising the Sanguinaria 
group exhibited the narrowest distribution and 
were largely restricted to the mesic hardwoods/ 
Sanguinaria ecosystem. Species of the Tiarella 
group, such as Tiarella cordifolia L. and Med­
eola virginiana L., were abundant in submesic 
and mesic ecosystems but most dominant in the 
mesic hardwoods/San!?uinaria ecosystem. Mem­
bers of the Rhododendron group, like Leucothoe 
fontanesiana, Hexastylis heterophylla (Ashe) 
Small, Hexastylis shuttleworthii (Britten & Bak­
er) Small, and Tsuga canadensis seedlings, were 
sparse in xeric ecosystems and dominated the 
mesic TsugalRhododendron ecosystem. 
With the exception of the Sanguinaria group 
restricted to the mesic hardwoods/Sanguinaria 
ecosystem, species groups occurred in multiple 
ecosystems but were typically quantitatively 
most important in three or fewer ecosystems 
(Table I). These results support the conclusions 
of species group studies in Michigan. For ex­
ample, Archambault et aJ. (1989) found that a 
Thalictrum group (dominated by Thalictrum 
dioicum L., Viola pubescens, and Viburnum ac­
erifolium L.) occurred in several southeastern 
Michigan Quercus ecosystems, but was most 
common in an ecosystem with moist, loamy 
soils containing Quercus rubra L. Likewise, 
Host and Pregitzer (1991) classified nine species 
groups in upland ecosystems of northwestern 
lower Michigan and reported a range of group 
amplitudes from a specific Osmorhiza group 
(constituents included Osmorhiza claytonii 
(Michx.) C.B. Clarke and Viola canadensis L.), 
to a broad Viburnum group (V. acerifolium, Ara­
lia nudicaulis L., and Mitchella repensy. 
TREE SPECIES GROUPS. We formed six groups 
of tree species (> 1 em diameter) comprised of 
19 of the 35 tree species recorded in this study 
(Table 2). Similar to the ground-flora groups, 
tree groups did not exclusively occur in one eco­
system but all groups were quantitatively most 
dominant in fewer than three ecosystems. Quer­
cus coccinea, Q. velutina, and Nyssa sylvatica 
Marsh. of the Quercus coccinea group, for ex­
ample, totaled a mean importance value of 31 in 
the xeric QuercuslYaccinium ecosystem and 
never totaled an importance value more than 
eight in any other ecosystem. Quercus prinus L. 
dominated the xeric Quercus prinustKalmia eco­
system and also was common in the xeric Quer­
cusiYaccinium and submesic ecosystems. The 
distribution of the Quercus alba group (includ­
ing Carya and Magnolia fraserii was difficult to 
characterize, although this group was most 
abundant in the submesic Quercus/mixed flora 
ecosystem. Liriodendron tulipifera L., Halesia 
carolina, and Quercus rubra of the Lirioden­
dron tulipifera group dominated the mesic hard­
woods/Sanguinaria ecosystem, totaling a mean 
importance value of 46. The Tsuga canadensis 
group was diverse and most dominant in the me­
sic TsugafRhododendron ecosystem. 
AsSOCIATIONS WTIll ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLFS. 
Based on point-biserial correlation, landform and 
soil thickness variables were more closely associ­
ated with species group distribution than were slope 
aspect, soil texture, pH, and organic C. Little 
correlation between species groups and soil tex­
ture, pH, and organic C in this study contrasts 
sharply with the results of Michigan studies, 
where these soil variables have formed dominant 
gradients associated with species group distri­
bution (Pregitzer and Barnes 1982, Spies and 
Barnes 1985, Archambault et al. 1989). When 
environmental variables were partitioned into

sions for species groups, landform index (mea­
sures site protection), A-horizon thickness, and 
the topographic relative moisture index were

lower when xeric groups such as the Vaccinium 
group were above their median importance (Fig. 
2). In contrast, mesic groups such as the San­
guinaria group were more prevalent at higher 
landform indices (greater site protection), thick­
er A horizons, and larger moisture indices (high­
er potential moisture). 
Species groups generally were not associated 
with one specific landform or soil characteristic 
(Table 3). With the exception of a Widespread 
Vitis group not associated with any environmen­
tal complex, a given species group occurred on 
different combinations of environmental vari­
ables that apparently interacted to produce an 
environmental complex favorable for that group. 
For example, the Vaccinium group dominated 
xeric sites, but these xeric sites could occur on 
a south-facing upper hillsJope or on a dry, con­
vex nose slope embedded on a predominately 
moist north aspect. Tree species groups also oc­
cupied different combinations of environmental 
variables, and were as specific or more specific 
than ground-flora groups in their requirements of 
environmental complexes. There was no wide­
spread tree group uncharacteristic of any envi­
ronmental complex equivalent to the non-pref­
erential Vitis ground-flora group. Trees have tra­
ditionally not been included in species group re­
search, probably partly because fewer tree 
species occur on many northern landscapes 
where most species group research has occurred 
(Kashian et al. 2003), and it is thought that trees 
do not reflect site conditions as specifically as 
ground-flora. In late-successional forests with 
diverse tree composition such as in the southern 
Appalachians, however, forming tree species 
groups is likely to be useful for understanding 
vegetation-environment relationships for differ­
ent forest strata. A practical application of tree 
groups could be to develop species groups along 
successional sequences to predict how species­
environment relationships change on different 
environmental sites after disturbance, or whether 
characteristic species groups occur at different 
times after different types of disturbance. 
ASSOCIATIONS AMONG SPECIES GROUPS. Rela­
tionships among species groups typically are de­
scribed only qualitatively in species group re­
search (e.g., Host and Pregitzer 1991). Many 
other types of ecological research also require 
descriptions of associations among different 
groups of species, and we tested Mantel tests for 
their ability to quantify species group associa­
tions. Mantel tests previously have been used to 
examine associations among plant taxonomic 
groups (Tuomisto et al. 1995) and plant growth 
forms (McCune and Grace 2002). We tabulated 
results of Mantel tests for quantifying ecological 
species group associations in this study in a 17

x 17 group association matrix corresponding to 
the 11 ground-flora and six tree groups. How­
ever, species groups that never occurred together 
ecologically were consistently determined by the 
Mantel test to be positively associated. For ex­
ample, the xeric Vaccinium group was most pos­
itively associated with the mesic Tiarella group 
(r = 0.41, P < 0.0001) even though these 
groups did not exhibit distributional overlap (Ta­
ble I). This discrepancy occured because of the 
double-zero problem described by Legendre and 
Legendre (1998), where species absences are 
weighted the same as species occurrences. Con­
sider a hypothetical example of two plots on xe­
ric ridgetops, with both plots containing species 
of the xeric Vaccinium group and consequently 
exhibiting high similarity in the multivariate dis­
tance matrix computed using the Vaccinium 
group. Species of the mesic Tiarella group do 
not occur on these xeric plots, but in the distance 
matrix computed from the Tiarella group these 
plots would be similar only because the plots 
share no species. Because of these shared zeros, 
the Vaccinium and Tiarella groups exhibit pos­
itive association in a Mantel test. Unless this 
double-zero problem is accounted for in the dis­
tance measure used to compute the distance ma­
trix, Mantel tests incorrectly return positive as­
sociation when no association or negative asso­
ciation should occur. Mantel tests can use any 
distance measure (McCune and Grace 2002), 
and experimentation is needed to evaluate meth­
ods to account for the double-zero problem if 
Mantel tests are to be used to quantify species 
group associations. 
In contrast to Mantel tests that are based on 
multivariate plot dissimilarities, canonical cor­
relation directly quantifies the association be­
tween combinations of two sets of variables 
such as groups of species (Gittins 1985, Ta­
bachnick and Fidell 1996). Results suggest ca­
nonical correlation modeled species group as­
sociations consistent with abundances of species 
among sites (Table 4). Rather than being the

most positively associated with the mesic Ti­
arella group determined by the Mantel test, for 
example, the xeric Vaccinium group was nega­
tively associated with the Tiarella group in ca­
nonical correlation analyses. Related groups 
such as the mesic Polystichum and Rhododen­
dron groups were positively associated, but neg­
atively associated with xeric groups such as the 
Vaccinium and Arundinaria groups. Even the 
widespread Smilax group was positively associ­
ated with xeric groups and negatively associated 
with mesic groups, reflecting the subtle greater 
quantitative importance of the Smilax group in 
xeric ecosystems. Establishing association of the 
Sanguinaria and Adiantum groups with other 
groups was difficult because of the limited dis­
tribution and many zeros (absences) of these 
groups. 
The Quercus coccinea and Oxydendrum ar­
boreum tree groups were most positively asso­
ciated with the Vaccinium, Arundinaria, Kalmia, 
and Smilax ground-flora groups, and were neg­
atively associated with mesic groups such as the 
Tiarella group (Table 4). In contrast, the Tsuga 
canadensis tree group was most positively as­
sociated with the Rhododendron ground-flora 
group and most negatively associated with the 
xeric Vaccinium and Arundinaria groups. Like­
wise, several tree species groups were positively 
or negatively associated with other tree groups. 
The Quercus coccinea group, for example, co­
occurred with the Oxydendrum arboreum group 
but was negatively associated with the Tsuga 
canadensis group. Canonical correlation was 
useful for identifying assemblages of ground­
flora and tree groups that varied together across 
the landscape. 
SPECIES GROUPS AND DISTURBANCE REGIMES. 
While species groups have been developed for 
a mix of late- and early successional forests (Ar­
chambault et aI. 1989, Meilleur et al. 1992), lit­
tle attention has been given to how the environ­
mental relationships and composition of species 
groups may change in older forests in the ab­
sence of disturbance. Appalachian Quercus for­
ests, for example, generally experienced reduc­
tions of historic fire frequencies through the 
1900s (Brose et al. 200 I). An absence of fire is 
expected to continue in many Quercus forests, 
and this may result in changes in the xeric Vac­
cinium, Kalmia, Q. coccinea, and other species 
groups classified in this study associated with 
Quercus forests. During this changing distur­
bance regime, Pinus strobus L., for example, has 
expanded its distribution from mesic sites to xe­
ric Quercus sites in southern Appalachian for­
ests (Abella and Shelburne 2003). While P. stro­
bus was classified into a mesic species group in 
this study, P. strobus might be more appropri­
ately classified into one of the xeric species 
groups in 20-30 years if the distribution and site 
relationships of this species continue to shift. 
Likewise, species of the Vaccinium group nor­
mally associated with open, fire-prone sites 
might exhibit a more restricted distribution con­
fined to the most xeric sites of the landscape. 
While numerous authors have stressed that spe­
cies groups developed on a study area should 
not be extrapolated far geographically because 
of variations in species-site relationships within 
a region (Pregitzer and Barnes 1982, Kashian et 
al. 2003), attention should also focus on how 
long species groups remain temporally robust 
during successional changes in undisturbed for­
ests.
