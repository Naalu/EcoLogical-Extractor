ABSTRACT.  We tested the effectiveness of ponderosa pine forest restoration by comparing
forest restoration treatments to untreated forest and to reconstructed forest structure in 1870
(date of Euro-American settlement) using an experimental block design at the Grand Canyon-
Parashant National Monument in northwestern Arizona. Forest tree density averaged more
than 20 times the historical tree density, and basal area was 4 to 6 times higher in contemporary
forests than in historical forests. Restoration treatments consisted of thinning young trees to
emulate the forest density, tree composition, and spatial distribution in 1870, followed by
prescribed burning. Following restoration treatment, tree density was significantly reduced
but remained 6 times higher than historical forests. Basal area in restored forests was still 2.5
times greater than reconstructed basal area values. Ponderosa pine dominance changed little
from pretreatment data across the four blocks, averaging 60% of stems and 87% of the basal
area prior to treatment and 56% of stems and 85% of the basal area following treatment.
Ninety-eight percent of contemporary forest trees were less than 100 yr old prior to restoration
treatment; this proportion was reduced to 82% following treatment. Restoration treatment also
significantly reduced canopy cover and increased total tree regeneration. However, treatment
effects on forest fuels were highly variable. Litter and duff fuel layers were significantly
reduced by prescribed fire but woody debris increased. Overall forest structural diversity
following treatment implies that fire behavior, wildlife habitats, and other ecological attributes
will vary relatively widely in the future landscape. FOR. SCI. 49(6):885–900.

EW LANDSCAPE-LEVEL RESTORATION PROJECTS can test
the effectiveness of treatments because these
projects are difficult to replicate or implement with
appropriate statistical design (Hurlbert 1984, Michener
1997, Block et al. 2001). We designed a ponderosa pine
restoration project with replicated experimental blocks to
examine treatments with greater statistical inference. This
research design provides both the size (16–40 ha units)
and replication (n = 4) needed to assess the impacts of
treatments on several ecosystem variables through time
(Eberhardt and Thomas 1991). In this article, we specifi-
cally examined changes in forest structural attributes 1 yr
following restoration treatments at Mt. Trumbull in the
Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument, northwest-

886

ern Arizona, and compared these conditions to historical
forest structure.
Restoration treatments are designed to emulate reference
conditions, based on the range of natural (or “historical”)
variability (Aronson et al. 1993, Landres et al. 1999). When
existing reference systems are not available, historical records,
surveys, or paleoecological techniques can be used to esti-
mate reference conditions for certain ecosystem attributes
(Swetnam et al. 1999, Minnich et al. 2000). Although it is
difficult to find undisturbed forests in the U.S. Southwest,
reference conditions for forest structural attributes are uniquely
available because of the relatively recent time of Euro-
American settlement (less than 150 yr ago) combined with
the low rates of woody material decay (Jenny et al. 1949).
Ponderosa pine forest structural changes through time have
been assessed using dendrochronological techniques across
the Southwest by various authors (White 1985, Covington
and Moore 1994, Fulé et al. 1997). These data and evidence
from relict sites, historical records, and photographs facili-
tate the development of site-specific reference conditions
that provide a broad range of historical variability in tree
densities, tree composition, and tree age structure (Covington
et al. 1994, Moore et al. 1999, Allen 2002, Fulé et al. 2002a).
Forest structural changes occurred across the arid South-
west as a result of early land use policies associated with
Euro-American settlement. For example, at Mt. Trumbull,
Euro-American settlers from southern Utah began to utilize
the area for grazing and logging purposes in 1870 (Altschul
and Fairley 1989). Fire records from fire-scarred trees sug-
gest frequent fires crossed the landscape every 4 to 7 yr until
1870 (Fulé, unpublished data). In many areas of the South-
west, large herds of introduced livestock eliminated the fine
fuels (grasses and forbs) that carried frequent surface fires
(Weaver 1951, Cooper 1960, Swetnam and Baisan 1996).
Along with the cessation of fire, continued grazing and
removal of old-growth trees facilitated ponderosa pine tree
irruptions (Cooper 1960, White 1985, Savage et al. 1996).
These ecosystem structural changes have reduced under-
story biodiversity and altered important ecosystem func-
tions, such as decomposition, regeneration of trees, shrubs,
and herbaceous plants, and nutrient cycling (Covington et al.
1997). In addition, changes in tree densities have altered fire
regimes from frequent, low-intensity understory fires to
infrequent, stand-replacing fires. The total acreage burned by
wildfires in ponderosa pine forests increased exponentially
from 12,000 ac per year in the 1940s to over 300,000 per year
in the 1990s (Ellington 2001). Although ecological changes
alone warrant experimentation with restoration treatments,
the threat of uncontrollable wildfires to western communities
and private property combined with the ballooning cost of
fire fighting has also created a political impetus for restora-
tion treatments (Appropriations Bill 2001).
 Experimentation with re-introduction of surface fire sug-
gests that this process alone is not enough to restore pre-1870
ecosystem function, and may further damage the remaining
old-growth trees (Harrington and Sackett 1992, Sackett et al.
1996). Restoration treatments incorporating overstory tree
thinning and returning fire to the land have been experimen-
tally implemented on small scales (Covington et al. 1997,
Lynch et al. 2000), but the Mt. Trumbull restoration project
is the first to examine forest structure, understory re-estab-
lishment and other ecosystem responses on a landscape scale
to thinning and burning treatments. Landscape-level experi-
ments with replications, such as this study, are needed to
provide land managers scientifically based land management
alternatives (Eberhardt and Thomas 1991, Michner 1997).
Four experimental blocks were established in 1997. We
compared forest structure as reconstructed to the time of fire
exclusion (1870), to contemporary stand structure prior to
any treatments (1997-1998), and finally to posttreatment
stand structure (2000). To examine forest structural changes
between pre-1870, contemporary, and restored forests, we
asked: (1) How did forest structure, including tree density,
composition, and basal area, change following fire cessation
associated with the introduction of grazing and logging? (2)
Did ponderosa pine restoration treatments return forest struc-
ture to pre-1870 conditions? (3) What effects did restoration
treatments have on forest age structure, tree regeneration,
canopy cover, and forest fuels? (4) What are the implications
of forest structural diversity following treatment?
Methods
Study Site
 The study site was a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)
and Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) forest near Mt. Trumbull
in the Uinkaret Mountains, about 35 km north of the Grand
Canyon on the Arizona Strip (northwestern Arizona north of
the Colorado River). The site is managed by the Bureau of
Land Management (BLM) in the Grand Canyon-Parashant
National Monument. Elevation of the site ranged from 1,675
m to 2,620 m. The area received an average of 40–45 cm of
rainfall per year, and contained some of the biota of the Great
Basin (Welsh et al. 1993), in addition to the flora of northern
Arizona (Kearney and Peebles 1951). The forest was pre-
dominantly ponderosa pine, although Gambel oak composed
15% of the overstory (Waltz and Fulé 1998). Other tree
species in the area included New Mexico locust (Robinia
neomexicana), quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), pinyon
(Pinus edulis) and Utah juniper (Juniperus osteospermus).
The understory plant community was dominated by big
sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) and showed evidence of
invasion by nonnative species such as cheatgrass (Bromus
tectorum). Although over 300 herbaceous species were docu-
mented at the Mt. Trumbull site in the last 5 yr (J.D. Springer,
pers. comm.), the forest floor cover prior to restoration
treatments was 70% litter and duff, with only 15% of the
cover represented by live plants (Waltz and Fulé 1998).
Four experimental blocks were established (Figure 1).
The sites were chosen to block for landscape heterogeneity,
located in areas representing the diversity in vegetation,
topography and land-use history. Each block was divided
into two equal units, randomly assigned to control or restora-
tion treatment. The four experimental blocks varied in soil
type, forest density, forest composition and herbaceous cover.
Block 1 (EB1) was located on shallow lava/cinder soils with
low tree density. Tree composition consisted almost entirely

Forest Science 49(6) 2003
887
of ponderosa pine, with many living pre-1870 trees. This
block had the highest shrub density, composed of primarily
serviceberry and wax currant. Block 2 (EB2) had dense
Gambel oak and an abundant herbaceous understory, includ-
ing sagebrush openings, on basalt soils, representing the
eastern portion of the research site. At the highest elevation,
Block 3 (EB3) was dominated by large, pre-1870 ponderosa
pine, but also had Gambel oak and New Mexican locust
throughout the unit. This block was the largest (∼ 40 ha) and
was predominantly on cinder soils. Block 4 (EB4) repre-
sented the densest stands of ponderosa pine forest at Mt.
Trumbull. It consisted of dense ponderosa poles, some oak
clumps, and some pinyon and juniper at its western end. This
block was on basalt soils and had few living pre-1870
ponderosa pines.
Experimental Block Monitoring Plots
Experimental blocks differed in size (~16 to 40 ha) but
monitoring plots were established on a consistent 7.2 ha grid
in each unit. In 1997 and 1998, 20 monitoring plots in each
treatment unit (total 40 plots per block) were established and
sampled in all 4 experimental blocks. Plot centers were
located on a 60 m grid. The standard monitoring plot was a
0.04 ha circle (diameter = 22.56 m), with a permanent iron
center marker to serve as a long-term monitoring unit. Plots
were corrected for slope in the field.
All trees greater than breast height (1.37 m) were mea-
sured on the entire plot (400 m2). Each tree was tagged with
an aluminum label at breast height (1.37) and the following
data were recorded: diameter at breast height, crown code
(dominant, codominant, intermediate, or subcanopy), dam-
Figure 1.  Map of Mt. Trumbull forest restoration project, within the Grand Canyon-Parashant National
Monument. Experimental blocks (EBs) 1–4 were established in 1997–1998, adjacent to an ongoing
landscape-level restoration experiment. Blocks were divided and each half randomly assigned the
control or treatment unit. The 1997–1998 Control unit of EB3 was lost to wildfire in spring 2000, so EB3
Control 2000 was established May 2000 to serve as a new control for the treatment unit.

age, and condition class [(1) live; (2) declining; (3) recent
snag; (4) loose bark snag; (5) clean snag; (6) snag broken
above breast height; (7) snag broken below breast height; (8)
downed dead tree; (9) cut stump; and (10) stump hole]. The
condition class categories were derived from snag decompo-
sition studies (Thomas et al. 1979). All living and dead trees
potentially old and/or large enough to have become estab-
lished prior to 1870 were identified as potentially pre-1870
trees in the field. Ponderosa pines with dbh > 37.5 cm or
ponderosa of any size with yellowed bark (White 1985), as
well as all oaks, junipers, and pinyon trees > 17 cm at dbh
(Barger and Ffolliott 1972) were considered potentially pre-
1870 trees. All living potentially pre-1870 trees and a random
10% of all postsettlement live trees were cored for determi-
nation of age and past size. Overstory canopy cover was
measured every 30 cm along one 50 m transect by the point
intercept method (Ganey and Block 1994).
Tree regeneration, defined as trees below breast height
(1.37 m), were tallied by species, condition, and height class
in a nested 100 m2 circular plot (radius = 5.64 m). Species,
condition, and height class ( <40 cm;  40.1–80 cm; 80.1–137
cm) were recorded for each seedling. Fuel loadings were
calculated along a 15.2 m planar transect using methods in
Brown (1974) and constants from Sackett (1980).
Restoration Treatments
Thinning treatments were implemented in 1999 and 2000.
The thinning design was based on the pre-1870 pattern of tree
species composition and spatial arrangement (Covington et
al. 1997, Mast et al. 1999). Living pre-1870 trees of all
species were retained. In addition, wherever evidence of
remnant pre-1870 material was encountered (snags, stumps,
logs), several of the largest post-1870 trees of the same
species within 9.1 m were retained as replacements. If suit-
able trees were not found within 9.1 m, the search radius was
extended to 18.2 m. Each remnant was replaced with 1.5 trees
(i.e., 3 replacements per every 2 remnants) if the replace-
ments were 40.6 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) or larger,
otherwise each remnant was replaced with 3 trees. This
procedure was intended to leave 150–300% more trees than
in 1870, to account for the smaller biomass contributed by
smaller diameter trees, potential errors in reconstructions,
and to allow for un-predicted mortality due to restoration
treatments. Accumulated forest floor fuels were raked ap-
proximately 30 cm away from the base of the boles of old-
growth trees in order to minimize cambial girdling by fire
(Sackett et al. 1996).
Although thinning followed the same design across blocks,
operational differences resulted in treatment differences in
each of the blocks. Block 1 had low tree densities (around 550
trees/ha), allowing thinning to be done entirely with hand
tools (chainsaws) by a BLM crew in the spring of 1999.
Felled wood was left on site, slash, litter and duff were
removed from around the base of old-growth trees, and the
site was burned in the fall of 1999. Blocks 2 and 3 were
thinned by a commercial operator as part of a timber sale.
Logs greater than 12.4 cm dbh were removed from the site as
merchantable wood. Smaller trees were thinned by the BLM
crew. Blocks 2 and 3 were both burned in the spring of 2000.
In April 2000, a smoking stump in an adjacent prescribed
burn ignited a wildfire in the control unit of EB3. The intense
wildfire eliminated the unit as a valid untreated control for the
block. In the summer of 2000 we initiated a new paired
control (Figure 1; referred to as “EB 3 Control 2000” through-
out text, tables and figures). No pretreatment data (1997–
1998) were available for the control 2000, but tree densities
and the herbaceous community were similar to the block 3
treatment unit prior to treatment.
Block 4 had the highest tree density (~2500 trees/ha) and
accessibility difficulties that created operational problems
with the treatment implementation. Trees were hand-felled,
and the majority of the wood was cut and left on site. With
such high tree densities, trees were not thinned to the marked
prescription, but rather to a fuel loading maximum. The
resulting residual stand following thinning treatments was
denser than intended. A number of the remaining trees were
killed during the prescribed burn in spring 2000.
Plot Remeasurement
All plot measurements were resampled the season follow-
ing prescribed burn (2000). Tree tags and original maps were
used to relocate and retag trees, if necessary. Tree
remeasurements included tree condition, scorch, and char
heights. A new condition class was established for trees
consumed by fire (cond. 11) and trees previously dead (cond.
3 or above in 1998), that were unable to be relocated (cond.
12). No tree diameters were remeasured because of minimal
growth changes from year to year, although negative growth
was possible as a result of fire-caused bark loss. We also
sampled tree regeneration, forest fuels, and canopy cover.
In EB 1, six control plots were burned when a burning snag
fell across fire lines into the control area. No trees were lost
to fire, but because the low intensity burn altered forest fuels
and understory, these plots were excluded from posttreat-
ment fuel loading statistical comparisons. Block 2 control
also had one plot lost to fire from an adjacent unit which was
also excluded from fuel analyses.
Analysis
Tree increment cores were surfaced and cross-dated (Stokes
and Smiley 1968) with local tree-ring chronologies. Rings
were counted on cores that could not be cross-dated, usually
on young trees. Additional years to the center were estimated
with a pith locator (concentric circles matched to the curva-
ture and density of the inner rings) for cores that missed the
pith. The field determination of pre-1870 or post-1870 tree
status was confirmed or rejected using the age data. Ten out
of 1,211 trees (0.8%) that were designated as post-1870 in the
field actually predated 1870.
Forest structure was reconstructed in 1870 following
dendroecological methods described in detail by Fulé et
al. (1997) and Mast et al. (1999). Briefly, size at the time
of fire exclusion was reconstructed for all living trees by
subtracting the radial growth measured on increment cores
since fire exclusion. For dead trees, the date of death was
estimated based on tree condition class using diameter-
dependent snag decomposition rates (Thomas et al. 1979).
To estimate growth between the fire exclusion date and
death date, we developed local species- and site-specific

Forest Science 49(6) 2003

predictive regression relationships between diameter and
basal area increment for pre-1870 ponderosa pine, Gambel
oak, and pinyon trees. For Utah juniper, published diam-
eter-dependent growth regression equations were applied
to determine pre-1870 diameter (Barger and Ffolliott 1972).
An analogous process of growth estimation was used to
estimate the past diameter of the small proportion of living
pre-1870 trees for which an intact increment core could
not be extracted due to rot. New Mexico locust, a short-
lived species, was not suitable for reconstruction. Accu-
racy of the dendroecological reconstruction techniques is
discussed below (see Structural Changes since 1870).
The harvest date at Mt. Trumbull for large stumps
(diameter ≥40 cm) was assumed to be 1885, corresponding
to the historic timber cutting period in the Mt. Trumbull
area (Altschul and Fairley 1989). The date for smaller
stumps was assumed to be 1974, corresponding to more
recent thinning under Forest Service and BLM manage-
ment.
This experimental design allowed us to use each block
as a replicate, with a total sample size (n) of 4. We used an
alpha level of 0.10 to denote significant differences be-
cause of the small sample size. Comparisons of forest
structural attributes (tree density and tree basal area)
between 1870 forests and contemporary forests (1998)
were analyzed with a blocked 2-way ANOVA. Recon-
structed forests were not independent of contemporary
forests, as reconstructions were accomplished using the
same forest plots that measured contemporary plots. The
2-way ANOVA used for such paired comparisons is iden-
tical to a paired t-test, but it allows additional evaluation
of the variability within the blocking factor (Sokal and
Rohlf 1994). To determine any pretreatment differences
between control and treatment units, within year (1870
and 1998) differences between control and treatment units
within blocks were examined with a 2-way ANOVA. The
effects of the restoration treatment were analyzed within
treatment year 2000 with a 2-way ANOVA. Finally, post-
treatment (2000) forest structural variables were com-
pared to pre-1870 forest variables to assess the effective-
ness of restoration treatments with a 2-way ANOVA.
Canopy cover was analyzed for differences between con-
trol and treatment units in contemporary forests pretreatment
(1997–1998) and posttreatment (2000) with a 2-way ANOVA.
Tree regeneration was variable among species within blocks,
due to differences in tree composition. Total tree regenera-
tion was analyzed with a Wilcoxin signed ranks test for
differences between control and treated units prior to (1997–
1998) and after (2000) restoration treatment. Ponderosa pine
was the only tree species occurring in all four blocks, so
regeneration of this species was specifically examined for
differences between control and treated forests with a Wilcoxin
signed ranks test.
Fuel loadings were separated into forest floor depths by
litter and duff, and woody fuel loadings by size classes. Litter
and duff depths were analyzed for differences between con-
trol and treatment units before (1997–1998) and after (2000)
restoration treatments with a MANOVA, followed by
univariate tests. The larger size classes of woody fuel were
analyzed with a MANOVA, before and after restoration
treatments. The variability between blocks may have masked
patterns occurring within blocks. Therefore, all data were
additionally presented on a per-block basis in tables and
figures, to help clarify initial patterns.
Results
Pre-1870 and Contemporary Forest
Structure —Changes Through Time
Forest structure at the time of the last widespread fire
(circa 1870) was relatively open (61.5 trees/ha) and was
significantly less dense than contemporary forests at the time
of our initial survey (~1,370 trees/ha in 1997–1998, Figure 2,
2-way ANOVA F = 38.5, P < 0.001, n = 4). Basal area values
significantly increased 400%—600% from the reconstructed
1870 forest to the 1998 survey (Table 1, 2-way ANOVA F =
81.2, P < 0.001, n = 4). Pre-1870 basal area ranged from 4 to
13 m2/ha. There were no significant differences in tree
density or basal area between control and treatment units in
reconstructed 1870 forest data (tree density 2-way ANOVA
F = 0.19, P = 0.694; basal area 2-way ANOVA F = 0.29, P =
0.630), suggesting that the treatment units within blocks were
similar prior to fire suppression.
Species composition in the 1870 forest was similar to the
contemporary forest in three of the four blocks. However, in
the 1870 stand of EB4, Juniperus osteosperma contributed
one-third of the stand basal area and almost half the stems
across both the control and treatment units (Tables 1 and 2).
These data suggest that this block changed from a ponderosa/
juniper ecotone in 1870 to an almost pure ponderosa pine
forest by 1998. The ratio of oak:pine stems stayed similar
over time across the experimental blocks, as both species
increased since fire exclusion. Other compositional change
observed in all blocks included the general increase in the
deciduous tree, Robinia neomexicana. This tree is an excel-
lent sprouter and in the absence of fire can develop clumped
stands (Gottfried 1980).
Restoration Treatment Effects on Forest Structure
Thinning significantly reduced contemporary tree density
by an average of 77%, ranging from 68% of stems removed
in EB2 to 85% of stems removed in EB3 (Figure 2, year
2000). Basal area was decreased by 48% on average, with a
range of 35% removed in EB1 to 58% removed in EB3 (Table
1, year 2000). However, posttreatment tree density and basal
area were still 6 times and 2.5 times significantly greater,
respectively, than the pre-1870 reconstructed tree density
and basal area (Figure 2, trees/ha 2-way ANOVA F = 12.5,
P = 0.038; Table 1, basal area 2-way ANOVA F = 22.0, P =
0.018). The treated blocks had between 2 and 15 times as
many tree stems as the reconstructed, pre-1870 stands.
Tree species composition appeared to change little from
pre-1870 and 1997-98 composition proportions following
restoration treatment (Figure 2), although this was not tested
statistically due to high variability among blocks. The treat-
ment removed only ponderosa pine trees. However, nonpine
tree mortality did occur with the prescribed fire. Gambel oak
and New Mexico locust displayed opposite trends following

890
Forest Science 49(6) 2003
restoration treatments: Gambel oak showed increasing pro-
portions, while New Mexico locust appeared to decrease
following thinning and burning treatments. For example,
proportions of Gambel oak ranged from 6% to 29% of the
contemporary stems, averaging 18% across the four blocks in
1998. Following treatment, oak averaged 25% of stems in the
treatment units. New Mexico locust shifted from 18% of
stems in 1998 to 13.5% of stems in 2000. Both responses were
trends only and were not tested statistically.
The stem density and basal area reduction posttreatment is
also represented by a shift in the diameter distributions of the
units following treatment (Figure 2a–d). Figure 2 depicts
diameter distributions of control and treatment units in recon-
structed pre-1870 stands (1870), contemporary stands prior
to treatment (1998), and contemporary stands following
treatment (2000). In 1870, the ponderosa pine diameter
distribution resembled a broadly distributed curve with most
trees in the middle of the diameter range. However, in 1998,
approximately 40% of living trees were between 0 and 5 cm
dbh. Almost 75% of living ponderosa pine trees were below
25 cm dbh [note scale change between reconstructed forests
(1870) and contemporary forests (1998), Figure 2]. Follow-
ing treatment (2000 treatment units), diameters were distrib-
uted in a manner more comparable to the reconstructed
Figure 2a.  Diameter distributions of overstory tree structure for each experimental block—
treatment unit by time period. Trees per hectare were tallied within 10 cm diameter classes; the x-
axis represents the midpoint of the diameter class. The 1870 diameter distributions were based on
reconstructed forests, 1997–1998 distributions from pretreatment data, and 2000 diameter
distributions are following treatment. Changes in control units from 1998 to 2000 represent
naturally occurring mortality. A. EB1; B. EB2; C. EB3; D. EB4.

(1870) diameter distribution, although total trees per hectare
was higher. Ninety percent of the ponderosa pines thinned
was taken from diameter classes less than 35 cm at breast
height.
Restoration Treatment Effects on Contemporary
Forests
Contemporary forests age distributions for each control
and treatment unit within each block are shown in Figure 3
(1997–1998). Although there was variation between blocks
in age distributions (note graph scales), 94%–99% of ponde-
rosa pine trees had established since the time of the last
widespread fire, with center dates later than 1870. The
ponderosa pine regeneration pulse was greatly reduced in the
1950 age class (1940–1960); a much smaller proportion of
trees established in these decades. The youngest trees were
oaks and locust, although a pulse of oak regeneration was also
observed in the 1870 age class (1860–1880). This pulse is
most likely due to the cessation of fires, which allowed the
sprouting oak to reach tree stature. These age distributions
are comparable to other sites in the Southwest and Mexico
(Fulé et al. 1997, Mast et al. 1999).
Following treatment (2000), the age distribution was
altered by the removal of large proportions of the post-1870
establishment classes (Figure 3, last column, treatment units
only, note scale change). Although the posttreatment age
distributions are still skewed towards younger trees, the
proportion of young trees was reduced. Trees with center
dates later than 1870 comprised ~70% of the trees in blocks
Figure 2b.

892
Forest Science 49(6) 2003
1 and 3, and 90% of the trees in block 2 due mostly to oaks.
Block 4 was still predominantly composed of postsettlement
trees (99%). No trees that established before 1870 were
removed by the thinning treatment.
Restoration treatment reduced canopy cover from a pre-
treatment average of 56% to a posttreatment average of 35%
following restoration treatment; canopy cover was signifi-
cantly lower in treatment units than in control units (2-way
ANOVA F = 215.7, P < 0.001). Posttreatment canopy cover
ranged from 22% in EB3 to as high as 53% in EB4. Canopy
cover is correlated with trees per hectare, but also gives an
indication of tree biomass. Other studies show canopy cover
to be inversely related to understory production (Moore and
Deiter 1992), and lower canopy cover values may indicate
future increases of herbaceous production.
Regeneration of all tree species showed no significant
differences prior to treatment in contemporary forests when
analyzed across all blocks (Wilcoxin signed ranks Z = 0, P =
1.00; control mean ± SE = 2807.5 ± 997.9, treatment mean ±
SE = 2852.5 ± 1326.3). Following treatment, total tree
regeneration was significantly higher in restored units than
control (Wilcoxin signed ranks Z = 1.83, P = 0.068, control
mean ± SE = 2028.8 ± 848.8, treatment mean ± SE = 2432.5
± 1018.5). Variation within units was high when examined by
block (Table 2). The only tree species with regeneration
present in all four blocks was ponderosa pine, and this species
had identical regeneration patterns prior to restoration treat-
ments (Figure 4, 1997–1998 Wilcoxin signed ranks Z = 0.37,
P = 0.715). However, following restoration treatments, this
species showed a significant reduction in regeneration (Fig-
ure 4, 2000 Wilcoxin signed ranks Z = –1.84, P = 0.066),
which was counteracted by increases in the deciduous, sprout-
ing species (oak and locust) following restoration. Gambel
oak and New Mexican locust were not equally represented in
the blocks, so effects of restoration treatment could not be
tested effectively for these species.
Total dead fuel loadings were high prior to treatments,
ranging from a low of 16 Mg/ha in EB3 to a high of 64 Mg/ha
Figure 2c.

Forest Science 49(6) 2003

in EB2 (Table 3). Fuels averaged 34 Mg/ha prior to treatment
across the entire site. Forest floor depths ranged from 2 cm to
5 cm, and no significant differences between treatment units
were found prior to treatment (Figure 5A, MANOVA F =
1.54, P = 0.301). Woody debris was highly variable across the
site and also showed no significant differences between
control and treatment units prior to restoration treatments
(Figure 5A, MANOVA F = 12.6, P = 0.075).
Significant forest fuel depth reduction occurred in treat-
ment units across blocks in litter and duff layers (Figure 5B,
MANOVA F = 9.19, P = 0.021). No statistically significant
differences were found in woody debris following restoration
treatments (Figure 5B, MANOVA F = 1.3, P = 0.486).
However, trends toward increases in 100 hr fuels and 1000 hr
sound fuels, as well as decreases in 1000 hr rotten fuels, are
apparent in Figure 5B. The thinning component of restoration
treatments adds sound fuel through slash, often resulting in
increases in larger woody fuels, represented by 100 hr and
1000 hr fuels. The burning phase reduces fine fuels, such as
litter and duff, and rotten woody fuels.
Discussion
Structural Changes since 1870
Forest structure showed significant increases in tree
density and basal area since 1870 when the frequent
surface fire regime was halted at the Mt. Trumbull site. On
average, 1998 tree densities were 25 times higher than
1870 densities, and basal area values were approximately
2.5 times higher. Ponderosa pine densities were 13 times
as high in 1998 in blocks 1–3, but increased at EB4 an
Figure 2d.

with encroachment and density increases by Douglas-fir
and white fir (Heinlein 1996, Allen 2002, Fulé et al.
2002a). This study suggests that comparable changes may
be found at the lower elevation ecotones.
The forest reconstruction methodology depended on suc-
cessfully finding and correctly identifying pre-1870 tree
evidence such as stumps, logs, and snags. The likelihood of
success in northern Arizona is relatively high given the
absence of fire combined with the arid environment to limit
decomposition and slow decomposition rates of conifer wood
(Fulé et al. 1997). Mast et al. (1999) showed that old wood
could be correctly classified in the field. Huffman et al.
(2001) tested reconstruction procedures on the oldest histori-
cal forest plots in the Southwest, established 1909–1914,
finding a missed tree error rate less than 3 trees/ha (approxi-
mately 11%) for trees with dbh > 10.2 cm in northern
Arizona.  The very smallest trees are the most likely to decay
rapidly. As an example of the upper boundary of possible
error in the present study, assume that all the trees <15 cm dbh
present today were to be added to the 1870 forest. The tree
density would rise by an average 1,121 trees/ha, changing our
assessment of diameter distribution. But the basal area would
increase by only 3.7 m2/ha, accounting for only about 13% of
the rise in basal area from 1870 to present. Intersecting lines
order of magnitude higher, with ponderosa pine more than
100 times as dense in 1998 (1700 trees/ha) than in 1870 (14
trees/ha). These changes are characteristic of many South-
west forests where dense forest stands established after
interruption of the fire regime (Cooper 1960, White 1985,
Covington et al. 1994, Fulé et al. 1997). Although heavily
logged, some large diameter trees remained in the current
stands across the site. On average, this research site had
16.5 pre-1870 era trees per hectare, ranging from a low of
2.5 trees/ha in EB4 to a high of 35 trees/ha in EB1. Studies
have shown these trees are stressed under current dense
conditions (Biondi 1996) and are more susceptible to
disease and insect attack (Kolb et al. 1998).
Forest composition showed minor alteration in decidu-
ous tree proportions, but did not change noticeably in 3 of
4 blocks, which were consistently dominated by ponde-
rosa pine. However, EB4 saw compositional changes from
a pinyon-juniper-ponderosa pine ecotone in 1870 to an
almost pure ponderosa pine stand in 1998. Forest ecotones
are the first systems to show compositional changes as the
processes that determine species distributions (i.e., cli-
mate change, fire) are disrupted (Allen and Breshears
1998, Weltzin and McPherson 2000). Many higher eleva-
tion forest studies have found compositional changes,

of evidence from historical sources such as old forest surveys
(e.g., Woolsey 1911) are also commonly used to confirm or
contradict reconstruction results. Old historical survey data
were not available for the Trumbull site, but paired landscape
depictions from 1870 and 1995 published by Moore et al.
(1999) support our finding of great increases in tree density,
especially at EB4 which is in the center of each picture.
Effectiveness of Restoration Treatments
Assessing the effectiveness of an ecological restoration
project is complex, involving interrelated elements of eco-
system structure and function (Zedler and Callaway 1999,
Block et al. 2001) over a specified time period (Jackson et al.
1995) with respect to specific ecological goals (Landres et al.
1999) and the social context (Higgs 1997). A comprehensive
assessment of the Trumbull experiment will require data
from numerous studies over an extended period. Here, we
limit our discussion to short-term forest structural changes,
but we recognize explicitly that forest structure is only one of
many important factors.
In the first year after treatment, restoration thinning and
burning was successful in reducing tree density while main-
taining larger and older trees (Figure 3). However, although
forest density was significantly reduced, posttreatment stands
remained significantly more dense than 1870 reconstructed
stands. There are several implications to leaving higher
numbers of trees in the restoration treatments. First, excess
tree density provides a buffer for the underestimation of 1870
tree density. In this case, tree densities in restored units were
between 100% and 1000% (in EB4) higher than recon-
structed pre-1870 tree densities, providing additional trees
well above the 11% reconstruction error rate found in Huffman
et al.’s study (2001). Second, excess trees also protect against
unanticipated mortality during the treatment process itself.
Mortality could be associated with factors such as damage

from falling trees, wind throw, sunscald, insect herbivory, or
burning. For example, observations in 2001 showed in-
creased mortality of old-growth trees in EB1 in the second
year following restoration treatment, but not in the control
(Fulé et al 2002b). This unit is located on lava soils, which
may contribute to differential old-growth response to fires
(Swezy and Agee 1991). Currently, all prescribed fire on lava
soils has been suspended, pending further research. Third,
since posttreatment tree densities and basal area are higher
than those conditions in 1870, fire hazard probably remains
higher than in 1870. A comparison of simulated crownfires
by Fulé et al. (2001) showed a substantial reduction in
potential crownfire behavior in all four treated units, but the
reduction was linked to the level of thinning intensity. Fi-
nally, if excess trees are found to survive well in the first
decades following thinning and burning, managers should
consider additional treatments to maintain open forest condi-
tions consistent with the range of natural variability. These
treatments might range from traditional cutting and removal
of trees to killing trees on-site with a variety of methods (e.g.,
girdling, piling fuels under target trees for lethal fire, or
attracting bark beetles with aggregation pheromones).
Re-introduction of surface fire was a central objective of
the restoration treatment. However, the initial prescribed
burn was not comparable to pre-1870 fires as the fuel struc-
tures consisted of thinning residues and accumulated forest
floor fuels. The initial burn consumed much of the highly
flammable slash, including needles and small twigs. How-
ever, boles from small-diameter trees remained on the ground
following treatment; they may require several fires over a
decade or longer until they are mostly consumed.  Fuels left
after thinning were highly variable, but some patterns emerged
when fuel loadings were examined by categories. For ex-
ample, following the prescribed burn, forest floor fuels (litter
and duff) had significant declines, but large-diameter woody
debris showed increasing trends, similar to the increase
observed by Lynch et al. (2000). Although there were fuel
compositional changes, the total fuel loadings did not show
significant changes across the four blocks with restoration
treatment.
These data indicate that several goals were accomplished
in the first year following treatment. Tree density reduction
reduced the threat of crownfire (Fulé et al. 2001), and much

of the accumulated fine fuel was removed. Tree composition
was not significantly altered by the treatments and retained
characteristics of pre-1870 forests. Diameter distributions,
while still skewed relative to pre-1870 distributions, showed
reduction in the proportions of small-diameter trees. Several
attributes that were monitored in the restoration treatments
may not show effects for several years. For example, tree
regeneration was variable but showed significant increases in
the first year following treatment, even with declines in
ponderosa pine regeneration. Responses 5 and 10 yr follow-
ing treatment and successive prescribed fires remain to be
tested. These responses will probably continue to vary be-
tween conifer and deciduous species because of their differ-
ent seeding/sprouting regeneration pathways. Fuel loadings
will continue to alter with recurring fire and tree mortality
through time.
Diversity in Forest Structure
A central theme encountered across all aspects of the
experiment was the high variability of the posttreatment
forest, despite the application of a “uniform” thinning
prescription. In part, the variability is by design, because
the thinning was designed to use direct, site-specific evi-
dence from stumps, snags, and logs to closely emulate the
1870 conditions of species composition, density, and spa-
tial pattern [see stem maps of forest pattern in Moore et al.
(1999)]. Beyond the intentional variability, however, each
treatment unit also differed in factors such as soil texture,
elevation, slope, aspect, thinning methodology, removal
of large logs, and burning effects. The end result was high
diversity in forest structure between treatment units, a
conclusion that could only be drawn from a replicated
experiment.
Changes in forest structure had affected not only the mean
density but its variability as well. The 1870 forest structure
was relatively uniform, ranging from 26.3 to 106.3 trees/ha
per unit (mean 61.3 trees/ha) and 4.6 to 13.8 m2/ha (mean 7.4
m2/ha) (Figure 2, Table 1), meaning that across the landscape
represented by these experimental blocks the maximum
differences in stand density and basal area were 80 trees/ha
and 9.2 m2/ha, respectively. By 1997–1998, the maximum
differences grew to 1,881 trees/ha and 26.6 m2/ha.
Where tree thinning was fully carried out, in blocks 1 to 3,
residual diversity in forest structure was closely related to
pretreatment forest structure. Blocks 1 and 3 were dominated
by ponderosa pine (98% and 95% of pretreatment basal area,
respectively). Forest structure after treatment was only 204–
286% more dense, and basal area was 189–202% higher than
the 1870 density. Block 2, with much Gambel oak, was 535%
higher in tree density and 272% higher in basal area than the
1870 forest. However, the numerous Gambel oak stems
contributed only 0.3 m2/ha, <2% of the posttreatment basal
area. In block 4, where high tree density of ponderosa pine
prevented complete thinning, forest density was 1,489%
higher and basal area was 352% higher than the 1870 forest.
It is premature at this point to estimate the proportions of the
Mt. Trumbull landscape in which posttreatment structure
will be similar to each of the experimental blocks. But their
deliberate selection as representative sites suggests that the
landscape range of structural diversity will not be less than
that observed on the blocks.
Posttreatment diversity has many implications for forest
managers and stakeholders, a few of which are explored here.
First, although canopy fuels were reduced in all treatments,
predicted fire behavior varied widely from 0 to 49% canopy
burning (Fulé et al. 2001). Crownfire initiation was most
influenced by low crown base height, so the dense oak stems
in block 2 were the most vulnerable. The situation was
reversed in block 4, where high crown base heights were
predicted to keep fires on the surface, but high crown bulk
density could support active crownfire at windspeeds as low
as 36 km/hr. Future fuels may also differ: substantially more
herbaceous growth would be expected in blocks 1–3 (basal
area 14.9–17.0 m2/ha) than in block 4 (26.4 m2/ha) (Moore
and Dieter 1992). When the larger Mt. Trumbull landscape
has been treated, managers should expect fire behavior to
vary relatively widely in the treated areas as well as in the
interspersed untreated patches.
Structural diversity at Mt. Trumbull influences wildlife
habitat by affecting diverse attributes such as nectar pro-
duction [butterflies: Waltz and Covington (2001)], micro-
climate [butterflies: Meyer and Sisk (2001), Meyer et al.
(2001)], fledgling success and parasitism [western blue-

depth and loading showed no significant differences between

recorded in woody fuel loadings following treatments.

bird: Germaine and Germaine (2002)], and downed woody
material (small mammals: Chambers, in press). Most of
these research studies were set up to contrast “treated” and
“untreated” forest, but this dichotomy is probably unsuit-
able in light of high variability. Furthermore, extensive
edge habitat may be expected to exist after treatment
between dense, shrubby pine-oak forest (e.g., EB 2), open
patches (e.g., EB 1), and relatively dense pine forest (e.g.,
EB 4).
These replicated experiments are the first in ponderosa
pine restoration at this scale, providing ecological data that
are likely to affect management decisions in ponderosa pine
forests. Restoration treatments did not re-create the pre-1870
forest or immediately reverse long-term degradation result-
ing from logging and grazing. Old growth trees were limited
at the Mt. Trumbull site due to early 20th century logging, and
younger trees will not contribute to forest structure in similar
ways for decades or even centuries. However, this treatment
is a potential management option that can restore important
characteristics of the pre-1870 forest, such as more open
stands, which in turn may help prevent damage from unchar-
acteristically severe fires. Maintenance of prescribed burn-
ing and regulation of incompatible activities such as exces-
sive forage consumption represent a vital long-term commit-
ment to ecosystem restoration. Future monitoring is neces-
sary to understand the effects of restoration treatments com-
bined with uses such as recreation or livestock grazing.
