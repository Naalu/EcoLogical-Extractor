AbstrAct
Ponderosa pine and dry mixed-conifer forests in the Southwest United States are 
experiencing, or have become increasingly susceptible to, large-scale severe wildfire, 
insect, and disease episodes resulting in altered plant and animal demographics, 
reduced productivity and biodiversity, and impaired ecosystem processes and 
functions. We present a management framework based on a synthesis of science 
on forest ecology and management, reference conditions, and lessons learned 
during implementations of our restoration framework. Our framework focuses on 
the restoration of key elements similar to the historical composition and structure of 
vegetation in these forests: (1) species composition; (2) groups of trees; (3) scattered 
individual trees; (4) grass-forb-shrub interspaces; (5) snags, logs, and woody debris; and 
(6) variation in the arrangements of these elements in space and time. Our framework 
informs management strategies that can improve the resiliency of frequent-fire forests 
and facilitate the resumption of characteristic ecosystem processes and functions by 
restoring the composition, structure, and spatial patterns of vegetation. We believe 
restoration of key compositional and structural elements on a per-site basis will restore 
resiliency of frequent-fire forests in the Southwest, and thereby position them to better 
resist, and adapt to, future disturbances and climates.

ExEcutivE summAry
Many forest landscapes in the Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, southwest 
Colorado, and southern Utah) have become increasingly susceptible to large-scale, severe 
wildfire, insect, and disease episodes. As a result, these areas are experiencing altered 
plant and animal demographics, reduced structural and spatial heterogeneity of vegetation, 
reduced productivity and biodiversity, and impaired ecosystem processes, functions, 
and services. Increased susceptibilities are most evident in frequent-fire forests—forests 
that historically experienced frequent, low-severity fire, which in the Southwest include 
ponderosa pine and dry mixed-conifer forests. Changes to these frequent-fire forests largely 
resulted from unregulated livestock grazing around the turn of the 20th Century, logging, and 
human activities such as fire suppression, resource use, and infrastructure development.
We present a management framework for improving the resistance and resiliency of 
frequent-fire forest ecosystems to severe disturbances. This is accomplished by restoring the 
characteristic vegetation composition and structure in these forests. Frequent-fire forests had 
a characteristic uneven-aged structure consisting of a temporally shifting mosaic of different 
aged tree groups and scattered individual trees in an open grass-forb-shrub matrix—a spatial 
and temporal pattern that provided and sustained plant and animal habitat adjacency, local 
biodiversity, and food webs. Hence, the key compositional and structural elements of our 
restoration framework are: (1) species composition (tree and understory vegetation);  
(2) groups of trees; (3) scattered individual trees; (4) open grass-forb-shrub interspaces 
between tree groups and individual trees; (5) snags, logs, and woody debris; and (6) variation 
in arrangements of these elements in space and time. Our framework is informed by:
• reference conditions (conditions of ecosystems before significant industrial human 
disturbance),
• natural ranges of variability (ranges of reference conditions for a specific ecosystem and 
time period),
• observed changes in disturbance regimes, and
• lessons learned during applications of our framework in frequent-fire forests in the 
Southwest.
The types, frequencies, and severities of disturbances (e.g., fires, insects, and diseases) 
played an important role in shaping the historical composition, structure, and function 
of frequent-fire forests. Therefore, where forest composition and its structure allow, the 
framework recommends that fire, the primary historical disturbance agent in these forests, 
play a prominent role in their restoration. The framework also emphasizes that mechanical 
treatments may be necessary to initiate suitable compositions and structures before 
reintroducing fire. Where use of fire is limited, mechanical treatments may be the only 
available tool to create and maintain restored forests. Conversely, fire may be the only tool in 
some areas. Restoration provides opportunities for the re-establishment of the characteristic 
disturbance regimes as well as the spatial and temporal links between pattern and process 
(e.g., the feedback relationship between forest structure and fire) that sustained the 
characteristic composition and structure of these forests. Implementation of our framework 
should improve overall ecosystem productivity and function and enhance ecosystem services 
such as soil productivity, biodiversity, wildlife habitat, clean air, water quality and quantity, 
wood products, and recreation.
Natural ranges of variability are considered a “best” estimate of a resilient and functioning 
ecosystem because they reflect the evolutionary and historical ecology of forests. Natural 
ranges of variability are thereby a powerful template for improving the resiliency of frequent-
fire forests. Natural variability in the composition and structure across sites in these forests 
results from and drives spatial differences in fire effects, plant species compositions, tree 
establishment patterns and densities, and numbers and distribution of snags, logs, and 
woody debris. Managers are encouraged to recognize the natural variability in ponderosa 
pine and dry mixed-conifer forests and to use historical evidence, such as old trees, stumps, 
and logs, and biophysical site attributes (e.g., soils, slopes, aspects, and climate) to guide 
the restoration of variability in these forests. Studies of reference conditions in Southwestern 
ponderosa pine and dry mixed-conifer showed that trees occurred in a range of spatial 
patterns, most often aggregated but with a random distribution on certain soils. Tree groups 
were separated by open grass-forb-shrub interspaces of variable sizes and shapes that often 
ii

contained scattered individual trees. In areas exhibiting strong tree aggregation, openness 
was typically higher, but on sites with less tree aggregation, openness may have been 
lower depending on the arrangement of trees, their sizes, and crown widths (Table 1). The 
distribution and abundance of snags and logs varied with site and likely coincided with 
the type, severity, and scale of historical disturbance (Table 1). While reference condition 
literature on the fine-scale (<10 acres) composition and structure in dry mixed-conifer is 
more limited than for ponderosa pine, studies showed many similarities—the consequence 
of their characteristic frequent, low-severity fire regimes. Nonetheless, ranges of reference 
conditions at small spatial scales showed that mean tree densities and basal areas were 
slightly greater in dry mixed-conifer forests than ponderosa pine, and snag and log 
abundances appeared similar to or slightly greater in dry mixed-conifer than in ponderosa 
pine forests. Compared to today’s forests, characteristic dry mixed-conifer forests had higher 
proportions of fire-resistant/shade-intolerant tree species; lower tree densities; a more open 
structure comprised of higher proportions of large, old trees; and more spatial heterogeneity 
(groups and patches of trees).
To illustrate implementation of our framework, we describe a restoration treatment in a 
ponderosa pine stand in New Mexico that had experienced incidental tree cutting and no 
fire since the 1880s. While the stand had a characteristic component of old trees, there was 
a preponderance of mid-aged trees. Fire behavior modeling of pre-treatment conditions 
showed that 11 percent of the stand could support torching and active crown fire under dry 
conditions and moderate wind speeds. Our restoration treatment moved the composition 
and structure of the stand towards characteristic conditions—distinct tree groups, scattered 
single trees, and open interspaces between tree groups. Implementation of the framework 
resulted in predicted crown fire behavior on only 1 percent of the stand. Post-treatment 
abundance of logs and snags was lower than desired, but these elements will accumulate 
over time.
Our framework incorporates knowledge of the historical compositions, structures, functions, 
and processes in Southwest frequent-fire forests and how these operated through feedback 
mechanisms to sustain their characteristic compositions and structures. Current forest 
conditions are reviewed in light of historical conditions and how human-caused changes 
to these forests lowered their resistance and resilience to disturbance agents, which have 
become more intense and frequent. Our framework offers management recommendations 
for achieving the key compositional and structural elements for restoring frequent-fire forests. 
Once restored, these forests comprise a temporally shifting mosaic of groups of trees with 
interlocking crowns; scattered single trees; open grass-forb-shrub interspaces between tree 
groups; and dispersed snags, logs, and woody debris. It may not always be feasible or even 
desirable to restore exact reference compositions and structures. Instead, our framework’s 
objective is to increase forest resiliency by managing forest composition and structure toward 
reference conditions. We believe restoration of key compositional and structural elements 
on a per-site basis will enhance the resiliency of frequent-fire forests in the Southwest, 
thereby positioning them to better adapt to future disturbances and climates. It is our intent 
that application of this framework be flexible and adaptive (i.e., learn-as-you-go), that it will 
evolve with accumulation of knowledge, and that its conceptual approach will provide a 
blueprint against which management plans and practices can be evaluated.

There is increasing recognition that frequent-fire 
forests, defined as forests with fire return intervals <35 
years (Table 2), have become progressively more sus-
ceptible to large-scale, severe wildfire (Covington and 
Moore 1994b; Steele and others 1986; Westerling and 
others 2006). These forests, which in the Southwestern 
United States include ponderosa pine and dry mixed-
conifer forests (see Appendix 1 for scientific names 
of species referred to herein), are also increasingly 
prone to insect and disease epidemics and altered plant 
and animal habitats, all leading to reduced biodiver-
sity, ecological function, resilience, and sustainabil-
ity (Allen and others 2002; Benayas and others 2009; 
Carey and others 1992; Carey and others 1999; Colgan 
and others 1999; Covington and Moore 1994a; Kalies 
and others 2012; Lynch and others 2010). Reduced 
ecosystem resilience to disturbances is more evident in 
frequent-fire forests where the composition, structure 
(age, size, density, and spatial patterns of vegetation), 
processes (e.g., disturbances), and functions (e.g., food 
webs) have changed to a greater degree due to reduc-
tions in fire frequency than in forest types where fire 
was historically less frequent (Agee 2003; Covington 
and Moore 1994a; Crist and others 2009; Hessburg 
and others 1999). This reduction in fire frequency is, 
in part, a result of more than a century of intensive hu-
man activities, including fire suppression, livestock 
grazing, and logging. Important compositional and 
structural changes in these forests resulting from hu-
man activities, especially those that changed historical 
fire regimes, include:
• increased tree densities,
• reduced structural and spatial heterogeneity of 
vegetation,
• declines in grass-forb-shrub vegetation,
• loss of old trees, and
• reductions in the diversity and quality of plant and 
animal habitats and food webs (Abella 2009; Arnold 
1950; Covington and others 1997; Kalies and others 
2012; Larson and Churchill 2012).
In addition to increasingly frequent and uncharacteris-
tic disturbances such as large-scale severe fire events 
(Allen 2007; Covington and Moore 1994b; Fitzgerald 
2005; Graham and others 2004; Swetnam and others 
1999) and insect epidemics (Ferry and others 1995; 
Hessburg and others 2005; Kolb and others 1998; 
Negrón 1997), these changes resulted in environments 
that differed from those in which the native fauna and 
flora evolved (Carey 2003; Carey and others 1992, 
1999; Colgan and others 1999; Covington and Moore 
1994b; Kalies and others 2012; Reynolds and others 
1992, 2006a). Furthermore, ecosystem services such as 
clean air and water, water yield, wood products, recre-
ation, aesthetic and spiritual experiences, old-growth, 
nutrient cycling, pollination, and carbon sequestra-
tion have been altered and are now more vulnerable 
to rapid degradation by uncharacteristic fire and insect 
epidemics (Benayas and others 2009; Ferry and oth-
ers 1995; Finkral and Evans 2008; Hessburg and others 
2005; Kolb and others 1998; Negrón 1997; reviewed in 
Evans and others 2011 and Hunter and others 2007).
Prior to human-influenced changes to the charac-
teristic fire regime, the composition, structure, and 
spatial pattern in frequent-fire forests were maintained 
by frequent, low-severity fire through a functional 
relationship between pattern and process; that is, fre-
quent low-severity fires resulted in forest structures 
that facilitated continued low-severity fire (Fitzgerald 
2005; Graham and others 2004; Hiers and others 2009; 
Mitchell and others 2009; Thaxton and Platt 2006). 
Over time, shifting mosaics of tree groups and indi-
vidual trees of varying ages were maintained within 
a grass-forb-shrub matrix by relationships among the 
severity and frequency of fire, presence of surface fu-
els (fuels on or near the surface of the ground), and 
tree regeneration sites that escaped fire (Larson and 
Churchill 2012). Some dry mixed-conifer forests 
and ponderosa pine-shrub communities experienced 
mixed-severity fires, which included combinations 
of surface and crown fires (see Table 2), sometimes 
resulting in larger patches of tree aggregation (Agee 
1993; Arno and others 1995; Kaufmann and others 
2007; Larson and Churchill 2012).
Forest restoration guided by reference conditions 
(conditions that characterized the status of ecosys-
tems before significant industrial human disturbance; 
sensu Kaufmann and others 1994) provides for the ap-
proximation of the historical (i.e., natural) effects of 
characteristic disturbances. Restoration is the process 
of assisting the recovery of degraded, damaged, or 
destroyed ecosystems (SER 2004). Restoration initi-
ates or accelerates ecosystem recovery with respect 
to ecological health (productivity), integrity (species 
composition, community and ecosystem structure), and 
sustainability (resistance and resilience to disturbance)

(SER 2004). Ecosystem resiliency is the ability of an 
ecosystem to absorb and recover from disturbances 
without altering its inherent function (SER 2004). 
A functioning ecosystem provides opportunities for 
sustaining plant and animal habitats and populations, 
increased biodiversity, nutrient cycling, carbon seques-
tration, air quality, water quality and quantity, wood 
products, forage, recreation, and aesthetic and spiri-
tual experiences (Aronson and others 2007; Benayas 
and others 2009). Restoring forest composition and 
structure improves ecosystem function and resiliency 
(Bradshaw 1984; Cortina and others 2006).
A holistic approach to forest restoration based 
on appropriate science can also help meet multiple 
management objectives, including fuels reduction; 
reintroduction of characteristic disturbances; and the 
return of wildlife habitats, native biodiversity, and food 
webs (Covington and Moore 1994b; Kalies and others 
2012; Reynolds and others 1992, 2006a). Management 
informed by reference conditions and natural ranges of 
variability (the range of ecological and evolutionary 
conditions appropriate for an area; sensu Landres and 
others 1999) allow for the restoration of the character-
istic composition, structure, spatial pattern, processes, 
and functions of ecosystems. Managing forests guided 
by historical conditions also restores the evolutionary 
environment (Kalies and others 2012; Moore and oth-
ers 1999), enhancing the capacity of organisms in 
ecosystems to adapt to stressors such as fire, insects, 
disease, and climatic variability and change.
We describe a framework, including assumptions, 
principles, values, concepts, and procedures, for re-
storing the composition, structure, and spatial pattern 
of ponderosa pine and dry mixed-conifer forests in the 
Southwest. Our framework is a science-based approach 
to restoration that will prove useful for developing 
strategic plans and management applications. The 
framework emphasizes vegetation composition and 
structure, describes expected outcomes, and presents 
management recommendations for implementation. 
Expected outcomes include: increased biodiversity, 
plant and animal habitats, and ecosystem services; 
increased resilience to insects, disease, and climate 
change; and reduced fuel loads and fire hazards. Key 
compositional and structural elements of our restora-
tion framework are:
(1) species composition (tree and understory 
vegetation);
(2) groups of trees;
(3) scattered individual trees;
(4) open grass-forb-shrub interspaces;

three spatial scales for frequent-fire forests in 
the Southwest. The landscape-scale illustrates 
the importance of multiple stands (patches), 
meadows, and grasslands. The mid- and fine-
scales illustrate grass-forb-shrub interspaces 
and uneven-aged stand conditions consisting of

space and time (Fig. 1).
Ecosystems are structured hierarchically and their 
composition, structure, processes, and functions are 
temporally and spatially dynamic. Therefore, we char-
acterize the key compositional and structural elements 
at three spatial scales: fine (<10 acres), mid (10-1000 
acres), and landscape (1000-10,000+ acres) (Fig. 1). 
These scales generally correspond with structural fea-
tures in frequent-fire forests. The fine scale is an area 
in which the species composition—age, structure, and 
spatial distribution of trees (single and grouped)—and 
grass-forb-shrub interspaces are expressed. Aggregates 
of fine-scale units comprise mid-scale patches or 
stands, which are relatively homogeneous in vegeta-
tion composition and structure. The landscape scale is 
composed of aggregates of mid-scale units and usu-
ally has variable elevations, slopes, aspects, soil types, 
plant associations, disturbance processes, and land 
uses. Understanding and incorporating temporal scales 
(e.g., seasonal, annual, decadal, and centuries) in a res-
toration framework is required to sustain vegetation 
dynamics of forests that result from growth, succes-
sion, senescence, and the historical and anthropogenic 
disturbances that periodically reset the dynamics.
Management recommendations for implement-
ing our framework are tempered by our management 
and research experience in frequent-fire forests, as 
well as by lessons learned during implementations 
of the framework in the Southwest. The intent of our 
framework is to inform management strategies that 
will facilitate the resumption of historical processes 
and functions. Managing for the framework’s key ele-
ments should increase the resilience of the forests and 
facilitate opportunities for the resumption of character-
istic function and disturbance regimes. The spatial and 
temporal aspects of these elements reflect the recipro-
cal interactions between pattern and process in these 
forests and are an ecological basis (Turner 1989) for 
incorporating spatial information in forest restoration 
(Larson and Churchill 2012).

Mechanisms Influencing  
Forest Composition
Plant species composition of a forest ecosystem is 
influenced by both deterministic and stochastic fac-
tors, including complex interactions among species’ 
life histories, disturbance regimes, and chance events. 
The establishment, growth, and survival of under- and 
over-story species are affected by competition for 
space, light, nutrients, and moisture. For example, tree 
regeneration and growth is affected by species-specific 
shade tolerance (Fig. 2); open stand conditions favor the 
regeneration of shade-intolerant species while closed 
stands favor shade-tolerant species (Langsaeter 1944; 
Long 1985; USDA Forest Service 1990). Biophysical 
conditions, such as soils, temperature, and moisture re-
gimes, also influence the establishment, development, 
and abundance of under- and over-story plant species. 
Disturbances (e.g., fire, insects, pathogens, drought, 
and wind) often interact with biophysical site charac-
teristics to further influence composition and structure 
of forest ecosystems. Such disturbances have variable 
temporal and spatial effects on vegetation depending 
on their type, frequency, intensity, seasonality, and 
spatial scale, which collectively define a characteristic 
disturbance regime of an ecosystem. Species in a forest 
ecosystem evolved under its characteristic disturbance 
regime, resulting in a natural range of variability or the 
range of ecological and evolutionary conditions appro-
priate to an ecosystem (Landres and others 1999).
Fire is the primary disturbance agent in many 
Southwestern forests, and fire regimes are central to 
understanding an ecosystem’s reference conditions 
and natural range of variability (Fig. 3; Table 2) (Fulé 
and others 2003). The species composition, as well 
as the structure and spatial pattern of vegetation in 
Southwestern frequent-fire forests developed in a feed-
back relationship with fire. Ponderosa pine and dry 
mixed-conifer forests are characterized by a frequent 
low-severity fire regime (Swetnam and Baisan 1996; 
Swetnam and Betancourt 1990) with historic mean fire 
return intervals ranging from 2-24 years (Brown and 
others 2001; Brown and Wu 2005; Evans and others 
2011; Hunter and others 2007; Swetnam and Baisan 
1996). Frequent low-severity fire favors shade intol-
erant and fire-resistant tree species (Fig. 2) and open 
forest conditions with discontinuous crowns and mini-
mal fuels build-up, often with tree groups separated by 
open interspaces with grass-forb-shrub communities. 
In contrast, longer fire return intervals permit seedling 
development to larger, more fire-resistant tree sizes 
and favor survival of less fire-resistant species (Fig. 2) 
(Fulé and Laughlin 2007; Laacke 1990; Taylor and 
Skinner 2003).
Endemic forest insects and pathogens are impor-
tant disturbance agents that do not threaten long-term

mixed-conifer is not a homogenous type, 
intergrading with ponderosa pine forest 
on warm/dry sites and wet mixed-conifer 
forests on cool/wet sites. Its structure and 
composition become more similar as it 
intergrades with adjacent forest. Common 
tree species in ponderosa pine and mixed-
conifer forests also vary in their relative 
shade and fire tolerance.

stability and productivity of forests under endemic 
conditions due to moderation by millions of years of 
evolution (Goheen and Hansen 1993). When large 
or uncharacteristic insect and disease outbreaks oc-
cur, profound changes to the composition, structure, 
processes, and functions of forests often take place. 
Insects and diseases affect nearly all aspects of for-
est stand dynamics, from seed viability to seedling 
survival, from bud, shoot, and leaf production to 
growth and maintenance, and, ultimately, the survival 
and distribution of mature trees (Castello and others 
1995; Tainter and Baker 1996). Bark beetles, in par-
ticular, are considered primary sources of mortality in 
Southwestern ponderosa pine forests. In 2011 alone, 
bark beetles caused varying rates of ponderosa pine 
mortality on more than 144,000 acres in Arizona and 
New Mexico (USDA Forest Service 2012). Unlike 
bark beetles in ponderosa pine, the primary sources of 
mortality attributed to insects in mixed-conifer forests 
are typically defoliating insects. Damage from defoli-
ators can range from large areas of widespread growth 
losses and infrequent mortality, as with the spruce 
budworm, to more localized, high levels of mortal-
ity caused by the Douglas-fir tussock moth (Wickman 
1963).
While numerous species of dwarf mistletoe occur 
in frequent-fire forests, Southwestern (ponderosa pine) 
dwarf mistletoe and Douglas-fir dwarf mistletoe are 
the most prevalent. Dwarf mistletoes may be the most 
damaging of pathogens in Southwest forests with esti-
mates of current infection being 30 percent or greater 
in ponderosa pine forests (Andrews and Daniels 1960; 
Maffei and Beatty 1988) and around 50 percent in 
mixed-conifer forests (Conklin and Fairweather 2010; 
Drummond 1982). Additionally, the presence and in-
tensity of Southwestern dwarf mistletoe infection in 
ponderosa pine stands has been implicated as a source 
of mortality or as an exacerbating factor in bark beetle 
outbreaks (Negrón 1997; Stevens and Hawksworth 
1984). Endemic soil fungi that cause root disease (e.g., 
armillaria and black-stain root diseases) also influence 
forest composition and structure (Rippy and others 
2005). Root diseases are known to affect the ponder-
osa pine forests of the Southwest, with observations 
of mortality associated with root disease, mistletoe, 
and bark beetles as high as 25 percent (Wood 1983). 
In some locations, conifers killed by root disease are 
replaced by less susceptible conifers, hardwood spe-
cies, or grass-forb-shrub interspaces. In the case of 
armillaria and related wood decay fungi, this shift in 
species composition can be maintained for decades 
due to remnant fungi in stumps and root systems (Roth 
and others 1980). In most situations, native root dis-
eases do not cause irreplaceable loss of entire stands 
over large areas, nor do they threaten the existence of 
any host species. However, shifts in stand composition 
and other natural and human-caused disturbances have 
frequently resulted in increased damage from root dis-
eases (Edmonds and others 2000).
Mechanisms Influencing  
Forest Structure
Frequent-fire forests typically comprise a mo-
saic pattern of groups of trees, scattered single trees, 
grass-forb-shrub interspaces, snags, logs, and woody 
debris (Cooper 1960; Larson and Churchill 2012; 
Pearson 1950; White 1985). Structural heterogeneity

     aValues should be not interpreted as “strict” densities of trees within groups as authors used different definitions and methods to define and characterize “groups.” We suspect that as the number of 
species and site productivity increase the metric of “tree group” becomes less useful than this metric at the mid- to landscape-scale. For example, when tree density is fixed and numbers of tree species 
varies (i.e., compare ponderosa pine vs. ponderosa-pine Gambel oak vs. dry-mixed conifer forests), the area available to a “tree group” will likely decrease.
     bData based on 2.47-acre plots reconstructed prior to Euro-American settlement (1876-1890) in Arizona (n = 17 plots) and New Mexico (n = 7 plots) using the same methods as Sánchez Meador and 
others (2010, 2011). Historical and contemporary field methods, as well as contemporary conditions, are detailed in Sánchez Meador and others (2010) and Moore and others (2004) who reported 
forest structural reference conditions (size distributions, tree density ranges, spatial patterns, etc.) on a subset of these same plots. In brief, all live and dead tree structures were measured, including 
stumps, snags, and wind-fallen trees, that grew to at least breast height (4.5 ft). All tree structures were located using historical stem-maps and measured spatial coordinates, and dendrochronological 
reconstructions were used to quantify structural and spatial reference conditions (Baker and others 2008; Sánchez Meador and others 2010). Spatial attributes (e.g., group size and density) were 
quantified using methods described in Sánchez Meador and others (2011).

in these forests is a consequence of interactions among 
biophysical site conditions (e.g., topography, soils, 
climate); disturbance types, frequencies, intensities, 
and extent; levels of competition among species; and 
tree demographic rates. Variability in biophysical site 
conditions is a primary source of spatial and tempo-
ral variation in vegetation structure. Of studies that 
investigated the origin, distribution, and mortality of 
ponderosa pine forests, most reported uneven-aged ref-
erence conditions at the stand scale (Sánchez Meador 
and others 2010), but three different within-group age 
structures were identified. Cooper (1960) reported 
relatively even-aged tree groups, White (1985) and 
Abella (2008) reported groups of multi-aged trees, 
and Sánchez Meador and others (unpublished data; 
see Table 3 footnote) found mixtures of both types. 
Variation of tree ages within groups likely reflects the 
establishment and growth of a single, grouped cohort 
of trees and perhaps seedling establishment and growth 
of trees under, or adjacent to, tree groups (see Spatial 
Patterns: Formation and Maintenance) (Sánchez 
Meador and others 2009).
Heterogeneity of within-group tree sizes can gener-
ate from processes related to growth, competition, and 
disturbances and may result in a range of tree sizes 
irrespective of age (Mast and Veblen 1999; Pearson 
1950; Sánchez Meador and others 2011; Taylor 2010; 
Woodall 2000). Trees on the perimeter of groups tend to 
have higher growth rates, attain larger sizes, lean away 
from the group center, and have asymmetrical crowns 
with larger lower limbs than interior trees (Pearson 
1950). Heterogeneity in tree sizes and spacing within 
groups may decline over time due to mortality result-
ing in a gradual transition from dense to more uniform 
spacing of trees (Cooper 1961; Mast and Veblen 1999; 
Mast and Wolf 2004, 2006; Pielou 1960). However, 
tight clumps of trees sharing the same root ball often 
persist within groups (Fig. 4) (Larson and Churchill 
2012). Mortality over time may also gradually re-
duce within-group tree density, resulting in increased 
variation in tree densities and ages within and among 
groups.
Like composition, the structure of forest vegetation 
is also affected by disturbances such as fire, insects, 
disease, wind, and drought (Brown and others 2001; 
Ehle and Baker 2003; Mast and others 1998, 1999). 
Numerous abiotic and biotic disturbances affect the 
composition, amount, arrangement, spatial continuity, 
and volatility of surface and canopy fuels (Franklin 
and others 2012), which in turn effects fire behavior 
(Van Wagner 1977). Dense forest structures can facili-
tate crown fire by providing a potential path for fire 
through tree crowns (Cruz and others 2003; Fulé and 
others 2001; Graham and others 2004; Stratton 2004; 
Van Wagner 1977, 1993). Forest density further influ-
ences surface and canopy fuels through interactions 
with insects and diseases. The effects of bark beetles 
in ponderosa pine stands are more pronounced dur-
ing and following extended droughts and under dense 
stand conditions; both of which are conducive to 
the survival and reproduction of beetle populations. 
Negrón (1997) showed a link between roundheaded 
pine beetle attacks and higher densities of smaller, 
pole-sized trees in relatively homogenous stands of 
ponderosa pine in the Sacramento Mountains of New 
Mexico. Additionally, trees with heavy mistletoe infec-
tion are more susceptible to severe crown scorch and 
death from fires (Harrington and Hawksworth 1990; 
Hoffman and others 2007). Hawksworth and Wiens 
(1996) suggested that mistletoes have been important

species in frequent-fire forests since fire first appeared 
on these landscapes.
The density and arrangement of forest canopies 
affects the penetration of sunlight, precipitation, hu-
midity, and wind. In fact, dense forest structures can 
maintain relatively high fuel moistures and amelio-
rate wind effects. Forest canopies also influence the 
composition and abundance of surface fuels, which 
are essential to facilitate fire as a disturbance agent. 
Surface fuels also offer nutrients to soils, help reduce 
erosion, and influence understory vegetation produc-
tivity, density, and diversity (Kalies and others 2012; 
Kerns and others 2003; Moore and others 1999). In 
general, more fuel accumulates and persists in forests 
with longer fire return intervals than in those with more 
frequent surface fire (Brewer 2008; Minnich and oth-
ers 2000). Fine fuels (grass, needles, cones, and woody 
material less than 0.25 inches in diameter) and small 
branches accumulate more rapidly under tree groups 
than in interspaces between tree groups (Fig. 5). This 
accumulation facilitates fire, in turn restricting the es-
tablishment and persistence of trees and shrubs under 
tree groups. The amount and composition of surface 
fuels interact with weather conditions to influence fire 
behavior. Herbaceous fuels respond quickly to relative 
humidity and thus carry fire less readily when humid-
ity is high, whereas pine needles will readily carry fire 
under these conditions (see moisture of extinction in 
Anderson 1982; Scott and Burgan 2005). Furthermore, 
needle and twig litter will burn with higher intensity 
than herbaceous fuel under similar weather conditions.
Forest structure affects the distribution, den-
sity, and composition of surface and canopy fu-
els, which affects the behavior of fire and, 
ultimately, post-fire forest structure. Historically, 
seedling establishment was more frequent in fire- 
created areas of bare mineral soil where competition 
with other vegetation and the abundance of surface fu-
els were reduced (Agee 1993; Cooper 1960; Stephens 
and others 2008). However, regeneration is less affect-
ed by the availability of bare mineral soil in some plant 
associations and soil types (Hanks and others 1983; 
USDA Forest Service 1997). A study in the Southwest 
showed a high density of tree regeneration on sites 
with one or more of the following: fine-textured soils, 
understories where screwleaf muhly was the dominant 
graminoid, and sites with high annual precipitation 
(Puhlick and others 2012). Depending on seed avail-
ability, some individuals and small groups of seedlings 
may establish throughout the stand, including under

tree groups (Abella 2008; Sánchez Meador and others 
2009; White 1985).
Tree seedlings that established in small forest open-
ings are subsequently thinned by later fires and/or 
other sources of mortality (Fig. 6) (Cooper 1960, 1961; 
Sánchez Meador and others 2010; Stephens and Fry 
2005; White 1985). Young tree groups in open areas 
reach fire-resistant sizes more rapidly than those be-
neath closed canopies (Fitzgerald 2005; Sackett and 
Hasse 1998; York and others 2004). Fire-caused thin-
ning of young tree groups was more substantial if the 
group was overtopped by older trees due to suppressed 
seedling growth and increased litter accumulation 
(Agee 1993; Cooper 1960). Fire-spread through young 
tree groups may also be influenced by microclimate 
and fuel moisture in these groups (Harrington 1982). 
As trees grow, increasing needle and twig accumula-
tions facilitate the spread of surface fire. Seedlings that 
establish some distance away from mature older trees 
are also more likely to survive fires due to less rapid 
accumulation of fine fuels and small branches from 
overstory trees (Fig. 5, 6), likely leading to less intense 
and severe fire (Cooper 1960) and variable spacing of 
tree groups. The seasonality and burning conditions of 
fire occurrence also result in variable outcomes.
Spatial Patterns: Formation and Maintenance
Spatial patterns of vegetation are a component of 
forest structure. The historical spatial mosaic of tree 
groups, scattered individual trees, and openings in 
frequent-fire forests was maintained by interactions 
among the locations and types of fuels, the frequency 
and severity of fire, and tree regeneration and mortality 
patterns. A landscape mosaic of tree groups and scat-
tered individual trees within an open grass-forb-shrub 
matrix, along with snags, logs, and woody debris, 
provides for the predominance of surface fire mixed 
with small-scale, variable fire behavior (e.g., torch-
ing). An open or grouped spatial structure reduces 
canopy continuity, decreasing a stand’s vulnerability 
to active crown fire (Fitzgerald 2005; Fulé and oth-
ers 2004; Roccaforte and others 2008; Stephens and 
others 2009). These interactions were mediated by 
small-scale variability in fire behavior and effects and 
often resulted in sites with aggregated tree regenera-
tion that were temporarily “free” or “safe” from fire 
(Larson and Churchill 2012). The location of some 
safe-sites for tree regeneration appeared to be related 
to local areas of previously more intense fire associ-
ated with accumulations of coarse woody debris (logs 
and other dead woody material greater than 3 inches 
in diameter) originating from the death of individual 
trees (Sánchez Meador and Moore 2010; West 1969; 
White 1985) or tree groups (Cooper 1960; Stephens 
and Fry 2005; Taylor 2010; West 1969). Death of in-
dividuals or groups of old trees create new snags and 
logs that, when consumed by fire, result in “safe” sites 
for tree regeneration. Extended fire-free periods may 
allow tree regeneration in areas not typically fire “safe” 
(Fig. 7) (Fulé and others 2009), resulting in temporal 
shifting of tree locations where new cohorts develop 
to fire-resistant sizes. The cyclic repetition of forest 
vegetation dynamics stemming from disturbances and 
tree regeneration perpetuates a shifting mosaic of tree 
groups and individual trees in different stages of devel-
opment in a grass-forb-shrub matrix (Fig. 8).

Figure 7. Ponderosa pine regeneration under a 
group of snags. This site is not currently fire 
“safe” due to the accumulation of surface 
fuels over an extended fire-free period. In the 
absence of fire, these seedlings could grow to 
fire-resistant sizes. If fire occurs prior to the 
trees attaining fire-resistant size, the seedlings 
would likely not survive. However, the 
reduction of surface fuels post-fire may create a 
temporary fire-safe site for future regeneration.
Insects and diseases also shape spatial patterns of 
forested landscapes. Due to the slow spread of infec-
tion, it has been suggested that the current distribution 
of mistletoe throughout the Southwest is likely similar 
to its historical distribution, although spatial continu-
ity and levels of infection may have changed (Conklin 
and Fairweather 2010). Under historical forest con-
ditions, it is likely that large-scale, contiguous insect 
and disease outbreaks would have been rare. It is more 
likely that mistletoe would have thrived in denser multi- 
storied portions of stands that escaped fire pruning and 
thinning (see Conklin and Geils 2008 for additional dis-
cussion). In such portions, periodic tree deaths would 
have occurred directly from mistletoe, or infected trees 
would have had increased the likelyhood of succumb-
ing to bark beetles or root disease. Localized mistletoe 
infections would have created pockets of tree death 
that could eventually serve as regeneration sites. In 
cases where regeneration occurred in larger openings 
between trees, trees may have escaped mistletoe infec-
tion altogether. Other scenarios can be envisioned. For 
instance, in cases of stands with relatively homogenous 
age and spacing, bark beetles may have had period-
ic population increases, causing high rates of local 
mortality. Localized beetle outbreaks likely occurred 
in stands with severe crown damage following fire 
(Breece and others 2008), and these infestations may 
have spilled over into undamaged trees nearby, creat-
ing larger openings. Root diseases also create scattered 
mortality, small openings, and increased volume of 
snags and downed large woody debris (Rippy and oth-
ers 2005).
An understanding of forest processes and their ef-
fects at different spatial scales is important because 
landscapes are spatially dependent (Turner 1989). 
Inferences about patterns and processes in forests are 
contingent upon the scale at which they are investigat-
ed. For example, a fine-scale model for ponderosa pine 
regeneration showed that the majority of the variance 
(76 percent) in seedling density was explained by prop-
erties such as soil texture and pH, precipitation, seed 
tree proximity, and composition of the plant commu-
nity (Puhlick and others 2012). However, at the mid- to 
landscape-scale, models including abiotic conditions 
and tree density at this broader scale accounted for less 

USDA Forest Service RMRS-GTR-310.  2013. 
11
of the variability in observed seedling densities (only 
13 percent) (Puhlick and others 2012). Fire further 
shapes tree spatial patterns at varying scales through 
its influence on seedling survival, with variability in 
the severity, seasonality, and frequency of fire (Cooper 
1960; Pearson 1950; Stephens and Fry 2005; Taylor 
2010; West 1969; White 1985). An overall aggregated 
(grouped) historical tree pattern separated by openings 
has been frequently reported in Southwestern fre-
quent-fire forests (Fig. 8) (Larson and Churchill 2012). 
However, Abella (2008), Binkley and others (2008), 
and Sánchez Meador and others (unpublished data, see 
Table 3 footnote) observed grouped and random (no 
aggregation) historical tree spatial patterns (Fig. 9). 
Schneider (2012) observed only random historical tree 
spatial patterns in Southwestern ponderosa pine.
Spatial heterogeneity can exist at any scale, and the 
value of metrics used to assess forest conditions varies 
in usefulness with scale. At mid- and landscape scales, 
elements such as single tree and group density become 
less useful as a metric and elements such as patches, the 
grass-forb-shrub matrix, stand density, canopy cover, 
and basal area become more appropriate. Patches are 
roughly synonymous with stands, being defined as 
an area of relatively homogeneous vegetation com-
position and structure differing from its surroundings 
(Forman 1995). Patches are the basic unit of the land-
scape, and their sources of variability are attributed to 
scale-appropriate factors such as elevation, topogra-
phy, climate, and land use. Our restoration framework 
describes forest composition, structure, and spatial pat-
terns at fine-, mid-, and landscape-scales (Fig. 1).
Southwestern Frequent-Fire Forests
The natural range of variability is a “best” esti-
mate of a resilient and functioning ecosystem because 
it reflects the evolutionary ecology of these forests. 
Natural range of variability is therefore a powerful 
science-based foundation for developing a framework 
for restoring the composition and structure of forests 
(Kaufmann and others 1994; Keane and others 2009; 
Moore and others 1999). The natural range of variabil-
ity can be estimated by pooling reference conditions 
across sites within a forest type. Reference conditions 
for a forest type typically vary from site to site due 
to differences in factors such as soil, elevation, slope, 
aspect, and micro-climate and manifests as differences 
in fire effects, tree densities, patterns of tree establish-
ment and persistence, and numbers and dispersion of 
snags and logs. When pooled, these sources of vari-
ability comprise the natural range of variability of a 
site or forest type.
Our estimates of natural ranges of variability are 
derived from multiple lines of evidence based on his-
torical ecology techniques (Egan and Howell 2001) 
such as written and oral historical records, historical 
photographs, early forest inventories, and dendrochro-
nological studies (Table 4). While cultural accounts 
and early inventories provide a general context of his-
torical conditions, they do not fully characterize forest 
structure by today’s statistical standards. More re-
cently, dendrochronological techniques for quantifying 
historical conditions, including spatial and temporal 
variation, have been developed (e.g., Covington and 
Moore 1994a; Covington and others 1997; Fulé and 
others 1997; Mast and others 1999; Sánchez Meador 
and others 2010; White 1985). Nonetheless, there is a 
clear need for additional reference condition data sets, 
including sites from a wider spectrum across envi-
ronmental gradients (e.g., soils, moisture, elevations, 
slopes, aspects) occupied by frequent-fire forests in the 
Southwest, especially in dry mixed-conifer. While the 
quantity of reference data sets is increasing, existing

data represent a largely unbalanced sampling across 
gradients (e.g., most data sets are from basaltic soils 
and on dry to typic plant associations), and there have 
been few studies quantitatively examining and report-
ing spatial patterns of trees and the sizes and shapes of 
grass-forb-shrub interspaces.
Ponderosa Pine
Woolsey (1911) described Southwestern ponderosa 
pine forests as having “…pure park-like stand(s) made 
up of scattered groups of 2-20 trees, usually connected 
by scattering individuals. Openings are frequent and 
vary in size. Because of the open character of the stand 
and the fire-resisting bark, often 3 inches thick, the ac-
tual loss in yellow (ponderosa) pine by fire is less than 
with other more gregarious species.” Others also de-
scribed historical ponderosa pine forests as having low 
density, open stands consisting of groups of pine trees 
interspersed with grassy or shrubby openings (Dutton 
1882; Lang and Stewart 1910; Pearson 1923; White 
1985).
Tree density, structure, spatial pattern, and ecologi-
cal functions in today’s ponderosa pine forests of the 
Southwest are greatly altered from their historical con-
ditions. Most Southwest ponderosa pine forests are at 
much greater risk of high-intensity, severe fire than they 
were prior to Euro-American settlement (Covington 
1993; Fulé and others 2004; Moore and others 1999; 
Roccaforte and others 2008). Historical ponderosa pine 
forests had widely spaced, large trees, typically occur-
ring in small groups with scattered single trees, and 
open forest conditions with a productive grass-forb-
shrub understory (Cooper 1960; Dutton 1882; Lang and 
Stewart 1910; Pearson 1923, 1950; Sánchez Meador and 
others 2009, 2011; White 1985). The grass-forb-shrub 
vegetation and other fine fuels and branches carried 
fires started by lightning and, to an uncertain extent, by 
Native Americans (Allen and others 2002; Kaye and 
Swetnam 1999). Forest composition, structure, and spa-
tial patterns were maintained by low-severity surface 
fires that occurred every 2-26 years (Fig. 3), rarely kill-
ing large trees, thinning regeneration, and maintaining 
an open forest structure (Dieterich 1980; Fiedler and 
others 1996; Fitzgerald 2005; Pearson 1950; Swetnam 
and Dieterich 1985; Weaver 1951; Woolsey 1911). Fire

Bark beetles also influenced pre-Euro-American pon-
derosa pine structure. Various sources indicate that bark 
beetle outbreaks occurred periodically in the Western 
United States since at least the 1750s (Bentz and others 
2009) and likely much longer. Current forested land-
scapes are experiencing outbreaks that are larger and 
more frequent than previously recorded (Lynch and 
others 2010). For example, bark beetles caused vari-
able amounts of mortality on more than 700,000 acres 
in Arizona and New Mexico in 2003 (Fettig and others 
2007; USDA Forest Service 2004). Although there is 
no direct evidence linking the effects of bark beetles 
to the structure of pre-Euro-American frequent-fire for-
ests, evidence from today’s beetle population dynamics 
suggests that homogenous, dense, even-aged stands 
are highly susceptible to beetle outbreaks (Fettig and 
others 2007; Negrón 1997). However, historical ob-
servations suggest that high-density, even-aged stand 
structures were infrequent or rare in frequent-fire for-
ests (Woolsey 1911; reviewed in Covington and Moore 
1994a, 1994b). Alternatively, spatial heterogeneity 
would have been promoted and maintained at the fine 
scale by bark beetle attacks on single or small groups 
of trees, or perhaps in high density groups or patches, 
which would have created growing space for regenera-
tion or surviving trees (Fettig 2012; Lundquist 1995; 
Von Schrenck 1903). During droughts, it was likely that 
many more trees would have succumbed to bark beetles 
(Bentz and others 2010; Negrón and others 2009). Bark 
beetles evolved under the range of natural variabil-
ity where there would have been sufficient hosts (e.g., 
fire-stressed, lightning struck, and broken top trees) 
to maintain endemic beetle populations (reviewed in 
Jenkins and others 2008 and Moeck and others 1981).
Ponderosa Pine: Species Composition: Ponderosa 
pine is the dominant seral and climax tree species in 
Southwest ponderosa pine forests. Depending on lo-
cale, ponderosa pine forests may also have a mix of 
Gamble oak, evergreen oaks, junipers, pinyon pines 
(DeVelice and others 1986), with occasional presence 
of quaking aspen, New Mexico locust, Douglas-fir, or 
southwestern white pine. Ponderosa pine is one of the 
most fire-adapted conifer species in the West, and its 
resistance to surface fire increases as trees age (Miller 
2000).
Composition of the grass-forb-shrub community 
in ponderosa pine forests is typically diverse, espe-
cially in open interspaces between trees (e.g., Fig. 8) 
(Abella and others 2011; Laughlin and others 2006; 
Moir 1966; Naumburg and DeWald 1999). Ponderosa 
pine plant associations (classified by understory plant 
assemblages, plant succession, and co-dominant tree 
species) are variable and are reflective of local bio-
physical site and climate conditions that both influence 
the type of disturbances and vegetation responses to 
disturbances (Table 5) (USDA Forest Service 1997). 
Southwestern ponderosa pine plant associations range 
from pure ponderosa pine to mixed tree species over-
stories with understories ranging from bunchgrass/
forb to shrub-dominated types, and these can be 
broadly grouped into four forest subtypes: (1) ponder-
osa pine-bunchgrass, (2) ponderosa pine-Gambel oak, 
(3) ponderosa pine-evergreen oak, and (4) ponderosa 
pine-shrub (Appendix 2). The most mesic sites are the 
ponderosa pine-Gambel oak and some ponderosa pine-
bunchgrass plant associations; the most xeric sites are 
the ponderosa pine-evergreen oak and some ponderosa 
pine-shrub plant associations. Bunchgrass plant associ-
ations generally occupy the mid-range of the moisture 
gradient for ponderosa pine forests in the Southwest.
Understory composition includes various com-
binations of grasses, forbs, shrubs, ferns, and cacti 
depending upon plant associations (Korb and Springer 
2003; USDA Forest Service 1997), all of which con-
tribute to the biodiversity found in frequent-fire forests 
(Laughlin and others 2006). The growth habit (e.g., 
bunchgrass, sod, or shrub) and spatial patterns of the 
understory influence the establishment and growth of 
trees (Biondi 1996; Boyden and others 2005; Sánchez 
Meador and others 2009; Youngblood and others 2004) 
and provide wildlife habitats (Dodd and others 2006; 
Reynolds and others 1992; Waltz and Covington 2003; 
Wightman and Germaine 2006; USDA Forest Service 
1997). Variation in species composition among plant 
associations within forest subtypes influences forest 
dynamics. For example, within the ponderosa pine 
bunchgrass subtype, tree regeneration establishes 
rapidly following disturbance on sites with screwleaf 
muhly plant associations (the most mesic associations 
in the bunchgrass subtype), episodically on Arizona 
fescue plant associations (the typic associations in 
the bunchgrass subtype), and sparsely on blue grama 
plant associations (the most xeric associations in the 
bunchgrass subtype) (USDA Forest Service 1997). 
Tree establishment often occurs differently in shrub- 
dominated plant associations than in bunchgrass types, 
where rapid re-sprouting of shrub species (e.g., shrub 
live oak) following disturbances may inhibit pine re-
generation. Other re-sprouting shrubs (e.g., New 
Mexico locust) are nitrogen-fixers and have been shown 
to facilitate pine seedling establishment (Fisher and

Fulé 2004; USDA Forest Service 1997). Fire may also  
facilitate establishment of tree regeneration on sites 
with non-sprouting shrub species (e.g., black or 
big sagebrush species) by removing competition. 
Together, trees and the grass-forb-shrub community 
affect below- and aboveground microclimates (i.e., 
soil moisture, nutrients, etc.) as well as ecological 
processes and functions such as biodiversity, trophic 
interactions, food webs, disturbances, and hydrology 
(Abella 2009; Arnold 1950; Barth 1980; Covington 
and others 1997; Kalies and others 2012; Moir 1966; 
Parker and Muller 1982; Scholes and Archer 1997) (see 
Expected Outcomes of Framework Implementation). 
Environmental variables such as light intensity, soil 
pH, soil and litter depth, and percent litter cover are 
directly influenced by the presence of tree canopy 
cover (Evenson and others 1980). For example, Abella 
(2009) reported that understory species richness was 
greater and plant cover was up to eight times greater in 
openings than under tree canopies in a ponderosa pine/
Gamble oak forest.
Mycorrhizal fungi are important species in ponder-
osa pine and play an important role in plant nutrition, 
nutrient cycling, soil structure, and food webs (Carey 
2003; Johnson and others 1997). Two Arizona studies 
reported higher densities of mycorrhizal propagules in 
areas where grass cover was greater and tree cover was 
less, such as in areas following mechanical treatments 
and burning, and that increased light and soil moisture 
in restored stands likely increased photosynthesis and 
mycorrhizal infection (Korb and others 2003; Korb 
and Springer 2003). Other studies show that abundant 
arbuscular mycorrhizae can increase plant diversity 
and overall community structure (Klironomos and oth-
ers 2000; van der Heijden and others 1998). Arbuscular 
mycorrhizae are particularly important in grass- 
dominated ecosystems (Dhillion and Anderson 1993; 
Koske and Gemma 1997), but little is known of their 
status in the grass-forb-shrub community in ponderosa 
forests (Korb and Springer 2003).
Ponderosa Pine: Forest Structure: Structure in pon-
derosa pine forests emanates from the vertical and 
horizontal arrangement of trees and grass-forb-shrub 
species. Specifically, the vertical and horizontal ar-
chitecture of a forest arises from variations in tree 
and grass-forb-shrub species and their ages, heights, 
crown spreads, densities, and spatial heterogeneity. 
Human activities since the late 19th Century resulted 
in changes to forest structure due to a reduction in fire 
frequency causing tree density and surface fuel load 
increases (Moore and others 2004; Naficy and others 
2010; Parsons and DeBenedetti 1979; Scholl and Taylor 
2010). For example, Moore and others (2004) reported 
a mean tree density increase by a factor of almost 7 (32-
208 trees per acre) between 1909 and the 1990s. Tree 
encroachment into grass-forb-shrub forest openings 
has resulted in a decline in percent cover, abundance, 
and biodiversity of open grass-forb-shrub communi-
ties (Abella 2009; Bogan and others 1998; Clary 1975; 
Covington and Moore 1994b; Moore and others 2006; 
Moore and Deiter 1992; Swetnam and others 1999).
Differences in reference conditions for tree densi-
ties have been reported for fine- versus coarse-textured 
soils (Abella and Denton 2009; Puhlick 2011). Average 
plot-level reference conditions in ponderosa pine on 
basalt soils ranged between 0-220 trees per acre and 
33-83 square ft per acre of basal area while sites on 
coarse-textured soils (primarily limestone) ranged be-
tween 8 and 262 trees per acre and 22 and 89 square 
ft per acre of basal area (Table 6; Fig. 10). In general, 
ranges reported for reference tree densities on coarse-
textured soils were higher than those reported on 
fine-textured soils (Table 6). The minimum diameters 
reported in Table 6 may also result in a source of error 
that can lead to small underestimates of historical tree 
densities reported in studies. Additional error may re-
sult from missing fully decomposed structures at time 
of measurement and reconstruction (Fulé and others 
1997; Mast and others 1999; Moore and others 2004).
To date, only six studies report tree spatial reference 
conditions in the Southwestern ponderosa pine for-
ests. Based on these studies, the historical conditions 
in ponderosa pine exhibited as many as 67 tree groups 
per acre. Tree groups ranged between 0.003 and 0.72 
acres in size and were composed of 2-72 trees (Table 3; 
Fig. 4). Tree groups were separated by grass-forb-shrub 
openings of variable sizes and shapes that contained 
scattered individual trees (Fig. 8). The proportion of 
the stand or mid-scale area not covered by vertical 
projections of tree crowns (referred to as “openness”) 
has received little attention. However, several studies 
have reported the inverse of openness—canopy cover 
(Table 7); White (1985), Covington and Sackett (1986), 
and Covington and others (1997) reported 21.9, 19.0, 
and 17.3 percent canopy cover for ponderosa pine stand 
reference conditions on the Fort Valley Experimental 
Forest, Arizona, respectively. A nearby study of a re-
constructed ponderosa pine/Gambel oak site on the 
Coconino National Forest, Arizona, reported a range of 
10.2-18.8 percent canopy cover (Sánchez Meador and 
others 2011). Fulé and others (2002) reported an average 
canopy cover of 48.3 percent for the Rainbow Plateau, 
an area in the Grand Canyon National Park-North Rim

where the authors suggested that contemporary condi-
tions were statistically similar to historical reference 
conditions as determined by basal area comparisons. A 
reference condition study conducted in ponderosa pine 
near Cheeseman Lake, Colorado, reported a range of 
12.9-21.5 percent canopy cover (Fornwalt and others 
2002). Overall, the range of canopy cover for ponderosa 
pine for these studies was about 10-50 percent, giving 
reference conditions for openness (i.e., inverse of can-
opy cover) of 50-90 percent. If areas with strong tree 
aggregation (i.e., with interlocking crowns; Fig. 11) ex-
hibit lower mid-scale canopy cover (10.2-21.9 percent; 
Table 7), then it stands to reason that sites with less tree 
aggregation would have higher mid-scale canopy cover 
due to tree arrangement and reduced crown overlap 
(Christopher and Goodburn 2008).
Snags, logs, and woody debris are important struc-
tural and functional elements in frequent-fire forests 
(Figs. 12 and 13), yet little is known about volumes 
of coarse woody debris under historical fire regimes. 
Nonetheless, studies using extensive, historical stem-
maps and/or locations of historical evidences (e.g., logs,

2.7 logs per acre (Moore and others 2004), 1-8 snags 
and 3-23 logs per acre (Sánchez Meador and others

abundance of snags and logs varied with site and likely 
coincided with the type, severity, and scale of historical 
disturbance.
Dry Mixed-Conifer
Mixed conifer forests can be divided into two sub-
types: a warm-dry (dry mixed-conifer) type and a 
cool-moist (wet mixed-conifer) type. Dry mixed-co-
nifer forests are similar to ponderosa pine forests in 
general stand structure, but Douglas fir, white fir, white 
pines, and, occasionally, blue spruce are also important 
components of these forests (Fig. 14). Wet mixed-
conifer forests typically lack ponderosa pine, have a 
greater abundance of Douglas-fir and white fir, and, 
on some sites, include other fire-intolerant and shade- 
tolerant species such as blue spruce, subalpine/corkbark 
fir, and Engelmann spruce (Fig. 2). Dry mixed-conifer 
forests typically occupy the lower, warmer, and drier 
end of the elevation zone occupied by mixed-conifer 
forests. They intergrade with the cool/moist ponderosa 
pine types on warmer/drier sites at the lower end of the 
mixed-conifer zone and with wet mixed-conifer for-
ests on cooler/moister sites at the upper end of the zone 
(Korb and others 2013; Romme and others 2009; Smith 
and others 2008).
Dry mixed-conifer forests intergrade with or are ad-
jacent to pure ponderosa pine forests and experience 
similar site conditions and ecological disturbances 
(types and frequencies) (Grissino-Mayer and others 
1995). Romme and others (2009) suggested that the 
stand structure of dry mixed-conifer was maintained 
in part by recurrent fires of relatively low to moderate 
Figure 12. Snags, logs, and woody debris are important 
components of frequent-fire forests. They provide structural 
diversity, nutrient cycling, and wildlife habitat.

severity, although small areas of higher-severity crown 
fire were likely. While only a few studies report the ex-
tent of mixed-severity fires (Romme and others 2009), 
Fulé and others (2009) found no areas of high-severity 
fire larger than 158 acres as inferred by the current ex-
tent and presence of even-aged structures or early seral 
species.
Dry mixed-conifer forests occur on relatively warm 
sites at lower elevations or on southerly aspects at higher 
elevations and are characterized by historical frequent 
surface-fires synchronized by climate (approximately 
9-30 years) (Brown and others 2001; Brown and Wu 
2005; Fulé and others 2003, 2009; Grissino-Mayer and 
others 2004; Heinlein and others 2005). In contrast, wet 
mixed-conifer is typified by mixed-severity fire regime 
(Fulé and others 2003). Many studies based on fire-
scarred trees show that dry mixed-conifer forests had 
frequent but variable fire return intervals. Some studies 
report fire return intervals that were similar to pon-
derosa pine, as frequently as every 4-14 years (Brown 
and others 2001; Touchan and others 1996; reviewed in 
Evans and others 2011), whereas other dry mixed-co-
nifer forests experienced fires as infrequently as every 
18-32 years (Fulé and others 2003; Korb and others 
2013; Touchan and others 1996; reviewed in Evans and 
others 2011). A recent study in Southwestern Colorado 
warm/dry mixed conifer forests found a mean fire re-
turn interval ranging from 9-30 years on three different 
sites at similar latitude and elevation. Korb and others 
(2013) also showed significant influence of local site 
factors (e.g., topography, forest structure, and species 
composition) on fire frequency and severity. Departures 
from historical compositions, structures, and spatial 
patterns are likely greater on the warmer/drier than the 
cooler/wetter portion of the mixed-conifer environ-
mental gradient due to a more severe disruption of the 
characteristic fire regime (Fulé and others 2002).
When direct evidence of historical fire regime is lack-
ing (i.e., fire scars not present), plant associations that 
classify seral and climax species composition relative 
to the shade and fire tolerance of tree species and bio-
physical site conditions may assist in making inferences 
regarding fire regimes (see Tables 2 and 8). Openings in 
dry mixed-conifer include grasses, forbs, shrubs, ferns, 
and cacti (Korb and Springer 2003), but the specific as-
semblage of understory plants varies greatly by plant 
association, being broadly grouped as dominated by 
bunchgrasses or by forbs/shrubs (Table 8). Bunchgrass-
dominated plant associations in dry mixed-conifer 
forests generally occur in warmer/drier conditions than 
sites dominated by forbs and shrub understories (e.g. 
white fir/Arizona fescue [warm/dry] compared to white 
fir/forest fleabane [cool/moist]; Table 8). For example, 
the U.S. Forest Service, Southwestern Region utilizes 
plant association classifications for mapping the spatial 
extent of dry and wet mixed-conifer forests on National 
Forest Lands.
Dry Mixed-Conifer: Species Composition: Due to a 
predominance of frequent, low-severity fire, historical 
species composition in dry mixed-conifer forests was 
dominated by fire-resistant, shade-intolerant conifers 
such as ponderosa pine, Southwestern white pine, and 
Douglas-fir (Fig. 2) (Evans and others 2011; Fulé and 
others 2003). Dry mixed-conifer forests occur in envi-
ronments that are wet enough to support trees such as 
white fir and aspen. However, these species are also more 
susceptible to death from fire than fire-resistant pines 
and Douglas-fir (Fig. 2) (Evans and others 2011; Fulé 
and others 2003). Consequently, species composition 
in dry mixed-conifer forests was historically regulated 
by the balance between climate and disturbance agents 
such as fire. Periods of frequent fire in mixed-conifer 
gave fire-resistant species a competitive advantage, al-
lowing them to establish dominance. During “fire-free” 
or less frequent-fire periods, ponderosa pine persisted 

USDA Forest Service RMRS-GTR-310.  2013. 
23
due to its dominant positions in the forest canopy (Fulé 
and others 2009). As a result, shade-tolerant, less fire-
resistant species were historically minor components 
on drier sites, such as ridge tops and southwest-facing 
slopes, and likely more frequent on cooler and/or more 
mesic sites in frequent-fire forests, such as drainages 
and north-facing slopes (Fig. 15) (Romme and others 
2009).
Compared to early 1900s Southwestern forest in-
ventories, the current species composition of dry 
mixed-conifer forests has shifted toward more shade-
tolerant, less fire-resistant species (Fulé and others 
2009; Johnson 1994; Romme and others 2009). For 
example, one study in northern Arizona found that 
ponderosa pine represented an average 64 percent of 
basal area in the 1870 forest (range 54-69 percent) but 
only 36 percent in the same forest in 2003 (range 27-
46 percent) (Fulé and others 2009). A recent study in 
Southwestern Colorado found that species composition 
prior to the last fire record on two different sites (1861 
and 1878) was dominated by ponderosa pine, but white 
fir and Douglas-fir increased in dominance since the 
cessation of fire (Korb and others 2013). Other stud-
ies similarly concluded that extended fire exclusion 
in dry mixed-conifer forests resulted in substantial 
increases in stand-level tree density, especially by shade- 
tolerant white fir and Douglas-fir (Fulé and others 2004; 
Heinlein and others 2005). These increases resulted in 
forests with greater homogeneity in species composi-
tion across landscapes (Cocke and others 2005; White 
and Vankat 1993). Furthermore, early selective logging 
of ponderosa pine and intensive grazing exacerbated 
the compositional shift toward mesic species (Cocke 
and others 2005). The combination of fire exclusion, 
grazing, selective logging, and favorable climatic con-
ditions for young tree establishment in the early 20th 
Century has created atypical stand compositions and 
structures in many of today’s dry mixed-conifer forests

(Moore and others 2004). In many locations, large, 
dominant ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir trees have 
been reduced to few or none, leaving today’s stands 
dominated by young ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, and 
white fir (Fulé and others 2003).
Dry mixed-conifer plant associations are highly vari-
able and reflective of local biophysical site conditions 
that influence the type of disturbances and vegetation 
responses to disturbances (Table 8) (USDA Forest 
Service 1997). These plant associations are classified 
by forest series representing the most shade-tolerant 
conifer species that can establish and grow on a given 
site, absent disturbance. However, ponderosa pine typi-
cally dominates the species mix in dry mixed-conifer 
forest series under the characteristic fire regime. Dry 
mixed-conifer forest series include: (1) Douglas-fir, (2) 
white fir, and (3) those blue spruce plant associations 
that do not classify as wet mixed-conifer. These series 
can be subdivided by understory plant composition into 
the general subtypes of bunchgrass and forb-shrub. 
The most mesic dry mixed-conifer sites are the forb-
shrub plant associations, and the most xeric are the 
bunchgrass plant associations. These subtypes differ in 
their relative fire frequencies; bunchgrass understories 
support more frequent surface fire, while forb-shrub un-
derstories facilitate less frequent surface fire and greater 
fuel accumulation (Anderson 1982; LANDFIRE 2007; 
Scott and Burgan 2005; USDA Forest Service 1997).
Dry Mixed-Conifer: Forest Structure: Compared to 
ponderosa pine, there is considerably less literature on 
fine-scale forest structure and spatial pattern reference 
conditions in dry mixed-conifer forests. However, there 
are some historical references to similarities between 
structure and spatial pattern of these two forest types. 
Due to its frequent fire regime, the historical fine-scale 
structure and spatial pattern of dry mixed-conifer for-
ests were similar to ponderosa pine in having a more 
open structure (Muldavin and Tonne 2003; Swetnam 
and Baisan 1996) and a similar aggregated arrange-
ment of trees in some stands (Binkley and others 2008; 
Sánchez Meador and others unpublished data, see Table 
3 footnote). Lang and Stewart (1910; p. 19) noted that 
“evidence indicates light ground fires over practically 
the whole forest, some of the finest stands of yellow 
pine show only slight charring of the bark and very little 
damage to poles and undergrowth.” Dutton (1882) ob-
served that within both the ponderosa pine and mixed 
ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir forest types “the trees are 
large and noble in aspect and stand widely apart, except 
in the highest parts of the [Kaibab] plateau where the 
spruces predominate. Instead of dense thickets where 
we are shut in by impenetrable foliage, we can look far 
beyond and see the tree trunks vanishing away like an 
infinite colonnade.” These observations are consistent 
with statements that “pure ponderosa pine forests and 
warm-dry mixed conifer forests were affected primar-
ily by frequent, low-severity fires that maintained an 
open stand structure with a broad range of tree sizes 
and ages” (Romme and others 2009).
Empirical evidence also indicates that historical dry 
mixed-conifer forests had lower tree densities and a 
more open structure comprised of a higher proportion 
of old and large trees, were more spatially heteroge-
neous (having groups and patches of trees), and were 
more uneven-aged compared to current conditions 
(Fig.16) (Binkley and others 2008; Fulé and others 
2002a, 2003, 2009; Heinlein and others 2005; Moore 
and others 2004). However, as mixed conifer forests 
transition toward cooler and wetter site conditions, less 
frequent and more severe fires result in mixtures of 
even- and uneven-aged forest structures. At the land-
scape scale, wet mixed-conifer forests were historically 
more spatially heterogeneous than ponderosa pine for-
ests because of a mixed-severity fire regime affected 
by topography, soils, land use, and vegetation (Binkley 
and others 2008; Fulé and others 2002a, 2003, 2009; 
Muldavin and Tonne 2003; Smith 2006a; Romme and 
others 2009; Touchan and others 1996). Variable for-
est structures and spatial patterns across landscapes

27
resulted, in part, from variation among sites on the 
temperature/moisture continuum and their species com-
positions, successional status, and disturbance regimes. 
Warm, dry mixed-conifer sites likely experienced more 
frequent and less severe surface fire, resulting in more 
open forests with a mixture of small tree groups and ar-
eas with random tree spatial patterns. In contrast, cool, 
moist sites experienced mixed or high-severity fires at 
longer fire return intervals, resulting in relatively closed 
forests with tree cohorts distributed in larger patches 
(Fig. 14) (Fulé and others 2003; Romme and others 
2009).
Studies of reference conditions for dry mixed- 
conifer forests reported mean tree densities and basal 
areas similar to those in ponderosa pine stands but with 
slight increases at the fine scale (Table 9; Fig. 17). For 
example, pre-Euro-American settlement dry mixed-co-
nifer forests on limestone soils ranged between 36 and 
100 trees per acre and 34 and 124 square ft of basal area 
per acre on sites in Arizona and New Mexico, respec-
tively (Table 9; Fig. 10). For dry mixed-conifer forests 
on the Uncompahgre Plateau in Colorado, Binkley and 
others (2008) reported reference conditions for canopy 
cover ranging from 12.0-21.5 percent in areas that ex-
hibit fine-scale aggregation; openness was therefore 
78.5-88.0 percent in these areas. Fornwalt and others 
(2002) modeled reference canopy cover conditions 
of 13-22 percent (78-87 percent openness) for forests 
with fine-scale tree aggregation on the Colorado Front 
Range (Table 7). Based on reported studies, historical 
dry mixed-conifer forests were structurally similar to 
ponderosa pine with respect to tree groups with small 
meadows between them (Binkley and others 2008).
Abundance of snags, logs, and woody debris in 
dry mixed-conifer was likely similar to or slightly 
greater than that of ponderosa pine. Moore and oth-
ers (2004) reported 4.9-34.9 snags per acre for dry 
mixed-conifer reference conditions as determined from 
extensive, historical stem-maps and relocation of histor-
ical evidences (e.g., logs, stumps, and snags). While the 
historical amount of these structural elements in dry mixed- 
conifer has received little attention, contemporary stud-
ies suggest that more productive dry mixed-conifer sites 
had higher fuel loads than ponderosa pine sites (Brown 
and others 2003; Graham and others 1994).
Despite the above similarities, dry mixed-conifer 
forests occur on a diverse range of sites and have more 
diversity in species composition, structure (Fig. 17), 
spatial pattern, processes (i.e., fire regimes and other 
disturbances), and functions than ponderosa pine for-
ests. While studies demonstrate considerable similarity 
between dry mixed-conifer and ponderosa pine distur-
bance processes and forest structures, we point again 
to the limited numbers and geographical locations of 
studies of historic structural conditions in dry mixed-
conifer and call for additional research to increase our 
understanding of historical ranges of conditions for 
these forests (see Monitoring, Adaptive Management, 
and Research Needs).

Here, we describe our framework for restoring re-
siliency to frequent-fire forests in the Southwest. We 
first provide an overview of our framework, includ-
ing its ecological foundation, its key elements, and the 
sources of its science base. We then discuss the spatial 
and temporal scales at which forest structures are de-
scribed, and follow this with a description of the de-
sired key compositional and structural elements of a 
restored forest at those scales for ponderosa pine and 
then dry mixed-conifer forests. Finally, we provide 
recommendations for implementing the framework in 
these forests and finish with brief before and after de-
scriptions of the composition and structure in a ponder-
osa pine area in New Mexico where we implemented 
our framework.
The framework is organized around key composi-
tional and structural elements at three spatial scales and 
is based on a synthesis of reference conditions, litera-
ture on the ecology of frequent-fire forests (Table 4) 
(see Science Review: Forest Ecology), our understand-
ing of the ecology of these forests, decades of collective 
experience of forest managers and researchers (e.g., 
Schubert 1974), and lessons learned during applica-
tions of our framework in Southwestern frequent-fire 
forests. Our framework is informed by the ranges of 
mean forest characteristics from reference conditions 
research plots, which were typically <10 acres and 
therefore best describe variability at the fine scale 
(Tables 3, 6, 7, and 9). Means across plots are more 
representative of mid-scale conditions than means re-
ported for individual sample plots. Therefore, we point 
out that any point estimates with a range of mean values 
may not be appropriate for a given site and we recom-
mend using local, site-specific biophysical conditions 
and historical evidences to inform specific treatments.
Forest ecology, historical (reference) conditions, 
and the natural range of variability are frequently used 
to define restoration goals, to estimate the restoration 
potential of sites, and to evaluate the success of resto-
ration efforts. Natural range of variability is useful for 
understanding the natural variability in composition, 
structure, processes, and functions among sites and for 
understanding the dynamic nature of ecosystems. It is 
also a useful reference for establishing limits of accept-
able change for ecosystem components and processes 
(Morgan and others 1994). Our framework is not intend-
ed to re-create specific reference conditions. Rather, the 
framework identifies key elements that characterized 
frequent-fire forests before industrial logging and the 
disruption of historical disturbance regimes. These key 
compositional and structural elements are:
(1) species composition (tree and understory 
vegetation);
(2) groups of trees;
(3) scattered individual trees;
(4) open grass-forb-shrub interspaces;
(5) snags, logs, and woody debris; and
(6) variation in arrangements of these elements in 
space and time.
The key elements provide inferences about species 
compositions, structural conditions, and the cumula-
tive effects of disturbances on processes and functions 
that provide frequent-fire forests with resistance and 
resilience to disturbance.
Citations supporting our restoration framework ap-
pear mostly in the Science Review: Forest Ecology 
section but in other sections as needed. We recognize 
the limited number and geographic extent of scientif-
ic studies of reference conditions for ponderosa pine 
and especially for dry mixed-conifer, not only in the 
Southwest but throughout the western United States. 
Nonetheless, our framework is timely because of the 
growth in knowledge over the past decades regard-
ing current and historical ecology of these forests. It 
is also timely because of increased frequencies, in-
tensities, and extents of uncharacteristic disturbances, 
which may worsen under climate change (Littell and 
others 2009; Millar and others 2007; Miller and oth-
ers 2009; Westerling and others 2006). We believe that 
moving current forest conditions toward their charac-
teristic compositions, structures, and spatial patterns 
will increase their resistance and resilience to future 
disturbances and will result in outcomes as varied as 
fire fuels reduction, restoration of wildlife habitats, 
biodiversity, diverse food webs, and increased ability 
of these forests to provide ecosystem services.
Spatial and Temporal Scales
Ecosystems are structured hierarchically and their 
composition, structure, process, and function are 
temporally and spatially dynamic. Therefore, we 
characterize the key compositional and structural ele-
ments at three spatial scales: the fine-scale (<10 acres),

mid-scale (10-1000 acres), and landscape-scale 
(1000-10,000+ acres) (Fig. 1). These scales generally 
correspond with structural features in frequent-fire for-
ests. For example, the fine scale is an area in which 
the species composition, age, structure, and spatial 
distribution of trees (single and grouped), and open 
grass-forb-shrub interspaces are expressed. Aggregates 
of fine-scale units comprise mid-scale units, which are 
referred to as patches (i.e., stands) and are relatively 
homogeneous in vegetation composition and struc-
ture that differ from their surroundings. The landscape 
scale is composed of aggregates of mid-scale units and 
usually has variable elevations, slopes, aspects, soil 
types, plant associations, disturbance processes, and 
land uses. Understanding and incorporating temporal 
scales (seasonal, annual, decadal, and centuries) in a 
restoration framework is required to sustain vegetation 
dynamics of a forest that result from growth, succes-
sion, senescence, and the natural and anthropogenic 
disturbances that periodically reset the dynamics.
Key Elements by Forest Type: Ponderosa Pine
Southwest ponderosa pine forests occur at eleva-
tions ranging from approximately 5000-9000 ft and 
typically intergrade with woodland types on warm/dry 
sites (typically at lower elevations) and mixed-conifer 
types on cool/moist sites (typically at higher eleva-
tions). The characteristic fire regime for ponderosa pine 
is frequent, low-severity fires (Fire Regime 1; Table 2). 
Surface fuels (fine fuels, branches, and coarse woody 
debris) and small trees facilitate this fire regime. Fires 
burn primarily on the forest floor and rarely spread 
to tree crowns and canopies. Individual trees or tree 
groups may occasionally torch during fires. Based on 
plant associations, a system for classifying plant com-
munities on their potential climax species compositions 
(Table 5) (USDA Forest Service 1997), we differentiat-
ed four Southwestern ponderosa pine forests subtypes: 
(1) ponderosa pine-bunchgrass, (2) ponderosa pine-
Gambel oak, (3) ponderosa pine-evergreen oak, and 
(4) ponderosa pine-shrub (Appendix 2).
Ponderosa Pine: Fine-Scale Elements (<10 acres):
Species composition: Overstories are dominated 
by ponderosa pine but may occasionally contain other 
conifer or hardwood species. Herbaceous understories 
are typically grasses and forbs at the mid-point within 
the temperature/moisture gradient over which ponder-
osa pine occurs. At the warm/dry end of the gradient, 
ponderosa pine forest intergrades with pinyon-juniper 
or evergreen oak woodlands (e.g., juniper, pinyon, 
Emory oak, Arizona white oak, silverleaf oak, and grey 
oak) with a shrub component (e.g., manzanita, shrub 
live oak, sumac, or mountain mahogany). In the cool/
moist portion of the gradient, Gambel oak is often a 
component of ponderosa pine forests, and grass and 
forb understories may include shrubs (e.g., ceanothus, 
and currants) (Table 5). At the cool/moist end of the 
gradient, ponderosa pine intergrades with dry mixed-
conifer forests where there may be a minor presence 
of quaking aspen, Douglas-fir, Southwestern white 
pine, white fir, and blue spruce. Variation in overstory 
species composition influences forest structure, distur-
bance types and intensities, tree mortality rates, and 
the composition and structure of the grass-forb-shrub 
community.
• Trees typically occur in irregularly shaped, small 
groups with interlocking or nearly interlocking 
crowns when in the mid- to old-aged structures 
(Fig. 11), range in size from 2-72 trees, and occupy 
between 0.003 and 0.72 acres each (Table 3; Fig. 4). 
Groups can be even- or uneven-aged. Size, shape, 
number of trees per group, and number of groups 
per area are variable (see Science Review: Forest 
Ecology). If trees are aggregated (i.e., grouped), 
more productive sites will have more trees per 
group, and if not aggregated, will support more in-
dividual trees per acre. Where groups are even-aged, 
a high level of interspersion of groups of differing 
ages constitutes the desired uneven-aged structure 
at the fine- and mid-scale. Trees within groups are 
variably spaced with some tight clumps.
• Where reference conditions show the presence of 
scattered individual trees, their ages are variable 
(young to old) and they can comprise 15-70 percent 
of total stand basal area, with the remaining stand 
basal area being trees in groups (Table 3). Variability 
in number of individual trees is associated with vari-
ous factors, such as soils, plant associations, climate, 
and disturbances.
• Grass-forb-shrub interspaces surround tree groups 
and individual trees (Fig. 8) and are variably shaped 
and sized.
• Snags, top-killed, lightning- and fire-scarred trees, 
and coarse woody debris (logs and other dead 
woody material greater than 3 inches in diameter) 
are generally large in diameter and height, scattered 
throughout the mid-scale, and concentrated in past 
disturbance sites in abundances of 1-10 snags and 
3-10 tons per acre (Figs. 12 and 13). Overall, snags, 
logs, and coarse woody debris are spatially and tem-
porally variable.

Ponderosa Pine: Mid-Scale Elements  
(10-1000 acres):
The mid-scale is an aggregate of fine-scale units 
(i.e., tree groups, scattered individual trees, and grass-
forb-shrub interspaces) and is collectively referred to 
as a patch or stand. Mid-scale patches are relatively 
homogeneous in vegetation composition and structure 
and differ from surrounding patches.
• Tree species composition is relatively homogenous 
within patches and is a function of disturbance, time 
since disturbance, tree density and size/age struc-
ture, topography, soils, local climate, site history, 
ecological legacy, and stochasticity (e.g., mass seed-
ing and weather events).
• Average total tree densities and basal areas generally 
range from 11-124 trees per acre and 22-90 square ft 
of basal area per acre (Table 6).
• More productive sites may have more trees per area. 
Aggregates of many randomly distributed trees (ar-
eas >10 acres) function as patches.
• For sustainability and biodiversity purposes, it is de-
sirable that patches comprise uneven-aged forests 
with an approximate balance of age classes ranging 
from young to old (Fig. 18). Infrequently, patches of 
even-aged forest structure may be present.
• All age classes of appropriate hardwood species (e.g., 
Gambel and evergreen oaks and other hardwoods) 
are present depending on a site’s plant association 
(Table 5).
• “Openness” (estimated as the inverse of canopy cov-
er) ranges from 52-90 percent. In areas exhibiting 
fine-scale aggregation of trees, mid-scale openness 
is typically high (78-90 percent; Table 7), and on 
more productive sites, especially where tree ar-
rangement is random, openness may be less (see 
discussion of openness in Science Review: Forest 
Ecology).
Ponderosa Pine: Landscape-Scale Elements  
(1000-10,000+ acres):
• The landscape scale is an aggregate of mid-scale 
units and includes areas with variable topography 
(i.e., elevation, slope, and aspect), soils, plant as-
sociations, disturbance types, and land use legacies. 
The landscape is a functioning ecosystem that con-
tains all components, processes, and functions that 
result from characteristic disturbances, including 
snags, downed logs, and old trees.
• Old-growth structural features occur throughout 
the landscape as tree groups or single trees within 
uneven-aged patches (stands) or occassionally as 
small even-aged patches. Old-growth structural fea-
tures include old trees, snags, downed wood (coarse 
woody debris), and horizontal and vertical structur-
al diversity in a grass-forb-shrub matrix (Table 10; 
Fig. 9). The location of old-growth structural fea-
tures may shift on the landscape over time as a result 
of succession and disturbance.

tree groups of different ages.

quaking aspen, and other hardwoods, with a lesser 
presence of shade-tolerant species such as white fir and 
blue spruce depending on biophysical site conditions 
and the frequency of low-severity fire. Aspen may oc-
cur individually or in groups of variable size. While 
less is known about historical conditions in dry mixed-
conifer than in ponderosa pine, available information 
shows a similarity in the structure and spatial pattern 
of these two forest types.
Characteristic fire regimes for Southwestern dry 
mixed-conifer are frequent low-severity fires (Fire 
Regime 1) with infrequent mixed-severity fires (Fire 
Regime 3; Table 2) operating at all spatial scales. 
Surface fuels and small trees facilitate this fire regime. 
While fires burn primarily on the forest floor, occasion-
ally individual trees or tree groups may torch. Crown 
fires rarely spread from tree group to tree group.
Dry Mixed-Conifer: Fine-Scale Elements  
(<10 acres)
• Species composition: Overstories are dominated by 
fire-resistant, shade-intolerant trees such as pon-
derosa pine, Douglas-fir, Southwestern white pine, 
and limber pine, with occasional inclusion of aspen 
and other hardwoods. Shade-tolerant conifers, such 
as white fir and blue spruce, may be present but are 
subdominant in abundance. At the warm/dry end of

Table 10. Essential structural features of old growth in frequent-fire forests. Note that whether or not a feature is essential may 
depend on scale—fine-, mid-, and landscape-scale. For example, age variability is possible at all scales, but snags and 
large dead and downed fuels may not exist in some groups and patches (adapted from Kaufmann and others 2007). 
Structural feature
Essential 
structural 
feature?
Comment
Large trees
No
Tree size depends on species and site characteristics (moisture, soils, and 
competition). Young trees may be large, and old trees may be small.
Old trees
Yes
Trees develop unique structural characteristics when old (e.g., dead tops, 
flattened crowns, branching characteristics, bark color and texture).
Age variability
No
An important feature in some old-growth forest types. Some forests regenerate 
episodically (even-aged) with most trees establishing in a few years to a decade, 
probably in conjunction with wet years and large seed crops and in concurrence 
with relatively long intervals between fires. Others may regenerate over decades 
(uneven-aged).
Snags and large dead 
and downed fuels
Yes
Snags and large logs are essential for old growth, but forests with more frequent 
fires may have fewer logs. Densities and sizes of snags and logs vary depending 
on forest type, precipitation, and other factors. Snags, logs, and woody debris 
typically distributed unevenly in landscapes.
Between-patch 
structural variability
Yes
High variability is a critical feature. Within-patch variability may be low, but 
variation among patches may be high. Proportions of patches with different 
developmental stages vary depending on forest type, climate, etc.
• Plant associations vary across environmental gradi-
ents (e.g., changes in slope, aspect, climate, and soil 
type) and reflect their historical species composi-
tion, structure, and spatial aggregations.
• Denser tree conditions may exist as patches in lo-
cations such as north-facing slopes and canyon 
bottoms.
• Natural and anthropogenic disturbances such as fire 
or tree thinning treatments are sufficient to maintain 
desired overall species composition, tree density, 
age structures, snags, coarse woody debris, and nu-
trient cycling.
Key Elements by Forest Type:  
Dry Mixed-Conifer
Southwest dry mixed-conifer forests generally oc-
cur at elevations ranging from 5500-9500 ft. At lower 
elevations within this range, dry mixed-conifer forests 
commonly occur on north-facing slopes or canyon bot-
toms and ponderosa pine forests on south-facing slopes 
and ridgetops. At the upper elevation range, dry mixed-
conifer forests typically occupy south and west slopes, 
with wetter forest types (e.g., wet mixed-conifer) on 
north aspects. Dry mixed-conifer forests are dominat-
ed by shade-intolerant trees such as ponderosa pine, 
Douglas-fir, Southwestern white pine, limber pine,

33
mixed-conifer types, this forest type intergrades 
with ponderosa pine-bunchgrass and ponderosa 
pine-Gambel oak subtypes. At the cool/moist end 
of the gradient, dry mixed-conifer intergrades with 
the wet mixed-conifer type typified by a mixed-se-
verity fire regime. Differences in overstory species 
composition influences structure (tree density, tree 
group size, number of individuals, regeneration), 
disturbance events (species-specific insect and dis-
eases, fuel type and quantity), distribution of snags 
and coarse woody debris, and species composition 
of the grass-forb-shrub community.
• Where dry mixed-conifer forests occur at the warm-
er/drier end of the environmental gradient (Fig. 2), 
trees typically occur in irregularly shaped groups, 
trees within groups are variably spaced, and group 
sizes generally range from a few trees up to an acre 
(Fig. 14), similar to ponderosa pine forest types. 
Reference conditions show tree group sizes ranging 
from 0.01-0.33 acres (Table 3) (see Science Review: 
Forest Ecology). Trees within groups are of similar 
or variable ages and groups are composed of one or 
more species. Crowns of trees within the mid-aged 
to old groups are interlocking or nearly interlocking 
(Fig. 11). Size, shape, number of trees per group, and 
numbers of groups per area are variable (see Science 
Review: Forest Ecology). If aggregated, more pro-
ductive sites will have more trees per group, or if not 
aggregated will support more trees per acre.
• No data are available on the proportion of stand 
basal area in individual trees verses tree groups. 
More research is needed (see Monitoring, Adaptive 
Management, and Research Needs).
• Grass-forb-shrub interspaces surround tree groups 
and individual trees (Figs. 14 and 16) and are vari-
ably shaped and sized.
• Snags, top-killed, lightning- and fire-scarred trees, 
logs, and coarse woody debris (>3 inches diameter) 
are generally large in height and diameter, scattered 
throughout, and concentrated at past disturbance 
events in abundances of 5-35 snags and 8-16 tons 
per acre (see Science Review: Forest Ecology). 
Overall, snags, logs, and coarse woody debris are 
spatially and temporally variable.
Dry Mixed-Conifer: Mid-Scale Elements  
(10-1000 acres)
• The mid-scale is an aggregate of fine-scale units (i.e., 
tree groups, scattered individual trees, and grass-
forb-shrub interspaces) and is collectively referred to 
as a patch or stand. At the mid-scale, patches can be 
relatively homogeneous in vegetation composition 
and structure and differ from surrounding patches. 
Vegetation is typically characterized by variation in 
the sizes and numbers of tree groups and the density 
and extent of patches of trees, each typically varying 
by elevation, soil type, aspect, and site productivity. 
Occasionally, patches may be composed of random-
ly arranged trees.
• In general, tree densities range from 20-100 trees 
per acre and 40-125 square ft basal area per acre 
(Table 9) (see Science Review: Forest Ecology). 
Stand density is likely to increase as site conditions 
transition toward the cooler/moister end of the en-
vironmental gradient for dry mixed-conifer forests 
and on more productive soil types.
• For sustainability and biodiversity purposes, it is 
desirable that patches have an uneven-aged forest 
structure with an approximate balance of age classes 
ranging from young to old. Infrequently, patches of 
even-aged forest structure may be present.
• Species composition may be variable within patch-
es and is a function of disturbance, tree density, 
tree size and age structure, topography, soil, local 
climate, site history, ecological legacy, and stochas-
ticity (e.g., weather events, mass seeding).
• It is desirable that all age classes of appropriate hard-
wood species (e.g., aspen, Gambel oak, and maple) 
are present depending on a site’s plant association 
(Table 8).
• “Openness” is similar to ponderosa pine at the warm-
er/drier end of the environmental gradient occupied 
by dry mixed-conifer forests (Table 7) but is likely 
to decrease from the warmer/drier site conditions to 
the cooler/wetter end of the environmental gradient 
due to moister conditions, higher productivity, and 
less frequent low-severity fire.
Dry Mixed-Conifer: Landscape-Scale Elements 
(1000-10,000+ acres)
• The landscape scale is an aggregate of mid-scale 
units and includes areas with variable topography, 
soils, plant associations, disturbance types, and land 
use legacies. The landscape is a functioning ecosys-
tem that contains all its components, processes, and 
functions that result from characteristic disturbanc-
es, including snags, downed logs, and old trees.
• Old-growth structural features occur throughout the 
landscape as tree groups or single trees within un-
even-aged patches (stands) or occassionally as small 
even-aged patches. Old-growth structural features 

34 
USDA Forest Service RMRS-GTR-310.  2013.
include old trees, dead trees (snags), downed wood 
(coarse woody debris), and horizontal and verti-
cal structural diversity in a grass-forb-shrub matrix 
(Table 10). The location of old-growth may shift on 
the landscape over time as a result of succession and 
disturbance (tree growth and mortality).
• Plant associations vary across environmental gradi-
ents (e.g., changes in slope, aspect, climate, and soil 
type) and reflect their historical species composi-
tion, structure, and spatial aggregations.
• Denser tree conditions may exist as patches in some 
locations such as north-facing slopes and canyon 
bottoms.
• Natural and anthropogenic disturbances such as fire 
or tree thinning treatments are sufficient to maintain 
desired overall species composition, tree density, 
age structures, snags, coarse woody debris, and nu-
trient cycling.

Here, we offer recommendations for implementing 
our framework. These were developed from our un-
derstanding of the body of forest ecology and manage-
ment literature (see Science Review: Forest Ecology), 
our research and management experience, and lessons 
learned during implementations of our restoration 
framework. At the end of this section we present an 
overview of a case study on the implementation of our 
framework that illustrates its success in moving current 
forest conditions toward uneven-aged forest mosaics 
comprised mostly of fire-adapted species; tree groups; 
scattered individual trees; grass-forb-shrub interspac-
es; snags, logs, woody debris; and the spatial arrange-
ment of these elements.
Classification of Site Variability
Ecological classification of a site indicates its 
biological capabilities regarding species composi-
tion, structure, processes, and functions. Ecological 
classification is useful for implementing our resto-
ration framework because classification depends on 
variability of local climate, soil, vegetation, geology 
and geomorphology, and a site’s characteristic dis-
turbances and vegetation responses (USDA Forest 
Service 1997). The variability within and among sites 
across landscapes is the basis for describing the range 
of variation in forest conditions in our restoration 
framework. Recognition of within- and among-site 
variability is paramount for developing localized res-
toration objectives. Example classification systems 
include the U.S. Forest Service Terrestrial Ecosystem 
Unit Inventory (Winthers and others 2005), which 
classifies land units by soil, climate, slope, geol-
ogy, geomorphology, and plant associations, and 
NatureServe’s Ecological Systems (Comer and others 
2003). The biotic and abiotic variables used in these 
classification systems describe a site’s biophysical 
characteristics.
Recommendations by Key Elements
Species Composition
• Manage for percent species composition as indicated 
by local historical evidence (live trees and snags 
and logs from trees that originated prior to 1880), 
biophysical site conditions, and other management 
objectives (e.g., favoring scarce species; preserv-
ing genetic diversity; enhancing wildlife habitat; 
resilience to climate change; or achieving other 
resource objectives, social values, and regulatory 
requirements).
Tree Groups and Individual Trees
• Use a site’s historical spatial patterns to inform resto-
ration targets and treatments. Where information on 
reference conditions is not available, fine-scale spa-
tial patterns may be informed by reference data in 
Table 3, 6, 7 and 9 and combined with local histori-
cal evidence (see Friederici 2004) such as grouped 
and individual old trees, large logs, and stumps, and 
a site’s biophysical conditions.
• Evaluate current conditions in relation to desired 
conditions to develop management prescriptions. 
Avoid arbitrary constraints such as diameter limits 
for tree cutting (see Abella and others 2006; Triepke 
and others 2011).
• Where spatial heterogeneity is desired, consider 
combinations of burns, intermediate and free thin-
ning, and individual tree or small group selection 
cutting methods to create a heterogeneous structure 
of groups, single trees, and grass-forb-shrub inter-
spaces. Once heterogeneity is established, consider 
maintaining the desired structure and spatial pattern 
with fire and/or single tree and small group selection.
• Where trees are spatially aggregated, maintain in-
terlocking or nearly interlocking crowns in mature 
and old groups and provide for variable tree spacing 
within groups; avoid thinning old tree groups.
• Manage young tree groups to create future variable 
tree spacing and interlocking crowns. Thin young 
tree-groups to facilitate development of desired 
within-group characteristics (e.g., variable tree spac-
ing and interlocking or nearly interlocking crowns) 
in mid- to old-aged tree groups.
• Tree groups generally are small (2-72 trees per group, 
see Science Review: Forest Ecology) (Fig. 4). Use 
historical evidence and biophysical capabilities to 
determine a site’s mean and range (minimum, maxi-
mum) of trees per group and numbers and spacing 
of tree groups per area.
• Mid-scale patches (stands) of less-aggregated or 
randomly arranged trees may be appropriate where

historical evidences do not exhibit spatial aggrega-
tion or for achieving other resource objectives.
• Where appropriate, retain or regenerate scattered in-
dividual trees between groups.
• Use historical evidence, biophysical site conditions, 
plant associations, and current conditions (e.g., 
competition from brush on certain plant association 
types, degree of disease or insect infestation) to in-
form regeneration treatments.
• Where management objectives are to maintain coni-
fer dominance and where post-treatment dominance 
by shrub understories is undesired (e.g., in some pon-
derosa pine-evergreen oak, ponderosa pine-shrub, 
and dry mixed conifer-forb/shrub forest types), con-
sider smaller interspaces to avoid excessive shrub 
response and increased ladder fuel accumulation.
• Consider temporary deviations from uneven-aged 
management to even-aged cutting methods to initi-
ate recovery on sites damaged by epidemic (severe) 
insect or disease infestation or other disturbances.
• Manage fire (wildfire or prescribed) frequency and 
severity towards achieve desired forest structures, 
spatial arrangements, regeneration patterns, and fuel 
consumption objectives.
• Design and place regeneration treatments to favor re-
cruitment of shade-intolerant, fire-resistant species.
• Vary treatment prescriptions (cutting and/or fire) to 
create a mosaic of groups of trees, scattered single 
trees, and grass-forb-shrub interspaces.
Grass-Forb-Shrub Interspaces
• The grass-forb-shrub community is the matrix in 
which tree groups and scattered individual trees are 
arranged (Fig. 8).
• The size and arrangement of grass-forb-shrub in-
terspaces reflect local site conditions and historical 
evidence. Where trees are grouped, interspaces may 
be as wide as 1-2 mature tree heights from nearest 
drip lines of adjacent tree groups. Binkley and oth-
ers (2008) reported approximately 150 ft between 
historic groups of trees in dry mixed-conifer in 
Southwest Colorado; Pearson (1923) reported 100-
150 ft diameter openings (interspaces) between 
historic tree groups in ponderosa pine forests in 
northern Arizona.
• Sizes of grass-forb-shrub interspaces are a less use-
ful metric for tree spacing in areas where trees are 
more randomly spaced (i.e., not aggregated). Use a 
site’s historical vegetation spatial patterns as a guide 
for restoration.
• Grass-forb-shrub interspaces are generally larger on 
dry sites. Interspaces provide rooting space to sup-
port grouped trees.
• Meadows, grasslands, and other non-forested areas 
may be present as inclusions in forested landscapes; 
these areas are not considered interspaces.
Snags, Logs, and Woody Debris
• Manage for the continuous presence of snags, logs, 
and woody debris, especially large snags in various 
stages of decay throughout the landscape (Figs. 12 
and 13). Frequent fires both recruit and consume 
these elements.
Arrangement of Key Elements in Space and Time
• Recognize the importance of spatial and temporal 
heterogeneity in forest composition and structure to 
ecological processes and functions.
• Where objectives include sustainability of wildlife 
habitat, biodiversity, and wood products, manage 
for a balance of age classes from cohort establish-
ment (seedling/saplings) to old forest structure, and 
for grass-forb-shrub interspaces (Figs. 18 and 19).
• Where threatened, endangered, or other rare species 
are a concern, alternative composition and struc-
tures may be needed.
Management Feasibility
Our key elements focus on the compositional and 
structural features of frequent-fire forests with the goal 
of creating opportunities for the resumption of char-
acteristic ecological processes and functions and to 
re-establish the pattern-process link. In some cases, 
fire can be used to develop the desired composition and 
structure, while in other cases, it may be more effective 
when it follows the restoration of forest composition 
and structure through mechanical treatments. Some of 
the recent wildfire events in the Southwest may present 
opportunities to initiate the post-fire “reset” of compo-
sition and structure toward desired conditions through 
broad-scale application of managed fires. In many 
Southwestern areas, restoration of frequent-fire for-
ests will be labor intensive and costly. In other areas, 
implementation, or certain implementation tools, may 
be constrained by logistic, economic, social consider-
ations, and special land designations (e.g., wilderness 
and protected areas). For example, degraded condi-
tions in current forests may limit the use of fire. In such 
areas, mechanical treatments may be necessary before 
introducing fire. In areas where silvicultural treatments 

USDA Forest Service RMRS-GTR-310.  2013. 
37
are constrained by operational feasibility (e.g., access, 
slope, or economics) or in wilderness areas, fire may be 
the only management tool.
• It may not be feasible for management to approxi-
mate historical composition and structure patterns 
and/or fully restore characteristic ecological pro-
cesses and functions everywhere.
 o Socio-economic considerations (e.g., smoke, op-
erational capacity, and public safety) may limit 
the use of fire and prescribed cutting. Some areas 
may require combinations of treatments to create 
and maintain desired compositions, structures, 
processes, and functions.
• Existing conditions influence treatment prescription 
and choice of tools.
 o Fire alone can be used where there may be less 
need for precise outcomes. Fire may result in 
more variable forest density, numbers, and sizes 
of groups, and greater distribution of age classes.
 o Where sustained production of ecosystem ser-
vices is desired, managing at the extremes of the 
natural range of variability may be desired. For 
example:
  Higher forest density and a balance of forest 
structural stages may be desirable to ensure 
economic sustainability (i.e., to maintain some 
level of sustained wood products) and for 
maintaining denser tree habitat conditions for 
some wildlife species.
  Lower forest density and open forest structure 
may be desirable to facilitate additional reduc-
tions in fire hazard and for maintenance of 
more open habitat for some wildlife species.
 o Depending on existing conditions, achieving the 
key elements may require multiple treatments 
(e.g., prescribed cutting and fire) over long time 
periods.
• Past disturbances, such as those resulting from fire 
and insects, may provide early management op-
portunities (i.e., reforestation and fire management) 
to put recovering forests on trajectories toward 
development of key compositional and structural 
elements.
• Consider strategic placement of restoration treat-
ments to capitalize on the use of wildfire, under 
appropriate conditions, across broad landscapes.

One of several implementations of our restora-
tion framework was on the Cibola National Forest 
(Bluewater demonstration project) in New Mexico in 
2010. Objectives of this project were to:
(1) create resilient forest composition and structure;
(2) move a predominately mid-aged forest toward 
uneven-aged conditions with an approximate 
balance of tree age classes;
(3) restore grass-forb-shrub interspaces;
(4) reduce fuels and fire hazard; and
(5) promote wildlife habitat, biodiversity, and wood 
products.
Our attempt to achieve the key compositional and 
structural elements in one treatment on the Bluewater 
site was limited by existing conditions; a portion of the 
mature and old trees had been harvested in prior treat-
ments, there was little existing regeneration, and the 
site had a preponderance of mid-aged ponderosa pine 
trees. A comparison of pre- and post-treatment condi-
tions (Figs. 20 and 21; unit 5A) attests to on-the-ground 
feasibility and utility of our framework recommenda-
tions for restoring the key elements in Southwestern 
ponderosa pine forests. Details for this project are 
available from the Forestry Staff with the USDA Forest 
Service Southwestern Region in Albuquerque, New 
Mexico.
Pre-Treatment Conditions
The Bluewater demonstration site is a 73-acre 
ponderosa pine stand (Fig. 22) that contained three 
different plant associations: ponderosa pine/mountain 
muhly, ponderosa pine/Arizona fescue, and pondero-
sa pine/blue grama, all of which are characterized as 
bunchgrass plant associations. The ponderosa pine site 
index is 72 for a base age of 100 years (Minor 1964). 
Soils are moderately productive and variable through-
out the unit, comprised of alluvium and residuum 
from granite, and residuum derived from sandstone 
and claystone. The climate is temperate, with an aver-
age 180-day frost-free growing season from mid-May 
through mid-September and annual precipitation rang-
ing from 17-25 inches, with greater than half occurring 
during the growing season.
Sanitation and improvement harvests occurred in 
the stand in the mid-1980s to remove diseased, dy-
ing, and poorly formed trees and, with the exception 
of piled slash burning in that treatment, the site had not 
experienced fire since the early 1900s. Prior to treat-
ment, stand density averaged 216 trees and 125 square 
ft of basal area per acre. The stand was uneven-aged 
but had a predominance of mid-aged trees (Table 11). 
Fire behavior modeling demonstrated that 11 percent 
of the area had potential to support torching and active 
crown fire under dry conditions (i.e., completely dried 
fuel) and 15-mile/hr unobstructed wind speed.
Prescription Description
Tree marking occurred in spring 2010, tree cutting 
occurred in summer 2010, and prescribed burning is 
scheduled for fall and winter 2013. Treatment pre-
scriptions were developed to produce the composition, 
structure, and spatial pattern identified in our frame-
work for ponderosa pine: a predominant composition 
of ponderosa pine; re-establishment of a grass-forb-
shrub community in interspaces between trees; groups 
of trees with interlocking or nearly interlocking crowns 
in the older age-classes; scattered individual trees; and 
retention of snags, logs, and woody debris.
The objective was to adjust stocking and spatial ar-
rangement of residual trees (i.e., leave trees) to create or 
move the forest toward an uneven-aged and aggregated 
stand structure with a balance of age classes. Treatment 
prescriptions allowed within-site flexibility in numbers 
of trees per group and numbers and dispersions of 
groups per area as informed by historical evidence (i.e., 
old trees, logs, stumps with establishment date <1880) 
and existing forest structure. Treatment prescriptions 
used group selection to create grass-forb-shrub in-
terspaces and regeneration sites and free thinning in 
immature leave tree groups to develop/retain intersper-
sion of tree groups of different age classes and group 
sizes. Tree marking crews were instructed not to thin 
mature and old groups of trees except to remove young 
trees within these groups to reduce ladder fuel. Our in-
tent was to have about 40 percent of the forested area 
occupied by mature-to-old tree groups, both of which 
meet old-growth objectives.

Objectives were to favor retention of Southwestern 
white pine, ponderosa pine, and Douglas-fir; maintain 
minor components of pinyon pine and some juniper 
species; and favor Gambel oak and Rocky Mountain 
juniper trees for wildlife habitat. Leave-tree marking 
identified tree groups and single trees for retention. 
Leave trees were selected based on tree vigor and ages, 
with the objective of retaining an approximate balance 
of age classes. Special emphasis was also placed on 
within-group structure, including the retention of sub-
dominant, dead-topped, and lightning-struck trees for 
wildlife habitat. Because no snags were present on the 
site, trees with declining vigor were retained for snag 
recruitment. Leave tree groups were either a single 
size or a blend of variably-sized trees. Trees within 
young groups were selected to encourage the devel-
opment of future interlocking crowns. Overly dense 
young tree groups were thinned to facilitate vigor and 
future crown growth. Leave tree groups were gener-
ally 0.25-0.75 acres, but groups as small as a few trees 
and as large as 2 acres were also desired. After an 
initial training period, the marking crew successfully 
created the desired pattern of groups, scattered single 
trees, and grass-forb-shrub interspaces. However, they 
tended to mark numerous small-sized groups instead 
of a range of group sizes. To establish group size vari-
ability, we revisited the treatment area and added trees 
to some groups.

to treatment (top image), forest density was substantially greater and more spatially homogenous than after the 2010 
restoration treatment (bottom image) that applied the principles of our restoration framework.

40 
USDA Forest Service RMRS-GTR-310.  2013.
Interspaces between tree groups were created to pro-
vide for grass-forb-shrub vegetation and areas for root 
development. Desired interspace distances between 
leave groups ranged from 20-100 ft (drip line to drip 
line), with most distances ranging from 50-70 ft. To 
remedy a deficit of seedlings and saplings, regenera-
tion sites ranging from 0.33-1.0 acre were created.
Treatment prescriptions specified the desired abun-
dance of snags, logs, and woody debris: averages of 
2 snags per acre with diameter at breast height (dbh) 
>12 inches and 3 downed logs per acre with dbh >12 
inches. Where existing snag density was less than 2-3 
per acre, live trees with broken tops or defects or fad-
ing green trees were retained for future snag and log 
recruitment.
The northern goshawk, tassel-eared squirrel, and 
Merriam’s turkey were given special consideration. 
The treatment prescription was consistent with the 
restoration of habitats of plants and animals in the 
northern goshawk’s food web (Reynolds and others

1992, 2006a, 2006b), including older tree groups with 
interlocking crowns for tassel-eared squirrels (Dodd 
and others 2003, 2006; Reynolds and others 1992) and 
high interspersion of grass-forb-shrub interspaces (for-
aging and brood habitat), closed-canopied tree groups 
(nesting and hiding cover), and large, old trees (roost-
ing habitat) for Merriam’s turkey (Hoffman and others 
1993; Porter 1992).
Post-Treatment Conditions
This restoration treatment succeeded in creating the 
key compositional and structural elements identified in 
our framework (Figs. 21 and 23). The treatment retained 
the uneven-aged structure in the stand, increased the 
degree of interspersion of age classes, and is on a trajec-
tory toward an approximate balance of age classes. The 
stand still had fewer seedling-saplings and mature and 
old trees than desired due to deficits in pre-treatment 
conditions (Tables 11 and 12). Approximately 28 per-
cent of the area in the post-treatment stand was under 
the crowns of mid- to old-aged trees and 72 percent 
was open with no tree cover (Fig. 20). Approximately 
20 percent of the post-treatment open area is desig-
nated for future tree recruitment, which will result in 
a desired 52 percent openness and 48 percent under 
tree cover. Open interspaces between tree groups were 
created for grass-forb-shrub communities and fire-safe 
sites were created for tree regeneration (Fig. 23). Post-
treatment stand densities averaged 57 trees and about 
40-80 square ft of basal area per acre. Most leave trees 
were arranged in groups with interlocking crowns, but 
scattered individual trees were retained across the site. 
Tree group sizes ranged from a few trees to 0.47 acres 
based on the area covered by tree crowns estimated 
from aerial photographs.
The post-treatment composition, structure, and 
spatial pattern of the stand reduced the risk of crown 
fire from pre-treatment conditions. Post-treatment 
FlamMap simulations predicted surface fires across 99 
percent of the area and passive crown fire on 1 percent. 
Post-treatment abundance of small diameter woody 
debris was higher than intended, but prescribed burn-
ing will consume much of this material. Post-treatment 
abundance of logs and snags was lower than desired; 
however, these key structural features are expected to 
accumulate over time and with maintenance treatments. 
Mechanical treatments moved this forest stand toward 
restored conditions, but many years and multiple fol-
low-up treatments (fire, mechanical, or combinations 
of these) will be needed to produce and maintain the 
desired key elements.
Future Management
Future plans are to broadcast burn the Bluewater site 
in the fall and winter of 2013 in order to initiate nutrient 
cycling and maintain fuels at desired levels. Subsequent 
entries will involve either tree felling, fire, or combi-
nations of these to maintain or enhance the restoration 
treatment and manage for the desired mix and balance 
of tree age structures. Post-treatment conditions are be-
ing monitored at fixed photo-plots (Fig. 21) to determine 
whether compositional and structural objectives are be-
ing met and to inform future management.

Our restoration framework is intended to promote 
ecosystem resilience by using fire and prescribed cut-
ting treatments to restore the species compositions, 
structures, and spatial patterns of Southwestern fre-
quent-fire forests. Restoring these features should al-
low re-establishment of characteristic processes such 
as disturbance regimes, nutrient cycling, food webs, 
hydrologic function, and ecosystem services such as 
biodiversity, old-growth, wood products, aesthetics, 
and recreation. Restoring characteristic compositions, 
structures, processes, and functions should also re-es-
tablish the evolutionary environment to which plants 
and animals native to these forests were adapted. 
Having intact, self-regulating, productive, and adap-
tive ecosystems is a compelling strategy for allowing 
species in the ecosystem to adapt to changing envi-
ronments and facilitate their migration in the face of 
uncertain climate changes and disturbances. The fol-
lowing description of expected outcomes from restor-
ing forest composition, structure, and spatial pattern 
in Southwestern frequent-fire forests is intended as an 
overview of some important outcomes from the resto-
ration of these forests; this overview is not a compre-
hensive review of the literature. Improved understand-
ings of these and other outcomes will require additional 
research (see Monitoring, Adaptive Management, and 
Research Needs).
Ecosystem Resilience to Climate Change
Restoring ecosystem resilience based on historical 
conditions has been a central concept in ecosystem 
management (Covington 2003; Folke and others 2004; 
Scheffer and others 2001). However, the relevance of 
historical conditions as reference points and targets 
for restoration has been questioned on the basis of un-
certainty of future ecological conditions due to global 
climate change (Harris and others 2006; Millar and 
others 2007; Wagner and others 2000). Specific chal-
lenges for restoring and sustaining frequent-fire forests 
in the face of climate change are uncharacteristically 
rapid alterations of environments and combinations of 
disturbances and non-native biotic factors producing 
conditions never before documented in evolutionary 
time—conditions that may overwhelm characteris-
tic ecological processes (Fulé 2008). In light of these 
challenges, we review the evolutionary history of these 
forests.
Over the past several million years, forests and 
woodlands in the Southwest, including their associ-
ated microbial, plant, and animal communities, have 
tracked favorable habitats and climates whose migra-
tions across geographical and elevational ranges were 
driven by major climate fluctuations (Bonnicksen 
2000; Covington 2003; Delcourt and Delcourt 1988). 
Since the end of the last major glacial period (14,000 
years ago), ponderosa pine returned to the high eleva-
tion plateaus and mountains of Arizona about 10,000 
years ago and to the central Rocky Mountains only 
about 5000 years ago (Baker 1986; Covington 2003; 
Latta and Milton 1999; Millar 1998). In the last 50 mil-
lion years, frequent-fire forests survived wide swings 
in environmental conditions (Moore and others 1999). 
Component species of frequent-fire forests adapted 
over evolutionary time to arid environments that have 
been characterized by variable wet and dry periods, 
including prolonged droughts, and disturbances such 
as fire, insects, and diseases. These disturbances var-
ied in frequency, intensity, and extent (Covington and 
Moore 1994b); served as checks on the demographic 
rates of component species; and resulted in self- 
regulating processes of nutrient cycling, productivity, 
and regeneration (Allen and others 2002; Cooper 1960; 
Covington and others 1997; Covington and Moore 
1994b; Falk 2006).
The highest confidence in future climates is as-
sociated with projections that are consistent among 
climate change models and observed climate changes. 
Surface temperatures in the Southwest are predicted to 
increase substantially, with more warming in the sum-
mer and fall than in winter and spring; summer heat 
waves will become longer and hotter, with reductions 
of late winter/spring mountain snowpack due mostly 
to warmer temperatures (Overpeck and others 2012). 
Observed Southwest droughts have been exacerbated 
by warmer summer temperatures and are projected 
to become hotter, more severe, and more frequent, 
suggesting an increased drying in the Southwestern 
United States and that historical drought levels may 
become the norm (Overpeck and others 2012; Seager 
and others 2007). Such droughts will directly in-
crease tree mortality and vulnerability to pathogen 
attacks (Breshears and others 2005) and enhance 
the size and severity of wildfires (Fulé 2008). Thus, 
current conditions in frequent-fire forests (i.e., high 
stand densities, accumulations of fuels on the forest

floor, and encroachment of fire-susceptible species; 
Cocke and others 2005; Cooper 1960) will increase 
the susceptibility to stand-killing fire (Fulé 2008). It 
is also likely that on some sites, fire-caused changes 
in vegetation (e.g., forest to grasslands or shrublands) 
may not at all resemble those of historical forests 
(Barton 2002; Savage and Mast 2005; Strom and Fulé 
2007). Predicted changes to warmer climates in the 
American Southwest are expected to affect forests via 
geographical shifts in suitable environments for the 
dominate forest species. Shifts are expected to be to 
higher elevations and northward (Fulé 2008; Shafer 
and others 2001).
Uncertainties associated with future climate 
changes make the development of restoration strat-
egies increasingly complex and challenging. The 
scenario of future hotter, more severe, and more fre-
quent droughts in the Southwest (see Karl and others 
2009) includes increased competition for water and 
increased frequency and extent of high-severity fire, 
insect, and disease disturbances. Restoring the char-
acteristic composition, structure, and spatial pattern 
in frequent-fire forests would thereby:
• reduce tree densities and canopy continuity;
• recreate grass-forb-shrub plant communities;
• reduce competition for space, water, and nutrients 
(Covington and others 1997); and
• provide for the re-establishment of characteristic 
disturbance regimes (Covington and others 1997; 
Fulé and others 2002b; Kolb and others 1998).
Nonetheless, restoration strategies should account 
for an ecosystem’s current condition as they may 
influence an ecosystem’s development under future 
climate. Alternative successional pathways under 
future climactic variability may invalidate reference 
conditions as baselines for restoration (Clewell and 
others 2005; Pilliod and others 2006).
While climate forecasting remains imperfect, 
fire predictions for Western North America suggest 
substantial increases in occurrences, spread, and in-
tensity (Brown and others 2004; Honig and Fulé 
2012; McKenzie and others 2004; Spracklen and 
others 2009). Thus, managing frequent-fire forests to-
ward the historical composition, structure, and spatial 
pattern is consistent with a reduced vulnerability to 
catastrophic loss (Allen and others 2002; Falk 2006; 
Honig and Fulé 2012). While we recognize that un-
certainties in how species and communities can and 
will respond to rapid climate change, we agree with 
Fulé (2008) that it makes sense to restore fire and fire-
related composition, structures, and spatial patterns to 
enhance resistance to catastrophic loss. Restoring the 
composition, structure, and spatial pattern of these 
forests should increase their resistance and resilience 
to climate changes, thereby providing opportunities 
for species to migrate or develop local adaptations. In 
fact, Fulé (2008) suggested a restoration strategy that 
focuses on mesic areas at higher latitudes and eleva-
tions (i.e., upper portions of the ponderosa zone and 
the transitional dry mixed-conifer zone) where for-
ests are more likely to survive climate change. Fulé 
(2008) recommended using reference conditions from 
low and southerly areas to guide management in high-
er-elevation ecosystems to provide for the migration 
of species as climate warms.
In summary, both reference conditions and natural 
range of variability are useful guides for manage-
ment because Southwest frequent-fire forests were 
historically resilient to drought, insect pathogens, and 
severe wildfire. Our restoration framework should 
therefore increase the resistance (by forestalling im-
pacts), resilience (through improved recovery after 
disturbance), and response (allowing transitions or 
migrations to new conditions) of frequent-fire forests 
to climate change (Millar and others 2007; Parker and 
others 2000; Price and Neville 2003; Spittlehouse and 
Stewart 2003).
Disturbance Regimes
Restoring the composition, structure, and spatial 
patterns of frequent-fire forests will provide for the 
re-establishment of feedback relationships between 
pattern and disturbance processes in these forests 
(Larson and Churchill 2012). Disturbances are tem-
porary changes in environmental conditions that 
cause changes in ecosystem composition and struc-
ture. Restoring the composition and structure of 
frequent-fire forests will result in a more open for-
est structure and decrease the potential for epidemic 
outbreaks of insects and diseases and stand-replacing 
fire (Fitzgerald 2005; Fulé and others 2002, 2004; 
Graham and others 2004; Roccaforte and others 
2008; Strom and Fulé 2007). The restoration of grass-
forb-shrub interspaces and resultant separation of tree 
canopies will increase herbaceous plant development 
and provide fuels to carry frequent surface fires. In 
turn, restoration of characteristic fire regimes should 
sustain forest composition, structure, processes, and 
functions. Reduced tree densities result in reduced 
competition for resources, increased tree vigor, and 
reduced insect and disease infestations (Hessburg and 
others 1994; Kolb and others 1998).

46 
USDA Forest Service RMRS-GTR-310.  2013.
The intent of our framework is not to eliminate 
insects and diseases but to return populations and 
their effects to an endemic, low background level of 
tree mortality (Miller and Keen 1960). In areas with 
higher tree densities that may have escaped repeated 
surface fire, bark beetles can be a significant agent 
for shaping forest structure and fine-scale spatial het-
erogeneity. Increasing the spacing between groups of 
trees can reduce the continuity of mistletoe occurrence 
across the landscape and reduce mistletoe spread be-
tween groups, creating the opportunity for groups of 
trees that are free of mistletoe (Hawksworth 1961). 
Frequent surface fires can elevate tree crown bases 
and increase tree spatial heterogeneity, both of which 
can slow mistletoe spread (Conklin and Geils 2008). 
Frequent surface fire can also reduce the severity of 
mistletoe infection by killing heavily infected trees 
(Conklin and Geils 2008; Koonce and Roth 1980).
Nutrient Cycling
A restored fire regime can also improve soil nutrient 
conditions. Intense heat from fire volatilizes nitrogen 
from the soil and surface fuels, often causing the to-
tal nitrogen concentration of forest soils to decline 
(Boerner and others 2009; DeLuca and Sala 2006). 
However, nitrogen concentrations tend to recover and 
even increase two to four years following fire as soil 
microbes decompose ash and plant litter (Boerner and 
others 2009). Fire can also cause an immediate pulse 
of inorganic nitrogen due to the combustion of organic 
matter and mortality of soil microbes (DeLuca and 
Sala 2006). Soil ammonium concentrations in pon-
derosa pine forests may increase as much as 20-fold 
following fire followed by dramatic increases in nitrate 
levels after the first year (Covington and Sackett 1992). 
Frequent burning can maintain elevated levels of inor-
ganic nitrogen in forest soils by depositing charcoal, 
which binds to inorganic nitrogen and slows its leach-
ing, and by promoting the establishment of grasses and 
herbaceous vegetation (DeLuca and Sala 2006; Hart 
and others 2005). Grasses and herbaceous vegetation 
produce litter with higher nitrogen-to-carbon ratios 
than conifer vegetation; thus, the presence of herba-
ceous vegetation may stimulate decomposition and 
enhance the availability of inorganic nitrogen in for-
est soils (Hart and others 2005). Fires also kill large 
trees, creating snags that ultimately become coarse 
woody debris that plays an important role in nutri-
ent cycling (Brown and others 2003; Cram and others 
2007; Graham and others 1994; Harvey and others 
1988; Lowe 2006).
Biodiversity and Food Webs
Many ecosystem processes influence plant produc-
tivity, soil fertility, water availability, and other local 
and global environmental conditions. These processes 
are often controlled by the diversity and composition 
of plant, animal, and microbial species native to an 
ecosystem, and recent studies suggest that losses in 
biodiversity can alter the magnitude and stability of 
ecosystem processes (Naeem and others 1999). As a 
dominant species in frequent-fire forests, ponderosa 
pine influences the understory vegetation, soils, and 
plant and animal habitats and communities (Moore and 
others 1999). A community is a group of organisms 
that interact and share an environment. Organisms in 
a community may compete for resources, profit from 
presence of other organisms, or use other organisms as 
a food source. In the Southwest, ponderosa pine forests 
are occupied by over 250 species of vertebrates, inver-
tebrates, soil organisms, and plant species (Allen and 
others 2002; Patton and Severson 1989), many of which 
adapted to high levels of the spatial heterogeneity and 
biodiversity that characterized historical frequent-fire 
forests. A compositionally and structurally diverse un-
derstory provides food and cover for many species of 
vertebrates and invertebrates, each contributing to eco-
logical functioning and food webs. For example, the 
dispersion of mycorrhizal fungi, a root symbiont criti-
cal to the growth and health of trees, is likely reliant on 
small mammal transfer via feces (Johnson 1996).
Current frequent-fire forests are uncharacteristi-
cally homogeneous in composition and structure with 
reduced plant and animal habitats and lowered biodi-
versity (Allen and others 2002; Kalies and others 2012; 
Laughlin and others 2006; Patton and Severson 1989; 
Villa-Castillo and Wagner 2002; Waltz and Covington 
2003). Achieving our restoration framework’s key 
elements restores habitats at multiple spatial scales, 
especially through the re-establishment of species-rich 
grass-forb-shrub communities and the productiv-
ity, biodiversity, and trophic interactions they support 
(Abella 2009; Clary 1975; Kalies and others 2012; 
Oliver and others 1998; Reynolds and others 1992, 
2006a; Rieman and Clayton 1997). Dense tree condi-
tions in current frequent-fire forests favor plants and 
animals that do better in more close-canopied forests. 
Restoration to more open forest conditions may re-
sult in the decline of these species but should increase 
abundance of more open forest species (Kalies and oth-
ers 2012). Nonetheless, because our framework creates 
a variety of forest age and structural stages, includ-
ing groups and patches with dense forest structures, 

USDA Forest Service RMRS-GTR-310.  2013. 
47
declines of denser-forest obligates may be minimized 
(e.g., tassel-eared squirrel; Dodd and others 2003, 
2006; Kalies and others 2012), resulting in higher 
overall species diversity (Noss and others 2006).
Another concern is that the fine-scale structural 
heterogeneity of forests resulting from restoration of 
frequent-fire forests may lower the abundance and vi-
ability of large-area-dependent species (e.g., spotted 
owl; Holthausen and others 1999; Prather and others 
2008). These concerns might be ameliorated by de-
veloping specific desired conditions for breeding sites 
(e.g., on denser north slopes) and feeding sites with 
prey habitats (Prather and others 2008; Reynolds and 
others 1992). It is worth noting that breeding sites or 
entire refugia for imperiled species may receive pro-
tection from loss by encircling them with restored 
forests, lowering risk of catastrophic loss through fire 
or insects (Prather and others 2008). This indicates 
that restoration of these forests and the habitats they 
contain may provide for the historical distribution and 
abundance of plants and animals in Southwestern fre-
quent-fire forests.
Restoration of frequent-fire forests should lead to 
more robust food webs by re-creating diverse habi-
tats across landscapes. Species diverse and productive 
grass-forb-shrub communities in interspaces between 
tree groups support broad-based food webs that many 
invertebrates, birds, mammals, and their predators de-
pend upon (Abella 2009; Dodd and others 2003; Ganey 
and others 1992; Kalies and others 2012; Linkhart 
and others 1998; Reynolds and others 1992, 2006a; 
Rosenstock 1998). The importance of diverse tree 
and grass-forb-shrub habitats and robust food webs 
at multiple spatial scales was demonstrated by tem-
poral variations in the vital rates of northern goshawk 
(Reynolds and others 1992, 2005, 2006a, 2006b), a 
sensitive species that has been the subject of exten-
sive research in the Southwest (Beier and Drennan 
1997; Beier and others 2008; Boal and Mannan 1994; 
Ingraldi 2005). In the Southwest, goshawk reproduc-
tion typically varied extensively year-to-year and was 
strongly associated with the abundance and availabil-
ity of food; in years when prey numbers were low, 
goshawk population reproduction was a fraction of 
reproduction in years when prey was abundant (Beier 
and others 2008; Reynolds and others 2005; Salafsky 
and others 2005, 2007). Goshawks typically feed on a 
broad suite of prey—from robins, jays, woodpeckers, 
doves, and grouse to tree squirrels, ground squirrels, 
rabbits, and hares, each occupying different habitats 
(Reynolds and others 1992, 2006a). Annual population 
highs and lows of each prey species are not always in 
phase; a year’s population low of one or more prey is 
often compensated by higher abundances of other spe-
cies (Salafsky and others 2005). Due to compensation, 
forest management strategies that provide a fine- to 
mid-scale interspersion of habitats are more likely to 
successfully maintain an entire suite of prey at high-
er total abundance through both good and poor prey 
years in individual goshawk home ranges (Reynolds 
and others 1992, 2006a). For the goshawk and the 
many other avian and mammalian predators (e.g., rap-
tors, weasels, bobcats, and coyotes) in Southwestern 
frequent-fire forests, the grass-forb-shrub prey com-
munity is particularly important because it is occupied 
by a large proportion of the birds and mammals na-
tive to these forests as well as many important prey 
species, including rabbits, grouse, ground squirrels, 
mice, and voles. Prey species in this vegetation layer 
had larger body masses than most other species oc-
curring in frequent-fire forests (Reynolds and others 
1994; Salafsky and others 2005). Furthermore, several 
of these species are known to attain high population 
abundance in response to grass-forb-shrub productiv-
ity and biodiversity (Ernest and others 2000; Gross 
and others 1974; Hernández and others 2011; Hostetler 
and others 2012; McKay 1974). Others of our frame-
work’s key elements also create important habitats in 
Southwestern frequent-fire forests, including:
• dense groups and patches of older-aged trees with 
interlocking crowns for tree squirrels and species 
requiring denser forest conditions;
• snags for woodpecker foraging and nesting;
• snags for secondary-cavity nesters, bark gleaning 
birds, and hunting and sallying perches;
• logs for many invertebrate species (spiders, ants), 
woodpeckers, mice, rabbits, ground squirrels, 
grouse, and wild turkey; and
• woody debris for many small mammals.
Old-Growth
The key elements described in the restoration frame-
work provide and sustain old-growth tree components 
at all spatial scales. Old-growth components provide 
a number of ecosystem services—plant and animal 
habitat, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, hydrologic 
function, high-quality wood products, aesthetics, and 
spiritual values. Old-growth structure includes old 
trees, dead trees (snags), downed wood (coarse woody 
debris), and structural diversity (Figs. 9, 12, and 13) 
(Franklin and Spies 1991; Helms 1998; Kaufmann 

48 
USDA Forest Service RMRS-GTR-310.  2013.
and others 2007). The concept of old-growth includes 
multiple spatial and temporal scales, ranging from in-
dividual trees to tree groups and patches to landscapes 
and their development overtime. Definitive character-
istics of old growth in the Southwest vary by forest type 
as a consequence of differences in species composition, 
tree longevities and sizes, and the characteristic types, 
frequencies, and severities of disturbances (Harmon 
and others 1986). Old-growth forests in the Southwest 
have been partitioned into three groups based on dif-
ferent fire regimes and resultant compositional and 
structural features (Table 10): frequent, low-severity 
fire; mixed-severity fire; and infrequent, high-severity 
fire (Table 2).
Old-growth in frequent-fire forests occurs as old 
trees in groups and as scattered individuals within 
uneven-aged forests. These forests are less dense and 
have fewer logs and woody debris than high-severity 
infrequent-fire forests. Old-growth structural features 
typically occur at the fine scale (Meyer 1934; Weaver 
1951) and are composed of small, old tree groups in-
terspersed with similarly sized groups of younger 
trees, seedlings to mid-aged (Table 10) (Cooper 1961; 
Harrod and others 1999; Morgan and others 2002; 
Pearson 1950; Woolsey 1911). The fine-scale age di-
versity through growth and development sustained the 
old-growth tree components. Our framework’s key res-
toration elements in frequent-fire forests include all the 
essential structural features of old growth distributed 
throughout the uneven-aged forest (Kaufmann and oth-
ers 2007).
In contrast to frequent-fire forests, old-growth in 
forests with a mixed-severity fire regime (Table 2) is 
characterized by adjacent forest patches burned by ei-
ther low- or high-severity fire (Fulé and others 2003; 
Grissino-Mayer and others 1995). This results in land-
scapes with patches of old-growth intermixed with 
patches of different forest ages. Under an infrequent, 
high-severity regime (Table 2), old-growth forests are 
driven by mid- to landscape-scale, high-severity fire 
followed by vegetation recovery and succession oc-
curring over long periods between fires. Infrequent, 
high-severity fire regimes typically have large (>100 
acres) patches of forests dominated by large, old trees 
with multiple canopy layers with similar times since 
disturbance and vegetation origin dates.
Hydrologic Function
We found no published studies that evaluated the 
long-term effects of restoration on hydrologic func-
tion and water yield in Southwestern frequent-fire 
forests (see Monitoring, Adaptive Management, 
and Research Needs). However, studies on the ef-
fects of different tree harvest prescriptions on 
hydrologic function and water yield offer insights 
into the probable effects of reducing current high 
tree densities through restoration of frequent-fire 
forests in the Southwest. Hydrologic function and 
water yield in forests are greatly influenced by the 
amount and distribution of vegetation, precipita-
tion, snow melt, basin physiography, and soil type. 
In dense (92-140 ft2/acre) ponderosa pine forests, 
reduction of residual basal area to less than 100 ft2 
per acre resulted in increased water yield, although 
large variations in yield are typical. In addition, ini-
tial mean increases in water yield of 15-45 percent 
can be realized in ponderosa pine forests on basalt- 
derived soils when high basal area in current for-
ests is reduced. However, increases can be expected 
to decline with time as vegetation establishes and 
develops (Baker 1986; Douglas 1983; Harr 1983; 
MacDonald and Stednick 2003; Troendle 1983). 
Removal or reduction of forest cover can increase 
soil water storage, which then becomes available for 
groundwater recharge (Baker and others 2003). Soil 
water content was reported to be higher in thinned 
and thinned-and-burned areas than in untreated-
control areas on basalt soils in northern Arizona. 
However, observed annual variation in water yield 
showed that the amount and timing of precipitation 
had a greater overall effect on water yield than did 
the removal of trees (Feeney and others 1998).
From the above it seems reasonable that restoring 
our framework’s key elements will benefit hydrologic 
function by reducing stand density and creating open 
grass-forb-shrub interspaces, decreasing canopy tran-
spiration and interception losses, concentrating snow 
in interspaces, and increasing soil infiltration, water 
storage, and stream and spring flow (Baker 1986; 
Ffolliott and others 1989). While an objective of 
increasing water yield may not be a sufficient justifi-
cation for forest restoration, increases in water yield 
are a significant incidental benefit (Baker 2003).
Wood Products
The re-establishment of frequent, low-severi-
ty fire is critical to the success of our restoration 
framework. However, because of limitations such 
as proximity to human developments, air quality re-
strictions, and workforce capacity, the use of fire will 
probably continue to be limited. Therefore, mechani-
cal-only treatments, or perhaps combinations of fire and 

USDA Forest Service RMRS-GTR-310.  2013. 
49
mechanical treatments, are likely to be the restoration 
tools of choice in much of the Southwestern landscape. 
Another limitation to restoration is the economic vi-
ability of treatments; can treatments generate revenue 
to fund restoration or must they be subsidized? In the 
initial stages of forest restoration, an abundant supply 
of lower-valued wood products could help create lo-
cal products, industries, and enterprises and generate 
some revenue. Establishment of small-diameter tree 
markets, followed by shifts to markets targeting the use 
of restoration by-products (e.g. traditional and emerg-
ing products utilizing a wider range of tree sizes), will 
be essential to long-term restoration and stable local in-
dustries. Yields between 400 and 700 cubic ft per acre 
seem reasonable from a cutting cycle of 25 to 30 years 
once restoration achieves an approximate balance of 
structural stages in frequent-fire forests (Youtz and 
Vandendrieshe 2012). Such yields would help offset 
costs of achieving multiple objectives.
Aesthetics and Recreation
The public often judges the ecological health 
of a forest by appearance. Hill and Daniel (2008) 
found that acceptance of restoration activities may 
be contingent on public perceptions of aesthetics 
and knowledge of ecological benefits. People pre-
fer landscapes with large trees, openings, and varied 
spatial distribution of vegetation that provide views 
through the site and into the landscape (Brush 1979). 
Recreational campers preferred camp-sites that were 
about 60 percent shaded (James and Cordell 1970), 
while others preferred uneven-aged forest landscapes 
over even-aged, dense stands (Brown and Daniel 
1984, 1986, 1987; Ryan 2005). Restored forests meet 
these scenery preferences, suggesting greater public 
acceptance and support.

Frequent-fire forests in the Southwest are complex 
and dynamic, and our understanding of how they func-
tion and respond to disturbances is limited by available 
data. Knowledge gaps and unexpected events inevita-
bly make forest management and restoration inherently 
challenging. Key to meeting restoration challenges are 
the conduct of ecological monitoring, adaptive man-
agement, and additional research. This framework and 
its application are intended to be dynamic and adaptive 
and will evolve with accumulations of new monitoring 
and research information.
Ecological monitoring is the means by which 
managers evaluate whether the current conditions 
of an ecological system match, or are on a trajec-
tory to match, some desired condition (Noon 2003). 
Monitoring provides feedback on the impacts of man-
agement treatments (Lindenmayer and Likens 2010; 
Palmer and Mulder 1999) and is typically divided into 
three categories: implementation, effectiveness, and 
validation (Busch and Trexler 2003). Implementation 
monitoring occurs during implementation and deter-
mines whether treatments were carried out as intended. 
Effectiveness monitoring determines the extent to 
which treatments achieved their ultimate objectives. 
Validation monitoring assesses the degree to which 
underlying assumptions about ecosystem relation-
ships are supported (Block and others 2001; Busch 
and Trexler 2003) and functions to identify knowledge 
gaps or research needs.
Adaptive management requires feedback obtained 
from monitoring regarding the success or failure of 
treatments (Walters 1986). Adaptive management is 
the “rigorous approach for learning through deliber-
ately designing and applying management actions 
as experiments” (Murray and Marmorek 2003). In 
contrast to simply measuring treatment effects and 
making slight adjustments to future treatments, adap-
tive management depends on structured, adaptive 
decision making (Williams and others 2009). It is 
most useful when managers and scientists identify 
threshold values for triggering management actions 
(Noon 2003). A clear description in a plan of how 
monitoring will be used in decision-making is es-
sential (Noon 2003; Williams and others 2009). This 
could be achieved administratively (Mulder and oth-
ers 1999; Sitko and Hurteau 2010), legally via the 
National Environmental Policy Act process (Buckley 
and others 2001), or through collaborative agreements 
(Gori and Schussman 2005). Monitoring data should 
be compiled, analyzed, and reported in a timely man-
ner so that managers are provided information to 
improve decision-making (Mulder and others 1999) 
and to identify knowledge gaps.
Although much is known about historical forest 
composition, structure, and disturbance in frequent-fire 
forests, our knowledge of the mechanisms of spatial 
pattern formation and maintenance is limited, indicat-
ing a research need (Larson and Churchill 2012). A 
limited understanding of reference conditions on dif-
ferent parent material, especially in dry mixed-conifer, 
is an important data limitation for designing and imple-
menting appropriate resource management. While the 
number of reference data sets is increasing, existing 
data have focused largely on tree density. There is a 
clear need for studies on spatial patterns and the sizes 
and shapes of grass-forb-shrub interspaces, as well as 
the mechanisms for the formation and maintenance of 
spatial patterns. Additional research needs are:
• Increased understanding of reference conditions 
and the natural range of variation across ecologi-
cal gradients such as latitude and longitude, soils, 
topography, and climate in Southwest frequent-fire 
forests, especially in dry mixed-conifer.
• Increased understanding of differences between 
ponderosa pine and dry mixed-conifer forests in 
reference conditions and the historical types, fre-
quencies, severities of disturbances, and responses 
of vegetation. Of particular need are:
(1) A greater understanding of variation of 
reference conditions (composition, structure, and 
spatial pattern) in forest subtypes and different 
plant associations.
(2) How reference conditions influenced the 
effects of fire on tree regeneration and mortality 
in forest subtypes and in the transition zones 
between subtypes.
(3) The effectiveness of restoration treatments 
at achieving desired objectives, especially on 
avoiding the conversion of these subtypes to 
alternative plant associations.
• Increased understanding of ecosystem processes and 
functions as they respond to restoration of the com-
position and structure of frequent-fire forests.

• Increased understanding of the mechanisms of spa-
tial pattern formation (e.g., aggregated and random 
tree distributions) within- and among-groups, in-
cluding the presence, abundance, and dispersion of 
individual trees.
• An understanding of historical roles of insect and 
disease in shaping forest composition, structure, and 
spatial pattern, and the effects of restoration on the 
frequency and severity of insect and disease distur-
bances at all scales.
• An understanding of the effects of exotic insect, dis-
ease, plant, and animal species, and how these may 
alter forest composition, structure, processes, and 
functions.
• Increased understanding of the efficacy of fire versus 
tree cutting only and cutting combined with fire at 
achieving the desired composition, structure, pro-
cesses, and functions in frequent-fire forests at all 
scales.
• Identification of management strategies for restor-
ing composition and structure in transitional zones 
between forest types and future directions given cli-
mate change.
• Development and refinement of new and existing 
tools and metrics for measuring spatial heterogene-
ity at ecologically meaningful scales.
• Improved understanding of wildlife habitat and 
wildlife uses of restored composition and structure 
of frequent-fire forests.
• Improved understanding of long-term effects of res-
toration and maintenance treatments (mechanical, 
fire, and a combination of the two) on water yield 
and quality.
• Assessment of ecological, economic, and social 
benefits and costs (e.g., invasive species) of differ-
ent restoration methodologies and implementation 
practices, such as methods for treating slash, tree 
marking approaches, spatial scales of treatment, and 
frequency of maintenance treatments.
• Exploration of management applications to imple-
ment our framework on broad landscapes in an 
economically efficient manner.

Our forest restoration framework provides manag-
ers and researchers a review of existing knowledge 
regarding the historical compositions and structures 
in Southwest frequent-fire forests and how these op-
erated through feedback mechanisms that sustained 
their characteristic compositions, structures, and func-
tions. Current forest conditions, the cumulative conse-
quences of various human activities that altered his-
torical conditions, are reviewed in light of historical 
conditions with a focus on how human-caused changes 
lowered the resistance and resilience of these forests to 
historical disturbance agents that themselves have be-
come more intense and frequent. Guided by our under-
standing of how the composition, structure, and spatial 
pattern of historical frequent-fire forests affected their 
resistance, resilience, and responses to disturbances, 
our restoration framework identifies desired key com-
positional and structural elements of these forests and 
provides management recommendations for restoring 
those key elements. We believe implementation of our 
framework provides opportunities for re-establishing 
characteristic processes such as frequent, low-severity 
fire and ecological functions such as habitat, biodiver-
sity, and food webs.
The key compositional and structural elements of 
historical frequent-fire ponderosa pine and dry mixed-
conifer forests in the Southwest can be envisioned over 
time as a shifting mosaic of groups of trees with in-
terlocking crowns; single trees; open grass-forb-shrub 
interspaces; and dispersed snags, logs, woody debris 
(Larson and Churchill 2012; Long and Smith 2000; 
Reynolds and others 1992). Research shows that the 
degrees of tree aggregation; sizes and numbers of tree 
groups; numbers and dispersion of single trees; sizes 
and shapes of grass-forb-shrub interspaces; and num-
bers, sizes, and dispersions of snags, logs, and woody 
debris in reference conditions varied among sites by 
soil, topography, climate, disturbance regime, and 
past stochastic events. Our restoration framework rec-
ognizes this site-to-site variability and articulates the 
importance of restoring that variability by using exist-
ing evidence (e.g., old trees, snags, stumps, and logs) 
and biophysical site indicators as guides for restoring 
local variability. In our view, restoration of spatial and 
non-spatial elements of forest structure on a per-site 
basis is the most practical, science-based strategy to 
return frequent-fire forest ecosystems in the Southwest 
to resistant, resilient, and responsive conditions that 
will best position them to adapt to future disturbance 
regimes and climates (Larson and Churchill 2012; 
Millar and others 2007). We intend this framework 
and its application to be flexible and adaptive (i.e., 
learn-as-you-go) and to evolve with accumulation of 
knowledge, and for its conceptual approach to provide 
a blueprint against which management plans and prac-
tices can be evaluated.

Glossary
Age class is defined as trees that originated within a 
relatively distinct range of years. Typically, the 
range of years is considered to fall within 20 percent 
of the average maturity (e.g., if 100 years is required 
to reach maturity, then there would be five 20-year 
age classes) (Helms 1998).
Basal area is the cross-sectional area of all stems of 
a species or all stems in a stand measured at breast 
height (4.5 ft above the ground) and expressed per 
unit of land area.
Biodiversity is the variety and abundance of life 
forms, processes, functions, and structures of plants, 
animals, and other living organisms, including the 
relative complexity of species in communities, gene 
pools, and ecosystems at spatial scales from local to 
regional to global (Helms 1998).
Canopy cover (see forest canopy cover)
Canopy fuels are all burnable materials, including live 
and dead foliage, lichen, stems, and branch wood 
located in the forest canopy.
Characteristic (natural) conditions (e.g., vegeta-
tion composition and structure), processes (e.g., 
disturbance regimes), and functions (e.g., habitat, 
biodiversity, and food webs) of a forest type that are 
present under the natural range of variability.
Clump refers to (1) the aggregate of stems issuing 
from the same root, rhizome system, or stool; or (2) 
an isolated generally dense group of trees (Helms 
1998). A clump is relatively isolated from other 
clumps or trees within a group of trees, but a stand-
alone clump of trees can function as a tree group or 
a single structure (Fig. 4).
Coarse woody debris is dead woody material on the 
ground greater than 3 inches in diameter, including 
logs (Figs. 12 and 13).
Composition is the array of species present in an 
ecosystem. In forestry, this term often refers to the 
proportion of each tree species in a stand expressed 
as a percentage of the total number, basal area, or 
volume of all tree species in the stand (Helms 1998).
Diameter at breast height (DBH) is the diameter of a 
tree typically measured at 4.5 ft above ground level.
Disturbance (characteristic and uncharacteristic): 
Any relatively discrete event in time that disrupts 
ecosystems, communities, or population structure 
and changes resources, substrate availability, or the 
physical environment (Helms 1998). Characteristic 
disturbances are those whose extent, frequency, and 
severity fall within the natural range of variability. 
Uncharacteristic disturbances are outside the natural 
range of variability and interrupt characteristic pro-
cesses and functions.
Dry mixed-conifer forests occupy the warmer and 
drier sites between elevations of 5000 and 10,000 ft 
and are characterized by a relatively frequent historic 
fire regime (<35 years fire return interval), result-
ing in surface fire and infrequently, mixed-severity 
fire effects. This forest type is typically dominated 
by shade-intolerant species such as ponderosa pine, 
with minor association of aspen, Douglas-fir, and 
Southwestern white pine during early seral stages. 
More shade-tolerant conifers such as Douglas-fir, 
white fir, and blue spruce are dominant at climax 
stages. In the Southwestern United States, this type 
is primarily described by the Society of American 
Foresters cover types interior Douglas-fir and white 
fir.
Ecological (ecosystem) health (see forest health)
Ecological restoration is the process of assisting the 
recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, 
damaged, or destroyed. Restoration initiates or ac-
celerates ecosystem recovery with respect to its 
health (productivity), processes, and functions (bio-
diversity, food webs, and sustainability) (adapted 
from SER 2004).
Ecosystem integrity is the state or condition of an eco-
system that displays the biodiversity characteristic 
of the reference, such as species composition and 
community structure, and is fully capable of sustain-
ing normal ecosystem functioning (SER 2004).
Ecosystem resiliency is the ability of an ecosystem to 
absorb and recover from disturbances without alter-
ing its inherent functions (SER 2004).
Ecosystem services are the benefits people obtain from 
ecosystems, including provisioning services such as 
food and water; regulating services such as flood and 
disease control; cultural services such as spiritual, 
recreational, and cultural benefits; and supporting 
services such as nutrient cycling, that maintain the 
conditions for life on Earth (Millennium Ecosystem 
Assessment 2005).

USDA Forest Service RMRS-GTR-310.  2013. 
71
Ecosystem stability is the ability of an ecosystem to 
maintain its given trajectory (SER 2004).
Ecosystem sustainability is the capacity of ecosys-
tems to maintain ecosystem services in perpetuity 
without degradation of its productivity and func-
tion at all scales. For example, in the context of 
our restoration framework, sustainability results in 
maintaining the key elements in space and time.
Even-aged forests are forests that are comprised of 
one or two distinct age classes of trees.
Evolutionary environment refers to the range of abi-
otic and biotic conditions that have exerted selection 
pressure on and are critical to the survival of species 
or groups of species (Kalies and others 2012; Moore 
and others 1999).
Fine fuels are fast-drying dead or live fuels, gener-
ally characterized by a comparatively high surface 
area-to-volume ratio, that are less than 0.25 inch in 
diameter and have a time-lag of one hour or less. 
These fuels (grass, leaves, needles, etc.) ignite 
readily and are consumed rapidly by fire when dry 
(NWCG 2012).
Fire regime refers to the patterns of fire occurrences, 
frequency, size, severity, and sometimes vegetation 
and fire effects in a given area or ecosystem. A fire 
regime is a generalization based on fire histories at 
individual sites (McPherson and others 1990).
Fire return interval is the number of years between 
two successive fires in a specified area (McPherson 
and others 1990).
Forest canopy cover is the proportion of ground or 
water covered by a vertical projection of the outer-
most perimeter of tree canopies, regardless of tree 
spatial arrangement.
Forest health is the state or condition of forest eco-
systems in which its attributes (i.e., productivity) 
are expressed within ”normal” ranges of activity 
relative to its ecological stage of development. A 
restored ecosystem expresses health if it functions 
normally relative to its reference ecosystem (adapt-
ed from SER 2004).
Frameworks provide a set of assumptions, concepts, 
values, and practices that constitute a way of view-
ing reality (American Heritage Dictionary 2011).
Free thinning is the removal of trees to control stand 
spacing and favor desired trees using a combination 
of thinning criteria without regard to crown position 
(Helms 1998).
Frequent-fire forests are forests with fire regime 1, 
those forests with fire frequency <35 years (Schmidt 
and others 2002).
Functions (ecological functions) are the outcomes of 
ecosystem components and processes (e.g., interac-
tions within and among species). Examples include 
primary and secondary production and mutualistic 
relationships. Ecosystem functions are broadly cat-
egorized as regulation functions, habitat functions, 
production functions (e.g., genetic and medicinal 
resources), and information functions (e.g., spiri-
tual and historic information) (De Groot and others 
2002).
Group refers to a cluster of two or more trees with 
interlocking or nearly interlocking crowns (Fig. 4 
and 12) at maturity surrounded by grass-forb-shrub 
interspaces (Fig. 8). Size of tree groups is typically 
variable depending on forest type and site condi-
tions and can range from fractions of an acre (i.e., 
a two-tree group), such as in ponderosa pine or dry 
mixed-conifer forests, to many acres, as is common 
in wet mixed-conifer and spruce fir forests. Trees 
within groups are typically non-uniformly spaced, 
some of which may be tightly clumped.
Group cutting (selection) is the removed of small 
groups of trees to establish of new age classes 
(Helms 1998).
Improvement harvests involve the removal of poorly 
formed or low-vigor trees to improve stand produc-
tivity and/or quality (Helms 1998).
Interspaces are areas not currently under the verti-
cal projection of the outermost perimeter of tree 
canopies (Fig. 8). They are generally composed of 
grass-forb-shrub communities but could also be 
areas with scattered rock or exposed mineral soil. 
Interspaces do not include meadows, grasslands, 
rock outcroppings, and wetlands (i.e., exclusions ad-
jacent to and sometimes within forested landscapes).
Leave trees or snags (see residual (leave) trees or 
snags)
Matrix refers to the background cover type of an area. 
In frequent-fire forests, grass-forb-shrub communi-
ties form the background matrix upon which tree 
groups and individual trees are spatially arranged. 
It is the most extensive and connected landscape 
element that plays the dominant role in landscape 

72 
USDA Forest Service RMRS-GTR-310.  2013.
functioning. The expression of this matrix between 
tree groups and individual trees is referred to as in-
terspace. The location of tree groups and individual 
trees on the matrix and the proportion of patches 
represented by the matrix will change over time due 
to disturbance.
Mixed-severity fire regimes are characterized by 
closely juxtaposed forest patches affected by low- 
and high-severity burning (Fulé and others 2003).
Natural (historical, characteristic) range of varia-
tion describes the variability of ecological conditions 
(e.g., reference compositional and structural con-
ditions) and the spatial and temporal variation in 
these conditions during a period of time specified to 
represent characteristic conditions (i.e., conditions 
relatively unaffected by people) for an ecosystem in 
a specific geographical area (Kaufmann and others 
1994; Landres and others 1999).
Old growth in Southwestern forested ecosystems is de-
fined differently than the traditional definition based 
on Northwestern infrequent-fire forests. Due to 
large differences among Southwest forest types and 
their characteristic disturbances, old growth forests 
vary extensively in tree size, age classes, presence 
and abundance of structural elements, stability, and 
presence of understory. Important structural fea-
tures of old growth in frequent-fire forests are large 
trees, old trees, age variability, snags, large dead and 
downed fuels, and between-patch structural vari-
ability (Fig. 9 and Table 10) (Kaufmann and others 
2007).
Openness is estimated as the inverse of forest canopy 
cover for a given area. For example, a forest with 
70 percent canopy cover would have openness of 
30 percent.
Patches are areas larger than tree groups in which the 
vegetation composition and structure are relatively 
homogeneous (sensu Forman 1995). Patches can be 
composed of randomly arranged trees or multiple 
tree groups, and they can be even-aged or uneven-
aged. Patches comprise the mid-scale, ranging in 
size from 10-1000 acres. Patches and stands are 
roughly synonymous.
Pattern (see spatial pattern)
Plant associations are plant community types based 
on land management potential, successional pat-
terns, and species composition (Helms 1998).
Ponderosa pine forests are widespread in the 
Southwest occurring at elevations ranging from 
6000-7500 ft and occupying warmer and drier 
sites within the montane forest life zone. These 
forests are characterized by a relatively frequent 
historic fire regime resulting in surface fire effects. 
Ponderosa pine is the dominant tree species in this 
forest type, but other tree species may be present, 
including Gambel oak, pinyon pine, and juniper spe-
cies. This forest type often has a shrubby understory 
mixed with grasses and forbs but sometimes occurs 
as savannah with extensive grasslands interspersed 
between widely spaced clumps or individual trees. 
The ponderosa pine type is distinguished from dry 
mixed-conifer types by the plant community suc-
cessional stages. The ponderosa pine forest type is 
dominated at all successional stages from seral to 
climax by ponderosa pine. Ponderosa pine often 
dominates early seral stages of dry mixed-conifer 
forests also, but these types are not considered to 
be ponderosa pine forest types because the climax 
species composition is dominated by other conifer 
species or ponderosa pine in mixtures with other co-
nifer species.
Processes (ecological processes) are the dynamic at-
tributes of ecosystems in terms of matter and energy, 
including interactions among organisms and interac-
tions between organisms and their environment (De 
Groot and others 2002; SER 2004). Examples of 
processes are: evolution, fire and insect disturbanc-
es, photosynthesis, seed dispersal, decomposition, 
and soil formation.
Reference conditions are conditions existing prior 
to the suppression or exclusion of the primary pro-
cesses and mechanisms influencing a system along 
a natural trajectory (sensu Kaufmann and others 
1994). The reference can consist of one or several 
specified locations that contain model ecosystems, 
a written description, or a combination of both. 
Information collected on the reference includes both 
biotic and abiotic components (SER 2004)
Regeneration sites are tree-free areas created by 
group cutting for the purpose of establishing tree 
regeneration.
Residual (leave) trees or snags are those remaining 
after an intermediate or partial cutting of a stand 
(Helms 1998).

Restoration (see ecological restoration)
Sanitation harvests involve the removal of trees to 
improve stand health by stopping or reducing the 
actual or anticipated spread of insects and disease 
(Helms 1998).
Safe zones (fire-free zones) are microsites where 
seedlings can establish and grow above the lethal 
flaming zone. Safe zones can be created by fire, such 
as the ash bed of a consumed log.
Single tree selection cutting is removal of individu-
al trees of all size classes more or less uniformly 
throughout the stand to promote growth of remain-
ing trees and to provide space for regeneration 
(Helms 1998).
Site index is an indicator of site quality expressed in 
terms of the average height of trees (defined as a 
certain number of dominants, codominants, or the 
largest and tallest trees per unit area) of a given spe-
cies at a specified index or base age (Helms 1998).
Snags are standing dead or partially dead trees (snag-
topped), often missing many or all limbs. They 
provide essential wildlife habitat for many species 
and are important for forest ecosystem function 
(Fig. 12).
Spatial pattern is the spatial arrangement of elements 
at the fine-, mid-, and landscape-scales that deter-
mine the function of a landscape as an ecological 
system (adapted from Helms 1998).
Stand density index is a widely used measure that 
expresses relative stand density based on some stan-
dard condition such as the relationship of number of 
trees to the stand quadratic mean diameter (Helms 
1998) or the biological maximum density for a spe-
cific species (Long 1985).
Stands are areas in which the biophysical site condi-
tions and the vegetation composition and structure 
are relatively homogeneous. Stands comprise the 
mid-scale, thus ranging in size from 100-1000 acres. 
Stands and patches are roughly synonymous
Structure is the physiognomy or architecture of an 
ecosystem with respect to the density, horizontal 
stratification, spatial pattern, and frequency distribu-
tion of vegetation (i.e., overstory, understory, etc.) 
size, age, and/or life form (adapted from SER 2004).
Surface fuel includes all fuels lying on or near the 
surface of the ground, consisting of leaf and needle 
litter, dead branch material, downed logs, bark, tree 
cones, and low stature living and dead plants (adapt-
ed from NWCG 2012).
Sustainability (see ecosystem sustainability)
Uneven-aged forests are forests that are comprised of 
three or more distinct age classes of trees, either in-
timately mixed or in small groups (Fig. 18) (Helms 
1998).
