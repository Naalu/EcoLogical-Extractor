ABSTRACT
Stump heights were measured on six clear-cut blocks in
the central interior of British Columbia using a systematic
sampling method. Felling method, ground slope, species
and stump diameter were analyzed to determine their ef-
fect on stump height. Mechanized felling with a feller-
buncher resulted in lower stumps by 5.5 cm on average
than those from manual felling with a chainsaw. The wide
range (9.6 cm to 23.4 cm) of the average stump heights
sampled from six clear-cut units indicates that other fac-
tors such as slope, species and stump diameter may influ-
ence stump height.  When considering tree species, the
feller-buncher left lower stump heights for subalpine fir
and white spruce, while chainsaw felling resulted in lower
stumps for Douglas-fir. Average stump and feller-buncher
stump heights tended to increase as percent slope in-
creased up to 45%, but the opposite trend was found in
chainsaw felled sites with slopes greater than 45%. Both
feller-buncher and chainsaw felling methods resulted in
lower stumps as the average stump diameter increased.
On ground slopes less than 30% and stump diameters
between 30 and 70 cm, our analysis suggested that feller-
buncher felling resulted in lower stump heights than
chainsaw felling. Chainsaw felling can cause stump-pulls,
slabs, and unevenness at the bottom of the tree being
felled, requiring a further reduction of wood that could
potentially be used for solid wood products. Feller-buncher
felling, however, results in greater wood volume waste as
the result of a thicker saw blade kerf than does chainsaw
felling.

tion, log quality.
INTRODUCTION
Feller-bunchers are the most typical felling machine for
mechanized, ground-based harvesting systems in the in-
terior of British Columbia (BC), often teaming with grapple
skidders for off-road skidding and a processor for central
processing at a landing.  Feller-bunchers are highly pro-
ductive machines for felling on gentle slopes, and are oc-
casionally used on steeper ground for skyline and heli-
copter yarding. While feller-bunchers effectively control
felling direction and bunch felled trees, large trees (>70 cm
diameter at breast height (DBH)) may require multiple cuts
from two or more cutting directions instead of cutting
through a tree with a single-cut. Rocky ground conditions
in harvesting sites can cause damage to tracks, felling
teeth, and felling discs.
In general, chainsaw felling has no tree size or ground
slope limitations while maintaining a reasonable produc-
tion rate. It was often observed in BC that feller-bunchers
leave large trees (>70 cm DBH) uncut for chainsaw felling
in a mechanized harvesting operation because chainsaw
felling can be more productive with such large trees.
Chainsaws can also be effectively used to cut a tree at the
ground level on a rocky ground with minimal concerns for
equipment damage. Beside tree size and ground surface
conditions, chainsaws are the primary tool for felling on
steeper ground where skyline or helicopter yarding is con-
sidered for the primary transport of logs. When ground-
based skidding is used, a cable skidder equipped with a
winch is often teamed with chainsaw felling. Chainsaw
felling in a high density stand filled with small-diameter
trees, however, may not be as productive as feller-buncher
felling and can raise safety concerns for chainsaw fellers
because trees being felled often catch on the standing
trees, instead of falling onto the ground. This situation
can be severe in a light thinning treatment (i.e., smaller
number of trees removed).
A conventional chainsaw felling method that uses face
and back cuts is commonly used in BC. This method leaves
an uneven cut at the bottom of a tree felled, which is then
removed during tree processing at the landing or log
processing at the mill. When the chainsaw is used for
felling, stump-pull (hinge wood left in the middle of the
stump) and slabbing (wood on the outside portion of the
log left at the edge of the stump) may result. These un-
even cuts and felling defects affect the process of manu-
facturing solid products such as lumber. Ryan and Han [4]
found that 17% of stumps left by chainsaw felling con-
tained stump-pull, or slabbing or both.
Ryan and Han [4] also stated that mechanized felling
methods display a significantly lower average stump height
than manual felling. Measured stump heights from mecha-

nized felling were found to be 8.8 cm lower than those
from manual felling (13.1 vs. 21.9 cm). Boston and Dysart
[2] observed a similar trend: they found that chainsaw
felling left higher stumps (21.1 cm average) compared to
five other mechanized felling methods (averages of 4.6 to
14.0 cm). An average stump height of 17.7 cm was also
found in three mixed forests felled using continuous disk
sawheads in Virginia [6]. Boston and Dysart’s’ observa-
tions on leaving high stumps with mechanized felling were
primarily due to the machine operator’s concerns over
cutting disk damage and the desire to achieve high pro-
duction rates.
Under-utilization of wood fiber due to high stumps, poor
bucking practices, and log breakage often occurs during
harvesting operations. Wood waste can be significant if
we consider the accumulative effects of such poor log-
ging practices occurring on many harvesting sites [2, 5].
The bottom of a tree also contains the most valuable por-
tion of each tree unless defects such as decay, butt swell,
and crook are present. Lowering stump heights contrib-
utes to the maximum use of this high quality material.
High stumps are considered to be the result of poor
felling practices, and BC’s logging residue and waste
standard requires stump height to be lower than 30 cm for
all harvest sites [1]. Unless there are physical obstruc-
tions or safety precautions, waste in stumps is classified
as avoidable waste that is subject to a fine if it exceeds the
maximum allowable waste. Woody materials left on har-
vesting sites, including high stumps are considered as
“under-utilized”. The current BC waste standard states
for the dry interior of BC that the waste per hectare has to
be less than 4 m3 on each harvest unit to avoid financial
penalty [1]. Based on authors’ observations on felling
operations in the interior BC, stump heights of less than
15 cm can be easily achieved when using a feller-buncher
on gentle slopes (<30%).
Potential value loss and poor utilization of the available
wood resources due to high stumps have been cited often
to emphasize the importance of leaving low stumps for
better utilization of wood [2, 4, 5, 6]. For example, Murphy
and Buse [5] noted that approximately 30% of the value
lost during the felling process is due to wood loss in high
stumps. The loss is highly variable: US $30/ha (mechani-
cal felling; [6]) to US $1,038/ha (chainsaw felling; [2]).
Then-current values for sawlogs or wood chips and sen-
sitivity analysis over several average stump heights were
often used to estimate potential financial impacts due to
high stumps.
High stumps can also cause negative effects on har-
vesting equipment, worker safety, and tree planting. There
are a few exceptions that require high stumps. For exam-
ple, high stumps are used as guyline anchors for skyline
yarding. However, leaving low stumps normally results in
benefits that include the following:
· Higher productivity of primary transport (stump-to-land-
ing). Low stumps provide smooth surface of trails for
skidding or forwarding, and allows faster turns and a
more comfortable ride to the operator.
· Less machine damage to equipment and low mainte-
nance cost. High stumps may cause high centering or
stretching of equipment tracks due to the track cleats
catching on high stumps.
· Reduced stand damage in partial cutting. Skidder or
forwarder operators tend to avoid the high stumps within
a skid trail to reduce possible hang-ups and for opera-
tor comfort (a smoother ride).  This widens skid trails
and can cause damage to residual trees near skid trails.
· Facilitation of the mechanical site preparations for tree
planting. Forestry equipment can more efficiently move
around the harvested units as low stumps do not hinder
operations such as mechanical site preparations and
tree planting. Site preparation cost could be reduced by
as much as $US148/ha [3].
· Tree breakage during felling. Tree breakage may occur
when trees are felled across or on high stumps.
· Operational efficiency during winching and yarding
phases. Hang-ups due to high stumps often cause de-
lay in skyline yarding or skidder winching.
· Promoting improved forest health. Mountain pine bee-
tle is highly destructive insect in BC, and preventive or
salvage harvesting of infested trees requires that the
stumps be cut low to avoid leaving the insects in the
stumps.
To lower stump height in any timber harvesting opera-
tions, it is important to clearly understand how harvesting
attributes can affect final stump height. These attributes
include felling methods (chainsaw vs. mechanized fell-
ing), slope, tree size, species and ground conditions. A
number of previous studies investigated average stump
height and potential wood waste associated with high
stumps resulting from chainsaw and mechanized felling,
but did not effectively evaluate other variables determin-
ing stump height . The objective of this study was to
compare two felling methods, namely chainsaw and feller-
buncher, in relation to stump height through the relation-
ship between the response variable (stump height) and
the independent variables (ground slope, stump diameter,
and species). These outcomes should help maximize po-

tential benefits that can accrue from leaving lower stumps.
STUDY  METHODS
Six clearcut sites were randomly selected near Prince
George located in central BC, based on availability for the
study, felling methods used, and logging season (Table
1). Conifer species including white spruce (Picea glauca
(Moench.) Voss.), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Doug-
las var. latifolia Engelmann), subalpine fir (Abies
lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.), and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga
menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) were the major component
(>95%), mixed with some hardwood species such as paper
birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) and cottonwood
(Populus trichocarpa Torr. & A. Gray). Ground slopes
varied and affected equipment selection for felling and
primary transport (stump-to-landing). There was little (<20
cm) or no snow accumulation on the ground due to high
crown closure and little snow falling during the winter
harvesting period. Snow data for winter logging sites was
not collected. Depending on depth, snow levels can be-
come an important factor affecting stump height, but were
considered to be insignificant in this study. Stems were
felled with a Madill 3200B feller-buncher equipped with a
61-cm hot saw and by two chainsaw felling crews. Both
machine operator and chainsaw fellers had more than one
year of felling experience.
Fixed, 0.1 ha-circular sampling plots were systematically
located over each of the study sites. Slope was taken in
both uphill and downhill directions, from the plot center.
Twenty sampling plots were distributed across each study
site, but some plots located on landings and unit bounda-
ries were removed (Table 1). Total area sampled per har-
vest site ranged from 1.7 to 2.0 ha. The sample size was
determined using the following equation and guidelines

est and the narrowest face of the stump surface. Stumps
smaller than 15 cm in diameter were excluded from the
study as they were not considered to be commercial trees.
Two log defects were also observed: slab (wood left on
the outside of the stump; Figure 3) and stump-pull (wood
left in or cross the middle of the stump; Figures 2 and 3).
Slab and stump-pull height measurements were taken for
the highest points beyond the cut face of the stump. Both
slabs and stump-pulls less than 10 cm in length and 2 cm
in width and thickness were not recorded because they
had negligible impacts on log quality.
Stump height data was evaluated for outliers and nor-
mality by reviewing residual plots, scatter plots and histo-
grams before implementing statistical data analysis. Ex-
amination of the residuals from a general linear model re-
vealed a considerable non-constant variability across lev-

els of species, slope and stump diameter, and thus natural
logarithm transformation of stump height data was taken
to stabilize variance. A General Linear Model (GLM) analy-
sis using the SAS program version 8.02 (©1999-2001; SAS
Institute) was performed to compare the average stump
height between feller-buncher and chainsaw felling. The
interaction between felling method and each of the other
three independent variables (species, slope, stump diam-
eter) was also examined. The effects of slope, average
stump diameter, and species on stump height were as-
sessed through Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons,
along with an analysis of covariance for each variable.
Feller-buncher felling has a higher volume of wood waste
associated with the thickness of the saw blade kerf than
does chainsaw felling. Based on a survey on the felling

head of feller-bunchers and harvesters during the event
of harvesting equipment exhibition (Forest Expo 2000) in
Prince George, BC, the kerf thickness for nine models of
feller-buncher ranged from 5 to 6 cm, compared to 0.75 cm
to 1 cm for 7 models of chainsaw. This inherent difference
(5 cm on average) of kerf thickness between feller-buncher
and chainsaw was used to estimate the wood volume waste
associated with each harvesting method.
RESULTS  AND  DISCUSSION
In total there were 1,658 stumps measured from six har-
vest units (Table 2). The average stump height (19.8 cm; n
= 794) from chainsaw felling was significantly higher than
the one (14.3 cm; n = 864) from feller-buncher felling
(p<0.05). This study confirmed the results of a high stump
study conducted by Ryan and Han [4], which indicated
that chainsaw felling left higher stumps than mechanical
felling. However, the difference of the average stump height
between felling methods in their study (8.8 cm) was larger
than the result from this study (5.5 cm).
The wide range (9.6 cm to 23.4 cm) of the average stump
heights sampled from six clear-cut units indicates that other
factors such as slope, species and stump diameter may
influence stump height. The visual examination of the
residuals from a general linear model revealed non-con-
stant variability across three independent variables (slope,
species and stump diameter) between two felling meth-
ods. The natural logarithmic transformation of the response
variable (stump height) was performed to stabilize the vari-
ability. The final outcomes of the analyses were converted
back to the original scale for interpretation.
SPECIES  VS.  TWO  FELLING  METHODS
Examination of the profile plot showed the feller-buncher
having a lower mean stump height for the species of white
spruce, lodgepole pine, and subalpine fir, but the chainsaw
had the lower mean stump height for Douglas-fir (Figure
4). Two species variables were not well represented in the
data set: cottonwood (n = 1) and birch (n = 3 for chainsaw
felling and n =11 for feller-buncher felling). These two

species were removed from the analysis data since the
stump height comparison between felling methods would
not be much value due to lack of observations.
There was no significant effect of species on stump
height (p = 0.0590), but an analysis of the model (ln_height
= felling method + species + felling method*species)
yielded a significant F-test for the interaction term of fell-
ing method*species (p<0.0001). The coefficient of deter-
mination (R2) was low at 0.082.  As the interaction term is
significant in this model, Tukey-Kramer multiple compari-
sons of the mean values were performed and showed that
the differences in the mean ln_height between the two
felling methods were significantly large for spruce
(p<0.0001) and subalpine fir (p<0.0001), but not for
lodgepole pine (p = 0.9392) and Douglas-fir (p = 0.1166).
This result can be explained by butt flare that is a swell of
the main stem near the ground contact area. Notable butt
flare in a log can cause processing problems at an auto-
mated sawmill and is typically removed during the log
preparation process.  Spruce and subalpine fir are known
to have a butt flare while Douglas-fir and lodgepole pine
are not. A chainsaw feller intentionally cuts a tree above
the obvious swelling portion as they are aware of this
sawmilling requirement.  A feller-buncher operator, how-
ever, cannot see well the base of the stem and swell and as
a result cuts the tree at the lowest possible height given
machine and cutting head constraints.  The relationship
between chainsaw felling and species may be explained
by the market value of each species. Chainsaw fellers make
additional efforts to leave low stumps when falling Doug-
las-fir trees because commercial value of this species is
higher in BC than pine, spruce, and subalpine fir.
GROUND  SLOPE  VS.  TWO  FELLING  METHODS
There was a notable difference in slope on which stump
data were collected for the two felling methods; chainsaw
felling stump data were collected from ground slopes rang-
ing from 8% to 95% while stump data for feller-buncher
occurred on 2 to 45% slopes with 94 percent of the data
being observed at slopes of 30% or less (Figure 5). We
observed that on steep slopes, chainsaw fellers often po-
sitioned themselves at the downhill side of the tree to be
cut. This allows the feller to cut a tree at or close to the
ground level without physically bending to a great degree
(i.e., 90 degree), assisting the feller in cutting stumps low.
Flat ground often requires chainsaw fellers to increas-
ingly bend to cut a tree at ground level, resulting in stress
on a feller’s arms, back, and legs.
We examined the effect of felling method and slope on
stump height using the second model (ln_height = felling
method + slope + felling method*slope). The profile plot
of the interaction term showed consistently lower mean
stump heights for the feller-buncher felling for 2 to 32.5%
slopes (Figure 5). Four exceptions to the trend occurred at
10, 17.7, 22.5 and 27.5%. A multiple comparison analysis
with Tukey adjusted significance levels was performed to

evaluate a statistical difference between two felling meth-
ods over a wide range of ground slope. Comparisons over
the range of 2 to 17.5% showed that there was no signifi-
cant difference between the two felling methods (p>0.05).
The mean stump height for chainsaw felling, however,
was significantly higher than those of the feller-buncher
felling for 20 to 28.5% slopes (p <0.0066). At 45% slope,
the reverse of the trend occurred, where chainsaw felling
left a significantly lower mean stump height than feller-
buncher felling (p<0.0001). There were no other observa-
tions for feller-buncher felling data beyond a 45% slope.
Applying the method of analysis of covariance over an
interval of 2 to 30% slope allowed further interpretation of
the relationship between the felling method and ln_height.
This analysis method essentially was to fit regression lines
to the data, and the slopes of these lines were then com-
pared to determine the presence of interaction between
two felling methods over the interval of interest. The in-
teraction between two felling methods was not significant
(p = 0.1710), indicating that the regression lines were par-
allel. In the presence of parallelism, a test for the main
effects of two felling methods was significant (p<0.0001).
Significance of the test for main effects indicated that the
expected mean stump height resulting from chainsaw fell-
ing was 1.68 cm higher than the one that resulted from
feller-buncher felling over a slope range of 2% to 30%.
STUMP  DIAMETER  VS.  TWO  FELLING  METHODS
Both feller-buncher and chainsaw felling methods
tended to leave lower stumps as the average stump diam-
eter increased (Figure 6). This trend was more significantly
noticeable with feller-buncher felling (p<0.05), but no sig-
nificant relationship was found between the average stump
size and stump height for chainsaw felling (p>0.05). The
overall average stump diameter inside bark (n = 1658) was
43.2 cm with a standard deviation of 14.6 cm.
In implementing the model (ln_height = felling method
+ diameter + felling method*diameter), the interaction term
between felling method and diameter was significant at a
0.036 level. Comparisons were conducted by assessing
the presence of overlap between confidence intervals com-
puted for the two felling methods at each diameter value.
Bonferroni correction was used to control the Type I error
rate at 0.05. The results of these comparisons indicated
that there were no statistically significant differences in
mean values between two felling methods for stump diam-
eter (p>0.05).
Further inspection of the profile plot revealed a diam-
eter interval between 30 to 70 cm where mean ln_height
was consistently lower for the feller-buncher felling over
chainsaw felling (Figure 6). An analysis of covariance over
this interval allowed for the fitting of separate regression
lines to each of the felling methods. A test for interaction
over the diameter interval of interest was insignificant (p =
0.5313), indicating that two separate lines were parallel to
each other. A subsequent test of felling method effect also
indicated that there was a significant difference between
two felling methods at a difference of 1.44 cm over the
diameter interval of interest (p<0.0001).
WOOD  WASTE  DUE  TO  KERF  THICKNESS
AND  POOR  FELLING  PRACTICES
On average, the feller-buncher uses cutting teeth 5-cm
thicker than the one used on chainsaws. This inherent
difference of kerf thickness translates to an additional 0.44
m3 of wood waste per hectare from feller-buncher felling,
compared to chainsaw felling if the average stump diam-

eter is 43 cm and 650 stems per hectare are removed. Wood
volume waste associated with the thickness of the kerf
can be significant when considering the number of trees
that are cut by a feller-buncher during it’s life and that
feller-bunchers are one of the most common types of fell-
ing equipment being used on gentle grounds.  Chainsaw
felling, however, often used a face-cut to control felling
direction, resulted in the uneven bottom of a felled tree.
This may require an additional cut to remove the uneven-
ness at the landing or during the process of lumber manu-
facturing. The potential wood losses are illustrated in the
Figure 3.
For chainsaw felling, wood was ripped away from the
center (stump-pull) or the side (slab) of the tree and re-
mained attached to the stump as it falls. Stump-pulls and
slabs higher than 10 cm appeared on 4.1% (20 out of 485)
of the manually felled stumps with an average height of
38.2 cm. Our field observation during data collection indi-
cates that large size trees tend to have a higher proportion
of stump-pull, as saws may not have been able to cut
cleanly through the tree. This can cause a length reduc-
tion of boards produced from the wood volume affected
by stump pull and slab.
CONCLUSION
Mechanical felling resulted in lower stumps, by an av-
erage of 5.5 cm, relative to chainsaw felling, but stump
height was significantly affected by species, slope, and
average stump diameter. Feller-buncher felling left lower
average stump heights for the species of subalpine fir and
white spruce. For the analysis of average stump height
over a range of ground slope, the feller-buncher felling
method produced lower average stump heights between 2
to 30% slope. Similarly the average stump heights result-
ing  from feller-buncher felling were lower than those from
chainsaw felling for diameters between 30 and 70 cm. Thus,
feller-buncher felling would be a better choice than
chainsaw felling for ground slopes less than 30% and
stump diameters between 30 and 70 cm. Additionally, when
considering the harvesting of subalpine fir and white
spruce, the feller-buncher left lower stump heights, al-
though changing felling method between chainsaw and
feller-buncher in a mixed confer stand may not be practi-
cal.
Felling defects (stump-pull, slab and uneven cut) from
chainsaw felling cause additional wood waste to the value
loss due to high stumps. Feller-buncher felling, however,
results in more wood volume waste associated with the
thickness of saw blade kerf than does chainsaw felling.
Harvesting trees close to the ground level helps not only
improve potential value recovery, but also allows higher
operational efficiency for the follow-up tasks such as log
extraction and planting activities. Besides the few excep-
tions, the operational and economic benefits of lower stump
heights outweigh that of high stumps.
