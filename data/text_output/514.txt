Restoring the Ecological 
and Social Integrity of 
Greater Ecosystems

The Challenge
►The ecologic, economic, and social integrity 
of the American West has been declining at 
an accelerating rate throughout the past 
century
►Nowhere is the rate of loss as great as it is 
in landscapes once dominated by open 
long-needled pine savannas and forests
►Ponderosa pine forests are the most 
widespread of these threatened types 

Background
►Greater ecosystem context
►Threatened and endangered ecosystems
►Increased funding and focus on restoration 
and conservation of threatened wildlands 
and their embedded human communities
►Healthy Forest Restoration Act, Healthy 
Forest Initiative, Hazardous Fuel Reduction, 
Conservation Reserve Design

What exactly are greater ecosystems, 
anyway?
►Greater ecosystems are regional complexes 
of ecosystems with common landscape-level 
characteristics.
►They are linked by wide ranging wildlife, 
landscape scale disturbance regimes, and,
►human communities as keystone citizens 
among the community of organisms. 
►They typically occur at half-million to 2-
million acre in area.

How are restoration ecology, 
conservation biology, evolutionary 
theory, and human ecology linked?

Where are we? 
The greater ecosystems of the West are 
exhibiting alarming disease symptoms
►Population irruptions and population crashes
►Spread of invasive exotic plants
►Decreasing diversity, increasing 
homogeneity at all levels of the ecosystem
►Unnatural disturbance regimes: fire, insects
►Trajectory of spiraling decline of ecological 
and social system health

►Restoring and reconnecting naturalness to 
conserve biodiversity, enhance human 
habitats, and reduce unnatural fire and 
insect disturbances

Restoration vs. Fuel Breaks
►Fuel breaks
►Restoration corridors and patches
►The matrix past, present and future
►Urban: wildland interface
►Threatened human habitats
►Threatened wildlife habitats
►Conservation reserve networks

Mount Trumbull Wilderness
►Ecological restoration to break a crownfire 
alley
►3600 acres to the SW and downhill from the 
Mount Trumbull Wilderness

Kendrick Mountain Wilderness
►Proposed restoration corridor to the SW and 
downhill
►Not implemented (funding and anticipated 
political conflict)
►Pumpkin Fire

What is adaptive management?
►Ruthlessly embracing uncertainty
►Stakeholder-based structured learning
►Bayesian statistics—the theoretical 
underpinning of adaptive management
►The adaptive environmental assessment 
(AEA) workshop approach (Crawford S. 
Holling and Carl Walters)
►How much can a group get done in three 
days?

Thinking big, long-term, large area, 
and across the ecological hierarchy
►Thinking like a mountain, a watershed, a 
spotted owl…you get the picture
►Thought experiments in conservation 
planning
►If you were a time traveler from 40 yr in the 
future, what would you do?
►If you were an extraterrestrial interested in 
conserving biodiversity, what would you do?

What will be our landscape legacy?
►What kind of landscape would we like to 
have inherited?
►What kind of landscape would we like to 
pass along to future generations?
►Durward Allen— Our Wildlife Legacy 1954
►The legacy forest concept—Covington and 
others 1994


Endangered Species Act
“To provide a means whereby the 
ecosystems upon which 
endangered species and 
threatened species depend may be 
conserved…”


Most Endangered Terrestrial Ecosystems 
in U.S. 
(in terms of extent of decline)
►Grasslands
►Savannas (including
open-canopied forests)
►Barrens



From Stein
et al. (2000)



As ecosystems become
endangered, so do the 
species associated 
with them

Goals of Biological Conservation 
(Noss and Cooperrider 1994 Conservation Biology)
►Representing all kinds of ecosystems, across their 
natural range of variation, in protected areas
►Maintaining viable populations of all native species 
in natural patterns of abundance and distribution
►Sustaining ecological and evolutionary processes 
within their natural ranges of variability
►Building a conservation network that is adaptable 
to environmental change

Goals of Ecological Restoration
(Covington 2000 Science)
►Restoring ecosystems to conditions 
consistent with their evolutionary 
environments
►Connecting sustainable human communities 
with sustainable wildlands
►Conserving wildlands for present and future 
generations

Loss of natural conditions and evol. habitats
Historic or Desired Condition
Current Condition
Ecological restoration
Habitat fragmentation
Restoration of connecting corridors
Road and housing development 
Develop w/n conservation context
Increasing exotic species
Control exotics and recover natives
Declining quality of life for people
Restore ecol. and econ. 
Integrity of greater 
ecosystems

Reference Restoration 
Thinning Treatment
►Retain trees which predate settlement
►Retain postsettlement trees needed to re-
establish presettlement structure
►Thin excess trees (cutting or jackpotting)
►Rake heavy fuels from base of trees
►Burn to emulate natural disturbance 
regime
►Seed with natives/control exotics



Change Basic Prescription for 
Specific Resource Objectives
►Might leave more trees to accommodate 
specific resource management objectives, 
e.g., screening cover for human or wildlife 
habitat goals, future wood harvesting, 
favoring specific uses
►Might leave fewer trees to accommodate 
other objectives, e.g., to favor viewsheds, 
wildlife goals, grazing, water balance

Alternative Restoration 
Thinning Prescriptions 
Produce Very Different 
Outcomes

Burn Only

Minimal Thinning

Full Restoration

It is locally, on particular 
sites and involving 
particular people, where 
conservation is  
implemented.  
However, in each case we 
should ask: “What can I 
do on this site that will 
contribute most 
meaningfully to the 
restoration and 
conservation of greater 
ecosystems?”

It matters what we do.
►Conserving critical landscape components is 
essential
►Half-hearted measure are likely to be ineffective
►Strategic investment in getting adaptive 
conservation on the ground is imperative
►Integrating the science and practice of 
conservation planning, conservation biology, 
restoration ecology, and adaptive management 
must be done now, not later
