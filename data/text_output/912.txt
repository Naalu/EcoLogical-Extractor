We expand on a budget constrained, wildﬁre program optimization model to include a decision variable input
for ecosystem health and ﬁre resilience (H). With ecosystem health and ﬁre resilience as a decision variable, two
ecosystem states are delineated; the ecosystem can be within or outside its range of variability. The Southwest
ponderosa pine ecosystem is used to illustrate the eﬀects of fuels or restoration treatments on the decision
variable input H within the probabilistic production function for wildﬁre losses. To estimate the health and ﬁre
resilience of the ecosystem, a short-term metric of ecosystem health (trees per acre for Southwest ponderosa
pine) is used. Analysis of how the state of the ecosystem aﬀects the optimization of the probabilistic production
function for wildﬁre loss is carried out on the two ecosystem states. Results indicate that if the ecosystem is
outside its range of variability, optimization of the objective function cannot be achieved. However, if the
ecosystem is within its range of variability or if the ecosystem is transitioned within its range of variability
through fuels or restoration treatments, the objective function can be optimized with respect to the decision
input variables.
1. Introduction
The economics of wildﬁre has its beginnings in the United States
with
early
works
published
at
the
start
of
the
20th
century.
Understanding of how ﬁre aﬀects natural capital stocks and social
welfare has evolved since its early inception into the decision-making
process. This paper focuses on how the health of the ecosystem aﬀects
the probability of losses associated with wildﬁre. Additionally, the
dynamics of restoration and fuels treatment in altering the ecological
state are introduced into predicting the probability of loss.
A recent USDA report shows wildﬁre suppression expenditure rising
from 16% of the Forest Service budget in 1995 to 52% of the budget in
2015 (USDA, 2015). Current estimates for 2017's wildﬁre suppression ex-
penditures are surpassing $2 billion, making 2017 the most expensive year
ever in terms of wildﬁre suppression costs. With increased expenditure on
wildﬁre suppression costs, expenditures on other non-ﬁre related programs
within the Forest Service's budget are being reduced. For example, the
Vegetation and Watershed Management Program is responsible for re-
storation, enhancement, and post-ﬁre restoration on National Forest System
lands. Over the past 15 years the Vegetation and Watershed Management
Program's budget has been reduced by 24%. Although classiﬁed as a non-
ﬁre program, the Vegetation and Watershed Management Program plays a
signiﬁcant role in shaping the landscape where potential wildﬁres may
occur. Are current budgets for the wildﬁre suppression program not ac-
counting for other programs that impact expenditures or losses resulting
from wildﬁres? Showing that expenditures can be made to change eco-
system health and ﬁre resilience within a ﬁre program to alter expected
wildﬁre loss is a focal point of analysis within this paper.
We begin with a history of wildﬁre economics in the United States
and the management policies that coincided with the understanding of
wildﬁre economics during that time to lay the foundations of where
wildﬁre economics has progressed to today. Then, an outline of the
Uniﬁed Economic Model of Fire Program Analysis (Rideout et al.,
2008), which summarizes a current understanding of wildﬁre eco-
nomics, is presented. We adapt Rideout et al.'s (2008) formulation of
the objective function within the Uniﬁed Economic Model of Fire Pro-
gram Analysis for further analysis by introducing a decision input
variable that represents ecosystem health and ﬁre resilience into. With
this expansion, the framework can be used to analyze optimizing a ﬁre
program model when the ecosystem's health and ﬁre resilience is both
within and outside a range of variability. Discussion of the management
implications stemming from the results concludes the analysis.

1.1. History of Wildﬁre Economics
The eﬀects of the 1910 ﬁre season within the Northern Rocky
Mountains have had lasting management and policy implications for
the United States (Pyne, 1997). Prescribed burning and the use of ﬁre as
a management tool was one such issue. Naturalists of the time argued
for ﬁre's place in the ecosystem based on what they observed as the ﬁre
ecology of their location. A group of Californian loggers was particu-
larly adamant in using low intensity ﬁre as a management tool and
brought it up for public debate in August of 1910. However, their
timing coincided with one of the largest ﬁre seasons in U.S. history and
faced strong opposition from the Forest Service. The idea of using low
intensity ﬁre as a management tool failed to gain public support and
was not considered by the Forest Service until the mid-1940.
The aftermath of the 1910 ﬁre season fell on the recently created
Forest Service and its chief, Giﬀord Pinchot. The U.S. Forest Service and
the general public had little incentive to tolerate any ﬁre on the land-
scape following these events. The notion of using prescribed ﬁre as a
management tool was squelched and ﬁre suppression was the man-
agement objective. The ﬁrst three chiefs of the U.S. Forest Service were
all involved with the 1910 ﬁre season and the policy of zero tolerance
for ﬁre or prescribed burns on the landscape did not change until Lyle
Watts was appointed chief in 1943. With a strict regime of ﬁre sup-
pression being implemented, a natural social question to arise was,
“How much ﬁre suppression is optimal?”
In 1916 the ﬁrst publications addressing the economics of ﬁre
suppression were put forth by Parish Lovejoy (1916) and Roy Headley
(1916). Given a policy of ﬁre suppression implemented by the Forest
Service following the 1910 ﬁre season, Lovejoy (1916) and Headley
(1916) laid the ﬁrst academic foundation for the least cost-plus damage
method of determining expenditures for wildﬁre suppression (Pyne,
1997). In Lovejoy's (1916) and Headley's (1916) analysis, the damages
associated with ﬁre were assessed in terms of timber loss, watershed
damage, and the loss of human infrastructure. Following this initial
analysis of the economics of wildﬁre suppression, the least cost-plus
damage method was expanded and graphically illustrated by Sparhawk
(1925). Sparhawk's (1925) model included the independent variable
protection costs (“presuppression”) that determined the suppression
costs and damages (“total liability”). Total liability was assumed to be
inversely related to presuppression expenditures with the objective
function seeking to minimize the sum of total liability and pre-
suppression costs. This framework guided the rationale for ﬁre sup-
pression policies across much of the United States. While the goal of
early works sought to minimize the costs associated with ﬁre suppres-
sion plus the damages incurred by the ﬁre, management of wildﬁre
gave little to no consideration of total liability damages. It was argued
by forest managers that suppression costs were being kept to a
minimum by quickly and eﬃciently containing wildﬁres once they
were spotted. Little regard to the potential loss of assets (timber, wa-
tersheds or human infrastructure) was considered in determining which
wildﬁres to suppress under the zero tolerance policies.
The inclusion of positive beneﬁts associated with wildﬁre occur-
rence has more recently been incorporated into the least cost (LC) plus
damage or loss (L) model to produce an objective function minimizing
the cost of ﬁre suppression (C) plus net value change (NVC) to the
landscape (C + NVC). Rather than viewing wildﬁre as a destructive
event producing only losses, NVC incorporates beneﬁts wildﬁre pro-
vides society (e.g. fuel load reductions). Donovan and Rideout (2003)
analyzed Sparhawk's least cost-plus loss model (LC + L) and argued the
model contains two errors in its formulation. First, suppression ex-
penditure is being incorrectly modeled as a model output rather than a
decision variation or an input. Second, presuppression and suppression
eﬀorts are modeled as substitutes (i.e. increase in one implies decrease
in the other). They argued that both suppression and presuppression
expenditures should be modeled as independent inputs to optimize the
net value change, which is the output. Their analysis expands on the
earlier results of Rideout and Omi (1990) which demonstrated that
suppression and presuppression eﬀorts/expenditures are not necessarily
negatively correlated (Donovan and Rideout, 2003).
Our analysis of the economics of a ﬁre management program builds
on the theory established in C + NVC framework. The uniﬁed economic
model of ﬁre program analysis presented by Rideout et al. (2008) is the
base theoretical model that input variables are expanded on. The de-
cision variable input of “fuels” (a proxy for fuels treatments or pre-
suppression activities) used in the probabilistic production function in
Rideout et al. (2008) is expanded on to incorporate the use of fuels
treatments or restoration to change the state of the ecosystem and its
ﬁre resilience. It is then the state of the ecosystem after the fuels
treatments or restoration which becomes a decision variable in the
probabilistic production function rather than fuels treatments itself.
Relating the state of the ecosystem to the Southwest ponderosa pine
ecosystem and using the pre-European state of the ecosystem as a
benchmark for ecosystem health and ﬁre resilience, analysis of the
probabilistic production function when the ecosystem is either within
or outside of its historical range of variability is conducted. In-
corporating the state of the ecosystem into the probabilistic production
function allows for the analysis of the marginal productivity of fuels
treatments or restoration. This distinction demonstrates why marginal
analysis fails to produce an optimal solution when the ecosystem is
outside its historical range of variability.
2. The Uniﬁed Economic Model of Fire Program Analysis
Rideout and Omi (1990) oﬀered a more in-depth analysis of the
C + NVC model by allowing decision inputs (suppression and pre-
suppression) to interact as complements or substitutes with each other.
Building on the analysis of the C + NVC model, Rideout et al. (2008)
formulated a uniﬁed economic model of ﬁre program analysis. Two key
elements of a ﬁre program are built in this model. First is the insepar-
ability of the cost components that comprise the ﬁre program. This
point is highlighted in the cost function with the inclusion of a joint cost
component. Many components of a ﬁre program, both suppression and
presuppression activities, share costs. Thus, analysis of the ﬁre program
cannot take place by analyzing the sum of the parts. Second is setting up
the loss function with two key decision inputs, “suppression” and
“presuppression”. The loss function allows for the marginal analysis of
decision inputs and the corresponding eﬀects marginal changes have on
the other decision input when optimizing the objective function. The
most general structure of this model is presented in Eq. (1) (Rideout
et al., 2008).

straint.
To further analyze the beneﬁts wildﬁre provides within the frame-
work of Rideout et al.'s (2008) probabilistic production function, the
use of an input variable to represent the ecosystem's health and ﬁre
resilience (H) is introduced. The use of this input in the probabilistic
production function furthers the ability to assess the beneﬁcial and
negative impacts of ﬁre on the landscape in terms of changes to the
overall loss function. In addition, it allows us to analyze the most ef-
ﬁcient allocations of restoration or fuels treatment investment given the

state of the ecosystem. Fire impacts an ecosystem in diﬀerent ways
depending on the state of that ecosystem. Investment in ecosystem
management to change potential ﬁre behavior is eﬀective depending on
the current state of the ecosystem's health and ﬁre resilience. By in-
troducing the input variable H, the state of the ecosystem's health and
ﬁre resilience impacts (beneﬁcial or harmful) the eﬀects of ﬁre mea-
sured by the NVC calculation. The use of H allows us to analyze mar-
ginal productivity of each input and optimal allocation among decision
variables under a given output.
In Eq. (1), F denotes the fuels decision variable. We separate it into
two components (E and H) in this analysis. E represents a presuppres-
sion decision variable that includes expenditures on administrative and
resource allocation placement, along with ﬁre season and weather
predictions and modeling. E does not include restoration or fuels
treatment decisions aﬀecting H. Expenditures on fuels treatments or
restoration are captured in the decision input variable H which have a
direct impact on the state of the ecosystem's health and ﬁre resilience.
The state of ecosystem's health and ﬁre resilience changes depending on
natural occurrences, restoration or fuels treatment, and other human
impacts. The treatment costs depend on the desired level of health and
ﬁre resilience to be achieved. For example, a full restoration treatment
aiming to recover a reference condition is usually much more expensive
than a fuels treatment aiming solely to reduce fuel loads. Eq. (2) in-
cludes the substitution of the decision input variables E and H for F.

Following Rideout et al. (2008), we assume risk neutrality for ﬁre

stant price of ﬁre risk, for Ʌ, to arrive at the following equation:

Risk adverse behavior is more common in a ﬁre management pro-
gram (e.g. rules and regulations limiting fuel treatment activities in the
wildland urban interface and urban centers). However, the risk neu-
trality assumption allows for a constant price of ﬁre risk and a focus on
the decision input variables. Expanding the cost function of the ﬁre
program to show separable and joint costs of the input components
yields:

The separation of the cost function into the individual and joint
components helps demonstrate the connectedness of the individual parts
within a ﬁre program. Certain investments in resources and infrastructure
that are shared among the components are included in the cost function as
joint costs (JC(·)). Costs that are speciﬁc to a given component are cap-
tured by the separable cost related to that component (SCx(x)). The in-
clusion of the joint costs in this model underscores the relationships be-
tween ﬁre program components and the need to examine the ﬁre program
as a whole rather than the sum of its individual parts. However, the in-
troduction of the H variable and its separate cost component make it an
explicit factor changing the state of ecosystem's ﬁre resilience which re-
quires additional and separate investment.
Substituting Eq. (4) into Eq. (3) gives the following expanded eco-
nomic model of ﬁre program analysis equation with the properties of
the probabilistic production function, the assumption of risk neutrality
(e.g. the corresponding constant price of ﬁre risk (L)), and the separable
and joint aspects of the cost function:

The inclusion of H adds complexity to the probabilistic production
function. Fulé et al. (2001) used ﬁre models to show how eﬀective
diﬀerent treatment intensities were at changing crowning indices
within a Southwest ponderosa pine forest. Their results indicate that the
more intensive the treatment (e.g. the more trees removed) the higher
the wind the speed needed to make an active crown ﬁre possible. For
certain states of the ecosystem, increased investment to improve H re-
sults in the decrease of expected losses with decreasing returns to scale.
However, for other states of the ecosystem (speciﬁcally, those beyond
the historic range of variability), increased investment in H results in
the decrease in expected losses with increasing returns to scale. De-
termining the current state of the ecosystem's ﬁre resilience compared
to its historical range of variability is a key component of determining
the optimal investment in altering the state of H via restoration or fuel
treatments. The following sections describe the input variable H and
how to determine the optimal level of investment for improving H.
3. Describing the H Input Variable
The Southwest ponderosa pine forest is used as an example of how H
describes the health and ﬁre resilience of an ecosystem. Many factors go
into determining the health and ﬁre resilience of an ecosystem. A
simpliﬁed, abstract model is presented to account for the factors af-
fecting an ecosystem's health and ﬁre resilience. From this model, the
eﬀects humans can have on the health and ﬁre resilience of an eco-
system through restoration or fuels treatments are highlighted. We
propose separating factors that aﬀect the ecosystem into two vectors for
analysis. One vector contains factors society has direct impacts on
through management actions (d), such as fuels treatments and re-
storation. The other vector contains factors society has no direct impact
on (i), such as years since the previous wildﬁre (Fitzgerald, 2005),
current and past weather conditions, current and past disease and
beetle outbreaks, and measures of species diversity and richness. Eq. (6)
demonstrates the function of ecosystem health and ﬁre resilience (H).
Restoration treatments implemented in Southwest ponderosa pine for-
ests seek to restore ecosystems within their historical range of varia-
bility of pre-European settlement conditions (Fulé et al., 1997; Moore
et al., 1999, and Bailey and Covington, 2002). In contrast, fuels treat-
ments aim to alter short-term potential ﬁre behavior with no regard for
achieving a historical forest structure. Both are included as factors in
the vector of direct impacts society has on inﬂuencing H. Because of the
dynamic progression of an ecosystem, a fuels or restoration treatment's
beneﬁts are eﬀective for a limited time. While the longevity and ef-
fectiveness of the treatment varies over time with respect to a variety of
factors (e.g. size, intensity, climate) the eﬀectiveness of a restoration or
fuels treatment can range signiﬁcantly between 4 and 15 years for
western pine forests (Pollet and Omi, 2002; Agee and Skinner, 2005,
and Saﬀord et al., 2012). Incorporating this temporal aspect of re-
storation or fuels treatments is noted in the vector of direct impacts in
Eq. (6). A temporal aspect for weather and disease outbreaks within the
no direct impact vector (i) is also incorporated. While both vectors play
a role in determining the overall health and ﬁre resilience of an eco-
system, the focus of analysis is on the ecological state inﬂuenced by the
direct human impact vector d. In this setting, d only includes treatments
and their temporal attributes. To incorporate the dynamic nature of an
ecosystem, if R0 is a treatment implemented in today and R10 is a
treatment implemented in a time period 10 years ago, both are

incorporated in the d vector. Given the treatments were of equal impact
on H at time 0, because of temporal dynamics, R0 has a greater marginal
impact on H than the R10 treatment. Within Eq. (6), the estimated
coeﬃcient for R0 would be greater than the estimated coeﬃcient for
R10 all else equal.

where:
H = state of ecosystem health and ﬁre resilience
d = vector of direct impacts humans can implement to inﬂuence
ecological state of forest
i = vector of indirect impacts humans have no or an indirect impact
on inﬂuencing the ecological state of forest.
It would be diﬃcult to measure H in terms of all d and i relation-
ships and interactions. A surrogate variable is therefore implemented to
represent health and ﬁre resilience. Similar structures have been used in
assessing ecosystem resilience (Walker et al., 2010; Wu and Kim, 2013).
However, rather than focusing on irreversible change of an ecosystem
due to loss of resilience, we examine the Southwest ponderosa pine
ecosystem in terms of exhibiting a continuous change in ecosystem
health and ﬁre resilience based on a surrogate variable rather than Eq.
(6). In the case of the Southwest ponderosa pine ecosystem, trees per
acre has been used as a viable metric for assessing ecosystem health in
relation to its historical range of variability (Fulé et al., 1997 and Wu
and Kim, 2013). While other factors (e.g. the spatial distribution of
trees over the landscape) are important for determining a historical
benchmark for restoration treatments to try and replicate, the general
metric of trees per acre is used in this analysis. Figs. 1 and 2 are con-
ceptual functions of trees per acre predicting ecosystem health. The
relationship between the surrogate variable and ecosystem health and
ﬁre resilience could take many diﬀerent forms. However, Figs. 1 and 2
highlight two key limits and a point of interest within the function.
3.1. Maximum and Minimum Levels of H
Fig. 1 highlights a maximum level of H (denoted as Hmax) that can
be attained by a Southwest ponderosa pine ecosystem. Hmin represents a
minimum level of ecosystem health and ﬁre resilience that is ap-
proached as the ecosystem suﬀers from degradation. As the ecosystem
approaches Hmin, the ecosystem is more prone to transition to an al-
ternative ecosystem stable state (ecosystem type). However, some
shock to the ecosystem would be needed to initiate this transition. As a
Southwest ponderosa pine ecosystem increases in trees per acre, it loses
its ability to recover from shocks (e.g. ﬁre) leading to the possibility of
an ecosystem regime change. A minimum number of trees per acre is
required for the landscape to be considered a ponderosa pine eco-
system; therefore, the function does not start at 0 trees per acre. If the
ecosystem was to fall below that threshold number of trees per acre, it is
no longer functioning as a ponderosa pine ecosystem. With the inclu-
sion of H in the probabilistic production function (5), a focus for opti-
mization is determining if the landscape is within or outside its his-
torical range of variability with respect to the short-term measure for
ecosystem health and ﬁre resilience. If the landscape is within this
historical range of variability, then ﬁre behavior characteristics are
more likely to be within their historical norm of low severity surface
ﬁres. If the landscape is outside its historical range of variability, then
extreme ﬁre behavior characteristics are more likely to result with
higher proportions of mixed and high burn severity. Fig. 2 demonstrates
a number of trees per acre that acts as an upper bound for a historical
range of variability for a given landscape.
3.2. The Inﬂection Point on the H Function
In Fig. 2, the point (Tu, H*) represents an inﬂection point where H is
strictly concave (∂
∂
H
T
2
2 < 0) for the range of T < Tu. For T > Tu the H
function is strictly convex (
>
∂
∂
0
H
T

2
) with respect to trees per acre. While
Tu changes between diﬀerent stands or landscapes within the Southwest
ponderosa pine ecosystem, the H function always has the property of an
inﬂection point evaluated at (Tu, H*). The upper range of variability,
measured in terms of trees per acre, for the Southwest ponderosa pine
ecosystem acts as a threshold for determining where the H function
stops decreasing at a decreasing rate and starts decreasing at an in-
creasing rate. Depending on how far the current state of the ecosystem
is from its historical range of variability, increases in H aﬀect the
probabilistic production (P(E,S,H)) in Eq. (3) at diﬀerent rates. For
values of T below or at the inﬂection point Tu, the state of the ecosystem
in a Southwest ponderosa pine landscape is in a state where ﬁre be-
havior exhibits its historical, low intensity surface ﬁres behavior. Since
the ecosystem is in a state better suited for ﬁre disturbance, additional
investment in fuels or restoration treatments have decreasing marginal
impacts on improving H. For T ≤Tu and H ≥H*, the H function ex-
hibits diminishing returns to scale in the probabilistic production
function since the ecosystem can withstand, and even prosper, from ﬁre
disturbances.
On the other hand, when T > Tu, ﬁre behavior demonstrates
characteristics that are outside its historical range of variability with
greater proportions of landscape burning at higher severities. In this
state, the ecosystem has a reduced resilience to potential wildﬁres

outside the historical range of variability causing an increase in loss.
The corresponding ﬁre behavior characteristics continue to return to
their historical norm of variability until they ﬁnally do so when the
surrogate measure of trees per acre is within its historical range of
variability. Investment in fuels or restoration treatments have larger
impacts on the ecosystem's health and ﬁre resilience over some ranges
but minimal change in H over others. When the ecosystem is within the
historical range of variability of trees per acre, H ranges from H* to
Hmax. When the ecosystem is outside its historical range of variability of
trees per acre, H ranges from the Hmin limit to H*.
The implications of H's eﬀect on the expanded probabilistic pro-
duction function are shown with the ﬁrst and second order conditions
in Eqs. (7.1) and (7.2). For values of H within its historical range of
variability, decreasing returns to scale are implemented for ecosystem's
health and resilience on the loss function. For values of H outside its
historical range of variability, the loss function decreases with fuels or
restoration treatments but at an increasing return to scale. Increasing
returns to scale are used with ecosystems outside their historical range
of variability based on results from Johnson et al. (2011) and Fulé et al.
(2001). In their analysis, Johnson et al. (2011) show proportions of the
landscape burning as surface ﬁres increasing with more intensive re-
ductions in trees per acre in forest types of western North America
(Central Rockies Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) variant). However,
the rates of change in proportion of the landscape burning as surface
ﬁres change between treatment intensities. Fulé et al. (2001) demon-
strate diﬀerent changes in crowning indices based on three restorations
at diﬀerent intensities. From these results, we implement the following

Because increases in all decision variable inputs (S, E, and H) are
expected to reduce expected loss and L is assumed constant from risk
neutrality, PS, PE, and PH must be negative. In addition, with all costs
being positive and increasing as investment in the decision variable
inputs increases, λ must be negative. This result reﬂects the marginal
value of an increase in the budget, with the assumption that all in-
creases in the budget are allocated to program components. Marginal
changes in the budget then have the overall result of reducing the ﬁre
program loss by λ (∂Z/∂B = λ).
4.1. Impacts of H on the Probabilistic Production Function
Increases in the decision variable of ecosystem health and resilience
(H) result in decreases of expected loss at diﬀerent rates depending on
the condition of the ecosystem. If the ecosystem is within its historical
range of variability, an intensive restoration expenditure would not
have the same eﬀect as implementing an intensive restoration ex-
penditure on an ecosystem that is outside its historical range of varia-
bility. Changes in wildﬁre behavior and the associated probability of
losses would be greater in the ecosystem outside its historical range of
variability. In either case, treatments would improve H but greater in-
creases in loss reduction would occur where T > Tu as T approaches
Tu. The function (L·P(H)) decreases at higher rates for values of T close
to Tu. If using a marginal analysis approach for T > Tu and T is ex-
cessively high, little marginal change in H occurs. The corresponding
expected loss from wildﬁre decreases as the ﬁre behavior characteristics
are changed from high to low severity. Because of risk neutrality and a
constant price for loss, improvements in H decrease the probabilistic
production function to represent an overall reduction in loss from
wildﬁre on the landscape. The probabilistic production function is
segmented into a non-continuous function with respect to the eco-
system health decision variable (H). T's determination of H creates a
limit on H in the probabilistic production function. More speciﬁcally, it
exhibits its limits where the ecosystem health metric is at its maximum
historical rate of variability (H*).

Eqs. (9.1)–(9.9) represent the partial second order conditions of Eq.
(5). Diminishing returns to scale are observed for suppression eﬀorts
Eq. (9.1) and resource allocation Eq. (9.2) over all ranges of decision
variable inputs S and E (ZSS and ZEE are positive). For H < H* in-
creasing returns to scale occurs when the ecosystem exceeds its his-
torical range of variability in terms of trees per acre (T > Tu) for Eq.
(9.3) (ZHH is negative) (Johnson et al., 2011). At trees per acre levels
highly divergent from their historical range of variability, marginal
changes in trees per acre for simulated ﬁres appears to have minimal
impacts on changing wildﬁre behavior (Johnson et al., 2011). However,
as trees per acre approaches its historical range of variability, more
dramatic changes occur in ﬁre behavior.

function. The loss function is decreasing as the ecosystem's health

increases (holding all other decision inputs constant) and doing so with
diminishing returns to scale.
4.3. H < H*
Fig. 3 further illustrates Eq. (7.2)'s implications on Eqs. (8.3) and
(9.3) for the concavity of the loss function with respect to H over the
range H < H*. For H < H* the ﬁrst order Eqs. (8.1)–(8.4) for the
marginal beneﬁt-cost conditions on the decision input variables and the
budget continue to hold. However, the objective function (Eq. (5)) is a
minimization problem and the ﬁrst order condition of Eq. (8.3) would
be expressing a maximum given the function is concave following the
structure of Eq. (7.2) over the range of H < H* (Eq. (9.3) is negative
for H < H*). While the equi-marginal principle could produce a solu-
tion to the objective function, its practical implications would contra-
dict wildﬁre loss minimization. The equi-marginal principle would hold
for Eqs. (8.1) and (8.2) for of H < H*. However, Eq. (8.3) over the
range of H < H* is strictly concave causing the equi-marginal principle
to solve a maximization problem for H while solving a minimization
problem for S and E.
5. Discussion
With ecosystem health and ﬁre resilience as a decision variable input
of ﬁre program optimization, two ecosystem states exhibiting diﬀerent
returns to scale with respect to (H) are analyzed. The Southwest ponderosa
pine ecosystem is used to illustrate the eﬀects of fuels or restoration
treatments on the expected loss function from wildﬁre. In this setting, H is
aﬀected by human capital investment in ecosystem health and ﬁre resi-
lience (reduction of trees per acre to increase H).
In the case where the ecosystem state is within its historical range of
variability (H ≥H*), measured in terms of trees per acre (T ≤Tu), di-
minishing returns to scale in the probabilistic production function, with
respect to H, follow from Rideout et al. (2008). In this instance, the
results diﬀer little from Rideout et al.'s (2008) results in that an optimal
solution for each decision input variable can be found. The arguments
regarding complementary eﬀects or synergism between decision vari-
able inputs hold and the minimization of the objective function (Z) has
a solution for a given budget (B) with a constant rate of loss from ﬁre L.
The three decision inputs can be optimized using equi-marginal analysis
where ratios in the reduction of ﬁre probabilities equal the ratios of
their marginal costs.
When the state of the ecosystem's health is outside its historical
range of variability (H < H*), increasing returns to scale in the ob-
jective function with respect to H are implemented. As H approaches
H*, changes in wildﬁre behavior are shown to shift from larger pro-
portions of the landscape burning at high and mixed severities to sur-
face ﬁres or low severity wildﬁre (Johnson et al., 2011). Since loss is
constant in this analysis, the reduction in loss is associated with the
lowering of the probability of experiencing such loss through the
probabilistic production function. The low intensity surface ﬁre reﬂects
the historical ﬁre regime of the Southwest ponderosa pine ecosystem.
The inﬂection point of H*, represented by Tu in its ecological metric, is
the function's limit for H < H* and the objective function continues to
decrease and approach H* (H* is the limit the function is approaching).
Although the equi-marginal principle doesn't produce a rational solu-
tion in the range of H < H*, there still exists applications for the
marginal analysis of the loss function. When the absolute value of the
ﬁrst order condition of the loss function with respect to H is > 1 there is
increasing incentive for investment in H. Holding all other input deci-
sion variables constant, the loss function continues to approach its limit
as H approaches H*. This corresponds to large reductions in the ex-
pected loss from marginal changes in H as H approaches H*. Two ad-
ditional aspects of the marginal loss function with respect to ecosystem
health are worth further examination when the ecosystem is outside its
historical range of variability in terms of health and sustainability:
1) At what point is the ﬁrst order condition of the expected loss
|PH| ≥1 for H < H*?
2) How is the corresponding H for the ﬁrst order condition of the ex-
pected loss
|PH| ≥1 represented in the physical world?
Matching the metric for ecosystem health and ﬁre resilience to the
corresponding partial derivative of the objective function is critical for
establishing thresholds that must be met before economic optimization
of the ﬁre program can occur. In this study, we hypothesized the upper
range of variability for pre-European trees per acre in Southwest pon-
derosa pine to be synonymous with the inﬂiction point (H*) for the
partial derivative of objective function (Eq. (5)) with respect to H.
However, relaxing H* as a threshold, the point where |PH| = 1 (for
H < H*) becomes an important ecosystem state for optimization of the
objective function. From a marginal analysis perspective, |PH| ≥1
supports additional investment in ecosystem health and ﬁre resilience
as a unit investment in H brings about a greater than one unit decrease
in expected loss. Determining the associated ecosystem health and ﬁre
resilience metric that corresponds to |PH| = 1 for H < H* or H* is
needed for ﬁre program optimization. However, for |PH| < 1 and
H < H*, marginal invest in H is not supported as the objective function
would be optimizing PH at a maximum rather than a minimum. Col-
laboration between forest ecologists and social scientists is needed to
determine threshold metrics of H that need to be achieved before op-
timization of the objective function can occur.
From a management perspective, the results of using the ecosystem's
health and ﬁre resilience as a decision variable have several implica-
tions. If H is within its historical range of variability (H ≥H*) then the
equi-marginal analysis for the optimization of the objective function
(Eq. (5)) is an appropriate tool for optimizing the decision input vari-
ables for a given budget constraint in a ﬁre optimization program.
Relating this range of H to trees per acre, the range of trees per acre in
the Southwest ponderosa pine ecosystem would be T ≤Tu. When H is
outside its historical range of variability, land managers should focus on
getting the landscape back to within its historical range of variability or
to the corresponding point where |PH| = 1 for H < H* before con-
sidering marginal analysis with respect to ﬁre program optimization. In
this instance, the probabilistic loss function is exhibiting increasing
returns to scale from investment in restoration or fuels treatments. As T
decreases from restoration or fuels treatments and approaches Tu, ﬁre

regimes change and start approaching the low intensity surface ﬁres
associated with the Southwest ponderosa pine ecosystem being within
its historical range of variability. If the ecosystem is outside its histor-
ical range of variability, the objective function of the ﬁre program
cannot be optimized. Thus, marginal analysis does not support invest-
ment in the ecosystem state. In the instance where H is outside its
historical range of variability, land managers should focus on returning
the landscape to within its historical range of variability before un-
dertaking any form of optimization with respect to a ﬁre program.
6. Conclusions
Largescale restoration project goals of Southwest ponderosa pine
reﬂect economic optimization of reducing trees per acre to pre-
European forest structure to increase ecosystem health and ﬁre resi-
lience (Brown et al., 2004, Noss et al., 2006, and United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA), 2013). Our results highlight the
situations where large restoration projects need to be taken before
marginal analysis can be used for optimization of wildﬁre programs.
Economics has a strong foundation in marginal analysis to determine
optimal outcomes. However, if an ecosystem well outside its range of
variability, marginal analysis may fail at producing an optimal out-
come. Under these circumstances, more emphasis and expenditure will
be placed on wildﬁre suppression rather than increasing ecosystem
health and ﬁre resilience. Current budget patterns seem to be showing
support of this occurrence but are large, non-marginal investments in
restoring ecosystem health the reason?
This analysis is based on the assumptions of constant loss. These
assumptions were used to focus on the marginal impacts of the decision
variable inputs with the probabilistic production function portion of the
objective function. However, these assumptions rarely hold in real
world situations. The 2017 wildﬁre season in California exempliﬁed
how loss from wildﬁre is not constant and that homogeneous land-
scapes where wildﬁres burn do not exist. Human infrastructure, parti-
cularly expansion of the wildland urban interface (WUI) into ﬁre prone
ecosystems, and ecosystem goods and services vary across the land-
scape. Bostwick et al. (2011) and Loomis (2018) examine the connec-
tions between wildﬁre suppression expenditures and human infra-
structure damaged by wildﬁre. In addition, Fitch et al. (2018) examined
how changing wind conditions and location of the wildﬁre aﬀects ﬁre
behavior and wildﬁre suppression costs. Functions to estimate the loss
from wildﬁre are addressed using a variety of variables; however, es-
timating loss from wildﬁre is an area for further analysis.
Risk neutrality on behalf of the program managers was also used to
achieve a constant loss function. Given the potential for losses from
restoration, fuel treatments, or extreme wildﬁre conditions, program
managers tend to exhibit more risk adverse behavior. For instance,
prescribed burns are not permitted in WUI areas because of the risk of
the ﬁre damaging human infrastructure. Preservation of human life will
also cause management decisions to be made under risk adverse rather
than risk taking behavior. Further studies into risk management within
wildﬁre programs would be a signiﬁcant contribution to wildﬁre eco-
nomics.
Further areas of collaboration between natural and social scientists
in ﬁre program optimization could examine the physical states of the
ecosystem to their corresponding relevance in determining threshold
states for management. How physical states of ecosystems relate to
metrics of ecosystem health and ﬁre resilience, as a decision input
variable for ﬁre program optimization, would be beneﬁcial to land
managers. These metrics and tools would give land managers the ability
to determine threshold states to transition the landscape toward ﬁre
program optimization.
