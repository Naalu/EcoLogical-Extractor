ABSTRACT
Forest management can have substantial impacts on ecosystem
carbon storage, but those eﬀects can vary signiﬁcantly with manage-
ment type and species composition. We used systematic review
methodology to identify and synthesize eﬀects of thinning and/or
burning, timber harvesting, clear-cut, and wildﬁre on four compo-
nents of ecosystem carbon: aboveground vegetation, soil, litter, and
deadwood. We performed a meta-analysis on studies from the United
States and Canada because those represented 85% of the studies
conducted worldwide. We found that the most important variables in
predicting eﬀect sizes (ratio of carbon stored in treated stands versus
controls) were, in decreasing order of importance, ecosystem carbon
component, time since treatment, and age of control. Management
treatment was the least important of all the variables we examined,
but the trends we found suggest that thinning and/or burning treat-
ments resulted in less carbon loss than wildﬁre or clear-cut. This
ﬁnding is consistent with recent modeling studies indicating that
forest management is unimportant to long-term carbon dynamics
relative to the eﬀects of large-scale natural disturbances (e.g.,
drought, ﬁre, pest outbreak). However, many data gaps still exist on
total ecosystem carbon, particularly in regions other than North
America, and in timber production forests and plantations.

Introduction
Concern about global climate change has focused attention on carbon storage in forests as
an important ecosystem service (Schröter et al., 2005). Forest carbon dynamics are a key
component of global carbon budgets, representing a carbon sink equivalent in magnitude
to the entire terrestrial sink (Pan et al., 2011). Conservation of forests has become a
primary concern, especially the deforestation of tropical forests which is the greatest
carbon source compared to releases in mid- and high-latitude forests (Dixon et al.,
1994). Temperate and boreal forests continue to be carbon sinks, but are vulnerable to a
variety of natural and anthropogenic disturbances such as harvesting and wildﬁre, the
eﬀects of which may be exacerbated by climate change (Carroll, Milakovsky, Finkral,
Evans, & Ashton, 2012; Keith, Mackey, & Lindenmayer, 2009). Additional concern is

warranted given that undisturbed old-growth forest stands, once thought to be carbon
neutral, can continue to sequester carbon for up to 800 yr (Luyssaert et al., 2008). Most of
the focus of forest carbon storage has been on live and dead biomass, which comprises
roughly 60% of global forest carbon; however, litter and soil make up the remaining 40%
(McKinley et al., 2011), and thus are critical components of forest carbon dynamics.
A range of strategies has been suggested for using forests to mitigate climate change—
including increasing forested area; the use of wood as biomass for energy or as building
products; and via management of existing forests (McKinley et al., 2011). Forest manage-
ment can have substantial impacts on ecosystem carbon storage (Leighty, Hamburg, &
Caouette, 2006), but those eﬀects can vary signiﬁcantly with management type and species
composition (Nave, Vance, Swanston, & Curtis, 2010; Pan et al., 2011). Although ecolo-
gical restoration eﬀorts in forests (e.g., mechanical thinning and/or prescribed ﬁre) are
likely to decrease ﬁre risk and improve ecosystem function (Covington & Moore, 1994;
Fulé, Crouse, Roccaforte, & Kalies, 2012), they may reduce carbon stores. In the western
United States, an unintended consequence of ﬁre suppression has been the increased
storage of carbon in conifer stands, while restoration treatments reduce standing carbon
stocks in the short term (Finkral & Evans, 2008). These reductions and increases of stored
carbon must be weighed against the risk associated with not restoring forests, such as
stand-replacing ﬁres that can release large quantities of carbon to the atmosphere (Dore
et al., 2010).
The eﬀects of management on carbon storage in forests will depend on multiple factors
including geographic region (Boerner, Huang, & Hart, 2008), forest composition and
structure (Keith et al., 2009), soil horizon (Nave et al., 2010), and the amount of time
elapsed since treatment occurred. For example, forests that tend to store more carbon
include cooler, more mesic forests with fast growth rates but slow decomposition, parti-
cularly older, undisturbed forests with high structural complexity (Keith et al., 2009).
Boerner et al. (2008) found that eastern U.S. deciduous and coniferous forests were
converted from carbon sinks to sources in most fuel reduction treatments in the short
term, whereas in western forests treatments had little eﬀect on overall carbon budgets.
Finally, most management treatments are likely to reduce total carbon storage in the short
term but potentially increase it in the long term (McKinley et al., 2011). These sources of
variation are therefore critical to include in any examination of management eﬀects on
forest ecosystem carbon.
The existing syntheses of forest management and ecosystem carbon have limitations that
we attempted to circumvent in the present study. For example, several analyses have focused
on single pools (e.g., soil carbon; Johnson & Curtis, 2001; Nave et al., 2010). Although such
studies are useful, they do not provide an understanding of how the magnitude of response
in a single pool compared to other ecosystem pools, and how these pools change over time
relative to one another; for example, removing deadwood from a site results in reduced soil
carbon over time (Fekete et al., 2014). The analysis of Boerner et al. (2008) examined all
components of ecosystem carbon, but their study was limited to fuel reduction treatments
that were implemented over short time periods, and found that treatments were similar in
their carbon impacts. Similarly, Restaino and Peterson (2013) found it diﬃcult to draw
conclusions on the eﬀects of fuel reduction treatments on carbon storage at the geographic
scale of the western United States because empirical data were lacking. In the present study,
we conducted a thorough, global literature search on total forest ecosystem carbon gains or

losses in response to management treatments including fuel reduction (prescribed ﬁre and
thinning along with the combination), harvesting, and clear-cutting. We also included
wildﬁre as an inadvertent treatment (or lack of management activities) to better contextua-
lize carbon gains or losses with other management treatments. Our objective was to
compare the amount of carbon stored in multiple ecosystem carbon pools in managed
versus unmanaged forests, to more fully understand the carbon costs and beneﬁts of a wide
variety of forest management strategies.
Methods
Data collection
We used a systematic review protocol to identify and extract data to be used in a meta-analysis
(Pullin & Stewart, 2006). We searched the online databases ISI Web of Science, Google
Scholar, and Science Direct, based on the recommendations in Brown (2007) for top ecology
databases. We included papers available through November 2015. Keywords included “forest”
and “carbon,” together with each of the following: “thin,” “burn,” “ﬁre,” “harvest,” “clear-cut,”
and “plantation.” We used the following criteria in identifying relevant papers:
(1) Subject: all terrestrial forests, globally
(2) Treatments:
(a) Thinning and/or burning (fuel reduction treatments):
(i) small-to-intermediate diameter trees were removed (thin),
(ii) low-to-moderate severity prescribed burn was applied (burn),
(iii) or both (thin + burn);
(b) Wildﬁre: high severity burns or stand-replacing wildﬁre where almost all the
understory is killed, and some to all large trees are killed;
(c) Harvest: where trees, typically of large-diameter, were selectively removed;
(d) Clear-cut: represents the most intensive harvest treatments, where > 80% of the
basal area was removed; and
(e) Plantation: forest stands that are artiﬁcially regenerated, often with uniform tree
spacing.
(3) Comparators: untreated forest stands as controls
(4) Response variables include the following carbon pools:
(a) Soil,
(b) Roots,
(c) Litter,
(d) Overstory/understory (vegetation), and
(e) Deadwood.
We only included studies that measured total ecosystem carbon in at least four pools
(soil, litter, vegetation, and deadwood) in order to reduce variation between studies and
ensure that we could capture trade-oﬀs between pools in our analysis; this criterion
eliminated many studies. Thus, we decided not to limit our sample size further by
requiring additional relevant pools—e.g., fuel emissions from forestry equipment or

smoke emissions from wildﬁre. We excluded all studies examining aﬀorestation, refor-
estation, fertilization, or irrigation, and only included empirical (not modeled) data. With
the ﬁnal set of studies, we built a database to record the relevant information. Data were
separated by year and site whenever possible. We noted ecological characteristics that
could aﬀect the response, and included these variables as covariates: region (U.S. state or
Canadian province), forest type (mixed broadleaf, mixed conifer, hardwood-softwood,
northern pines, southern pines, oak-savanna, pinyon-juniper), treatment, age of control
(i.e., age of trees in control sites), time since treatment (i.e., number of years posttreatment
that carbon measurements were taken), and carbon pool (soil, litter, vegetation, and
deadwood). We also noted methodological covariates that we hypothesized could aﬀect
the outcome of the study, including study design (Before-After—BA or Control-Impact—
CI), replication (number of plots sampled), and reference (identifying the publication that
was the source of the data). Data were extracted into a standard format (spreadsheet). We
assessed correlations between covariates via Pearson’s correlation and chi-squared tests;
forest type and region were correlated (p = < .01), and thus we omitted region from
further analysis.
Data analysis
We used meta-analysis techniques to determine mean eﬀect sizes for carbon storage in
stands (compared to controls) under diﬀerent management practices. We used a response
ratio as our eﬀect size calculation, deﬁned as ln (treatment mean/control mean; Hedges,
Gurevitch, & Curtis, 1999). This metric has become more commonly used in meta-
analysis (Côté, Mosquera, & Reynolds, 2001; Mosquera, Côté, Jennings, & Reynolds,
2000) as it is designed to measure relative diﬀerences (often appropriate in ecological
studies) and behaves better statistically (Hedges et al., 1999). Eﬀect sizes are usually
weighted by the inverse of the sample variance, in order to account for variation between
studies in sampling eﬀort. With the studies we examined, the standard deviation between
replicate means was often not reported, or not meaningful because the size of a plot
(replicate) varied dramatically from study to study. We used a biologically meaningful
weighting scheme where each eﬀect size was weighted by the total number of plots
sampled (Mosquera et al., 2000). We compared unweighted and weighted analyses and
found they produced similar results; thus we report only unweighted results.
We built generalized linear models to examine relationships between eﬀect sizes and
covariates (a mixed model with “reference” as a random eﬀect did not converge, so we
included “reference” as a ﬁxed eﬀect). We analyzed all combinations of models, hypothe-
sizing that either ecological or methodological variables, chosen a priori, in addition to
reference, would explain eﬀect size in response to forest management treatment. We

R
(R
Development Core Team, 2015). For each model, we computed Akaike’s Information
Criterion adjusted for small sample size (AICc), diﬀerence in AICc (ΔAICc), and Akaike
weight (wi); we then used these values to assess model ﬁt (Burnham & Anderson, 2002).
We ranked relative covariate importance by summing wi across all models in which a
given covariate occurred and used cumulative weights to rank relative covariate impor-
tance across all models. Larger values of wi are indicative of greater importance for
covariate i relative to other variables in the model (Burnham & Anderson, 2002). We

considered wi ≥.50 indicative of a strong response to the covariate and wi ≤.50 a weak
response.
We examined each of the important covariates in the models, as identiﬁed by model
selection, using Metawin v.2 software (Rosenberg, Adams, & Gurevitch, 2000). For
categorical variables with ≥2 observations, we calculated a mean eﬀect size (MES) with
conﬁdence intervals generated by bootstrapping (Adams, Gurevitch, & Rosenberg, 1997),
corrected for bias for unequal distribution around the mean. Eﬀect sizes were considered
to be diﬀerent from zero when the conﬁdence interval did not include zero. An eﬀect size
of zero, positive, or negative indicated no change between treatment and control, an
increase in the response variable compared to the control, or a decrease in the response
variable, respectively (Rosenberg et al., 2000). For continuous variables, we regressed eﬀect
size against the variable and reported the associated slope which indicates the direction
and magnitude of the relationship.
Bias and lack of independence
Publication bias in meta-analysis occurs because studies with signiﬁcant results are
more likely to be published than those without signiﬁcant results (Arnqvist & Wooster,
1995). We reduced the possibility of bias by thoroughly searching theses, government
documents, and other nonpublished studies to acquire data, although none of these
studies met all our inclusion criteria. In addition, we visually examined weighted
histograms, normal quantile plots, and funnel plots to conﬁrm data normality (and
removed outliers) and lack of publication bias. To test for publication bias, we ran a
rank correlation test (Spearman’s rho) between our eﬀect size and sample size
(Rosenberg et al., 2000); the resulting p-value (p = .083) indicated that publication
bias is not likely.
We controlled for the problem of lack of independence in data (i.e., multiple eﬀect
sizes can be calculated from the same study using the same control for multiple
treatments) by including a covariate to identify the origin of the data (reference),
which was an indicator variable to uniquely identify each study. This approach allowed
us to analyze the relative importance of “reference” and associated methodological and
site-speciﬁc sources of variation, compared to the other covariates in our model
selection approach.
Results
We found 35 studies (described in 30 references; i.e., publications) that had quantitative data
suitable for meta-analysis (S1. Results of literature review). The surprising scarcity of papers
that ﬁt our criteria is due to the fact that many ecosystem carbon papers only evaluate two or
three of the four pools we required for inclusion (often focusing only on either aboveground
or belowground). The studies were mostly from the United States and Canada (85%), with
additional studies in Korea, China, Spain, Czech Republic, and Patagonia (Figure 1).
Research on this topic was published between 1993 and 2015, with a peak in 2008. The
focus of 80% of the studies was fuel reduction treatments, while the remaining studies
focused roughly equally on harvest, clear-cut, plantation conversion, and wildﬁre (~5%
each). We chose to eliminate studies from outside of North American from the meta-analysis

because of the small sample size; this also resulted in the “plantation” treatment being
omitted, as all plantation studies were international (Figure 1). As a result, 29 studies were
used in the meta-analysis (S1. Results of literature review). With multiple subsites, treat-
ments, and carbon pools at each study location, this resulted in 800 separate observations.
The model selection analysis (S2. Model selection results) revealed that the most
important covariates in predicting eﬀect size were, in decreasing order of importance,
carbon pool type (wi = 1.0), time since treatment (wi = 1.0), reference (wi = 0.98), and age
of control (wi = 0.62). Other covariates had wi ≤0.50 and therefore a weak association
with eﬀect size—including (in decreasing order of importance) forest type (wi = 0.32),
study design (wi = 0.31), and treatment (wi = 0.15).
Carbon pool type had the strongest association with mean eﬀect size. Carbon in litter,
vegetation, and root pools decreased compared to controls, while carbon in soil and
deadwood pools had neutral responses to treatment (Figure 2).
Time since treatment and age of control stands, both continuous variables, had strong
associations with mean eﬀect sizes, but only slightly negative associations; regressions had
a slope of −0.0001 ± 0.002 and −0.001 ± 0.001, respectively. However, time since treatment
is more meaningful if interpreted by carbon pool, since each pool responded diﬀerently
over time. Carbon pools in deadwood declined with time since treatment; all other pools
slightly increased (Figure 3).
The strong association between eﬀect sizes and reference indicated a lack of indepen-
dence among observations from the same publication. We interpreted this as a site eﬀect,
as most observations from the same study also used the same study site, and thus had
similar ecological conditions and ﬁeld methodologies.
Forest management treatment, although only having a weak association with eﬀect
sizes, was the main subject of this meta-analysis; thus, we examined the relationship of
each treatment with total carbon gain/loss across all carbon pools (Figure 4). Thinning
resulted in the least carbon loss between control and treatment, followed by burn, thin +
burn, wildﬁre, clear-cut, and harvest, respectively. The harvest treatment had a large
conﬁdence interval but also the smallest sample size (N = 16).

Discussion
Our analysis identiﬁed diﬀerences among ecosystem carbon components with respect to
their responses to forest management. Across all management treatments, the largest
carbon losses occurred in the litter, roots, and vegetation, which is intuitive given that
management treatments manipulate these ecosystem components the most. Soil appears
to remain relatively unaﬀected by the diﬀerent management types, consistent with results
of existing meta-analyses on soil responses to management (Boerner, Huang, & Hart,
2009; Johnson & Curtis, 2001). In a long-term study Powers et al. (2005) found a similar
resistance of soil carbon to management-related treatments (i.e., compaction and forest

ﬂoor removal). However, they suggested that such apparent resistance could be explained
by increased soil bulk density and decomposition inputs of carbon from tree roots
following harvest. Still, others have found that intensive treatments such as clear-cutting
cause signiﬁcant declines in the organic horizon of soils, but the mineral soil response to
harvesting may be more dependent on factors like taxonomy and plant species composi-
tion (Johnson & Curtis, 2001; Nave et al., 2010).
Other studies have reported declines in coarse woody debris in intensively managed
compared to unmanaged (old-growth) forests (Gibb et al., 2005; Krankina & Harmon,
1995). Our analysis showed that the deadwood carbon pool trends toward a decline but
with large variability, likely driven by a number of causes. First, dead and downed woody
material is inherently variable, inﬂuenced by region and endemic ecosystem dynamics
(Woodall et al., 2013). Second, diﬀerences in methodologies across studies means that
sometimes snags are counted with tree biomass, or small pieces of deadwood may be
included in the litter pool. Third, deadwood and slash are treated diﬀerently across fuel
reduction prescriptions: slash can be left on site, piled and burned, scattered and burned,
or removed (Leighty et al., 2006).
Time since treatment is an important variable because although carbon stocks may
decrease in the short-term immediately following treatment, it is estimated that vegetation
stocks will increase in the longer-term due to an increase in available growing space
(Hurteau, Koch, & Hungate, 2008). However, this concept is diﬃcult to verify empirically.
Most studies model long-term carbon responses to treatment (e.g., Bradford, Jensen,
Domke, & D’Amato, 2013; Hurteau & North, 2008) or use a chronosequence approach
(e.g., Diochon, Kellman, & Beltrami, 2009; Kashian, Romme, Tinker, Turner, & Ryan,
Figure 4. Mean eﬀect size (ln treatment mean/control mean), with bootstrapped conﬁdence intervals,

all pools) in the treatment compared to controls; a negative mean eﬀect size indicates carbon loss.

2012). We attempted to use empirical data to examine this relationship, but similarly
found that most studies (80%) examined treatments < 20 yr old, which approximately
mirrors the length of time since restoration-type treatments have been implemented. The
only studies we found conducted at time scales > 20 yr were chronosequence studies of
wildﬁre and clear-cuts (Diochon et al., 2009; Gough, Vogel, Harrold, George, & Curtis,
2007; Howard, Gower, Foley, & Kucharik, 2004; Kashian et al., 2012; Rothstein,
Yermakov, & Buell, 2004). Despite these limitations, our analysis does include longer
term empirical data than previous syntheses, and indicates that all pools increase slightly
over time, except for deadwood which decreases slightly (i.e., the slope is only −0.01).
Age of control was an important variable in predicting eﬀect sizes, indicating that the
older the control stand, the greater the carbon loss (i.e., greater diﬀerence between control
and treatment). Another methodological variable was study design (control-impact vs.
before-after) which had a weak association with eﬀect sizes. Two ecological variables that
were not important in predicting eﬀect sizes were region and forest type, which is some-
what contrary to other studies that found regional eﬀects (Boerner et al., 2008; Dixon
et al., 1994). However, this may be due to the fact that all forest types in this analysis were
either conifer or mixed hardwood-softwood forests, and thus do not represent as much
variability as one would ﬁnd between temperate and tropical forests, for example.
We were particularly interested in the diﬀerence between carbon gains/losses in fuel
reduction treatments (thin, burn, thin + burn) versus wildﬁre and clear-cut. Although
only a weak trend in our analysis, fuel reduction treatments resulted in less carbon loss
than wildﬁre or clear-cut, with the impacts of harvest being unclear due to the small
sample size. Several recent modeling studies suggest that forest management (e.g., timber
harvest or fuel reduction treatments) is unimportant to long-term carbon dynamics
relative to the eﬀects of natural disturbance—such as massive tree loss due to drought,
ﬁre, or insects—and that this is a concern since such disturbances are projected to increase
in frequency in response to climate change (Bradford et al., 2013; Campbell & Ager, 2013).
The fact that we found management treatment a relatively unimportant factor for pre-
dicting carbon losses, and that wildﬁre and clear-cut resulted in greater carbon loss than
thinning and/or burning, is consistent with these modeling studies. However, the model-
ing studies occurred at landscape scales; our analysis was constrained to the scale of
included studies (stand level) and does not account for spatial extent of a treatment.
The meta-analysis approach worked well in summarizing the carbon response of
forests to diﬀerent treatments over time at a coarse scale. However, our inferences are
limited by sample size; as with many meta-analyses, a greater sample size would help us
better identify trends among regions, forest types, and other ecological factors. We
found that studies assessing all carbon pools (total ecosystem carbon) are limited
worldwide, and only just large enough in North America to warrant meta-analysis.
In addition, despite our eﬀort to include only papers that examined all carbon pools
(vegetation, deadwood, litter, soil, and roots), there was variation in the level of detail
provided by various authors. For example, deadwood sometimes included stumps, and
roots were not always included in every study (we included these data when available
but did not exclude studies that lacked them). These inconsistencies account for some
of the variability we report in our analysis, although overall the diﬀerent responses of
the various carbon pools were quite strong. Finally, there were several carbon pools
that were outside the scope of this analysis (and would have further reduced our

sample size); notably, carbon in wood products, and fossil fuels emissions from
mechanized harvesting operations and wood products production. For those few
studies that have measured fossil fuels, the pool was minor relative to the overall
treatment carbon budget (Hoover et al., 2014). However, recent simulations suggest
that the fate of wood products (e.g., biofuel versus construction material) may be a
primary determinant of net carbon emissions from forests (Eriksson et al., 2007).
One outcome of meta-analysis is that it allows us to assess the current state of
knowledge on a subject and recommend areas for future research. Clearly, studies
that are comprehensive in their examination of ecosystem carbon, including above-
ground and belowground carbon, are sparse. We attempted to analyze a global data
set, but only found enough data to be representative of the United States and
Canada. Patterns across regions and forest types can only be uncovered with more
comprehensive data. In addition, some treatments need more attention, particularly
diﬀerent types of timber harvests such as “biomass harvesting” for use as bioenergy
which is projected to increase by up to 113% by 2050 in the southeastern U.S.
(Alavalapati, Lal, Susaeta, Abt, & Wear, 2013), and conversion to plantations which
is happening at large scales in the tropics (Gibson et al., 2011). The potential for
plantations to store carbon may be extensive, but the amount sequestered will
depend on the amount in standing biomass, recalcitrant carbon in the soil, and in
wood products (Montagnini & Nair, 2004). This potential will be further aﬀected by
rotation length that determines the degree of biomass accumulation (Schroeder,
1992). Thus, despite the acute interest in this topic since the late 1990s, there are
still large data gaps in our understanding of forest management and carbon
dynamics.
