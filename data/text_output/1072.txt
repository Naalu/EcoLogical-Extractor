Mitigating Postfire Runoff and Erosion in the Southwestern US 
By Henry Grover 
Introduction 
Wildfires in the southwestern US are larger, more frequent, and more severe due to climate change and dense 
forest conditions. Catastrophic wildfire events impact communities, ecosystems, and cultural resources—and 
can pose continuing hazards long after the fire is extinguished. Flash flooding and erosion from heavy 
rainstorms are postfire emergencies caused by the severe loss of vegetation cover and alteration of soil 
conditions. Because these impacts pose safety concerns and threaten property and infrastructure, there is a need 
to understand postfire treatments and their effectiveness in facilitating ecosystem resilience and community 
protection. This fact sheet summarizes a working paper (Grover 2021) that compares the effectiveness of 
treatments designed to mitigate the two most common forms of postfire erosion: hillslope and channel erosion. 
 
Methods 
The working paper compiled treatment requests for the 30 most expensive wildfires in the Southwest region 
(2000–2019) using the Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) Burned Area Reports database. To 
determine the effectiveness of different hillslope and channel erosion treatments, treatment attributes and 
average cost per acre/unit of the most widely implemented treatments were compared (Tables 1 and 2). 
Differences in expenditures are connected with effectiveness measures. 
 
Hillslope Erosion Treatments 
Hillslope erosion treatments are designed to reduce postfire erosion from fire-affected hillslopes and to protect 
downstream resources from severe flooding and sediment deposition. Currently, the most popular hillslope 
treatments include wood shred mulch, straw mulch, and less often seeding. The use of postfire mulching, most 
commonly wood shred and agricultural straw, has increased dramatically in recent years as a treatment to 
reduce hillslope erosion. Wood shred mulch, while a new treatment, is effective at reducing erosion, 
maintaining longevity on hillslopes, and for its use of locally sourced materials. It is recognized as the most 
effective hillslope treatment when risks are high to important values, such as human life and safety and public 
property. Straw mulch is a widely used postfire erosion mitigation tool due to its effectiveness at reducing 
erosion and runoff, its low cost, and its speed of installation. Its relatively low cost per acre to install also 
makes it useful when less critical values are at risk. Postfire seeding is a common hillslope treatment due to its 
relatively low cost per acre and ease of installation. Seeding is only recommended where risks to values are 
low. Often, natural regeneration is a viable and more cost-effective option. 
 
Channel Erosion Treatments 
Channel erosion treatments include removing channel debris (listed as channel clear in Table 2) and installing 
check dams, deflectors, debris basins, and trash racks. Removing debris to reduce impediments to runoff is a 
widely used and effective treatment because it reduces downstream threats to roads, property, and life and 
safety. Installing treatments on steeper channels, such as check dams and trash racks, are uncommon because 
they can be ineffective and require maintenance. If threats to infrastructure remain, expensive and time-
consuming structures like debris basins or deflectors can be installed.

Conclusions and Management Recommendations 
• 
When important values are at high risk, wood shred or straw mulching is most effective at reducing 
hillslope erosion, but costs, speed of implementation, wind redistribution, and natural recovery should be 
considered. 
• 
The most effective methods for reducing risks using channel erosion treatments involve removing 
debris, which prevents debris from being carried by runoff and reduces the likelihood of downstream 
infrastructure plugging and failure.
