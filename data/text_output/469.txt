ABSTRACT -- Researchers, who have suggested that xeric limestone prairies of 
central Pennsylvania are remnants of the Prairie Peninsula, the extension of prairie 
vegetation into the eastern forest, did not take into account the considerable 
differences between limestone prairies and the tallgrass prairies of the Midwest. 
Mesic tallgrass prairies dominated by Andropogon gerardii found in the Central 
Lowlands of the Midwest on deep , rich, glaciated soils definitively constitute 
relicts of the Prairie Peninsula. If the Prairie Peninsula did extend into Pennsylva­
nia, then one would expect to find remnants of mesic tallgrass vegetation. Three 
prairie-types do exist in Pennsylvania; however, mesic tallgrass prairies are not 
present. Xeric limestone prairies of central Pennsylvania are very different from 
tallgrass prairie. 
They are restricted to the Ridge and Valley Physiographic 
Province, are found on unglaciated, shallow, rocky, limestone-derived soils, and are 
dominated by Bouteloua curtipendula. 
Limestone prairies in the northeastern 
United States also are found in the Ridge and Valley in West Virginia and in the 
Interior Low Plateau in Ohio. Though xeric prairies might have been augmented by 
the post-Wisconsin prairie migration during the Hypsitherrnal Interval, they 
probably already were present in the Ridge and Valley of Appalachia before the 
eastward extension of the prairie flora . Furthermore, the calciphile species of xeric 
limestone prairies probably could not inhabit the mountains of the Appalachian 
Plateau, a region depauperate of limestone soils. 
Therefore, according to extant 
vegetation, the tallgrass prairies of the Prairie Peninsula probably did not extend 
into Pennsylvania. 
Key words: Bouteloua curtipendula, Pennsylvania, Prairie Peninsula, Ridge and 
Valley, tallgrass prairie, xeric limestone prairie.

E. Lucy Braun (1955) wrote. "The unusual. rather than the usual, has attracted 
attention . and often proves of great value when reconstructing past events". 
Howe\er. the "unusual" xeric limestone prairies of Pennsylvania have received 
little attention amidst the great forests of Central Appalachia (Laughlin and Uhl 
2003). Plant communities unlike those of the surrounding and dominant vegetation 
are often regarded as "remnants of a time when the type of vegetation which they 
represent \\';s more widespread, or perhaps dominant" (Braun 1928a). Remnant 
communities have become surrounded by an "advancing flora" and according to 
Gleason (1923): 
"It is entirely beyond the limits of probability or coincidence to presume that 
a dozen or more species, normally growing together in one section of the 
country. should also be found together in another remote section beyond the 
normal limits of dispersal of any of them. Isolated colonies of this character 
.....can have but one significance, that at some time in the past these 
colonies were more numerous and separated by narrow intervals within the 
normal migration-capacity of the species, or were entirely continuous over 
the whole area." 
There are 10 known xeric limestone prairies in Pennsylvania. They are small (none 
exceed 0.3 ha), scattered, and have declined by 48% over the past century 
(Laughlin 2003, Laughlin and UhI2003). Some scholars have postulated that these 
prairies represent remnants of a former extension of mesic tallgrass prairie into 
central Pennsylvania (Losensky 196I, Waltman and Ciolkosz 1995). 
Typical prairie plants are found naturally in Pennsylvania. A review of Ladd 
(1997) and Rhoads and Klein (1993) revealed that 52% (509 of988) of the species in 
Ladd's list of tallgrass prairie plants are native to Pennsylvania, and 25% (126 of 
509) of these native Pennsylvania prairie species are listed as endangered or 
threatened in Pennsylvania. Moreover, 25% (509 of 2076) of all plant species 
native to Pennsylvania also are found in the tallgrass prairie. Therefore, one could 
argue that the tallgrass prairie might once have existed in presettlement Pennsylva­
rua. 
The Prairie Peninsula (Transeau 1935) was "the wedge-shaped or peninsula­
like projection of prairie vegetation (or prairie biota) extending from the prairie 
grasslands eastward into the deciduous forest" (Stuckey 1981). Transeau (1905, 
1935) used climatic, paleoclimatic, and ecological features of the region to suggest 
the location of the easternmost extension of the tallgrass prairie. Transeau (1935) 
mentioned prairie floras in northwestern Pennsylvania (he did not cite an example 
and his map does not include any locations in Pennsylvania), possibly referring to 
"blazing star prairies", as evidence of the possible extent of tallgrass vegetation 
into Pennsylvania. Most importantly, however, Transeau (1905) suggested that 
the 100% ratio of rainfall to' potential evaporation boundary line lies in western 
Pennsylvania. 
Also, average midsummer relative humidity in Pennsylvania 
matched humidity levels in the rest of the Prairie Peninsula (Transeau 1935).

Therefore, the eastern boundary of climatic conditions that could allow for prairie/ 
savanna dominance was in western Pennsylvania and that the climate east (and 
north and south) of this boundary was suitable for the eastern deciduous forest. 
Most scholars suggest that the grasslands of the Prairie Peninsula reached 
peak distribution during a time of global drought, known as the Hypsithermal 
Interval (8000 to 4000 YBP), when the western species more adapted to dry climates 
migrated toward the east (Stuckey 1981, Webb et al. 1983, Baskin et a!. 1994). A 
more recent warm and dry period known as the "Medieval Warm Period" or 
"Medieval Climatic Optimum" also occurred globally and locally in North America 
from ca. A.D. 900 to 1300 (Brush 1991, Luckman 1994). This period has been 
associated with more frequent wild fires (Brush 1991) and the development of oak 
(Quercus spp.) savannas (Nuzzo 1985). 
During cooler and wetter times, the 
grassland has been colonized by forest, but research strongly suggested that many 
large remnants throughout the Midwestern states persisted because of a frequent 
fire regime (Gleason 1923, Pyne 1987, Heikens and Robertson 1994). Therefore, no 
clear and simple relationship has been shown to exist between climate and the 
distribution of grassland because other factors, such as fire and grazing animals, 
played significant and integral roles (Anderson 1982). 
The easternmost extension of the Prairie Peninsula is disputed, but many 
scholars have drawn the boundary in central or eastern Ohio based on extant 
relicts of tallgrass vegetation (Gray 1878, Adams 1902, Braun 1921, Gleason 1923, 
Schaffner 1926, Braun 1928a, 1928b, 1950, Anderson 1983). 
The easternmost 
bluestem prairie in Kuchler's (1964) map of potential natural vegetation of the 
United States was in west-central Ohio; Pennsylvania was composed almost 
entirely of Appalachian oak (Quercus spp.) and Northern Hardwood forests. Also, 
Delcourt and Delcourt (1981) did not show any type of grassland community in 
Pennsylvania in their vegetation maps for eastern North America from 40,000 YBP 
to the present. Today, however, Pennsylvania hosts three distinct prairie-types. 
These are the "blazing star prairies" of western Pennsylvania (Jennings 1939, 
Aaron 1974), the serpentine barrens and grasslands of the Piedmont Province (Fike 
1999, Tyndall and Hull 1999), and the xeric limestone prairies (sensu Baskin et a!. 
1994 and Baskin and Baskin 2000) of the Ridge and Valley Physiographic Province 
(Laughlin and Uhl 2003). 
The Big Barrens of Kentucky and Tennessee once was considered part of 
the Prairie Peninsula by Transeau (1935), but Baskin and Baskin (1981) and 
Baskin et al. (1994) used geological, edaphic, botanical, and paleobotanical data 
to determine that it was not part of the Prairie Peninsula. Transeau's (1905, 
1935) analysis of climatic data suggested that the Prairie Peninsula also might 
have extended into Pennsylvania. 
If the Prairie Peninsula did extend into 
Pennsylvania, then one would expect to find remnants of mesic tallgrass 
vegetation. 
Through reviews of the literature I examined the plant species 
composition and abiotic conditions of prairie communities throughout Pennsyl­

vania. with special attention to the xeric limestone prairies, to suggest that the 
Prairie Peninsula did not extend into Pennsylvania. 
THE PRAIRIE-TYPES OF PENNSYLVANIA 
The eastern-most prairie-like habitats in Pennsylvania are the serpentine 
barrens of the Piedmont (Fig, I), which are characterized by toxic soils (Reed 1986, 
Tyndall and Hul1 1999). They are a unique feature of southeastern Pennsylvania 
and host many warm-season C4 non-forest grasses such as Schizachyrium 
scoparium, Muhlenbergia mexicana, Eragrostis speclabilis, Andropogon 
gerardii, Sporobolus heterolepis , Sorghastrum nutans, and Bouteloua 
curtipendula. Nomenclature follows Rhoads and Block (2000). Serpentine barrens 
also contain non-forest forbs such as Ageratina aromaticum, Solidago nemoralis, 
Asclepias vertlcillata, and A. viridiflora (Fike 1999). They also contain endemic 
taxa, such as Symphyotrichum depauperatum and Cerastium arvense var. 
villosum, which suggests that this community developed independently of the 
western prairies. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that the serpentine 
barrens were ever an extension of the Prairie Peninsula. 
The western-most prairie-like habitats in Pennsylvania are the scattered 
remnants of blazing star prairies restricted to western Pennsylvania on the 
unglaciated region of the Appalachian Plateau (Fig. I). They are mesic meadows 
dominated by forbs, most notably Liatris spicata, which is predominately an 
eastern species . 
Other common species include Rudbeckia laciniata, 
Pycnanthemum virginianum, Polygala sanguinea, Silphium trifoliatum, Ratibida 
pinnata, Coreopsis tripteris, Veronicastrum virginicum, Gentiana andrewsii, and 
Packera aurea (Aaron 1974, Ostrander 2000). I have seen a few individuals of 
Andropogon gerardil, but overall, prairie grasses are noticeably absent. 
The 
meadows lie just southeast of the Wisconsin glacial boundary. Glaciofluvial 
processes created prehistoric lake basins to the southeast of the glacial boundary 
where fine silt and clay particles settled to form the soil on which the meadows 
became established. Aaron (1974) and others (Anonymous 1996) suggested that 
these meadows are remnants of the eastern extension of tallgrass prairie vegetation 
during the Hypsithermal Interval. 
However, associating these meadows with 
tallgrass prairie is difficult to justify because they are so floristically different; 
meadows lacking perennial grasses are not true prairies. Furthermore, they are not 
found on glacial till; rather, they are restricted to prehistoric lake basins formed 
from glacial outwash (Table 1). 
Small xeric limestone prairies are restricted to the Ridge and Valley region of 
central Pennsylvania (Fig. 1). Bouteloua curtipendula, a common species on xeric 
uplands in the central plains states (Bazzaz and Parrish 1982) but rare and 
threatened in Pennsylvania, is the dominant grass. 
Danthonia spicata is a

codominant and Schizachyrium scoparium is also common on a few sites. 
Anemone virginiana , Solidago nemoralis, Monarda fistulosa, Lithospermum 
canescens, Asclepias tuberosa, A. verticillata, A. viridiflora, Penstemon hirsutus, 
and Packera obovata are some of the most frequently found forbs on these sites 
(Laughlin and Uhl 2003) . Eleven species found on these prairies are listed in 
Pennsylvania as endangered, threatened, or of special concern. These species are 
the following: 
An emone cylindrica, Bromus kalmii, Unum sulcatum, 
Lithospermum canescens, Onosmodium molle var. hispidissimum, Ophioglossum 
engelmannii, Dichanthelium oligosanthes, Ranunculus jascicularis, Ruellia  
humilis, Cassia marilandica, and Oligoneuron rigidum , The limestone prairies are  
restricted to south-southwest facing slopes within the valleys of the Ridge and  
Valley and are found on shallow, rocky, and slightly alkaline limestone-derived,  
clay loam soils (Laughlin and Uhl 2003).

ON THE ORIGIN OF LIMESTONE PRAIRIES 
The origin of xeric limestone prairies cannot be explained by current 
environmental conditions because they probably entered the region in a period 
unlike the present (Braun 1928b). Past influences, in particular use of fire by Native 
Americans and other anthropogenic disturbances, together with current edaphic 
conditions allowed the small prairies to persist among the deciduous .forests of 
central Appalachia (Laughlin, In Press). ln Pennsylvania, Delaware Indians have 
been reported to use fire as a hunting technique (Lindestrom 1925) and to improve 
hunting habitat (Losensky 1961), but there is much debate as to the frequency of 
use of fire by aboriginals in the northeastern United States (Myers and Peroni 1983, 
Russell 1983, Laughlin, In Press). Woody species have not completely invaded 
these prairies because dry edaphic conditions make invasion too difficult (Braun 
1928b, 1955). However, given enough time and favorable weather conditions, these

17 
small patches of prairie might become invaded completely by drought tolerant 
eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginian a) and other woody species (Laughlin, In 
Press). 
The xeric limestone prairies of Pennsylvania are very similar to the limestone 
prairies in the Ridge and Valley of West Virginia (Bartgis 1993) and these both bear 
resemblance to the Schizachyrium scoparium-Bouteloua curtipendula prairies in 
southern Ohio on the Interior Low Plateau (Fig. 2) (Braun 1928a, I928b, 1951 , 1955). 
All three of these prairie associations have rather similar species compositions and 
edaphic conditions and occur on unglaciated soils. 
Bouteloua curtipendula was the most abundant grass in the limestone 
prairies of Pennsylvania (Laughlin and Uhl 2003) and West Virginia (Bartgis 1993) 
within the Ridge and Valley and the second most abundant grass in the limestone 
prairies of Ohio (Table I). Schizachyrium scoparium, the most abundant grass in 
the limestone prairies of Ohio, also was found in the limestone prairies of 
Pennsylvania, but to a limited extent. 
The limestone prairies of the Ridge and Valley and of Ohio were all found on 
xeric calcareous soils (Braun 1928b, Bartgis 1993, Laughlin and Uhl 2003). The 
Schizachyrium scoparium-Bouteloua curtip endula prairie remnants of Ohio oc­
curred on "the uppermost Silurian formations of the Cedarville and Monroe 
dolomites" (Braun 1928b), and flora dominated by Bouteloua curtipendula in 
Pennsylvania occurred on limestone-derived soils. Braun (1928b) described the 
Ohio prairie soils as "very stony ... so much so as to suggest a gravel soil". Soils of 
the limestone prairies in Pennsylvania were also extremely rocky, often with 
exposed limestone bedrock at the surface (Laughlin and Uhl 2003). Rocky soils 
contributed solely to limestone prairie maintenance at present (Laughlin, In Press). 
Braun (1928b) stated that under these dry edaphic conditions "water supply would 
approach that of a region of lower rainfall [so that] the abundant stored supply of 
an evenly distributed annual rainfall so necessary for development of a deciduous 
forest is not present". 
In contrast, soils of tallgrass prairie remnants in the 
Midwest are generally deep, rich loarns (Braun 1928b). 
Another similarity between Ohio and Ridge and Valley limestone prairies is 
that neither lies in the zone of Wisconsin glaciation (Table I). Braun (1928a, 195I) 
was the first to describe these xeric prairies south of the glacial border and she 
attributed their uniqueness to an earlier origin. Some scholars argued they were 
related to the post-Wisconsin Xerothermic extension of prairie into Ohio (see 
Stuckey 198I), but Braun (I 928a, 1951) determined these xeric prairie remnants to be 
pre-Illinoian in age (greater than 300,000 YBP) because they were not found on 
glacial till in the Central Lowlands .but were in the distinct, unglaciated region of 
the Interior Low Plateau (Fig. 2). The prairies in the glacial till deposited by 
Wisconsin glaciers were mesic grasslands dominated by Andropogon gerardii, 
"the typical eastern expression of prairie in the prairie-deciduous forest transition 
region" (Braun 1928a). However, neither the Schizachyrium scoparium-Bouteloua

Plateau, 2 =Central Lowlands, 3 = Appalachian Plateaus, 4 = Ridge and Valley, and 
5 = Piedmont. 
curtipendula prames of southern Ohio nor the xeric limestone prames of 
Pennsylvania resemble the mesic tallgrass prairies of the Wisconsin-drift. Though 
xeric limestone prairies of Pennsylvania and West Virginia might have been 
augmented by the post-Wisconsin prairie migration (Braun 1928a, 1951, 1955), I 
suggest that limestone prairies are not remnants of the eastward extension of the 
Prairie Peninsula. 
In summary, xeric limestone prairies are vastly different from the tallgrass 
prairie remnants of the Prairie Peninsula (Table I). The limestone prairies of Ohio, 
West Virginia, and Pennsylvania are xeric prairies found on unglaciated, shallow, 
rocky, limestone-derived soils and are dominated by perennial grasses such as 
Bouteloua curtipendula and Schizachyrium scoparium . Prairie remnants of the 
Prairie Peninsula are mesic grasslands found on deep and fertile glacial till of the 
Wisconsin-drift and are dominated by tallgrasses such as Andropogon gerardii, 
Sorghastrum nutans, and Panicum virgatum. Furthermore, the limestone prairies 
of Pennsylvania and West Virginia are restricted to the Ridge and Valley 
Physiographic Province. Limestone prairies dominated by Bouteloua curtipendula

probably dispersed north through the Ridge and Valley from the south-central 
states because they could not have traversed east over the mountains of the 
Appalachian Plateau, a region depauperate of limestone soils (Laughlin 2003). 
Therefore, according to extant vegetation the tallgrass prairies of the Prairie 
Peninsula probably did not extend into Pennsylvania.
