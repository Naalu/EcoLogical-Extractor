ABSTRACT 
 
Pre-fire treatment effects and post-fire forest dynamics  
on the Rodeo-Chediski burn area, Arizona 
 
Barbara A. Strom 
 
 
The 2002 Rodeo-Chediski fire was the largest wildfire in Arizona history at 
189,000 ha (468,000 acres), and exhibited some of the most extreme fire behavior ever 
seen in the Southwest.  Pre-fire fuel reduction treatments of thinning, timber harvesting, 
and prescribed burning on the White Mountain Apache Tribal lands (WMAT) and 
thinning on the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest (A-S) set the stage for a test of the 
upper boundary of effectiveness of fuel reduction treatments at decreasing burn severity.  
On the WMAT, we sampled 90 six-hectare study sites two years after the fire, 
representing 30% of the entire burn area on White Mountain Apache Tribe lands, or 
34,000 hectares, and comprising a matrix of three burn severities (low, moderate, or high) 
and three treatments (cutting and prescribed burning, prescribed burning only, or no 
treatment).  Prescribed burning without cutting was associated with reduced burn 
severity, but the combination of cutting and prescribed burning had the greatest 
ameliorative effect.  Increasing degree of treatment was associated with an increase in the 
number of live trees and a decrease in the extremity of fire behavior as indicated by 
crown base height and bole char height.  Ponderosa pine regeneration was very low in 
untreated areas, with no ponderosa regeneration in high severity untreated areas; over 
half the study area had no ponderosa regeneration, and 16% of the study area had no 
ponderosa regeneration and no surviving ponderosa trees.  On the A-S, we sampled seven 

 
iii
pairs of thinned/unthinned study sites two years after the fire.  Thinned areas had more 
live trees, higher survival, and less extreme fire behavior as indicated by crown base 
height and bole char height.  Ponderosa pine regeneration was patchily distributed over 
the study sites, and lower in untreated areas.  Differences between thinned and untreated 
areas persisted for several decades after the fire in stand structure characteristics and for 
at least 100 years in species dominance when modeled using the Forest Vegetation 
Simulator.  Our findings strongly indicated that thinning, timber harvesting, and 
prescribed burning were associated with reduced burn severity even in an extraordinarily 
intense fire, provided that the treatments occurred within the decade before the fire.  
Future forest development on the burn area will most likely take one of two trajectories: 
recovery to a ponderosa pine/Gambel oak forest or a shift to an alternative stable state 
such as an oak/manzanita shrubfield, with untreated and high-severity areas more apt to 
undergo a shift to a shrubfield state.

Figure 3.1. Burn severity as measured by ∆NBR over the extent of the Rodeo-Chediski 
fire was mixed.  The burn area and White Mountain Apache Tribe lands in relation to the 
state of Arizona are shown in the lower left.  The “low” severity category included 
unburned areas. ................................................................................................................. 42 
 
Figure 3.2. Comparing the burn severity distribution after the Rodeo-Chediski fire for 
areas treated with prescribed burning over increasing treatment periods indicates that 
1991-2001 is the longest period for which the burn severity distribution is substantially 
different from that of the entire burn area; this is confirmed by a Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
test of the raw ∆NBR distributions for the treatment periods with α= 0.01.  Missing years 
in the sequence are those in which no prescribed burning took place.............................. 43 
 
Figure 3.3.  The burn severity distribution after the Rodeo-Chediski fire for areas that 
underwent fuel reduction treatments between 1991 and 2001 indicates that the 
combination of cutting and prescribed burning had the greatest ameliorative effect on 
burn severity, though prescribed burning alone also considerably reduced burn severity as 
compared to untreated areas and the burn area on WMAT lands as a whole.  All pairwise 
comparisons of the severity distributions for each treatment type are significantly 
different (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of the raw ∆NBR distributions for the treatment 
types with α= 0.01). .......................................................................................................... 44

WMAT lands. ................................................................................................................... 45 
 
Figure 3.5. Forest density decreases with increasing burn severity (p = 0.001), and 
mortality appears to be highest in areas with no pre-fire fuel reduction treatment (p = 
0.002 for overall treatment effect), but interaction of treatment and severity was 
significant (p = 0.05).  All pairwise treatment comparisons were significantly different.

but was not significantly different for other pairwise treatment comparisons.................. 47 
 
Figure 3.7. Crown base height and bole char height generally increase with increasing 
burn severity (p = 0.001).  Crown base height is highest in the cut and prescribed burn 
treatment (p = 0.004 for overall treatment effect), while bole char height is highest in 
areas with no treatment (p = 0.001)  However, there was a significant interaction effect 
for both crown base and bole char (p = 0.243 and 0.103, respectively)........................... 48

Figure 3.11. Fuel loadings decreased somewhat with increasing burn severity (0.001); 
this trend appeared to be dominated by changes in forest floor fuels.  However, there was

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
I. Wildfire response to fuel reduction treatments and future forest growth 
 
The 2002 Rodeo-Chediski fire at 189,000 hectares was part of a trend of 
increasingly larger crownfires occurring in the ponderosa pine forests of the Southwest, 
which prior to EuroAmerican settlement in the 1870s had a frequent surface fire regime 
that was then interrupted by overgrazing and fire suppression (Covington and Moore 
1994).  The scope of fuel reduction treatments such as thinning and prescribed burning 
intended to reduce crownfire susceptibility has increased recently, but there has not been 
substantial testing of treatment effectiveness.  Only three studies have systematically 
investigated the effect of fuel reduction treatments on wildfire severity (Martinson and 
Omi 2003, Cram and Baker 2003).  The Rodeo-Chediski fire exhibited some of the most 
extreme fire behavior ever seen in the Southwest (USFS 2002), and numerous well-
documented fuel reduction treatments took place before the fire on both the White 
Mountain Apache Tribal lands and the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, setting the 
stage for a test of the upper boundary of effectiveness of fuel reduction treatments at 
reducing burn severity.. 
 
II. Research questions 
 
The goals of this research were: 1) to determine the type and frequency of fuel 
reduction treatments that were effective in reducing burn severity; 2) to characterize the 

 
2
post-fire forest across a range of treatments (and burn severities, for the study on White 
Mountain Apache Tribal lands);and 3) for the study on the Apache-Sitgreaves National 
Forest, to project differences in species dominance or conversions in vegetation type 
across treatments as the burn area recovers. 
For the study on the White Mountain Apache Tribal lands, we compared post-fire 
forest structure and initial recovery across a matrix of three treatments (1. timber 
harvesting or thinning combined with prescribed burning, 2. prescribed burning only, and 
3. no treatment) and three burn severities (low, moderate, or high).   Our hypotheses were 
that in an extraordinarily intense fire (a) stand treatments before the wildfire leads to 
lower burn severity than in untreated areas; (b) under similar burn severities, post-fire 
forest conditions still vary across treatments; (c) resistance to crown fire in the near future 
is greatest in treated and high-severity areas; and (d) post-fire regeneration and shrubs, 
and thus potentially future forest development, varies across treatments and burn 
severities; untreated and higher-severity areas are more likely to transition from the pre-
fire ponderosa pine forest to an oak-dominated shrubfield. 
For the study on the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, we compared pre- and 
post-fire forest structure, initial recovery, and projected future growth using the Forest 
Vegetation Simulator (Dixon 2003) for seven pairs of thinned/unthinned stands.  Our 
hypotheses were that: (a) pre-wildfire thinning led to lower burn severity than in 
untreated areas; (b) post-fire tree regeneration and shrubs, and thus potential forest 
development, differs on thinned and untreated areas, with higher levels of regeneration in 
untreated areas; (c) differences in post-fire recovery of thinned and untreated areas will 

 
3
persist for several decades following the fire; and (d) untreated areas are more likely to 
transition from the pre-fire ponderosa pine forest to an oak-dominated shrubfield. 
 
III. Significance 
 
 
Unless widespread fuel reduction projects are undertaken in the near future, the 
vast majority of southwestern ponderosa pine forests are likely to experience severe 
crownfire in the next few decades (Agee and Skinner 2005).  Since the Rodeo-Chediski 
fire burned across many ponderosa pine habitat types (USFS 1987), much of the 
Southwest may soon resemble the Rodeo-Chediski burn area.  Our clarification of the 
effects of timber harvesting, thinning, and prescribed burning on wildfire severity and 
post-fire recovery may be applied to ponderosa pine forests throughout the region.  Our 
study has the potential to give land managers insight on how current decisions on timber 
harvests and fuel reduction treatments will affect forests a century or more into the future, 
and help them choose alternatives to minimize destruction of forest resources and ensure 
the sustainability of ponderosa pine forests.

 2. LITERATURE REVIEW 
 
I.  Fire regime changes in southwestern ponderosa pine forests 
 
 
Wildfires in the western United States are becoming larger, more frequent, and 
more intense.  The area burned per year in severe crown fires in southwestern ponderosa 
pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests has been steadily increasing, from tens of ha in the 1960s, 
to tens of thousands of ha in the 1990s, to 189,000 ha (468,000 acres) in the 2002 Rodeo-
Chediski fire (Friederici 2003:xvi).  This is a significant departure from the previous fire 
regime of the area.  Fire scar studies from across the Southwest indicate that before 
extensive EuroAmerican settlement began in the 1870s, low-severity surface fires 
occurred every 2-25 years (Swetnam and Baisan 1996).  Traits such as thick, fire-
resistant bark, rapid seedling growth, and highly combustible litter suggest that frequent 
surface fire was part of the evolutionary environment of ponderosa and related long-
needled pines (Agee 1998). 
Since EuroAmerican settlement, livestock grazing, fire suppression, and selective 
logging of large trees have vastly changed the ponderosa pine forests of the Southwest.  
Early EuroAmerican explorers and settlers made note of “open, park-like” stands of 
mature ponderosa pine (Weaver 1943, Covington and Moore 1994).  Livestock grazing 
had the earliest effect on fire regimes and subsequent forest structure; it reduced the 
abundance and continuity of grasses that both suppressed most pine regeneration and 
acted as fine fuels carrying frequent surface fire (Belsky and Blumenthal 1997).  Fire 
suppression began in the late 1800s, and became much more widespread and effective 

 
5
after World War II when air tankers came into use and firefighting operations became 
more effective (Pyne 1982).  Traditional timber operations focused on the removal of the 
largest, most valuable trees, and precommercial thinning was uncommon until recently 
(Scurlock and Finch 1997).  A number of years with above-average rainfall led to the 
establishment of large numbers of ponderosa pine trees in the first decades of the 20th 
century, especially during 1919 (Cooper 1960, Savage et al. 1996). 
These combined factors resulted in a forest that today is far denser than it was 
prior to EuroAmerican settlement.  Though Native Americans lived in the Southwest 
long before extensive EuroAmerican settlement, for the sake of brevity, the term 
“presettlement” is used to refer to the environment that existed before EuroAmerican 
settlement.  Because of the near-cessation of fire and the slow decay of wood in the arid 
climate of the Southwest, evidence of trees in the form of stumps, downed logs, and 
stump holes persists for decades, thus presettlement forest structure can be reconstructed 
with a good degree of confidence (Covington and Moore 1994, Fulé et al. 1997, Moore et 
al. 2004).  Presettlement forest densities were approx. 70-150 trees/ha, while many 
current stands are approx. 500-1300 trees/ha; also, average tree size has decreased due to 
selective logging and the lack of fire-caused thinning (Fulé et al. 1997, Moore et al. 
2004).  Records of foresters from the early 20th century also confirm that ponderosa 
forests were once much more open (Lang and Stewart 1910, Woolsey 1911, 1912; 
Pearson 1923). 
These forest structural changes outside the known historic range of variability and 
resulting fuel buildups are the major factors leading to recent massive wildfires.  The 
density of small-diameter trees has greatly increased, and pine litter has accumulated on 

 
6
the forest floor, thereby increasing canopy fuels, forest floor fuels, and vertical fuel 
continuity.  Climatic fluctuations may also be playing a role in these structural changes, 
and the current Southwestern drought has certainly been a factor in recent wildfires as 
well (Covington and Moore 1994, Swetnam et al. 1999). 
 
II. Fuel reduction treatments and their effectiveness 
 
Fuel reduction projects such as thinning of small-diameter trees and prescribed 
burning in an attempt to decrease the risk of severe crownfire have remained limited in 
scope until recently (USFS 1999).  The Healthy Forests Restoration Act and Healthy 
Forests Initiative recently increased funding and streamlined the approval process for fuel 
reduction projects (U.S. Senate 2003).  Public reaction has been mixed, particularly to the 
Healthy Forests Initiative, since the vast majority of current fuel reduction projects have 
taken place under its categorical exclusions (USDA/USDI 2004).  Questions still exist as 
to what type, frequency, and placement of fuel reduction treatments is the most effective 
in preventing catastrophic wildfire. 
Stand treatments such as timber harvesting including pre-commercial thinning, 
pre-commercial thinning used alone, prescribed burning, and restoration to presettlement 
conditions using both mechanical thinning and prescribed burning have been shown to 
decrease fuel loading and fuel continuity.  They do so both by removing many of the 
small trees that became established at extremely high densities after EuroAmerican 
settlement, and also by reducing forest floor fuels in the case of prescribed burning.  They 
have been projected to decrease the susceptibility of treated stands to crownfire especially 

 
7
due to their reduction of ladder fuels, which would otherwise allow surface fire to reach 
the canopy, and their reduction of canopy fuels that would otherwise allow a passive 
crownfire (torching) to become an active crownfire (Gaines et al. 1958, Deeming 1990, 
van Wagtendonk 1996, Stephens 1998, Covington et al. 2001, Fulé et al. 2001, Brose and 
Wade 2002). 
While prescribed burning alone reduces fuel loads and may accomplish some 
thinning, model-based studies have questioned whether prescribed burning alone can be 
effective in reducing crown fire susceptibility, due to the limited effect of low-intensity 
fire on canopy and ladder fuels as compared to forest floor fuels (Scott 1998, Fulé et al. 
2002).  Prescribed burning can lead to high mortality of older trees because of the 
accumulation of duff around these trees that can expose the cambium to lethal amounts of 
heat upon combustion, a.k.a. cambial girdling.  This mortality can be reduced by raking 
the duff away from the bases of presettlement trees, but this is labor-intensive and 
perhaps not always feasible over large areas (Covington and Sackett 1984).  The effects 
and intensity of prescribed burning can be difficult to control; prescribed fires that have 
gone beyond the prescription in terms of area or behavior have sometimes had severe 
effects, disinclining land managers from using prescribed fire at a sufficient intensity to 
accomplish significant thinning (Sackett and Haase 1998).  Also, the effects of prescribed 
fire on forest productivity and wildlife are not well known, leading some to argue for 
conservative use of fire until additional research has been conducted  (Tiedemann et al. 
2000). 
Several empirical studies have examined adjacent treated and untreated stands 
after wildfire, reporting that areas that had fuel reduction treatments experienced lower 

 
8
burn severity (Agee et al. 2000); Martinson and Omi (2003) summarized these studies.  
Several were nonsystematic investigations, focused on slash treatments rather than 
prescribed burning and thinning, or were based solely on remote-sensing data without 
field verification (Wagle and Eakle 1979, Omi and Kalabokidis 1991, Vihanek and 
Ottmar 1993).  Weatherspoon and Skinner (1995) found that burn severity, as measured 
by crown scorch and consumption using aerial photos, was higher in harvested stands, 
but the stands they sampled had not been pre-commercially thinned prior to harvest.  
They also found that burn severity was lower in harvested stands where slash had been 
treated than where it was left untreated.  While conventional timber harvesting without 
pre-commercial thinning does reduce fuels in an absolute sense, it generally does not 
reduce ladder fuels, which contribute to crownfire susceptibility, so it cannot be strictly 
considered a fuel reduction treatment (Agee and Skinner 2005). 
Numerous studies of fuel treatment effects have taken place on White Mountain 
Apache Tribal lands.  The White Mountain Apache has been documenting harvesting 
operations since 1937, prescribed burning operations since 1950, and thinning operations 
since 1979.  Gaines et al. (1958) found that a prescribed fire led to significant fuel 
reduction.  Weaver (1955) and Kallander (1969) reported that wildfire severity was 
minimized on areas with recent prescribed burns compared to untreated areas.  
Lindenmuth (1962) studied a prescribed fire that was allowed to burn intensely, and 
reported that more crowning occurred in a recently cut unit due to the presence of 
untreated slash.  After the Rodeo-Chediski fire, Finney et al. (in press) conducted a 
satellite imagery analysis of fire behavior in prescription burned vs. untreated areas on 
the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest and White Mountain Apache Tribal lands, finding 

 
9
that burn severity as assessed by differenced normalized burn ratio was substantially 
reduced in areas with recent prescribed burns (≥ 9 years old) and that, on their leeward 
sides, treatments protected nearby untreated areas. 
Pollet and Omi (2002) systematically examined the effect of treatments 
(prescribed burning, whole-tree thinning, or thinning followed by prescribed burning) on 
burn severity and crown scorch for four wildfires in western ponderosa pine.  Omi and 
Martinson (2002) carried out a similar investigation for four wildfires in ecosystems 
adapted to frequent fire, including two wildfires in ponderosa pine forests, comparing 
recent (< 10 years before wildfire) treatments of single and repeated prescribed burning, 
debris removal, and mechanical thinning with and without slash removal.  Both studies 
found that burn severity and crown scorch were significantly lower in all treated areas.  
These studies collectively considered treatment effect on wildfires across the West and as 
such can be used to make a more generalized statement about treatment effect on burn 
severity.  The treatments for each wildfire differed, however, so treatment effect cannot 
be clearly separated from the effect the location and seasonality of the wildfire may have 
had on burn severity.  Neither study assessed regeneration in order to make predictions 
about future forest dynamics in treated versus untreated areas, nor did they compare 
portions of treated and untreated areas with similar burn severities.  Pollet and Omi 
(2002) also questioned whether fuel treatments will have any effect under extreme fire 
conditions, because drought and high winds may play a more important role in fire 
behavior than fuels. 
Cram and Baker (2003) systematically investigated silvicultural treatment effect 
(commercial timber, individual tree, and group selection harvests; pre-commercial 

 
10
thinning; forest health or aesthetic treatments; prescribed burning; or combinations of the 
above) after four wildfires, including the Rodeo-Chediski fire within the Apache-
Sitgreaves National Forest.  They found that treated areas experienced lower burn 
severity, ground char, and fireline intensity as estimated from bole char than untreated 
areas.  They sampled treatments that were up to 20 years old, and they did not measure 
regeneration, or shrubs at the species level.  A survey of treated and untreated areas 
immediately after the Rodeo-Chediski fire on the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest also 
indicated that treated areas experienced lower burn severity as indicated by tree survival 
and crown scorch and consumption (USFS 2002). 
 
III. Recovery of ponderosa pine forests after crownfire, and alternative stable states 
 
Many models exist for projecting forest development, which fall into two general 
classes: statistical models and process models.  Statistical models, which are based on 
known tree growth patterns and stand dynamics, can be quite accurate over fairly short 
time periods under environmental conditions similar to those under which the model was 
developed.  Process models, which simulate physiological processes involved in growth 
and competition, can incorporate environmental change, and may be more appropriate to 
use for long-term modeling, but require much more complex initiation parameters.  Some 
of these models also predict susceptibility to surface or crown fire, and successional 
dynamics on a landscape influenced by fire.  We used the Forest Vegetation Simulator 
(FVS), an individual-tree growth and yield statistical model (Dixon 2003).  It is 
initialized with standard mensurational data, and outputs both stand-level and tree-level 

 
11
growth data, which can be analyzed by species.  FVS has a variant customized for 
southwestern ponderosa pine, based on the GENGYM model (Edminster et al. 1991), 
such that its projected results are in accordance with knowledge of local stand dynamics.  
FIRESUM (Keane et al. 1989, 1990) is an ecological process model that simulates 
surface fire effects on forest structure and species composition.  It has been used in 
southwestern ponderosa pine forests (Covington et al. 2001), but its short-term predictive 
accuracy is most likely lower than that of statistical models.  FIRE-BGC (Keane et al. 
1996) is a combination of FIRESUM and FOREST-BGC (Running and Coughlan 1998, 
Running and Gower 1991), a biogeochemical process model; however, because of its 
complexity and detailed input requirements, FIRE-BGC is not yet validated for use 
outside the northern Rockies.  FVSBGC is another combination of two pre-existing 
models: FVS and the STAND-BGC process model, which is a modified version of 
FOREST-BGC.  FVSBGC provides an interface between STAND-BGC and FVS such 
that FVS provides the input data for STAND-BGC, which in turn can provide data to 
FVS.  The combination allows modeling of fires as well as forest response to different 
climate and CO2 emissions scenarios (Milner et al. 2003).  We had originally intended to 
use FVSBGC to project future growth on the Rodeo-Chediski burn area over a range of 
climate change scenarios; however, test runs indicated that the model requires further 
calibration before it can be used in southwestern ponderosa pine. 
There has been extensive empirical research on the recovery of pine-dominated 
forests after wildfire (Foxx 1996, Barton 2002, Gracia et al. 2002, Greene et al. 2004, 
Savage and Mast 2005).  Several studies have also modeled forest dynamics after 
wildfire, though not necessarily in pine forests (He et al. 2002, Retana et al. 2002, Chapin 

 
12
et al. 2003).  A number of these studies have questioned whether forests that historically 
had a frequent fire regime are resilient to crownfire. 
There is widespread concern about future development of arid forests such as 
those of the Southwest as large, severe crownfires continue (Hessburg et al. 2005).  
Studies in Arizona (Barton 2002), Mexico (Fulé et al. 2000), and Spain (Retana et al. 
2002) have indicated that intense fire in pine-oak forests may result in a shift to a more 
oak-dominated forest or a conversion to an alternative steady state such as a shrubfield.  
These shifts in species dominance and conversions in vegetation type to what appears to 
be an alternative stable state – i.e., from a ponderosa pine forest to an oak/manzanita 
shrubfield – have been documented after crownfire in several dense southwestern 
ponderosa pine forests by Savage and Mast (2005).  Alternative stable states are self-
perpetuating species assemblages that are distinct from the typical assemblage found in a 
given environment.  Relative to the stature and biomass of the historical plant structure, 
alternative states may be shorter in height (e.g., shrubs vs. trees), with less total biomass, 
and appear to be an earlier sere, though without evidence of near-term shift back toward 
the pre-crownfire forest. 
A shift to such an alternative state can have major consequences for ecosystem 
functions and potential land uses (Laycock 1991, Petraitis and Latham 1999).  For 
instance, Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) is the major oak species on the Rodeo-Chediski 
burn area; while ponderosa pine is the most commercially valuable timber species in the 
Southwest, the only common wood product uses of Gambel oak are fuelwood and 
occasionally fenceposts (Barger and Ffolliott 1972, Johnson 1985, Blatner and Govett 
1988).  Some wildlife species, such as Abert and Kaibab squirrels (Sciurus aberti and S. 

 
13
aberti kaibabensis, respectively), are dependent on ponderosa pine (Keith 1965, Linhart 
1988). 
 
IV. Research approach 
 
No post-wildfire research has been done on a large burn area investigating the 
effect of multiple treatment types on forest survival and initial regrowth across a range of 
burn severities, and little research has been done investigating the effect of fuel reduction 
treatments both on burn severity and projected future forest dynamics.  Because of its 
extreme fire behavior (USFS 2002) and large size, the Rodeo-Chediski fire can serve as a 
test case of the upper boundary of response to fuel treatments in a southwestern forest.  
The goals of this research were to determine the type and frequency of fuel reduction 
treatments that were effective in reducing burn severity, to characterize the post-fire 
forest across a range of treatments and burn severities, and to project differences in 
species dominance or conversions in vegetation type across treatments as the burn area 
recovers.

3. PRE-FIRE TREATMENT EFFECTS AND POST-FIRE FOREST DYNAMICS 
ON WHITE MOUNTAIN APACHE TRIBE LANDS WITHIN THE RODEO-
CHEDISKI BURN AREA, ARIZONA 
 
Abstract 
 
 
The 2002 Rodeo-Chediski fire was the largest wildfire in Arizona history, and 
exhibited some of the most extreme fire behavior ever seen in the Southwestern United 
States.  On the White Mountain Apache Tribal lands within the burn area, pre-fire fuel 
reduction treatments of thinning, timber harvesting, and prescribed burning set the stage 
for a test of the upper boundary of effectiveness of fuel reduction treatments at decreasing 
burn severity.  We sampled 90 six-hectare study sites two years after the fire, 
representing 30% (34,000 ha) of the entire burn area on White Mountain Apache Tribe 
lands, and comprising a matrix of three burn severities (low, moderate, or high) and three 
treatments (cutting and prescribed burning, prescribed burning only, or no treatment).  
Our findings indicate that thinning, timber harvesting, and prescribed burning were 
associated with reduced burn severity even in an extraordinarily intense fire, provided 
that the treatments occurred within the decade before the fire.  Prescribed burning without 
cutting reduced burn severity considerably, but the combination of cutting and prescribed 
burning had the greatest ameliorative effect.  While burn severity explained more of the 
variation in forest structure than did treatments, increasing degree of treatment was 
associated with an increase in the number of live trees and a decrease in the extremity of 
fire behavior as indicated by crown base height and bole char height.  Ponderosa pine 
regeneration was very low in untreated areas, with no ponderosa regeneration whatsoever 
in high severity untreated areas.  Over half the study area had no ponderosa regeneration, 

 
15
and 16% of the study area had no ponderosa regeneration and no surviving ponderosa 
trees.  Future forest development will most likely take one of two trajectories: recovery to 
a ponderosa pine/Gambel oak forest or type conversion to an oak-dominated shrubfield, 
with untreated and high-severity areas more apt to undergo a type conversion. 
 
Introduction 
 
 
Wildfires in frequent fire-adapted ecosystems of the western U.S. are becoming 
larger, more frequent, and more severe largely because of changes in forest structure 
caused by fire suppression, selective logging of large trees, and livestock overgrazing 
occurring after widespread EuroAmerican settlement (Covington and Moore 1994, 
Swetnam et al. 1999).  Stand treatments such as timber harvesting, thinning, and 
prescribed burning have been shown to decrease fuel loads and have been projected to 
decrease the susceptibility of treated stands to crown fire (Deeming 1990, van 
Wagtendonk 1996, Stephens 1998, Covington et al. 2001, Fulé et al. 2001).  While 
prescribed burning alone reduces fuel loads and may accomplish thinning, model-based 
studies have questioned whether prescribed burning alone can be effective in reducing 
crown fire susceptibility, due to the limited effect of low-intensity fire on canopy and 
ladder fuels as compared to forest floor fuels (Scott 1998, Fulé et al. 2002).  Prescribed 
burning can also lead to high mortality of older trees, and its effects can be difficult to 
control (Sackett and Haase 1998). 
Several empirical studies have examined adjacent treated and untreated stands 
after wildfire, reporting that areas that had fuel reduction treatments experienced lower 

 
16
burn severity (Agee et al. 2000, Martinson and Omi 2003).  Several were nonsystematic 
investigations, focused on slash treatments rather than prescribed burning and thinning, 
or were based solely on remote-sensing data without field verification (Wagle and Eakle 
1979, Omi and Kalabokidis 1991, Vihanek and Ottmar 1993, Weatherspoon and Skinner 
1995).  Pollet and Omi (2002) and Omi and Martinson (2002) systematically examined 
the effect of fuel reduction treatments on burn severity and crown scorch for a total of six 
wildfires in western ponderosa pine.  Both studies found that burn severity and crown 
scorch were significantly lower in all treated areas.  These studies collectively considered 
treatment effect on wildfires across the West and as such can be used to make a more 
generalized statement about treatment effect on burn severity.  The treatments for each 
wildfire differed, however, so treatment effect cannot be clearly separated from the effect 
the location and seasonality of the wildfire may have had on burn severity.  They also did 
not assess potential regrowth by measuring regeneration or shrubs.  Cram and Baker 
(2003) systematically investigated silvicultural treatment effect after four wildfires, 
including the Rodeo-Chediski burn area within the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest.  
They found that treated areas experienced lower burn severity, ground char, and fireline 
intensity as estimated from bole char.  They sampled treatments that were up to 20 years 
old and did not measure regeneration or shrubs at the species level.  No post-wildfire 
research has been done on a large burn area investigating the effect of multiple treatment 
types on forest survival and initial regrowth across a range of burn severities. 
The Rodeo-Chediski fire was the largest wildfire in Arizona’s recorded history 
(Friederici 2003:xvi).  It burned approximately 189,000 ha (468,000 acres) from June 18 
- July 7, 2002, largely on the White Mountain Apache Tribe lands and the Apache-

 
17
Sitgreaves National Forest (USFS 2002), leaving a mixed pattern of burn severity (Figure 
1).  Overall fire behavior was extreme: this was a plume-dominated wind, fuel, and 
topographically driven fire, very different from previous wind-driven large fires which 
tended to assume a long, narrow shape pointing to the northeast.  Plume collapses 
occurred up to five times per day, flame lengths on both the White Mountain Apache 
Tribe lands and the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest reached 60-120 m (200-400 ft), 
and the rate of spread was 6.4 km/hour (4 mph) at its maximum (USFS 2002).  Fuel 
moisture content for all size classes was below 4% for the duration of the fire, and 
afternoon wind gusts exceeded 40 km/h (25 mph) on most days and 73 km/h on June 21 
(45 mph; Finney et al., in press). 
If current wildfire trends continue, the vast majority of southwestern ponderosa 
pine forests are likely to experience severe crownfire in the next few decades (Agee and 
Skinner 2005).  Temperature and precipitation are expected to increase in the Southwest 
due to climate change, which may also increase the frequency and total area burned by 
severe fires (McKenzie et al. 2004).  Much of the Southwest may resemble the Rodeo-
Chediski burn area; thus, determining the potential future trajectories of the burn area 
becomes even more important.  Three studies of forest regrowth after wildfire, in Arizona 
(Barton 2002), Mexico (Fulé et al. 2000), and Spain (Retana et al. 2002) have projected 
that intense fire in pine-oak forests may result in a conversion to an oak-dominated forest 
or shrubfield.  This conversion to a shrubfield state has been confirmed to persist up to 
five decades after some crownfires in dense ponderosa pine forests by Savage and Mast 
(2005).  Previous studies have questioned whether fuel treatments will have any effect 

 
18
under extreme fire conditions (Pollet and Omi 2002).  The Rodeo-Chediski served as a 
test case of the upper boundary of response to fuel treatments. 
Our hypotheses were that in an extraordinarily intense fire: (a) stand treatments 
(prescribed burning alone, and timber harvesting or thinning combined with prescribed 
burning) before the wildfire led to lower burn severity than in untreated areas; (b) under 
similar burn severities, post-fire forest conditions still vary across treatments; (c) 
resistance to crown fire in the near future is greatest in treated and high-severity areas; 
and (d) post-fire regeneration and shrubs, and thus potentially future forest development, 
varies across treatments and burn severities; untreated and higher-severity areas are more 
likely to transition from the pre-fire ponderosa pine forest to an oak-dominated 
shrubfield. 
 
Methods 
 
Study Area 
 
The Rodeo-Chediski burn area’s 189,000 hectares (468,000 acres) span the 
Mogollon Rim in east-central Arizona.  The majority of the burn area is within the 
northwestern portion of the White Mountain Apache Tribe lands (WMAT) to the south of 
the Mogollon Rim and the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest to the north of the 
Mogollon Rim.  This study focused on the portion of the burn area on the White 
Mountain Apache Tribe lands.  July maximum air temperature is 29.2ºC (84.5ºF), 
January minimum temperature is -7.8 ºC (17.9 ºF), annual precipitation is 50.6 cm (19.9 
in), and annual snowfall is 99.3 cm (39.1 in); these are 1971-2000 averages (excepting 

 
19
snowfall, a 1950-2004 average) from the Heber Ranger Station on the northwestern edge 
of the burn area.  The study sites ranged in elevation from 2,000 – 2,295 m (6,560 – 
7,530 ft).  Forests on mid-elevation sites were dominated by ponderosa pine (Pinus 
ponderosa) with Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii), alligator juniper (Juniperus deppeana), 
New Mexico locust (Robinia neomexicana), and pinemat manzanita (Arctostaphylos 
pungens).  Higher-elevation sites included ponderosa pine, white fir (Abies concolor), 
and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii).  Soils are largely of the Overgaard Series, with 
some from the Haplustolls and Elledge Series; soil types ranged from gravelly loam and 
gravelly fine sandy loam to rock outcrop complexes.  The topography was rugged in 
comparison to the portion of the burn area on the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest 
north of the Mogollon Rim. 
The Rodeo-Chediski fire presents an excellent opportunity for a natural 
experiment on the effectiveness of fuel treatments at reducing burn severity.  Finney et al. 
(in press) conducted a GIS analysis of fire behavior and treatment areas on the Rodeo-
Chediski burn area, finding that burn severity as assessed by differenced normalized burn 
ratio was substantially reduced in treated areas; their results have not yet been verified in 
the field, however.  The WMAT has been documenting their harvesting operations since 
at least 1937, prescribed burning operations since at least 1950 (Weaver 1951) and 
thinning operations since at least 1979, so detailed spatial data is available on fuel 
reduction treatments.  Perhaps due to these meticulous records, some of the earliest 
comparisons of wildfire effect on treated vs. untreated areas took place on WMAT lands 
(Weaver 1955, Kallander 1969).  Because the fire moved so quickly on WMAT lands 
that extensive suppression operations could not be undertaken safely, the effect of 

 
20
backfires, burnouts, and other suppression operations on burn severity versus 
uncontrolled wildfire behavior was minimized (USFS 2002).  While we did not have 
fine-scale data on fire behavior – i.e., whether a given stand burned during the day or 
night, or during a plume collapse – and thus could not determine the effect of transient 
environmental conditions on burn severity, a large number of widely distributed study 
sites should mitigate their cumulative effects. 
 
 
Study Site Selection 
 
 
We gauged burn severity according to a differenced normalized burn ratio 
(∆NBR) map created by the National Park Service/US Geological Survey Burn Severity 
Mapping Project (2002).  ∆NBR is calculated from Landsat ETM+ images taken before 
and after the fire using the ratio of near-infrared (band 4) to mid-infrared (band 7) 
reflectance.  ∆NBR has been shown to correspond well with burn severity in the 
Southwest (Miller and Yool 2002, van Wagtendonk et al. 2004).  No ∆NBR severity 
thresholds have been field-verified on WMAT lands, so our severity classification 
thresholds were modified from of those developed for the 2001 Leroux fire in the 
Coconino National Forest, Arizona, approximately 150 km from the Rodeo-Chediski 
burn area (Cocke et al., in press); we combined the unburned and low severity categories 
because of the very low percentage of unburned area within the fire perimeter.  The burn 
severity map of the Rodeo-Chediski fire generated using these thresholds (low: < 240; 
moderate: 241-570; high: > 570) is shown in Figure 3.1. 
 
The hypothesis of treatment effect on burn severity was inherent to our sampling 
design, especially with regard to the treatment period; this allowed us to investigate the 

 
21
effect of different treatments on areas with similar burn severities.  We compared the 
burn severity distribution  of prescribed burning treatments with different years as 
starting points of the treatment period (Figure 3.2), using a two-sample Kolmogorov-
Smirnov test of a 0.5% subsample of the raw ∆NBR data.  We chose to sample treatments 
that took place within the ten years before the fire (1991-2001), because the burn severity 
distribution for treatment periods starting before 1991 was not significantly different 
from that of the entire burn area.  The 10-year time period was also recognized in the 
Forest Service fire summary report as the most effective (USFS 2002).  While prescribed 
burning was associated with decreased burn severity, the combination of cutting and 
prescribed burning had the greatest ameliorative effect (Figure 3.3).  Pairwise 
comparisons of the burn severity distributions for each treatment type were significantly 
different, according to the same Kolmogorov-Smirnov method that was used to determine 
the longest effective prescribed burning treatment period. 
We sampled only the treatments of cut and prescribed burn, prescribed burn only, 
and no treatment.  “Cutting” included uneven-aged forest management and non-
commercial thinning followed by slash disposal and broadcast burning.  Uneven-aged 
management guidelines followed a range of a Q-slope factor of 1.1 – 1.3, an SDI 
maximum of 1,110 25.5-cm trees/hectare (450 10-inch trees/acre), and maximum 
diameter of 46-76 cm (18-30 in) (Youtz 2003).  Out of 111,837 hectares (276,355 acres) 
burned on WMAT land by the R-C fire, 13% were cut and prescription burned and 9.4% 
were only prescription burned during or after 1991 (Table 3.1). 
 
Ninety 6-hectare study sites were sampled in May-August of 2004, comprising a 
matrix of three burn severities (low, moderate, or high) by three treatments (cutting and 

 
22
prescribed burning, prescribed burning only, or no treatment).  In order to obtain a more 
accurate spatial representation of all treatment/severity combinations, study sites were 
distributed equally across treatments and burn severities, with approximately ten sites per 
treatment/severity combination.  Study sites were situated on areas at least 2000 m in 
elevation and no greater than 45% slope, based on 10-meter resolution USGS DEMs 
obtained from GeoComm International Corp. (www.geocomm.com).  We used the 
elevational constraint to ensure that our study sites would be in forested areas dominated 
by ponderosa pine, since some lower-elevation portions of the burn area are piñon-
juniper woodlands.  The slope constraint ensured that we would not be comparing treated 
areas on relatively gentle slopes to areas that could not have feasibly been treated because 
they were on unworkably steep slopes. 
GIS coverages of treatment history included spatial data on thinning operations 
beginning in 1979, prescribed burning operations beginning in 1950, and timber 
harvesting operations going back to 1937.  Over the entire treatment history (1937-2001) 
of the sample area, and grouping all treatment types, the “cut and burn” area had a total 
of 4.8±1.7 treatments, the “burn only” area had 2.9±1.2 treatments, and the “no 
treatment” area had 2.8±1.7 treatments (occurring prior to 1991, in the case of the “no 
treatment” area).  The “cut and burn” area appears to have been more intensively 
managed than the “burn only” area, given that they differ by more than a single “cut” 
treatment occurring between 1991 and 2001.  The sample area within elevation and slope 
constraints was 30% of the entire burn area on White Mountain Apache Tribe lands, or 
34,000 hectares.  Thirty-two percent of this sample area was cut and prescription burned 
and 15% only prescription burned during or after 1991 (Table 3.1).

Study site locations were randomly chosen within the treatment/severity 
combinations using GIS.  Study sites and the area sampled within treatment/severity 
categories and elevation/slope constraints are shown in Figure 4.  A systematic grid of 
five plots was established on each study site, for an estimated total of 90 x 5 = 450 plots.  
Our final study site distribution was not fully balanced.  Ten sites were measured in most 
treatment/severity combinations, but eight sites were measured in burn only/low severity 
areas, and twelve in burn only/moderate severity areas.  Ten sites were measured on no 
treatment/high severity and cut and burn/high severity areas, but 47 rather than 50 plots 
were sampled on each of these areas.  A total of 444 plots were sampled across all 
treatment/severity combinations.  Plots were located using a Garmin GPS 12 with ten-
meter resolution.  If the original location of a plot fell on a slope of greater than 45%, the 
plot center was moved to the nearest area where the majority of the plot would be less 
than 45% slope; original plot locations that would have included roads were similarly 
moved. 
 
Measurements 
 
 
Overstory trees were measured on a variable-radius plot using a prism with a BAF 
of approximately 2.2 m2/hectare per tree (10 ft2/acre per tree).  Tree measurements 
included: tree species, condition, diameter at breast height (~1.4m), total height, canopy 
base height, bole char height (minimum and maximum), and dwarf mistletoe rating 
(Hawksworth 1977).   Tree condition classes followed Thomas’ (1979) description and 
included: live, declining, and four stages of snags (recent snag, loose-bark snag, clean 

 
24
snag, and snag broken above breast height).  Since field measurements were taken two 
years after the fire, we did not attempt to estimate foliage scorch, as the majority of 
scorched needles had already fallen from the trees.  A subsample of trees (the live 
specimens of the first four trees on the plot; trees were numbered starting at north and 
proceeding clockwise around the plot) were cored in order to produce age and growth 
increment data.  Tree increment cores were surfaced and crossdated (Stokes and Smiley, 
1968) following standard methods or rings were counted for cores that could not be 
crossdated, e.g., some junipers.  For cores that missed the pith, additional years to the 
center were estimated with a pith locator (Applequist 1958). 
Tree regeneration (saplings and seedlings below breast height) and shrubs were 
measured on a 40.5 m2, 3.6 m radius plot (1/100 acre) with origin at plot center.  This 
regeneration/shrub subplot was intended to correspond to the CFI (Continuous Forest 
Inventory) Minor Plot 2 described by Vandendriesche (1994) for ease of comparison with 
the CFI plots on the White Mountain Apache Tribal lands.  Tree regeneration and shrubs 
were tallied by species, condition (living or dead), and height class (0-40 cm, 41-80 cm, 
81-137 cm, or exact height if > 137 cm).  We measured forest floor fuels on a 15.24-
meter (50-foot) planar transect at a random azimuth from each plot center, using Brown’s 
(1974) method.  Coefficients for planar transect calculations are from Sackett (1980).  
Coefficients used to convert litter and duff depth to forest floor fuel loadings in 
megagrams/hectare are from Ffolliott et al.’s (1968) measurements of forest floor weight 
in northern Arizona ponderosa pine stands. 
We took two photographs of each plot: a hemispherical photo using a digital 
camera with a 180º fisheye lens (Nikon CoolPix E4300 using FC-E8 Fisheye Converter 

 
25
Lens with UR-E4 Converter Adapter) at plot center in order to record canopy cover, and 
a plot photograph using a standard lens (Canon PowerShot A70) from 12 m east of plot 
center.  Hemispherical photos were analyzed with Gap Light Analyzer (Institute of 
Ecosystem Studies 1999) in order to determine forest canopy structure and gap light 
transmission indices. 
 
Data Analysis 
 
 
While our data were parametric, inspection of the measurement distributions 
using frequency histograms, the Shapiro-Wilkes W statistic, and Levene’s test revealed 
that only a few measurements were both normally distributed and had equal variances.  
We used DISTLM (Anderson 2004), which performs a distribution-free, distance-based 
multifactor multivariate analysis of variance using permutation.  We carried out 999 
permutations for each test, and used the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity distance measure for 
each test.  The alpha used to denote a significant difference was 0.05.  Since the method 
used by DISTLM calculates an exact p-value, it has been argued that it is not subject to 
alpha inflation (Anderson 2001, Anderson and Robinson 2001).  When testing overall 
regeneration and shrubs, we performed both an unstandardized test and a test with the 
abundance of each species standardized by its total abundance across all plots, in case the 
dominant species were skewing the results.

Results 
 
 
Fuel reduction treatments within the decade before the fire were consistently 
associated with a large reduction in burn severity as measured by remote sensing using 
∆NBR (Figure 3.3).   Prescribed burning that occurred more than eleven years before the 
Rodeo-Chediski fire did not appreciably decrease burn severity (Figure 2).  Sites that had 
prescribed burns had considerably reduced severity, but the combination of cutting and 
prescribed burning was associated with the largest reduction in burn severity. 
 
Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Fendler’s ceanothus (Ceanothus fendleri) 
were the dominant species in the burn area.  Alligator juniper (Juniperus deppeana), 
Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii), and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) were also 
common in the overstory, after which abundances of other species dropped sharply 
(Table 2).  Fendler’s ceanothus was by far the most abundant shrub, though pinemat 
manzanita (Arctostaphylos pungens) was also present on many sites (Table 3.3). 
 
Stand-level measurements show that fire effects associated with extreme fire 
behavior were reduced in treated areas.  Forest structure attributes, including density, 
basal area, crown base and bole char height, and diameter distribution, were all 
significantly related to both degree of treatment and severity levels, and generally showed 
a trend with increasing degree of treatment, i.e., from no treatment to burn only to cut and 
burned.  These forest structure attributes displayed much more variation in response to 
burn severity than to treatments – though differences between treated and untreated areas 
became more substantial as burn severity increased – and did not exhibit an interaction 
between treatment and severity (Table 3.4). 

 
27
 
Tree density was highest in the burn only treatment, and decreased sharply with 
increasing severity in untreated areas (Figure 3.5).  There was a shallower decline in 
density with increasing severity in treated areas.  Pairwise comparisons indicate that 
density differed among each of the treatments, across severities (Table 3.4). 
Approximately 12% of the study area had no surviving trees. 
 
Basal area significantly declined with increasing burn severity, similar to the trend 
in tree density, and increased with degree of treatment in moderate and high severity 
areas (Figure 3.6).  Basal area in untreated vs. cut and burned areas was significantly 
different, but prescribed burning did not lead to a significantly different basal area from 
untreated areas or from cut and burned areas. 
 
Crown base height generally increased with increasing burn severity and degree 
of treatment in treated areas.  Bole char height also increased with burn severity, but 
decreased with degree of treatment, indicating more extreme fire behavior in untreated 
areas (Figure 3.7).   The progression in crown base height with increasing burn severity 
was not seen in untreated areas.  While crown base height in burn only areas is not 
significantly different from that of untreated areas (p = 0.86) and is different from that of 
cut and burned areas (p = 0.001), bole char height for all trees in burn only areas is not 
significantly different from that of cut and burned areas (p = 0.251) and is different from 
that of untreated areas (p = 0.008). 
 
The diameter distribution for ponderosa pine was particularly indicative of the 
difference between treated and untreated areas; very few small trees were left on 
moderate and high severity untreated areas (Figure 3.8).  The archetypal reverse-J 
distribution was present in low severity areas, albeit in a modified form, as the 

 
28
distribution peaked at 10-20 cm trees rather than the smallest size class.  Moderate 
severity portions of the burn only treatment also exhibited a reverse-J distribution with 
much greater amplitude than that of moderate severity portions of the cut and burn 
treatment, possibly due to the pre-fire thinning on the cut and burn treatment; these 
treatments were significantly different. 
 
The vast majority of trees, regardless of treatment or severity, were less than 100 
years old (Figure 3.9).  The cumulative age frequencies did not display a clear trend with 
regard to treatment or severity, but treated areas appeared to have proportionally more old 
trees, especially as burn severity increased. 
 
Snag density generally increased with increasing burn severity and decreased 
significantly with degree of treatment (Figure 3.10).  There were 5-50 snags per hectare > 
30 cm DBH, and 1-5 snags per hectare > 50 cm DBH. 
 
Initial post-fire recovery as indicated by fuel loadings, regeneration, and shrubs 
was significantly related to treatment and burn severity levels for all characteristics 
measured except densities of a few individual species.  However, there were virtually no 
apparent trends in response to degree of treatment or increasing severity, as there were 
for most aspects of post-fire forest structure, and there were significant interactions 
between treatment and severity for nearly all aspects of fuels, regeneration, and shrubs 
(Table 3.4). 
 
Fuel loadings decreased with increasing burn severity, though this trend was 
mostly seen in the forest floor fuels; there was a significant treatment/severity interaction 
effect (Figure 3.11).  Fuel loadings were significantly higher in untreated areas than in cut 
and burned areas.  Fine woody fuels (1-100H) and to some extent coarse woody fuels 

 
29
(1000H) were similar across treatments and severities.  The higher amount of coarse 
woody fuels in untreated high severity areas may have been due to a larger number of 
trees already having fallen since the fire. 
 
Regeneration was dominated by sprouting species such as Gambel oak and other 
oaks, and alligator juniper, as well as by New Mexico locust (Figure 3.12).  Ninety-six 
percent of our study area had regeneration of Gambel oak, 97% had Gambel oak or 
another oak species, 52% had New Mexico locust, and 53% had alligator juniper.  While 
regeneration was significantly linked to treatment and severity, a strong interaction effect 
prevailed over any trends with regard to degree of treatment and severity levels.  The 
unstandardized test and the test standardized by species had very similar results, the only 
exception being that the unstandardized test showed that burn only and untreated areas 
were not significantly different, while the standardized test showed significant pairwise 
differences among all treatments.  Considered separately, neither Gambel oak nor New 
Mexico locust showed a significant treatment effect either overall or in any of the 
pairwise comparisons, though New Mexico locust did display an interaction effect (Table 
3.4). 
Ponderosa pine regeneration was ample in moderate severity treated areas, but 
there was little regeneration in untreated areas, and no regeneration was observed in 
untreated areas of high severity (Figure 3.13). In treated areas, ponderosa regeneration 
increased greatly from low to moderate severity areas, with high severity areas having an 
intermediate amount.  There was no significant severity effect when all treatments are 
considered, though there was an interaction effect of treatment and severity and an 
apparent trend in treated areas; all pairwise treatment comparisons were significantly 

 
30
different.  Some regeneration within the taller height classes may have survived the fire, 
especially in low severity areas of the cut and burn treatment.  Over all treatments and 
severities, 57% of our study sites had ponderosa regeneration; broken down by treatment, 
this was 20% of untreated sites, 66% of burn only sites, and 83% of cut and burned sites.  
Expanding this up to the landscape level, untreated high severity areas, which had no 
ponderosa regeneration, constituted 12% of the study area.  Taking all treatments into 
account, approximately 54% of the study area had no ponderosa pine regeneration, and 
16% of the study area had no ponderosa pine regeneration and no surviving ponderosa 
pine trees. 
 
Shrubs on the burn area were overwhelmingly dominated by Fendler’s ceanothus, 
which responded strongly to increasing burn severity and was most abundant in the burn 
only treatment (Figure 3.14).  Overall shrubs (standardized by abundance of each species 
and unstandardized) showed significant effects for treatment, severity, interaction, and all 
pairwise treatment comparisons.  The significant treatment effect for Fendler’s ceanothus 
was largely due to its abundance in the burn only treatment, as there was no significant 
difference in its abundance between cut and burned and untreated areas. Pinemat 
manzanita and other manzanita species were also common.  Unlike Fendler’s ceanothus 
and overall shrubs, manzanita density did not differ significantly in burn only and 
untreated areas, and there was no interaction effect.

Discussion 
 
 
The Rodeo-Chediski fire exhibited some of the most extreme fire behavior ever 
seen in the Southwest (USFS 2002), but its behavior and intensity still responded to pre-
fire fuel reduction treatments.  These treatments led to significant variations in forest 
structure and initial post-fire recovery even under similar burn severities over the 
landscape matrix, and will most likely affect future forest dynamics on the burn area. 
 
Sampling two years post-fire offers advantages with regard to estimating future 
forest development.  Because it can take several years for trees to die post-wildfire, we 
can be more certain which trees have survived the fire; McHugh and Kolb (2003) 
established that most post-fire mortality of ponderosa pine in northern Arizona occurs by 
two years after the wildfire.  With the passage of two growing seasons since the fire, 
regeneration was well-established, so we have a better estimate of potential future forest 
development. 
 
We were not able to take a complete sample of dead trees, and so did not try to 
reconstruct pre-wildfire forest structure.  Dead trees were salvaged from the burn area 
before we took our field measurements.  We included the dead trees that were measured 
only when calculating bole char height and snag availability for wildlife. 
 
Because we only sampled one burn area and did not treat the Rodeo-Chediski fire 
complex as two separate fires, our study sites are pseudoreplicates, as is common in 
studies of wildfire effects (van Mantgem et al. 2001).  This limits the causal inference 
that can be made from statistically significant differences among treatments and burn 
severities.  Given that suppression effects were limited and that the area sampled was 

 
32
restricted in its slope and elevational range, it does make sense to attribute clear trends 
seen especially in post-fire forest structure with increasing degree of treatment or burn 
severity to the direct effects of treatment and burn severity. 
 
Pre-wildfire treatment effects 
 
 
Recent fuel reduction treatments were consistently associated with a substantial 
reduction in burn severity, based on remotely-sensed data.  This result was in general 
agreement with Finney et al.’s (in press) results for the Rodeo-Chediski fire.  While the 
combination of cutting and prescribed burning had the most ameliorative effect, 
prescribed burning alone also considerably reduced burn severity.  Finney et al. (in press) 
did not include harvesting or thinning in their comparison of treated and untreated areas, 
however, instead combining cut and burned and burn only areas.  This may have led them 
to overestimate the effectiveness of prescribed burning.  For greatest efficacy, we found 
that prescribed burning treatments must have taken place within the eleven years before 
the fire.  This is within the 10- to15-year range of effectiveness estimated by Agee and 
Skinner (2005), and slightly longer than the 9-year period reported by Finney et al. (in 
press).  Finney et al. also used a different burn severity classification, which included an 
unburned category; this may explain some of the dissimilarity in our results. 
 
Our stand-level measurements also showed that fire behavior and effects were 
ameliorated in treated areas, in accordance with Cram and Baker’s (2003) findings on the 
Rodeo-Chediski burn area, and with other studies of wildfire effects in treated vs. 
untreated areas (Pollet and Omi 2002, Omi and Martinson 2002).  Treatment effects on 

 
33
post-fire forest structure increased, rather than diminished, as burn severity increased.  
There were more live trees in treated areas, in both density and basal area.  Untreated 
moderate severity areas had 90% fewer trees than untreated low severity areas, as 
compared to a 66% difference between low and moderate severity cut and burned areas, 
exemplifying the increasing effect of treatment as burn severity increased.  The 
abundance of live trees in the smaller size classes was also greater in treated areas as burn 
severity increased.  Although prescribed burning did not significantly change crown base 
height compared to untreated areas, it appears to have decreased tree density and fuel 
loadings enough to make stands fairly resistant to crownfire, as exemplified by the 
similarity of bole char height in the burn only and cut and burn treatments.  The fire was 
most likely responsible for the increased crown base height in moderate severity areas, 
and may have killed trees rather than merely increasing their crown base height in high 
severity areas.  Crown base height may have been highest in the cut and burn treatment 
because of a higher initial crown base due to thinning. Increasing degree of treatment was 
significantly associated with an increase in the number of live trees and crown base 
height, and a decrease in bole char height. 
 
Future forest development 
 
 
Regeneration two years after the fire is very different from the current and pre-fire 
overstory; oaks are present on nearly the entire study area, and alligator juniper and New 
Mexico locust each occur on about half the study area. 

 
34
The very low regeneration rate of ponderosa pine on untreated areas, especially 
those of high severity, is a particular cause for concern due to the large proportion of 
untreated areas in relation to the study area.  Our results imply that there was virtually no 
pine regeneration on over half of the study area.  Especially worrisome is that 16% of the 
study area had neither ponderosa regeneration nor surviving adult ponderosas to act as 
seed sources.  Treated areas had much more pine regeneration than untreated areas, in 
terms of both density and percent of sites on which regeneration occurred. 
 
The abundance of Fendler’s ceanothus in high-severity areas and the burn only 
treatment, reaching densities in the tens of thousands per hectare, may compete with 
regeneration, thus slowing recovery of the overstory.  However, ceanothus also provides 
excellent wildlife forage, and as a nitrogen fixer, may hasten soil recovery.  Manzanita 
may have constituted a similar percent cover as Fendler’s ceanothus despite its low 
density due to its much larger size, and so may also be inhibiting tree regeneration in 
some areas. 
 
Future growth will most likely be a more evenly balanced mixture of Gambel oak 
and other oaks, juniper, and ponderosa pine, rather than the strongly ponderosa-
dominated forest that existed before the fire.  New Mexico locust will also play a large 
role for at least a few decades.  Savage and Mast (2005) delineated several trajectories 
that extremely dense southwestern ponderosa pine forests have taken after crown fire.  
Five of the ten burn areas they studied either overlapped or were within approx. 100 km 
of the Rodeo-Chediski burn area.  These post-crownfire trajectories include: a return to a 
dense pine forest; a conversion in vegetation type to an alternative state, i.e., an oak 
shrubfield or grassland; or a transition to a ponderosa pine/Gambel oak early successional 

 
35
forest.  They found that these alternative states had persisted for at least fifty years after 
fire.  Moir and Dieterich (1988) proposed a comparable alternative end result of 
succession in ponderosa pine ecosystems, suggesting that in addition to open old-growth 
forests, meadows may also be perpetuated by frequent low-intensity fire.  Since oaks 
were present on nearly the entire study area, a conversion to grassland is doubtful.  Given 
that half the study area does not yet have ponderosa pine regeneration, a type conversion 
away from a ponderosa pine-dominated forest to a shrubfield with oak, locust, manzanita, 
and some juniper is likely, especially on the 16% of the landscape where there was no 
surviving ponderosa pine and no ponderosa regeneration.  On the highest-severity areas, 
recovery even to this shrubfield type will be slow.  Cut and burned areas and the majority 
of the burn only treatment may more quickly recover to a ponderosa pine/Gambel oak 
forest similar to pre-fire conditions, with the balance shifted more in favor of oaks. 
 
Crownfire resistance in the near future appears to still be highest in the cut and 
burn treatment, and also in higher-severity areas of all treatments, based on overall tree 
density and density of small trees, forest floor fuels, and crown base height.  Tree density, 
which is indicative of horizontal fuel loadings and continuity, was lowest in the cut and 
burn treatment, high severity burn-only areas, and moderate and high severity untreated 
areas.  Forest floor fuels did not show a trend with increasing degree of treatment, but 
lessened with increasing burn severity.  Crown base height, which is indicative of vertical 
fuel loadings and continuity, was highest in the cut and burn treatment and in higher-
severity portions of all treatments.  The abundance of the smallest size classes of trees in 
the diameter distribution is representative of ladder fuels; trees of these size classes were 

 
36
least abundant in the cut and burn treatment, high severity burn-only areas, and moderate 
and high severity untreated areas. 
 
Management implications 
 
 
The Rodeo-Chediski fire was undoubtedly extremely destructive, but was not as 
uniformly catastrophic as is often perceived, largely due to the fuel reduction treatments 
that were carried out before the fire.  Yet, the recent treatments  comprised less than a 
quarter of the burn area.  It is a tragedy that while the White Mountain Apache Tribe has 
one of the oldest and most extensive prescribed burning programs in the West, huge 
portions of the burn area still experienced near-complete or complete mortality. 
 
Our results suggest that recent prescribed burning can substantially increase 
crownfire resistance, however.  This has been shown in several previous studies on White 
Mountain Apache Tribal lands over its long history of prescribed fire use (Weaver 1955, 
Kallander 1969, Finney et al., in press), as well as for wildfires occurring in other arid 
coniferous forests (Pollet and Omi 2002, Omi and Martinson 2002).  When used alone, 
prescribed burning would have to be repeated frequently, which may present logistical 
and financial challenges; and, as mentioned earlier, it can be difficult to control and can 
kill many older trees (Sackett and Haase 1998).  This study suggests that mechanical tree 
removal combined with prescribed burning offers the best resistance to catastrophic 
wildfire and subsequent type conversion away from ponderosa pine, even under the most 
extreme fire weather and proximate fire behavior.  Although uneven-aged management 
differs from ecological restoration in many important characteristics, uneven-aged forest 

 
37
management including pre-commercial thinning or restoration to presettlement conditions 
(Covington et al. 2001), combined with prescribed burning, should both reduce overall 
tree density and the number of small trees enough to provide crownfire resistance.  
Similar types of fuel reduction have been recommended by many over the years (Weaver 
1951; Agee and Skinner 2005). 
Ponderosa pine will most likely lose dominance for several decades in most 
portions of the burn area while a thicket of oaks, New Mexico locust, and juniper matures 
and self-thins.  Most treated areas should recover to a ponderosa pine/Gambel oak forest 
without further intervention, but due to very low levels of ponderosa regeneration, it may 
be necessary to do plantings in untreated areas to prevent a conversion to a shrubfield. 
Unless widespread, regularly-applied fuel reduction projects are undertaken, most 
southwestern forests will remain highly susceptible to catastrophic wildfire.  Climate 
change is expected to extend the fire season and possibly increase the number of large 
fires when droughts do occur, via a combination of increased temperature and 
precipitation (Swetnam and Betancourt 1990, Flannigan et al. 2001, McKenzie et al. 
2004).  Once these forests burn, they may take closer to centuries than decades to 
recover, and substantial portions of untreated areas may convert to oak-dominated 
shrubfields.  We may see a great deal of fragmentation of what has been the largest 
contiguous ponderosa pine forest in the United States, with associated loss of timber 
revenue, and ecological effects that are not fully known.  Outlying forests should not be 
completely neglected in favor of wildland/urban interfaces during decisions regarding 
fuel reduction priorities, for ponderosa pine forests face an uncertain future.

Figure 3.2. Comparing the burn severity distribution after the Rodeo-Chediski fire for 
areas treated with prescribed burning over increasing treatment periods indicates that 
1991-2001 is the longest period for which the burn severity distribution is substantially 
different from that of the entire burn area; this is confirmed by a Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
test of the raw ∆NBR distributions for the treatment periods with α= 0.01.  Missing years 
in the sequence are those in which no prescribed burning took place.

compared to untreated areas and the burn area on WMAT lands as a whole.  All pairwise

4. PRE-FIRE TREATMENT EFFECTS AND POST-FIRE FOREST DYNAMICS 
ON THE APACHE-SITGREAVES NATIONAL FOREST WITHIN THE RODEO-
CHEDISKI BURN AREA, ARIZONA 
 
Abstract 
 
 
The 2002 Rodeo-Chediski fire was the largest wildfire in Arizona history, and 
exhibited some of the most extreme fire behavior ever seen in the Southwest.  On the 
portion of the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest within the burn area, pre-fire thinning 
set the stage for a natural experiment testing the upper boundary of effectiveness of fuel 
reduction treatments at decreasing burn severity.  We sampled seven pairs of 
thinned/unthinned stands two years after the fire.  Thinned areas had more live trees, 
higher survival, and less extreme fire behavior as indicated by crown base height and 
bole char height.  Ponderosa pine regeneration was patchily distributed and somewhat 
less abundant in untreated areas.  Our findings strongly indicate that thinning was 
associated with reduced burn severity even in an extraordinarily intense fire.  Differences 
between thinned and untreated areas persisted for several decades after the fire in stand 
structure characteristics and for at least 100 years in species composition when modeled 
using the Forest Vegetation Simulator.  Future forest development will most likely take 
one of two trajectories: recovery to a ponderosa pine/Gambel oak forest or a shift to an 
alternative stable state such as an oak-dominated shrubfield, with untreated areas more 
apt to undergo a shift to a shrubfield state. 
 

 
57
Introduction 
 
There has been extensive empirical research on the long-term recovery of pine-
dominated forests after wildfire (Foxx 1996, Barton 2002, Gracia et al. 2002, Greene et 
al. 2004, Savage and Mast 2005), and a number of studies have also modeled forest 
dynamics after wildfire (He et al. 2002, Retana et al. 2002, Chapin et al. 2003).  Several 
of these long-term studies of forest recovery after wildfire have questioned whether 
forests that historically had a frequent fire regime are resilient to crownfire, adding to the 
widespread concern about future development of arid forests such as those of the 
Southwest as large, severe crownfires continue (Hessburg et al. 2005).  Studies in 
Arizona (Barton 2002), Mexico (Fulé et al. 2000), and Spain (Retana et al. 2002) have 
indicated that intense fire in pine-oak forests may result in a shift to a more oak-
dominated forest or a conversion to an alternative steady state such as a shrubfield.  
These shifts in species dominance and conversions to what appears to be an alternative 
stable state have been documented after crownfire in several dense southwestern 
ponderosa pine forests by Savage and Mast (2005).  Alternative stable states are self-
perpetuating species assemblages distinct from the typical assemblage found in a given 
environment; they may be shorter in height (e.g., shrubs vs. trees) and appear to be an 
earlier sere, though without evidence of near-term shift back toward the pre-crownfire 
forest.  A shift to such an alternative state could have major consequences for ecosystem 
functions and potential land uses; for instance, in the Southwest, some wildlife species 
are ponderosa pine-dependent, and Gambel oak is much less economically valuable than 

 
58
the ponderosa pine it could replace as the dominant tree species (Barger and Ffolliott 
1972, Blatner and Govett 1988, Linhart 1988, Petraitis and Latham 1999). 
Changes in forest structure caused by fire suppression, selective logging of large 
trees, and livestock grazing occurring after extensive EuroAmerican settlement of the 
western U.S. have led to an increase in the size and frequency of crownfires (Covington 
and Moore 1994, Swetnam et al. 1999).  Fuel reduction treatments such as pre-
commercial thinning, prescribed burning, and restoration to presettlement conditions 
have been projected to decrease crownfire susceptibility by decreasing forest floor, ladder 
, and canopy fuels (Deeming 1990, van Wagtendonk 1996, Stephens 1998, Covington et 
al. 2001, Fulé et al. 2001, Brose and Wade 2002).  Numerous short-term studies have 
examined adjacent treated and untreated stands after wildfire, reporting that areas that 
underwent fuel reduction treatments experienced lower burn severity (Wagle and Eakle 
1979, Omi and Kalabokidis 1991, Vihanek and Ottmar 1993, Agee et al. 2000, Martinson 
and Omi 2003).  Pollet and Omi (2002) and Omi and Martinson (2002) systematically 
examined the effect of fuel reduction treatments for eight severe wildfires, both studies 
finding that burn severity and crown scorch were lower in treated areas.  Cram and Baker 
(2003) also systematically investigated silvicultural treatment effect after four wildfires, 
including the Rodeo-Chediski burn area within the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, 
finding that treated areas up to 20 years old experienced lower burn severity and 
estimated fireline intensity.  Pollet and Omi (2002) questioned whether fuel treatments 
will have any effect under extreme fire conditions, since drought and high winds may 
play a more important role in fire behavior than fuels.   By decreasing burn severity and 

 
59
thus preventing long-term forest change, fuel reduction treatments can potentially have 
enduring impacts (Savage and Mast 2005).  
 
Because of its extreme fire behavior, which included multiple plume collapses per 
day, flame lengths of 60-120 m (200-400 ft), and a maximum rate of spread of 6.4 
km/hour (4 mph; USFS 2002), the Rodeo-Chediski fire can serve as a test case of the 
upper boundary of response to fuel treatments.  In addition, little research has been done 
investigating the effect of fuel reduction treatments on burn severity and projected future 
growth, including potential shifts to an alternative stable state, across treated and 
untreated areas.  Our hypotheses were that in an extraordinarily intense fire (a) pre-
wildfire thinning led to lower burn severity than in untreated areas; (b) post-fire 
regeneration and shrubs, and thus potential forest development, differs on thinned and 
untreated areas; (c) differences in post-fire recovery of thinned and untreated areas will 
persist for several decades following the fire as projected by a vegetation simulation 
model; and (d) untreated areas are more likely to transition from the pre-fire ponderosa 
pine forest to an oak-dominated shrubfield. 
 
Methods 
 
Study Area 
 
The Rodeo-Chediski burn area’s 189,000 hectares (468,000 acres) span the 
Mogollon Rim in east-central Arizona.  This study focused on the portion of the burn area 
on the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, to the north of the Mogollon Rim.  July 

 
60
maximum temperature is 29.2ºC (84.5ºF), January minimum temperature is -7.8ºC 
(17.9ºF), annual precipitation is 50.6 cm (19.9 in), and annual snowfall is 99.3 cm (39.1 
in); these are 1971-2000 averages (excepting snowfall, a 1950-2004 average) from the 
Heber Ranger Station on the northwestern edge of the burn area (Western Regional 
Climate Center, www.wrcc.dri.edu).  The study sites ranged in elevation from 1990 – 
2138 m (6,530 – 7,015 ft).  The soil type varies from clay substrates to sandy loams, 
depending on the parent material; alluvial gravels are present in drainages, and the 
Mogollon Rim itself has a limestone bed.  Forests were dominated by ponderosa pine 
(Pinus ponderosa) with Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii), alligator juniper (Juniperus 
deppeana) and New Mexico locust (Robinia neomexicana). 
 
Study Sites 
 
Seven pairs of thinned and unthinned stands were sampled on the Apache-
Sitgreaves National Forest in May-August of 2004 (Figure 1).  Six of these pairs and one 
unpaired thinned site were pre-existing sites sampled immediately post-fire by the Forest 
Service (USFS 2002, L. Wadleigh and C. Hoffman, pers. comm 2003).  A seventh 
unthinned site was located near the pre-existing unpaired thinned site.  Thinned sites 
underwent pre-commercial thinning followed by slash disposal (varying from lop and 
scatter to pile and burn) as part of commercial timber operations between 1990 and 1999.  
Two systematic grids of five plots each were established on each study site, for a total of 
ten plots per site; 140 plots in total were measured across the entire study area.  These 
plots did not correspond exactly to those sampled by the Forest Service, but the areas 
sampled were roughly equivalent.  Plots were located using a Garmin GPS 12 with ten-

 
61
meter resolution.  If the original location of a plot fell on a slope of greater than 45%, the 
plot center was moved to the nearest area where the majority of the plot would be less 
than 45% slope.  The slope constraint ensured that we would not be comparing treatable 
slopes to areas that could not have feasibly been treated because they were on 
unworkably steep slopes. 
 
Measurements 
 
 
Overstory trees were measured on a variable-radius plot using a prism with a BAF 
of approximately 2.2 m2/hectare per tree (10 ft2/acre per tree).  Tree measurements 
included: tree species, condition, diameter at breast height (~1.4m), total height, canopy 
base height, bole char height (minimum and maximum), and dwarf mistletoe rating 
(Hawksworth 1977).   Tree condition classes followed Thomas’ (1979) description and 
included: live, declining, and four stages of snags (recent snag, loose-bark snag, clean 
snag, and snag broken above breast height).  Since field measurements were taken two 
years after the fire, we did not attempt to estimate foliage scorch, as the majority of 
scorched needles had already fallen from the trees.  A subsample of trees (the live 
specimens of the first four trees on the plot; trees were numbered starting at north and 
proceeding clockwise around the plot) were cored in order to produce age and growth 
increment data.  Tree increment cores were surfaced and crossdated (Stokes and Smiley, 
1968) following standard methods or rings were counted for cores that could not be 
crossdated, e.g., some junipers.  For cores that missed the pith, additional years to the 

 
62
center were estimated with a pith locator (Applequist 1958).  Ten-year diameter growth 
increments were measured (1994-2003, inclusive). 
Tree regeneration (saplings and seedlings below breast height) and shrubs were 
measured on a 40.5 m2, 3.6 m radius plot (1/100 acre) with origin at plot center.  Tree 
regeneration and shrubs were tallied by species, condition (living or dead), and height 
class (0-40 cm, 41-80 cm, 81-137 cm, or exact height if > 137 cm).  We measured forest 
floor fuels on a 15.24-meter (50-foot) planar transect at a random azimuth from each plot 
center, using Brown’s (1974) method.  Coefficients for planar transect calculations are 
from Sackett (1980).  Coefficients used to convert litter and duff depth to forest floor fuel 
loadings in megagrams/hectare are from Ffolliott et al.’s (1968) measurements of forest 
floor weight in northern Arizona ponderosa pine stands. 
We took two photographs of each plot: a hemispherical photo using a digital 
camera with a 180º fisheye lens (Nikon CoolPix E4300 using FC-E8 Fisheye Converter 
Lens with UR-E4 Converter Adapter) at plot center in order to record canopy cover, and 
a plot photograph using a standard lens (Canon PowerShot A70) from 12 m east of plot 
center.  Hemispherical photos were analyzed with Gap Light Analyzer (Institute of 
Ecosystem Studies 1999) in order to determine forest canopy structure and gap light 
transmission indices.  An iron rebar stake was sunk to ground level at each plot center 
and tagged with the plot number as a permanent marker.

Modeling 
 
We used the Central Rockies/Southwestern Ponderosa Pine variant of the Forest 
Vegetation Simulator (FVS), an individual-tree growth and yield statistical model (Dixon 
2003) to project future growth on thinned and untreated sites.  FVS is initialized with 
standard mensurational data, and outputs both stand-level and tree-level growth data 
which can be analyzed by species.  FVS can be quite accurate over relatively short 
simulations especially due to its tailoring to specific ecosystems; this variant was based 
on the GENGYM model (Edminster et al. 1991) and is customized such that its projected 
results are in accordance with known stand dynamics of the area. 
FVS was used to simulate stand development for each thinned and untreated site 
for the next 100 years (2004-2104).  Ten-year growth increments were used to scale the 
diameter increment model, and the site index was reduced from the default of 21.4 m/100 
years (70 ft/100 years) to 15.2 m/100 years (50 ft/100 years) to correspond with 
height/age relationships developed using our core data.  All oaks were treated as Gambel 
oak, all junipers were treated as a generic juniper species, all pines were treated as 
ponderosa pine and New Mexico locust was treated as a generic hardwood species for the 
purposes of the simulation. 
We compared two regeneration scenarios: 
Regen-1: Establishing the measured regeneration in 2004, with no further 
regeneration established over the course of the simulation; and  
Regen-2: Establishing the measured regeneration in 2004, and in 2024, 
establishing the measured regeneration scaled by regeneration occurring 2-3 decades

following crownfire in southwestern ponderosa pine forests as reported by Savage and 
Mast (2005).  Five of the ten burn areas they studied either overlapped or were within 
approx. 100 km of the Rodeo-Chediski burn area; these included three of the four burn 
areas they measured 2-3 decades post-fire.  Juniper regeneration was decreased by a 
factor of 0.15 so that our average juniper abundance matched that of Savage and Mast, 
and oak regeneration was similarly decreased by a factor of 0.65.  Since the range in 
abundance of New Mexico locust on our study sites was similar to that reported by 
Savage and Mast, we did not alter regeneration density for that species.  It would have 
been necessary to increase our measured ponderosa regeneration by a factor of 28 to 
reach Savage and Mast’s average, and we did not believe such a large increase was 
justifiable.  Instead, ponderosa pine density was tripled, and on sites where there were 
less than 50 stems/ha of the smallest height class, 150 stems/ha were introduced.  This 
did not increase ponderosa pine regeneration density established in 2024 to a level 
equivalent with the average reported by Savage and Mast (approx. 950 stems/ha), but it 
fell within the range they reported (an overall average of 212 stems/ha, compared with 
their range of 117-2864 stems/hectare). 
Expected survival percentages for each species and height class for both 
regeneration scenarios were estimated using regeneration measured in untreated areas of 
two northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests (Fulé et al. 2001, Waltz et al. 2003).  For 
each species, the abundance of individuals of the tallest height class relative to the 
abundance of individuals of a shorter height class was used as an estimate of the survival 
rate for individuals of the shorter height class.  Ponderosa pine survival was 100% for all 

 
65
height classes, oak survival ranged from 9-45%, juniper survival ranged from 19-67%, 
and New Mexico locust survival ranged from 65-72%. 
 
Data Analysis 
 
 
While our post-fire data were parametric, inspection of the measurement 
distributions using frequency histograms, the Shapiro-Wilkes W statistic, and Levene’s 
test revealed that only a few measurements were both normally distributed and had equal 
variances.  We used DISTLM (Anderson 2004), which performs a distribution-free, 
distance-based multifactor multivariate analysis of variance using permutation.  We 
carried out 999 permutations for each test, and used the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity distance 
measure for each test.  The alpha used to denote a significant difference was 0.05.  Since 
the method used by DISTLM calculates an exact p-value, it has been argued that it is not 
subject to alpha inflation (Anderson 2001, Anderson and Robinson 2001).  When testing 
overall regeneration and shrubs, we performed both an unstandardized test and a test 
standardized by species, in case the dominant species were skewing the results. 
We used 95% confidence intervals to discern meaningful differences between 
modeling results for thinned and untreated areas, and between the two regeneration 
scenarios.

Results 
 
 
The burn area was dominated by ponderosa pine, though Gambel oak and 
alligator juniper were also common in the overstory (Table 4.1).  Pinemat manzanita 
(Arctostaphylos pungens) and Fendler’s ceanothus (Ceanothus fendleri) were by far the 
most abundant shrubs (Table 4.2). 
 
Pre- and post-fire forest structure 
 
 
Thinned areas were associated with lower burn severity when compared to 
untreated areas.  Pre-fire forest structure in thinned and untreated areas was not 
significantly different according to the characteristics we tested, but post-fire conditions 
were very different (Table 4.3).  There were many more surviving trees in thinned areas, 
and fire behavior was less extreme than in untreated areas as indicated by bole char 
height. 
 
About half the trees in thinned areas survived the fire, compared to five percent in 
untreated areas (Figure 4.2a).  Post-fire density of live trees was significantly higher in 
thinned areas.  While average tree density was greater in untreated areas before the fire, 
there was no significant difference between thinned and untreated areas.  At least some 
trees survived on all of the study sites, but 39% of the plots (10 plots per study site) had 
no live trees; by treatment, this was 66% of untreated plots and 11% of thinned plots.  
Basal area of live trees was similar before the fire, but was significantly higher in thinned 
areas afterwards (Figure 4.2b).  Quadratic mean diameter before the fire was 14 cm in 

 
67
untreated areas and 18.5 cm in thinned areas.  After the fire, quadratic mean diameter 
increased to 25 cm in untreated areas and 22 cm in thinned areas. 
 
Crown base height and bole char height for live trees and for all trees was 
significantly lower in thinned areas, indicating less extreme fire behavior (Figure 4.2c).  
Bole char height for all trees was much higher than bole char for live trees and somewhat 
higher than crown base height in untreated areas, probably indicating that most trees that 
survived were in pockets of lower than average fire intensity.  The fire probably did not 
increase crown base height in thinned areas, since crown base height was substantially 
higher than bole char height for all trees.  It appears to have done so in untreated areas, 
especially since crown base height there was higher than in thinned areas. 
 
Diameter distribution before the fire was not significantly different between 
treatments, though on average there were more small trees in untreated areas (Figure 
4.2d).  The fire shifted the distribution in untreated areas strongly towards larger trees, 
but did not substantially change the shape of the distribution in thinned.  About 95% of 
the surviving trees in both thinned and untreated areas were less than 100 years old, 
though thinned areas may have had slightly more old trees (Figure 4.2e).  Many more 
standing snags were present in untreated areas of two common size classes used by 
wildlife (>30 cm DBH and >50 cm DBH; Figure 4.2f). 
 
Initial post-fire recovery 
 
 
Initial post-fire recovery as denoted by fuel loadings, regeneration, and shrubs 
was more similar across thinned and untreated areas than post-fire forest structure.  Only 

 
68
fuel loadings and manzanita density were significantly different.  Fuel loadings were 
significantly higher in thinned areas (Figure 4.3a).  This difference was apparent in fine 
and coarse woody debris as well as forest floor weight 
 
Regeneration was dominated by sprouting species such as Gambel oak and 
alligator juniper, as well as by New Mexico locust (Figure 4.3b).  Regeneration levels 
were not significantly different between thinned and untreated areas, but on average were 
slightly higher in untreated areas.  Regeneration was present on every study site and 86% 
of the plots.  Oak regeneration was present on all study sites and 68% of the plots. 
There was no significant difference in ponderosa pine regeneration between 
treatments because of its patchiness, but on average, there was four times as much 
ponderosa pine regeneration in thinned areas (Figure 4.3c).  Ponderosa pine regeneration 
was found on only six percent of our plots; at the site level, eight of 14 sites (5 untreated, 
3 thinned) had no ponderosa regeneration.  In both thinned and untreated areas, small 
amounts of ponderosa regeneration in the larger height classes may have survived the 
fire.  Live ponderosa trees were present on all sites, but 41% of the plots (67% untreated, 
14% thinned) had no surviving ponderosa pine trees.  Thirty-eight percent of the plots 
had no surviving ponderosa pines and no ponderosa pine regeneration; by treatment, this 
was 64% of untreated plots and 11% of thinned plots. 
 
Pinemat manzanita and Fendler’s ceanothus were virtually the only shrubs present 
(Figure 4.3d).  While overall, shrubs were not significantly different on thinned versus 
untreated areas, manzanita was twenty times more abundant in untreated areas than 
thinned areas (p = 0.043),.  We thought it worthwhile to investigate whether manzanita 
may have been competing with ponderosa pine regeneration.  Manzanita was recorded on 

 
69
18 and ponderosa pine regeneration on nine of 140 plots; they were only found together 
on one plot.  However, this is not a conclusive finding because the number of plots on 
which either species was found was so low.. 
 
Modeling 
 
 
Differences between thinned and unthinned areas will likely persist for at least the 
next several decades in terms of overall forest structure characteristics as indicated by our 
modeling of future forest development using FVS, though variability was high as 
indicated by 95% confidence intervals.  Initial differences in relative species abundance 
and dominance endured, if not increased, over the 100-year simulation period. 
 
Thinned areas initially had more trees, but since untreated areas had more 
regeneration, they quickly became denser; this difference slowly declined over the course 
of the simulation (Figure 4.4a).  All treatment/regeneration combinations led to some 
self-thinning, but Regen-2 (scheduling measured regeneration in 2004 and adjusted 
regeneration in 2024) in untreated areas led to an especially high density and a 
correspondingly steep decline.  After 100 years, thinned and untreated areas were nearly 
identical, but density under Regen-2 remained higher than that under Regen-1 
(scheduling measured regeneration only in 2004).  Confidence intervals overlapped for 
the entire simulation, indicating high plot-to-plot variability.  Thinned areas had 
significantly greater basal area for at least four decades (Figure 4.4b).  After 100 years, 
basal area was very similar under all treatment/regeneration combinations. 

 
70
 
Trees in untreated areas were larger on average immediately post-fire due to high 
mortality of small trees compared to thinned areas (Figure 4.4c).   Because of slightly 
higher regeneration in untreated areas, average tree diameter soon dropped below that of 
thinned areas.  As with tree density, this difference lessened over time, and by the end of 
the simulation thinned and untreated areas were nearly the same, with a slightly larger 
average diameter under Regen-1. 
 
In both thinned and untreated areas, an open forest with some surviving 
ponderosa pines and a few survivors of other species quickly gives way to a thicket of 
oaks, junipers, and New Mexico locust, with the occasional remnant ponderosa pine 
(Figure 4.5).  Ponderosa pines become a much smaller component of the ecosystem in 
untreated areas with regard to density (Figures 4.5a-b).  Ponderosa pines constutite  about 
five percent of total density under Regen-1 and 10% under Regen-2.  In thinned areas, 
about a quarter of the trees are ponderosa pines after the 2004 regeneration becomes 
established, and this proportion remains stable over time (Figures 4.5c-d).  Thinned areas 
also have many more ponderosa pines than untreated areas in absolute numbers.  Two of 
the seven untreated sites had only 21 and 26 ponderosa pines/hectare by the end under 
Regen-1.  The relative density of New Mexico locust declines slowly, from 15-30% at its 
maximum to 10-18% after 100 years.  The proportion of oaks increases slightly over 
time.  About half the trees are oaks in untreated areas, and 35% in thinned areas.  The 
proportion of junipers is roughly the same in all treatment/regeneration combinations 
(~25%) and remains steady over the course of the simulation. 
 
The difference in basal area between thinned and untreated areas increases over 
time, and there is very little difference between the regeneration scenarios (Figure 4.6).  

 
71
Ponderosa pine initially makes up all the basal area in untreated areas, but after four 
decades, thinned areas have proportionally more ponderosa pine.  After 100 years, 
thinned areas are about 60% ponderosa pine, while untreated areas are down to 35%.  
There appears to be a reciprocal relationship between oaks and pine; given this difference 
in ponderosa pine basal area between treatments, oaks are largely responsible for the 
similarity in total basal area between thinned and untreated areas by the end of the 
simulation.  In thinned areas, oaks originally constitute about five percent and are never 
higher than 20% of the total basal area, whereas in untreated areas they comprise 40% of 
the total basal area after 100 years. 
 
 
Discussion 
 
 
Despite displaying some of the most extreme fire behavior ever observed in the 
Southwest (USFS 2002), the Rodeo-Chediski fire still decreased in severity in areas that 
underwent fuel reduction treatments within approximately twelve years before the fire.  
Thinned areas were significantly different from untreated areas in post-fire forest 
structure, including density, basal area, and diameter distribution.  Thinned areas were 
also significantly different from untreated areas in  some attributes of initial post-fire 
recovery, including fuel loadings and manzanita density.  We expect future forest 
development to differ as well, especially in terms of dominance by ponderosa pine. 
 
Sampling two years post-wildfire allows us to estimate future forest development 
more accurately.  McHugh and Kolb (2003) ascertained that most mortality after wildfire 

 
72
in northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests occurs within the first two years, so our 
measurements of survival should be reliable.  Regeneration was well-established after the 
passage of two growing seasons, at least for sprouting species, so our projections of 
future growth are based on more complete data than could be gathered very soon after the 
fire. 
 
Because we used variable-radius plots, we do not have a complete sample of trees 
that had already fallen after being killed by the fire.  Fallen trees were included in fuel 
loadings, since they could be recorded on the planar fuel transect.  Our calculations of 
pre-fire forest structure are therefore an underestimate.  However, because we rarely 
encountered already-fallen trees in the study area, we believe our estimates to be largely 
accurate. 
 
Pre-wildfire treatment effects 
 
 
Thinned areas experienced much less extreme fire behavior and effects than 
untreated areas.  This is in accordance with previous studies indicating the effectiveness 
of fuel reduction treatments at reducing wildfire severity (Martinson and Omi 2003, 
Finney et al., in press).  Overstory survival was far higher in thinned areas, where half the 
trees survived compared to five percent in untreated areas.  After the fire, basal area and 
density of live trees was higher in thinned areas, and the diameter distribution did not 
substantially change shape in thinned areas as compared to untreated areas.  Some 
portions of thinned as well as untreated areas still experienced complete overstory 
mortality, but this was limited to 11% of thinned plots as opposed to 66% of untreated 

 
73
plots.  The fire raised crown base height in untreated areas, but not in most portions of 
thinned areas.  While the characteristics we tested did not indicate that pre-fire forest 
structure on thinned and untreated sites was significantly different, average overall tree 
density and density of small trees on untreated sites was higher than on thinned sites. 
When compared to the treatments tested by Pollet and Omi (2002), our estimate 
of differences in pre-fire forest structure between thinned and untreated areas is within 
the range of treatments they also found effective.  Our untreated sites were 1.7 times 
denser than our thinned sites; the untreated sites they studied had between 1.4 and 8.7 
times more trees than their treated sites.  Pre-fire total basal area was nearly identical on 
our thinned and unthinned sites, which Pollet and Omi (2002) also found to be the case 
on two of the four wildfires they sampled.  Finney et al. (in press) obtained similar results 
for treatment effect on burn severity via an analysis of treatment areas and satellite-
measured burn severity (∆NBR).  While they only investigated the effect of prescribed 
burning treatments on the burn severity of the Rodeo-Chediski fire, it should be noted 
that they did not exclude areas which had also received silvicultural treatments such as 
pre-commercial thinning from their analysis. 
 
Future forest development 
 
 
Regeneration two years after the fire was strongly dominated by Gambel oak, 
alligator juniper, and New Mexico locust, making it very different from the ponderosa 
pine-dominated, pre-fire and post-fire overstory.  Overall regeneration levels were 
slightly, but not significantly, higher on untreated sites.  Ponderosa regeneration was four 

 
74
times higher in thinned areas, but it was very patchily distributed; ponderosa regeneration 
was found on only six percent of all plots.  Manzanita and Fendler’s ceanothus were 
common across all study sites, but manzanita was twenty times more abundant on 
untreated sites, to the point that it may be inhibiting regeneration. 
 
Our modeling results indicate that thinned areas may have fewer and larger trees 
and higher basal area than untreated areas for the next several decades.  Both thinned and 
untreated sites became a thicket of young oaks, junipers, and New Mexico locust, with 
both remnant and young ponderosa pines more common on thinned sites but still not 
comprising more than a quarter of all trees.  Despite no significant difference in 
regeneration measured in 2004 between thinned and untreated sites, the slightly higher 
average regeneration levels on untreated sites may have led to their greater tree density 
over the course of the simulation, especially under the second regeneration scenario.  
Ponderosa pines still constituted the majority of basal area in thinned areas after 100 
years, but accounted for only 35% of total basal area in untreated areas.  The proportion 
of oaks in both density and basal area increased over time in thinned and untreated areas. 
Savage and Mast (2005) delineated several trajectories southwestern ponderosa 
pine forests have taken after crownfire.  These included a return to a dense pine forest, 
recovery to an early-successional ponderosa pine/Gambel oak forest, or a type conversion 
into a grassland or oak/manzanita shrubfield.  Moir and Dieterich (1988) proposed a 
similar alternative outcome of the successional process for ponderosa pine ecosystems, in 
that meadows as well as open old-growth forests might be perpetuated by frequent low-
intensity fire.  There is also preliminary evidence of a post-crownfire transition of a 
pine/oak forest in southeastern Arizona to an oak woodland (Barton 2002).  Since some 

 
75
regeneration was present on every site and 86% of the plots, conversion to grassland is 
unlikely.  Sixty-four percent of untreated and 11% of thinned plots had no surviving 
pines and no ponderosa regeneration; conversion to an oak/manzanita shrubfield may 
occur in these areas.  In both thinned and untreated areas, future growth will in general be 
a more balanced combination of oaks, junipers, pines, and New Mexico locust, rather 
than the strongly ponderosa-dominated, pre-wildfire forest. 
Climate change is projected to accelerate shifts in vegetational states caused by 
fire.  Average temperature and precipitation are both expected to increase in the western 
U.S. and Canada as a result of global climate change.  This change is expected to extend 
the fire season, increasing both fire frequency and total area burned because of the 
increase in amplitude and duration of extreme fire weather.  In the Southwest, large fires 
are sometimes associated with a current-year drought after several years of above-
average precipitation, so higher average precipitation may increase the number of very 
large fires (Swetnam and Betancourt 1990, Grissino-Mayer and Swetnam 2000, 
McKenzie et al. 2004).  This effect of climate change on fire regimes may indirectly 
hasten vegetation shifts more than the direct effect of climate change itself on vegetation.  
Burn areas offer sites for migrating species to colonize, and increased fire size and 
frequency will decrease the habitat available to late-successional species and increase 
fragmentation (Flannigan et al. 2001, McKenzie et al. 2004). 
 
It is uncertain how long an altered successional trajectory such as an 
oak/manzanita shrubfield may persist, and what stage might occur next.  Savage and 
Mast (2005) found that these conditions could persist for at least five decades, and 
pointed out that these type conversions may be self-perpetuating if the area repeatedly 

 
76
experiences intense fire.  On the other hand, a shrubfield near an area with surviving 
pines may eventually revert to a ponderosa pine forest.  Our results indicate that this may 
be the case for most of the burn area; while 38% of the plots overall had no surviving 
ponderosa pine trees and no ponderosa pine regeneration, this was not the case for any of 
the study sites (10 plots per study site), so shrubfields will probably be patchily 
distributed.  Even if these areas ultimately become ponderosa pine forests again, the 
recovery process will most likely take centuries rather than decades.  Savage and Mast 
(2005) observed this patchy shrubfield/forest state fifty years after the 1950 Faught Ridge 
fire, very close to the Rodeo-Chediski burn area.  During the interim, ponderosa pine 
forests on the burn area will be fragmented and considerably reduced in total size.  
 
Management implications 
 
 
The Rodeo-Chediski fire was not as completely disastrous as is often believed, 
largely because of the fuel reduction treatments that took place before the fire.  These 
treatments comprised only a small portion of the burn area, however. 
 
Ponderosa pine will lose dominance for the next several decades to centuries over 
a considerable proportion of the burn area, to be replaced by a matrix of oak/manzanita 
shrubfields and thickets of oaks, junipers, and New Mexico locust with the occasional 
remnant ponderosa pine.  Most thinned areas should recover to a ponderosa pine/Gambel 
oak forest relatively quickly, but because of sparse ponderosa regeneration, it may be 
necessary to do plantings, especially in untreated areas. 

 
77
 
Most southwestern forests are currently at high risk of severe crownfire; unless 
extensive fuel reduction treatments are undertaken in the near future, these forests will 
experience intense fires after which recovery will be extremely slow.  The completely 
unintended effect of fire suppression, overgrazing, and conventional timber management 
focusing on the harvesting of large trees may be the increasing fragmentation of the 
largest contiguous ponderosa pine forest in the United States by landscape-scale fires 
such as the Rodeo-Chediski, with resultant long-term soil damage (Viro 1974), loss of 
timber revenue, and ecological and social effects that are not yet entirely known.  Climate 
change is forecasted to accelerate these shifts (McKenzie et al. 2004). 
 
In 1951, Weaver recommended thinning of small-diameter trees and the use of 
prescribed fire to improve forest health and prevent catastrophic wildfire in ponderosa 
pine forests.  Forest management involving fuel reduction treatments now also 
recommended by many others (Agee and Skinner 2005), such as regular pre-commercial 
thinning including slash treatment, prescribed burning, and the combination of thinning 
and prescribed burning, should provide the best protection against severe crownfire and 
ensuing conversion away from ponderosa-dominated forests.  Restoration to 
presettlement conditions (Covington et al. 2001) may also offer additional benefits for 
native species.  While fuel reduction treatments within the wildland/urban interface 
should continue to be our first priority, we ought not to allow more distant forests to 
remain in jeopardy.

5. DISCUSSION 
 
The individual manuscript chapters (3 and 4) included discussions of the results 
and management implications of each study.  This final chapter presents comparisons 
between the study areas on the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest and White Mountain 
Apache Tribal lands, overall management implications, and future directions for research. 
 
I. Differences and Parallels 
 
 
Pre-fire fuel reduction treatments significantly reduced burn severity on both the 
Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest (A-S) and the White Mountain Apache Tribal lands 
(WMAT).  The combination of timber harvesting including pre-commercial thinning and 
prescribed burning had the greatest ameliorative effect on burn severity.  Prescribed 
burning alone also considerably reduced burn severity, provided that it took place within 
the decade before the fire.  This is in accordance with previous studies indicating the 
effectiveness of fuel reduction treatments at reducing wildfire severity, including the 
effectiveness of recent prescribed burning alone (Martinson and Omi 2003). 
 
Treated areas had more live trees, in terms of percent survival (calculated for the 
A-S only), density, and basal area.  These areas also experienced less extreme fire 
behavior, as indicated by bole char height.  After the wildfire, there were more live trees 
overall on the WMAT than on the A-S in untreated areas, but similar numbers in treated 
areas.  Untreated areas on the A-S had 63 trees/hectare, as opposed to 170 trees/hectare 
on the untreated portions of the WMAT (averaging across all severities).  Thinned areas 

 
98
on the A-S had 331 trees/hectare, comparable to the 396 trees/hectare in burn only areas 
and 305 trees/hectare in the cut and burned areas of the WMAT.  The difference was 
strongest in terms of smaller trees, which may reflect the effects of BDq-based uneven-
aged management on the WMAT as compared to the even-aged management in common 
use on the A-S. 
 
The WMAT study area was more diverse than the A-S; we found twenty tree and 
eleven shrub species on the WMAT, compared to nine tree and four shrub species on the 
A-S.  This may be partially explained by the larger number of plots sampled on the 
WMAT (444 plots vs. 140 plots on the A-S), but is probably still a meaningful difference 
given the greater topographical variation of the WMAT study area and its wider 
elevational range.  The A-S study sites ranged in elevation from 1990 – 2138 m, while 
WMAT study sites ranged from 2000 – 2293 m.  Thus, our WMAT results may be 
applicable to a wider variety of ponderosa pine habitat types. 
 
Regeneration across both study areas was dominated by sprouting species such as 
oaks and junipers, as well as by New Mexico locust.  Ponderosa pine regeneration was 
sparse to nonexistent in untreated areas, common in treated areas, and patchily distributed 
in general.   Untreated areas of the A-S and WMAT had similar amounts of ponderosa 
regeneration, but treated areas of the WMAT had much more than the A-S.  Untreated 
portions of the A-S had 14 stems/hectare, comparable to 21 stems/hectare on the WMAT.  
Thinned areas of the A-S had 53 stems/hectare, while the treated areas of the WMAT had 
nearly an order of magnitude more: 228 stems/hectare in burn only areas, and 457 
stems/hectare in cut and burned areas.  This result is probably due to the larger number of 
trees surviving on the WMAT to act as seed sources. 

 
99
 
Fendler’s ceanothus (Ceanothus fendleri) was common in both study areas but, 
like ponderosa pine regeneration, was nearly an order of magnitude more abundant on the 
WMAT.  Untreated and thinned areas of the A-S had approximately 500 and 700 
stems/hectare, respectively.  Untreated, burn only, and cut and burned areas of the 
WMAT had twelve, twenty, and nine thousand stems/hectare, respectively.  Fendler’s 
ceanothus appeared to respond strongly to prescribed burning on the WMAT; along with 
other inherent differences between the study areas, the more widespread use of prescribed 
burning on the WMAT may explain its greater abundance there. 
Pinemat manzanita (Arctostaphylos pungens) was also common in both study 
areas.  It was more common in untreated areas on both the A-S and the WMAT, and 
more abundant in treated areas of the WMAT than of the A-S.  It was twenty times more 
abundant on untreated A-S sites (3900 stems/ha) than on treated sites (175 stems/ha), to 
the point that it may be competing with tree regeneration.  Its distribution was more 
uniform on the WMAT.  There were 840 stems/hectare in untreated areas, and about 320 
stems/hectare in both burn only and cut and burned areas.  Because the environment of 
the WMAT is more diverse in terms of elevation and topography, the greater variation in 
manzanita abundance on the A-S might be due to another environmental factor such as 
soils, or to less uniformity in the treatment history. 
A detailed comparison of forest recovery for the two studies is difficult, because 
we do not have the spatial data necessary to expand the A-S results to the landscape level, 
did not design the A-S study to compare treatments across a range of burn severities, and 
have not yet modeled future growth on the WMAT.  Both indicate that portions of the 
study area with few surviving ponderosa pine trees and little to no ponderosa pine 

 
100
regeneration may transition to an oak/manzanita shrubfield, in accordance with the 
findings of Savage and Mast (2005).  Ponderosa pine may lose dominance in untreated 
areas of the WMAT and A-S, perhaps for well over a century.  Because of the substantial 
difference in ponderosa pine regeneration between the WMAT and the A-S, it is 
somewhat doubtful that the WMAT findings can appropriately be extrapolated to the A-
S.  However, they do indicate that higher-severity thinned areas of the A-S may have 
sufficient regeneration for a ponderosa pine forest to become reestablished even with low 
numbers of mature ponderosas. 
 
II. Ecosystem management implications and future directions 
 
 
If the trend of increasing size and frequency of crownfires in ponderosa pine 
forests continues, as is likely (Agee and Skinner 2005), much of the Southwest may soon 
resemble the Rodeo-Chediski burn area.  Our results strongly indicate that although the 
fire was extremely severe, areas with fuel reduction treatments had considerably lower 
burn severity and should recover to ponderosa pine-dominated forests relatively soon.  
Some portions of untreated areas may transition to self-perpetuating shrubfields, an 
unintended consequence with social, economic, and ecological effects that are not yet 
fully known. 
 
The period before the Rodeo-Chediski fire during which the fuel reduction 
treatments we studied took place was similar for both studies: 1991 and later for the 
White Mountain Apache Tribal lands, and 1990 and later for the Apache-Sitgreaves 
National Forest.  This treatment period of 10-11 years was effective at reducing burn 

 
101
severity.  These fuel reduction treatments generally did not stop the advancement of the 
fire, but some treated areas did appear to did slow the fire’s advancement, change its 
direction, and protect some adjacent untreated areas (Finney et al., in press). 
 
Fuel reduction treatments can change fire behavior and effects even under the 
most extreme conditions.  The WMAT study indicated that the post-fire differences 
among treatments became more pronounced as burn severity increased.  While fuel 
reduction treatments may be expensive, especially at the frequency that our results 
demonstrated may be necessary, they have a substantial effect on the sustainability of 
ponderosa pine forests, and are far cheaper than fire suppression and rehabilitation. 
 
We plan to model future forest development on the White Mountain Apache 
Tribal lands using FVS, with methods similar to those used for the Apache-Sitgreaves 
study.  While our model results for the A-S study indicated that shifts in species 
composition may persist for at least 100 years especially in untreated areas, we did not 
subject the sites to any further treatment or other disturbance during the simulation 
period.  It would be informative to test whether the alternative states potentially resulting 
from the Rodeo-Chediski fire might in fact be self-perpetuating, as suggested by Savage 
and Mast (2005), by using a model incorporating stochastic fire regimes such as 
FIRESUM (Keane et al. 1989, 1990).  It would also be instructive to model future growth 
on the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest and the White Mountain Apache Tribal lands 
across a range of climate change scenarios, and assess differences in carbon sequestration 
across treated and untreated areas.

7. APPENDIX 
 
As mentioned in the Discussion of Chapter 4, we did not attempt to reconstruct 
pre-fire forest structure for the study on White Mountain Apache Tribal lands because we 
did not have a full sample of dead trees.  I include data for the dead trees we measured in 
this appendix, with the caveat that since we did not have a full sample, these results are 
an underestimate. 
I also include data on canopy cover for both the White Mountain Apache Tribal 
lands and Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest studies.  These data were produced using 
Gap Light Analyzer (Institute of Ecosystem Studies 1999) on hemispherical photographs 
taken with a 180º fisheye lens at each plot center.
