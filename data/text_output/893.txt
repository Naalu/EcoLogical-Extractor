Summary
1. Predicting restoration outcomes requires an understanding of the natural variability of
ecosystem properties. A hierarchy of predictability has been proposed that ranks measures of
restoration success from most-to-least predictable in the following order: vegetation structure
> taxonomic diversity > functional diversity > taxonomic composition. This hierarchy has not
been tested empirically, and the location within the hierarchy of trait-based measures, such as
community-level trait means and variances, is not well understood.
2. Our objective was to test the hierarchy of predictability in one of the longest running ecologi-
cal restoration experiments in the western USA. We used linear mixed effects models to analyse
changes in herbaceous biomass, species richness, two functional diversity (FD) indices, commu-
nity-weighted mean (CWM) traits and taxonomic composition among experimental restoration
treatments from 1992 to 2014 in a ponderosa pine-bunchgrass ecosystem. Restoration treat-
ments included combinations of light or heavy tree thinning and no ﬁre or repeated prescribed
ﬁre every 4 years to release the herbaceous understorey from overstorey competition.
3. Herbaceous biomass and species richness were the two most predictable and least variable
measures of success, whereas taxonomic composition exhibited the highest variability among
plots through time. Trait-based measures of FD tended to be more predictable and less vari-
able than CWM trait values in this experiment. Both CWM trait values and FD were less
variable among plots than taxonomic composition.
4. Synthesis and applications. Ecosystem properties that are intrinsically more variable over
space and time will often be the least predictable restoration outcomes. Restoration practi-
tioners can expect vegetation structure, species richness and functional diversity to be more
predictable and less variable than taxonomic composition, which can exhibit dynamic
responses to restoration treatments over time. Monitoring dominant native and invasive spe-
cies will always be important, but given the functional redundancy that can occur within com-
munities, strict targets based on composition may rarely be met. Trait-based metrics that
integrate taxonomic composition into their calculation are less variable and potentially more
meaningful for evaluating ecosystem responses. The hierarchy of predictability should be
tested in a range of ecosystems to determine its generality.

Introduction
The restoration of degraded ecosystems is one of the most
important challenges in applied ecology (Suding 2011),
yet our ability to accurately predict restoration outcomes
across space and time is still limited (Brudvig 2011). Suc-
cess in restoration is evaluated by monitoring a broad
range of ecosystem properties, including community struc-
ture,
diversity,
composition
and
ecosystem
function
(Ruiz-Jaen & Mitchell Aide 2005). Part of the challenge
of predicting restoration success stems from our limited
understanding of the natural variability of responses
among these types of ecosystem properties (Matthews,
Spyreas & Endress 2009). Here we provide the ﬁrst empir-
ical test of the proposed ‘hierarchy of predictability’
(Brudvig et al. in press) that ranks measures of restora-
tion outcomes from most-to-least predictable: vegetation
structure > taxonomic diversity > functional diversity >
taxonomic composition (Fig. 1). Conﬁrmation of this pro-
posed hierarchy would help practitioners set realistic goals
for each measure of success.
The proposed ranking in the hierarchy is based on the
nested nature of restoration goals (Fig. 1). In order for
one measure of restoration success, say X, to be more
variable and less predictable than, say Y, multiple combi-
nations of X must be able to produce the same value of
Y. For this reason, the most variable and hence least pre-
dictable response was proposed to be taxonomic composi-
tion (Fig. 1) because many different combinations of
functionally redundant species can produce the same
levels of diversity or total biomass (Yachi & Loreau 1999;
Elmqvist et al. 2003). For example, two communities can be
comprised of distinct sets of species yet have identical species
richness, so composition is proposed to be more variable
and less predictable than diversity (Fig. 1). Furthermore,
monocultures can produce similar yields to polycultures
(Loreau & Hector 2001), so diversity is proposed to be more
variable and less predictable than physical vegetation struc-
ture (Fig. 1). The most predictable response to restoration
efforts has been proposed to be the physical structure of the
ecosystem (Brudvig et al. in press), such as the peak standing
crop of grasslands or the height of forest canopies. Commu-
nity composition and diversity can be dynamic as the
restoration project develops, but these will still likely pro-
duce the target structure, e.g. a grassland or forest.
Community composition can be highly variable during
restoration and vegetation development because of prior-
ity effects, dispersal limitation and species interactions
(Matthews & Spyreas 2010; Helsen, Hermy & Honnay
2012; Norden et al. 2015). For these reasons, functional
trait-based metrics have been suggested to be more gen-
eral and useful measures of restoration success than taxo-
nomic
composition
alone
(Brancalion
&
Holl
2016).
Functional traits are phenotypic properties that impact
species’ ﬁtness and ecosystem functioning (Violle et al.
2007). For example, morphological leaf traits affect both
light acquisition and maximum rates of carbon ﬁxation.
Traits are important for understanding species and com-
munity-level responses to restoration treatments (Laughlin
2014; Zirbel et al. 2017) and ecosystem resilience (Mori,
Furukawa & Sasaki 2013). Trait-based ecology provides a
general approach for evaluating treatment effects and for
deriving species assemblages to achieve restoration objec-
tives (Pywell et al. 2003; Funk et al. 2008; Tullos et al.
2009; Sandel, Corbin & Krupa 2011; Hedberg et al. 2013;
Ostertag et al. 2015). Just as different combinations of
functionally similar species can produce the same species
richness or physical structure in a restoration project, dif-
ferent combinations of species abundances can produce
the same trait-based metrics (Helsen, Hermy & Honnay
2012).
Two
trait-based
metrics
that
describe
distinct
modes of trait distributions are easily evaluated in restora-
tion projects: community-weighted mean (CWM) trait val-
ues describe the central tendencies of functional traits in a
community (Sandel, Corbin & Krupa 2011; Brancalion &
Holl 2016), and functional diversity (FD) describes the
variation of functional traits in a community (Laliberte &
Legendre 2010; Hedberg et al. 2013). However, the loca-
tion of each of these metrics in the hierarchy of pre-
dictability is unknown because two communities could
have the same trait mean but different variances or the
same trait variance but different means.

variability and predictability of ecosystem properties used as mea-
sures of success in ecological restoration, adapted from Brudvig
et al. (in press). The question marks indicate that the placement
of the two functional trait-based metrics and their location with
respect to species richness are the most uncertain.

First, CWM trait values ( T) are univariate quantities
that describe the average trait value in a community:
T ¼
XS
i¼1 tipi;
eqn 1
where ti is the mean trait of species i, pi is the relative
abundance of species i and S is the number of species in
the community. Multiple taxonomic compositions can
have precisely the same T. Consider a pool of six species
that differ from one another along a single functional trait
axis (Fig. 2a). Let communities A and B represent two
distinct subsets of these six species. All possible species
abundances for these two communities can be illustrated
as triangular planes in three-dimensional species space
provided that they are converted to relative abundances
by satisfying the following equation:
1 ¼
XS
i¼1 pi
eqn 2
The light and dark grey triangles in Fig. 2b,c represent all
possible combinations of relative abundances for each of
the two communities, illustrating the potential variability
of community composition even with just three species.
By solving the system of linear equations that includes
eqns (1) and (2) (Laughlin & Laughlin 2013), it can be
shown that the same CWM trait value (e.g. T = 35) can
occur in distinct subsets of those six species (Fig. 2b,c).
Moreover, within each community, there is a range of rel-
ative abundances that can produce a community with
T = 35 (i.e. the black lines in Fig. 2b,c represent the solu-
tions to the system of linear equations), demonstrating
the nested nature of CWM traits within community com-
position (Fig. 1).
Second, FD indices describe the variation in functional
traits within a community (Mason et al. 2005; Laliberte &
Legendre 2010). Multiple taxonomic compositions can
have precisely the same FD. For example, consider the
FD and CWM trait values for all possible combinations
of species abundances in Fig. 2d for the two theoretical
communities. It can be seen that a wide range of composi-
tions can yield identical levels of FD (see horizontal
dashed line in Fig. 2d). A broad range of FD is possible
while holding the CWM trait constant (vertical line in
Fig. 2d), but likewise there is also a broad range of CWM
trait values that are possible while holding FD constant
(dashed horizontal line in Fig. 2d). For this reason, there
is no clear a priori rationale to rank either CWM traits or
FD above one or the other within the hierarchy of pre-
dictability. They are both predicted to be less variable
than community composition (Fig. 1), but it is possible
that functional trait-based metrics could be less variable
than species richness.
Our objective was to conduct the ﬁrst test of the hierar-
chy of predictability using one of the longest running
ecological restoration experiments in the western USA.
Long-term analyses are particularly important because
they allow us to incorporate both temporal and spatial
variability into our assessment of predictability. We anal-
ysed a 23-year dataset on herbaceous understorey plant
community responses to restoration treatments in a pon-
derosa pine-bunchgrass ecosystem in northern Arizona.
Restoration treatments included combinations of light or
heavy tree thinning and no ﬁre or repeated prescribed ﬁre
every 4 years to release the herbaceous understorey from
overstorey competition. The herbaceous vegetation was
not directly manipulated by seeding or planting, so the
development
of
the
vegetation
was relatively
uncon-
strained, which is ideal for testing the hierarchy of pre-
dictability
because
there
may
be
little
difference
in
predictability among ecosystem properties if the response
is strongly controlled (Brudvig et al. in press). We asked
the following questions: (i) How has herbaceous biomass,
species richness, FD, CWM traits and community compo-
sition varied among restoration treatments over time and
(ii) do the observed responses match the predictions of
the proposed hierarchy of predictability?
Materials and methods
STUDY SYSTEM
Forests dominated by ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.
var. scopulorum Engelm) occupy extensive areas of western North
America and are a major focus of restoration efforts. Over the
last 140+ years, a number of factors including livestock grazing,
logging and ﬁre suppression have combined to favour pine estab-
lishment at the expense of understorey herbaceous plant diversity
and productivity. As a consequence, contemporary forests con-
tain uncharacteristically high tree densities with closed canopies,
lower light availability, and deeper forest ﬂoor litter and duff lay-
ers (Covington & Moore 1994). Historically, these forests were
described as open stands consisting of large trees interspersed
among openings of a diverse and productive, grass-dominated
understorey. These conditions were maintained primarily by fre-
quent, low-intensity surface ﬁres that regulated the competitive
balance between overstorey and understorey plant communities.
Practices designed to restore this balance focus primarily on
manipulating overstorey forest composition and structure in an
effort to re-establish a productive understorey plant community
because the understorey represents the major source of plant
diversity and can shape ecosystem function (Kaye et al. 2005).
This study was conducted on a decommissioned portion of the
G.A. Pearson Natural Area (GPNA), located approximately
10 km northwest of Flagstaff, Arizona in the Fort Valley Experi-
mental Forest, Coconino National Forest. The approximately
43-ha study site is c. 2200 m in elevation, with ﬂat to gently roll-
ing
topography
with
some
southwesterly
and
northwesterly
aspects. Soils are derived from Tertiary basalt ﬂows and cinders,
and are classiﬁed as a Brolliar stony clay loam, and a complex of
ﬁne, smectitic Typic Argiborolls and Mollic Eutroboralfs. The
average annual temperature is 76 °C. Average annual precipita-
tion is approximately 57 cm, and follows a bimodal precipitation
pattern with approximately half of the precipitation occurring as
rain in late summer and half as snow in the winter. Drought was
common during this study, with 2002 being one of the most sev-
ere droughts in the southwestern USA (Breshears et al. 2005).

Inter-annual precipitation data were obtained from the Fort Val-
ley Experimental Forest weather records (USDA, Forest Service
Rocky Mountain Research Station 2005), supplemented by data
from the Flagstaff Pulliam Airport when data were missing from
Fort Valley. Because both snow pack and summer monsoon
affect herbaceous biomass in this system, we calculated inter-
annual precipitation as total amount of precipitation over the
previous 12 months from the time of vegetation sampling in
September. The study area was fenced to exclude domestic ungu-
lates in 1950, and so has been ungrazed by livestock for more
than 50 years. In 1992, a 24-m electriﬁed fence was constructed
to exclude wild ungulates from the GPNA study area to prevent
elk from overgrazing the restoration treatment area. Some large
trees were selectively harvested from GPNA in 1894, but there
was no commercial harvest after that. The last major ﬁre in the
vicinity prior to this experiment occurred in 1876 (Dieterich
1980). Before 1876, surface ﬁres burned through the area on a 2-
to 3-year interval. Ponderosa pine is the only overstorey species
on the study site.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
In 1992, circular plots with a diameter of 5 m were established
within
each
of
three
patch
types
(post-settlement
retained,
post-settlement removed and remnant grass patches) at GPNA.
‘Post-settlement retained’ patches consisted of a stand of small-
diameter (<30 cm) trees that established after 1876 (i.e. the onset
of ﬁre exclusion). ‘Post-settlement removed’ patches consisted of
an area where all post-settlement trees were cut and removed
from the site, thereby creating an opening in the canopy.
Fig. 2. Given two distinct subsets of a pool of six species that differ from one another along a single functional trait axis (a), a range of
relative abundances can produce the same average trait values in two distinct subsets of the species pool (b, c). The dark and light grey
triangles in (b) and (c), respectively, represent the entire range of possible relative abundances for each of the three species, and the black
lines represent the range of possible relative abundances where the community-weighted mean (CWM) trait value of the community is
35. The possible range of functional diversity (computed as Functional Dispersion) and CWM traits in each community is shown in (d).

‘Remnant grass patches’ were located within small (generally
<10 9 10 m) open areas where no or only a few trees were pre-
sent and where a sward of native grasses was present. One plot
per patch type was nested within ‘whole plots’. Five whole plots
were not treated at all, ﬁve whole plots were only thinned, and
ﬁve received a composite treatment including thinning, raking
and removal of forest ﬂoor fuels, and prescribed burning (Cov-
ington et al. 1997; Moore et al. 2006). In 1993, thinning resulted
in the removal of an average of 2226 trees per ha. All pre-settle-
ment trees and trees greater than 406-cm diameter at breast
height were retained. In addition, 5–15 smaller diameter trees
were retained to replace stumps, snags and downed logs, and
recreate the clumped pattern of the pre-settlement forest (Coving-
ton et al. 1997). Pine basal area was reduced by 45% in the post-
settlement retained patches and by 95% in the post-settlement
removed patches. The ﬁrst prescribed burn was implemented in
October 1994 (after data collection in that year), with subsequent
burns in October 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014.
Remnant grass patches provide a clear baseline for setting
restoration objectives in this system, and degraded understorey
patches invaded by small-diameter pine trees provide a control
for evaluating treatment effects (Laughlin et al. 2006). Therefore,
we deﬁned ‘control’ plots (n = 5) as post-settlement retained plots
that were never thinned or burned. ‘Lightly thinned’ plots (n = 5)
were post-settlement retained plots that were thinned, ‘lightly
thinned and burned’ plots (n = 5) were post-settlement retained
plots that were thinned and burned, ‘heavily thinned’ plots
(n = 5) were post-settlement removed plots that were small patch
clear cut, and ‘heavily thinned and burned’ plots (n = 5) were
post-settlement removed plots that were patch cut and burned.
We deﬁne ‘reference’ plots as remnant grass patches, which
provide reference information that is close in both space and
time (White & Walker 1997). These remnant grass patches were
originally located in a canopy gap, but occurred within larger
areas that were either thinned, or thinned and burned. There
was no detectable difference between these two, so we combined
them into a single set of ‘reference’ plots (n = 10). The remnant
grass patches in this study are not inherently different from the
surrounding post-settlement tree patches. Kerns et al. (2003)
found no difference in chemical and physical soil properties (O
horizon thickness, A horizon thickness, texture, pH and phy-
tolith concentration) between remnant grass patches and patches
that were invaded by trees, suggesting that these invaded post-
settlement patches represent recent tree invasion of formerly
grass-dominated
areas.
Furthermore,
Sanchez
Meador
et al.
(2009) found that in this matrix of old-growth pine trees and
grass openings, the Pinus seedlings (which are now medium-
sized mature trees) were initially established in the early 1900s
near the centre of these natural grass patches. Gradually, over
the past 100 years, they ﬁlled in the remaining available growing
space between the old-growth groups and the grass openings.
Even though pine seed could easily disperse into these areas,
these studies suggest that pine seedlings have not established in
the remnant grass openings yet.
DATA COLLECTION
Herbaceous standing crop data were collected in 1992 (pre-treat-
ment), 1994 (after thinning, but before the ﬁrst burn), 1995, 1996,
1998, 1999, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2010 and 2014. Prior to 1999, bio-
mass was separated by functional group; from 1999 onward, bio-
mass was separated into individual species. Because of this,
analysis of total biomass included years 1992–2014, whereas anal-
ysis of functional trait metrics that relied on species-level biomass
included years 1999–2014. Field sampling occurred during a 2-
week period in mid-September, which is the time of peak above-
ground production and ﬂowering for major understorey species
in northern Arizona. We sampled two 1-m2 (05 9 20 m) quad-
rats per plot. All live herbaceous vegetation rooted in the quad-
rats was clipped at ground level. Quadrats were arranged in a
wagon-wheel conﬁguration around the plot centre, and clipping
was rotated each year so that the same piece of land was not har-
vested 2 years in a row. All statistical analyses were conducted at
the plot level (N = 35 plots per year).
While responses of various functional groups (e.g. legumes, C4
and C3 graminoids, etc.) have been documented previously
(Laughlin et al. 2006; Moore et al. 2006), substantial variation of
functional traits exists within functional groups (Wright et al.
2004; Laughlin et al. 2010). The assessment of multiple quantita-
tive functional traits is important because they have been shown
to be key drivers of ecosystem multi-functionality (Mori, Furu-
kawa & Sasaki 2013; Derhe et al. 2016). We used species-level
mean functional traits of understorey plants in the Flagstaff
region (Laughlin et al. 2010). We evaluated speciﬁc leaf area
(SLA), maximum height, seed mass and ﬂowering date because
these represent important dimensions of plant form and function
in this ﬂora (Westoby & Wright 2006; Laughlin et al. 2010) and
because the increase in pine tree density has been associated with
a shift in dominance towards species with lower SLA, larger seed
mass, shorter height and earlier ﬂowering dates (Laughlin, Moore
& Fule 2011). SLA reﬂects the trade-off between maximum leaf
photosynthetic rate and leaf longevity, maximum height reﬂects
competitive ability, seed mass reﬂects the trade-off between seed
output and maternal investment in each seed, and ﬂowering date
reﬂects seasonal and phenological variation among species (Wes-
toby & Wright 2006).
We measured traits on robust, ungrazed plants grown in well-
lit environments (Laughlin et al. 2010). When measuring traits
on species that are adapted to shady conditions, we tried to
sample individuals in canopy openings. SLA is the ratio of leaf
area to dry weight expressed as mm2 mg1. SLA was measured
on 10–20 individuals when the species was ﬂowering across sev-
eral ﬁeld sites in the presence of other species. Canopy height
was measured as the height of the foliage (not the height of the
inﬂorescence) of a species measured in centimetres. Height was
measured on robust ﬂowering individuals and therefore reﬂects
an average maximum height for each species. Seed mass is the
oven-dry mass of an average seed expressed in milligrams.
When possible, seeds were harvested from several individuals of
each species. Mean seed mass was determined by weighing the
total mass of between 20 and 100 individual seeds (depending
on the species), then dividing the total dry weight by the num-
ber of seeds in the sample. Mean Julian ﬂowering dates and for
each species were determined using regional ﬂoras by taking the
median between the ﬁrst and last days of the year that a species
is in ﬂower.
DATA ANALYSIS
A total of 74 herbaceous understorey species were detected across
the study site through time and were included in our analyses of
trait means and FD. For each plot, we computed two distinct
FD indices using both single traits and multiple traits (Mouchet
et al. 2010). Functional richness (FRic) is measured as the convex

hull volume when multiple traits are evaluated, and as the range
when only a single trait is evaluated. Measures of species relative
abundances are not incorporated into functional richness. Func-
tional dispersion (FDis) is an index of FD that accounts for spe-
cies abundances. This index is the abundance-weighted sum of
deviances from a centroid in univariate or multivariate trait space
across all species in a community (Laliberte & Legendre 2010).
CWM traits were computed as linear combinations of species-
level trait means and species relative abundances using eqn (1).
We used functions in the FD package of R to compute these veg-
etation indices (Laliberte & Legendre 2010).
We ﬁt linear mixed effects models using the lmer function in the
lme4 package of R (Bates et al. 2015) to quantify responses to eco-
logical restoration treatments over space and time. We analysed
changes in herbaceous biomass measured as peak standing crop.
Biomass was modelled as a function of the following ﬁxed effects:
a six-level treatment factor, year, treatment-by-year interaction, a
pre-treatment covariate (to account for potential pre-existing dif-
ferences)
and
inter-annual
precipitation.
Autocorrelation
of
repeated measurements was accounted for by estimating random
intercepts for each plot, while allowing responses in each plot to
have varying slopes with respect to time. Quantifying this random
variation among plots was of interest to better understand the
variable nature of responses to restoration treatments (Munson
et al. 2015; Brudvig et al. in press). Therefore, we computed the
marginal R2 (hereafter, R2
m, the proportion of variance explained
by the ﬁxed effects) and the conditional R2 (hereafter, R2
c, the pro-
portion of variance explained by both ﬁxed and random effects)
using the r.squaredGLMM function in the MuMIn package in R
(Nakagawa & Schielzeth 2013; Barton 2015).
To quantify long-term treatment effects on the other vegetation
attributes (i.e. species richness, FD, CWM traits and community
composition), we ﬁtted linear mixed effects models where each
response variable was a function of a six-level treatment factor,
year, treatment-by-year interaction, annual precipitation and ran-
dom plot effects. We reduced the dimensionality of community
composition using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS)
ordination with the metaMDS function in the vegan library of R
(Oksanen et al. 2011). We extracted the ﬁrst two NMS axes for
each plot in each year for use in the linear mixed effects models.
Results
Herbaceous biomass responded strongly to thinning and
burning restoration treatments (Fig. 3). Prior to treatment,
reference communities had signiﬁcantly higher herbaceous
biomass (~800 kg ha1) than all other treatments, each of
which exhibited very low biomass (<100 kg ha1; Fig. 3).
Five to 6 years after treatment, biomass in the heavy thin-
ning treatments, but not in the light thinning treatments,
approached levels found in the reference communities,
while biomass in the control remained low (Fig. 3). Annual
precipitation positively inﬂuenced biomass (Fig. 3 inset),
which is clearly seen in the reduced biomass in 2002, an
exceptionally dry year. Fixed effects (treatment, time, pre-
cipitation and pre-treatment covariate) explained over half
of the variation in biomass, and random plot effects
accounted for <20% of the total variation (R2
m = 057,
R2
c = 076). Biomass was the most predictable and least
variable measure of restoration success (Fig. 4).
Taxonomic species richness was highest in the reference
communities. In all treatments, except the light thin and
no burn treatments, richness increased and became similar
to the levels in the reference communities (Fig. 5a). Treat-
ment,
time
and
treatment-by-time
interaction
effects
explained 45% of the variation in species richness, and
random plot effects accounted for <30% of the total vari-
ation (R2
m = 045, R2
c = 074). Species richness was the sec-
ond most predictable and second least variable measure
of restoration success (Fig. 4).
Multi-trait functional richness was highest in the refer-
ence communities (Fig. 5b). Treatment, time and treat-
ment-by-time interaction effects explained 35% of the
variation in multi-trait functional richness, and random
plot effects accounted for 30% of the total variation
(R2
m = 035, R2
c = 065). The greatest increases in func-
tional richness were detected in the heavy thin and burn
treatment (Fig. 5a), and it was not related to precipitation
(P > 005). Functional richness was the third most pre-
dictable and third least variable measure of restoration
success (Fig. 4). Multivariate functional dispersion was
not signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by treatment and did not
change signiﬁcantly over time (Fig. 5c). However, it was
positively related to precipitation, and random plot effects
accounted for 32% of total variation in functional disper-
sion (R2
m = 023, R2
c = 055).
Community-weighted mean SLA (Fig. 6a; R2
m = 016,
R2
c = 046),
maximum
height
(Fig. 6c;
R2
m = 010,
R2
c = 054), seed mass (Fig. 6e; R2
m = 011, R2
c = 049) and
ﬂowering date (Fig. 6g; R2
m = 024, R2
c = 066) did not
exhibit signiﬁcant treatment effects, time effects or treat-
ment-by-time interaction effects. CWM SLA and seed
mass were both positively and signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by
annual
precipitation
(Fig. 5a,e).
Random
plot
effects
accounted for almost twice the variation in CWM traits
as ﬁxed effects, placing them towards the low end of the
hierarchy of predictability (Fig. 4).

accounted for as much variation in functional richness of
these traits as the ﬁxed effects. Most treatments converged
with levels of functional richness in the reference commu-
nities (Fig. 6). Precipitation was positively related to func-
tional richness of ﬂowering date (Fig. 6h).
Taxonomic community composition was relatively stable
in the control and reference communities, but was dynamic
over time within the experimental treatments (Fig. 7).
Composition changed the least in the light thinning and no
burning treatment, and composition in the heavy thin and
burn treatment came closest to the composition in the refer-
ence communities (Fig. 7). Treatment, time and treatment-
by-time interaction effects explained 33% of the variation

accounted for an additional 48% of total variation in NMS
axis 1 (R2
c = 081). Year effects explained 15% of the varia-
tion in NMS axis 2, and random plot effects accounted for
66% of the total variation in NMS axis 2 (R2
m = 015,
R2
c = 081). Community composition was the most variable
measure of restoration success (Fig. 4).
Discussion
We examined long-term effects of ecological restoration
treatments on a variety of vegetation properties to con-
duct the ﬁrst test, the proposed hierarchy of predictability
for measures of restoration success. Our results are in
general agreement with the proposed hierarchy (Brudvig
et al. in press): biomass and species richness were the two
most predictable and least variable measures of success,
whereas community composition was the most variable
measure of success. Trait-based measures of FD tended to
be more predictable and less variable than CWM trait
values in this experiment, but both trait-based metrics
were less variable than taxonomic composition (Helsen,
Hermy & Honnay 2012). Restoration practitioners can
use these results to guide the selection of targets and to
manage expectations about the predictability of desired
future
conditions
(Hobbs
&
Norton
1996;
Landres,
Morgan & Swanson 1999).
HIERARCHY OF PREDICTABILITY
Ecosystem properties that were intrinsically more variable
were also the least predictable (Fig. 4). The ﬁxed effects
in
our
models
represented
the
combined
effects
of
treatment, time, treatment-by-time interactions and inter-
annual
precipitation,
whereas
random
plot
effects
accounted for random variation among plots through time.
There is no statistical reason to expect variation associated
with ﬁxed effects to be correlated with variation associated
with random effects (Pinheiro & Bates 2006; Nakagawa &
Schielzeth 2013). In this experiment, variation accounted
for by ﬁxed effects was negatively associated with variation
accounted for by random plot effects (Fig. 4b). Our results
provide empirical evidence for the hierarchical and nested
nature of measures of restoration success. Taxonomic com-
position has been shown to be less deterministic than met-
rics of diversity in restoration projects (Matthews, Spyreas
& Endress 2009; Helsen, Hermy & Honnay 2012). The
sequence of species arrival and establishment can lead to
distinct composition over time, but different compositions
could be functionally similar and contain the same number
of species. Moreover, different combinations of function-
ally redundant species and different levels of diversity can
produce the same levels of total biomass (Yachi & Loreau
1999; Loreau & Hector 2001; Elmqvist et al. 2003).
The hierarchical ordering of trait-based metrics remains
less clear. In this study, measures of trait variation (i.e.
FD) were generally more predictable and less variable

than measures of central tendencies of traits (i.e. CWM
traits) within communities (Fig. 4a,b). All trait-based met-
rics were less variable than taxonomic composition, even
though composition is a component of their calculation
(Laliberte & Legendre 2010). Analyses of trait-based met-
rics can be more informative than community composi-
tion because they can provide functional explanations for
why certain species change in abundance (Hedberg et al.
2013), and changes in composition are less deterministic
than changes in functional traits (Helsen, Hermy & Hon-
nay 2012). Trait-based metrics may be more useful and
ﬂexible for restoration practitioners when setting goals
and assessing responses because speciﬁc functional objec-
tives can be met with a range of species assemblages
(Brancalion & Holl 2016).
Restoration practitioners are justiﬁably interested in the
identities of species in the community (Reid 2015). How-
ever, given the dynamic nature of taxonomic composition
in many restoration experiments (Matthews, Spyreas &
Endress 2009; Helsen, Hermy & Honnay 2012), strict tar-
gets based on composition may rarely be met. Monitoring
the individual abundances of dominant native species and
problematic invasive species will always be an important
component of evaluating restoration outcomes, but given
the functional redundancy that exists within ecosystems,
multiple species assemblages could meet the same objec-
tive within a restoration project. Functional trait-based
metrics are less variable than taxonomic composition, and
they can provide meaningful information about restora-
tion trajectories by integrating composition with func-
tional
traits.
Practitioners
can
use
this
hierarchy
of
predictability when developing expectations about the
likelihood of achieving speciﬁc targets. For example,
restoring the exact composition of a remnant forest may
not be possible, but restoring a similar functional trait
composition could be achievable and effective for restor-
ing ecosystem services (Brancalion & Holl 2016). Our
results come from a single long-term restoration experi-
ment, so this hierarchy must now be evaluated in a range
of ecosystems to test its generality (Brudvig et al. in
press). Given the observed range of predictability and
variability among restoration outcomes, we now discuss
the
long-term
responses
of
each
vegetation
property
within this ponderosa pine forest restoration experiment.

SYSTEM RESPONSES TO RESTORATION TREATMENTS
The
restoration
treatments
rapidly
produced
a
shift
towards reference conditions for understorey herbaceous
biomass, but the response was controlled by the amount of
thinning rather than burning. The importance of thinning
for increasing understorey productivity has been demon-
strated in a range of landscape-scale restoration experi-
ments throughout the southwestern USA in ponderosa pine
forests (Fule, Laughlin & Covington 2005; McGlone,
Springer & Laughlin 2009; Stoddard et al. 2011; Strahan
et al. 2015). Even though herbaceous production in the
heavy thinning treatment came close to the reference, it
tracked in parallel and consistently below it. This may be
because one of the most productive graminoid species, Fes-
tuca arizonica, has still not fully re-established in the treated
areas even though it is not limited by dispersal. In 2014,
Festuca comprised 49% of the total biomass across the

reference communities, whereas it comprised only 18% of
the total biomass across the treated plots. Nitrogen miner-
alization rates were highest in the remnant grass patches
(Kaye & Hart 1998), and this could also partly explain the
continued higher productivity in the remnant grass patches.
Indeed, improving soil fertility and microbial community
composition appears to be a critical component of success-
ful ecological restoration (Wubs et al. 2016). Full recovery
of herbaceous vegetation may take many decades in pine-
bunchgrass communities if soil properties, drought and dis-
persal limitation constrain species establishment.
Species richness and FD responded positively to restora-
tion treatments. Enhanced native plant diversity is a con-
sistent response across several landscape-scale restoration
experiments in western USA forests (Fule, Laughlin &
Covington 2005; Metlen & Fiedler 2006; Dodson, Peterson
& Harrod 2008; McGlone, Springer & Laughlin 2009;
Stoddard et al. 2011; Strahan et al. 2015). Light thinning
and no burning was the least effective treatment for species
richness. Surprisingly, functional richness in the heavy
thinning and burning treatment far surpassed the levels
found within the reference communities. This may be due
to the higher number of ruderal species that establish in
the bare ground that is exposed after the ﬁre consumes the
forest ﬂoor litter (Fule, Laughlin & Covington 2005). Rud-
eral forbs tend to contribute little to total biomass, which
may explain the lack of a parallel response in FDis, an
index that incorporates relative abundances into the calcu-
lation of FD (Mouchet et al. 2010).
Despite the increase in light availability following restora-
tion thinning treatments, CWM traits did not differ between
control and reference communities nor did they respond to
restoration treatments. There is considerable variation in
CWM traits across the pine-bunchgrass ecosystem (Laugh-
lin, Moore & Fule 2011; Shipley et al. 2011), so this lack of
response was surprising. We suspect the reason for this was
that this experimental site does not contain appreciable vari-
ation in either climate or soil properties, which can be impor-
tant drivers of variation in vegetation and CWM traits
(Abella & Covington 2006; Shipley et al. 2011). Indeed, veg-
etation responses to restoration treatments are highly vari-
able across different sites and soil types (Abella et al. 2015;
Strahan et al. 2015). As restoration treatments expand to
landscape scales, understanding the optimal trait values for
speciﬁc environmental conditions will be increasingly impor-
tant so that the composition of the restoration assemblage is
well adapted to the speciﬁc conditions of the site.
The lack of difference in CWM traits between degraded
control and reference communities indicates that the con-
trol communities at this site still retain some important
functional characteristics that may permit the system to
respond rapidly to restoration treatments (Moore et al.
2006). In more highly degraded ecosystems that have
crossed over signiﬁcant biotic and abiotic thresholds
(Hobbs, Higgs & Harris 2009), we expect that differences
in CWM traits between control and reference communities
will be more pronounced (Brancalion & Holl 2016). We
examined four traits that respond to changes in resource
availability (Westoby & Wright 2006), but it is possible
that other more plastic traits, such as number of ﬂowering
stalks or seed production, may be more sensitive to thin-
ning and prescribed ﬁre in the pine-bunchgrass ecosystem.
In this experiment, vegetation responses exhibited inter-
annual variation across the plots through time. Precipita-
tion varies strongly among years in the southwestern USA
(Breshears et al. 2005), and inter-annual climatic variation
contributed to the large range of variability in herbaceous
production, average seed mass, average SLA, multivariate
functional dispersion and the functional richness of ﬂower-
ing date. Given the predicted increasing frequency of
drought under climate change, restoration practitioners
must plan for the inevitable constraints that these droughts
will impose on vegetation responses to restoration treat-
ments (Wainwright, Wolkovich & Cleland 2012).
The natural range of variability of vegetation properties
should guide how restoration goals are decided and evalu-
ated (Landres, Morgan & Swanson 1999). Our results sup-
port the proposed hierarchy of predictability that ranks
measures of restoration success from most-to-least pre-
dictable in the following order: physical structure > taxo-
nomic
diversity
>
functional
diversity
>
taxonomic
composition (Brudvig et al. in press). In this experiment,
restoration treatments were largely effective at increasing
herbaceous production, species richness and FD, but
responses of CWM traits and composition were more vari-
able. Restoration practitioners should expect vegetation
structure, species richness and FD to be more predictable
than taxonomic composition, which can exhibit dynamic
responses to restoration treatments over space and time.
