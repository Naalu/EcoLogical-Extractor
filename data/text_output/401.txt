Forest ﬁres are increasing in size and severity globally, yet the roles of natural and artiﬁcial regeneration in
promoting forest recovery are poorly understood. Post-ﬁre regeneration of ponderosa pine (Pinus pon-
derosa, Lawson and C. Lawson) in the southwestern U.S. is slow, episodic, and difﬁcult to predict.
Planting of ponderosa pine after wildﬁre may accelerate reforestation, but little is known about survival
of plantings and the amount of post-ﬁre natural regeneration. We compared ponderosa pine regeneration
between paired planted and unplanted plots at eight sites in Arizona and New Mexico that recently (2002–
2005) burned severely. Two sites had no natural regeneration and no survival of planted seedlings.
Seedling presence increased with number of years since burning across all plots, was positively associated
with forb and litter cover on planted plots, and was positively associated with litter cover on unplanted
plots. Survival of planted seedlings, measured ﬁve to eight years after planting, averaged 25% (SE = 8)
and varied from 0% to 70% across sites resulting in seedling densities of 0–521 trees ha1. Based on a pro-
jected 44% survival of seedlings to mature trees and target density of mature trees determined by histor-
ical range of variability and ecological restoration principles, four of eight sites have a seedling density in
planted plots (125–240 ha1) that will produce a density of mature trees (55–106 ha1) close to desired
levels, whereas seedlings are currently deﬁcient at three planted sites, and in surplus at one site, which
had abundant natural regeneration. Natural regeneration in unplanted plots during the ﬁrst decade after
burning produced seedling densities inconsistent with desired numbers of mature trees. Natural regener-
ation in unplanted plots produced less than 33 seedlings ha1 at seven of eight sites, but produced 1433
seedlings ha1 at one high-elevation site that supported a more mesic vegetation community before burn-
ing than the other sites. Our results show that current practices for planting ponderosa pine after severe
ﬁres in Arizona and New Mexico produce desired numbers of seedlings in approximately half of all pro-
jects, whereas natural regeneration rarely does within the ﬁrst decade after burning.

1. Introduction
The occurrence of large forest ﬁres has increased globally
(Williams et al., 2013) and is projected to continue increasing
due to climate warming (Liu et al., 2010; Flannigan et al., 2013;
Xu et al., 2013). For example, ﬁre size and perhaps severity have
already increased over the last century in forests of western
North America (Westerling et al., 2006; Littell et al., 2009; Miller
et al., 2009; Westerling et al., 2011). Large intense wildﬁres have
the potential to shift forest to other vegetation types when local
tree
seed
sources
are
eliminated
(Savage
and
Mast,
2005;
Roccaforte et al., 2012). Deforestation caused by wildﬁre is espe-
cially pronounced in semi-arid forests of tree species lacking
serotinous cones and resprouting capacity, and where tree estab-
lishment is limited by water stress (Pausas et al., 2008; Williams
et al., 2010; Savage et al., 2013). Limitations to tree establishment
by water and heat stresses likely will be ampliﬁed by increasing
temperature over the next century (Castro et al., 2005; Herrero
et al., 2013; IPCC, 2013). Whereas several studies have investigated
natural regeneration of trees after wildﬁre (Bonnet et al., 2005;
Donato et al., 2009; Haire and McGarigal, 2010; Crotteau et al.,
2013), few also have considered the role of tree planting in accel-
erating forest recovery.
Post-ﬁre tree planting is currently controversial. Long delays in
tree natural regeneration after intense burning have prompted

recommendations for planting native trees (Beschta et al., 2004;
Sessions et al., 2004; Passovoy and Fulé, 2006; Zhang et al., 2006)
in order to promote forest resilience and carbon sequestration
(Millar et al., 2007). On the other hand, cautions against post-ﬁre
planting arise from abundant post-ﬁre natural tree regeneration
in some regions (Shatford et al., 2007), evidence that successful
dense plantings increase future ﬁre severity (Thompson et al.,
2007), and preference for natural recovery processes (Haire and
McGarigal, 2010).
Forests dominated by ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa, Lawson
and C. Lawson) in the southwestern U.S. are a good example of a
forest region where the need for post-ﬁre tree planting is unre-
solved. Tree density in most ponderosa pine forests in the south-
western U.S. is currently greater than conditions documented
prior
to
European
settlement
(circa
1880)
due
to
early
clear-cutting of old trees and over-grazing, followed by large
region-wide pulses of tree regeneration and the suppression of
low-intensity ﬁres (Savage and Swetnam, 1990; Covington and
Moore, 1994; Swetnam et al., 1999). Current forests are signiﬁ-
cantly more prone to large-scale severe burning than they were
historically (Allen et al., 2002; Williams et al., 2010). Severely
burned ponderosa pine forests of the southwestern U.S. are at risk
of conversion to non-forested ecosystems due to slow, sparse pine
regeneration (Savage and Mast, 2005; Dore et al., 2012; Roccaforte
et al., 2012; Savage et al., 2013).
Natural regeneration of ponderosa pine following severe wild-
ﬁre often takes many decades, especially in large openings distant
from seed trees (Bonnet et al., 2005; Haire and McGarigal, 2010).
For example, ponderosa pine regeneration was considered to be
unsuccessful for the ﬁrst decade after the high severity Cone Fire
in northern California based on less than 72 established seedlings
ha1 (Ritchie and Knapp, 2014). In particular, plots with distance
to seed trees greater than 60 m had less than 25 established seed-
lings ha1 (Ritchie and Knapp, 2014). A recent study in the south-
western U.S. showed that ponderosa pine did not regenerate
within
the
ﬁrst
decade
in
57%
of
severely
burned
stands
(Roccaforte et al., 2012). A longer term study of two severely
burned sites in Arizona and New Mexico reported little natural
regeneration of ponderosa pine for the ﬁrst decade after burning,
followed by a slow moving front of regeneration in the second dec-
ade that extended 200 m from seed source (Haire and McGarigal,
2010).
Slow regeneration after severe wildﬁre can be attributed to
many factors that limit ponderosa pine seedling establishment.
Basic regeneration requirements of ponderosa pine have been well
established in the literature (Schubert, 1974; White, 1985) as a
large supply of seed; a seedbed with loose soil, light litter cover,
and mostly free of competing vegetation; light shade; consistent
moisture for seed germination and early seedling growth; and
low populations of seed- and seedling-eating mammals, birds,
and insects. Slow regeneration of ponderosa pine after severe ﬁre
has been attributed to a lack of seed trees and its lack of
ﬁre-adapted serotinous cones and vegetative resprouting (Burns
and Honkala, 1990; Haire and McGarigal, 2010; Puhlick et al.,
2012). Post-ﬁre factors that can make the seedbed unfavorable
for ponderosa pine regeneration include high soil temperature
(Kasischke and Johnstone, 2005), topsoil erosion (Moody and
Martin,
2001),
and
heavy
herbaceous
competition
(Pearson,
1942). These negative inﬂuences on natural seedling establishment
may be ameliorated by ‘‘nurse logs’’ or lopped and scattered slash
from logging activities that create favorable microsites (Salonius
et al., 1996; Castro et al., 2011). Shrubs and herbaceous plants
may facilitate seedling establishment initially (Keyes et al., 2007,
2009; Redmond and Barger, 2013), but later become resource com-
petitors (Peppin et al., 2010; Huffman et al., 2012). Herbivory from
ungulates and burrowing mammals can negatively inﬂuence
seedling survival and growth (Heidmann, 2008; Waring and
Goodrich, 2012). The occurrence of environmental conditions con-
ducive to regeneration of ponderosa pine after high-severity ﬁre is
projected to decrease over the next century due to climate changes
that reduce water availability to seedlings and increase risk of frost
damage (Williams et al., 2013; Savage et al., 2013). Regeneration
failures
and
possible
range
contraction
have
recently
been
reported for ponderosa pine in the western U.S. (Bell et al., 2014).
Planting ponderosa pine after severe wildﬁre may accelerate
reforestation, yet little is known about survival of planted seed-
lings in recent reforestation projects, or whether planting is even
needed. In the southwestern U.S, planting of ponderosa pine after
wildﬁre is increasing after many decades of minimal planting
(Sánchez Meador and Graves, 2011). Interest in planting ponderosa
pine in the southwestern U.S. likely will increase in the future as
high-severity ﬁres, bark beetle outbreaks, and drought-induced
tree dieoffs (e.g., Williams et al., 2010; 2013) leave sites without
appropriate
forest
cover
required
by
the
National
Forest
Management Act for federal lands. Moreover, planting can be used
to introduce heat- and drought-tolerant populations to deforested
sites for the purpose of mitigating climate change impacts
(Rehfeldt et al., 2014).
Constraints to establishment of planted seedlings are similar to
those that inﬂuence natural regeneration, with the addition of
agency-, manager-, and contractor-inﬂuenced variables. Planting
practices important to regeneration success include decisions
about seed source, seedling stock type, storage, site selection, tim-
ing and method of planting, and mitigation of browsing and com-
peting vegetation (Schubert et al., 1970; Heidmann and Haase,
1989; Heidmann, 2008; Pinto et al., 2011). Survival of planted pon-
derosa pine seedlings in recent post-ﬁre reforestation projects is
not well known, but can vary widely. For example, survival of pon-
derosa pine seedlings planted following the Cone Fire in northern
California ranged from 30% to 96% among plots ten years after
planting (Ritchie and Knapp, 2014).
Most research on performance of planted ponderosa pine seed-
lings has focused on private forestlands in relatively mesic regions
in its range (e.g., Pinto et al., 2011; Ritchie and Knapp, 2014). The
need for post-ﬁre planting of ponderosa pine in the southwestern
U.S. is unknown and has not been widely considered aside from
a recent recommendation for managers to facilitate natural
post-ﬁre recovery processes and to be patient because natural
regeneration is slow after severe burning (Haire and McGarigal,
2010). Our study is the ﬁrst (to our knowledge) to measure pon-
derosa pine seedling survival on multiple planted sites after severe
wildﬁres and compare seedling density between planted and adja-
cent unplanted areas. We addressed the following questions using
data collected at eight severely burned sites in Arizona and New
Mexico: What is the survival of recent post-ﬁre plantings of pon-
derosa pine? What tree densities result from planting? What tree
densities result from natural post-ﬁre regeneration? What biotic
and abiotic factors are associated with post-ﬁre seedling establish-
ment, and do these factors differ between planted and naturally
established seedlings? Is natural regeneration after severe burning
adequate to produce desired future forest conditions? Our results
provide guidelines for tree planting in post-ﬁre reforestation of
ponderosa pine forests in the southwestern U.S.
2. Methods
2.1. Study sites
In summer 2013, we sampled post-ﬁre plantings of ponderosa
pine at eight sites that burned between 2002 and 2005 distributed
over four national forests in Arizona and New Mexico (Table 1). We

selected sites based on availability of information about planting
prescriptions and locations and because all had plantings that were
at least ﬁve years old at the time of our sampling in 2013. Average
annual precipitation since burning and since planting was 83–88%
of the 30-year average for all sites (Table 2). Average annual pre-
cipitation in the year of planting was 84–102% of the long-term
average for all sites.
Across all sites we sampled from a wide variety of soil parent
materials, as identiﬁed from Terrestrial Ecosystem Survey (TES)
map units. At the Borrego Fire (Decimal Degrees (DD) 105.802,
35.981), soil parent materials were granite (four plots), sandstone
(ﬁve plots), and a combination of these types plus limestone (three
plots) (Miller et al., 1993). At the Indian Fire (DD 112.494,
34.501), soil parent material was a residuum from granite for all
four plots (Robertson et al., 2000). At the Lakes Fire (DD
106.688, 35.887), soil parent material was sandstone alluvium
and tuff (Miller et al., 1993). At the Montoya Fire (DD 106.366,
36.482), soil parent material was sandstone (six plots) or unclassi-
ﬁed (ten plots) (Edwards et al., 1987). At the Pine Canyon Fire, soil
parent material was conglomerate sandstone (two plots) or unclas-
siﬁed (six plots) (Edwards et al., 1987). At the Ponil Complex (DD
105.090, 36.680), soil parent material was shale at all plots
(Edwards et al., 1987). At the Rodeo–Chediski Fire (DD 110.703,
34.228),
soil
parent
material
was
alluvium
(two
plots),
sandstone-alluvium (twelve plots), sandstone (ﬁve plots), or
sandstone-limestone (one plot) (Laing et al., 1987). At
the
Viveash Fire (DD 105.593, 35.705) soil parent material was gran-
ite at all plots (Miller et al., 1993).
Reforestation potential was identiﬁed at each site using Robbie
(1992), and TES map units of sampled plots are described in
Table 3. At the Borrego Fire, we sampled from TES map units 142
(four plots), 155 (one plot), 156 (three plots), 361 (four plots)
(Miller et al., 1993), which include several vegetation types.
Reforestation potential was rated moderate. At the Indian Fire,
one TES map unit (553) was sampled at all four plots where the
dominant vegetation type was P. ponderosa/Quercus emoryi (Torr.)
(Robertson et al., 2000) and reforestation potential was low. At
the Lakes Fire, TES map units 5 (three plots) and 615 (13 plots)
were sampled (Miller et al., 1993). The dominant vegetation type
was Abies concolor (Gord. & Glend.) Lindl. ex Hildebr./Pseudotsuga
menziezii (Mirb.) Franco/P. ponderosa for map unit 615 and a
grass-dominated type at map unit 5. Reforestation potential was
rated low. At the Montoya Fire, TES map units 162 (eight plots),
174 (six plots), and 631 (two plots) were sampled (Edwards
et al., 1987). The range of vegetation types is described in
Table 3. Reforestation potential was rated low-moderate (two
plots), moderate (eight plots), or high (six plots). At the Pine
Canyon Fire, TES map units 119 (six plots) and 159 (two plots)
were sampled (Edwards et al., 1987), which were dominated by a
Pinus edulis/Juniperus monosperma (Engelm.) Sarg. (map unit 119)
and P. edulis/J. monosperma/Quercus gambelii (Nutt.) (map unit
159) vegetation types. Reforestation potential was rated high (6
plots) and not rated for map unit 159. At the Ponil Complex, TES
map unit 264 (Edwards et al., 1987) was sampled, which was dom-
inated by a P. ponderosa/Q. gambelli vegetation type. Reforestation
potential was rated high. At the Rodeo–Chediski Fire, TES map
units 178, 182, 187, 191, and 192 (Laing et al., 1987) were sampled,
which were dominated by P. ponderosa. Reforestation potential
was rated low (at ﬁve plots), moderate (ﬁve plots), or high (at 10
plots). At the Viveash Fire, TES map unit 345 (Miller et al., 1993)
was
sampled
and
the
dominant
vegetation
type
was
P.
ponderosa/Juniperus scopulorum (Sarg.)/Q. gambelii. Reforestation
potential was rated low for all plots.
2.2. Plot selection
We based sampling intensity at each site on the number of
planting units. Planting units were identiﬁed as spatially distinct
polygons (>2 hectares) where trees were planted based on GIS
shapeﬁles of planting locations provided by National Forest staff
(USDA, 2013). For site-planting year combinations with more than
ﬁve distinct spatial units (i.e. polygons), each unit was sampled
with one 400-m2 plot and the number of sampled units was lim-
ited to 10. Plot size was designed to sample multiple planted seed-
lings on the widest spacing used over all sites, and was a
compromise among sampling efﬁciency, large plots needed to ade-
quately sample planted seedlings, and numerous small plots that
would be more optimal for detecting seedling presence.
Where there were more than 10 planting units, 10 units were
selected using a random number generator. For site-planting year
combinations with ﬁve or less planting units, two plots per unit
were sampled. Each 400 m2 circular plot sampled within a planting
unit was paired with an unplanted control plot as described below.
We used ArcMap 10 (ESRI, 2011) and either the Spatial Ecology
add-on (Beyer, 2004) or Jenness Tool (Jenness, 2012) to create a
systematic grid of plot locations across planting units spaced
between 50 m and 200 m apart, depending on unit size. Tighter
grid spacing was used on smaller units and wider grid spacing
was used for larger units. To expedite data collection and minimize
microsite differences between planted and unplanted plots, the
grid was clipped to exclude plots more than 1000 m from the near-
est planting unit boundary. A random number generator was used
to select plots from the grid. Paired unplanted plots were selected
from the same grid outside the planting unit on the same site.
These unplanted plots were selected to have the same burn sever-
ity, soil type and vegetation cover type, slope, and aspect as
planted plots. Burn severity was obtained from Monitoring
Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) (www.mtbs.gov) data layers,

which utilize burned area reﬂectance classiﬁcation (BARQ) satellite
imagery to compare near- and mid- infrared reﬂectance values to
assess post-ﬁre vegetation condition (USDA and DOI, 2013). A
paired t-test on data pooled over all sites showed that planted
and unplanted plots had similar slope, aspect, elevation, and burn
severity (p value >0.05).
2.3. Field data collection
We used circular plots of 400 m2 at all sites to sample seedlings,
vegetation, and other site characteristics. For each ponderosa pine
seedling in each plot, condition [live or dead], number of whorls,
presence/absence of a ‘‘nurse’’ object within 40 cm, type of nurse
object (wood, rock, or live vegetation), direction to nurse object
(N, NE, E, etc.), and nurse object size class [small (7.62–15.24 cm
diameter),
medium
(15.25–30.48 cm
diameter),
or
large
(>30.49 cm diameter)] were recorded. Nurse objects were deﬁned
as abiotic or biotic features that have the potential to ameliorate
microclimatic conditions (Castro et al., 2011). If more than one
nurse object was present, up to two were recorded per seedling.
To assess potential sources of competition in each plot, we went
from plot center out 5.6 m in each of the four cardinal directions to
place a 1 m2 vegetation quadrat (Daubenmire, 1959). Each quadrat
included measurements of percent aerial and basal cover in
categories: forbs, grasses, shrubs, conifer tree seedlings, other trees
(deciduous or conifers >1.37 m tall), bole (of standing live trees),
bare ground, rock, coarse woody debris (>7.62 cm), and litter. At
20 locations placed on a consistent, evenly-spaced grid on the plot,
canopy cover of woody species (shrubs and trees) was measured
using a vertical densitometer 15 cm from the ground level and
where canopy cover occurred, and the species/type was recorded.
The 15 cm height for canopy cover measurements was chosen to
assess plant cover that would provide competition for a tree seed-
ling. On a planar transect from the north end of the plot to the
south (22.57 m length), a transect (Brown, 1974) was used to mea-
sure
downed
woody
debris
(>7.62 cm)
by
diameter,
class
(sound/rotten), length, and location. Tree basal area (m2 ha1)
was measured for trees >1.37 m in height with a variable-radius
overstory point at plot center using a 10-basal-area factor prism.
Also, distance from plot center to seed trees was recorded up to
36 m away or 1.5 times the height of the seed tree (Waring and
Goodrich, 2012) and height of each seed tree was measured using
a laser hypsometer. Seed trees were deﬁned as those that had evi-
dence of recent cone production or were large enough (>40 cm
diameter breast height) to likely produce cones. Aspect values
were transformed into Northness and Eastness values (Palmer,
2014) based on the formula: northness = sin(aspect) and east-
ness = cos(aspect). Both values range from 1 to 1, with 1 being
due north or due east, respectively.
2.4. Statistical analysis
We converted seedling counts per plot to seedling density per
hectare. A categorical variable was created for seedling pres-
ence/absence in each plot and the percentage of seedlings near a
nurse object was calculated. Current (2013) plot-level seedling
density at planted sites was used to calculate seedling survival
based on reported planting density for each site (Table 1).
To test for difference in seedling density between planted plots
and unplanted plots, we used a general linear model (GLM) with
planting treatment (ﬁxed effect), site (random effect), and the
interaction between site and treatment as factors. We considered
plot pairing by using a paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test to com-
pare seedling density between planted and unplanted plots on data
pooled over all sites. The inﬂuences of environmental and vegeta-
tion variables on seedling density were investigated, but these
models had high residual deviance and low R2 (<0.001), and are
not subsequently reported. All statistical analyses (alpha = 0.05)
were run in the statistical software package R using the NLME
package (R Development Core Team, 2014).
Binomial GLMs that included plot pairs were used to evaluate
the effects of planting and other independent variables on seedling
presence. To identify biotic and abiotic factors associated with
seedling presence, we ﬁrst selected candidate variables by step-
wise regression and then tested them in multivariate GLMs.

Candidate variables included plot-level vegetation data and site
characteristics, ground cover data, CWD, presence of and distance
to nurse objects and seed trees, years since burning, and climate
variables. We avoided using intercorrelated variables (p value
<0.05) in the models. To select variables, we conducted stepwise
regression models (add 1) in R with seedling presence (1) and
absence (0) as responses and with all candidate independent vari-
ables, in addition to planting treatment. We used the selected vari-
ables in a binomial GLM with random effects for plot pairs, which
were nested within unit, which were nested within site. We ran
these models on data pooled over both planted plots and
unplanted plots, for planted plots only, and for unplanted plots
only.
3. Results
3.1. Post-ﬁre vegetation characteristics
Post-ﬁre vegetation characteristics of each site are summarized
in Table 4. Over all sites, basal area of overstory ponderosa pine
was no more than 2.1 m2 ha1, and basal area of overstory tree spe-
cies was no more than 3.6 m2 ha1. Average canopy cover by
shrubs ranged between 1.7% (Ponil Fire) and 63.8% (Indian Fire).
Litter cover ranged between 17% (Pine Canyon Fire) and 87%
(Viveash Fire). Grass cover ranged between 0% (Indian Fire) and
7% (Pine Canyon Fire). Forb cover ranged between 0% (Indian
Fire) and 4.6% (Borrego Fire). Course woody debris ranged between
17 metric tons ha1 (Indian Fire) and 86 metric tons ha1 (Viveash
Fire).
3.2. Effect of planting on seedling presence and density and factors
associated with seedling presence
Planting had a signiﬁcant positive effect (p < 0.001) on seedling
presence in a GLM model on data pooled across all plots (Table 5).
A paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that planted plots had
greater seedling density than unplanted plots (p < 0.001) for
pooled data across all sites. A signiﬁcant interaction between
planting treatment and site in the GLM model for seedling density
(p < 0.001) showed that the effect of planting differed among sites.
Two sites, Indian and Pine Canyon, had no seedlings in planted or
unplanted plots (Fig. 1). Of the six sites with seedlings, seedling
density was greater in planted than unplanted plots at ﬁve sites
(Fig. 1). The exception was the Borrego Fire, which had almost
three times higher seedling density in unplanted plots than
planted plots, and planted plots had two times the average density
of planted plots at other sites.
For data pooled over planted plots and unplanted plots, seedling
presence
was
positively
associated
with
planting
treatment
(p < 0.001),
years
since
ﬁre
(p = 0.0333),
and
forb
cover
(p = 0.009). For planted plots, seedling presence was positively
associated
with
forb
cover
(p = 0.0089)
and
litter
cover
(p = 0.0297). For unplanted plots, seedling presence was positively
associated with litter cover (p = 0.0491) (Table 5).
3.3. Site regeneration and survival of planted seedlings
Seedling density ranged between 0 and 7750 seedlings ha1
across all plots and all sites, between 0 and 520 (SE 211) on planted
sites, and between 0 and 1433 (SE 1270) on unplanted sites.
Average whorl counts ranged between 7.8 and 11.8 on sites with
seedlings and the average number of seedlings with nurse objects
ranged between 21% and 79% (Table 6).
Seedling
survival
based
on
our
counts
in
2013
and
manager-reported planting density ranged from 0% to 70% among
sites (Fig. 2). Average survival across all sites was 25% (SE 8).
Survival was 0% at the Pine Canyon and Indian Fires and ranged
between 12% and 70% among the other six sites (Fig. 2). Average
site-level seedling survival (n = 8) was signiﬁcantly and positively
related to forb cover (r2 = 0.77; p < 0.001), whereas all other rela-
tionships with site-level physical and vegetation characteristics
were weak and not signiﬁcant.
4. Discussion
Our results suggest that half of post-ﬁre reforestation projects
in Arizona and New Mexico that planted ponderosa pine seedlings
were successful at establishing enough seedlings to likely produce
target amounts of mature trees. Results of the generalized linear
models supported the paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test results
by showing a signiﬁcant effect of planting on seedling density.
The other half of projects failed to establish enough seedlings, or
in one case, planted seedlings on a site that eventually had ample
natural regeneration. At most sites, however, natural regeneration
during the ﬁrst decade after burning did not produce enough seed-
lings. Below we explain and discuss our results and conclusions in
more detail.
Whorl counts, which we used as a proxy for seedling age (Haire
and McGarigal, 2010), showed that the vast majority of seedlings at
all sites established after burning. It is possible that seedlings in
planted plots originated both from planting and natural regenera-
tion. Distinguishing planted from naturally regenerated trees in
burned areas can be difﬁcult (Savage and Mast, 2005). Seedling
age based on whorl counts in planted plots was within one year

of manager-reported planting years for the Borrego, Lake, and
Viveash Fires, and was 1–3 years older than reported planting
years for the Montoya, Ponil, and Rodeo–Chediski Fires. This differ-
ence between whorl counts and planting year is expected given
that seedlings were one or two years old at the time of planting,
and because whorl counts provide an approximate estimation of
seedling age.
We found similarity and difference in biotic and abiotic factors
associated with post-ﬁre seedling establishment between planted
and unplanted plots. Time since ﬁre was positively associated with
seedling presence for all plots. Litter cover was positively associ-
ated with seedling presence in planted and unplanted plots. This
result is consistent with earlier reports of positive effects from
scorched needles or dead grass on soil moisture and seedling
recruitment (Schubert et al., 1970; Pannkuk and Robichaud,
2003; Bonnet et al., 2005; Heidmann, 2008). Litter and other
non-competitive ground covers can ameliorate the severe temper-
ature ﬂuctuations that occur in the post-ﬁre environment, reduce
frost-heaving, and improve moisture retention (Heidmann, 2008).
We discovered a positive association between forb cover and seed-
ling presence for planted plots, but not for unplanted plots. A pos-
itive inﬂuence of forb cover on seedling presence is inconsistent
with earlier research that reported inference with establishment
of ponderosa pine seedlings by herbaceous plants (Schubert
et al., 1970; Bonnet et al., 2005). At our study sites where forb
cover was low (<5%), forbs appeared to facilitate rather than
impede the establishment of planted seedlings. Negative relation-
ships between ponderosa pine seedling occurrence and herbaceous
cover have been reported at higher cover (>10%) than occurred in
our study (Bonnet et al., 2005). Thus, it is likely that the amount
of herbaceous cover on our sites did not surpass a competitive
threshold. Another interpretation of our results is that site condi-
tions conducive to tree seedling establishment also were con-
ducive to forb establishment and recovery after burning.
Our results show variable success in establishing ponderosa
pine by planting into severely burned sites in the southwestern
U.S. between 2004 and 2008. Survival of planted seedlings varied
between 0% and 70% and averaged 25% (SE 8) among the eight sites
we investigated. This result is based on seedling density measured
in 2013 (ﬁve to eight years after planting) and manager-reported
planting density across all planting units on a given site. Actual
planted density may have been lower than reported density due
to skipping over unplantable areas. Furthermore, plot size and
number of plots may have limited our ability to accurately mea-
sure survival. Nonetheless, the range of seedling survival we mea-
sured over sites (0–70%) is plausible considering that some
plantings are highly successful and others are complete failures.
Our estimated survivorship of ponderosa pine seedlings planted
after severe wildﬁre in Arizona and New Mexico for the period of
ﬁve to eight years after planting is lower than reported for the
Cone Fire in northern California (30–96% over all plots) ten years
after planting (Ritchie and Knapp, 2014). This comparison suggests
lower survival of planted ponderosa pine seedlings in Arizona and
New Mexico than in other regions. Seedling survival in our study
may have been reduced by drought, as precipitation was 83–88%
of 30-year-normals when averaged across all years since burning.
Our results are a caution to forest managers that establishing
ponderosa pine by planting after severe ﬁres in the southwestern
U.S. is a challenge and that failures are to be expected. Three of
eight, or 38% of sites, had 0–12% survival of planted seedlings,
and, of those, two had 0% survival. We suspect that harsh site con-
ditions played a role in the total failure of plantings at the Indian
and Pine Canyon Fires. The Pine Canyon planting units we surveyed
were located in a transition zone between ponderosa pine forest
and drier piñon-juniper woodland. At the Indian Fire, sprouting
woody species averaged 60% cover and may have provided intense
competition with planted seedlings. Also, soil at the Indian Fire
was a well-drained granitic residuum and coarse sandy loam,
which may have reduced soil water available to seedlings, and
reforestation potential was rated low (Robbie, 1992). The Viveash
Fire,
where
seedling
survival
was
only
12%,
also
had
granite-derived soil and reforestation potential rated as low.
Future research about survival of planted seedlings in the south-
western U.S. should investigate factors that we did not address
due to lack of data, such as seed source, seedling stock type, storage
conditions and duration, planting site selection, and salvage
logging.
Natural regeneration by ponderosa pine at the severely burned
sites in our study was less successful and more variable over sites
than artiﬁcial regeneration. Seedling density produced by natural
regeneration in the seven to ten years after burning was zero at
two sites, and less than 50 trees ha1 at ﬁve of the remaining six
sites. In contrast, natural regeneration produced about 1500 trees
ha1 at one site (Borrego). Our ﬁnding of variable natural regener-
ation of ponderosa pine after severe burning is consistent with ear-
lier reports (Bonnet et al., 2005; Savage and Mast, 2005; Haire and
McGarigal, 2010; Roccaforte et al., 2012). Natural regeneration of
ponderosa pine in burned areas typically requires over one decade
when seed trees are 100 m or more away (Bonnet et al., 2005;
Haire and McGarigal, 2010). Heavy natural regeneration of pon-
derosa pine within one decade after burning, which we docu-
mented only at the Borrego Fire, is uncommon based on our
measurements at eight burned sites. Proliﬁc natural regeneration
at the Borrego Fire likely resulted from high seed production and
dispersal by trees that survived the ﬁre, and favorable conditions
for seedling establishment, which require further investigation.
Our ﬁnding that ponderosa pine seedling presence increased
with time since burning is consistent with other studies of
post-ﬁre
conifer
regeneration
(Cormier,
1990;
Haire
and
McGarigal, 2010; Huffman et al., 2012), and suggests that seedling
densities at our study sites may increase in the future due to fur-
ther natural regeneration. Yet, climate warming and increasing
aridity in the southwestern U.S. may constrain further natural
regeneration. Climate-envelope models predict a contraction of

ponderosa pine’s range in the southwestern U.S. over the next cen-
tury (Rehfeldt et al., 2014). Future climate warming combined with
severe burning is expected to narrow the occurrence of environ-
mental conditions conducive to ponderosa pine regeneration
(Feddema et al., 2013; Savage et al., 2013). Natural regeneration
of ponderosa pine is sparse in drier parts of its range in the south-
western U.S. (Puhlick et al., 2012) and the entire region is expected
to become more arid (Seager et al., 2007; Williams et al., 2013).
Thus, the amount of natural regeneration of ponderosa pine we
documented after severe burning for the period of 2004–2008
may be rarer in the future.
Given that many current forest health problems in ponderosa
pine forests of the southwestern U.S. result from a high density
of
trees
that
established
in
the
early
1900s
(Savage
and
Swetnam, 1990; Covington et al., 1997; Allen et al., 2002), seedling
densities in stands recovering from severe burning should be care-
fully considered. Too few seedlings may result in long-term con-
version of ponderosa pine forests to grass- or
shrub-lands
(Savage and Mast, 2005; Roccaforte et al., 2012). In contrast, too
many seedlings could produce overly dense stands and heavy fuels
that are partly responsible for current widespread intense wildﬁres
and other forest health problems.
Contemporary forest restoration projects in southwestern pon-
derosa pine forests prescribe 56–138 mature trees ha1 based on
historical range of variation and restoration ecology principles
(Reynolds et al., 2013). Survival of ponderosa pine seedlings from
the 5th to the 50th year after planting averaged 44% at the Fort
Valley Experimental Forest in northern Arizona (DeWald and
Mahalovich, 2008). Based on this survival percent, four of eight
sites in our study (Lakes, Montoya, Ponil, Viveash) have a seedling
density in planted plots (125–240 ha1) that will produce a density
of mature trees (55–106 ha1) close to the target density.
In contrast, planting at three sites did not establish enough
seedlings to produce desired density of mature trees. Current den-
sity of planted seedlings in the areas we sampled at the Rodeo–
Chediski Fire is expected to produce a density of mature trees

(44 ha1) 21% below the desired target. Total mortality of all
planted seedlings and absence of natural regeneration at the
Indian and Pine Canyon Fires strongly suggest they will be deﬁ-
cient in mature trees in the foreseeable future.
Natural regeneration in unplanted plots during the ﬁrst decade
after burning in our study did not produce a range of seedling den-
sity consistent with desired numbers of mature trees at any site.
Two sites (Indian, Pine Canyon) had no naturally established seed-
lings, and ﬁve sites (Lakes, Montoya, Ponil, Rodeo–Chediski,
Viveash) had seedling density (3–33 ha1) that is currently too
low to produce the target number of mature trees, assuming 44%
survive to year 50. Current density of planted (520 ha1) and nat-
urally established (1434 ha1) seedlings at the Borrego Fire will
produce an overstocked stand, with 229 mature trees ha1
expected in planted plots and 631 ha1 expected in unplanted
plots. High density of ponderosa pine seedlings, produced by abun-
dant natural regeneration or overplanting, will require subsequent
thinning or prescribed burning to reduce tree density, fuels, and
risk of another severe wildﬁre (Agee and Skinner, 2005; Finney
et al., 2006; Fulé et al., 2012; Shive et al., 2013).
In summary, we found wide variation in survival of ponderosa
pine seedlings planted at eight sites in Arizona and New Mexico
that had been severely burned between 2002 and 2005. Seedling
density in planted plots was consistent with the desired target
density of mature trees based on historical range of variability
and restoration ecology principles at four of eight sites (50%),
below the target at three sites, and above the target at one site
where natural regeneration was proliﬁc. Naturally regenerated
seedlings occurred at six of eight sites (75%) within the ﬁrst decade
after burning, but current density at all but one site is below
amounts needed to produce the target density of mature trees.
Predictions of increasing forest ﬁres and climate warming (Liu
et al., 2010; Flannigan et al., 2013; Williams et al., 2013; Xu
et al., 2013) emphasize the importance of directing resources for
tree planting to severely burned sites that have little potential
for natural seedling establishment, yet acceptable potential for sur-
vival of planted seedlings. Future research should build on our
ﬁndings with investigations that increase understanding of the
numbers of established seedlings needed to produce desired den-
sity and spatial pattern of mature trees, as well as site and ﬁre
characteristics and management actions that promote natural
regeneration and increase survival of planted seedlings.
