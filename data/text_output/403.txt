Abstract.
In western North American conifer forests, wildﬁres are increasing in frequency
and severity due to heavy fuel loads that have accumulated after a century of ﬁre suppression.
Forest restoration treatments (e.g., thinning and/or burning) are being designed and
implemented at large spatial and temporal scales in an effort to reduce ﬁre risk and restore
forest structure and function. In ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests, predominantly
open forest structure and a frequent, low-severity ﬁre regime constituted the evolutionary
environment for wildlife that persisted for thousands of years. Small mammals are important
in forest ecosystems as prey and in affecting primary production and decomposition. During
2006–2009, we trapped eight species of small mammals at 294 sites in northern Arizona and
used occupancy modeling to determine community responses to thinning and habitat features.
The most important covariates in predicting small mammal occupancy were understory
vegetation cover, large snags, and treatment. Our analysis identiﬁed two generalist species
found at relatively high occupancy rates across all sites, four open-forest species that
responded positively to treatment, and two dense-forest species that responded negatively to
treatment unless speciﬁc habitat features were retained. Our results indicate that all eight small
mammal species can beneﬁt from restoration treatments, particularly if aspects of their
evolutionary environment (e.g., large trees, snags, woody debris) are restored. The occupancy
modeling approach we used resulted in precise species-level estimates of occupancy in response
to habitat attributes for a greater number of small mammal species than in other comparable
studies. We recommend our approach for other studies faced with high variability and broad
spatial and temporal scales in assessing impacts of treatments or habitat alteration on wildlife
species. Moreover, since forest planning efforts are increasingly focusing on progressively
larger treatment implementation, better and more efﬁciently obtained ecological information
is needed to inform these efforts.

INTRODUCTION
Ecological restoration is the process of recovering an
ecosystem that has degraded, often due to human
pressures and disturbance (Society for Ecological
Restoration International Science and Policy Working
Group 2004). Restoration projects are among the most
extensive conservation efforts worldwide, and are being
implemented at increasingly larger scales (Holl et al.
2003) because (1) of the sheer size of degraded areas,
such as tropical forests (Lamb et al. 2005); (2) of the
complexity and scale of the degrading factors, such as
with coral reef loss (Gardner et al. 2003); and (3) many
ecological processes occur at the landscape scale, such as
migration, dispersal, and hydrologic and nutrient cycles
(Noss 1990, Saunders et al. 1991). Dry conifer forests
across western North America have been degrading
since at least 1890, when Euro-American settlement
introduced multiple ongoing pressures, such as ﬁre
suppression, grazing, and logging (Covington and
Moore 1994b). These pressures have contributed to
forest stands with high densities of small-diameter trees
and heavy fuel loads (Taylor and Skinner 1998, Fry and
Stephens 2006), in which wildﬁres are increasing in
frequency and severity (Westerling et al. 2006).
To reduce the threat of stand-replacing wildﬁre,
ecological restoration treatments are being implemented
in forests that were once ﬁre adapted. The principal
objective of these activities is to restore forests to
presettlement or ‘‘reference’’ conditions using mechan-
ical thinning and burning treatments (hereafter, treat-
ments), after which the natural ﬁre regime can be
reintroduced (Moore et al. 1999, Noss et al. 2006b). The
frequent, low-severity ﬁres that used to occur would

maintain an open forest structure by removing under-
story trees, thereby preventing heavy fuel accumulation
(Fule´ et al. 1997, Everett et al. 2000). These treatments
are also an effort to restore overall ecosystem function,
by increasing rates of decomposition and nutrient
cycling, water availability, carbon storage, plant biodi-
versity, and populations of native wildlife species (Allen
et al. 2002, Finkral and Evans 2008, Boerner et al. 2009,
Schwilk et al. 2009). As wildﬁre risk and associated
economic costs escalate (Snider et al. 2006), restoration
treatments are being implemented at increasingly larger
scales in the western United States. For example, as part
of the 2010 Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration
Project (Omnibus Public Land Management Act 2009),
nine national forests across the West are planning
treatments at scales of tens of thousands of hectares. As
the size and pace of treatments increase, scientists and
stakeholders need information on the effectiveness of
treatments in restoring multiple ecosystem components,
including wildlife, at large temporal and spatial scales
(Sisk et al. 2006).
Measuring the success of restoration usually involves
comparing restored sites to reference conditions. In the
absence of data on reference conditions for wildlife
populations as a baseline, approximating the evolution-
ary environment is likely the best approach for restoring
wildlife populations (MacMahon and Jordan 1994,
Moore et al. 1999). The evolutionary environment is
deﬁned as the range of abiotic and biotic conditions that
have exerted selection pressure on and are critical to the
survival of wildlife populations (Noss and Csuti 1994).
Particularly at large scales, restoring the evolutionary
environment may be more feasible than trying to meet
speciﬁc habitat requirements for single or small groups
of species (Moore et al. 1999, Lindenmayer et al. 2002).
In ﬁre-adapted conifer forests across western North
America, wildlife likely was adapted to ﬁre regimes that
altered habitat at multiple spatial and temporal scales
(Kennedy and Fontaine 2009). The subsequent degra-
dation of these forests has reduced horizontal and
structural diversity of habitat, which has had negative
consequences for wildlife species dependent on the
evolutionary environment (Carey 2003). At the same
time, some species have expanded their ranges since
presettlement times and are now dependent on dense
forests (Battin and Sisk 2003, Chambers and Germaine
2003). For example, Brown and Davis (1998) deter-
mined that 34 grassland animal species have experienced
extirpation or reduction of their ranges, and 55 forest
species have expanded their ranges since 1890 in the
American Southwest.
Small mammal community composition varies across
ﬁre adapted conifer forests, but typically includes tree
squirrels (Sciurus sp.), ground squirrels (Spermophilus
sp.), voles (Microtus and Clethrionomys sp.), gophers
(Thomomys sp.), chipmunks (Tamias sp.), mice (Pe-
romyscus sp.), woodrats (Neotoma sp.), and shrews
(Sorex sp.; Kays and Wilson 2002, Converse et al. 2006c,
Zwolak 2009). In forest ecosystems, small mammals are
important for recycling nutrients by processing vegeta-
tion, dispersing fungal spores and seeds, and aerating
and turning soils while digging (Cork and Kenagy 1989,
Boal and Mannan 1994). They also provide a substan-
tial part of the prey base for multiple mammalian and
avian predators, including federally threatened northern
and Mexican spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina
and S. o. lucida; Rosenberg et al. 2003, Block et al.
2005). The small body sizes and high reproductive rates
of small mammals result in populations that generally
respond quickly to disturbance and habitat alteration
(MacArthur and Wilson 1967, Brown and Ernest 2002).
Thus, small mammals can be indicators of changes to
forest structure that result from restoration treatments.
For species within a given functional group, we would
expect to see both positive and negative responses to
treatment (e.g., Dickson et al. 2009, Kalies et al. 2010),
since each species necessarily occupies a unique habitat
niche (MacArthur and Levins 1967, Converse et al.
2006a). However, the only large-scale small mammal
study examining responses to restoration treatments in
conifer stands found mostly neutral responses to
thinning at the genus and species level (Converse et al.
2006c).
In the Southwest, reference conditions are particularly
well understood (Cooper 1960, White 1985, Fule´ et al.
1997). In ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests,
which cover .12 million hectares of western North
America, the evolutionary environment persisted from
about 10 000 years ago, when ponderosa pine trees
retreated to the high plateaus and mountains following
the last glacial period, up until approximately 1890,
which brought Euro-American settlement and associat-
ed land management impacts (Covington 2003). This
environment included a frequent, low-severity ﬁre
regime and open forest structure; additionally, a
diversity of habitat components including clumps of
Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii), snags, and down wood,
were probably created and maintained by ﬁre in a
patchy distribution (Spies and Turner 1999). We
investigated the response of the small mammal commu-
nity to large-scale forest restoration treatments in
ponderosa pine forests in Arizona, and speciﬁcally to
components of the evolutionary environment. We
hypothesized that the occupancy rates for golden-
mantled ground squirrels (Spermophilus lateralis), Mo-
gollon voles (Microtus mogollonensis), and pocket
gophers (Thomomys bottae) would respond positively
to treatment and/or open forest structure; tassel-eared
squirrels (Sciurus aberti) would respond negatively as
dense-forest obligates; and Mexican woodrats (Neotoma
mexicana), gray-collared chipmunks (Tamias cinereicol-
lis), deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), and rock
squirrels (Spermophilus variegates) would be tied to
other habitat components including down wood, slash,
snags, shrubs, oak, and rocks (Table 1). We also
hypothesized that no single treatment type would beneﬁt

all species, but the community perspective would reveal
tradeoffs (positive and negative responses) among
species in response to habitat alteration.
Large-scale design and implementation of forest
restoration treatments necessitates a habitat-focused,
multi-species approach to wildlife management and
monitoring, due to the time and cost required by
single-species approaches (Lambeck 1997, Lindenmayer
et al. 2002). We used occupancy modeling, an analytical
technique that allows for a rapid assessment of multiple
sites, yielding probabilities of occupancy rather than
information on population dynamics, such as survival,
reproduction, and population size (MacKenzie et al.
2006). This technique has lesser demands for ﬁeld data,
and may be more appropriate for assessing multiple
wildlife responses to habitat alteration at large spatial
and temporal scales compared to traditional mark–
recapture methods. Our speciﬁc objectives were to (1)

and collectively, (2) make inferences from the relation-
ships between key attributes and species occupancy to
better inform management decisions, and (3) assess the
efﬁcacy of occupancy modeling by determining if

METHODS
Study area
One study area was located on the Coconino National
Forest, 8 km southwest of Flagstaff, Arizona, in the
ponderosa pine-dominated forests of the wildland-urban
interface (Fig. 1). Historically, this 18 500-ha area
experienced a variety of forest management practices,
including selective harvest (100þ years ago), commercial
thinning (11–23 years ago, average 17.3), fuels reduction
and restoration treatments (1–7 years ago, average 2.9),
and no treatment. We established an additional 4800-ha
study area on the Kaibab National Forest north of
Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona, to capture
additional untreated forested areas. Within a geographic
information system (GIS; ArcGIS v9.3, ESRI, Red-
lands, California, USA), we overlaid a 500-m resolution
lattice on both study areas to locate prospective
sampling points. We eliminated points that fell within
private lands and non-forested patches .1 ha, or were
located .500 m from a road. From the remaining
points, we randomly selected 110 sampling points (100
on the Coconino, 10 on the Kaibab), with approximate-
ly half in recent (,10 years) treatments and half with
older (.11 years) or no treatments, and then located and
permanently marked them in the ﬁeld using a global
positioning system. All treatments consisted of mechan-
ical harvest (not ﬁre) and resulted in a range of forest
structure conditions determined by the initial prescrip-
tions and methods of implementation, which varied
greatly across the study areas; thus, we focused on time
since treatment, density of trees removed, and resulting
basal area as the primary metrics to describe treatments.
Data collection
Small mammal sampling.—We used each of the 110
sampling points as the center of a trapping ‘‘site.’’ At
each site we centered a 5 3 5 square trap grid which
consisted of 25 Sherman traps (model LNATDG; H. B.
Sherman Traps, Tallahassee, Florida, USA) with 20-m
spacing, with a 3 3 3 grid overlaid with nine Tomahawk
traps (model 202; Tomahawk Live Trap, Hazelhurst,
Wisconsin, USA), one at every other grid intersection.
Including a 20-m buffer around the trap grid, total site
sampling area was 14 400 m2 (1.4 ha). We trapped small
mammals at each site during the summers of 2006–2009,
over a 10-week period between late June and late
August. We left both Sherman and Tomahawk traps
open overnight, but closed the Sherman traps during the
day to prevent animals from overheating. We checked
traps twice daily over a three-day period, which resulted
in three nighttime and three daytime trapping sessions.
We sampled for Botta’s pocket gopher presence using an
open-hole test, disturbing all gopher mounds located at
the site with a shovel; we considered the species to be
present if a mound was repaired within 24 hours
(Smallwood and Erickson 1995). We attempted to assess
all terrestrial small mammal species (,3000 g) but were
unable to detect lagomorphs or shrews. We determined
the number of surveys and relevant habitat and
detection covariates at each site using data from our
ﬁrst year (2006).
Vegetation sampling.—We established an 11.3 m
radius circular overstory plot (400 m2) at the site center
and measured slope (degrees), total number of stumps,
and species and diameter at breast height (dbh) for trees
1.4 m tall. At the site center, we also established a
subplot of 3.6 m radius (40 m2), within which we
assessed species, percent cover, and height class for
herbaceous plants, shrubs, and trees ,1.4 m. At each
subplot and in four additional 40-m2 plots (located on
the trapping grid at each cardinal direction), we
measured the relative percent cover of bare ground,
stumps and coarse woody debris, litter, and rocks. At
the site center, we established a 20-m transect in a
random direction and along it recorded the width of
each piece of wood .7.5 cm (Brown et al. 1982). Within
the entire site, we counted the number of slash piles, and
used our observations and state and federal historical
records to determine the age of each treatment and the
number of years the slash piles were intact before being
burned, which always occurred within four years of
thinning treatment. All vegetation sampling was con-
ducted in June of each year, immediately prior to small
mammal sampling activities.
Data analysis
Habitat and detection covariates.—At each site, we
quantiﬁed overstory and understory characteristics that
we hypothesized could affect occupancy (hereafter, our
‘‘habitat covariates’’), based on the existing literature
and our own ﬁeld observations. For each site, we
calculated slope, pine and oak basal area (m2/ha), large
tree density (.40, .50, and .60 cm dbh classes;
number/ha), snag density (all snags and .40, .50,
.60 cm dbh classes; number/ha), and the proportion of
trees removed by any method of harvesting (Table 1).
We also calculated understory plant species richness,
percent of vegetation .40 cm in height (i.e., shrub
cover), average percent cover of each substrate, and
volume of down wood. We determined the number of
slash piles/site, the number of years piles were left intact,
and the time (years) since treatment. We also calculated
treatment size using maps of the treatment areas
provided by the implementing federal and state agencies,
or by delineating the treatment area using aerial photos
and ArcGIS. For each species, we pooled detection
histories from all four years of sampling and used ‘‘year’’

as a covariate (sensu Rodhouse et al. 2010). We used a
binary covariate that discriminated the two study areas
(North Kaibab and Coconino).
Covariates that we hypothesized could cause hetero-
geneity in detection probability (hereafter, our ‘‘detec-
tion covariates’’) included temperature, precipitation,
year, week, and survey (deﬁned as which of the three
days the site was sampled). Temperature and precipita-
tion can affect activity levels and trapability of animals
(Getz 1961). Year and week can capture this variability
plus other attributes that are difﬁcult to measure, such
as changing resource availability and moon phase.
Survey is important because some species will avoid
traps after ﬁrst capture, while others will continue to
visit the traps for food and shelter (Getz 1961). We
attempted to control for weather-related covariates by
timing the trapping session to occur after the beginning
of the monsoons; however, we still considered as
detection covariates the maximum daily temperature,
minimum daily temperature, average daily humidity,
and average daily precipitation that was recorded prior
to the day or night sampling session. We obtained these
data from stations 30–50 km away from each study area.
We standardized all continuous habitat and detection
covariates, and diagnosed univariate correlations and
multicolinearity using a correlation matrix and variance
inﬂation factors (VIF), respectively. When we observed
univariate correlations .0.60, or VIF .10.0 (Neter et al.
1996), we combined these covariates using a principal
components analysis (PCA; implemented in JMP V8.0,
SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA).
Preliminary analyses of covariates.—Using PCA, we
combined four covariates into two (Table 1). We created
a new covariate ‘‘treatment’’ (eigenvalue ¼ 1.6, explain-
ing 80.0% of the total variance) which represents a range
from old treatments that were selectively harvested or
thinned at low intensity (in preparation for commercial
harvest) with relatively few trees removed per hectare
(negative values), to recent fuels reduction or restoration
treatments with more trees removed per
hectare
(positive values). The new covariate ‘‘slash’’ (eigenvalue
¼ 1.5, explaining 74.6% of the total variance) represents
a range from no or few slash piles left onsite for a very
short period of time (negative values), to many slash
piles left on the ground for up to three years (positive
values).
We also assessed correlations between detection
covariates and found that week, survey, and year were
correlated with maximum and minimum temperature,
humidity, and precipitation. Since week, survey, and
year encompass climatic conditions and other environ-
mental conditions that are difﬁcult to measure, we
omitted the climatic covariates from further analysis.
Occupancy modeling and multi-model inference.—
Simple, or ‘‘naı¨ve,’’ estimates of occupancy can be
calculated for a given site by dividing the total number
of detections at that site by the total number of surveys;
however, most species are detected imperfectly, so this
method can result in more biased estimates than those
that account for detection probability and habitat
covariates (MacKenzie et al. 2006). For each small
mammal species detected on our sites, we used the single
season occupancy modeling framework of MacKenzie
et al. (2006) to estimate both detection probability,
deﬁned as the probability of detecting the species at a
site if it is present, and occupancy, deﬁned as the
expected probability that a given site is occupied. We
used year as a covariate, and assumed that all sites have
the same probability of being occupied regardless of
their occupancy state in the previous year.
In order to focus on the covariates that most
inﬂuenced occupancy for multiple species, and to avoid
overparameterizing our models (e.g., see Moore and
Swihart 2005), we reduced our list of habitat covariates
by building univariate models of each covariate and
comparing each model against the null (i.e., intercept-
only) model of occupancy for each species using
Akaike’s information criterion adjusted for small sample
sizes (AICc; Burnham and Anderson 2002). We ranked
model importance from highest to lowest according to
differences (D) in their AICc values, and retained the
covariate from any model that had a lower DAICc value
than the null model for at least three species. We
conducted these analyses using Program PRESENCE
(version 2.4; Hines 2009).
Using the 10 retained covariates plus the study area
covariate (for all species detected at both study areas),
we constructed models for all subsets of covariates (n ¼
1025 subsets) for each species using Program MARK
(White and Burnham 2010). We computed AICc values,
DAICc values, and AIC weights (wij, weight of covariate
i for species j; Burnham and Anderson 2002). We ranked
relative covariate importance by summing the AIC
weights across all models in which a given covariate
occurred, and used cumulative weights to rank relative
covariate importance for each species. Since the larger
the wij the more important covariate i is, relative to the
other variables (Burnham and Anderson 2002), we
considered wij  0.50 indicative of a strong species
occupancy response to the covariate (Barbieri and
Berger 2004), 0.50  wij  0.30 a moderate response,
and wij  0.30 a weak response. For each covariate, we
averaged wij across small mammal species to estimate its
community-level importance (Dickson et al. 2009). We
also calculated model-averaged parameter estimates for
each covariate to assess the direction of the response by
each species and the community as a whole.
Spatial autocorrelation.—We investigated local-scale
spatial autocorrelation in our site-level presence–ab-
sence data using logistic regression models for all
species, for each year and region. These models included
the 10 habitat covariates considered in our occupancy
analyses. We used the GLIMMIX and VARIOGRAM
procedures in SAS to estimate the residuals in each
model, and used a Moran’s I statistic (Z) to determine if
statistically signiﬁcant (P , 0.05) spatial structuring was

present in our data. Only three of 30 models resulted in a
statistically signiﬁcant Z value. Thus, we decided that
explicitly accounting for spatial autocorrelation in our
occupancy models would overly complicate our ability
to interpret the estimates and relative importance of our
covariates, when little or no residual spatial structure
was present in our data.
RESULTS
Small mammal sampling
Due to various logistical issues that occurred each
year (e.g., impassable roads, areas closed due to ﬁre risk,
excessive heat), sampling effort varied among years. We
sampled 19 sites in 2006 (pilot year), 96 in 2007, 96 in
2008, and 83 in 2009 (n ¼ 294). In each year, we detected
the Mogollon vole, Mexican woodrat, deer mouse,
tassel-eared squirrel, golden-mantled ground squirrel,
rock squirrel, gray-collared chipmunk, and Botta’s
pocket gopher.
Detection probabilities
Detection probabilities for the eight species of small
mammals ranged from 0.3 to 0.9 over four years (Fig. 2),
which are considered adequate for occupancy analysis
(MacKenzie and Royle 2005). The most parsimonious
models of detection probability included the following
covariates: survey for the golden-mantled ground
squirrel, year for the deer mouse and tassel-eared
squirrel, week for the Mogollon vole and Botta’s pocket
gopher, and none (null models) for the Mexican
woodrat, rock squirrel, and gray-collared chipmunk.
Preliminary habitat covariate analyses
Our analysis identiﬁed nine covariates that did not
perform better than the null model for at least three
species, including treatment size, understory vegetation
.40 cm high (percent shrub cover), understory vegeta-
tion species richness, slope, downed wood volume, two
size classes of large trees, and two size classes of snags
(Table 2). Thus, we retained 10 habitat covariates: pine
basal area (m2/ha), oak basal area (m2/ha), understory
vegetation (percent cover), rock (percent cover), large
tree density (number of trees .50 cm dbh/ha), snag
density (number of snags/ha), large snag density
(number of snags .40 cm dbh/ha), slash, treatment,
and year (Table 2). Pine basal area and understory
vegetation were not highly correlated (0.32) as other
factors can affect understory vegetation cover, including
livestock grazing which we did not otherwise quantify.
Occupancy probabilities
Forest structure was described in terms of pine basal
area, understory vegetation cover, oak basal area, and
large trees. Sites with higher pine basal area and lower
understory vegetation cover were associated with a
positive occupancy response from only tassel-eared
squirrels and Mexican woodrats; rock squirrels respond-
ed negatively to both pine basal area and understory
vegetation, but positively to oak basal area (Table 3).
Golden-mantled ground squirrels, Mogollon voles,
Botta’s pocket gophers, gray-collared chipmunks, and
deer mice responded negatively in terms of occupancy to
pine basal area and positively to vegetation cover (i.e.,
open forest structure; Table 3). All responses were
moderate or strong. Three species responded strongly to
oak basal area (rock squirrels, positively; Mogollon
voles and golden-mantled ground squirrels, negatively),
and two moderately (tassel-eared squirrel, positively;
deer mouse, negatively; Table 3). Large tree (.50 cm
dbh) density elicited the most consistent response across
species of all the covariates; all but Mogollon voles
responded positively, with all species exhibiting moder-
ate to strong responses (Table 3).
Five species (golden-mantled ground squirrel, Mo-
gollon vole, gray-collared chipmunk, deer mouse, rock
squirrel) responded positively in terms of occupancy to
treatment, and three responded negatively (Botta’s
pocket gopher, tassel-eared squirrel, Mexican woodrat);
all responses were moderate or strong (Table 3). Only
Botta’s pocket gopher has a consistent response to both
pine basal area and treatment; i.e., it responded
positively to open forest structural conditions, but
negatively to the treatment that reduces tree basal area
and density.
Other habitat covariates assessed included slash,
snags, and rock cover. All species but two (gray-collared
chipmunk and rock squirrel) responded positively in
terms of occupancy to slash quantity and duration,
although only tassel-eared squirrels and Mexican wood-
rats demonstrated a moderate response and golden-
mantled ground squirrels a strong response (Table 3).
Only one species responded strongly to snag density
(gray-collared chipmunks; negatively) and three moder-
ately (Botta’s pocket gopher, tassel-eared squirrel,
Mexican woodrat; negatively), but ﬁve species responded
strongly to large snag (.40 cm dbh) density (Mogollon
vole, gray-collared chipmunk, deer mouse, positively;
golden-mantled ground squirrels and rock squirrels,
negatively; Table 3). Two species responded strongly to
rock cover (Mogollon voles and deer mice, positively)
and four moderately (Mexican woodrat, positively;
golden-mantled ground squirrel, Botta’s pocket gopher,
tassel-eared squirrel, negatively; Table 3).
Golden-mantled ground squirrels and rock squirrels
had strong occupancy responses to year, and Mogollon
voles, tassel-eared squirrels, gray-collared chipmunks,
and deer mice had moderate responses (Table 3). Gray-
collared chipmunks had the highest rates of occupancy
and Mexican woodrats the lowest across all sites (Fig. 3).
Community-level response
For the community, the habitat covariates from most
to least importance (based on average wij) in predicting
occupancy were understory vegetation cover, large snag
density (.40cm dbh), treatment, large tree density
(.50cm dbh), oak basal area, rock cover, pine basal

area, year, slash, and snag density (Table 3). Although
understory vegetation cover was the most important
covariate, we provided occupancy rates in response to
pine basal area as this covariate is most easily
manipulated by managers, and impacts vegetation cover
(Fig. 3).
DISCUSSION AND MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS
Managing ﬁre-adapted forests for the small
mammal community
Large-scale forest restoration does not afford the
luxury of managing wildlife using single species ap-
proaches (Carey 2003). Previous studies on ﬁre adapted
forests found that most members of the small mammal
community exhibited variable and weak responses to
treatment and other habitat attributes (as synthesized by
Converse et al. 2006c), making it difﬁcult to predict
effects at other sites. However, in terms of occupancy,
we found that members of the small mammal commu-
nity were sensitive to treatments and consistent across
sites in their responses to habitat covariates. Across the
community we examined, the most important predictors
of occupancy were understory vegetation, large snags,
and treatment, all which can be managed through
restoration efforts and the control of livestock grazing.
Furthermore, most small mammal species (ﬁve of eight;
Mogollon vole, deer mouse, golden-mantled ground
squirrel, rock squirrel, Botta’s pocket gopher) responded
strongly and positively to at least one feature typical of
open or treated forest, including increased vegetation,
decreased basal area, or treatment. One of these species
(pocket gophers) responded positively to open forest
structure but negatively to treatment, indicating sensi-
tivity to disturbance caused by restoration in the short
term. In addition, we identiﬁed two forest generalists
(deer mice, gray-collared chipmunks) that were common
across sites and responded positively to treatments. Past
studies have indicated mostly neutral responses to
treatments by these genera, likely because certain habitat
elements, such as down wood and snags, respond
variably to treatment (as synthesized by Converse
et al. 2006c). By ranking the relative response of animals
to habitat covariates, we found that chipmunks and deer
mice responded positively to open forest structure and
thinning, but more strongly to rocks, big trees, and large
snags, indicating that these features are more important
to the species than treatment.
We identiﬁed two species that were associated with
dense forests (tassel-eared squirrels, Mexican woodrats).
In particular, the tassel-eared squirrel (a tree squirrel)
has been highlighted as a species that will be negatively
impacted by forest treatments (Patton et al. 1985, Dodd
et al. 2003, 2006). Tassel-eared squirrels were moder-
ately associated with high basal area and low vegetation
cover, but responded strongly positively only to large
trees, indicating this was its most important habitat
feature. Restoration treatments should promote the
growth of both small and large trees in the long term
by releasing them from competition (Skov et al. 2005),
and thus should eventually ameliorate treatment effects
on reduced squirrel density in this and many similar
forest systems (Carey 2000, Lehmkuhl et al. 2006).
Similarly, woodrats were moderately associated with
dense forest conditions, and responded strongly nega-
tively to restoration treatments. However, they respond-
ed positively to slash piles, which are only found in
treated sites. The number and duration of slash piles

resulted in a positive occupancy response by most of the
small mammal community. This may be because the
animals were using the piles as cover, given that recently
restored sites are often devoid of woody debris,
understory vegetation, and snags in the short term
(Chambers and Germaine 2003). Thus, slash piles may
serve as surrogate habitat, giving the animals an
opportunity to reestablish while the site is otherwise
recovering from disturbance, particularly in the absence
of down wood. The retention of slash piles on the
landscape for several years (piles in our sites were
burned after no more than three years) should lead to
increased occupancy of most members of the small
mammal community. However, because the immediate
removal of these piles can reduce ﬁre hazard, this
concern often supersedes opportunities for wildlife
habitat enhancement in dry forests.
Although our analysis identiﬁed these two species as
the ‘‘losers’’ of restoration treatments, their occupancy
can be increased by retaining or creating critical habitat
features, constituting a reasonable approach to large-
scale management. Thus, choosing one species to
represent the response of a functional group can be
misleading; our ﬁnding that each small mammal species
increased in occupancy in response to some aspect of
restoration treatment demonstrates the beneﬁt of a
community perspective on the implications of spatially
extensive treatments. In addition, creating a variety of
forest structural types on the landscape ensures that the
dense-forest obligates are retained, and is likely to lead
to higher overall species diversity (Noss et al. 2006a).
The occupancy rates we generated in relation to pine
basal area can help managers design treatments with
varying community compositions, and we would expect
similar tradeoffs among these small mammal species or
genera in other ﬁre-adapted forest systems (e.g., see
Zwolak 2009). Understanding wildlife responses at the
community level and across the variability in habitat
that results from treatments can thus assist in efforts to
design large-scale forest management projects.
Restoring the evolutionary environment
Approximating reference conditions is a successful
approach to restoring degraded ecosystems and increas-
ing biodiversity and ecosystem services (Benayas et al.
2009). Since reference conditions for wildlife popula-
tions are difﬁcult to reconstruct, recreating the evolu-

tionary environment is often the default (Morrison
2002). In our study area, southwestern ponderosa pine
forests had a lower density of trees prior to Euro-
American settlement (ca. 1880; Cooper 1960, Moore
et al. 1999), and thus forest species were likely adapted
to an open stand structure dominated by large-diameter
trees and an herbaceous understory (Covington 2003).
We found that all but three species were associated with
increased vegetation cover. Tassel-eared squirrel and
Mexican woodrat occupancy was associated with dense
stands, and it is possible that these species were less
common on the landscape before Euro-American
settlement (Hoffmeister 1986, Brown and Davis 1998).
However, the tassel-eared squirrel responded most
strongly to the presence of large trees, which were a
dominant structural feature of presettlement forests
(Cooper 1961). Thus, our results provide evidence that
small mammal species are adapted to the evolutionary
environment in terms of forest composition and
structure.
Similar to Carey and Harrington (2001), we found
that ﬁne-scale heterogeneity was more important to
small mammals than landscape-scale features, as we
detected no response of species to patch size. In
ponderosa pine forest, heterogeneity in habitat is
consistent with the natural process of low-severity ﬁre,
which would burn in a patchy arrangement across the
landscape, killing small trees but leaving large ones
(Cooper 1961), retaining some snags and down wood
while burning others (Spies and Turner 1999), leaving
denser stands of trees particularly on north-facing slopes
and steep canyons (Noss et al. 2006a), and regulating
litter and understory vegetation levels. All but one
species (Mogollon vole) responded positively to density
of large trees (.50 cm dbh), and our results suggest that
this feature was a part of the small mammal commun-
ity’s evolutionary environment. Similarly, only two
species responded positively to all snags but ﬁve
responded positively to snags .40 cm, likely because
larger snags provide larger cavities for nesting and cover
(Chambers and Mast 2005). Large trees, and in turn,
large snags, have decreased in density due to ﬁre
suppression and logging (Covington and Moore 1994a,
Mast et al. 1999), and thus managers may choose to
make efforts to retain them in an effort to restore the
evolutionary environment. However, more may not
always be better; for example, although Gambel oak is
a part of the evolutionary environment, managers in the
Southwest retain all oak when implementing fuels
reduction or restoration treatments, and this tree species
has been increasing in density since presettlement times
(Abella and Fule´ 2008). Although oak retention may be
important for other animals, as has been shown with
birds and bats (Rosenstock 1998, Bernardos et al. 2004),
we found that higher oak basal area is not a driver of
occupancy for most members of the small mammal
community. Finally, as most of the small mammal
species live underground in burrows (Hoffmeister 1986),
rock cover was an important covariate across most of
the
community,
and
a
part
of the
evolutionary
environment not affected by changes to forest structure.
Our ﬁndings that small mammals are associated with
ﬁre-generated habitat features (e.g., patchy overstory
distribution, snags, down wood) are consistent with
other wildlife studies in ﬁre dependent, dry forests,
mostly in the western and southeastern United States
(Kennedy and Fontaine 2009). Examples include Bach-
man’s Sparrow’s (Peucaea aestivalis) dependency on
periodically burned herbaceous understory (Tucker
et al. 2004), gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus)
relying on bare ground (Yager et al. 2007), ﬂying
squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus) associations with large
trees (Lehmkuhl et al. 2006), and Black-backed Wood-
pecker (Picoides arcticus) and Hairy Woodpecker
(Picoides villosus) use of ﬁre-created snags (Saab et al.
2009). The afﬁnity the small mammal community
exhibited to the evolutionary environment in our study
indicates that approximating these conditions can be a
useful tool for restoring or sustaining native species of
wildlife, particularly when single-species approaches are
not feasible (Lindenmayer et al. 2002). This result is
relevant to restoration projects in other ecosystems with
a paucity of data on historical wildlife populations.
Using occupancy approaches to monitor at large scales
We found that the occupancy modeling approach we
used was highly effective in evaluating the response of
the small mammal community to treatment and other
habitat attributes at a broad spatial scale. Wildlife is
important to monitor in large-scale perturbations, as
animal communities often recover more slowly than
plant communities and other ecosystem functions (Jones
and Schmitz 2009). Small mammals are often used as
indicators of habitat alteration because they are
relatively easy to monitor, but these studies are
commonly confounded by high year-to-year variability
(Brown and Ernest 2002). Species that are r selected and
have short life spans and high reproductive rates react
quickly and dramatically to environmental and climatic
changes (MacArthur and Wilson 1967), and particularly
in arid regions, many small-mammal population studies
end up primarily tracking precipitation patterns (e.g.,
Amacher et al. 2008, Bagne and Finch 2009). We
attempted to account for this variability by including
year as a covariate, and showed a lack of a year effect
for all but two species. We attribute this to the fact that
we estimated occupancy, which may be more robust to
yearly changes than density or abundance metrics. In
addition, we were able to sample a large number of sites
per year because we did not have to uniquely mark each
individual animal. Although our study was effort-
intensive, we sampled more area than many comparable
small mammal studies with similar objectives, which
relied on mark–recapture methods for density estima-
tion (Converse et al. 2006a, 2006b, Wampler et al. 2008,
Bagne and Finch 2009). We assessed eight species

whereas the maximum in prior studies was four, and
were able to sample two species that had not previously
been quantitatively assessed (rock squirrel and Botta’s
pocket gopher). The scope and scale of our study
revealed clear patterns of small mammal community
response to treatments and habitat attributes, and
resulted in reasonably precise species-level estimates of
occupancy. We recommend our approach be utilized in
other studies that are faced with high variability and
broad spatial and temporal scales in assessing impacts of
treatments or habitat alteration on wildlife species. Since
forest managers are increasingly focusing on the design
and implementation of spatially extensive treatments,
improved and efﬁciently obtained ecological informa-
tion will be necessary to inform these efforts and guide
management of the habitats and evolutionary environ-
ments on which native wildlife communities depend.
