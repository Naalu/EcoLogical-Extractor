Over a century of ﬁre suppression in warm/dry mixed conifer forests of southwestern Colorado, USA has
resulted in changes that have disrupted feedback interactions between vegetation composition and struc-
ture and the accompanying natural ﬁre regime. The ecosystem is now more susceptible to high intensity
crown ﬁres that were previously rare or absent in this forest type, which can lead to novel ecosystems.
We established four replicated blocks of (1) thin/burn, (2) burn alone and (3) control treatments, each
approximately 16-ha, to quantify the effects of restoration treatments on forest structure. We sampled
in 2003 (pre-treatment) and in 2009 (post-treatment). There were no signiﬁcant changes in the control
and burn alone treatments for tree density, basal area, canopy cover and tree regeneration between pre-
and post-treatment. Signiﬁcant changes in the thin/burn treatments included: tree density declining 82%
(582.7 treesha1), principally white ﬁr and Douglas-ﬁr; tree canopy cover decreasing 36%; basal area
declining 49% (12.5 m2ha1), primarily from white ﬁr; aspen tree regeneration increasing by 362%
(582.7 treesha1), and white ﬁr regeneration decreasing by 94% (249.1 treesha1). Overstory trees that
died tended to be younger, shorter, and/or smaller in diameter. Multivariate analysis of tree basal area
by species in the thin/burn treatments in 2009 showed a strong directional shift away from 2003 pre-
treatment data towards the reconstructed historical (1870) forest structure. Burn alone treatments were
distinct from controls after treatment in 2009 but did not resemble reconstructed 1870 forest structure.
Thin/burn treatments moved warm/dry mixed conifer forests in southwestern Colorado rapidly along the
trajectory toward historical reference conditions by altering forest composition and structure. Burn alone
treatments were less effective but also less costly. Forest restoration will make forests more resilient to
stand-replacing ﬁres and subsequent transitions to novel ecosystems under a warmer, drier climate.

1. Introduction
There is abundant evidence that 20th century ﬁre suppression
in pure ponderosa pine and low elevation mixed conifer forests
in the southwestern United States has resulted in changes to forest
composition, structure and ecological processes (Brown et al.,
2001; Grissino-Mayer et al., 2004; Brown and Wu, 2005; Heinlein
et al., 2005; Fulé et al., 2009; Evans et al., 2011). Paleoecological
studies in the Southwest (Toney and Anderson, 2006; Allen et al.,
2008; Bigio et al., 2010) and other regions with similar vegetation
types (Whitlock et al., 2003) have extended the long-term histori-
cal ﬁre record to the millennial scale providing further evidence
that the absence of ﬁre in the 20th century represents an anomaly
in forests where the regular occurrence of low intensity surface
burning was previously common.
Mixed conifer forests in the San Juan Mountains of Southwest
Colorado occur along a continuum from warm/dry to cool/moist
sites (Romme et al., 2009). Moisture and temperature are the pri-
mary drivers that inﬂuence species composition and ﬁre regimes
for these two mixed conifer forest types. Warm/dry mixed conifer
is dominated by ﬁre-resistant ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa var.
scopulorum P. & C. Lawson) and Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii
(Mirb.) Franco var. glauca (Beinssn.) Franco) but also includes spe-
cies adapted to mesic conditions such as white ﬁr (Abies concolor
(Gordon & Glendinning) Hoopes.) and aspen (Populus tremuloides
Michx.). Warm/dry mixed conifer is located adjacent to, but gener-
ally higher in elevation than, pure ponderosa pine stands. Surface
ﬁres were frequent before 1868, burning with multi- to sub-
decadal frequency in the warm/dry mixed conifer (Grissino-Mayer
et al., 2004; Fulé et al., 2009). Cool/moist mixed conifer is domi-
nated by white ﬁr and Douglas-ﬁr, as well as aspen and blue spruce
(Picea pungens Parry ex Engelm.). Historically, ﬁres in cool/moist
mixed conifer forests burned at sub-decadal to century frequency
with a mixed-severity ﬁre regime, where surface and crown ﬁre

behavior could occur during the same ﬁre event (Margolis and Bal-
mat, 2009; Romme et al., 2009). Feedback cycles between vegeta-
tion composition and structure and the accompanying disturbance
regime (e.g., ﬁre frequency and intensity) are well documented
(Miller and Urban, 2000; Beaty and Taylor, 2001; Martin and Kirk-
man, 2009). Over a century of ﬁre suppression in warm/dry mixed
conifer forests has shifted species composition toward more mesic,
shade tolerant species such as white ﬁr and Douglas-ﬁr, increased
tree density, and increased surface and aerial fuels (Cocke et al.,
2005; Crouse, 2005; Fulé et al., 2009), making them more suscep-
tible to stand-replacing ﬁres which can lead to novel ecosystems
(Seastedt et al., 2008). For example, in 2011, warmer than average
temperatures and drought in the southwestern United States cre-
ated conditions favorable for wildﬁre. The Wallow Fire became
the largest wildﬁre in Arizona recorded history (217720 ha) and
the Las Conchas Fire became the largest wildﬁre in New Mexico re-
corded history (63371 ha). In contrast to historical surface ﬁres,
these recent ﬁres burned as both mixed severity and stand-replac-
ing crown ﬁres in ponderosa pine and low-elevation mixed conifer
stands. Future stand regeneration in the severely burned areas may
represent novel ecosystems on new successional trajectories away
from historical stand characteristic. For example, Savage and Mast
Nystrom (2005) found conversion of ponderosa pine to non-for-
ested grass or shrub communities in stands that experienced se-
vere crown ﬁres in the southwestern United States.
Novel ecosystems and rapid 21st century environmental change
challenge the use of ecological history (reference conditions) as a
tool to characterize targets for ecological restoration (Choi, 2007;
Jackson and Hobbs, 2009). We argue, however, that under a war-
mer and drier climate, the use of site-speciﬁc reference conditions
is a scientiﬁcally sound target for forest stand conditions in surface
ﬁre-dependent forest ecosystems because they increase resiliency
to uncharacteristic ﬁre behavior, increasing the likelihood of main-
tenance of ecological goods and services these ecosystems provide
(Jackson and Hobbs, 2009). Reference conditions are not a snapshot
in time but rather represent a range of historical variability and
evolutionary adaptations developed over thousands of years
(Fulé, 2008). Speciﬁcally, ponderosa pine evolutionary adaptations
to drought, deep taproots and self-thinning lower branches, and
surface ﬁre, thick bark and protected buds, provides a broader def-
inition of reference conditions to include a long-term functional
view (Fulé, 2008). As a result, restoring pine dominated surface
ﬁre-dependent forest ecosystems to reference conditions can re-
duce the potential loss of these ecosystems under a warmer and
drier climate. One approach to identifying reference conditions is
to compare contemporary and pre-European settlement forest con-
ditions and ﬁre regimes (Fulé et al., 1997; Stephenson, 1999) to
guide ecological restoration (Brown et al., 2008). Fulé and others
(2009) reconstructed past forest conditions ca. 1870 and the his-
torical ﬁre regime for our study site using dendrochronology. In
2002, we initiated a controlled experiment in warm/dry mixed
conifer forest of the San Juan Mountains, Colorado, to assess forest
change and test restoration alternatives on the overstory and the
herbaceous understory (Korb et al., 2007). We established four rep-
licated blocks, each approximately 16 ha, of three treatments: (1)
thin/burn, (2) burn alone, and (3) control. The burn alone treat-
ment was included to determine if restoration goals could be
achieved without tree thinning. All treatments were tested against
site speciﬁc dendrochronological reconstructed reference condi-
tions (Fulé et al., 2009). Site reference conditions at our mixed
conifer site illustrated total basal area was on average 11 m2ha1
with ponderosa pine representing nearly two-thirds of the basal
area and total tree density was on average 142 treesha1 in 1870.
We have two objectives for this paper: (1) quantify post-treat-
ment differences in forest composition and structure among treat-
ments and compare post-treatment stands with site speciﬁc
reference conditions; and, (2) quantify changes in untreated con-
trols over a six year period (2003–2009) to assess the stability of
warm-dry mixed conifer stands.
2. Methods
2.1. Study area
The study area is located in the San Juan Mountains, in south-
west Colorado (N 37.296, W 107.228) on the San Juan National For-
est. The site consists of 15–30% slopes on south-facing aspects.
Elevations range from 2438 to 2743 m. The dominant soil type is
Dutton loam, a silty clay loam (USDA Forest Service, 2004). Average
daily temperatures range from a maximum of 25.7 C in July to a
minimum of 17 C in January. Average annual precipitation is
55.4 cm, with the greatest amounts occurring in July and August.
Precipitation from November to March is dominated by snowfall,
with an average annual total of 326 cm (Western Regional Climate
Center, Pagosa Springs, 1906–1998, <http://www.wrcc.dri.edu>).
Forest vegetation includes ponderosa pine, Douglas-ﬁr, white ﬁr,
and aspen. The midstory and understory are dominated primarily
by white ﬁr and Douglas-ﬁr, with a variety of shrubs including
Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii), snowberry (Symphoricarpus rotun-
difolius), and serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia). Past disturbance
history includes sheep grazing beginning in the late 1800s and cat-
tle grazing since the early 1900s. Fire suppression has been man-
agement policy since the early twentieth century. A single timber
harvest occurred between 1990 and 1993, using a selective system
that removed 51% ponderosa pine, 33% white ﬁr, and 16% Douglas-
ﬁr evenly across the study area (USDA Forest Service, 2004).
2.2. Experimental design
We established four replicate blocks of three randomly assigned
treatment units, each approximately 16 ha in size (Fig. 1). Existing
roads were used to delineate the blocks because the roads served
as safe ﬁrelines, causing the blocks to be irregular in shape. The
three treatments were (1) thin/burn, (2) burn alone, and (3) an un-
treated control. We did not include a thin alone treatment because
the goal of forest restoration is to restore ecological function,
which is not possible without a burn treatment in ecosystems that
historically were dominated by surface ﬁres. The thinning pre-
scription retained all living trees that established in 1870 or earlier
as identiﬁed by size, bark color, and canopy architecture (Fulé
et al., 2009). If remnants (e.g., snags, logs, and stumps) were pres-
ent in 1870 but were no longer alive, we kept live post-settlement
trees as a substitute for those remnants. An average of two younger
trees of the same species, within 20 m of the remnant if possible,
was retained for each dead remnant encountered (see Fulé et al.,
2001 for a detailed description of the thinning prescription). Be-
cause of past cutting of ponderosa pine and 20th century establish-
ment of non-pine species (Fulé et al., 2009), there was a relatively
high number of pine remnants and a relatively low density of po-
tential pine replacements. Therefore, the trees designated for thin-
ning were mostly white ﬁr and some Douglas-ﬁr. Aspen are highly
susceptible to ﬁre so none were thinned, because we assumed that
many would be killed by burning. Crews thinned the thin/burn
units with chain saws during the summer and fall 2004 with a cost
of $926/hectare. Wood was not removed due to restrictions on
road access, so logs and limbs were lopped and scattered. Old-
growth trees were not raked to remove fuels around tree boles. Fire
crews did prescribed burning in fall 2007 (Blocks 1 and 2) and fall
2008 (Blocks 3 and 4) using strip headﬁres with a cost of $370/
hectare. Fire crews were unable to burn all units during the
same time period because of regulations on smoke output.

The maximum temperature during 2007 burning was 17.8 C with
a minimum relative humidity of 24%; maximum temperature dur-
ing 2008 burning was 20.5 C with a minimum relative humidity of
18. Average ﬂame lengths were 0.3–0.9 m in needle duff, 1–2.4 m
in tree thinning slash and up to 7.6 m from torching trees with a
very low rate of spread for both years.
2.3. Field methods
We established 20 permanent study plots on a 60-m grid per
unit
to
characterize
forest
structure
and
vegetation
(total
N = 12 U  20 plots = 240 plots). We collected pre-treatment data
in the summer of 2003 and post-treatment data in the summer
of 2009. We measured overstory trees and saplings taller than
breast height (137 cm) in a 400 m2 (11.28 m radius) circular plot.
Species, condition (living or snag/log classes Thomas et al., 1979),
diameter at breast height (dbh), total height, crown base height,
and a preliminary ﬁeld classiﬁcation of presettlement or postset-
tlement origin were recorded for each tree encountered in the plot.
We identiﬁed potentially presettlement ponderosa pine trees
based on size (>40 cm diameter at ‘‘stump height’’ [dsh]), 40 cm
above ground level) or yellow bark (White, 1985). Other conifers
were also considered as potentially presettlement if dsh > 40 cm;
aspen were noted as potentially presettlement if dsh > 20 cm. A
random 10% subsample of all trees and any trees classiﬁed as
potentially presettlement were cored. Cored trees were dated
and have been described elsewhere (Fulé et al., 2009). Tree regen-
eration (trees below breast height) was measured on a nested
100 m2 circular plot (5.64 m radius); species, condition, and height
class (<40 cm; 40.1–80 cm; 80.1–137 cm) were recorded for each
seedling or sprout. We recorded tree canopy cover using a vertical
projection densiometer every 3 m along a permanently marked 50-
m line transect oriented upslope through the plot center. We mea-
sured dead woody biomass and forest ﬂoor (litter and duff) depth
on a permanently marked 15.2-m planar transect in a random
direction from each plot center (Brown, 1974). Understory vegeta-
tion was also measured and has been described elsewhere (Korb
et al., 2007).
2.4. Statistical analysis
We compared forest structural variables, including tree density,
basal area, canopy cover, regeneration density, and mortality
among treatments with a Kruskal–Wallis test (a 6 005). We con-
ducted post hoc tests with pairwise Kruskal–Wallis two-sample
tests following a statistically signiﬁcant result for a total variable
and then adjusted alpha levels by the number of pairwise compar-
isons using a Bonferroni correction (Kuehl, 1994). We used Wilco-
xon signed-ranks tests to quantify changes over time between

shown. Black circles represent individual plots (N = 20/treatment unit).

2003 and 2009 data to include the repeated measurements on the
permanent plots.
We used nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) to examine
changes in basal area of all tree species over time and among treat-
ments (Clark, 1993). We used basal area because it is the most accu-
rate variable to reconstruct with dendroecological data (Moore
et al., 2004). We ﬁltered out two species, Pinus edulis (piñon pine)
and Juniperus scopulorum (Rocky Mountain juniper), because they
did not occur on a minimum of 5% of the plots (McCune and Grace,
2002). We ran the NMS ordination in PC-ORD software [version
5.10, McCune and Mefford, 2006] using a Bray–Curtis distance
measure, random starting conﬁgurations, 50 runs with real data, a
maximum of 200 iterations per run and a stability criterion of
0.00001. We compared the stress value of the ﬁnal solution to 50
random
solutions
using
a
Monte
Carlo
test.
We
examined
differences between reconstructed 1870, 2003 pre-treatment, and
2009 post-treatment forest structure using a permutational multi-
variate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) (Anderson, 2001) to
quantify differences in basal area and trees ha1 across time and
among treatments. We used a one ﬁxed-factor and one-level nested
design with time as our main effect [PC- software version 5.10,
McCune and Mefford, 2006]. We used indicator-species analysis to
identify species that were particularly faithful (i.e., consistent indi-
cators) to the analysis dates of 2003 or 2009. A comparison between
the maximum indicator value (0–100) and random trials for occur-
rence of a given species (1000 Monte Carlo randomizations)
provided an approximate P-value (McCune and Grace, 2002).

3. Results
3.1. Forest structure
There were no differences in total tree density (U = 2.81,
P = 0.25) or basal area (U = 2.44, P = 0.29) among treatment units
prior to restoration in 2003. In 2009, following treatments, total
density (U = 9.27, P = 0.01) and basal area (U = 9.85, P = 0.007) were
lower in thin/burn units than the control and burn alone units (Ta-
ble 1). Thin/burn units had the only signiﬁcant (Z = 2.17, P = 0.03)
change
in
tree
density
with
an
82%
decline
between
pre
(709.6 treesha1) and post-treatment (126.9 treesha1) largely
from decreases, 96%, in white ﬁr (Z = 2.17, P = 0.03) and 76%, in
Douglas-ﬁr (Z = 2.03, P = 0.03) (Table 1). In 2009, total basal area
differences among treatments were driven by Douglas-ﬁr basal area
(U = 8.8, P = 0.013). Thin/burn units had the only signiﬁcant de-
crease in basal area (Z = 2.17, P = 0.03) declining 49% between
pre- (25.6 m2ha1) and post-treatment (13.1 m2ha1) with white
ﬁr having the largest decrease, 86% (Z = 2.17, P = 0.03) (Table 1).
Diameter distributions in 2003 for all treatment units prior to
restoration followed a reverse-J distribution with strong dominance
by small trees, especially aspen and white ﬁr (Fig. 2). All units had
trees at least through the 85-cm diameter class with most of the
trees P45-cm class being ponderosa pine (Fig. 2). After treatment,
diameter distributions in the controls were relatively unchanged
except for a decrease of small aspen ramets (Fig. 2).
Diameter distributions post-treatment in the burn alone units
were unimodal with a peak at the 25-cm diameter class. The main
shifts were decreases in white ﬁr in the 5, 15, and 25-cm diameter
classes (Fig. 2). Diameter distributions post-treatment in the thin/
burn units were bimodal (Fig. 2). After treatment, all units main-
tained trees at least through the 85-cm diameter class with pon-
derosa pine still dominating trees P45-cm (Fig. 2).
3.2. Canopy cover
There were no differences among treatment units in tree can-
opy cover (U = 3.18, P = 0.17) prior to restoration treatments in
2003 (Table 1). Tree canopy was different (U = 9.85, P = 0.007)
post-treatment with the controls having the highest average can-
opy cover (49%), followed by burn alone (40.3%), and thin/burn
treatments (30.8%) (Table 1). In the thin/burn treatment, tree can-
opy cover (Z = 2.17, P = 0.03) decreased 36% between 2003 and
2009 (Table 1). There were no differences in canopy cover between
pre/post-treatment for the control or burn alone units (Z = 0.144
and 0.7222, P = 0.89 and P = 0.47, respectively).
3.3. Tree mortality
Overstory trees that died were relatively young, short, and/or
smaller in diameter. There were no differences in overstory tree
mortality for young (U = 5.69, P = 0.06) or old-growth (U = 1.38,
P = 0.5) trees post-treatment. Old-growth trees for this study are
deﬁned as trees established by 1870. The thin/burn treatments
had the highest variability in tree mortality. Overstory old-growth
aspen had the highest species mortality in the thin/burn units,
10.1 treesha1, followed by ponderosa pine, 3.29 treesha1, with
white ﬁr and Douglas-ﬁr each having just over 1 treeha1 mortal-
ity (Table 2). In contrast, overstory old-growth Douglas-ﬁr had the
highest species mortality in the burn alone units, 4.95 treesha1,
followed by aspen, 3.19 treesha1, and white ﬁr and ponderosa
pine had sequentially lower mortality (Table 2). Mortality was
dominated by old-growth aspen in the controls, 6.71 treesha1,
followed by Douglas-ﬁr, 2.32 treesha1, with white ﬁr and ponder-
osa pine having low mortality (Table 2).
3.4. Regeneration
Total tree regeneration (seedling >40 cm in height) density
(seedlingha1) was not different before (U = 1.19, P = 0.55) or after
(U = 2.92, P = 0.23) treatments. Tree regeneration density after

restoration treatments was different for white ﬁr and Douglas-ﬁr
(U = 7.88 and 7.14, P = 0.02 and P = 0.03, respectively) (Table 3).
Total tree regeneration for individual treatments between pre/
post-treatment were not different, but some individual species’
regeneration did differ in thin/burn treatments pre/post-treat-
ment. Aspen regeneration density increased (Z = 2.17, P = 0.03)
from 237.5 seedlings/rametsha1 to 1097.5 seedlings/rametsha1
(Table 3), while white ﬁr and Douglas-ﬁr decreased (Z = 2.37 and
2.165, P = 0.2 and P = 0.3, respectively) (Table 3).
3.5. Surface fuels
There were no differences in forest ﬂoor depth (litter plus duff)
(U = 1.38, P = 0.5) prior to restoration treatments. In 2009 following
treatments, forest ﬂoor depth (U = 8.11, P = 0.02) decreased (Table
4). In the thin/burn and burn treatments, forest ﬂoor decreased
(Z = 2.17, P = 0.03) from 4.24 to 1.3 cm in the thin/burn and from
4 to 1.9 cm in the burn alone treatments (Table 4). Fine woody deb-
ris (67.62 cm diameter) was not different (U = 0.75, P = 0.3) before

treatments (Table 4). Following treatments, ﬁne woody debris de-
creased (Z = 2.17, P = 0.03) in the thin/burn treatments from 7.2 to
4.2 mg ha1 (Table 4). In burn alone treatments, ﬁne woody debris
decreased (Z = 2.17, P = 0.03) from 9.6 to 5.6 mg ha1 (Table 4).
Coarse woody debris (P7.64 cm diameter) did not differ before
(U = 0.04, P = 0.98) or after (U = 0.81, P = 0.67) restoration treat-
ments (Table 4).
3.6. Comparisons with reconstructed 1870 forest structure
There was a difference in tree basal area between reconstructed
1870, 2003 pre-treatment and 2009 post-treatment data (F = 9.6;
P = 0.001) (Table 5). There was also a difference between recon-
structed 1870, 2003 pre-treatment and 2009 post-treatment data
for tree density (F = 14.4; P = 0.0002) (Table 5). There were no dif-
ferences among blocks across time for tree basal area (F = 1.53;
P = 0.07) or tree density (F = 1.12; P = 0.35) (Table 5).
Tree basal area by species in 2009 in the thin/burn treatments
showed a strong directional shift away from 2003 pre-treatment
data towards the reconstructed 1870 forest structure (Fig. 3). Burn
treatments in 2009 were separated from controls in the same year
but did not resemble reconstructed 1870 forest structure (Fig. 3).
Indicator species analysis detected species that were particularly
consistent indicators for time (Table 6). Ponderosa pine was the
only indicator species for the reconstructed 1870 data. White ﬁr,
Douglas-ﬁr, and aspen were all indicator species for the pre-treat-
ment units in 2003, but there were no indicator species in 2009
post-treatment, indicating that the units in 2003 had higher dom-
inance of white ﬁr, Douglas-ﬁr and aspen than in 2009 (Table 6).
4. Discussion
This experiment is the ﬁrst to apply dendrochronologically
reconstructed data (Fulé et al., 2009) on historical reference condi-
tions to the design and testing of replicated ecological restoration
treatments (thin/burn and burn-only) in a mixed-conifer forest
representing the transition between the Southwest and Southern
Rocky Mountains. Neither the mixed-conifer forest type nor the
biogeographical location has received much research attention re-
lated to restoration, despite the large geographic area of this forest
type and its ecological and economic importance. In contrast, rep-
licated ecological restoration treatments have been more thor-
oughly tested in ponderosa pine in this biogeographical location.
4.1. Forest compositional and structural changes
Restoring ecological integrity to altered ecosystems often re-
quires bold management to reinitiate feedback cycles and over-
come the constraints of degraded systems (Suding et al., 2004).
In our study, the combination of thinning and burning moved de-
graded warm/dry mixed conifer forests in southwestern Colorado
close to the historical reference condition, whereas burn alone
treatments simply moved forests in the same direction towards
the historical range. Thin/burn treatments had an average of
129.6 treesha1, which was close to the historical reference

condition of 142 treesha1 ± 9.9 (Fulé et al., 2009). Fire had a thin-
ning effect in the sense that younger and smaller trees were most
likely to be heavily charred and die (Fig. 2), but the ﬁre thinning
was less effective than mechanical thinning, as indicated by the
relatively high residual density in burn treatments, averaging
373.4 treesha1. For basal area, thin/burn treatments moved close
to the historical reference condition of 11 m2ha1 ± 1.1 (Fulé et al.,
2009), having an average 13.1 m2ha1 basal area in comparison to
burn alone treatments (21.6 m2ha1).
Forest composition also shifted in the thin/burn treatments.
Ponderosa pine represented nearly 63% of the basal area in the his-
torical reference condition (Fulé et al., 2009), comparable to 73% of
the basal area in thin/burn treatments but only 44% in burn alone
treatments. White ﬁr represented 11% of the basal area in both the
historical reference condition (Fulé et al., 2009) and the thin/burn
treatments where white ﬁr was targeted in the hand thin, but 30%
of the basal area in burn alone treatments.
Old-growth trees were considered a priority for retention in the
treatments, because they represent a genetic and structural legacy
that has largely vanished (Abella et al., 2007). Mortality was low in
absolute terms (<7 treesha1) but ranged as high as 73% in relative
terms because many units had low pre-treatment densities of old
trees. The mortality of old aspen trees, the species with the greatest
decline, was similar to old aspen mortality in a mixed conifer forest
at Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona (Fulé et al., 2006). Mortal-
ity of old ponderosa pines, the most ﬁre-resistant species in the
forest, ranged from 1% (control) to 13% (thin/burn), substantially
less than the 34% old ponderosa pine mortality observed in similar
treatments in a drier site in Arizona (Fulé et al., 2007). The differ-
ences in species-speciﬁc mortality at our experimental site were
consistent with ﬁre-resistant traits such as bark thickness (Ryan
and Reinhardt, 1988). Differential mortality implies that the rein-
troduction of the repeated surface ﬁre regime on south facing
slopes will continue to shift composition away from the less ﬁre-
resistant species over time.
There was no net change in ponderosa pine regeneration in the
thin/burn treatments and a 40% decrease in burn alone treatments.
Despite limited ponderosa pine seedling establishment in the ﬁrst
years following treatments, restoration treatments did signiﬁ-
cantly decrease forest ﬂoor (litter plus duff) and ﬁne woody debris
by over 70% and 40%, respectively in the thin/burn treatments.

These changes should favor ponderosa pine regeneration because
litter prevents seeds from imbibing water due to poor contact with
moist mineral soil and litter provides habitat for damping-off fun-
gi, which cause seedling wilting and mortality (Farmer, 1997). In
addition, direct microsite changes from ﬁre such as scorched nee-
dles on blackened mineral soil have been shown to favor ponder-
osa emergence and establishment (Bonnet et al., 2005). Aspen
regeneration in thin/burn treatments increased almost ﬁvefold
over pre-treatment levels while aspen regeneration in burn alone
treatments did not even double. These responses are most likely
due to old-growth aspen mortality being twice as high in thin/burn
versus burn alone treatments and variation in ﬁre behavior be-
cause aspen trees were not harvested in any treatments.
4.2. Tree mortality
Our ﬁndings support restoration studies in mixed conifer at
other biogeographic locations where limited treatments such as
burning alone or burning with minimal thinning did not restore
stand composition and structure within historical reference condi-
tions over the short-term (Stephens and Moghaddas, 2005; Fulé
et al., 2006; Mason et al., 2009; Rambo and North, 2009; Schwilk
et al., 2009; Stephens et al., 2009). Speciﬁcally, a comprehensive
synthesis of hazardous fuel treatments in western mixed conifer
by Stephens and others (2009) showed that thin and burn treat-
ments were the most resistant to simulated active and passive
crown ﬁre; however, they recommended land managers utilize a
variety of treatments to create forest stand structures that are
resistant to wildﬁres. Creating forest conditions that increase forest
heterogeneity at the landscape scale to emulate historical refer-
ence conditions will make forests more resilient to altered ﬁre re-
gimes under a warmer, drier climate (Stephens et al., 2009; Evans
et al., 2011; Johnson et al., 2011). In addition, thin and burn treat-
ments decrease other stress induced mortality from forest insects,
pathogens and drought stress due to increased competition among
trees for nutrients, water, and growing space (Hessburg et al.,
1994).
Van Mantgem et al. (2009) found that widespread increases in
mortality of old trees across the western United States was linked
to regional warming. In our study, untreated controls experienced
a 22% decrease in total tree density over a six-year period between
pre/post-treatment measurements from 735 to 573 treesha1. The
majority of this decrease was small (<25 cm dsh) white ﬁr and
(<20 cm dsh) aspen but older, larger trees also had a moderate con-
tribution. While this difference in mortality was not signiﬁcant, the
mortality still has management implications because of the poten-
tial impact that insects and pathogens may have on drought
stressed systems. It is critical that restoration ecologists incorpo-
rate natural mortality into restoration treatment design because
of the ensuing implications that background tree mortality has
on forest stand structure and thus restoration goals.
4.3. Implications for management
Numerous climate models have projected signiﬁcant anthropo-
genic climate change by the end of the 21st century (IPCC, 2007). In
the southwestern United States, both historical data and climate
models reﬂect earlier spring snow melt, increased spring and sum-
mer temperatures, and drier summers (Westerling et al., 2006;
Seager et al., 2007; Barnett et al., 2008). Fires are easier to ignite
and spread, the ﬁre season is longer, and extreme ﬁre behavior is
more common with warmer temperatures, drier soils and longer
growing seasons (McKenzie et al., 2004; IPCC, 2007; Lui et al.,
2010).
Given these projected changes, it is crucial to implement
management actions to mitigate altered trajectories in species
composition, structure, and ecological processes by restoring the
self-regulating attributes of surface-ﬁre-dependent forests. The
general approach in ecological restoration of surface ﬁre-depen-
dent forests has been to carry out initial treatments and then seek
to maintain the treatment effects over time with recurring surface
ﬁres at intervals close to the historical mean (Allen et al., 2002;
Roccaforte et al., 2010). This approach is logical to some extent
even as climate warms, because frequently burned southwestern
forests were quite resilient to drought and disturbance (Fulé,
2008), but continued warming may push habitats across ecological
thresholds (Millar et al., 2007). The uncertainty of site-speciﬁc cli-
mate changes makes detailed planning difﬁcult but it is wise for
managers to evaluate likely trends. In warm/dry mixed conifer for-
ests, which already represent the transition from ponderosa pine to
cool/moist mixed conifer, a logical expectation is that the species
adapted to more xeric conditions (ponderosa pine, Douglas-ﬁr) will
increase in dominance while Abies and Populus decline. The ecolog-
ical role of frequent surface ﬁre to maintain open structure is likely
to continue to be important, but ﬁre may cause higher-than-ex-
pected mortality in drought-stressed trees (Diggins et al., 2010).
To address possible increased mortality due to ﬁre in a warmer,
drier climate, managers might consider reapplying ﬁre at longer-
than-historical intervals in an adaptive future-orientated restora-
tion framework (Choi, 2007; Seastedt et al., 2008). In addition, burn
alone treatments are a viable restoration option for forest manag-
ers in Wilderness areas where mechanized equipment is prohib-
ited and in areas not adjacent to vulnerable infrastructure where
a manager’s goal is simply to get forests on a trajectory toward a
more sustainable historical condition as suggested by Allen et al.
(2002) for ponderosa pine surface-ﬁre-dependent ecosystems
(Evans et al., 2011). Finally, management funding for fuels and res-
toration treatments are limited making burn alone treatments a
feasible option because they are less expensive per hectare than
thin/burn treatments.
