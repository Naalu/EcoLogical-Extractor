G. A. Pearson Natural Area

Abstract—Ecological restoration treatments using thinning and
prescribed burning have been proposed to reverse the decline of old-
growth ponderosa pines in the Southwest. However, long-term data
on the effectiveness of such treatments are lacking. In 1993–1994,
two ecological restoration treatments and a control were estab-
lished at the G. A. Pearson Natural Area (GPNA) near Flagstaff, AZ.
The thinned treatment removed many postsettlement-aged trees
to create tree density and stand structure similar to pre-Euro-
American forests. The thinned + burned treatment included pre-
scribed burning of the forest floor in combination with this thinning.
The control was a dense stand of pre- and postsettlement trees with
no thinning or burning. Crown dieback of presettlement trees
decreased by about 3 percent in both thinned treatments over
6 years since initiation of treatments, whereas dieback increased by
about 4 percent in the control. Crown dieback was not related to tree
age. Change in height of presettlement trees between 1994 and 2000
did not differ among treatments. Of 146 presettlement trees moni-
tored for survival between 1994 and 2000, four died between 1997
and 2000, and all were in thinned treatments. Two of the four trees
that died toppled or the stem broke in a severe windstorm in 1997.
The other two dead trees died between 1997 and 2000 following the
severe regionwide drought of 1996. These two dead trees had large
amounts of canopy dieback prior to treatment initiation, suggesting
that thinning did not contribute to their mortality. Our results
indicate that heavy thinning of postsettlement trees improved the
crown condition of presettlement trees at the GPNA over 6 years
since treatment, but also may have increased windthrow and wind
breakage.
Introduction ____________________
Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in northern
Arizona have changed dramatically in stand structure over
the past century due to human alteration of the natural fire
regime, overgrazing, and logging (Arnold 1950; Cooper 1960;
White 1985; Covington and Moore 1994; Fulé and others
1997). In most areas of northern Arizona, fires have been
suppressed for at least 87 years (Madany and West 1983;
Savage and Swetnam 1990). Pre-Euro-American settlement
forests were characterized by clusters of old pines separated
by lush grassy areas. These open canopy conditions were
maintained by low-intensity surface fires that occurred
every 2–12 years (Weaver 1951; Cooper 1960; Dieterich
1980; Dieterich and Swetnam 1984; Swetnam and Baisan
1996). The present forests are currently dominated by dense
thickets of sapling- and pole-sized trees and have heavy
accumulations of litter and woody fuels, and poor under-
story grass, forb, and shrub growth (Cooper 1960; Harrington
and Sackett 1992; Covington and Moore 1994; Dahms and
Geils 1997).
There is currently much interest in improving the condi-
tion of Southwestern ponderosa pine forests by thinning to
reduce competition among trees and by prescribed burning
to reduce fuel loads. However, few studies have examined
the effects of such thinning and burning treatments on
presettlement ponderosa pines. Studies of historical tree
growth rates of presettlement ponderosa pines in northern
Arizona have suggested that the remaining presettle-
ment trees are declining because of competition from
postsettlement trees (Sutherland 1983; Biondi 1996). Two
studies have reported negative effects of prescribed burning
on the growth, water relations, and survival of presettle-
ment trees (Sutherland and others 1991; Swezy and Agee
1991). In both studies, the burns were conducted in stands
containing heavy fuel loads due to fire suppression, causing
heat damage to the presettlement trees.
We initiated a study in 1993 designed to evaluate tech-
niques for improving the condition of ponderosa pine forests
in the Gus Pearson Natural Area (GPNA) in northern
Arizona (Covington and others 1997). The GPNA is a unique,
relict stand of presettlement ponderosa pines that has been
protected from harvesting and heavy grazing. The treat-
ments included thinning of postsettlement trees to create a
more open stand condition, and a combination of thinning
and prescribed burning. The influence of these treatments
on the growth, water, carbon, and nutrient relations of
presettlement trees have been reported by Stone and others
(1999) for the first year following treatment, and by Feeney

and others (1998) for the second and third years following
treatment. These authors concluded that thinning increased
uptake of water and nitrogen of presettlement trees, and
these changes contributed to greater rates of photosynthesis
and stem radial growth. Differences in growth and physi-
ological characteristics between the thinned treatment and
the thinned + burned treatment were small, except for tree
resin flow, which was higher in the thinned + burned treat-
ment than in the thinned treatment (Feeney and others
1998).
In this paper, we compare mortality and crown condition
of presettlement trees 6 years after initiation of the restora-
tion treatments at the GPNA. Measurements of these char-
acteristics made in 1994 are compared to measurements
made in 2000 to show temporal changes in each treatment
area. Our general hypothesis is that the positive effects of
the thinning and thinning + burning treatments on preset-
tlement tree condition that were documented for the first
3 years after the initiation of treatments (Feeney and others
1998; Stone and others 1999) would continue through
year 6. Specifically, we expected lower tree mortality and a
greater improvement in crown condition in thinned and
thinned + burned treatments compared with the unthinned
and unburned control.
Methods _______________________
Study site
The study was conducted at the GPNA, within the Coconino
National Forest approximately 10 km northwest of Flag-
staff, Arizona. The study site occupies 3 ha of the 30-ha
GPNA at an elevation of 2,195–2,255 m. Aspect is generally
southwest, with gentle topography (slopes 0–5 percent).
Soils, derived from basalt and volcanic cinders, are classified
as a Brolliar stony clay loam, fine, smectitic, Typic Argiboroll.
Mean annual precipitation in Flagstaff is 56.7 cm, with
approximately one-half of the precipitation falling as snow
from November to May and one-half falling as rain primarily
during the late-summer monsoon season (July and August).
Mean annual air temperature in Flagstaff is 7.5 ∞C. The
climate is subhumid, with early summer droughts common.
The average frost-free growing season is 94 days (Schubert
1974).
The vegetation community at the GPNA is a previously
unharvested ponderosa pine stand that is uneven-aged with
even-aged groups of pole-sized trees and uneven-aged groups
of presettlement trees (Schubert 1974; White 1985). Pole-
sized trees (10–37.4 cm d.b.h.) are the predominant size
class. The predominant Euro-American influences at the
GPNA have been livestock grazing, which occurred between
1876 and 1910, and fire suppression. The last natural fire
was in 1876; prior to that time, the fire return interval
averaged approximately 2 years (Dieterich 1980).
Experimental Design and Treatments
The GPNA study site was subdivided into three largely
contiguous areas, each occupying approximately 1 ha
(Covington and others 1997). Each area was subjected to one
of three treatments: control, thinned, and thinned + burned.
Each treatment area was further subdivided into five ap-
proximately 0.20-ha plots that served as experimental units.
We grouped these plots into five blocks (one plot per treat-
ment) that were used to implement all measurements.
Because our experimental design does not include true
spatial replication across the landscape, we used precau-
tions to strengthen our inferences regarding treatment
effects. Specifically, an earlier analysis (Stone 1997) showed
similar pretreatment levels of soil total nitrogen (P = 0.19),
phosphorus (P = 0.25), organic matter (P = 0.19), predawn
leaf water potential (P = 0.82 for May to June, P = 0.25 for
July to August), basal area growth rate (P = 0.96), stem
diameter (P = 0.32), and tree-to-tree competition index (P =
0.66) of presettlement trees among the areas to be treated.
Thus, resource availability, tree growth, and tree physiologi-
cal condition were similar among areas prior to treatment.
Second, our interpretation of statistical results applies only
to the specific locations in the GPNA where the treatments
were applied.
The thinning was conducted to simulate the presettle-
ment (circa 1876) stand structure, which was determined
using dendrochronological techniques (Mast and others 1999).
The average pretreatment basal area was 34.5 m2 ha-1
(average of 3,100 trees ha-1), which was retained in the
control area. In November of 1993, two-thirds of the site was
thinned to an average basal area of 13.0 m2 ha-1 (average of
151 trees ha-1), with all presettlement trees and all trees
greater than 40 cm d.b.h. retained. Following the thinning
treatment, the unthinned control area had an average d.b.h.
of 16.6 cm in 1993, while both thinned areas had an average
d.b.h. of 40.9 cm (Covington and others 1997). Thinning did
not substantially change light availability to the preset-
tlement trees used in the study because the crowns of the
thinned postsettlement trees were lower than the crowns of
the presettlement trees.
Half of the thinned area was also subjected to a low-
intensity prescribed burn in 1994 (October) and 1998 (Octo-
ber). Prior to the first burn in 1994, the Oi (slightly decom-
posed organic matter), Oe (moderately decomposed organic
matter), and Oa (highly decomposed organic matter) layers
of the forest floor and woody debris were removed by hand
raking to simulate presettlement forest floor conditions,
which would have had little forest floor litter and debris
because of frequent fire. The Oi layer (2–4 years of litterfall)
was replaced prior to burning with dried native grass foliage
from a nearby prairie (672 kg ha-1 dry biomass) to simulate
presettlement forest floor conditions in which grasses were
dominant. Fire characteristics for the 1994 burn were previ-
ously reported by Covington and others (1997); flame length
averaged about 15 cm with maximum lengths of 60 cm. For
the second burn in 1998, flame length averaged 11 cm with
maximum lengths of 180–240 cm that occurred in fallen
limbs and needles of windthrown trees.
Crown Dieback and Mortality
We measured crown dieback of 71 presettlement trees in
July 1994 and March 2000. Of these trees, 27 were in control
plots, 22 were in thinned plots, and 22 were in thinned +
burned plots. These trees were selected for measurement in
1994 because all had good crown condition with little dieback

prior to initiation of the treatments and were located at least
10 m from treatment boundaries, which reduced potential
influences from other treatments. Crown dieback of each
tree was visually assessed by at least three trained observ-
ers using a system with 12 percentage classes (table 1)
developed for forest health monitoring (Millers and others
1991; Kolb and McCormick 1993). The same leader (T. E.
Kolb) trained assessment crews in both 1994 and 2000, and
he checked the crown condition assessment of all trees in
both years for accuracy. Crown dieback was defined as the
percentage of total crown volume that contained dead
branches with bark or with branch tips less than 2.5 cm
diameter (Millers and others 1991). We also measured the
height of all trees with a clinometer at the time of crown
dieback assessment in both years. Tree mortality status
(live or dead) was noted in 1994, 1996, and 2000 on a total of
146 presettlement trees that consisted of the same 71 trees
measured for crown dieback and an additional 75 trees.
Data Analysis
We compared differences in crown dieback and height
growth among the control, thinned, and thinned + burned
areas of the GPNA using a fixed-effects analysis of variance
(ANOVA) on plot means. Mean comparisons among treat-
ments were performed with Fisher’s protected LSD, and a
threshold P value of 0.10 was used in all tests because of the
inherent large variability of a population of old trees. All
statistical analyses were conducted using the SAS JMP
statistical package (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, U.S.A.).
Only trees that were living in both 1994 and 2000 were
included in the analysis of crown dieback.
Results ________________________
Crown Dieback
Crown dieback of presettlement trees differed signifi-
cantly (P = 0.073) among treatment areas in 1994 when
treatments were initiated. Dieback was significantly greater
in the thinned treatment (mean = 19.0 percent) compared
with the thinned + burned treatment (mean = 12.4 percent)
(fig. 1). Dieback did not differ significantly between the
control (mean = 14.0 percent) and either thinned treatment
in 1994 (fig. 1).
Crown dieback also differed significantly (P = 0.037)
among treatments in 2000, 6 years after the initiation of
treatments. In contrast to the results in 1994, dieback was
greatest in the control (mean = 18.0 percent), intermediate
in the thinned treatment (mean = 14.3 percent), and lowest
in the thinned + burned treatment (mean = 10.4 percent)
(fig. 2). The difference in dieback between 1994 and 2000 was

caused by a difference among treatments in temporal change
in crown condition. In the control, crown dieback increased
between 1994 and 2000 by an average of 3.5 percent, whereas
crown dieback decreased during this period in the thinned
(–3.9 percent) and thinned + burned (–2.5 percent) treat-
ments (fig. 3). This difference in temporal change in dieback
between the control and thinned treatments was significant
(P = 0.037).
There was no relationship between tree age and 2000
crown dieback (R = 0.153, P = 0.284) or 1994–2000 change in
dieback (R = 0.103, P = 0.473) for data pooled over all
treatments (figs. 4 and 5). Correlations between these vari-
ables were also not significant for data analyzed by treat-
ment group, except for 2000 crown dieback in the thinned +
burned treatment which was positively associated with tree
age (R = 0.466, P = 0.059) (fig. 4).
Change in Tree Height
Tree height growth, expressed as a percentage change
between 1994 and 2000, was highest in the thinned + burned
treatment (15.8 percent), intermediate in the thinned treat-
ment (14.7 percent), and lowest in the control (12.8 percent),
but these differences were not significant (P = 0.411) (fig. 6).
Tree Mortality
There was no mortality of the 146 trees between 1994 and
1996. However, four trees died between 1997 and 2000. Of
these dead trees, all were located in thinned or thinned +
burned plots. In thinned plots, 1 of 30 trees died. In thinned +
burned plots, 3 of 49 trees died. In control plots, 0 of 67 trees

died. Two of the trees that died in the thinned + burned
treatment broke or toppled in a severe windstorm following
a heavy, wet snow in 1997.
Discussion _____________________
Our results on changes in crown dieback of presettlement
trees over 6 years since initiation of the restoration treat-
ments are consistent with differences in tree radial growth
rate and rates of resource uptake reported by Feeney and
others (1998) and Stone and others (1999) for the first
3 years after treatment initiation. In these studies, thinning
increased uptake of nitrogen and water, stimulated radial
growth, and ameliorated effects of the 1996 drought on tree
growth. Further, most growth and physiological character-
istics were similar in the thinned and thinned + burned
treatments in the first 3 years after the initiation of treat-
ments (Feeney and others 1998). The increase in crown
dieback that occurred between 1994 and 2000 in the control,
coupled with the decrease in dieback in the thinned treat-
ments, suggest that improved resource uptake in the thinned
treatments has influenced carbon allocation to canopy growth
and maintenance processes. We note, however, that these
changes have been small in magnitude, which is not surpris-
ing considering the slow growth rate of old ponderosa pines.
Moreover, the increase in canopy dieback in the control
between 1994 and 2000 indicates a continued slow decline in
the condition of presettlement trees when competition from
postsettlement trees is severe.
Interestingly, both canopy dieback in 2000 and changes in
canopy dieback between 1994 and 2000 were not related to
tree age for ages between 100 and 450 years. This result
suggests that mortality of presettlement-aged ponderosa
pines at the GPNA is more strongly influenced by tree

tween 1994 and 2000 of presettlement ponderosa pines

cantly in Fisher’s Protected LSD tests (P < 0.01).
genotype or local variation in environment and disturbance
rather than tree age alone. We lack a clear understanding of
these factors, but we speculate that lightning strikes, other
disturbances, genetic variation in response to stress, and
perhaps local variation in rooting depth may be important
factors that contribute to canopy dieback at the GPNA.
Our results on tree mortality should be viewed with
caution because of the small number of trees assessed (146
over all treatments) and the small number of trees that died
(four over all treatments). With this caveat, we believe that
the occurrence of tree death by windthrow or wind breakage
exclusively in the thinned treatments is not a coincidence.
Our results suggest that windthrow and wind breakage are
more common for presettlement trees growing in open stands
that result from heavy thinning of postsettlement trees.
Given that severe winter weather with high winds is
common in ponderosa pines forests in northern Arizona,
tree death because of wind breakage and windthrow may
have been a common occurrence in open, savannalike
forests dominated by old-growth trees prior to Euro-Ameri-
can settlement.
Wind damage was not an obvious causal factor in the
death of two of the four presettlement trees that died in the
thinned treatments between 1997 and 2000. One explana-
tion is that thinning contributed to their death. However, we
note that both of these trees had large amounts of dieback
when the treatments were initiated. The tree that died in the
thinned + burned plot was classified as “alive but declining”
with a different crown classification system (Fulé and others
1997) in 1992, prior to initiation of the treatments. The tree
that died in the thinned plot had 40 percent dieback in the
1994 assessment of crown condition. Instead, we speculate
that these trees were already declining because of unknown
factors at the time of treatment initiation, and were subse-
quently severely stressed by the regional 1996 drought in
the Southwest. Further, bark beetle pitch tubes were evi-
dent in 2000 on both trees, suggesting a secondary role of
herbivory in mortality. This interpretation is consistent
with Manion’s (1991) model of tree decline where tree death
is often the result of predisposing and contributing factors
that occurred many years before mortality and acted to
reduce tree carbohydrate levels. Following this sequence of
events, tree defense against biotic agents and capacity to
recover from severe abiotic stress are diminished, and thus
mortality is imminent.
Conclusions____________________
In summary, our results indicate that heavy thinning of
postsettlement trees improved the crown condition of pre-
settlement trees at the GPNA over 6 years since treatment,
but also may have increased windthrow and wind breakage.
The effect of heavy thinning of postsettlement trees on wind
damage to presettlement trees should be addressed in other
ecological restoration experiments in ponderosa pine forests.
