Multivariate model 
General multivariate models have appeal when analyzing ecological systems because they 
have the potential to shed light on the relative importance of multifaceted factors. We 
hypothesized that plant community composition is a function of the interactions among 
three general constructs: abiotic and biotic factors and disturbance history. We sampled veg­
etation and soils on 75 randomly located 0.05 ha plots across a broad soil gradient within a 
110,000 ha ponderosa pine forest landscape in northern Arizona to evaluate this hypothesis. 
The variation in abundances of 271 understory plant species was reduced to two orthog­
onal axes using non-metric multidimensional scaling. We evaluated the relationships 
between ordination results and environmental conditions using two types of structural 
equation models. 'Specific' models provided a det ailed perspective of hypothesized rela ­
tionships among observed vari ables. A 'general' model was evaluated to address the general 
hypothesis stated above. The general model employed composite variables, which specify 
the combined effects of multiple factors on a response, in order to evaluate the relative 
importance of the three theoretical constructs. 
The results of the final specific model suggested that organic mailer and nitrogen 
explained unique variation in composition, but the 'total effects' of organic matter were 
not significant due to offsetting direct and indirect pathways. Soil texture and pH also con­
strained where m any plant species occurred. Elevation was a strong determinant of species 
distributions, and its effects could be propagated through a network of processes involving 
soil mineral and organic properties. Liller depth explained unique variation in community 
com position, suggesting that plant species differ in their ability to colonize sites with differ­
ent litter depths independent of the density of pine trees. Composition als o differed under 
varying densities of pine trees since species vary in their tolerance of a competitive over­
story. Finally, heavy grazing tended to favor the abundance of non-palatable species in the 
community. 
The results of the general model provided new insight into the underlying structu re of 
independent plant community gradients in ponderosa pine forests. The model suggested 
that abiotic factors generated one gradient in community composition, whereas biotic fac ­
tors, and to a lesser degree, disturbance history, generated a second independent gradient 
in community composition. Future evaluations of this composition model across a diversity 
of ecosystems could determine the generality and utility of this multivariate hypothesis.

Introduction 
A fundamental interest in community ecology is to under­
stand the main drivers of community composition. Debate 
over the existence and importance of assembly rules that 
determine the composition of natural communities is decades 
old (Diamond. J975; Stone el al., 1996; Booth and Larson, 1999; 
Sim berlotf et al., 1999), and much progress has been made 
(Weiher and Keddy, 1999b). It is generally agreed that both 
abiotic factors (e.g., elevation, soil texture) and biotic factors 
(e.g., shading, herbivory, interspecific competition) determine 
which species from the regional species pool can exist in a 
com munity (Booth an d Larson,1999;Weiher and Keddy, 1999a; 
but see Wilson, 1999). However, the debate over the relative 
importance of abiotic and biotic factors in regulating composi­
tion has not been adequately resolved (Simberloff et al., 1999), 
nor has the relative importance of disturbance (such as graz­
ing) in relation to abiotic and biotic factors been addressed 
(Diaz et al., J999). Moreover, a multivariate model of compo­
sition that permits an evaluation of the relative importance 
of abiotic and biotic factors and disturbance has not been for­
mally proposed or evaluated. General models such as those 
proposed by Grace and Pugesek (1997) are useful because they 
provide ecologists with the ability to test the generality of a 
theory across systems (Grace, 2006), which is becoming an 
increasingly important activity in ecology (e.g., Weiher, 2003; 
Knapp et al., 2004). Such a model could advance current under­
standing of the main drivers of plant community structure. 
Abiotic factors such as climate-driven responses to ele­
vation (Diaz et aI., 1999) and soil properties (Grace, 2003) 
can determine which plant species will colonize a site 
(Keddy and Weiher, 1999) because plant species differ in 
their tolerance and utilization of resources. These differences 
have been proposed as a driving mechanism of species co­
existence in similar environments (Tilman, 1982) and can also 
explain broad-scale compositional differences along multiple 
resource gradients (Grace, 2003; Kas hian et al., 2003). Once the 
regional species pool passes through the abiotic filters, the 
remaining species undergo further filtering by biotic interac­
tions and disturbance effects. Biotic factors such as overstory 
tree density can influence community composition because 
understory species differ in their ability to tolerate stresses 
imposed by competitive trees (Grime, 1979; Riegel et al., 1995; 
Nau mburg and DeWald, 1999; Lau ghlin et al., 2(05). Further­
more, disturbances can influence community composition by 
favoring stress-tolerant species (Grime, 1979) and increasing 
the abundance of annual and biennial plants (Hayes and Holl, 
2003; l.aughlin et aI., 2004, 2005). 
Evaluating community-environment 
relationships 
is 
quantitatively challenging since community matrices rep­
resent a complex multivariate response (Legendre and 
Legen dre, 1998). Analyses that simply regress multiple envi­
ronmental variables on axis scores derived from ordinations 
may satisfy distributional properties of the data (e.g., Lee 
an d Sam pso n, 2000). but these analyses have all the same 
problems of interpretation that befall multiple regression 
(Grace and Bollen, 2005). These problems include, but are not 
limited to (1) the unanalyzed and unresolved covariances 
among interacting explanatory variables and (2) the inability

Fig. 1 - Generalized conceptual model of factors influencing 
community composition. Model structure follows from 
diversity models developed in grasslands (Grace an d 
Pugesek, 1997; Weiher et al., 2004). savannas (Weiher, 
2003) and pine forests (Laughlin and Grace, 2006; Laughlin 
et al., 2007). 
to assign unique explanatory capacity to individual factors 
(P dhazur, 1997; Grace and Bollen, 2005). To avoid these 
problems, structural equation modeling has been proposed 
for testing multivariate theories of community composition 
(McCune and Grac e, 2002; .race, 2003). 
We developed a generalized conceptual model illustrated 
in Fig. 1. This model hypothesizes that community compo­
sition is controlled by the interactions of abiotic and biotic 
factors and disturbance history (Weiher and Keddy, 1999b).We 
included the possibilities that abiotic factors can have recipro­
cal relations with biotic factors, that disturbance history and 
abiotic factors could be associated because of land-use pat­
terns, and that disturbance might influence biotic factors. 
The a priori specific structural equation model is presented 
in Fig. 2. Following from the logic conceptualized in Fig. I, 
we hypothesized that community composition is associated 
with variations in elevation (Whittaker, 1960), soil properties 
(Crace, 2003; Kashian et al., 2003), tree density (Riegel t 31., 
1995; Naumburg an d DeWald, 1999; Laugh lin et 31., 2005), litter 
depth (Beatty and Sho les, 1988) and grazing (Stohlgren 
t a ., 
J999; Cingolani et al., 2005). Our primary purpose was to gain 
insight into the rela tive importance of processes that influence 
plant community composition by incorporating the potential 
interactions between system components into the model. In 
conjunction with this analysis, we sought to address a number 
of specific questions:

1.  Can organic matter and nitrogen have independent effects 
on composition? 
2.  Are associations between soil texture and composition 
explained entirely by indirect effects mediated through 
organic soil properties? 
3.  Can the effects of elevation on composition be propagated 
through a network of processes involving soil mineral and 
organic properties? 
4. Does  litter depth uniquely contribute to the variation 
observed in composition or is it merely a function of pine 
density? 
5.  Does composition differ under varying densities of pine 
trees? 
6.  Can grazing affect the composition of the community?

Methods 
2.1. 
Study system 
The ponderosa pine (Pinusponderosa P. & C. Lawson var. scopu­
lorum Engelm.) forest ecosystem covers millions ofhectares in 
the southwestern United States and occurs on a wide variety of 
soil parent materials including basalt, limestone, sandstone, 
and cinder soils. In this study we sampled vegetation within a 
110,000 ha landscape on the Northern Arizona University Cen­
tennial Forest and on the Coconino National Forest between 
the elevations of 1920-2660m. In the sampled area, pon­
derosa pine is the dominant tree species and forms extensive 
pure stands, but sometimes occurs with Gambel oak (Quercus 
gambelii Nutt.) or quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.). 
Precipitation ranges from 42 to 56 em yearr ", snowfall from 
152 to 233 em year-I. and mean maximum daily temperatures 
from 15.7 to 17.5 °C (Western Regional Climate Center. Reno, 
NY, USA).Topography is primarily flat or undulating (slope gra­
dients <10%). occa sionally dissected by cinder cones, ravines, 
and low hills . Volcanic activity has been widespread, with the 
most recent eruptions occurring ~900 years ago in the Sun­
set Crater Volcanic Field in the northeastern part of the study 
area (Moore et al., 1976). Soil parent materials include basalt, 
volcanic cinders, benmoreite, mixed igneous rocks, and lime­
stone (Welch and Klemmedson, 1975). Major soil subgroups 
are 1)rpic and Udic Argiborolls, Typic and Mollie Eutroboralfs, 
Typic Ustorthents, and Vitrandic Ustochrepts (Miller et ;]1., 
1995). 
2.2. 
Data collection 
We used a digital Terrestrial Ecosystem Survey (TES) map 
(Miller et al., 1995) in a Geographic Information System to 
randomly select mapping units for sampling in each of 11 
TES types that encompass a range of soil types. We randomly 
located 0.05 ha (20m x 25 m) plots within each mapping unit 
for a total of 75 plots. 
Plots were sampled during the period May-August 2003. 
At each plot. we collected composite soil samples of 0-15 em 
depths from two pits per plot. Samples were air dried, sieved 
(2mm), and analyzed for texture (hydrometer method), pH 
(1:2 soil:0.01 M CaCh), total nitrogen (with an elemental car­
bon/nitrogen analyzer), and organic matter (estimated from 
loss-on-ignition at 300°C for 2h), following methods outlined 
in Sparks (1996) and Dane an d Topp (2002). 
We sampled litter (Oihorizon) thickness and plant species 
composition in fifteen 1 m 2 subplots in each 0.05 ha plot. We 
visually categorized areal percent cover of each species rooted 
in each subplot as 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 1% up to 1% cover, at 1% 
intervals to 10%cover, and at 5%intervals above 10%cover. We 
also measured diameters at 1.4m of all live ponderosa pine 
>1em diameter on each plot to calculate pine basal area. 
Evidence of grazing was used to produce a coarse cat­
egorical variable where O=evidence of light grazing and 
1 = evidence of heavy grazing. This determination was based 
on field observations of severely grazed vegetation, proxim­
ity of plots to livestock tanks, and known areas where sheep 
and cattle are herded or kept. These determinations resulted 
in 4{)% of the plots being coded as having experienced recent 
heavy grazing. 
2.3. 
Data analysis 
If continuous soil properties could accurately predict the cor­
rect soil type from which the sample was taken. we decided 
it could be appropriate to use the continuous soil properties 
to explain patterns of composition across the landscape in 
lieu of the less informative alternative of simply using soil 
types as nominal predictors. To accomplish this, we used dis ­
criminant analysis (SASIns titut e. 2005). Discriminant analysis 
showed that continuous soil properties correctly predicted the 
soil type 88% of the time. An alternative, non-parametric dis­
criminant analysis test indicated that predictions were correct 
100% of the time. As a result of these findings, we felt justified 
in using continuous soil variables in lieu ofsoil types to repre­
sent the relationship between soil gradients and community 
composition. 
Many data reduction methods (e.g., detrended correspon­
dence analysis, and canonical correspondence analysis) used 
to analyze associations between community and environ­
mental gradients have been shown to perform poorly when 
applied to ecological community data (Beals, 1984; Min 'hi , 
1987; Jackso n and Somer s, 1991; Legendre an d Legend re, 
1998; McCune and Grace, 2002). Non-metric multidimensional 
scaling (NMS)has been suggested over other ordination tech­
niques for community analysis because it does not ignore 
community structure that is unrelated to environmental vari­
ables and it does not assume multivariate normality (McCune 
and Grace, 2002). Therefore, with cover values as a measure 
of species abundance, we used NMS using PC-OROsoftware 
(Version 4.25; M Cune and Mefford , 1999) to reduce the dimen­
sionality of the community matrix. We used the Bray-Curtis 
distance measure (Faith et al., 1987) with random starting 
configurations, 100 runs with real data, a maximum of 400 
iterations per run, and a stability criterion of0.00001. A Monte 
Carlo test with 99 randomizations was used to determine how 
likely the observed stress value of the final solution would 
be by chance alone. Species that occurred on <5% of the 
plots were omitted from the ordination following guidelines 
in McCune an d Grace (2002). 
We used PC-ORO to determine which continuous soil 
variables could explain at least 10%of the variation of an ordi­
nation axis, expressed as a vector on the ordination diagram

(Me .une an d Grace, 2002). We included in this analysis the 
following environmental variables: elevation, total nitrogen, 
organic matter, clay and sand concentrations, pH, pine basal 
area (rn? ha - 1) , and litter depth (em). We used Varimax rota­
tion on the ordination axes to maximize variance explained by 
pH and elevation following the procedure described by Grace 
(2003). 
Prior to evaluating multivariate models, bivariate rela­
tions between all variables in the model were assessed. We 
examined scatt erplots for the presence of outliers, evidence 
of skewness or kurtosis, and non-linear relationships up to 
second-order polynomials. Non-linear relationships between 
an explanatory variable and one ordination axis were mod­
eled by freeing paths from the explanatory variable to both 
ordination axes. 
2.4. 
Structural equation modeling 
Collinearity among explanatory variables can be problem­
atic in multiple regression analysis (Asher, 1983; Myers, 1990). 
However, SEM allows a researcher to theorize about why 
explanatory variables are correlated and to build directional 
relationships into their models of a system. For example, 
explanatory variables are often correlated because they have 
a common cause or because one factor influences th e other 
(Shipley, 2000). Indeed, these situations often occur in obser­
vational studies of complex systems. Therefore, in this study, 
we took such a systems approach to the analysis and interpre­
tation of composition in an ecosystem where driving forces 
interact to produce observed compositional patterns across 
the landscape. 
Th e use of structural equation models to understand 
ecological systems has gained momentum in recent years 
(Shipley, 2000; Pugesek et al., 2003; Grace, 2006; Arhonditsis et 
al., 2006). Structural equation modeling (SEM) is an extension 
ofregression and path analysis that can be used to model mul­
tivariate relations and to test multivariate hypotheses (Bollen, 
1989). Good-fitting structural equa tion models do not prove 
causal relationships (Bollen, 1989). Inferences about the sign 
and strength of directional paths in SEM can only be m ade if 
sound theory guides both the model building and the model­
fitting processes (Grace, 2006). 
We evaluated two types of structural equation models in 
this stu dy: 'specific' and 'general' models. 'Specific' models 
were evaluated to give a detailed perspective of relationships. 
The initial specific model (Fig. 2) represents what we believed 
to be the most plausible structural relations based on a pri ­
ori knowledge. We acknowledge that not all processes that 
act on composition in this system are represented in Fig. 2. 
Rather, our objective was to determine whether the data were 
consistent with the expectations of th e proposed model. Ulti­
mately, our goal was to arrive at a model consistent with the 
data using the fewest modifications of the initial model as 
possible, thereby preserving as much as possibl e th e ability 
to draw inferences from model parameters. We used maxi­
mum likelihood solution procedures and employed chi -square 
goodness of fit measures to evaluate model adequacy. Residu­
als and modification indices were also exami ned to determine 
if there were apparent model-data discrepancies, which in 
tum were used to identify alternative models for considera­
tion. Analyses were performed using Mplus software (Muthen 
and Muthen , 2005). The final structural equation model had 
a covariance structure th at was consistent with the covari­
ance structure of the data; therefore, we used theory to guide 
our interpretation of the mechanistic nature of the directional 
paths. 
The second type of structural equation model examined 
in this study was a 'general' model. These models are of the 
form in Fig. 1 and include composite variables in which com­
binations of effects are aggregated to address more general 
hypotheses. Generalized multivariate models such as these 
offer tremendous promise to ecology because they permit 
consideration of general constructs (e.g., disturbance) while 
allowing the specific factors (e.g., grazing versus flooding) to 
differ among systems (Grace, 2006). Moreover, ecological con­
structs such as 'abiotic factors' are very often multifaceted in 
nature (Gla ce and Bollen , in pr ess). Th e effects of elevation, 
pH, clay, organic matter, and nitrogen were composited into 
effects of 'abiotic factors'. The effects of pine density and lit­
ter depth were composited into effects of'biotic factors'. Since 
only one disturbance type was measured in this study, graz­
ing represented the effec t of recent 'disturba nce history'. We 
followed the general principles developed by Heise (1972) and 
refined by Grace and Bolle n (in press) for developing compos­
ites that represent general constructs. Composites estimate 
the combined effects of multiple factors on a single response 
variable. These procedures use a two-stage approach in which 
models are estimated without composites in the first stage. In 
the second stage, composites are included with zero error vari­
ance and with one incoming path fixed to a value of 1 so as to 
set the scale for the composites. Abiotic factors were scaled to 
elevation and biotic factors were scaled to pine density. 
Finally, we calculated the so-called 'total effects', which are 
the sum of direct and indirect pathways from the explanatory 
variables to composition (Grace, 2006). Indirect effects equal 
the total sum of th e products of all path segments from an 
explanatory variable to composition. Total effects are a simple 
summary of the complex and sometimes dual nature (oppos­
ing signs) of the relationship between the causal factors and 
community composition and they provide a calculation of the 
net effect (i.e., strength and sign ) of a relationship.

Results 
We identified 271 plant species within the plots across the 
study area. We included the 156 species that were found on 
>5% of the plots. A satisfactory two-dimensional solution was 
obtained using NMS ordination (Fig. 3). Thus, each ordination 
axis represented an independent gradient in species space. 
Nine variables, expressed as vectors in Fig. 3, appeared to be 
correlated with composition. 
Bivariate correlation analysis determined that axis 1 was 
significantly (p< 0.05) correlated with five of the nine variables 
in the model. Axis 1 exhibited positive linear relationships 
with nitrogen, organic matter, and elevation and negative lin­
ear relationships with pH and sand (Fig. 4). Axis 2 exhibited 
positive linear relationships with sand and pine basal area, 
negative linear relationships with nitrogen and clay, and non­
linear relations with litter (Fig. 5). Many of the factors proposed

to influence composition were also correlated with each other 
(Table 1), suggesting that the factors themselves interacted 
and that indirect effects on composition were likely in this 
system. 
The a priori specific structural equation model (Fig. 2) 
wa s found to be inconsistent with the data (x2 = 176 , 31 d.f., 
P <0.001). After controlling for other variables, sand did not 
explain unique vari ation in axis 1 despite its strong bivariate 
correlation (Table 1). and was therefore dropped to simplify 
the model. We added paths from clay to litter and nitrogen, 
and a path from litter to axis 1 (which accounted for the non ­
linear association with axis 2), since these were indicated to 
be missingbased on modification indices. The resulting model 
was found to not differ sign ificantly from the data (x2 =25.5, 22 
d.f., P=0.27) and explained 71% of the variation in axis 1, 61% 
of the vari ation in axis 2, 36% of th e vari ati on in litter, 80% 
of the variation in nitrogen , 48% of the vari ation in organic 
matter, and 20% of the variation in pH (Fig. 6). 
Elevation exhibited the strongest 'total effect' on axis 1 
(Table 2) due to its direct and many indirect relationsh ips with 
axis 1 (Fig. 6). The negative indirect effects of organic mat­
ter on ax is 1 (standardized path coefficient = -0.28) offset th e 
relatively strong pos itive direct effect (standardized path coef­
ficient = 0.44), yielding a non- significant 'total effect' (Table 2).

Th e analysis of th e general model (Fig. 1) in which some 
effects were composited produced a broader perspective of 
relationships (Fig. 7). The general model results show that 
abiotic factors were strongly related to axis 1, biotic factors 
were strongly related to axis 2, and disturbance exhibited a 
moderate relationship with axis 2.

Discussion 
We identified two independen t com positional gradients in 
ponderosa pine forest understory plant com m unities, sug­
gesting th at there were at least two underlying ecological 
processes that generated these gradients. Interestingly, the 
general model suggests that abiotic factors genera ted one 
compositional gradient and biotic factors and disturbance

history generated the second compositional gradient in this 
system. 
4.1. 
Abioticfactors 
The regional species pool can be strongly filtered by abi ­
otic factors. Variations in total nitrogen, which is primarily 
a function of organic matter in ponderosa pine forests (Welc h 
and lem medson, 1975), have been shown to have profound 
influences on community composition in many systems 
(Bradshaw, J969; Silvertown, J980; Tilman, 1982; Kirkham 
et al., 1996; Boyer and Zedler, 1999). This important abiotic 
gradient influences biotic interactions. Enrichment studies 
have demonstrated that plant dominance increases and even­
ness decreases with mineral fertilization (Lawes et al., 1882; 
Thu rston, 1969; Kirchner, 1977; Bakelaa r and Odurn , 1978). 
Interestingly, the bivariate relationship between nitrogen and 
axis 1 is positive, yet when organic matter is statistically 
controlled , the residual relationship between nitrogen and 
axis 1 was negative. This suggests that if we were to hold 
organic matter constant and increased levels of nitrogen, 
we might se e a shift in composition toward the negative 
end of axis 1 instead of toward the positive end. The struc­
ture of the model suggests that organic matter has unique 
effects on composition independent of soil nitrogen. How­
ever, the total effect of organic matter was not significant 
(Table 2), suggesting that the direct effects and indirect effects 
mediated through nitrogen were offsetting. Organic matter 
wa s a function of elevation because more organic matter is 
produced at elevations that receive more precipitation and 
because the higher elevation soils in the study area are finer 
textured. 
Soil moisture availability is determined largely by soil 
texture, which can influence the compo sition of the 
plant community (Rainer, J990; Barton, 1994) by affecting 
seedling germination, establishment and growth (Coffin and 
Lauenroth, 1994). Clay concentration was more important 
than sand concentration in this model because elevation 
explained the same information as sand concentration. Soil 
pH often affects plant community composition because plants 
differ in nutrient availability requirements and soil acid­
ity/basicity tole rances (van Raamsdo nk, 1988; Bridgham and 
Richardson, 1993). Soil pH was found to be influenced by ele­
vation in our study because soil parent materials of higher pH 
(e.g., limestone) occurred at lower elevations than soil parent 
materials oflower pH (e.g., basalt and benmoreite) (Abella an d 
covington , 2006a). It also is possible that lea ching rates were 
slower on low-elevation sites receiving less precipitation. 
Elevation has long been known to influence the compo­
sition of plant comm unities (Whittaker, 1960), and in this 
analysis elevation had the strongest total effects on one com­
pos itional gradient (Table 2). Changes in forest types are often 
observed along broad elevation gradients (f isher an d rule, 
2004),but thi s study was limited to a 740 m elevation zone that 
encompassed th e ponderosa pine ecosystem.The direct effect 
of elevation is likely due to a precipitation gradient. Thus, 
plant species that occurred at lower elevations are generally 
more drought tolerant (Abella and 
evington. 2006b). How­
ever, th e model suggests th at three indirect effects of elevation 
on composition were mediated through pH, organic matter, 

238 
EC OLO G I C A L MODEL LtNG 205 ( 2 0 07) 231-240 
and total nitrogen. Thus, the effects of elevation on composi­
tion are complex and involve many indirect pathways. 
4.2. 
Bioticfacrors 
Species that pass through the abiotic filters are further 
affected by biotic interactions. The biotic filters in this model 
are driven by the density of the overstory pine trees and 
the amount of needle cast that these pine trees produce. 
Plant species appeared to respond to varying levels of pine 
litter depth. This association was independent of pine abun­
dance, suggesting that if pine was held constant, variations 
in litter depth could shift community composition. Plants 
are known to respond to experimental manipulation of litter 
depths (Beatty and Sho les, 1988; Facelli a nd Pickett , 1991), and 
the mechanism behind these effects likely involves germina­
bon requirements of plants (Sydes nd Grime, 1981). Annual 
species, for instance, have been suggested to respond to lit­
ter consumption after fires due to increased availability of 
exposed mineral soil (Laughlin er al., 2004, 2005). This relation 
deserves further study, however, since experimental removals 
of ponderosa pine litter have not induced short-term plant 
community responses (Abella and Covington, in press). 
Pine basal area had the strongest total effect on axis 2 
(Table 2). Understory species tolerate different levels of shad ­
ing ( a umb urg and DeWald, 1999), and water and mineral 
resources (Riegel et al., 1995), both of which vary with pine 
density (Welch a nd Kle mmedson, 1975; Kaye and Han , 1998). 
In addition, pine basal area indirectly affected composition by 
driving the variation in litter depth. 
4.3. 
Disturbance 
Grazing effects appeared less important than abiotic and biotic 
factors in explaining the observed spatial variation in vegeta­
tion.The model results imply that ungulate (cattle, sheep, deer 
and elk) grazing might directly influence plant community 
composition. Heavy gra zing can shift the com m u nity toward 
greater abundance of unpalatable species (Westoby et a!., 1989; 
O'Connor, 1991). A few unpalatable species, including broom 
snakeweed (Gutierrez ia sarothrae (Pursh) Britt. & Rusby) and 
spreading fleabane (Erigeron diuergens Torr. & Gray) , were most 
abundant in the heavily grazed plots (Abella and Covington, 
2006a). 
Ponderosa pine forest structure and plant community com­
position are strongly influenced by frequent surface fires 
(Covingt on and Moore, 1994; Fule et al., 1997; Moore et al., 
2006). Fire as a disturbance process is conspicuously absent 
from this model due to a lack of data. Future composition mod­
els in this system should include fire effects, which have been 
shown to shift composition by increasing the abundances of 
annual and biennial forbs (Craw ford " I al., 2001; Laughlin p I 
al. , 2004). 
4.4. 
Conclusions 
The model provides an adequate explanation of the vari­
ance in composition, but it has limited predictive capacities at 
present due to the complicated dimensionality of the compo­
sitional response variables and to the descriptive nature of the 
s tudy de sign. Nevertheless, this model suggests that commu­
nity composition is under multivariate control in ponderosa 
pine forests in the southwestern United States. It seems that 
the regional species pool is filtered by abiotic gradients, biotic 
gradients and grazing effects to produce the plant commu­
nity assemblages that occur across the landscape. Our general 
model results suggest that abiotic factors drive one composi­
tional gradient and that biotic factors and, to a lesser degree, 
disturbance history, drive the other independent composi­
tional gradient. Evaluations of multivariate models of s pecies 
richness across a wide variety of systems have advanced our 
understanding of the general factors th at drive diversity (e.g., 
Grace an d Pugesek, 1997; Weiher, 2003; Laugh lin and Grac e, 
2006; Laughlin et al., 2007). Likewise, future evaluations of the 
general composition model proposed here across a variety of 
different systems could determine the generality and utility 
of this multivariate hypothesis.
