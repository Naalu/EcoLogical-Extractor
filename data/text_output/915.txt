New Director of Forest Operations and Biomass
Utilization
Dr. Han-Sup Han has joined the Ecological Restoration Institute as its new
director of forest operations and biomass utilization, bringing 20 years of
experience evaluating the economics and operational efﬁciencies of various
timber and biomass harvesting systems. Dr. Han will lead a new program to
help accelerate the pace and scale of restoration by advancing efforts to
establish a forest operations and wood utilization research, development and
applications center in northern Arizona. 

Dr. Han will work collaboratively with NAU forest scientists, private industry and
land management agencies to improve the efﬁciency and economics of harvest
operations and the utilization of wood for a wide range of forest products. His
work also will focus on lessening the environmental impacts on soils and water
quality that potentially occur from thinning treatments designed to reduce ﬁre
danger and improve forest health.
“I am excited about my opportunity here at ERI and NAU,” Han said. “In my
experience working with forest ecologists, silviculturists and policymakers, the
challenge to improving forest health and achieving restoration is ﬁnding the
right operational tools, setting up optimal operational logistics, and making the
best use of wood and biomass to get the work done in an environmentally
acceptable and ﬁnancially reasonable manner.”

potential wildland ﬁre suppression costs due to restoration treatments in
northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests. Forest Policy and Economics, 87:
101–114.
 
With growing concern over wildﬁre suppression costs, this analysis addresses
restoration treatment effectiveness in reducing wildﬁre suppression costs.
Researchers found that more comprehensive treatments are more effective in
reducing wildﬁre suppression costs, except in the case of severe wind and
weather events.

Wildﬁre on a Ponderosa Pine Landscape in Northern Arizona. ERI Fact Sheet.
Ecological Restoration Institute, Northern Arizona University. 2 p.
 
Researchers tested the assertion that restoration objectives could be met
incrementally by allowing repeated, low-severity ﬁres to reburn sites. Findings
suggest that managing wildﬁres to allow for more moderate severity burning
with a single entry may be more effective for restoring ponderosa pine forests
than repeated, low-severity entries.

This fact sheet summarizes a study that compared restoration prescriptions
based on historical reference conditions of forest assemblages to those based
on traits of well-adapted species. To restore resilient ecosystems, practitioners
can select species with favorable trait combinations to reduce mortality risk
under changing environmental conditions.

This study examined spatial patterns of ponderosa pine regeneration, and
interactions with sprouting species near live forest edges and the interiors of
high-severity burn patches. An important implication is that managers may want
to take a “wait and see” approach to monitor natural regeneration over time
before replanting in some areas.

Researchers investigated the abiotic factors that may have led to variation in
the natural ranges of variation on 33 stem-mapped sites in Arizona and New
Mexico. Results show that variability was an inherent component of ponderosa
pine-dominated forests and that knowledge of growth conditions and abiotic
factors on a site can be helpful to localize historical forest conditions in an area.

Working Paper No. 38. Ecological Restoration Institute, Northern Arizona

ERI researchers reviewed and summarized available literature to describe pre-
Euro-American ﬁre regimes, historical forest structure, and impacts of
settlement on ponderosa pine forests associated with interior chaparral and
Madrean evergreen woodland biotic communities. Published studies found an
increase in understory shrubs in forests where frequent surface ﬁre has been
excluded. 
 
News from the Field

Research and Development – 2018 Summer Field Season Outlook
By Dustin Hanna, Research Coordinator
Prescott and Tonto National Forests 
This year’s ERI summer ﬁeld season will again feature the Prescott and Tonto
national forests. The ﬁeld crews will be gathering forest structure, fuel loads,
and herbaceous understory measurements, which will help to characterize the
ecological outcomes of a variety of restoration and hazardous fuels treatments.
These treatments will include practices such as overstory tree thinning,
prescribed burning, and mastication (chopping and grinding of woody material
to reduce ﬁre hazard). This information, coupled with the historical reference
information gathered last season, will provide forest managers with data that
will help evaluate current treatment plans and develop management trajectories
into the future.
 
Mt. Trumbull Ecosystem Restoration Project
As part of the 2018 ﬁeld season, the ERI will continue work at one of the
longest running ponderosa pine restoration projects located in northwestern
Arizona, on the Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument near Mt.
Trumbull. This year, we will continue to remeasure plots originally installed in
1996 and 1997 prior to the implementation of landscape-scale restoration
treatments (thinning plus prescribed burning). We will collect forest structure,
surface fuels, and herbaceous understory in addition to collecting increment
core samples from a sub-sample of trees. The data collected this summer will

allow us to assess treatment effectiveness after more than 20 years since the
original data was collected. This information will add to the important
knowledge gained over more than two decades in this longstanding,
landscape-scale restoration project in a valuable ponderosa pine ecosystem.
 
ERI Science Delivery and Outreach News 
By Tzeidle Wasserman, Post-Doctoral Researcher
We are committed to assessing the latest science needs and
communicating restoration science to our land management partners to better
meet forest management goals. A few highlights across this broad program of
work include:
West-Wide
The ERI partnered with Dr. Alan Ager at the Rocky Mountain Research Station
(RMRS) to translate and facilitate the use of an All-Lands Wildﬁre Risk and
Transmission Framework in Arizona. The goals were to introduce a cross-
boundary wildﬁre risk model, initiate conversations around multi-jurisdictional

planning and coordination, and facilitate an all-lands approach to wildﬁre risk
reduction. We held a well-attended All-Lands workshop in Prescott and a
roundtable in Flagstaff to present this work, which was conducted in close
collaboration with RMRS and the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire
Management.
Region-Wide
We partnered with the Coronado National Forest on a demonstration project in
a dry mixed-conifer stand within the Pinaleños Mountains. Information from this
demo project was presented in a technical workshop at the Southwest Chapter
meeting of the Society of American Foresters. This project examined how
forest conditions have changed through time since ﬁre exclusion dates and
tested how to develop thinning treatments that best restore the forest to
conditions more similar to their natural range of variability. Future work includes
assessing demonstration response to the Fry Fire, which burned the site in
June 2017, and future interpretation needs for forest practitioners and the
public.
Forest Projects
As part of the Kaibab National Forest’s (KNF) Forest Plan, the ERI partnered
with KNF to collect rapid plot data for forest plan monitoring in an effort to move
toward desired conditions and support adaptive management. Our objectives
were to collect baseline data on current stand conditions, use pre-settlement
evidence to inform the natural range of variability, and aid land managers’
understanding of landscape-level conditions. We developed recommendations
for incorporating partner data into Forest Service corporate databases,
integrating forest-level monitoring with regional monitoring efforts, and identiﬁed
opportunities for engaging partner and citizen science.
 
Partner Spotlight

Prescott National Forest
Comprised of about 1.25 million acres, the Prescott National Forest (NF) in
Arizona features diverse vegetation types, from chaparral to piñon pine, juniper
and ponderosa pine. The ERI partners with the Prescott NF as well as
colleagues at Prescott College to study historical conditions and treatment
responses in the transitional ponderosa pine forests below the Mogollon Rim.
Due to intermixing with chaparral vegetation, these forests present unique
challenges for fuels management and restoration. For more info about Prescott
NF, visit their website.
 
NAU is an equal opportunity provider. 
ERI's research is funded by many sources, including the USDA Forest Service and the AZ Board of
Regents through the Technology, Research and Innovation Fund (TRIF).
