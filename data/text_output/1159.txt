Significance
Wildfires in the western United 
States are concerning in part 
because conifer forests may not 
regenerate under increasingly 
warm, dry climate conditions and 
severe burning. This study 
compared the relative importance 
of differences in fire-caused tree 
mortality, which limits seeds 
available for tree regeneration, to 
the impacts of warm, dry climate 
conditions in determining postfire 
conifer regeneration. Using 
observations from over 10,000 
sites, we found that warmer, drier 
conditions are leading to less tree 
regeneration after wildfires. We 
also found evidence that 
management interventions that 
reduce wildfire severity can 
partially offset these climate-
related declines in tree 
regeneration. Our work highlights 
the next few decades as a window 
of opportunity over which 
management could minimize the 
likelihood of fire-caused forest loss.

Increasing fire severity and warmer, drier postfire conditions are making forests in the 
western United States (West) vulnerable to ecological transformation. Yet, the relative 
importance of and interactions between these drivers of forest change remain unresolved, 
particularly over upcoming decades. Here, we assess how the interactive impacts of chang-
ing climate and wildfire activity influenced conifer regeneration after 334 wildfires, using 
a dataset of postfire conifer regeneration from 10,230 field plots. Our findings highlight 
declining regeneration capacity across the West over the past four decades for the eight 
dominant conifer species studied. Postfire regeneration is sensitive to high-severity fire, 
which limits seed availability, and postfire climate, which influences seedling establish-
ment. In the near-term, projected differences in recruitment probability between low- and 
high-severity fire scenarios were larger than projected climate change impacts for most 
species, suggesting that reductions in fire severity, and resultant impacts on seed avail-
ability, could partially offset expected climate-driven declines in postfire regeneration. 
Across 40 to 42% of the study area, we project postfire conifer regeneration to be likely 
following low-severity but not high-severity fire under future climate scenarios (2031 to 
2050). However, increasingly warm, dry climate conditions are projected to eventually 
outweigh the influence of fire severity and seed availability. The percent of the study area 
considered unlikely to experience conifer regeneration, regardless of fire severity, increased 
from 5% in 1981 to 2000 to 26 to 31% by mid-century, highlighting a limited time 
window over which management actions that reduce fire severity may effectively support 
postfire conifer regeneration.

Ecological transformation due to climate change is a global phenomenon with significant 
socioecological impacts, including changes to carbon storage, water quality, biodiversity, 
and culturally important resources (1–3). Forests globally are increasingly vulnerable to 
ecological transformation due to changing climatic conditions that simultaneously increase 
wildfire activity (4–7) and alter key postfire demographic rates such as seedling establish-
ment (8, 9), a phenomenon broadly termed “interval squeeze” (10). Declines in tree 
recruitment have been observed globally, causing widespread concerns about forest loss 
following wildfires and other disturbances (1, 3, 11–13).
Conifer forests of the western United States (West) may be especially vulnerable to 
ecological transformation because climate change impacts are compounded by more than 
a century of wildfire suppression, exclusion of indigenous burning, logging of large fire-re-
sistant trees, and other forest management practices (14, 15). Together, these changes have 
fundamentally altered forest structure, composition, and fire regimes and are leading to 
more severe fire effects in many forests that historically experienced low- and moderate-se-
verity fire (14). High-severity fire sets the stage for ecological transformation by killing 
mature trees, altering microclimate (16) and soil properties (17), and reducing seed sources 
on the landscape. Even in forests that historically burned in stand-replacing fires, recent 
changes in fire frequency and postfire climate may significantly alter vegetation trajectories 
following high-severity fire (3, 12, 18–20).
The combination of changes in fire regimes and climate is driving declines in postfire 
conifer regeneration across the West (21–24). Yet, despite the abundance of postfire tree

regeneration data that have been collected in the West, the relative 
importance, interactions, and feedbacks between these two drivers 
of conifer regeneration are poorly resolved at the regional scale. 
This knowledge is crucial for identifying vulnerability to ecological 
transformation and key opportunities for potential management 
interventions. For instance, local management actions can readily 
and rapidly drive changes in fuel and forest structure, an important 
driver of fire severity, but have limited immediate impact on mac-
roscale climate conditions. There is substantial evidence that fuel 
reduction treatments, especially those using prescribed burning, 
effectively reduce local wildfire severity in dry forests (25, 26). 
Significant increases in government investment in these types of 
treatments in the United States, including $3 billion dedicated to 
a 10-y strategy to reduce fuels across 20 million ha (27, 28), high-
light the need for spatial prioritization of treatments.
Forward-looking management approaches, such as the Resist-
Accept-Direct (RAD) framework (2, 29), also require quantitative 
information on the probability of fire-driven ecological transforma-
tion. The RAD framework, which shares similarities with previous 
frameworks (30, 31), helps managers make informed, deliberate 
choices about the trajectory of change when managing systems under-
going rapid ecological transformation. Effectively prioritizing where 
to resist, accept, or direct postfire vegetation trajectories requires an 
understanding not only of the likelihood of postfire ecological trans-
formation, but also of where reducing fire severity through manage-
ment interventions could change this likelihood (32, 33), and when 
and where climate conditions have crossed critical thresholds that 
may preclude forest recovery (9), regardless of fire severity.
Here, we resolve how the interactive impacts of changing climate 
and fire severity have influenced postfire conifer regeneration across 
western US forests. We use a dataset of postfire conifer regeneration 
from 10,230 field plots that represents 334 fires that occurred between 
1984 and 2018 (Fig. 1 and Dataset S1) and spans the climatic range 
of eight widespread conifer species across the West (white fir, Abies 
concolor; grand fir, Abies grandis; subalpine fir, Abies lasiocarpa; 
Engelmann spruce, Picea engelmannii; lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta; 
Jeffrey pine, Pinus jeffreyi; ponderosa pine, Pinus ponderosa; and 
Douglas-fir, Pseudotsuga menziesii). Together, these species represent 
89% of the conifer basal area in the study area [Fig. 1A; (34)]. All 
species are obligate seeders. The interior subspecies of P. contorta (spp. 
latifolia) can be serotinous and regenerate prolifically following 
high-severity fire, although levels of serotiny vary widely among indi-
viduals and populations (35). We used these field data to model post-
fire recruitment probability for each species individually and for all 
species combined as a function of biophysical predictors representing 
seed availability, fire severity, 30-y mean climate, and postfire climate 
(SI Appendix, Table S1). Models for P. ponderosa and P. jeffreyi and for 
A. concolor and A. grandis were combined (see Methods) for a total of 
six species models. These models reveal key drivers of postfire conifer 
regeneration across western US conifer forests. We use these models 
to project postfire recruitment probability under multiple scenarios 
of fire severity (low- and high-severity) and climate change (2031 to 
2050; Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5; 
SI Appendix, Tables S2 and S4). We are thus able to: 1) compare the 
relative impacts of changes in climate and fire severity on postfire 
conifer regeneration across the West; 2) assess how these impacts vary 
by region and species; and 3) identify when and where climate change 
is likely to cause postfire seedling recruitment failure and resulting 
ecological transformation. We discuss the implications of our results 
for forest management using the RAD framework.

western United States. The likelihood of postfire regeneration 
for all species declined under future climate scenarios across 
the study area (Fig. 2). For example, the percent of the study 
area considered likely to experience regeneration (recruitment 
probability > 0.54) by 10 y postfire decreased from 95% in 1981 
to 2000 to 74% by 2031 to 2050 under RCP 4.5 in projections 
from the all-species model.
Importantly, spatial and temporal patterns of change in recruit-
ment probability varied by species and region (Fig. 3 and 
SI Appendix, Figs. S15–S26). Lower elevation species (P. ponderosa, 
P. jeffreyi, P. menziesii, A. concolor, and A. grandis) have already 
experienced a significant decline in recruitment probability 
between the 1981 to 2000 and the 2001 to 2020 time periods, 
while higher elevation species such as P. contorta and P. engelmannii 
are predicted to experience more declines in the coming decades 
in some regions (Fig. 3). Likewise, forests in the California and 
Klamath (CAK) and southern Rockies and AZ/NM mountain 
(SRSW) regions (Fig. 1A) saw significant declines in recruitment 
probability over the same time period, and we project similar 
patterns to expand northward by 2050, especially in drier forests 
of the interior Northwest (INW; Figs. 2 and 3). However, wetter 
and cooler portions of the INW and much of the northern Rockies 
(NR) were projected to remain climatically suitable for postfire 
regeneration of the study species through mid-century. Although 
there was some variability in future projections among global cli-
mate models (GCMs), the general patterns were consistent 
(SI Appendix, Figs. S13 and S14).
Reductions in Fire Severity Can Ameliorate Impacts of Climate 
Change. Our results suggest reductions in overall fire severity 
or the size of high-severity patches could partially offset expected 
declines in postfire regeneration attributed to climate change alone. 
In our projections across the study area, changes in fire severity, which 
included changes to seed availability, had a greater relative effect on 
recruitment probabilities than did changing climate conditions for 
most species, with the exception of P. contorta, which due to its 
serotinous cones can regenerate prolifically following high severity fire 
in some areas (Figs. 2 and 3 and SI Appendix, Figs. S9 and S15–S26). 
For example, when we projected recruitment across the study area 
for all species under climate and fire severity scenarios, median 
recruitment probability decreased by an average of 0.34 with a 
change from low to high fire severity, as opposed to a decrease of 
only 0.12 on average due to climate change in successive time 
periods (SI Appendix, Table S17). In a substantial portion of the 
study area (26 to 42%, 17 to 28 million ha, depending on time 
period and future climate scenario; SI  Appendix, Table  S18), 
postfire conifer regeneration was likely (probability > 0.54) in 
the low-severity scenario but unlikely in the high-severity scenario 
(Fig. 2C). The effect of fire severity was most pronounced in the 
NR and least pronounced for dry forest species like P. ponderosa 
and P. menziesii in the SRSW, where climate and fire severity had 
similar impacts (Figs. 2 and 3 and SI Appendix, Fig. S9).
Fire severity interacted significantly with climate such that high 
fire severity exacerbated the impacts of warm, dry postfire climate 
for several species and in the all-species model (Fig. 4C and 
SI Appendix, Figs. S2–S4). For example, for both P. ponderosa and 
P. menziesii, the reduction in recruitment probability associated 
with high climatic water deficit (“water deficit”) following fire was 
stronger in areas that burned at high severity than in areas that 
burned at low severity (SI Appendix, Figs. S2 and S3). For the true 
fir species (Abies spp.), we found similar interactions between 
postfire climate and surrounding tree cover (within 300 m), which 
is correlated with the proportion of the area surrounding a plot 
that burned at high severity (SI Appendix, Figs. S4–S7). In areas 
with more remaining live tree cover postfire, the effects of warm, 
dry postfire climate were ameliorated. Under future climate con-
ditions, these interactions led to greater projected declines in 
recruitment probability in the high- than low-severity scenario for 
some species (e.g., Fig. 3, A. concolor/A. grandis and P. menziesii; 
SI Appendix, Figs. S18 and S20).
Seed Availability and Moisture Deficits Control Postfire 
Conifer Regeneration. Postfire recruitment probability was 
strongly related to metrics of seed availability and fire severity 
(Fig. 4 and SI Appendix, Figs. S2–S7 and Tables S9–S15). For 
each species, recruitment declined at farther distances from 
the nearest seed source and when surrounding tree cover was 
lower—indicating fewer living trees within plausible dispersal 
distances to provide seeds—a situation that may arise in areas 
with larger high-severity patches (36). The effect of satellite-
derived fire severity metrics varied by species, with ecologically 
coherent patterns: recruitment probability declined at higher fire 
severities with relatively shade-tolerant P. menziesii and true firs 
(Abies spp.); in contrast, after accounting for seed availability, 
recruitment probability increased with higher fire severity for the 
Rocky Mountain varieties of the shade-intolerant P. contorta and 
P. ponderosa (SI Appendix, Figs. S2–S7). Notably, Rocky Mountain 
P. contorta (spp. latifolia) exhibits cone serotiny, which facilitates 
recruitment in areas burned at high severity (35).
Postfire conifer regeneration also strongly depended on both 
average climate conditions and postfire climate anomalies. In both 
cases, climate metrics reflecting water availability to trees were the 
most influential in statistical models. Considering all-species com-
bined, seedlings were more sensitive to postfire climate conditions 
when they were present in warm, dry sites, as indicated by higher 
mean water deficit (Fig. 4E). Additionally, warmer, drier sites also 
had 
lower 
postfire 
recruitment 
probabilities 
overall 
(Fig. 4D and SI Appendix, Figs. S2–S7). A single hot, dry year 
(high growing season water deficit) within the first 5 y following 
a fire significantly reduced the probability of postfire regeneration 
for most species (i.e., P. ponderosa/P. jeffreyi, P. contorta, A. lasio-
carpa, P. menziesii) and when considering all species combined 
(Fig. 4E and SI Appendix, Figs. S2–S7). Each species except sub-
alpine fir also experienced an increase in recruitment probability 
if there was at least one unusually cool, wet year following fire 
(Fig. 4F and SI Appendix, Figs. S2–S7), represented by high grow-
ing season precipitation (P. ponderosa/P. jeffreyi, P. contorta), low 
growing season water deficit (P. engelmannii, P. menziesii), or low 
summer vapor pressure deficit (A. concolor/A. grandis).
Discussion
Our analyses shed light on the interactive impacts of changing cli-
mate and fire severity on past and likely future postfire conifer 
regeneration across a broad region of the West. Climate change over 
the past four decades has already led to significant reductions in the 
probability of conifer regeneration after wildfires across this region, 
and we project that climate will increasingly limit postfire tree 
recruitment in the future, consistent with the interval squeeze phe-
nomenon. Consequently, we expect postfire ecological transforma-
tion will become more likely, underscoring the importance of the 
Resist-Accept-Direct (RAD) framework for informing prefire and 
postfire management decisions (37). Equally important, however, 
we also project continued successful conifer regeneration in many 
areas, especially the northern Rockies and higher elevation forests.
Despite the importance of climate for postfire conifer recruit-
ment, we found that fire severity had a larger relative impact on 
projected recruitment probability than the direct effects of

near-term climate change for most species studied here. Fire sever-
ity impacted recruitment probability directly via impacts to seed 
supply and indirectly by exacerbating the effects of dry postfire 
climate, potentially through changes to microclimate (16), soil 
properties (17) or competing vegetation. Changes to fire regimes 
resulting from fire suppression policies, past management prac-
tices, or climate change that have increased the likelihood of high 
fire severity and increased high-severity patch sizes (5, 6, 14, 38) 
may be playing a larger role driving reductions in postfire conifer 
regeneration than direct climate impacts alone. Our work resolves 
key ecological uncertainties across a broad spatial extent and high-
lights significant opportunities to influence postfire regeneration 
and resist ecological transformation through management to 
reduce fire severity in some forests (26, 32).

While reduced fire severity and subsequent increases in seed avail-
ability can partly ameliorate the impacts of increasing moisture 
deficits on postfire conifer regeneration, there are important limi-
tations to this tradeoff. First, a warming climate has been associated 
with more area burning at high severity in recent decades (5, 6). 
Thus, climate change impacts postfire recruitment directly by cre-
ating warmer, drier conditions after fire and indirectly through an 
increase in high-severity fire. Second, our work highlights the critical 
importance of understanding climate thresholds for recruitment (9, 
18). During years when climate exceeds the moisture deficit thresh-
olds that can support postfire conifer germination and seedling 
survival, regeneration is unlikely regardless of fire severity. The more 
pronounced effect of postfire climate at dry sites (Fig. 4E) suggests 
that as average climate conditions become warmer and drier, these 
thresholds limiting conifer recruitment will be crossed more fre-
quently (9, 39). Importantly, experiencing just 1 y with a high 
moisture deficit within the first 5 y following fire significantly 
decreased the likelihood of postfire conifer recruitment. Combined, 
these limitations suggest that efforts to resist loss of western US 
forests via reductions in fire severity may only be effective during a 
relatively short period over the upcoming decades, a window of 
opportunity that varies by ecoregion and forest type. Managers and 
decision makers may thus wish to prioritize interventions in forests 
most vulnerable to fire-driven forest loss (e.g., dry forests of the 
Southwest and California) where this window is expected to close 
within the next few decades.
By identifying where and when fire-driven transformation is 
likely, our near-term projections of recruitment probability can 
inform management choices to resist, accept, or direct postfire veg-
etation transitions when applying the RAD framework (2, 29). 
These decisions are highly context-specific, informed by potential 
future conditions, local management goals, and integrating 
social-ecological factors beyond this work (29, 33, 40, 41). 
Nonetheless, our results provide insight into the tradeoffs between 
these choices. For example, in areas of severe climate limitations on 
recruitment of current species, management to resist change will 
only delay change and it may be prudent to consider how to direct 
change in those areas; however, in areas of continued climate suit-
ability investment in resisting change may yield longer-term results.
Decision constraints and opportunities vary throughout conifer 
forests of the western United States depending on forest type, 
historical land use patterns, and historical fire regimes (15). In 
lower elevation dry conifer forests that historically experienced 
frequent fire, our results highlight the potential to resist fire-driven 
transformations from forest to nonforest through management 
activities that effectively reduce fire severity [e.g., treatments 
including forest thinning and reduction of surface fuels with pre-
scribed or cultural fire (25, 26)]. Identifying areas where a reduc-
tion in fire severity will have the highest potential to mitigate 
postfire conifer regeneration failure (Fig. 2C) may help to prior-
itize locations for management activities. Despite the potential 
benefits of effective management interventions, wildfire affects 
much more area than management actions may be able to feasibly 
treat (42), highlighting the need to proactively integrate managed 
wildfire with other strategies to reduce fuels and enhance ecosys-
tem resilience across large landscapes (25, 43). Where climate is

already unsuitable for conifer regeneration, managers may decide 
to accept transitions to other vegetation types where key manage-
ment goals can still be met, vital ecosystem services are sustained 
or stabilized, or nonconifer or early-successional habitat (e.g., oak 
woodlands, shrublands) are established in areas where these habitat 
types are limited compared with their historical extent (14, 15, 
44). In other cases, historically unprecedented large high-severity 
patches dominated by nonforest vegetation types may homogenize 
landscape patterns and/or lead to novel species assemblages  
(5, 45, 46). Where accepting change would be undesirable from 
a societal or management perspective, managers may consider 
directing change toward more desirable conditions, for example 
by planting drought and fire-resistant species or genotypes (includ-
ing Populus tremuloides or Quercus spp. that resprout following 
fire) or planting at lower densities (33, 40, 47–49). Given signif-
icant uncertainty about the longer term impacts of directing

change (40, 49, 50), adaptive management and monitoring 
approaches will be particularly important (51).
Subalpine conifer forests in our study area have been resilient to 
high-severity fire for millennia (e.g., refs. 52 and 53). However, our 
results suggest that changes to climate (Fig. 3), combined with 
changes to forest structure (14) and the frequency of burning  
(19, 54, 55), have altered the conditions that made these forests 
historically resilient to high-severity burning, even in contemporary 
forests where serotinous P. contorta is present. Postfire forest recovery 
in these systems occurs over decades to centuries (52), and continues 
to be likely in much of the northern Rockies (Figs. 3 and 4 and 
SI Appendix, Figs. S21–S26); however, in some areas such as the 
southern Rockies, the suitable climate window for regeneration is 
rapidly closing. Where climate is currently conducive to conifer estab-
lishment but will become unsuitable in the coming decades, managers 
may be able to resist changes in the short-term by postfire planting 
or seeding (33). Longer term resistance may be challenging in these 
forest types given the historical high-severity fire regimes and increas-
ing potential for short-interval fire. Thus, as in lower elevation forests, 
periods immediately after fire may also provide opportunities to direct 
change toward species or genotypes that are better adapted to future 
climate conditions and fire regimes (33, 56). Where we project low 
recruitment probability, in both subalpine and lower elevation forests, 
the relatively coarse scale of our climate data (4-km resolution) may 
underestimate the role that local site factors, microclimate, and dis-
turbance refugia (57–59) play in supporting postfire tree regeneration 
and forest persistence (60); thus identifying and protecting these 
refugia will be critical if the goal is to retain conifer forests (33, 40).
Our work highlights several key drivers of postfire conifer regen-
eration, but the broadscale nature of our study means that we could 
not account for local and microsite conditions, fine-scale weather 
events, intraspecific variation, cone serotiny, or phenotypic plasticity. 
For example, competition or facilitation from shrubs (23, 61), seed 
dispersal and predation (36, 62), interannual variation in seed pro-
duction (63), pathogens, herbivory, or edaphic factors not captured 
in our models may affect conifer establishment and likely vary across 
our study area. Short-term exposure to extreme conditions [e.g., 
high soil surface temperatures (64)] can also cause seedling mortal-
ity. Additionally, the level of serotiny in P. contorta stands strongly 
impacts forest development after high severity fire (24, 35). We 
stress that such fine-scale patterns and processes are essential to 
regeneration dynamics and should be explicitly considered in devel-
oping site-specific management strategies (33, 40). Furthermore, 
while we project reduced recruitment potential within the range of 
the study species, in some cases fire may provide an opportunity for 
tree species to establish beyond their current range (e.g., ref. 65). 
Finally, by combining data from multiple studies with different field 
methods, we also introduce additional uncertainty.
We project that a substantial portion of the forests in our study 
region will experience declines in postfire conifer regeneration, 
which would have major implications for ecosystem structure and 
function. These results highlight the need to better understand what 
type of ecosystems will replace these forests when regeneration 
fails—likely to vary greatly by region—and the implications for 
carbon sequestration, hydrology, wildlife habitat, and other key 
ecosystem services on which society depends. Despite the pro-
nounced impact of climate change, the stark contrast in the projec-
tions of conifer recruitment probability from the low- and 
high-severity scenarios emphasize how management actions taken 
to reduce fire severity can significantly shape postfire vegetation 
trajectories. Identifying whether, when, and where management 
intervention is appropriate to resist or direct trajectories of change 
in these forests will become more critical as wildfire affects more of 
the landscape each year (4, 29, 41). Importantly, by elucidating the 
interactive effects of climate and fire severity, we show that windows 
of opportunity for management intervention may decline as climate 
increasingly limits conifer recruitment in the near-term future.
Methods
Data Collection. Existing datasets were solicited from collaborators across the 
western United States that met several criteria: 1) Plots were located in coni-
fer-dominated forests of the western Unites States; 2) exact plot location and 
area were available; 3) data included presence of postfire conifer juveniles by 
species; 4) sampling occurred at a minimum of 2 y after wildfire (not prescribed 
fire) occurrence; and 5) surveyed wildfires occurred between 1984 and 2018. 
Control plots that were unburned or plots that were planted following fire were 
removed from the aggregated dataset, for a total of 10,230 plots (Dataset S1).
Predictors. Biophysical predictors for each site included a heat load index, fire 
severity, tree cover, and climate data (SI Appendix, Table S1). For consistency, 
we omitted predictors from our analysis that were not present in all datasets 
(e.g., prefire stand structure, serotiny). To represent the effects of insolation 
and topographic shading on seedling recruitment, we used a 90-m continuous 
heat-insolation load index (CHILI; (66)). To represent fire severity, we used a mean 
compositing approach in Google Earth Engine (67) to calculate the relativized 
burn ratio (RBR) with a phenology offset (30-m resolution).
We used two metrics to represent seed source availability. First, to represent 
the overall abundance of live trees (surrounding tree cover), we used the percent 
tree cover in a 300-m radius around each plot derived from postfire imagery 
from the Rangeland Analysis Platform [30-m resolution; (68)]. Second, we used 
distance to nearest live seed source. Data from 78% of plots included field meas-
ured distance to seed source, defined as distance to the nearest live reproductive 
tree(s). For plots without field measured distance to seed source, we manually 
recorded distance to the nearest live tree using 1-m aerial postfire imagery 
(National Agriculture Imagery Program) from the closest available year to the 
field sampling date in Google Earth Engine (SI Appendix, Methods). We did not 
represent the level of P. contorta serotiny in our models, due to a lack of available 
information on serotiny across the study area.
We extracted 4-km resolution daily climate data for 1979 to 2020 for each 
plot from gridMET (69). We developed metrics from these daily climate data 
to represent 30-y climatologies and 5-y postfire seasonal conditions. We used 
monthly averages to run a water balance model following Dobrowski et al. (70) 
and Rodman et al. (22) to calculate monthly climatic water deficit (potential evap-
otranspiration minus actual evapotranspiration) from 1979 to 2020. We then 
calculated 30-y mean annual and growing season (April to September) water 
deficit from 1981 to 2010 to represent average site conditions. We chose water 
deficit because water balance metrics are of direct physiological importance to 
plants (71), and initial analyses showed that water deficit was more strongly 
related to postfire regeneration across multiple species than were precipitation 
or temperature. To represent interannual variability in postfire conditions, we 
calculated z-scores (relative to the 1981 to 2010 mean at each site) for three sea-
sonal metrics: growing season water deficit, June to August vapor pressure deficit, 
and growing season precipitation. Initial comparisons across a broader suite of 
climate variables showed that these variables captured the range of conditions 
while minimizing correlations between variables. To represent the most extreme 
conditions experienced at each site in the first 5 y following fire, when much of 
the regeneration occurs (24, 72), we took the maximum and the minimum of 
these metrics over that time period. Climate extremes are better correlated with 
regeneration than average conditions between 3 and 5 y postfire (22).
Future climate data (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 model 
outputs) were downscaled using the Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs 
method version 2 with the gridMET training dataset (73) for the years 2031 to 
2050 for five global climate models (GCMs; SI Appendix, Table S2). GCMs were 
selected based on model performance in the western United States and represent 
a range of possible future conditions that include a wetter and drier scenario (74, 
75). Water deficit, seasonal, and postfire climate metrics were calculated with data 
from each GCM following the same methods as used for the historic climate data.
To account for effects of known disturbances that occurred within 50 y prior to 
wildfire, prefire disturbance type (none, wildfire, fuel treatment, beetle outbreak, or 
blowdown) was included in models as a categorical predictor (SI Appendix, Methods).

Some plots likely experienced disturbances within 50 y prior to fire that were not 
recorded in our dataset. Thus, prefire disturbance was included in models to account 
for variability in regeneration due to known disturbances, but not to thoroughly 
investigate the effect of compound disturbances on regeneration.
Analyses. We created models of presence/absence of regeneration (at least 
one conifer seedling per plot) by species and for all species combined using 
generalized linear mixed effect models with a binomial distribution and a logit 
link. We modeled P. ponderosa and P. jeffreyi together as it is difficult to distin-
guish between seedlings of the two species. We also modeled A. grandis and A. 
concolor together given the widespread hybridization of the two species from 
central Idaho to south-central Oregon (76). Although P. contorta was the only study 
species that can have serotinous cones, we chose to include it in the model with 
all species because serotiny is highly variable over space, and because the rela-
tionship between distance to seed source and recruitment probability was similar 
between P. contorta and other species. We created models in R version 4.0.4 (77) 
with the glmmTMB package (78). All models included an offset of log(plot size) 
to account for variation in sampling effort. Simulation-based residuals from the 
DHARMa package (79) were used to assess model fit and dispersion.
All models included the following biophysical variables as fixed effects: Time 
since fire, distance to seed source, fire severity, surrounding tree cover, prefire 
disturbance type, and CHILI. Models included climate variables as described 
below. We tested for possible quadratic relationships between the response and 
each variable. For species that have multiple recognized varieties or subspecies, 
we also included a variety term in the model (SI Appendix, Table S5). Each model 
included a random intercept that varied by wildfire identity to account for lack of 
independence between observations within the same wildfire.
We started model selection with a full model that included the above biophysical 
predictors, postfire climate predictors (SI Appendix, Table S1), 30-y mean annual or 
growing season water deficit (depending on species), and interactions between the 
30-y mean climate and the postfire climate metrics to account for differential effects 
of drought across each species range. All predictors included in a single model had 
Pearson’s correlations <0.6 and variance inflation factors <5. We then used 10-fold 
cross validation to iteratively remove interaction terms and climate variables to 
maximize model skill based on cross-validated area under the receiver operating 
characteristics curve (AUC) (SI Appendix, Methods). After model selection for climate 
variables, we checked for interactions between postfire climate variables and fire 
severity and seed availability (RBR, distance to seed source, surrounding tree cover).
To assess changes over time in recruitment probability, we used our mod-
els to predict the mean recruitment probability throughout the study area in 
three 20-y time periods: 1981 to 2000, 2001 to 2020, and 2031 to 2050. We 
made projections for each period under two fire severity scenarios (low sever-
ity: 10 m distance to seed source, 30% surrounding tree cover, 100 RBR; high 
severity: 150 m distance to seed source, 10% surrounding tree cover, 400 RBR; 
SI Appendix, Methods). We held time since fire and plot size constant at 10 y 
and 100 m2, respectively, for all projections. Recruitment probability thus rep-
resents the probability of at least one seedling regenerating in a 0.01-ha plot, 
which is equivalent to a density of 100 trees ha−1. We summarized results of 
recruitment probability by region, which were defined by aggregating level 3 
Environmental Protection Agency ecoregions that contained field sites (Fig. 1A). 
The threshold probability at which recruitment is likely varies between models 
and between approaches to choosing a threshold (80, 81). In figures, we present 
thresholds based on methods that maximize kappa (81) and the sum of specificity 
and sensitivity (80). For Fig. 2C, we show the results based on the threshold that 
maximizes kappa (0.54).

available in the Dryad data repository (https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.0rxwdbs47).
