Comparing methods of reconstructing fire history
using fire scars in a southwestern United States
ponderosa pine forest
Megan L. Van Horne and Peter Z. Fulé
Abstract: Fire scars have been used to understand the historical role of fire in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa
Dougl. ex P. & C. Laws.) ecosystems, but sampling methods and interpretation of results have been criticized for being
statistically invalid and biased and for leading to exaggerated estimates of fire frequency. We compared “targeted” sam-
pling, random sampling, and grid-based sampling to a census of all 1479 fire-scarred trees in a 1 km2 study site in
northern Arizona. Of these trees, 1246 were sufficiently intact to collect cross-sections; of these, 648 had fire scars that
could be cross-dated to the year of occurrence in the 200-year analysis period. Given a sufficient sample size
(approximately n ≥50), we concluded that all tested sampling methods resulted in accurate estimates of the census fire
frequency, with mean fire intervals within 1 year of the census mean. We also assessed three analytical techniques:
(1) fire intervals from individual trees, (2) the interval between the tree origin and the first scar, and (3) proportional
filtering. “Bracketing” fire regime statistics to account for purported uncertainty associated with targeted sampling was
not useful. Quantifying differences in sampling approaches cannot resolve all the limitations of fire-scar methods, but
does strengthen interpretation of these data.
Résumé : Les cicatrices de feu ont été utilisées pour comprendre le rôle que le feu avait jadis dans les écosystèmes de
pin ponderosa (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex P. & C. Laws.) mais les méthodes d’échantillonnage et l’interprétation des
résultats ont été remises en cause et considérées comme invalides du point de vue statistique, biaisées et menant à des
estimations exagérées de la fréquence des feux. Nous avons comparé l’échantillonnage ciblé, l’échantillonnage aléatoire
et l’échantillonnage en grille à un recensement des 1479 arbres portant des cicatrices de feu sur un site de 1 km2 dans
le nord de l’Arizona. De ces arbres, 1246 étaient suffisamment intacts pour prélever des disques parmi lesquels 648
portaient des cicatrices de feu dont l’origine pouvait être datée au cours de la période d’analyse de 200 ans. Étant
donné que la taille de l’échantillon était suffisante (n ≥50 approximativement), nous avons conclu que toutes les mé-
thodes d’échantillonnage testées produisaient des estimations justes de la fréquence des feux recensés avec des interval-
les moyens entre les feux dont l’écart à la moyenne du recensement était inférieure à un an. Nous avons également
évalué trois techniques d’analyses : (1) les intervalles entre les feux à partir d’arbres individuels, (2) l’intervalle entre
l’origine des arbres et la première cicatrice de feu et (3) le filtrage proportionnel. L’utilisation de la méthode
d’encadrement des statistiques de régime de feux pour tenir compte de la prétendue incertitude associée à
l’échantillonnage ciblé n’était pas utile. Le fait de quantifier les différences entre les modes d’échantillonnage ne peut
résoudre toutes les déficiences des méthodes utilisées pour les cicatrices de feu mais renforce l’interprétation de ces
données.

Introduction
Fire scars provide a temporally precise way to reconstruct
fire history, but uncertainties are inherent when estimating
fire frequency and spatial patterning of fires for three main
reasons: (1) fire scars are not consistently recorded on indi-
vidual scarred trees, so they are an incomplete point source
of data (Dieterich and Swetnam 1984), (2) more recent fire
events may have consumed remnant fire records, and (3) error
is introduced by the process of sampling the population of
fire scars (Fall 1998). Few researchers have attempted to
quantify the extent of uncertainty in fire-scar studies, though
most acknowledge that problems exist (e.g., Swetnam and
Baisan 1996; Fall 1998). Baker and Ehle (2001) suggested
“bracketing” mean fire intervals (MFI) with correction factors
to compensate for the perceived uncertainties in 18 previ-
ously published studies in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa
Dougl. ex P. & C. Laws.) forests that reported MFI values of
5–21 years. When their bracketing methods were applied,
Baker and Ehle (2001) calculated the MFI to be 22–308 years.
In contrast, Fall (1998) argued that current methods are
biased in the opposite direction, towards underrepresenting
fire occurrence because many unscarred trees may have
actually burned but failed to scar. To explore several factors

that have been raised as “uncertainties” in reconstructing
ponderosa pine fire history from fire scars, we initiated a
complete census of a study site.
Sampling of fire-scarred trees is often “targeted” toward
trees showing multiple scars and long records of fire to com-
pile a complete inventory of fire years in that area (Arno and
Sneck 1977; McBride 1983; Agee 1993; Swetnam and
Baisan 1996; Fulé et al. 1997, Swetnam and Baisan 2003;
Grissino-Mayer et al. 2004) Targeted samples can be col-
lected from throughout a study area or near systematic grid
points (Arno et al. 1995; Heyerdahl 1997). Targeting has
been criticized for being statistically invalid because it is not
a random sample from a well-defined population, and there-
fore it can lead to estimates of fire frequency where neither
the accuracy nor the precision is known (Johnson and
Gutsell 1994; Baker and Ehle 2003). Swetnam and Baisan
(1996) argued that random sampling would not result in a
complete or unbiased record of fire in frequent surface fire
regimes unless very large numbers of trees were sampled.
They supported the targeting method based on the argument
that trees are a natural archive of historical data and not con-
sistently reliable recorders of fire, so they should not be
treated “as if they all belong to the same statistical popula-
tion” (Swetnam and Baisan 1996, p. 13).
Composite fire intervals are used to capture the complete
record of fire dates in an area. A composite (Dieterich
1980) fire interval analysis typically results in a much
shorter MFI compared with that of an individual tree, or
point fire interval. While Baker and Ehle (2001) suggested
that the composite MFI overestimates fire occurrence and is
not area explicit, the point MFI likely underestimates fire
occurrence because of unrecorded fires. One approach to
resolving this problem is filtering the composite by includ-
ing only fire dates that occur on greater than a determined
percentage of trees (Grissino-Mayer 1995). Ten percent and
25% filtered composites have been used to represent the
fires that are likely to be progressively more widespread
within a study site (Swetnam and Baisan 1996; Baker and
Ehle 2001).
The period between tree germination and the first fire
scar, called the origin-to-scar (OS) interval (Baker 1989), is
another potential source of uncertainty. Baker and Ehle (2001,
2003) argued that for a ponderosa pine tree to survive, it
must have experienced a fire-free interval of at least 50 years,
and therefore this fire-free interval must be included in the
estimate of MFI. Stephens et al. (2003) countered their argu-
ment by maintaining that it is impossible to know the true
fire-free interval because many trees survive fires without
ever scarring. Furthermore, because older fire scars or even
the tree pith may be burned away by subsequent fires, the
OS interval often cannot be measured (Stephens et al. 2003).
Johnson and Gutsell (1994) asserted that the use of time-
since-fire maps to calculate fire rotation (FR, the time
required to burn over an area equal to the study area) is the
only statistically valid method of reconstructing fire events
because it accounts for spatial and temporal variability.
Baker and Ehle (2001) argued that the fire interval should be
interpreted as being equivalent to the FR. An underlying
assumption is that point data (fire-scarred trees) can repre-
sent a particular area burned. If a series of fire scars formed
in the same year indicate that a large area burned, FR may
be relatively short, as would MFI. But if the scarred trees
represent a number of small, localized fires, as argued by
Minnich et al. (2000), and if unscarred trees or those that
had not yet received their first fire scar were considered
evidence of the absence of fire (Baker and Ehle 2001), then
results obtained with the MFI and FR methods would diverge.
The preceding concerns raised in the literature regarding
fire-scar data led us to design a study to census and map an
entire population of fire-scarred ponderosa pine trees. In this
case study we ask the following questions:
(1) Are targeting and other methods of sampling (random,
grid based) accurate when compared with census data?
(2) How do sample size, area sampled, and filtering affect
MFI estimates?
(3) Should OS intervals, “bracketed” intervals, and point
MFIs be included in fire history?
(4) Previous fire ecology studies in this region concluded
that surface fires were frequent and led to recommenda-
tions for thinning and burning for forest restoration. Are
our results consistent with these interpretations?
Methods
Study site
We censused fire-scarred trees on 1 km2 in Northern Ari-
zona University’s Centennial Forest approximately 20 km
southwest
of
Flagstaff,
Arizona
(35°05′ N,
111°50′ W)
(Fig. 1). Given the extraordinary effort required to census
fire scars, this is necessarily a case study. However, the land-
scape features, stand conditions, and land-use history of the
site are representative of much of the ponderosa pine forest
type in Arizona and New Mexico. Located north of the
Mogollon Rim at 2200 m elevation, this site was selected for
its relatively low variation in vegetation and topography and
the lack of natural barriers to fire spread. The soils are
predominately sandy loams and loams (Abella 2005) with
basalt cinders and limestone parent material (Miller et al.
1995). Average annual precipitation in Flagstaff is approxi-
mately 54 cm (1950–2004) with most of the precipitation
falling in late winter and late summer (Western Regional
Climate Center 2004). Ponderosa pine is the dominant spe-
cies with occasional Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt.)
in the understory. Basal area averages 19.1 m2/ha (range 0 to
45.9 m2/ha). Slopes range from 0% to 10%.
Timber extraction began in the site and surrounding areas
during railroad construction in the 1880s, and at about the
same time overgrazing led to widespread exclusion of fire
(Dieterich 1980; Fulé et al. 1997) Sporadic logging activities
and fire suppression continued throughout the 20th century.
The most recent activity in the site was timber harvesting
and burning piles of logging slash in the 1980s and 1990s.
Field methods
The targeted sample was collected first. We systematically
walked through the site examining each fire-scarred tree we
encountered for number of visible scars and soundness. Forty
trees with multiple scars and long records of fire, distributed
throughout the sampling unit, were selected to compose the
targeted sample. After completing the targeted sample
collection, a grid consisting of twenty-five 4 ha cells was
overlaid on the 100 ha study site. The grid was flagged to

delineate boundaries for organized collection and analysis of
the census. The entire population of trees with visible fire-
scar evidence constituted the census. Cross-sections from all
remaining fire-scarred trees (those not collected in the tar-
geted sample) were collected in the census. Several speci-
mens were too deteriorated to collect, so the fire-scarred tree
was documented and mapped.
We recognized that buried scars may have existed on the
site, but we did not deliberately sample into intact living
trees for them. However, virtually all the pre 20th century
trees sampled were old cut stumps, so in some cases scars
that would not have been visible in a standing tree were evi-
dent on the stump. Scarred trees included living trees, snags,
logs, and stumps. We collected partial cross-sections from
live and standing dead trees, a standard technique that can be
done without killing live trees (Arno and Sneck 1977;
Heyerdahl and McKay 2001). A 5 cm thick cross-section
was extracted from the region of the tree that appeared to
have the most complete fire record using a chainsaw. Com-
plete cross-sections were cut from stumps and logs. In cases
where multiple sides or heights on the fire-scarred tree
appeared to have recorded different fires, multiple cross-
sections from that tree were extracted. The only living trees
with fire scars were young trees clustered around burned
slash piles, and they appeared to be scarred recently. Because
we were primarily interested in the fire regime before Euro-
American settlement, we only collected samples from about
70% of these living trees to verify that the fire date was out-
side our time frame of analysis. However, all these trees
were measured and mapped in the field.
Each fire-scarred tree was documented by recording diam-
eter at stump height, number of cross-sections taken, number
of pieces per cross-section, number of visible scars on the
specimen, aspect of the fire-scarred area(s) on the tree, height
of the cross-sections on the bole, and Universal Transverse
Mercator (UTM) coordinates from a Garmin® GPS, accurate
to within 15 m. The condition of the tree was also recorded
as living, snag, stump, or log.

Laboratory methods
All specimens were mounted on plywood and surfaced
using an electric belt sander with increasingly finer sandpa-
per until the cells were clearly visible under magnification.
We used a ring-width chronology from the Gus Pearson
Natural Area, Arizona (Graybill 1987), supplemented with
20 increment cores from old trees on the site, to build a mas-
ter ring-width chronology specific to the study site. All spec-
imens were visually cross-dated when possible, using visual
recognition of tree-ring patterns supported by skeleton plot-
ted chronologies and lists of marker years (those with nar-
row rings) (Stokes and Smiley 1968). COFECHA software
(Holmes 1983) was used to assist with dating difficult speci-
mens. The rings on the difficult specimens were measured
with an Acu-Rite glass scale and encoder with 2 µm preci-
sion and Measure J2X software. Dating suggested by
COFECHA outputs was checked carefully against the origi-
nal cross-sections to verify the dating visually, rather than
relying solely on correlation coefficients. Many specimens
remained undated even after COFECHA was employed. If a
specimen had an injury that could not be unquestionably
identified as a fire scar, we did not include the date of that
injury. If a fire scar could not be dated to an exact year, we
did not include the estimated year. Specimens that contained
no fire scars or had fire scars where the exact year could not
be determined were not cross-dated.
All the targeted specimens and 40% of the entire collec-
tion were checked by other dendrochronologists to inde-
pendently verify the dates of the wood specimen and fire
events.
Any
unresolved
discrepancies
were
considered
undateable. We also identified the years in which each tree
with dateable fire scars was recording. A tree is considered
to be “recording” after the initial injury because the wounded
area is susceptible to being rescarred by subsequent fires
(Grissino-Mayer 1995).
Data analysis
Each individual fire-scarred tree will be called a specimen
(even if more than one cross-section was collected from that
tree), and each group of specimens analyzed will be a
sample. FHX2 software (Grissino-Mayer 1995) was used to
analyze combinations of fire-history data from specimens.
The 200-year period from 1682 to 1881 was used in all anal-
yses for consistency unless otherwise stated. The minimum
number of trees recording in this period was 39 trees in
1881, a sufficient number of trees with which to conduct this
analysis (Falk and Swetnam 2003). The year 1881 is the last
year of analysis because it was the last fire year in the study
area before grazing and fire suppression interrupted the natu-
ral fire regime. Prior to the late 1600s, the results would be
confounded by the lack of fire scar data. The year 1682 was
chosen to make an even 200-year period of analysis.
We chose the mean fire interval (MFI) as the basic statis-
tic for analysis in this study, following the example of Baker
and Ehle (2001), who noted that this statistic was the only
one consistently reported throughout the literature and there-
fore was the best value for cross-study comparisons. This is
not intended to imply that MFI is necessarily the most useful
measure of central tendency (e.g., see Grissino-Mayer 1999;
Falk and Swetnam 2003). For each sample, the MFI for all
scars (no filter) and for the 10% and 25% scarred filters was
computed in FHX2 (Dieterich 1980; Swetnam and Baisan
1996) Filters only include those 5 years that are recorded by
the determined minimum percentage of recording trees and
can be used to infer fire size; no filter includes fires of all
sizes, whereas a 25% filter only includes the larger fires.
These samples are subsets of the census data, so the same
specimens may be included in multiple samples. Because of
lack of independence and spatial autocorrelation, we did not
test for statistically significant differences of the means.
Instead, graphical and tabular representations of the means
are used to show the effect of sampling methods.
A GIS was used to map the locations of the samples by
the UTM coordinates recorded in the field to assist with the
spatial interpretations. The original UTM coordinates were
used except where the trees falsely appeared to be out of the
study area because of GPS error. UTM coordinates of these
trees were moved to the site boundary nearest to the original
location.
Comparison of sampling methods
The analyses outlined above were applied to the following
samples:
(1) Census — The census provided a baseline to test the
effect of all other sampling methods. The census fire
history was assembled using all scars and represented
the most complete possible fire-scar-based fire history
of the site.
(2) Targeted sample — The targeted sample was analogous
to other fire-history studies in the region. The targeted
sample consisted of 40 specimens with multiple scars
and long records of fire.
(3) Sample size (random samples) — Random samples were
used to test the effect of increasing sample size. Eight
sample sizes were tested: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and
80 specimens. For each sample size analysis, all cross-
dated specimens with fires were randomly sampled without
replacement from the complete data set using a random
number algorithm. Sampling with replacement occurred
at the scale of the separate samples, but not within a
single sample. For each sample size, the MFIs for 10
random samples were averaged. For samples with ≥40
specimens, we calculated the range and standard devia-
tion of the fire intervals.
(4) Area sampled — The study area was spatially subdi-
vided into 25 grid cells of equal size (200 m × 200 m).
This analysis considered six areas of different sizes to
test the effect of increasing the size of the study area on
MFI. The areas tested were 4 ha (1 cell), 8 ha (2 cells),
16 ha (4 cells), 32 ha (8 cells), 64 ha (16 cells), and 100
ha (25 cells). All dated specimens were included in this
analysis. The 100 ha sample is equivalent to the census.
The MFI for each area was calculated as an average of
the MFIs for each combination of that size. That is,
there are four combinations of 16 adjacent cells arranged
in a square. Those four combinations were averaged to
get the 16-cell MFI; however, the MFI for each of the
four combinations is shown graphically.
(5) Grid-based samples — We compared two alternative
systematic grid-based sampling approaches. Grid 1 had
a spacing of 141 m arranged diagonally over the study
area, yielding 41 plots (see Fig. 2a). The spacing of

these plots was determined by the original 25-cell grid,
locating one plot in the middle of each cell and one plot
at the corner of four adjacent cells. Each sample included
one to four specimens with the highest number of
observed scars in the field from within three search
radii, 20, 40, and 60 m. The samples consisted of differ-
ent numbers of specimens per plot to approximately
mimic the size of the targeted sample (n = 40). Within
the 40 m radius, two different samples were assessed:
(i) one specimen per plot, and (ii) two specimens per
plot. Grid 2 is a checkerboard with one hundred 1 ha
blocks (see Fig. 2b). MFIs were calculated using the
specimen with the highest number of observed scars in
the field, as recorded at the time of specimen collection,
from each of the 50 white cells, then from each of the
50 black cells.
Point MFIs and origin-to-first-scar intervals
Point MFIs were calculated for each specimen in the census,
then plotted for comparison with the census composites with
the three levels of filtering. The OS interval distribution of
all 154 specimens with piths was analyzed, and the propor-
tion of OS intervals less than 50 years was reported (Baker
and Ehle 2001). We also determined the OS interval for the
47 specimens having piths within the 200-year period of
analysis and OS intervals less than the point MFI. We mapped
these 47 specimens and assessed whether the OS intervals
were truly fire-free, based on the fire dates of their nearest
recording neighbors.
Results
Collection summary
A total of 1479 fire-scarred trees were documented and
mapped (Fig. 3), and sections were collected from 1246
(84%) of these trees. Of the 233 (16%) trees from which
specimens were not collected, 189 (13%) had a high level of
decay preventing us from collecting a viable specimen.
Specimens were not collected from the remaining 44 (3%)
because they were young (<100 years) living trees with one
scar and were clustered with other living recently single-
scarred trees that we sampled. The following percentages
were computed based on the 1246 collected specimens. We
were able to cross-date 777 (62%) specimens and identify
their fire dates, 67 (5%) of which were from live trees. Of
the 459 specimens (37%) that were collected but not cross-
dated, 303 (24%) contained an injury that was not necessar-
ily a fire scar. The remaining 156 (13%) had clearly visible
fire scars, but we failed to cross-date them because of decay
and short or complacent ring series. Ten (0.8%) of the col-
lected specimens went missing, either in the transfer from
the field or during woodshop operations. Six hundred and
forty-eight (52%) of the collected specimens had cross-dated
fire scars within the period of analysis (1682–1881) and
were used in the analysis described below.
During the period of analysis the percentage of recording
trees varied between 16% and nearly 100% of the total sample
depth (Fig. 4). The total number of trees sampled peaked
between 1725 and 1750, whereas the sample depth (number
of recording specimens) was greatest between 1800 and 1820.
Both the total number of trees sampled and sample depth
declined sharply near the end of the period of analysis. The
fires that scarred more than 25% of the recording trees were
clustered together in time. Larger fires and few small fires
occurred between 1784 and 1813, with longer fire intervals

occurring between 1784–1788 and 1788–1794. Conversely,
fires scarring fewer trees occurred almost annually from 1831
to 1850, but few large fires were recorded during this pe-
riod. A notable lack of fires was recorded between 1873 and
1881.
Sampling method
Composite MFIs of all the sampling methods were within
2.18 years of each other and within 2.75 years of the census
(Table 1).
Census and targeted sample
The census with no filter represented the maximum possi-
ble number of fire dates, so the census MFI was the shortest
computed in this study. The targeted sample was slightly
longer than the census with no filter and a 10% filter, but
slightly shorter than the census with a 25% filter (Table 1).
The targeted sample captured the specimen with the most
scars in the whole study and included many more highly
scarred specimens than the other samples. The standard
deviation (SD) of the census with no filter was 0.7 years
with fire intervals ranging from 1 to 4 years. The targeted
sample SD was 1.1 years with fire intervals from 1 to 6 years.
Sample size (random samples) and area sampled
Mean MFI decreased towards an asymptote as the sample
size increased for no filter and a 10% filter, while the mean
MFI filtered at 25% remained fairly constant (Fig. 5a). The

variability within each set of 10 runs of each unique combi-
nation of sample size and filter level increased as the filter
level increased. These trends were similar for area sampled
(Fig. 5b). The 25% filtered means of MFI were very similar
between small and large areas sampled. The MFIs decreased
as area sampled increased for the less restrictive filters. Within
the different samples of the same-sized area, variability was
highest in the 25% filter MFIs and lower for the less restric-
tive filters.
As the sample size increased, the variability of fire inter-
vals within a single sample decreased. SD of fire intervals in
the random data sets of at least 40 trees with no filter ranged
from 1.1 to 1.87 years. The maximum fire intervals in the
same data sets ranged from 7 to 12 years. The minimum fire
interval for these data sets was 1 year. Variability of SD and
ranges of fire intervals increased with more restrictive filters.
Grid-based samples
In the samples based on grid 1, the longest MFIs resulted
from the 20 and 40 m search radii, where the sample size
was about 30 trees. The other two samples, one with a larger
search radii and both with bigger sample sizes, resulted in
shorter MFIs. The MFIs from the black or white cells in grid
2 were similar (Table 1).
Point and origin-to-first-scar intervals
The census composite MFIs with filters varied between
1.66 and 6 years. The variability of point MFIs was much
greater, with a mean of 12 years and range from 2 to 133 years
(Fig. 6). The targeted point MFI was 1.2 times shorter than
the point MFI from the census data.
The average OS interval was 101.5 years. The frequency
in the shorter intervals of the OS distribution increased until
the 61–80 interval class, then declined (Fig. 7). Thirty-six
percent of all specimens with pith scarred before age 70;
19.5% of specimens with pith scarred before age 50. The
distance from a tree with an OS interval to its nearest neigh-
bor scarred within the tree’s OS interval ranged from 1 to 72
m, averaging 25 m. Of the fire-scarred neighbors, 87% were
the closest recording neighbor to the tree in question. Many
trees that scarred later in their lives remained unscarred
during the most extensive fire years, including 1737 and
1794 (Fig. 8).
Discussion
Are targeting and other methods of sampling (random,
grid based) accurate?
To answer this question, we needed to establish criteria to
assess how well the sample MFIs represented the census
MFI. We considered three different levels at which to deter-
mine similarity. The most restrictive criterion would be a
95% confidence interval (CI) of the census fire intervals.
Because the range of fire intervals was only 1 to 4 years in
the census, the 95% CI is very small, 0.13 years (= 47 days),
so the threshold for similarity would be 1.79 years. This
narrow threshold, met by none of the sampling methods, is
not reasonable in terms of fire-scar formation and ecological
or management considerations, as discussed below. A
threshold at the other extreme would include MFIs less than
25 years, the maximum interval considered to represent a
frequent fire regime (Pyne et al. 1996). This assessment
would lead to the conclusion that all methods of sampling

are adequate representations of the fire frequency, but the
25-year window is excessively broad for analysis of either
ecological relationships or management practices. Between
these extremes, we established the following reliability stan-
dard: all MFIs within 1 year of the census MFI are similar
enough to represent the true fire frequency. One year is a
reasonable threshold because it approximates the minimum
temporal resolution (annual) at which fire-history data are
recorded. If a different threshold is required for some analy-
sis, the data in Table 1 can be compared against whatever
criterion is deemed appropriate.
When the 1-year criterion is used, the threshold for sam-
ples is 2.66 years. Samples with MFIs that are similar to that
of the census under the 1-year criterion include the targeted
sample, random samples of at least 50 specimens, areas of at
least 16 ha, and grid-based samples with at least 35 speci-

mens. Accepting that a 1-year threshold is adequate, we con-
clude that all sampling methods tested in this study, given a
sufficient sample size, will result in an accurate estimate of
the true fire frequency.
How do sample size, area sampled, and filtering affect
MFI estimates?
There is a threshold at which little new information is
gained with additional specimens, as shown in this study
(approximately 50 randomly sampled specimens) and else-
where (Falk and Swetnam 2003; Stephens et al. 2003). How-
ever, smaller samples of targeted or grid-based specimens
had similar results because we selected the specimens with
the most fire dates in those samples. Swetnam and Baisan
(1996) were correct that in a frequent surface fire regime,
random sampling requires a larger sample size than targeted
sampling to accumulate the same amount of fire-history data.
Sample size and area sampled are linked. The sample
sizes in the 4 and 8 ha areas fell below the 50 specimen
threshold, so the fact that MFIs in the 4 and 8 ha samples,
3.49 and 2.79 years, respectively, were longer than MFIs of
larger areas may be a product of the small sample size, not
necessarily a factor of area sampled. The same relationship
was present in the 20 and 40 m samples, n = 29 and 31,
respectively, based on grid 1. Even though there appeared to
be an inverse relationship between search radius and MFI,
the fact that MFIs in the 20 and 40 m samples, 3.52 and
3.13 years, respectively, were longer than MFIs for greater
search radii may also be a function of sample size, not nec-
essarily search radius.
The MFIs with a 25% filter were remarkably consistent as
sample size or area sampled increased. This means that the
large fires were captured with fewer specimens in a smaller
area, but smaller fires continued to be discovered with more
samples over a larger area. Therefore, if there were concern
that fire-scar methods give undue weight towards small fires
(Minnich et al. 2000; Baker and Ehle 2001), the use of the
25% filter should provide a stable basis for comparison even
if the MFI calculated with all fires tends to vary with sample
size and area.
Variability, for example, ranges and standard deviations of
fire intervals, was not the focus of this study but it may have
important ecological implications. The range (1 to 12 years)
and SD (1.1 to 1.87 years) of fire intervals in random data
sets of at least 40 specimens suggest that fire recurrence
fluctuated from annual burning to fire-free gaps at decadal
scales. Ecologically, this mosaic of fire frequencies allows
for shifting patterns of understory vegetation, tree regenera-
tion, and perhaps changes across a variety of trophic levels
(e.g., Provencher et al. 2003). Large-scale climatic tele-
connections have been suggested as a possible cause for a
pattern of shifts in fire frequency and synchrony noted in
Mexico (Stephens et al. 2003), Colorado, USA, and Patagonia,
Argentina (Veblen and Kitzberger 2002), and elsewhere in
North America (Swetnam and Betancourt 1990; Grissino-
Mayer 1995; Grissino-Mayer and Swetnam 2000; Swetnam
and Baisan 2003). We found a period of large synchronous
fires between 1784 and 1813 and very frequent fires from
1831 to 1850, similar to the frequent fires that occurred from
1850 to 1865 at Chimney Spring (Dieterich 1980).

Fig. 8. Trees with origin-to-first-scar (OS) intervals occurred in
close proximity to scarred trees during two major fire years,
1737 and 1794. OS trees are only mapped here if the OS inter-
val overlaps the fire year shown.

Should OS intervals, “bracketed” intervals, and point
MFIs be included in fire history?
Two arguments were made in the literature that attempted
to explain why most trees are older than 50 when they scar
for the first time: (1) fires killed the young trees instead of
scarring them, leaving no lasting evidence of the fire’s pres-
ence, and (2) fire was absent around the seedling during its
establishment (Baker 1989; Gutsell and Johnson 1996;
Keeley and Stephenson 2000; Baker and Ehle 2001). While
these are both logical explanations, a third possible conclu-
sion missing from this list is that fire was present, but failed
to leave a scar. The maps of widespread fire years (Fig. 8)
show that it is highly likely that most trees experienced more
than one fire without scarring, especially because some
scarred trees are only 1 m away from a tree during its
unscarred OS interval. The distribution of OS intervals for
the Centennial Forest was similar to the distribution of OS
intervals found for ponderosa pine growing in more north-
erly portions of the Rockies, except that measures of central
tendency there were approximately 20 years longer (Baker
and Ehle 2001).
The pith of a tree is not a surrogate for fire occurrence,
especially in frequent fire regimes where postfire regenera-
tion does not typically occur in even-aged cohorts (Mast et
al. 1999). Baker (1989) noted that assuming that the OS
interval is the same as a fire interval would be incorrect,
though Baker and Ehle (2001, p. 1212) claimed that omitting
the OS interval is an “error…since it estimates a real fire
interval…” Furthermore, the OS interval is calculated to the
first detectable fire scar; overestimation of the OS interval is
likely considering the possibility of the first scar being burned
away, broken, or decayed over time. In sum, while it is true
that the OS period on any given tree could potentially
represent a fire-free period, there is clear evidence of burning
adjacent to yet-unscarred trees in our results. Coupled with
the fact that there is no inherent link between a fire date and
pith date, we suggest that the addition of OS intervals into
the mathematical calculation of MFI, as proposed in the
bracketing method of Baker and Ehle (2001), does not have
a sound basis.
The point MFI, in contrast, is an interval between recorded
fires (though scars can be burned away or decay, like all fire
scars). They may be a useful metric of the maximum fire
interval at the scale of individual trees, which recorded fires,
on average, every 12 years in this study. This is longer than
all the composite MFIs regardless of sampling method, yet
still indicative of a frequent fire regime (<25 years). Unlike
a composite of fire years, the point MFI is sensitive to the
quality (number of fires) per specimen. Targeted sampling
yields higher quality samples that may overestimate the
point MFI and may not be appropriate for quantifying the
maximum fire interval. In this study, the targeted point MFI
was overestimated by a factor of 1.2 (<2 years). Although
this was a small difference, if the point MFI is used to repre-
sent the maximum fire interval in other studies, perhaps a
random sample of fire-scarred remnants should be used to
quantify this interval.
The bracketing methods proposed by Baker and Ehle (2001)
are an amalgam of useful quantitative techniques, such as
filtering and point fire intervals, mixed together with the OS
interval (not a fire interval) and arbitrary assertions about
accuracy. For example, Baker and Ehle (2001) argued that
“targeting likely decreases the mean composite FI by a factor
of two to three times”, a guess that was not supported in our
data (target MFI = 2.33 years, census MFI = 1.66 years).
Quantitative values and arbitrary estimates were lumped to-
gether by Baker and Ehle (2001) to arrive at bracketed MFI
estimates of 22–308 years. Instead of following this approach,
we suggest that fire-scar data be interpreted only with quan-
titative fire-interval data, including the unfiltered and fil-
tered composite and point MFI values, together with
descriptive statistics of variability.
How does this study relate to other fire-history studies
in the region and the management of these forests?
The previously published fire-history studies from the
region of our study site also reported high fire frequency
before Euro-American settlement. Dieterich (1980) reported
MFIs of 2.4 years at Chimney Spring and 1.8 years at Lime-
stone Flat; sites on the San Francisco Peaks had an MFI of
5.2 years (Heinlein 1996); Fulé et al. (1997) reported a
3.7 year MFI for Camp Navajo (Fig. 1). These studies also
reported similar dates for the cessation of the frequent fire
regime, from 1876 at Chimney Springs (Dieterich 1980) to
1883 at Camp Navajo (Fulé et al. 1997). All the northern
Arizona studies fall within the range of results reported
across the southwestern United States by Swetnam and Baisan
(1996). Modern calibration studies (Farris et al. 2003; Fulé
et al. 2003, Stephens et al. 2003) indicate that fire-scar data
are consistent with independent fire records in reconstructing
fire occurrence. Other lines of evidence from evolutionary
ecology (Moore et al. 1999) and historical documentation
(Cooper 1960) support the interpretations of ponderosa pine
fire regimes in the southwestern United States obtained from
numerous studies based on fire-scar analyses.
Our data are limited to a single case study of 1 km2,
though it is worth noting that the 648 cross-dated specimens
are equivalent to more than half of the total of 1215 speci-
mens at all 63 southwestern study sites reported by Swetnam
and Baisan (1996). Because fire-scarred trees provide point
estimates of fire occurrence, our sampling cannot resolve the
uncertainty of burning between these points nor the interpre-
tation of fire occurrence around never-scarred or yet-
unscarred (OS) trees. However, we were able to completely
resolve the concerns that targeting and other sampling methods
may have an unknown effect on estimates of fire frequency
at this study site. All methods of sampling compared in this
study are accurate given a sufficient sample size: any 50
specimens would yield a fair estimate of the fire frequency.
Targeting requires the smallest sample size, yields the same
results as other sampling methods, and is likely to result in
longer reliable records of fire.
In recent years, wildfires in the southwestern United Sates
have dramatically increased in size and severity, resulting in
undesirable ecological effects (Agee 1993; Kolb et al. 1994;
Swetnam et al. 1999) and increased costs of suppression and
rehabilitation (National Fire Plan 2004; GAO 2004). Recent
legislation has encouraged thinning and prescribed burning
(Healthy Forest Restoration Act 2003). Because manage-
ment recommendations are based partially on historic forest
conditions and fire frequencies, it is important to have infor-
mation collected in such a way that accurately represents the

true historic conditions, though even given perfect knowl-
edge of the historic fire regime, it is unlikely that managers
would implement equally frequent, widespread fires because
of other constraints.
As long as managers recognize that fire-scar-based fire
histories represent patterns of fires that burned in variable
spatial and temporal patterns, with a mosaic of burn severities,
including unburned areas within the fire perimeter, there is
no evidence from our study site to support Baker and Ehle’s
(2003, p. 329) contention that “traditional measures [of fire
history] are misleading or in error as sources of [restoration]
information”. In fact, targeting and every other sampling
approach with ≥50 specimens were essentially indistinguish-
able from census data and even low sample sizes or small
areas sampled were quite stable when data were filtered to
the 25% scarred level. The high consistency achieved among
sampling methods and the consistency between our data and
southwestern ponderosa pine fire histories in general are
strong evidence against the contention that repeated manage-
ment burning “lacks a sound basis in science” (Baker and
Ehle 2003, p. 330), at least in southwestern ponderosa for-
ests and perhaps more broadly in the range of ponderosa and
related pines.
