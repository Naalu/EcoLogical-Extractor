Mortality and crown dieback of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) were extensive on the Williams Ran-
ger District, Kaibab National Forest in northern Arizona. We collected data from a random sample of 48
aspen sites to determine the relationship of predisposing site and stand factors and contributing agents to
ramet mortality. Mortality of overstory (P10.1 cm DBH) aspen stems averaged 50% (44% by basal area).
Pine–oak type aspen stands suffered greater basal area mortality (57%) than stands in mixed conifer type
(38%). An average of 48% of live overstory aspen stems had >33% crown dieback, and mortality signiﬁ-
cantly increased with increasing crown dieback. Based upon univariate relationships, elevation was the
most signiﬁcant site factor and relative conifer basal area was the most signiﬁcant stand factor related
to overstory mortality. Canker diseases and wood-boring insects were signiﬁcantly related to overstory
mortality. Sapling (P5.1–10.1 cm DBH) and tall regeneration (<5.1 cm DBH) aspen mortality were high
(>80% and 70%, respectively), while short regeneration (<1.37 m tall) mortality was low (16%). Many sites
did not have live aspen sapling or tall regeneration stems; therefore, relationships were often inconclu-
sive or weak. Based on a null size–density model, there was a lack of tall regeneration, sapling, and 10.1–
15 cm DBH overstory aspen recruitment. Multiple regression was used to explore multivariate relation-
ships among aspen mortality and site, stand, and damaging agent factors. Forest type, relative conifer
basal area, and incidence of canker diseases and wood-boring insects were signiﬁcantly associated with
overstory mortality. Slope, relative conifer density, and incidence of animal damages were signiﬁcantly
associated with short regeneration mortality. Ungulate damages to aspen stems were common across
all size classes, but signiﬁcant relationships were limited to short regeneration mortality. The Southwest
is forecasted to transition to a more arid climate, and aspen in pine–oak sites are already experiencing a
population crash. If high mortality and low recruitment continues, conifer will replace aspen stands after
overstory aspen stems die.

1. Introduction
Mortality of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) has rapidly in-
creased over the past 15 years in parts of western North America
(Fairweather et al., 2008; Hogg et al., 2008; Worrall et al., 2008).
In many western landscapes, aspen is the principal upland decidu-
ous tree species and is biologically and economically important be-
cause it provides disproportionally high amounts of critical plant
and animal habitat and esthetics (White et al., 1998; Romme
et al., 2001; McCool, 2001). Therefore, the loss of aspen is a loss
of biodiversity and landscape diversity and has the potential to
negatively impact local economies.
As a concept, the loss of aspen trees and stands over time suffers
from loose usage of terminology. Forest scientists use the term
‘‘aspen decline’’ to describe reduction in aspen forest type on a
broad range of temporal and spatial scales, driven mostly by suc-
cessional processes under altered disturbance regimes (Bartos
and Campbell, 1998; Kulakowski et al., 2004; Di Orio et al.,
2005). Worrall et al. (2008) coined the term ‘‘sudden aspen de-
cline’’ (SAD) to distinguish the rapid and synchronous mortality
of aspen on a landscape-scale in Colorado from the slower succes-
sional processes described by Bartos and Campbell (1998) and oth-
ers. Similar discrete episodes of heavy aspen mortality have been
reported in parts of Arizona, Utah, and the prairie provinces of
Canada (Gitlin et al., 2006; Guyon, 2006; Fairweather et al.,
2008; Hogg et al., 2008).
The conceptual framework of a decline disease is a useful way
to categorize the causes of large-scale episodes of abrupt aspen
mortality (Frey et al., 2004). Forest pathologists deﬁne a tree de-
cline disease as rapid mortality of a tree species due to a complex
of predisposing, inciting, and contributing factors (Manion, 1991;
Manion and LaChance, 1992). Predisposing factors are long-term,
slowly changing factors (e.g., site and stand conditions). Inciting
factors are short-term factors that cause acute stress (e.g., episodic
drought). Contributing factors are mostly biological agents (e.g.,
fungi and insects) that kill trees already weakened by predisposing
and inciting factors (Worrall et al., 2008). Trees affected by any one

type of factor do not suffer from a decline disease; a decline disease
is characterized by the interacting effect of many factors. This is
why the decline disease concept is not an appropriate frame for
long-term, successional aspen decline. In the case of aspen decline
disease (abrupt, heavy aspen mortality consistent with a tree de-
cline disease), previous workers across western North America
have already identiﬁed many of the probable predisposing, incit-
ing, and contributing factors (see Frey et al., 2004; Kashian et al.,
2007; Fairweather et al., 2008; Hogg et al., 2008; Worrall et al.,
2008, 2010; Rehfeldt et al., 2009; St. Clair et al., 2010; Marchetti
et al., 2011).
Arizona and northern Mexico contain the southwestern edge of
contiguous aspen habitat in North America (Burns and Honkala,
1990), and, as a result, aspen stands at this edge often grow on war-
mer and drier sites than stands in the more northerly parts of its
geographical range. The northern and central regions of Arizona
have experienced recent aspen crown dieback, defoliation, and
mortality over thousands of hectares (Gitlin et al., 2006; Fairweath-
er et al., 2008). The extent of aspen dieback and/or defoliation in
Arizona detected by Forest Health Protection (FHP) aerial survey in-
creased from 27,100 ha in 2006 to 49,800 ha in 2008 (USDA For-
est Service, 2007, 2008, and 2009). Of the dieback and/or defoliation
detected in 2008, 53% occurred on the Kaibab National Forest.
Fine-scale (site-level) aspen mortality information has been
gathered in parts of Arizona. Gitlin et al. (2006) examined local
and regional patterns of drought-associated mortality near Flag-
staff, AZ and found that average mortality of aspen by site varied
from 7–24%, with an average of 18% at lower elevation sites and
9% at higher elevation sites. On the Coconino National Forest in
northern Arizona, Fairweather et al. (2008) reported a cumulative
mortality level of 55% between 2000 and 2007, with 95% mortality
in low-elevation xeric sites (<2300 m), 61% mortality in mid-eleva-
tion sites (2300–2600 m), and 16% mortality in high-elevation me-
sic sites (>2300 m). On the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest in
eastern Arizona, cumulative mortality was 46% between 2001
and 2006 (M. Fairweather, USFS FHP, May 2011, unpublished
observation). All studies noted an accelerated rate of mortality fol-
lowing a frost event in June 1999 and severe drought and high
temperatures during the growing season in 2002. Additionally,
canker diseases and wood-boring and defoliating insects contrib-
uted to the mortality of already stressed aspen (Fairweather
et al., 2008), while wild ungulate browsing severely limited aspen
sucker height growth (Bailey and Whitham, 2002; Fairweather
et al., 2008). Although some site-level information about aspen
mortality has been collected in Arizona, the relationships among
aspen mortality to speciﬁc biotic and abiotic factors (damaging
agents) at the southwestern fringe of contiguous aspen habitat
are still largely speculative. Furthermore, site-level information
for the Kaibab National Forest (west of both the Coconino and
Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests) is practically unknown.
To investigate the extent and characteristics of aspen mortality
on a landscape located near the southwestern edge of its contigu-
ous range, we quantiﬁed the current condition of aspen stands on
the south zone of the Kaibab National Forest. Our objectives were
to: (i) determine the current structure, composition, and mortality
and crown dieback levels of aspen stands; and (ii) examine how
predisposing site and stand factors and contributing agents relate
to aspen mortality.
2. Methods
2.1. Study area
The study area was the Williams Ranger District of the Kaibab
National Forest in northern Arizona (Fig. 1), located near the cities
of Williams and Flagstaff. Aspen stands are distributed over
382,400 ha, but occupy only <1% of that area (970 ha in 330
loosely deﬁned stands). The majority of stands are discontinuous
and small (0.1–25 ha) and occur at lower elevations (<2400 m).
Larger stands tend to occur on north-facing slopes at higher eleva-
tions (>2400 m) on Bill Williams, Kendrick, and Sitgreaves Moun-
tains. Aspen stands are intermingled with Gambel oak (Quercus
gambelii) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) at lower elevations,
and white pine (Pinus strobiformis or Pinus ﬂexilis var. reﬂexa),
Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca), white ﬁr (Abies con-
color var. concolor), and corkbark ﬁr (Abies lasiocarpa var. arizonica)
at higher elevations. Pure aspen stands are rare, and the Kaibab
National Forest has not formally deﬁned aspen-dominated forest
types (e.g., aspen forests in parts of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming).
Therefore, the two dominant forest types that contain aspen are
low-elevation pine–oak and high-elevation mixed conifer.
The Williams Ranger District is browsed and grazed by domes-
tic cattle and sheep (Family: Bovidae) and wild deer and elk
(Family: Cervidae). Domestic ungulate use is managed by a permit
system, with contract speciﬁcations on location, number of ani-
mals, and duration of use. Wild ungulate grazing is unregulated;
deer and elk graze the study area year-round, except when they
move to lower elevations to escape deep snow.
2.2. Site selection
We used stratiﬁed random sampling proportional to aspen’s
distribution to select a subset of aspen sites across the Williams
Ranger District. Based upon a digital elevation model and a map
of the distribution of aspen stands (provided by Williams Ranger
District personnel), we stratiﬁed aspen stands by two elevation
(62400 m;>2400 m), two slope (628%;>28%), and ﬁve aspect (ﬂat,
north, east, south, and west) classes. These classes were then com-
bined into 20 unique strata and we selected a random sample of
201 potential sampling points (site centers) based upon the pro-
portion of each stratum to the total population (ArcGIS, Sampling
tool). Therefore, common strata received more potential sampling
points but a diverse range of stands were selected for sampling.
Of the 201 potential sampling points, we sampled 48 sites and
rejected 153 sites for the following reasons: (i)<10 standing live
or dead aspen stems (n = 66); (ii)<200 m from a previously in-
stalled site (n = 36); (iii)>4 h hike (n = 24); (iv) within a ﬁre closed
area (n = 15); (v) within an ungulate exclosure (n = 10); or (vi) high
human impact (n = 2). We decided to sample areas open to ungu-
late browsers because an analysis of exclosed versus unexclosed
sites was beyond the scope of this study.
2.3. Plot design and data collection
We used a nested plot design adapted from Brown et al. (2006)
to collect detailed site, stand, and damaging agent data. At each site
to be sampled, we established four 8 m radius overstory plots
(0.02 ha) at cardinal directions 20 m from the site center. Within
each of the 8 m subplots, one 4 m radius nested regeneration plot
(0.005 ha) was installed. The site was the sampling unit; all data
from the 8 and 4 m plots were combined and converted to a per-
hectare basis (Brown et al., 2006).
Site center was permanently marked with rebar, tagged, and
geo-referenced with a global positioning system. Elevation, percent
slope, aspect, and forest type were recorded at site center. Sites
were assigned as pine–oak if aspen were present with only Gambel
oak and/or ponderosa pine, and as mixed conifer if aspen were
present with only two or more conifer species.
Stems P10.1 cm in diameter measured at 1.37 m above ground
(diameter at breast height, DBH) were deﬁned as ‘‘overstory’’. Tree

197

variables were collected for overstory stems. Condition class cate-
gories for all tree species were live and standing dead. Stems with
any amount of green foliage or live cambial tissue were ‘‘live’’ even
though death may have been imminent. Percent crown dieback
was estimated only for live aspen. We estimated based upon the
percentage of dead branches in the tree crown in three classes:
light (0–33%), moderate (34–66%), and heavy (67–100%). Incidence
of disease, insect, and abiotic and animal damages (Ostry et al.,
1989) were collected for all live and dead aspen with bark present.
Damaging agents were identiﬁed by signs and symptoms. Recently
dead stems were included because the signals of many damaging
agents cited in previous research to be ‘‘important’’ are detectable
even with minimal bark (Ostry et al., 1989). A maximum of three
present and harmful damaging agents per stem were recorded
(Steed and Kearns, 2010). When more than three damaging agents
were apparent, preference was given to agents with the greatest
severity of impact. Damaging agents were collected individually
and then pooled into disease, insect, and abiotic and animal dam-
age groups (Appendix A) to create site averages. Of the animal
damages caused by ungulates, ‘‘barking and rubbing’’ is only
known to occur from members of the cervidae family (Debyle,
1985), which here include Rocky Mountain elk and white-tailed
and mule deer.
We divided regeneration stems into three size classes and de-
ﬁned each as ‘‘sapling’’ (P5.1–10.1 cm DBH), ‘‘tall regeneration’’
(<5.1 cm DBH), and ‘‘short regeneration’’ (<1.37 m tall). The short
regeneration class was determined by height alone because the
height of aspen suckers, rather than the age or diameter, is a better
indicator of the likelihood of recruitment into the canopy (Baker
et al., 1997). Tree species, condition class, and damaging agent
variables were collected for sapling, tall regeneration, and short
regeneration stems. For tall and short regeneration stems, the inci-
dence of a maximum of three present and harming individual dam-
aging agents were tallied for aspen in each class, and then pooled
into groups to create site averages. We were not able to distinguish
between the ‘‘browsing’’ and ‘‘trampling’’ damages of domestic
versus wild ungulates.
2.4. Data analysis
We selected a set of predisposing and contributing factors sug-
gested by previous research to be associated with aspen decline
disease (Frey et al., 2004; Table 1). Data from the four plots per site
were used to calculate mean aspen DBH, total tree and aspen only
live density, total tree and aspen only live basal area (BA), relative
conifer density and/or BA among living stems, grouped damaging
agent percentages, and percent aspen stem and/or BA mortality.
Raw aspect was transformed into a continuous scaled variable with
a 0–2 range (set to maximum for northeast slopes) following the
equations in Beers et al. (1966). This was necessary to calculate
‘‘heat load’’ following the methods outlined in McCune and Keon
(Equation 3, 2002). Heat load is an index of temperature based
on steepness of slope, aspect about a northeast-southwest line,
and latitude. JMP 8.0.2 (SAS Institute, 2009) was used for all anal-
yses and signiﬁcance for all tests was set at a = 0.05.

Two-tailed t-tests were used to test differences between contin-
uous variables in the pine–oak and mixed conifer forest types. The
Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used when normality assumptions
were not met. Tukey’s honestly signiﬁcant difference was used
for multiple comparisons of means among overstory, sapling, tall
regeneration, and short regeneration aspen mortality. Paired,
two-tailed t-tests were used to compare live versus dead aspen
DBH and density.
Simple linear regression was used to determine the univariate
relationships
between
variables
(Zegler,
2011).
Relationships
among explanatory variables were used to check for collinearity.
Percent aspen BA mortality was the overstory response variable
and percent aspen stem mortality was the response variable for
regeneration classes. The explanatory variables for overstory and
regeneration tests were site, stand, and damaging agent factors
(Appendices A and B). For the ordinal variable ‘‘forest type’’, indica-
tor (dummy) variables were used: pine–oak type = 0 and mixed
conifer type = 1. All 48 sites were used for overstory mortality anal-
yses. Regeneration mortality analyses were problematic because of
small sample sizes, many 100% mortality values, and possible non-
linear relationships. Sample size was: n = 32 (with 20 100% values)
for sapling analyses; n = 24 (with 14 100% values) for tall regener-
ation analyses; and n = 43 (with zero 100% values) for short regen-
eration analyses. Additional tests with sample sizes limited to the
sites where live sapling (n = 12) and tall regeneration (n = 10) as-
pen stems occurred were run to remove 100% mortality values
from sapling and tall regeneration analyses. For short regeneration,
percent aspen stem mortality was log-transformed to meet
assumptions of linearity.
We used stepwise-forward multiple linear regression analyses
to explore multivariate relationships of overstory and short regen-
eration mortality as a function of site, stand, and contributing fac-
tors. The stepwise regression technique allowed us to screen a
large number of potentially useful explanatory variables to isolate
those few that contribute most to the explanation of aspen mortal-
ity; it is the ﬁrst step to more complex multivariate techniques. No
models were produced for sapling or tall regeneration stems due to
small sample sizes. Sample size was n = 35 for short regeneration
mortality because ﬁve sites had no live or dead short regeneration
aspen stems (5 null percentage values) and 8 sites had 0% mortality
(8 null log-transformed values). Candidate explanatory variables
were tested in various combinations using a probability of 0.05 to
both enter and leave the model (Draper and Smith, 1998). Selected
variables were ranked by how much variation each explained based
upon F-values (Draper and Smith, 1998). Models were tested for
homoscedasticity, normality, and variance inﬂation. Homoscedas-
ticity of errors was validated by visual inspection of the predicted
versus residual plot and a constant variance test. Normality of er-
rors was validated by visual inspection of a normal quantile plot
and a Shapiro–Wilk test. Calculations of the variance inﬂation factor
showed no evidence of multicollinearity among explanatory vari-
ables in each model. No outliers were identiﬁed from visual inspec-
tion of residuals by predicted values and outlier box plots.
3. Results
3.1. Predisposing Site and Stand Factors
During the summers of 2009 and 2010, 48 sites were sampled
from a range of elevations, slopes, and aspects (Zegler, 2011;
Appendix B). Site elevations ranged from 2094 to 2888 m. Percent
slope ranged from 3 to 59, with a mean of 25. Aspen sites occurred
on all aspects, but the majority of sites (59%) were on northerly as-
pects (between 315 and 45). The average heat load was 0.91, and
69% of sites were in the hotter and drier upper 20th percentile of
the heat load scale (0.03–1.11). Results of regression among
explanatory site factors showed that with increasing elevation,
slope
increased
(R2 = 0.23,
P = 0.0004),
heat
load
decreased
(R2 = 0.13, P = 0.01), and aspect was not signiﬁcant (P = 0.87). Of
48 sites, 15 were in were in pine–oak and 33 were in mixed conifer.
In the mixed conifer forest type, slope (P = 0.0002) was greater and
heat load was lower (P = 0.03) than in pine–oak type. Most sites
(63%) were within livestock grazing allotments.
3.1.1. Overstory and univariate relationships
Of the 48 sites, 47 had live aspen stems in the overstory class.
Mean live aspen DBH (21.7 cm) was greater than dead aspen
DBH (18.2 cm) (P < 0.0001). Mean aspen BA ranged from 0 to
52 m2 ha1, with a median of 5.3 m2 ha1. Relative conifer BA for
this size class was 67%. Aspen stem mortality averaged 50%, with
59% in pine–oak and 45% in mixed conifer. Aspen BA mortality
averaged 44%, with 57% in pine–oak and 38% in mixed conifer.
Aspen stems with light, moderate, and heavy recent crown dieback
averaged 52%, 28%, and 20%, respectively (48% had at least moder-
ate crown dieback), and there was a positive relationship between
BA mortality and crown dieback (R2 = 0.28, P < 0.0001). Aspen mor-
tality decreased with elevation and increased with relative conifer
BA. There was signiﬁcantly more mortality in pine–oak than mixed
conifer type (Table 2), but there was no difference between relative
conifer BA in pine–oak and mixed conifer type (P = 0.09).
3.1.2. Regeneration and univariate relationships
Of the 48 sites, 40 had stems in the sapling class, 32 had aspen
saplings, and only 12 had live aspen saplings. Density of aspen sap-
lings ranged from 0 to 298 stems ha1, with a median of 0 stems
ha1. Relative conifer density for this size class was 85%. Sapling
aspen stem mortality was 82%. Aspen mortality increased with
relative conifer density (Table 2) and had no relationship with total

live density (P = 0.06). Limiting the sample and analysis to sites
with live aspen saplings produced a slight negative relationship
with slope (Table 2).
Of the 48 sites, 38 had stems in the tall regeneration class, 24
had tall regeneration aspen stems, and only 10 had live tall regen-
eration aspen stems. Density of tall regeneration aspen ranged
from 0 to 3332 stems ha1, with a with a median of 0 stems
ha1. Relative conifer density for this size class was 89%. Tall regen-
eration aspen stem mortality was 72%. Aspen mortality decreased
with elevation, slope, and total live density, and increased with
heat load. The mixed conifer forest type tended to have less aspen
mortality (Table 2). Except for heat load and total live density, the
above relationships were also signiﬁcant when the sample was
limited to sites with live tall regeneration aspen stems (Table 2).
Of the 48 sites, all had stems in the short regeneration class
and 43 had short regeneration aspen stems. Of these 43 sites,
all had a live aspen component. Density of short regeneration as-
pen ranged from 0 to 17,109 stems ha1, with a median of 1517
stems ha1. Relative conifer density for this this size class was
52%. Short regeneration aspen stem mortality was 16%. This level
of mortality was signiﬁcantly lower than aspen mortality in other
size classes (P < 0.0001 for all pair-wise comparisons). Aspen mor-
tality decreased with slope, increased with relative conifer density
(Table
2),
and
had

density
(P = 0.59).
3.2. Size distributions
We produced a size–density distribution of live and dead aspen
trees by size class across all sites (Fig. 2). The best-ﬁt, negative
exponential, null model was generated from the density of live
aspen stems P 15.1 cm DBH. Based upon the best-ﬁt or expected
line, there was a lack of live aspen stems in the tall regeneration,
sapling, and smallest overstory (10.1–15 cm DBH) size classes.
There were signiﬁcantly more dead than live aspen in the sapling
and smallest overstory size classes (P < 0.0001 for both). Separate
distributions of live and dead aspen were also determined for
pine–oak and mixed conifer forest types (Fig. 3). Consistent with
overall trends, there were signiﬁcantly more dead than live aspen
in the sapling and smallest overstory size classes for both forest
types (P < 0.05 for all). However, unlike the overall and mixed coni-
fer distributions, pine–oak sites had more dead than live tall regen-
eration aspen (P = 0.004). There was no signiﬁcant difference in the
density of short regeneration aspen stems between pine–oak and
mixed conifer (P = 0.19).
3.3. Contributing damaging agents
We collected data for 45 aspen damaging agents on individual
aspen stems (Appendix A). We assessed 1805 overstory stems,
115 sapling stems, 220 tall regeneration stems, and 2984 short
regeneration stems for damaging agents, and analyzed damaging
agents by site averages per damaging agent group. Fig. 4 provides
a summary of the site averages of grouped damaging agent by size
class. In general, canker diseases, wood-boring insects, and animal
damages were the most common damaging agent groups for over-
story and sapling aspen, while animal damages was the most com-
mon agent group for tall and short regeneration aspen. Cytospora
canker (Valsa sordida), sooty-bark canker (Encoelia pruinosa),
bronze poplar borer (Agrilus liragus), ﬂathead poplar borer (Dicerca
tenebrica), and ungulate damages were widespread and common.
We observed high amounts of ungulate damages across all sites
regardless of site location inside or outside of livestock grazing
allotments (data not shown).
3.3.1. Overstory and univariate relationships
The top three damaging agent groups in the overstory class
were wood-boring insects (68%), canker diseases (53%), and animal
damages (51%) (Fig. 4). The top wood-boring insect was bronze
poplar borer (24%), the top canker was Cytospora (27%), and the
top animal damage was ungulate barking and rubbing (49%). Aspen
mortality increased with canker diseases and wood-boring insects
(Table 2) and had no relationship with animal damages (P = 0.12).
3.3.2. Regeneration and univariate relationships
The top three damaging agent groups in the sapling class were
canker diseases (74%), animal damages (66%), and wood-boring in-
sects (53%) (Fig. 4). The top canker was Cytospora (66%), the top
animal damage was ungulate barking and rubbing (66%), and the
top wood-boring insect was bronze poplar borer (30%). Aspen mor-
tality had a slight positive relationship with canker diseases
(Table 2) and no relationship with wood-boring insects (P = 0.08)
or animal damages (P = 0.19). Limiting the sample and analysis to
sites with live aspen saplings produced a slight positive relation-
ship with wood-boring insects (Table 2).
The tall regeneration class had two common damaging agent
groups; animal damages (68%) and canker diseases (30%) (Fig. 4).
The top animal damage was ungulate barking and rubbing (51%)
and the top canker was Cytospora (28%). Aspen mortality increased
with canker diseases (Table 2) and had no relationship with animal
damages (P = 0.12). The relationship with canker diseases was also
positive and signiﬁcant when the sample was limited to sites with
live tall regeneration aspen stems (Table 2).
Animal damages (58%) was the only common short regenera-
tion class damaging agent group (Fig. 4). The top animal damage
was ungulate browsing (58%). Aspen mortality increased with
animal damages (Table 2).

3.4. Multiple regression models
We examined multiple regression models for aspen mortality.
The model for overstory mortality (Table 3) accounted for 78% of
the variation based on adjusted R2 (F4,43 = 41.47, P < 0.0001). Mor-
tality decreased from pine–oak to mixed conifer (F1,43 = 5.92) and
increased with increasing relative conifer BA (F1,43 = 8.24) and
higher incidences of canker diseases (F1,43 = 33.05) and wood-bor-
ing insects (F1,43 = 33.29) (Table 3). The contributing damaging
agents explained far more variation in mortality than predisposing
factors.
The model for short regeneration mortality (Table 3) accounted
for 34% of the variation based on adjusted R2 (F3,31 = 6.80, P = 0.001).
Mortality decreased with increasing slope (F1,31 = 4.90) and in-
creased with increasing relative conifer density (F1,31 = 5.00) and
higher incidence of animal damages (F1,31 = 6.85) (Table 3). The
contributing damaging agent explained the most variation of the
three variables, but the predisposing factors combined explained
more variation mortality than the contributing damaging agent.
4. Discussion
Our results document extensive aspen crown dieback and mor-
tality in the pine–oak and mixed conifer forests of the Williams Ran-
ger District, Kaibab National Forest. Predisposing site and stand
factors, and contributing damaging agents were signiﬁcantly related
to aspen mortality, and contributed to the generally poor condition
of aspen observed across the study area. These ﬁndings are consis-
tent with the conceptual framework of a decline disease. The most
important predisposing and contributing factors depended on the
aspen size class, and, in general, aspen mortality related most
strongly to relative conifer density or BA and damaging agents.
4.1. Overstory
The only signiﬁcant site factor related to overstory aspen mor-
tality was elevation (inverse relationship), which spanned 800 m
and is related to moisture availability (Pearson, 1920; Gitlin
et al., 2006; McDowell et al., 2011; Vankat, 2011). Other site factors
such as aspect, slope, and heat load were not strongly related to
mortality because they did not represent a wide range of condi-
tions (e.g., most sites were on north-facing slopes). Since the aspen
stands occurred on relatively similar sites, stand factors and dam-
aging agents were more important for describing mortality.
Of the stand factors, only relative conifer BA and forest type
were signiﬁcantly related to overstory aspen mortality. As relative
conifer BA increased, so did aspen mortality. The gradual replace-
ment of aspen by confers is a well-documented successional pro-
cess (Baker, 1925; Mueggler, 1985; Jones, 1974; Rogers, 2002;
Strand et al., 2009; and others). Aspen mortality was higher in
the pine–oak than mixed conifer forest type. Because there was
no difference in relative conifer BA between forest types, this dif-
ference is likely explained by the higher elevations and more favor-
able moisture conditions of the mixed conifer forest type. Though
it was beyond the scope of this study, an analysis of how aspen
mortality relates to climate variables is the next logical step, and
we plan to explore the relationships between aspen annual
ring growth and climate (especially drought) (see Hanna and
Kulakowski, 2012).
Damaging agents, speciﬁcally canker diseases and wood-boring
insects, were the most important group of factors that explained
overstory aspen mortality. Of the cankers, only two were wide-
spread and common: Cytospora and sooty-bark. Sooty-bark is
widely considered the most aggressive and primary killer of aspen
in western North America, as it can kill an otherwise healthy ma-
ture aspen stem in just a few years (Juzwik et al., 1978; Hinds,
1985). While Cytospora canker and all of the wood-boring insects
are important killers of aspen, they are secondary agents that at-
tack after something else weakens host condition (Hart and Hart,
2001; Frey et al., 2004). Despite a high level of animal wounding
and the possible infection courts they provide (Hinds, 1985), over-
story mortality did not have positive relationships with animal
damages. This conﬂicts with a study conducted in northwestern
Wyoming (Hart and Hart, 2001), but agrees with as study con-
ducted in Rocky Mountain National Park (Baker et al., 1997).

The overstory aspen mortality levels we observed were gener-
ally higher than those reported in other studies. This is remarkable
because our sample of sites was random. We found 50% aspen stem
mortality across all sites compared to: (i) 7% in the northern
Rocky Mountains (Steed and Kearns, 2010); (ii) 26% in damaged
stands across the Intermountain West (St. Clair et al., 2010); (iii)
7% in healthy stands and 45% in damaged stands in southwest-
ern Colorado (Worrall et al., 2010); (iv) 15% near Flagstaff, Ari-
zona (Gitlin et al., 2006); and (v) 50% cumulative between 2000
and 2007 in damaged stands in northern Arizona (M. Fairweather,
USFS FHP, May 2011, unpublished observation).
4.2. Regeneration
In addition to high levels of overstory mortality, many of our
sites did not have aspen sapling or tall regeneration stems, and a
few sites had no aspen regeneration at all. This is intriguing be-
cause death of the aspen overstory promotes vigorous vegetative
regeneration
through
a
well-documented
hormonal
process
(Shier et al., 1985; Bartos, 2001). Our best explanations for miss-
ing size classes (cohorts) include: (i) the positive association of
root mortality with overstory mortality (Worrall et al., 2010). It
is possible that the aspen stands in our study suffered extensive
root mortality; (ii) the timing of the study compared to the
death of the overstory. With the high amounts of browse ob-
served on short regeneration aspen stems, the evidence may
have been consumed; and (iii) past mortality events that af-
fected these size classes (e.g., droughts or episodes of intense
browsing similar to those detected by Binkley et al. (2006) on
the North Kaibab).
Mortality of aspen regeneration varied with size class. Sapling
and tall regeneration aspen mortality were high (greater than
80% and 70%, respectively), while short regeneration aspen mortal-
ity was low (16%). However, our ability to detect short regenera-
tion mortality was limited because tiny dead stems do not
persist upright for as long as larger size classes and ungulates

browse away the evidence of the mortality they cause. Sapling
aspen mortality was greatest where relative conifer density was
highest.
Tall

mortality
decreased
with
increasing slope, elevation, and total live density, and increased
with heat load and location within the pine–oak type. Short regen-
eration aspen mortality increased with decreasing slope and
increasing relative conifer density. Overall, regeneration mortality
was not density-dependent. Canker diseases and animal damages
were common in the sapling and tall regeneration size classes.
The only common short regeneration damaging agent was ungu-
late browsing. We found that higher levels of canker diseases
(almost exclusively Cytospora) increased sapling and tall regener-
ation aspen mortality. Cytospora is a common, well-documented
mortality agent of aspen regeneration throughout western North
America, and the severity and extent of Cytospora canker increases
with drought stress (Hinds, 1985; Guyon et al., 1996). While ani-
mal damages did not appear to relate to sapling or tall regeneration
aspen mortality, these size classes had small sample sizes and high
levels of animal damages regardless of mortality levels. Short
regeneration mortality, however, increased with ungulate brows-

class do not add up to 100 because a maximum of three damaging agents per stem were recorded.

ing. Abundant previous research has shown that heavy, persistent
ungulate browsing can prevent successful regeneration of aspen
(Rolf, 2001; Bailey and Whitham, 2002; Binkley et al., 2006;
Fairweather et al., 2008). We observed high browsing pressure
across the entire study area.
While most sites were within livestock grazing allotments, the
steep terrain of many sites likely deterred cattle and sheep from
accessing aspen regeneration. Slopes P 40% are thought to deter
cattle and sheep (J. Stevens, USFS, January 2012, personal commu-
nication). Out of the 48 sites, we estimated that 61% were not
grazed by cattle and sheep (38% outside allotments; 23% inside
but too steep).
4.3. Size distributions
Shepperd et al. (2001) showed the size–density relationship of
healthy, self-regenerating aspen stands to follow a negative expo-
nential (reverse-J) shaped curve, where smaller, younger size clas-
ses are more abundant than larger, older size classes. Steed and
Kearns (2010) found the condition of aspen in Montana and north-
ern Idaho to be generally healthy, with low levels of mortality and
crown dieback, sufﬁcient aspen regeneration, and a reverse-J size–
density distribution. Except for missing or dead intermediate size
classes, the distribution of all 48 sites (Fig. 2) appears to follow a
reverse-J. Based upon a null model that we calculated from the
data (versus forced on our data), there was a lack of recruitment
in tall regeneration, sapling, and smallest overstory stems, suggest-
ing that aspen will not be able to replace current and future over-
story losses. However, these classes had many dead stems. Given
that mortality was not density-dependent, why did aspen in the
sapling and smallest overstory size classes die before recruiting
to the larger size classes? In both the sapling and overstory classes,
aspen mortality increased with increasing relative conifer density.
The smallest (and likely youngest) overstory aspen stems are the
ﬁrst to succumb to overtopping by conifer (Shepperd et al.,
2001). Additionally, small-circumference stems are easier for can-
kers and cambial-feeding ﬂathead borers to girdle than larger
stems. Because of this, secondary agents of normally resistant ma-
ture aspen stems (e.g., Cytospora) are available to kill regeneration
stems (Jacobi and Shepperd, 1991). This holds especially true if
some other inciting factor (e.g., drought and high temperatures)
allows for the successful attack of contributing, secondary agents.
4.4. Diseases, insects, and inciting factors
Many interacting factors contributed to aspen mortality on the
Williams Ranger District. The interaction of factors in a decline dis-
ease scenario makes it impractical to deduce single cause (Ostry
et al., 2011), especially because these interactions are complex
and poorly understood (Gitlin et al., 2006). However, signs and
symptoms of canker and wood-boring insect activity were perva-
sive on dead and crown damaged aspen. Based upon our univariate
relationships and multiple regression models, we have little doubt
that contributing damaging agents ultimately killed most of the
currently standing dead aspen stems. However, we concluded, as
did Fairweather et al. (2008) in Arizona and Marchetti et al.
(2011) in Colorado, that cankers and insects played a secondary
role in observed aspen mortality and were likely facilitated by
long-term climate trends and short-term extreme weather events,
such as severe drought and frost events (USDA, 2000; Williams
et al., 2010; Ganey and Vojta, 2011). The Southwest has experi-
enced a regional drought since 1996, with particularly dry condi-
tions from 1996 to 2007 and severe drought in 2000 and 2002
(Breshears et al., 2005; Ganey and Vojta, 2011). These extremely
hot and dry conditions rendered aspen susceptible to the attacks
of cankers and insects (Hogg et al., 2008; Marchetti et al., 2011).
5. Conclusions
Quaking aspen populations in the Southwest, as elsewhere in
the western United States, are experiencing recent and rapid crown
dieback and mortality. We initiated this study to quantify the
crown dieback and mortality of aspen and to explore relationships
between mortality and site and stand characteristics and contribut-
ing biotic agents. We found that half of the aspen overstory recently
died, and of the remaining living stems, roughly half suffer from
considerable recent crown dieback. We can expect many of these
living but crown damaged stems to succumb to mortality in the
near future. As with other studies that have observed signiﬁcant
tree mortality in southwestern forests at this elevation (Gitlin
et al., 2006; Ganey and Vojta, 2011), we may be observing signs
of long-term climate trends and short-term extreme weather
events. The Southwest is forecasted to transition to a more arid cli-
mate (Seager et al., 2007; Seager and Vecchi, 2010). Under climate
change, the aspen stands we see in decline today may not just be a
temporary phase but a shift in this species’ distribution (Gitlin et al.,
2006; Rehfeldt et al., 2009), as the aspen in our low-elevation
pine–oak sites are experiencing a population crash as described
by Breshears et al. (2008). Since our study area is located near the
southwestern edge of aspen’s contiguous geographical range, it will
likely experience some of the greatest drought-related impacts.
Long-term aspen decline is not primarily a mortality issue, nor
is it a decline disease; it is a reduction in aspen type, driven mostly
by long-term successional processes under altered disturbance re-
gimes, and often ampliﬁed by heavy ungulate browsing (Ripple
and Larsen, 2000). Sudden aspen decline (SAD) describes the rapid
deterioration of aspen on a landscape scale, and often accompanied
by root mortality and insufﬁcient regeneration to replace overstory
losses (Worrall et al., 2008). While the extensive mortality and
crown dieback exhibited by aspen in the study area is comparable
to a rapid decline of aspen elsewhere, successional processes also
play a signiﬁcant role in the current health of aspen forests on
the Williams Ranger District. Aspen in our study area suffer from
extensive mortality relating to predisposing and contributing
factors of a decline disease, and, in addition, an important inciting
factor: frequent intense drought.
The lack of live small-diameter aspen stems across the study
area epitomizes aspen’s poor current condition, and, in the absence
of intensive management, likely forecasts a grim future. The
authors of a recent summary document about aspen restoration
(O’Brien et al., 2010) assert that self-replacing (self-regenerating)
aspen stands require two regeneration size classes each to
maintain live densities of at least 1250 stems ha1 (Bartos and
Campbell, 1998; Kurzel et al., 2007; Rogers et al., 2010). The com-
bined live density for aspen sapling and tall regeneration stems
(roughly one of their classes) was below this level at 96% of our
sites, while the density of live short regeneration stems (roughly
their other class) was below this level 48% of our sites. If current
trends in depleted recruitment continue, conifer will come to dom-
inate aspen stands after mature overstory aspen stems die.
