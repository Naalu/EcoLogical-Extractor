Pinyon-juniper ecosystems occur extensively across western North America, and at the landscape scale, variation
in structure and composition is inﬂuenced by topographic position, soils, disturbance history, and local climate.
The persistent pinyon-juniper woodland is a common structural form, and though they are known to be
infrequent-ﬁre systems, there is increasing interest in implementation of hazardous fuels reduction treatments
in woodlands, especially in the wildland-urban interface. Few studies have quantiﬁed stand dynamics following
fuels reduction treatments in persistent woodlands or compared treatment outcomes to conditions that develop
under natural disturbance and successional processes. In 2004, we established a randomized, replicated study in
woodlands of northern Arizona, and monitored stand dynamics and understory responses to determine how
stand-level changes differed between common fuels reduction approaches. We compared the resulting structure
with a conceptual state-and-transition model. Results showed that, over the 11 yr after treatment, juniper tree
densities decreased by 8.4% and 0.9% but increased by 14.0% and 27.3% in Control, Burn, Thin, and Thin + Burn
treatments, respectively. Pinyon tree densities decreased by 1.1% and 3.3%, increased by 12.2%, and decreased
7.9% in Control, Burn, Thin, and Thin + Burn treatments, respectively. All treatments showed fuel load reductions
throughout the 11-yr study period and minimal rebound of tree recruitment toward pretreatment conditions.
Prescribed ﬁre alone (Burn) maintained persistent woodland conditions. Thinning treatments substantially re-
duced small tree densities and, with the addition of prescribed ﬁre, produced losses of large trees. Thinning
with prescribed ﬁre (Thin + Burn) tended to produce conditions qualitatively unlike those described by our
state-and-transition model. Evaluation of these commonly used fuels treatments against our state-and-
transition model suggested that concerns regarding loss of ecological integrity may be warranted.

Introduction
Pinyon-juniper ecosystems occur extensively across western North
America and are found on about 30 M ha in the United States (West,
1999). At a subcontinental scale, species composition, structural charac-
teristics, and historical disturbance regimes are thought to correspond
to a seasonal precipitation gradient extending from the Paciﬁc North-
west and western California to southern New Mexico and western
Texas (Romme et al., 2009). Much of the distribution of the pinyon-
juniper type is found in the Great Basin and Southwest regions, and
pinyon-juniper woodlands and savannas comprise over half the for-
ested land in the states of Arizona and New Mexico (Pearson, 1931;
Gottfried, 2004; Romme et al., 2009). At the landscape scale, variation
in structure and composition is inﬂuenced by topographic position,
soils, disturbance history, and local climate (Jacobs et al., 2008; Poulos
et al., 2009). For example, persistent woodlands occur across the Colo-
rado Plateau on ﬁre-protected sites and where production of ﬁne fuels
is limited. In northern Arizona, persistent Utah juniper−Colorado pin-
yon pine (Junipeus osteosperma−Pinus edulis) woodlands are found
on upland sites, commonly adjacent to ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa)
forests. Several studies have concluded that infrequent stand-
replacing ﬁre regimes characterized these ecosystems before Anglo-
American settlement of the region (Floyd et al., 2000; Huffman et al.,
2008; Kennard and Moore, 2013). Long, ﬁre-free periods allow develop-
ment of uneven-aged stands, with relatively high canopy cover and
numbers of “old” trees, and sparse understory plant cover (Romme

et al., 2003). In contrast, wooded shrublands are thought to be areas of
tree expansion and contraction occurring on sites that are favorable to
shrub development (Romme et al., 2009). Wooded shrublands are
thought to be more open in structure than persistent woodlands, and
natural disturbances in this type are severe but not extensive. Mixed-
severity ﬁre in wooded shrublands is thought to result in variable tree
densities and complex, dynamic structural characteristics. Finally,
pinyon-juniper savannas are more open than wooded shrublands and
are characterized by widely spaced trees and relatively high grass
cover in intervening spaces. Unlike persistent woodlands, structural
conditions of pinyon-juniper savannas are thought to be maintained
by high-frequency, low-severity surface ﬁre (Margolis, 2014).
High-severity crown ﬁre in dense woodlands and recent tree in-
creases in savannas, as well as expansion of trees into grasslands and
shrublands, have prompted ecological restoration and hazardous fuels
reduction programs in pinyon-juniper systems (Jacobs and Gatewood,
1999; Huffman et al., 2009; Redmond et al., 2014). Restoration and
fuel-reduction treatments are typically designed to address conditions
that have resulted from ﬁre exclusion in frequent-ﬁre forests (Agee
and Skinner, 2005). Approaches commonly include thinning trees that
likely would not have established under a frequent-ﬁre regime and
reintroducing surface ﬁre through prescribed burning. Frequent-ﬁre
forests following restoration and fuel treatments are intended to be
more open with lower canopy cover and have fewer small, young
trees; lower surface fuel loading; and increased herbaceous ground
cover (Covington et al., 1997; Moore et al., 1999; Schwilk et al., 2009).
Aspects of these treatments, however, may be ineffective for reducing
ﬁre behavior in infrequent-ﬁre types (e.g., persistent woodland), or
may target key structural features and result in negative impacts on eco-
logical function (Brown et al., 2004). For example, thinning for restora-
tion and fuel reduction commonly targets small trees (i.e., “ladder
fuels”) for removal in order to increase crown base height and lower
the potential for transition of surface ﬁre into the canopy (Agee and
Skinner, 2005). However, persistent woodlands may exist for centuries
without major disturbance, and tree size distributions often follow a
negative exponential (“inverse-j”) form (Huffman et al., 2013). In
these ecosystems, removal of small trees could create novel structural
conditions with minimal resemblance to forms developing from natural
disturbance (Romme et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2009). Although there
is increasing interest in implementation of hazardous fuels reduction
treatments, especially in wildland-urban interface (WUI) areas, more
information is needed to better understand long-term woodland re-
sponses to treatments and evaluate outcomes against those produced
by natural disturbances.
Utilization of strategies that mimic patterns of natural disturbance
and management of ecosystems within natural ranges of variation
have been suggested as approaches to better conserve species, habitat,
and critical ecological functions (Holling and Meffe, 1996; Landres
et al., 1999; Lindenmayer et al., 2006). Conceptual state-and-transition
models that describe changes in ecological characteristics over time
and in response to disturbance can be useful for evaluating manage-
ment actions (Bestelmeyer et al., 2004; Suding and Hobbs, 2009). Sev-
eral authors have described state-and-transition models for pinyon-
juniper ecosystems (Jameson, 1994; Davenport et al., 1998; Holmgren
and Scheffer, 2001; Gori and Bate, 2007). These models predict a
range of responses to natural disturbances and expected response path-
ways depending on type, intensity, and time since disturbance. For ex-
ample, major ﬁres that occur infrequently (N 100 yr natural ﬁre
rotation) in persistent woodlands are commonly severe and result in
open patches of early successional species (Fig. 1). Recovery of struc-
tural characteristics and complexity after stand-replacing ﬁre may re-
quire long periods of time, from several decades to more than a
century (Arnold et al., 1964; Erdman, 1970; Huffman et al., 2012). In
contrast, in the absence of ﬁre, savanna systems may transition over
time toward closed woodlands and cross-environmental thresholds
that favor tree cover over success of understory species (Davenport
et al., 1998; Jacobs, 2015) (see Fig. 1). Focal attributes distinguishing sta-
ble states in these models typically include degree of canopy cover,
abundance of “old” trees, relative importance of young trees, and under-
story composition and development (e.g., Romme et al., 2003, 2009)
(see Fig. 1). Nonlinear and nonequilibrium responses are recognized,
and woodlands may not recover to initial conditions if physical param-
eters or feedback processes are altered (Jameson, 1994; Tausch, 1999;
Briske et al., 2008). To date, few studies have quantiﬁed stand dynamics
after fuel reduction treatments in pinyon-juniper woodlands or
interpreted outcomes in terms of ecological states and transitions oc-
curring in response to natural disturbances and succession. This infor-
mation would allow land managers to better evaluate these
treatments for their effectiveness in accomplishing both fuel reduction
and conservation objectives.
In this study, we remeasured hazardous fuel reduction treatments in
persistent pinyon-juniper woodlands on the Kaibab National Forest in
northern Arizona. Thinning and prescribed burning were applied, both
respectively and in combination, in 2005−2006 as part of a random-
ized, replicated, experimental design. Overstory structure, tree regener-
ation, surface and canopy fuels, and understory vegetation responses
were monitored for 11 yr in order to meet the following objectives:
1) determine how stand-level dynamics differ between common fuels
reduction approaches; 2) compare ecological conditions resulting
from treatments with a conceptual model of states and transitions
driven by natural disturbances in pinyon-juniper ecosystems; and
3) use state-and-transition comparisons to assess treatment effective-
ness for long-term fuel management and ecosystem conservation?
Methods
Study Site
We conducted our study at a 760-ha site in the Tusayan Ranger Dis-
trict of the Kaibab National Forest in northern Arizona (Fig. 2). The site
was identiﬁed by the US Forest Service for hazardous fuel reduction
treatments to help safeguard Grand Canyon National Park and the
town of Tusayan, Arizona from wildﬁre. Elevation at the site ranges
from 2 005 to 2 073 m, and vegetation is transitional with representa-
tion of Rocky Mountain and Madrean montane conifer forests, primarily
composed of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) overstories occupying
canyon bottoms and Great Basin conifer woodlands, dominated by Col-
orado pinyon (Pinus edulis) and Utah Juniper (Juniperus osteosperma),
occurring on the uplands (Brown, 1994; Huffman et al., 2008). Gambel
oak (Quercus gambelii) is found scattered in low densities throughout
the site. Our study was focused on responses of the pinyon-juniper
woodlands occurring on the upland microsites. Soils in these communi-
ties are Typic Haplustalfs with gravelly, loam texture, derived from
limestone parent material (USDA Forest Service, 1991). Precipitation
at the study site is typical of northern Arizona and falls mainly in sum-
mer as punctuated monsoonal rains generated from convection storms
and moist air that moves into the region from the Gulf of California and
Gulf of Mexico and in winter as snow from Paciﬁc frontal systems. Com-
mon shrubs occurring at the site include Stansbury’s cliffrose (Purshia
mexicana var. stansburyana), Apache plume (Fallugia paradoxa), big
sagebrush and black sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata and A. nova), rub-
ber rabbitbrush (Ericameria nauseosa), and broom snakeweed
(Gutierrezia sarothrae). Numerous forbs are found in these communities
with winged and redroot buckwheat (Eriogonum alatum and
E. racemosum), ﬁneleaf hymenopappus (Hymenopappus ﬁlifolius), toad-
ﬂax penstemon and thickleaf penstemon (Penstemon linarioides and
P. pachyphyllus), and mid bladderpod (Physaria intermedia) being
among the more common species. Common graminoids (grass and
grasslike species) include native blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis),
Junegrass (Koeleria macrantha), muttongrass (Poa fendleriana), and
White Mountain sedge (Carex geophila). The site has not been grazed
by domestic livestock since the late 1990s; however, native ungulates
758

(deer and elk) do use the site and intensive grazing is known to have oc-
curred historically throughout the region (Jacobs and Gatewood, 1999;
Landis and Bailey, 2005; Huffman et al., 2008).
Historical ﬁre rotation at the site was 340 yr (Huffman et al.,
2008). Infrequent, stand-replacing ﬁres resulted in a ﬁne-grained
mosaic of stand ages across the landscape. Dendrochronological
evidence suggests that no large, stand-replacing ﬁre has occurred
for several centuries, and stands with pinyon pine trees ≥200 yr
in age occurred on N 80% of the study site area before fuel reduc-
tion treatments.
Experimental Design
In 2004, we established a randomized complete block design to ex-
amine effects of two hazardous fuel reduction approaches—tree thin-
ning and prescribed ﬁre—on forest structure, tree mortality, tree
recruitment and regeneration, and understory plant community charac-
teristics. Six blocks were selected on the basis of topographic character-
istics and location within the study area (see Fig. 2). We used a
geographic information system (GIS) to delineate blocks and identify lo-
cations (points) on which experimental treatment units and ﬁeld sam-
ple plots would be centered. Eight points (two replicates of each of four
treatments—see below) were randomly selected from a rectangular grid
(200-m) overlaid on each experimental block polygon in the GIS. Se-
lected points were then randomly assigned to one of four treatments
with two examples of each treatment in each block (n = 12). Treat-
ments assigned were as follows: 1) untreated control (Control); 2) pre-
scribed ﬁre (Burn); 3) tree thinning (Thin); and 4) thinning followed by
prescribed ﬁre (Thin + Burn) (see Fig. 2). Thinning prescriptions (both
Thin and Thin + Burn) were modeled after actual fuels reduction treat-
ments planned for the site by the U.S. Forest Service. The prescriptions
called for removing juniper trees up to 30.5 cm in diameter at root collar
(drc) and pinyon pine trees up to 22.9 cm drc. Ponderosa pine trees up
to 22.9 cm in diameter at breast height (1.37 m aboveground; dbh)
were removed, whereas all Gambel oak were retained and not cut. On
our study units, spacing protocols were not used, although on the larger
operational treatment at the site, smaller trees (i.e., below prescription
limits) were left in situations where removing them would create unde-
sirably large (e.g., N ca 0.01 ha) openings (H. McRae, US Forest Service,
personal communication).
Field Sampling
In 2004, selected points described earlier were located in the ﬁeld
using hand-held global positioning systems (GPS). Experimental treat-
ment units, 100 × 100 m (1 ha) in size, were traversed around each of
the 48 points and demarcated using tree paint and ﬂagging tape. Cen-
tered within each treatment unit, we established one circular sample
plot, 0.04 ha in size. Sample plot centers were permanently
monumented and georeferenced for relocation and long-term
monitoring.
Before fuel reduction treatment implementation, we con-
ducted measurements on ﬁeld plots to quantify overstory struc-
tural characteristics, surface and canopy fuel loading, tree
regeneration density and species composition, and understory
vegetation cover and species richness. On each plot, standing
trees (N 1.37 m in height) were numbered and ﬁtted with alumi-
num tags nailed at 40 cm aboveground, and condition (live or
dead) and species were recorded. Diameter (drc for juniper and
pinyon pine; dbh for ponderosa pine and Gambel oak) and total
height were recorded for all standing trees, and height-to-crown
base was recorded for live trees. In addition, average crown radius
was estimated for live juniper trees. Dead and down trees were
located, and drc or dbh was estimated as determined by species.
On a smaller (100-m2) nested subplot, we tallied tree regenera-
tion (b 1.37 m height) by species, condition (live or dead), and
height class. Height classes were as follows: 1) b 40 cm;
2) 40–80 cm; and 3) N 80–137 cm in total height. Dead woody

surface fuels were sampled on a randomly oriented planar tran-
sect (15 m) following methods described in Brown (1974). On
these transects, we tallied intersecting woody fuels by moisture
release timelag class and measured depth of the forest ﬂoor detri-
tal layer at points every 1.5 m. Forest ﬂoor depth measurements
were taken separately for litter (Oi) and duff (Oe + Oa) O-
horizon soil layers. Fuels timelag classes followed those described
in Brown (1974).
Understory community characteristics were sampled along a 50-m
line transect centered on each plot with the 25-m point located at plot
center. Transects were systematically oriented parallel with plot slope.
Species occurrence was recorded within a 10 × 50 m belt arrayed
along the sampling transect at each plot. Plant nomenclature was veri-
ﬁed using local keys (e.g., Kearney and Peebles, 1964; Springer et al.,
2009), and nativity, duration, and life form were determined using the
US Department of Agriculture Plants Database (https://plants.usda.
gov/). Species and substrate cover (%) were estimated in 10 quadrats
(50 × 200 cm) per plot located at 5-m intervals and on alternating
sides of each transect (but see below). Substrate types identiﬁed were
bare soil, litter (ﬁne forest ﬂoor debris), rock, and wood (N 7.6 cm
width). In addition, tree canopy cover was estimated along each tran-
sect by using a densitometer and taking readings at 16 equally spaced
points. Plot measurements were taken in 2004 before treatment imple-
mentation (“pretreatment”), as well as in 2007 (1 yr post treatment)
and 2017 (11 yr post treatment). In addition to the above years, under-
story vegetation measurements were also collected in 2011 (ﬁve yr
post-treatment). Due to time constraints, 5 of the 10 understory sam-
pling quadrats on each plot were systematically selected for remeasure-
ment in 2017. Plots were measured between late May and early June in
all sampling years.
Treatment Implementation
Treatment of the experimental units was implemented by the US
Forest Service in 2004−2006. Trees were hand-felled using chainsaws,
and thinning debris was lopped to ~16 cm in length and scattered. Tree
boles were not removed from the site, and dispersed fuelwood gather-
ing by the public was allowed but resulted in minimal wood removal
from our sample plots. Prescribed ﬁre was implemented on experimen-
tal units in fall of 2006 using drip torches and hand ignition. Discontin-
uous surface fuel cover required crews to target fuel “jackpots”
(i.e., heavier aggregations) rather than use more common broadcast
burning techniques. Relative humidity was 15−20% and wind speeds
(6 m height) were up to 16 km h−1 on the days of burning. More details
concerning treatment implementation and prescribed burn conditions
can be found in Huffman et al. (2009 and 2013)
Analysis
Huffman et al. (2009) reported ﬁrst-yr post-treatment effects of
thinning and prescribed ﬁre at our site; therefore, we limited our inter-
est in treatment effects on overstory structure and fuels to 2017 re-
sponses. We used 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for blocked
designs and analyzed tree density (trees ha−1), stand basal area (BA;
m2 ha−1), individual tree basal area growth rate (cm2 yr−1), tree can-
opy cover (%), crown fuel load (kg m−2), canopy bulk density (kg
m−3), sum of 1-100-hr timelag surface fuels classes (Mg ha−1), and lit-
ter cover Tree diameter (drc) was included as a covariate (P b 0.05) in
models for testing treatment effects on tree growth. Canopy cover and
litter cover were arcsine-transformed before analysis to stabilize vari-
ance. Crown fuel loading and canopy bulk density were calculated

within 1-ha units for untreated (Control), prescribed ﬁre only (Burn), tree thinning only (Thin), and combined thinning and ﬁre (Thin + Burn) treatments.

using allometric equations that related tree diameter and crown area to
foliage biomass (Miller et al., 1981; Grier et al., 1992; see also Huffman
et al., 2009). Before ANOVA, we used Shapiro-Wilk to test for data nor-
mality and Levine’s test to assess for equal variance. When data showed
non-normal distributions, we used either the square-root or natural log
transformation to better meet this assumption. We used Welch’s test to
analyze for treatment effects when variances were unequal. When sig-
niﬁcant (P b 0.05) treatment effects were found, we used Tukey’s hon-
estly
signiﬁcant difference (HSD)
post-hoc tests
for pairwise
comparisons (Kuehl, 1994). An alpha level of 0.05 was used for these
ANOVA tests to determine statistical signiﬁcance. To test for differences
in post-treatment (2007−2017) pinyon and juniper tree mortality, we
used z-tests for independent proportions (i.e., two-by-two contingency
tables). We used a Bonferonni correction and alpha = 0.0125 to deter-
mine statistical signiﬁcance for these multiple pairwise comparisons.
To test for treatment effects on regeneration over time, we used
ANOVA for repeated measures and analyzed mean density within
each seedling size class, as well as all size classes combined (see earlier
section “Field Sampling”). We also used ANOVA for repeated measures
to test for treatment effects on understory plant cover and species rich-
ness. Total cover data were transformed using the square root to meet
ANOVA assumptions for normality. When time × treatment interactions
were found, we performed 1-way ANOVA tests within treatment years.
For these tests, Tukey’s HSD post-hoc tests were used for pairwise com-
parisons of treatment group means. An alpha level of 0.05 was used for
all ANOVA tests to determine statistical signiﬁcance.
To examine effects of fuel treatments on ecological states and transi-
tions, we ﬁrst constructed a conceptual state and transition model (see
Fig. 1) based on descriptions found in the published literature (Arnold
et al., 1964; Romme et al., 2003; Landis and Bailey, 2005; Gori and
Bate, 2007; Romme et al., 2009). We next explored post-treatment
structural states using plot values and k-means cluster analysis
(Kaufman and Rousseeuw, 1990). K-means is an iterative ﬁtting process
that can allow partitioning of multivariate data into groups using a set of
attributes that is assumed to be important in determining a plot’s mem-
bership or allocation to a particular state. On the basis of our conceptual
model, we selected the following attributes for clustering: 1) number of
large trees (N 35 cm drc); 2) number of small trees (≤35 cm drc); 3) can-
opy cover; 4) graminoid cover; and 5) shrub cover. These variables
emerged in the literature as being important for describing pinyon-
juniper structural states. Attribute values on each plot were calculated
from 2017 ﬁeld data and then standardized (z-score) before cluster

analysis. We chose the range of k to be 3−16 clusters or groups, based
on the number of ecological states in our conceptual model (N = 3, with
exception of “skeletal woodland”—see Fig. 1) and number of sample
plots (N = 48). Group number maximizing the cubic clustering criteria
(CCC) was chosen as the optimal solution. Using the ﬁnal set of groups
(i.e., ecological states), we identiﬁed proportions of plots within treat-
ments that were associated with each ecological state. We then used
these proportions to calculate a weighted pooled mean score for each
treatment group. Pooled mean scores for each attribute were used to
qualitatively evaluate structural characteristics for each treatment
against our conceptual model.
Results
Overstory Dynamics
Over the post-treatment period 2007−2017, mean juniper tree
mortality was 2.1−13.5% and pinyon tree mortality was 4.3−26.2%
(Fig. 3A). Although juniper mortality tended to be low in the Thin treat-
ment, we found no statistically signiﬁcant differences among treat-
ments. Pinyon mortality in Thin + Burn was signiﬁcantly greater than
that of the other treatments (see Fig. 3A). Mortality and ingrowth
(i.e., trees recruited into the overstory (≥1.37 m height) from the seed-
ling class (b 1.37 m height) jointly affected net change in tree density.
For juniper, mean tree density decreased by 8.4% and 0.9% in Control
and Burn treatments, respectively, between 2007 and 2017. In contrast,
juniper tree density increased by 14.0% and 27.3% on average for Thin
and Thin + Burn treatments, respectively. We found a similar pattern
for pinyon pine tree density changes. In Control and Burn treatments,
pinyon tree density decreased 1.1% and 3.3%, respectively. In the Thin
treatment, pinyon tree density increased by 12.2%. In contrast to juni-
per, pinyon tree density in the Thin +Burn treatment decreased 7.9%
from 2007 to 2017.
Post-treatment (2007−2017) basal area growth rates of individual
trees were 7.4−11.8 cm2 yr−1 and 2.7−8.2 cm2 yr−1 for juniper and
pinyon pine, respectively (see Fig. 3B). Mean growth rates of juniper
trees tended to be greater in Thin and Thin + Burn treatments than
Control and Burn, but treatments were not statistically different. Pinyon
pine trees showed a pattern similar to that of juniper, and mean growth
rates in all treatments were signiﬁcantly greater than that of the Control
treatment. Mortality, ingrowth, and tree BA growth rates jointly af-
fected net change in overall stand-level BA (m2 ha−1). In the Control
treatment, juniper BA decreased by 6.2% between 2007 and 2017. In
Burn and Thin treatments, juniper BA increased by 7% and 8.8%, respec-
tively. Juniper BA decreased in Thin + Burn treatment by 5% from 2007
to 2017. Pinyon pine BA showed an increase of 8.4% in the Control treat-
ment, no change in Burn, an increase of 3.5% in the Thin treatment, and a
decrease of 19.1% in Thin + Burn. Combined species BA in 2017 was
signiﬁcantly greater in Control and Burn compared with Thin and Thin
+ Burn treatments (Table 1).
In 2017, 11 yr after treatment implementation, mean tree density
(pinyon and juniper combined) was signiﬁcantly lower in the Thin
and Thin + Burn treatments compared with the Control and Burn treat-
ments (see Table 1). Tree density in the Thin + Burn treatment was
about 24% that of the Control and 32% that of the Burn treatment. Effects
of thinning from below (i.e., small size classes) remained evident in
2017 (Fig. 4A and B). Thinning shifted diameter class distribution from
negative exponential (all-sized) forms in 2004 (see Fig. 4A) to
unimodal-shaped distributions, which were still apparent in 2017 (see
Fig. 4B). Before treatment (2004), the smallest-diameter class (≤
15 cm drc) was largely dominated by pinyon pine and had more trees
than the next larger class (15.1−35.0 cm) by 2.2- to 2.5-fold. In 2017,
the smallest-size class in thinned treatments showed more even num-
bers of pinyon and juniper trees and about half the abundance observed
in the next-larger class (see Fig. 4B). In contrast, although total tree
number was reduced in the Burn treatment, the distribution of diame-
ters for this treatment in 2017 maintained a negative exponential
form (see Fig. 4B).
Canopy and Surface Fuels
In 2017, means for canopy cover, crown fuel load, and canopy bulk
density showed a consistent pattern of decrease with increasing treat-
ment intensity, as follows: Control N Burn N Thin N Thin + Burn (see
Table 1). Mean canopy cover was signiﬁcantly greater in the Control
compared with Thin and Thin + Burn (see Table 1). Canopy cover in
the Control was similar to Burn, and Burn was similar to the Thin treat-
ment. Crown fuel load was signiﬁcantly higher in the Control and Burn
treatments compared with Thin and Thin + Burn. Crown fuel load in
Thin + Burn was 38% that of the Control, and means in Thin and Burn
treatments were 57% and 83% of the Control mean, respectively (see
Table 1). Canopy bulk density was signiﬁcantly higher (P b 0.05) in
the Control and Burn treatments compared with Thin + Burn (see
Table 1). Dead woody surface fuels tended to increase with intensity
of treatment. However, we found no statistical differences between
treatments in mean loading of combined 1- to 100-hr timelag classes
(see Table 1). In contrast, litter cover systematically decreased with
treatment intensity (see Table 1). In 2017, litter cover was signiﬁcantly
higher in the Control treatment compared with Thin and Thin +Burn
treatments, which in turn were not statistically different.
Tree Regeneration and Understory Vegetation
Mean total density of tree seedlings was not affected by treatment,
nor were densities of juniper or pinyon when analyzed by species and
size class (Fig. 5). Further, we found no effect of treatment on density

of seedling within size classes for either species. In general, seedling
number decreased from 2004 (pretreatment) to 2007 (1-yr post treat-
ment) across all treatments, including the Control. With the exception
of juniper seedlings in Thin and Thin + Burn, densities further de-
creased from 2007 to 2011 in all species × treatment combinations
(see Fig. 5). From 2011 to 2017, total seedling densities tended to in-
crease. Size class distributions were dominated by seedlings b 40 cm
in height, regardless of the measurement year, species, or treatment
(see Fig. 5). This was especially pronounced for pinyon pine.
Understory plant cover showed a signiﬁcant treatment effect, as well
as a signiﬁcant treatment × year interaction (Fig. 6). When measure-
ment years were analyzed separately, we found signiﬁcant differences
in total plant cover among treatments for each year. Cover in the Control
tended to remain constant over the study period, whereas that in Burn
decreased immediately after treatment implementation and then in-
creased from 2011 to 2017 (see Fig. 6). Cover in the Thin treatment in-
creased steadily over time, whereas that in Thin + Burn showed an
initial decrease and then a higher rate of increase than other treatments
for the remainder of the study period. By 2017, the Control showed sig-
niﬁcantly lower plant cover than Thin and Thin + Burn treatments but
was not different than Burn. The Thin + Burn treatment showed the
highest total plant cover but was not signiﬁcantly different than that
of Thin (see Fig. 6). In all treatments, plant composition was dominated
by the graminoid functional group, followed by shrubs, then forbs (see
Fig. 6). Graminoid cover in Thin + Burn tended to be higher than
cover of other functional groups in other treatments but was b 6%. Sim-
ilarly, shrub cover in Thin + Burn was b 3% (see Fig. 6). Non-native spe-
cies cover across all treatments averaged b 1% in 2017. Cheatgrass
(Bromus tectorum) was found on b 4% of Control, Burn, and Thin plots
but occurred on 23% of Thin + Burn plots. We found no signiﬁcant effect
of treatment on species richness. In 2004, mean number of species
found per 500 m2 transect was 26.9−28.6. Number of species tended
to increase over time in all treatments, and by 2017 richness averaged
31.3−38.0 species per 500 m2. Species composition was dominated
by forbs, followed by graminoids, then shrubs.
Cluster Analysis
Twelve groups (i.e., ecological states) were identiﬁed by k-means
cluster analysis (CCC = −0.3777) using standardized plot values for
ﬁve key structural attributes. Treatments generally segregated into
unique groups, and these were evaluated against state descriptions in
our conceptual model. For example, Control plots were associated
with 5 of the 12 groups and were characterized by relatively high num-
bers of small trees, high tree canopy cover, and low graminoid cover
(Fig. 7). Pooled mean scores for large trees and shrub cover in these

groups were near zero (−0.2−0.2). These groups showed attribute
qualities similar to those described for the persistent woodland state
in our conceptual model (see Fig. 1). Burn plots showed greater variabil-
ity than the Control treatment and were associated with 7 of the 12
groups. Pooled mean scores showed that Burn plots were similar in
structure to Control plots, but with higher relative numbers of large
trees and higher relative shrub cover (see Fig. 7). Plots in the Thin treat-
ment were associated with 4 of the 12 groups and were characterized
mainly by low numbers of small trees, low canopy cover, and high
graminoid cover. Open canopy and high graminoid cover were qualities
that ﬁt descriptions of the pinyon-juniper savanna state (see Fig. 1).
Thin + Burn plots were associated with low numbers of large and
small trees, low canopy cover, high graminoid cover, and high shrub
cover (see Fig. 7). Conditions in Thin + Burn plots did not correspond
well with any of the state descriptions in our model.
Discussion
Fuel Treatment Effects on Stand Dynamics
Hazardous fuels reduction and restoration treatments that include
tree thinning and prescribed ﬁre are designed to address ecological
changes that have come about due to anthropogenic exclusion of ﬁre
in historically frequent-ﬁre ecosystems (Graham et al., 2004; McIver
et al., 2009). Although frequent-ﬁre systems have been identiﬁed as
high priority for fuel reduction and restoration (e.g., Brown et al.,
2004), such treatments are commonly implemented in persistent
pinyon-juniper woodlands, particularly within wildland-urban inter-
face areas (Schoennagel and Nelson, 2011), where protection of
human communities from wildﬁre may outweigh conservation con-
cerns. However, few studies have analyzed longer-term overstory dy-
namics after treatments in these woodlands.
At our site in northern Arizona, stand dynamics over the 11-yr study
period differed among treatments for tree mortality, individual tree
growth, ingrowth, and stand-level changes in density. Untreated Con-
trols generally maintained stand structural characteristics that existed
before implementation of the study, although with a minor shift toward
increasing pinyon pine importance. Decreases in overstory density from
2007 to 2017 in the Control treatment indicated that climate, in concert
with treatment, affected outcomes. Prescribed ﬁre alone (Burn) pro-
duced minor effects on stand structure, and low rates of subsequent
mortality resulted in only small reductions in canopy fuels over the
study period. In the Thin treatment, tree density and stand-level BA in-
creased for both juniper and pinyon pine, indicating maintenance of
overstory species composition and patterns that could lead to eventual
recovery of pretreatment conditions. Consistent patterns of tree recruit-
ment and BA increases for both juniper and pinyon on Thin plots sug-
gested that structural conditions and fuels in this treatment may
rebound more rapidly toward pretreatment conditions than those in
Thin + Burn. In the Thin + Burn treatment, gains in juniper tree density
with losses of stand-level juniper BA suggested that mortality was fo-
cused on larger trees, and small trees were recruited (i.e., ingrowth)
from understory seedlings banks, which offset mortality. Pinyon pine
declined in tree density and BA, suggesting that individual tree growth
and recruitment did not offset the high level of mortality, which in
turn disproportionately affected larger trees. These shifts in stand com-
position and structure are similar to those observed after severe out-
breaks of pinyon ips beetle (Ips confusus) (Negrón and Wilson, 2003).

Structural changes initiated by thinning and burning treatments
persisted for 11 yr. Persistence of treatment effects illustrated typical
slow recovery to disturbance and management activities in these eco-
systems (Erdman, 1970). Further, some fuels characteristics showed
lower values in 2017 than those reported immediately after treatment.
For example, mean crown fuel loads continued to decline over the study
period (see Table 1) and were lower in 2017 compared with those re-
ported in Huffman et al. (2009). Decline in crown fuel load reﬂected
continuing mortality of larger overstory trees in all treatments, but par-
ticularly in Thin + Burn. Delayed mortality and reductions in fuel load-
ing continuing for several years after treatment have been reported in
other systems (Stephens et al., 2012; Roccaforte et al., 2018). We did
not attempt to identify factors related to secondary tree mortality, but
interacting effects of residual damage from ﬁre, bark beetle infestation,
and drought were likely important. For example, Negrón and Wilson
(2003) found that pinyon ips beetle infestation increased with pinyon
stand density and individual tree size. Breece et al. (2008) reported
that prescribed ﬁre increased bark beetle attacks, and tree morality
was positively related with crown damage and bark beetle attack in
southwestern ponderosa pine forests. Morillas et al. (2017) found re-
duced soil water content and tree sap ﬂow rates after experimental re-
duction in pinyon density during a droughty period (2011−2012) in
pinyon-juniper woodlands of New Mexico.
Many restoration and fuels reduction studies in pinyon-juniper eco-
systems have focused primarily on understory vegetation, soils, and hy-
drologic responses to treatments. For example, Ross et al. (2012)
reported that understory plant cover was 4- and 15-fold greater in
thinned and masticated sites, respectively, compared with an untreated
control 1−2 yr after pinyon-juniper woodland treatment in southeast-
ern Utah. Mastication (shredding, chipping, or mulching thinning de-
bris) may improve understory development by moderating extremes
in soil temperature and moisture (Owen et al., 2009). However, me-
chanical disturbance on mastication sites and heat transfer to soils due
to smoldering combustion may increase establishment of nonnative
plant cover (Kreye et al., 2014; Coop et al., 2017). In our study, thinned
trees were lopped into small lengths and this debris was then scattered.
Like mastication, lop-and-scatter slash treatments have been shown to
improve environmental conditions for herbaceous understory plant es-
tablishment (Jacobs and Gatewood, 1999; Stoddard et al., 2008). Jacobs
(2015) described positive understory cover responses and reduced run-
off and sediment production, 3−5 yr after thinning and lop-and-scatter
in northern New Mexico. Ashcroft et al. (2017) found that thinning in-
tensity in northern New Mexico woodlands affected runoff, with areas
of low stand BA showing less runoff than those with higher BA and un-
treated controls. Our results suggested that slash treatment (broadcast
burn versus no burning) was less important in affecting understory
cover response than changes to tree density and overstory canopy
cover (see Fig. 6). Although Thin + Burn resulted in signiﬁcant increases
in abundance and tended to be higher than other treatments, total cover
averaged b 10% in 2017. Limited understory responses to thinning have
been reported in other pinyon-juniper woodlands (e.g., Redmond et al.,
2014; Huffman et al., 2017), and more research is necessary to better
understand community-level responses across the broad range of envi-
ronmental conditions and site histories associated with pinyon-juniper
ecosystems.
Comparisons with Conceptual State and Transition Model
Some ecologists have suggested that implementation of fuel reduc-
tion activities designed to address anthropogenic changes in frequent-
ﬁre forests may be ecologically inappropriate and damaging to
infrequent-ﬁre types (Romme et al., 2003; Floyd et al., 2004; Shinneman
and Baker, 2009; Schoennagel and Nelson, 2011). One approach for test-
ing these concerns is to evaluate treatment outcomes against models of
ecosystem responses to natural disturbances. High tree density and can-
opy cover, all-aged stands, and low understory abundance in untreated
units at our study site ﬁt descriptions of pinyon-juniper forest (Romme
et al., 2003) and persistent woodlands (Romme et al., 2009). In the US
Southwest, natural ﬁre rotations in these systems have been estimated
to be up to 600 yr and possibly longer on some (Floyd et al., 2008;
Kennard and Moore, 2013). Major ﬁre events are typically severe and
driven by wind and droughty conditions. High-severity ﬁre causes
rapid transition to a “skeletal forest” condition, characterized by stand-
ing dead trees and dominated by ruderal plants (see Fig. 1). Various
models of succession after severe ﬁre have been described, but most au-
thors agree that return to a closed woodland structure may require ≥2
centuries. For example, Arnold et al. (1964) described successional tran-
sition to two possible intermediate states after stand-replacing ﬁre—one
dominated by shrubs, the other dominated by perennial grasses—and
reoccurrence of ﬁre-causing transition from the shrub-dominated
state to the grass-dominated state. Similarly, Gori and Bate (2007)

characterized by differences in canopy cover and understory structure,
which in turn were inﬂuenced by ﬁre-free period length. Other studies
have described considerable changes in woodland structure due to
drought- and bark beetle−related tree mortality, mainly of large/old
pinyon pine (Negrón and Wilson, 2003; Breshears et al., 2005; Mueller
et al., 2005; Floyd et al., 2015). In contrast to stand-replacing ﬁre in
which most or all trees are killed, these disturbances may create more
open structures that enable more abundant understory development
and where large, old trees are less important. In our conceptual state
and transition model (see Fig. 1), we attempted to capture these dy-
namics while also simplifying structural variations to evaluate re-
sponses to treatments. To date, no quantitative models are available
that provide expected ranges of values for structural attributes in vari-
ous states. However, variability among sites and communities would
likely reduce the utility of quantitative models for evaluating general re-
sponse patterns and improving management decisions (Bestelmeyer
et al., 2004). Thus, with the exception of value ranges for canopy
cover, our evaluation of treatment effects against natural disturbance
processes and structural conditions was qualitative.
We identiﬁed treatment outcomes that both paralleled and
contrasted with descriptions of structural states in our model. Results
from cluster analysis indicated similarity in structural states between
Control and Burn treatments in 2017. Although the Burn treatment pro-
duced only minor decreases in tree density and fuels (crown fuel load
was 83% of Control), low-severity prescribed ﬁre also conserved struc-
tural integrity of these persistent woodlands by maintaining occurrence
of large trees, as well as an all-sized diameter distribution and higher
canopy cover. Further research could be done to determine whether
woodland structural characteristics would be sustained while more in-
tensive fuels reduction objectives were met incrementally with re-
peated ﬁre entries. The Thin treatment also showed greater than
average occurrence of large trees but low densities of small trees, as
well as low canopy cover and high graminoid and shrub cover. These
characteristics corresponded closer to expectations for the savanna
structural state than for persistent woodland or wooded shrubland.
However, thinning sharply reduced dominance of small trees and un-
derstory development was limited, and these characteristics contrast
with those described for pinyon-juniper savannas. Further monitoring
is necessary to determine the effects of individual tree growth and
tree recruitment on future structural characteristics in the Thin treat-
ment. Structural characteristics in the Thin + Burn treatment did not
correspond well to expectations for any of the four states in our concep-
tual model. Cluster analysis for Thin + Burn showed lower than average
large trees, small trees, and canopy cover and higher than average
graminoid cover and shrub cover. These results reﬂect both small tree
reductions from thinning and larger tree mortality in responses to pre-
scribed ﬁre. Continued mortality of large trees, in addition to recruit-
ment of young junipers in this treatment, may lead to conditions more
similar to early successional stages after severe ﬁre (Huffman et al.,
2012).
Implications
Results of our study showed that common treatments for restoration
and hazardous fuels reduction are effective for reducing tree density
and canopy fuel loads in persistent pinyon-juniper woodlands of the
Southwest. Woody surface fuels did not appear to be affected by thin-
ning and prescribed ﬁre, although this component of the fuels complex
may have low importance to crown ﬁre spread and propagation in per-
sistent woodlands (Floyd et al., 2015). Thinning and prescribed ﬁre
treatments continued to show canopy fuel loading reductions through
the 11-yr study period and minimal rebound in terms of tree recruit-
ment toward pretreatment conditions. Thus, treatments may have a
long-term effect on woodland structure. Although priority for design
of treatments is presently given to protection of human communities
in the WUI, urban expansion into wildlands is increasing (Radeloff
et al., 2018) and more attention should be given to ecological conserva-
tion when planning for fuels reduction in infrequent-ﬁre systems in
these areas. Evaluation of commonly used treatments against our state
and transition model suggested that concerns regarding loss of ecolog-
ical integrity may be warranted. Although the Burn treatment was
least effective in reducing fuel loads, it was more effective than Thin
and Thin + Burn in maintaining conditions expected for persistent
woodlands. Thinning treatments were designed to substantially reduce
small tree densities, and this approach appeared to conﬂict with expec-
tations for ecological states produced by natural disturbances and suc-
cessional processes. Thinning followed by prescribed ﬁre showed
additional losses of large trees and led to conditions not described by
our conceptual model. Further research is needed to test alternative ap-
proaches for reducing fuel loading in these systems while maintaining
ecological integrity by more closely adhering to reference states
resulting from natural disturbance.
